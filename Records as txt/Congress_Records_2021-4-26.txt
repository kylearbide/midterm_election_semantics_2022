PRAYER 
Reverend Michael Wilker, Lutheran 
Church of the Reformation, Wash-
ington, D.C., offered the following 
prayer: 
Creator, Shepherd, Sustainer of Life, 
thank You for the gifts of this day, of 
these our bodies, of this our govern-
ment, and of Your good Earth: 
for our waking breath and final 
heartbeat; 
for our eyes and ears, all limbs and 
senses; 
for honest and trustworthy officials, 
for the people of every State, terri-
tory and Tribe; 
for the spring Sun and full Moon, for 
redwoods, turtles, and bison. 
Even as we praise You, we recognize 
and grieve the wounds on our bodies 
and upon every part of the creation we 
have touched. 
Sustain every body that is oppressed 
by sin, racism, sexism, homophobia, 
and ableism, like a good shepherd who 
carries her sheep and leads them home, 
like a good shepherd who lays down His 
life for us. 
Then grant us compassion to be shep-
herds for others, loving them not sim-
ply in words and speeches, but in truth 
and action. 
Amen.

BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, at his 
first official news conference 1 month 
ago, President Biden said: 
I got elected to solve problems and the 
most urgent problem was COVID–19 and the 
economic disruption facing millions and mil-
lions of Americans. 
If we were to measure President 
Biden using only those standards, the 
first hundred days of the Biden-Harris 
administration have been a historic 
success. But this new administration 
has done far more in its first hundred 
days than just tackle the pandemic; it 
helped small families and small busi-
nesses that are hurting financially be-
cause of the coronavirus. 
President 
Biden 
is 
reestablishing 
America’s role as a leader in the world 
and repairing alliances that were dam-
aged dangerously under his prede-
cessor. Equally important, Joe Biden is 
restoring credibility and dignity to the 
Office of the President itself. 
As President Biden prepares to de-
liver his first joint address to Congress 
on Wednesday, it is worth considering 
how far we have come in 100 days. 
President Biden inherited a nation 
torn apart by political division, an out- 
of-control pandemic, and an economy 
that was in a deep, deep hole. Hundreds 
of thousands of American small busi-
nesses had been closed when he took of-
fice. The pandemic caused most of this. 
Millions of Americans had lost jobs. We 
lost 140,000 jobs in December alone. 
President Biden promised aggressive 
government action to stop the spread 
of the coronavirus and to stabilize the 
economy, and he and the Democrats in 
Congress are making good on those 
promises. 
Let’s remember where we came from. 
When Joe Biden took office, the United 
States 
was 
averaging 
195,000 
new 
COVID infections every day, and 3,000 
Americans 
were 
dying 
every 
day. 
Today, we have come down from 195,000 
daily infections to 57,000 and from 3,000 
COVID deaths every day to 700—still 
too many, but dramatic progress was 
made under this new President. 
Remember where we came from. 
When Biden took office, the United 
States of America had one of the high-
est COVID infection rates in the world. 
Two numbers tell the story of the first 
year of COVID–19 infection under the 
previous President. The United States 
of America has about 5 percent of the 
world’s population, but we had, when 
Biden took office, 20 percent—20 per-
cent—of the COVID–19 infections in the 
world and 20 percent of the deaths. Now 
there is hope. This President listened 
to the medical experts—he didn’t come 
up with his own theories of the case— 
and he expanded vaccine distribution. 
The day Joe Biden took office, on 
that day, January 20 of this year, to 
that day, the United States had admin-
istered 1.6 million COVID vaccine shots 
total in the Nation, 1.6 million. We are 
now seeing 3 million vaccinations ad-
ministered every day. 
President Biden promised to deliver 
100 million COVID–19 doses in his first 
hundred days. He didn’t do that; he de-
livered 200 million doses. Forty percent 
of all Americans, the majority of U.S. 
adults, have had at least one dose of 
the vaccine. Every American over the 
age of 16 is eligible now for the 
coronavirus vaccination free of charge. 
Greatly expanding COVID vaccina-
tions and testing are at the heart of

S2186 
April 26, 2021 
the American Rescue Plan that Presi-
dent Biden proposed and this Congress 
passed last month, sadly without one 
single Senate vote from our Republican 
colleagues; nor were there any House 
Republican votes in favor of it. 
The American Rescue Plan, exclu-
sively passed with Democratic votes, 
also included $1,400 emergency stim-
ulus checks to a majority of Ameri-
cans, assistance for schools, small busi-
nesses, and State and local govern-
ments. Enhanced unemployment bene-
fits, which were scheduled to stop last 
March, will continue until September. 
This is an economic lifeline for mil-
lions of Americans who lost their jobs 
during the pandemic. 
The American Rescue Plan expanded 
the child tax credit and makes it fully 
refundable so that families who need it 
most can benefit from it now. Amer-
ica’s child poverty rate today is one of 
the highest in the developed world. 
This action taken in President Biden’s 
American Rescue Plan could cut child 
poverty in America by 40 percent. 
We have been waiting for more than 
40 years for the benefits of a tax cut for 
the rich to trickle down and solve 
these problems, to help working fami-
lies, and to end poverty. It didn’t work. 
Income inequality in America grew 
under the Republican plan, and now it 
is greater than it was at the start of 
the Great Depression. But in less than 
40 days, the American Rescue Plan is 
already working. Here are the indica-
tions: 
Last month, the number of families 
behind in rent fell by 2 million. 
The share of adults who say they 
don’t have enough to eat fell from 1 in 
7 to 1 in 11. 
The U.S. economy added 916,000 jobs. 
In December, economic projections 
from the Federal Reserve had a fore-
cast of the U.S. economy growing by 
4.2 percent in 2021. After we passed the 
American Rescue Plan, that estimate 
jumped to a healthy, strong 61⁄2 per-
cent. 
Last month, consumer confidence in 
America hit its highest level since the 
pandemic shut down the economy a 
year ago. 
President Biden is also restoring 
America’s role as a global leader. He 
used his first speech to a global audi-
ence at the Munich Security Con-
ference 
in 
February 
to 
announce: 
‘‘America is back, [and] the trans-
atlantic alliance is back.’’ And ‘‘diplo-
macy is back at the heart of U.S. for-
eign policy.’’ 
President Biden is consulting with 
our allies, not insulting them, and he is 
countering 
authoritarian 
strongmen 
instead of cozying up to them. Earlier 
this month, the Biden administration 
announced new sanctions against Rus-
sia and expelled Kremlin diplomats 
over Russian interference in the 2020 
election. The SolarWinds cyber-espio-
nage campaign that targeted impor-
tant U.S. Federal Agencies and For-
tune 500 companies and other hostile 
acts certainly merited that action by 
the United States against Russia. Once 
again, America has a President willing 
to defend this Nation against attacks 
by a hostile government. 
President Biden is also reasserting 
American 
leadership 
in 
the 
fight 
against climate change. On his first 
full day in office, he began the process 
to rejoin the Paris Agreement. Remem-
ber when President Trump withdrew 
from the Paris Agreement, making the 
United States the only Nation in the 
world that hadn’t signed up for this ef-
fort? On Earth Day last week, Presi-
dent Biden hosted a virtual summit of 
leaders from 40 nations and announced 
that the United States will cut its car-
bon emissions by half by 2035. Under 
Joe Biden, America is ready to lead the 
global effort to avoid climate catas-
trophe and create good, new green jobs 
and industries of the future. Don’t we 
owe that to our kids and grand-
children? 
President Biden is returning nor-
malcy and dignity to the Office of the 
President. At a townhall meeting in 
Wisconsin in February, the President 
told the Nation: 
The next four years, I want to make sure 
all the news is about the American people. 
He has replaced ego with empathy, 
chaos with competence, and division 
with decency and unity. 
White House briefings are filled with 
information, not insults. The @POTUS 
Twitter account no longer fires off 
tweets in the middle of the night that 
are unsettling to Americans and even 
our allies. 
One of our colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle complained. He re-
cently 
bemoaned 
President 
Biden’s 
Twitter feed when he said ‘‘unimagi-
nably conventional.’’ He meant that as 
a criticism. Most American people find 
it a relief. 
Polls show that the majority of 
Americans 
approve 
of 
President 
Biden’s leadership on the coronavirus 
and the economy. A new poll by the 
Kennedy School at Harvard finds that 
among young people between the ages 
of 18 and 29, 56 percent—a solid major-
ity—say they are hopeful about Amer-
ica’s future. That is the highest for any 
President in the 21-year history of the 
poll. 
The challenges that President Biden 
and Vice President Harris inherited 
were historic. They won’t be solved in 
a hundred days, maybe not in a hun-
dred weeks. But in his first hundred 
days as President, Joe Biden has kept 
his promises and has begun to restore 
the most precious commodity of all— 
America’s sense of hope and common 
purpose. Those qualities built this Na-
tion, and they will build our future. 
(Ms. HIRONO assumed the Chair.) 
AMERICAN JOBS PLAN 
Madam President, last week, a few of 
my Republican colleagues introduced 
their 
counterproposal 
to 
President 
Biden’s American Jobs Plan. The sen-
ior Senator from Mississippi called the 
proposal a ‘‘good-faith effort.’’ He wish-
es to engage with Democrats on an 
issue that touches every community in 
America on a subject we all know—in-
frastructure. 
I think I speak for the entire Demo-
cratic caucus in welcoming this effort 
from our friends across the aisle. As I 
mentioned earlier, when it came to the 
American Rescue Plan for vaccines and 
vaccinations and cash support for fami-
lies and help for small businesses and 
schools, not a single Republican would 
join us. It is time for us to come to-
gether and work on a bipartisan basis. 
Maybe this is a start. 
After all, infrastructure is what 
should unite us. Whether you live in 
Laurel, MS, or the Lake View section 
of Chicago, our roads, bridges, and our 
fiber-optic networks keep us connected 
and keep us moving. 
As we emerge from this pandemic, it 
is clear that Americans are ready to 
get to work building a stronger coun-
try, a healthier country, and a more 
prosperous country. Sadly, though, the 
proposal from my Republican friends 
really fails to meet the once-in-a-gen-
eration opportunity test to transform 
America and make America a winner 
in the 21st century. 
At a time when millions of Ameri-
cans lack access to reliable, efficient 
transportation and millions more lack 
access to reliable high-speed internet, 
we can’t settle for just repaving old 
roads or filling potholes. We need to in-
vest in this Nation’s future and put 
people back to work building a sustain-
able economic foundation for our chil-
dren and grandchildren to grow and 
thrive. We need an infrastructure plan 
that is a blueprint for the world of to-
morrow, not just a patchwork quilt fo-
cused on yesterday. 
The way I see it, we are on the cusp 
of a world where America owns the 
clean energy economy and exports our 
union-made electric trucks and cars 
across the globe. Where workers can 
get to work easily by bus, train, or 
bike and working parents don’t have to 
worry about finding a safe and afford-
able place to leave their kids when 
they are working. A world where, rath-
er than reading about the Mesozoic Era 
in an outdated textbook, a child can 
throw on a virtual reality headset in 
the home or classroom and watch in 
awe as a T. rex swings its massive tail 
over their head. A world in which 
America makes and sells the new tech-
nologies of the sustainable economy to 
the world rather than buying them. 
That is a future powered by the infra-
structure 
of 
tomorrow. 
Under 
the 
American Jobs Plan, it is a future 
made in America. But we need to start 
building it today because, if we don’t, I 
guarantee you somebody else will. 
My friends, take a look across the 
ocean. Do we really believe that China, 
for example, is skimping on investing 
in its future? Absolutely not. They are 
already using technologies like artifi-
cial intelligence to ease traffic conges-
tion in cities. They are installing facial 
recognition systems on their streets to 
keep tabs on jaywalkers and, sadly, 
tabs on ethnic minorities like Uighurs.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2187 
April 26, 2021 
That is the difference between us and 
China. In China, the Communist Party 
uses technology to broaden the scope of 
its surveillance state. In America, we 
have an opportunity to show the world 
that technology and innovation can ac-
tually strengthen democracy by giving 
people the freedom to work the way 
they want with universal broadband 
and to move around the way they want 
with new forms of transportation. 
The President’s American Jobs Plan 
will give our kids an honest shot to 
thrive by eliminating lead pipes and 
service lines from our drinking water 
systems and making safe, affordable 
housing a reality for millions of work-
ing families. 
I can’t help but acknowledge my col-
league 
Senator 
TAMMY
DUCKWORTH 
when it comes to clean water and new 
lead pipes and service lines for our 
drinking water systems. I am proud of 
the initiative and leadership that she 
has shown, working with other Mem-
bers of the Senate, to make this a re-
ality. 
This is a unifying vision for the fu-
ture. It is a model for global leader-
ship. So let’s not balk at the cost of 
making it a reality. This is not the 
time to think small. We are talking 
about a transformative undertaking, 
and that is part of what America has 
always been about. 
More than half a century ago, Repub-
lican President Dwight Eisenhower 
launched the Interstate Highway Sys-
tem. It changed America. Today, the 
program’s nearly 50,000 miles of ex-
pressway carry about one-fourth of all 
traffic in the United States. These 
roads connect our communities, have 
created communities, and serve as a 
bedrock for our economy. 
In today’s numbers, if you tried to 
rebuild the Interstate Highway Sys-
tem, it would cost half a trillion dol-
lars—probably much more, to be hon-
est. It is not a small sum. But, boy, it 
is an investment that paid off. The pro-
gram generated $6 in economic activity 
for every dollar spent to build those 
roads and highways. 
And the fact is, today we need to in-
vest in order to build our future. When 
President Eisenhower launched the 
Interstate Highway Program, we didn’t 
have e-commerce or same-day ship-
ments. It was more than 10 years be-
fore Neil Armstrong stepped foot on 
the Moon. Now, each of us carries 
around a pocket-sized device with more 
than enough computing power to get 
him to the Moon and back. 
The world has changed—in many 
ways, for the better. Today, it is not 
sufficient for an infrastructure plan to 
begin and end with bridges and roads. 
If we want to support a modern econ-
omy and sustain growth for genera-
tions to come, we need to invest in the 
infrastructure for tomorrow. 
This isn’t to say that we have all the 
answers on this side of the aisle. But 
there is one answer we should all get 
behind: Go big; go bold. We can’t 
penny-pinch America into first place. 
And don’t take it from me: Ameri-
cans of all political stripes—Demo-
crats, Independents, and Republicans— 
support marshaling the resources of 
the Federal Government to go big and 
bold on infrastructure. They want us to 
not only repair our highways and 
bridges but to rebuild our waterways 
and airports and make high-speed 
broadband internet available to every-
one. 
Americans support a plan that puts 
us on track to have an American cen-
tury in the 21st century. That is our 
plan, and victory is within our reach. 
There was an architect and designer 
in the city of Chicago in the transition 
from the 19th to the 20th century who 
helped design the Columbian Expo-
sition, ‘‘White City,’’ and a lot of his-
tory was made with those decisions. 
His name was Daniel Burnham. When 
he was asked about planning some-
thing like the White City, the Colum-
bian Exposition, in the city of Chicago, 
he had a quote that you will turn to al-
most every day if you follow what is 
going on in planning in Chicago. Here 
is what he said: ‘‘Make no little plans. 
They have no magic to stir men’s 
blood’’—and I might add, women— 
‘‘They have no magic to stir men’s 
blood and probably themselves will not 
be realized.’’ 
They have no magic to stir men’s 
blood and probably will not themselves 
be realized. I think we understand that. 
As President Eisenhower gave Amer-
ica a vision with the Interstate High-
way System, a connected nation and a 
new America, we need to do the same. 
President Biden has challenged us to 
do it. We need to do it on a bipartisan 
basis. I look forward to working with 
my colleagues to make it a reality. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Republican leader is recognized. 
RECOGNIZING THE UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY 
WILDCATS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
over the weekend, the University of 
Kentucky’s women’s volleyball team 
made history. The Wildcats hoisted the 
program’s first NCAA volleyball na-
tional championship trophy after de-
feating Texas on Saturday night. The 
falling confetti in Omaha closed out an 
incredible 24-win season. The Wildcats’ 
unmatched athleticism and resilience 
fueled their paths to the title. 
Yesterday afternoon at UK’s Memo-
rial Coliseum, enthusiastic fans wel-
comed home their champions, includ-
ing Madison Lilley, who was named the 
tournament’s ‘‘Most Outstanding Play-
er.’’ 
So I would like to extend the Sen-
ate’s congratulations to the players, 
Head Coach Craig Skinner, and the en-
tire program. Kentucky and all of Big 
Blue Nation couldn’t be prouder. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Madam President, on another mat-
ter, it has been nearly a month since 
the Biden administration rolled out its 
so-called infrastructure plan. It quick-
ly became clear that their proposal 
mainly focused on everything but the 
things normal people call infrastruc-
ture. 
The day this plan was introduced, the 
White House messaging document men-
tioned 
the 
words 
‘‘climate’’ 
and 
‘‘union’’ more often than ‘‘roads’’ and 
‘‘bridges.’’ And the numbers back that 
up. Out of more than $2 trillion in pro-
posed spending, less than 6 percent 
would go to roads and bridges. Even 
when you add in airports, ports, rail, 
and waterways, the total would still be 
exceeded by the amount going to elec-
tric vehicles alone. Even an Ivy League 
expert said using ‘‘infrastructure’’ to 
describe the totality of the bill ‘‘does a 
bit of violence to the English lan-
guage.’’ 
So after a few days of trying to bat-
tle the English language, Democrats 
began to pivot. I understand this is no 
longer an ‘‘infrastructure’’ plan. Now it 
is a ‘‘jobs’’ plan. But that turns out to 
be just as dishonest. This proposal isn’t 
any more focused on creating jobs than 
it is on fixing roads. 
Even by the favorable metrics that 
the White House likes to use, this plan 
would 
cost 
Americans 
more 
than 
$800,000 for every new job that would 
exist 10 years down the road. 
Serious, bipartisan legislation to re-
build American infrastructure could 
have a big impact at a fraction—a frac-
tion—of the cost. This plan is bloated, 
unfocused. It is not a targeted recipe 
for better public works. 
When America actually puts our 
mind to things, we can do them. Re-
member Operation Warp Speed? But 
this isn’t like that. This is a sloppy lib-
eral wish list that would spend a lot 
and get very little in return. 
The far left has been bragging about 
all the social engineering and welfare 
spending that is stuffed into these pro-
posals. They have boasted that the 
DNA of the Green New Deal is all over 
this administration’s agenda. 
Roads, bridges, and ports are bipar-
tisan priorities. Water infrastructure 
and broadband are bipartisan prior-
ities. That is why when the Senate 
tackles honest-to-goodness infrastruc-
ture in a smart way, we almost always 
have wide bipartisan margins. 
Last week, our colleague from West 
Virginia, Senator CAPITO, got together 
with the other ranking members of 
committees that deal with actual in-
frastructure. These Republicans put 
forward a smart proposal that would 
meet pressing needs in actual infra-
structure. 
So now comes the critical moment. 
Now is the time we learn whether 
Democrats really want to jump start

actual public works projects or wheth-
er infrastructure was only ever in-
tended as a wrapping paper for unre-
lated gifts to the far left. 
Remember what happened when Re-
publicans went to President Biden, of-
fering a bipartisan compromise path on 
COVID relief. They were informed the 
Democrats 
were 
not 
interested 
in 
working together. So our country 
needs the administration to find a 
smarter approach. 
FOREIGN POLICY 
Madam President, now, on one final 
matter, the last few months have given 
the world a glimpse at what is driving 
the foreign policy decisions under the 
Biden administration. First came a 
rush to rejoin a climate agreement 
that does not effectively hold our com-
petitors to their own commitments. 
Then, just weeks ago, there was the 
announcement of a total abandonment 
of Afghanistan that will squander our 
leverage to promote a diplomatic end 
to the civil war, put innocent Afghans 
at risk, roll out a red carpet for the 
Taliban, and embolden the terrorists. 
Even this administration’s own intel-
ligence chiefs and our military com-
manders are concerned about how we 
will stay a step ahead of terrorists in 
the region without access provided by 
our U.S. footprint. 
Late last week, we got a further peek 
at the incredible wishful thinking be-
hind this policy. As reported in the 
New York Times, some Biden officials 
suggest the Taliban ‘‘might govern less 
harshly . . . in order to win recognition 
and financial support.’’ 
The Secretary of State—America’s 
top diplomat—seems to think it is that 
simple. He expressed hope that ‘‘civil-
ian and economic assistance’’ could 
‘‘advance a just and durable peace . . . 
and a brighter future for the Afghan 
people.’’ 
The Deputy National Security Advi-
sor was more dismissive of the Afghan 
people’s plight, morally equating our 
Afghan partners and the Taliban as 
just ‘‘two Afghan parties’’ in a conflict. 
I do not believe Afghan women and 
girls are jumping for joy at the pros-
pect of a Taliban takeover. In fact, as 
one of the New York Times headlines 
put it, ‘‘Afghan Women Fear the 
Worst’’—‘‘Afghan 
Women 
Fear 
the 
Worst.’’ 
I certainly do not believe the Taliban 
will abandon their brutal fundamen-
talist ways just to secure recognition 
from the Western powers that they de-
spise. 
Speaking of women’s rights, over the 
weekend, the United Nations chose to 
further degrade its legitimacy by invit-
ing Iran, of all countries, to join its 
Commission on the Status of Women. 
The U.N. chose to further degrade its 
legitimacy by inviting Iran to join its 
Commission on the Status of Women. 
Yes, you heard that right. The panel 
claiming principal international au-
thority 
over 
the 
empowerment 
of 
women will now include a nation whose 
police are empowered to beat and as-
sault women for improper veiling—a 
nation that turns a blind eye to perva-
sive domestic violence, forced mar-
riage, and rape. 
And it is not just the U.N. that seems 
to be going soft on Tehran. The Biden 
administration seems willing—if not 
desperate—to provide sanctions relief 
up front, squandering leverage, just to 
reenter President Obama’s flawed nu-
clear deal. 
This sanctions relief would benefit a 
regime that is being run by the extrem-
ist Islamic Revolutionary Guards. That 
is what Iran’s own Foreign Minister ad-
mitted in leaked documents. That is 
who is running the show—the same ter-
rorists who were used by Soleimani to 
spread violence across the region, be-
fore the prior administration removed 
him permanently. 
Republicans are not opposed to nu-
clear diplomacy, but we know that pre-
emptive concessions will not secure a 
better deal or make America or our al-
lies more secure. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
DUCKWORTH). Without objection, it is 
so ordered. 
WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DAY 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, as we 
finally, finally begin to turn the corner 
on the coronavirus pandemic, we have 
the hard work of rebuilding our econ-
omy. 
One of the core engines of the Amer-
ican economy is intellectual property. 
From the smallest startup to the larg-
est multinational company, intellec-
tual property is central to creating 
jobs, boosting economic output, and 
protecting consumers. So it is appro-
priate that, today, we celebrate World 
Intellectual Property Day, which rec-
ognizes the important role that intel-
lectual property plays in promoting in-
novation, 
creativity, 
and 
economic 
growth. 
This year’s World IP Day theme cele-
brates the contributions of small- and 
medium-sized businesses to the global 
marketplace. Why? Well, these small 
enterprises make up 90 percent of the 
world’s businesses. Whether through 
protecting their brands with trade-
marks or their inventions with pat-
ents, intellectual property allows these 
small companies to grow and succeed; 
yet, here at home, far too many Ameri-
cans with an entrepreneurial spirit find 
key elements of the intellectual prop-
erty system out of their reach. 
Last week, the Senate Judiciary Sub-
committee on Intellectual Property— 
and I am privileged to chair that—held 
an important hearing to find ways to 
boost access in the patent system. We 
know that women and people of color 
are chronically underrepresented in the 
patent system, which results in a seri-
ous loss to our economy. 
I am particularly proud that this 
hearing featured testimony from Geor-
gia Grace Edwards, a Middlebury Col-
lege graduate and entrepreneur, who 
realized that, after spending a summer 
in Alaska and 8 to 12 hours at a time on 
ice, she was at a serious disadvantage 
when it came to answering nature’s 
call during her treks. Like so many 
innovators before her, Georgia Grace 
got to work in designing a new zipper— 
in sense, it was such a great thing— 
that could be incorporated into a vari-
ety of women’s pants. 
Now, while she was ultimately able 
to successfully navigate the patent sys-
tem and secure protection for her idea, 
here is the problem. She faced a num-
ber of barriers along the way: the high 
cost of obtaining a patent, particularly 
from legal fees; a lack of knowledge 
about how the patent system works; 
and the lack of representation of 
women throughout the system. 
Ten years ago, Congress enacted the 
Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, 
which put structures in place to help 
access the patent system and bring up 
a far more diverse set of inventors into 
the innovation economy, and at our 
hearing, we heard specific ideas for 
building on the success of the Leahy- 
Smith America Invents Act. 
As the President awaits nominating 
the next Director of the U.S. Patent 
and Trademark Office, I want him to 
choose a nominee who shares a com-
mitment to increasing access. It is not 
just the huge companies that need it; it 
is the small inventors. 
It is important that the next Direc-
tor of the U.S. Patent and Trademark 
Office respect the law, including the 
statutory bounds set by Congress. You 
know, the last administration took 
steps to undermine the Leahy-Smith 
Act. They acted outside those statu-
tory bounds. 
I have always sought to curb the po-
tential for poor-quality patents to be 
abused. That drove much of the work 
we did 10 years ago. So I look forward 
to supporting a nominee for PTO Direc-
tor who shares my view that it is im-
portant to weed out poor-quality pat-
ents, avoid the potential for abuse, but 
at the same time reinforce the protec-
tion provided to high-quality patents. 
We must also work to ensure that 
hard-working small business owners 
and creators who rely on copyright 
protections to make a living are able 
to protect their works online. 
While I appreciate the steps that 
some online platforms are taking to 
address the persistent problem of on-
line infringement, much like the issue 
of diversity in the patent system, more 
work needs to be done. 
Last month, I joined with Senator 
TILLIS and other members of the IP 
Subcommittee, and we sent a letter to 
major online platforms outlining spe-
cific voluntary measures they could 
adapt to crack down on online infringe-
ment. I hope that on World IP Day, the 
leaders of these online platforms will 
take a moment to consider the plight

of the individual songwriter or photog-
rapher or the independent film pro-
ducer and give serious thought to steps 
they can take to ensure that creators 
can adequately protect their works on-
line. You know, for these small and 
independent creators, nothing short of 
their livelihoods is at stake. 
Finally, I want to recognize the im-
portant work our IP system does to 
protect consumers. The trademark sys-
tem helps to guide consumers in find-
ing which products are legitimate but 
also which are not. 
Unfortunately, fraudsters are relent-
less in exploiting opportunities to fool 
consumers 
into 
buying 
counterfeit 
products, and that has been especially 
dangerous during the global pandemic. 
Just last month, authorities seized 
more than 65,000 counterfeit 3M N95 
masks—not like the real one I am hold-
ing. But that is just the tip of the ice-
berg. As the chairman of the Senate 
Appropriations Committee, I am com-
mitted to ensuring that Customs and 
Border Patrol has the resources it 
needs to respond to the ever-evolving 
counterfeiting threat. A diverse, acces-
sible, and effective intellectual prop-
erty system that rewards creativity 
and innovation is essential to our Na-
tion’s continued prosperity, and I look 
forward 
to 
working 
with 
Ranking 
Member TILLIS and the other members 
of the IP Subcommittee, as well as 
with the Appropriations Committee, to 
both celebrate the achievements of 
American inventors and ensure that 
their contributions are being pro-
tected. 
CONGRESSIONAL SPENDING 
Madam President, I rise today to ad-
dress the need for Congress to restore 
one of its constitutional powers, the 
power of the purse. 
My family arrived in Vermont in the 
19th century to work in the granite 
quarries in Barre. Later, my parents 
ran a printing business right across 
from the Vermont State House in 
Montpelier where I grew up. 
I stayed in Vermont for college, only 
traveling 45 minutes up the road to 
Saint Michael’s College where I re-
ceived an excellent education. After 
earning my law degree at Georgetown, 
I returned home to Vermont to serve as 
the State’s attorney for Chittenden 
County. 
As Vermont’s senior Senator, serving 
the last 46 years, I speak with commu-
nity leaders, dairy farmers, small busi-
ness owners, and Vermonters across 
the State every day. My staff in 
Vermont and DC dedicate themselves 
to doing the same. Before the pan-
demic, Marcelle and I would stop to 
chat with people in the grocery store, 
at the gas station, or in our favorite 
bakery in my hometown of Middlesex. 
We miss being able to do this during 
these times of social distancing, and 
are looking forward to the day when we 
can return to those in-person chats and 
visits. 
Needless to say, I am a lifelong 
Vermonter, and I know my State very 
well. I have a deep understanding of 
Vermont’s communities, Vermonters, 
and their needs. 
But for the past decade, I have had to 
fight for them here in Washington with 
my hands tied behind my back. Every 
Member of this Chamber has their 
hands tied, because we ceded the power 
of the purse to unelected bureaucrats 
here in Washington when we instituted 
a 
ban 
on 
congressionally 
directed 
spending. As a result, instead of being 
able to direct even a fraction of the tax 
dollars we collect from our hard work-
ing constituents back into their com-
munities, we turned these decisions 
over to the executive branch. 
These unelected officials are dedi-
cated public servants to be sure, but 
they cannot possibly understand the 
needs of our communities to the extent 
that Senators do. To them, a new com-
munity center is nothing more than a 
line item on a spreadsheet. To us, we 
know the potential such a community 
center can unlock because we have spo-
ken to the organizers who want to 
build it. We have heard their plans for 
new programs to provide children with 
afterschool 
opportunities, 
offer 
job 
training programs to the recently un-
employed, or provide a social space for 
the community to gather. 
A grant for the historic preservation 
of a rural downtown is just one of thou-
sands of applications that may be con-
sidered by employees at the National 
Park Service. But I know what that 
money can do in the hands of dedicated 
community advocates, someone like 
my late, dear friend Paul Bruhn at the 
Preservation Trust of Vermont. Paul 
saw the potential of historic preserva-
tion of rural downtown spaces to sup-
port small businesses and preserve the 
fabric of Vermont, but there is no rea-
son the National Park Service employ-
ees would know what a visionary he 
was or how much just a little bit of 
Federal support could be stretched to 
help revitalize a community. 
Senators of this Chamber were forced 
to push for these worthwhile efforts by 
advocating to unelected officials to 
support projects in towns these offi-
cials have never visited run by pas-
sionate community leaders they have 
never met. 
The practice previously referred to as 
‘‘earmarking’’ was not without abuse, 
and some particularly high profile ex-
amples of that abuse. But today, 65 per-
cent of Congress was elected after the 
ban in 2011 and only know the practice 
for its ugly headlines, not the great 
benefit it can bring to our communities 
and our society. 
We can still see the benefit from 
projects 
previously 
funded 
through 
congressionally directed spending in 
communities around the country and 
in successful national programs today. 
The research that led to the Human 
Genome Project unlocking our genetic 
code was originally funded through 
congressionally directed spending. The 
WIC program was as well. In Vermont, 
congressionally directed spending has 
helped build affordable housing, reha-
bilitate our downtowns, and promote 
community and economic development 
throughout the State. 
This is not a new concept. Congress 
passed the first bill containing an ear-
mark in 1790, 231 years ago. The Cape 
Henry lighthouse guided boats to safe-
ty for almost 100 years, and it stands 
today. It is the fourth oldest light-
house in the United States, and has 
been listed on the U.S. National Reg-
ister of Historic Places and designated 
as a National Historic Landmark. It is 
a destination for tourists still today. 
Many of my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle have pointed to con-
gressionally directed spending as the 
source of our country’s increasing na-
tional debt, but this is not the case. 
This spending rarely exceeded 1 percent 
of all discretionary spending, and dis-
cretionary spending is only one-third 
of all Federal spending. So, approxi-
mately 1 percent of one-third of all 
Federal spending was congressionally 
directed. As noted by the New York 
Times, this is little more than a round-
ing error when considering the entire 
Federal budget of the United States of 
America. 
Congressionally 
directed 
spending 
was never a source of new money that 
was tacked onto appropriations bills. 
These projects had to fit under our 
budgetary caps, caps that were agreed 
to on a bipartisan basis. After more 
than a decade, it is clear that banning 
congressionally directed spending did 
not decrease Federal spending or our 
national debt, and that is because it 
was not the cause of our debt. All the 
ban did was remove a very effective 
tool for Members to advance important 
projects in their States. 
The late and former chairman of the 
Senate 
Appropriations 
Committee, 
Senator Robert C. Byrd, once said that 
the subject of congressionally directed 
spending ‘‘broaches the most serious of 
Constitutional questions . . . [w]ho 
shall control expenditures from the 
public treasuries—the unaccountable 
bureaucrats in the Executive Branch or 
the representatives of the people?’’ 
Article I, section 9 of the Constitu-
tion says: ‘‘No money shall be drawn 
from the Treasury, but in consequence 
of Appropriations made by law.’’ Con-
gress holds the power of the purse. By 
banning the practice of congressionally 
directed spending, Congress ceded this 
power to the executive branch, and I 
believe it has hurt our ability to pass 
appropriations bills into law. 
Vice Chairman SHELBY and I work 
hard to incorporate the recommenda-
tions and priorities of all 100 Senators 
into our annual appropriations bills. 
We have worked hard to return the ap-
propriations process to regular order, 
and we are making progress. Passing 
our annual appropriations bills is one 
of the most important jobs we do. The 
funding these bills provide impacts 
every corner of every State, from high-
way dollars to healthcare centers. But 
without the ability to influence where

the funds are spent, Members seem to 
have lost incentive to debate these 
bills. That is one of the reasons why we 
constantly face the threat of a govern-
ment shutdown each fiscal year or that 
are forced to package these bills into 
an omnibus in a take-it-or-leave it 
form. This is no way to govern. Mem-
bers must have a stake in these bills. 
In 2007, we instituted major reforms 
for accountability and transparency to 
the process of congressionally directed 
spending. We had to certify that nei-
ther we nor any member of our imme-
diate family would financially benefit 
from the requests we made. And we re-
quired each earmark to be clearly iden-
tified in the committee and conference 
reports. These reforms brought new 
transparency to the process, and I fully 
supported them. These rules remain in 
place today in rule XLIV of the Stand-
ing Rules of the Senate. 
Today I am announcing that the Sen-
ate 
Appropriations 
Committee 
will 
again accept requests for congression-
ally directed spending items on a bi-
partisan basis, and we will do so in a 
manner that promotes transparency 
and accountability. In addition to ad-
hering to rule XLIV of the Standing 
Rules of the Senate, we will put a 1- 
percent cap on all congressionally di-
rected spending items and ban congres-
sionally directed spending items to for- 
profit entities. 
We will require Senators to make 
their requests public on their websites, 
and we will make public any items that 
are actually funded in the appropria-
tions bills. The Senate Appropriations 
Committee will also ask GAO to audit 
a sample of enacted congressionally di-
rected spending items in order to in-
crease accountability for the projects 
that are funded and to restore the trust 
of the American people in this process. 
Congress holds the power of the 
purse. We should use it responsibly and 
transparently to address the needs of 
our communities. 
I want to thank the distinguished 
majority leader for putting Samantha 
Power on the agenda this week. I think 
she is extraordinarily well qualified, 
and I look forward to voting for her. 
Madam President, I see my distin-
guished colleague on the floor. 
I yield the floor. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
thank my good friend—our Senate pro 
tempore, our chairman of Appropria-
tions, our longtime chairman and 
ranking member of the Judiciary, who 
has done a lot on patent work, et 
cetera—for his graciousness. 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Madam President, now, the Senate 
has a lot to accomplish by the end of 
this week. 
We will confirm several highly quali-
fied nominees to the executive branch, 
starting today with the nominee for 
Deputy OMB Director, Jason Miller. 
Later this week, we will also confirm 
Janet McCabe for Deputy EPA Admin-
istrator, Colin Kahl for Under Sec-
retary of Defense for Policy, and 
Samantha Power for Administrator of 
USAID. 
Our Senate committees will continue 
holding hearings and markups on at 
least a dozen other nominees. The Sen-
ate will also consider two important 
environmental infrastructure policies. 
First, the Senate will take up the 
Drinking Water and Wastewater Infra-
structure Act of 2021. This legislation 
passed through the Committee on En-
vironment and Public Works with 
unanimous support. In fact, this water 
infrastructure bill is a core component 
of the Republican infrastructure pro-
posal released last week. It also ad-
dresses many of the recommendations 
put forward by the Problem Solvers 
Caucus last Friday. So I hope that this 
is a signal to the entire Senate that we 
should work together on infrastructure 
where and when we can. 
Senators CARPER, DUCKWORTH, and 
CARDIN have been outstanding leaders 
on this issue and have made sure Mem-
bers from both sides of the aisle have 
had the opportunity to offer amend-
ments, just as we did last week on the 
anti-Asian hate crimes bill. We are 
going to continue working with our Re-
publican colleagues on the timing for a 
vote on the water infrastructure bill. 
On a topic this straightforward and bi-
partisan, I hope that our Republican 
colleagues will cooperate so that we 
may finish the bill ASAP. We have a 
lot to do. 
I want to also thank Senator CAPITO, 
the ranking member of the committee, 
for working with Senators CARPER, 
DUCKWORTH, and COLLINS so well. 
The Senate will also vote on a meas-
ure this week to restore critical regula-
tions on the release of methane into 
our atmosphere. In 2016, the Obama ad-
ministration instituted a rule that re-
quired energy companies to better 
monitor and reduce methane leaks. 
The rule not only drew cheers from the 
environmental community, it earned 
the support of industry as well. 
Even though methane is far less 
talked about than carbon dioxide, it is 
far more potent. A tonne of methane 
warms the atmosphere 86 times more 
than a tonne of carbon dioxide. On the 
plus side, however, methane does not 
linger in our atmosphere as long as CO2 
does, and emissions can be reduced 
rather cheaply. So, when it comes to 
combating climate change, tackling 
methane delivers a huge bang for your 
buck. 
That is just what the Senate intends 
to do this week by reimposing com-
monsense rules to reduce methane 
emissions—hopefully, on a bipartisan 
basis. We already have the support of 
at least one Republican Senator. We 
welcome more. The industry supported 
this. Again, Donald Trump, often with 
just the nastiness of ‘‘it was Obama’s 
rule, so I ought to repeal it’’ did. It 
hurts us big time. I want to be clear. 
The methane CRA is a big deal. This 
measure will help us address the cli-
mate crisis in a major way. It is no-
where close to everything we want or 
need, but it is very important. 
Last week, President Biden set an 
ambitious goal for the United States to 
cut its greenhouse gas emissions in 
half by the end of the decade. This 
week, the Senate will take up the first 
of many important steps we need to 
take to achieve that ambitious goal. 
FIRST 100 DAYS 
Madam President, now, on our first 
100 days, Thursday, the 29th, will be 
the 100th day since President Biden 
took the oath of office on the East 
Front of the Capitol. President Biden 
will mark the occasion with his inau-
gural address to a joint session of Con-
gress on Wednesday. 
Historically, the first 100 days have 
been a yardstick by which Presidential 
administrations have been measured. 
For the first time in recent history, 
however, due to the lateness of the 
Georgia runoff elections, Thursday also 
marks the 100th day of the new Demo-
cratic Senate majority and, on a per-
sonal note, my 100th day as majority 
leader. 
Without exaggeration, the first 100 
days of the Biden administration and 
the Senate Democratic majority have 
been more productive than nearly any 
in recent memory. Despite a delay in 
passing the organizing resolution and 
the time constraints imposed by the 
Presidential impeachment trial, the 
Senate has confirmed the most diverse 
Cabinet in history, faster than either 
of the prior two administrations. Every 
single Cabinet Secretary received a bi-
partisan vote in favor of confirmation. 
Last week, by a vote of 94 to 1— 
again, led by the Presiding Officer and 
Senator HIRONO—the Senate passed 
legislation to combat the recent surge 
in hate crimes, particularly against 
Americans of Asian descent. Then, of 
course, Congress passed the landmark 
legislation and the top priority of the 
Biden administration, the American 
Rescue Plan. It was the most sweeping 
Federal recovery effort in a generation, 
more than twice the size of the stim-
ulus package after the financial crisis 
of 2008. 
The Democrats promised big, bold re-
lief. The Democrats have delivered big, 
bold relief. As a result, vaccinations 
are up; unemployment is down; and 
businesses, schools, restaurants, and 
bars are finally—finally—starting to 
reopen. It is no wonder that more than 
70 percent of Americans approve of the 
way that the Biden-Harris administra-
tion has handled the pandemic in the 
first 100 days. 
For much of the past year, the coun-
try has been plagued by two major cri-
ses: a public health crisis and an eco-
nomic crisis. That is what the Biden- 
Harris administration and the Senate 
Democratic majority inherited when 
they assumed power back in January. 
Let’s look at how the country has pro-
gressed on both fronts. 
First, when it comes to the pan-
demic, we have far outstripped even

April 26, 2021 
the rosiest of predictions for the num-
ber of vaccinations. President Biden 
initially promised 100 million vaccina-
tions to be administered in the first 100 
days, but the pace of vaccinations was 
so fast that the President had to dou-
ble his initial goal to 200 million in the 
first 100 days, and we have already 
reached it. It is fair to say that, in the 
first 100 days, America is winning the 
all-important ‘‘arms race’’ to get our 
citizens vaccinated. 
On the most important measure of 
progress—getting 
the 
country 
pro-
tected 
against 
COVID–19—the 
new 
Democratic administration and con-
gressional majorities have been a roar-
ing success. Thanks to the American 
Rescue Plan, our economy has gotten 
its own shot in the arm, too. Over the 
past several weeks, the Biden adminis-
tration has delivered more than 150 
million stimulus checks to the Ameri-
cans who have needed them the most. 
Weekly unemployment claims have 
fallen to their lowest level during the 
pandemic. The month of March saw the 
economy create nearly 900,000 jobs. Re-
tail sales are surging. Consumer con-
fidence has rebounded. Economic fore-
casters are now projecting that our 
economy could grow as fast as 7 per-
cent this year. In the wake of the 
American Rescue Plan, the economic 
boost was so significant that fore-
casters had to increase their projec-
tions for global growth as well. 
Our former President blithely pre-
dicted that electing Joe Biden would 
crash the stock market. It turns out 
President Biden’s first 100 days have 
delivered the best stock market results 
in 75 years, since President Eisen-
hower. 
At the same time, the Democratic 
majority in Congress has made sure 
that our Nation’s economic recovery 
will be felt by everyone. The American 
Rescue Plan is expected to boost in-
comes of the lowest 20 percent by 20 
percent. Guess what those in the top 1 
percent will receive? It will be so con-
trary to what the Republicans did 
when they had power. They will get 
zero percent instead of the over-
whelming percentage in their bill, 
their tax cuts. Just one policy in the 
American Rescue Plan—the historic 
expansion of the child tax credit—is ex-
pected to cut child poverty in half. 
The story of the first 100 days is 
about shots going into arms, checks 
going into pockets, and life finally re-
turning to normal. The story of the 
first 100 days is about the country 
turning a corner and seeing some hope 
on the horizon. More broadly, the first 
100 days of this administration and this 
Congress have proven two things: one, 
that the government can work for the 
American people; and, two, that the 
Senate can legislate. 
The last few decades have brought 
faith in our government to alltime 
lows. You don’t have to look very far 
in the past to find surveys about how 
Congress has been less popular than 
traffic jams, root canals, and Genghis 
Khan. Faith in our democracy and 
trust in our elections were brought to 
new lows by the persistent and menda-
cious lies by the former President, cul-
minating in an armed insurrection here 
in the Capitol. 
Part of our mission here in Congress, 
in working with the Biden administra-
tion, is to restore Americans’ faith in 
our institutions and Americans’ faith 
in our government. Through the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan and the successful 
roll-out of the vaccine, we are slowly 
proving to the American people that 
government can work for them. 
So we have a long way to go, but in 
the first hundred days, this new Con-
gress has made an important downpay-
ment. Congressional approval is now 
the highest it has been since June of 
2009. 
Here in the Senate, the first hundred 
days have shown that this Chamber can 
legislate. Bipartisan work on the anti- 
Asian hates crime bill, the water bill 
this week, and hopefully an American 
competitiveness bill in the coming 
weeks proves that there are still many 
issues that unite Republicans and 
Democrats. Of course, our two parties 
are not always going to agree. In those 
instances, the Senate must still make 
progress on the challenges of our time. 
We did that through the American Res-
cue Plan. 
So in the first hundred days, the Sen-
ate has accomplished a lot more than 
most observers might have predicted. 
The next hundred days will bring more 
of the same.

JOHN KERRY 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, I 
rise today on the Senate floor to call 
for the resignation of John Kerry as a 
member of the Biden administration’s 
National Security Council. 
Now, I don’t do this lightly. As a 
matter of fact, in my entire time in the 
Senate, I have never called for any-
one’s 
resignation—Obama-Biden 
ad-
ministration, Trump administration, 
Biden administration now. I have been 
tempted, particularly when some in 
government have tried to hurt my 
State. A lot of that is going on right 
now with the Biden administration. 
But his record—John Kerry’s record— 
of undermining working families and 
working against American national se-
curity interests is too much to bear. He 
needs to go. 
Today, I have heard such disturbing 
news that, if true, it should absolutely 
result in the call of John Kerry either 
being fired or resigning. Enough is 
enough. Why am I saying this? First, 
he is killing jobs, arrogantly killing 
American jobs. That is a fact. He is 
putting hard-working Americans, par-
ticularly in the energy sector—the 
great men and women who make our 
country strong by developing oil and 
gas resources; a lot of my constitu-
ents—in the name of climate goals, he 
is putting them out of work. He is 
going to Wall Street, saying: Don’t fi-
nance these projects anymore. That is 
what reporters are saying. 
On these issues, I completely and 
adamantly disagree with the arrogant 
way—frankly, callous way—he says: 
Hey, people need to move on to better 
jobs. But for this issue alone, I 
wouldn’t be calling for his resignation. 
This is a major difference in the Biden 
administration’s policies and priorities 
with regard to the American people. I 
think it is going to really come back 
and hit this administration hard be-
cause the vast majority of Americans 
don’t agree with putting people out of 
work, energy workers out of work dur-
ing a recession and pandemic, but that

S2192 
April 26, 2021 
is going to be decided in the voting box 
in the elections. The American people 
will ultimately decide whether arro-
gantly putting thousands and thou-
sands of energy workers out of work 
right now is a good idea. 
In the name of these climate goals, 
he has also been a strong appeaser of 
countries that threaten ours. 
Let me take you back to 2015. I was 
a brandnew U.S. Senator. President 
Obama and President Xi Jinping are 
meeting in the Rose Garden. 
President Xi Jinping from China tells 
the President of the United States and 
the American people: No, we are not 
going to militarize the South China 
Sea. We won’t do it. 
Of course, the Chinese Communist 
Party was not telling the truth to the 
President of the United States and the 
American people. They started to do 
this already, militarizing one of the 
most important sea routes in the 
world. 
Many of us here in the Senate, Demo-
crats and Republicans, said: We need to 
stand up for our interests. We need the 
U.S. Navy to do freedom of navigation 
operations. 
The Secretary of Defense wanted to 
do this. The admiral in charge of the 
INDOPACOM area of responsibility 
wanted to do this. But we now know, in 
principals’ meetings, we delayed doing 
this for almost 3 years because John 
Kerry said: We don’t want to get the 
Chinese mad, or they will go back on 
their Paris climate deal and commit-
ments—which, by the way, are way out 
in the future. 
This is true. This is true. This hap-
pened. Again, in my view, this bordered 
on treacherous but not treasonous. I 
didn’t call for his resignation then. I 
was mad about it. By the way, a lot of 
people in the Obama administration 
were mad about this, including the 
Secretary of Defense. We lost a lot of 
time. 
It certainly makes me nervous that 
John Kerry is out in Beijing again. 
What kind of deal did he cut this time 
with China, the Communist Party of 
China, which won’t keep any commit-
ments? But, again, that wasn’t a call 
for resignation. 
The straw that broke the camel’s 
back came out today, and it is the rea-
son I am up here calling for John Kerry 
to resign. It is a tape that was leaked 
of an interview with Iran’s Foreign 
Minister, Mohammad Zarif. 
First, some background. Zarif was 
being interviewed by an economist and 
journalist who is an adviser to Moham-
mad Khatami, the pro-reform cleric 
who served two terms as Iran’s Presi-
dent. An edited version was intended to 
be public of this interview only after 
Iran’s current President left office in 
August, but it was leaked. 
Zarif, according to reports, says 
many interesting and telling things in 
the tape, one, for example, that, in my 
view, the rightful killing of General 
Soleimani, the Quds Force commander, 
in January of 2020 when he was in Iraq 
looking to kill more American sol-
diers—Zarif said this ‘‘was a major 
blow to Iran, more damaging than if it 
had wiped out an entire city in an at-
tack’’—that was what a lot of us were 
arguing at the time—and that unlike 
what John Kerry had been telling the 
public when negotiating the Iran nu-
clear deal in the Obama administra-
tion, it is the Revolutionary Guard 
Corps, the Quds Force, not Zarif, who 
calls the shots in Iran. That is all on 
the tapes. 
But the most disturbing part of the 
interview that was leaked was when 
Zarif said that John Kerry told him, 
the Iranian Foreign Minister, about 
covert Israeli actions against Iranian 
interests in Syria. Now think about 
that. According to news reports, Zarif 
is heard as saying: 
It was former U.S. Foreign Secretary John 
Kerry who told me Israel had launched more 
than 200 attacks on Iranian forces in Syria. 
That is Zarif saying John Kerry told 
him that, classified information about 
one of our most important allies in the 
world, Israel. 
Zarif said that he ‘‘listened to this 
information [from Secretary Kerry] in 
astonishment.’’ 
Now, when I read this today, I was 
astonished as well, that a former Sec-
retary of State, now a member of 
President Biden’s National Security 
Council—who 
wasn’t 
confirmed 
for 
that, by the way, by this body—would 
reveal the secrets of one of our most 
important and enduring allies in the 
region to an avowed enemy and the 
largest state sponsor of terrorism, a 
country that was responsible for the 
killing and wounding and maiming of 
thousands of American service men and 
women, whose leaders have the blood of 
American soldiers on their hands. He is 
telling them that information. 
It is unclear why John Kerry would 
relay such information to the leaders 
of the largest state sponsor of ter-
rorism in the world, but here is a 
guess: During the Trump administra-
tion, after that administration pulled 
out of the JCPOA, the Iran nuclear 
deal, which John Kerry negotiated— 
and by the way, a bipartisan majority 
of U.S. Senators in this body were 
against that deal—John Kerry started 
to freelance. He admitted to meeting 
with Zarif in 2018 to try to salvage the 
nuclear deal. In other words, he was 
likely acting and working against the 
previous administration, the elected 
administration, the Trump administra-
tion, and many of us here in Congress 
who applauded when we pulled out of 
the JCPOA. 
Madam President, I would ask unani-
mous consent to have printed in the 
RECORD an article written today by the 
National Review titled ‘‘John Kerry, 
Enemy of Israel.’’ 
There being no objection, the material was 
ordered to be printed in the RECORD, as fol-
lows: 
JOHN KERRY, ENEMY OF ISRAEL 
(By David Harsanyi) 
We know now that former secretary of 
state John Kerry isn’t merely a critic of 
Israel; he is an adversary. In leaked audio-
tapes obtained by the U.K.-based Iran Inter-
national, as reported by the New York 
Times, Iranian foreign minister Mohammad 
Javad Zarif told a supporter that the former 
secretary of state had informed him about 
‘‘at least’’ 200 covert Israeli actions against 
Iranian interests in Syria. Zarif listened to 
this information in ‘‘astonishment.’’ 
It’s predictable, perhaps, that the Times 
glides over this remarkable exchange in a 
single-sentence paragraph that is submerged 
near the bottom of the piece. (I guess it’s 
better than the Washington Post, which 
doesn’t even mention the interaction.) 
A high-ranking American official feels 
comfortable sharing this information with 
an 
autocratic 
adversary—a 
government 
that’s murdered hundreds of Americans, reg-
ularly kidnapped them, interfered with our 
elections, and propped up a regime that gas-
ses its people—about the covert actions of a 
long-time American ally. What else did he 
tell Zarif? The Times doesn’t say. 
It wouldn’t be surprising if Israel was more 
reluctant to share intel with the United 
States when Democrats such as Kerry show 
more fondness for those making genocidal 
threats against the Jewish people than they 
do for the state that protects them. It’s 
worth remembering that others like Senator 
Chris Murphy (who is now ‘‘requesting a 
classified briefing’’ on the Natanz incident, 
in which Israel likely sabotaged a nuclear fa-
cility) also secretly met with Zarif in Mu-
nich in a coordinated effort to undercut the 
Trump administration’s efforts to derail 
Iran’s ongoing nuclear-weapons program—an 
incident that comports far more closely with 
the definition of ‘‘collusion’’ than anything 
turned up against Trump officials. We have 
no idea what Murphy discussed with Zarif, 
either. 
We do know that after the assassination of 
Qasem 
Soleimani—head 
of 
the 
Revolu-
tionary Guard’s Quds Force and the terror 
group behind the death of over 600 American 
servicemen and thousands of others—Kerry 
and Murphy were among the many people 
scaremongering over a ‘‘massive regional 
war’’ that never materialized. In his leaked 
conversation, Zarif says of Soleimani that 
‘‘by assassinating him in Iraq, the United 
States delivered a major blow to Iran, more 
damaging than if it had wiped out an entire 
city in an attack.’’ 
As the Trump years proved, there are a 
number of options available as we wait for 
the Iranian regime to come to its senses or, 
hopefully, crumble, including maximum eco-
nomic pressure and sabotage. Last week. 
Israel reportedly blew up Iran’s Natanz nu-
clear facility’s electrical substation, located 
40 to 50 meters underground, damaging 
‘‘thousands of centrifuges.’’ This is likely 
the second time in the past few months that 
the Israelis have been able to smuggle explo-
sives into the facility and detonate them re-
motely. Of course, this incident is only one 
in a long line of unexplained fires, assassina-
tions, and computer worms that have caused 
substantial delays and damage to the illegal 
Iranian nuclear-weapons program. All of 
these efforts have likely saved lives by de-
laying the ability of Iran to become another 
North Korea—or worse, since Iran exports 
terror all over the world. 
During the Obama years, Democrats would 
offer an ugly false choice: You either support 
diplomacy with the ‘‘moderate’’ wing of the 
theocratic state, or you endorse ‘‘war’’; ei-
ther fly unmarked euros in tonnage and bail 
out the Mullahs, or plunge America into an-
other Iraq War. At one point, Obama claimed 
that the Republican caucus was making 
‘‘common cause’’ with Iranian hard-liners. 
The opposite was true. In the leaked audio 
from Zarif, we hear that the military and

April 26, 2021 
theocratic forces in the nation ‘‘call the 
shots’’ and overrule ‘‘government decisions 
and ignoring advice.’’ According to the 
Times, Zarif says that the political wing is 
‘‘severely constricted’’ and decisions ‘‘are 
dictated by the supreme leader or Revolu-
tionary Guards Corps.’’ Obama’s contention 
that the Iran deal was being forged with the 
‘‘moderate faction’’ was always a fantasy. 
The real moderates in Iran were forsaken 
by Obama and Biden when they decided that 
the United States wouldn’t support the 2009 
Green Movement, in what Soviet dissident 
Natan Sharansky called one of the biggest 
failures of human rights in modern history. 
Democrats Murphy, Biden, and Kerry are 
more interested in ensuring Iran becomes a 
regional counterforce to Israeli power. 
Whatever you believe about the Joint Com-
prehensive 
Plan 
of 
Action, 
or 
Biden’s 
iteration of the deal, it should not have to be 
said that high-ranking United States offi-
cials shouldn’t be sharing sensitive informa-
tion about an ally with a terror regime. Yet 
it also seems quite likely that’s exactly what 
John Kerry did. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. The beginning of 
this article says: 
Let’s pause to reflect on how monu-
mentally stunning it is that the former U.S. 
secretary of state allegedly tattled on Israel 
to Iran. 
It goes on to say: A high-ranking 
American official would feel com-
fortable sharing this kind of classified 
information ‘‘with an autocratic adver-
sary—a government that’s murdered 
hundreds of Americans, regularly kid-
napped them, interfered with our elec-
tions, and propped up a regime that 
gasses its people—about the covert ac-
tions of a long-time critical American 
ally.’’ 
What else did Kerry tell Zarif, this 
article asks? Press reports don’t say, 
but if this is true, if John Kerry told 
Iran—the leaders of Iran—about issues 
relating to our most critical ally in the 
region, Israel, which Iran has repeat-
edly said they want to wipe Israel off 
the face of the Earth, if he did this, he 
needs to resign. If he did this with the 
intent of undermining the current 
President of the United States at the 
time, President Trump, and the Mem-
bers of this body, he needs to resign. 
He is a member of the current admin-
istration’s National Security Council. 
It has become clear that our adver-
saries, whether Beijing or Iran, like it 
when John Kerry is in charge of foreign 
policy and national security. Why? Be-
cause they know how to use him to 
their advantage. And our allies fear 
him. Why? Because they know his judg-
ment is off on so many issues. So, too, 
do America’s working families. 
We need to look into this. If this is 
true—if this is true—I certainly hope 
other Members of this body, Democrats 
and Republicans, will join me in call-
ing for the resignation of John Kerry. 
Enough is enough. The redline that was 
crossed, if this is true, revealing secret 
information to one of America’s most 
sworn enemies, with the blood of thou-
sands of American military members 
on its hands, undermining the interests 
of one of our most important allies, the 
State of Israel, if this is true, John 
Kerry needs to go. He should resign or 
he should get fired by the President of 
the United States. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. TUBERVILLE. Madam Presi-

I think everybody, including the Pre-
siding Officer, can agree that we need 
to secure our country. We need to be 
safe. Our citizens need to feel safe. Our 
job as elected officials is to make sure 
that those who have stepped up to de-
fend our country have the resources 
they need to do their job and do it safe-
ly. 
The President’s recent budget pro-
posal for the Defense Department does 
not, and I repeat, does not give our 
men and women in uniform the tools to 
do their job properly. It is clear that 
President Biden thinks we don’t need 
further investment in our military. It 
is clear he thinks it is OK to ask our 
men and women to do more with less, 
and that is impossible. This should 
alarm the Members of this body and all 
American people. 
The world has changed a lot in 50 
years. When President Biden first came 
to Washington in 1972, there were two 
superpowers: the United States and the 
Soviet Union. Back then, we spent 6.5 
percent of our Federal budget on na-
tional defense—6.5. Today, we spend 
less than 3.5. 
In 2021, we are facing different but 
very, very serious threats. Secretary 
Austin has said that China remains the 
top ‘‘pacing threat’’ for our military. It 
is much, much more than that. China 
isn’t just trying to dominate Asia and 
its neighbors; they are trying to domi-
nate much of the world through its 
growing military and economic influ-
ence. Simply keeping pace with China 
is not enough. 
We have got to outpace all of our ad-
versaries, 
but 
doing 
that 
requires 
smart, substantial, and strategic in-
vestments in our military—much more 
investment than the President and 
many people here in Congress publicly 
propose. 
Let me walk through some of the 
ways that a supposedly flat defense 
budget hurts our national security. 
President Biden says he wants his ad-
ministration to trust the experts on 
things like COVID, but this defense 
budget shows he doesn’t apply the 
same principle to the Pentagon. Unlike 
the President and some of my Demo-
cratic colleagues, I think we should 
take seriously the advice of our com-
manding generals, for they are the ex-
perts in this purview. 
Here is what ADM Charles Richard, 
commander of U.S. Strategic Com-
mand, who is over our nuclear capabili-
ties, said in last week’s hearing to the 
Senate Armed Services Committee: 
I have what I need today to deter. . . . but 
I need it modernized. . . . There’s no remain-
ing margin. 
His warning is clear. We must mod-
ernize our greatest deterrent and keep 
peace among our adversaries with our 
nuclear arsenal. That means updating 
all three legs of the nuclear triad: sub-
marines, bombers, and intercontinental 
ballistic missiles. It is necessary to do 
so, and it is also possible. As former 
Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said, 
‘‘America can afford survival.’’ 
The Russians have made modernizing 
their nuclear arsenal a priority. The 
Chinese have made growing their nu-
clear stockpile a matter of national 
pride. But the United States? Each day 
we rely on nuclear weapons that, in 
many cases, were designed by an ana-
log mechanical computer. The free 
world, meaning the United States, 
works and sleeps under a nuclear um-
brella that hasn’t been updated to the 
digital age. 
Meanwhile, the Chinese are fielding 
hypersonic missiles, which are missiles 
that go into space and then return to 
their target. Ours are still on the draw-
ing board. 
China’s arsenal of ground-based and 
medium-range missiles continues to 
grow. They are pointed right at our 
forces in the Pacific and our allies in 
the region. We need investment to 
maintain our missile defense systems 
so we can protect our people and deter 
the Chinese from attacking our allies. 
We are also in a new space race, and 
it is a race we must win. Americans 
may not realize how much we rely on 
space for our daily lives. Our satellites 
allow us to get GPS for our phones or 
even watch football games on tele-
vision, 
but 
the 
Chinese 
want 
to 
weaponize this new frontier of war, and 
we are falling way behind. 
Right now, the Chinese have set up 
satellites over Taiwan as they continue 
to ramp up their threats on this demo-
cratic neighbor. It is unbelievable. I 
heard about the growing gap between 
us and the Chinese when I visited Army 
Materiel Command at Redstone Arse-
nal a few weeks ago in Huntsville. 
These folks shared with me how des-
perate we need to modernize our space- 
based systems that contribute to our 
missile defense. 
The U.S. Army is the largest con-
sumer of space products, and our mili-
tary relies on Materiel Command to 
provide the resources to train our sol-
diers for research, development of new 
equipment, and defend our Nation. 
They should not have to beg the Presi-
dent of the United States for the 
money to invest in the capabilities 
that we need. 
The United States must ensure se-
cure and reliable access to space. Our 
budget needs to demonstrate commit-
ment to defending our existing space 
assets and developing new technologies 
so we can win this next theater of con-
flict. We also need to invest in the safe-
ty of our service men and women, espe-
cially in aviation. Currently, the aver-
age age of an airplane in our military 
is older than the pilots flying them— 
older.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2194 
April 26, 2021 
Aviation Safety, the military had more 
than 6,000 noncombat aviation acci-
dents since 2013, destroying 157 air-
craft, at a cost of $9.41 billion. Even 
worse was the human cost. There are 
198 souls that have been lost in these 
tragic accidents, affecting hundreds 
more spouses, children, family, and 
friends. 
When asked why these causes oc-
curred, servicemembers pointed to in-
adequate 
training 
programs, 
risky 
maintenance 
practices, 
and 
spotty 
funding, among other reasons. Ala-
bama is home to Fort Rucker, where 
every Army helicopter pilot comes to 
get their training. When I visited the 
folks at Fort Rucker, they told me 
about the very real need for increased 
flight training hours for our pilots, 
which requires more investment and 
prioritization in the defense budget. 
This last week, two pilots were in-
jured in a helicopter crash at Fort 
Rucker during flight training. I am 
sure General Francis and the U.S. 
Army safety center will do a thorough 
investigation and provide feedback on 
the improvements needed to ensure 
that this does not happen again. The 
safety of our flight program must be a 
top priority. We must listen to our men 
and women in uniform and invest in 
the proper training and safety meas-
ures that will prevent these crashes. 
Alabama stands ready to continue to 
build our military so we can maintain 
our status as a preeminent fighting 
force in the world. We have got hun-
dreds of contractors and more than 
200,000 employed in the defense sector 
across the State of Alabama. These 
topnotch men and women support our 
military 
installations 
from 
ship-
builders in Mobile to Redstone Arsenal 
in Huntsville, and many places in be-
tween. As Winston Churchill said, 
‘‘Give us the tools, and we will finish 
the job.’’ 
We are willing and able, but those 
tools require sustained funding from 
the Federal Government. Telling our 
forces to fight a war with outdated 
tools is like giving a football team 
some leather helmets and decades-old 
poorly fitted pads and expecting them 
to compete against modern equipment. 
But that is exactly what President 
Biden’s defense budget is asking our 
military to do. Frankly, it is a huge 
disappointment, coming from our Com-
mander in Chief. We cannot let our 
men and women down. 
Thankfully, it is Congress—not the 
President—which has the power of the 
purse. And, really, this should be our 
first order of business every year. It is 
that important. 
In the coming weeks, I will be work-
ing with my colleagues on the National 
Defense Authorization Act and budget 
that will enable our military to do the 
job better today and prepare for all the 
challenges tomorrow. This debate is ul-
timately about whether or not we have 
the willpower to fight to defend our 
way of life and our great country. 
Well, I am willing to keep fighting 
for the United States by investing in 
the men and women who keep us safe. 
I urge my colleagues and President 
Biden to do the same. 
REMEMBERING CURTIS T. SPROUSE 
Madam President, finally, I want to 
take a moment to honor the life of a 
great person in Alabama, a war vet-
eran—Curtis T. Sprouse. 
Mr. Sprouse joined the U.S. Army in 
1943 at the age of 17. He served in the 
318th Infantry Regiment under General 
George Patton in the European the-
ater, including the Battle of the Bulge. 
For his bravery, he earned the Bronze 
Star, Purple Heart, and Good Conduct 
Medal, among other honors. 
He passed away in Dothan, AL, last 
week at the age of 98. 
A year ago, I visited with Mr. 
Sprouse at a restaurant in Dothan, and 
we sat at a table known locally as the 
‘‘table of knowledge.’’ It is where locals 
have sat and talked for decades, where 
people are said to solve the world’s 
problems with conversation. That day, 
Mr. Sprouse and I talked about his 
service, and I talked to him about my 
father’s time, who at the same age 
today would be 98. We talked about 
World War II. We didn’t end up solving 
the world’s problems, but we did talk 
about how to humbly, graciously, and 
patriotically serve our great country. 
Mr. Sprouse was a humble man, but 
it was men like him who defended our 
country and the world from evil. And, 
ultimately, they prevailed. We owe Mr. 
Sprouse a debt of gratitude we can 
never fully repay. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arkansas. 
TEACHER APPRECIATION WEEK 
Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, I 
rise today to recognize the extraor-
dinary work of the teachers in Arkan-
sas and across the country. 
As we prepare to celebrate Teacher 
Appreciation Week, it is clear that edu-
cators are in a class by themselves 
when it comes to resilience. Over the 
last 12 months, they have shown us 
what it means to be selfless and brave 
at a time when both were critically 
necessary. 
I am especially proud of teachers in 
Arkansas who rose to the challenge of 
leading classes 100 percent virtually for 
the first time and then embraced re-
opening our schools in August 2020. The 
sudden transition to virtual learning 
was an extraordinary hurdle, as edu-
cators had to learn new technology and 
new teaching techniques overnight. 
For all of us who have learned to use 
Zoom, it is worth taking a moment to 
imagine an online classroom with 30 
wiggling first graders who want to 
show you their pets, or that you are 
teaching calculus to high school stu-
dents who are preparing for an AP 
exam while attending class from their 
car at a Wi-Fi hotspot. Somehow, with 
great creativity and dedication, teach-
ers embraced this mission and contin-
ued to do everything they could to 
reach each child. 
When Arkansas schools reopened in 
the fall, they were faced with a tremen-
dous new challenge, from masks and 
social distancing to teaching classes, 
where some students were at their 
desks and others were on the screen. 
Arkansas teachers, once again, did the 
impossible for their students. 
Over the last year, I have heard from 
educators who worried for their own 
health and safety but said their dedica-
tion to their students was stronger 
than fear. They learned new skills lit-
erally overnight, overhauled the cur-
riculum, and reimagined every aspect 
of their classroom to comply with 
COVID–19 guidelines. Somehow, they 
also made our kids feel safe—safe 
enough to learn, set an example with 
their positive attitudes, and let stu-
dents know how important they were, 
whether in the classroom or on a com-
puter screen. 
As they worked to maintain the aca-
demic progress of each child, they also 
provided a lifeline in an otherwise cha-
otic time. It is amazing to see the 
smiles on faces of the kids when they 
see their teachers. Even though noth-
ing was normal, they gave students an 
escape back to normalcy by being there 
and continuing to do what they do 
best—teach. 
When we look back at the heroes of 
this tumultuous time, it is clear that 
teachers will be among those we honor 
as society’s most valuable players. 
On behalf of the people of Arkansas, 
I want to thank our teachers for the 
great work that they have done this 
year and every year to bring out the 
best in each child and pave the way to 
a brighter future. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that the 
order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
FOR THE PEOPLE ACT OF 2021 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, we are less than 100 days into the 
Biden administration, and already we 
can identify a pattern in how they are 
building their policy initiatives, inter-
acting with Congress, and marketing 
their ideas to the American people. In 
every example, the governing rule can 
be boiled down to ‘‘what you see isn’t 
what you are going to get.’’ 
So far, in this 117th Congress, every 
single major policy proposal that DC 
Democrats have forced into the spot-
light has been based on a false premise. 
They have intentionally misled the 
American people and are now catering 
to the increasingly radical leftwing 
that gets further out of step with the 
rest of this country each and every 
passing day. 
Consider last month’s absurd $1.9 
trillion spending package. The Demo-
crats billed this as ‘‘the American Res-
cue Plan’’ and ‘‘COVID relief,’’ but 
only 9 percent—9 percent—of the total 
package pricetag went for testing, vac-
cinations, and healthcare jobs. The rest

S2195 
April 26, 2021 
they used on a massive blue State bail-
out 
and 
blatant 
redistribution 
of 
wealth. 
It is the same story with this 
month’s $2.25 trillion spending pack-
age. They have done their best to pass 
this off as an ‘‘infrastructure plan,’’ 
but even if you add up every single line 
item 
that 
is 
dedicated 
to 
roads, 
bridges, highways, interstates, ports, 
waterways, airports, broadband, and 
the power grid, only a little over one- 
third of that plan will pay for actual 
infrastructure projects. The rest—the 
rest—of that $2.25 trillion is just an-
other slush fund for union activism, 
climate change auditors, and Green 
New Deal fantasies. 
S. 1, the so-called ‘‘voting rights’’ bill 
that my colleagues across the aisle 
have spoken so passionately about, 
completes the trifecta of bait-and- 
switch bills, advertised as one thing 
but that would accomplish something 
completely different. 
Now, S. 1 isn’t as much a taxpayer- 
dollar grab as it is a nearly unprece-
dented policy power grab that offers so-
lutions in search of problems. It ig-
nores the promises of federalism. It dis-
regards the constitutional directive af-
fording States—affording the States— 
power over their own elections. 
It requires the use of ballot casting 
technology and voter registration sys-
tems that don’t even exist yet, but I 
think you can bet that some politically 
connected 
companies 
will 
make 
a 
whole bunch of money coming to the 
market with this technology. 
It would dismantle voter ID laws and 
prevent local, meaningful cleanup of 
voter rolls. Your local election com-
mission wouldn’t be able to purge their 
rolls of individuals who have died or 
moved away. We know that this leads 
you to a recipe for fraud. 
Speaking of fraud, it would force 
States to allow ballot harvesting. That 
is right; it would mandate that they 
allow ballot harvesting. Everyone has 
heard of the perils that exist with bal-
lot harvesting. It would mandate donor 
disclosure, opening private citizens up 
to harassment and violent attacks. It 
would upend the mechanics of local 
elections for officials and voters alike 
and cause chaos and confusion in every 
precinct in this country. 
So why in the world would Demo-
crats even try to pitch this mess as 
something that would protect voting 
rights? By all accounts, it would in-
crease the likelihood for fraud and con-
fusion. Well, I think that they are 
doing it for the same reason they 
slapped a ‘‘COVID’’ label on a $1.9 tril-
lion wish list and an ‘‘infrastructure’’ 
label on a $2.25 trillion wish list. They 
know that if the American people 
caught on to all that they are doing, 
they would never win another election. 
Now, think about that—if you know 
your policies are so unpopular with the 
American people that you have to 
cloak them behind different words, dif-
ferent phrases, words that the meaning 
of the word is evolving because they 
don’t stand up to scrutiny in the light 
of day. And that is what is happening. 
You know, it isn’t just false adver-
tising. It is not a falsehood. It is not 
misrepresentation. It is not an inaccu-
racy. It is not an accidental lie. This is 
an intentional lie. They are perpe-
trating this lie on behalf of a radical 
leftist minority of Americans whose 
ideas are so destructive that they 
wouldn’t withstand 10 minutes of good, 
solid, robust, respectful bipartisan de-
bate on this Senate floor. 
Nothing about S. 1 will serve the best 
interests of the American people, and 
my Republican colleagues and I aren’t 
the only ones who see the problems 
with it. Tennesseeans are worried 
about this, too, because, in Tennessee, 
we did the work to clean up our voter 
rolls and implement fair voter ID laws. 
We cut down on fraud and increased 
faith in the electoral process. 
This is how it is supposed to work. 
We do not need Federal intervention to 
protect the vote. So no wonder my 
Democratic colleagues chose to use the 
full weight of the Senate Judiciary 
Committee to scare the American peo-
ple into believing they live in ‘‘Jim 
Crow America.’’ Throughout the course 
of last week’s hearing, which they 
called ‘‘Jim Crow 2021: The Latest As-
sault on the Right to Vote,’’ they 
weaponized the pernicious lens of crit-
ical race theory against Georgia legis-
lators and the thousands of election of-
ficials and volunteers who work year- 
round to bring as many eligible voters 
to the polls as possible. 
Everyone should exercise their right 
to vote. We should protect one person, 
one vote. We should encourage people 
in our local communities to cast their 
ballot. But my friends across the aisle, 
they are desperate, and they are des-
perate to distract from what S. 1 would 
actually do, so desperate to distract 
from what it would actually do that 
they are willing to project the evil ha-
tred behind slavery, segregation, and 
race-based violence, projecting that 
onto people whose only goal is to pro-
tect the vote from criminals who would 
seek to defraud it and make certain 
that individuals are registered to vote, 
that they vote, and that legal votes are 
counted and those improperly cast are 
not. 
Now, my friends across the aisle have 
an invalid premise, and they should all 
pause and question their motives. The 
American people should be worried 
about what is happening in this Cham-
ber when no one is looking. They 
should feel outrage at an administra-
tion that deliberately tries to manipu-
late them into supporting destructive, 
wasteful, and dangerous legislation. 
I think these bait-and-switch tactics 
are going to backfire. I think the scare 
tactics are going to backfire because 
instead of being scared into submis-
sion, which is the agenda of the left, 
the American people are going to be 
scared into action. 
Based on the contents of H.R. 1 and 
S. 1, I guess that they are more famil-
iar with the ins and outs of their neigh-
borhood polling places than DC Demo-
crats could ever expect to be. And that 
doesn’t bode well for the administra-
tion or the current congressional ma-
jority. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

CONFIRMATION OF DEANNE BENNETT CRISWELL 
Mr. PETERS. Madam President, I 
rise to recognize a historic confirma-
tion that took place last week. On 
Thursday, 
the 
Senate 
confirmed 
Deanne Criswell to serve as the Admin-
istrator of the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency. I would like to 
thank Senator PORTMAN for his support 
and for working closely with me to see 
that Ms. Criswell was swiftly con-
firmed for this critical position. 
Ms. Criswell is an experienced, crisis- 
tested leader, well deserving of the 
unanimous bipartisan support that her 
confirmation received. As she takes the 
helm of FEMA, Ms. Criswell brings 
more than 25 years of emergency man-
agement and disaster response experi-
ence at the Federal, State, and local 
level. 
Having served as an emergency man-
agement commissioner for one of the 
largest and most diverse cities in 
America, Ms. Criswell knows what it 
takes to ensure the coronavirus vac-
cination distribution is efficient and 
effective and that every community 
has the resources that they need to re-
cover from this pandemic. 
As a former member of the National 
Guard and a firefighter, she under-
stands the needs of our heroic first re-
sponders as they continuously protect 
Americans on the frontlines. 
However, the pandemic is just one of 
many challenges that FEMA faces, and 
Ms. Criswell understands that there is 
no one-size-fits-all approach to disaster 
response and every crisis, from hurri-
canes to historic flooding and wildfires, 
to the COVID–19 pandemic, requires a 
coordinated strategy. 
There is no doubt that Ms. Criswell’s 
experience in emergency management, 
extensive record of tackling crises on a 
local and national level, and the desire 
to work on a bipartisan basis to im-
prove our Federal disaster response in 
every community are exactly what is 
needed to meet the challenges that we 
are facing now and those challenges 
that lie ahead.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2196 
April 26, 2021 
Jason Scott Miller, the President’s 
nominee to be Deputy Director for 
Management at the Office of Manage-
ment and Budget. 
Mr. Miller is a proven leader who is 
committed to getting results for the 
American people. He has an extensive 
track record of tackling difficult man-
agement challenges and driving inno-
vation, both in the government and in 
the private sector. 
Early in his career, as a management 
consultant, Mr. Miller advised large 
companies with operations across the 
globe, helping them tackle strategic 
and operational challenges. As Deputy 
Director of the National Economic 
Council from 2011 to 2017, Mr. Miller 
spearheaded many governmentwide ini-
tiatives, including the creation of Man-
ufacturing 
USA 
institutes 
and 
SelectUSA—new efforts to spur job cre-
ation by strengthening manufacturing 
and bringing investment to the United 
States. 
He was also instrumental in driving 
the passage of bipartisan legislation in 
2016 to address the crisis in Puerto 
Rico and in developing the first-ever 
Federal policy on automated vehicles. 
OMB is and will continue to be cen-
tral to the administration’s efforts to 
combat the pandemic and spur eco-
nomic recovery in communities all 
across our Nation. 
Mr. Miller’s experience taking on a 
diverse range of challenges and his 
commitment to getting results have 
prepared him well to serve as OMB’s 
Deputy Director for Management. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
supporting the confirmation of Jason 
Scott Miller as Deputy Director for 
Management at OMB.

250TH ANNIVERSARY OF WINSLOW, 
MAINE 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to commemorate the 250th birth-
day of the town of Winslow, ME. Wins-
low is a town with a fascinating his-
tory and a bright future, connected by 
generations of hard-working and caring 
people. 
Winslow was incorporated in 1771, but 
its story began long before. For thou-
sands of years, the land along the great 
Kennebec River was the home of the 
Abenaki Tribe, who hunted, fished, and 
tilled the fertile soil. The reverence the 
Abenaki had for the natural beauty 
and resources of the region is upheld by 
the people of Winslow today. 
Winslow’s roots run deep into Amer-
ican history. It originally was a Native 
American settlement called Taconock, 
meaning ‘‘in the trees.’’ Located in 
central Maine along the mighty Ken-
nebec River, the village was settled by 
colonists from Plymouth Colony. 
Winslow is home to important histor-
ical sites. One of those sites, Fort Hali-
fax, the oldest blockhouse in the 
United States, was constructed by the 
town’s namesake, General John Wins-
low, in 1754 and named after the Earl of 
Halifax, Secretary of State of Great 
Britain. Fort Halifax was designated as 
a National Historic Landmark in 1968. 
Today, visitors and residents enjoy 
this historic site at what is now Fort 
Halifax Park. This land was once home 
to industrial and commercial use after 
a railroad line was built in the 1840s to 
transport goods from local mills. Years 
later, the site was developed into a 
park which is now enjoyed for recre-
ation, picnics, and holiday festivities. 
Winslow’s Ticonic Footbridge, known 
by locals as the Two Cent Bridge, is 
one of the oldest footbridges and the 
last known toll footbridge in the 
United States. The bridge, built in 1903, 
connects the two communities of Wins-
low and Waterville. For several genera-
tions, residents of Winslow crossed the 
bridge daily to work at the Waterville 
mills. 
Winslow honors the men and women 
who defend our freedom. Central Maine 
Veterans 
Memorial 
Park 
was 
the 
dream of a group of veterans led by 
WWII Navy veteran Daniel DeRoch. 
With the collaboration of town offi-
cials, schools, residents, and veterans 
organizations, this park pays tribute to 
all who served in the U.S. Army, Ma-
rine Corps, Navy, Air Force, Coast 
Guard, National Guard, and Merchant 
Marine. 
Mr. President, Winslow has played an 
important role in Maine history, and it 
continues to exemplify the best of our 
great State today. I congratulate to 
the people of Winslow on this landmark 
anniversary and wish them all the best 
in the years to come.

250TH ANNIVERSARY OF 
WINTHROP, MAINE 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to commemorate the 250th birth-
day of the town of Winthrop, ME. This 
landmark anniversary is a time to cel-
ebrate the generations of hard-working 
and caring people who have made it

such a wonderful place to live, work, 
and raise families. 
Originally known as Pondtown Plan-
tation, Winthrop was home to the 
Abenaki, who thrived along its many 
lakes and ponds. Those same lakes and 
ponds would propel Winthrop through-
out history, including the historic Win-
throp Mills Company’s woolen textile 
mill, and serve as a beautiful backdrop 
for recreation. 
Winthrop’s roots run deep into Amer-
ican history. BG Henry Clay Wood, who 
played a key role in the Battle of Wil-
son’s Creek in Missouri during the 
Civil War, was born in Winthrop. The 
philanthropist Charles M. Bailey was 
also a resident of Winthrop and was 
very generous to the town, adding to 
its rich history. Mr. Bailey donated the 
historic Bailey Public Library, con-
structed in 1916. 
Winthrop 
is 
also 
home 
to 
the 
Cobbossee Lighthouse. When it was 
constructed in 1908, it was the only in-
land lighthouse east of the Mississippi. 
Maine is known as Vacationland, and 
Winthrop fits perfectly into that pic-
ture. With all of the beautiful ponds 
and lakes, as well as the 807-foot Mount 
Pisgah, there is always something to 
do in Winthrop. The energy and plan-
ning going into the town’s 250th anni-
versary celebration demonstrates the 
pride the townspeople have in their 
town. 
Mr. President, Winthrop’s 250th year 
is a time to celebrate the people who, 
for longer than America has been a na-
tion, have pulled together, cared for 
one another, and built a great commu-
nity. It is a pleasure to offer my con-
gratulations and best wishes. 
ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING HALBERT 
SULLIVAN 
∑ Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I am sad-
dened by the passing of Hal Sullivan. 
He had a unique ability to bring to-
gether organizations and private sector 
partners to make sure clients of the 
Fathers & Families Support Center had 
the tools they needed to be successful. 
I appreciated learning what he was see-
ing and hearing, and hearing his advice 
over the years. His work touched the 
lives of so many families throughout 
the St. Louis region, and his legacy of 
service will have a lasting impact 
throughout our State for generations 
to come.∑

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2199 
April 26, 2021 
(1) as a result of the Coronavirus Disease 
2019 
(COVID–19) 
pandemic, 
more 
than 
40,000,000 people in the United States have 
filed claims for unemployment benefits since 
March 2020, which is a level of unemploy-
ment not seen since the Great Depression; 
(2) investments in fish, wildlife, and habi-
tat restoration and outdoor recreation infra-
structure generate as many as 33 jobs per 
$1,000,000 invested, as demonstrated by the 
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 
2009 (Public Law 111–5; 123 Stat. 115); 
(3) the outdoor recreation economy— 
(A) generates $887,000,000,000 in economic 
activity each year, which is 2.2 percent of 
the gross domestic product of the United 
States, according to the Bureau of Economic 
Analysis; and 
(B) was 1 of the fastest growing sectors of 
the United States economy before the 
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID–19) pan-
demic; 
(4) the demand for outdoor recreation has 
increased 
dramatically 
during 
the 
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID–19) pan-
demic; 
(5) the Federal Government and State and 
local governments and agencies have many 
‘‘shovel-ready’’ projects and green infra-
structure maintenance backlog projects that 
would— 
(A) improve the quality of life and outdoor 
experiences of people of the United States; 
(B) make communities, especially commu-
nities that are traditionally underserved, 
more resilient to climate change, natural 
disasters, and wildfires; and 
(C) provide access to outdoor recreation 
opportunities to all people of the United 
States; 
(6) many facilities and natural resources 
located on dedicated conservation land are 
in disrepair or degraded and in need of labor- 
intensive rehabilitation, restoration, and en-
hancement work that cannot be carried out 
at existing staffing levels; 
(7) enhancing and maintaining environ-
mentally and recreationally important land 
and waters through the participation of un-
employed individuals in the United States in 
a conservation corps could— 
(A) provide critical employment, edu-
cation, and skill development opportunities 
to the individuals; 
(B) prepare the individuals for permanent 
jobs in the conservation field; and 
(C) benefit the economy and environment 
of the United States; and 
(8) existing networks of conservation corps 
are in place but need additional resources in 
order to scale up the activities of the con-
servation corps to meet growing deferred 
maintenance needs on public land. 
(b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this Act 
are— 
(1) to employ, during the 5-year period be-
ginning on the date of enactment of this Act, 
a total of 1,000,000 people in the United 
States 
in 
dedicated 
conservation 
land 
projects to support the growing backlog of

HONORING THE SERVICE OF

Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the faithful service of John David 
Nugent as he retires from his role of nearly 25 
years as lead pastor at Hillcrest Baptist 
Church in Jasper, Texas. Under Pastor 
Nugent’s leadership, the Hillcrest family has 
grown tremendously from 617 to 1,632 church 
members. Pastor Nugent’s time at Hillcrest 
Baptist has also seen the construction and 
completion of a new campus for the church to 
call home. 
Prior to his time at Hillcrest, Pastor Nugent 
became licensed in ministry in 1973 and was 
ordained on September 16, 1979, at Central 
Baptist Church in Monroe, Louisiana, where 
he served as associate pastor from 1977 until 
1981. He would later go on to serve as pastor 
at First Baptist Church in Lone Pine, Lou-
isiana; New Zion Baptist Church in Oak 
Grove, Louisiana; and First Baptist Church in 
Spurger, Texas, before making the move to 
Jasper. 
Over the years, Pastor Nugent has held in-
fluential roles with the Sabine Valley Associa-
tion, New Bethel Association, Bayou Macon 
Association, and Louisiana Association. 
For nearly a half century, Pastor Nugent has 
been a steadfast servant of God and tirelessly 
devoted to furthering His kingdom. He has 
selflessly dedicated his time as pastor to im-
proving the lives of his congregants, strength-
ening his community, and spreading the word 
of the Lord to all who would listen. It is no 
wonder why he is held in high regard by all 
who know him. Madam Speaker, I honor and 
thank my friend, Pastor Nugent, for his years 
of dutiful service.

IN RECOGNITION OF MAYOR BOB 
GOLDEN 
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 26, 2021 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the outstanding contributions of 
Bob Golden to his community, state, and na-
tion. As the outgoing Mayor of Haslet, Texas, 
he has served in his current position with dis-
tinction since May 2009. As he retires from 
public life, it is my privilege to recognize his 
noteworthy accomplishments. 
Mayor Golden began a career in public 
service through his commissioning as a Navy 
Ensign following his graduation from the U.S. 
Naval Academy in 1966. During his active 
duty service, he flew F–4 Phantoms off the 
USS John F. Kennedy. After additional service 
in the Naval Reserve, he retired at the rank of 
captain in June 1996, whereupon he and his 
wife, Kathleen, moved to Haslet. 
Prior to his election mayor in May 2009, 
Mayor Golden served for several years on 
both the Haslet Planning and Zoning and 
Parks and Recreation boards. Under his may-
oral leadership, the economic tax base of 
Haslet was significantly expanded through the 
attraction, building, and operation of a 1.1 mil-
lion square-foot Amazon electronic order fulfill-
ment center. 
Mayor Golden has effectively also overseen 
the decade-long planning and development of 
critically necessary improvements to Haslet’s 
infrastructure, including the Haslet Parkway 
Project, which broadens a busy thoroughfare 
in the city into a four-lane divided highway 
along with augmented water and sewer lines. 
The project, which broke ground in March 
2021, is projected to drastically improve truck 
movements and future logistics operations at 
Alliance Airport. It is one of Mayor Golden’s 
most valuable contributions to Haslet, and the 
city’s citizens and businesses will positively 
benefit from the project’s fruition. 
As Bob Golden completes his final mayoral 
term, I am honored to recognize and thank 
him for his decades of selfless devotion as a 
dedicated public servant. Best wishes in all his 
future endeavors. 
INTRODUCTION OF THE NUCLEAR 
WEAPONS ABOLITION AND ECO-
NOMIC 
AND 
ENERGY 
CONVER-
SION ACT OF 2021 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 26, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the Nuclear Weapons Abolition and 
Economic and Energy Conversion Act of 
2021, a version of which I have introduced 
since 1994, after working with the District of 
Columbia residents who were responsible for 
the Nuclear Disarmament and Economic Con-
version ballot initiative passed by D.C. voters 
in 1993. My bill still requires the United States 
to sign and ratify an international agreement to 
disable and dismantle America’s nuclear 
weapons, to provide for strict control of fissile 
material and radioactive waste and to use nu-
clear-free energy. In lieu of joining such an 
agreement, this version of the bill also gives 
the United States the option to ratify the 
United Nations Treaty on the Prohibition of 
Nuclear Weapons (Treaty). Many nations have 
already signed the Treaty. The Treaty was 
drafted by the United Nations in conferences 
in March and July of 2017, which is why I did 
not include it in my previous bills. According to 
the United Nations, the Treaty is ‘‘a legally 
binding instrument to prohibit nuclear weap-
ons, leading towards their total elimination.’’ I 
am pleased by the international progress on 
this important issue. 
The bill continues to provide that the funds 
used for nuclear weapons be redirected to 
human and infrastructure needs, such as 
housing, health care, Social Security, restoring 
the environment, and creating carbon-free, nu-
clear-free energy. The conversion to a peace 
economy would occur when the President cer-
tifies to Congress that all countries possessing 
nuclear weapons have begun elimination 
under an international treaty or other legal 
agreement. 
Our country still has a long list of urgent do-
mestic needs that have been put on the back 
burner. As the only nation that has used nu-
clear weapons in war, and that still possesses 
one of the largest nuclear weapons arsenals, 
my bill would help the United States reestab-
lish its moral leadership in the world by re-
directing funds that would otherwise go to nu-
clear weapons to urgent domestic needs. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation.

Army Specialist Abigail Jenks. Specialist 
Jenks tragically lost her life in an airborne 
training exercise on Monday, April 19, 2021 at 
Fort Bragg. 
Specialist 
Jenks 
was 
a 
native 
of 
Gansevoort, New York. She graduated from 
Saratoga Springs High School in 2018 and 
went on to enlist in the U.S. Army. In June of 
2019, Specialist Jenks was assigned as a 
paratrooper to Fort Bragg, North Carolina. She 
had previously completed the Basic Airborne 
Course at Fort Benning, Georgia and Ad-
vanced Individual Training at Fort Sill, Okla-
homa. Specialist Jenks was a fire support spe-
cialist operating as a forward observer with the 
brigade’s Headquarters and Headquarters Bat-
tery, 1st Battalion, 319th Airborne Field Artil-
lery Regiment, 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 
82nd Airborne Division. 
Specialist Jenks always knew she wanted to 
serve her country by enlisting in the Army. As 
a member of the famed 82nd Airborne Divi-
sion, she excelled at her role and flourished in 
the rigorous and demanding environment that 
serving in our Armed Forces commands. In 
recognition of her outstanding service, Spe-
cialist Jenks was awarded the Army Achieve-
ment Medal, the Army Good Conduct Medal, 
the National Defense Service Medal, the Glob-
al War on Terrorism Medal, the Army Service 
Ribbon, and the Army Parachutist Badge. 
Now, she will be posthumously awarded the 
Meritorious 
Service 
Medal—a 
prestigious 
award only presented to those who distinguish 
themselves 
by 
outstanding 
meritorious 
achievement and service to the United States. 
On behalf of New York’s 21st Congressional 
District, I am honored to recognize Specialist 
Abigail Jenks’ character, bravery, and remark-
able dedication to our country, and I ask this 
House to remember her sacrifice and legacy 
forever.

CELEBRATING THE CORPUS CHRIS-
TI ARMY DEPOT’S 60TH BIRTH-
DAY 
HON. MICHAEL CLOUD 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 26, 2021 
Mr. CLOUD. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the Corpus Christi Army Depot (CCAD), 
which celebrated its 60th anniversary on April 
21, 2021. CCAD is the premier rotary winged 
helicopter repair and maintenance facility for 
the United States Army. In the midst of a glob-
al pandemic, like a battle-hardened soldier, 
CCAD remains strong, committed, and dedi-
cated to answering the nation’s call and keep-
ing the Army flag flying. 
Originally named the U.S. Army Transpor-
tation Aeronautical Depot Maintenance Center 
(ARADMAC), CCAD was established on 
March 10, 1961, and accepted by the U.S. 
Army on April 21, 1961. Members of CCAD 
served abroad on the USNS Corpus Christi 
Bay—formerly the USS Albemarle—during the 
Vietnam War as the Army’s only floating main-
tenance depot, saving time, money, and lives 
during the conflict. The names Huey, Chinook, 
Black Hawk, and Apache evoke memories, 
pride, and gratefulness to our veterans, active 
duty, and retired service members and civil-
ians alike, whether in war or peacetime. 
The freedom and the security that citizens 
of the United States enjoy today are a direct 
result of the hard work and continuing commit-
ment of CCAD to the mission given by the 
U.S. Army. Thousands of military, civilian, and 
contractor employees have walked the halls, 
worked in the hangars, turned the wrenches, 
flown the aircraft and dedicated themselves to 
the operation that began in 1961. The commu-
nity leaders and citizens of Corpus Christi, 
Texas, recognize and appreciate the service 
of all personnel of the Corpus Christi Army 
Depot, past and present. We salute this great 
organizations’ unending mission. 
I wish the Corpus Christi Army Depot a 
happy 60th birthday.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF 
FORMER 
SPEAKER 
JOE 
TAITANO SAN AGUSTIN 
HON. MICHAEL F.Q. SAN NICOLAS 
OF GUAM 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 26, 2021 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker. I rise 
today In honor the life and legacy of former 
Speakr Joe Taitano San Agustin. Speaker San 
Agustin was a devoted public servant, political 
pioneer, and a true advocate for the people of 
Guam. Our community will fondly remember 
him as a compassionate leader who dedicated 
his entire life to uplifting others and realizing a 
more prosperous Guam. 
When Congress issued legislation in 1968, 
which provided for the first popular election of 
the governor and lieutenant governor of 
Guam, Speaker San Agustin was instrumental 
in launching Guam’s transition into self-gov-
ernance. He served as the director of adminis-
tration to both the last appointed and first 
elected governors of Guam, and by 1976, he 
was elected to serve as a senator in the 14th 
Legislature of Guam, where he made strides 
in economic development and the protection 
of public finances for two decades. Through-
out his ten terms in office, he also served as 
speaker of the 20th, 21st, and 22nd legisla-
tures, and following his departure from the 
chamber, his service continued to prove valu-
able as chairman of the Democratic Party of 
Guam from 1997 to 2001. 
Speaker San Agustin’s contributions toward 
a greater quality of life for the island’s resi-
dents extended beyond traditional politics, and 
continue to echo in today’s age. Building 
strongholds for our community, he notably, led 
twenty government employees in donating to 
establish the Governmemt of Guam Federal 
Credit Union in 1962 and went on to serve on 
the board of directors for the Bank of Guam. 
He also fought for retirement security as chair-
man of the Government of Guam Retirement 
Fund Board and served as the executive di-
rector of the Guam Base Reuse and Closure 
Office. 
Speaker San Agustin was an esteemed 
leader and advocate who dedicated his entire 
life to public service. His career illustrates a 
remarkable fidelity to just and meaningful 
change, and his countless contributions to our 
systems of governance and historic policy 
continue to inspire many in our community. 
Speaker San Agustin served with my grand-
father during their time in the legislature, and 
I am deeply saddened by his passing. My 
family and I wish to extend our hearts and 
prayers for him and his family, and I join the 
people of Guam in remembering and cele-
brating his life and legacy of selfless service. 
Our island has lost an icon, but we know he 
is happy with Auntie May. He will be deeply 
missed, and his love and memories will for-
ever remain in the hearts of the people of 
Guam.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 77TH AN-
NIVERSARY OF EXERCISE TIGER 
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 26, 2021 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, it is with a 
deep and poignant gratitude that I rise today 
to celebrate the American heroes who lost 
their lives seventy-seven years ago during Ex-
ercise Tiger. Paving the way for the D-Day in-
vasion that would take place on June 6, 1944, 
Exercise Tiger, while once kept secret, is now 
regarded as having been both a tragedy and 
a critically instructive component of the Allies’ 
mission to end World War II. The lives lost on 
that fateful day were honored by the soldiers 
who learned from Exercise Tiger and carried 
their memory into battle during the liberation of 
France. It is a story we must never allow our-
selves to forget. 
Before the assembled British, Canadian, 
and American forces could carry out the D- 
Day invasion, 4,000 soldiers conducted a 
massive simulated landing to rehearse and 
prepare for that immeasurably vital military 
act. However, what started as a military exer-
cise ended as one of the greatest military trag-
edies of World War II. The calm, dark night of 
April 28, 1944, burst into chaos and combat 
when German U-boats ambushed the Tank 
Landing Ships (LSTs) transporting American 
soldiers. Almost 750 American servicemen, in-
cluding over 200 Missourians, would give their 
last full measure of devotion when their ves-
sels were either destroyed or severely dam-
aged. But Allied forces would not be deterred, 
as the brave soldiers on those vessels banded 
together to repel enemy attacks and move for-
ward with their mission. Even in the face of 
immense loss, a well-equipped enemy force, 
and little help from nearby Allied forces, the 
tenacity and determination of the soldiers and 
sailors involved ensured that the landing oper-
ations would continue mere hours after the ini-
tial attack. Allied Commanders planning the 
eventual D-Day invasion learned from Exer-
cise Tiger and incorporated new strategies to 
ensure soldiers would be protected from bar-
rage before landing on the beach. Without the 
bravery of the forces that fought that day, it is 
possible that even more American, Canadian, 
and British lives would have been lost on D- 
Day, and that the invasion of France, which 
hinged on secrecy, speed, and synchronicity, 
would have failed. It is not hyperbole to say 
that the soldiers and sailors of Exercise Tiger 
changed the course of world history and that 
we are forever indebted to their sacrifice. 
It is a time-honored tradition in the United 
States for us to gather and celebrate the her-
oism and sacrifices of the countless fathers, 
mothers, brothers, sisters, and children who 
have died to protect our nation from foreign 
and domestic threats. On the last Monday of 
May, thousands congregate to quietly observe 
and remember the names found on marble

headstones cascading across Arlington Na-
tional Cemetery. On the fourth day of July, we 
join friends and family for a celebration of our 
nation’s independence. On each November 
11th, we reach out to the veterans in our lives, 
thank them for their service, and if we are 
lucky, listen to their stories of service. Scat-
tered between these national celebrations are 
memorials hosted in small towns and big cities 
across America that pay tribute to the local 
legends who fought to protect the freedoms 
we hold dear. Every year since 1989, the Ex-
ercise 
Tiger 
Commemorative 
Foundation, 
alongside the Coast Guard Station Barnegat 
Light, have celebrated the heroes of Exercise 
Tiger with a wreath-laying ceremony at sta-
tions across the United States. It is now the 
longest-running wreath tribute in Coast Guard 
history. 
Moreover, this year, the Exercise Tiger 
Commemorative Foundation has worked with 
the Audrain County Commissioners to memo-
rialize and celebrate the oft-overlooked her-
oism of our nation’s Black soldiers and sailors. 
We must never lose sight of the fact that while 
Black soldiers were fighting for the freedom of 
France, they themselves were not free in 
America. As they parachuted in Normandy 
and stormed Omaha and Utah Beaches, our 
nation was upholding the horrors of segrega-
tion and Jim Crow. They did so because they 
believed in the promise of America. We are all 
eternally indebted to that faith and their sac-
rifices, and I want to thank the Foundation and 
the Audrain County Commissioners for work-
ing to ensure that all our veterans receive the 
praise, glory, and honor they have earned. 
A 5,000-pound anchor, located in Audrain 
County, serves as the memorial for the heroes 
of Exercise Tiger. However, it is more than 
just a relic of the past. Rather, it is a constant 
reminder that our freedom was paid for by the 
sacrifices of those who came before us. At the 
beginning of the COVID–19 pandemic, a blue 
ribbon was wrapped around that anchor, and 
it was only to be cut down when a vaccine 
was developed. On April 28, 2021, as our sci-
entists, healthcare workers, and soldiers en-
gage in a noble crusade against COVID–19 at 
vaccination sites across the country, that rib-
bon will be removed. While its removal does 
not signal the end of the pandemic, it does 
celebrate the fact that we are accomplishing 
what seemed impossible just months ago. We 
have demonstrated, like the Greatest Genera-
tion before us, that America can overcome 
any threat when we are united, be it a fleet of 
enemy submarines or an elusive virus. That 
capacity will always be worth celebrating. 
Madam Speaker, please join me and my 
colleagues in honoring the nearly 750 Ameri-
cans, including 201 Missourians, who gave 
their lives during Exercise Tiger. Additionally, 
please join me in extending a heartfelt ‘‘thank 
you’’ to the Audrain County Commissioners, 
the Exercise Tiger Commemorative Founda-
tion, and the Coast Guard Station Barnegat 
Light, for organizing these memorial events 
each year since 1989. On April 28th, it is my 
fervent hope that we all take a moment to re-
member the victims and veterans of Exercise 
Tiger and to re-affirm our commitment to hon-
oring their legacy each day through selfless 
service to others in our community.

HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 26, 2021 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor U.S. Army Private Walter A. 
Smead for his heroic sacrifice at the Battle of 
Chosin Reservoir during the Korean War, 
where he ultimately gave his life for his coun-
try at the young age of 24. His remains were 
recently returned to the United States in 2018 
and at long last, identified in March of 2021, 
after he was listed as missing in action in 
1950 and then presumed dead since 1953. 
Private Smead was born and raised in Sara-
toga County, New York in the Town of Hadley. 
After enlisting in the Army and joining Battery 
A, 57th Field Artillery Battalion, 7th Infantry Di-
vision, he was deployed to Europe in World 
War II and then to Korea when the North in-
vaded the South in 1950. Private Smead was 
reported missing in action at the Battle of 
Chosin Reservoir after his unit valiantly pro-
vided cover for retreating forces before retreat-
ing themselves. In 1953, he was presumed 
dead but, for decades, Private Smead’s family 
had no body to bury or knowledge of how he 
ultimately met his end. The conflict at the 
Chosin Reservoir saw more than 7,500 Amer-
ican casualties on the battlefield, and thou-
sands more perished due to freezing tempera-
tures and harsh conditions. 
Through the dedication and perseverance of 
the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency, 
the remains of Private Smead were finally 
identified on March 17, 2021 through DNA 
matching. His brother and fellow U.S. Army 
veteran, Douglas, never stopped searching or 
gave up hope that he would discover addi-
tional information about his brother’s death. 
This recent discovery can hopefully provide 
closure to Private Smead’s family. His brave 
sacrifice in the line of duty helped to ensure 
the safety of countless U.S. service members, 
and for his valor, he was posthumously award-
ed the Purple Heart and the Korean Ambas-
sador for Peace medal. 
Private Smead will finally receive the burial 
he deserves with full military honors at the 
Saratoga National Cemetery this summer. On 
behalf of New York’s 21st Congressional Dis-
trict, I am honored to remember Private 
Smead’s great sacrifice, and I thank him for 
his service to his country, protecting our Amer-
ican ideals of freedom and democracy for all.

HON. ANDRE´ CARSON

Monday, April 26, 2021 
Mr. CARSON. Madam Speaker, I rise with 
my fellow Congressional colleagues from

senseless shooting at the FedEx facility in In-
dianapolis. 
We also honor those who were injured, and 
pray that they have a full and fast recovery. 
The deceased were our friends, family and 
neighbors. 
They had hopes, dreams, and plans for the

short. 
And sadly, they are part of a much larger 
group of Hoosiers and Americans we have 
lost to gun violence. 
As our community and our state grieve, and 
as we seek to move forward, we pledge to 
never forget those we lost—in this shooting, or 
any other senseless act of violence. 
Their legacies will live on through our efforts 
to save lives in the future. 
Hoosiers are resilient, and we will continue 
working hard to create safer communities 
across America, always carrying the memory 
of those we have lost in our hearts. 
We will never forget them.

INDIANAPOLIS FEDEX SHOOTING: WHO WERE 
THE EIGHT VICTIMS? 
Officials in Indianapolis have released the 
names of the eight people who were killed 
when a gunman opened fire at a FedEx ware-
house on Thursday night. 
Among the victims were four members of 
the local Sikh community—including a 
mother, a father and two grandmothers. 
Other victims include two 19-year-olds, a 
university graduate and a father. 
Local Sikhs say they feel ‘‘traumatized’’ 
by the attack. 
It remains unclear if Sikhs were targeted, 
authorities say. 
About 90% of workers at the facility are 
members of the local Sikh community, po-
lice chief Randal Taylor said. Here’s what we 
know about the victims. 
AMARJEET JOHAL, 66 
Johal was a ‘‘mother, grandmother and 
member of the Indianapolis’ Sikh commu-
nity’’, according to the Indianapolis Star. 
Her granddaughter, Komal Chohan, says 
she is ‘‘heartbroken’’ at the death of her 
‘‘naniji’’, or grandmother. 
‘‘I have several family members who work 
at 
the 
particular 
facility 
and 
are 
traumatised,’’ Ms Chohan said in a state-
ment released by the Sikh Coalition. 
‘‘My nani, my family, and our families 
should not feel unsafe at work, at their place 
of worship, or anywhere,’’ she said. ‘‘Enough 
is enough—our community has been through 
enough trauma.’’ 
JASWINDER SINGH 
Mr. Singh only started working at the 
FedEx facility this week and had told every-
one how excited he was, an inlaw, Harjap 
Singh Dillon, told the New York Times. He 
said Mr. Singh had been working a night- 
shift sorting mail when the attack happened. 
An active member of the local temple, Mr. 
Singh had moved to Indianapolis from Cali-
fornia. 
‘‘He was a simple man,’’ Mr. Dillon said. 
‘‘He used to pray and meditate a lot, and he 
did community service.’’ Authorities pro-
vided Mr. Singh’s age as 68, but his family 
told the newspaper that he was 70. 
AMARJIT SEKHON 
A mother of two sons, Ms Sekhon began 
working at the FedEx facility six months 
ago on an overnight shift, her niece told the 
New York Times. 
‘‘She was a workaholic, she always was 
working, working. She would never sit still 
unless she felt really bad,’’ her brother-in- 
law, Kuldip Sekhon, told the Associated 
Press news agency. 
While officials said Sekhon was 48, her rel-
atives said she was 49. 
Ms. Kaur had been planning to make her 
‘‘renowned yogurt’’ to celebrate for her 
granddaughter’s second birthday at a large 
family gathering on Saturday, Rimpi Girn, a 
family member, told the New York Times. 
‘‘And today we’re gathering to plan a fu-
neral,’’ she said. 
Authorities said Kaur was 64, but her fam-
ily told media outlets she was 50. 
Samaria Blackwell was a 19-year-old soc-
cer and basketball enthusiast who dreamed 
of becoming a police officer. 
Her parents, Jeff and Tammi Blackwell, 
said they were ‘‘blessed by the Lord to have 
such a fun-loving, caring daughter as the 
baby of our family’’, in a statement posted 
on GoFundMe page launched to fund funeral 
and other expenses. 
‘‘Samaria was tenacious in everything she 
did, from playing basketball and soccer to 
being a lifeguard for Indy Parks,’’ they said. 
‘‘As an intelligent, straight-A student, Sa-
maria could have done anything she chose to 
put her mind to.’’ 
Mr. Weisert was a former Air Force officer 
who served in Vietnam and had previously 
worked as a mechanical engineer ‘‘to make 
ends meet’’, his son, Mike Weisert, told the 
New York Times. Mike Weisert said his fa-
ther had been thinking of retiring in the 
coming months. 
Mr. Weisert’s wife of 50 years, Mary Carol 
Weisert, told local broadcaster WKRC she 
felt ‘‘terror, horror, fear, shock’’ at his 
death. ‘‘I don’t know how else to describe 
it.’’ 
A fan of action and classic movies, he en-
joyed playing country and bluegrass guitar, 
according to the New York Times. 
Mike Weisert described his father as ‘‘a 
very decent, kind man, very dedicated to 
protecting and providing for the ones he 
loved’’. 
Ms. Smith was a sister and daughter, the 
Indianapolis Star reported her family saying. 
The recent High School graduate was 
awaiting her first pay cheque after starting 
work at the plant two weeks ago, a family 
member told the newspaper. 
‘‘She was a lovely, beautiful and youthful 
teenage girl,’’ a family member told the In-
dianapolis Star. ‘‘She had just started to 
buckle down and get a job and take life a lit-
tle more serious.’’ 
Mr. Alexander was a former Butler Univer-
sity student who had worked at FedEx for 
several years, according to the Indianapolis 
Star. 
‘‘‘He was a great kid. He loved to play golf. 
Had a big heart—always had a smile on his 
face,’’ Albert Ashcraft, a former FedEx col-
league, told the newspaper. 
‘‘Everybody liked him,’’ Ashcraft said. ‘‘He 
was always saving somebody’s ass. People 
would bring doughnuts in and he was always 
sticking doughnuts back for his drivers.’’ 
‘‘The Butler community is mourning the 
loss of Matthew Alexander, a former student 
who was killed tragically along with seven 
others at the FedEx facility in Indianapolis. 
We want to extend our deepest sympathies to 
Matthew’s friends and families during this 
time of great sorrow,’’ the university said in 
a tweet. 
LETTER FROM SIKH COMMUNITY 
INDIANAPOLIS FEDEX MASS SHOOTING— 
SUPPORTING THE SIKH COMMUNITY 
DEAR REP. CARSON, like you, we are deeply 
saddened by the senseless act of deadly vio-
lence at the FedEx facility in Indianapolis 
where eight people were viciously murdered, 
including four Sikhs. On behalf of the Sikh 
Coalition, the nation’s largest Sikh civil 
rights organization, we write to urge your 
action in support of the investigation and to 
outline longer-term recommendations that 
can help ensure the future safety of the di-
verse communities across the United States. 
By way of background, Sikhism is the 
world’s fifth largest religion, with over 25 
million followers. Sikhs began settling in In-
diana more than 50 years ago, and the com-
munity established its first gurdwara (Sikh 
house of worship) in 1999. We estimate that 
there are at least 8,000–10,000 Sikhs who cur-
rently live in Indiana. In the last two dec-
ades, the Sikh population in greater Indian-
apolis has experienced significant growth. As 
a community that has proudly been a part of 
the Indiana fabric for generations, Sikhs de-
serve to be safe in their workplaces, homes, 
schools, and houses of worship—without hate 
and bias. 
We recognize that a motive has not yet 
been established by law enforcement; how-
ever, the attacker’s knowledge of the demo-
graphics of this workplace and who he was 
targeting, as well as his personal history 
must be taken into account in order to ac-
knowledge the impact of hate, bias and white 
supremacist activity affecting our commu-
nities. Based on public reporting, the shooter 
allegedly had a propensity for violence— 
something his mother had previously warned 
law enforcement about. On March 3, 2020 
Brandon Hole’s mother went to the Indianap-
olis Metropolitan Police Department (IMPD) 
after her son had purchased a shotgun. She 
warned law enforcement that her son might 
commit ‘‘suicide by cop.’’ At this time, FBI 
agents stated that they did not identify Hole 
as espousing a racially motivated ideology . 
However, according to April 20, 2021 media 
reports, when IMPD officers went to the fam-
ily’s home, one of the officers went upstairs 
to seize the shotgun and ‘‘observed what 
through his training and experience indi-
cated was white supremist websites’’ on 
Hole’s computer. At the time, officers also 
reportedly notified the criminal intelligence 
unit about what was observed on Hole’s com-
puter and took the shotgun to the police de-
partment’s property room with ‘‘seized by 
dangerous person’’ written on the inventory 
sheet. To that end, the Sikh Coalition 
strongly urges both the IMPD and the FBI to 
fully investigate Mr. Hole’s attack on the In-
dianapolis FedEx facility, including all bias 
motivating factors which may be at play. 
It was no accident that the shooter tar-
geted this particular FedEx facility where he 
had previously worked and knew was over-
whelmingly staffed by Sikhs. This was not a 
crime of convenience or a spur-of-the-mo-
ment attack; it was one of methodical plan-
ning and selection. As such, we implore your 
office to help ensure that there is an unfet-
tered investigation into motive, without 
leaving any stone unturned regarding bias as 
a motivating factor. We also ask that your 
office ensure that these concerns are not pre-
maturely dismissed. 
The most recent available FBI data shows 
that 2019 was the deadliest year for hate 
crimes. Sadly, Sikhs were once again among 
the top five faith groups targeted on the

basis of religion. As members of a religious 
minority who have been frequently targeted 
in violent attacks, often motivated by bias, 
we remain deeply concerned about how bias, 
bigotry and the resulting backlash impact 
all of our communities. 
To address these broader concerns, we re-
quest that your office stand in solidarity 
with the Sikh community and other minor-
ity communities and pledge action that will 
ensure the safety of your constituents by 
supporting the policy goals shared below: 
1. Unequivocally demand that local, state, 
and federal law enforcement agencies con-
duct a comprehensive and thorough inves-
tigation into the shooter’s motive including 
accurately identifying any nexus to white 
supremacist ideology based on the shooter’s 
personal history. Doing so would signal to 
your constituents that no one should be tar-
geted because of their race, color, religion, 
national origin, sexual orientation, gender, 
gender identity, or disability. 
2. Improve hate crime reporting by passing 
the recently re-introduced Jabara-Heyer NO 
HATE Act [H.R. 2383/S. 1086] and ensuring 
that all law enforcement agencies are re-
quired to report hate crimes.This should be 
part of a larger initiative that prioritizes 
data collection, a key component of civil 
rights enforcement and ensuring compliance 
with federal hate crime and nondiscrimina-
tion laws. 
3. Close the loophole that limits federal 
prosecution of mixed-motive hate crimes by 
reintroducing and passing the Justice for 
Victims of Hate Crime Act. To effectively 
combat hate crimes, law enforcement and 
advocates need the tools to hold offenders 
accountable and ensure our justice system 
protects all Americans. This important 
change addresses a split in federal courts on 
the interpretation of the motive requirement 
in the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, 
Jr., Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009 that 
currently leaves many victims without jus-
tice. 
4. Reintroduce and pass the Disarm Hate 
Act to keep weapons of mass destruction out 
of the hands of dangerous individuals. Shoot-
ers opening fire on houses of worship, com-
munity centers, and other soft targets are 
becoming far too common. More than 10,000 
hate crimes in the U.S. involved a firearm. 
Anyone who has been convicted of a mis-
demeanor hate crime should not be allowed 
to jeopardize the peace of communities. 
5. Request state and federal funding for 
360-degree victim assistance services that in-
clude language accessible hate crime report-
ing, mental health services, comprehensive 
trauma-informed support, and technical as-
sistance and advocates for victims and sur-
vivors of hate crimes and mass casualty inci-
dents such as these. 
We are also happy to provide resources, 
sample social media messaging, information 
on the Sikh community, and guidance on 
how to support the aforementioned rec-
ommendations. If you would like us to keep 
you informed about vigils or other ways to 
support the Indianapolis Sikh community, 
please let us know and we will make sure to 
share those with you. 
We thank you for your efforts to help pro-
tect the communities we serve and look for-
ward to working with your office to move 
these important policy priorities forward. 
Sincerely, 
SIM J. SINGH, 
Sikh Coalition.

REMEMBERING LYNNE JORDAN 
TURLEY 
HON. STEVE COHEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 26, 2021 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to pay tribute to my friend Lynne Jordan 
Turley, a music and arts educator and a civic 
leader who lived a life full of purpose and 
meaning. 
Lynne gave to others because she cared for 
them and wanted to make the world a better 
place. She did this through her profession as 
an educator, both in Memphis and in New 
York City, where she helped to produce edu-
cational texts. 
She participated in civic affairs, both political 
and charitable. She was always for the can-
didate who supported the underdog and the 
downtrodden. 
Civically, the Lynne and Henry Turley Mem-
phis Center at Rhodes College will and has 
contributed to the betterment of our city. 
Lynne was a talented musician who played 
her piano and sang to the enjoyment of chil-
dren and friends both in person and on her 
WKNO television program. 
Lynne was a good friend to me both person-
ally and politically. She was sweet and smart 
and cheery. She had good values that she 
shared and a big heart that was always open. 
Her journey from Selma to Memphis to New 
York and back to Memphis was eventful and 
exciting. 
She was the perfect spouse for her husband 
Henry as she complemented his abilities and 
talents and the two were greater for having 
each other. She had a host of friends, a group 
known as ‘‘the Wild Women’’ who were very 
active in community affairs, got involved in 
politics and encouraged people to vote and 
make a difference. 
When they set their minds to something, 
they got it done. There wasn’t a bigger Mem-
phis Grizzlies fan than Lynne, who loved going 
to every game and knew all the players, all 
the fans, and all the ushers. She loved them 
and they loved her. 
I extend my deepest condolences to her 
husband and my dear friend, Henry; her ex-
tended family, and her many friends. She led 
an exemplary life and will be greatly missed.

April 26, 2021 
based on a newly released treasure trove of 
archival material shedding more light on the 
interaction between complex times and a 
complex personality of significant contrasts. 
Ben-Gurion was a politician-philosopher- 
poet, or equally the other way around, which 
he probably preferred. Born in Plonsk, Po-
land on October 16, 1886 as Daveed Yosef 
Green, he died on December 1, 1973 in Tel 
Aviv, Israel shortly following the traumatic 
Yom Kippur War. Indicative of his total at-
tachment to realizing the Zionist dream, he 
regarded his arrival in Jaffa, Palestine on 
September 7, 1906 from Odessa, Russia as his 
preferred birthdate so engraved on his state-
ly memorial besides his wife Paula, in the 
Negev, Israel’s mostly desert land. 
Admired as likely Israel’s leading founder, 
his finest hour, rightly identified by Segev, 
was his heroic decision to declare Israeli 
statehood on May 14, 1948 immediately fol-
lowing the British departure which upended 
its Mandate since 1917. 
Early on in his budding career as a Zionist 
politician in Poland, he proved to be a mas-
ter of detail, thoroughly studying any given 
subject before him, particularly recording in 
his notebook statistical and economic infor-
mation. Ben-Gurion was also known to be a 
lover and obsessive collector of books, which 
he shipped home when abroad, amassing an 
impressive library. He favored Plato though 
he copied in ancient Greek from Aristotle; 
identifying with Plato’s model of the philos-
opher-ruler he sought to blend his states-
manship for the reborn Jewish state given a 
long lack of sovereignty with a rabbinic tra-
dition celebrating argumentation. 
The late Professor Yigael Yadin, the famed 
Dead Sea Scrolls’ scholar who served as IDF 
Chief of Staff and Deputy Prime Minister, is 
purported to opine that Ben-Gurion was en-
vious of those with academic standing and 
thus his enormous drive for acquiring books. 
Ben-Gurion regarded Dr. Chaim Weitzmann, 
Israel’s first President, who was instru-
mental in the breakthrough 1917 Balfour 
Declaration, as his archrival and refused to 
allow him to sign the Independence Declara-
tion. 
Ben-Gurion felt some guilt for not doing 
more to save fellow Jews during the Holo-
caust and his encounter with the surviving 
remnant was painful. He could not even 
bring himself to visit Poland at war’s end 
and was relentless about the survivors leav-
ing Poland for Germany’s American zone 
through the B’richa (Escape) organization 
headquartered in Paris. My family and I 
were among some 200,000 surviving Jewish 
refugees enabled to leave Poland. Ben- 
Gurion’s goal was to bring them all to the 
emerging Jewish state with my own family 
arriving there as Israel celebrated its first 
Independence 
Day. 
Earlier, 
Ben-Gurion 
sought to create a temporary Jewish State 
in Germany’s Bavaria but denied by General 
Eisenhauer, who did agree to settle in the 
American Zone many fleeing East European 
Jews. 
Ben-Gurion bemoaned that the Holocaust 
deprived the nascent nation of its best 
human potential, more than the high num-
ber of Jewish victims. He credited the lead-
ership and financial support of American 
Jews for making a critical difference in the 
1948 War. He was concerned during the Cold 
War years that a Soviet nuclear strike on 
New York would deprive Israel of Jewish 
support, becoming convinced that Israel re-
quired a nuclear capability for its very sur-
vival, ever-worried of a second Holocaust. He 
believed in the potential of nuclear energy in 
developing the vast wilderness of the Negev’s 
desert. Ben-Gurion viewed Israel as the only 
authentic Jewish center with ‘‘Hebrew Edu-
cation’’ as the link with the Diaspora. Back 
in 1900 when he was only fourteen in Plonsk, 
Poland, he established with two friends the 
Ezra Association, pledging to speak only He-
brew. 
The multi-faceted Ben-Gurion opposed the 
watershed 1967 War, afterwards preferring a 
smaller Israel at peace with its Arab neigh-
bors, attested in his support for the 1947 U.N. 
Partition Resolution. He died before wit-
nessing Israel’s negotiated peace with Egypt 
and Jordan along with the recent Abraham 
Accords, adding four more Arab countries. 
Ben-Gurion’s single-mindedness and utter 
devotion to his cause of creating a Jewish 
state in times of unparalleled pain and mes-
sianic promise, remains his crowning glory. 
Both visionary and practical, Segev aptly 
concludes, ‘‘People believed in him because 
he believed in himself.’’ 
Rabbi Dr. Israel Zoberman is the founder of 
Temple Lev Tikvah in Virginia Beach. He was 
born in Chu, Kazakhstan, in 1945 to Polish 
Holocaust survivors and was raised in Haifa, 
Israel.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE LIFE 
AND LEGACY OF FRED ARBANAS 
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 26, 2021 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today with a heavy heart to recognize the life 
and accomplishments of Fred Arbanas, who 
recently passed away at the age of 82. A hus-
band, father, grandfather, athlete, public serv-
ant, and Kansas City icon, Fred was widely 
loved and will be fondly remembered. In his 
youth, Fred played for the Kansas City Chiefs 
and set records on the field. After his retire-
ment from professional football, Fred dedi-
cated himself to a life of service as an influen-
tial player in the Jackson County legislature 
for more than four decades of stunning com-
munity development. 
Born in Detroit, Michigan, Fred’s introduction 
to Kansas City was through his time on the 
Kansas City Chiefs, then the Dallas Texans, 
as a tight end. For eight years, Fred set 
records for the Chiefs and helped bring them 
to two Super Bowls and a World Champion-
ship. Before his remarkable life came to end, 
Fred had been inducted into the Chiefs’ Hall of 
Fame, the Missouri Hall of Fame, the Michi-
gan Hall of Fame, and the Pro Football Hall of 
Fame’s All-Time AFL Team. Even in the face 
of an injury at the height of his career, Mr. 
Arbanas continued to play and persevere, in-
spiring those around him. 
In 1973, after his departure from the NFL, 
Fred joined the Jackson County legislature. 
Between 1974 and 1989, Mr. Arbanas served 
as the chairman of the legislature four sepa-
rate times. His tenure in politics was dedicated 
to transforming the County’s recreational serv-
ices and amenities. Over the course of his 41- 
year career, Jackson County came to boast 
the third largest county parks system in the 
United States, with more than 20,000 acres of 
land dedicated to that purpose. Fred also 
played a considerable role in the paving of 
every road in unincorporated Jackson County 
and in the relocation of the county jail, projects 
of great importance to the county at the time. 
There is no doubt that Fred Arbanas was a 
pillar of the Jackson County community. His 
dedication to the county and his place in Kan-
sas City history will not be forgotten; his con-
tributions to his community will be memorial-
ized in the happy memories created in the 
green spaces his work made possible; and his 
inspiring example will be carried forward by a 
loving family and a grateful community, whose 
lives were touched, in so many ways, by his 
devotion to service. Fred is survived by his 
four children and eight grandchildren. His 
name will also live on through the Fred 
Arbanas Golf Course, christened in his honor. 
Fred was an icon to his community and a 
model public servant. His good deeds and 
commitment to helping others bring to mind 
Acts 20:35: ‘‘In all things I have shown you 
that by working hard in this way we must help 
the weak and remember the words of the Lord 
Jesus, how he himself said, ‘It is more blessed 
to give than to receive.’ ’’ Fred Arbanas em-
bodied what it means to give rather than re-
ceive. Whether he was giving his all on the 
field, or giving his service in the halls of the 
Jackson County legislature—whether he was 
giving to his team or to his community at 
large—Fred Arbanas was always giving. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in remem-
bering the incredible, vibrant life of Fred 
Arbanas. Please also join me in offering con-
dolences to his family and all those mourning 
his loss. Let us seek to emulate his example 
in the work we do here in Congress by re-
membering that service is about setting our 
talents upon the alter of change and making 
life better for those in our communities.

TRIBUTE TO HONOR THE LIFE OF 
CHARLES GESCHKE 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 26, 2021 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life of Charles Geschke, known to 
all as Chuck, a pioneer and a giant in Silicon 
Valley, who died on April 16, 2021, at the age 
of 81, at his home in Los Altos, California. He 
was born on September 11, 1939, and grew 
up in Cleveland, Ohio, where his father was a 
photoengraver and his mother a paralegal. 
Chuck was a deeply faith-filled man who 
once considered entering the Catholic priest-
hood. He attended a Jesuit high school and 
studied liberal arts at Xavier University in Cin-
cinnati. He earned a master’s degree in math-
ematics there and later earned a Ph.D. in 
computer science at Carnegie Mellon. He 
worked as a math professor, then at the De-
fense 
Department’s 
Advanced 
Research 
Projects Agency. He was hired by Xerox to 
work at its Palo Alto Research Center where 
he met John Warnock, Ph.D., and they joined 
together in leaving Xerox to found what is now 
Adobe Inc. 
Chuck created a highly successful and im-
portant company, one of Silicon Valley’s great-
est, that enabled desktop publishing which has 
had worldwide impact. The New York Times, 
(4/20/2021) opened its obituary of him by ask-
ing, 
‘‘If you sent a PDF on your computer 
today, thank him. In 1980, he and a colleague 
created a way of sending digital documents 
to a printer, starting a company, Adobe.’’ In 
the same piece, the Times quoted him as say-
ing this regarding his immense success; ‘‘En-
gineers dream of building something that 
millions of people will use; that’s their ulti-
mate goal.

I don’t think many engineers are moti-
vated by money. They’re motivated by hav-
ing an impact.’’ 
Chuck was a gentle person with a self-dep-
recating sense of humor and was unrelentingly 
generous. With his wife Nan, they donated 
millions to non-profits and universities. He was 
a fair-minded boss and with Dr. Warnock, em-
ployed the ‘‘golden rule’’ in the treatment of 
employees. He was a man of great faith and 
a model for corporate leaders to emulate. 
He 
received 
numerous 
well-deserved 
awards, including the National Medal of Tech-
nology and Innovation Award in 2009, with Dr. 
Warnock, and served on many foundation 
boards. He was proud of what he created in 
business, but his family was his greatest 
treasure. 
I had the privilege of knowing Chuck for 
decades and shared an enduring friendship 
with him. I sought his wise counsel and prac-
tical advice, always learning from him and ap-
preciating his depth of knowledge and integ-
rity. 
Madam Speaker, I ask the entire House of 
Representatives to join me in extending our 
condolences to Chuck Geschke’s wife Nan, 
his sons Peter and John, his daughter Kathy 
Orciuoli, and his seven beloved grandchildren. 
We are a better, stronger nation because of 
this great and good man.

IN HONOR OF MAYOR JEFF 
WILLIAMS 
HON. MARC A. VEASEY 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 26, 2021 
Mr. VEASEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to pay tribute to a friend and the retiring Mayor 
of Arlington, Texas. Warren Jeff Williams is a 
dedicated public servant and an advocate for 
Arlington. His leadership will be missed but I 
know he will continue to be an active member 
of our community. 
Jeff grew up in Sherman, Texas but often 
visited relatives in Arlington and attended 
Texas Rangers games as a child. 
His father and grandfather worked in the 
construction business but Jeff had a plan to 
go to law school until he got to Texas Tech 
University where he became interested in en-
gineering and ultimately received his Bachelor 
of Science degree in Civil Engineering in 
1981. Texas Tech is also where Jeff met his 
wife, Karen, a photography student. 
Jeff and Karen, now have 3 adult children, 
Natalie, Suzanne, and Ryan, and 7 grand-
children, all under the age of 6. They moved 
to Arlington in 1984, and their children grew 
up attending Arlington public schools. 
Jeff is the President and CEO of Graham 
Associates, a civil engineering and surveying 
firm based in Arlington. He has been the Civil 
Engineer on many landmark projects including 
AT&T Stadium, Globe Life Park, Parks Mall, 
IH–30 Three Bridges, and River Legacy Living 
Science Center. Jeff has been recognized as 
a Distinguished Engineer by his alma mater 
and is a member of the Civil Engineering 
Honor Fraternity at both Texas Tech and the 
University of Texas at Arlington. 
In addition to his success as an engineer, 
Jeff is also dedicated to serving his commu-
nity. He has served on the boards of the Ar-
lington Chamber of Commerce, the Cotton 
Bowl Association, the Arlington Convention & 
Visitors Bureau, the Arlington YMCA, River 
Legacy Foundation, and Project Restore Hope 
Foundation; as a co-chair of the Salvation 
Army annual luncheon; as a committee chair-
man and Sunday School teacher at First Bap-
tist Church Arlington; and as chairman of the 
2014 Arlington school district bond committee. 
Jeff is completing his final term as Mayor of 
Arlington in June 2021, drawing to a close a 
remarkable tenure of civic service that has 
spanned six years, between 2015 and 2021; 
and Mayor Williams came into office with a 
message that it was time for change and, dur-
ing his tenure, played a vital role, championing 
municipal projects such as the Abram Street 
rebuild, a new Downtown Library and City 
Center, and two new recreation centers (the 
East Arlington Branch Library and The Bea-
con); downtown development including Urban 
Union, East Main, and the Levitt Pavilion ex-
pansion; and innovation including on-demand 
transit, high speed solutions, and an Envision 
Center. 
He supported important economic projects 
including redeveloping the old Six Flags Mall 
into the Arlington Logistics Center; opening 
Summit Racing, Rent the Runway, a UPS re-
gional hub, and Nanoscope Technologies in 
Arlington; and relocating the national head-
quarters of DR Horton, Texas Health Re-
sources, and Six Flags Hurricane Harbor to 
Arlington. 
And, over the past six years, the entertain-
ment district exploded. Texas Live, Live by 
Loews, and the new Globe Life Field opened 
to the public. Globe Life Park was repurposed. 
The National Medal of Honor Museum chose 
Arlington to be its future home. Mayor Wil-
liams helped to safely bring the World Series, 
Professional Bull Riders World Finals, and Na-
tional Finals Rodeo to town during the pan-
demic. 
He worked to establish a Unity Council to 
study equity and equality in our community 
and Unite Arlington Weekends to serve those 
in need. 
Mayor Williams’s efforts have not gone un-
noticed across our nation. He was selected by 
the U.S. Conference of Mayors to serve as the 
Chairman of the prestigious U.S. Metro 
Economies committee for his incredible results 
and experience in economic development. He 
was also selected as 1 of 20 Mayors to partici-
pate in the Harvard Bloomberg Leadership 
program as well as the Yale School of Man-
agement for CEO’s and Mayors. Mayor Wil-
liams worked tirelessly to seek pandemic relief 
funding on a national scale. 
Mayor Williams’s adept and forward-looking 
leadership has helped guide Arlington through 
a transformative period in its history, and his 
many valuable contributions will continue to 
resonate in the years to come. 
Jeff has a gift of empowering citizens, fos-
tering partnerships, and encouraging us to all 
Dream Big. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you and my col-
leagues to join me in congratulating Mayor 
Jeff Williams and extending our best wishes to 
him for continued success in his future en-
deavors. He has given his time and talents to 
Arlington, which is a better place because of 
his service.

HONORING THE HEUVELTON VOL-
UNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT ON 
ITS 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF ITS 
FOUNDING 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 26, 2021 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the service of the brave first re-
sponders of the Heuvelton Volunteer Fire De-
partment as they celebrate the 100th anniver-
sary of its founding. From the beginning, this 
fire department has shown tremendous dedi-
cation to protecting and serving the village of 
Heuvelton and surrounding municipalities in 
St. Lawrence County. 
First established on April 17, 1921, the 
Heuvelton Volunteer Fire Department has 
grown from its original membership of 26 vol-
unteers to a network of local firefighters, emer-
gency medical technicians, divers, and fire po-
lice capable of responding to any emergency. 
Under the direction of its inaugural chief, 
Claude H. Preston, the fire brigade once 
rushed to fires with a hand-drawn cart and 
buckets at the sounding of the church bells at 
St. Raphael’s Catholic Church. Now, since the 
installation of the town’s first fire siren in 1932, 
a test siren can be heard every day at noon, 
except Sundays, as it has for the past 90 
years. The Department today can service any 
emergency call in the Heuvelton area and 
often aids neighboring departments. 
Despite its humble beginnings and starting 
with one ‘‘modern’’ Sanford fire engine, the 
department now has a fleet of engines and 
emergency vehicles and a dedicated team 
equipped with modern medical technologies. 
Currently, the Sanford engine is still in use 
after undergoing multiple restorations and can 
frequently be seen in local parades. In an ex-
pansion of additional services still provided 
today, Heuvelton and Ogdensburg firefighters 
partnered together to create a joint ‘‘First Re-
sponders’’ program in 1989, intending to be 
first on the scene, even prior to the Rescue 
Squad’s arrival. Volunteers of the Heuvelton 
crew faithfully assist in the time of need and 
display the compassionate spirit and lending 
hand that is customary in the North Country. 
Members of the Heuvelton Volunteer Fire 
Department serve as extraordinary examples 
of those who sacrifice for the good of the com-
munity. Throughout the strain of the current 
pandemic, they continue to put out fires and to
