PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Almighty God, our souls long for 
You, for we find strength and joy in 
Your presence. The Heavens keep tell-
ing of your wonders, and the skies de-
clare what You have done. We thank 
You for the star of Bethlehem. 
Guide our lawmakers to put their 
trust in You, seeking in every under-
taking to know and do Your will. Lord, 
when our Senators go through difficul-
ties, may they remember that with 
Your help, they can accomplish the 
seemingly impossible. Inspire them to 
find strength and courage from Your 
guidance, as they trust You to direct 
their steps. 
We pray in Your strong Name. Amen.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CAS-
SIDY). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent for 1 minute in 
morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
2020 ELECTION 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in 
this town, political arguments often 
change places very quickly. Actually, 
observers could get whiplash when that 
happens. 
Now, just think about just a few 
months back. Before this election, we 
had elected Democrats scaring voters 
with irresponsible conspiracy theories 
that President Trump was going to 
somehow use his office to interfere 
with State elections or that he was in 
cahoots with the Postal Service not to 
deliver ballots. 
Remember back after the 2016 elec-
tion, the irresponsibly worded talking 
point was that Russia ‘‘hacked our 
elections,’’ leading to polls 2 years 
later showing that 67 percent of Demo-
crats believed falsely that ‘‘Russia 
tampered with vote tallies in order to 
get Donald Trump elected.’’ 
Now let’s turn to the 2020 election 
just completed. Those same people are 
now earnestly warning of the dangers 
of 
Americans 
questioning 
certified 
election results. Think just for a 
minute. Those who supported hashtag 
‘‘resist’’ after Trump’s election are now 
lecturing others about the need for 
faith in elections. 
It is kind of disturbing to me—the 
hutzpah of some of the people around 
here, what they said in 2016 and after 
versus what they are saying now. 
I yield the floor.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, our 
Nation stands at a crossroads in our 
months-long 
battle 
with 
the 
new 
coronavirus. Tracking recent develop-
ments lately has felt like watching a 
split-screen television. On the one 
hand, Operation Warp Speed has fos-
tered a modern medical miracle. The 
genius of science has brought forward 
safe and effective vaccines at a pace 
which, just months ago, many claimed 
would be impossible. For about 9 
months now, our Nation has been 
treading water altogether. Now the 
road to victory is in sight. 
But at the same time, even as we see 
this hopeful sunrise on the horizon, in 
the here and now, we are still facing an 
ongoing five-alarm national crisis. The 
virus is surging across our country. 
Two days ago, my home State of Ken-
tucky set another bleak new record— 
the most Kentuckians lost in a single 
day of this pandemic so far. Nation-
wide, since the start of December, we 
have lost around 3,000 of our fellow 
Americans to this disease every single 
day. 
Meanwhile, although the American 
people have built our economic recov-
ery with more speed and resilience 
than anyone had anticipated, we have 
known all along that recovering pros-
perity would come hand-in-hand with 
defeating the virus. Thus, millions of 
working families across the Nation are 
still under terrible strain. 
Last week, economists thought we 
would see a slight downward tick in 
new unemployment claims. Instead, 
the numbers shot up, logging 885,000 
new claims in just 1 week—almost

S7832 
December 19, 2020 
900,000 newly laid-off Americans in 1 
week alone. 
Senators on both sides know what we 
need to do. In the springtime, when the 
country needed a bridge, we passed the 
largest rescue package in American 
history on a unanimous, bipartisan 
basis. Now what Americans need is an-
other bridge. Fortunately, this time we 
do not need a bridge over an unknown 
and frightening future but a bridge 
through the next several months, while 
the 
lifesaving 
vaccines 
can 
flow 
throughout our country. 
Frontline healthcare workers are re-
ceiving the vaccine as we speak. Yes-
terday, Vice President PENCE, Speaker 
PELOSI, and I all received first doses of 
vaccines pursuant to preexisting plans 
for the continuity of our government. 
These vaccines are safe. They are ef-
fective. They are our Nation’s path out 
of this hellish chapter. So the first 
lines of the cavalry are already arriv-
ing. We just need to help American 
families hold on while reinforcements 
continue to pour in: more paycheck 
protection loans for the hardest hit 
businesses, more additional Federal 
unemployment aid, more direct assist-
ance for families, a lot more funding 
for K–12 schools to reopen safely and 
get our kids’ educations back on track, 
and, perhaps most important of all, a 
huge amount of funding for vaccine dis-
tribution so that we aren’t just helping 
Americans endure this battle, but we 
are helping them win the battle as fast 
as possible. 
f 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, last 
night, we extended government funding 
for 2 additional days. The Senate and 
the House need to finalize another res-
cue package containing all the policies 
I just named and many more. We need 
to finalize government funding legisla-
tion for next year, and we need to pass 
these measures with a big, bipartisan 
vote and get them signed into law 
without further delay. 
We need cooperation and focus from 
all sides. There is a kind of gravita-
tional pull here in Congress, where, un-
less we are careful, any major negotia-
tion can easily slide into an unending 
catalogue 
of 
disagreements. 
Let’s 
guard against that. 
The American people have already 
waited for more assistance longer than 
they could afford. In my judgment, 
they have waited far too long for a re-
lief package of the same general size 
and scope that Senate Republicans 
have been proposing literally since last 
summer. Every one of us in the Senate 
and the House represent American fam-
ilies who simply cannot wait any 
longer for Congress to conclude these 
discussions. Every day that we delay 
may very well cost more small busi-
nesses their survival, cost more Amer-
ican workers their jobs, and, yes, cost 
more Americans their very lives. 
We have had productive discussions 
this week. I appreciate the good-faith 
spirit that has characterized my talks 
with the Democratic leader, Speaker 
PELOSI, Leader MCCARTHY, and Sec-
retary Mnuchin, but the American peo-
ple cannot feed their families or pay 
their bills with Congress’s good-faith 
discussions. They need us to act. We 
need to conclude our talks, draft legis-
lation, and land this plane.

The legislative clerk read the nomi-
nation of Thompson Michael Dietz, of 
New Jersey, to be a Judge of the 
United States Court of Federal Claims 
for a term of fifteen years.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Democratic leader is recognized. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, ever 
since a remarkable bipartisan rescue 
package in March, the CARES Act, and 
a subsequent bill to replenish those 
programs, getting further aid to the 
American people has been a long and 
arduous effort. It is no secret that for 
much of the year, our Republican col-
leagues were opposed to spending any 
more money to help the American peo-
ple during a once-in-a-century pan-
demic. 
Thankfully, 
the 
Republican 
leadership recently accepted the bipar-
tisan Gang of 8’s framework as the 
basis for negotiations for an emergency 
bill, which Speaker PELOSI and I have 
suggested, unlocking the current round 
of talks. 
Even now, at the end of this pains-
taking process, there have been some 
final hurdles. Crafting a $1 trillion re-
lief package over the matter of a few 
days was always going to have its dif-
ficulties, but we are running out of 
time. 
After passing yet another continuing 
resolution yesterday evening, we have 
until Sunday at midnight to secure a 
final agreement, draft the legislation, 
and move it through both Chambers of 
Congress with alacrity. I agree with 
the Republican leader on this: We need 
to deliver an outcome and deliver it 
quickly. 
We continue to make progress. I be-
lieve there is good faith from all four 
corners of congressional leadership to 
finalize an agreement very soon. Even 
though there are several issues that 
haven’t been closed out yet, we con-
tinue to make good progress on all 
issues but one. 
The No. 1 outstanding issue is a pro-
posal by the Republican Senator from 
Pennsylvania. This proposal is a new 
entrant. It hadn’t been an important 
feature of our negotiations over the 
past few weeks. Only in the past few 
days have Senator TOOMEY and Senator 
MCCONNELL
introduced this specific 
provision and made it clear they feel 
strongly about it. 
Senator 
TOOMEY’s 
new 
proposal 
would potentially prohibit the Treas-
ury and the Fed from setting up new 
emergency lending facilities moving 
forward, greatly reducing their ability 
to respond to economic crises. Again, 
this is something that materialized 
only in the past few days and would 
leave the Treasury and the Fed with 
less authority than it had even prior to 
the pandemic. 
Quite simply, Senator TOOMEY’s pro-
posal would do more than just prevent 
the next Treasury Secretary and Fed 
Chair from using the emergency lend-
ing programs that saved our economy 
and stabilized markets back in March 
and April. It could potentially prevent 
them from setting up new facilities 
that look, or even smell like, those 
programs moving forward. 
Democrats do not agree with it. 
Economists from across the political 
spectrum 
warned 
that 
Senator 
TOOMEY’s legislation would cripple our 
government’s ability to respond to a 
deteriorating economy. The Chair of 
the Federal Reserve, Jay Powell, hard-
ly a flaming liberal, is likewise strong-
ly opposed to the Toomey provision. 
Senator TOOMEY’s proposal goes way 
beyond what Leader MCCONNELL pro-
posed in his HEALS Act. The worry 
that this Toomey proposal is supposed 
to address is the need to prevent the 
Treasury and Fed from using their au-
thority willy-nilly to do whatever the 
new President wanted. That worry is 
unfounded. In order to create a new 
emergency facility under the present 
law, you would need the support of 
Chairman Powell, a conservative man, 
and the five members of the Fed Board, 
a conservative body. 
Under current law, an emergency 
lending facility could get approval only 
in a true emergency. Senator TOOMEY’s 
legislation creates barriers to emer-
gency lending that go far beyond cur-
rent law and tries to solve a problem 
that doesn’t exist. 
Publicly, Senator TOOMEY—I read an 
article in POLITICO—has expressed his

concern only about winding down the 
emergency 
lending 
facilities 
estab-
lished in the CARES Act. If that is 
what he is genuinely concerned about, 
there is a path to compromise. But his 
proposal goes much further and in-
cludes prohibitions on the Treasury 
and the Fed’s authority that would 
handicap our recovery efforts moving 
forward—not just during this crisis but 
any future crisis. We cannot agree to 
that, nor is it what the Senator from 
Pennsylvania says he cares about. 
What he is proposing is not about 
COVID or helping the American people; 
it is about tying the hands of the next 
Treasury Secretary and the next Fed 
Chairman in a true emergency. So I 
hope our Republican friends can agree 
to compromise here. Senator TOOMEY’s 
legislation is the only significant hur-
dle to completing an agreement, and 
Republicans need to make a decision. 
We are quickly approaching an all- 
or-nothing situation. Everybody needs 
to make a decision about whether we 
are going to pass this much needed re-
lief or not and about eleventh hour de-
mands and whether they are worth 
holding up the entire bill. 
We made great strides and great 
progress over a few days. You can use 
whatever football analogy you want— 
we are on the 5-yard line or the 1-yard 
line or whatever. The truth is simple: 
We are close to an agreement, but we 
need to finalize it. We need to finalize 
it, and only the Toomey provision 
stands in the way. 
We are ready to deliver a desperately 
needed extension to the historic unem-
ployment benefits the Democrats se-
cured in March; direct survival checks 
to millions of American families on the 
brink of financial collapse; crucial re-
lief to our schools, our small busi-
nesses, and our healthcare system; and 
funding to support the production and 
distribution of a vaccine. 
If we do our jobs, we will deliver the 
second largest Federal stimulus in our 
Nation’s history, second only to the 
CARES Act earlier this year. It is still 
not as large or as comprehensive as the 
country needs or as our side wants, but 
it will be larger than even the Recov-
ery Act, called ARRA, in the wake of 
the last financial crisis. 
We have given ourselves already an 
extension to finish our work. Let’s not 
ask for another one. It is time for a 
conclusion. We have 2 days to cross the 
t’s, dot the i’s, and come to an agree-
ment. The country expects us to finish 
our work and deliver a result for the 
American people.

CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as we 
all know by now, yesterday brought 
even more great news on the vaccine 
front. The FDA has now issued an 
emergency 
approval 
for 
a 
second 
COVID–19 Vaccine. This one will be de-
veloped by the American biotech com-
pany Moderna and millions of doses 
will be distributed across the country. 
I should say millions more doses will 
be distributed across the country in 
the coming days. 
As we know, the first vaccine ap-
proved, which was created by Pfizer 
and BioNTech, was approved just over 
a week ago, and already thousands of 
healthcare workers have been vac-
cinated. In my State, we expect a mil-
lion people—a million Texans—to be 
vaccinated by the end of this month, 
which is a remarkable achievement 
and one we ought to celebrate. 
Both of these vaccines will be ex-
traordinarily effective, estimated to be 
95 percent effective. If you think about 
the seasonal flu vaccine, for example, 
it is, generally speaking, no more than 
60 percent effective and many times far 
less. So 95 percent represents an amaz-
ing accomplishment. So the American 
people have every reason to be opti-
mistic about our ability to put this 
virus in the rearview mirror, once and 
for all. 
As we now know, the first round of 
Pfizer vaccines were sent to major hos-
pitals across the country, including 
more than 100 in my State. Unfortu-
nately, rural areas were almost en-
tirely excluded. This is largely because 
of the infrastructure required to use 
the Pfizer vaccine, which must be kept 
at a negative 94 degrees Fahrenheit, 
which is significantly colder than the 
average freezer. While you are likely to 
find these ultra-low-temperature freez-
ers in major hospitals and major re-
search labs, they are far less likely to 
be found in smaller, rural hospitals. So 
when the first round of Pfizer vaccines 
went out the door, they were only sent 
to hospitals with the necessary equip-
ment and a large number of workers 
who needed the vaccine. As a result,

December 19, 2020 
the healthcare heroes in rural areas, 
who have been fighting the same virus, 
often with fewer staff, fewer resources, 
and fewer treatments, were left wait-
ing. But we have every reason to be-
lieve that this will change with the ap-
proval of the Moderna vaccine. This 
doesn’t require the same low tempera-
ture storage and can be kept at around 
40 degrees Fahrenheit for 30 days. This 
will make it easier to safely transport 
these vaccines from manufacturing 
sites to rural parts of Texas and the 
rest of the country and ensure that all 
of our healthcare heroes, our frontline 
workers, and, eventually, the general 
public will not be left behind. 
There 
is 
no 
reason 
why 
rural 
healthcare workers in Texas or any-
where should be denied this lifesaving 
vaccine when their peers in larger 
urban areas are already receiving it. 
This is yet another reason to celebrate 
the approval of the second successful 
vaccine, and I am eager for the 
Moderna 
vaccine 
to 
arrive 
in 
healthcare facilities across Texas. 
Mr. President, that brings me to the 
business that remains before the Sen-
ate today and, likely, for the next cou-
ple of days. After months of trying to 
come together on coronavirus legisla-
tion—months—the last several days 
have given the American people a lot of 
reason to hope. First of all, it seems 
like, for the first time in months, there 
is 
actually 
bipartisan 
interest 
in 
achieving an agreement. That wasn’t 
the case in the runup to the election, 
where we had at least three or more 
cloture votes fail in the Senate. 
So for months additional coronavirus 
relief was defeated by our Democratic 
colleagues who weren’t even interested 
in the runup to the election on pro-
viding 
additional 
relief 
after 
the 
CARES Act passed last March. But, 
hopefully, that has all changed now 
after the election. Negotiators are 
working around the clock to reach an 
agreement that will gain the support of 
both parties and reach the President’s 
desk before we gavel out for the holi-
days. But the days are dragging on, the 
clock is ticking, and the time is run-
ning out. 
I want to mention two things—one 
about the process, and the other is 
about the substance included in what-
ever the package will look like. 
First of all, given the way that this 
is being negotiated, basically there are 
four people who are negotiating this 
massive spending package on behalf of 
the 535 Members of Congress, and es-
sentially, because this has been pushed 
off until these last days of the 116th 
session of Congress, the only thing 
most rank-and-file Members will be 
able to do is to vote up or down. In 
other words, there is no opportunity to 
amend it through regular order. 
I just have to say, this is a terrible 
way to do business, and in the future, I 
hope we do better because this is al-
most the worst of all worlds when it 
comes to legislating. But we know our 
backs are against the wall because of 
the politics leading up to the election, 
where we haven’t been able to do more 
since March, and so we have to do what 
we have to do. 
The second thing I want to mention, 
which is more about substance, is 
about the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram and the deductibility of ordinary 
business expenses. I believe the Pay-
check Protection Program has been 
one of the most successful parts of our 
COVID–19 economic relief. The goal, of 
course, was to provide small businesses 
access to low-interest loans, which 
could be converted into grants based 
upon their willingness to maintain 
their payroll and keep their employees 
connected with the business. 
The hope was that these businesses 
would survive and would rebound after 
we got the virus in the rearview mir-
ror. We didn’t know how long that was 
going to last, and, indeed, it has lasted 
longer than any of us would have want-
ed or had planned. But it is important 
that this Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram be revived because time is run-
ning out. 
In my State, roughly $41 billion has 
been granted or—excuse me—loaned 
with potential for grants to about 
417,000 businesses. This has been an es-
sential part of our response to COVID– 
19 and the economic fallout associated 
with it. But when we passed the PPP 
program in March, we expected—the 
Congress expected that businesses that 
got the loans that were converted to 
grants would be able to deduct their or-
dinary business expenses in the year 
2020. 
Now, I know that may not be the best 
tax policy in the world, but we could 
choose one of two ways to get financial 
relief to the small businesses. We can 
shovel money in the front door, or we 
can allow them to deduct their ordi-
nary business expenses even though 
they received a grant from the Federal 
Government. 
The reason why I say I know this was 
part of the understanding in March 
when we passed the bill is because I 
have now—because of the Treasury De-
partment’s opposition to the deduct-
ibility of ordinary business expenses 
for the recipients of the PPP grant, be-
cause of the Treasury Department’s po-
sition that those are not deductible, we 
have had to file legislation which will 
override the Treasury Department’s 
guidance and allow for that deduct-
ibility. 
Again, this is not an ideal way to 
write tax policy, but under the exigent 
circumstances here, I think it makes 
perfect sense. Again, you can either 
write more checks on the front end, or 
you can allow businesses financial re-
lief by deducting their ordinary ex-
penses on the back end. 
What I fear will happen, because of 
the opposition of the Treasury Depart-
ment, is that, come January, the busi-
nesses that have received this incred-
ibly important PPP benefit will find 
themselves having to pick up—having a 
tax bill, which will reverse, if not ne-
gate, the benefit that we intended by 
developing the PPP program in the 
first place. This will happen as early as 
January when many businesses have to 
pay their estimated tax. There will be 
an incredible backlash, I believe, be-
cause I think the recipients of the PPP 
loans and grants have every reason to 
expect, as Congress intended, that they 
would be able to deduct their ordinary 
business expenses. 
What is going to happen if we don’t 
fix that in this underlying bill? Well, 
we are going to end up doing it next 
year, I promise you, because I think 
the backlash we are going to feel here 
from the businesses that have been suf-
fering, have been hanging on by a 
thread—that all of a sudden, they have 
an unexpected tax bill of roughly, ac-
cording to the Wall Street Journal, 
about $120 billion worth. 
We ultimately are going to have to 
fix that, so we might as well fix it on 
the front end rather than on the back 
end after our constituents who have 
been the recipients of the PPP grants 
rise up in outrage, really, that we 
haven’t taken care of this now when we 
should. So I hope that in the negotia-
tions on this COVID–19 relief bill, we 
include the deductibility of ordinary 
business expenses for recipients of PPP 
grants. 
The funding we provided earlier this 
year for vaccine distribution has al-
ready been depleted, and States are 
dipping into other sources of funding to 
ensure they have the capabilities to 
carry out the widespread vaccination 
effort. That is another reason why we 
need to pass this COVID–19 relief bill as 
soon as possible. 
Workers lost bolstered Federal unem-
ployment benefits at the end of July, 
and they are set to lose additional ben-
efits the day after Christmas. 
Small businesses, as I said, are strug-
gling to stay afloat, especially as the 
winter weather hampers outdoor dining 
and events. I saw the snow that hit 
New York, where many of the res-
taurants—because they have been shut 
down, indoor dining has been shut 
down. They tried to build up some in-
frastructure outside their restaurants, 
but now even those have been closed 
down because of the weather. 
People are hurting and need help. 
Parents and teachers are wondering 
when their children will be able to re-
turn to in-person learning and how 
schools will be able to keep them safe 
when they do. 
The list goes on and on. 
Earlier this year, we made a $3 tril-
lion investment in our war against 
COVID–19, and that funding has been 
critical, not only to get us to where we 
are today in terms of therapeutics and 
vaccines but also to keep our economy 
from tanking entirely. But those funds 
are drying up, programs are expiring, 
and the American people are counting 
on us once again to provide the support 
they need. 
There appear to be a few remaining 
sticking points in the negotiations, but

there 
is 
no 
reason 
why 
Congress 
shouldn’t be able to reach an agree-
ment. The steady drip of information 
from congressional leaders is encour-
aging, but progress doesn’t pay the 
bills. 
Enough time has been wasted this 
year on partisanship and political pos-
turing. We have reached a make-it-or- 
break-it moment, and there is no room 
for inaction. The American people are 
looking to us to protect their health 
and their livelihoods, and we cannot let 
them down. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am 
going to be speaking just a few minutes 
on another matter, and I believe I will 
have time at 1 o’clock. 
With nobody else seeking the floor at 
the moment, I would just add to what 
the distinguished Senator from Texas 
just said. I discussed this with him off 
the floor after he spoke. 
There is a concern about what might 
be in the omnibus bill and in the 
COVID bill, and here on a Saturday and 
tomorrow, Sunday, or whatever, we are 
finished, and we are rushing it through. 
I would remind everybody that we were 
ready to bring up the appropriations 
bills that make up the omnibus in 
July. The House of Representatives had 
sent over—in June, it sent over their 
COVID bill. We could have brought it 
up then. We could have started having 
a series of votes. It might have taken 
us 2 or 3 weeks to have votes every day 
on different parts of their proposal— 
Democrats’ 
proposals, 
Republicans’ 
proposals, 
the 
Appropriations’ 
pro-
posals—and vote them up or down. I 
had urged that. 
Republicans have the majority in the 
U.S. Senate. If they didn’t like pro-
posals the Democrats had, they could 
vote them down. But instead they 
seemed almost terrified to vote. 
Ah, but there was a reason. We would 
have had to take 2 or 3 weeks to vote 
all of this up or down, but we had to 
take, instead, the time to put through 
lifetime judgeships of people who have 
been recommended by special interest 
groups. That is beneath the U.S. Sen-
ate. 
But, unfortunately, while these peo-
ple got lifetime jobs with high pay, 
hundreds of thousands and millions of 
Americans have lost their jobs, have 
lost their places to live, are unable to 
educate their children, and hundreds of 
thousands have lost their lives. This is 
not the U.S. Senate’s finest hour. 
We should have been doing our job 
and voting these things up or down. I 
know some may be afraid of what they 
had to vote, but so what? I have cast 
over 16,000 votes. Not all of them were 
easy, but I never thought there was 
any question about whether I would 
vote. 
(Mrs. 
HYDE-SMITH 
assumed 
the 
Chair.) 
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE 
Now, Madam President, the hour of 1 
o’clock has arrived. I will claim my 
time, and I am going to speak about 
the Department of Justice and the Of-
fice of the Attorney General. 
William Barr’s second tenure as At-
torney General is coming to an end. At 
this time, it is important for the Sen-
ate to reflect upon his legacy and upon 
the challenges now facing the Depart-
ment of Justice. 
As we all know, the Office of Attor-
ney General fills a unique role within 
our system of government. It was cre-
ated by the Judiciary Act of 1789, and 
in its creation, it was obvious the At-
torney General is not a traditional 
member of the President’s Cabinet. 
Supreme Court Justice James Iredell 
observed in 1792 that the position ‘‘is 
not called the Attorney General of the 
President, but Attorney General of the 
United States.’’ This is because an At-
torney General’s client is not the 
President; the Attorney General’s cli-
ent is the American people—all of us, 
all of us. 
An Attorney General’s duty is not to 
defend the President but to uphold the 
rule of law and do so with integrity and 
independence. 
Now, we know that President Trump 
has a very different view. He views the 
Office of Attorney General as an exten-
sion of his political power to be wielded 
like a weapon to further his agenda. He 
believes it exists to benefit him person-
ally, to target his opponents, and to 
protect him and his friends. His view 
stands in stark contrast to everything 
the Attorney General is supposed to 
represent. 
It came as no surprise, then, that 
during his nomination hearing, Mr. 
Barr was questioned about which type 
of Attorney General he would be—the 
President’s lawyer or an impartial pur-
suer of justice. 
Mr. Barr was adamant in that hear-
ing that while he may sympathize with 
the President’s policy choices, his role 
as a policy advisor would be distinct 
from that of the Nation’s chief law en-
forcement officer. If confirmed, he as-
sured all of us, his job would not be to 
protect the President. 
Thirty years ago, I voted for Mr. Barr 
to serve as Attorney General to then- 
President George H. W. Bush. I had my 
disagreements with him at that time— 
in fact, several. But I voted for him. 
When I heard in late 2018 that Presi-
dent Trump intended to nominate him 
for a second tenure as Attorney Gen-
eral, frankly, I was hopeful. After the 
short, yet disastrous, tenure of a to-
tally unqualified Acting Attorney Gen-
eral who eagerly bent to the will of 
President Trump, I was hopeful that 
Mr. Barr would restore some independ-
ence to the office. 
But after careful consideration and 
listening to his testimony at his nomi-
nation hearing, I voted no on his con-
firmation. 
Mr. Barr has long-held, expansive 
views of Executive power. And prior to 
his nomination—this is prior to his 
nomination—he 
shared 
those 
views 
with the President in a bizarre, 19-page 
memorandum, making the case that a 
President can obstruct a criminal in-
vestigation with near impunity. It was 
clear to me that Mr. Barr’s views 
would be weaponized by President 
Trump—a man who derides any limits 
on his authority. The President, I said 
at that time, needs a much tighter 
leash. 
By any measure, the last 2 years have 
been worse than I feared. Time and 
again, Attorney General Barr has acted 
in the best interests of Donald Trump, 
not in the best interests of the country. 
He has intervened and he has overruled 
career prosecutors only in cases to ben-
efit the President and his friends. He 
has departed from Department norms. 
He has misrepresented the Depart-
ment’s work. He has eroded public 
trust in the Department as a result. I 
will speak to just a handful of exam-
ples. 
In late 2019, a jury, with over-
whelming evidence, convicted former 
Trump campaign adviser Roger Stone 
for obstructing a bipartisan congres-
sional investigation and lying under 
oath and witness tampering. The evi-
dence was overwhelming. The jury con-
victed him. So, consistent with sen-
tencing guidelines that apply to every-
body, prosecutors recommended a 7- to 
9-year sentence. 
President Trump immediately took 
to Twitter to criticize the prosecution, 
and just hours later—after he had 
tweeted his objections—Attorney Gen-
eral Barr intervened. He overruled the 
prosecutors. He disregarded the sen-
tencing guidelines that are supposed to 
apply to anybody. 
What happened next reminded me of 
something Judge Michael Mukasey 
said when he testified in support of Mr. 
Barr 
at 
his 
confirmation 
hearing. 
Judge Mukasey said if Mr. Barr ever 
failed to serve with independence, he 
would ‘‘find a mound of resignations on 
his desk.’’ Well, in this instance, all 
four career prosecutors withdrew from 
the case. In fact, two resigned from the 
Justice Department altogether. And at 
sentencing, Judge Amy Berman Jack-
son took the rare step of defending 
both the career prosecutors and their 
sentencing recommendation. She stat-
ed that it was ‘‘true to the record’’ and 
‘‘in accordance with law and [Depart-
ment of Justice] policy.’’ 
Attorney General Barr’s intervention 
left me with just one question: Could 
anyone, other than the President’s 
close friend—a man who, according to 
Judge Jackson, broke the law and ‘‘was 
prosecuted for covering up for the 
President’’—receive such leniency from 
the Attorney General? I think the an-
swer is pretty obvious. If you are a

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7836 
December 19, 2020 
friend of the President, the Attorney 
General is going to try to cover for 
you. 
Then there is former National Secu-
rity Advisor Michael Flynn. The Attor-
ney 
General’s 
intervention 
in 
the 
Flynn case went a step further. Despite 
the fact that Flynn had twice pled 
guilty—pled guilty—to lying to the 
FBI, Mr. Barr’s Justice Department 
moved to dismiss the case altogether, 
prompting the lead prosecutors to 
withdraw. 
The sentencing judge, Emmet Sul-
livan, ordered a review of the motion 
to drop the charges. He appointed a 
former Federal judge, John Gleeson, to 
serve as an amicus curiae. Well, Judge 
Gleeson didn’t mince words. He advised 
the court that Mr. Barr’s grounds for 
seeking dismissal were ‘‘conclusively 
disproven’’ and amounted to an ‘‘un-
convincing effort to disguise as legiti-
mate a decision to dismiss that is 
based solely on the fact that Flynn is a 
political ally of President Trump.’’ Not 
long afterward, President Trump fully 
pardoned Mr. Flynn from his convic-
tion of the crime of lying. 
Now, many of Attorney General 
Barr’s departures from Department 
norms originated with his now-infa-
mous handling of the special counsel’s 
report on Russian interference. The 
Mueller report amounted to a 448-page 
presentment 
of 
misconduct 
that 
reached the highest levels of the 
Trump campaign and administration. 
But the Attorney General’s summary 
of the report—in fact, the only infor-
mation he allowed the public to seek 
for weeks—left Americans with the op-
posite impression: The report effec-
tively exonerated the President, even 
though it did not. 
Special Counsel Mueller wrote to the 
Attorney General at the time, con-
cerned 
that 
the 
Attorney 
General 
failed to capture his conclusion and 
created 
confusion 
that 
undermined 
public confidence in the investigation. 
Indeed, that appears to have been the 
Attorney General’s intent, and many 
others agreed. Federal Judge Reggie 
Walton wrote that the inconsistencies 
between his statements and the report 
‘‘cause the Court to seriously question 
whether Attorney General Barr made a 
calculated attempt to influence public 
discourse about the Mueller Report in 
favor of President Trump despite cer-
tain findings in the redacted version of 
the Mueller Report to the contrary.’’ 
This remarkable statement from a sit-
ting Federal judge about a sitting At-
torney General is about as damning as 
it gets. 
Soon after, the Attorney General 
began falsely claiming that the inves-
tigation was started ‘‘without any 
basis’’ and was politically motivated. 
That is despite the fact that an exhaus-
tive inspector general’s report refuted 
both of his claims. 
The Attorney General was not con-
tent with simply mischaracterizing the 
Russia 
investigation. 
He 
launched 
counterinvestigations into the Justice 
Department’s own investigators. He 
personally traveled to Italy in a des-
perate attempt to dig up exculpatory 
evidence. Ignoring Department poli-
cies, he regularly commented on the 
ongoing investigation led by U.S. At-
torney John Durham. And documents 
from the Durham investigation were 
even shared with the White House, ac-
cording to the President’s Chief of 
Staff. Then Durham’s top aide abruptly 
resigned, reportedly due to pressure to 
release their findings before the elec-
tion. In other words, they just broke 
all procedures because they wanted to 
help Donald Trump. 
On top of that, the Attorney General 
did all this while he was ignoring a 
subpoena from the House of Represent-
atives to obtain an unredacted copy of 
the Mueller report. 
In fact, Attorney General Barr has 
evaded transparency. He has impeded 
once-standard congressional oversight, 
no matter the topic. He refused to tes-
tify before the House. He was held in 
contempt for refusing to respond to 
House subpoenas related to the admin-
istration’s pretextual justification for 
adding a citizenship question to the 
census. He supported efforts to cover 
up President Trump’s Ukraine scandal, 
for which the President was impeached. 
He supported the unprecedented purg-
ing of multiple independent inspectors 
general, and he rebuffed congressional 
oversight at every turn. 
Now, this may not bother some of my 
friends on the other side of the aisle 
now, but the political winds have al-
ready shifted, and it harms all of us 
when congressional prerogatives are so 
blatantly disregarded. 
While Attorney General Barr has de-
fended President Trump at seemingly 
every turn, he went a step further in 
September by attempting to literally 
defend the President’s personal inter-
ests. The Attorney General moved to 
intervene and dismiss a civil defama-
tion case that alleged that President 
Trump lied about a decades-old sexual 
assault. A Federal court flatly rejected 
the attempt. 
Attorney General Barr’s interven-
tions on behalf of the President ex-
tended beyond legal issues to PR issues 
as well. At the height of a national 
reckoning on issues of racial injustice, 
the White House stated it was the At-
torney General who ordered the clear-
ing of peaceful protesters in Lafayette 
Square. Barr denied he gave the order, 
but he did not deny that he encouraged 
it. Peaceful protesters were cleared 
with rubber bullets and tear gas so that 
the President could stage a photo op in 
front of St. John’s Church. It was a 
grotesque display of unnecessary force. 
Most recently, the Attorney Gen-
eral’s obedience to the President re-
sulted in him falsely claiming that 
mail-in ballots, which have been used 
since the Civil War and relied upon by 
millions of Americans during this pan-
demic, ‘‘opened the floodgates’’ to 
widespread fraud. 
Voting experts described his claims 
as farcical. In echoing the President’s 
conspiracy theories, the Attorney Gen-
eral revealed how little he knew about 
basic election laws and the safeguards 
in place. His apparent intent was not 
to inform the public but to sow doubt 
among the public in the integrity of 
their vote. 
Attorney General Barr then rewrote 
the Department’s policy on election-re-
lated investigations, prompting the 
head of the Department’s election 
crimes branch to resign his post in pro-
test. 
For each of these actions, Attorney 
General Barr was publicly badgered by 
President Trump to act—publicly badg-
ered by President Trump to act. Now, 
it may be that Attorney General Barr 
believes he withstood the pressure. 
There may be some lines he declined to 
cross, such as fabricating evidence of 
widespread voter fraud, but we can 
never excuse all the lines he did cross. 
Critically, when a President pres-
sures an Attorney General to serve 
their personal interests, it is all the 
more incumbent on the Nation’s top 
law enforcement officer to avoid any 
appearance of impropriety and refuse 
the request—not to meet him halfway. 
Now, it brings me no joy to say this. 
I have known Attorney General Barr 
for a long time, but he has failed in his 
duty to impartially and equally uphold 
the rule of law. The Attorney General 
represents the United States and all of 
its 330 million Americans. Too often, 
the Attorney General felt he was going 
to only represent the interests of just 
one person. 
By serving as a yes-man when the 
law and the country and the Depart-
ment needed him to say no, Attorney 
General Barr has damaged the hal-
lowed office that he has temporarily 
occupied. 
Now the hard work to repair the 
damage has to begin. In November, the 
country voted, the American people 
voted, to take the country in a dif-
ferent direction. 
I served alongside President-Elect 
Biden for decades in the Senate and on 
the Judiciary Committee. He under-
stands the unique role of the Justice 
Department. 
I 
am 
convinced 
that 
President-Elect Biden would never rely 
on the Justice Department to do his 
personal bidding the way President 
Trump has. No matter whom the Presi-
dent-elect chooses as the next Attor-
ney General, I have no doubt that he or 
she will operate with the utmost integ-
rity, guided by the law and the facts. 
So as we begin to close the book on 
this dark chapter in our Nation’s his-
tory, with a pandemic that has left 
more than 310,000 Americans dead, with 
the outgoing President’s relentless at-
tacks on the foundations of our democ-
racy, I am hopeful that brighter days 
are ahead. I am confident we will again 
have government leaders focused on 
following the evidence and adhering to 
the rule of law, pursuing equal justice, 
and acting in the best interests of the 
Nation—all of us, not just of one per-
son.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7837 
December 19, 2020 
The thousands of hard-working, dedi-
cated men and women of the Justice 
Department deserve at least this much, 
as do all Americans. Indeed, the found-
ing principles and traditions of the 230- 
year-old Office of the Attorney General 
demand nothing less. 
If there is nobody else seeking the 
floor right at the moment, let me just 
mention a personal observation. As a 
young law student at Georgetown, I 
was invited, along with three or four 
other law students from different lead-
ing law schools, to meet with the then- 
Attorney General. We were probably 
diverse in our opinions, but we were 
asked to be there because of our aca-
demic standing in our classes. 
I remember sitting there with the At-
torney General like it was yesterday. 
He talked about the meaning of the De-
partment of Justice and how we have 
to represent the whole country, how it 
has to stand for the law. 
One of us—and it may have been the 
young law student from Vermont— 
asked the question: What if you had 
somebody who had broken the law but 
they were close to the President? What 
would you do? 
He said: If they had broken the law, 
we would prosecute them. He said: I 
might not be welcome at family gath-
erings for a while thereafter. He said 
that because that Attorney General 
was Robert Kennedy. His brother was 
the President. And actually that hap-
pened—a man very close and important 
to his brother’s election as President. 
The matter was brought to Attorney 
General Kennedy, recommending his 
prosecution, and of course he was pros-
ecuted. That is what an Attorney Gen-
eral should be. 
I declined his offer to join the De-
partment of Justice because my wife, 
myself, and I wanted to go back home 
to Vermont, and I thought probably I 
would never be involved with law en-
forcement after that. 
A few years later, I was with the 
State’s attorney of a county that had 
about a quarter of our population, and 
I was quickly faced with prosecuting 
leading Democrats and leading Repub-
licans in our State. 
I remembered what Attorney General 
Kennedy said. A prosecutor has to rep-
resent everybody. A prosecutor has to 
uphold the law. And I prosecuted those 
people. I have never regretted that. 
I have always been supportive of At-
torneys General who uphold the law— 
uphold the law because they are there 
to represent all Americans. 
As long as I am in the Senate, I will 
always speak out when an Attorney 
General does not do the job they are 
supposed to do and when the Attorney 
General does not apply the law equally 
and fairly to all people—applying the 
law, not politics. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
PENSIONS 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, an-
other Congress is ending, a President’s 
term is coming to a close, and, yet 
again, 
this 
Senate, 
the 
President, 
Washington have failed to address the 
pension crisis facing far too many 
workers. 
The American people are tired of 
waiting for us to do our jobs, and they 
are tired of being told by Leader 
MCCONNELL and President Trump: You 
are on your own. 
The House has twice passed legisla-
tion that would address the multiem-
ployer pension crisis, but under Leader 
MCCONNELL the Senate has failed these 
Americans. As for the White House, I 
don’t even think President Trump 
knows, much less cares, about the mul-
tiemployer pension crisis. 
We ought to be working to support 
all the workers and retirees around the 
country whose lives have been upended 
during this pandemic, and that should 
include more than a million Americans 
in 
multiemployer 
pension 
system. 
After a lifetime of hard work and serv-
ice to our country, they have already 
waited too long for Congress to do its 
job and to protect the benefits that 
these workers earned through a life-
time of work. 
We have been trying to solve this cri-
sis for years. The House has done its 
part. They passed the solution multiple 
times now. MITCH
MCCONNELL, the 
leader of the Senate, is deliberately 
blocking it, and his party and his Mem-
bers and the President support him in 
blocking it. 
Senate Republicans said this week 
that after a year of negotiating and 
talking to stakeholders, they made 
substantial progress toward a common 
ground, but then they released legisla-
tion that walked back all the progress 
that we had made. It is a betrayal of 
the people whom we serve. 
This pension crisis affects retirees 
across the country of all political par-
ties. Unions, chambers of commerce, 
and small businesses pretty much all 
agree that we need to get this done. 
Unfortunately, 
MITCH
MCCONNELL 
doesn’t. 
There is no excuse for Senate Repub-
licans standing in the way of a deal. 
This only gets more expensive the 
longer we wait. The longer we wait, the 
harder it will be to solve this. We wait-
ed year after year after year while Sen-
ator MCCONNELL has simply twiddled 
his thumbs. 
The public health crisis and the eco-
nomic crisis we are facing right now 
are not happening in a vacuum. The 
damage caused by the pandemic and 
the President’s failures is layered on 
top of all the existing problems in our 
country, including the crisis facing 
these workers and retirees who are in 
danger of losing the retirement secu-
rity that they earned. I always empha-
size ‘‘that they earned.’’ 
These pension plans were already in 
danger. Now the economic emergency 
we are in has put them in a worse posi-
tion. We are talking about retirees who 
did everything right. They spent years 
working on assembly lines, bagging 
groceries, driving trucks, working con-
struction—working hard to keep our 
economy going. Money came out of 
every single one of their paychecks to 
earn these pensions. 
People in this town don’t understand 
the collective bargaining process. Peo-
ple give up dollars today at the bar-
gaining table for the promise of a se-
cure retirement with good healthcare 
and a pension. Think about that. These 
workers are sitting around a table with 
their representatives, bargaining, col-
lectively bargaining with management, 
saying: OK, we will take a smaller sal-
ary. We will take a smaller hourly 
wage today so that money will go into 
pensions and healthcare. 
Yet because this Senate won’t act, 
because 
Senator 
MCCONNELL
never 
calls us together to do this—to take 
care of workers—these workers are los-
ing parts of their pension. 
This crisis in my State affects thou-
sands of people. It affects the massive 
Central 
States 
Pension 
Plan, 
the 
Bricklayers Local 7, the Iron Workers 
Local 17, the Ohio Southwest Car-
penters Pension Plan, the Bakers and 
Confectioners Pension Plan, and on and 
on and on and on. 
It touches every single State from 
Mississippi to Ohio, from Massachu-
setts to California—every State in this 
country. We are talking about our en-
tire multiemployer pension system. If 
it collapses, it won’t just be retirees 
who will feel the pain. Current workers 
will be stuck paying into pensions they 
will never receive. 
Small businesses will be left drown-
ing in pension liabilities they can’t af-
ford to pay—small businesses that have 
been in the family for generations. And 
there are a number of them in Ohio, 
businesses that people in this body will 
have heard of that make products they 
use. Small businesses and family busi-
nesses could face bankruptcy. Workers 
will lose jobs as businesses are forced 
to close up shop. 
The effects will ripple across the en-
tire country at a time when we can 
least afford it. We knew before the pan-
demic that this system could collapse. 
It is more likely to fail now. That is 
why the Senate must act. 
We know who will get hurt the most 
if the system collapses. It is not Wall 
Street. It is never Wall Street when it 
comes to Senator MCCONNELL. It is 
never Wall Street that gets hurt. It is 
small businesses. It is their employees. 
It is the people who make this country 
work. Their lives, their livelihoods will 
be devastated if Congress fails again. 
Workers and retirees in Ohio and 
around the country have rallied in the 
name of Butch Lewis, a great Ohioan 
who helped lead this fight, who passed

away far too soon fighting for his fel-
low workers. His widow, Rita, has be-
come my friend. She has continued this 
fight. She has become a leader and an 
inspiration to so many of us. 
I brought her to the State of the 
Union twice. She has made the trip 
here over and over, along with so many 
workers and retirees. They travel all 
day and night on buses. They have ral-
lied in the bitter cold of the winter and 
in hot DC summers. Their government, 
their majority leader, their President 
refuse to listen and turn their backs. 
Rita once told me that retirees and 
workers struggling with this crisis feel 
like they are invisible. They feel like 
they are invisible. To far too many 
people in Washington, they are invis-
ible. They are not invisible to me. They 
are not invisible to Speaker PELOSI or 
Leader SCHUMER or Senator SMITH or 
Senator PETERS or Chairman NEAL or 
Chairman SCOTT—all of whom have 
joined with me on fighting for this— 
and to so many colleagues who worked 
for years now trying to find a bipar-
tisan solution. We won’t give up until 
these retirees’ benefits are protected. 
It comes back to the dignity of work. 
When work has dignity, we honor the 
security—the 
retirement 
security— 
that 
people 
earned—again, 
sitting 
down at the bargaining table. Workers 
give up wages today to put money 
aside, matched by employers, gen-
erally, for the future, for this retire-
ment. 
They made the right decision back 
then, but we are not making the right 
decision right now as their pensions 
are in trouble. I urge my colleagues in 
this body—colleagues with healthcare 
and retirement plans paid for by tax-
payers, all of us who are in this body— 
to think about these retired workers 
and the stress they are facing. 
Join us. Let’s pass a solution that 
honors their work. Let’s honor their 
work. Let’s honor the dignity of work. 
Let’s keep our promise to them. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that the 
order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, isn’t it interesting? Here we are, 
Christmas week, the weekend before 
Christmas, and we are talking about 
needing 
targeted 
relief. 
Now, 
the 
Democrats have spent their year push-
ing off targeted relief. They have had 
their opportunities to tackle this issue. 
They have chosen not to tackle this 
issue. They have chosen to play poli-
tics with this issue. So, on the Satur-
day before Christmas, when we should 
be home and visiting with our fami-
lies—I would love to be home with my 
children and grandchildren—here we 
are. 
I honestly have decided that my 
friends across the aisle must not be 
paying very much attention to what is 
going on back home because the people 
back home in Tennessee are very frus-
trated with them. They seem out of 
touch. They seem to not care. They 
don’t seem to be interested in taking 
care of people with needs who have 
been adversely impacted by COVID. 
They seem to be more interested in 
taking care of themselves. 
This year really did not have to end 
this way. As I said, our friends across 
the aisle could have addressed this 
back in the summer. In July, the mi-
nority leader and his colleagues in the 
House 
immediately 
rejected 
our 
HEALS Act proposal in favor of Speak-
er 
PELOSI’s 
mega-trillion-dollar—$3 
trillion—wish list that they had dubbed 
the ‘‘Heroes Act.’’ You know, they al-
ways give such nice sounding names to 
things. Who could be against this? Yet 
they rejected the HEALS Act proposal 
that was targeted-specific relief and 
went with the Heroes Act. 
It was a very partisan bill. It con-
tained provisions that had nothing to 
do with COVID relief and that the 
House and Senate Democrats knew 
were going to be stumbling blocks. 
Their bill was filled with things—noth-
ing to do with taking care of people, 
but, oh, they had it filled with poison 
pills. Why? They wanted to make cer-
tain that relief didn’t come. They 
wanted to make certain that they 
could run this out and get it past the 
election. Then we found out from 
Speaker PELOSI herself and from some 
of the other Democrats who are in 
leadership why they did this. Oh, poli-
tics. It helped them with the election, 
they thought. They used people as 
pawns. 
That Heroes Act that they continue 
to like to talk about would have under-
mined State voter ID requirements and 
given the green light to some ballot 
harvesting schemes. Isn’t it inter-
esting? What are we talking about? 
What are Tennesseans talking about so 
much? Yes, you got it—ballots, elec-
tions, some of the harvesting, some of 
the tricks. Those items they had in the 
Heroes Act didn’t have anything to do 
with targeted relief, but do you know 
what? They were willing to play these 
games and to withhold that relief. 
Why? They thought it would help them 
in winning an election. 
That was all back in July. Then 
comes September 10. The Democrats 
again block the forward motion on an-
other targeted bill, throwing a proce-
dural hurdle in between the American 
people and desperately needed relief. 
They got by with it in July, so Sep-
tember rolls along, and it is about time 
for people to start getting ballots and 
mailing in ballots. What do they do? 
They decide to mess with it again—to 
play politics, to use people as pawns. 
They lower the bar even further on 
October 21, throwing away $500 billion 
in targeted relief. They all vote no in 
an attempt to tear our focus away from 
another round of funding for small 
businesses, support for schools, and 
more money for COVID–19 testing. 
Think about this. Time and again, 
they say: Oh, we have to have more 
PPP. We have to have more unemploy-
ment insurance. We have to have more 
money for vaccines. We have to have 
more money for testing. We have to 
have more money for getting schools 
open. But they vote no. They have 
turned their backs on the American 
people repeatedly. They did it in July. 
They did it in September. They did it 
in October. They have turned their 
backs. 
Think about what a plus-up of unem-
ployment insurance would have done 
for a family had they decided to vote 
yes and worked with us in July. That 
would have been a lot of money if they 
had had that plus-up every single week 
through August, September, October, 
November, and December. 
I mentioned the October 21 vote. One 
day earlier, on October 20, the Demo-
crats had blocked Senate action to ex-
tend the PPP. That was for all of our 
small businesses—and yes, indeed, they 
are hurting. We are hearing from them 
on the phone and through email. They 
are begging for relief. The minority 
leader threw another possibility of 
compromise out the window by again 
insisting that the Democrats would ac-
cept the full Heroes Act or nothing. 
Isn’t that amazing? That is what small 
businesses have gotten, is nothing, be-
cause my colleagues across the aisle 
have basically said: Give us everything 
we want, or we will just vote no. We 
will just leave people suffering. 
It is not the Republicans who have 
voted no. The Republicans have con-
sistently tried to help people, and my 
friends across the aisle are consistently 
trying to help themselves and use peo-
ple as pawns. 
At the beginning of this month, the 
minority leader took to the floor 
again. 
He 
rejected 
targeted 
relief 
again, and he demanded that the Re-
publicans come to the table. Well, we 
have been at the table. They are the 
ones who reject proposal after proposal 
and don’t want to move forward on 
things on which there is agreement. 
They want to hold out. They have not 
been paying attention to what is going 
on outside the four walls of this Cham-
ber. They continue to say: We have to 
have money to bail out cities and 
States. They call it aid to cities and 
States, but they are bailouts for these 
big blue cities and States that were 
having problems long before lockdowns 
came along and that have really made 
an uncomfortable spot for themselves 
because of having irresponsible spend-
ing policies. 
I know that Tennesseans do not want 
to see their tax dollars going to bail 
out people who have chosen to waste 
their taxpayers’ dollars, and I can’t 
help but wonder how much longer the 
Democrats are going to allow indus-
tries and small businesses and individ-
uals to twist in the wind because they

feel like this is a great time to push 
their socialist agenda and get us on 
that fast track. Oh, that is what they 
would like to do. 
We had a hearing this week in the 
Commerce Committee and had some of 
the venues and the live entertainment 
industry come before us—the people 
who tend to the stages when the cur-
tains go up, the people who are work-
ing backstage. We heard from Michael 
Strickland, out of Knoxville, whose 
company, Bandit Lites, helps these 
shows look great. You have millions of 
people who are in these support indus-
tries. We heard from the motor coach 
industry. We heard from some of these 
smaller venues. They are totally shut 
down. They were totally shut down 
when the country went into lockdown. 
They were the first to be totally 
closed, and they are going to be the 
last to reopen. These are people, joined 
by small business retailers and res-
taurants, who can’t open their doors, 
and they are small business manufac-
turers who have to wait for the supply 
chain to kick back up so that they can 
reopen their production lines. 
And they are saying: We need the 
help. They are asking us: Who is block-
ing it? Who is holding out? And we tell 
them repeatedly they could have had 
relief in July or they could have had it 
back in September or a couple of times 
in October or November or earlier in 
December. And it is not Republicans 
who have blocked that relief. 
Time and again, the Democrats have 
blocked Republican proposals to send 
funding where it is needed most. They 
have rejected every single lifeline that 
we have tried to throw. 
I think it has become clear that the 
Democrats in Washington, DC, never 
really saw getting assistance to the un-
employed, getting help to small busi-
nesses as a priority. Instead, they 
looked at this, they saw a crisis, they 
said: Well, this is an opportunity. Let’s 
not let this crisis go to waste. 
They have used it so that they can 
push their message, their agenda: Do 
what the Federal Government says or 
we will let you drown. 
So they know that their bills weren’t 
meant to act as help. Maybe they were 
meant to be a push for their leftist 
agenda. They know that the emergency 
financial provisions of the CARES Act 
were never meant to replace private 
markets or be used as a mechanism to 
bail out State and local governments. 
But you know what? They are going to 
push to try to make it so to further a 
leftist agenda. Crisis management is no 
substitute for fiscal policy. 
So I would say to our friends on the 
left, these tactics have failed. It is 
time to stop using the American people 
as pawns. Read your mail; listen to the 
phones. People want targeted relief 
that will help them to get to recovery. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
YOUNG). The Senator from Pennsyl-
vania. 
Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I want 
to address the ongoing debate over the 
content of a relief bill that I think we 
have made a lot of progress on and I 
am hopeful that we can get finished. 
Many of our colleagues have been 
down here and have reminded all of us, 
quite rightly, of the terrible difficul-
ties that many Americans are facing. 
We are not in a full-blown financial 
crisis anymore, but we are experi-
encing a lot of economic hardship that 
tends to be concentrated in certain sec-
tors and industries, and we have a full- 
blown healthcare crisis. So it is a very, 
very serious moment, and it demands a 
response. 
I am hoping we can get that done as 
soon as possible, and I want to discuss 
one of the terms that I have advocated 
for in this legislation. The terms I have 
advocated 
for 
have 
been 
mischaracterized, 
including 
by 
the 
Senate minority leader and others, and 
so I want to set the record straight on 
what this is all about and why I think 
this is so important. 
And to that, I think it is worth re-
membering what brought us to this 
point. 
Back 
in 
March, 
when 
the 
coronavirus was first ripping across 
America and wreaking so much havoc, 
the response, in many, many places, 
was a complete economic shutdown—a 
complete prohibition against doing 
business, 
against 
going 
to 
work, 
against earning a livelihood. 
And I understand why that was 
done—that we were in a healthcare cri-
sis, and that was the response that was 
believed to be most likely to prevent 
an overwhelming of our healthcare ca-
pabilities. That would have been abso-
lutely horrific, and so we had this eco-
nomic disaster. 
And what we discovered in March 
was this shutdown brought us to the 
brink of a financial crisis as well. 
If you think about the financial mar-
kets where people are providing capital 
to businesses and municipalities and 
individuals, they only do that if there 
is some confidence that they know, at 
least generally speaking, what the fu-
ture looks like. We had never seen any-
thing like the government shutting 
down our economy before. 
And so not really shockingly, the fi-
nancial markets were on the verge of 
completely freezing up, shutting down, 
and preventing even the most basic 
functioning of our economy. I mean, we 
might well have gotten to the point 
where a business couldn’t go to its 
bank and borrow the money it needs to 
make 
payroll 
on 
Friday 
or 
they 
couldn’t issue the bond that they need 
to do to pay off another bond that is 
coming due, and so that would put 
them in default and force them into 
bankruptcy and require them to lay ev-
eryone off. 
I mean, the knock-on effects would 
have been devastating had our finan-
cial system completely frozen up, and 
it was on the verge, some would say it 
was actually in the process, of freezing 
up. 
And so that is why the Treasury Sec-
retary and the Federal Reserve Board 
Governor came to Congress and said: 
Look, we need some extraordinary, un-
precedented new facilities that we can 
stand up very, very quickly, and we 
can use them to be a backstop, to re-
store confidence, and to enable private 
credit to start flowing again so that 
this economic recession that we are 
certainly going to go through—back in 
March it was clear that was going to 
happen, but it was not clear that we 
had to suffer through a financial crisis 
that would create a depression. That 
was something we thought maybe we 
can avoid. 
So these facilities were set up, as I 
say, to restore the normal functioning 
of private lending and private capital 
markets—not to replace those mar-
kets, not to pick winners and losers 
and decide, well, who gets credit and 
who doesn’t depending on whether we 
like their business, not to subsidize, 
not to say: Well, look, you know, let’s 
just give cut-rate loans to the people 
we like to give them to. None of that 
was the intention. None of that was the 
purpose. 
The purpose was to ensure that cred-
itworthy borrowers could access credit 
through the normal channels. That was 
it. That was the purpose of what has 
been widely described as the 13(3) lend-
ing facilities. There were several of 
these facilities. That was the intention 
for these facilities. 
And guess what. They worked. They 
worked amazingly well, remarkably 
well. Within days, certainly weeks, 
markets were again functioning, credit 
was flowing, and as a matter of fact, 
within a matter of months, credit was 
flowing at an alltime record pace; cor-
porate bond issuance hit an alltime 
record high. Across the credit quality 
spectrum, municipal bond issues were 
at an alltime record high. Borrowers, 
businesses that wanted to keep their 
workers and continue to survive until 
we got past this COVID crisis—they 
were able to draw down lines of credit 
from their banks. It worked. 
The creation of these facilities gave 
the confidence to our financial mar-
kets that restored the normal func-
tioning of those markets. It was really 
quite extraordinary. 
Now, that doesn’t mean that the 
economy got perfect after that. Cer-
tainly not. The economy is not perfect 
today. But it meant that a recovery 
would be possible. We would be able to 
function. We would be able to begin to 
pick up the pieces of a closed economy 
and, sure enough, we have made tre-
mendous progress. More than half of all 
the people who lost their jobs are back 
at work. So that is not anywhere near 
where we need to end up, but we are on 
the right track, in part, because these 
facilities did exactly what they were 
designed to do. 
Now, what does my language in this 
bill do? What my language does is it 
puts an end to these three programs 
that did their job—they functioned; 
they restored the private credit mar-
kets; and so they don’t need to con-
tinue.

What are these three programs? 
There is a corporate bond credit facil-
ity, there is a Main Street Lending 
Program, and there is a municipal 
lending program. Actually, they were 
hardly used at all. So quickly did the 
normal private credit markets resume 
their normal functioning that very few 
borrowers took advantage. 
In fact, I am pretty sure in the cor-
porate credit facility that was set up 
under these 13(3) facilities, I don’t 
think anything was done at all. In the 
Main Street lending, there was very 
little. In the municipal lending, there 
were two borrowers. That is it. 
These are the programs that were 
funded by the CARES Act, were set up 
at the time of the CARES Act for this 
narrow, specific purpose, and now they 
have achieved their purpose. 
By the way, there are lots of other 
programs that have been set up over 
time—some were set up recently—that 
my legislation doesn’t touch in any 
way, shape, form, or fashion. The Com-
mercial Paper Funding Facility—unaf-
fected. The money market fund liquid-
ity provision—unaffected. The Pay-
check Protection Program, primary 
dealer 
liquidity 
facility—untouched. 
All of them untouched, and, quite con-
trary to what some have suggested, 
this is no big rewrite of the Fed’s 13(3) 
lending facilities. It couldn’t be further 
from that. 
What it is is an acknowledgment that 
the three programs we created in 
March—and which, by the way, we put 
an expiration on them in March. We 
said they end on December 31. 
But now we have folks on the other 
side of the aisle who have a novel inter-
pretation of the statute, saying: Well, 
they don’t really have to end or, if they 
do end, we could bring them back to 
life. 
We shouldn’t even be having this con-
versation, but we are because we have 
got this interpretation that we have to 
deal with. 
What my language simply does is it 
follows the statute and calls for the 
end of this. 
How do we do this? There are three 
steps. One is we rescind the money that 
never got used because, as I said, the 
markets responded so quickly we never 
ever needed to use this money. And I 
think our Democratic colleagues agree 
on this provision. 
The language that I am trying to get 
in this package reiterates that these 
CARES facilities end on December 31, 
as Congress intended. You know, I was 
in the room when we were writing this 
bill, and nobody thought that any of 
these programs were going to last be-
yond the end of the year. 
But, as I say, because of this novel 
legal interpretation, we need to reit-
erate, in an unambiguous way, that 
they end on December 31, as Congress 
intended. 
And, finally, we ensure that they 
can’t simply be restarted next year or 
sometime 
thereafter 
or 
duplicated 
without congressional consent. 
Now, we have folks on the other side 
of the aisle who are raising all kinds of 
objections. They are very upset about 
this. And it is fair to ask: Why? Why 
would that be? 
Well, it certainly isn’t because the 
credit markets are back in turmoil, 
and they think we need to restore the 
flow of private credit. That would be ri-
diculous. The credit markets are func-
tioning as well or better than they ever 
have. It is not even a close call. So it 
is not that. 
No, what it is is something very dif-
ferent, and that is the problem that 
some of my colleagues want to morph 
these facilities into a use that was 
never intended for them. They want to 
convert them away from these tem-
porary emergency liquidity facilities 
designed to stabilize markets and re-
store the flow of credit—to convert it 
away from that—and instead to use 
them to implement fiscal policy and 
maybe social policy and certainly to 
allocate credit based on their political 
preferences. 
What is one of the ways that our 
Democratic colleagues would like to do 
that? No. 1, they want to bail out irre-
sponsible States. Now look, I get that 
there are some States across the Union 
that have suffered financially because 
of COVID. There are other States that 
haven’t been harmed at all; in fact, 
they have more revenue coming in this 
year than they had last year. It varies, 
and there is definitely a category of 
States and municipalities that have 
suffered a loss of revenue. We can and 
should have an ongoing debate in this 
body about what to do about that, if 
anything, but that is our responsi-
bility. 
If we are going to send money to 
States and municipalities, we should 
have a bill, appropriate the funds, and 
have a vote in Congress so that the 
American people can hold us account-
able. That is what happens. We get held 
accountable. 
When an action like that is done 
through legislation, it is out in the 
open. It is transparent. It happens in 
the light of day, and the American peo-
ple know who to hold accountable. 
That is not what our Democratic col-
leagues want to do. They want to force 
the Fed to do this for them. 
How do we know that? Because they 
passed a bill called the Heroes Act, 
H.R. 6800, that instructs the Federal 
Reserve to use the municipal facility 
for exactly this purpose—superlong- 
term, ultralow-cost loans to munici-
palities, up to 10 years, at one-quarter 
of 1 percent interest rates. States 
wouldn’t even have to attest that they 
couldn’t secure ordinary credit; they 
could just show up and get it. So the 
Fed wouldn’t be playing its traditional 
role as the lender of last resort in a na-
tional crisis; it would be the lender of 
first resort to their preferred constitu-
ency. 
There is the Main Street lending fa-
cility. If they can replicate that, who 
knows what kinds of conditions they 
would impose on low-interest loans 
there, whether it is climate or other 
policies that ought to be debated on 
this floor and ought to be determined 
through an accountable process. 
So, as I say, none of this is specula-
tive. Our Democratic colleagues have 
talked about this. They passed a bill 
that actually does this. 
It is ironic that when we were devel-
oping the response to the crisis of 
March, earlier this year, some of our 
colleagues described this $500 billion 
fund that was intended to capitalize 
these vehicles that would lend and re-
store liquidity. They called it a ‘‘slush 
fund.’’ In one of many examples, Sen-
ator WARREN, on March 30, 2020, said 
the CARES Act created ‘‘a half trillion 
dollar slush fund that the Trump ad-
ministration could use to help its polit-
ical friends and punish its political en-
emies, and I think that’s a bad thing.’’ 
Well, now there is a new administra-
tion, and now they want to keep the 
slush fund. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to complete my remarks before 
the vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection. 
Mr. TOOMEY. So this is a very bad 
idea for many reasons, not the least of 
which is to put the Fed in this position 
of being pressured to make these give-
away transactions based on political 
pressure that would completely politi-
cize the Fed. It would be the end of 
independence of the Fed. That is why 
this has never been the role of our cen-
tral bank, the Fed. We have never 
asked the Fed to engage in fiscal policy 
or promote social policy or to allocate 
credit based on political standing. That 
is guaranteed to politicize the Fed and 
undermine Fed independence. 
Fiscal and social policy is the right-
ful realm of the people who are ac-
countable to the American people, and 
that is us; that is Congress. 
I want to address another accusation 
that is completely false and totally un-
justified, and that is that somehow this 
is an effort to hamstring the Biden ad-
ministration and prevent them from 
doing what they want to do. 
Let me assure the Presiding Officer 
and my colleagues, my efforts to en-
sure that this would be a temporary fa-
cility began when we began discussing 
the facility. It was in March that I was 
arguing—actually, I argued that we 
should have this end as soon as the fi-
nancial markets had restored their 
normal functioning and no later than 
September 30. I didn’t win the argu-
ment. We ended up settling on Decem-
ber 31. But that is when I started push-
ing to have a finite period of time and 
a short period of time. There was no-
body in the room who thought that 
this was supposed to go on indefinitely. 
Once we started working on another 
COVID-related bill, starting in the 
summertime, and I became aware of 
this alternative interpretation of the 
language, we put it in our bill, and we 
voted on that in September. So this

language or the substantively similar 
language has been public for many, 
many months now. 
I also want to stress that we are not 
making permanent changes to laws and 
Congress can always act again. The 
CARES Act already made these facili-
ties temporary. They were supposed to 
end at the end of the year, and, of 
course, no change in law is ever perma-
nent. Any future Congress can change 
it. 
Back in March, when this crisis hit, 
the Fed and Treasury knew that they 
needed to come to Congress for the 
tools to solve it. They came to Con-
gress, and we turned around in an ex-
traordinarily rapid fashion these mas-
sive new facilities that had never been 
imagined before. We responded quickly. 
And if there is some kind of future 
event that calls for a future set of fa-
cilities of this particular sort, they can 
come back to Congress. 
There are three facilities—three fa-
cilities that were launched in conjunc-
tion with the CARES Act, funded by 
the CARES Act, and I am saying that 
they have achieved their purpose. They 
should come to an end. They should 
not be restarted, and a replica should 
not be created. That is all. 
Some have suggested that the Chair-
man of the Federal Reserve has some 
opinion on this. I would challenge any-
one to find a statement in the public 
record that he has made in criticism of 
this. He is very well aware of what is 
going on. 
The last point I want to make: Some 
on the other side have suggested that 
our language may be too broad, and 
maybe it captures potential facilities 
that shouldn’t be captured. If that is 
the sincere concern of my colleagues 
on the other side, I urge them to give 
me a call. It is very easy to track me 
down. If you have an objection to the 
way we have worded this and you want 
language that is narrower, I am all 
ears. We can work this out. 
With that, I yield the floor.

Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask

nation to be FCC IG. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there

NOMINATION OF JOHN CHASE JOHNSON 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, the 
FCC is one of the most important inde-
pendent agencies that we are counting 
on for the future of the information 
age. When you think about the fact 
that they regulate interstate com-
merce, radio, television, wire, and sat-
ellite in all 50 States, it is imperative— 
imperative—that we have someone as 
the IG who understands these policies. 
I believe the next era of telecom is 
going to usher in 5G. I do think we are 
going to solve our rural IT problems. I 
do think we are going to connect 
schools. But if we have an IG who does 
not understand communication policy, 
has no experience in communication 
policy, has never had a role in that, I 
say we won’t accomplish the mission of 
oversight or the mission, ultimately, 
at the FCC. 
It is clear we don’t all agree. It is 
clear we don’t all agree. You got a 
nominee last week; I didn’t spend all 
my time talking about why we opposed 
them. There was no debate. 
But when it comes to an IG, we have 
to get on the same page. We need an IG 
we can believe in. So I ask my col-
leagues to turn down this nomination 
and get us someone who has a depth of 
experience we all can believe in. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Mississippi. 
Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak on this 
nomination for 1 minute. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, Chase 
Johnson is the nominee here. This is a 
cloture vote. He is a marine. He is a 
Marine Reserve veteran. He is an ac-
complished attorney. He was reported 
from the Commerce Committee on a 
unanimous, bipartisan vote. The distin-
guished ranking member who just 
spoke made the motion that Chase 
Johnson be reported. 
We are the victim this afternoon of 
some absences. We are also the victim 
this afternoon of some discussion and 
some differences that have arisen over 
extraneous issues, and I would just 
urge my colleagues, both on and off the 
committee, to remember that this was 
a unanimous vote out of the com-
mittee. 
This is an outstanding candidate, and 
he deserves to be confirmed. With that, 
I ask for a yes vote. 
And, Mr. President, I ask unanimous 
consent that the mandatory quorum 
call be waived. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there

NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I first 
went to meet with the then-Republican 
nominee for President of the United 
States, Donald Trump—that was Octo-
ber of 2016. I was really struck by his 
commitment. 
It was kind of an interesting meet-
ing. It was in the Trump Tower, and 
they had 10 people. Ten of us were 
meeting, each one in one particular 
area of expertise, supposedly. We had 
people there on energy. We had one on 
healthcare. I was there for the mili-
tary. And I was very honored to be the 
one to advise him as to some of the 
issues and to talk about that. 
The thing that surprised me is his 
commitment at that time to listening. 
You have to keep in mind, here is a guy 
who has been a giant in the industry 
for many, many years, but he has never 
had anything to do with politics or 
government, really. So it was a learn-
ing experience for him, and he was ac-
tually listening. That was not his rep-
utation, but he was doing it. 
I remember he—we had a lot of ques-
tions that we asked and comments 
were made. Our conversations that day 
started a very strong friendship that I 
had with the one who would become 
President Trump. The President was 
listening closely. He asked good ques-
tions. 
Our 
conversations 
that 
day 
started a strong friendship, where I 
have been honored to offer him friend-
ship, advice, and guidance in the area 
of the military, and I think it serves 
him well. 
One good example of one of the areas 
where he was listening to me, against 
the advice of many of the people in his 
administration, was on the issue of 
Ligado. The President’s advisers were 
trying to convince him to go ahead 
with the deal to sell off the GPS-adja-
cent spectrum; that it was a good thing 
and so forth. I talked to the President 
and made it very clear that allowing 
the Ligado deal to move ahead would 
jeopardize our Nation’s GPS system, 
impacting not just the military and 
commercial aviation but farmers who 
rely on GPS to maintain fields and so 
many more. The results would be dev-
astating, not to mention costly. The 
President got it, and we worked to-
gether on that issue. 
I remember telling him how that 
happened. The FCC—the Federal Com-
munications Commission—they were to 
issue and to give a spectrum to Ligado 
at that time. We were in recess, so I 
went to them, and I said: Don’t do any-
thing until we get out of recess so we 
can be in on this. There was a lot of ob-
jection to Ligado. So without listening 
to me, the FCC just went ahead and did 
it—on a weekend, I might add. It had 
never happened before. They never did 
it on a weekend before, but they did in 
this case. And they gave the order to 
Ligado. 
Now, the interesting part of this 
was—this had to do with protecting our 
low-band spectrum from interference. 
It has nothing to do with good work 
the administration has made to make 
the bands of spectrum available to fur-
ther our 5G development. That was all 
there. But that is how this happened. 
The largest group I have seen ever 
come together in the years I have been 
in the House and the Senate on one 
issue was this issue—and I am talking 
about everyone. You had not just DOD 
and almost every bureaucracy but the 
airlines, the Farm Bureau, and every-
body else. They were all in on this 
thing. 
The President made the comment. He 
said: You know, anytime you are deal-
ing with a bureaucracy and they tell 
you that something has to be done, and 
it has to be done on a weekend, has to 
be done at night, then you know some-
thing is wrong with it. Well, they 
rushed into it before they had the op-
portunity to do it with everyone being 
present at the time. But that is just 
another example of how close we were. 
Another example was the Space 
Force. He wanted to do the Space 
Force, and I understand that. I was 
not, initially, all that concerned about 
it and supportive of it. But, on the 
other hand, you have countries like 
China and Russia—our main opposition 
out 
there—they 
have 
their 
space 
forces. And I think it is really good 
that we consolidated all of our efforts. 
We were really working well by con-
solidating that thing. We did that, and 
we did that together. That was one of 
the areas where we worked together. 
I remember another one was the area 
of Western Sahara. It is something I 
have been on the floor talking about 
now for the last couple of weeks be-
cause Western Sahara has been—we 
have had the same position with West-
ern Sahara since 1966; that is, they 
were rejected from their land in that 
area of the world, way back during the 
colonial days. In fact, at that time, it 
was the Spanish Sahara. We were de-
voted, at that time, for a right of self- 
determination for the people of West-
ern Sahara. 
I explained that to the President. At 
that time, he didn’t have a lot of inter-
est. He didn’t know where Western Sa-
hara was. He didn’t really have a lot of 
interest in that. But then he did, and 
he became committed to the idea that 
we have had a policy for over 30 years 
in our country that we would recognize 
their right of self-determination. So he 
went along with that. 
We tried to convince him this year’s 
National Defense Authorization Act, as 
someone had told him or advised him 
wrongly—I am talking about maybe 
some of the people in the President’s 
administration—that 
somehow 
the 
NDAA—now, the NDAA has now been 
passed by the House; it has been passed 
by the Senate; and it is going to be 
signed into law eventually. The Presi-
dent has talked about he might veto it, 
having something to do with that it 
wasn’t strong enough against China. I 
want to get it on the record right now 
on the Senate floor and make sure ev-
eryone understands that this is the 
toughest thing on China. Well, in fact, 
it is not just me saying it. The Amer-
ican Enterprise Institute, which is 
sometimes referred to as the conserv-
ative voice of government, said that 
this bill, the NDAA of this year, the 
one that we passed, we just passed, is 
the toughest bill on China in 20 years. 
Here is why. The national defense 
strategy—now, this is the book. We 
have to remember, this is something 
we need to adhere ourselves to. This 
was put together by 12 of the most 
knowledgeable people in America—six 
Republicans, six Democrats. They got 
together. This is providing for our de-
fense for the future. It is a short book, 
but it is one that we have been living 
by. And they are very specific in their 
strategy as to where China is. 
So last week, President Trump’s Di-
rector of National Intelligence said

December 19, 2020 
this—this is a quote—‘‘The People’s 
Republic of China poses the greatest 
threat to America today, and the 
greatest threat to democracy and free-
dom world-wide since World War II.’’ 
That was what the Director said. 
And from everything I have seen and 
everything our military leaders have 
told me, Director Ratcliffe is spot-on 
on this. 
This is another quote. He said: ‘‘Bei-
jing intends to dominate the [United 
States] and the rest of the planet eco-
nomically, 
militarily 
and 
techno-
logically.’’ I believe that is true. We 
have already seen evidence of the strat-
egy. Within the last few years, China 
built its first military base outside of 
its own territory. 
This is kind of interesting because 
this is a major deviation, what China 
has been doing for decades. They have 
always initiated any kind of a military 
activity from their own city limits. It 
all starts in China. And this has been 
going on for a long period of time. So 
this is a major deviation from that. 
This is a threat that China has, and 
they are against us. 
China has changed. They had this 
major advance in Djibouti. That is the 
first time that they started a military 
operation outside of China itself. So 
they did it from Djibouti. I have been 
down there several times. I have flown 
over the area that they have. 
China is not just in Djibouti, but it is 
all over the world. But down in that 
continent of Africa, they are as far 
south as the further extremes of China 
and all throughout. And in Tanzania, 
Southern Tanzania, they are very ac-
tive down there. This is something that 
is new. 
China is turning islands and reefs in 
the South China Sea into military 
bases. It is another part of the world. 
And they have been doing this. You all 
know about this. It has been going on 
for a long period of time. 
In fact, they now are up to seven is-
lands. These are not legal islands in 
their possession, but they took them— 
they created them. They didn’t take 
them; they created them. They made 
islands out there in the ocean. 
If you go and look at what they have 
proudly displayed on those islands, it is 
as if they are preparing for world war 
III. That is China. 
A lot of our allies in that area are 
wondering where is America while 
China is doing all of these things. So 
we are very strongly attuned to this. 
This is what is happening today, as 
we speak. And this is what we are ad-
dressing in the National Defense Au-
thorization Act on China. 
In South America, China is working 
to secure a port access to the Panama 
Canal, El Salvador, Jamaica, the Baha-
mas, and all throughout that area. 
That is right next door to us. They are 
giving the Chinese Communist Party 
an advantage right in our neighbor-
hood. 
In all these cases, this is not just 
about military influence but economic 
influence as well. Meanwhile, we are 
watching as China steals our intellec-
tual property and uses it for their own 
gain. 
A perfect example of this is in 
hypersonic weapons. Hypersonic weap-
ons—a lot of people are not familiar 
with that. That is state of the art. 
That is a new thing. That is what we 
have been racing with against our two 
adversaries, both China and Russia. 
And guess what. China and Russia are 
both ahead of us in hypersonic. 
People have this idea that America 
has the very best of everything. Now, I 
have to say—and I don’t say this criti-
cally of the Obama administration, but 
during the last 5 years of the Obama 
administration—that would be between 
2010 and 2015—he reduced the funding 
for the military by 25 percent. This is 
the Obama administration. I don’t say 
it critically. He had different priorities 
than I have and other people have. And 
so at the same time he was reducing 
ours by 25 percent, China had increased 
in that same period of time by 83 per-
cent. Stop to think about that. That is 
what is happening right now. 
The threat they pose is real; it is ur-
gent; and it needs a strong response. 
That is what the NDAA bill does. It 
takes strong action to push China 
back, to limit their influence, to 
counter their malign behavior, and to 
balance their military aggression. 
Now, we know the best way to pro-
tect American security and prosperity 
in Asia and to ensure that the Indo-Pa-
cific remains free and open for all is to 
maintain a credible balance of military 
power. There again, this is what the 
NDAA does. It specifically singles out 
China in that effort. 
Until now, the ability to do this was 
at risk. Now, with the NDAA, we are 
achieving the ‘‘urgent change at sig-
nificant scale’’—again, going back to 
the NDS, what it requires—and we do 
so by establishing the Pacific Deter-
rence Initiative. 
Remember, the last NDAA we had a 
year ago was the European deterrence. 
This one we have shifted to the Pacific 
Deterrence 
Initiative, 
and 
that 
is 
China and to dissuade China from its 
current trajectory of increasing aggres-
sion in the area and in that region. The 
PDI—that is the Pacific Deterrence 
Initiative—will enhance our forward 
posture in the Pacific and push the 
Pentagon to get our commanders in 
theater what they need. That is what 
we are doing now. That is what the 
NDAA is doing specifically against 
China. 
It will help us put in the right capa-
bilities and the right forces so China 
understands that there is no quick and 
easy way to have victory against us be-
cause of the NDAA and the efforts that 
we are making. 
As we speak right now, the Pacific 
Deterrence Initiative also deepens our 
cooperation with our allies and part-
ners in that region—building up the ca-
pabilities that we need to protect our-
selves and our allies in that area so 
that they know that we are with them. 
We are a team with them. 
The NDAA authorizes $2 billion this 
year for that Pacific Deterrence Initia-
tive. But more than the investment, we 
also include the tools that will help us 
make better long-term strategic deci-
sions about missions and priorities. 
We saw how well this worked in the 
European Deterrence Initiative. That 
was last year. Last year, we were con-
centrating more on Russia. This year, 
it is China. So we saw how well it 
worked in the European initiative, and 
we can now track our efforts and do 
the same thing with China in the Pa-
cific Deterrence Initiative. 
Now, with the PDI, we are sending a 
strong signal to the Chinese Com-
munist Party, as well as our partners 
and allies, that the American people 
are committed to defending our inter-
ests and values in the Indo-Pacific. 
Now, that is China we are talking 
about. 
The Pacific Deterrence Initiative 
isn’t the only way that we send this 
signal. Elsewhere in the bill, we take 
steps to strengthen our relationship 
with our critical allies and our part-
ners in the region, including Taiwan, 
India, Vietnam, and Japan. 
The bill requires the Department of 
Defense to assess how we can improve 
our operations to prevent China and 
other strategic competitors from seiz-
ing control of Taiwan and threatening 
the territorial integrity of our defense 
partners, our partners in that area. 
The NDAA also invests in the equip-
ment that will help us counter China, 
to attack submarines—this is equip-
ment that we have in the NDAA: the 
attack submarines, the precision-guid-
ed munitions—many of those, I might 
add, come from our State of Okla-
homa—the air and missile defense sys-
tems, electronic warfare equipment, 
counter-ship capabilities, and a lot 
more. All of that is in the NDAA. 
The reason I am saying this right 
now is that I think someone has misled 
the President in thinking that we were 
not really as aggressive as we should be 
in China, and we are. These are specific 
things we have never seen before. This 
is all against China. 
It invests in the innovation that will 
help us build the capabilities we need 
to take care of China in the future—the 
artificial 
intelligence; 
hypersonic 
weapons, where they are still leading 
us right now, as we speak; quantum 
computing; and directed energy and be-
yond. It is all in the NDAA bill that 
just passed through the House and 
through the Senate. 
So the NDAA takes these steps to 
support a forward posture and favor-
able balance of power, but we also have 
to defend against the full spectrum of 
their malign behavior. 
Part of the problem with China is not 
just that they are modernizing equip-
ment; it is that they are stealing our 
ideas, our technology, and then build-
ing on it. They are taking a shot at us 
and, in all of this, doing so illegally,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

December 19, 2020 
but they are doing it very effectively. 
That is what China does. 
To protect our intellectual property, 
the NDAA—this is the bill we are talk-
ing about—creates the mechanisms to 
restrict employees or former employ-
ees of the defense industrial base from 
working for companies owned by or 
under the direction of China. 
Now, this is something that has not 
been done before. We wake up and we 
find out that some of our industries 
that we are depending on for our de-
fense are very close to China, so we are 
taking steps to stop that now. 
Further, we are requiring univer-
sities to, No. 1, share information on 
defense-funded research; No. 2, disclose 
external funding for Federal grant re-
cipients, so those recipients of grants 
are not working with the Chinese; and 
No. 3, limit funding for universities 
with Confucius Institutes. 
The NDAA also directs the President 
to create a whole-of-government strat-
egy to deter China’s industrial espio-
nage and large-scale theft of personal 
information. For the first time ever, 
we will impose real costs on the PRC 
for this behavior. 
We know a big part of China’s strat-
egy is to fly under the radar. They 
don’t want us to know what they are 
doing, so we also establish numerous 
provisions that will give us a better 
look at just what China is up to—all of 
this in the NDAA. 
Right now, for instance, we don’t 
have a great sense of exactly how much 
China is spending on their national de-
fense. They lie a lot. So we task the 
DOD and federally funded research and 
development centers to conduct a full 
study of China’s defense budget. Now, 
this is something we haven’t done be-
fore. That is in the NDAA. 
We also establish an ongoing assess-
ment of China’s industrial base, require 
a list of Chinese military companies 
operating in the United States to be 
publicly shared in the Federal Reg-
ister, and mandate that recipients of 
Federal contracts disclose beneficial 
ownership. We need to know who those 
people are, and that is set up in the 
NDAA. 
Over the past few years, it has be-
come clear that we are too reliant on 
China for everything from critical ma-
terials to complex manufactured items, 
like parts of naval vessels—and even 
for medical supplies, as we saw just 
this year. The pandemic really showed 
us what happened and how vulnerable 
we are. And we are. Everybody knows 
that. 
The NDAA protects and reforms our 
defense industrial base to mitigate 
these risks and to attract new per-
formers to replace China, in other 
words, to get out of China any depend-
ence that we have on China. It is all in 
the NDAA. 
That is why the American Enterprise 
Institute, which has always been the 
conscience, declared that this is the 
toughest legislation on China in the 
last 20 years. 
Lastly, the NDAA takes steps to pro-
tect the U.S. bases overseas by requir-
ing the Secretary of Defense to notify 
Congress of how host countries using 
5G 
networks 
from 
companies 
like 
Huawei and ZTE are mitigating the se-
curity risks from these networks be-
fore we base new major weapons sys-
tems there. 
The last two NDAAs set the ball in 
motion when it comes to countering 
China, and with this NDAA, I am con-
fident that we are finally achieving the 
irreversible momentum we need to ef-
fectively implement the national de-
fense strategy against China. 
There is no turning back now. With 
this NDAA, we are sending China an 
unmistakable signal that, whether it is 
today or tomorrow, there will never be 
a good time for China to test America’s 
military. 
I will never forget that 4 years ago 
we had that meeting in Trump Tower, 
and we had 10 of us in there. We were 
talking about the military at that 
time. That is when the President be-
came convinced—that is why I know 
that it is not President Trump who is 
saying this about the National Defense 
Authorization Act; it is advice that he 
is getting from advisers who just are 
not telling him the right thing. 
Mr. President, I want you to know we 
have got our foot on the throat of 
China with our NDAA, and we are not 
going to let it up. And if any of your 
advisers tell you any different than 
this, they are not serving America 
well. 
That 
concludes—well, 
not 
quite. 
Today is a very special day. I tell ev-
erybody who cares or not—not many 
people do, but I do—this is my wife’s 
and my 61st wedding anniversary— 
today, December 19. 
On the floor of the Senate yesterday, 
I talked a little bit about that and 
made the comment that I don’t want to 
be here on my wedding anniversary, 
implying that I was not going to be 
here to vote. These votes that we are 
having right now are among the most 
critical votes that we have had, and I 
assure you I am going to be here until 
the last vote is cast. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

f 
TRIBUTE TO SERGEI KHRUSCHEV 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I pay 
tribute to the life and contributions of 
a prominent Rhode Islander, Sergei 
Khruschev. 
You may recognize his last name. His 
father, Nikita Khruschev, came to 
power after the death of Joseph Stalin 
and led the Soviet Union during some 
of the darkest days of the Cold War. 
Sergei Khruschev’s life is necessarily 
intertwined with that of his father. Yet 
Sergei was his own man and achieved 
much in his own right. 
Sergei Khruschev was born in Mos-
cow in July 1935. Naturally gifted and 
with a keen mind, he received a doc-
torate from Moscow Technical Univer-
sity. He would become an accomplished 
rocket and computer scientist, working 
on guidance systems for missiles and in 
the Soviet space program. In 1964, his 
father was removed from power and 
relegated to obscurity. During this 
time, Sergei helped his father write his 
memoirs. 
At the end of the Cold War, Sergei 
came 
to 
America 
with 
his 
wife 
Valentina and joined Brown University 
as a visiting scholar. He became a sen-
ior fellow at the Watson Institute for 
International and Public Affairs and 
taught there until his retirement in 
2012. Sergei used his considerable tal-
ents to benefit students, colleagues, 
and fellow Rhode Islanders. He gave 
generously of his time, taught at other 
institutions, and gave lectures across 
the country. 
Sergei sought to increase knowledge 
and understanding, particularly be-
tween Americans and Russians. In 1991, 
he was quoted in The Providence Jour-
nal stating, ‘‘I think it is important for 
everyone to understand that many of 
the mistakes made during the Cold War 
that led to dangerous conflicts were 
based on misconceptions and misunder-
standings . . . ’’ 
Fully embracing their new life in 
America, Sergei and Valentina re-
ceived their green cards in 1993 and be-
came citizens in 1999. Sergei was proud 
to 
become 
a 
citizen. 
Sergei 
and 
Valentina were proud members of their 
Cranston community. Sergei owned a 
large Buick for years as it reminded 
him of the cars he saw when he first 
visited America as a young man with 
his father. 
After his death, one of his colleagues 
described Sergei as ‘‘ . . . very pas-
sionate about the subjects he taught’’ 
who ‘‘managed to infect the students 
with his genuine enthusiasm and curi-
osity.’’ The colleague also said that 
even years after leaving Sergei’s class, 
students ‘‘ . . . recall [his] amazing 
combination of open-mindedness, thor-
ough knowledge of the subjects . . . 
and unassuming manner of discussion 
and debate.’’ 
It is clear that Sergei lived an 
impactful life, a life that broke down 
walls and built bridges. I offer my 
heartfelt condolences to Sergei’s wife 
Valentina, their family, and Sergei’s 
many friends, neighbors, colleagues, 
and students.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO LARRY ‘‘SKIP’’ 
AHLGREN 
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this 
week I have the honor of recognizing 
Larry ‘‘Skip’’ Ahlgren of Petroleum 
County for his dedication to his com-
munity and volunteer efforts. 
Skip currently serves as president of 
the Montana Association of State 
Grazing Districts and previously served 
as county commissioner. These titles 
are only the beginning of his service to 
Petroleum County. Skip and his wife 
Diane spend hundreds of hours volun-
teering in various community groups 
and focus putting their time into Mon-
tana’s youth. 
Winnett Agriculture Community En-
hancement and Sustainability, ACES, 
is a group cofounded by Skip that 
brings Petroleum County producers to-
gether to address the problems facing 
the environment and their community. 
The group also works with Montana’s 
youth to create opportunities that will 
bring them back to the community 
where they were raised. As farmers and 
ranchers play a key role in one of the 
most rural counties in Montana, Skip 
saw an opportunity to serve them and 
created this incredible organization. 
Skip is described by friends and col-
leagues as an all-around good guy, a 
man who embodies Montana values, 
and a true friend. It is my honor to rec-
ognize Larry ‘‘Skip’’ Ahlgren for his 
service and dedication to Petroleum 
County.∑

TRIBUTE TO DAVID W. 
ARMSTRONG, JR. 
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor the legacy of David W. 
Armstrong, Jr., of Helena, MT on the 
occasion of his 100th birthday. 
Dave is a distinguished World War II 
veteran who played a pivotal role in 
the U.S. Army’s plan to liberate Nor-
way from Nazi occupation as well as 
numerous search and rescue missions 
across northern Europe. 
Dave first came to Helena in Feb-
ruary 1943 to begin training sled and 
pack dogs at nearby Camp Rimini. 
Camp Rimini was one of only two sites 
that produced dogs for the Army’s K–9 
Corps during the war. Later, Dave 
found himself stationed in Newfound-
land, where he and his dogs partici-
pated in the recovery of downed per-
sonnel and sensitive equipment from 
aircraft wreckage sites in Greenland 
and Baffin Island. 
After the war, Dave returned to Mon-
tana with his wife Alice and founded 
the annual Race to the Sky, which pre-
serves the legacy of the soldiers and 
the dogs who served at Camp Rimini. 
Dave also preserved the legacy of this 
special program in his 2008 memoir 
‘‘Camp Rimini and Beyond.’’ Were it 
not for his efforts, the memory of this 
unique program and its special place in 
our State’s history may have been lost 
to time. 
On behalf of a grateful Nation, I want 
to thank Dave for his service to our 
State and to our Nation.∑

TRIBUTE TO NICK BUTOROVICH 
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, today I

Police Officer Nick Butorovich for his 
heroism in the face of danger.

pulled an unconscious woman from a 
rolled-over, burning car, just in time, 
saving her life. The woman suffered 
second- and third-degree burns, but be-
cause of Officer Butorovich’s quick and 
selfless actions, the driver is alive 
today. 
Butte Sheriff Ed Lester told the com-
munity, ‘‘This is an outstanding exam-
ple of a patrol officer doing his job and 
being in the right place at the right 
time. If Nick arrived 30 seconds later or 
hesitated because of the danger, this 
woman would not have survived.’’ 
When Officer Butorovich arrived at 
the scene, he saw an SUV at an inter-
section rolled over and burning—as 
other emergency personnel were on the 
way. He immediately located the driv-
er still hanging upside down by her 
seatbelt in the burning car. She was 
unconscious. 
As flames were consuming the car, 
Officer Butorovich quickly cut her free 
and dragged her to safety—without 
concern for his own personal safety. 
During the rescue, he sustained second- 
degree burns. 
Butte Fire Chief Jeff Miller also 
agreed that the driver would not have 
survived without his quick-thinking 
actions, saying, ‘‘From what my guys 
told me, when they arrived—and they 
were fairly close behind the police— 
that it wouldn’t have been long at all, 
that they most likely wouldn’t have 
been able to save her, that it would 
have been too late. He was there just in 
time, took the appropriate action and 
literally saved her life.’’ 
Officer Nick Butorovich proudly con-
tinues the tradition of law enforcement 
in his family. He is the grandson of 
former Butte Silver-Bow sheriff, the 
late Bob Butorovich, who served his 
community for more than 12 years. 
Officer Butorovich exemplifies what 
it means to serve as a law enforcement 
officer in Montana, and I thank him for 
his heroism and service.∑

TRIBUTE TO SHIRLEY ANNE 
JOHNSON 
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, today I 
have the honor of recognizing Shirley 
Anne Johnson of Missoula for her 
many decades of service to her commu-
nity through the Fraternal Order of 
the Eagles. 
Mrs. Johnson was born in Bozeman, 
MT, in 1939 and lived in several dif-
ferent communities across the State 
while growing up. She eventually set-
tled in Missoula with her husband Ted 
and became an elementary school 
teacher. During those years, she joined 
the Fraternal Order of Eagles Auxil-
iary and rose through the ranks, even-
tually chairing her local auxiliary club 
and becoming grand auxiliary presi-
dent for the State of Montana. 
During her work for the Eagles, Shir-
ley donated much of her time to the 
creation and maintenance of Missoula 
Manor Homes, a nonprofit retirement 
home for seniors in need. Shirley and 
her husband were involved in Missoula 
Manor Homes from the very beginning. 
They played a direct role in securing 
land and overseeing its construction. 
In later years, she donated her time to 
Missoula Manor Homes bake sales 
every month, raising money for the 
residents of the facility. 
Mrs. Johnson continues to serve her 
community, volunteering for the Mis-
soula Food Bank and remaining in-
volved with the Eagles. She has 10 
grandchildren 
and 
18 
great-grand-
children. In October, she was honored 
with the Legion of Honor Award by the 
Chapel of the Four Chaplains for her 
nearly six decades of community serv-
ice. 
Shirley Anne Johnson embodies the 
spirit of community that is so common 
across Montana. I congratulate Shirley 
and thank her for steadfast commit-
ment to service.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO GEORGE MCCLURE 
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, today I 
have the honor of recognizing Mr. 
George McClure of Gallatin County for 
his decades of service to the Bozeman 
community, including his 25 years as a 
volunteer 
at 
Hospice 
of 
Bozeman 
Health. 
George spent his career as a professor 
of architecture at Montana State Uni-
versity. After many years of educating 
our State’s next generation of archi-
tects, he retired in the mid-1900s. Yet 
his service to the community was not 
finished. 
Once he retired, he began volun-
teering at Hospice of Bozeman Health. 
For the last 25 years, George has shown 
up to volunteer every single Tuesday. 
His volunteer work focuses on adminis-
trative and paperwork jobs, allowing 
the nurses and other staff to be more 
focused on patient care. The staff say 
of George that ‘‘he magically gets it 
done’’ and that ‘‘he is the wind beneath 
our wings.’’ 
Even the COVID–19 pandemic has not 
slowed George down. Despite the poten-
tial risk to his own health, he has con-
tinued to show up every Tuesday 
throughout the pandemic to do his vol-
unteer work. His presence always gives 
the staff at Hospice of Bozeman Health 
a much needed morale boost as they 
deal with the grim reality of the pan-
demic and continue to care for pa-
tients. 
I thank George for his tireless service 
and his courage to carry on despite the 
hardship of the pandemic. He exempli-
fies what it means to put service before 
self.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. REED (for himself and 
Mr. TESTER): 
S. 5072. A bill to improve Vet Centers 
for the Department of Veterans Affairs, 
and for other purposes; to the Com-
mittee on Veterans’ Affairs. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, as many of 
my colleagues know, the transition 
from deployment to civilian life is fre-
quently difficult. Vet Centers, created 
in the wake of the Vietnam War, are 
community-based centers that were de-
signed to provide critical services for 
veterans, service members, and their 
families. Today, there is a need to en-
hance these Centers to realize that 
original vision—which is why I am in-
troducing the Vet Center Improvement 
Act. 
This legislation is an outgrowth of a 
Government 
Accountability 
Office 
(GAO) 
investigation 
that 
Senator 
TESTER and I requested into allega-
tions that changes to performance 
metrics at Vet Centers may have nega-
tively impacted care and additional 
concerns that he and I had about their 
staffing practices. The subsequent GAO 
report concluded that recent changes 
‘‘have the potential to negatively af-
fect care and create undue burden and 
stress on counselors providing that 
care at some Vet Centers.’’ This report 
included recommendations to improve 
care, transparency, and hiring and 
staffing methods that form the founda-
tion for our legislation. 
Specifically, the Vet Center Improve-
ment Act requires periodic review and 
reform of performance standards at Vet 
Centers; the creation and periodic re-
evaluation of a staffing model, along 
with standardization of position de-
scriptions and responsibilities across 
Vet Centers; the creation of a working 
group to implement changes to im-
prove quality of care for veterans and 
recruitment and retention of staff; and 
the GAO to review Vet Center infra-
structure and examine what future in-
vestments are needed. 
Additionally, our legislation creates 
a pilot program to provide grants to 
combat food insecurity and provide 
necessary heating and cooling assist-
ance to veterans and their families. 
Food insecurity and the need for heat-
ing assistance are growing issues for 
veterans and others as a result of the 
pandemic. 
I 
would 
like 
to 
thank 
Senator 
TESTER for not only the attention he 
has paid to this issue as Ranking Mem-
ber of the Senate Veterans Affairs 
Committee, but also for joining with 
me on this important legislation. Our 
legislation has received support from 
such organizations as the Veterans of 
Foreign Wars (VFW), American Vet-
erans (AMVETS), Disabled American 
Veterans (DAV), National Community 
Action Foundation (NCAF), National 
Association for State Community Serv-
ices Programs (NASCSP), the National 
Energy & Utility Affordability Coali-
tion (NEUAC), and the URI Feinstein 
Center for a Hunger Free America. I 
look forward to continuing our part-
nership on this and other measures to 
improve care for our veterans, and I 
hope our colleagues will join us in this 
endeavor.

TEXT OF AMENDMENTS 
SA 2719. Mr. GARDNER (for Mr. 
LANKFORD) proposed an amendment to 
the resolution S. Res. 458, calling for 
the global repeal of blasphemy, heresy, 
and apostasy laws; as follows: 
Strike all after the resolving clause and in-
sert the following: ‘‘That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes that blasphemy, heresy, and 
apostasy laws inappropriately position gov-
ernments as arbiters of religious truth and 
empower officials to impose religious dogma 
on individuals or minorities through the 
power of the government or through violence 
sanctioned by the government; 
(2) calls on the President and the Secretary 
of State to encourage the repeal of blas-
phemy, heresy, and apostasy in bilateral dis-
cussions between the United States and all 
countries that have such laws, through di-
rect interventions in bilateral and multilat-
eral fora; 
(3) encourages the President and the Sec-
retary of State to oppose— 
(A) any efforts, by the United Nations or 
by other international or multilateral fora, 
to create an international anti-blasphemy 
norm, such as the ‘‘defamation of religions’’ 
resolutions introduced in the United Nations 
between 1999 and 2010; and 
(B) any attempts to expand the inter-
national norm on incitement to include blas-
phemy or defamation of religions; 
(4) supports efforts by the United Nations 
to combat intolerance, discrimination, or vi-
olence against persons based on religion or 
belief without restricting expression, includ-
ing United Nations Human Rights Council 
Resolution 16/18 (2011) and the Istanbul Proc-
ess meetings pursuant to such resolution, 
that are consistent with the First Amend-
ment to the Constitution; 
(5) calls on the President and the Secretary 
of State to designate countries that enforce 
blasphemy, heresy, or apostasy laws as 
‘‘countries of particular concern for religious 
freedom’’ under section 402(b)(1)(A)(ii) of the 
International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 
(22 U.S.C. 6442(b)(1)(A)(ii)) for engaging in or 
tolerating severe violations of religious free-
dom, as a result of the abuses flowing from 
the enforcement of such laws and from 
unpunished vigilante violence often gen-
erated by blasphemy allegations; 
(6) urges the governments of countries that 
enforce blasphemy, heresy, or apostasy laws 
to allow for freedom of religion and expres-
sion and amend or repeal such laws, as they 
provide pretext and impunity for vigilante 
violence against religious minorities; and 
(7) urges the governments of countries that 
have prosecuted, imprisoned, and persecuted 
people on charges of blasphemy, heresy, or 
apostasy to release such people uncondition-
ally and, once released, to ensure their safe-
ty and that of their families. 
SA 2720. Mr. GARDNER (for Mr. 
LANKFORD) proposed an amendment to 
the resolution S. Res. 458, calling for 
the global repeal of blasphemy, heresy, 
and apostasy laws; as follows: 
Strike the preamble and insert the fol-
lowing: 
Whereas Article 18 of the Universal Dec-
laration 
of 
Human 
Rights 
states 
that 
‘‘[e]veryone has the right to freedom of 
thought, conscience and religion; this right 
includes freedom to change his religion or 
belief, and freedom, either alone or in com-
munity with others and in public or private, 
to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, 
practice, worship and observance’’; 
Whereas many countries continue to have 
criminal blasphemy laws, and many punish 
people who engage in expression deemed by 
the government to be blasphemous, heret-
ical, apostate, defamatory of religion, or in-
sulting to religion or to religious symbols, 
figures, or feelings, and such punishment can 
include fines, imprisonment, and capital 
punishment including by beheading; 
Whereas blasphemy laws have affected 
Christians, Muslims, Jews, Hindus, Baha’i, 
secularists, and many other groups, are in-
consistent with international human rights 
standards because they establish and pro-
mote official religious orthodoxy and dogma 
over individual liberty, and often result in 
violations 
of 
the 
freedoms 
of 
religion, 
thought, and expression that are protected 
under international instruments, including 
Articles 18 and 19 of the International Cov-
enant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR); 
Whereas the United Nations Human Rights 
Committee stated in General Comment 34 
that ‘‘[p]rohibitions of displays of lack of re-
spect for a religion or other belief system, 
including blasphemy laws, are incompatible 
with the [ICCPR].’’; 
Whereas the United States Commission on 
International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) 
has found that blasphemy charges are often 
based on false accusations, are used for sec-
tarian or political purposes, and foster reli-
gious intolerance, discrimination, and vio-
lence; 
Whereas USCIRF has found that at least 84 
countries had blasphemy laws as of 2020;

Whereas USCIRF has identified 41 coun-
tries that have taken enforcement action in 
674 criminal blasphemy cases between 2014 
and 2018; 
Whereas these laws were enforced in 15 
Middle East and North African countries, 14 
Asia-Pacific countries, 7 European countries, 
and 5 Sub-Saharan African countries be-
tween 2014 and 2018; 
Whereas Pakistan, Iran, Russia, India, 
Egypt, Indonesia, Yemen, Bangladesh, Saudi 
Arabia, and Kuwait account for more than 81 
percent of all reported cases of state crimi-
nal blasphemy enforcement; 
Whereas USCIRF has found that the three 
countries without an official state religion 
that have the highest state enforcement of 
blasphemy laws are Russia, India, and Indo-
nesia; 
Whereas the Pew Research Center found 
that countries with laws against blasphemy, 
apostasy, or defamation of religion were 
more likely to have severe governmental re-
strictions on religion, and to experience so-
cial hostilities based on religion, than coun-
tries that did not have such laws; 
Whereas restrictive laws beyond those pe-
nalizing blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy 
further limit religious freedom, such as ex-
tremism laws— 
(1) in Russia that have been used to ban Je-
hovah’s Witnesses as an extremist organiza-
tion and fueled persecution of this religious 
group; 
(2) in China, to arbitrarily detain an esti-
mated 800,000 to 2,000,000 Uighur Muslims in 
internment camps because they followed Is-
lamic rituals and practices; and 
(3) in North Korea, to detain an estimated 
50,000 to 70,000 Christians in labor camps be-
cause they followed the tenets of Christi-
anity; 
Whereas an international group of experts 
convened by the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights rec-
ommended in 2012 that ‘‘[s]tates that have 
blasphemy laws should repeal the[m] as such 
laws have a stifling impact on the enjoyment 
of freedom of religion or belief and healthy 
dialogue and debate about religion.’’; 
Whereas blasphemy laws are inconsistent 
with United Nations resolutions adopted by 
consensus since 2011 recognizing that reli-
gious intolerance is best fought through 
positive measures, such as education, out-
reach, and counter-speech, and that crim-
inalization of speech is warranted only for 
the prevention of imminent violence; 
Whereas, according to the annual religious 
freedom report published by the Department 
of State in 2015, attackers in Bangladesh 
killed 
five 
allegedly 
anti-Islamic 
or 
secularist writers and publishers, and injured 
three others; 
Whereas, in response to these killings, the 
Home Minister of Bangladesh, rather than 
condemning the murders, called on bloggers 
and others to refrain from writings that 
could hurt the religious feelings of others 
and added that violators of the warning 
would be subject to prosecution under the re-
strictive religious freedom laws of Ban-
gladesh; 
Whereas a 2016 report by USCIRF on Ban-
gladesh found that religious and civil society 
groups fear that increasing religious extre-
mism will result in more criminal attacks 
and threats; 
Whereas restrictive religious freedom laws 
validate and promote social violence tar-
geted at religious minorities and dissenters, 
whether Christian, Muslim, secularist, or 
other; 
Whereas more than one-quarter of reported 
cases implicated alleged blasphemous speech 
posted on social media platforms; 
Whereas USCIRF has found that in Paki-
stan, blasphemy laws have been used to pros-
ecute and persecute Muslims, Christians, 
secularists, and others; 
Whereas, according to a Pew Center report 
on religion and public life, Pakistan stands 
out for having one of the highest levels of re-
strictions on religion when both government 
restrictions and social hostilities are taken 
into account; 
Whereas, as of May 2020, USCIRF was 
aware of approximately 40 individuals on 
death row for blasphemy in Pakistan or serv-
ing life sentences; 
Whereas Asia Bibi was sentenced to death 
for blasphemy in 2010 and was held on death 
row for 8 years, until the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan overturned her conviction in 2018, 
upheld her acquittal, and granted her per-
mission to leave the country to flee the 
threats against her in 2019; 
Whereas Pakistan selectively enforces the 
blasphemy and anti-terrorism laws against 
minority religious groups, including by spe-
cifically targeting Ahmadiyya Muslims such 
as Abdul Shakoor, an 82-year old optician 
and bookseller who was recently released 
after serving over three years in prison on 
such charges; 
Whereas, on July 29, 2020, Tahir Ahmad 
Naseem, a United States citizen, was shot 
and killed in a courtroom while on trial for 
blasphemy; 
Whereas, in 2017, the Christian Governor of 
Jakarta, Indonesia, was convicted for blas-
phemy of Islam and sentenced to two years 
in jail; 
Whereas several countries that previously 
maintained blasphemy laws have recently 
removed these provisions, including Iceland, 
Norway, Malta, Denmark, Ireland, Canada, 
New Zealand, Greece, and Scotland; 
Whereas blasphemy laws in the United 
States were invalidated by the adoption of 
the First Amendment to the Constitution, 
which protects the freedoms of thought, con-
science, expression, and religious exercise; 
and 
Whereas the United States has become a 
beacon of religious freedom and tolerance 
around the world: Now, therefore, be it

December 19, 2020 
Arabia, and Kuwait account for more than 81 
percent of all reported cases of state crimi-
nal blasphemy enforcement; 
Whereas USCIRF has found that the three 
countries without an official state religion 
that have the highest state enforcement of 
blasphemy laws are Russia, India, and Indo-
nesia; 
Whereas the Pew Research Center found 
that countries with laws against blasphemy, 
apostasy, or defamation of religion were 
more likely to have severe governmental re-
strictions on religion, and to experience so-
cial hostilities based on religion, than coun-
tries that did not have such laws; 
Whereas restrictive laws beyond those pe-
nalizing blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy 
further limit religious freedom, such as ex-
tremism laws— 
(1) in Russia that have been used to ban Je-
hovah’s Witnesses as an extremist organiza-
tion and fueled persecution of this religious 
group; 
(2) in China, to arbitrarily detain an esti-
mated 800,000 to 2,000,000 Uighur Muslims in 
internment camps because they followed Is-
lamic rituals and practices; and 
(3) in North Korea, to detain an estimated 
50,000 to 70,000 Christians in labor camps be-
cause they followed the tenets of Christi-
anity; 
Whereas an international group of experts 
convened by the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights rec-
ommended in 2012 that ‘‘[s]tates that have 
blasphemy laws should repeal the[m] as such 
laws have a stifling impact on the enjoyment 
of freedom of religion or belief and healthy 
dialogue and debate about religion.’’; 
Whereas blasphemy laws are inconsistent 
with United Nations resolutions adopted by 
consensus since 2011 recognizing that reli-
gious intolerance is best fought through 
positive measures, such as education, out-
reach, and counter-speech, and that crim-
inalization of speech is warranted only for 
the prevention of imminent violence; 
Whereas, according to the annual religious 
freedom report published by the Department 
of State in 2015, attackers in Bangladesh 
killed 
five 
allegedly 
anti-Islamic 
or 
secularist writers and publishers, and injured 
three others; 
Whereas, in response to these killings, the 
Home Minister of Bangladesh, rather than 
condemning the murders, called on bloggers 
and others to refrain from writings that 
could hurt the religious feelings of others 
and added that violators of the warning 
would be subject to prosecution under the re-
strictive religious freedom laws of Ban-
gladesh; 
Whereas a 2016 report by USCIRF on Ban-
gladesh found that religious and civil society 
groups fear that increasing religious extre-
mism will result in more criminal attacks 
and threats; 
Whereas restrictive religious freedom laws 
validate and promote social violence tar-
geted at religious minorities and dissenters, 
whether Christian, Muslim, secularist, or 
other; 
Whereas more than one-quarter of reported 
cases implicated alleged blasphemous speech 
posted on social media platforms; 
Whereas USCIRF has found that in Paki-
stan, blasphemy laws have been used to pros-
ecute and persecute Muslims, Christians, 
secularists, and others; 
Whereas, according to a Pew Center report 
on religion and public life, Pakistan stands 
out for having one of the highest levels of re-
strictions on religion when both government 
restrictions and social hostilities are taken 
into account; 
Whereas, as of May 2020, USCIRF was 
aware of approximately 40 individuals on 
death row for blasphemy in Pakistan or serv-
ing life sentences; 
Whereas Asia Bibi was sentenced to death 
for blasphemy in 2010 and was held on death 
row for 8 years, until the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan overturned her conviction in 2018, 
upheld her acquittal, and granted her per-
mission to leave the country to flee the 
threats against her in 2019; 
Whereas Pakistan selectively enforces the 
blasphemy and anti-terrorism laws against 
minority religious groups, including by spe-
cifically targeting Ahmadiyya Muslims such 
as Abdul Shakoor, an 82-year old optician 
and bookseller who was recently released 
after serving over three years in prison on 
such charges; 
Whereas, on July 29, 2020, Tahir Ahmad 
Naseem, a United States citizen, was shot 
and killed in a courtroom while on trial for 
blasphemy; 
Whereas, in 2017, the Christian Governor of 
Jakarta, Indonesia, was convicted for blas-
phemy of Islam and sentenced to two years 
in jail; 
Whereas several countries that previously 
maintained blasphemy laws have recently 
removed these provisions, including Iceland, 
Norway, Malta, Denmark, Ireland, Canada, 
New Zealand, Greece, and Scotland; 
Whereas blasphemy laws in the United 
States were invalidated by the adoption of 
the First Amendment to the Constitution, 
which protects the freedoms of thought, con-
science, expression, and religious exercise; 
and 
Whereas the United States has become a 
beacon of religious freedom and tolerance 
around the world: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes that blasphemy, heresy, and 
apostasy laws inappropriately position gov-
ernments as arbiters of religious truth and 
empower officials to impose religious dogma 
on individuals or minorities through the 
power of the government or through violence 
sanctioned by the government; 
(2) calls on the President and the Secretary 
of State to encourage the repeal of blas-
phemy, heresy, and apostasy in bilateral dis-
cussions between the United States and all 
countries that have such laws, through di-
rect interventions in bilateral and multilat-
eral fora; 
(3) encourages the President and the Sec-
retary of State to oppose— 
(A) any efforts, by the United Nations or 
by other international or multilateral fora, 
to create an international anti-blasphemy 
norm, such as the ‘‘defamation of religions’’ 
resolutions introduced in the United Nations 
between 1999 and 2010; and 
(B) any attempts to expand the inter-
national norm on incitement to include blas-
phemy or defamation of religions; 
(4) supports efforts by the United Nations 
to combat intolerance, discrimination, or vi-
olence against persons based on religion or 
belief without restricting expression, includ-
ing United Nations Human Rights Council 
Resolution 16/18 (2011) and the Istanbul Proc-
ess meetings pursuant to such resolution, 
that are consistent with the First Amend-
ment to the Constitution; 
(5) calls on the President and the Secretary 
of State to designate countries that enforce 
blasphemy, heresy, or apostasy laws as 
‘‘countries of particular concern for religious 
freedom’’ under section 402(b)(1)(A)(ii) of the 
International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 
(22 U.S.C. 6442(b)(1)(A)(ii)) for engaging in or 
tolerating severe violations of religious free-
dom, as a result of the abuses flowing from 
the enforcement of such laws and from 
unpunished vigilante violence often gen-
erated by blasphemy allegations; 
(6) urges the governments of countries that 
enforce blasphemy, heresy, or apostasy laws 
to allow for freedom of religion and expres-
sion and amend or repeal such laws, as they 
provide pretext and impunity for vigilante 
violence against religious minorities; and 
(7) urges the governments of countries that 
have prosecuted, imprisoned, and persecuted 
people on charges of blasphemy, heresy, or 
apostasy to release such people uncondition-
ally and, once released, to ensure their safe-
ty and that of their families.
