THANKING 
DEB 
DETMERS 
FANSLER, STEVE TOMASZEWSKI, 
AND RODNEY DAVIS FOR THEIR 
SERVICE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. SHIMKUS) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, Deb 
Detmers Fansler, Steve Tomaszewski, 
and RODNEY DAVIS were all with me po-
litically and governmentally for 24 
years. It is now my time to thank 
them. 
All three have been great public serv-
ants. All three are political addicts. 
Deb is another Western Illinois grad 
with a political science degree. A farm 
girl 
from 
Petersburg, 
she 
rapidly 
moved up in Illinois Republican circles. 
After I got elected in 1996, I asked her 
to run my district office. 
In the Army, the commander is re-
sponsible for all their unit does or fails 
to do. This was Deb’s job: running the 
district office. I have represented the 
20th Congressional District, the 19th 
Congressional District, and the 15th 
Congressional District. In total, I have 
represented 52 of the State’s 102 coun-
ties. 
I have had district offices in Collins-
ville, Maryville, Springfield, Danville, 
Effingham, Centralia, Olney, and Har-
risburg. Deb was responsible for all of 
them. 
District offices permit drop-by access 
to constituents. For me, the district 
staff also handles all the casework. 
They are the jumping-off sites for con-
gressional stops throughout the year. I 
will cover the incredible success story 
of my caseworkers in the future. Some-
one has to lead, encourage, and support 
the caseworkers, and Deb has done 
that. 
Deb also has had the difficult task of 
organizing my schedule back in the dis-
trict. Getting from point A to point B 
on time is difficult. Getting from A to 
B to C to D to E in the same day and 
on time is nearly impossible, but we 
did it almost always. We shocked peo-
ple with our punctuality and some-
times even arriving early. 
Deb was also my mother, confessor 
and counselor. No one knows the play-
ing field better than Deb, and she 
quickly and briefly and succinctly got 
me up to speed. She knows everything 
from the courthouse to the statehouse. 
She was given the tough individual 
cases to handle. You really didn’t want 
to tangle with her. 
Steve worked on my 1996 campaign 
and was my press secretary and then 
joined as my congressional press sec-
retary. 
Steve graduated from the University 
of Illinois, majoring in journalism. His 
parents owned and operated the local 
Nashville, Illinois, newspaper. 
Steve was the perfect guy in the 
early days because, at that time in 
rural America, local print was still 
king. Steve understood that. Steve 
helped us adjust to the changing media 
dynamics. As local media started to de-
cline, the St. Louis media became more 
important. 
With the advent of social media, the 
turnaround time had to be instanta-
neous if you were going to respond at 
all. I believe much of my early reelec-
tion success was the extra tender lov-
ing care that Steve provided to the 
media outlets, both big and small. 
Steve then moved to the economic de-
velopment role once RODNEY left. 
As my districts became larger, trav-
eling with me consumed a lot of time. 
Deb’s planning made this travel effi-
cient but still long. I was only com-
fortable traveling with Deb and Steve. 
I trusted them to get me where I need-
ed to go and keep me on time. 
These long car rides allowed me to 
talk to them about everything. They 
would hear me on phone calls, and I 
could debrief them on what was on my 
mind. They could also use the time to 
see what was on my mind. Being cap-
tured in the car, they had to listen to 
my ranting and raving. 
My drive-through meal is a McDon-
ald’s number 1. They always had Diet 
Cokes 
and 
chocolates 
strategically 
placed in the car for when we did not 
have time for lunch, or I needed choco-
late for my mental health. 
One day, RODNEY will finish his own 
story, so I will not end it here. A 
Taylorville boy, RODNEY was my Chris-
tian County coordinator in 1992. We 
were both candidates in 1996. I won, and 
RODNEY lost his race for State rep-
resentative. 
He joined our team as our economic 
development coordinator. He rode that

success into a successful run for Con-

Deb, Steve, and RODNEY gave their 
blood, sweat, and tears to me for 24 
years. Some say that they still do. I 
want to thank them here today.

GET SERIOUS ABOUT FUNDING 
STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Connecticut (Mr. COURTNEY) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, one of 
the most dynamic and striking figures 
in 
American 
history 
was 
General 
George Patton. He was famous for say-
ing: Lead, follow, or get out of the way. 
Mr. Speaker, those words were given 
at a time of world crisis when he was 
leading 
the 
Third 
Army 
through 
France and Germany and still ring true 
today. We are in a world crisis. 
This morning, the government re-
leased its GDP numbers, and it showed 
that, in the second quarter, the U.S. 
economy shrunk by 10 percent. That is 
the largest number since the govern-
ment started recording GDP numbers 
since 1947. Annualized, that is a 33 per-
cent hit to the economy. 
What is even more, I think, con-
cerning, is that the new numbers in 
terms of new first-time unemployment 
claims this morning grew again this 
past week to 1.43 million claims. 
Yesterday, the Chairman of the Fed-
eral Reserve Board, Jerome Powell, 
foot-stomped the fact that not just the 
numbers from last quarter are of con-
cern, but, again, looking out in the fu-
ture, the Federal Reserve sees trouble 
ahead. The amount of credit card activ-
ity is dropping, and again, as I said, 
new first-time claims are growing. 
Mr. Speaker, Mr. Powell, back in 
May, warned us that the CARES Act 
was not going to be enough. This econ-
omy needed more fiscal stimulus, and 
the House did show leadership because 
we passed the HEROES Act, which was 
a package of fiscal measures whose cor-
nerstone was extending unemployment 
compensation and State and local as-
sistance, again, following the lead of 
the Federal Reserve Board Chairman, 
who said that those are the most effi-
cient ways to make sure that this 
economy does not falter. 
Well, here we are today, finally, after 
the Senate responded with sort of a 
package, which, again, is completely 
missing any relief for State and local 
government and which has this con-
voluted 
unemployment 
extension, 
which 
Secretary 
Scalia, 
President 
Trump’s own Secretary of Labor, said 
would take 8 weeks for State govern-
ment departments of labor to imple-
ment. 
It is totally inadequate, totally in-
sufficient to deal with the magnitude 
of the challenge. Again, when we look 
at State and local assistance, there is 
not a Member in this body who does 
not have a board of education, a local 
council, or a finance board that is 
struggling with making sure that pub-
lic safety, public education, and public 
works are going to continue because 
revenue is cratering just the way the 
government showed this morning that 
the economy is cratering. 
We have this debate about defunding 
the police. Not voting for the HEROES 
Act was, de facto, defunding the police. 
How are local governments, which pri-
marily fund police departments, going 
to have the resources in this economy 
to make sure that people’s public safe-
ty ranks are, in fact, protected? 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
MCCONNELL’s 
plan, 
which he released earlier in week, his 
own people called it a mess, a mis-
take—TED CRUZ. The President said it 
is semi-irrelevant. 
It is time to wake up and get serious. 
The blueprint is there with the HE-
ROES Act, in terms of making sure 
that we heed the warnings of President 
Trump’s 
own 
economic 
advisers— 
Chairman Powell—and look at these 
numbers this morning: historic, jaw- 
dropping. 
We need to act. It is time to listen to 
General Patton: Lead, follow, or get 
out of the way. 
f 
RESILIENCY OF FLORIDIANS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. SPANO) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and honor the resil-
iency of the people of my home State 
of Florida. 
Floridians have long been recognized 
for their ability to persevere amidst 
crisis and hardships. From hurricanes 
to flash floods, from war efforts to 
pandemics, our homestead is the most 
resilient place in the world, but it is 
the people who make it truly special. 
During these difficult days, I have 
traveled throughout our district, meet-
ing unsung heroes in our communities. 
From first responders and medical per-
sonnel risking their lives and health to 
small business owners adjusting to con-
tinue serving their community, the 
dedication and passion for others and 
for our community is truly inspiring. 
It is during trying times that we 
truly get to know who we are, what we 
are made of. And I can tell you this: 
The good people of Florida 15 stand 
strong. 
Whether 
you 
live 
or 
work 
in 
Hillsborough, Polk, or Lake Counties, 
you know how special our district and 
Main Streets truly are. So today, I 
thought I would take just a moment to 
say thank you to all those who make 
Florida 15 what we call it, our home. 
HONORING LAKELAND CITY MANAGER TONY 
DELGADO 
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Mr. Tony Delgado 
for his 23 years of service to the city of 
Lakeland, Florida. 
Mr. Delgado began his service to city 
residents in 1997 as a facilities assist-
ant director and, through hard work 
and dedication, quickly climbed the 
ranks to become Lakeland’s city man-
ager, known as someone who is ap-
proachable and always accessible to his 
colleagues, his staff, and the city’s 
residents. 
Mr. Delgado leaves behind a legacy of 
accomplishments, 
an 
impact 
that 
won’t soon be forgotten. Mr. Delgado 
has always been known as someone 
who builds bridges and brings people 
together. In my time of knowing him 
and his team, they have been nothing 
but helpful and professional, exuding 
the values of our district. 
A loving and devoted husband to his 
wife, Robin, I want to wish them both 
the very, very best in the next chapter 
of their lives. 
Tony, all the best to you. From the 
bottom of my heart, thank you for 
your hard work and your dedication. 
Lakeland is a better city, a better com-
munity, because of your selfless serv-
ice. 
SUPPORTING BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, today, I 
rise to once again express my full sup-
port of President Trump’s efforts to se-
cure our borders, restore law and order, 
and complete the wall on our south-
western border. 
Since I joined Congress, time and 
time again, Democrats in this Chamber 
and their allies have sought to stop the 
President from securing our borders 
and protecting the American people. 
Even this week, Democratic leader-
ship has continued this attack on the 
President and on the American people. 
In multiple portions of the bills meant 
to fund the government next year, 
Democrats have not only prohibited 
funds from being used to build the wall, 
but they have also sought to rescind 
funds already allocated for border secu-
rity by President Trump. 
I have traveled to the border myself, 
and I will tell you this: Walls work. 
And the Border Patrol officers I spoke 
with when I was there agree: Walls 
work. 
According to Customs and Border 
Protection, during the first 6 months of 
2020 this year, 180,000 people were ap-
prehended or deemed inadmissible. In 
2019, last year, during the same period, 
this number was almost 600,000. That is 
a reduction of 416,000 people, or a whop-
ping 70 percent. 
A more secure border means safer 
communities across America, and as of 
July 27, 256 miles of the border wall 
system has been completed. 
As our Nation experiences social un-
rest from coast to coast, it is critical 
that we restore law and order, to in-
clude our borders. President Trump has 
pledged to continue to do just that, and 
I am proud to stand with him in this 
effort.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3987 
July 30, 2020 
Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in honor and in memory of Chauncey 
Lee Veatch III. 
Chauncey was a natural leader with 
an incredible passion for life, edu-
cation, and helping others. He was a 
tremendous 
educator, 
a 
lieutenant 
colonel in the United States Army, Na-
tional Teacher of the Year, and a men-
tor to so many in the Coachella Valley. 
It was a high privilege to call him my 
friend. 
Chauncey personally inspired me, en-
couraged me, and guided me as well as 
my friend and current assembly mem-
ber, Eduardo Garcia, and Riverside 
County Supervisor Manny Perez and 
many students and teachers from the 
Coachella Valley. 
Chauncey 
was 
exceptionally 
bril-
liant. His brother, Gregory, said, even 
in middle school, his teachers knew he 
was smarter than they were. 
He paired his unique intelligence and 
gifts with an extraordinary work ethic. 
He studied history at the University of 
the Pacific in Stockton, where he was 
inspired by the civil rights work of 
Cesar Chavez, and helped register vot-
ers as a United Farm Workers volun-
teer. 
After college, he went on to the Uni-
versity of Notre Dame, where he ob-
tained 
his 
juris 
doctor 
degree. 
Chauncey then served in the U.S. Army 
Infantry and the Medical Service Corps 
for over 20 years, retiring in 1995 as a 
lieutenant colonel. 
After 
retiring 
from 
the 
Army, 
Chauncey began his service as an edu-
cator 
at 
John 
Kelley 
Elementary 
School in Thermal, California, later be-
coming a teacher at my alma mater, 
Coachella 
Valley 
High 
School. 
Coachella Valley Unified School Dis-
trict was fortunate to have such a de-
voted and fine man. 
As a teacher, he was renowned for his 
ability to present complex material to 
his students in simple, understandable 
ways and to mentor each of them on an 
individual 
basis, 
helping 
them 
to 
achieve their fullest potential. 
Later in life, Chauncey served on The 
Desert Sun newspaper’s editorial board 
for more than 7 years. In 2010, he co-led 
the Coachella Valley Healthcare Initia-
tive with me, bringing together the 
community to address the healthcare 
access crisis in our disadvantaged and 
underserved communities. 
In each of his endeavors, he gave ev-
erything he had. In a word, Chauncey’s 
life was full: full of joy, full of gen-
erosity, and full of love. He saw the 
best in people. 
Not only that, he drew out the best 
in people. He saw in others what they 
did not see in themselves, and he would 
not rest until he helped them achieve 
what he knew they were capable of. In 
fact, a lot of people are where they are 
today because their paths crossed with 
Chauncey’s. 
He helped many of his students 
achieve their dreams of becoming a 
teacher. Serving disadvantaged stu-
dents, he also helped many become the 
first in their generation to go to col-
lege, even helping them get into good 
schools and elite schools like Notre 
Dame and Harvard. 
His leadership was in his acts, his 
words, and his presence. He showed 
people the way. His brother called him 
a builder of dreams. I call him an ar-
chitect of goodness whose deep com-
mitment and mentorship to his stu-
dents turned barriers into opportuni-
ties, disadvantages into strengths, and 
transformed our communities for gen-
erations to come. 
Our world has lost a light, our com-
munity has lost a leader, and I have 
lost a mentor and a close friend. Today 
I mourn with his family and celebrate 
his full life, knowing that he was a 
good man, an outstanding citizen, and 
a veteran whose impact will live on in 
our communities. My wife, Monica, and 
I will miss him very much.

THANK YOU TO PA–15 
CONSTITUENTS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight 
several of my constituents who have 
gone out of their way to make a posi-
tive impact during the coronavirus 
pandemic. 
Over the past few months, it has been 
easy to feel surrounded by nothing but 
negative news. In an effort to highlight 
the good news that we weren’t seeing 
enough of, I started a social media 
campaign called PA–15 Cares. PA–15 
Cares highlights all of the volunteers 
who have gone above and beyond dur-
ing this pandemic to lend a helping 
hand, to help their neighbors in need, 
and to brighten the spirits of all those 
impacted by COVID–19. Today, Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to share a few ex-
amples of those who rose to the occa-
sion during this pandemic. 
Many chose to make masks for front-
line workers, including high school stu-
dent Morgan McConnell of Cambria 
County. While her school was closed, 
Morgan made good use of her time and 
made more than 500 masks in just the 
first week. It is her way of helping oth-
ers, and she has given many of the 
masks to local hospital employees free 
of charge. 
Selfless small business owners, even 
those who may be struggling finan-
cially as a result of the pandemic, have 
stopped to ask: How can I help? 
Rick Ardini, owner of Rik-N-Nik’s 
restaurant in Ebensburg, has provided 
countless meals for those out of work, 
children, the elderly, and anyone else 
who needed them. He also gave great 
advice: ‘‘Talk to each other, learn 
about each other, spend some time, and 
play some games. Be a family. Slow 
life down.’’ 
Another small business which also 
happens to be in Ebensburg has been 
providing a critical service for the first 
responders. SERVPRO partnered with 
the Dauntless Volunteer Fire Depart-
ment to provide free cleaning and sani-
tation services for emergency response 
vehicles. 
The Girl Scouts of Western Pennsyl-
vania have also stepped up to give back 
to their community. They have started 
a Hometown Heroes program to give 
free cookies to frontline workers, in-
cluding medical professionals, first re-
sponders, nursing home staff, the Army 
National Guard, and more. 
Lastly, I would like to highlight 
Samantha 
Schrecengost 
of 
Punx-
sutawney. Samantha, a Senior Corps 
volunteer, and the folks at Community 
Action started a Phone-A-Friend pro-
gram for seniors. Due to COVID–19, 
many elderly Americans have been cut 
off from loved ones, and isolation can 
take a mental and emotional toll. Vol-
unteers of the Phone-A-Friend program 
call seniors two to three times a week 
to check in, see how they can be help-
ful, and just share a few minutes of 
friendly conversation with our seniors. 
Mr. Speaker, I am encouraged to see 
how the communities in my district 
have come together in such an unprece-
dented time of crisis to find a way to 
support one another. 
f 
SALUTING EARLY EDUCATORS 
AND CHILDCARE WORKERS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Massachusetts (Mrs. TRAHAN) for 5 
minutes. 
Mrs. TRAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
salute 
the 
early 
educators 
and 
childcare workers who have sacrificed 
so much for our children and their par-
ents across the Nation throughout this 
pandemic. 
As a working mom, I know how crit-
ical they are to our families and to our 
economy. The fact is, had our childcare 
workers not done their part, many 
other 
essential 
workers 
like 
our 
nurses, 
firefighters, 
police 
officers, 
postal workers, food service and sanita-
tion employees, and grocery workers 
could not have done theirs. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has dem-
onstrated what we have known to be 
true all along, that our childcare work-
force is essential. That is why I was 
proud to cast my vote yesterday for 
the Child Care Is Essential Act. The 
House advanced bold legislation to en-
sure that our childcare workforce has 
the 
support 
it 
needs 
to 
operate 
childcare centers safely. 
I would like to commend my col-
leagues, 
Representatives 
ROSA 
DELAURO, BOBBY SCOTT, and KATHERINE 
CLARK, for their leadership on this crit-
ical issue. 
The fact is, even before the pan-
demic, enrolling an infant or toddler in 
a quality childcare program could be 
enormously expensive. Frankly, there 
was inadequate support to make those 
programs fit in the household budgets 
for many families.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3988 
July 30, 2020 
The GAO found that, on average, just 
1 out of every 10 children who are eligi-
ble for Federal childcare subsidies ac-
tually received them. Moreover, 1 in 10 
parents have reported being demoted, 
transferred, or fired due to childcare 
problems. 
Overall, inadequate childcare costs 
our economy nearly $60 billion, annu-
ally. Meanwhile, we are leaving money 
on the table. For every dollar invested 
in quality early childhood programs, 
we get a $7 return on our investment. 
As challenging as it has been over 
the years for parents to find affordable 
childcare, COVID has massively com-
pounded the problem. It has demanded 
even more of our childcare workforce, 
while stretching budgets to the abso-
lute limit. 
In the Commonwealth of Massachu-
setts, some childcare centers have had 
to turn parents away in order to make 
the necessary public health accom-
modations, such as reducing class size. 
A childcare center in the city of Law-
rence went from serving 715 children 
pre-COVID to 360, a nearly 50 percent 
reduction. What is more, 97 percent of 
the households with children in that 
program were eligible for subsidies. 
What is a parent to do when they 
can’t afford to miss work but also has 
no childcare support? 
It is long past time for America to 
assist them by investing in reliable, af-
fordable, high-quality childcare. 
Each day we hear praise for our es-
sential workers, and they deserve every 
word of it. They have been keeping us 
safe for months while risking their own 
lives. It is obvious that thank-yous will 
no longer cut it. The least we can do is 
guarantee that they aren’t left penni-
less due to the cost of childcare. 
If we are going to show our commit-
ment to workers and to families, the 
Child Care Is Essential Act should ad-
vance through the upper Chamber 
without delay. 
f 
HONORING ANITA MONOIAN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Washington (Mr. NEWHOUSE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to honor the career of Anita Monoian, 
the president and CEO of Yakima 
Neighborhood Health Services, who an-
nounced her retirement after 41 years 
of tireless service and advocacy. 
At a time when community health is 
of the utmost importance, it is a privi-
lege to honor an individual who has 
spent her life’s work advocating for the 
care and well-being of the people of 
Yakima Valley. 
Anita describes her career’s work as 
a labor of love. With that labor, Anita 
expanded the scope of Yakima Neigh-
borhood Health Services from a single 
clinic to 10 clinics across the Yakima 
Valley, reaching 92,000 patients, annu-
ally. 
Anita’s voice has influenced State 
and Federal healthcare policy through 
her work on the board of the National 
Association of Community Health Cen-
ters and the Washington Association of 
Community and Migrant Health Cen-
ters. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to recognize 
Anita’s legacy of improving healthcare 
in central Washington, and I urge my 
colleagues to join in me in congratu-
lating her on an impactful career of 
service. 
RECOGNIZING DR. JAMES IRWIN 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to recognize the life of one of central 
Washington’s American heroes, James 
Irwin. 
Dr. James Irwin served as chief of 
surgery at the U.S. Navy Hospital in 
Oak Harbor, Washington. Following his 
service, Dr. Irwin treated patients in 
north central Washington for 13 years 
before opening a medical practice in 
Moses Lake. He was named chief med-
ical officer of Samaritan Healthcare 
and was an original member of the 
Moses Lake Medical Team. 
He and his wife, Frances, were active 
members in their church and spent 
many years on medical missions across 
Africa, where he provided surgical serv-
ices and shared his knowledge with 
local doctors. 
At age 62, Dr. Irwin, once again, an-
swered his country’s call. He deployed 
to Iraq as a naval surgeon before retir-
ing as a captain in 2004 with over 40 
years of military service. 
In central Washington, Dr. Irwin was 
known for his kind attitude toward the 
patients he cared for. To his fellow 
brothers in arms, he was known as a 
hero. He passed away on June 30, but 
he has left a lasting legacy of providing 
care wherever it was needed. 
Mr. Speaker, my prayers go out to 
his family and loved ones, and I urge 
my colleagues to join me in honoring 
Dr. Irwin’s life and service to our coun-
try. 
REMEMBERING BRAD FISHER OF KENNEWICK, 
WASHINGTON 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, Brad 
Fisher of Kennewick was a friend, a 
businessman, and a passionate advo-
cate for the Tri-Cities community. 
A devoted husband, father, grand-
father, and dedicated community lead-
er, Brad found endless ways to serve 
others. Over the years, he served as a 
Rotarian, a city council member, the 
mayor of Kennewick, and a member of 
numerous community service boards. 
One of Brad’s many contributions to 
his community was his role as a fierce 
champion 
of 
local 
governance. 
He 
helped spearhead the reconveyance ef-
fort in the Tri-Cities to return thou-
sands of acres of river shore land from 
the Federal Government and placed it 
back into the hands of the local com-
munity. His work is not yet complete, 
but I look forward to continuing his 
advocacy in accomplishing this effort 
to improve our community. 
Mr. Speaker, Brad Fisher is an exam-
ple of the engaged and selfless citizen-
ship that we should all strive to emu-
late. May his family and our commu-
nity continue to be blessed by his 
memory, and may he rest in peace.

INTRODUCING THE BLUE PACIFIC 
ACT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Hawaii (Mr. CASE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in support of H.R. 7797, the Boosting 
Long-Term U.S. Engagement in the Pa-
cific Act, also known as the BLUE Pa-
cific Act. 
I am proud to have introduced this 
bill, together with my colleagues, Con-
gressmen AMI BERA, TED YOHO, BRAD 
SHERMAN, and DON YOUNG, as well as 
other members of our Congressional 
Pacific Islands Caucus. 
Scattered across the vast waters of 
the Pacific, from Hawaii to Rapa Nui 
to Palau, and New Caledonia, are 
countless isles and atolls that con-
stitute what we know as the Pacific Is-
lands and their subregions of Mela-
nesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia. The 
collective land and maritime exclusive 
economic zones of the Pacific Islands 
cover more of the Earth’s surface than 
the land areas of China and Russia 
combined. These islands are home to 
diverse and dynamic cultures and peo-
ple on the front lines of climate change 
and facing significant challenges to 
long-term sustainable development. 
The United States is not some re-
mote power in this integral part of our 
world. For two centuries plus, we have 
been, and today we are, a Pacific na-
tion. We have jurisdictions of our own 
among the family of Pacific Islands, in-
cluding my home State of Hawaii. We 
have longstanding ties with all of the 
Pacific Islands, be they independent 
nations, countries in free association, 
or territories of our friends and allies. 
Countless Americans died to liberate 
our Pacific neighbors in storied bat-
tles, including Tarawa, Peleliu, Gua-
dalcanal, and more, during the Second 
World War. 
In my own district is the National 
Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, the 
final resting place of so many of these 
warriors. Our foreign policy in the Pa-
cific Islands is driven by this deep his-
torical relationship and the shared in-
terests and values built by decades of 
consistent but quiet engagement. 
Over the past 20 years alone, the 
United States has provided over $5 bil-
lion in assistance for the region. In just 
the past decade, multiple administra-
tions and Congresses have heightened 
our engagement in the Pacific Islands 
as we have focused our attention in-
creasingly in the Indo-Pacific region. 
Reflecting this renewed attention to 
the Pacific Islands, last year I joined 
several of my colleagues in cofounding 
our first-ever, bipartisan Congressional 
Pacific Islands Caucus. We are dedi-
cated to promoting greater under-
standing of this region and advocating 
for a sound United States foreign pol-
icy in the Pacific Islands that advances 
our shared interests and values.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3989 
July 30, 2020 
Our BLUE Pacific Act establishes a 
comprehensive, long-term framework 
for United States foreign policy in the 
Pacific Islands, focusing on three es-
sential pillars: 
Security, development, and shared 
values. 
Our legislation would expand diplo-
matic and development presence; in-
crease maritime security cooperation 
and assistance; deepen and diversify 
trade; support regional economic and 
social development in areas like public 
health and education; invest in climate 
adaptation and climate resilient infra-
structure; coordinate with existing re-
gional institutions and like-minded al-
lies and partners; promote shared val-
ues like press freedom and gender 
equality; and strengthen people-to-peo-
ple relationships and civil society. It 
would back up our commitment by au-
thorizing $1 billion in assistance pro-
grams for the region for each of the 
next five fiscal years, more than triple 
current levels of assistance. 
In naming this bill, we not only pay 
tribute to the concept of the ‘‘Blue Pa-
cific’’ embraced by leaders of the Pa-
cific Islands Forum themselves as a 
shared identity and platform for collec-
tive action, but also intend for our ef-
forts to be informed by and coordinated 
with the work of existing regional in-
stitutions and frameworks. This legis-
lation would also integrate these pro-
grams with those of our like-minded al-
lies and partners, including Australia, 
New 
Zealand, 
Japan, 
Taiwan, 
and 
more. 
I have no doubt that the introduction 
and enactment of the BLUE Pacific 
Act will be welcomed by our partners 
and allies in the Pacific Islands. 
In uncertain times, this legislation 
sends a clear and powerful statement of 
what our foreign policy seeks to 
achieve—a regional order, built on mu-
tual assistance and benefit, free of co-
ercion, and fully respectful of the sov-
ereignty of all nations. We seek to em-
power the countries and people of the 
region to determine the course of their 
own destinies. As a Pacific nation, we 
hope to share in that future alongside 
our Pacific Islands neighbors. 
The BLUE Pacific Act is the first 
step in that direction. I encourage my 
colleagues to join me in cosponsoring 
the BLUE Pacific Act and urge swift 
consideration of this critical legisla-
tion.

CONGRATULATING EDDIE 
DRILLING 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Arkansas (Mr. HILL) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to recognize my longtime friend, 
Eddie Drilling, who recently announced 
that he will be retiring later this year 
after a 41-year career with AT&T. 
Eddie currently serves as the senior 
vice president for External and Regu-
latory Affairs at AT&T, where he leads 
the national regulatory organization. 
His ties to Arkansas remain strong. He 
currently serves the University of Ar-
kansas Board of Advisors, the Sam 
Walton College of Business Dean’s Ex-
ecutive Advisory Board, and the Razor-
back Foundation Board. 
Eddie has been a leader in Arkansas 
for four decades, and a member and 
mentor of many organizations. He re-
ceived the Pinnacle Award from the 
Little Rock Regional Chamber of Com-
merce, the highest award our chamber 
gives for service to the community. He 
also received the Lifetime of Service 
Award from the city of Little Rock. 
Mr. Speaker, I join all Arkansans in 
congratulating Eddie Drilling. 
RECOGNIZING KEN REEVES ON HIS RETIREMENT 
FROM THE GAME AND FISH COMMISSION 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize Ken Reeves’ 
outstanding contributions to conserva-
tion in Arkansas and his dedication at 
keeping Arkansas the ‘‘Natural State.’’ 
Ken served on the Game and Fish Com-
mission as chairman for 5 years. 
He grew up in Harrison, Arkansas, 
where 
he 
attended 
Harrison 
High 
School and went to the University of 
Arkansas School of Law. Ken’s love of 
fishing and passion for conserving wild-
life from a young age made him an 
easy and successful appointment to the 
commission. 
Ken has demonstrated his passion for 
making a positive change as the chair-
man of the commission. He is leaving 
behind a legacy of improved outdoor 
services that will be enjoyed for gen-
erations to come. 
My congratulations to Ken Reeves. 
JERRY EVANS—OUTSTANDING COACH OF THE 
YEAR 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize Jerry Evans for 
being named one of Arkansas’ Out-
standing Coaches of the Year. 
This year, Coach Evans led the 
Searcy High School Girls Wrestling 
Team to victory as the girls Arkansas 
State champions, also picking up two 
individual championships on the team. 
In 2019, he was the 5A Wrestling 
Coach of the Year for the Arkansas 
Wrestling Coaches Association, and 
was chosen by the Arkansas Democrat- 
Gazette as the All Arkansas Preps 
Wrestling Coach of the Year, and 
named 
the 
Arkansas 
High 
School 
Coaches Association Wrestling Coach 
of the Year through the Arkansas Ac-
tivities Association. 
Coach Evans received his master’s in 
kinesiology at Harding University in 
Searcy, graduating as the first member 
of his immediate family to earn a col-
lege degree. In an interview with the 
Arkansas 
Democrat-Gazette, 
Coach 
Evans said, ‘‘I knew I wanted to be a 
coach ever since I was in 8th grade. I 
knew I wanted to be in education and 
become a teacher.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Coach Evans for 
his commitment to his students and 
his leadership as their coach. 
GUY-PERKINS PTA PURCHASING SCHOOL 
SUPPLIES 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the Parent 
Teacher Association at the Guy-Per-
kins School District for once again pro-
viding students with school supplies for 
the upcoming academic year. All stu-
dents in grades K–12 will have school 
supplies provided to them, regardless of 
whether students have chosen on-cam-
pus instruction or distance learning for 
this fall. 
As parents, teachers, students and 
educators begin a uniquely challenging 
school year, the PTA’s long tradition 
will help parents with back-to-school 
costs and ensure that our teachers do 
not have to purchase their own sup-
plies. 
According to Betty Vickers, Guy- 
Perkins PTA’s secretary and treasurer, 
the initiative helps boost the commu-
nity’s economy because all the supplies 
are purchased locally. I am happy this 
wonderful tradition has continued into 
the 2020–2021 school year, especially 
during 
these 
extraordinary 
times 
where educating our kids presents 
unique challenges. 
JENNIFER CARNAHAN RECEIVES SERVICE AWARD 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize Jennifer Carna-
han as CHI St. Vincent’s recipient of 
the 2019 Sister Teresa Joseph Babcock 
Service Excellence Award. 
Jennifer was born in Dumas, Arkan-
sas, and received her nursing degree 
from the University of Houston before 
attending the Academy of Health Care 
Professionals for surgical technology. 
Jennifer has been serving in the med-
ical field since she was 19 years old, 
starting in the ER, and she currently 
works in neurosurgery. Sister Teresa 
Joseph worked at CHI St. Vincent for 
nearly 30 years, exemplifying St. Vin-
cent’s core values of reverence, integ-
rity, compassion, and excellence. Jen-
nifer currently works in the neurology 
area in the North Campus. 
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Jennifer 
Carnahan.

FARMERS FEEDING UTAH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Utah (Mr. MCADAMS) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. MCADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
recognize some incredible things that 
have happened in my State. 
In Utah, COVID–19 has hit families 
and the food-buying public very hard. 
Many supply chain elements have 
closed, leaving farmers unable to sell 
their Utah-grown products. 
But Utah farmers are passionate 
about feeding people, so the Utah Farm 
Bureau launched ‘‘Farmers Feeding 
Utah.’’ 
Donations to the nonprofit campaign 
went to farmers to purchase their prod-
ucts, and the Utah Farm Bureau han-
dled processing costs and partnered 
with hunger relief organizations to get 
the food directly to needy families. 
Since May, they have received more 
than $300,000 in donations that allow

them to purchase 20,000 pounds of beef, 
10,000 pounds of flour, 200,000 eggs, and 
$100,000 worth of dairy products. They 
have delivered 600 live sheep to the 
Navajo Nation and donated to numer-
ous food pantries throughout Northern 
Utah. 
Utah routinely leads the Nation in 
volunteering. Farmers Feeding Utah is 
the latest example of how Utahns come 
together to protect lives and livelihood 
and to overcome adversity. 
HONORING THE CITY OF SOUTH JORDAN’S PUBLIC 
SAFETY PERSONNEL 
Mr. MCADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the City of South 
Jordan, Utah, its public safety per-
sonnel, and also its residents for show-
ing tremendous leadership and courage 
during a recent public safety crisis. 
On Pioneer Day, July 24, 2020, ap-
proximately 600 people were quickly 
evacuated from their homes and their 
businesses after public safety officials 
discovered explosive material in a 
nearby home. Officials determined that 
the substance had to be neutralized 
through controlled detonations. 
Our State’s official holiday, Pioneer 
Day, is usually reserved for festivities 
and gatherings with family to remem-
ber a legacy of overcoming hardship. 
Instead, South Jordan city officials 
and residents had their holiday inter-
rupted and were called to react quick-
ly, work together and demonstrate 
courage and leadership. They did so 
valiantly, and they did so bravely. The 
detonations were completed with very 
minimal damage caused to nearby 
homes and no injuries whatsoever. 
Given the circumstances, the outcome 
could hardly have been better. 
I applaud these Utahns who came to-
gether in the face of adversity to sup-
port one another. South Jordan has 
much to be proud of on this Pioneer 
Day. 
f 
OPIOID CRISIS EPIDEMIC 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Ohio (Mr. JOYCE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, it 
is an honor to appear before you today. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring 
awareness to the public health crisis 
that continues to devastate commu-
nities in Ohio and across the country 
while we grapple with the unprece-
dented 
challenges 
caused 
by 
the 
coronavirus pandemic—the opioid cri-
sis. 
I have been proud of Congress’ bipar-
tisan work over the past several years 
to not only advance recovery and 
treatment efforts, but also to prevent 
the trafficking of lethal, illicit opioids, 
like fentanyl. I was even prouder when, 
in 2018, those efforts resulted in our 
Nation’s first decline in drug overdose 
deaths in nearly 30 years. Tragically, 
our progress is slipping away. 
The CDC’s preliminary 2019 overdose 
death data shows that fatal overdoses 
hit a record high last year, accounting 
for the deaths of 70,980 Americans. 
More than half of those deaths, 36,500 
to be exact, involved synthetic opioids, 
such as fentanyl. In total, 37 States 
saw their number of fatal overdoses in-
crease or remain stable from 2018. 
That deadly trend is ongoing this 
year as the coronavirus pandemic con-
tinues to impact the mental health and 
economic security of Americans across 
the country. An analysis released by 
the White House last month found that 
overdose deaths were up 11.4 percent 
from January to April this year when 
compared with the same period in 2019. 
Mr. Speaker, these are more than 
just statistics. These are real people— 
mothers and fathers, sons and daugh-
ters—and their deaths are causing real 
pain in communities across our Nation. 
Back home, a young man who had been 
sober for nearly 2 years—2 years—re-
lapsed after the pandemic began and 
the place where he worked had to close 
its doors. Michael died at the end of 
March at just 31 years old, with both 
fentanyl and carfentanil in his system. 
I saw Michael’s mom, Cathy, on the 
local news the other night speaking 
out about her son’s death, trying to 
bring awareness to not only the lack of 
attention focused on the opioid crisis 
right now, but the limited resources 
available to combat addiction during 
this pandemic and the continued rise of 
synthetic opioids, like those found in 
Michael’s system when he died. 
We have to act now to stop this crisis 
in its tracks. We have to redouble our 
efforts now if we want to prevent other 
families from enduring the same kind 
of loss that Michael’s family is cur-
rently suffering. Having met with 
those on the front lines of the opioid 
crisis in my district, ranging from drug 
court judges to directors of rehab fa-
cilities to law enforcement officers on 
local drug task forces, I know that bat-
tling this epidemic requires an all-of- 
the-above approach that includes pre-
vention and education efforts, pro-
motes treatment, cracks down on ille-
gal distribution, and enhances re-
sources for first responders and law en-
forcement. 
That is why I introduced the Com-
prehensive Opioid Program Extension 
Act. My bill, better known as the 
COPE Act, would help us implement an 
all-of-the-above approach by increasing 
the authorized resources available for 
the 
Department 
of 
Justice’s 
com-
prehensive 
opioid 
abuse 
program. 
These grants will help local commu-
nities battle the opioid epidemic by: 
Providing training and resources for 
first responders on opioid overdose re-
versal drugs and devices, like Narcan; 
Improving 
collaboration 
between 
State criminal justice agencies and 
substance abuse agencies; 
Enhancing law enforcement efforts to 
combat 
the 
illegal 
distribution 
of 
opioids; 
And developing or expanding pro-
grams to prevent youth opioid abuse, 
drug take-back initiatives, or for treat-
ment alternatives to incarceration. 
The harsh reality is that everyone in 
this Chamber knows someone who has 
been impacted by this opioid crisis. 
b 945 
With the coronavirus pandemic al-
ready causing an increase in fatal 
overdoses from last year’s record high, 
action is long overdue. 
We must advance legislative solu-
tions that allow Democrats and Repub-
licans to join together in a bipartisan 
effort to defeat this opioid crisis. I 
stand ready to work with my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to 
find a bipartisan solution like the 
COPE Act that will help us stop the 
opioid crisis from causing more death, 
wreaking more havoc, and resulting in 
more tragedy. 
This crisis has been breaking apart 
families and threatening the safety of 
our communities for far too long, and 
the American people are ready for us to 
help them stop it.

IN 
REMEMBRANCE 
OF 
THE 
FELICIAN 
SISTERS 
LOST 
TO 
CORONAVIRUS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Ms. STEVENS) for 41⁄2 min-
utes. 
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, I am 
here today to memorialize the beau-
tiful lives of 13 nuns taken from Michi-
gan’s 11th District by the scourge of 
coronavirus between April and June of 
this year. 
We honor the memory of: 
Sister Mary Luiza, 
Sister Celine Marie, 
Sister Mary Estelle, 
Sister Thomas Marie, 
Sister Mary Patricia, 
Sister Mary Clarence, 
Sister Rose Mary Wolak, 
Sister Mary Janice, 
Sister Mary Alice Ann, 
Sister Victoria Marie, 
Sister Mary Martinez, 
Sister Mary Madeleine, 
And Sister Mary Danatha ‘‘Lottie.’’ 
These righteous women spent their 
days working and living together as 
members of the Felician Sisters of the 
Presentation of the Blessed Virgin 
Mary convent in Livonia, Michigan, 
some for more than half a century. At 
the time of their deaths, they ranged 
from age 69 to 99 years old, still wholly 
committed to serving the most vulner-
able among us. They would call it 
‘‘from the womb to the tomb,’’ the 
dedication of their service to the com-
munity. 
Prior to the pandemic, the Sisters 
could be found working in our local 
schools, libraries, and medical facili-
ties, providing enrichment to our stu-
dents and care for our sick. Many of 
them pursued degrees in higher edu-
cation during their lifetimes, always 
seeking new ways to instill a sense of 
peace, justice, dignity, and truth in the 
world around them. My heart aches for 
the harm done to the soul of our com-
munity and with the loss of these in-
credible lives.

Since this news has broken and 
spread throughout the world, they have 
heard from the world. From Alaska to 
Arizona, to as far away as Taiwan, peo-
ple reaching out and sending them

HONORING THE LIFE OF SHARON 
ERICHSRUD 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Minnesota (Mr. EMMER) for 30 seconds. 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Sharon 
Erichsrud, who passed away in March 
at the age of 79. She was a loving moth-
er, devoted wife, and lifelong Minneso-
tan. 
Sharon was born in 1941 in Frost, 
Minnesota. She attended Frost High 
School, where she met Butch, her hus-
band of 60 years. After graduation, she 
went on to work at 3M and several 
banks in the Blue Earth area, eventu-
ally becoming bank manager at Albert 
Lea Savings and Loan. 
Sharon and Butch are parents of 
three children, Beth, Shelly, and Mark 
of St. Michael-Albertville, who gave 
them five children and four great- 
grandchildren. 
Sharon was adored by her family, 
who remember her as a voracious read-
er and a pillar of her community at 
Trinity Lutheran Church. 
Sharon was a beloved member of our 
Minnesota community. May her mem-
ory be a blessing.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick 
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: 
Lord God, thank You for giving us 
another day. 
On the day our Nation says its final 
good-bye as Your servant John Lewis 
returns to You and joins the beloved 
community in its fullness in eternity, 
we bring our petitions to You using 
some of his final words. 
Bless the Members of this people’s 
House, and those in authority on all 
levels of society, with wisdom and 
courage to address the unholy oppres-
sion that awaits so many of our broth-
ers and sisters of color. May there be a 
new, creative way of establishing some-
thing like community policing, that 
peace and security might be enjoyed 
where we live. 
O Lord, do we dare to consider the 
power of nonviolence in our homes, our 
communities, our Nation, and, perhaps, 
in leadership for our world? Might we 
truly be called, if not challenged, to 
beat our swords into plowshares and 
our spears into pruning hooks, so that 
nation shall not lift up sword against 
nation, neither shall we learn war any-
more? 
And, as we are reminded, the greatest 
expression of nonviolent challenge to 
injustice is the vote. Bless all efforts to 
secure access to the ballot for all 
American citizens. 
Help us, O Lord, to answer the high-
est calling of our hearts, to carry for-
ward the mission of John Lewis, our 
mission as one nation under God, under 
You, to bring to fruition the beloved 
community here on Earth. You, Lord, 
know what that might be. Help us to 
find our way to it. 
May all that is done be for Your 
greater honor and glory. 
Amen.

I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The

POST OFFICE DELAYS 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, as our 
Nation reels from COVID–19 and over 
150,000 deaths, millions of Americans 
depend on the U.S. Postal Service for 
access to medicine, stimulus payments, 
small business support, and trust-
worthy 
door-to-door 
service 
upon 
which Americans rely. Yet, recently 
appointed 
Postmaster 
General 
and 
major Trump donor Louis DeJoy has 
instituted a deeply misguided policy 
that puts American lives at risk. 
In a disturbing memo, it reads: ‘‘late 
trips are no longer authorized or ac-
cepted . . . we may see mail left behind 
or mail on the workroom floor or 
docks.’’ 
The United States Postal Service has 
served our Nation ably for over two 
centuries, delivering at the most cost- 
effective rate. Letter carriers walk 
through rain, sleet, snow, dark of night 
to ensure the mail gets delivered. That 
is why Congress already provided $10 
billion in financing to the Postal Serv-
ice during this pandemic, and, trag-
ically, the Trump administration con-
tinued to hold it up, causing backups 
in mail across our Nation. 
I demand the Trump administration 
release the funds Congress provided to 
our Postal Service. We must act now to 
ensure our people have access to medi-
cations they need, protect our small 
businesses and democratic institutions, 
and end these senseless delays. 
f 
SAVE OUR STAGES 
(Mr. WILLIAMS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, Austin, 
Texas, is known as the Live Music Cap-
ital of the World, and every year mil-
lions of people come from around the 
world to my district to enjoy concerts 
and events. 
Venues 
like 
Songbird 
Live 
in 
Cleburne, Hudson’s on Mercer Street in 
Dripping Springs, and Mohawk in Aus-
tin play a crucial role in our culture. 
During COVID–19, these venues have 
faced devastation as they were the first 
to close and will be among the last to 
open. 
In order to provide relief, I am proud 
to introduce the bipartisan Save Our 
Stages Act with my colleague, PETER 
WELCH, to create a grant program that 
will ensure they have the resources 
needed to survive. 
American music legends that rose to 
fame once graced their stages that are 
currently empty and motionless. They 
moved the young and old alike and in-
spired the next generation of artists. 
It is my hope that our venues, with 
the help of Congress and our commu-
nities, will be able to once again wel-
come their next act to the stage. I urge 
consideration and passage of this vital 
bill.

ENSURING SAFETY FOR THE 
AMERICAN FLYING PUBLIC 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, August 1 marks the 10th anni-
versary of Congress passing landmark 
legislation to ensure one level of safety 
for the American flying public. 
The success of this legislation be-
longs to the courageous advocacy of 
the families of flight 3407, who lost 
their loved ones in a tragic plane crash 
in Clarence, New York, in 2009. These 
families lost sons and daughters, moth-
ers and fathers, brothers and sisters, 
friends and loved ones. No one would 
have blamed them had they gone on to 
live their lives in quiet solitude. They 
did not do that. 
They turned their personal tragedy 
into a life-giving force, a citizen army 
to fight for change so that what hap-
pened to them would not happen to 
others. These families were relentless, 
pushing Congress to strengthen pilot 
training standards, as the National 
Transportation Safety Board found 
pilot error was responsible for the 
crash. The families did not blame the 
pilots, for they, too, were victims. 
They attacked the system that allowed 
pilots who were ill-trained to fly 
planes. 
There is still much work to be done, 
but today we honor and express our 
graduate to the good and courageous 
families of flight 3407. 
f 
HONORING BERNELL TRAMMELL 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in honor of Bernell Trammell. 
Bernell was one of 10 children of 
Delores Jackson, born in Milwaukee, 
Wisconsin, who attended Milwaukee 
Lincoln High School in its heyday. He 
followed the steps of his grandfather, 
Cecil Ballenger, who was one of the 
first African-American businesses in 
Milwaukee when he founded Expres-
sions Printing. 
He was well-read and liked to read 
the books of Abraham Lincoln and 
Malcolm X. He was not afraid to speak 
the truth. He liked to show us signs of 
Bible 
verses 
and 
signs 
supporting 
Trump. He was killed with his Trump 
sign a little over a week ago. 
I would like to read a short Bible 
verse, which is one of the ones he is 
pictured with. Matthew, chapter 12, 
verse 38: 
Then some of the scribes and Pharisees an-
swered him saying, Teacher, we wish to see 
a sign from you. And he answered them, An 
evil and adulterous generation seeks a sign, 
but no sign will be given it. 
Again, I rise today in honor of 
Bernell Trammell, who was murdered 
with his sign a little over a week ago. 
RECOGNIZING AND HONORING DR. 
JEAN FRUCI 
(Mr. TONKO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Dr. Jean Fruci, a pro-
fessional staff member with the Com-
mittee on Energy and Commerce. Jean 
is also one of my most trusted advisers, 
a former coworker in my personal of-
fice, and a true friend. 
Jean first came to the Hill in the 
1990s as an AAAS fellow, after receiv-
ing her Ph.D. in soil science from Cor-
nell University. She had already served 
in several Member and committee of-
fices before I met her in 2009 on the 
Science, Space, and Technology Com-
mittee. Her brilliance and integrity 
were evident. 
After a brief stint away from Capitol 
Hill to care for her ailing parents, Jean 
returned to congressional service as 
my legislative director. She was a val-
ued guide and coach as I worked to 
earn a place on the Energy and Com-
merce Committee in early 2013. 
Within just a few years, my col-
league, Chairman PALLONE, was smart 
enough to recruit her from my personal 
office to join the committee, where she 
would serve both the Subcommittees 
on Energy as well as Environment and 
Climate Change, which I now chair. 
Her 
work 
in 
that 
capacity 
has 
strengthened the quality of our law-
making and helped countless Ameri-
cans in ways most will never realize. 
Over her congressional career, Jean 
has served on multiple conference com-
mittees, helped authorize and reau-
thorize numerous vital programs, pro-
vided needed oversight, and negotiated 
many deals. In her exemplary service, 
she has reminded us time and again of 
the importance of our work in Congress 
and its potential to help the people we 
serve. 
Jean is a legendary negotiator. I 
know this because my colleague from 
Illinois, Mr. SHIMKUS, would often re-
mark as such. He knows, however, that 
she is also fair, honest, and does her 
homework. 
Jean, as a STEM professional, your 
skills and knowledge made me and this 
institution better. 
We need more STEM professionals, 
more Jean Frucis, to guide us in our 
policymaking, as the world and our 
economy become increasingly complex. 
Mr. Speaker, Jean has done so much 
for this House, far beyond what I can 
convey in these brief remarks. I know 
all of my colleagues join me in wishing 
her and her husband, John, a retire-
ment full of health, happiness, travel 
when safe to do so again, and fulfill-
ment. 
You have earned that and more, 
Jean, and for that I humbly say thank 
you for what you have done for this in-
stitution and for all Americans.

QUARTERS 100TH ANNIVERSARY 
(Mr. EMMER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today 
to 
congratulate 
Automotive 
Parts Headquarters in St. Cloud, Min-
nesota, on 100 years of dedicated serv-
ice to their customers and their com-
munity. 
Owning and operating a business is 
never easy, and reaching this milestone 
is an important testament to the hard-
working people they employ and the 
services they offer. 
Founded in 1920, Automotive Parts 
Headquarters outgrew their first shop 
in Minneapolis. Today, they have 125 
corporate stores and 36 independent lo-
cations across the Midwest. 
Automotive Parts Headquarters has 
stayed true to its roots. In fact, Presi-
dent and CEO Corey Bartlett is the 
third generation of his family to be in-
volved in the business. 
It was an honor to visit Automotive 
Parts Headquarters recently and learn 
about the great work they do in the St. 
Cloud area. 
Automotive Parts Headquarters not 
only supplies parts to repair shops, the 
company builds partnerships with their 
customers to help them grow. 
Automotive Parts Headquarters also 
supports the communities where they 
operate, contributing to charities like 
the American Cancer Society, Toys for 
Tots, and WACOSA. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Automotive 
Parts Headquarters for their continued 
service to our communities and con-
gratulate them for 100 years of incred-
ible service in Minnesota.

DON’T LET UNEMPLOYMENT 
BENEFITS EXPIRE 
(Mr. CARTWRIGHT asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, in 
the summer of 1789, according to a 
story, there was a famine in France. 
The people didn’t have enough bread to 
eat, and they approached the queen, 
and they said: Queen Marie Antoinette, 
the people do not have enough bread to 
eat. 
According to the story, she said: Well 
then let them eat cake. 
Showing the most callous disregard 
for what the lives of the people actu-
ally was like, assuming that without 
enough bread to eat they actually had 
cake lying around, that is ridiculous. 
Mr. Speaker, that is almost certainly 
an apocryphal story; it didn’t really 
happen. But now, here, in America, we 
have a real-life American Marie Antoi-
nette. 
Showing the most caviler disregard 
for the plight of the American people, 
allowing UI to expire without negoti-
ating, without talking, without trying 
to extend relief, Senator MITCH MCCON-
NELL, don’t risk letting our economy

STANDING AGAINST THE CCP 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, the entire world has had to 
endure the Wuhan virus destroying 
lives. Now there is evidence that China 
has launched state-sponsored hackers 
to target virus vaccine research. As 
chairman of the RSC National Security 
and Foreign Affairs Task Force, I am 
grateful to have introduced the RSC 
National Security Strategy. 
This report recommends over a dozen 
measures to counter theft by the Chi-
nese Communist Party of our IP and 
trade secrets, including new measures 
to stop and punish their cyberattacks 
and enhance outdated laws. One of 
these is to change the International 
Trade Commission, making it easier 
for American companies to block Chi-
nese imports that were the product of 
stolen trade secrets. This report also 
includes the toughest sanctions ever on 
the 
oppressive 
Chinese 
Communist 
Party, promoting opportunities for the 
Chinese people. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
and we will never forget September the 
11th in the global war on terrorism. 
Our sympathy for the family and 
friends of Bernell Trammell of Mil-
waukee. 
f 
AMERICA HAS A CHILDCARE 
CRISIS 
(Ms. WILD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, as we face 
the COVID–19 health and economic cri-
sis, childcare centers across our coun-
try are on the verge of collapse. The 
consequences can be felt throughout 
our 
society: 
From 
children, 
to 
childcare workers, to working par-
ents—disproportionately women—who 
were already struggling to stay afloat 
given the acute national shortage of af-
fordable childcare services. For these 
parents, who depend on childcare in 
order to maintain their careers and pay 
their bills, the answer is more afford-
able childcare, not less. 
The Child Care Is Essential Act 
would provide direct financial support 
for childcare providers during and after 
this crisis. The Child Care for Eco-
nomic Recovery Act would deliver cru-
cial Federal investments in childcare 
facilities. These are two immediate 
steps that we can take on behalf of 
working families right now. 
Once we pass this legislation, our 
focus must turn to addressing the lack 
of affordability in childcare more so 
that we can finally ensure that every 
working family who needs childcare 
can obtain and afford it. We must sup-
port working families by expanding ac-
cess to at-home learning and childcare. 
f 
ALL TRADITIONAL DECORUM HAS 
BEEN LOST 
(Mr. MEUSER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, Tues-
day’s House Judiciary hearing was one 
of the most disgraceful events I and 
millions of Americans have witnessed 
in this Congress. No election or appar-
ent hatred of any person should spark 
behavior that is beneath this office. 
As one of my constituents said, ‘‘all 
traditional decorum has been lost.’’ 
The Attorney General of the United 
States was accused by Democrat Mem-
bers of using Federal force to quell the 
unrest in Portland for the purpose of 
providing footage for campaign ads; 
meanwhile, refusing to condemn at-
tacks to a Federal courthouse. 
For more than 60 days, Portland had 
experienced violent protests, and now 
today’s Democrats are rationalizing 
the situation by blaming the Federal 
law enforcement officials for destruc-
tion which had been caused weeks be-
fore their arrival. 
We have come to expect this level of 
deliberate 
mischaracterization 
from 
the media, but from Members? How are 
we not united in denouncing violence 
in our streets? How are we not united 
in providing resources to safely open 
our schools and restart our economy 
and find a vaccine? How are we not 
united in passing an effective phase 4 
relief package focused on solving prob-
lems, not prolonging them through No-
vember 3rd? 
f 
RECOGNIZING UTERINE FIBROIDS 
AWARENESS MONTH 
(Ms. CLARKE of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in recognition of 
Uterine Fibroids Awareness Month. 
Uterine fibroids are noncancerous tu-
mors that affect an estimated 26 mil-
lion women between the ages of 15 and 
50 in the United States. 
As vice chair of the Energy and Com-
merce Committee and a survivor of 
uterine fibroids myself, I know that in-
creasing 
awareness 
about 
uterine 
fibroids is critical to our efforts to ad-
dress the national maternity mortality 
crisis and prevent pregnancy-related 
deaths. 
While more than 80 percent of Afri-
can Americans and 70 percent of Cauca-
sians develop fibroids by the time they 
reach menopause, hospitalization rates 
for uterine fibroids are three times 
higher for African American women 
and twice as high for Latina women. 
However, the exact number of affected 
women is unknown because it is dif-
ficult for healthcare providers to de-
tect and accurately diagnose this con-
dition. 
This issue has not received the atten-
tion or funding it deserves. This is why 
I was proud to introduce H.R. 6383, the 
Uterine Fibroid Research and Edu-
cation Act of 2020. 
This awareness month is an oppor-
tunity to cast the spotlight on the for-
gotten issue that impacts the lives of 
women of color.

COMMEMORATING THE 30TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE AMERICANS 
WITH DISABILITIES ACT 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate 
the 30th anniversary of the Americans 
with Disabilities Act, a landmark piece 
of legislation for people with disabil-
ities. 
More than 55 million Americans have 
a disability, whether it is physical, 
learning, cognitive, or other. 
There are many ways we can support 
this community and providing job op-
portunities is a great place to start. 
Many 
Americans 
with 
disabilities 
struggle to find employment, despite 
the wealth of skills they have to offer, 
and a job can provide independence, 
economic self-sufficiency, and pride. 
We must also support students with 
disabilities. I am proud to be a cospon-
sor of the IDEA Full Funding Act, a 
bill that creates a 10-year plan to hold 
the Federal Government accountable 
for the full 40 percent of funding for 
special education promised by Congress 
in the Individuals with Disabilities 
Education Act of 1975. 
Mr. Speaker, the Americans with 
Disabilities Act is an incredible mile-
stone for legal protections for Ameri-
cans with disabilities, but we can still 
do more to fight stigmas, defy preju-
dice, and empower those with disabil-
ities in our everyday lives.

ert Edington. Robert’s countless acco-
lades and recognitions reflect a life-
time of devotion to his hometown of

This impressive list includes a 2012 
Mobile Area Veteran of the Year, the 
2007 Mobilian of the Year, State presi-
dent and national director of the Navy

July 30, 2020 
Robert was active duty with the U.S. 
Navy from 1951 to 1955, then started in 
the Navy Active Reserve until his re-
tirement as a commander in 1980. As a 
Navy Air Operations Officer, he re-
ceived numerous awards and designa-
tions. 
As a fellow graduate of the Univer-
sity of Alabama School of Law, I had 
the pleasure of working with Robert on 
many occasions, and I will miss his 
passion, professionalism, and friend-
ship. 
I offer my sincere condolences to his 
beloved wife, Pat, and their children. 
They can be proud of the legacy of

RECOGNIZING NICKY 
CHRISTOPHER 
(Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize an amazing 
member of our community. Nicky 
Christopher 
is 
a 
12-year-old 
from 
Yardley, Pennsylvania, who has been 
working to brighten the day of people 
across our community. 
Over the last several months, Nicky 
has decorated dozens of homes to cele-
brate birthdays, graduations, and bar 
and bat mitzvahs and other causes for 
celebration. 
In an amazing show of community 
spirit, families have donated supplies 
and decorations to help Nicky continue 
to bring joy across our community. 
And while Nicky receives some cash 
donations, he takes any money that is 
not spent on supplies, and he donates 
that money to children who have been 
displaced from their homes. 
Mr. Speaker, Nicky’s kindness and 
generosity are an inspiration for our 
entire community and our entire Na-
tion. I know that he has been able to 
brighten the day of so many people in 
our community when they have really 
needed it the most. 
Last month I had the opportunity to 
meet Nicky over Zoom, and I cannot 
say enough about what an amazing 
young man he is and how proud I am to 
represent him in Congress and how in-
credibly proud his family must be. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Nicky for bring-
ing so much light to our community 
and to our Nation. We need more peo-
ple like him.

HONORING THE LIFE OF ERIC 
MEYERHOFF 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to remember and honor 
the life of beloved Savannah architect 
Eric Meyerhoff, who passed away at 
the age of 91. 
Eric was a gift to the Savannah com-
munity, who blessed it with his gift of 
imagination. Eric helped create the Sa-
vannah Riverfront and more than 74 
projects in the historic district, includ-
ing the World War II monument titled, 
‘‘A World Apart,’’ which is located on 
River Street. 
Eric played a large part in making 
the beautiful city what it is today, and 
he spent over 50 years bringing his vi-
sion for Savannah to life. Although 
Eric was extremely committed to Sa-
vannah’s architecture, he was even 
more committed to his people. 
Eric and his family escaped Nazi Ger-
many in the 1930s, so he had many 
impactful stories that touched count-
less lives. 
Eric was also a veteran. Eric served 
as a translator in the United States 
Army. 
Eric was a graduate of the University 
of Florida and was a huge Florida 
Gators fan. 
Although most in the Savannah com-
munity knew Eric as a renowned archi-
tect, he was also a devoted teacher, 
provider, husband, and father. 
I am thankful for the life Eric lived, 
and he will leave a lasting impact on 
Savannah with his architectural cre-
ations. My thoughts and prayers are 
with his family and friends during this 
most difficult time.

RECOGNIZING THE 100TH 
BIRTHDAY OF ED EWING 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the 100th birthday 
of a great World War II veteran, Ed 
Ewing from Redding, California. 
Ed is a U.S. Army veteran, who once 
dreamed of being a doctor but then 
found his way to be a longtime owner 
and operator of Economy 4 Cycle Ma-
rine. 
Ed began his business in Redding in 
1960. He tried to retire in 1985 and did 
so for 6 years, but he reopened his 
doors again and worked until just a few 
years ago, finally retiring at 98 years 
old. 
Ed knows Bearcat outboard motors 
inside and out, and he had people seek-
ing out his expertise from all over the 
country. 
At his birthday party this past week-
end, I am told that Ed still appeared to 
be running on all cylinders. 
Mr. Speaker, I wish Ed a happy birth-
day and I wish him and his family a 
wonderful year ahead.

Management to be consistent with the purpose 
of this subsection. 
(5) This subsection shall apply with respect to

that provides premium pay, retirement, life in-
surance, or any other employee benefit) that re-
quires any deduction or contribution, or that

any other Act may be used to implement or en-
force the agreements in Standard Forms 312 and 
4414 of the Government or any other nondisclo-
sure policy, form, or agreement if such policy,

tion, a nondisclosure policy form or agreement 
that is to be executed by a person connected 
with the conduct of an intelligence or intel-
ligence-related activity, other than an employee 
or officer of the United States Government, may 
contain provisions appropriate to the particular 
activity for which such document is to be used. 
Such form or agreement shall, at a minimum, re-
quire that the person will not disclose any clas-
sified information received in the course of such 
activity unless specifically authorized to do so 
by the United States Government. Such non-
disclosure forms shall also make it clear that 
they do not bar disclosures to Congress, or to an 
authorized official of an executive agency or the 
Department of Justice, that are essential to re-
porting a substantial violation of law. 
(b) A nondisclosure agreement may continue 
to be implemented and enforced notwith-

ity that has been assessed, for which all judicial 
and administrative remedies have been ex-
hausted or have lapsed, and that is not being 
paid in a timely manner pursuant to an agree-
ment with the authority responsible for col-
lecting the tax liability, where the awarding

less a Federal agency has considered suspension 
or debarment of the corporation and has made 
a determination that this further action is not 
necessary to protect the interests of the Govern-
ment. 
SEC. 744. None of the funds made available by 
this or any other Act may be used to enter into

ceding 24 months, where the awarding agency is 
aware of the conviction, unless a Federal agen-
cy has considered suspension or debarment of 
the corporation and has made a determination 
that this further action is not necessary to pro-
tect the interests of the Government. 
SEC. 745. (a) During fiscal year 2021, on the

the Congressional Budget Office, an adjustment 
to the discretionary spending limit in such cat-
egory for fiscal year 2021 shall be made by the 
Director of the Office of Management and

of all such adjustments shall not exceed 0.2 per-
cent of the sum of the adjusted discretionary 
spending limits for all categories for that fiscal

during calendar year 2021 for an employee serv-
ing in an Executive Schedule position, or in a 
position for which the rate of pay is fixed by 
statute at an Executive Schedule rate, shall be 
the rate payable for the applicable Executive 
Schedule level on December 31, 2019, by oper-
ation of section 749 of division D of Public Law 
116–6. Such an employee may not receive a pay 
rate increase during calendar year 2021, except 
as provided in subsection (i). 
(c) Notwithstanding section 401 of the Foreign 
Service Act of 1980 (Public Law 96–465) or any 
other provision of law, a chief of mission or am-

tion 3161 of title 5, United States Code, or to em-
ployees in another pay system whose position 
would be classified at GS–15 or below if chapter 
51 of title 5, United States Code, applied to 
them. 
(f) Nothing in subsections (b) through (e) shall 
prevent employees who do not serve under a po-
litical appointment from receiving pay increases 
as otherwise provided under applicable law. 
(g) This section does not apply to an indi-
vidual who makes an election to retain Senior 
Executive Service basic pay under section

(i) Notwithstanding subsections (b) through 
(e), an employee in a covered position may re-
ceive a pay rate increase upon an authorized 
movement to a different covered position only if 
that new position has higher-level duties and a 
pre-established level or range of pay higher 
than the level or range for the position held im-
mediately before the movement. Any such in-
crease must be based on the rates of pay and ap-
plicable limitations on payable rates of pay in 
effect on December 31, 2019, by operation of sec-
tion 749 of division D of Public Law 116–6. 
(j) Notwithstanding any other provision of 
law, for an individual who is newly appointed 
to a covered position during the period of time 
subject to this section, the initial pay rate shall

tations on payable rates of pay in effect on De-
cember 31, 2019, by operation of section 749 of

rate increases shall apply through the end of 
that pay period. 
(l) For the purpose of this section, the term 
‘‘covered position’’ means a position occupied by 
an employee whose pay is restricted under this 
section. 
(m) This section takes effect on the first day 
of the first applicable pay period beginning on 
or after January 1, 2021.

proposed to be deferred in a special message 
transmitted under section 1012 or 1013 of the

sufficient time to be prudently obligated as re-
quired under section 1012(b) or 1013 of such Act; 
and 
(2) may not be deferred or otherwise withheld 
from obligation during the 90-day period before 
the expiration of the period of availability of

tion in sufficient time to be prudently obligated;

the course of study offered by the institution at 
such facility is accessible to incarcerated indi-
viduals (including such individuals who are in-

rectly) charge an incarcerated individual for an 
award year, an amount that exceeds the total 
grant aid received by the individual for such 
award year. 
(5) Such institution makes available to incar-
cerated individuals who are considering enroll-
ing in a course of study offered by the institu-
tion, in simple and understandable terms, the

study at the institution for which such an indi-
vidual may receive a Federal Pell Grant, includ-

tion 472 of the HEA); 
(ii) the mode of instruction (such as distance 
education, in-person instruction, or a combina-
tion of such modes); 
(iii) how enrollment in such course of study 
will impact the period of eligibility for Federal 
Pell Grants for such an individual, including in 
a case in which the individual is transferred to 
another facility or released before the comple-
tion of such course; 
(iv) the transferability of credits earned, and 
the acceptability of such credits toward a cer-
tificate or degree program offered by the institu-
tion; 
(v) the process for continuing postsecondary 
education— 
(I) upon transfer to another facility; or 
(II) after the student’s period of incarceration 
or confinement; and 
(vi) the process for continuing enrollment at 
the institution after the student’s period of in-
carceration or confinement, including any bar-
riers to admission (such as criminal history 
questions on applications for admission to such 
institution). 
(B) In the case of an institution that offers a 
program to prepare incarcerated individuals for 
gainful employment in a recognized occupation 
(as such term is used in sections 101(b)(1), 
102(c)(1)(A), and 481(b)(1)(A)(i) of the HEA)— 
(i) information on any applicable State licen-
sure and certification requirements, including 
the requirements of the State in which the facil-
ity involved is located and each State in which 
such individuals permanently reside; and 
(ii) restrictions related to the employment of 
formerly incarcerated individuals for each rec-
ognized occupation for which the course of 
study prepares students, including such restric-
tions— 
(I) in Federal law; and 
(II) in the laws of the State in which the facil-
ity involved is located and each State in which 
such individuals permanently reside. 
(c) In this section:

of the institution is offered to incarcerated indi-
viduals.

an individual who is incarcerated in a facility 
or who is subject to an involuntary civil commit-
ment. 
(4) The term ‘‘non-incarcerated student’’ 
means a student at an institution of higher edu-
cation who is not an incarcerated individual. 
(d) This section shall be in effect until titles I, 
II, III, IV and V of the HEA are reauthorized. 
SEC. 316. None of the funds appropriated by 
this title for the Department of Education shall 
be withheld from an institution of higher edu-
cation solely because that institution is con-
ducting or preparing to conduct research on 
marihuana as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802(16). 
SEC. 317. The Secretary shall require any in-
formation required to be publicly disclosed for 
the purpose of comparing institutions of higher

through linked open data, such as the creden-
tial transparency description language speci-
fications or a substantially similar approach.

of the existing use agreement or a new use 
agreement for the project, in either case, any 
use restrictions in such agreement are of no less-
er duration than the existing use restrictions.

defined in section 502 of the Congressional 
Budget Act of 1974(2 U.S.C. 661a)) of any FHA- 
insured mortgage, except to the extent that ap-
propriations are provided in advance for the

SEC. 210. (a) No assistance shall be provided

Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f) to any individual 
who— 
(1) is enrolled as a student at an institution of

(b) For purposes of determining the eligibility 
of a person to receive assistance under section 8 
of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42

of amounts received for tuition and any other

ants and the local government that such a mul-
tifamily property owned or having a mortgage 
held by the Secretary is not feasible for contin-
ued rental assistance payments under such sec-

sistance. The Secretary shall also take appro-
priate steps to ensure that project-based con-
tracts remain in effect prior to foreclosure, sub-
ject to the exercise of contractual abatement 
remedies to assist relocation of tenants for immi-
nent major threats to health and safety after 
written notice to and informed consent of the 
affected tenants and use of other available rem-
edies, such as partial abatements or receiver-
ship. After disposition of any multifamily prop-
erty described in this section, the contract and 
allowable rent levels on such properties shall be 
subject to the requirements under section 524 of

limits in any way the use of capital funds for

graph (1) or (2) of section 9(g). 
SEC. 215. No official or employee of the De-
partment of Housing and Urban Development 
shall be designated as an allotment holder un-
less the Office of the Chief Financial Officer has 
determined that such allotment holder has im-
plemented an adequate system of funds control 
and has received training in funds control pro-
cedures and directives. The Chief Financial Of-
ficer shall ensure that there is a trained allot-
ment holder for each HUD appropriation under 
the accounts ‘‘Executive Offices’’, ‘‘Administra-
tive Support Offices’’, ‘‘Program Offices’’, ‘‘Gov-
ernment National Mortgage Association—Guar-
antees of Mortgage-Backed Securities Loan 
Guarantee Program Account’’, and ‘‘Office of 
Inspector General’’ within the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development. 
SEC. 216. The Secretary shall, for fiscal year 
2021, notify the public through the Federal Reg-
ister and other means, as determined appro-
priate, of the issuance of a notice of the avail-
ability of assistance or notice of funding avail-
ability (NOFA) for any program or discretionary

competitively awarded. Notwithstanding any 
other provision of law, for fiscal year 2021, the

web site or through other electronic media, as 
determined by the Secretary.

Such requirements shall apply to insured and 
noninsured projects with assistance attached to 
the units under section 8 of the United States 
Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f), but shall 
not apply to such units assisted under section 
8(o)(13) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1437f(o)(13)) or to

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on the measure under 
consideration 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Today, we continue investing for the 
people with H.R. 7617. 
This minibus combines six appropria-
tions bills: Defense, Commerce-Justice- 
Science, Energy and Water Develop-
ment, Financial Services and General 
Government, 
Labor-HHS-Education, 
and Transportation-Housing and Urban 
Development. 
The bill promotes economic recovery 
from the devastating COVID–19 pan-
demic. It provides more than $200 bil-
lion in emergency funding to rebuild 
our Nation’s transportation, housing, 
and energy infrastructure; to expand 
broadband to unserved and underserved 
areas; and to rebuild the Nation’s aged 
public health capacity and support 
State and local health agencies and 
global health activities. 
The bill prioritizes public health and 
safety with $47 billion for lifesaving 
medical research at the National Insti-
tutes of Health and $50 million, an in-
crease of $25 million above fiscal year 
2020, for firearm injury and mortality 
prevention research at the NIH and 
CDC. It includes strong funding for nu-
merous public health efforts, including 
initiatives to reduce HIV infections, 
address tobacco and e-cigarette use, 
and ensure food safety. 
As we confront the twin crises of 
COVID–19 and systemic racism, the bill

takes bold steps to build safer and 
stronger communities for all people. It 
provides strong funding to support law 
enforcement reform at the State and 
local level while catalyzing economic 
development in disadvantaged commu-
nities that is fundamental to a more 
just and equitable society. 
Among other priorities, the bill in-
vests in education and job training; ex-
pands access to safe, affordable, and 
fair housing; supports servicemembers 
and military families; and combats cli-
mate change and embraces a clean en-
ergy future. 
This package prioritizes the lives and 
livelihoods of the American people and 
makes the strong investments needed 
to build a stronger future for every per-
son. 
It is the product of months of 
thoughtful deliberation and input from 
Members on both sides of the aisle. I 
am proud of the work we have com-
pleted under the incredibly difficult 
circumstances of the COVID–19 pan-
demic. Our incredibly talented appro-
priations subcommittee chairs will dis-
cuss more about what this package 
does for the people. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
As the vice ranking member of the 
House Appropriations Committee, Mr. 
Speaker, I stand today in opposition to 
H.R. 7617, the second set of fiscal year 
2021 appropriations bills to be consid-
ered by the House. 
This minibus of six bills includes the 
two largest, Defense and Labor, Health 
and Human Services, and Education, as 
well as the titles covering Commerce- 
Justice-Science, Energy and Water De-
velopment, 
Financial 
Services 
and 
General 
Government, 
and, 
finally, 
Transportation-Housing and Urban De-
velopment. 
While I am always encouraged to see 
the process of funding government un-
derway in Congress, Democrats, unfor-
tunately, chose a deeply flawed ap-
proach in exercising this function for 
fiscal year 2021. 
Remember, nearly a year ago, Mr. 
Speaker, Congress passed and Presi-
dent Trump signed into law the Bipar-
tisan Budget Act of 2019, which set 
budgetary levels for fiscal years 2020 
and 2021. This bipartisan and bicameral 
compromise was the result of a good 
faith negotiation between the Presi-
dent and congressional leadership. Last 
year, my friends on their side of the 
aisle actually kept that agreement, 
and we had an orderly appropriations 
process, a successful outcome, and we 
have had no government shutdowns, no 
long-term continuing resolutions. 
This year, however, despite this ex-
isting agreement, Democrats on the 
House Appropriations Committee chose 
to write bills that greatly exceed the 
spending limits allowed for fiscal year 
2021. In fact, they did so through exten-
sive use of a budget gimmick that des-
ignates certain funds as emergency. 
Without question, there are many 
worthwhile items and priorities in 
these six bills before us, Mr. Speaker, 
but I remain concerned about the use 
of emergency designated funds as a 
workaround and scheme to break the 
budget agreement between the two par-
ties and the President. 
In fact, in this bill alone, there is 
well over $200 billion of this so-called 
emergency spending, clearly in viola-
tion of the budget agreement. $186 bil-
lion is included in the infrastructure 
title without any bipartisan discussion 
or agreement. Another $24 billion is in-
cluded to address the coronavirus, even 
though discussions and negotiations 
are underway on another supplemental 
specifically for that purpose. 
These funds were added without any 
consultation with House Republicans, 
with the Senate, or with the President, 
and without that consultation, they 
have no chance of becoming law. 
Now, let’s remember, Mr. Speaker, 
some of the critical things these six ap-
propriations titles are supposed to sup-
port each year: our dedicated service-
members who put their lives on the 
line every day to defend and preserve 
our precious freedom; our courageous 
law enforcement officers who keep our 
communities safe; our hardworking 
small business owners and their work-
ers who are seeking to achieve the 
American Dream; our vital researchers 
who are looking for lifesaving treat-
ments and cures; our ports and water-
ways that are so critical to commerce; 
and, finally, they support our transit 
system upon which many Americans 
depend daily. 
All these things are put at risk, Mr. 
Speaker, unless Democrats and Repub-
licans work together. 
Unfortunately, along with the un-
workable approach taken in writing 
this package of bills, there are many 
partisan policy positions that must 
come out before it can become law. 
Many of these partisan provisions are 
similar to policies pushed through the 
House in recent months. 
Considering that the committee has 
had more than 100 hearings and brief-
ings to make important funding deci-
sions, it is disappointing that many of 
these provisions seem to have been dic-
tated from the top. 
A few examples: 
The bill jeopardizes our safety and 
security by allowing terrorists de-
tained at Guantanamo Bay to be 
brought to U.S. soil. 
It also includes language that would 
prevent the United States from exer-
cising the right to defend ourselves and 
our allies, such as Israel. 
In a time when China is seeking to 
dominate the world order, this bill 
would 
undermine 
America’s 
pre-
eminence in space exploration and cede 
the opportunity to China to dominate 
the next frontier. 
Also concerning, this minibus plays 
into 
the 
dangerous 
narrative 
of 
defunding the police through its failure 
to provide adequate funding for our 
Federal law enforcement agencies. 
Moreover, State and local law en-
forcement agencies are barred from re-
ceiving excess equipment from the De-
partment of Defense. 
As the ranking member of the Labor- 
HHS-Education Subcommittee, I am, 
of course, most familiar with the par-
tisan provisions contained there. In-
deed, the text of that bill includes a 
wide variety of harmful riders. 
First, it includes a partisan policy 
prescription that will tie the hands of 
the administration with respect to the 
Title X family planning program. Most 
notably, the riders would force the ad-
ministration to resume grants awarded 
to controversial groups that provide 
abortions, such as Planned Parenthood, 
and it would prevent the administra-
tion from granting waivers that pro-
tect deeply held religious beliefs of in-
stitutions, organizations, and individ-
uals that provide vital services funded 
in the bill. 
The Labor-HHS title also includes 
riders that would undo the Department 
of Labor’s rule clarifying the joint em-
ployer standard. If this policy rider 
were enacted, it would cause chaos for 
thousands of businesses and millions of 
employees, 
leaving 
them 
uncertain 
about the nature of the employment 
relationship. 
Not to be outdone, this bill also in-
cludes riders micromanaging and sec-
ond-guessing how HHS administers the 
Unaccompanied Alien Children Pro-
gram, which will ensure that the indi-
viduals devoting their energies to as-
sisting such unaccompanied minors 
will find themselves devoting their en-
ergy to becoming wrapped up evermore 
deeply in congressionally mandated red 
tape. 
Again, the same can be said for the 
other five divisions of this package. 
Throughout this minibus, the Demo-
cratic majority has inserted policy rid-
ers that tie the hands of the adminis-
tration. They have limited the ability 
of the administration to reprogram 
funds, even when necessary. They have 
inserted rider after rider aimed at pre-
venting the President from spending 
money on barriers and security meas-
ures at the southern border. And they 
have removed countless bipartisan pol-
icy provisions that have been carried in 
previous year’s bills. 
When it comes to Congress’ funda-
mental function of keeping the govern-
ment open and operating, good faith 
negotiation must be present at every 
stage. In this era of divided govern-
ment, that might be challenging, but 
we have proven time and time again 
that it is certainly not impossible. 
We did it when we negotiated the 2019 
budget agreement. We did it again 
when we moved through an orderly 
process for the 2020 fiscal year appro-
priations bills. And, finally, we did it 
most recently on four separate occa-
sions in dealing with the coronavirus. 
All of these successes were the prod-
uct of bipartisan negotiation in divided 
government. In those negotiations, nei-
ther side can dictate to the other or 
jam the other, or failure will result.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4113 
July 30, 2020 
In the days ahead, Mr. Speaker, we 
must work together on appropriations 
bills that reflect the bipartisan budget 
agreement and leave out controversial 
policy language. Until we do that, no 
appropriations bill will make it to the 
President’s desk, and we will run the 
risk later this year of either a long- 
term continuing resolution or even a 
government shutdown. 
For those reasons, Mr. Speaker, I 
stand in opposition to the second mini-
bus package, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Ohio 
(Ms. KAPTUR), the chairwoman of the 
Subcommittee on Energy and Water 
Development, and Related Agencies. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairwoman LOWEY, Ranking Member 
GRANGER, and Vice Ranking Member 
COLE. 
Please let me add my thanks to Chair 
LOWEY for her years of honorable, dedi-
cated, and affable service to this com-
mittee and to our Nation and for her 
recognition of the full potential of the 
Energy and Water division. 
Truly, she will be missed. Without 
question, she has made her mark 
across our Nation and the world. She 
can draw great satisfaction from that. 
Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank my 
brother, Stephen, who is watching from 
a distance. Without his strength and 
courage, I would not be here today. 
This bill represents an overwhelming 
majority of our total discretionary ap-
propriations, and with its passage, the 
House’s completion of 10 appropriation 
bills. 
Mr. Speaker, I extend congratula-
tions to Chairwoman LOWEY and, of 
course, Ranking Member KAY GRANGER 
for this feat in the middle of a global 
pandemic. 
Mr. Speaker, I also have to thank the 
marvelous committee staff who have 
made this possible. I wish to say that 
the Energy and Water division captures 
the American spirit of ingenuity and 
independence in our enterprising Na-
tion. 
Our bill lays the foundation for crit-
ical investments to combat climate 
change. It is poised to pass today as 
the most important funded climate 
change bill the 116th Congress will 
pass. 
b 1045 
Truly, this bill will sustain life in 
America and address global impera-
tives. 
Our bill upgrades and strengthens 
our Nation’s energy and water infra-
structure. 
It responsibly funds our Nation’s nu-
clear deterrent. It rejects the adminis-
tration’s dangerous plan to start nu-
clear explosive testing. 
The bill rejects the President’s dras-
tic and shortsighted proposed cuts that 
would harm America’s leadership at 
home and abroad. Instead, it invests in 
important programs that keep our Na-
tion at the forefront of global energy 
innovation. 
It enables the efficient shipment of 
goods. It provides water, irrigation, 
and electricity to millions upon mil-
lions of Americans, and these programs 
propel real economic growth and the 
jobs that go with it. 
Let me briefly walk through the bill. 
The Army Corps of Engineers re-
ceives $7.6 billion, the second year of 
record funding and an increase of $1.7 
billion above the budget request. 
The Bureau of Reclamation receives 
$1.64 billion, an increase of $508 million 
above the request. 
The Department of Energy receives 
$41 billion, an increase of $5.1 billion 
above the request. Within the Depart-
ment of Energy, the bill contains his-
toric funding levels for key programs 
critical to our future. 
First, energy efficiency and renew-
able energy receive $2.85 billion, $2.1 
billion above the request. ARPA-E, our 
advanced energy portfolio, receives 
$435 million, a record amount for a pro-
gram the President proposed to elimi-
nate, blunting America’s future. 
The Office of Science receives $7.05 
billion, $1.2 billion above the request. 
This bill also provides an increase for 
the home Weatherization Assistance 
Program. It helps ensure that addi-
tional low-income households have en-
ergy-efficient and more livable and af-
fordable futures in communities across 
our Nation. 
The National Nuclear Security Ad-
ministration receives $18 billion, $1.3 
billion above 2020. Within the Nuclear 
Security Administration, the bill re-
sponsibly funds America’s nuclear de-
terrent. 
Nuclear 
nonproliferation 
receives 
$2.24 billion, an increase of $209 million 
above the request. 
Finally, this bill prohibits the diver-
sion of essential Army Corps funds to 
be used for a border wall. In addition to 
regular appropriations, the bill cues up 
additional investments that will spur a 
job-rich, robust economic recovery by 
modernizing our water and energy in-
frastructure. 
I cannot thank our chair more for 
her efforts to make sure this occurs, 
including $17 billion to accelerate 
backlogged Army Corps of Engineers 
projects across this Nation; $3 billion 
to accelerate work on authorized rec-
lamation projects; and $25.3 billion for 
the Department of Energy to mod-
ernize infrastructure and deploy tech-
nologies for our Nation’s future clean 
energy. 
In sum, the Energy and Water divi-
sion will help put America back to 
work. It makes desperately needed in-
vestments in crumbling water infra-
structure across the Nation. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
the gentlewoman from Ohio an addi-
tional 30 seconds. 
Ms. KAPTUR. It maintains a credible 
nuclear deterrent while supporting a 
robust nonproliferation program. 
I would like to thank our ranking 
member, Mr. SIMPSON, for his partner-
ship and thank our subcommittee staff 
for their hard work: Jaime Shimek, Fa-
rouk Ophaso, Scott McKee, Marcel 
Caldwell, Mike Brain, Mark Arnone, 
and Angie Giancarlo on the other side. 
I want to thank all of our committee 
members, especially dear friends like 
Chairman 
VISCLOSKY; 
Chairman 
SERRANO; Chairwoman LOWEY; and on 
the Republican side, Mr. GRAVES, all of 
whom are retiring. They will take with 
them over a century of cumulative leg-
islative knowledge that simply cannot 
be replaced. 
It is a profound contribution but also 
a great loss to our Nation as you de-
part. May God bless you all. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 
minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman from Alabama (Mr. ADERHOLT), 
my good friend, the ranking member of 
the Commerce, Justice, Science, and 
Related Agencies Subcommittee of the 
Appropriations Committee. 
Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
this morning in opposition to H.R. 7617. 
I do appreciate the efforts of the ma-
jority in producing the FY 2021 appro-
priations package that we are consid-
ering on the floor today. This bill ad-
dresses many priorities and concerns 
that Members on both sides of the aisle 
have. 
There are a lot of things in this bill 
that we all agree on, particularly in di-
vision B of the Commerce, Justice, 
Science, and Related Agencies Appro-
priations Act. 
I 
do 
want 
to 
thank 
Chairman 
SERRANO for including the resources 
necessary to work toward completion 
of the Space Launch System, or, as it 
is commonly called, the SLS, including 
no less than $400 million for the Block 
1B version of the Space Launch Sys-
tem. 
With its powerful Exploration Upper 
Stage and the 8.4-meter payload fair-
ing, the Block 1B represents a trans-
formational strategic capability for 
the United States and deep-space ex-
ploration. 
NASA must increase the pace of SLS 
production to ensure that a Space 
Launch System is available for the Eu-
ropa missions and other future science 
missions, in addition to meeting all 
human exploration needs. 
I also want to thank Chairman 
SERRANO. Of course, as has been said, 
he is going to be retiring after this 
term. We certainly will miss him 
around here in the House Chamber and 
the Capitol complex. 
I want to thank him also for includ-
ing $110 million for the nuclear thermal 
propulsion, a level necessary to work 
toward the design of a flight dem-
onstration by 2024. 
In addition to some key space prior-
ities, the bill also addresses issues im-
pacting all of our communities. It in-
creases funding for critical drug court 
programs and other vital initiatives 
that address the opioid epidemic, as

that are helping to solve cold cases and 
eliminate the backlog of sexual assault 
cases. 
The bill also rightly directs the De-
partment of Justice to undertake novel 
approaches to addressing online child 
exploitation, obscenity, and human 
trafficking. 
In addition, the bill includes strong 
funding for the agencies to ensure com-
pliance with trade laws and agree-
ments. I am especially pleased that it 
funds the aluminum import monitoring 
program. 
The bill also supports the adminis-
tration’s Industries of the Future ini-
tiative with new investments in quan-
tum information science, artificial in-
telligence, 5G research, and advanced 
manufacturing. 
Finally, I want to thank Chairman 
SERRANO and his staff for including $10 
million for the VORTEX Southeast 
program. The number of killer torna-
does in the southeastern part of the 
United 
States 
is 
really 
dispropor-
tionate to the overall number of torna-
does throughout the country. VORTEX 
Southeast is doing critical work to bet-
ter understand environmental factors 
and improve weather forecast commu-
nications in my home region of the 
South and Southeast. 
However, with all of this being said, 
the strong funding that is in some 
areas of this bill, unfortunately, it 
makes the deficiencies in this bill even 
more glaring. 
For example, we all saw for ourselves 
several weeks ago, when the Nation 
witnessed the first U.S.-based launch of 
astronauts in 10 years, the passion of 
the American people at that time for a 
renewed era of space exploration and a 
recognition of the strategic value of 
U.S. space supremacy. 
Yet, this bill that we are debating 
today rejects America’s Moon-to-Mars 
Artemis initiative and the capabilities 
needed to land the first woman on the 
Moon by 2024. 
Worse still, this bill caters to the 
radical demands of defunding so many 
of our law enforcement agencies across 
the board. None of the Federal law en-
forcement agencies in this bill, includ-
ing the FBI, the ATF, the DEA, or the 
U.S. Marshals Service, are fully funded 
in this legislation. 
The Attorney General has made 
fighting gun crime one of his priorities, 
yet none of his initiatives received the 
requested increase. Even bipartisan re-
quests to address violent gun crime, 
along with the request to increase re-
sources for the investigation and pros-
ecution of human trafficking, child ex-
ploitation, and high-tech organized 
crime at the Federal level, have been 
marginalized in this bill. 
The bill includes so many new unau-
thorized conditions on the Byrne JAG 
and COPS programs, it seems these 
grants will basically be halted indefi-
nitely. 
I have no doubt that our side of the 
aisle could have supported some bipar-
tisan police training reforms and other 
policy initiatives, had the majority not 
bowed to the pressure of defunding so 
many of these programs. 
The bill also sets a terrible precedent 
by proposing to use hard-earned tax-
payer dollars to defend people crossing 
the border illegally. Sadly, it will only 
serve to further entice people to make 
that dangerous journey as they head 
north. 
This bill eliminates several long-
standing Second Amendment protec-
tions that have enjoyed historical bi-
partisan support. The elimination of 
freedoms that are not even associated 
with firearms is an unfortunate out-
growth of the gun control agenda with 
no basis in the science of criminal jus-
tice. 
In closing, I want to thank Chair-
woman LOWEY and Chairman SERRANO 
and all of their staff for their hard 
work. They both have great careers, 
and we will certainly miss them. 
Just in closing, I do want to say 
thanks to the minority staff: Stephanie 
Gadbois, Darren Benjamin, and Kristin 
Clarkson, along with the majority 
staff, Bob Bonner, Jeff Ashford, Trisha 
Castaneda, 
Faye 
Cobb, 
T.J. 
Lowdermilk, Shannon McCully, and 
B.G. Wright. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield the 
gentleman from Alabama an additional 
30 seconds. 
Mr. ADERHOLT. I continue to be 
committed to working with the major-
ity in good faith as we proceed through 
the legislative process, and I look for-
ward to the debate that we will have 
today. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, it is such an honor for 
me to yield to the next speaker, the 
gentleman from Indiana (Mr. VIS-
CLOSKY), who is the chairman of the 
Subcommittee on Defense. 
Mr. VISCLOSKY has announced that he 
is going to retire, but he has com-
mitted so much of his knowledge, his 
energy, to a bill that requires a lot of 
knowledge of detail. It is a very, very 
difficult bill, but Mr. VISCLOSKY has 
mastered it. 
At the same time that the gentleman 
has focused on this very important bill, 
he remembers all of his constituents 
back home. My vision of Mr. VISCLOSKY 
was writing notes and participating in 
the hearing, but it was clear to me that 
the gentleman served every one of his 
constituents with distinction as well as 
being chairman of this committee. 
Mr. Speaker, I say to Mr. VISCLOSKY: 
Good luck, my friend. Good health, my 
friend. I wish you everything the best 
on your retirement, and more time 
with family and friends. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the 
gentleman from Indiana (Mr. VIS-
CLOSKY), the outstanding chair of the 
Subcommittee on Defense. 
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I 
want to thank the chairwoman for her 
very kind remarks. I also want to 
thank NITA for her friendship over the 
years. As I am going to again mention 
in my prepared remarks, the gentle-
woman’s life of service to not only her 
constituency, not only to this great 
Nation, but to the people of the world, 
given all of her work on the Sub-
committee on State, Foreign Oper-
ations, and Related Agencies, and 
again, having a broad, long-term view 
of dedicating her life to make sure that 
the world we leave is going to be better 
for our children and posterity. 
So I appreciate that as well. As I 
have quipped, if the gentlewoman is 
not going to be back next year, I am 
not going to be back next year. 
I, first of all, do want to thank my 
ranking member and my friend, Mr. 
CALVERT, for his continued commit-
ment to being collegial, transparent, 
and bipartisan. 
I cannot overstate the value of the 
gentleman’s friendship and the part-
nership we have enjoyed over the 
years. He is a gentleman. 
Further, I would again appreciate 
and acknowledge the work of chair-
woman, Mrs. LOWEY, who is also de-
parting the House at the end of this 
year. Again I commend you, NITA, for 
your dedicated life of service and a 
commitment to leaving this world bet-
ter. Thank you very much.

I want to also thank the sub-
committee 
staff, 
particularly 
our 
clerks, Becky Leggieri and Johnnie 
Kaberle; as well as Walter Hearne, 
Brooke Boyer, Ariana Sarar, Kiya 
Batmanglidj, 
Jackie 
Ripke, 
David 
Bortnick, Matt Bower, Bill Adkins, 
Jennifer Chartrand, Hayden Milberg, 
Paul Kilbride, Shannon Richter, Sher-
ry Young, Kyle McFarland, Jamie 
McCormick, Brian Potts, and Nick 
Vance; those in Ranking Member CAL-
VERT’s personal office, as well, Rebecca 
Keightley and William Hendrickson; 
and my personal staff, Joe DeVooght 
and our fellow from the Department of 
Defense, Major Stephen Cash. 
I am profoundly grateful to each for 
their dedicated service to the public, 
for their acumen, and for their gen-
erosity of spirit. 
The bill continues to focus on the 
well-being and morale of those in uni-
form and their families as well as DOD 
civilians and their communities. The 
bill provides an additional $116 million 
for upgrades to childcare facilities, and 
the report contains language directing 
the military services to present inno-
vative ideas to address the serious 
backlog for childcare. 
It provides $1.49 billion for environ-
mental restoration activities, which is 
$415 million above the request. 
We provide $327 million to address 
the ongoing epidemic of sexual assault 
in the military and at the service acad-
emies, which is $49 million more than 
requested. Despite dire warnings, the 
Department’s budget for sexual assault 
prevention and response remains stag-
nant. The Department has got to do a 
much better job.

July 30, 2020 
Another area of deep concern for me 
is the Department’s lack of compliance 
with many congressionally directed re-
porting requirements. For example, 
last year, the committee directed the 
Department to submit a report on its 
contracts for advertising services with 
socially and economically disadvan-
taged small businesses. The report was 
supposed to accompany the Depart-
ment’s fiscal year 2021 budgets submis-
sion in February, but it was trans-
mitted to the committee on July 14, 5 
months late and the same day we 
marked up the bill. Regrettably, re-
porting deadlines are often missed, 
making it much more difficult for the 
committee to make timely decisions. 
The bill, again, contains several pro-
visions to rein in the Department’s 
now habitual redirection of funding 
and contravention of congressional in-
tent. One DOD official in a meeting 
earlier this year referred to these 
transfers of $10 billion as anomalies. I 
refer to them as habitual abuses. The 
sense of entitlement in these actions is 
galling, and I hope that at some point 
the Department will have the leader-
ship in place to recognize it is Con-
gress’ constitutional prerogative and 
restore trust to the appropriations 
process. 
Mr. Speaker, before I begin with my re-
marks on the fiscal year (FY) 2021 bill, I would 
like to briefly discuss some concerns I have as 
a longtime member of the House Appropria-
tions Committee. 
The Committee has a unique responsibility. 
It is charged with funding and oversight of the 
entire government, and ensuring that it is as 
effective and as efficient as possible. How-
ever, in some ways, the Committee is at its 
nadir in terms of its ability to achieve bipar-
tisan solutions. In part, this is due to the Budg-
et Control Act of 2011, which is an ill-fated at-
tempt to balance the federal budget by cutting 
only discretionary spending. 
Currently, mandatory spending and interest 
on the debt represent 70 percent of the money 
spent each year by the federal government. 
Discretionary spending, which is an invest-
ment in the future, makes up just 30 percent 
of federal spending. When less than 30 per-
cent of young Americans are qualified to join 
the military, it is clear we need to invest more 
in our nation’s health, education, infrastruc-
ture, and jobs. Unfortunately, from my per-
spective, recent Congresses have mistakenly 
relied on mandatory spending to avoid making 
difficult decisions on discretionary spending on 
an annual basis. A case in point, last week the 
House passed a bill that will provide much 
needed funding to address the maintenance 
backlog in our public lands. But the bill utilizes 
mandatory funding mechanisms that further 
decrease the ability of Congress and the Ap-
propriations Committee to exercise annual dis-
cretion and oversight. 
I implore my colleagues who serve in the 
next Congress to avoid repeating the mistakes 
of the recent past. The lasting solution to our 
nation’s fiscal problems will only be realized 
by confronting the continued growth in manda-
tory spending while simultaneously increasing 
revenues. In the year 2000, the last year the 
federal government had a surplus, revenues, 
as a percentage of GDP, were 20 percent. In 
fiscal year 2019, revenues were 16.3 percent. 
We need revenue to invest in the future of our 
country, and every appropriated dollar is an in-
vestment. 
Moving onto the FY 2021 bill, I first want to 
thank my Ranking Member and friend, Mr. 
CALVERT, for his continued commitment to 
being collegial, transparent, and bipartisan. I 
cannot overstate the value of his friendship 
and the partnership we have enjoyed over the 
years. 
I also want to express my sincere gratitude 
to Chairwoman LOWEY and Ranking Member 
GRANGER. We would not be here without their 
leadership and dedication. 
Further, I would like to acknowledge that 
Chairwoman LOWEY will be joining me in de-
parting the House at the end of this year. I 
commend her for a dedicated life of service 
and commitment to leaving this world a little 
bit better than the way she found it. Thank you 
very much. It is a joy to work with you. 
I want to thank the Subcommittee staff, par-
ticularly, our clerks, Becky Leggieri and 
Johnnie Kaberle, as well as Walter Hearne, 
Brooke Boyer, Ariana Sarar, Jackie Ripke, 
David Bortnick, Matt Bower, Bill Adkins, Jen-
nifer Chartrand, Hayden Milberg, Paul Kilbride, 
Shannon Richter, Sherry Young, Kyle McFar-
land, Kiya Batmanglidj, Jamie McCormick, 
Brian Potts, and Nick Vance, my personal of-
fice staff, Joe DeVooght and Stephen Cash, 
and those in Ranking Member CALVERT’s per-
sonal office, Rebecca Keightley and William 
Hendrickson. Having to assemble the bulk of 
the bill and report remotely increased the de-
gree of difficulty substantially, as it has for all 
of the subcommittees. I commend them for 
their professionalism and acumen. 
The bill would provide $694.6 billion for the 
Department of Defense budget, which is $1.3 
billion above the fiscal year 2020 enacted 
level and $3. 7 billion below the request. The 
base funding recommendation is $626.2 bil-
lion, which is $3.5 billion above the fiscal year 
2020 enacted level and $3.5 billion below the 
request. The overseas contingency operations 
recommendation is $68.4 billion, which is $2.2 
billion below the fiscal year 2020 enacted level 
and $215 million below the request. 
This legislation recognizes the complex 
challenges the members of our Armed Forces 
and intelligence community face every day 
throughout the world, and it aims to ensure 
that they are able to continue to meet these 
challenges and complete their missions to the 
best of their abilities. To support this forward- 
looking posture, the bill makes major invest-
ments in operations and maintenance, pro-
curement, and research and development. 
I also think it is important to highlight some 
investments the Committee has made with re-
gards to the current COVID–19 pandemic. 
This legislation would provide: 
$758 million in procurement for COVID–19 
recovery for second, third and fourth tier sup-
pliers. This has been of particular interest to 
Mr. CALVERT, and I appreciate his advocacy of 
this issue; 
$450 million in operation and maintenance 
for COVID–19 recovery and resupply; and 
$150 million in the Defense Health Program 
for COVID–19 response. 
In addition to the funding enumerated 
above, the legislation places several reporting 
requirements on the Department specific to 
COVID–19. The budgetary impacts of the pan-
demic on the Department are still largely un-
determined. Some programs will cost more. 
However, there will be savings obtained 
through delayed or cancelled events and ac-
tivities. It is imperative that the Committee and 
Congress have as much detail as possible to 
properly delegate funding and to conduct over-
sight. 
And most importantly, the bill continues to 
focus on the well-being and morale of those in 
uniform and their families, as well as DoD ci-
vilians and their communities. 
The bill provides an additional $116 million 
for upgrades to childcare facilities and the re-
port contains language directing the military 
services to present innovative ideas to ad-
dress the serious backlog for childcare. 
The bill provides $1.49 billion for environ-
mental restoration activities, which is $415 mil-
lion above the request. This increased funding 
will help DoD address the significant and sa-
lient public health risks associated with PFOS/ 
PFOA. 
The bill and report take steps to stop the 
Department from closing military treatment fa-
cilities and from reducing military healthcare 
billets, which would have cost $334.6 million 
this fiscal year. These plans were poorly justi-
fied to the Committee prior to the pandemic, 
and even harder to defend under current con-
ditions. 
The bill provides $327 million to address the 
ongoing epidemic of sexual assault in the mili-
tary and at the service academies, which is 
$49 million more than requested. And I must 
express my personal upset over this issue. 
The most recent report on the sexual assault 
rate for women has jumped a shocking 50 
percent from 2016 to 2018. Despite dire warn-
ings, the Department’s budget for sexual as-
sault prevention and response remains stag-
nant. And I would also say it is not just a 
question of money. Year after year after year, 
we have testimony from officials who contend 
that they are really committed to solving this 
problem. And yet we are going backwards. 
The Department must do a much better job. 
These efforts and several others within the 
bill will have an immediate positive impact on 
people’s quality of life. 
Another area of concern for me is the De-
partment’s lack of compliance with many Con-
gressionally directed reporting requirements. 
For example, last year the Committee directed 
the Department to submit a report on its con-
tracts for advertising services with socially and 
economically disadvantaged small businesses. 
The report was supposed to accompany the 
Department’s FY 2021 budget submission in 
February, but it was transmitted to the Com-
mittee on July 14, five months late and the 
same day we marked up the bill. Regrettably, 
reporting deadlines are often missed, making 
it much more difficult for the Committee to 
make timely decisions. 
The bill, again, contains several provisions 
to rein in the Department’s habitual redirection 
of funding and contravention of congressional 
intent. These actions have irreparably dam-
aged the Department’s credibility with the 
Committee. One DoD official, in a meeting, re-
ferred to these transfers of billions of dollars 
as anomalies. I refer to them as habitual 
abuses by the Department. 
In recent years, the Department leadership 
has not missed an opportunity to claim that a 
3 percent to 5 percent annual growth rate in 
the defense budget is necessary to support 
the National Defense Strategy. But at the

July 30, 2020 
same time, those same leaders facilitated the 
transfer of nearly $10 billion to non-defense 
activities not enumerated in their own National 
Defense Strategy. And while this was hap-
pening, they also have the temerity to repeat-
edly request more flexibility from Congress for 
executing their budget and for reprogramming 
authorities. The sense of entitlement in these 
actions is galling, and I hope that at some 
point the Department will have the leadership 
in place to recognize Congress’s constitutional 
prerogative and restore trust to the appropria-
tions process. 
In closing, I would again thank my chair, 
ranking member, and all of the members, who 
have logged so many hours in making this bill 
possible. I look forward to debate on the 
amendments. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 7 
minutes to the gentleman from Idaho 
(Mr. SIMPSON). My very good friend is 
the ranking member on the Energy and 
Water Development, and Related Agen-
cies Subcommittee on Appropriations. 
Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my good friend from Oklahoma for 
yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in reluctant 
opposition to H.R. 7617, the six-bill fis-
cal year 2021 appropriations package 
that includes the Energy and Water 
Development appropriations bill. 
I had hoped to have been able to sup-
port the appropriations bill this year. 
Unfortunately, while the bill includes 
some bipartisan priorities, excessive 
spending and partisan riders mean I am 
unable to support the bill at this time. 
I am pleased that the bill continues 
significant investments in our Nation’s 
water resources infrastructure, includ-
ing harbor maintenance activities. Un-
fortunately, the majority is choosing 
to ignore several opportunities to en-
hance water security in the drought- 
prone West. The bill cuts funding for 
water storage projects, blocks a crit-
ical water storage project in Cali-
fornia, and unnecessarily delays the 
use of previously appropriated funds 
for other water storage projects. 
Republicans—in fact, I think every 
Republican from the California delega-
tion—filed multiple amendments to 
correct these problems, but none of 
them were made in order. Even a sim-
ple amendment to highlight the impor-
tance of funding for water storage 
projects was left out of the rule. 
In fact, every other Energy and 
Water amendment that followed the 
same format was made in order and 
will be in en bloc amendments expected 
to be adopted. Yet the majority refused 
to allow the full House to even consider 
and to even debate these critical West-
ern water storage issues. 
One bipartisan priority of great im-
portance to me is the Department of 
Energy’s 
nuclear 
energy 
program. 
While the bill addresses several pri-
ority activities within the program, 
overall funding for the program is not 
reflective of its importance to the na-
tional and global energy future. 
The committee report repeatedly ex-
presses the majority’s intent to address 
climate change, and we have heard 
that today several times. Yet nuclear 
energy, a carbon-free, baseload source 
of power, suffers one of the largest cuts 
from enacted levels in the entire bill. 
I am pleased to support Mr. WEBER’s 
amendment highlighting the impor-
tance of the versatile test reactor. This 
project will provide a capability that 
will help with the development of next- 
generation fast neutron reactors as 
well as benefit materials development 
for today’s reactors. I am hopeful that, 
moving forward, we can work together 
towards stronger funding for the entire 
nuclear energy program, including the 
versatile test reactor. 
One of my main concerns with the 
bill is the significant amount of emer-
gency spending, mandatory spending, 
and other gimmicks that effectively 
undermine the defense and nondefense 
spending levels agreed to in last year’s 
bipartisan budget deal. 
The emergency spending provisions 
alone almost double the cost of the En-
ergy and Water bill, all without discus-
sion, let alone buy-in from House Re-
publicans. That is why I support Mr. 
PERRY’s amendment to strike the 
emergency spending in the Energy and 
Water bill. If there is a demonstrated 
need for spending above and beyond the 
bipartisan caps, it should only occur as 
a result of bipartisan discussions on 
that issue, not as a partisan title to an 
annual appropriations bill. 
Even with all the additional spend-
ing, however, the bill still short-
changes funding for the nuclear weap-
ons program by almost $2 billion. Cur-
rently, much of our nuclear weapons 
complex infrastructure is old, out-
dated, and some of it is literally falling 
apart. We must uphold our Nation’s 
strong nuclear deterrence posture, and 
to do that, we must adequately fund 
the activities necessary to maintain a 
safe, reliable, and effective nuclear 
weapons stockpile. 
The bill includes numerous policy 
riders and authorizing provisions, most 
of which we know will be unacceptable 
to the administration and will need to 
be addressed before a final bill can be 
enacted. I believe one of these riders is 
intended to reaffirm current law with 
respect to the authority of the Sec-
retary of Energy, and I strongly sup-
port that intent. 
The House will consider an amend-
ment to strike this language due to 
concerns that the text goes beyond the 
intent and would unintentionally dis-
rupt the important work of the Nuclear 
Weapons Council. While I certainly un-
derstand those concerns, I am also con-
cerned about recent efforts in the Sen-
ate to undermine the authority of the 
Secretary of Energy. 
The Secretary must continue to have 
full authority for appropriately bal-
ancing priorities across the entire De-
partment, including the nuclear weap-
ons program. Unless or until those Sen-
ate efforts are defeated once and for 
all, I believe it would be better to im-
prove the bill text to avoid unintended 
consequences rather than strike the 
language entirely. 
Finally, I am disappointed that the 
bill does not include any funding to ad-
vance the Yucca Mountain license ap-
plication process and, instead, offers a 
false promise of interim storage as a 
solution to the nuclear waste issue. 
Continuing the license process is how 
we ensure an authoritative scientific 
decision—not a political decision—on 
the safety of Yucca Mountain. 
Over the past few decades, electricity 
customers across the country have paid 
roughly $43 billion, with accrued inter-
est, into the nuclear waste fund for 
permanent disposal of nuclear waste. 
Due to the political decision to halt ad-
vancement of a permanent repository, 
however, it is the taxpayers—not the 
ratepayers, but the taxpayers in all 435 
congressional districts—who currently 
are paying approximately $2.2 million 
per day, or more than $800 million per 
year, to cover the cost of temporary 
onsite storage. 
There has long been broad, bipartisan 
support 
for 
continuing 
the 
Yucca 
Mountain licensing process, and the 
Energy and Water bill should reflect 
that reality. 
Despite our disagreements over the 
issues I have mentioned, I want to 
close by thanking Chairwoman KAPTUR 
and the majority staff for their dedica-
tion and hard work on this bill. Ms. 
KAPTUR has continued the cooperative 
tradition of the subcommittee, even 
during 
this 
year’s 
unusual 
cir-
cumstances, and I appreciate that very 
much. 
I would also like to thank Chair-
woman LOWEY and Ranking Member 
GRANGER for their support. 
Lastly, I would like to thank the 
staff on both sides of the aisle, particu-
larly my staff in my office, Sarah Can-
non, who is on kind of semi-leave about 
ready to deliver another child. So she 
does a great job. 
I look forward to working together as 
this bill moves forward in the legisla-
tive process to develop a final Energy 
and Water bill that reflects a balanced 
set of priorities. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Con-
necticut (Ms. DELAURO), who is the 
outstanding and passionate chair of the 
Subcommittee on Labor, Health and 
Human Services, Education, and Re-
lated Agencies. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
speak on a portion of the bill for Labor, 
Health and Human Services, Edu-
cation, and Related Agencies. 
To start, let me commend my dear 
friend, the chair of the full Appropria-
tions Committee, Congresswoman NITA 
LOWEY, who is a path breaker and a 
change maker. NITA LOWEY has made 
this Nation and the world a far better 
place because of the commitments that 
she has to the issues that come before 
this subcommittee: quality education, 
after school programs, and protections 
for working men and women. 
Under her leadership, appropriations 
proceeded despite, and in response to, 
this virus and the disparities that it

has exposed. She is a force. She leaves 
a legacy of excellence and of innova-
tion, and, as I have said before on a 
number of occasions, I will miss my 
friend. I will miss her in the Halls, and 
I will miss her in committee, but our 
friendship carries on. 
Also, I want to say thank you to 
Ranking Member COLE for his friend-
ship and for his gracious, collaborative 
spirit in which we work together on 
the Labor-HHS bill, which we have for 
the last several years in producing the 
bill. While we have differences of opin-
ion on issues, there is no difference of 
opinion on the shared values that we 
have in providing opportunity and cre-
ating opportunity for the people of this 
country. So I thank the gentleman 
very, very much. 
For 2021, the Labor-HHS bill includes 
$196.5 billion in overall funding. It is an 
increase of $2.4 billion above the 2020 
enacted level, $20.8 billion above the 
President’s 2021 budget request. 
The bill supports some of our Na-
tion’s most critical programs from 
early Head Start, Social Security, 
CDC, and NIH. They touch individuals 
and families throughout their lives and 
help to create that opportunity to 
allow America to realize its values and 
its promise. 
The Labor, Health and Human Serv-
ices, Education, and Related Agencies 
Subcommittee also continues to be 
central to our response to COVID–19. 
We are at the center of this health and 
economic crisis and the serious racial 
and economic disparities that it has ex-
posed. 
Since March, we have appropriated 
$280 billion in emergency funding for 
education, for health, and for working 
people throughout the pandemic. We 
add $300 billion more in the HEROES 
bill: $197 billion in health, $100 billion 
in education, and $3.1 billion in labor. 
Today we seek to build on those 
emergency and supplemental packages 
so that we can be making it safe for 
our economy to reopen. 
Our Members recognize the impor-
tance of this bill. The subcommittee 
received more than 15,000 requests for 
today’s bill, and I am proud to say that 
we were able to fill so many of them ei-
ther in total or in part, and that is 
from both sides of the aisle. 
Let me provide a brief overview. 
Together, we are making invest-
ments for the Nation for health, edu-
cation, good-paying safe and secure 
jobs, and to address the disparities that 
have been exposed by this virus: 
For health, $96 billion for programs 
at the U.S. Department of Health and 
Human Services, an increase in $1.5 bil-
lion above 2020. That is a $500 million 
increase for the NIH and a $230 million 
increase for the CDC. 
For families, children, and seniors, 
we provide $150 million more for Head 
Start, $100 million more for childcare, 
$25 million more for preschool develop-
ment grants, and $25 million more for 
the Low Income Home Energy Assist-
ance Program. 
For education, a $716 million increase 
from 2020. That includes $254 million 
for title 1 education for the disadvan-
taged, $194 million more for IDEA 
State grants for special education, $150 
more for a maximum Pell grant, and 
$50 million more for minority-serving 
higher education institutions. 
As the school year approaches, while 
the White House chooses to make that 
a political battle to threaten schools 
and teachers, instead of beating them 
down, we are lifting them up to invest 
in them so that they can meet the edu-
cation and the life challenges that face 
them. 
For working Americans, this bill pro-
vides an increase for the Department of 
Labor of $254 million, $12.7 billion in 
total. 
When 
unemployment 
remains 
at 
alarming high levels, we are investing 
in job opportunity and worker protec-
tion with $50 million for more work-
force 
innovation 
and 
opportunity 
grants. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
the gentlewoman from Connecticut 
(Ms. DELAURO) an additional 30 sec-
onds. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, there is 
$12 million more for Job Corps and a 
$15 million increase for worker protec-
tion programs. 
We plan future investments for our 
public health agencies in an emer-
gency, $24.4 billion; for the CDC, $9 bil-
lion; NIH, $5 billion; for BARDA, $4.5 
billion. 
Mr. Speaker, we are going to look at 
ensuring oversight on these dollars so 
that the scientists are in charge and 
not the politicians. 
b 1115 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has again ex-
pired. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 1 minute to the gentle-
woman. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, it is 
time for us to move boldly, swiftly. 
Let’s defeat the virus and the racial 
disparities it has exposed in health, 
education, and the economy. We can 
and must do so by passing the bill be-
fore us, and I urge my colleagues to in-
vest in our constituents, invest in beat-
ing this virus, and closing those gaps it 
has exposed. We need to vote ‘‘yes’’ on 
this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I will miss my col-
leagues, Mr. VISCLOSKY, Mr. SERRANO, 
Mr. GRAVES, Mrs. ROBY, and Mr. HURD. 
It has been an honor to serve with 
them. And to our staff in the majority: 
Brad Allen, Jared Bass, Jennifer Cama, 
Robin Juliano, Jackie Kilroy, Laurie 
Mignone, Stephen Steigleder, and Phil-
ip Tizzani. And my personal staff: 
Letty Mederos, Liz Albertine, and 
Caitlin Peruccio. I thank Ranking 
Member GRANGER, and to Shalanda 
Young and to Chris Bigelow for all of 
the help you provided us during this 
period of time. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman from California, (Mr. CALVERT), 
my very good friend, the ranking Re-
publican on the Subcommittee on De-
fense Appropriations. 
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
reluctant opposition to the defense ap-
propriations division of H.R. 7617. 
However, first, I thank the full com-
mittee chairwoman, NITA LOWEY, for 
her dedicated leadership and years of 
service to the Committee on Appro-
priations and to this institution. 
I also extend my deep gratitude to 
Chairman VISCLOSKY, who has been a 
great partner on the committee and a 
friend these many years. You will both 
be very much missed, and I wish you 
all the happiness in your next chapter. 
I also thank our full committee rank-
ing member, KAY
GRANGER, for her 
leadership on this bill. She has been a 
tireless advocate for our men and 
women in uniform. 
Mr. Speaker, the bill before us today 
provides funding for many key pro-
grams consistent with the National De-
fense Strategy and is focused on great 
power competition with China and Rus-
sia. 
The bill makes critical investments 
in 5th generation combat aircraft, 
ships, and an additional Virginia-class 
submarine, while also providing the 
combatant commanders the resources 
necessary to carry out their missions. 
The bill also continues to invest in re-
search and development of new tech-
nologies essential to maintaining U.S. 
military superiority. 
I am also pleased at the focus on pro-
viding for the health and welfare of our 
men and women in uniform. It reflects 
the longstanding concerns that so 
many of our members have had with 
defense health programs; sexual as-
sault prevention, suicide prevention, 
and a long-awaited electronic health 
record. 
These are all examples of critical in-
vestments in this bill that I strongly 
support. That is why it is so unfortu-
nate that important initiatives that 
have broad support are overshadowed 
by political issues. 
While this is a very strong bill, there 
are numerous provisions, like the pro-
hibition on funding for the southwest 
border wall construction and limita-
tions on DOD’s general and special 
transfer authorities that will draw a 
veto threat from the administration. It 
is important that the bill becomes law 
as soon as possible. 
While I cannot support it in its cur-
rent form, I am committed to working 
with the majority to produce a bill 
that can be signed by the President. 
The importance of getting a bill done 
on time cannot be overstated. Accord-
ing to a DOD comptroller, a continuing 
resolution wastes roughly $1.7 billion a 
month. $1.7 billion a month wasted. 
This year, a CR would halt many of the 
modernization priorities that are vital 
to maintaining our military superi-
ority over near-peer threats, such as

China and Russia. This is no way to 
run the most sophisticated and profes-
sional fighting force in the world. 
There are currently over 200,000 U.S. 
servicemembers deployed around the 
world, ensuring that threats never 
meet our shores. They do their job 
every day; there is no allowance for 
pause or break. They do what we ask, 
and it is time for Congress to do what 
is necessary and required in the U.S. 
Constitution and provide for the com-
mon defense of our Nation in a timely 
and consistent manner. 
Mr. Speaker, in closing, I thank the 
staff, both minority and majority staff, 
for their hard work during some very 
challenging times. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the distinguished gentle-
woman from California (Ms. ROYBAL- 
ALLARD), the hardworking chairwoman 
of the Subcommittee on Homeland Se-
curity, a woman with endless patience 
and expertise who has worked with doz-
ens of groups who have such definite 
ideas on this bill. 
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise in support of H.R. 7617, and I 
commend the chairs of the subcommit-
tees who worked so hard to produce 
funding bills that reflect our ‘‘For the 
People’’ vision for America. 
The appropriation bills in this mini-
bus provide critical resources for our 
wide range of vital domestic and de-
fense priorities. As vice chair of the 
Labor-HHS Subcommittee, I will focus 
on that title of the bill which, thanks 
to the efforts of Chairwoman ROSA 
DELAURO and Ranking Member COLE, 
upholds our promise to Americans by 
investing in our workers’ needs, sup-
porting the education of our children, 
and ensuring all our families and com-
munities have access to quality health 
programs during this pandemic and be-
yond. 
For example, the bill makes strong 
investments to strengthen the ability 
of our public health system to over-
come the current COVID crisis, and 
equally important, to have the re-
sources to build the infrastructure crit-
ical to our ability to successfully ad-
dress public health challenges in the 
future. 
Robust investments are also made to 
address the health disparities COVID– 
19 has intensified, and the bill commis-
sions a National Academies of Sciences 
study on the most promising solutions 
to advance health equity in the years 
ahead. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased the Labor- 
HHS bill contains substantial funding 
for many of my requests to support 
mothers and babies during this pan-
demic and the months to follow. This 
includes large increases to the Mater-
nal and Child Health Services Block 
Grant and the Healthy Start program, 
as well as strong investments in 
breastfeeding support and a maternal 
mental health hotline. 
Today, our children and families are 
suffering from the prolonged isolation 
of school closures and the challenges of 
learning remotely while parents try to 
work. As we fight the pandemic, this 
bill makes critical investments to en-
sure our children safely receive a high- 
quality education. 
During a time when so many Ameri-
cans have lost jobs due to the economic 
impact of this pandemic, the strong 
outlays in job training and apprentice-
ships will help American workers gain 
the skills needed to get well-paying 
jobs. 
Mr. Speaker, Vice President Biden 
has said, ‘‘Don’t tell me what you 
value. Show me your budget, and I will 
tell you what you value.’’ 
I 
thank 
Chairmen 
VISCLOSKY, 
SERRANO, QUIGLEY, and PRICE, and 
Chairwomen KAPTUR and DELAURO, for 
outlining those values so clearly in 
their appropriations bill, and I urge 
passage of this minibus. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 
minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman 
from 
Florida 
(Mr. 
DIAZ- 
BALART), my very good friend and 
classmate. 
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Speaker, let 
me start by thanking Chairwoman 
LOWEY and Ranking Member GRANGER 
for their leadership. 
A lot has been said about Chair-
woman LOWEY, and I don’t want to re-
peat myself, but the bottom line is: 
You are one class act, and you will be 
sorely missed by this institution. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman PRICE 
for his friendship, his transparency, 
and his openness in this process. I 
strongly support so many aspects of 
the T-HUD portion of this bill. I am 
particularly pleased with the inclusion 
of funding and language requests from 
Members on both sides of the aisle in a 
nonpartisan way. 
I appreciate, for example, the $300 
million for port infrastructure grants. 
It is important, obviously, for coastal 
States like Florida, but also for our en-
tire country’s freight network, and our 
economy. It is clear that ports are cru-
cial for our economy. 
The bill also includes $389 million for 
a Maritime Academy Training Ship 
program—something that had been, 
frankly, ignored for too many years. 
This bill supports the training ship in 
Texas, which will double as a disaster 
response asset for the region. 
The bill continues investments in our 
Nation’s highways, rail, transit and 
airport infrastructure. It builds on 
progress we have made in recent years 
through, again, this bill creating jobs, 
improving the quality of life, and spur-
ring innovation. The bill makes impor-
tant progress to enhance safety on our 
roads and railways. 
Now, these are programs championed 
for years by Chairwoman LOWEY, and, 
obviously, Chairman PRICE. And I 
share her support in these areas, but, 
again, this has been her driving force. 
Funding for FAA will modernize air 
traffic technologies, improve the safety 
of our skies, and address noise concerns 
from our colleagues in our commu-
nities. 
The bill renews housing assistance 
for millions of Americans in need. It is 
our duty. It is our duty to meet this 
commitment, especially for our elder-
ly, for our disabled, for our heroes, for 
our veterans. These housing assistance 
programs are not just a safety net for 
millions of Americans, but they are a 
path for opportunity and self-suffi-
ciency to so many. 
Chairman PRICE has included new in-
novative programs to support our ef-
forts to end homelessness in America, 
including a focus on families at risk of 
becoming homeless, victims of domes-
tic violence, and veterans. 
Again, Chairman PRICE has made so 
many smart and, by the way, tough de-
cisions, but smart, good policy deci-
sions that I, unfortunately, like my 
colleagues, find it unfortunate that I 
cannot support this bill in its current 
form right now. 
A major portion of this T-HUD bill 
division is based on, frankly, a funding 
gimmick—$75 billion in new infrastruc-
ture spending is designated as an emer-
gency. This violates last year’s bipar-
tisan agreement. It puts our entire ap-
propriations process at risk. The bill 
also includes controversial DOT and 
HUD policy riders. Some of these were 
dropped last year, again, consistent 
with the budget agreement that we 
all—most of us—voted for. And they 
have to be dropped again. 
Despite these concerns and, obvi-
ously, despite the fact that at this mo-
ment I can’t support the bill, I need to 
thank Chairman PRICE
for making, 
again, as I mentioned, some really, 
really good important decisions. He 
had to make some tough decisions. 
That is what this job entails when you 
are an appropriator and you are a car-
dinal, but he has done so. 
Mr. Speaker, I am confident—no, I 
am certain—that we will be able to ad-
dress these concerns as this process 
moves forward. Chairman PRICE knows 
how to reach across the aisle and how 
to strike a deal, as does our committee 
leadership, Chairwoman LOWEY, and 
our ranking member, as well. 
The question is not ‘‘if,’’ but ‘‘when’’ 
we will be able to get a bill that can be 
sent to the President and will be able 
to get his signature. Again, this bill 
isn’t that right now, but I am confident 
that we will be able to move forward. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman 
from 
North 
Carolina 
(Mr. 
PRICE), the chairman of the Sub-
committee 
on 
Transportation 
and 
Housing and Urban Development. 
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my colleague and 
friend, Chairwoman LOWEY. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of this bill, particularly the division 
involving Transportation, HUD appro-
priations for fiscal year 2021. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and 
the 
former 
chairman 
of 
our 
sub-
committee, MARIO DIAZ-BALART, for his 
kind words this morning and for his co-
operation throughout this process. We

do work well together, and we share 
many, many goals for this legislation. 
We have a bill that reflects that col-
laborative work. 
My heartfelt best wishes to Chair-
woman LOWEY. Your leadership has 
been exceptional, as many have said— 
your friendship, even more so. We are 
going to miss you, and we are happy to 
see these tributes today. And also, to 
other 
retiring 
Members: 
Mr. 
VIS-
CLOSKY, Mr. SERRANO, Mr. GRAVES; all 
colleagues who have contributed great-
ly, and whom we will miss. 
b 1130 
This year’s T-HUD appropriations 
bill represents a renewed commitment 
to address our Nation’s housing crisis 
and to modernize our aging transpor-
tation infrastructure. Throughout the 
bill, we focus on improved safety, on 
the needs of underserved people and 
communities, and on resiliency in the 
face of a changing climate. 
Overall, the bill includes $75.9 billion 
in discretionary funding. That is an in-
crease of $1.6 billion over the Fiscal 
Year 2020 level, and it is $16.7 billion 
above the President’s budget request. 
It also includes major increases for 
highway and transit formula funding, 
consistent with Chairman DEFAZIO’s 
INVEST Act, which passed the House 
on July 1, 2020. 
On the housing side of the ledger, we 
provide increases of $100 million for the 
Community Development Block Grant 
program and $350 million for HOME, to 
help spur the creation of new afford-
able housing. 
We fully renew all Housing Choice 
Vouchers. We provide $250 million for 
new vouchers targeting homeless fami-
lies and those at risk of homelessness, 
and we increase homeless assistance 
grants by approximately 23 percent 
over last year’s level. That is the larg-
est increase in over a decade. 
Our bill includes an 11 percent in-
crease in the Public Housing Capital 
Fund and new set-asides within that 
fund to address urgent health and safe-
ty issues. We continue to provide new 
resources to create more housing for 
the elderly and disabled and for the 
Choice Neighborhoods program, for-
merly known as HOPE VI. 
The bill also does right by transpor-
tation. All modes receive robust fund-
ing, including highways, transit, rail, 
aviation, bike and pedestrian projects, 
and ports. 
This includes $1 billion for the pop-
ular BUILD program; more than $2 bil-
lion for Amtrak; a very deliberate 50 
percent increase for intercity pas-
senger and freight rail improvements 
in the CRISI program; and a funding 
boost for highways, bus fleet replace-
ment, and the Federal Transit Admin-
istration’s Capital Investment Grants, 
or ‘‘New Starts’’ transit program. 
This division of the bill also includes 
emergency funds. It provides an addi-
tional $75 billion for infrastructure in-
vestments to revitalize transportation 
networks, jump-start affordable hous-
ing production, and further reduce the 
disgraceful 
public 
housing 
capital 
backlog. 
Some may object to this use of emer-
gency spending, but to them I ask: 
What is the cost of continued inaction 
for our economy, for our communities? 
‘‘Infrastructure Week’’ shouldn’t be a 
punch line. We need to mean it. This 
funding is necessary for our future 
prosperity, especially as we transition 
from this pandemic to recovery. 
I want to underscore that the funding 
in the bill deliberately promotes equity 
and resiliency in our communities. We 
set aside funding for areas of persistent 
poverty, provide dedicated funding for 
DOT and HUD to offer technical assist-
ance, especially to rural and low-in-
come areas, and to fund programs that 
promote opportunity. 
The bill seeks to protect taxpayer 
dollars 
by 
incorporating 
resiliency 
principles into DOT and HUD pro-
grams. That means building smarter, 
requiring all-hazards mitigation, and 
the use of updated building codes. 
Importantly, the bill prevents HUD 
from implementing mean-spirited and 
harmful rules that would split up im-
migrant families in Federally assisted 
housing and allow homeless shelters to 
discriminate against LGBTQ individ-
uals. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 1 minute to the gentleman. 
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. The 
bill also provides increased funds for 
fair housing enforcement, which is all 
the more important given HUD’s open 
hostility to bedrock fair housing laws 
and the President’s racist tweet, just 
yesterday, about low-income housing 
in 
suburban 
communities. 
Pending 
amendments will go one step further in 
preventing Donald Trump from repeal-
ing our fair housing rules. 
So, Mr. Speaker, this year’s T-HUD 
bill incorporates many priorities from 
Members on both sides of the aisle, 
makes forward-looking investments in 
our housing and transportation infra-
structure, boosts safety, protects vul-
nerable population, and promotes eq-
uity and fairness. 
I want to thank our excellent profes-
sional staff: Joe Carlile, our majority 
clerk; his teammates Gladys Barcena, 
Winnie Chang, Jo Eckert, Sarah Puro, 
Angela Ohm, and Becky Salay; our mi-
nority clerk, Doug Disrud, and his col-
league, Alyssa Hinman. I want to 
thank Sean Maxwell from my personal 
staff and Chris Sweet from Mr. DIAZ- 
BALART’s personal staff. They work 
hard, and we appreciate that hard 
work. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
To respond to my friend, I have no 
problems whatsoever with emergency 
spending. That is why we passed four 
bills. We work with our friends on the 
other side of the aisle to do that. 
I think where the mistake was made 
was the HEROES Act, where you de-
cided you weren’t going to work with 
anybody on this side of the aisle. You 
just jammed it through, and it has got-
ten nowhere in the United States Sen-
ate. 
The same thing is happening here. 
This emergency spending of enormous 
proportion that has been placed in this 
bill was done without any consultation 
with Republicans in the House, let 
alone with agreements with the Senate 
and the President, who would have to 
sign off on it. I don’t think that is a 
productive way to proceed. I think ne-
gotiating together with one another, 
we show we can work together. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. 
RODGERS), a distinguished lady from 
Spokane, Washington, my good friend, 
and a distinguished member of the En-
ergy and Commerce Committee. 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in opposition to the bill. 
While it contains many partisan poison 
pills and reckless levels of spending, 
there is a glaring omission: funding for 
the long-term storage of nuclear waste. 
Safely storing our Nation’s existing 
and future nuclear waste in Yucca 
Mountain is of paramount importance. 
Eastern Washington pioneered some of 
the most important breakthroughs in 
nuclear technology of the last century 
at the Hanford Site near Tri-Cities, 
Washington. Their efforts are critical 
to continuing the development and the 
expansion of nuclear power in the next 
century. 
However, this important work came 
at a cost. Today, more than 2,000 tons 
of spent nuclear waste and millions of 
gallons of high-level waste await dis-
posal at the Hanford Site, which is why 
it is so necessary that we move forward 
with the Yucca Mountain site and 
properly dispose of the nuclear waste 
in eastern Washington and from the 
sites in 38 other States across the 
country. 
The United States has led the world 
in nuclear energy innovation, and con-
tinued advancements in this important 
technology will be essential to meet 
our clean energy needs and maintain 
our global leadership in the 21st cen-
tury. 
Failure to move forward with the 
Yucca Mountain site jeopardizes our 
ability to continue to innovate in the 
future and is unfair to the commu-
nities that have dealt with the cost of 
housing nuclear waste for the past 50 
years. 
I would like to end by thanking Con-
gressman SHIMKUS for his years of tire-
less leadership on this important issue. 
Whether 
shepherding 
legislation 
through the Energy and Commerce 
Committee and through the House, 
prodding 
the 
Appropriations 
Com-
mittee to act, or leading delegations to 
see Yucca firsthand, no one has been

more dedicated to solving the nuclear

nities. 
Let’s help him finish that fight by

lution to our country’s nuclear waste. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. QUIGLEY), the chairman of the 
Subcommittee on Financial Services 
and General Government. 
Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, first, I 
want to thank Chairwoman LOWEY for 
her service and for allowing me to 
speak today. 
I also want to thank my friend, 
Ranking Member TOM GRAVES, who I 
now have had the privilege of working 
with for a fourth year managing this 
bill. He was previously chairman. He 
was always helpful, cooperative, and 
gracious. I thank him for his partner-
ship throughout this process, and we 
will miss him next year. 
I would also like to thank the staff 
on both sides for the hard work that 
goes on behind the scenes in developing 
this legislation. From my personal of-
fice, that includes Juan and Bridget; 
and from our committee staff on the 
majority side, Laura, Marybeth, El-
liott, Aalok, Parker, and Matt; and 
from our minority staff, John Martens. 
For the committee staff particularly, I 
know it has not been easy, as you have 
been working remotely. 
The bill before us today provides 
$24.64 billion in total discretionary 
funding. This is an increase of $808 mil-
lion above 2020. 
We also include $67 billion in emer-
gency funding for broadband, Federal 
buildings, and land ports of entry 
across the Nation. 
The FSGG bill encompasses a wide 
range of programs, everything from the 
IRS to the Federal courts to the Dis-
trict of Columbia to the General Serv-
ices Administration. 
A longstanding priority of mine has 
been to help States and local govern-
ments meet the challenge of restoring 
the security and integrity of our elec-
tions. To this end, the bill includes $500 
million for election security grants to 
help 
States 
acquire 
resources 
and 
equipment to conduct safe and secure 
and on-time elections. 
This issue is especially relevant now, 
as States are currently facing the need 
to adjust their processes to accommo-
date conducting an election in the mid-
dle of a pandemic. 
Also of importance, the FSGG bill in-
cludes $12.1 billion for the IRS, an in-
crease of more than $606 million above 
fiscal year 2020. This is a good first step 
toward restoring the draconian cuts 
this agency has suffered for almost a 
decade. 
The IRS has played a critical role in 
the disbursement of stimulus checks 
during the height of the tax filing sea-
son. While its rollout has not been 
without its challenges, it has high-
lighted how important it is for the IRS 
to have proper funding. 
Notably, the bill makes significant 
investments in taxpayer services, help-
ing to provide better resources for tax-
payers, especially for low-income indi-
viduals and the elderly, and investment 
to support more efficient and effective 
enforcement activities to address all 
taxpayers, including those in the high-
er tax brackets, as well as an invest-
ment in business systems moderniza-
tion and to help improve their out-
dated IT and operating systems. 
The bill also ensures capital and 
other assistance gets to small busi-
nesses and those who are underbanked 
in low-income communities. For in-
stance, we rejected the President’s pro-
posal to essentially eliminate the Com-
munity Development Financial Insti-
tution Fund and included $273.5 million 
for CDFIs. 
The bill also provides $277 million for 
the Small Business Administration’s 
entrepreneurial development programs 
to help small businesses expand and 
grow. 
We also reject the administration’s 
efforts to sideline funds to combat the 
opioid epidemic. We include $290 mil-
lion for High Intensity Drug Traf-
ficking Areas and $102 million for the 
Drug-Free Communities program. 
The bill includes $7.8 billion in dis-
cretionary appropriations for the judi-
cial branch, an increase of $287 million, 
to fund protective services and phys-
ical security needs in courthouses and 
to ensure the continued operations of 
the Federal judiciary. 
We also increase funding for agencies 
to protect everyday consumers and re-
tail investors: the Consumer Product 
Safety Commission, the Federal Trade 
Commission, and the Securities and 
Exchange Commission. 
Finally, the bill takes steps toward 
reducing undue congressional inter-
ference in local D.C. affairs and elimi-
nates restrictions on the District that 
do not apply to other parts of the Na-
tion. Importantly, it ends the uniquely 
restrictive prohibition on the use of lo-
cally raised funds for abortions. 
In closing, I would like to reiterate 
how grateful I am to all the staff that 
helped put this product together. It is 
a bill we can all be proud of, and I urge 
my colleagues to join me in support of 
this legislation. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from South 
Carolina (Mr. DUNCAN), my very good 
friend and distinguished member and 
leader on the Energy and Commerce 
Committee. 
Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, here we 
go again, voting on an appropriations 
package without funding Yucca Moun-
tain because the Federal Government 
will not follow the law passed by Con-
gress. 
It is the law of the land to store the 
Nation’s nuclear waste in a long-term 
repository, and Yucca Mountain is the 
site that was chosen by the Federal 
Government to store that. 
Now, the government wants the 
American people to follow the man-
dates recommended by the CDC, but 
they won’t follow a duly-passed law. 
Let’s be clear: It doesn’t matter wheth-
er the Republicans or the Democrats 
control the House of Representatives 
or the White House, the law is ignored 
because of the politics of Nevada. 
The terminology the other side uses, 
‘‘The science is settled,’’ well, the 
science is settled with regard to Yucca 
Mountain. It was settled a long time 
ago. 
It is settled with reprocessing, too. 
But short of that, we need to do some-
thing with the waste that sits beside 
the pristine waters of Lake Erie, the 
Savannah River, Lake Keowee in my 
district, and waterways all across this 
great land. 
b 1145 
I have got a question for my col-
leagues, Republican and 
Democrat: 
How much have the utility rate payers 
in your State forked out for nothing? 
Nothing. 
I can tell you, in South Carolina, it is 
over $3 billion. I can tell you that na-
tionwide, it is about $40 billion. 
And, folks, we are not just talking 
about spent fuel, which sits at 121 sites 
in 39 States. There is also yucky stuff 
sitting at Savannah River site, Idaho 
Flats and Oak Ridge and Hanford, 
Washington, that has been turned to 
glass. 
Let’s put that glass and the spent 
fuel where the Nation decided by law 
that we should put that, and that is 
Yucca Mountain. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. CARTWRIGHT), the vice 
chair 
of 
the 
Commerce, 
Justice, 
Science, and Related Agencies Sub-
committee. 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in strong support of this combina-
tion of appropriations bills, this mini-
bus. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a 
few minutes to discuss this CJS compo-
nent of the bill. 
First, I would like to thank, again, 
our overall chairwoman of appropria-
tions for her amazing dignified service 
in the Congress and to the Appropria-
tions Committee. 
I also want to express my apprecia-
tion to Chairman JOSE´ SERRANO, whose 
leadership of CJS has been unmatched. 
Thank you to the staff, Bob Bonner, 
Jeff Ashford, T.J. Lowdermilk, Shan-
non McCully, B.G. Wright, Faye Cobb, 
Trisha Castaneda, and also acknowl-
edge the good faith and the assistance 
of Ranking Member ADERHOLT and the 
minority staff as well. 
The fiscal year 2021 Commerce-Jus-
tice-Science 
appropriations 
bill 
in-
cludes a total of $71.473 billion in dis-
cretionary budget authority, which is 
actually a $1.7 billion decrease below 
last year’s level. This reflects the nat-
ural decline in the funding requirement 
due to the decreased needs associated 
with the completion of the 2020 Census. 
But even at this overall funding 
level, the CJS bill sustains strong in-
creases to invest in jobs and economic

development, reduce gun violence, ad-
dress climate change, sustain scientific 
leadership in the world, and implement 
police accountability and police re-
form. 
On this last score, this bill takes im-
mediate steps to start the process of 
police reform and accountability and 
to better protect civil rights. To do 
that, the bill increases funding for the 
Civil Rights Division of the Justice De-
partment, as well as for the U.S. Attor-
ney and the FBI to conduct pattern and 
practice reviews of law enforcement 
agencies. We include language to roll 
back Justice Department policies that 
have hindered this oversight. 
The bill provides funding for a na-
tional task force on law enforcement 
oversight and national police mis-
conduct database. 
In addition, the bill funds nearly $500 
million in new grant programs author-
ized in the George Floyd Justice in Po-
licing Act. These grants will help im-
prove law enforcement practices and 
accountability by funding State-level 
pattern and practice reviews and inde-
pendent reviews of law enforcement, as 
well as funding better training for po-
lice community, organization efforts, 
and more. 
Finally, we include sensible require-
ments for COPS and Byrne JAG grants 
to implement numerous reform efforts 
at the local level. These changes show 
that the Federal Government is deeply 
serious about ensuring police account-
ability and protecting American civil 
rights. 
The bill does these things without 
neglecting important priorities else-
where. We reject the administration’s 
proposed cuts to climate change re-
search programs at NASA and NOAA 
and, instead, provide responsible fund-
ing increases to that. 
We promote jobs and better wages by 
supporting significant investments at 
the Economic Development Adminis-
tration, through the Manufacturing 
Extension Partnership program and 
the Minority Business Development 
Agency. 
We help policing against gun violence 
by increasing ATF’s budget by $150 
million, by sustaining funding for the 
NICS program and grants, and by in-
creasing funding for the STOP School 
Violence Act. 
We promote criminal justice reform 
with large increases for both the First 
Step Act and the Second Chance Act, 
and we increase funding to address the 
ongoing opioid epidemic. 
This bill also ensures that our Na-
tion’s scientific leadership in the world 
can continue by increasing funding by 
$270 million for the National Science 
Foundation, by $35 million for the core 
NIST activities, and by over $101 mil-
lion for NOAA. 
We also include significant funding 
for the educational components of 
NASA, National Science Foundation, 
and NOAA to ensure that we are train-
ing the next generation of scientists in 
America to continue this important 
work. 
Mr. Speaker, for all these reasons, 
and more, I urge the adoption of this 
minibus. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I would in-
quire from my friend, is she prepared 
to close? 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, yes, I am. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to begin where 
every other speaker has started, and 
that is to thank our distinguished 
chairman for her 30 years of unparal-
leled service to the Congress and to the 
country and, of course, her many years 
on Appropriations. 
I have had the good fortune since I 
arrived on that committee to serve 
with my friend and watch her steady 
rise to the chairmanship. And I think 
my friend, Mr. DIAZ-BALART, summed 
it up, if you want to be short: What a 
class act. 
What an extraordinary appropriator. 
We all, on both sides of the aisle, re-
spect her professionalism and her deep 
knowledge of the appropriations proc-
ess. But I think even more than that, 
we just appreciate her personal quali-
ties as a friend, as a mentor, as a col-
league, and as someone who is an out-
standing credit to her district, to her 
State, and to the Congress of the 
United States. Mr. Speaker, we will all 
miss her on both sides of the aisle. 
Having said that, I am going to be 
less charitable toward the bill itself. 
As I mentioned several times, I love 
the Appropriations Committee because 
I think it is a naturally collaborative 
committee, and when it is left to do its 
work, it does a really good job. 
Last year, we had a negotiated set-
tlement between the President and the 
congressional leadership on both sides 
of the aisle in both Chambers in the 
2019 Budget Act, and that led to a very 
orderly appropriations process under 
the leadership of my friend, the chair-
man. 
We got all those bills done. We didn’t 
have a long-term CR, and we have not 
been at risk, in this fiscal year, of a 
government shutdown. And that is 
something you can’t always say around 
here. 
My friend had a great deal to do with 
that, along with our ranking member, 
Ms. GRANGER, that legendary partner-
ship between the two. If you let them 
do their work, they will get the job 
done. 
What is in front of us now, though, is 
not what we saw last year. My friends, 
for whatever reason, decided they 
would ignore the 2019 Budget Act, 
which has the force of law, and embark 
on an unprecedented amount of emer-
gency spending, almost a quarter of a 
trillion dollars. And, again, none of 
that was agreed to last year. 
In addition, last year, the agreement 
was we would not put extraneous mat-
ters in the bill. We would not put legis-
lative riders, as they are known. We 
didn’t do it last year, and we moved 
through. This year, these bills are ab-
solutely full of them. And the con-
sequence, while these bills may pass 
this floor, they are certainly not going 
to be taken up as is by the United 
States Senate, nor would they ever be 
signed by the President. 
I think we have another model. We 
have the model of last year. We also 
have the model of the first four 
supplementals this year, Mr. Speaker. 
The four supplementals dealing with 
coronavirus were brought to the floor 
after collaborative discussion and ne-
gotiation and passed here with almost 
universal bipartisan support on each 
occasion. 
For whatever reason, rather than 
continuing that productive dialogue, 
our friend decided they would bring the 
HEROES Act. That is certainly their 
right to do that. But, again, if you are 
not 
involving 
Republicans 
in 
this 
Chamber in that discussion, then I can 
assure you you are not going to be in 
very good shape when you go to a 
Chamber where Republicans are actu-
ally the majority. Nor will you get the 
support of the President. And we are 
seeing how that is working out right 
now with respect to the next supple-
mental. The same thing could happen 
here. 
Mr. Speaker, I don’t worry about 
that in the short term because, again, 
there are times in this process where it 
is partisan, and when we get to con-
ference, quite often, it becomes bipar-
tisan. But I do worry these departures 
are so large that we could find our-
selves in September kicking into a CR 
and then, frankly, then we could do an-
other one well into next year. That 
would be a mistake. That would be a 
mistake, in my opinion. 
The day-to-day funding of govern-
ment ought to go on regardless of the 
politics of the moment. The emer-
gencies need to be dealt with. And I 
think we have shown we can work to-
gether on emergency supplementals. 
We did them so quickly and so easily in 
an unprecedented way just in the 
spring of this year. So I would think we 
could return to that. 
And if we do return to that, I suspect 
our friends and I on our side can come 
to common ground and we can bring 
bills to the floor that command sub-
stantial bipartisan majorities, just as 
my friend, the chairwoman, did last 
year when she brought appropriations 
bill after bill after bill to the floor, and 
they were passed with substantial bi-
partisan majorities because she en-
gaged, as is always her habit, in col-
laborative negotiation with friends on 
all sides of the Chamber. 
So with that, Mr. Speaker, I reluc-
tantly urge the rejection of this par-
ticular minibus of six appropriations 
bills. I hope that my friends, as we go 
forward, will return to their habits in 
terms of the appropriations of last year 
and return to the style of negotiation 
that they exhibited all through the 
spring in dealing with this awful 
coronavirus crisis that has caused such 
turmoil and damage in our country. 
In closing, the last thing I would say 
is, again, it is a privilege for me to

share the floor with my friend, the 
chairman. Normally, my ranking mem-
ber would be here, but Ms. GRANGER, of 
course, is in self-quarantine because of 
coronavirus; otherwise, I know she 
would prefer to be here. But her misfor-
tune at least gave me the opportunity 
to share the floor with my very good 
friend, our distinguished chairman. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge the rejection of 
the legislation, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I do want to say to my 
dear friend, Mr. COLE, that I will truly 
miss you. We have worked together on 
so many issues, and not only are you 
thoughtful, intelligent, and enthusi-
astic, but you are a real partner. 
And I am not sure what the future 
brings for any of us, but let’s hope that 
this coronavirus disappears somehow 
soon. I hope my friend, Ms. GRANGER, 
does not, frankly, suffer from it, and I 
am glad that she is going through a pe-
riod of isolation. Let’s hope there is 
some good news. But, for me, it has 
really been a pleasure not only to work 
with you, but to be your friend. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman 
for his very, very kind remarks. 
Mr. Speaker, I am very proud of the 
work we have completed under incred-
ibly difficult circumstances, and I 
would like to thank our wonderful sub-
committee chairs, particularly PETE 
VISCLOSKY and JOSE´ SERRANO, who are 
also retiring. I thank them both for 
their outstanding service. 
This is an excellent package of ap-
propriation bills that lives up to the 
principle that has guided our work to-
gether: Do the best we can to make life 
better for the most people we can. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the 
bill, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, before I 
begin with my remarks on the fiscal year (FY) 
2021 bill, I would like to briefly discuss some 
concerns I have as a longtime member of the 
House Appropriations Committee. 
The Committee has a unique responsibility. 
It is charged with funding and oversight of the 
entire government, and ensuring that it is as 
effective and as efficient as possible. How-
ever, in some ways, the Committee is at its 
nadir in terms of its ability to achieve bipar-
tisan solutions. In part, this is due to the Budg-
et Control Act of 2011, which is an ill-fated at-
tempt to balance the federal budget by cutting 
only discretionary spending. 
Currently, mandatory spending and interest 
on the debt represent 70 percent of the money 
spent each year by the federal government. 
Discretionary spending, which is an invest-
ment in the future, makes up just 30 percent 
of federal spending. When less than 30 per-
cent of young Americans are qualified to join 
the military, it is clear we need to invest more 
in our nation’s health, education, infrastruc-
ture, and jobs. Unfortunately, from my per-
spective, recent Congresses have mistakenly 
relied on mandatory spending to avoid making 
difficult decisions on discretionary spending on 
an annual basis. A case in point, last week the 
House passed a bill that will provide much 
needed funding to address the maintenance 
backlog in our public lands. But the bill utilizes 
mandatory funding mechanisms that further 
decrease the ability of Congress and the Ap-
propriations Committee to exercise annual dis-
cretion and oversight. 
I implore my colleagues who serve in the 
next Congress to avoid repeating the mistakes 
of the recent past. The lasting solution to our 
nation’s fiscal problems will only be realized 
by confronting the continued growth in manda-
tory spending while simultaneously increasing 
revenues. In the year 2000, the last year the 
federal government had a surplus, revenues, 
as a percentage of GDP, were 20 percent. In 
fiscal year 2019, revenues were 16.3 percent. 
We need revenue to invest in the future of our 
country, and every appropriated dollar is an in-
vestment. 
Moving onto the FY 2021 bill, I first want to 
thank my Ranking Member and friend, Mr. 
CALVERT, for his continued commitment to 
being collegial, transparent, and bipartisan. I 
cannot overstate the value of his friendship 
and the partnership we have enjoyed over the 
years. 
I also want to express my sincere gratitude 
to Chairwoman LOWEY and Ranking Member 
GRANGER. We would not be here without their 
leadership and dedication. 
Further, I would like to acknowledge that 
Chairwoman LOWEY will be joining me in de-
parting the House at the end of this year. I 
commend her for a dedicated life of service 
and commitment to leaving this world a little 
bit better than the way she found it. I thank 
her very much. It is a joy to work with her. 
I want to thank the Subcommittee staff, par-
ticularly, our clerks, Becky Leggieri and 
Johnnie Kaberle, as well as Walter Hearne, 
Brooke Barnard, Ariana Sarar, Jackie Ripke, 
David Bortnick, Matt Bower, Bill Adkins, Jen-
nifer Chartrand, Hayden Milberg, Paul Kilbride, 
Shannon Richter, Sherry Young, Kyle McFar-
land, Kiya Batmanglidj, Jamie McCormick, 
Brian Potts, and Nick Vance, my personal of-
fice staff, Joe DeVooght and Stephen Cash, 
and those in Ranking Member CALVERT’s per-
sonal office, Rebecca Keightley and William 
Hendrickson. Having to assemble the bulk of 
the bill and report remotely increased the de-
gree of difficulty substantially, as it has for all 
of the subcommittees. I commend them for 
their professionalism and acumen. 
The bill would provide $694.6 billion for the 
Department of Defense budget, which is $1.3 
billion above the fiscal year 2020 enacted 
level and $3.7 billion below the request. The 
base funding recommendation is $626.2 bil-
lion, which is $3.5 billion above the fiscal year 
2020 enacted level and $3.5 billion below the 
request. The overseas contingency operations 
recommendation is $68.4 billion, which is $2.2 
billion below the fiscal year 2020 enacted level 
and $215 million below the request. 
This legislation recognizes the complex 
challenges the members of our Armed Forces 
and intelligence community face every day 
throughout the world, and it aims to ensure 
that they are able to continue to meet these 
challenges and complete their missions to the 
best of their abilities. To support this forward- 
looking posture, the bill makes major invest-
ments in operations and maintenance, pro-
curement, and research and development. 
I also think it is important to highlight some 
investments the Committee has made with re-
gards to the current COVID–19 pandemic. 
This legislation would provide: 
$758 million in procurement for COVID–19 
recovery for second, third and fourth tier sup-
pliers. This has been of particular interest to 
Mr. CALVERT, and I appreciate his advocacy of 
this issue; 
$450 million in operation and maintenance 
for COVID–19 recovery and resupply; and 
$150 million in the Defense Health Program 
for COVID–19 response. 
In addition to the funding enumerated 
above, the legislation places several reporting 
requirements on the Department specific to 
COVID–19. The budgetary impacts of the pan-
demic on the Department are still largely un-
determined. Some programs will cost more. 
However, there will be savings obtained 
through delayed or cancelled events and ac-
tivities. It is imperative that the Committee and 
Congress have as much detail as possible to 
properly delegate funding and to conduct over-
sight. 
And most importantly, the bill continues to 
focus on the well-being and morale of those in 
uniform and their families, as well as DoD ci-
vilians and their communities. 
The bill provides an additional $116 million 
for upgrades to childcare facilities and the re-
port contains language directing the military 
services to present innovative ideas to ad-
dress the serious backlog for childcare. 
The bill provides $1.49 billion for environ-
mental restoration activities, which is $415 mil-
lion above the request. This increased funding 
will help DoD address the significant and sa-
lient public health risks associated with PFOS/ 
PFOA. 
The bill and report take steps to stop the 
Department from closing military treatment fa-
cilities and from reducing military healthcare 
billets, which would have cost $334.6 million 
this fiscal year. These plans were poorly justi-
fied to the Committee prior to the pandemic, 
and even harder to defend under current con-
ditions. 
The bill provides $327 million to address the 
ongoing epidemic of sexual assault in the mili-
tary and at the service academies, which is 
$49 million more than requested. And I must 
express my personal upset over this issue. 
The most recent report on the sexual assault 
rate for women has jumped a shocking 50 
percent from 2016 to 2018. Despite dire warn-
ings, the Department’s budget for sexual as-
sault prevention and response remains stag-
nant. And I would also say it is not just a 
question of money. Year after year after year, 
we have testimony from officials who contend 
that they are really committed to solving this 
problem. And yet we are going backwards. 
The Department must do a much better job. 
These efforts and several others within the 
bill will have an immediate positive impact on 
people’s quality of life. 
Another area of concern for me is the De-
partment’s lack of compliance with many Con-
gressionally directed reporting requirements. 
For example, last year the Committee directed 
the Department to submit a report on its con-
tracts for advertising services with socially and 
economically disadvantaged small businesses. 
The report was supposed to accompany the 
Department’s FY 2021 budget submission in 
February, but it was transmitted to the Com-
mittee on July 14, five months late and the 
same day we marked up the bill. Regrettably, 
reporting deadlines are often missed, making 
it much more difficult for the Committee to 
make timely decisions.

The bill, again, contains several provisions 
to rein in the Department’s habitual redirection 
of funding and contravention of congressional 
intent. These actions have irreparably dam-
aged the Department’s credibility with the 
Committee. One DoD official, in a meeting, re-
ferred to these transfers of billions of dollars 
as anomalies. I refer to them as habitual 
abuses by the Department. 
In recent years, the Department leadership 
has not missed an opportunity to claim that a 
3 percent to 5 percent annual growth rate in 
the defense budget is necessary to support 
the National Defense Strategy. But at the 
same time, those same leaders facilitated the 
transfer of nearly $10 billion to non-defense 
activities not enumerated in their own National 
Defense Strategy. And while this was hap-
pening, they also have the temerity to repeat-
edly request more flexibility from Congress for 
executing their budget and for reprogramming 
authorities. The sense of entitlement in these 
actions is galling, and I hope that at some 
point the Department will have the leadership 
in place to recognize Congress’s constitutional 
prerogative and restore trust to the appropria-
tions process. 
In closing, I would again thank my chair, 
ranking member, and all of the members, who 
have logged so many hours in making this bill 
possible. I look forward to debate on the 
amendments. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, as the Re-
publican leader of the Appropriations Com-
mittee, I oppose H.R. 7617, the second pack-
age of fiscal year 2021 appropriations bills to 
be considered by the House. 
My concerns today will sound very familiar. 
I had many of the same objections when I 
spoke on the House floor last week about the 
first package of appropriations bills. 
I regret that I again oppose a very important 
piece of legislation. 
This bill supports: 
The servicemembers who risk it all for our 
freedoms; 
The law enforcement officers that keep us 
safe; 
The small business owners who want to 
achieve the American dream; 
The researchers seeking groundbreaking 
cures for diseases; 
The ports and waterways that are so critical 
for commerce; and 
Our transit systems that millions of Ameri-
cans rely on every day. 
Unfortunately, like the bill we considered 
last week, H.R. 7617 has some fatal flaws that 
make it unacceptable. 
First, many of the policy provisions are simi-
lar to the partisan legislation the majority has 
pushed through the house the last few 
months; and second, the spending levels ex-
ceed the amounts the Congress and the 
President agreed to just last year. 
Instead of policy and funding proposals 
being developed from the bottom up within the 
Appropriations Committee, many of these de-
cisions appear to have been dictated from the 
top down. 
This is disappointing because the committee 
has held more than 100 hearings and briefings 
in the last six months—even in the middle of 
a global pandemic. 
For example, the bill jeopardizes our safety 
and security by: 
Repealing both the 2001 and 2002 author-
izations for the use of military force, which 
would limit our ability to conduct counterter-
rorism operations worldwide; 
Allowing terrorists detained at Guantanamo 
Bay to be brought to U.S. soil; and 
Preventing the United States from exer-
cising the right to defend ourselves and our al-
lies, such as Israel. 
Our path toward renewed American promi-
nence in space is undermined, giving China 
the opportunity to dominate the next frontier. 
The bill gives in to the voices calling for de- 
funding the police by failing to provide ade-
quate funding for our federal law enforcement 
agencies. 
In addition, state and local law enforcement 
agencies are prohibited from receiving excess 
equipment from the Department of Defense. 
Officers should have what they need to pro-
tect and serve our communities. Provisions in 
this bill will halt critical funds used for training 
and equipment, including active shooter train-
ing, body cameras, and bullet-proof vests. 
The bill also: 
Blocks the administration’s rule protecting 
health care providers from performing actions 
that violate their religious beliefs; 
Forces faith-based providers to discuss 
abortion, even if they have a personal objec-
tion; and 
Perhaps worst of all, makes changes to 
family planning grants which will require funds 
to go to Planned Parenthood clinics. 
I am also disappointed to see that several 
long-standing, bipartisan second amendment 
protections were eliminated. 
The bill also contains billions of dollars in 
emergency spending on top of the caps that 
were agreed to last year. 
$186 billion is included in this bill for infra-
structure without any bipartisan discussions or 
agreement. 
Another $24 billion is included to address 
coronavirus, even though a three trillion-dollar 
bill passed the House in May and the Senate 
is moving quickly on its response. 
We must work together on appropriations 
bills that avoid controversial legislative lan-
guage and meet agreed-upon spending levels. 
This is the only way to get bills through the 
House and the Senate and signed into law. 
For these reasons, I oppose this package. 
Mr. RUPPERSBERGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to note provisions in H.R. 7617 which 
provide $5 million for the Maglev Deployment 
Program, also known as MDP, and an addi-
tional $100 million in Title V of the bill. 
The MDP was created in 1998 as a com-
petitive program to encourage the develop-
ment and construction of an operating maglev 
transportation system capable of safe use by 
the public at speeds in excess of 240 miles 
per hour. The program was not intended for 
the United States to deploy a new transpor-
tation system somewhere in America and not 
for research. America has fallen behind as 
countries like China and Japan have deployed 
magnetic levitation transportation systems. 
Congress directed the Federal Railroad Ad-
ministration (FRA) to establish project selec-
tion criteria, to solicit applications for funding, 
to select one or more projects to receive finan-
cial assistance for preconstruction planning 
activities, and after completion of such activi-
ties, to select one of the projects to receive fi-
nancial assistance for final design, engineering 
and construction. Funds were only available to 
States or an Authority designated by one or 
more States and included required State 
matching funds. 
The FRA received eleven applications for 
MDP funding and selected seven projects for 
Initial Feasibility Studies. The FRA then com-
pleted a Programmatic Environmental Impact 
Statement and Record of Decision for the 
MDP. 
As a result of the prior rounds, the FRA fur-
ther selected two projects to continue: Balti-
more-Washington 
and 
Pittsburgh. 
Other 
projects in the Program, such as Atlanta-Chat-
tanooga, could continue but without federal 
support. 
In 2008, Congress passed SAFETEA-LU 
providing an additional $90 million in Highway 
Trust Fund contract authority for the MDP. In 
clarifying eligible projects for the MDP Con-
gress explained that for projects east of the 
Mississippi River ‘‘the intent is to limit the eligi-
ble projects to three existing projects east of 
the Mississippi River: Pittsburgh, Baltimore- 
Washington and Atlanta-Chattanooga.’’ 
Subsequently, the Pittsburgh project was 
discontinued, leaving the Atlanta-Chattanooga 
and the Baltimore-Washington projects as the 
two remaining in the competition. In 2019, the 
Georgia DOT determined to not pursue At-
lanta-Chattanooga any further. 
As a result, after 20 years of work, more 
than $100 million of private sector investment, 
millions of dollars in state and federal invest-
ment, the most advanced and sophisticated of 
the projects has emerged as the winner. All of 
the participants have expended time and 
funds in reliance on the fact that the long-
standing competitive process would ultimately 
end in the selection and, hopefully, construc-
tion sofa single project. 
It is critical that the federal commitment con-
tinue. I applaud the Committee and Congress 
for its continued federal commitment to the 
MDP. After so many years of monetary and 
time investment, by many participants, the 
good faith effort by the State of Maryland and 
the Maryland private sector should result in 
the purpose the competitive program was de-
signed to achieve. Congressional intent has 
never changed. Indeed, the Baltimore-Wash-
ington Project has attracted potentially billions 
of dollars in nonfederal investment. 
I rise to make it abundantly clear, as Con-
gress did in 2008, that funds in the MDP are 
available only to current participants in the 
program, and it is not the intent of this Con-
gress to restart a 20 year competition to new 
entrants, after so much work, reliance on the 
process and expenditure. It is clear to this 
Member that FRA discretion to award funds is 
limited to those existing projects in the Maglev 
Deployment Program. 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in support of the need for a backup system to 
GPS, which is critical to our economy, our na-
tional security and is integrated into nearly 
every aspect of all Americans lives. We great-
ly appreciate the foresight of the Appropria-
tions Committee for providing $5,000,000 in 
funding to begin the implementation of the Na-
tional Timing Resilience and Security Act 
under the Office of the Assistant Secretary for 
Research and Technology at the Department 
of Transportation. 
The need for a backup system to GPS has 
been recognized by this government for over 
15 years and a terrestrial based system has 
been recommended nearly 18 times by dif-
ferent US government agencies and bodies in 
the last decade alone. Because of this is, in

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4124 
July 30, 2020 
2018 Congress acted in a fully bipartisan man-
ner to finally protect GPS by passing the Na-
tional Timing Resilience and Security Act of 
2018. Unanimously approved in the House, 
and by 96 to 4 in the Senate, it was signed 
into law on December 4, 2018. This law calls 
for, at a minimum, the deployment of a terres-
trial based backup system for GPS with the 
Department of Transportation as the lead for 
execution. This Jaw ensures the implementa-
tion of a nationwide, fully complementary, and 
resilient backup timing system within two 
years, and thereafter with the expansion to po-
sition and navigation. 
As strong of an advocate for GPS as I know 
we all are, we must now also be stronger ad-
vocates for protecting it. And that comes 
through this funding for the deployment of the 
National Timing Resilience and Security Act 
under the Office of the Assistant Secretary for 
Research and Technology at the Department 
of Transportation.

Mr. MCNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, my 
amendment would increase and de-

used to assess whether district maps 
have been drawn in an overly partisan 
manner. These rulings which have con-
tinually found congressional and State 
legislative districts in States across 
the country to be too partisan high-
light the need for an impartial, unbi-
ased system of creating and assessing 
district maps. My amendment would 
fund a study to define best practices 
for creating fair congressional districts 
and be in compliance with the Voting 
Rights Act of 1965. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of 
this amendment. 
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume, 
and I rise in opposition to the Demo-
cratic en bloc amendment. 
Mr. Speaker, while there may cer-
tainly be valid adjustments reflecting 
important priorities, there are also po-
litical statements that have no place in 
the Defense appropriations bill, such as 
language insinuating that our military 
is being used in a way that violates the 
First Amendment. 
Make no mistake, the men and 
women of the United States military 
protect and defend the First Amend-
ment along with the entire Constitu-
tion to which they swore an oath. It is 
beneath the institution to call their 
loyalty into question. As such, I urge 
rejection of this en bloc. 
Mr. Speaker, if the gentlewoman has 
no further speakers, I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. MENG. Mr. Speaker, on July 21, 2020, 
President Trump issued a Presidential Memo-
randum to exclude undocumented immigrants 
from being counted in reapportionment for 
Congress. 
The Constitution explicitly requires an ‘‘ac-
tual Enumeration’’ of all ‘‘persons,’’ imposing 
on the federal government the duty to count 
the ‘‘whole number of persons in each State.’’ 
In other words, each person—regardless of 
citizenship status—must be counted. President 
Trump’s plan to prohibit undocumented immi-
grants from being counted in the apportion-
ment of Congressional seats, violates the plain 
text of both the Constitution and the governing 
statutes. 
I submitted an amendment to H.R. 7617 to 
block this effort by prohibiting the use of any 
and all federal funds to implement, administer, 
or enforce this Presidential Memorandum. Al-
though this memorandum is unconstitutional, 
my amendment would end any confusion 
caused by the President, and avoid costly liti-
gation. 
Mr. Speaker, immigrants have always been 
America’s strength, and during the COVID–19 
pandemic, we’ve seen how so many immi-
grants have put themselves on the front lines 
to help combat the coronavirus. They have 
made enormous sacrifices, working tirelessly 
to provide the critical services we need and 
depend on. Immigrants are part of the fabric of 
our nation, and we shall not allow them to be 
kicked to the curb by this President. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of my amendment to promote access to 
justice policies within the Department of Jus-
tice. 
As a former pro bona counsel, I know how 
important legal representation is for the most 
vulnerable members of society. My amend-
ment, which would reduce and increase funds 
in this division by the same amount, aims to 
bring attention to the fact that the Department 
of Justice should spend appropriated funds to 
improve access to justice in the criminal and 
civil systems for all Americans. Carrying out 
this goal requires coordination throughout the 
Department in its litigation, policy activity, and 
grant making. This task was historically ac-
complished by the Department’s Office of Ac-
cess to Justice, an office that was eliminated 
by the Trump administration and I hope is re- 
established soon. 
In the meantime, the Department should re-
invigorate its statement of interest and amicus 
brief practice reflecting focusing on the Sixth 
Amendment right to counsel to ensure it is 
guaranteed at the state and local level in the 
criminal context. 
In the civil context, the Department should 
accelerate its work to raise federal agencies’ 
awareness of how civil legal aid helps ad-
vance a wide range of federal objectives in-
cluding improved access to health care and 
housing, education and employment, family 
stability and public safety. Specifically, the De-
partment should continue its leadership of the 
White House Legal Aid Interagency Round-
table an interagency effort that I am so 
pleased to learn this Administration has em-
braced. 
A report from the Philadelphia Bar Associa-
tion showed that the estimated return on in-
vestment for providing counsel to low income 
tenants in the city was about $12.47. That 
means for every dollar that the City of Phila-
delphia spent on providing legal representation 
to these individuals, it received $12.47 in re-
turn. Ensuring access to justice is not only the 
morally just thing to do, it is also a financially 
sound decision. Responding to the legal 
needs of victims of crime, people seeking em-
ployment, and servicemembers are bipartisan 
concerns that my amendment directly sup-
ports. My amendment would help continue 
these bipartisan practices and promote the 
Department of Justice’s mission of ensuring 
justice for all. 
Mr. HORSFORD. Mr. Speaker, on July 11, 
2019, President Trump issued Executive 
Order 13880 after the U.S. Supreme Court’s 
decision denying the citizenship question on 
the Census. 
The Executive Order would have directed all 
government departments, including the De-
partment of Homeland Security (DHS) to 
share any information regarding citizenship 
that they have with the Department of Com-
merce, which operates the Census Bureau. 
It was clear that this order was another at-
tempt to deny the rights and privacy of un-
documented immigrants, but we could not let 
the Administration deter anyone from partici-
pating in the decennial census. The census is 
critical for vital programs to receive federal 
funding, but more importantly census data is 
critical for proper political representation of our 
local community. 
That is why I introduced my bill, H.R. 7291, 
that would nullify the effect of Trump’s Execu-
tive Order that requires Federal agencies to 
share citizenship data. The executive order di-
recting federal agencies to compile citizenship 
data through administrative records and merge 
it with decennial census data is a blatant effort 
to collect this information for political and dis-
criminatory purposes. 
Recently, on July 21, 2020, President 
Trump issued a Presidential Memorandum to 
exclude undocumented immigrants from being 
counted in reapportionment for Congress. 
The Constitution explicitly requires an ‘‘ac-
tual Enumeration’’ of all persons, imposing on 
the federal government the duty to count the 
‘‘whole number of persons in each State.’’ In 
other words, each person—regardless of citi-
zenship status—must be counted. President 
Trump’s plan to prohibit undocumented immi-
grants from being counted in the reapportion-
ment of Congressional seats, violates the plain 
text of both the Constitution and the governing 
statutes. 
I submitted Horsford Amendment 23 to Divi-
sion B of H.R. 7617 to block this effort by nul-
lifying the effect that of the Presidential Execu-
tive Order that requires Federal Agencies to 
share citizenship data. Although the Presi-
dent’s memorandum and executive order are 
unconstitutional, my amendment would send 
an important message to the President and 
his administration that he cannot disenfran-
chise whole communities in our Nation. This 
plan violates our Constitution and governing 
statute. By moving forward with my amend-
ment, Congress is making it abundantly clear 
that the President lacks the authority to ex-
clude undocumented immigrants from being 
counted in reapportionment for Congress. 
Congress compels possesses the Constitu-
tional authority to prevent the President from 
excluding undocumented immigrants from the 
apportionment count, and the determination by 
this body to move forward with my provision 
will deter the President from wasting valuable 
public time and resources on an unconstitu-
tional action. 
The contributions of immigrants are of vital 
importance to our society and economy, par-
ticularly as immigrant communities play a sig-
nificant role as frontline workers during the 
COVID–19 pandemic. For example, the Amer-
ican health care system relies very heavily on 
individuals who were born in other countries, 
who make up about 18 percent of all health 
care workers in the country despite making up 
15.5 percent of the population. Further, immi-
grants account for a third of direct care work-
ers, and legal noncitizen immigrants make up 
9 percent of direct care workers despite ac-
counting for only 5 percent of the population. 
In addition to caring for us when we are 
sick, immigrants feed us by forming the back-
bone of our food system. An estimated 70 to 
80 percent of farmworkers are immigrants, be-
tween half and three quarters of whom are un-
documented. Finally, both documented and 
undocumented immigrants pay billions of dol-
lars in taxes to federal, state and local govern-
ments every year. In 2017 alone, this ac-
counted for $405.4 billion in taxes, including 
an estimated $27.2 billion paid by undocu-
mented immigrants. 
Immigrants deserve not only to be recog-
nized for these contributions, but to be re-
spected as human beings taking part in one of 
the most integral traditions to the American 
way. For these reasons, we must ensure that 
the President does not exclude Immigrants, 
who make up the fabric of our nation.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1067, the gen-
tlewoman from New York (Mrs. LOWEY) 
and the gentleman from California (Mr. 
CALVERT) each will control 15 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Ten-
nessee (Mr. COOPER). 
Mr. COOPER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding. 
I rise today to offer an amendment to 
provide $3 million for the Office of the 
Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisi-
tion and Sustainment in order to con-
tinue the JASON scientific advisory 
group’s major contributions to inform-
ing national security decisions. 
This funding will be the 61st year of 
JASON’s activity. This funding is con-
sistent with congressional intent and 
direction in the fiscal year 2020 appro-
priations bill to establish the JASON 
within the office of the Department of 
Defense. 
My amendment simply aligns funding 
for JASON and fiscal year 2021, fol-
lowing efforts by the former Under Sec-
retary of Defense for Research and En-
gineering, Dr. Michael Griffin’s at-
tempt last year to abruptly cancel the 
longstanding JASON group contract. 
While the Defense Authorization Act 
for fiscal year 2020 moved the JASON 
contract to the Office of the Under Sec-
retary 
for 
Acquisition 
and 
Sustainment, the funding, unfortu-
nately, did not follow. 
So I am deeply grateful, Madam 
Chair 
of 
the 
Appropriations 
Com-
mittee, for allowing this very impor-
tant amendment to be included in the 
package. 
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise in support of a bipartisan en 
bloc, which includes important changes 
to the bills that reflect Member prior-
ities. I would also like to thank the full 
committee chairwoman and Chairman 
VISCLOSKY
for their willingness to 
work with Members on both sides of 
the aisle to accommodate as many 
amendments to the defense division as 
possible. 
It is vital to our work that we have 
input from members who know their 
districts best and who want to ensure 
their constituent interests are being 
reflected in the appropriations process. 
The defense portion of the bipartisan 
en bloc includes 55 amendments, and I 
thank the many Members who are in-
cluded in this en bloc for input and in-
sight. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. ADAMS). 
Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding time to 
me. 
I rise in support of, specifically, my 
amendment to prohibit the use of Fed-
eral funds for the acquisition of chem-
ical agents, such as teargas and pepper 
balls. 
Since the tragic death of George 
Floyd, millions of Americans have 
sought to exercise their first amend-
ment right to protest and to assemble. 
Too often these actions have been met 
by the brutal force of the State as the 
elderly, as children, as those with med-
ical conditions choke and asphyxiate 
due to the use of so-called riot control 
agents. 
Mr. Speaker, we can no longer con-
done the use of agents that hundreds of 
public health professionals say can 
help spread respiratory illnesses, such 
as COVID–19. 
The use of such agents is banned by 
international law, so why would we use 
them against our own people? This is 
absolutely unacceptable. 
And so with my amendment, it is my 
hope today that we are nearing the 
dawn of a fairer, more equitable and 
more just era of policing in this coun-
try. 
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Ala-
bama (Mr. ADERHOLT), the ranking 
member on the Commerce, Justice, 
Science Subcommittee. 
Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in support of this bipartisan en bloc 
amendment. This amendment includes 
various provisions that make improve-
ments to division B of this bill. 
Among other things, it increases 
funding to study the root cause of 
school violence. 
It also provides additional support 
for child advocacy centers, which will 
work to hold child abusers accountable

and help children heal through this 
process. 
This amendment also highlights the 
work of the International Trade Ad-
ministration and its important role in 
the enforcement of the antidumping 
and countervailing duty laws. I agree 
with the amendment’s sponsors that it 
is critical that the ITA allocates suffi-
cient resources to protect American 
jobs from illegal foreign trade prac-
tices. 
Finally, the amendment also includes 
a strong bipartisan provision advanc-
ing university research on artificial in-
telligence. 
Mr. Speaker, in closing this is a good 
amendment, and I would recommend a 
‘‘yes’’ vote. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. ROSE). 
Mr. ROSE of New York. Mr. Speaker, 
I will begin by thanking the gentle-
woman. I am a fourth generation New 
Yorker. I am a Jew. I am a vet. And 
you are a hero. It has been such an in-
credible honor to serve with you. 
Thank you for so much. 
I also thank Congressman RUIZ for 
partnering on this effort I would like 
to speak on today. 
I rise today in support of our amend-
ment to increase appropriations for 
Law Enforcement Mental Health and 
Wellness Act grants, because when it 
comes to our law enforcement, the last 
thing that we should ever do is pinch 
pennies. 
There are few in this Chamber, heck, 
a few in this country, who know what 
it means to put your life on the line 
every single day for years in the serv-
ice of others. Well, that is what the 
NYPD does every single day, and they 
do not get the appreciation that they 
deserve. That is as true today as it ever 
has been. 
b 1215 
What law enforcement across the 
country deserves is our support, not 
just with our words, but with our budg-
etary decisions, because while our Na-
tion confronts the realities of systemic 
racism both in our history and in our 
everyday life, the future that we must 
build is one based around unity. It is 
one where there is trust between the 
community and those who protect us. 
It is a future, though, where we also 
acknowledge that law enforcement of-
ficials are up to three times as likely 
to die from suicide as they are in the 
line of duty. 
Our officers have faced daily horrors 
during this pandemic. We have called 
them essential workers. They have al-
ways been essential. 
Something must be done in these hal-
lowed Chambers. 
That is exactly what this program is 
for. It allows police departments to use 
these funds in a way that works best 
for their officers. That is why I am 
honored to offer this amendment yet 
another year with Dr. RUIZ. 
Each and every day, officers in my 
community on Staten Island and South 
Brooklyn are hugging their children, 
hugging their partners, their spouses 
good-bye, not knowing if they are 
going to return home. That is a stress 
that they live with every day that none 
of us can relate to. 
This program must be advanced in 
honor of their service. 
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Wis-
consin (Mr. TIFFANY). 
Mr. TIFFANY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of the Stauber-Tiffany-Cox 
amendment, and I thank the gen-
tleman for the time. 
This amendment comes after many 
years of experiencing well-documented 
U.S. Navy maintenance backlogs and 
deficiencies in much-needed naval up-
grades. These backlogs and deficiencies 
seriously inhibit our force-in-readiness 
and operational capabilities. 
Our military needs to be the readiest 
it can be in order to meet the chal-
lenges of the future, and this amend-
ment will help them do that. 
Shipyards across the country are 
ready, willing, and able to support the 
maintenance and upgrade requirements 
needed by our naval assets, including 
one in Superior in my congressional 
district. These non-homeport shipyards 
can support vital surge capacity, ad-
dressing maintenance needs that can-
not be addressed in a timely fashion at 
homeports. This change will also sup-
port good, family-wage jobs across the 
country. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask for a ‘‘yes’’ vote 
on the amendment. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Ten-
nessee (Mr. COOPER). 
Mr. COOPER. Mr. Speaker, once 
again, I thank the great chair of the 
Appropriations Committee for includ-
ing three words that Nashville, Ten-
nessee, desperately needs in the pend-
ing legislation in order to better man-
age our Cumberland River. These three 
words are ‘‘flood risk management.’’ 
A decade ago, Nashville suffered a 
devastating flood, costing more than 
two dozen lives and billions of dollars 
in damages. To mitigate the chance of 
future flooding, we need to allow the 
two Army Corps of Engineers-operated 
dams that are directly upstream from 
Nashville, namely Old Hickory and 
Cordell Hull, to be used for flood risk 
management. 
Contrary to common sense, these 
dams today may not be used for flood 
control, even in emergencies, unless 
they have previously been congression-
ally authorized to do so. The congres-
sional authorization for Old Hickory 
and Cordell Hull Dams was made way 
back in 1946, and believe it or not, it 
still governs, regardless of the massive 
growth of Nashville and numerous sub-
sequent floods. 
The archaic authority that the Corps 
has been operating under only allows 
Old Hickory and Cordell Hull to be 
used for navigation, recreation, and hy-
dropower, but not for flood risk man-
agement. The Corps needs this flexi-
bility to protect everyone downstream, 
as well as to prevent possible overtop-
ping of their dams. 
I have buy-in from my District Corps 
to make this happen, and I hope the 
National Corps of Army Engineers lis-
tens. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank, again, Chair-
woman LOWEY and the entire Appro-
priations Committee for including this 
in the en bloc. 
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Mis-
souri (Mrs. HARTZLER). 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the chairwoman and the ranking 
member for including two of my 
amendments in this bipartisan en bloc 
package, and I would specifically like 
to highlight one of my amendments 
that will provide $5 million for the De-
partment of Defense to utilize commu-
nity-based, nonprofit, post-traumatic 
growth organizations for mental health 
treatment. 
Suicide prevention is a top priority 
for the DOD, yet suicides in our mili-
tary communities continue to rise. 
While current pharmaceutical and psy-
chotherapy approaches help alleviate 
some struggles, they fail to address 
two key elements of resilience: social 
and spiritual fitness. 
My amendment provides resources to 
enable the DOD to employ a variety of 
pathways for our servicemembers and 
will allow the Department to leverage 
the resilience expertise of post-trau-
matic growth organizations that are 
seeing so much success. I am excited 
about this potential. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate their sup-
port of this amendment, and I ask ev-
eryone to support this package. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. MCNERNEY). 
Mr. MCNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the chairwoman for her hard 
work on the appropriations bill this 
year. It is never easy. This year is even 
harder. I thank, not only the chair-
woman, but all the members of the 
committee. I thank them for their 
work, and I thank the chairwoman for 
including my amendment. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of my amendment to division B of H.R. 
7617. 
This amendment is critical to ad-
vancing our Nation’s competitiveness 
in artificial intelligence. It will require 
the National Science Foundation to ex-
amine, including through workshops, 
and to publish findings on the fol-
lowing: 
First, which universities are putting 
out significant peer reviewed AI re-
search, including based on quantity 
and number of citations; 
Second, for each of the identified uni-
versities, what specific factors enabled 
their AI research, including computing 
power, data sets, and availability, spe-
cialized curriculum, and industry and 
other partnerships; and 
Third, how universities not included 
in this list could implement these fac-
tors to produce AI research as well as

versities produce AI research. 
AI research is critical to our Nation’s 
competitiveness 
in 
artificial 
intel-
ligence. We need to have a competitive 
spirit if we want to compete with 
China and other countries. 
Mr. Speaker, as co-chair of the AI 
Caucus, I am proud that this important 
amendment has received strong bipar-
tisan support. I urge all of my col-
leagues to support it. 
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. BOST). 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for yielding, and I thank the 
ranking member and the chair for in-
cluding my amendment in the en bloc. 
Antidumping 
and 
countervailing 
duty laws exist to protect American 
workers and producers from economic 
injury caused by illegally traded for-
eign imports. 
Unfortunately, a tidal wave of ille-
gally traded foreign imports is reach-
ing our shores. Many of these products 
are produced by companies in non-
market economies like China. 
As of today, the International Trade 
Administration 
has 
initiated 
more 
than 91 new antidumping and counter-
vailing duty petitions. This is a record 
number, an increase of nearly 57 per-
cent from the previous year. 
Unfortunately, resources at ITA have 
not kept pace with increasing case-
loads and orders. Today, there are only 
eight AD/CVD offices when we need 
nine. 
While I appreciate the work of the 
chairman and ranking member to in-
crease trade remedies for resources, 
more must be done. American workers 
should not face delayed relief when 
other nations are cheating. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
LEVIN of Michigan). The time of the 
gentleman has expired. 
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
an additional 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from Illinois. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, Congress 
must provide sufficient resources to 
staff a ninth office. This includes pro-
viding a minimum of $96 million for 
antidumping and countervailing duty 
activities. 
In addition, we should require the 
Secretary of Commerce to provide 
quarterly reports to Congress on its 
progress in increasing AD/CVD activi-
ties and staffing levels. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. RUIZ). 
Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in support of my amendment to H.R. 
7617, which will increase funding for 
the Law Enforcement Mental Health 
and Wellness Act grant program by $2.5 
million. 
In order to comprehensively address 
policing in our Nation, we must ad-
dress the mental health needs of law 
enforcement officers. For example, offi-
cers are more than three times as like-
ly to die by suicide than from shoot-
ings. Rates of depression among offi-
cers are more than four times higher 
and rates of PTSD are five times high-
er than the general population. 
That is why I have worked to sub-
stantially increase funding each year 
since these grants were created to help 
with law enforcement training, peer 
mentoring, and mental health program 
activities. It is important that our offi-
cers know they are not alone and that 
we provide the resources they need to 
protect our communities as well as 
their own mental well-being. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative 
ROSE for cosponsoring this amendment. 
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Min-
nesota (Mr. STAUBER). 
Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairman and ranking member for 
including my amendment in this en 
bloc amendment. 
Mr. Speaker, my amendment is sim-
ple. It gives the Secretary of the Navy 
the authority to solicit contracts from 
non-homeport shipyards for mainte-
nance work to meet surge capacity 
should the shipyards meet the Navy’s 
requirement for ship repair work. 
Currently, the Navy has a tremen-
dous maintenance backlog, but under 
current law, there are certain restric-
tions that limit where naval vessels 
can undertake maintenance repair. Un-
less these restrictions are lifted, the 
Navy’s backlog will only increase expo-
nentially. 
At the same time, there are qualified 
shipyards in the rest of the United 
States, including the Great Lakes, Gulf 
Coast, and Alaska, that can perform re-
pair work for certain types of naval 
vessels. These yards have the capacity 
and skills to do this work. They just 
need the chance. 
Last year, an amendment of mine 
was adopted into the 2020 NDAA. It re-
quests the Navy report on the feasi-
bility of doing maintenance work on 
naval vessels at shipyards other than 
shipyards in the vessel’s homeport. The 
report was produced this spring, and 
within the report, the Navy concluded 
that the law could be modified to allow 
the Navy to use non-homeport ship-
yards to meet surge capacity. 
We have done the proper examina-
tion. Now it is time to give the Navy 
the authority it needs to reduce its 
maintenance backlog. This amendment 
provides an opportunity for the Navy 
to diversify their industrial base, cre-
ate resilience, and improve our mili-
tary readiness. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman 
TIFFANY and Congressman COX for co-
sponsoring this amendment. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Ms. TLAIB). 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
chairwoman for yielding. 
I rise today in support of this en bloc, 
which includes my amendment to pro-
hibit funds from being used to imple-
ment, administer, and enforce a recent 
rule forcing DNA collection from im-
migrant detainees. The rollout of this 
policy started in January when CBP 
and ICE began collecting DNA samples 
from people as young as 14 years old at 
the Border Patrol sector in Detroit, 
Michigan. 
Is this how we are going to do this? 
We are going to just stop and not try to 
fix our immigration system, and this is 
what we are going to do to people, 
which is violate their human rights? 
We must stop this administration 
from forcing collection of DNA, actual 
parts of people’s bodies, from families 
and individuals. We must push back, 
because this would indefinitely store 
DNA information, creating a perma-
nent law enforcement record for folks 
who may have never even been accused 
or convicted of a crime. 
So, Mr. Speaker, we must stand up 
against xenophobic criminalization of 
our immigrant neighbors. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Chairman 
SERRANO and Congresswoman OCASIO- 
CORTEZ for working with me on this 
measure, and I urge support for this 
amendment.

Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from South 
Carolina (Mr. WILSON). 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank Ranking Member KEN 
CALVERT for yielding. 
I am grateful to support two amend-
ments, Nos. 94 and 95 to division A of 
H.R. 
7617. 
These 
two 
amendments 
would prohibit taxpayer money from 
going to the Badr Organization and 
other murderous Iranian-backed mili-
tias comprising the Popular Mobiliza-
tion Units. 
The Badr Organization, perhaps the 
largest and most murderous Iranian- 
backed militia in Iraq, which has op-
pressed the people of Iran, was founded 
by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards 
Corps with the mandate to export 
Iran’s failing Islamic revolution. 
They are controlled by the tyran-
nical regime in Tehran and have a long 
history of involvement in attacks di-
rectly targeting Americans and our 
NATO allies in Iraq. Their deranged 
leader proudly brags of his involvement 
in the New Year’s Eve attack on un-
armed civilians at our Embassy in 
Baghdad. 
Badr and other cowardly Iranian- 
backed militias should not be the bene-
ficiaries of U.S. aid. They have blood 
on their hands, and the American peo-
ple should not be funding them. 
I urge my colleagues to support these 
amendments and the underlying bill. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. CA´ RDENAS). 
Mr. CA´ RDENAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to thank the Appropriations 
Committee 
and 
the 
subcommittee 
chairs for including two amendments 
that I submitted to H.R. 7617, division

B and division F, in the en bloc being 
considered today. 
For years, we have been funding a ju-
venile justice system that is robbing 
children of their futures and wasting 
taxpayer dollars. Today, experts, aca-
demics, advocates, and police depart-
ments agree we must change that for 
the better. 
I am proud to have introduced two 
amendments to H.R. 7617, division B, 
that will increase funding for programs 
that focus on girls in the juvenile jus-
tice system and invest in collaborative 
mental health and antirecidivism ini-
tiatives. 
I have also cosponsored an amend-
ment led by my colleague, Congress-
man RUSH, that will increase funding 
for community-based violence preven-
tion initiatives and also introduced an 
amendment to H.R. 7617, division F, 
that will increase funds for the Na-
tional Child Traumatic Stress Initia-
tive. This investment will help in-
crease 
evidence-based 
support 
for 
youth with mental health needs that 
have been exacerbated by this pan-
demic. 
I ask for my colleagues to support 
this bill and my amendments that are 
offered today. We need to have a better 
system for our children. 
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Wis-
consin (Mr. GROTHMAN). 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, this 
bipartisan amendment would transfer 
$21.3 billion from the procurement ac-
count to the Marine Corps’ JLTV and 
transfer it from the funds from the De-
fense-wide operation and maintenance 
account. 
We want to make sure the JLTV is 
delivered to our servicemembers on 
schedule and on cost. I have come to 
understand that, last year, the Marine 
Corps had substantially higher fielding 
costs than they anticipated for this ve-
hicle, so they had to transfer funds 
from purchasing more vehicles to field-
ing the vehicles they had. 
I understand why the Appropriations 
Committee, being fiscally responsible, 
saw that they shifted money and there-
fore gave them less of these new vehi-
cles than they thought they needed. 
However, the Marine Corps had two op-
tions: pay the incurred costs or not pay 
for these costs and not have oper-
ational JLTVs. The Marine Corps has 
demonstrated the need for these trucks 
and requested funding for 752 of them 
to be appropriated in FY21. 
My bipartisan amendment will ac-
complish this. I think we in Congress 
can work with the Marine Corps, the 
least-funded branch of the armed serv-
ices. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Colo-
rado (Mr. CROW). 
Mr. CROW. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in support of en bloc package No. 2, 
which contains my bipartisan amend-
ment to provide resources for a key na-
tional defense priority. 
The threat to our servicemembers 
from 
sophisticated, 
state-manufac-
tured unmanned aerial systems, or 
drones, is serious and requires us to 
pursue innovative and advanced solu-
tions. 
My amendment would increase by $5 
million the Army RDT&E air and mis-
sile defense advanced technology line 
in order to integrate and demonstrate 
a modular, multimission capability 
consisting of surveillance, electronic 
warfare, and high-energy laser into a 
remotely operated robotic vehicle. The 
integrated 
prototype 
would 
dem-
onstrate an ability to remotely detect, 
identify, and mitigate UAS threats so 
that we can better protect our troops 
and bases. 
I would like to thank Chairman VIS-
CLOSKY and Ranking Member CALVERT 
for working with me on this amend-
ment. Additionally, I would like to rec-
ognize Mr. LAMBORN, Mr. LANGEVIN, 
Mr. BUCK, and Ms. HAALAND for their 
leadership and support on this issue. 
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield

Report 116–461, offered by Mrs. LOWEY 
of New York: 
Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of my amendment which will 
provide an additional five million dollars in 
support of pancreatic cancer research, includ-
ing early detection, at the Department of De-
fense (DoD). Considering Rep. Lewis’ recent 
passing from pancreatic cancer, and Rep. 
HASTINGS’ current fight against this disease, I 
am grateful that my colleagues came together 
today to pass this amendment—included in En 
Bloc No. 2—by unanimous voice vote. This is 
a fitting tribute today, when our colleague, 
John Robert Lewis, is laid to rest in Atlanta. 
This amendment builds on the incredible 
work done by the Defense Subcommittee on 
this issue. The Defense Subcommittee has al-
ready appropriated $10 million for pancreatic 
research at the Department of Defense (DoD), 
which is an increase of four million dollars 
from the previous year. I am thankful to the 
Defense Subcommittee, especially Chairman 
VISCLOSKY, for their leadership on this issue. 
By passing my amendment, the House will 
increase appropriations for pancreatic cancer 
research at DoD from $10 million to $15. I am 
grateful that my colleague, Rep. ANNA ESHOO 
of California, has cosponsored my amend-
ment—she is a great leader on behalf of pan-
creatic cancer research and the Chairwoman 
of the Health Subcommittee in the Energy and 
Commerce Committee. I am also thankful for 
the support of the Pancreatic Cancer Action 
Network, whose support and advocacy for this 
amendment has been critical in our efforts. 
Today’s amendment also builds on my pre-
vious amendment to the National Defense Au-
thorization Act (NDAA), which the House 
passed last week, that authorized $5 million 
for a pancreatic cancer early detection initia-
tive at the Department of Defense (DoD). My 
amendment also complements report lan-
guage in the Defense appropriations bill, 
which states that ‘‘early detection of pancreatic 
cancer requires additional research’’ and en-
courages the director of the Congressionally 
Directed Medical Research Program (CDMRP) 
at DoD to ‘‘expand early detection research for 
pancreatic cancer’’ to include pre-diabetic and 
diabetic individuals, ‘‘as well as those in un-
derserved ethnic and minority communities.’’ 
Just a few weeks ago, this issue hit painfully 
close to home as America lost a giant to pan-
creatic cancer. Rep. John Lewis, our civil 
rights hero and Conscience of the Congress, 
passed away from pancreatic cancer only 
seven months after receiving his diagnosis. 
My amendment is inspired by Rep. Lewis’ 
courageous battle against pancreatic cancer 
and also by Rep. ALCEE HASTINGS’ ongoing 
fight. It is unacceptable that, despite being the 
third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in 
our country, pancreatic cancer still does not 
have a dedicated early detection initiative. 
Rep. Lewis’ short battle against pancreatic 
cancer is, sadly, often the norm for patients. In 
fact, the lack of research in ways to detect 
pancreatic cancer early has led to devastating 
consequences: sixty-six percent of patients 
live less than one year following their diag-
nosis. If diagnosed early, the five-year survival 
rate for pancreatic cancer patients is above 
eighty percent. However, if pancreatic cancer 
is detected late, the five-year survival rate 
drops to less than five percent. By failing to 
support our nation’s researchers with the 
means to find new ways to detect pancreatic 
cancer early, we are leaving American’s pan-
creatic cancer patients with few ways to detect 
this disease in time to extend the quality and 
duration of their lives. Rep. Lewis’ struggle 
against this horrifying disease should serve as 
a sobering reminder of the human cost of fail-
ing to support early detection research for 
pancreatic cancer. 
It’s important to note that persistent health 
care inequities and disparities for communities 
of color compound the devastation of pan-
creatic cancer. In fact, the incidence rate for 
pancreatic cancer among Black Americans is 
twenty percent higher than that of any other 
racial demographic. This disease is deadlier 
for us; the pancreatic cancer death rate is sev-
enteen percent higher for Black men than for 
white men. Significant evidence demonstrates 
that these disproportionate levels of pancreatic 
cancer are, in large part, rooted in disparities 
in health care and access to tests and 
diagnostics. As a result, the lack of pancreatic 
cancer early detection research accelerates

the racial unfairness in our health care sys-
tem, with devastating consequences for mi-
norities. 
At a time when our country is having a na-
tional conversation about the deep disparities 
in access to health care for Black and Brown 
people during a global pandemic, Congress 
must do everything within our power to im-
prove health outcomes through research and 
treatment. Passing this amendment is a critical 
way to increase our investment in pancreatic 
cancer research, including early detection, and 
to help address the pancreatic cancer dispari-
ties for communities of color. 
I thank my colleagues for including my 
amendment in En Bloc No. 2 and for passing 
this amendment today by voice vote. I urge 
my colleagues to support final passage of 
H.R. 7617 as amended. 
Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, year after 
year since coming to Congress, I have 
led efforts in the House to secure fund-
ing for Violence Against Women pro-
grams. I was honored to have led the 
efforts to renew the VAWA authorizing 
legislation in 2013. This is personal for 
me. And I want to make sure that for 
all of those who are going through the 
horror that domestic violence, they 
know that they have a place to go or 
services and supports to turn to get 
through those dark days. 
VAWA is essential legislation that 
provides the premier services for sur-
vivors of domestic violence and sexual 
assault. However, that authorizing lan-
guage is only as good as we actually 
fund it. With domestic violence-related 
homicides on the rise, now more than 
ever, we need these funds and we need 
these funds right now. 
I have offered two amendments to 
this bill for programs that are in des-
perate need for additional funds. 
I applaud the committee for their ef-
forts but like so many programs, the 
need continues to outpace available re-
sources. The first amendment I sub-
mitted is for the Transitional Housing 
Program. This program provides tran-
sitional housing and short-term hous-
ing assistance for victims and their 
children or other dependents. With 
many victims stuck at home during 
the pandemic, access to safe housing 
can be the difference between life and 
death. 
I also offered an amendment to in-
crease funding for the Sexual Assault 
Services Program. This essential pro-
gram provides grants to rape crisis cen-
ters and other agencies for survivors of 
sexual assault. I am so proud of the 
work that these programs have done 
but we cannot limit the resources re-
quired to combat sexual violence in our 
communities during these dire times. 
I am glad that these amendments 
have been included in En Bloc and 
thank Chairwoman LOWEY and Chair-
man SERRANO for their support. I en-
courage my colleagues to support this 
En Bloc. 
Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support 
of en bloc Amendment No. 2 which includes 
my amendment No. 35 to the Department of 
Defense Division to provide an additional $5 
Million for the Defense POW/MIA Accounting 
Agency (DPAA). 
Mr. Speaker, we ask much of our men and 
women in uniform, especially when they are 
deployed into battle. They risk injury and in-
deed their lives to carry out the missions that 
keep America safe and protect our values 
around the world. In return, we make a prom-
ise to them that if the worst were to happen, 
we would ensure that they will be brought 
home to their families. The Defense POW/MIA 
Accounting Agency’s mission is to do just that 
for the over 82,000 American Prisoners of War 
and Missing in Action servicemembers since 
World War II still waiting to be returned. 
The DPAA works through diplomatic part-
nerships with 46 host nations and collaborates 
with veterans service organizations, non-profit 
institutions. and other private sector entities in 
order to maximize scarce resources to find our 
missing servicemembers. They bring a stead-
fast dedication to this mission, and we must 
ensure they have the resources they need. 
Since the 2015 reorganization of its prede-
cessor organization, the Joint POW/MIA Ac-
counting Command, the DPAA has taken 
meaningful steps towards refining its mission, 
unifying agency functions and personnel, and 
augmenting its accounting and recovery oper-
ations. Through my position as Chairman of 
the National Security Subcommittee I have 
continued to exercise Congressional oversight 
to ensure that these reforms are being opti-
mally implemented, including leading several 
bipartisan Congressional Delegations to the 
DPPA headquarters and skeletal identification 
laboratory at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, 
as well as to their recovery missions in Viet-
nam, the Korean Peninsula and the Phil-
ippines. and most recently, holding an over-
sight hearing in the National Security Sub-
committee last November. 
The additional $5 Million that this amend-
ment provides will help the DPAA continue to 
build upon its reforms. as well as continue its 
ongoing and vital work. 
I would like to thank Representative JODY 
HICE for cosponsoring this amendment and for 
his leadership in supporting POW/MIA identi-
fication and recovery efforts. I would also like 
to thank Representative MARK GREEN, with 
whom I have the pleasure of collaborating on 
helping veterans who were deployed to the 
former K2 Forward Operating Base, for co-
sponsoring this amendment as well. 
I would like to thank Appropriations Com-
mittee Chairwoman LOWEY and Ranking Mem-
ber GRANGER for including this amendment in 
the en bloc. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
speak in strong support of En Bloc No. 2, to 
H.R. 7617, the Defense, Commerce, Justice, 
Science, Energy and Water Development, Fi-
nancial Services and General Government, 
Labor, Health and Human Services, Edu-
cation, Transportation, Housing, and Urban 
Development Appropriations Act. 
I thank Chairman MCGOVERN and Ranking 
Member COLE for including several amend-
ments in the Rule for House consideration of 
H.R. 7617. 
Jackson Lee Amendment No. 30, included 
in En Bloc No. 2, reduces funding for Oper-
ations and Maintenance-Defense Wide, by $5 
million and increases funding for Defense 
Health Care for PTSD by $5 million. 
My amendment increases funding for PTSD 
by $5,000,000. 
These funds should be used toward out-
reach activities targeting hard to reach vet-
erans, especially those who are homeless or 
reside in underserved urban and rural areas, 
who suffer from Post-Traumatic Stress Dis-
order (PTSD). 
Along with traumatic brain injury, PTSD is 
the signature wound suffered by the brave 
men and women fighting in Afghanistan, Iraq, 
and far off lands to defend the values and 
freedom we hold dear. 
For those of us whose daily existence is not 
spent in harm’s way, it is difficult to imagine 
the horrific images that American servicemen 
and women deployed in Iraq, Afghanistan, and 
other theaters of war see daily. 
In an instant, a suicide bomber, an IED, or 
an insurgent can obliterate your best friend 
right in front of your face. Yet, you are trained 
and expected to continue with the mission, 
and you do, even though you may not have 
even reached your 20th birthday. 
But there always comes a reckoning. And it 
usually comes after the stress and trauma of 
battle is over, and you are alone with your 
thoughts and memories. 
And the horror of those desperate and dan-
gerous encounters with the enemy and your 
own mortality come flooding back. 
PTSD was first brought to public attention in 
relation to war veterans, but it can result from 
a variety of traumatic incidents, such as tor-
ture, being kidnapped or held captive, bomb-
ings, or natural disasters such as floods or 
earthquakes. 
We can now add COVID–19 with the stress 
of watching the American people fight off a foe 
they cannot confront and defeat. 
We must address PTSD in all its forms so 
that it can be defeated. 
Jackson Lee Amendment No. 31, included 
in En Bloc No. 2, reduces funding for Oper-
ations and Maintenance-Defense Wide, by 
$10 million and increases funding for Defense 
Health Care for Triple Negative Breast Cancer 
(TNBC) by $10 million. 
Jackson Lee Amendment No. 31 reduces 
funding for Operations and Maintenance-De-
fense Wide, by $10 million and increases 
funding for Defense Health Care for Triple 
Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) by $10 mil-
lion. 
My amendment increases funding for the 
Defense Health Program’s research and de-
velopment by $10 million. These funds will ad-
dress the question of breast cancer in the 
United States military. 
The American Cancer Society calls several 
strains of breast cancer as a particularly ag-
gressive subtype associated with lower sur-
vival rates; in this instance, it’s a triple nega-
tive. But I raise an article that says: ‘‘Fighting 
a Different Battle; Breast Cancer and the Mili-
tary.’’ 
The American Cancer Society reports the 
following 5-year survival rates for breast can-
cer: 
stage 0 to 1—near 100 percent survival 
rate; 
stage 2—about 93 percent survival rate; 
stage 3—72 percent survival rate; and 
stage 4 (metastatic)—22 percent survival 
rate. 
Triple Negative Breast Cancer is more ag-
gressive than other types of breast cancer. 
Studies have shown that triple-negative 
breast cancer is more likely to spread beyond 
the breast and more likely to recur (come 
back) after treatment. 
The risk appears to be greatest in the first 
few years after treatment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4136 
July 30, 2020 
For example, a study of more than 1,600 
women in Canada published in 2007 found 
that women with triple-negative breast cancer 
were at higher risk of having the cancer recur 
outside the breast—but only for the first 3 
years. 
In 2013, the American Cancer Society Sur-
veillance and Health Services Institute esti-
mated that 27,060 black women would be di-
agnosed with the illness. 
The rate of breast cancer is 10 percent 
lower in African American women than white 
women—it is the type of breast cancer (Triple 
Negative) that African American women con-
tract that is alarming. 
Because African American women are diag-
nosed in greater numbers with Triple Negative 
Breast Cancer, we have a five-year survival 
rate of 78 percent after diagnosis as com-
pared to 90 perent for white women. 
The incidence rate of breast cancer among 
women under 45 is higher for African Amer-
ican women compared to white women. 
Triple Negative Breast Cancer: 
Accounts for between 13 percent and 25 
percent of all breast cancer in the United 
States; 
onset is at a younger age; 
is more aggressive; and 
is more likely to metastasize. 
Currently, 70 percent of women with meta-
static triple negative breast cancer do not live 
more than five years after being diagnosed. 
African American women are 3 times more 
likely to develop triple-negative breast cancer 
than White women. 
African-American women have prevalence 
TNBC of 26 percent vs. 16 percent in non-Afri-
can-American women. 
Funding to support women serving in the 
military to address the incidence of Triple Neg-
ative Breast cancer can benefit from this Jack-
son Lee Amendment. 
Jackson Lee Amendment No. 29, included 
in En Bloc No. 2, increases and decreases the 
Department of Defense Military Retirement 
Fund by $2 million to provide the Secretary of 
Defense the flexibility needed for technical as-
sistance for U.S. military women to military

targeting women and children as a weapon of 
war, terrorism, human trafficking, and nar-
cotics trafficking.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1067, the gen-
tlewoman from New York (Mrs. LOWEY) 
and the gentleman from California (Mr. 
CALVERT) each will control 15 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise in support of the Republican en 
bloc, which includes important changes 
to the bill that would enable us to fin-
ish our work and deliver to the Presi-
dent a bill that he could sign, including 
removing 
language 
prohibiting 
the 
funding of the border wall. 
While I certainly agree with my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
that wall funding should not come 
from the DOD, it is unfortunate that 
the majority continues to ignore the 
problem along our southern border and 
funds no wall construction or Border 
Patrol agents in their FY 2021 Home-
land Security appropriations bill. In 
doing so, they are forcing the adminis-
tration to deal with the security of our 
borders through any means possible, 
including using DOD funds to build the 
wall. 
Finally, I will simply say that all 
Members should have an opportunity 
to have their voice heard on annual ap-
propriation bills on the House floor. 
While I acknowledge the difficulty of 
doing our work safely during the pan-
demic, and I thank the chairwoman for 
the bipartisan en bloc, which includes 
many of our minority’s priorities, 
nothing should stifle our Members 
from having the opportunity to offer 
debate and have a vote on an amend-
ment germane to the bill. 
Therefore, I urge adoption of the Re-
publican en bloc, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. CUELLAR), a member of the Com-
mittee on Appropriations. 
Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Speaker, I want 
to thank Chairwoman LOWEY for all 
the wonderful work that she has done 
on this appropriation bill, a very bal-
anced bill that she has done, and I 
want to thank KAY GRANGER and also 
Mr. CALVERT for the work that they 
have done, even though we do have a 
disagreement. Let me talk about the 
wall. 
With all due respect, I always get a 
kick out of people who don’t live close 
to the border, they might live about 
1,000 miles away from the border, but 
they are the first ones who would tell 
us what we need to have at our border, 
in our own backyard. 
Earlier this month, President AMLO 
from Mexico was at a press conference 
with 
President 
Trump. 
President 
Trump had said we need a wall, and we 
are going to have Mexico pay. I did not 
hear the President say: Where is that 
check to pay for the wall? 
So what is happening is, the master 
dealmaker is now asking the U.S. tax-
payers to pay for this wall after he 
promised that Mexico would pay for 
this wall. 
Again, the taxpayers are paying for 
this. We are taking money away from 
the defense. We are taking money away 
from military construction. And we are 
taking money away from other places 
to pay for that 14th century solution 
called a wall. 
I will tell you where we are on the 
wall. After 3 years, we only have 3 
miles—and I emphasize 3 miles—of new 
wall. Everything else is replacement. 
Everything else is double wall—only 3 
miles of new fencing that we have had. 
Again, if you look at it, and I think 
you have seen some of the videos, the 
wall is falling apart. It is falling apart. 
Again, why are we spending billions of 
dollars to build this wall when it is 
falling apart? 
If you ask every Border Patrol chief, 
including the Border Patrol chief under 
President Trump, if you ask him, ‘‘How 
much time does the wall buy you?’’ 
they say, ‘‘A few seconds or a few min-
utes, depending on who wants to cross 
over.’’ 
So why are we spending billions of 
dollars to stop this? I have asked the 
experts on the border, which is Border 
Patrol: Do we need a wall? I always ask 
this question: Is it post-2012, or pre- 
2012? Because before 2012, the Border 
Patrol agents were saying that the 
wall was ineffective and a waste of tax-
payers’ dollars itself. 
Now, there are two main reasons why 
people called for the wall. One is to 
stop people coming in illegally, and the 
other is to stop drugs. 
Let me talk about people coming in 
illegally. If you look at it, the last 7 
consecutive years, visa overstays ex-
ceeded illegal border crossings. If you 
look at the last 2016–2017 numbers that 
we have, visa overstays accounted for 
62 percent of the newly undocumented 
immigrants that we had. 
If you look at the number one viola-
tors, with due respect to our Cana-
dians, it is Canadians that are the 
number one violators of these visa 
overstays. So it is not people coming 
from the south, but it is visa overstays. 
I dare you to say that we need a wall 
on the northern border. I dare any of 
you all to say that, and I bet nobody is 
going to say that.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4138 
July 30, 2020 
If you want to stop folks from com-
ing in, look at visa overstays. Sixty- 
two percent of the undocumented im-
migrants 
that 
we 
have 
are 
visa 
overstays. 
Now, the other reason is drugs. 
Drugs, we have to stop the drugs. If 
you look at the official numbers from 
CBP, you will see that in FY19, just 
last year, 89 percent of the cocaine 
coming into the United States came up 
through bridges, our bridges. Only 11 
percent 
came 
through 
in-between 
bridges. 
If you look at heroin, 84 percent of 
the heroin that came into the United 
States came in through our bridges, 
and then the rest came in in-between. 
If you talk about fentanyl, and I have 
heard so many people talk about 
fentanyl, 92 percent of all the fentanyl 
coming into the United States comes 
through our bridges, and only 8 percent 
in-between itself. 
If you talk about meth, 81 percent of 
all the meth coming into the United 
States comes through our bridges. 
Again, I want to stop drugs. I want to 
stop illegal migration. But we have to 
make sure that we look at this the 
right way. 
Finally, let me say, I believe in pri-
vate property rights. Why is it that we 
have forgotten about private property 
rights for all of those people who live 
along the border? 
Imagine if you had land there for 
generations and then here comes the 
big bad Federal Government to take 
the land away. We have to protect the 
environment, private property rights, 
and if you want to stop drugs and peo-
ple coming in, let’s do it the right way. 
So again, I believe in law and order, 
but we have to do it the right way. 
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from West 
Virginia (Mrs. MILLER). 
b 1245 
Mrs. MILLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to speak on my amendment to 
fund the border wall. 
Our country has suffered this year. 
We have all experienced hardship as a 
pandemic rapidly made its way onto 
our shores. Americans are resilient. We 
are rebuilding our economy, and we 
will persevere. 
However, we must not forget about 
the ongoing crisis on our southern bor-
der. In their bill, my colleagues across 
the aisle want to strike all funding for 
border wall construction. This is not 
the time. We need to focus. 
It was just months ago when nearly 
every Member of Congress joined to-
gether to ban deadly fentanyl from our 
country. This was such a strong state-
ment to showcase our commitment to 
combating the opioid epidemic. Thanks 
to our strong border wall and the he-
roic efforts of the men and women who 
guard it, our border is currently more 
secure than it has ever been. Defunding 
the wall will weaken enforcement ef-
forts and hurt our communities. 
During the pandemic, overdoses in 
West Virginia alone have risen by 50 
percent compared to a year ago. Now is 
not the time to turn a blind eye toward 
the drug smugglers who are looking to 
capitalize on our hardship. 
We cannot abandon our vulnerable 
populations. We cannot stop construc-
tion. We need to finish the wall. We 
need a strong and stable border to show 
our commitment to stop crime and 
make sure that security is available to 
every single American. 
For these reasons, Mr. Speaker, I 
urge passage of my amendment and the 
entire Republican en bloc. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Ala-
bama (Mr. ADERHOLT), who is the rank-
ing member of the Commerce, Justice, 
Science, and Related Agencies Sub-
committee. 
Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I do 
rise in support of this amendment. The 
amendment improves the bill by in-
cluding addressing several important 
Republican priorities, especially in di-
vision B. 
For example, it increases the funding 
for school hardening measures under 
the STOP School Violence Act. It off-
sets this cost with a reduction of unau-
thorized appropriations for a new pro-
gram that is included in the bill that 
will provide lawyers for undocumented 
immigrants arriving at our southern 
border. 
The amendment also strikes a provi-
sion in the bill that would restrict the 
data of the Census Bureau that it can 
provide to the American people. The 
American people deserve more infor-
mation when it comes to the Census, 
not less. The Trump administration 
has rightly made developing complete 
and accurate data on the U.S. popu-
lation a top priority. 
In addition, this amendment high-
lights the important work of the De-
partment of Commerce in advancing 
U.S. leadership in space. 
Finally, the amendment would in-
crease funding for NOAA’s Weather and 
Climate Operational Supercomputing 
System. 
In closing, Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to commend the sponsors of this 
amendment for their efforts to high-
light important, yet sometimes over-
looked, priorities that very much im-
prove this bill, and I recommend a 
‘‘yes’’ on the amendment. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Wash-
ington (Mr. NEWHOUSE). The gentleman 
is from the land of hops. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from California 
for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, one in five households 
with a disabled family member falls 
below the Federal poverty line. These 
families rely on home healthcare pro-
viders who are often family members of 
the disabled to care for them and to 
improve their quality of life. These 
providers receive modest compensation 
for their efforts provided by dedicated 
State Medicaid dollars. 
For decades, Federal law has required 
that Medicaid providers be paid di-
rectly and in full for the services they 
provide. However, some States, includ-
ing my own home State of Washington, 
have been withholding union dues via 
payroll deductions from payments to 
Medicaid-subsidized home caregivers. 
In many cases, this is done without the 
knowledge or the consent of the care-
giver, and it is in clear violation of the 
law. 
Now, this is no small problem. In 2017 
alone, $150 million was diverted to 
unions from Medicaid payments to 
350,000 caregivers. Fortunately, last 
year, the Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services finalized a rule to 
stop this predatory practice that takes 
money out of the pockets of in-home 
providers. However, language in the 
bill would defund implementation of 
this rule and allow States to continue 
to circumvent Federal law. 
My amendment strikes section 245 of 
the bill to ensure that CMS can enforce 
the law and protect home healthcare 
providers from having their Medicaid 
payments diverted to third parties. 
Mr. Speaker, let me be clear: Ending 
this illegal deduction does not prevent 
caregivers from joining unions if they 
wish; rather, it empowers them by giv-
ing them the choice to do so. My 
amendment gives them that choice. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the amendment. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. WRIGHT). 
Mr. WRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of my amendment 
which would remove harmful language 
that seeks to upend religious freedom 
protections for organizations across 
America. 
Earlier this year, the Department of 
Labor took an important step in pre-
serving the Constitution and ensuring 
the rights of religious employers. It is 
simple: Faith-based groups should be 
on equal footing as they compete with 
other employers without having to give 
up their sincerely held religious be-
liefs. Organizations such as the Salva-
tion 
Army 
and 
Catholic 
Charities 
should not be afraid to partner with 
the Federal Government to help Ameri-
cans. 
Unfortunately, if House Democrats 
have their way and roll back these im-
portant religious protections, these or-
ganizations will face uncertainty and 
confusion in the Federal contracting 
process, possibly opting out altogether. 
Beyond the fact that it is wrong to 
tell these organizations that they can-
not work with the Federal Government 
to provide essential services, it is flat- 
out unconstitutional. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
stand by their commitment to the Con-
stitution and protect religious liberty

for all Americans by supporting my 
amendment. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. BOST). 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank the chairman and the ranking 
member for including my amendment 
in this en bloc package. 
My amendment has a straightforward 
goal: increasing support for school 
safety grants under the STOP School 
Violence Act. 
Last Congress, I introduced legisla-
tion which is now law to provide grants 
to local school districts to strengthen 
security on school grounds. This was 
made part of the broader bipartisan 
STOP School Violence Act enacted last 
Congress. 
In my southern Illinois district, 
these funds have been used by the 
Shawnee Community School District 
to build an emergency communications 
cell tower. The Meridian School Dis-
trict uses the funds to hire a school re-
sources officer. 
As a father, grandfather, and former 
first responder, I hope that our young 
people can return to the classroom 
soon. I hope that this money is avail-
able to make sure that they are even 
safer. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the en bloc package. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX), who is the 
ranking member of the Education and 
Labor Committee. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my colleague from 
California for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight 
an issue of great importance to Ameri-
cans: the ability to choose high-quality 
and affordable healthcare and increase 
competition among healthcare pro-
viders to drive down costs. 
Included in this package is my 
amendment to codify the administra-
tion’s rule requiring hospitals to post 
the prices they have negotiated with 
insurers and their cash discounted 
prices for about 300 common services. 
This rule is a step forward towards em-
powering patients by giving them the 
information they need to make in-
formed decisions and take control of 
their healthcare. 
Pulling back the curtain on hospital 
charges allows patients to shop around 
for the best price and will spur com-
petition and innovation among hos-
pitals for these services and, ulti-
mately, result in lower prices for pa-
tients. It is a shame that Democrats 
appear to oppose this commonsense 
policy which will save money for pa-
tients and our healthcare system. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on this en bloc amendment. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from North 
Carolina (Mr. BISHOP). 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my 
amendment No. 225. 
Last year, the Trump administration 
finalized a rule to allow employers to 
use flexible health reimbursement ar-
rangements, HRAs, to fund insurance 
premiums for coverage purchased on 
the individual market. This will allow 
more Americans to shop for their own 
coverage and allow more employers to 
provide quality health benefits. Ex-
panding the use of HRAs will increase 
overall coverage by 800,000 and provide 
strong protections for those with pre-
existing conditions. 
Congress needs to provide certainty 
for employers who want to provide this 
benefit. That is why my amendment 
would ensure that no funds in this act 
may be used to withdraw the final HRA 
rule. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge the House to 
adopt my commonsense amendment. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Wis-
consin (Mr. STEIL). 
Mr. STEIL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in support of my amendment, which is 
included in this bloc. 
My amendment strikes language in 
the underlying bill which would pre-
vent the Securities and Exchange Com-
mission from implementing important 
reforms to the rules governing share-
holder proposals. 
The current rules, which haven’t 
been updated since the Eisenhower ad-
ministration, allow activists to repeat-
edly resubmit divisive proposals that 
have been rejected by a vast majority 
of shareholders. In fact, many re-
submissions received only a single- 
digit share of the vote the year before. 
A 2018 study of almost 2,500 activist 
shareholder proposals over nearly two 
decades found that proposals that had 
been submitted three or more times 
made up 32 percent of all the failed pro-
posals. This can have a significant neg-
ative 
impact 
on 
public 
companies 
which continue to decline in number. 
Responding to each proposal takes 
time, and companies are forced to deal 
with multiple resubmissions of failed 
proposals each year. Importantly, this 
diverts the limited resources away 
from growth, job creation, and innova-
tion. 
Especially 
in 
today’s 
challenging 
economic environment, we should sup-
port policies that encourage oppor-
tunity. The SEC’s efforts to raise the 
bar for resubmissions are a step for-
ward for workers, investors, and the 
health of our economy. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no additional speakers, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ 
vote, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I urge a 
‘‘no’’ vote, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1067, the pre-
vious 
question

LOWEY).

AMENDMENT NO. 49 OFFERED BY MS. OCASIO- 
CORTEZ 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 49 
printed in House Report 116–461. 
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
have an amendment at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
At the end of division A (before the short 
title) insert the following: 
SEC. ll. None of the funds appropriated 
or otherwise made available by this Act may 
be used by any of the Armed Forces for 
twitch.tv or esports activities. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1067, the gen-
tlewoman from New York (Ms. OCASIO- 
CORTEZ) and a Member opposed each 
will control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
present this amendment by opening 
with the stance of the U.S. Marine 
Corps, which is that: ‘‘War is not a 
game.’’ I’m quoting the Marines. The 
Marine Service brand and issues associ-
ated with combat are too serious to be 
gamified in a responsible manner. 
Now, this amendment is specifically 
to block recruitment practices and 
funding for recruitment practices on 
platforms such as Twitch.tv, which are 
live-streaming 
platforms 
that 
are 
largely populated by children well 
under the age of military recruitment 
rules. Children as young as 13, and of-
tentimes as young as 12, are targeted 
for recruitment forms that can be filled 
online. 
This amendment is in direct align-
ment with both those values but also 
the values that children should not be 
targeted in general for many mar-
keting purposes, in addition to mili-
tary service. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to the amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from California is recognized 
for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3

preciate the gentleman yielding, and I

do appreciate the gentlewoman’s con-
cerns. 
Mr. Speaker, I would begin my re-
marks by saying the United States 
military is a very special place. Only 
about 30 percent of young Americans 
between 17 and 24 are eligible to join 
the military. Others are not because of 
educational issues, because of health 
issues, and other circumstances. 
It is clear we have to make an invest-
ment in society. But having said that, 
this is a special place and we ought to 
cast a very broad net to encourage 
young Americans to serve their coun-
try in the military, especially those—I 
would point out, living in Gary, Indi-
ana—in 
disadvantaged 
communities, 
many of which don’t even know that 
opportunity exists. 
The gentlewoman is concerned about 
abuses, and I share that concern, and I 
think Mr. CALVERT certainly does. We 
have seen abuses—setting the issue of 
technology aside—with recruiters mak-
ing false promises. That is why we have 
controls in place. That is why those 
people are punished. That is why we 
have Congressional oversight. 
Mr. Speaker, I do understand the 
criticism of younger people viewing 
esports channels. The ArmyEsports 
team Twitch channel has been set to 
18-plus since August of 2019. I would 
grant that it is difficult in many in-
stances to verify age online, and I do 
find recent media reports on the 
ArmyEsports team in the banning of 
commentators concerning. It is dif-
ficult to balance a platform’s churn of 
service and community guidelines with 
free speech, and I understand that 
ArmyEsports has taken a pause on 
streaming and is reviewing its internal 
policies and procedures. 
We, on the committee, certainly look 
forward to seeing the results of that re-
view to allow the military to learn how 
to ensure that these platforms are used 
properly in the future. 
The gentlewoman rightly also points 
out the issue of age. I would point out 
to all of my colleagues in this Cham-
ber, that our bill already funds edu-
cational programs that give children 
under the age of 16 exposure to mili-
tary service, including Junior ROTC, 
Civil Air Patrol, STARBASE, National 
Guard Youth Challenge, Young Ma-
rines, and Sea Cadets. These programs 
are in high demand and enjoy great bi-
partisan support. 
Mr. Speaker, the concern is well- 
placed. It is the reason we have to exer-
cise great oversight and control, but I 
do have to oppose the gentlewoman’s 
amendment. 
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, 
once again, I think it is extraordinarily 
important, especially when it comes to 
emerging technology platforms, that 
intervention be taken extraordinarily 
seriously, because once these lights are 
turned on, it is very difficult to roll 
them back. Right now, currently chil-
dren on platforms such as Twitch are 
bombarded with banner ads that link 
to recruitment signup forms that can 
be submitted by children as young as 12 
years old. These are not educational 
outreach programs, but recruitment 
forms for the military. 
A 
Twitter 
account 
for 
the 
USArmyEsports team linked to a page 
with ‘‘Register to Win’’ at the top—no 
details on what one could even win— 
and a signup form that, according to a 
tiny disclosure at the bottom of the 
page, consents to contact by an Army 
recruiter, again allowing people as 
young as 12 years old to submit this 
form. 
Viewers on the Army’s Twitch chan-
nel are repeatedly presented with an 
automated prompt that says they 
could win an X-box Elite Series 2 con-
troller that cost upwards of $200, and a 
link where they can enter the ‘‘give-
away.’’ It, too, directs them to a re-
cruitment form, which has no addi-
tional mention of a contest, odds, total 
number of winners, or when a drawing 
will occur. 
Again, it is extraordinarily impor-
tant that we approach and study 
emerging technologies, including live- 
streaming, which is a platform that is 
exploding in use, particularly among 
young people. And when it comes to 
issues of technology, I believe that we 
should act with reservation and cau-
tion first rather than entering with 
both feet in and then trying to undo 
damage that could potentially be done. 
That is why I believe that we should, 
again, restrain and restrict ourselves 
from explicit recruitment tactics—not 
others, but recruitment specifically— 
on platforms that children are using to 
play games from Animal Crossing to 
Call of Duty. 
Additionally, there was also the ex-
traordinary concern within the Marine 
Corps of conflating military service 
with shoot-em-up style first-person 
shooters. We cannot conflate war and 
military service with this kind of 
gamified format. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, serving 
in the United States military is an 
honor, and we should be thanking the 
thousands of young people who choose 
to join the military to defend this 
great Nation. 
The assertion that joining the mili-
tary is a bad thing for low-income 
youth or any young person, is fun-
damentally flawed. It is insulting to 
the men and women who currently 
serve and those who served before 
them. 
The military recruits the best and 
the brightest. They should not be pro-
hibited from recruiting the best and 
the 
brightest 
from 
lower, 
socio-
economic classes or in the activities in 
which young people participate, such 
as esports. 
In fact, studies show that when com-
pared to their peers, military veterans 
do better across-the-board on edu-
cation attainment, income, and quality 
of life. 
It is important to remember the 
quotation, ‘‘This Nation will remain 
the land of the free only so long as it 
is the home of the brave.’’ The world is 
more dangerous now than it has ever 
been. It is because of the brave men 
and women in our military that our 
freedoms and security are assured. 
I respect each branch of our military 
and it is the moral responsibility of 
every Member of this body to show 
these men and women the respect and 
the appreciation they deserve. Please 
join me in doing just that and voting 
‘‘no’’ on this amendment. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
my time.

ant to House Resolution 1067, the pre-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4141 
July 30, 2020 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Oregon. 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, 
since 1996, when California voters made 
that State the first in the country to 
legalize medical marijuana, we have 
seen a revolution taking place in can-
nabis policy. This has been driven al-
most entirely by advocates and activ-
ists mounting successful campaigns to 
have voters in 33 States legalize med-
ical marijuana. 
Starting in 2012 in Washington State, 
in Colorado, followed quickly by Or-
egon and Alaska, voters legalized adult 
use. Today, 10 States, and the District 
of Columbia, have legalized adult use. 
In all, 47 States have legalized some 
form of cannabis use. This year, voters 
in 6 more States will decide on future 
progress. 
Through this revolution, we have 
watched, across the country, shifting 
attitudes and moving forward. The 
Federal Government, sadly, is still 
trapped by the dead hand of Richard 
Nixon’s ‘‘war on drugs,’’ declaring can-
nabis a Schedule I controlled sub-
stance—wait a minute—despite objec-
tive evidence that it is not highly ad-
dictive and it does have therapeutic 
benefit. 
That is why we are making progress 
in this Congress to catch up with the 
rest of America, and the multi-billion 
dollar—$12 billion by some estimates 
this year—industry, which pays $2 bil-
lion to State and local governments, 
much of it, sadly, with $20 bills in duf-
fel bags. 
Mr. Speaker, we passed the SAFE 
Banking Act on the floor of this House 
earlier in the Congress with 321 bipar-
tisan votes. Sadly, it is still lan-
guishing in the Senate, but luckily, it 
is in the HEROES Act that we passed 
over to them. We have passed out of 
the Committee on the Judiciary, the 
MORE Act, which would fully legalize 
cannabis. And make no mistake, that 
day is coming. 
Over two-thirds of the American vot-
ers support it, including a majority of 
Republican voters, and that support is 
what fueled a situation today when 47 
States have some form of cannabis that 
is legalized. 
In the meantime, until that day of 
reckoning comes, we must pass this 
amendment to assure the Federal Gov-
ernment does not interfere with State- 
legal cannabis activities, and that we 
extend those same protections to Trib-
al interests. 
This modest extension of existing 
protections, which we have achieved 
through the appropriations process in 
the past, is critically important we re-
tain and continue. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the 
amendment, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in opposition to this amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Alabama is recognized for 
5 minutes. 
Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, this 
proposal that is being referred to here 
would prevent Federal law enforcement 
from enforcing current law, protecting 
public health, and ensuring community 
safety. 
Under the Controlled Substances Act, 
the Drug Enforcement Administration 
defines Schedule I drugs as ‘‘having no 
currently accepted medical use and a 
high potential for abuse.’’ And accord-
ing to the National Institute on Drug 
Abuse, there is scientifically ‘‘no rec-
ognized medical benefit from smoking 
or eating marijuana plants.’’ 
Claims of benefits from smoked or in-
gested marijuana are very unreliable 
and 
generally 
outright 
fabrication. 
However, it is an established fact that 
marijuana use has real health and so-
cial harms. This is true especially in 
children; young people with developing 
brains and those with impaired phys-
ical or psychological conditions. And 
new data shows crime and health prob-
lems from marijuana use and traf-
ficking, in particular, in States that 
have criminalized its use. 
Mr. Speaker, this amendment sends 
the wrong message about the most 
widely abused drug in the United 
States. It should be noted—and this is 
very important—according to the DEA, 
more young people receive treatment 
for marijuana dependency than for al-
cohol or all other illegal drugs com-
bined. This amendment ignores the 
problems of abuse and sends the false 
message to youth that smoking mari-
juana is healthy. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge the re-
jection of this amendment, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I 
would respectfully disagree. As a prac-
tical matter, it is easy to verify that it 
does have therapeutic value. That is 
why voters in 33 States have approved 
it. 
I have had experience with what has 
happened with our veterans, who make 
the strong argument that this has ac-
tually saved their lives: People with 
extreme nausea from chemotherapy. 
Babies with extreme seizure disorders 
are being tortured, and the only relief 
comes from the use of cannabis. That is 
why even States that haven’t approved 
medical marijuana have passed it, be-
cause it works. 
b 1315 
The existing scheduling is an out-
right lie. That is why we have prob-
lems, a Federal policy that is so out of 
touch with a majority of the American 
public, with objective evidence, what 
people have seen with their own eyes, 
protecting babies from being tortured 
or veterans with PTSD. That is one of 
the problems we have, a policy that is 
so out of sync that it is hard to con-
vince children that they should believe 
the admonition. 
We ought to legalize it, tax it, regu-
late it, keep it out of hands of kids, but 
don’t deal with what is, for many 
adults, a medicine or a choice in terms 
of what they want to do. This is where 
the American public has been going. 
The existing policy of prohibition is an 
abject failure. 
In the gentleman’s home State, we 
watched, just this last week, a veteran 
from Phoenix driving to North Caro-
lina was discovered to have medical 
marijuana in his possession and subject 
to a 5-year prison sentence. 
That is outrageous. That is not where 
the rest of America is. That is one of 
the reasons people are outraged in 
terms of Black Lives Matter. This se-
lective enforcement of nonsensical pol-
icy has posed huge problems for Black 
Americans. 
I strongly urge approval of this 
amendment, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, let me 
just say, I know the gentleman from 
Oregon is very passionate, and I re-
spect the gentleman very much, but I 
do want to say that this amendment 
ignores the problems of abuse. It sends 
a false message to our young people 
across this country that smoking mari-
juana is healthy. And I strongly urge 
the rejection of the amendment. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4142 
July 30, 2020 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Illinois. 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of my amendment, which will prevent 
Federal funds from being used by the 
Department of Justice to undermine 
the Affordable Care Act. 
After Republicans failed in their doz-
ens of attempts to repeal the Afford-
able Care Act legislatively, they are 
now fighting in the courts to overturn 
the law in its entirety. My amendment 
will stop them. 
You see, if ACA is overturned, 23 mil-
lion Americans would lose the afford-
able care they depend on; prescription 
drug costs would increase for seniors 
on Medicare; being a woman would 
once again be considered a preexisting 
condition; insurance companies would 
cap the benefits and kick children off 
their parents’ plans before their 26th 
birthday; and 130 million Americans 
with preexisting conditions would lose 
their protections. 
We simply cannot go back to those 
days. 
Affordable healthcare that covers 
preexisting conditions has always been 
crucial, but it has never been more im-
portant than right now. 
Today, over 4 million Americans 
have 
been 
diagnosed 
with 
the 
coronavirus, a new preexisting condi-
tion. Over 30 million Americans have 
lost their jobs, and over 5 million have 
lost their health insurance at the worst 
possible time. 
While this health and economic crisis 
has been unfolding, the Trump admin-
istration will not stop until they de-
stroy the Affordable Care Act. Not 
even a once-in-a-generation global pan-
demic will keep them from coming for 
your healthcare. 
Well, not on my watch. As a nurse, 
and as an American with a preexisting 
condition, I understand personally why 
we must fight this with everything we 
have got: 130 million Americans depend 
on it. 
Today, we fight for them as we send 
a crystal-clear message to the Trump 
administration: Keep your hands off 
our healthcare. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I 
claim the time in opposition to the 
amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Alabama is recognized for 
5 minutes. 
Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
unfortunately, 
ObamaCare has been an unlawful fail-
ure. Fortunately, this administration 
remains committed to providing more 
affordable healthcare options to all 
Americans. 
Debating the prospects of future judi-
cial action will not help us deliver on 
our promise to bring better healthcare 
to our constituents. Congress needs to 
work, rather, on a bipartisan basis, 
with the administration, to ensure 
quality, affordable care. 
In addition, it is not appropriate for 
Congress to tell the executive branch 
what positions it should take in court. 
Litigation strategy is the responsi-
bility and the prerogative of the De-
partment of Justice. 
The Attorney General, as the liti-
gator for the United States, should be 
able to advance what he believes are 
defensible and reasonable legal posi-
tions. The Attorney General has con-
cluded that the position of the States 
challenging the ACA and the district 
court is a defensible and reasonable 
legal position for the department to 
take. 
Questions of the constitutionality 
should be determined by the courts, 
not through a partisan debate on a 
funding limitation to an appropriations 
bill, which we are doing this afternoon. 
Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I would urge 
a ‘‘no’’ vote on this amendment, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Kansas (Ms. DAVIDS). 
Ms. DAVIDS of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today in support of the amend-
ment introduced by Congresswoman 
LAUREN UNDERWOOD, which would pre-
vent the Department of Justice from 
spending taxpayer dollars on a lawsuit 
that would tear down the landmark Af-
fordable Care Act. 
To effectively fight the coronavirus, 
we have to make sure that every per-
son has access to affordable, quality 
healthcare. But even during a global 
pandemic, when so many people are 
finding themselves without health in-
surance, this administration is deter-
mined to eliminate every last protec-
tion and benefit afforded by the ACA. 
These 
benefits 
include 
allowing 
young adults to stay on their parents’ 
plan until age 26, ensuring women and 
men are charged the same rates, and 
protecting people with preexisting con-
ditions, things like asthma and diabe-
tes. 
If this lawsuit is successful, 94,000 
Kansans would lose their healthcare 
coverage, people like Danny Robeson. I 
met Danny when he was 7. He lives in 
Prairie Village, in the district that I 
represent. 
He was born prematurely, has cere-
bral palsy, epilepsy, and a cortical vi-
sion impairment, health conditions 
that surely are considered preexisting 
conditions. Without the protections of 
the ACA, his family fears that they 
would go bankrupt and be unable to get 
Danny the care he needs. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield an additional 15 seconds to the 
gentlewoman. 
Ms. DAVIDS of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, 
during this time of uncertainty, no 
Kansan should have to worry about 
whether they will afford the care that 
they or their families need to stay 
healthy. 
We should build on the progress of 
the ACA, not tear it down. 
I urge my fellow colleagues to sup-
port the amendment introduced by 
Representative UNDERWOOD. 
Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I 
would oppose this amendment, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Minnesota (Ms. CRAIG). 
Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of this amendment. 
Our work to lower healthcare costs 
for working families could not be more 
urgent. I am here to say that we will 
not fund the administration’s attempts 
through litigation to threaten and tear 
down the critical protections of the Af-
fordable Care Act. 
Fifty-one percent of the non-elderly 
in my district in Minnesota have a pre-
existing condition and rely on the 
ACA’s critical protections. If the ACA 
were repealed, 35,000 of my constitu-
ents would lose healthcare coverage. 
To these Minnesotans, the results 
would be life-threatening and finan-
cially devastating. We cannot allow 
that to happen. We need to build on the 
ACA, not tear it down. 
That is exactly why I introduced the 
bipartisan State Health Care Premium 
Reduction Act to lower the costs of 
healthcare for those in the individual 
marketplace, and it is why I am proud 
to support this amendment today. 
I urge my colleagues to join us in 
fighting to preserve and build upon 
healthcare for millions of Americans. 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 45 seconds to the gentlewoman 
from Iowa (Mrs. AXNE). 
Mrs. AXNE. Mr. Speaker, I am so 
pleased to cosponsor this amendment 
today, to ensure that no taxpayer dol-
lars go toward advancing a lawsuit 
that literally threatens the livelihood 
of millions of Americans. 
Mr. Speaker, since 2017, we have seen 
an administration obsessed with under-
mining, sabotaging, and repealing a 
law that protects millions living with 
preexisting conditions in this country. 
As we end another month of a dev-
astating health crisis that has taken 
the lives of 150,000 Americans, they are 
doubling down and insisting—and I 
quote their own words here—‘‘the ACA 
must fall.’’ 
This isn’t only extraordinarily tone- 
deaf. It is playing politics with the 
lives of people in this country, includ-
ing Iowans. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman from Illinois 
has expired. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1067, the pre-
vious

AMENDMENT NO. 149 OFFERED BY MR. WALBERG 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 149 
printed in House Report 116–461. 
Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I have 
an amendment at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
At the end of division B (before the short 
title), insert the following: 
SEC. lll. None of the funds made avail-
able by this Act may be used to carry out 
Order Number 3946-2017 of the Attorney Gen-
eral, issued July 19, 2017. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1067, the gen-
tleman from Michigan (Mr. WALBERG) 
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Michigan. 
Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support 
my 
bipartisan 
amendment, 
which 
would help provide critical protections 
for all Americans and their right to 
due process under the Constitution. 
My amendment would prohibit the 
use of funds for the Department of Jus-
tice to implement its adoptive seizures 
policy. These forfeiture adoptions pro-
vide a loophole that helps law enforce-
ment evade stricter laws governing 
civil asset forfeiture by seizing prop-
erty and transferring it to Federal au-
thorities in exchange for up to 80 per-
cent of future proceeds. 
b 1330 
Now, while I support law enforce-
ment and oppose the ridiculous idea to 
defund law enforcement, for many 
years I have worked in a bipartisan 
way to highlight civil asset forfeiture 
abuses and call for reform to the prac-
tice. And I thank my colleagues, Rep-
resentatives 
RASKIN, 
AMASH, 
RUSH, 
GABBARD, and MCCLINTOCK, for joining 
me on this bipartisan effort today. 
The Department of Justice Assets 
Forfeiture 
Fund 
contains 
proceeds 
from equitable sharing agreements be-
tween the Federal Government and 
local law enforcement. These arrange-
ments create perverse incentives to 
seek out forfeiture opportunities, and 
it is used to circumvent State-en-
acted—like Michigan’s—civil asset for-
feiture reforms. 
In recent years, we have learned of a 
growing number of instances across the 
United States where the government 
has confiscated property from citizens 
and 
small 
businesses 
without 
any 
criminal conviction or any criminal 
charges being brought. Moreover, civil 
forfeiture 
disproportionately 
affects 
minorities and individuals who cannot 
afford to represent themselves. 
Mr. Speaker, current civil forfeiture 
practices are deeply unpopular with 
the public, and there is strong bipar-
tisan support for reform. As such, pro-
ponents for reforming forfeiture prac-
tices include a broad coalition, like the 
ACLU, FreedomWorks, the NAACP, 
and Americans for Prosperity. 
Mr. Speaker, the current civil asset 
forfeiture system is ripe for abuse and 
has 
undermined 
the 
constitutional 
rights of far too many Americans. This 
amendment has already passed the 
House twice by voice vote. I ask my 
colleagues to once again support this 
bipartisan amendment and protect the 
right of due process for all Americans. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent to claim the time 
in opposition, although I do not oppose 
the amendment. 
Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I am 
opposing the amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. As a 
Member in true opposition, the gen-
tleman from Alabama is recognized for 
5 minutes. 
Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to oppose this amendment. 
While I greatly respect the gen-
tleman from Michigan and I know that 
he feels very strongly about this issue, 
this amendment would reverse the July 
2017 order from the Attorney General, 
Jeff Sessions, which included safe-
guards to ensure adoptive seizures that 
are legal and conform to the Depart-
ment of Justice policy. 
Adoptive seizures allow the Federal 
Government to recover funds that are 
proceeds of or connected to Federal 
crimes, but where property happens to 
be discovered by local law enforce-
ment. Moreover, this type of Federal 
and local cooperation fosters impor-
tant collaboration between agents and 
officers. 
We should not return hastily to the 
Obama administration policy but, rath-
er, continue to review carefully the 
practice of forfeiture adoption as part 
of the broader discussion of asset for-
feiture reform. 
Violent crime, gangs, and drug traf-
ficking are a growing and continuing 
problem across this Nation. We should 
not take away from law enforcement a 
tool they need to combat criminal 
groups and to make our streets safer. 
So, again, we would love to work 
with the gentleman on this, but I 
would have to recommend a ‘‘no’’ on 
this amendment. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
as much time as she may consume to 
the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Ms. 
GABBARD). 
Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, I com-
mend my colleague from Michigan for 
his leadership on this very important 
bipartisan issue. 
There should not be much dispute 
around the constitutional basis for the 
need of this change. In plain language, 
civil forfeiture basically allows police 
to seize, keep, or sell any property they 
allege is involved with a crime. Owners 
of that property may never be arrested 
or convicted of a crime, but they will 
see their money or their cars or their 
homes be promptly taken away perma-
nently. 
Now, in 2017, the Department of Jus-
tice expanded civil asset forfeiture, al-
lowing local law enforcement to bypass 
State laws and seize property from peo-
ple with the lowest possible burden of 
evidence, again, regardless of whether 
or not that person was ever convicted 
or even charged with a crime. 
Furthermore, it puts the burden of 
proof on the private citizen to go 
through the bureaucracy and the red 
tape to attempt to reclaim their prop-
erty, which is extremely difficult to do. 
This violates the very principle of our 
justice system: innocent until proven 
guilty. 
It is a violation of the Fifth Amend-
ment, which says: ‘‘No person shall be 
deprived of life, liberty, or property, 
without due process of law; nor shall 
private property be taken for public 
use without just compensation.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, this is a commonsense, 
bipartisan measure. I am proud to 
stand in strong support and urge my 
colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I would just remind my 
colleagues that the current forfeiture 
system is ripe for abuse, and it has un-
dermined the constitutional rights of 
far too many Americans. This amend-
ment has already passed the House 
twice by voice vote. We support it here. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
once again support this bipartisan 
amendment and protect the right of 
due process for all Americans. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. ADERHOLT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I again want to oppose 
this amendment, and I firmly believe 
we should not take away from law en-
forcement a tool that they need to 
combat criminal groups and make our 
streets safer. 
Mr. Speaker, I recommend a ‘‘no’’ 
vote, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1067, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendment offered by the gentleman 
from Michigan (Mr. WALBERG).

The amendment was agreed to. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1067, the gen-
tleman from Indiana (Mr. VISCLOSKY) 
and the gentleman from California (Mr. 
CALVERT) each will control 15 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Indiana. 
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS). 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank Representative MI-
CHAEL BURGESS, who has been my bi-
partisan partner in this effort to affect 
positively those individuals who suffer 
from sickle cell anemia. 
The Davis-Burgess amendment will 
add $2 million to the Centers for Dis-
ease Control’s National Center for 
Birth Defects and Developmental Dis-
abilities’ Public Health Approach to 
Blood Disorders account to fund a sur-
veillance program in sickle cell disease 
and reduce the administration account 
in the Office of the Secretary of Health 
and Human Service’s account by a 
similar amount. 
This same bipartisan amendment was 
offered last year by me, Representative 
BURGESS, Representative BUTTERFIELD, 
and passed a roll call vote of 410–12, 410 
yes, 12 noes. 
I urge passage because what it does is 
set up a separate account for sickle cell 
anemia in the National Institutes of 
Health. It has no bearing on the budg-
et, and I urge passage. 
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no objection to this en bloc amend-
ment. 
I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Ohio (Mr. BALDERSON). 
Mr. BALDERSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of an amendment I of-
fered 
alongside 
Representatives 
CISNEROS, LARSEN, and YOUNG. This 
amendment would increase funding to 
Small Business Development Centers 
by $5 million by fiscal year 2021. 
SBDCs provide a critical resource to 
small 
business 
owners 
and 
entre-
preneurs who use the centers for free 
consulting 
and 
at-cost 
trainings. 
SBDCs have a return on investment of 
over two to one, and last year they 
helped generate $7 billion in new sales. 
It will be even more valuable as our 
small businesses recover from this pan-
demic. 
As a Member of the House Small 
Business Committee, I have seen first-
hand how effective SBDCs can be for 
our Nation’s economic engine. Now, 
more than ever, we need to strengthen 
our support for small business pro-
grams. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
join me in voting ‘‘yes’’ on this amend-
ment and support Main Streets across 
America. 
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. SCOTT), the chair of the 
Committee on Education and Labor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4147 
July 30, 2020 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise in support of my two amend-
ments to H.R. 7617. 
My first amendment is offered with 
Virginia 
Representatives 
WITTMAN, 
LURIA, and BEYER and reflects the need 
to adequately fund the important work 
done at Jefferson Lab. 
JLab conducts primary research in 
subatomic particles, but the $2 million 
included in this year’s bill falls short of 
the $9 million needed to move forward 
with the renovation and expansion to 
JLab, which the Department of Energy 
has already approved. 
I also rise in support of my amend-
ment offered with Virginia Representa-
tives 
WITTMAN, 
MCEACHIN, 
LURIA, 
SPANBERGER, and WEXTON in regard to 
the urgent need for robust funding for 
the U.S. Corps of Engineers for coastal 
construction projects. The Port of Vir-
ginia and the Corps of Engineers have 
already undertaken the dredging, wid-
ening, and deepening of the Norfolk 
Harbor to enable safe and efficient two- 
way passage of the new larger con-
tainer ships. The project will require 
additional funds and a New Start des-
ignation to keep the projected timeline 
intact. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
supporting additional funding to keep 
both of these essential projects moving 
forward and on schedule. 
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. ZELDIN). 
Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the ranking member for yielding. 
I rise today in support of my bipar-
tisan amendment to halt the sale and 
marketing of Plum Island, New York, 
by the General Services Administra-
tion. 
Situated at the gateway of the Long 
Island Sound, Plum Island is treasured 
by our local community in both New 
York and Connecticut. 
Since World War II, Plum Island has 
been utilized as a research laboratory. 
In 2005, the Department of Homeland 
Security, which currently has jurisdic-
tion over the island, announced that 
the Animal Disease Center would be 
moved to a new Federal facility in 
Kansas. 
To offset the cost of this relocation, 
a law was enacted in 2008 that called 
for the sale of Plum Island to the high-
est bidder. 
However, according to a DHS report 
issued in April 2016, the new site in 
Kansas 
is 
already 
fully 
paid 
for 
through a combination of Federal ap-
propriations and funding from the 
State of Kansas. 
The current law is the wrong path 
forward. The better way is to provide 
for public access, permanent preserva-
tion of Plum Island, and continued use 
of the state-of-the-art research infra-
structure. 
That is why I have been working with 
my colleague from Connecticut, Con-
gressman JOE COURTNEY, and a bipar-
tisan coalition of lawmakers from both 
sides of Long Island Sound to repeal 
this flawed mandate. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues’ 
support. 
b 1345 
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Iowa (Mr. LOEBSACK). 
Mr. 
LOEBSACK. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this 
en bloc package, which includes my 
amendment to increase investment of 
distributed wind technologies and re-
search within the Department of Ener-
gy’s Wind Energy Program. 
Distributed wind is the use of typi-
cally smaller wind turbines owned pri-
marily by rural and local entities, such 
as homes, farms, businesses, and public 
facilities to offset all or a portion of 
onsite energy consumption. 
This 
type 
of 
energy 
production 
strengthens American communities by 
helping them become more energy 
independent while lowering costs for 
consumers. 
Distributed 
wind 
also 
strengthens domestic manufacturing, 
and, in fact, American-made wind tur-
bines can be found in well over 100 
countries around the world. 
The funding provided over the past 
few fiscal years has helped unleash dis-
tributed wind power’s vast potential, 
but continued investment is needed to 
support the critical research and devel-
opment that will further reduce costs 
and maximize the benefits of distrib-
uted wind power. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to support this amendment. 
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Missouri 
(Mr. SMITH). 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
I rise today in support of my amend-
ment that requires the Secretary of 
Health and Human Services to coordi-
nate with the heads of the relevant 
agencies to compile a list of critical 
medications the Federal Government 
should ensure are readily available in 
the event of another public health 
emergency. 
In recent decades, the United States 
has become more reliant on foreign 
countries for the production of general 
pharmaceutical drugs. Today, only a 
small portion of generic drugs are pro-
duced in the United States. That is one 
thing that the coronavirus pandemic 
has taught us is that we should not be 
reliant on our adversaries for our ge-
neric drugs. 
Hostile authoritarian regimes like 
the Chinese Communist Party should 
never have the ability to decide the 
drugs that American people have ac-
cess to. We cannot allow China to hold 
American lives in its hands. 
My amendment will ensure we are 
properly informed about our pharma-
ceutical supply chains. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Washington (Mr. HECK). 
Mr. HECK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in support of the en bloc group of 
amendments including mine, bipar-
tisan amendment No. 318, to increase 
funding for the Indian Community De-
velopment Block Grant. 
This is about creating jobs and ad-
dressing housing needs in Indian Coun-
try. 
For far too long, native communities 
have experienced poverty and over-
crowded, dilapidated housing at a rate 
much higher than the rest of the Na-
tion. 
My bipartisan amendment would help 
Tribes address these longstanding chal-
lenges by increasing funding for the In-
dian Community Development Block 
Grant by $5 million. 
Boosting funding for this program is 
a small yet meaningful step to improve 
housing and economic opportunities in 
Indian Country. 
But we can’t stop there. We must 
continue our work to improve housing 
in native communities. 
I 
thank 
Representatives 
YOUNG, 
HAALAND, 
MOORE, 
GABBARD, 
and 
HUFFMAN for cosponsoring this amend-
ment. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge its adoption. 
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from the 
great State of Alaska (Mr. YOUNG). 
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding, and thank 
him for his good work on this bill. 
My amendment supports the impor-
tant Water Power Technologies Office 
in the Department of Energy. 
This office offers grants to deploy hy-
dropower, pumped storage, and marine 
energy projects and related trans-
mission infrastructure in low-income, 
economically distressed, underserved, 
or rural communities. 
Hydropower is clean and produces no 
emissions and uses the energy of run-
ning water without reducing its quan-
tity to produce electricity. 
My State of Alaska has tremendous 
hydropower potential. While Alaska’s 
total energy consumption is among the 
10 lowest States, its per capita energy 
consumption is fourth highest in the 
United States because of our small pop-
ulation, terrain, and geographic param-
eters. 
Mr. Speaker, the cost of electricity 
in Alaska can be twice that of the 
lower 48. 
This increased cost of power in the 
residential sector has significant eco-
nomic impacts on Alaskan families. 
Many communities rely on expensive 
diesel generation for electricity and 
home heating. 
This amendment offers support for 
hydropower projects, provides many 
residents and businesses of Alaska with 
low-cost, renewable, clean power. 
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Hawaii (Ms. GABBARD). 
Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of this en bloc and my amend-
ment that is included in it. 
I am speaking on behalf of our rural 
communities that face many chal-
lenges in making sure that goods and

services are accessible to residents and 
small businesses and that they actu-
ally remain affordable. Communities 
like mine are no different where, in 
many cases, air travel island-by-island 
is the only means of access available. 
For things such as medical appoint-
ments, 
visiting 
family, 
getting 
to 
school, commuting to work or meeting 
local business needs and more, air trav-
el is a lifeline. 
A national one-size-fits-all regula-
tion on Essential Air Service fails to 
acknowledge our unique travel needs 
and geographic realities. 
This amendment extends protections 
for communities in Hawaii and Penn-
sylvania that Congress has long recog-
nized and ensures our rural populations 
maintain access to critical transpor-
tation resources. 
This bipartisan effort eliminates the 
cost-sharing requirement and makes 
sure that our local communities in 
rural areas remain connected. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this 
amendment. 
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Min-
nesota (Mr. STAUBER). 
Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding and for the 
opportunity to offer my crucial amend-
ment that will help the five sovereign 
Chippewa Tribes in my district: The 
Bois Forte Band, the Fond du Lac, the 
Grand Portage, the Leech Lake, and 
the Mille Lacs Band. 
Northern Minnesota Tribes provide 
cultural perspective that enrich and in-
form my policymaking. However, In-
dian Country has endured a crisis un-
like any other. 
Suicide among American Indian and 
Alaska Natives is a devastating epi-
demic impacting the communities in 
my district and across our Nation. 
According to the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, American In-
dians and Alaska Natives have the 
highest rate of suicide of any ethnic 
group in the United States, and it has 
steadily been increasing since 2003. To 
this day, suicide is the second leading 
cause of death among native youth be-
tween the ages of 15 and 24. 
Despite this startling trend, funding 
for Native American suicide prevention 
programs within the Substance Abuse 
and Mental Health Services Adminis-
tration was level funded from last year. 
Level funding is not enough. We need 
these funds to strengthen community- 
driven and informed approaches to re-
duce suicide among native populations. 
Mr. Speaker, my amendment today 
nearly 
doubles 
funding 
for 
Native 
American suicide prevention programs. 
These 
crucial 
resources 
within 
SAMHSA will benefit Native American 
and Alaska Native youth everywhere. 
For example, the renowned Indian 
Health Services facility in Bemidji, 
Minnesota, serves 34 Tribes in the Mid-
west covering my district and well be-
yond. With increased funding from this 
amendment, they would be able to pro-
vide more suicide and mental health 
services and outreach to our commu-
nities. 
Mr. Speaker, before I close, I would 
like to thank my partner in addressing 
this issue, the dean of the House, DON 
YOUNG, from the great State of Alaska. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support for my 
amendment and, in turn, support for 
ending 
the 
longstanding 
and 
dev-
astating epidemic in Indian Country 
that is suicide. 
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Virginia (Ms. SPANBERGER). 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in support of my amendment to ad-
dress current IRS backlogs. 
Over the past few months, I have 
heard from constituents across central 
Virginia who have not yet received 
their recovery rebate checks or their 
2019 Federal tax refunds. 
Congress created the recovery rebate 
program to address the economic crisis 
caused by COVID–19, and as families 
struggle waiting for IRS checks to ar-
rive, we know that the taxpayer cor-
respondence which is necessary to 
process these checks and tax returns is 
currently sitting in trailers and office 
space leased specifically to store the 
backlog of mail. 
This backlog is unacceptable, and 
Congress must take action to make 
clear that this backlog must be ad-
dressed, and we must give IRS the 
tools they need to address it and make 
clear our expectations that they will. 
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. LAMALFA). 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my colleague from southern California 
for yielding. 
I refer back to amendment No. 87 
that would prohibit expenditure funds 
by DOJ for marijuana enforcement 
eradication. 
Now, we have a huge problem in my 
part of northern California, and this 
isn’t just what some may look at as a 
State’s rights issue. This is a problem. 
We have a 50-State standard for FDA 
legalization of drugs, and we are going 
to have a willy-nilly hopscotch way of 
doing things with every State that 
wants to legalize it doing their own 
thing. What it really boils down to is 
this is still in violation of Federal law 
by legalizing marijuana. So we should 
continue to enforce it. 
Empowering States to legalize it 
doesn’t stop illegal drug trafficking. 
Indeed, it just brings it into town. It 
brings it closer and increases illegal 
drug trafficking from my State out to 
other States. 
The cartels get even more nasty 
about this. Drug cartels have moved on 
to our public lands and caused great 
amounts of damage clearcutting trees, 
killing wildlife with their chemicals, 
and trying to keep them away. 
The DEA Cannabis Eradication Pro-
gram found a 60 percent increase in the 
amount of assets seized from raids in 
busting these grows. 
The same year, the Forest Service 
eradicated nearly $1.5 million worth of 
plants, so this is 2016, from 247 sites on 
national forest lands in California 
alone. And those are 4-year-old stats 
because it keeps going up. 
The amount of damage they are 
doing and what it means to nearby 
farmers and ranchers who have a very 
low tolerance for what they are al-
lowed to get away with on their oper-
ations is really unfair. 
Of course, these cartels are very 
heavily armed, and anybody that hap-
pens to go in there hunting or hiking 
or just traipsing around, their life is in 
danger because these people enforce 
very strongly on their grows. 
They plague our forests. Many of my 
colleagues have a bipartisan bill called 
the PLANT Act to help the Federal 
Government and local law enforcement 
address this problem and increase pen-
alties and do a better job of enforcing 
in our forests because they are dam-
aging them. It is dangerous to our com-
munities in those areas. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
the gentleman from California an addi-
tional 30 seconds. 
Mr. LAMALFA. So before we do any-
thing that makes marijuana legaliza-
tion easier or simpler, we must con-
sider the side effects of this legaliza-
tion and looking the other way on en-
forcement of marijuana on our lands. 
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. PANETTA). 
Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 7617 and my 
amendment for funding the Education 
for Homeless Children and Youth Pro-
gram. 
This funding is necessary because 
homelessness 
affects 
students 
all 
across our Nation, including in my dis-
trict on the central coast of California. 
In Monterey County, nearly 10,000 
students meet the formal definition of 
homelessness. More specifically, in Sa-
linas, over 3,500 students are homeless. 
That is 40 percent of the school dis-
trict. 
We can and we must do better. And 
we can start with this bill and my 
amendment that identifies homeless 
youth, funds local liaisons, ensures 
support services, and coordinates with 
the community to meet the basic needs 
of our children. 
Let’s pass this bill with my amend-
ment so that we can give homeless stu-
dents greater support for a more prom-
ising future. 
Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Washington (Ms. SCHRIER). 
Ms. SCHRIER. Mr. Speaker, I am de-
lighted that this amendment address-
ing antibiotic resistance has been in-
cluded in this package. 
While today we are laser focused on 
COVID–19, our next pandemic could be 
a ‘‘super bug.’’

July 30, 2020 
The antibiotics we have relied on for 
years are no match for the drug-resist-
ant bacteria that infect more than 2.8 
million people each year. 
As a pediatrician, I want to make 
sure that in 10 years I will still be able 
to treat my patients’ bacterial infec-
tions like pneumonia, C. diff, menin-
gitis, and abscesses. 
In order to do that we need to curtail 
the current overuse of antibiotics and 
make investments in developing new 
ones now. 
That is why Combating Antibiotic 
Resistant Bacteria, or CARB-X, is so 
important. By funding early phases of 
research for promising new antibiotics, 
this public-private partnership mini-
mizes the risk that discourages invest-
ment in new treatments.

Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. GOTTHEIMER). 
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Madam Speaker, 
I thank Chairman VISCLOSKY for his 
hard work here. 
I rise in support of this en bloc pack-
age, which contains two amendments I 
introduced. 
My first amendment will give all of 
Congress access to weekly updates on 
inventory in our Strategic National 
Stockpile. We all need current infor-
mation on our Nation’s supply chain 
and our inventory of PPE, vaccine ma-
terials, and supplies as we respond to 
this crisis, especially for my district, 
which has been hit so hard in northern 
New Jersey. 
My second amendment prioritizes 
clean drinking water, because every 
child should have access to lead-free 
water at school. 
I am proud my other two amend-
ments were included in other en bloc 
packages to increase investment for 
broadband infrastructure, so we can ad-
dress the challenges facing underserved 
areas, especially as families are work-
ing and learning online. 
My final amendment, which has been 
adopted, supports improving our Na-
tion’s manufacturing supply chain to 
address 
the 
challenges 
caused 
by 
COVID. 
I have worked closely with the New 
Jersey Manufacturing Extension Pro-
gram as we help ensure small and mid- 
size manufacturers in New Jersey have 
the equipment they need. 
Madam Speaker, I urge support for 
this bipartisan en bloc set of amend-
ments. 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from New Jersey (Ms. SHERRILL). 
Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Speaker, 
COVID–19 weighs heavily on our com-
munities. The pandemic has increased 
isolation, anxiety, and economic stress 
for millions of Americans, and we have 
seen a sharp increase in overdoses 
across the country. 
The Overdose Detection Mapping Ap-
plication Program tracks overdoses 
and has documented a 42 percent in-
crease in suspected overdoses compared 
to the data from May 2019. In New Jer-
sey, State health officials say there has 
been a 20 percent increase in overdose 
deaths since May. 
The Mental and Substance Use Dis-
order Workforce Training program is 
critical to ensuring the necessary re-
sources and training for medical prac-
titioners and mental health profes-
sionals. This program makes grants to 
institutions, including medical schools 
and federally-qualified health centers, 
to support training for medical resi-
dents and fellows in psychiatry and ad-
diction medicine, as well as nurse prac-
titioners, 
physician 
assistants, 
and 
others to provide substance use treat-
ment in underserved communities. 
My amendment highlights the crit-
ical nature of these programs, and I ap-
plaud the committee for increasing 
funding for this training to support the 
mental and physical health of Ameri-
cans. 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. ESPAILLAT). 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Chairwoman LOWEY
for more 
than three decades of valuable service 
to our Nation. 
I 
joined 
Congresswoman 
SHEILA 
JACKSON LEE on an amendment that di-
rects NIAID, led by Dr. Anthony Fauci, 
to prioritize minority patient outreach 
and minority candidate inclusion in 
COVID–19 critical clinical trials or 
therapy development. 
I worked with Chairman RA´ UL GRI-
JALVA on an amendment that supports 
English language acquisition grants 
used by school districts and teachers 
that teach English language learners, 
like myself, that sat in the back of a 
classroom for 2 years not knowing 
what was being said. 
I have worked for the past 2 years 
with my colleague JOSE´
SERRANO on 
the 
National 
Science 
Foundation’s 
STEM undergraduate program for His-
panic-serving institutions. 
Finally, Madam Speaker, I am glad 
we included my critical amendment to 
prohibit the Office of Refugee Resettle-
ment from contracting with for-profit 
contractors to house unaccompanied 
alien children. 
That is a private sector money grab 
that benefits from children that are 
split, ripped apart from their parents’ 
arms. 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Michigan (Ms. STEVENS). 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of my amendment on 
drowning prevention in H.R. 7617. 
This 
amendment 
emphasizes 
the 
pressing need to appropriate $5 million 
to the CDC to continue its lifesaving 
work on water safety and drowning 
prevention. 
This amendment is in memory of 
Jacob Sandy, a loving brother and son, 
who drowned off the coast of Lake 
Michigan just over a year ago. 
Jacob graduated from Seaholm High 
School, my alma mater. His young 
adult life was just beginning, and he 
was known for his deep Christian faith, 
his positive outlook, adventurous and 
humorous spirit. 
Now that summer is in full swing, it 
is time for us to ensure that no one has 
to experience the pain suffered by his 
mother, Carol, his brother, Paul, his 
sister, Charlotte, and the countless 
others who loved him. 
There is so much more we can do to 
prevent drownings in America. 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
New Hampshire (Mr. PAPPAS). 
Mr. 
PAPPAS. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
American doctors, scientists, and re-
searchers aren’t alone in racing to 
unlock treatments, vaccines, and other 
lifesaving developments in the fight 
against COVID–19. 
Their counterparts in Israel are mak-
ing groundbreaking advancements as 
well. 
Just days ago, an Israeli study indi-
cated that low levels of vitamin D in-
crease the risk of contracting COVID. 
Israeli scientists are developing six dif-
ferent vaccine candidates and more 
than a dozen different treatment op-
tions for the deadly lung inflammation 
caused by COVID–19. 
That is why I am asking my col-
leagues to support this bipartisan 
amendment which will fund a new part-
nership between the U.S. and Israel to 
bring leading researchers together to 
defeat this devastating disease. 
By passing this amendment, we can 
deepen our expertise in the develop-
ment of drugs, vaccines, AI solutions, 
respiratory assist devices, diagnostic 
tests, telemedicine, and more to help 
save American lives. 
America can’t go it alone in this 
fight. We are stronger when we join 
forces with countries that share our 
values to confront our shared chal-
lenges. 
Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of 
this provision. 
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I 
have no further speakers. I support the 
en bloc amendment, and I urge a ‘‘yes’’ 
vote. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to speak in strong support of En Bloc No. 4, 
to H.R. 7617, the Defense, Commerce, Jus-
tice, Science, Energy and Water Development, 
Financial Services and General Government, 
Labor, Health and Human Services, Edu-
cation, Transportation, Housing, and Urban 
Development Appropriations Act.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4150 
July 30, 2020 
I thank Chairman MCGOVERN and Ranking 
Member COLE for including several amend-
ments in the Rule for House consideration of 
H.R. 7617. 
The Jackson Lee amendments are in the 
following Divisions: 
Division A—Department of Defense; 
Division B—Commerce, Justice, Science; 
Division F—Labor, Health and Human Serv-
ices, and Education; and 
Division G—Transportation, Housing and 
Urban Development. 
Jackson Lee Amendment No. 319, included 
in En Bloc No. 4, increases and decreases the 
National Infrastructure Investments account by 
$2,000,000 to emphasize support for urban bi-
cycle and pedestrian safety programs. 
I wish to thank the Transportation Trades 
Department of the AFL–CIO and for voicing 
support for this Jackson Lee Amendment. 
On March 30, 2019, in the city of Houston, 
at the intersection of North Shepherd Drive 
and West 10th Street located in the 18th Con-
gressional District of Texas, Lesha White, 54, 
was driving with her daughters when she saw 
Jesus ‘‘Jesse’’ Perez struggling to cross the 
intersection in a wheelchair. 
Ms. White pulled over and got out of her car 
to help Mr. Perez cross the street when an-
other vehicle struck them, and they were both 
killed. 
On March 7, 2019, 23-year-old David Leon 
Loya was killed in a collision with a school bus 
while riding his bicycle in The Heights area of 
Houston. 
Police report that Mr. Loya was in the bike 
lane and tried to avoid the accident by sliding 
under the bus, but unfortunately, he was run 
over by the back axle. 
This young man was greatly loved by his 
family, the lives of the people he touched in 
his volunteer work, and the bicyclist commu-
nity. 
I offered the amendment in remembrance of 
Lesha White, Jesus ‘‘Jesse’’ Perez, David 
Leon Loya, and all of the other pedestrians 
and bicyclists who have lost their lives in acci-
dents with motor vehicles in urban areas. 
In the past sixteen years, the Houston area 
has seen 2,000 deaths of bicyclists and pe-
destrians, at an average of 100 a year, with 
the last three years seeing the rate increase to 
150 a year, according to federal statistics. 
In 2017, the most recent year for which 
comprehensive statistics are available, accord-
ing to the Texas Department of Transportation 
(‘‘TDOT’’), the numbers were no more encour-
aging. 
According to TDOT, 1,409 Houston-area pe-
destrians were injured in roadways crashes: 
275 of them were injured seriously; 
146 pedestrians were killed in roadways 
crashes; 
639 bicyclists were injured in roadways 
crashes; and 
82 bicyclists were injured seriously. 
The National Highway Traffic Safety Admin-
istration has called the number of deaths a 
‘‘public health crisis.’’ 
The problem is no more encouraging on the 
national level as Texas ranks third nationwide 
in bicycle deaths, behind California and Flor-
ida. 
Nationwide, the number of fatal bicyclist ac-
cidents is rising and are also amounting to a 
greater percentage of total traffic fatalities. 
Cities are uniquely susceptible to this prob-
lem, as the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration reports that 70 percent of bicy-
cle fatalities occur in cities. 
I offered this amendment that was included 
in the FY 2020 Transportation Appropriations 
bill that is law today because funding is need-
ed to make changes to the intersections to im-
prove pedestrian and bicyclists safety. 
We must come together to tackle this prob-
lem and work to ensure that we stem the tide 
in these fatalities. 
The rising death and injury toll of pedestrian 
and bicyclists is alarming and merits serious 
attention but as we know too tragically, behind 
the statistics are stories about people who are 
treasured and sorely missed by family, friends, 
and coworkers. 
Jackson Lee Amendment No. 251, included 
in En Bloc No. 4, increases and decreases 
funds by $10,000,000 increase in funding to 
support greater diversity in the pool of diabe-
tes research professionals and patients partici-
pating in clinical trials. 
Diversity in medical trials is essential to en-
suring that cures, especially vaccines, and 
therapies work for the greatest number of per-
sons impacted by an illness. 
34.2 million people, or 10.5 percent of the 
U.S. population, have diabetes. An estimated 
26.8 million people—or 10.2 percent of the 
population—have been diagnosed with diabe-
tes. Approximately 7.3 million people have dia-
betes but have not yet been diagnosed 
(2018). 
Diabetes impacts all social, economic, and 
ethnic backgrounds. 
Type 1 diabetes accounts for about 5.2 per-
cent of all diagnosed cases of diabetes, affect-
ing approximately 1.6 million people. 
African American adults are 60 percent 
more likely than non-Hispanic white adults to 
have been diagnosed with diabetes by a phy-
sician. 
In 2016, non-Hispanic blacks were 3.5 times 
more likely to be diagnosed with end stage 
renal disease as compared to non-Hispanic 
whites. 
In 2016, non-Hispanic blacks were 2.3 times 
more likely to be hospitalized for lower limb 
amputations as compared to non-Hispanic 
whites. 
In 2017, African Americans were twice as 
likely as non-Hispanic whites to die from dia-
betes. 
This Jackson Lee Amendment focuses ef-
forts on addressing lower participation rates of 
African Americans with diabetes in clinical 
trials that test treatments and therapies. 
I thank those who are instrumental in setting 
up clinical trials of the COVID–19 vaccine for 
focuses on increasing African American and 
Hispanic participation in the trial involving tens 
of thousands of Americans across the nation. 
This work, like what is proposed by this 
Jackson Lee amendment, is intended to make 
cures as effective as possible for the greatest 
number of persons. 
I am pleased to cosponsor Congressman 
ESPAILLAT’s Amendment No. 236 included in 
En Bloc No. 4 to provide the increases and 
decreases by $10,000,000 to support greater 
minority patient outreach and minority can-
didate inclusion by the National Institute of Al-
lergy and Infectious Diseases in clinical trial 
participation for any vaccine or therapeutics to 
treat the novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID–19). 
Jackson Lee Amendment No. 252, included 
in En Bloc No. 4, increases and decreases 
funds by $10,000,000 with the intent of sup-
porting programs that provide outreach and 
support services targeting program partici-
pants at greatest risk of not completing a col-
lege degree due to COVID–19 education dis-
ruption. 
I urge my fellow members to vote in favor 
of En Bloc No. 4 and support these Jackson 
Lee Amendments.

BARRAGA´ N). Pursuant to House Resolu-
tion 1067, the previous question is or-

322, 323, 327, 331, 332, and 339, printed in 
part B of House Report 116–461, offered 
by Mr. VISCLOSKY of Indiana: 
Mr. LUJA´ N. Madam Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of my amendment to support Comprehen-
sive Opioid Recovery Centers. 
Our country and my home state of New 
Mexico have made progress in addressing the 
opioid crisis, but the United States is still fall-
ing far short of ensuring that everyone strug-
gling with a substance use disorder can ac-
cess the treatment they need. Recovery is not 
a one-size-fits-all approach—it needs to be tai-
lored to each person’s unique needs. 
In 2018, Congress passed the overwhelm-
ingly bipartisan SUPPORT for Patients and 
Communities Act. This legislation included 
new grants for Comprehensive Opioid Recov-
ery Centers—facilities that provide the full con-
tinuum of treatment services, including all 
FDA-approved methods of medication assisted 
treatment, peer support, and wrap-around 
services for families. These Centers can help 
us identify what works and develop best prac-
tices to improve treatment everywhere. 
Last year, Congress provided $2 million for 
the first round of funding for two Centers, 
which will be awarded this fall. My amendment 
increases funding to $10 million, the full 
amount authorized by the SUPPORT Act, to 
fund 10 Centers to serve some of the hardest- 
hit communities and build the evidence need-
ed to improve treatment across the country. 
Thank you to Mr. GUTHRIE and Mr. PAPPAS 
for joining me on this amendment, and I urge 
my colleagues to vote YES. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, every day Americans com-
municate with loved ones, receive medication, 
and during this pandemic, millions more than 
usual will vote all by mail. 
Yet drastic, negative changes are being 
made by new Postal Service leadership.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4151 
July 30, 2020 
Mail is being delivered later than normal, 
overtime is being eliminated, and carriers are 
being told to leave mail at distribution centers. 
The Administration’s new Postmaster Gen-
eral is treating the Postal Service like a com-
pany, not a constitutionally mandated service 
for all Americans. 
My amendment would stop the Postal Serv-
ice from implementing new standards that will 
result in later mail delivery and worse service. 
Now more than ever it is critical that the 
Postal Service continue to perform its mission 
without having to worry about cutting corners 
to cut costs. 
I urge my colleagues to support this amend-
ment. 
Mr. WEBER of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of my amendment, which em-
phasizes the need to provide adequate fund-
ing for construction of the Department of En-
ergy (DOE)’s Versatile Neutron Source or 
Versatile Test Reactor. 
The Versatile Test Reactor is a critical piece 
of DOE R&D infrastructure that will allow U.S. 
nuclear researchers to test and validate a 
wide range of advanced nuclear reactor de-
signs on U.S. soil. Any responsible U.S. nu-
clear energy strategy must include robust sup-
port for this user facility. 
Last Congress, my bill, the Nuclear Energy 
Innovation Capabilities Act (NEICA), was the 
first step towards making this DOE user facility 
a reality. To build on the success of NEICA, 
the central piece of my nuclear legislation this 
Congress, H.R. 6796, the Nuclear Energy for 
the Future Act, is the authorization of full fund-
ing for this necessary work. 
That’s why I am very concerned to see that 
the 2021 appropriations bill provides less than 
a quarter of the funds needed to keep the 
Versatile Test Reactor project on budget and 
on schedule. If we are serious about our clean 
energy future and if we want to decrease our 
dependence on competitors like China and 
Russia for advanced nuclear R&D, we must 
continue to strengthen our advanced nuclear 
energy industry by prioritizing our investment 
in essential research infrastructure. 
The United States should lead the world in 
advanced nuclear research and development. 
I believe that this amendment identifies one of 
the fundamental and immediate needs of the 
U.S. nuclear industry and provides a strong 
commitment to addressing it. Moving forward, 
I will continue to work with my colleagues to 
prioritize fundamental research that will sup-
port nuclear innovation and keep America 
safe, independent, and globally competitive. 
I urge my colleagues to support this amend-
ment. 
Ms. WEXTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in support of my amendment No. 340 in En 
Bloc 4 to provide $9 million to the Federal 
Aviation Administration (FAA) to continue its 
work developing the remote tower pilot pro-
gram. 
The remote tower pilot program is a simple 
and cost-effective way to provide air traffic 
control services to an airport from any loca-
tion. Remote towers use a network of high- 
definition cameras and sensors to feed real- 
time information to air traffic controllers, who 
can be located at the airport or at a separate 
remote tower center. Remote tower infrastruc-
ture is cheaper, more flexible, and requires 
less extensive maintenance and upkeep than 
manned air traffic control towers, allowing the 
FAA and airports to address their air traffic 
control needs more cheaply. Remote towers 
also provide controllers with additional capa-
bilities, including night vision with infrared 
cameras, enhanced visibility in poor weather 
or low light conditions, views of high-traffic 
areas or blind spots, moving object tracking, 
and real-time data overlays. 
I am very pleased that the first remote tower 
in the U.S. is currently being tested at Lees-
burg Executive Airport in Virginia’s 10th Con-
gressional District. Launched in 2014, remote 
tower technology has provided Leesburg with 
air traffic control capabilities without having to 
construct a manned air traffic control tower. 
These capabilities support Leesburg’s more 
than 100,000 annual operations in highly com-
plex airspace due to the airport’s proximity to 
Dulles International Airport. 
The remote tower pilot program at Leesburg 
has been a great success, and my amend-
ment will ensure that the FAA can continue 
this work at Leesburg and at new pilot sites 
around the country to further develop these 
important technologies. I thank the Committee 
for the inclusion of this amendment, and I urge 
my colleagues to support it. 
Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of my 
amendment to H.R. 7617, Division F—of the 
Defense, Commerce, Justice, Science, Energy 
and Water Development, Financial Services 
and General Government, Homeland Security, 
Labor, Health and Human Services, Edu-
cation, Transportation, Housing, and Urban 
Development Appropriations Act of 2021. My 
amendment, included in the bipartisan en bloc, 
will increase funding for the Institute of Mu-
seum and Library Services account by $10 
million to support technological advancements 
in libraries. This amendment highlights the 
need for technology, like Wi-Fi and computers, 
in libraries, especially in communities that are 
economically 
distressed. 
With 
uncertainty 
around school openings in the fall, many stu-
dents may not have the technology or internet 
available at home to succeed. Libraries are a 
great place to offer these types of free com-
munity services in a safe environment. My 
amendment would support the bolstering of 
these resources. I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this legislation. 
Mr. 
SWALWELL 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise in support of my amendment, 
number 187 and part of en bloc package num-
ber four, which would direct the Department of 
Energy (DOE) to continue spending $10 mil-
lion on the Hazardous Waste Operations and 
Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) worker 
training program in fiscal year 2021. 
HAZWOPER is implemented by the National 
Institute of Environmental Health Sciences 
(NIEHS). Through grants to outside organiza-
tions and labor groups, NIEHS is able to pro-
vide training for both communities near DOE 
sites and workers at such locations in haz-
ardous waste and material clean up as well as 
emergency response in the event of a haz-
ardous material release. 
Many different categories of worker receive 
this preparation; some examples include car-
penters, firefighters, machinists, and truck driv-
ers. Their training can involve dealing with 
site-specific issues, such as superfund loca-
tions, job-specific challenges, and dangerous 
substances, including radiological materials, 
lead, and asbestos. 
Since the program started in 1993, over 
622,000 workers have received a total of more 
than eight million hours of training at dozens 
of sites around the country. One of those sites 
is in my congressional district, at Lawrence 
Livermore National Laboratory. 
HAZWOPER thus helps protect staff, work 
sites, and communities from hazardous mate-
rials and emergency situations involving DOE 
operations. It is a vital program that should be 
continued. 
I 
urge 
all 
Members 
to 
support 
my 
amendment.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1067, the gen-
tleman from Indiana (Mr. VISCLOSKY) 
and the gentleman from Florida (Mr. 
DIAZ-BALART) each will control 15 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Indiana. 
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Michigan (Mr. LEVIN). 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding the time. 
I rise in support of this en bloc pack-
age, which includes three of my amend-
ments. 
My first amendment prioritizes fund-
ing to support labor reforms in Mexico 
that will improve Mexican and U.S. 
workers’ standards of living so the 
USMCA can fulfill its promise. 
The second prioritizes BUILD grant 
funding 
for 
green 
infrastructure 
projects that will decarbonize and elec-
trify U.S. ground transportation. 
My final amendment prohibits Sec-
retary DeVos from funneling public 
school 
money 
to 
private 
schools 
through so-called Education Freedom 
Scholarships. 
These amendments protect workers, 
promote investments in green infra-
structure, and safeguard public edu-
cation. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the chair 
for considering them and I urge my col-
leagues to support this package. 
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Speaker, 
I yield such time as he may consume to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Alaska 
(Mr. 
YOUNG), the dean of the House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States. 
Mr. 
YOUNG. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the ranking member, my good 
friend, for yielding to me. 
You know, the legislation we have 
been talking about has a lot of good 
merits, but I was on the floor last week 
talking about the mice that get into a 
good bill and destroy it by leaving res-
idue behind. It appears to me now that 
there is a rat in this bill that is leaving 
a lot more behind. 
I am talking about an amendment 
that is offered on the Pebble Mine that 
hijacks due process and the scientific 
process that the sponsors of this 
amendment claim to hold so near and 
dear to their hearts. 
The Clean Water Act and the Na-
tional 
Environmental 
Policy 
Act, 
NEPA, 
are 
bedrock 
environmental 
statutes and they should not be pre-
empted or short-circuited when it is 
convenient for groups on either side of 
the issue. 
The sponsors of this amendment 
claim the administration is unraveling 
NEPA, but it is this amendment that 
would stymie the process, and it is dis-
ingenuous to want it both ways. 
If groups on the other side want to 
indict the process, then we can have a 
debate about the environmental review 
process in this country, but to change 
the rules in the middle of the game is 
not fair nor right, especially if it comes 
from one State to another State. 
The Federal permitting process is 
nearing completion, and I will respect 
the end result. I don’t know what the 
result will be. 
As the Congressman for all Alaska, 
again, I am offended—all Members 
should be too—when another Congress-
man gets involved in my State or my 
district. 
That is wrong. This is the House of 
Representatives. It is not the House of 
the Federal Government. 
The House of Representatives speaks 
for their people, especially when it 
comes to States rights. 
The people of Alaska have a right to 
have this decided by the book and free 
from interference by parties outside 
the State that seek to impose their 
wills or philosophies on the State and 
the people. 
So, again, Madam Speaker, I want to 
remind my majority leaders: Let’s stop 
this rat infestation. Let’s keep this 
pure. Let’s be about appropriations. 
Let’s keep this in mind as we go 
through this process. 
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. MCNERNEY). 
Mr. MCNERNEY. Madam Speaker, 
first I want to thank the chair and the 
ranking member for their hard work in 
considering all these amendments. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
my 
amendment 
would increase and decrease by $15 mil-
lion DOE’s Energy Information Admin-
istration budget to stimulate more ro-
bust data collection and analysis from 
their commercial and residential sur-
veys, specifically with regards to water 
consumption, as well as to make water 
consumption 
data 
for 
commercial 
buildings available to the public, bro-
ken down by principal building activity 
and by region. 
Our energy and water systems are 
interdependent. 
As water scarcity, availability, and 
uncertainty become more prominent, 
the U.S. energy system risks exposure 
to potential associated vulnerabilities. 
Therefore, it is time for a more inte-
grated approach to address the chal-
lenges and opportunity of the energy- 
water nexus. 
My amendment aims to assist us in 
that process by encouraging the EIA to 
modify and improve their existing data 
collection and analysis programs, ena-
bling us to better collect and utilize 
energy-water data. 
I urge adoption of this amendment. 
b 1415 
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Michigan (Ms. SLOTKIN). 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, on 
this, the funeral day of the great John 
Lewis, I ask my colleagues to support 
my amendment to fund a critical 
source of knowledge for my State, 
‘‘The State of Black Michigan’’ report. 
This amendment comes directly from 
my meetings with African-American 
leaders in my district in the wake of 
the killing of George Floyd. 
For four decades, researchers at 
Michigan State University compiled 
‘‘The State of Black Michigan’’ report. 
This critical research project was es-
tablished in the wake of civil unrest in 
the 1960s, and until 2007, it did what all 
good research does: it used hard data 
and facts, regardless of politics, to in-
form and hold elected leaders account-
able for the persistent inequality in 
housing, healthcare, education, eco-
nomic opportunity, and more.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4164 
July 30, 2020 
The work to produce ‘‘The State of 
Black Michigan’’ was spearheaded by 
Dr. Joe Darden at Michigan State. It 
was not easy or cheap, and since 2007, 
without a source of dedicated funding, 
we have been without the knowledge of 
this report. 
Madam Speaker, now, as the country 
once again confronts systemic racism 
and inequality, we must acknowledge 
and learn from the underlying facts to 
build effective policies. My amendment 
would provide a source of funding for 
efforts such as ‘‘The State of Black 
Michigan’’ so that we can confront sys-
temic inequalities and actually do 
something about these systemic prob-
lems. 
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Washington (Ms. SCHRIER). 
Ms. SCHRIER. Madam Speaker, re-
searchers across the globe are working 
on vaccines to protect us from COVID– 
19, and once rigorous studies are com-
plete, we will be able to roll this out to 
the public and provide protection from 
this dreadful disease. 
But we need to be doing work now to 
build public trust and vaccine safety 
and understand concerns within spe-
cific communities. In order to do that, 
we need data on vaccine confidence and 
access broken down by race, ethnicity, 
geography, and age. 
Just this week, we have seen a 
prominent example of bad actors who 
willfully undermine science, peddle 
conspiracy theories, and intentionally 
spread misinformation. 
This won’t be the last time. It is 
going to be hard to counter sophisti-
cated efforts to sow doubt in vaccine 
evidence, efficacy, and safety, and we 
must reckon with this country’s legacy 
of unconscionable treatment of people 
of color. 
My amendment ensures that we will 
get reliable information to the Amer-
ican people because a safe and effective 
vaccine is only helpful if people are 
confident in it and willing to take it. 
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. NORCROSS). 
Mr. NORCROSS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the Member for yielding and in-
cluding my two amendments in this 
package. 
My first amendment directs OSHA to 
implement an emergency temporary 
standard to protect employees, employ-
ers, and customers from COVID–19. 
In these chaotic times, standards will 
provide that predictability we need. 
Without these enforceable standards, 
we can’t take that responsibility to re-
open in a safe and effective way. 
My second amendment: Health and 
Human Services must create com-
prehensive national testing and tracing 
for childcare centers. Essential em-
ployees are hard at work. Millions 
want to get back to work. Yet, 
childcare providers can’t do the job 
they need to do to be safe. 
A national testing strategy and con-
tact tracing standard will help safely 
reopen these childcare centers. It is 
what our economy needs. It is what our 
kids need and, certainly, what our par-
ents need. 
I urge my colleagues to support these 
amendments, and I thank the chair-
man, once again, for his years of serv-
ice. 
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from New York (Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ.) 
Ms. 
OCASIO-CORTEZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, I would like to thank the 
chairman for including my two amend-
ments here regarding housing discrimi-
nation. 
Yesterday, the President had tweeted 
that he was ‘‘happy to inform all of the 
people living their suburban lifestyle 
dream that you will no longer be both-
ered or financially hurt by having low- 
income housing built in your neighbor-
hood.’’ 
Now, this is classic, textbook dis-
crimination. And we are here to rise to 
say: Uh-uh. This is not going to happen 
on our watch and that our Nation is 
strengthened and exemplified by diver-
sity of class, race, and all backgrounds 
when it comes to housing; that HUD 
and the Department of Housing has an 
affirmative responsibility to not just 
prevent discrimination but to actively 
dismantle years and decades of ac-
tively racist and discriminatory policy. 
That is our responsibility, and we 
have a responsibility to block that dis-
criminatory policy wherever we see it. 
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. CORREA). 
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. I am 
proud to support the Trahan-Correa 
amendment. 
Our most precious gifts that we have 
in life are our children. As parents, 
nothing is more important than the 
well-being of our children. 
Today, parents across the country 
are very concerned about their chil-
dren’s health, as they should be. Par-
ents across this country are also con-
cerned about their children’s education 
and how to move forward. 
Parents and local school boards, 
elected by the local voters, are in the 
best position to make the decisions on 
when to open those schools, and under 
what circumstances, not Washington 
bureaucrats. 
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER). 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, 
I am proud to join my friend, Ms. 
OCASIO-CORTEZ’ leadership and partner-
ship stopping the Trump administra-
tion’s reckless attack on fair housing. 
For a century, housing discrimina-
tion against Black Americans and peo-
ple of color was rampant. They were 
shut out of programs. It has been a 
struggle to be able to engage in fair 
housing practices. 
The Obama administration reversed 
this disparate treatment by strength-
ening the Fair Housing Act. But the 
current occupant of the White House 
has, instead, rescinded the rule with 
his thinly veiled racist tweet sug-
gesting that individuals in suburbs will 
no longer have to be ‘‘bothered or fi-
nancially hurt by having low-income 
housing built in their neighborhoods.’’ 
This continues a pattern for over a 
century, one of the reasons that people 
of color have been denied housing op-
portunities and an escalator to the 
middle class. 
We ought to approve this amend-
ment, push back, and recommit our-
selves on the day that we lay our 
friend, John Lewis, to rest that we rec-
ognize his commitment to fair housing. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President. 
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, I 
ask for support of the amendment, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Speaker, 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCHENERY. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
strong 
opposition 
to 
the 
Pascrell/Kaptur 
amendment that would increase funding to the 
United States Postal Service to carry out a 
pilot program for postal banking. 
In 2018, President Donald Trump created a 
special task force to specifically review the 
Post Office and necessary reforms. The 
Treasury Department was directed to release 
the Task Force’s recommendations, which it 
did in its report, ‘‘United States Postal Service: 
A Sustainable Path Forward.’’ 
In its report, the Task Force was clear: 
‘‘given the USPS’s narrow expertise and cap-
ital limitations, USPS should not pursue ex-
panding into new sectors, such as postal 
banking, the USPS does not have a dem-
onstrated competency or comparative advan-
tage, or where balance sheet risk would be 
added.’’ 
The Post Office agreed. In response to a 
widely criticized and highly unusual report by 
the United States Postal Service Office of In-
spector General (OIG), the Post Office made 
clear that despite any recommendations to the 
contrary from the OIG, the Post Office core 
mission ‘‘is delivery, not banking.’’ 
The 
Government 
Accountability 
Office 
(GAO) agreed. In March, the GAO released a 
report finding that new, non-postal services 
like postal banking may have limited viability. 
Based on interviews the GAO conducted with 
the USPS officials, postmasters, postal em-
ployees, and consumer groups, GAO cau-
tioned that postal banking may ‘‘generate mini-
mal revenue and [the] USPS may face factors 
limiting the viability of these offerings.’’ 
The Task Force said no. The Post Office 
said no. The GAO cautioned against it. Yet 
there are some in Congress who seemingly 
have put blinders on the overwhelming exper-
tise of those who say this is a bad idea. 
The cost of this willful blindness is at the ex-
pense of community banks and small financial 
institutions. Since Dodd-Frank, community fi-
nancial institutions have struggled with the 
regulatory burdens and compliance regimes 
that are now required to provide basic finan-
cial services to more Americans. Allowing the 
federal government to go into banking via the 
Post Office might well be more than these fi-
nancial institutions can bear.

July 30, 2020 
In short, postal banking is a bad idea. And 
one that I have fought over the years and will 
continue to fight as needed going forward. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to speak in strong support of En Bloc No. 5, 
to H.R. 7617, the Defense, Commerce, Jus-
tice, Science, Energy and Water Development, 
Financial Services and General Government, 
Labor, Health and Human Services, Edu-
cation, Transportation, Housing, and Urban 
Development Appropriations Act. 
I thank Chairman MCGOVERN and Ranking 
Member COLE for including several amend-
ments in the rule for House consideration of 
H.R. 7617. 
The Jackson Lee amendments are in the 
following Divisions: 
Division A—Department of Defense; 
Division B—Commerce, Justice, Science; 
Division F—Labor, Health and Human Serv-
ices, and Education; and 
Division G—Transportation, Housing and 
Urban Development. 
The Jackson Lee Amendments made in 
order for Division G provide funding for Fiscal 
Year 2021 Transportation, Housing and Urban 
Development and exemplify the House of 
Representatives’ commitment to making real 
policy change and upholding Black Lives. 
Three Jackson Lee amendments to this Di-
vision are complementary because they pro-
tect the history and culture of Black Lives from 
our past into our present by protecting areas 
that are cited in Public Law 116–111, which 
enacts H.R. 434, the National Emancipation 
Historic Trail Study Act. 
The Emancipation National Historic Trail Act 
would pave the way for the establishment of 
only the second nationally recognized historic 
trail that chronicles the experience of African 
Americans in their struggle for equality and 
justice. 
H.R. 434, the Emancipation National Histor-
ical Trail Act, designates the 51 miles from the 
historic Osterman Building and Reedy Chapel 
in Galveston, Texas, along Highway 3 and I– 
45, north to Freedmen’s Town and Emanci-
pation Park in Houston, Texas as a national 
historic trail. 
The key amendments to Division G of H.R. 
7617, are: Jackson Lee Amendments No. 320, 
No. 321, and No. 323, which are included in 
En Bloc No. 5. 
Jackson Lee Amendment No. 320, included 
in En Bloc No. 5, prohibits the Department of 
Transportation from using funds for Section 
106 Transportation construction projects in 
urban areas that have not been determined to 
meet the statutory and fiduciary obligations of 
the National Historic Preservation Act. 
Jackson Lee Amendment No. 322, included 
in En Bloc No. 5, provides $1,000,000 in as-
sistance to address challenges faced by com-
munities impacted by persistent poverty and 
are not included in decision making when 
major highway construction threatens their 
homes, businesses, and culturally significant 
structures. 
These two amendments make a statement 
in support of preserving the history of Black 
Lives, because this history matters. 
Through these lives, a nation was forged 
out of what should have taken hundreds of 
years for America to rival Europe in economic 
might, 
industrial 
capacity, 
and 
military 
strength, it took less than a hundred because 
of forced labor worked beyond human capac-
ity, compassion, or decency under a system of 
chattel slavery, which was more cruel than 
any conceived form of forced involuntary labor 
prior to what was created in the United States. 
Some may ask, why do we need an H.R. 
40, the Commission to Study and Develop 
Reparation Proposals for African-Americans 
Act, it is because we have not, as a nation nor 
as a people, gotten to the truth about what 
chattel slavery was, why those who created it 
thought it was necessary, and what steps 
were taken to poison every institution known 
to mankind to accept it as natural, normal and 
in many records as ‘‘compassionate’’. 
Until we understand what was done, why it 
was done, and how it was achieved, there is 
no method to chart a course out of it, to get 
beyond its influence, to fully eradiate it from 
our minds, institutions, and way of life. 
One of the vestiges of slavery is how gov-
ernment entities treat African Americans’ right 
to own property—a home is the single great-
est source of wealth for black people living 
within the United States. 
Achieving homeownership is celebrated and 
the home becomes a source of stability for the 
family over multiple generations. 
Stable communities led to the establishment 
of places of worship, businesses, as well as 
social and cultural centers of life within resi-
dential areas. 
One of these historic communities is Inde-
pendence Heights, which began in the 1900s, 
a time in which African Americans faced enor-
mous difficulties securing property and estab-
lishing a place to live in the South. 
Having faith in the message of self-deter-
mination advocated by Booker T. Washington, 
the early pioneers of Independence Heights 
secured property from the Wright Land Com-
pany, set up their own system of governance, 
and became the first town incorporated by Af-
rican Americans in Texas in 1915. 
Annexed by the City of Houston in 1929, 
Independence Heights remains a community 
that reflects and cherishes its values, accom-
plishments, and history to this day. 
This area and others cited in Public Law 
116–111 are under threat from the Texas De-
partment of Transportation starting after World 
War II, when major highway construction was 
invoked nationally, and has continued to the 
present day. 
For more than 14 years, Texas Department 
of Transportation (TxDOT) has been planning 
the North Houston Highway Improvement 
Project (NHHIP), a massive expansion of 
Interstate 45 that will completely reshape free-
way transit around downtown Houston, with 
major changes to I–45, I–69, I–10 and Hwy 
288 over the next decade. 
These changes will threaten the Near 
Northside of Houston, taking way the Leonel 
Castillo Community Center and Greater New 
Hope Missionary Baptist Church along with 
seven other historic churches in Independence 
Heights. 
The proposed expansion of I–45 north of 
downtown to Beltway 8 will result in impacts to 
neighborhoods along either side of I–45 North, 
as hundreds of residents face displacement. 
Located just northwest of the intersection of 
I–610 and I–45, the historic neighborhood of 
Independence Heights is one of those neigh-
borhoods facing said impacts. 
Unfortunately, in 2019 when TxDOT made 
public its report on the Project’s expected im-
pacts to historical resources required under 
the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), 
the agency completely left Independence 
Heights out of its survey. 
Independence Heights is listed in the Na-
tional Register of Historic Places as the first 
state chartered community of former slaves 
and is a destination site on state historic herit-
age trails such as the Texas Independence 
Trail and holds the distinction as the first town 
incorporated by African Americans in the state 
of Texas. 
After World War II, the construction of the I– 
45 and 610 Loop isolated Independence 
Heights from the rest of the city of Houston. 
Starting after World War II, the push to build 
highways accelerated and the brunt of the 
pain for this growth was felt by black and 
brown communities not just in Texas but ev-
erywhere massive projects were undertaken. 
Once again, I–45 has planned major recon-
struction that could impact communities of 
color, including historic black neighborhoods 
like Independence Heights and the Fifth Ward, 
as plans call for demolishing homes and busi-
nesses to accommodate more roadway space. 
TxDoT has not been kind to Independence 
Heights or other communities around the net-
work of freeways and interchanges in the 
downtown area. 
Over the decades, these same areas have 
lost hundreds of homes, businesses and his-
toric places to massive rebuilds and new con-
struction has taken hundreds of homes and 
historic sites from Independence Heights. 
TxDOT’s plans for the I–45 massive rebuild 
seem to have relied on previous policies of the 
past I–610 freeway construction for the current 
plan to take neighborhood property. 
Today, the world has changed—and the 
faith of historic places and the community that 
cherishes them can take comfort in knowing 
that H.R. 434, the ‘‘Emancipation National His-
toric Trail Study Act,’’ became Public Law 
116–111 on January 27, 2020. 
The ambition of taking on the effort of build-
ing a national historic trial was made possible 
by the dedication and hard work of local his-
toric preservationists who tell the story of the 
African American experience. 
Jackson Lee Amendment No. 323, included 
in En Bloc No. 5, increases by $1,000,000 the 
Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity 
to address the fairness in the use of Commu-
nity Development Block Grant Disaster funding 
to repair or replace single family homes dam-
aged during Hurricane Harvey to ensure that 
multigenerational homes can house the family 
at documented predisaster capacity. 
This amendment addresses the unfair action 
taken to diminish the quality of repairs or re-
placement of homes damaged by Hurricane 
Harvey. 
The law providing the final supplement for 
disaster recovery for Hurricanes Harvey and 
Maria disaster housing recovery provisions of 
the bill allowed local jurisdictions to be in con-
trol over recovery or repair of single and multi- 
family housing. 
The City of Houston applied for and was 
awarded the grant to replace or repair single 
and multi-family housing for city residents. 
The state of Texas General Land Office is 
attempting to take back the grant and replace 
the city’s plan to repair or replace housing with 
a plan to only repair two bedrooms no matter 
how many the home had at the time of the 
storm’s damage. 
The City of Houston strongly opposes the 
Texas General Land Office’s (‘‘GLO’’) proposal

to eliminate all City-administered CDBG–DR 
17 program funding for several reasons. 
First, the City’s programs are successful 
and on schedule. For example, even though 
the City is only 1.5 years into its grant: $446 
million (35 percent) of total funds allocated to 
the City has already been designated for the 
specific properties or projects at which the as-
sistance is to be used. $153 million (12 per-
cent) is already under a signed contract that 
obligates its use to deliver recovery services, 
with more contracts being signed on a weekly 
basis. 
The City’s Single-Family programs have al-
ready fully served 234 homeowners, with an-
other 246 families submitted to or approved by 
GLO and currently being served. 
At the current pace, the City will serve 1000 
families for each of the next 4 years before 
the end of the contract, for an estimated total 
served of 4,480 families. 
Second, the City’s programs are better and 
more appropriate for the citizens of the City 
than those the GLO has implemented. 
As intended by the U.S. Department of 
Housing and Urban Development (‘‘HUD’’), the 
City’s programs are serving the most vulner-
able families first. 
This prioritization addresses systemic racial 
inequalities that have regularly occurred in 
prior disaster recovery efforts, including the 
disaster recovery programs previously over-
seen by the State. 
Specifically, the City has adjusted its ap-
proach to ensure Houston’s most vulnerable 
residents are not left behind because of regu-
latory or bureaucratic barriers erected by the 
State or any other entity. 
This number does not include contracts for 
third-party vendors. 
The City’s multifamily program will create 
units that are affordable for more than twice 
as long the State’s program, will serve far 
more very low income families than the State’s 
program, and is attracting seven times the 
amount of funding leverage (a requirement of 
the CDBG–DR 17 program) as compared to 
the State’s program. 
The City’s program provides more recovery 
choices to Hurricane Harvey-impacted renters 
allowing them to use recovery funds to be-
come homeowners. The State’s program does 
not provide this option. 
The third reason the city of Houston is op-
posing the GLO’s proposed amendment to the 
grant award is because it violates the terms of 
its subrecipient agreement, GLO Contract No. 
19–147–001–B489, as amended, with the City 
(the ‘‘Contract’’). 
Section 2.03 of the Contract provides that 
amendments to increase or decrease the 
amount of the subaward must be made by 
written agreement of the parties and the City 
has not consented to any reduction in its 
subaward. 
Funding under the Contract has not been 
reduced or terminated. 
The City is performing under the terms of 
the Contract and has not defaulted under the 
Contract. 
Finally, the GLO has demonstrated that it 
has a difficult time complying with HUD re-
quirements and with establishing and commu-
nicating its own bureaucratic and confusing re-
quirements to the City. 
Two years ago, as it was drafting its own 
plan for the $5 billion recovery funds, the GLO 
failed to provide appropriate community en-
gagement in Houston and Harris County, juris-
dictions representing half of the state’s total 
residential damage from Harvey. 
Due to the above failure, HUD directed the 
State to allow the City to submit its own action 
plan, 
directed 
by 
and 
informed 
by 
Houstonians. As directed by HUD and agreed 
to by the State, the GLO’s only role as the 
passthrough entity for the funding was to en-
sure compliance with HUD regulations. 
The State has failed in this role, by making 
up requirements for the City’s programs com-
pletely unrelated to any set by HUD but espe-
cially in its review of the City’s home repair 
program. 
Having decided to impose far more require-
ments than originally agreed to by the City or 
required by HUD, the GLO failed to commu-
nicate these additional requirements at the be-
ginning of the program—using instead its Re-
quests for Information (‘‘RFIs’’) process to re-
ject files and repeatedly changing its process 
along the way in order to continue rejecting 
files submitted by the City. 
For these reasons, and to protect the 
homes of hundreds of Black Homeowners, it 
matters that the city, so long as it meets or ex-
ceeds the expectations for recovery of homes 
post Hurricane Harvey, they should be allowed 
to continue the work. 
I urge all my colleagues to vote in support 
of En Bloc No. 5 and the Jackson Lee Amend-
ments. 
CITY OF HOUSTON, 
Houston, Texas, July 28, 2020. 
Hon. SHEILA JACKSON LEE, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR CONGRESSWOMAN JACKSON LEE: On be-
half of the City of Houston, I am writing to 
express strong support of your amendment 
#38 House Resolution 7617 regarding com-
mon-sense approach to providing disaster re-
covery assistance to households with homes 
damaged by Hurricane Harvey. 
In Houston, many of our lower-income sen-
iors live in single family homes that are 
their only asset. Of course, homeowners who 
have lived in homes with more than two bed-
rooms for many years would want to retain 
the value of that precious asset, even as they 
may need significant federal help to recon-
struct their homes. Our desired standard is 
to rebuild a three-bedroom home for house-
holds of four of fewer people for people whose 
homes had three of more bedrooms before 
the storm. 
While this is the standard outline in City 
of Houston guidelines, we are subject to 
rules set by the Texas General Land Office 
(GLO). GLO requires that occupancy as the 
sole factor for determining the size of rebuilt 
homes. Under GLO rules, people who have 
lived for many years in a three- or four-bed-
room home would be forced to accept a two- 
bedroom home as a condition of receiving 
Harvey assistance. 
This policy will have the unintended effect 
of depressing property values across those 
neighborhoods, while this amendment will 
help address that disparity and is consistent 
with the feedback from Houstonians. 
We must work together to ensure that 
Houston has a health housing stock of the 
future, and that vulnerable Houstonians who 
receive much-needed recovery funds after 
Harvey are not forced to unreasonable 
downsize longstanding family homes as a 
condition of receiving assistance. 
Sincerely, 
SYLVESTER TURNER, 
Mayor. 
CITY OF HOUSTON, 
Houston, Texas, July 28, 2020. 
Hon. SHEILA JACKSON LEE, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR CONGRESSWOMAN JACKSON LEE: The 
City of Houston (‘‘City’’) strongly opposes 
the Texas General Land Office’s (‘‘GLO’’) 
preposterous proposal to eliminate all City- 
administered CDBG-DR 17 program funding 
for several reasons. First, the City’s pro-
grams are successful and on schedule. For 
example, even though the City is only 1.5 
years into its grant: 
$446 million (35%) of total funds allocated 
to the City has already been designated for 
the specific properties or projects at which 
the assistance is to be used. 
$153 million (12%) is already under a signed 
contract that obligates its use to deliver re-
covery services, with more contracts being 
signed on a weekly basis. 
The City’s Single-Family programs have 
already fully served 234 homeowners, with 
another 246 families submitted to or ap-
proved by GLO and currently being served. 
At the current pace, the City will serve 1000 
families for each of the next 4 years before 
the end of the contract, for an estimated 
total served of 4,480 families. 
Second, the City’s programs are better and 
more appropriate for the citizens of the City 
than those the GLO has implemented. 
As intended by the U.S. Department of 
Housing and Urban Development (‘‘HUD’’), 
the City’s programs are serving the most 
vulnerable families first. This prioritization 
addresses systemic racial inequalities that 
have regularly occurred in prior disaster re-
covery efforts, including the disaster recov-
ery programs previously overseen by the 
State. Specifically, the City has adjusted its 
approach to ensure Houston’s most vulner-
able residents are not left behind because of 
regulatory or bureaucratic barriers erected 
by the State or any other entity. 
The City’s multifamily program will cre-
ate units that are affordable for more than 
twice as long the State’s program, will serve 
far more very low income families than the 
State’s program, and is attracting 7 times 
the amount of funding leverage (a require-
ment of the CDBG-DR 17 program) as com-
pared to the State’s program. 
The City’s program provides more recovery 
choices to Hurricane Harvey-impacted rent-
ers allowing them to use recovery funds to 
become homeowners. The State’s program 
does not provide this option. 
Third, the GLO’s proposed amendment vio-
lates the terms of its subrecipient agree-
ment, GLO Contract No. 19–147–001–B489, as 
amended, with the City (the ‘‘Contract’’). 
Section 2.03 of the Contract provides that 
amendments to increase or decrease the 
amount of the subaward must be made by 
written agreement of the parties and the 
City has not consented to any reduction in 
its subaward. 
Funding under the Contract has not been 
reduced or terminated. 
The City is performing under the terms of 
the Contract and has not defaulted under the 
Contract. 
Finally, the GLO has demonstrated that it 
has a difficult time complying with HUD re-
quirements and with establishing and com-
municating its own bureaucratic and con-
fusing requirements to the City. 
Two years ago, as it was drafting its own 
plan for the $5 billion recovery funds, the 
GLO failed to provide appropriate commu-
nity engagement in Houston and Harris 
County, jurisdictions representing half of the 
state’s total residential damage from Har-
vey. 
Due to the above failure, HUD directed the

Houstonians. As directed by HUD and agreed 
to by the State, the GLO’s only role as the 
passthrough entity for the funding was to en-
sure compliance with HUD regulations. The 
State has failed in this role, by making up 
requirements for the City’s programs com-
pletely unrelated to any set by HUD but es-
pecially in its review of the City’s home re-
pair program. 
Having decided to impose far more require-
ments than originally agreed to by the City 
or required by HUD, the GLO failed to com-
municate these additional requirements at 
the beginning of the program—using instead 
its Requests for Information (‘‘RFIs’’) proc-
ess to reject files and repeatedly changing its 
process along the way in order to continue 
rejecting files submitted by the City. 
1. The City’s programs are successful and 
on schedule by any measure and there is no 
reasonable rationale for taking away City 
administration of the programs. Such an ac-
tion only creates delays and harms the citi-
zens of Houston. 
COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT & OUTREACH 
The City’s Hurricane Harvey recovery pro-
grams were designed with significant com-
munity consultation, reaching nearly 4,500 
citizens. In response to the destruction that 
Hurricane Harvey caused, Congress allocated 
$5.024 billion to the State of Texas in Sep-
tember 2017. In March 2018, the State of 
Texas announced that the City would have 
local control over $1.15 billion of these funds. 
When the State of Texas released its State 
Action Plan in April 2018, the City had a 
short window of time in which to develop an 
Action Plan for its portion of the allocated 
funds. To increase transparency in the proc-
ess and support community efforts that pro-
mote the ‘‘right to stay, right to choose’’ 
framework promoted by housing advocates 
locally, the City’s Housing and Community 
Development Department (‘‘HCDD’’) initi-
ated its largest community engagement ef-
fort to date. Partners, organizations, and 
consulting teams, including building com-
munity WORKSHOP ([be]) and the Commu-
nity Design Resource Center, were engaged 
to increase the success and reach of the en-
gagement process. 
What the City heard from Houstonians is 
summarized as follows: Neighborhoods want 
a voice in the process of prioritizing where 
the money goes. Housing advocates want to 
ensure that Houston’s low- to moderate-in-
come residents are prioritized in this recov-
ery effort. Past recovery efforts led by the 
State fell short and heighten the desire by 
Houstonians for transparency and commu-
nity participation in the disaster recovery 
decision making process. Housing and neigh-
borhood advocates affirm the right of resi-
dents to have a say in what happens in their 
neighborhoods. A partnership approach be-
tween the City and community groups is the 
appropriate model to pursue. 
MULTIFAMILY PROGRAM 
The multifamily program that resulted 
from the City’s community consultation was 
designed to specifically address community 
concerns and needs, including flooding con-
cerns, fair housing considerations, and re-
placement of affordable rental units lost in 
the storm. The City’s multifamily program 
provides loans to local multifamily develop-
ments that agree to reserve a certain num-
ber of units for families at or above the pov-
erty level for many decades. CDBG-DR mul-
tifamily funding can be used to rehabilitate 
or build new, affordable apartment buildings. 
While the City’s programs respond to basic 
HUD requirements for targeting the major-
ity of assistance to low-income families, the 
City’s programs go much further to fully ad-
dress the unmet needs in Houston. The City’s 
multifamily programs are a model for how to 
spend and leverage federal funds to maximize 
their benefit to low-income Houstonians. 
Specifically, the City’s multifamily program 
achieves the following: More resilient design 
to ensure these homes are not flooded in the 
next storm; Equitable placement throughout 
the City to affirmatively further fair hous-
ing; Long-term affordability through a man-
datory minimum affordability period of 40 
years of affordability; Reserving a signifi-
cant number of units for occupancy by ex-
tremely low-income and very low-income 
families; Leveraging CDBG-DR resources to 
augment the Federal dollars and attract tax 
credits, bank loans and philanthropic funds; 
and Expanding workforce protections to en-
sure those building the homes have a livable 
wage, a safe work environment and a career 
path. 
The program includes requirements to en-
sure that developments constructed with 
City dollars are built to withstand future 
storm damage. As part of its resiliency plan-
ning, during Round2 of the City’s multi-
family application process, the City insti-
tuted additional design standards to ensure 
that the new developments would withstand 
future flooding. These standards provide 
guidance for multifamily building owners on 
a variety of retrofit strategies and outline 
mitigation strategies against a variety of 
hazards. Applicants were required to provide 
the City preconstruction, design phase infor-
mation showing the planned project will in-
corporate resilient building measures to pro-
tect residents from future disasters. For new 
construction 
or 
major 
rehabilitation 
projects, this requires identification of a 
minimum of 12 resilient project points. Re-
silient Areas where developments were grad-
ed are based on the Enterprise Ready to Re-
spond: Strategies for Multifamily Building 
Resilience in the areas of protection, adapta-
tion, back up measures and community as 
follows: 
Protection—Applicants are required to de-
sign a minimum of two distinct strategies to 
reduce a building’s vulnerability to extreme 
weather. 
Adaptation—Applicants are required to de-
sign a minimum of three distinct strategies 
that improve a facility’s ability to adapt to 
changing climate conditions 
Back up measures—Applicants are required 
to design at least one strategy that provide 
critical needs when a facility loses power or 
other services. 
Community—Applicants incorporate two 
strategies that encourage behavior which en-
hances resilience 
Green Building Standard—Applicants are 
required to build their development to one of 
four energy efficiency standards (HUD re-
quirement) 
Solar—Applicants are required to design 
buildings to be solar ready (HUD require-
ment) 
Electric Vehicles (‘‘EV’’)—Applicants are 
required to incorporate standards to be 
ready to implement EV charging stations 
Substantial amendments are to be re-
viewed by HUD for clarity. As shown above, 
Action Plan Amendment 7 is simply not 
clear. It is confusing and misleading, espe-
cially with regard to programs operated 
within the City. 
ACTION

NEEDS
IN 
THE CITY 
We are further concerned that the GLO’s 
efforts to replace the City’s CDBG-DR 17 pro-
grams with GLO’s more limited programs 
will expose the GLO, and potentially the 
City, to potential fair housing claims. The 
City’s programs were specifically designed to 
address affirmatively furthering fair housing 
objectives and nondiscrimination in the 
City. The City prioritized our assistance in 
the single family programs for our most vul-
nerable and impacted citizens, which are 
often protected classes (including people of 
color and persons with disabilities). The City 
prioritized the new rental units created in 
the multifamily program in neighborhoods 
of opportunity, ensured that more units are 
available long-term to very low income fami-
lies, and we have maximized our investment 
of federal resources through requiring devel-
opers to obtain significant leverage of other 
private and public dollars. Both GLO and 
HUD are currently being sued for fair hous-
ing violations by renters and low-income 
families who believed GLO’s allocation of 
funds and program design discriminates 
against renters (who in Texas are also dis-
proportionately protected classes) and does 
not properly take into account the needs of 
Texans impacted by Hurricane Harvey. We 
would think that, rather than apply pro-
grams that are already under fire for fair 
housing violations in Houston, the GLO 
would welcome the continued operation of 
programs that better address the fair hous-
ing needs of the citizens of the City and are 
not the subject of active fair housing litiga-
tion. 
CONCLUSION 
These comments highlight the numerous 
flaws in Action Plan Amendment 7. It is not 
approvable by HUD and requires substantial 
revision. While the City urges the GLO to 
cease its unreasonable efforts and revise the 
Action Plan Amendment 7 to allow the City 
to continue to administer its programs and 
help the citizens of Houston, we note sepa-
rately that any substantive revision to this 
Amendment should be subject to further 
public comment. The GLO should draft a 
sensible, approvable Amendment 7 and re- 
issue for the required public comment. 
In the alternative, GLO should not submit 
Action Plan Amendment 7 as drafted to 
HUD. If GLO chooses to do so, HUD should 
reject the portions of the amendment that 
eliminate the City’s administration of its al-
location of CDBG–DR 17 funds so as to enable 
the citizens of Houston to access much-need-
ed funds and services. HUD should reject the 
amendment on the ground that it is incom-
plete and does not fully respond to the appli-
cable criteria governing the CBGD–DR pro-
gram. In the alternative, HUD should modify 
the grant such that it becomes a direct grant 
to the City, rather than one administered by 
the State.

national historic trail studies authorized by 
law, with special attention to enacted trail 
studies, relating to the history of underrep-
resented groups. Amendment #30 is of par-
ticular importance to us as it relates to H.R. 
434—Emancipation National Historic Trail 
Study Act and the Emancipation National 
Historic Trail (the ‘‘Emancipation National 
Historic Trail’’)—a 51–mile route showing 
the migration of newly freed slaves and 
other people of African descent in the 19th 
century. The Emancipation National His-
toric Trail begins at the location of the fa-
mous June 19, 1865, Juneteenth Announce-
ment, commemorating the ending of slavery 
in Texas, and follows the route of the newly 
freed and formerly enslaved persons into 
Houston, Texas, and ends in Emancipation 
Park and the historic Independence Heights. 
The Emancipation National Historic Trail 
will become only the second trail in the 243– 
year history of the United States to com-
memorate the history of African Americans. 
Currently, the National Parks Service has 
only one other National Historic Trail which 
centers on the African American experience. 
It is the Selma to Montgomery National His-
toric Trail, which covers a 54–mile path be-
tween Selma and Montgomery, Alabama, and 
which was named a national historic trail in 
1996. The Selma to Montgomery trail tells an 
important story about a pivotal moment in 
the nation’s struggle transitioning from a 
history of segregation towards the modem 
Civil Rights Movement. 
The goals of the Emancipation National 
Historic Trail are the restoration, resurrec-
tion, and ascension of historical memory. It 
is a remarkable story and one that all Amer-
icans can be proud to share with the world. 
However, this cannot occur without direct fi-
nancial support as offered by Amendment 
#30 to Div. C of H.R. 7608. Indeed, Amend-
ment #30 would preserve critical periods of 
U.S. history not otherwise represented in ex-
isting Federal trails or historic places. 
Amendment #30 provides support for the 
commencement of the Emancipation Na-
tional Historic Trail study and will support 
additional studies that have been approved 
by Congress and signed into law. Your sup-
port and championing of Congresswoman 
SHEILA JACKSON LEE’S Amendment #30 is ap-

Year 2021 funding to the Department of Inte-
rior, which includes the National Parks 
Service (‘‘NPS’’) which manages our nation’s 
parks, monuments, and federally recognized

As you are aware, Amendment #78 seeks to 
provide $2 million to promote collaborations 
between Historically Black College and Uni-
versities (‘‘HBCUs’’) and local historic soci-
eties to identify, restore, and preserve places 
of historic significance to African Americans 
that are at risk of being lost. Amendment 
#78 is of particular importance to us as it re-

history preservationist to collaborate with 
students at HBCUs on projects such as the 
Emancipation National Historic Trail and 
other projects to reclaim treasures that 
would otherwise be lost for future genera-

the protection of historic treasures in under-
served communities. 
We ask that you support Congresswoman 
Jackson Lee’s Amendment #78 to Div. C of 
H.R. 7608 because it is needed and would con-

However, this cannot occur without direct 
support as offered by Amendment #36 and 
#38, H.R. 7617. Indeed, Amendment #36 and 
Amendment #38 would preserve critical peri-
ods of U.S. history not otherwise represented 
in existing Federal trails or historic places. 
Your support and championing of Con-
gresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee’s Amend-
ment #36 and #38 is appreciated as it will 
provide vital resources for this historic en-
deavor.

RE Support of Congresswoman Sheila Jack-

(‘‘Division G Amendment #36’’) and, Divi-

DEAR CHAIRMAN MCGOVERN
AND RANKING 
MEMBER COLE: On behalf of the community 
of Independence Heights we are sending this 
letter to show our support for Congress-
woman Sheila Jackson Lee’s Amendment #36 
and Amendment #38, H. R. 7617. 
As you are aware, Rules #36 Prohibits the 
Department of Transportation from using 
funds for Section 106 Transportation con-
struction projects in urban that have not 
been determined to meet the statutory and 
fiduciary obligations of the National His-
toric Preservation Act. As our community is 
one of the identified places on the National 
Emancipation Historic Trail, we are facing 
extreme pressure from gentrification and im-
pending displacement and cultural erasure as 
a result of the North Houston Highway Im-
provement Project. More specifically, we are 
faced with the loss of many key historic 
structures in our community that will con-
tribute to our placement on the historic 
trail. Supporting this amendment is key for 
our community as it will help protect the re-
maining historical and culturally significant 
structures 
Also, the Rules #38 amendment provides 
$1,000,000 in assistance to address challenges 
faced by communities impacted by per-
sistent poverty and are not included in deci-
sion making when major highway construc-
tion threatens their homes, businesses, and 
culturally significant structures. 
Amendment #36 and #38 are of particular 
importance to us as it relates to H.R. 434— 
Emancipation National Historic Trail Study 
Act and the Emancipation National Historic 
Trail (the ‘‘Emancipation National Historic 
Trail’’)—a 51–mile route showing the migra-
tion of newly freed slaves and other people 
African descent in the 19th century. The 
Emancipation National Historic Trail begins 
at the location of the famous June 19, 1865, 
Juneteenth Announcement, commemorating 
the ending of slavery in Texas, and follows 
the route of the newly freed and formerly 
enslaved persons into Houston, Texas. The 
route includes historic places such as Eman-
cipation Park and our community, historic 
Independence Heights. This historic trail 
will become only the second trail in the 243– 
year history of the United States to com-
memorate the history of African Americans. 
Currently, the National Parks Service has 
only one other National Historic Trail which 
centers on the African American experience. 
It is the Selma to Montgomery National His-
toric Trail, which covers a 54–mile path be-
tween Selma and Montgomery, Alabama, es-
tablished in 1996. The Selma to Montgomery 
trail tells an important story about a pivotal 
moment 
in 
the 
nation’s 
struggle 
transitioning from a history of segregation 
towards the modem Civil Rights Movement. 
The goals of the Emancipation National 
Historic Trail are the restoration, resurrec-
tion, and ascension of historical memory. It 
is a remarkable story and one that all Amer-
icans can be proud to share with the world. 
It should also be noted that without these 
proposed amendments, these communities 
are in threat of losing the physical evidence 
of their existence. 
We 
encourage 
your 
support 
of 
these 
amendments and invite your direct support 
as offered by approving Amendment #36 and 
#38, H. R. 7617.

As you are aware, Rules #36 Prohibits the

Chairman. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1067, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendments en bloc offered by the 
gentleman from Indiana (Mr. VIS-
CLOSKY). 
The question is on the amendments 
en bloc. 
The en bloc amendments were agreed 
to. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
AMENDMENT NO. 219 OFFERED BY MR. ALLEN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 219 
printed in House Report 116–461. 
Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, I have 
an amendment at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
At the end of division F (before the short 
title), insert the following: 
SEC. ll. The total amount of appropria-
tions made available by this Act is hereby 
reduced by 5 percent. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1067, the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. ALLEN) and a 
Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Georgia. 
Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, last 
week, I stood before this body as we 
voted on the first spending package, 
which, like this package, was enormous 
and brought before this House without 
enough time to learn where the Amer-
ican people’s tax dollars are actually 
going. 
Today, we are considering 6 of the 12 
traditional appropriation bills in one 
package. 
We must get back to regular order 
and a process where we can carefully 
consider and examine each bill and one 
that works for the American people. 
The bills in this package would spend 
$1.3 trillion in total discretionary 
spending, a 13.9 percent increase from 
the budget that was agreed to. 
I would once again like to state for 
the record that the Democratic major-
ity can’t even stick to the bipartisan 
budget that was agreed to last year. 
The first appropriations package that 
was passed last week contains $37 bil-
lion in emergency measures, and this 
package adds another $207 billion of 
such spending. With that addition, ac-
cording to the Congressional Budget

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

July 30, 2020 
Office estimate, this level of spending 
is 23.5 percent higher than the Presi-
dent’s request. 
No business or family in this country 
would ever dream of spending money 
like this that they don’t have and have 
no idea where they are going to get it. 
So why does this body think we are an 
exception? 
Unfortunately, that is business as 
usual for the 116th Congress. 
My amendment today is simple. It 
would reduce the total amount of fund-
ing for the Labor, HHS, and Education 
division by 5 percent for fiscal year 
2021. 
HHS alone is a $1.2 trillion agency. It 
employs hundreds of lawyers. Without 
my amendment, the division provides a 
net total of $222.4 billion in fiscal year 
2021 discretionary budget authority. 
If you do the math, my amendment 
would cut about $9.8 billion. I urge my 
Democratic colleagues to support my 
amendment since they will still be 
overspending, but just a little bit less 
than they initially intended. 
I just want to note that I wanted to 
offer a 5 percent cut to multiple divi-
sions throughout this bill, but con-
tinuing the Democrats’ shadowy proc-
ess, only this one amendment to this 
bill was ruled in order. 
We can no longer neglect our na-
tional 
debt 
crisis, 
which 
is 
at 
unsustainable heights. It is morally 
wrong to burden our children and 
grandchildren with excessive debt be-
cause we can’t seem to get our act to-
gether and exercise fiscal constraint. 
Let me explain myself like this: How 
in the world can we create a standard 
of healthcare and a standard of living 
in this country on the backs of our 
children and grandchildren? We can’t 
pay for it. So what do we do? We send 
it to our children and grandchildren 
and I don’t know how many genera-
tions. 
I urge my colleagues in this body to 
support my amendment today, and 
let’s start having a serious discussion 
about how we can once again unleash 
economic growth in this country by re-
straining spending. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
b 1430 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in opposition to the amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Connecticut is recog-
nized for 5 minutes. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
would just say to the gentleman, I hope 
he had the same concern about what 
happens to our children and grand-
children as he may have supported the 
unbelievable—what is it?—$2 trillion in 
tax cuts for the wealthiest 1 percent of 
the people in this Nation. 
Again, I rise in opposition to the 
amendment. It would cut funding for 
important programs and services that 
provide for working families in this 
country. Many of these programs are 
already underfunded; they fail to meet 
the existing need. 
For instance, the amendment would 
cut Head Start by $538 million, leading 
to thousands of children losing access 
to high-quality early learning pro-
grams, and that would be on the backs 
of today where we don’t have an ad-
ministration that wants to do anything 
about the loss of childcare in this coun-
try. They would cut the Childcare and 
Development Block Grant by almost 
$300 million at a time when childcare is 
in crisis. More than half of childcare 
programs could close if we do not pro-
vide emergency funding. 
Just yesterday, this House passed 
two emergency bills to bring much- 
needed relief to childcare providers, 
and yet this amendment would cut 
funding for childcare. 
It would cut the Low Income Home 
Energy Assistance Program, LIHEAP, 
a bipartisan priority, by $188 million. 
How about senior nutrition, which it 
would cut, including Meals on Wheels, 
by almost $50 million, resulting in 10 
million fewer home-delivered or pre-
packaged meals for low-income seniors. 
Think about it. Think about that. 
It would cut biomedical research at 
the National Institutes of Health by 
$2.3 billion, resulting in a reduction of 
nearly 2,500 new research grants. 
It would cut title 1 funding for our 
public schools by $828 million, reducing 
needed resources for 25 million low-in-
come students. 
It would cut special education grants 
to States by $648 million. That would 
reduce support to provide services for 
7.4 million students with disabilities, 
curtailing their ability to succeed. 
It would cut Federal financial aid 
programs, Pell grants, the SEOG pro-
gram, and the Work-Study Program by 
$1.2 billion for students and for families 
in need. 
It would cut funding for job training 
programs by $185 million, resulting in 
fewer supports for Americans who are 
seeking better opportunities for them-
selves and for their families. 
It would cut funding by $122 million 
meant to help States manage and ad-
minister 
unemployment 
insurance 
claims and benefits for struggling 
Americans. 
Today, people are not even sure if 
their unemployment benefits are going 
to be cut off tomorrow unless the Sen-
ate would move and pass the HEROES 
bill, where we extend unemployment 
benefits. But, no, this amendment 
would cut $122 million, again, cutting 
the unemployment insurance program. 
This is about values. Budgets are 
about values, and $135 billion that is in 
the CARES bill has gone to or was pre-
pared to go to 43,000 taxpayers at $1.6 
million as a tax rebate going back to 
2018, 2019 when no one had even heard 
of the coronavirus. But that is okay. 
That is okay. We can pass that. We can 
do something about that because of 
whom it benefits. 
Think about whom we need to benefit 
in this institution and what our re-
sponsibilities are. Our responsibilities 
are to the working families and the es-
sential workers today who are on the 
front lines trying to just be able to get 
by and also to save themselves, their 
health, and their families. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to oppose this amendment, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, in re-
sponse, I understand that we are in un-
precedented times, but H.R. 7617 moves 
our Nation in the wrong direction. 
We talk about values. Those same 
children who are in Head Start pro-
grams 20 years from now are going to 
be trying to find a job. Five months 
ago, we had the best economy in the 
world. We had more jobs than we had 
people looking for jobs. 
Isn’t that what America is all about: 
living the American Dream? 
Yet what we are doing is those same 
children—and we say we care about the 
children—where are you going to get 
the money? Where are you going to get 
it? Off their backs? 
Madam Speaker, we can’t continue 
this, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1067, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendment offered by the gentleman 
from Georgia (Mr. ALLEN). 
The question is on the amendment. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the noes appear to have it. 
Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3 of House Resolution 
965, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are 
postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO. 239 OFFERED BY MS. 
FINKENAUER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 239 
printed in House Report 116–461. 
Ms. FINKENAUER. Madam Speaker, 
I have an amendment at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Page 749, line 7, after the dollar amount, 
insert ‘‘(increased by $12,000,000)’’. 
Page 780, line 11, after the first dollar 
amount, insert ‘‘(reduced by $12,000,000)’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-

woman from Iowa. 
Ms. FINKENAUER. Madam Speaker, 
I rise to offer this amendment to dou-
ble Federal research funding for endo-
metriosis over the level for fiscal year 
2019. 
Endometriosis is a painful, chronic 
condition affecting 1 in 10 women, 7 
million women in the United States, 
with serious costs to their physical and 
emotional health and quality of life.

July 30, 2020 
and the many women who have it, it 
remains 
misunderstood, 
under-
researched and underfunded. 
Women and their caregivers, alike, 
often suffer from a lack of awareness 
about the symptoms of endometriosis 
and the disease itself. 
This is a profound and heavy moment 
for me right now because of the fact 
that, back in March, I came down to 
this Chamber and shared publicly for 
the very first time that I, too, suffer 
from endometriosis. You see, Madam 
Speaker, at the time when I gave my 
speech, I wanted to make sure that 
folks knew that I could still do my job, 
that, yes, I have this painful condition, 
but that I was tough and I could still 
do my job and my work. 
Luckily, I have been able to do that. 
I have my entire career. But what I re-
alized since sharing my story is that I 
am absolutely one of the lucky ones, 
because this condition affects people in 
all different ways and in all different 
severities. 
I happened to have been fortunate to 
find out at a young age when my moth-
er believed my pain. This is for the 
women whom I have heard from who 
have reached out and who have suffered 
in silence, the ones whose bodies this 
condition has attacked in even more 
severe ways, who have had to drop out 
of the workforce because of the sever-
ity of their condition, the ones who 
have lost decades of their lives and 
their future family plans in pain be-
cause there weren’t better options and 
there weren’t any answers. They are 
warriors, they are tough, and they are 
braver than we deserve. 
Today, we uplift those voices along 
with the truth that we must do more. 
You see, Madam Speaker, it is impera-
tive that, with this funding, not only 
do we raise awareness of this issue, but 
we fight for better options: more than 
just one or two pills that don’t nec-
essarily work for every woman; more 
than extreme surgeries like cauteriza-
tion or hysterectomies; and education 
and work to bring equity to other sur-
geries that are more advanced but yet 
specialized and available to so few be-
cause of the cost so that more women 
can get the care that they need and, 
quite frankly, deserve. 
At the same time, we need to also 
figure out why this condition happens 
in the first place. Does it start at 
birth? Does it happen later in life? Can 
it happen starting in adolescence? 
There are so many unknowns in this 
condition that we have known about 
since the 1920s. Again, 7 million women 
have it currently in the United States. 
Today, we push forward. Today, we 
celebrate a win. But today is just the 
beginning. We will continue to uplift 
and increase awareness, funding, and 
research every single step of the way. 
It has been an honor to hear the sto-
ries of the women who have reached 
out. They have told me, after reaching 
out and hearing their story, their pain 
described for the first time ever on the 
House floor, that they felt for the first 
time that they were not alone. After 
hearing their stories, they have made 
me feel not alone, and we will continue 
together. We have so much work left to 
do, and they are the reason we will not 
stop fighting. 
I fully urge the adoption of this 
amendment. 
Madam Speaker, may I inquire how 
much time remains. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman has 30 seconds remaining. 
Ms. FINKENAUER. Madam Speaker, 
I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman 
from Connecticut (Ms. DELAURO). 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, let 
me thank the gentlewoman for her pas-
sion, her concern, her courage, and her 
leadership on this issue. 
There really isn’t much more to say. 
I thank her for standing up for women 
and for health. 
I am a survivor of ovarian cancer. 
The gentlewoman is tough. She is a 
warrior. She represents those who are 
suffering in pain every single day, 
when nearly 1 in 10 women are affected 
by this condition. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this amendment and 
support women’s health research. It is 
imperative that women are able to sur-
vive endometriosis. 
Ms. FINKENAUER. Madam Speaker, 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1067, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendment offered by the gentle-
woman from Iowa (Ms. FINKENAUER). 
The question is on the amendment. 
The amendment was agreed to. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
AMENDMENT NO. 241 OFFERED BY MR. FOSTER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 241 
printed in House Report 116–461. 
Mr. FOSTER. Madam Speaker, I have 
an amendment at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Strike section 510 of division F. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1067, the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. FOSTER) and 
a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Illinois. 
Mr. FOSTER. Madam Speaker, this 
bipartisan amendment offered by Mr. 
KELLY and me and supported, also, by 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT and Dr. BERA, would 
strike section 510, which bans HHS 
from adopting standards for a unique 
patient identifier that would allow pa-
tients to be identified uniquely across 
electronic health record systems. 
In the 21 years that this misguided 
policy has been in place, tens of thou-
sands of Americans have died due to 
getting the wrong drug to the wrong 
patient or due to incorrect or incom-
plete electronic medical records, all 
arising from the inability to simply 
and correctly merge health records 
from different systems. 
Matching records properly requires a 
unique identifier for each patient. A 
Federal ban on doing this properly 
makes our healthcare system more ex-
pensive and less safe for patients. 
A Johns Hopkins study recently cal-
culated that more than 250,000 deaths 
per year are due to medical errors, and 
patient misidentification is a signifi-
cant contributor to this. 
b 1445 
This ban is also handcuffing us in our 
fight against opioids. A 2018 roundtable 
on the opioid crisis, cohosted by HHS 
and the nonprofit Center for Open Data 
Enterprise, recommended the genera-
tion of a unique identifier for each pa-
tient. 
This would not only guard against so- 
called ‘‘doctor shopping’’ for opioids by 
those struggling with substance use 
disorder, but could also prevent those 
in recovery from accidentally being 
given prescription opioids after an in-
jury, surgery, or childbirth, thereby 
triggering a relapse. 
Finally, the ability to identify pa-
tients across the care continuum is 
also critical in our efforts to address 
the COVID–19 pandemic. Accurate iden-
tification of patients is one of the most 
difficult and crucial operational issues 
during a public health emergency. 
Field hospitals and temporary testing 
sites in parks, convention centers, and 
parking lots only intensify these chal-
lenges. 
Laboratories that are testing patient 
specimens for COVID–19 are reporting 
that patient misidentification is caus-
ing COVID–19 test results to be re-
turned to the wrong patient with po-
tentially deadly consequences. 
Madam Speaker, repealing this ban 
tackles a known and fixable problem in 
our healthcare system. I urge support 
for this bipartisan amendment, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in opposition, although 
I am not opposed to the amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania is recognized for 5 minutes. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding. It is nice working with the 
gentleman. This has been a couple of 
years in the making, and it is way over 
time. 
First, let’s understand one thing: 
name and date of birth just isn’t cut-
ting it anymore, so this ban on HHS 
promulgating a unique patient identi-
fier has resulted in a lot of American 
lives lost. 
Madam Speaker, Mr. FOSTER already 
referenced a Johns Hopkins study that 
said up to 250,000 deaths per year—and 
I want you to think about that num-
ber—250,000 deaths per year are due to 
medical error. When we are talking 
today about the number of deaths from 
the coronavirus, and saying now it has

gone over 145,000, these are deaths 
caused by a virus. And then here, we 
have another opportunity, if we are 
using the right data, we could possibly 
wipe out medical errors just by having 
access to that data and being able to 
cross-reference. Mr. FOSTER also ref-
erenced about opiates that sometimes 
patients are prescribed as a way to 
handle the pain. 
Madam Speaker, I sat in the emer-
gency room with one of my children. 
And a doctor said to him: We found out 
what you have; you do have MRSA. It 
is on your hip, and we are going to 
have to operate on you, and we are 
going to have to be able to try and 
scrape that off. Although it won’t be 
gone forever, it will take care of the 
problem right now. This is what I am 
going to do. And he went through the 
procedure. 
He also talked about the anesthesia 
that he was going to use. And he said 
to him: Do you have any problem with 
anything I have told you? 
And my son said: No, none at all. 
Well, luckily, I was sitting there. I 
said: Well, Doctor, the fact that he is a 
heroin addict, would that have any ef-
fect? 
The doctor looked up and said: Oh, 
my God. Thank God you said some-
thing about it, because that would ab-
solutely be fatal for him. 
Madam Speaker, it is not just hap-
pening in studies. We are seeing it on 
the floor all the time in our hospitals. 
We are seeing that somehow data that 
is available is not being made available 
because of some archaic ban. Some-
body says: No, we shouldn’t have ac-
cess because it just doesn’t make sense. 
It does make sense. It makes all the 
sense in the world. 
In the year 2020, and what we are 
looking at right now, and we are talk-
ing about finding a cure for the 
coronavirus and doing it in a safe and 
smart way, why wouldn’t we be able to 
look at all the data that is available? 
Why wouldn’t we be able to cross-ref-
erence it? Why would we sit in the dark 
and say, this is my best guess? It 
doesn’t have to be that way. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. FOSTER). This 
has been over 2 years trying to get this, 
and I feel very certain we will get it 
done, but this just makes sense. 
Quite frankly, the stuff we have been 
using for the last several decades it 
just—maybe back in 1999, when it was 
an issue for somebody, it made sense. 
Not today; not in 2020; not in the world 
we live in; not in the danger that we 
are putting people in just because we 
don’t always have the right data in 
front of us. And we can do that. We 
have the ability to do that. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. FOSTER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from 
Connecticut 
(Ms. 
DELAURO), 
chairwoman 
of 
the 
Appropriations, 
Labor-HHS 
and 
Education 
Sub-
committee. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
Congressman 
FOSTER’s 
amendment, 
and was fascinated listening to the bi-
partisan support for this effort. This 
brings down the skyrocketing cost of 
healthcare, a universal interoperable 
patient identifier, reducing avoidable 
administrative 
errors 
as 
has 
been 
pointed out, and that is being further 
exacerbated by COVID–19 today. 
So we learned during this pandemic 
that accurate identification of patients 
is one of the most difficult operational 
issues in the field. Field hospitals, tem-
porary testing sites are gathering de-
mographic information of patients, but 
correctly matching that result after 
they return from labs is time-inten-
sive, sometimes inaccurate, and it is a 
burden for the healthcare system. 
I also would make one point, and I 
have expressed this to my colleague, 
Mr. FOSTER. We have to do this in a 
way that protects the sensitivity of an 
individual’s medical information and 
that person’s right to privacy cannot 
be compromised. So we need to be firm, 
clear on that principle. I think it can 
be developed in a way that doesn’t 
compromise right-to-privacy. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this amendment. 
Mr. FOSTER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania (Mr. KELLY), my colleague, for 
cosponsoring this bipartisan amend-
ment 
so 
that 
we 
can 
move 
our 
healthcare system into the 21st cen-
tury, save money, and, most impor-
tantly, save lives. 
Madam Speaker, this amendment is 
supported by over 50 health groups, in-
cluding the American Heart Associa-
tion, the American College of Obstetri-
cians and Gynecologists, the American 
College of Physicians, the American 
College of Surgeons, the College of 
Healthcare Information Management 
Executives, the Opioid Safety Alliance, 
and many others. 
Madam Speaker, last year, the House 
resoundingly passed this amendment to 
strike this ban. I urge my colleagues to 
once again pass this amendment. I urge 
the Senate to take proper action when 
we do, and I yield back the balance of 
my time.

ant to House Resolution 1067, the pre-
vious 
question 
is

AMENDMENT NO. 334 OFFERED BY MR. POSEY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 334 
printed in House Report 116–461. 
Mr. POSEY. Madam Speaker, I have 
an amendment at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Page 954, line 4, after the dollar amount, 
insert ‘‘(increased by $2,000,000) (reduced by 
$2,000,000)’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1067, the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. POSEY) and a 
Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Florida. 
Mr. POSEY. Madam Speaker, resi-
dents and local businesses along the 
way have expressed concerns about the 
upcoming high-speed rail project being 
built along Florida’s east coast and 
through my district. 
A high number of fatalities have al-
ready been associated with the train 
since the South Florida operations 
began in 2018. In fact, over the past 3 
years, 75 deaths have been reported 
along the rail corridor, with more than 
40 deaths involving the new high-speed 
train. 
Last year, the Associated Press ana-
lyzed data from the Federal Railroad 
Administration and concluded that the 
project had ‘‘the worst per-mile death 
rate of the Nation’s 821 railroads.’’ 
These trains will travel at fast speeds 
through existing town centers and resi-
dential areas in my district, with little 
separating the tracks from the sur-
rounding communities. I have had con-
cern for local schools in my district. 
There are several that are positioned 
very close or adjacent to the tracks; 
Gifford Middle School and North Coun-
ty Elementary School in Vero Beach, 
and Ascension Catholic School in Mel-
bourne, just to name a couple of them. 
Many students walking to and from 
school must cross these tracks, and we 
all have an interest in their safety. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my good 
friend 
and 
colleague, 
Congressman 
BRIAN MAST, for working together with 
me on this amendment, and for stand-
ing up for the safety of our constitu-
ents. Our amendment simply asks the 
Federal Railroad Administration and 
the Federal Highway Administration 
to conduct a pedestrian, motorist, and 
student safety study along the corridor 
and report back their recommenda-
tions to increase safety. The amend-
ment simply increases the FRA’s rail 
safety operations budget by $2 million 
from the program’s reserve funds. 
My office reached out to both the 
FRA and the FHWA for technical as-
sistance on doing such a study, and 
neither agency expressed any objection 
whatsoever. In fact, FRA expressed 
support for it. 
Staff from both the minority and the 
majority offices assisted in drafting 
this amendment, and I sincerely want 
to thank them for working together 
and stepping up to help on this. 
The rail corridor is the recipient of 
Federal money and has been authorized 
for private activity bonds, so the Fed-
eral Government has been involved in 
the funding and financing of this 
project. Since Federal resources are 
being expended, it only makes sense 
that we should make sure it is safe for 
the surrounding communities.

July 30, 2020 
The introduction of high-speed rail 
for our Florida communities will un-
doubtedly present safety challenges 
that need to be properly addressed, and 
that is the purpose of this amendment. 
I ask my colleagues to join us in 
looking out for the safety of our resi-
dents, motorists, and school children, 
and support our amendment. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I claim the time in opposi-
tion, although I want to support the 
bill, if that is acceptable. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the gentleman from North 
Carolina is recognized for 5 minutes. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. MAST). 
Mr. MAST. Madam Speaker, I appre-
ciate the gentleman yielding me the 
time. 
Madam Speaker, I also rise in sup-
port of my colleague. I rise in support 
of my colleague, Mr. POSEY’s amend-
ment, specifically because what is 
going on with Virgin Trains and 
Brightline, it affects my community as 
well. 
This project, it goes through some 
very dense communities with very lit-
tle room between it and the people who 
live there. Hundreds of the crossings 
that we have that go through our com-
munity, nearly all of them, are at 
grade, directly encountering the traffic 
that they travel so close to. There are 
several schools in close proximity to 
the rail tracks, often placing children 
in significant danger of this project. 
This amendment, which I am very 
proud to cosponsor, would divert $2 
million from the Railroad Rehabilita-
tion and Improvement Financing loan 
program for a study on pedestrian safe-
ty related to this project—very worthy 
cause. 
This is a commonsense, public safety 
provision that will help to keep chil-
dren and people in our community safe. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for yielding me time. 
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in support of this 
amendment. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
the 
rail 
safety 
issues that our colleagues raise are not 
limited to the State of Florida. They 
are severe in Florida, but they are, in 
fact, national problems. 
Communities across the country are 
working to address highway-rail grade 
crossing safety, to prevent trespassing 
on railroad rights-of-way, and to miti-
gate blocked railroad crossings. In fact, 
the two leading causes of all rail-re-
lated fatalities are collisions at high-
way-rail grade crossings and tres-
passing on railroad rights-of-way. 
This bill will provide communities 
and the Federal Railroad Administra-
tion with tools to mitigate these safety 
risks and to develop local solutions— 
specifically: 
$110 million in grants for highway- 
rail 
grade 
crossing 
improvement 
projects; 
$25 million for capital projects and 
engineering solutions targeting tres-
passing; 
$10 million to continue media cam-
paigns focused on grade crossing safe-
ty; 
And $3.6 million for FRA to develop 
risk models, bolster community out-
reach and education, and support en-
forcement grants. 
In addition, the bill requires FRA to 
continue to update each year its na-
tional strategy to prevent trespassing 
on railroad property, so we can have 
the most current data available and 
better understand the progress being 
made or the challenges that remain in 
reducing trespasser fatalities. 
Madam Speaker, I commend my col-
leagues for offering this amendment, 
for calling attention to this issue, and 
I pledge to continue to work with them 
as we address railroad safety. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

AMENDMENT NO. 335 OFFERED BY MS. SHERRILL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 335 
printed in House Report 116–461. 
Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Speaker, I 
have an amendment at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Page 954, line 15, after the dollar amount, 
insert ‘‘(reduced by $5,000,000) (increased by 
$5,000,000)’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1067, the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
New 
Jersey 
(Ms. 
SHERRILL) and a Member opposed each 
will control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New Jersey. 
Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
speak about an issue critical to the 
residents of New Jersey. 
I applaud Chairwoman LOWEY, Chair-
man PRICE, and the Appropriations 
Committee for this important legisla-
tion, which includes significant new in-
vestments in transit to modernize our 
crumbling bridges and tunnels and will 
jump-start our economy, create jobs, 
and improve the quality of life for New 
Jersey commuters. 
My amendment demonstrates the 
strong support this bill provides for the 
Gateway tunnel project and other im-
portant rail projects throughout the 
Nation. 
Of great importance to New Jersey is 
this legislation’s focus on new rail in-
frastructure investment, including re-
newed funding for Amtrak’s Northeast 
Corridor, 
the 
Capital 
Investment 
Grants program, and the State of Good 
Repair Grants program. 
The Nation’s most critical surface in-
frastructure project is the Gateway 
tunnel project. A failure of the current 
Hudson River tunnels could send the 
Nation into an even greater recession 
and cost the economy an estimated 
$100 million a day. 
A planned, partial closure of the ex-
isting Hudson River tunnel could wipe 
out $22 billion in property values in 
New Jersey alone. 
New Jersey and the Nation need 
funding to build Gateway and revi-
talize the similarly outdated transpor-
tation infrastructure across the coun-
try. 
In May of 2019, I testified in front of 
the House Transportation and Infra-
structure Committee about the des-
perate need for a dedicated source of 
passenger rail capital funding that 
could be used to expedite the funding 
process for large projects like Gateway. 
One program that can fill this impor-
tant role is the Federal Railroad Ad-
ministration’s 
Northeast 
Corridor 
grant program for Amtrak, which pro-
vides funding for capital projects to ex-
pand passenger rail capacity and reli-
ability along the most heavily used rail 
line in the Nation. This legislation pro-
vides almost $1.2 billion for this pro-
gram, a significant step in expediting 
funding for the Gateway project. 
Another important program for this 
task is the Federal Safe Partnership 
for State of Good Repair program, 
which provides funding to rehabilitate 
rail infrastructure and improve pas-
senger rail performance. 
A critical barrier to moving the 
Gateway project forward has been the 
administration’s flawed interpretation 
of State of Good Repair funding as only 
being 
available 
to 
infrastructure 
projects in the construction phase. 
That is in spite of the fact that the 
FAST Act of 2015, which created the 
program, intended the funding to also 
go toward projects in the planning and 
review phases. 
I sent a letter to the Transportation 
and 
Infrastructure 
Committee 
last 
year, urging that their surface trans-
portation bill include language that ex-
plicitly allows projects in the design, 
planning, and review stages to be eligi-
ble for State of Good Repair grants. I 
was greatly pleased to see this exact 
language included in this legislation. It 
is an important step that will help ex-
pedite the funding that is available for 
Gateway. 
It is concerning that even when the 
administration has approved grants for 
Gateway, it has slow-walked that proc-
ess 
and 
continuously 
made 
grant 
awards months after they were ex-
pected. As a result, the entire process 
for utilizing those funds to conduct 
planning, reviews, and construction 
has been delayed for long periods. 
This legislation requires that for 
both the State of Good Repair program

and the Consolidated Rail Infrastruc-
ture and Safety Improvements pro-
gram, the Department of Transpor-
tation issue notices about the avail-
ability of funds and provide those funds 
within a set period of time after this 
bill goes into effect, which will stop 
DOT from slow-walking this important 
process. 
Finally, the Federal Transit Admin-
istration currently requires that a 
project receive a medium or higher rat-
ing before it finalizes an environmental 
impact statement that is critical for 
that project to move forward but often 
then refuses to grant Gateway projects 
that rating. This bill prohibits the FTA 
from making this requirement for the 
environmental impact statement. 
We have a tremendous opportunity to 
green-light funding for the critical rail 
projects of the future with smart in-
vestments now. 
I thank Chairwoman LOWEY and the 
committee for the great work they 
have done with this legislation, and I 
hope we can pass this bill that is so im-
portant for the residents of New Jersey 
and the Nation. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I claim the time in opposition 
to the amendment, although I am not 
opposed to the amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the gentleman from North 
Carolina is recognized for 5 minutes. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of this amendment. The Federal- 
State partnership for State of Good Re-
pair Competitive Grant program is 
vital to improving passenger rail infra-
structure all along Amtrak’s Northeast 
Corridor and across the Nation. 
I have traveled firsthand to see the 
Portal Bridge, the Hudson tunnels, the 
other infrastructure on the Northeast 
Corridor that we must upgrade as part 
of the critical Gateway program. This 
corridor is significant not just to New 
York, not just to New Jersey, but to 
the entire Nation’s economy. 
At the request of my colleague from 
New Jersey—whose amendment I com-
mend—and others from the region, this 
bill includes important new flexibili-
ties in the program which should help 
jump-start rail projects. 
The bill rejects the administration’s 
flawed decision to restrict project eli-
gibility to final design and construc-
tion activities and makes important 
early-stage project activities like de-
sign, engineering, environmental stud-
ies, and acquiring rights of way eligible 
for funding. 
Given the strain the coronavirus pan-
demic has placed on the budgets of 
State and local governments, Amtrak, 
and others, the bill eliminates the se-
lection preference for projects which 
have a 50 percent or higher non-Federal 
match. 
The bill also provides strong funding 
through other programs which could 
advance the rail infrastructure projects 
that make up the Gateway program, 
including $5.75 billion for Amtrak’s 
Northeast Corridor, $7.2 billion for Cap-
ital Investment Grants (CIGs), $5.5 bil-
lion for CRISI, and $4 billion for the 
BUILD program. 
In addition, the bill directs the ad-
ministration to administer the CIG 
program as required by law, including 
a prohibition on requiring that certain 
financial metrics be met for projects 
before they finalize environmental re-
views. 
So I commend my colleague for her 
amendment. I look forward to working 
with her and others with a strong in-
terest in this matter to support invest-
ments in Gateway and other important 
rail infrastructure all across this coun-
try.

ance of my time.

Mr. MOULTON. Madam Speaker, I

Deacon Kane served as an Army in-

Boston. He ministered to inmates and 
learned Spanish to reach more people. 
Later in life, he organized mission trips 
abroad. 
Deacon William Kane served us, but 
we failed him. On May 10, he died from 
the coronavirus while under the care of 
the Veterans Administration. He is 
among the 2,083 veterans in the VA’s 
care that this virus has killed. 
It is on us to use the powers of this 
body to protect veterans, and everyone, 
from this virus. We must get to the 
bottom of the mistakes at the VA that 
allowed the virus to spread. It is the 
least we can do for the memory of Dea-
con William Francis Xavier Kane.

HONORING FIRST RESPONDERS 
(Mr. KELLER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to share a remarkable story of 
heroism by our first responders in 
Pennsylvania’s 12th Congressional Dis-
trict. 
On the evening of Saturday, Feb-
ruary 15, 2020, in Jersey Shore, Penn-
sylvania, a multiple alarm fire was re-
ported at the Broadway Hotel and Res-
taurant, quickly engulfing the building 
and the multiple residential apart-
ments in the upper levels of the struc-
ture. 
The situation quickly escalated as 
reports indicated that a man was 
trapped on the third floor. 
With complete disregard for their 
own well-being, Chief Howard Fausey 
and Assistant Chief Ethan Goodbrod of 
Citizen’s Hose Company Station 45, 
Jason Clarke, and Ron Daley of Inde-
pendent Hose Company, and Patrolman 
Shawn Hummer took decisive action 
knowing life was at stake. 
Under thick smoke and extreme heat, 
the firefighters breached the structure, 
retrieved and extracted the victim 
while sharing their oxygen with the 
man due to overwhelming conditions. 
I am happy to report that the victim 
has recovered from his injuries and is 
undoubtedly alive today because of the 
bravery of these men. 
We can all sleep safer knowing that 
there are dedicated and selfless first re-
sponders that stand ready to give their 
lives for ours. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Chief 
Fausey, Assistant Chief Goodbrod, fire-
fighters Jason Clarke and Ron Daley, 
Patrolman Shawn Hummer, the police 
department, and the responding compa-
nies for their service and heroism in 
the line of duty.

RECOGNIZING AUGOSTINA 
MALLOUS 
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to recognize Augostina Mallous on 
her many accomplishments. 
Augostina is currently a freshman 
journalism major at Hofstra University 
with a 4.0 grade average. Augostina is a 
member of the competitive dance team 
and 
practices 
50 
hours 
a 
week. 
Augostina is the former Miss New Jer-
sey’s Outstanding Teen and is the cur-
rent Miss Garden State. 
During this pandemic, Augostina has 
made a significant impact on our com-
munity. She not only organized a food 
drive for seniors to help deliver food to 
those in need, Augostina was also mak-
ing masks for Cape Regional and Shore 
Medical Hospitals, along with several 
nursing homes. 
Madam Speaker, Augostina exempli-
fies the virtues of compassion, honor, 
integrity, 
dignity, 
and 
sincerity. 
Augostina’s family, friends, and com-
munity are proud of her. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Augostina 
for her inspiration, and may God bless 
her.

HONORING THE LIFE OF DENNIS 
SHACKELFORD 
(Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor 
the life of Dennis Shackelford, who 
passed away last week. 
I got to know Dennis very well dur-
ing my first campaign for Congress 
when he ran for State Representative 
in 2012. Though he was unsuccessful in 
his campaign, our friendship continued. 
Dennis was a small business owner 
for 30 years, running Hallmark stores 
across central Illinois, including in my 
hometown of Taylorville. After that 
successful career as a small business 
owner, he continued working in the 
banking industry in the Springfield, Il-
linois, area. 
Dennis served his community being 
elected to the Lincoln Land Commu-
nity College board in 2013, and later he 
rose to chairman while serving stu-
dents across central Illinois. Dennis 
was also elected a trustee for Roch-
ester Township. 
Dennis was a great friend, deeply in-
volved in his community, whether it 
was coaching baseball, youth baseball, 
or 
mentoring 
high 
schoolers, 
and 
countless others throughout his life. 
My condolences extend to his wife, 
Judy, his son, Andrew, and his three 
daughters, Amy, Lindsey, and Emily as 
well as his extended family. Dennis was 
one of a kind and will be deeply missed 
by all.

ISSUES OF THE DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. ROY) is recognized for 60 minutes 
as the designee of the minority leader. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I yield to 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
GARCIA). 
Mr. GARCIA of California. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my distinguished col-
league from Texas for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I stand here this 
evening inspired. More specifically, I 
am proud, and I am in awe of our 
American space program and the mon-
umental step that they took this morn-
ing with the launch of the Persever-
ance Mars rover on the back of an 
Atlas V rocket. But the rover is just 
one element of this amazing story. 
While humans have lived on this 
planet for millions of years, it was a 
mere 117 years ago when Americans 
were the first to solve the mystery of 
sustained, powered flight in our own 
atmosphere. That is a mere blink of an 
eye in the long arc of our planet and 
our own species’ history. Now, just a 
few hours ago, besides the rover vehi-
cle, we also launched a small heli-
copter named Ingenuity that will ulti-
mately fly in the atmosphere of an-
other planet. 
Madam Speaker, we will operate a 
helicopter on Mars. We will also collect 
samples of the Martian terrain and 
eventually return those samples back 
to Earth in about 6 years for further 
study. 
However, even while I and so many 
others applaud and celebrate these 
American successes, others question 
our pursuit of such endeavors amid the 
COVID–19 pandemic and the resulting 
economic challenges thereof. They see 
this endeavor as unnecessary to our 
survival. 
My response to those individuals is 
simple: You haven’t been paying atten-
tion. You haven’t been paying atten-
tion to what makes this country the 
greatest country this world has ever 
seen. 
As Americans, we carry an inherent 
desire 
to 
push 
ourselves 
forward 
through adversity. In mankind’s evolu-
tionary journey from the caves all the 
way up now to Mars, there is no great-
er enemy to the American spirit than 
complacency and self-doubt. 
Madam Speaker, when you look back 
upon our Nation’s history, the truth is 
that there has always been a conflict 
or a reason not to reach further to-
wards the next milestone of monu-
mental exploration. But we have never 
let that stop us before, and we cannot 
allow it to stop us now. 
With this mission to Mars, we are in-
spired not only by the journey, not 
only by the machinery, not only by 
technology and this marvelous team 
that got us here, but by the very name 
of the rover vehicle: Perseverance. You 
see, this morning’s launch of this pre-
cious payload, the combined efforts of 
the thousands of Americans over the 
last 10 years working for NASA, the 
Jet 
Propulsion 
Laboratory, 
United 
Launch Alliance, and others is about to 
payoff, despite the many technical 
challenges, as well as the challenges 
that COVID–19 produced.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4180 
July 30, 2020 
Just days after the 51st anniversary 
of the Apollo 11 Moon landing, we once 
again sent American hardware beyond 
the surly bonds of Earth toward an-
other landmark mission. 
And while we celebrate this achieve-
ment of American innovation and our 
ability to work through challenging 
and seemingly impossible problems, we 
must also remain vigilant. While our 
aim and our mission are admirable, not 
every country carries that same pas-
sion and desire for peaceful explo-
ration. We need look no further than 
the Chinese Communist Government 
and their willingness to antagonize us 
while continuing to increase their foot-
print in the vacuum of space. Madam 
Speaker, they are not a near-peer 
threat; they are, in fact, a peer threat, 
especially in this domain. 
It is too great a threat to our na-
tional security and the rest of the 
world to let their efforts go unmatched 
or uncontested. 
For the sake of science and the de-
fense of our precious planet, we must 
persevere. 
What sets the United States of Amer-
ica apart from the rest of the world is 
our resolve, our ingenuity, and our 
commitment to progress for noble mis-
sions. 
I spoke earlier of the American spir-
it. It is a story of exploration, and it is 
a story we haven’t finished writing. We 
continue the next chapter so that our 
children and our children’s children 
may know what it means to succeed 
where others thought we would stum-
ble to accomplish what others thought 
was impossible. 
And as we meet here today, two as-
tronauts continue to orbit overhead 
thanks to a successful SpaceX rocket 
launch a couple of weeks ago that 
launched American astronauts from 
our soil to the International Space Sta-
tion. Those astronauts will return in 
just a few short days, and today we 
continue writing the story for future 
generations with yet another mission 
to Mars in parallel. 
To not only land on Mars, but also 
fly a helicopter in the Martian atmos-
phere, we should take pride in this. 
We can hold Communist China ac-
countable and limit its dangerous 
power grab. We can survive COVID–19 
and develop and deliver a vaccine to 
our entire country as well as the world, 
and we can continue to persevere in 
our quest to become a multiplanetary 
species. We can do all of the above, and 
we will. 
History will not forgive us if we fail 
to do so. 
Madam Speaker, this evening I say, 
Godspeed to the Perseverance team and 
the thousands who have supported to-
day’s successful launch. With over a 
decade of preparation, today they dem-
onstrated the true meaning of Amer-
ican perseverance. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I appre-
ciate the gentleman from California 
bringing up this important topic. The 
news these days tend to be filled—it is 
not often filled with positive things 
that we ought to be celebrating to-
gether as Americans and the great ac-
complishments that we are achieving 
together, the great accomplishments 
we are achieving on a completely non-
partisan basis and advancing our con-
tinued exploration. 
Jim Bridenstine is a friend of mine. I 
am just thrilled with what he is doing 
with NASA. I am certainly thrilled to 
be seeing that we are returning to 
space vigorously and that we are doing 
so actively, and I just appreciate their 
service. I love the rich tradition, the 
connection between NASA and our 
military. 
Madam Speaker, I know that Mr. 
GARCI´A
is a veteran of our United 
States Navy, and I thank him for his 
service. I appreciate him joining me 
here tonight. 
Madam Speaker, I come down here 
tonight for a few reasons. 
First of all, a few weeks ago, a young 
lady, a 20-year-old named Rebekah 
Wendt was campaigning in west Texas 
with another young fellow from Trin-
ity University. I represent Trinity Uni-
versity in San Antonio. I got a call 
from my staff assistant, Jonah Wendt, 
that his sister had been killed an hour 
or two before in a car accident in west 
Texas. 
I will have more to say about Re-
bekah in the future, but she was a 
bright star and a great defender of this 
country, out working hard, volun-
teering, as many of our young folks do, 
on campaigns. She was a member of 
the Young Conservatives of Texas. She 
was majoring in history. She and an-
other young fellow, again, I will talk 
more about, Tyler, was with her. They 
were out trying to make this country 
better. They were out trying to get 
someone they believed in elected. They 
were trying to change this country for 
the better by standing up for Texas, 
standing up for this country. 
I want to celebrate her life, and 
again, I want to do it more in the fu-
ture, but her brother, Jonah, and his 
twin brother, Manfred, are very dear to 
me and worked hard on my campaign 2 
years ago and continue to serve this 
country as well as serving in support of 
me. 
And I mention that because I do want 
to talk more about her another time, 
but I mention that because it got me to 
thinking about what this is all about, 
what we are doing. 
Now, for those few people at home 
watching on C–SPAN, I am here alone, 
mostly, in the Chamber with the excep-
tion of the Speaker and my friend from 
California. And I think about Rebekah, 
and I think about all of those young 
Americans out there working hard 
every day, trying to get someone elect-
ed or go fight for what they believe in. 
And that is what this is about. This is 
the people’s House. This is the House of 
Representatives. It is really an unbe-
lievable institution when you think 
about what it meant in the history of 
the world. 
I was in Independence Hall on July 
2nd. I went up there because I wanted 
to be up there when I was watching so 
many of our monuments and so many 
of our statues under attack, and it is 
not the marble, it is not the mortar, it 
is not the bricks that matter, it was 
the ideals represented there. 
I went up to Independence Hall, and 
it was on July 2nd, which many will 
know is the day we separated from the 
crown, the day of the actual vote. And 
the folks there were very kind to me. 
They were closed down because of what 
we are dealing with with the virus. 
They were very kind and allowed me to 
go into Independence Hall. I had the 
great blessing of being in Independence 
Hall on July 2nd, 244 years to the day 
of the vote. Then I got to go over to 
the other room, which is a different 
room, where the first five Congresses of 
the United States met. Then, of course, 
we have a history of then moving on to 
different capitols, and we ended up 
here. And we have been in this Cham-
ber for, I don’t know the history as 
well as I should, but 100 years or some-
thing in this Chamber. 
This people’s House, in my opinion, is 
failing the people of the United States. 
I am going to say that again. The peo-
ple’s House, the 435 Representatives 
that make up this half of Congress, 
one-half of one-third of the Federal 
Government is failing the American 
people. It is failing the American peo-
ple because we literally never debate. 
We literally never offer amendments 
and have any debate here on this floor. 
We are ruled by a handful of folks who 
meet in rooms in back chambers, drop 
bills on the floor of the House and then 
demand we come down and vote on 
them. By the way, that is both Demo-
crats and Republicans. 
The people’s House is supposed to be 
the people’s House. We are supposed to 
actually debate, engage. 
Do you want to know why things are 
so broken? 
It is because if you even dare think 
about offering an amendment to a bill, 
you have got to go to some Rules Com-
mittee to get blessed to be able to even 
have the ability to offer it. You will 
get shut down in Rules Committee, and 
then there is never any debate. 
b 2100 
What kind of a people’s House is 
that? I would posit that it is not one. 
We have so many issues right now 
that are tearing our country apart. 
Why? Because there is no leadership 
coming from the Representatives sent 
to Washington to represent the people. 
None. 
If there were leadership, we would 
have actual debate. We would actually 
sit down here and come up with ideas, 
offer solutions, and then hammer them 
out. We would actually sit down at a 
table like a small business or sit down 
at a table like a family and balance a 
budget. We would have a debate about 
the proper policies to deal with a pan-
demic instead of pointing fingers and 
politicizing a virus.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4181 
July 30, 2020 
In what universe do you politicize a 
virus? Yet that is precisely what the 
leaders of this great and august coun-
try have done. 
Everyone 
in 
America 
is 
sitting 
around wondering what on Earth has 
happened that we are now deciding how 
we make policy based on polls and re-
actions to whatever the President says 
or whatever Speaker PELOSI says. 
It is absolutely amazing. The needle 
moved when President Trump said that 
we ought to open our schools. Simple 
notion: Let’s open up our schools. 
Why might that be important? I 
don’t know. How about for all the 
working-class Americans who can’t af-
ford daycare and are trying to figure 
out how to have their children get edu-
cated. 
Why aren’t we having a robust debate 
about that instead of just pointing fin-
gers and saying, ‘‘Uh-oh. Be afraid’’? 
But that is what we are doing. 
It is really easy for all the latte- 
drinking, Peloton-riding, Volvo-driving 
White Americans to run around going 
off and saying: ‘‘Oh, I am going to go 
by and get my little drink, but some-
body is serving me. And those people 
serving me, how are they going to have 
their kids get educated?’’ 
It ain’t going to be if we don’t open 
our schools. 
Can I tell you, Madam Speaker, what 
they are doing in Austin, Texas? This 
is how genius it is in Austin, Texas. 
They are saying we can’t open our 
schools until late September or some 
undetermined 
date. 
Oh, 
but 
don’t 
worry. We will open the buildings, 
allow the YMCA to go in, hold a group 
forum there to watch virtual edu-
cation—which now, by the way, I am 
seeing all sorts of stories of teachers 
saying: ‘‘Well, we don’t want to do the 
virtual education either.’’ 
What are we doing for our children? 
Why aren’t we debating this right now 
instead 
of 
having, 
‘‘Oh, 
President 
Trump 
said 
we 
should 
open 
our 
schools,’’ so we are going to have a 20 
percent swing in how we view opening 
our schools? 
In what universe does that statement 
by the President change what we 
should be doing as the people’s House 
about opening our schools? Yet, that is 
precisely what happened. 
We have a current environment in 
the United States of America where 
the very rule of law, which attracts 
people from all over the world to come 
here, is being trampled upon by peo-
ple—frankly, often self-identifying as 
Marxists—but people who are ravaging 
cities, 
literally 
undermining 
the 
health, security, safety, community of 
our cities, our States, our homes. A 
Federal courthouse is being targeted 
and burned in Portland. 
Now, what happens? Again, it be-
comes politicized. In what universe is 
that political? I mean, I would suggest 
to anybody, go look at anything I have 
ever said about federalism or about re-
specting States and respecting local 
powers to make decisions that are best 
for the people. 
But there is another point to all of 
this, which is the Constitution talks 
about securing the blessings of liberty. 
It talks about what we are supposed to 
do as a Nation in terms of defending 
the rule of law. 
Of course, the Federal Government 
should defend the Federal courthouse 
in Portland. To say otherwise is pat-
ently absurd. 
Yet, what did my Democratic col-
leagues do this week? What did they do 
when the Attorney General of the 
United States was here before the 
House Judiciary Committee but sit 
there and talk over him and mock him 
and relentlessly stand on the side of 
lawless Marxists who are trying to de-
stroy a city of the United States of 
America instead of standing up along-
side our law enforcement. 
What are we doing? What are we 
doing as a country? 
We are in an empty Chamber with 
three votes today at 6:30 tonight, two 
votes or three votes tomorrow, and 
then head home. And then what? Be 
gone for August while our businesses 
burn, literally and figuratively, while 
millions of Americans don’t have jobs? 
Why are we going to adjourn? Why 
have we only met something like 15 out 
of the last 100 days, or whatever it has 
been? 
It is an absolute embarrassment 
what has become of the people’s House. 
We should be ashamed. We should be 
ashamed that we are not here doing the 
work of the American people. 
More importantly, we should be 
ashamed that when we are here, we are 
not sitting down at a table and work-
ing through the issues of the day based 
on the rule of law, based on the Con-
stitution, based on the Declaration, 
based on our job as Representatives to 
represent the people of the United 
States. 
Our police officers stand up to defend 
the rule of law. People come from all 
over the globe here. Why? Is it for what 
is enumerated in the Bill of Rights? Is 
it for what was enumerated, or laid 
out, in the Declaration of Independ-
ence, those unalienable rights? Yes. 
It is all of those things, and it is 
equal justice under the law, all the 
things that we should be fighting to 
strive for in order to reach those ideals 
that, by the way, we will never reach 
because we are flawed men and women. 
My faith teaches me that. But they are 
the ideals that we will constantly 
strive to reach. 
It is why, when I went to Independ-
ence Hall, I was proud to stand up and 
say this is a great thing that happened 
here. I will never back away from de-
fending the United States of America. 
I stopped off where Francis Scott Key 
wrote our national anthem, and I did a 
video there. I am not going to back 
away from defending our national an-
them and defending our history. 
I went from there to the Jefferson 
Memorial. I went to the Roosevelt 
monument. I went to the Lincoln Me-
morial. 
Two days ago, I took my 10-year-old 
son and my 9-year-old daughter to Mt. 
Vernon so they could see the home of 
the Father of our Country, George 
Washington, where I unapologetically 
taught my children about the great-
ness of our first President. It is impor-
tant, that part. I unapologetically 
taught my children about the great-
ness of our country and of the Father 
of our Country. 
We are all flawed. We always will be 
because we are men and women. We are 
made in the image of God, but we are 
not God. And thank the Lord that he 
sent his son so that I might have eter-
nal life because I am flawed. But we 
should not look at our country with 
shame or disregard because we have 
made mistakes. 
Yet, the other side of the aisle seems 
hellbent on tearing down this great 
country brick by brick, statue by stat-
ue, thread by thread of our flag, word 
by word of our anthem. 
It is a mockery of this House. 
How on Earth can you explain to a 
veteran who is missing limbs, who bled 
in the Middle East or bled at Nor-
mandy or bled in the Pacific? How can 
you explain to a veteran that our coun-
try is bad? 
Our country is not bad. Our country 
is great. Our country has done more for 
more men and more women than any 
other nation in the history of the 
world. I will debate that anywhere, 
anytime, with anyone who cares to ac-
tually have a debate in this so-called 
people’s House. I will not sit here and 
listen to supposed representatives of 
this country tear her down. 
Right now, we have people who are 
hurting because of the virus, people 
who are hurting because they have lost 
jobs, people who are hurting because 
their businesses have gone out of busi-
ness, people who are hurting because 
streets have been torn down or burned 
or because we have allowed looting to 
occur in the false name of social jus-
tice. 
What are we doing for them? Ad-
journing? Heading home to campaign 
so that people can score political 
points? 
I have had people on my own side of 
the aisle say perhaps they shouldn’t do 
bills or work with certain Members on 
the other side of the aisle. Why? Be-
cause they don’t want us to avoid the 
ability to score political points. 
I know that has happened on the 
other side of the aisle. How do I know 
that? Because DEAN PHILLIPS, a very 
good man, and I worked together to 
pass the Paycheck Protection Program 
Flexibility Act. And DEAN, to his great 
credit, because he is a gentleman, de-
ferred to me to introduce the bill be-
cause we had been working on the leg-
islative part, and he was working on 
the political part. We were working to-
gether. So, I introduced the bill. 
We had worked to get to an agree-
ment. It was going to move through 
this Chamber. Ah, but it couldn’t be in 
the name of the Republican freshman

from Texas, who, by the way, is in a 
district that might be on the hot list 
for the DCCC. 
Coincidence that they then took the 
same language and dropped it into an-
other bill with my friend from Min-
nesota—no fault of his own—and put it 
under his name and then said, ‘‘Great. 
Let’s move it through’’? And it passed 
417–1. 
Yes, Madam Speaker, I am looking at 
Congressman MASSIE, with a little bit 
of love. 
Why? This is what the American peo-
ple are sick and tired of. They are lit-
erally just sick of it. 
We can disagree, and we are going to 
disagree. DEAN
and I disagree. The 
Speaker pro tempore and I disagree on 
issues. But we also agree. 
I was proud to join the Speaker pro 
tempore in January, along with DEAN 
and another Democrat, three Repub-
licans and an independent. You can 
guess who the independent was. Why? 
To write an op-ed in The Washington 
Post saying: Hold on here. Maybe we 
should rethink a 20-year-old Authoriza-
tion for Use of Military Force. 
Now, do I have all the answers to 
what we should do in Afghanistan, 
Iraq, Syria, Iran? I do not. It is okay to 
say that, by the way. It is okay to say 
you don’t have all the answers. 
But we got together to say maybe, 
just maybe we should rethink 20-year- 
old authorizations of force when there 
are men and women who are now en-
listing who weren’t alive when we 
passed them. 
Just a couple of weeks ago, we had a 
12-tour veteran, I think a marine, who 
killed himself. Twelve tours, Madam 
Speaker. 
What are we doing? Why aren’t we 
having a debate about that? 
With all due respect to some of my 
friends on this side of the aisle, endless 
wars are not an answer. Neither is al-
lowing bad actors to run amok around 
the world against our national security 
interests or that of our allies. 
So why must it always be, when we 
get to budget time: ‘‘Well, we have to 
have more money. We are going to 
keep defense. We are going to keep 
things going. We are going to have 
OCO. We are going to do this. We are 
going to spend more money to keep the 
wars going, whatever DOD wants’’? 
Why is it on the other side of the 
aisle too often: ‘‘Well, an endless 
amount of dollars for nondefense dis-
cretionary spending, but whatever. We 
don’t care about $26 trillion of debt. 
Let’s just pass a bill. Let’s just get it 
done so we can do something. And you 
get what you want, and you get what 
you want, and we spend another extra 
trillion dollars’’? 
By the way, Madam Speaker, I would 
say to the gentleman from Arizona 
(Mr. SCHWEIKERT), a trillion dollars 
sounds kind of quaint, doesn’t it? A 
trillion dollars sounds kind of quaint 
now. 
I don’t even know where we are. Does 
anybody in this Chamber have the first 
clue what our national deficit is going 
to be this year? No. 
We don’t have a clue because we are 
spending money hand over fist. Why? 
Because we are trying to deal with a 
pandemic that, frankly, our own public 
actions and public governments are 
causing a hell of a lot of the very dam-
age we are trying to bail out. State and 
local governments are taking actions, 
which basically are tantamount to 
takings, shutting down people’s liveli-
hoods. Then, they just walk away and 
shake their hands, and they go, ‘‘Well, 
I guess the Federal Government will 
bail them out.’’ 
Governors, 
mayors: 
‘‘Sorry, 
bars, 
shut down. Sorry, restaurants, shut 
down. Sorry, barbershops, shut down. 
Sorry, live music venues, shut down. 
Sorry, artists who have to sing in the 
live music venue, you are shut down. 
Sorry, churches, you can’t worship.’’ 
b 2115 
Madam Speaker, I am sitting here in 
this Chamber, wondering what it is 
going to take for the House of Rep-
resentatives to actually represent. We 
don’t govern. That is not what we do in 
America. We represent. 
We each represent whatever we rep-
resent, 700,000, 800,000 people, depending 
on the district. We are here to share 
their values and beliefs and reach some 
point of actual responsible leadership 
and do our job. 
But I have to say something here. 
The President of the United States, he 
draws a lot of fire. The President of the 
United States ran in 2016 on what? 
Build the wall. Drain the swamp. 
And what does drain the swamp 
mean? I would tell you that, whatever 
you think of the President, drain the 
swamp means everything I am just 
talking about and 1,000 other things 
that are irritating the American people 
every single day about why this gov-
ernment, and particularly this Con-
gress, can’t do its job, why bureaucrats 
stand in the way of what the people 
want, why judges make up the law, and 
why Congress can’t balance a budget. 
That is the swamp. 
The swamp represents the frustration 
of the American people who, while ex-
tremely willing to have people come to 
this country with open arms, also want 
their border to be secure. They don’t 
want cartels running the border. They 
don’t want 900,000 people coming to our 
border being apprehended and having 
to deal with it. They don’t want cartels 
to abuse women and children on the 
journey. They don’t want fentanyl 
pouring across our border, and that is 
the state of our border. 
If the President of the United States 
should dare to say we should have a se-
cure 
border, 
what 
happened? 
Col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
went to the border and lied about the 
state of the border with respect to kids 
in cages and kids drinking out of toi-
lets. 
I went there. My chief of staff went 
down there the week after claims were 
made about kids drinking out of toi-
lets, and they were toilets that have 
water fountains attached to them. 
But this is the hyperbole that drives 
public opinion, gets out in social 
media, and undermines the one thing 
that almost all Americans understand 
is critically important, and that is to 
have border security where cartels 
don’t run our border. That is not a con-
troversial statement. 
By the way, it is not just my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle. 
There are a whole lot of people on my 
side of the aisle who love to sit there at 
the Rio Grande and have a little sign 
that says ‘‘no trespassing,’’ and then 
they wink, wink, nod, nod, over here, 
and they have a ‘‘help wanted’’ sign. 
How about we have an honest con-
versation about what a secure border 
looks like? Why don’t we sit down at a 
table and actually do that? I am sick 
and tired of Republicans who 10 years 
ago were saying to those of us who 
thought we should have a secure border 
because we knew what was happening, 
and we saw what the cartels were 
doing, and we saw the hordes of human 
trafficking, and we saw the dead bodies 
in deserts, and people in our own party 
were saying: Well, fences are a 19th 
century solution to a 21st century 
problem. 
Now, because it is a politically 
charged thing, the President is for it 
and it has become partisan, they say: 
Well, yeah, we are all for it. 
When are we going to do our job, Re-
publicans and Democrats, to do that, 
to secure the border of the United 
States, not because we don’t want to 
welcome immigrants, but because it is 
the responsible thing for a government 
to do? 
Why would we let the Reynosa fac-
tion of the Gulf cartel run the border 
in the Rio Grande Valley? That is pre-
cisely what we are doing. 
Why would we allow fentanyl to pour 
across the border? Why would we allow 
addicts in our country to have a con-
stant supply coming through from 
Mexico, across our border, through 
Texas, through Arizona, through to 
Mexico, through California? Why would 
we do that? It defies all rationality. It 
makes no sense. Yet, that is what we 
do, and the American people are sick 
and tired of it. 
Giving credit where it is due, the 
President of the United States has 
tried to attack that problem, and he 
has met resistance from the swamp at 
every turn. He has met resistance from 
our Democratic colleagues, met resist-
ance from bureaucrats at DHS, met re-
sistance from bureaucrats throughout 
the administration when he is trying 
to do what the American people elected 
him to do. 
When we stand up saying that we 
should defend the rule of law and stand 
beside law enforcement, what happens? 
The swamp pushes back and says: No, 
we can’t do that. 
Heaven forbid we have Federal law 
enforcement protecting a courthouse. 
Who would have thought?

July 30, 2020 
The swamp pushes back. Right now, 
we are facing the struggles that we are 
dealing with, with respect to the pan-
demic. 
I suspect that my friend from Ari-
zona is here to talk a little bit about 
the data on that. I could be wrong. I 
think I am right. 
There is a lot of stuff that we should 
be looking at about this virus. It is a 
virus. It is not something you bottle up 
into a Tupperware container and put 
on the shelf. It is a virus. It is out. It 
is among us. It is in all 50 States. It is 
in every city and town. It is a virus. 
What are we going to do as a country 
to work through it? Cower in fear? Be 
afraid to actually look at the data? Be 
afraid to actually talk to doctors who 
might have an opposing or different 
view than the powers that be at the 
CDC or the NIH? 
Let me be clear. I don’t know Dr. 
Fauci other than having interacted 
with him in a hearing or a setting like 
this. I don’t know Dr. Birx other than 
similarly engaging as an official. But 
they are not the President. They are 
not an elected Member of Congress. 
They are not an elected Member of the 
Senate. 
Why aren’t we having hearings with 
different alternative views from other 
health professionals, other doctors? 
There is a large number of doctors, not 
insignificant, with differing opinions: 
Ioannidis at Stanford University; Scott 
Atlas at Stanford; Oxford put out re-
cent reports; Dr. Risch at Yale, talking 
about the possible efficacy and success 
with HCQ, hydroxychloroquine. 
I am not a doctor. I don’t know 
whether HCQ works, but I would like 
to know. And I would like to have the 
right to try. Why is it, in the United 
States of America, a supposedly free 
country, a doctor cannot prescribe HCQ 
in certain circumstances? Or why are 
States preventing that? Or why are 
doctors at the CDC or NIH preventing 
that when there is evidence, studies, to 
the contrary, when it is sold off-the- 
shelf in other countries around the 
world because it is a malaria medicine? 
Why would we not have a debate 
about that? You have doctors going 
across the street at the Supreme Court 
of the United States, doing a press con-
ference. I don’t know them, but they 
are doctors, M.D.s, and they give a 
press conference saying how they think 
HCQ works as a prophylactic. 
What happens? It is censored by Big 
Tech, shut down as being potentially 
misleading. Does that not concern my 
colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle? 
That is a genuine question that I 
would actually like to know the answer 
to. But I won’t know because the 200- 
and-some-odd colleagues are out doing 
whatever they are doing right now, 
going to dinner, doing their thing, 
going home, will come in tomorrow. 
We will rush in here, and we will 
have three votes. We will never actu-
ally debate it, will we? We will not ac-
tually debate it. 
Instead, everybody will go to Twit-
ter. Everybody will go to the press con-
ferences. People will point. They will 
call doctors crazy. They will say it is 
no good, and we will never know, or we 
won’t know unless we fight through it 
to try to figure it out ourselves, not 
doing the hard work of this body to fig-
ure out whether HCQ is a good prophy-
lactic or not. 
Again, I am not advocating for it. I 
am advocating for—it is unbelievable 
to have to say this—I am advocating 
for actually investigating it, debating 
it, finding the truth, and not censoring 
it. 
But that is what is happening. Why 
are we always saying how bad we are 
doing as a country right now? For the 
longest time: ‘‘We are not testing. We 
are not testing. We are not testing.’’ 
We have done over 50 million tests. Are 
they the right tests? Are we testing the 
right way? Maybe we should have a 
good, robust debate about that. 
But we had over 50 million tests. We 
are testing at a rate only surpassed by, 
I think, three other countries. I think 
we are fourth. I could be wrong. I think 
that is right. 
No, the rate, the testing, we are 
fourth. We have 50 million tests, more 
than any other country in the world. 
We are testing by the thousands in 
Texas. And all the eyes have been re-
cently on Florida, Texas, and Arizona. 
Again, I am sure my friend from Ari-
zona will have some data on this, but 
these States which have had, yes, an 
increase in the last several weeks, 
tragically, we are concerned. We are 
watching it. Our Governor is all over 
it. We are paying attention to it, but it 
has become a political football. 
The total numbers in all of those 
States still pale in comparison to New 
York and New Jersey, in terms of fa-
talities. I have no real interest in sit-
ting here and pointing fingers at the 
Democratic Governor of New York or 
the mayor of New York, talking about 
how they failed versus how we suc-
ceeded or not succeeded, or whatever. 
Why are we doing that? 
Why aren’t we just sitting down to-
gether and working together to try to 
figure out what the right policies are? 
Dare I talk about masks? Am I al-
lowed to talk about masks? It is a gen-
uine question. Am I actually allowed to 
talk about masks? Yet, the Speaker of 
the House of Representative said—by 
the way, putting aside our constitu-
tional duty to represent our constitu-
ents and vote on the floor of this 
House—that somehow that is a breach 
of decorum. 
And oh, by the way, I am sure all the 
12 viewers of this, when they take their 
viewers, my opponents will all say: 
‘‘Oh, he is an anti-masker.’’ 
I have had this mask since April. My 
wife sewed a HEPA filter in here. It is 
a really good mask. It is not one of 
those flimsy old cotton masks that, by 
the way, were made fun of or said were 
inadequate by the NIH 5 years ago in a 
study. 
Yet, we go around, and as long as you 
virtue signal that you are wearing a 
cotton mask, everybody says: Aren’t 
you really important? Aren’t you just 
loving your country? 
Are we doing what we are supposed to 
do to actually make our country safer? 
Does anybody here know for certain? 
Does anybody know when I am sitting 
on an airplane, and the guy two rows 
over has a cotton mask kind of dan-
gling down—it is just sitting there. 
And, oh, the flight attendant says, 
‘‘Good job. You got your mask on.’’ Is 
that making me safer? 
How about when you wear an N95 
mask with one of those little valves? 
Have we finally gotten around to the 
side of saying: Oh, we all raced to get 
those, but no, you have got the valve. 
It is kicking too much air out, and 
that is going to hurt people? 
Why am I saying all that? I am not 
saying don’t wear a mask. What I am 
saying is, for goodness sake, this isn’t 
the gospel handed down as to what pre-
cisely is the right way to do it when 
our own Dr. Fauci was questioning 
masks mere months ago, when our own 
NIH was questioning it, when there was 
report after report about it, when Den-
mark and Sweden and Finland and all 
of these other Nordic countries aren’t 
wearing masks. 
‘‘Oh, no, he is talking about masks. 
He is an anti-masker.’’ That is what it 
is all about now. Get on Twitter, bash 
somebody. They are a nutball. 
When are we going to look at the 
data and try to do the thing that we 
need to do to lead this country for-
ward? Do we know what we are doing 
to children right now? Do we have any 
idea? 
We have our own CDC Director talk-
ing about the number of suicides out-
pacing the number of deaths from 
COVID. 
I love my 10-year-old son. I love my 
9-year-old daughter. I would give my 
life for them at any given moment, but 
they are going back to school on Au-
gust 20 because it is good for them. 
b 2130 
But there are so many children in 
this country who are not going to be 
going back to school because we have 
scared the bejesus out of the entire 
country. 
We are America. We cured polio. We 
put a man on the Moon. We beat Nazi 
Germany. We beat Japan. And we are 
cowering in the corner about a virus. 
Let’s look at the numbers. Let’s pro-
tect the elderly. Let’s protect the peo-
ple in nursing homes. But, for good-
ness’ sake, let’s open our schools, and 
don’t let teachers’ unions hide behind a 
virus to pretend they don’t want some-
thing else when they do, and we know 
they do. 
The President of the United States 
ought to call a hearing and bring in 
Scott Atlas, bring in Dr. Ioannidis, 
bring in Dr. Rishi, bring in some of the 
Oxford folks, and bring in other doctors 
to talk about the science. Let’s have a

full discussion about this. Let’s show 
the American people they can go back 
to work, they can go back to school, 
and they can do it safely. 
We are destroying our economy, the 
greatest economy in the history of the 
world. Forty-five percent of Black 
businesses have gone out of business 
over the last 5 months. 
Do you want to talk about Black 
lives mattering? How about those 45 
percent of businesses? 
I guess that doesn’t look good on the 
mound for Major League Baseball, does 
it? 
I guess that doesn’t fit on the back of 
a jersey for the NBA, does it? 
It doesn’t fit on one of those cute lit-
tle stickers that the NFL likes to put 
on their helmets so they can feel good 
about themselves as social justice war-
riors. 
Who cares about those families that 
are destroyed because their businesses 
are gone? 
But that is what we are doing by our 
own judgment and by our own deci-
sions. We should be ashamed. 
The people’s House. Look at it, 
Madam Speaker, it is empty. I don’t 
know who is running your C–SPAN 
cameras. Take a broad view. Show the 
American people the people’s House in 
all its glory, cycling in your Represent-
atives to come in like robots and vote 
and walk out and then vote and then 
walk out and spend all day voting but 
never actually debating or talking. 
By the way, 20 or 30 or 40 of them are 
voting from boats and voting from 
their homes using proxy voting. 
What is a proxy vote? 
I am glad you asked. A proxy vote is 
when someone isn’t actually doing 
their constitutional duty of voting 
here in this Chamber. A proxy vote is 
someone sitting at home and telling 
another Member to vote for them, dele-
gating the nondelegable. Our Constitu-
tion doesn’t provide for that. 
In 1793, our Founding Fathers were 
fighting yellow fever. Five thousand 
people had died in Philadelphia out of 
50,000—10 percent. Washington, Madi-
son, Jefferson, and Adams found a way 
to meet. They were debating: How can 
we do this adhering to the Constitu-
tion? 
Heaven forbid we adhere to the Con-
stitution. We have a duty to be in this 
Chamber. We have survived wars and 
we have survived other pandemics. 
This stuff isn’t foreign to me. My dad 
is a survivor of polio. It is real. He has 
got a tracheostomy. He walks with a 
limp and he can barely get around. But 
he is 77 years old, and he is alive be-
cause his mom fought through being a 
single mom in west Texas after she lost 
my grandfather, who died of cancer 
when my dad was 7, and here is my 
grandmother finding out her son has 
polio in September of 1949. 
My dad comes home from the hos-
pital to say good-bye to his dad, whom 
he had only known for 2 years because 
his dad had been in the Pacific theater. 
Then my grandmother runs and be-
comes the first woman elected county 
clerk in Nolan County, Texas. She 
helps my dad, gets up at 4 in the morn-
ing, goes and does therapy. He was the 
first to go on to college. I am the first 
to go on to graduate school, and here I 
am in Congress. 
It is the American story. It is the 
American story we ought to be proud 
to share, proud to push, and proud to 
champion. But instead we are sitting 
here in an empty Chamber running 
people through and voting on things 
that likely have no chance of becoming 
law. In fact, we know these appropria-
tions bills have no chance of becoming 
law. We know it. Yet we are showing 
the American people that we are 
‘‘doing something.’’ 
Do you want to know what the 
swamp is? It is that. It is a disease, 
Madam Speaker. Do somethingitis. We 
have to show the people we are doing 
something when you are doing literally 
nothing. That is what this Chamber is 
about. It should be about something 
better, more, and bigger. 
We can disagree violently about cer-
tain issues and policies, but why can’t 
we come together to balance our budg-
et? 
Why can’t we come together to figure 
out how to fight a pandemic without 
politicizing it? 
Yet that is precisely what we are 
doing. 
May I ask the Speaker how much 
time is remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Texas has 14 minutes re-
maining. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, it was 9 
years, last night, I was in an emer-
gency room in Austin, Texas. I had 
fluid on my lungs and I didn’t know 
what was going on. I found out 2 days 
later, 3 days later, it was likely, and 
then turned out to be, stage III Hodg-
kin’s lymphoma. It was kind of a curve 
ball one gets when you have got a 4- 
month-old daughter, 2-year-old son, 
and a wife scared out of her mind. 
I remember the prayers and I remem-
ber the calls. I remember all of it like 
it was yesterday. I can’t believe it has 
been 9 years. 
Governor Perry, for whom I worked 
at the time, couldn’t have been a bet-
ter man or gentleman trying to help us 
get through it. I went down to MD An-
derson and did a trial drug that is now 
the standard of care. I am alive today 
because of that and because of the 
great doctor I had at MD Anderson. 
I remember when going through that, 
of course, you don’t know what the 
outcome is going to be. It wasn’t until 
October I remember being down there 
with my wife when we got the news 
that the cancer was clear. I had to fin-
ish treatment through January of 2012. 
It changes your perspective. 
Now, everybody in this Chamber has 
personally dealt with something like 
that. I can’t even imagine what my 
friend ANDY BARR is going through in 
losing his lovely wife. I can’t imagine 
what folks who have known Represent-
ative Lewis for decades are going 
through. I can’t imagine what Chair-
man NADLER has been going through 
with his wife’s battle with cancer. We 
could go around the room. All of us 
deal with these kinds of things. 
But I will acknowledge that, for me, 
that was intensely personal, getting a 
cancer diagnosis at age whatever I was 
at the time, 39. But the reason I am 
bringing it up here is because as I 
think, through this virus right now—it 
is a virus. I know it is bad. I know it is 
scary. I know there are people who 
have lost loved ones. But our reaction 
to it does not represent the greatest of 
this country, in my opinion. 
I don’t mean that we are not testing 
enough or we are not getting enough 
announcements out about masks. I 
mean, loved ones who are dying alone. 
Let me be perfectly clear that if any 
of my loved ones get this virus, they 
are not dying alone. No local judge, no 
local mayor, no local Governor, no 
President, and no Member of this body 
is going to stop me from seeing my 
loved one. But that is because I am 
stubborn. But we are forcing that envi-
ronment on a lot of people who don’t 
know how to fight a system. 
Why would we allow that to happen 
in America? Why? 
But that is what we are doing. 
Why would we do what we are doing 
to children out of fear? 
Again, I promised myself I would lay 
down everything I have to defend and 
save this Republic for my kids and my 
grandkids, my now 10-year-old son and 
9-year-old daughter who are with me 
here this week. But I would be doing 
them a disservice if I held them back 
from going to school. 
I know all the arguments. Well, they 
go to school and then the teachers will 
take it home to someone else. 
Madam Speaker, if we look at the 
data, look at who is likely to get hit by 
this virus, we should be adults about 
this. We are leaders. We set the tone. 
Fear is not the tone we should be set-
ting as a nation. Yet that is precisely 
what we are doing. 
We should not be letting loved ones 
die alone. We should not be doing what 
we are doing to children. 
By the way, I talked about cancer. I 
was blessed that I got a diagnosis at 
stage III. 
What if I had been sick this year? 
What if it had gotten into my bones 
with stage IV? That is happening to 
Americans right now. 
Do we ever talk about that on the 
floor, or is everybody running around 
talking about 150,000 dead Americans 
because it is the President’s fault? 
Why aren’t we talking about the sui-
cide rates? Why aren’t we talking 
about the opioid addiction? Why aren’t 
we talking about the cancer screenings 
that aren’t occurring? Why aren’t we 
talking about the suicide? 
Veteran suicides are increasing. Peo-
ple are feeling alone, and it is scarring 
our children. That is not what a great 
country does.

July 30, 2020 
Madam Speaker, we are a great coun-
try, and we should darn well start act-
ing like it again. 
Let’s debate on the floor here what 
we should be doing with our military 
abroad authorizations of force. 
Let’s secure the border of the United 
States and not allow the swamp to 
stand in the way of common sense. 
Let’s stand up for law enforcement, 
secure our communities, and don’t let 
people run over streets and burn down 
buildings. 
Let’s stand up in the face of a virus. 
Let’s say we are going to defeat it, and 
let’s damn well defeat it. It is who we 
are as a people. It is in our DNA. It has 
been since our founding. It has been 
there through all the wars. It has been 
there through previous pandemics. And 
it is with us here now if we will just 
tap into it. 
This should not be partisan. I look at 
both directions when I say that. It 
should not be partisan. I cannot believe 
we are sitting here in an environment 
where we have allowed a virus to be-
come partisan, but that is precisely 
what we have done. 
Madam Speaker, I am not going to 
take up too much more time. I know 
that the gentleman from Arizona has 
been patiently waiting. I didn’t even 
start to bring up my charts and talk 
about numbers because I could never 
do battle with the gentleman from Ari-
zona when it comes to presenting that 
kind of information. I know he will do 
it well. 
But I do know this: We are a great 
country that is doing great things 
right now to combat this virus. I do 
know that my physician is a great 
man. Dr. Yunis grew up in Damascus, 
Syria. 
I asked Dr. Yunis: Doc, I am stage 
III. I have a 4-month-old, a 2-year-old, 
and a wife. I am 39. What am I looking 
at? 
Dr. Yunis looked at me and said: I 
am not going to give you a percentage. 
Later he gave me one because I made 
him give me one. 
He said: I am not going to give you a 
percentage. For you, it is zero percent 
or 100 percent. Choose 100 percent. 
When are we going to choose 100 per-
cent? When are we as a body, when are 
we as the Senate, when are we as the 
White House, when are we together on 
a nonpartisan basis going to choose 100 
percent behind this country, 100 per-
cent for the rule of law, 100 percent 
standing alongside of our law enforce-
ment keeping our communities safe, 
100 percent that we are going to have 
our kids go back to school, we are 
going to get back to work, we are going 
to lift our economy up, and we are 
going to prove that the 21st century is 
going to be the greatest century that 
this country has ever known, not be-
cause we are cowering in fear, but be-
cause we are facing these things head- 
on? 
That is what 100 percent means. That 
is what being an American means. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

COVID–19 MEDICAL INNOVATION 
IDEAS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
Arizona 
(Mr. 
SCHWEIKERT) until 10 p.m. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Madam Speaker, 
we know we are in an election year. We 
know passions are running high. We 
know we have an environment where 
our country is incredibly hurting right 
now. 
If you saw the unemployment num-
bers this morning, the GDP numbers, 
how vibrant the economy was last 
quarter, you can almost have your 
heart ache. We have millions and mil-
lions and millions and millions of our 
brothers and sisters outside these walls 
who are hurting. And I guess for many 
of us in the minority, there is that 
frustration of ‘‘we care, but we want 
something that actually works.’’ 
And so one of my reasons for taking 
some time tonight is I wanted to do 
one or two things. 
Originally, I was going to bring in all 
this data of what we have learned 
about who gets sick and who doesn’t 
get sick, and those things. And I real-
ized, maybe that is not what we should 
do. So I was going to do just a couple 
data points and then actually talk 
about pieces of legislation that should 
be easy for us, that actually would help 
our brothers and sisters out there in 
dealing with the coronavirus, in deal-
ing with the economic devastation it 
has brought to us, and providing some 
of the basic mechanisms. None of them 
are panaceas, but it is good policy. 
Let me start with one thing, just so 
we have this: If we look at our fellow 
Americans that we have lost since the 
pandemic—family members, mothers 
and fathers, grandmas and grandpas 
who passed away—45 percent of them 
were actually in a nursing home or 
hospice-type care and their death cer-
tificates make it clear that there was 
COVID as part of it. 
So if you actually had that as a data 
point, I am hoping we can sort of think 
through who are the most vulnerable 
in our society, and do we continue to 
sell, tell, share the message that if you 
are in some of these vulnerable groups, 
if you are in the nursing home, it is 
risky. There is a concentration where 
resources should go and what we can 
do. 
And that is an interesting baseline 
for those who actually have great in-
terest in the numbers. For myself in 
Maricopa County, Arizona, our nursing 
home fatality rate is at 39 percent of 
the fatalities. There are other places 
where it is over 50 percent. Using that 
actually is a benchmark. If the na-
tional number is 45 percent of the fa-
talities from COVID come from nursing 
homes and those types of facilities, if 
you are above that, you really need to 
think about how you are treating that 
population, how you are working with 
that care delivery network. If you are 
below it, maybe you have a sense you 
are going in the right direction. 
But these are the types of things we 
need to be sharing with people around 
the country, to understand that if you 
are 25 years old, the chance of you los-
ing your life—and we don’t want any-
one getting sick—but you are well 
under 1 percent. 
And this is something called—I do a 
lot of presentations here on the floor, 
and I didn’t bring all the charts be-
cause I just didn’t want to overwhelm 
the 
conversation—allocation 
of 
re-
sources. 
If your community, when you pull up 
your ZIP Code map—and in Arizona, we 
are doing a really good job of using this 
heat map, where you can see where we 
are having outbreaks—how do we actu-
ally share? Because we have provided 
resources—maybe we need to provide 
more technology or other things—but 
if you see on the heat map that this 
neighborhood, this part of your com-
munity is having an outbreak, why 
don’t we have outreach into that com-
munity? Why don’t we have people 
knocking on the doors saying, Do you 
have a mask? Do you understand all 
the little rules? Do you understand the 
Sunday barbecue in the backyard with 
everyone in the neighborhood probably 
isn’t a brilliant idea? 
I really want us to communicate the 
idea where the devastation is but also, 
how do we be proactive? How do we get 
out there? Instead of doing some of the 
craziness of everything shuts down, 
whether you are in communities where 
we can’t find efficacy of transmissions 
to where we see some pretty tough 
numbers. So that is actually one of the 
things we have been trying to commu-
nicate to the professionals in Arizona, 
is sort of, how do we reach out to where 
we see the problems? 
In Arizona recently, we had the Fed-
eral Government provide testing in 
some of the hardest hit areas, and we 
hoped actually some of those numbers 
helped. There are other economic num-
bers that are really tough because 
some of it is getting on the cusp of 
being partisan. And I am going to beg 
for my brothers and sisters on the left, 
and those of us on the right, to back 
away from it and actually sort of think 
it through. 
We actually have built a number of 
charts, and we are trying to build more 
data of what is actually going to hap-
pen if schools aren’t able to find a safe 
way to open up. 
Do you actually know what happens 
to long-term incomes of females in the 
country? These are things people don’t 
necessarily think about, but we can 
show you—we are working on it be-
cause we are trying to make sure we 
are getting our math right—that by 
not having the daycare facilities and 
our schools open, it turns out the 
moms and dads—but, particularly the 
moms that work—that may now have 
lost several months of being in the 
workplace, it actually has an effect on

their entire future working careers, in-
come potential, if not their Social Se-
curity and other things. 
We need to understand the totality of 
the decisions we are making. And this 
was just a chart I grabbed because I 
thought the information was inter-
esting, but the compound effects of 
when we are not able to come up with 
a safe method to open up our schools, 
you actually start to see that for, par-
ticularly moms, it looks like by the 
numbers they lose about half their 
working time. But we can even find an-
other set of numbers that 19 percent of 
those who are actually healthcare 
workers can’t be there providing those 
services. 
We don’t seem to stop and take a 
step backwards. And on one hand, we 
are talking about how desperately we 
need healthcare workers and facilities 
in places that are having a tough time. 
Oh, by the way, we are not going to 
come up with a safe way for education, 
for daycare to open up. You do realize 
that 
actually 
just 
reduced 
your 
healthcare workers by 19 percent? 
We haven’t been taking a step back-
wards and thinking about this holis-
tically. And that is why I am going to 
walk through a couple of the pieces of 
legislation we have introduced in the 
last couple of weeks. We are trying to 
come up with ways to try to help. In 
the future, we are going to talk more 
about this on the effects on the chil-
dren. 
I have a little girl that is about to 
turn 5. She passed her test to get early 
enrollment into kindergarten. When I 
go home, you can just see almost how 
desperate she is to be with other little 
kids. I mean, she loves mommy and 
daddy, but, apparently, we don’t play 
the same way as other 4-and-a-half- 
year-olds, five-year-olds. What would 
be the long-term effect in her ability to 
socialize? 
What is the effect? We came across— 
and we haven’t been able to vet it yet, 
so I am going to say it, but understand, 
we haven’t vetted the numbers—of 
high-school age kids that will pass 
away from the coronavirus compared 
to the increase of high-school aged sui-
cides. And not being able to have serv-
ices, not being able to have counseling, 
not be able to have social relation-
ships. And I know these are sometimes 
really uncomfortable numbers to, one, 
get accurate, but even talk about. 
We have got to find a way to under-
stand decisions we are making over 
here. Are we ultimately doing more 
damage to the people in our country? 
And this is more than the economy. It 
is people’s mental health, their eco-
nomic future, their future earnings 
power, and just societal cohesion. 
Let’s 
actually 
talk 
about 
some 
things I think that are both optimistic 
and opportunities. One of the things 
that happened when we started to do 
some of the emergency legislation on 
the pandemic, for some of the staff 
that have been here, you know, there 
are a handful of us who have been 
pounding the doors around here for 
years about expanding telemedicine. 
Oddly enough—I know this sounds 
crazy right now—but telemedicine in 
the past has been a controversial sub-
ject here because it disrupts some of 
the medical delivery business model. 
We have lots of lobbyists in Wash-
ington, D.C., that really don’t like tele-
medicine because it is another avenue 
of competition. But we did it. We took 
a piece of legislation that Mr. THOMP-
SON and I had passed, grabbed some of 
the language, and that is actually the 
law right now—except for one catch: 
When the pandemic is declared over, 
that expanded authorization of tele-
medicine goes away. But we are getting 
a living test right now. 
What is fascinating is, if you and I go 
back to 2019, only about 11 percent of 
healthcare consumers—you and I—11 
percent in 2019—use telemedicine. In 
the last few months, we are actually 
seeing it around 46 percent of folks 
that need some type of medical advice 
or doctor visit are actually using tele-
medicine. We have just proven it 
works. 
And there is actually some amazing 
data coming in about the ability to 
make it very cost-effective, and the 
ability to find out the satisfaction lev-
els. Turns out that people are more 
satisfied with many of their telemedi-
cine visits than when they go visit the 
doctor’s office. And it turns out, also, 
that the actual face-time with that 
medical professional actually is longer 
in telemedicine than when you have ac-
tually gone to the doctor’s office. 
So we need to understand these 
things, because when we get beyond 
this pandemic, will we understand that 
telemedicine isn’t scary. We need to 
find a way to extend it, make it perma-
nent, and actually expand what the 
definition is. Look, we have some great 
data that is coming in that this is 
working. This is one of the things we 
did, bipartisan, on something that we 
couldn’t get done for years. It is hap-
pening right now. 
So we have introduced a piece of leg-
islation that will just make it so when 
the pandemic is declared over, tele-
medicine isn’t ended in its new reim-
bursements, in its efficacy, in its avail-
ability. 
Now, I want to go further. I actually 
believe the future of telemedicine is 
more than just picking up your phone 
and talking to a medical professional 
or face-time. I also think it is the body 
sensors you can put on that produce 
data from your body, that the algo-
rithm can be calculating, that finds if 
there is something wrong, the medical 
professional can call you. 
So we are going to try to see if we 
can expand that definition to even the 
technology out there, because this is 
one of our arguments that we have 
been making here, that as Republicans 
and Democrats, we have been having 
the wrong debate about healthcare. We 
keep debating on who should pay, who 
should get subsidized, and we are not 
having enough of the debate on tech-
nology. What are the things we can do 
that would actually change the price? 
Changing the price is what makes 
healthcare much more available, not a 
constant debate on who should end up 
paying and who should be subsidizing. 
This piece of legislation has been 
dropped, and I am very grateful. Thank 
you for those who are helping us co-
sponsor it. We want to see more. 
Another thing we are having that 
discussion of: 
How do you start to open up society? 
How do you open up your commu-
nity? 
How do you open up the little busi-
nesses in your neighborhood? 
Many of them need to be able to put 
up that plastic shield. They are going 
to need to be able to buy protective 
equipment or ways to sterilize those 
things. 
We have come up with a tax credit 
idea for those businesses. It is 50 per-
cent of their cost, particularly for test-
ing. If you want to test your employ-
ees, a tax credit—but it is not the tax 
credit that at the end of the year, next 
year you might get some money. We do 
it as a tax credit off your payroll. 
And the benefit of that is certain 
businesses, every couple weeks, every 
month, they are turning in their FICA, 
you know, their payroll tax, they can 
get the credit right there. So the cash 
flow is available to go pay for testing, 
pay for things that make their busi-
nesses safe. So as they start to invite 
their teams, their employees back, it is 
a way to make sure they are staying 
safe. 
The other one—and this is a big deal, 
and this one I think actually both Re-
publicans and Democrats will em-
brace—and we are going to geek out 
just a tiny bit. 
When the ACA passed—most folks 
know it as ObamaCare—one of the 
mechanisms in there was the ability to 
deduct your medical expenses was 
going to go up over time to 10 percent 
of your adjusted gross income. And for 
a lot of seniors, that was going to be 
pretty tough. When we did tax reform, 
we actually extended the 71⁄2 percent of 
your adjusted gross income when you 
hit that level the next dollar you could 
start to deduct off your taxes for a cou-
ple of years. 
But the fact of the matter is, it is 
scheduled to go up to 10 percent of your 
adjusted gross income, your medical 
expenses, before you can start to de-
duct them. 
In a time like this, in a time when we 
all talk about healthcare and the fi-
nancial stresses and impacts that puts 
on our family, let’s do this: For the 
next 2 years, let’s make it 5 percent. So 
if you had medical expenses that you 
are paying for, you hit the 5 percent, 
you can actually take it. And after 
that, we will keep it at the 71⁄2 percent.

S4599 
Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, JULY 30, 2020 
No. 135 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
O God, our refuge and strength, give 
us reverence for Your greatness. Guide 
our Senators around the pitfalls of 
their work, enabling them to have 
hearts sustained by Your peace. May 
they surrender their will to You as 
they trust You to direct their steps. 
Lord, remind them that leadership 
can work miracles with cooperation 
but rarely accomplishes much with 
conflict. Inspire our lawmakers to be 
quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow 
to get angry. Help them to strive to 
live with such integrity that they give 
You the honor due Your Name. Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
HYDE-SMITH). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to speak 1 
minute in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
MOTORCOACH INDUSTRY 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
the motorcoach industry has been par-
ticularly hard hit by the COVID–19 
pandemic and the economic turndown 
as a result of it. Iowa has many motor-
coach operators, several of which are 
really family owned and some of them 
for two or three generations. 
I have been in frequent communica-
tion with these Iowans, and I am learn-
ing they are quickly coming to the 
point of making a decision of whether 
they 
can 
even 
stay 
in 
business. 
Motorcoaches provide passenger trans-
portation services to all Americans, 
providing over 600 million passenger 
trips annually across the country. By 
comparison, airlines provided service 
for 925 million passenger trips in 2019. 
While most other modes of transpor-
tation received specific funding to help 
them through the pandemic, the mo-
torcoach industry has not. What they 
are really referring to when they talk 
to me, they seem to feel that they have 
been left out when we have given sev-
eral tens of millions of dollars to help 
the airline industry. 
I spoke with Secretary Mnuchin 
about this matter and have relayed the 
concerns from these Iowa companies to 
relevant committees here in the Sen-
ate. The government relies on motor-
coach industries to help move troops 
and also evacuate people to safety dur-
ing our natural disasters. However, 
with passenger bookings being non-
existent and few charters being sched-
uled, this leaves little hope of rebound 
yet this year. The industry may not 
survive to provide this service in the 
future if they don’t receive support. 
I yield the floor. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
on Monday, Senate Republicans re-
leased a starting proposal for another 
major pandemic rescue package. 
This is what we want to do: Continue 
a Federal supplement to unemploy-
ment benefits that is otherwise about 
to expire; send thousands of dollars 
more in cash to American families; 
keep funding the Payroll Protection 
Program to prevent more layoffs; sub-
sidize rehiring to get laid-off workers 
their jobs back and create new incen-
tives for workplace safety; give K–12 
schools, colleges, and universities fund-
ing to reopen safely—more money than 
the House Democrats have proposed; 
support healthcare providers in the lat-
est hotspots and keep supporting the 
race for vaccines; provide common-
sense legal protection so that schools, 
hospitals, and other employers can re-
open without being buried in lawsuits. 
That is what we put forward—a tril-
lion 
dollars 
for 
kids, 
jobs, 
and 
healthcare. It is a framework that is 
more generous in key areas than House 
Democrats’ 
totally 
unserious 
pro-
posal—a framework that could have 
kept the additional Federal payments 
to unemployed workers flowing instead 
of expiring this week. 
There is a fact of life here in the Sen-
ate. It takes 60 votes to legislate, so 
the American people cannot get any of 
the additional relief that Republicans 
want to give them unless Democrats at 
least come to the table. Either our 
Democratic colleagues come to the 
table or the American people will not 
get the help they need. That is why I 
said this week we have come down to 
one key question: Will the country get 
the Democrats who showed up back in 
March to pass the bipartisan CARES 
Act or will the country get the Demo-
crats who showed up in June to block 
police reform and keep that issue alive 
through November? 
Unfortunately, 3 days in, it hasn’t 
been a close call. The Speaker of the 
House 
and 
the 
Democratic 
leader 
refuse to let anyone else speak on their 
side. I understand the Democratic lead-
er has actually forbidden—forbidden 
his own Democratic ranking members 
from talking and negotiating with 
their Republican counterparts who are 
spearheading the different components. 
You see, bipartisan, Member-level dis-
cussions might actually generate some 
progress, and progress does not appear

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4600 
July 30, 2020 
to be something the leaders on the 
other side want. 
On Monday, the Speaker of the House 
claimed she could not wait to start ne-
gotiations, but then on Tuesday, she 
said her discussion with the adminis-
tration ‘‘isn’t a negotiation.’’ And then 
the Speaker said: ‘‘The appropriate 
thing for the Senate to do is pass a bill 
and then we can negotiate with them.’’ 
Meanwhile, the Democratic leader is 
over here making sure that cannot 
happen. This is quite the partnership: 
the House Speaker moves the goalposts 
while the Democratic leader hides the 
football. They will not engage when 
the Trump administration tries to dis-
cuss our comprehensive plan. They will 
not engage when the Administration 
floats a narrower proposal. They, basi-
cally, will not engage, period. 
The Speaker and the Democratic 
leader are playing rope-a-dope with the 
health, welfare, and livelihoods of 
American families. With benefits expir-
ing, with the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram winding down, and millions un-
employed, the Democrats are saying 
‘‘my way or the highway’’ with a So-
cialist wish list that was laughed off by 
everyone from journalists to econo-
mists the instant they introduced it. 
This is what reporters had to say 
about Speaker PELOSI’s proposal in 
May: 
‘‘The more than 1,800-page bill makes 
a long wish list for Democrats.’’ 
‘‘Neither this bill nor anything re-
assembling it will ever become law.’’ 
Even the Speaker’s own Democratic 
Members knew it was a joke. ‘‘Pri-
vately, several House Democrats con-
cede the bill feels more like an effort 
to appease the most liberal members of 
the caucus.’’ 
Yet this is what they are holding out 
for. Let’s recall some of the specific 
items. These are the things over which 
Democrats are blowing up negotiations 
and forcing a lapse in extra unemploy-
ment benefits: tax increase on small 
businesses; taxpayer-funded checks for 
illegal immigrants; taxpayer-funded di-
versity studies of the legal pot indus-
try; and their ongoing obsession with 
something called the State and local 
tax, or SALT, which would be a mas-
sive giveaway for high earners in blue 
States. In other words, a tax cut for 
high earners in blue States. Let me say 
that again. Democrats are holding up 
help for struggling people over special 
tax breaks for rich people in blue 
States, an idea that has been criticized 
by economists from all sides. 
Republicans want to get more help to 
families right now, but Speaker PELOSI 
says: Let them eat SALT. 
They also want to spend another tril-
lion dollars bailing out State and local 
governments that only spent—listen to 
this—25 percent of the money we sent 
them back in March. Some State and 
local governments have only spent 25 
percent of the money we sent them 
back in March, and the Speaker and 
Democratic leader want to send them 
another trillion dollars. 
This is silly stuff. None of it should 
be stopping negotiations and none of it 
would be if our Democratic colleagues 
actually wanted to get an outcome. 
Let’s talk about unemployment in-
surance. Both Republicans and Demo-
crats agree in these extraordinary 
times it makes sense for the Federal 
Government to provide the stark addi-
tional help on top of normal unemploy-
ment. Republicans don’t want this aid 
to expire. Our plan continues it, but 
the Speaker and the Democratic leader 
say they will not agree to anything un-
less the program pays people more to 
stay home than to work. 
Prominent Democrats have publicly 
said they agree with our position. The 
Democratic Governor of Connecticut 
says he wants to continue the benefit 
at a more targeted level. Multiple 
Members of the Senate and Speaker 
PELOSI’s own House Democratic Major-
ity Leader have all said in the last few 
days that they are open to negotiating 
this, but the Speaker and the Demo-
cratic leader have cut all their col-
leagues out. They are standing alone, 
saying: ‘‘Our way or the highway.’’ And 
so people are going to suffer. 
I understand the Democratic leader 
said he felt offended when I noted that 
some people are suggesting the Demo-
crats’ strange behavior is explained by 
politics; that some people think Demo-
crats are behaving like national suf-
fering 
would 
only 
hurt 
President 
Trump. Now, the Democratic leader, 
himself, pointed that exact accusation 
at various Republicans during the 
Obama Presidency on multiple occa-
sions. I know memories can be short 
around here when it is convenient. 
More broadly, actions speak louder 
than words. Democrats spent weeks 
shouting that the Senate should act on 
police reform, but when Senator TIM 
SCOTT
gave them the chance, they 
blocked action. They blocked the Sen-
ate from even taking up the subject. 
And now, so far, this is the sequel. 
Democrats talked a big game about 
wanting to provide more assistance, 
but now that it is ‘‘go time,’’ they show 
zero appetite for any bipartisan out-
come at all. 
This is personal for me. Kentucky 
has not finished fighting with the 
coronavirus, and the Federal Govern-
ment must not be finished helping Ken-
tucky. Laid-off Kentuckians need more 
help. Kentucky schools need more help. 
Under our proposal, Kentucky alone 
would receive $193 million for testing 
and contact tracing to fight the spread 
of the disease. This should be just as 
personal for every single Senator. 
None of our States deserve the Demo-
crats’ rope-a-dope. No American family 
deserves it. Don’t my distinguished 
ranking member colleagues wish they 
could be involved in robust bipartisan 
discussions with our chairman, like 
back in March, and not watching from 
the sidelines as their leader shuts down 
talks on TV? Do they really think the 
Democratic leader’s tactics are serving 
the common good of their States? 
Republicans 
have 
put 
forward 
a 
framework 
that 
would 
do 
huge 
amounts of good for huge numbers of 
American families. If Democrats ever 
come to the table, we will be able to 
bridge our differences and make a law.

MOMENT OF SILENCE FOR THE VICTIMS OF THE 
NOVEL CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
the Senate will soon acknowledge a 
moment of silence for the 150,000 Amer-
icans who have now died from COVID– 
19—more lives than our country lost in 
World War I. This national tragedy is 
more keenly felt because it has not and 
cannot be properly mourned. One of the 
most devastating consequences of this 
disease is that it keeps us apart even in 
death. There is no final clutching of 
the hand of a loved one, no funeral to 
remember 
one 
by. 
Grandchildren, 
wrapped in protective gear, wave good-
bye from across the hospital room. 
There are 150,000 Americans who have 
died, which is more than in any other 
nation on God’s green Earth—more 
than of our allies and more than of our 
adversaries, more than in the most 
populous nations, more than in those 
with mere fractions of our wealth and 
power, and more—so many more—than 
in the nation from which this virus 
originated. 
We will debate the reasons for this 
ugly truth—we must—if we are to 
avoid compounding our errors and 
heaping sorrow upon sorrow as the

virus continues to rage throughout our 
country. Yet now we spend a moment 
to acknowledge how much our country 
has suffered already. 
We have lost friends and neighbors, 
brothers 
and 
sisters, 
fathers 
and 
daughters, mothers and sons, a beloved 
professor at Howard University, a civil 
rights pioneer, and a renowned psy-
chiatrist. We have lost a Brooklyn doc-
tor, at 62, on the verge of retirement, 
who in the early weeks of the crisis in 
New York, worked day shifts at the 
ICU and night shifts at the Hospital 
Center across the street before finally 
succumbing to the disease himself. We 
have lost so many in so short a time. 
Unable to grieve them in the manner 
they deserve, we respect this moment 
of silence, this moment of sorrow. 
I ask unanimous consent that there 
be a moment of silence to recognize the 
more than 150,000 American deaths 
from the novel coronavirus. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
There will now be a moment of si-
lence to recognize the American deaths 
from the novel coronavirus. 
(Moment of silence.) 
CORONAVIRUS 
Madam President, as COVID–19 con-
tinues to spread through dozens of 
States, our country is dealing with 
multiple crises at this time. 
We learned today that the most re-
cent quarter was the worst on record 
for our economy. The problem is not 
new or surprising. Millions of newly 
unemployed Americans cannot go back 
to work, cannot afford the rent, cannot 
put food on the table. Small businesses 
are waiting to see if the Federal loan 
program that kept them alive will be 
renewed. Parents are worried sick 
about their kids returning to school in 
the fall. The State and local govern-
ments that fought this disease on the 
frontline when the Trump administra-
tion refused to give them help are deep 
in the red and are slashing public serv-
ices, teachers, firefighters, and more. 
Throughout America, people wait 
days and days—even weeks—for the re-
sults of their tests, which renders the 
tests almost useless because we don’t 
have an adequate testing program at 
the national level. This is the greatest 
public health challenge and crisis and 
the greatest economic challenge in at 
least 75 years. We need to confront all 
of these crises. 
Senate Republicans hardly want to 
address any of them. They dithered for 
months and then produced a half- 
baked, halfhearted proposal of half 
measures—a proposal that their own 
caucus and their own President didn’t 
fully support. Just last night, the Re-
publican leader confirmed that 20 Re-
publican Senators want to do nothing 
in the face of the historic problems we 
face, and because the Senate Repub-
licans haven’t gotten their act to-
gether, 2 weeks have now gone down 
the drain and 3 months went down the 
drain before that because the Repub-
licans have been wedded to a twisted 
ideology that the Federal Government 
shouldn’t help people even in a time of 
national emergency. 
As the country is about to careen 
over several cliffs as a result of Repub-
lican delay, dithering, and disunity, 
our friends on the other side are now 
scrambling. It is dawning on them 
now—not a week ago, not 3 weeks ago, 
not 2 months ago—that we are facing a 
cliff with unemployment—although we 
face cliffs on other issues, as well, right 
now. 
I understand that, today, a few of my 
colleagues on the other side will ask 
the Senate to pass a reduction of the 
enhanced employment benefit from 
$600 a week to $200 a week or, even 
worse, a smaller percentage of a work-
er’s wages than the Republicans pro-
posed in their bill earlier this week. An 
already stingy Republican proposal has 
gotten even stingier as the week has 
gone on. 
I have made it very clear why the 
proposal by the Senator of Wisconsin is 
terrible policy for four main reasons. 
First and most obviously, it would 
hurt the unemployed as 1.4 million 
Americans filed new claims for unem-
ployment last week, and the number is 
going up again. Our economy is still 
shedding jobs, and Americans are los-
ing their paychecks through no fault of 
their own. Yet the Republicans want to 
take $1,600 out of their pockets every 
single month. They want to give people 
who lost their jobs through no fault of 
their own a 34-percent pay cut. It is 
shocking, inhumane, wrong. 
Second, it would exacerbate poverty. 
Our enhanced unemployment benefits 
have prevented nearly 12 million Amer-
icans from slipping into poverty. The 
Republicans want to slash and burn 
that poverty-preventing policy. Let’s 
have more people go into poverty. That 
is what this amendment would do. 
Third, it would devastate our econ-
omy. One of the few bright spots over 
the past few months has been consumer 
spending, in no small part because 
these unemployment benefits go to 
those Americans who need to spend 
them as soon as they get them. No 
wonder respected economic forecasters 
project that the Republican policy on 
unemployment insurance would cost us 
over a million jobs this year and 3 mil-
lion more next year. 
Finally, we know that this policy is 
impossible to implement. When our of-
fice called State unemployment offices 
to ask them about the Republican pro-
posal, they said its implementation 
would be a catastrophe. One office sim-
ply said: ‘‘This would cause chaos.’’ 
This is not a serious proposal. We all 
know it will never pass the House and 
that it doesn’t have enough votes to 
come close to passing in the Senate. 
Large numbers of Republicans will vote 
against it. This effort appears to be an 
effort to provide the Republicans some 
political cover because they can’t get 
their act together and force the coun-
try over these cliffs. 
We are trying to negotiate with the 
White House and would welcome nego-
tiations with our Senate colleagues, 
but the reason negotiations are going 
nowhere right now is that the Repub-
licans are divided. Who is leading the 
effort on the Republican side—Chief of 
Staff Meadows and Secretary Mnuchin? 
Is 
Senator 
JOHNSON
and 
Senator 
BRAUN’s effort to pass reduced unem-
ployment benefits a real offer from the 
Republicans or just a stunt? 
Leader MCCONNELL has said that the 
Democrats will not engage. I would re-
mind him that he refuses to go into the 
room when Speaker PELOSI, Secretary 
Mnuchin, Chief of Staff Meadows, and I 
sit in there. Once again, Senator 
MCCONNELL engages in ‘‘Alice in Won-
derland’’ tactics and speeches and 
words. What he says is exactly the op-
posite of what is true. We are trying to 
negotiate, and the Senate Republicans 
are not. 
Next, it is clear that the Senate Re-
publicans don’t have a unified position 
on anything. The main thing we hear 
from Leader MCCONNELL
is that he 
would torpedo all of the relief that the 
Americans are counting on unless 
there is a giant corporate immunity 
provision attached, and he says he will 
not even negotiate on it. Who is hold-
ing things up? Who is standing in the 
way? Leader MCCONNELL and his Re-
publican caucus are, certainly, at the 
top of the list. 
And President Trump is all over the 
lot. He himself called the Republican 
Senate proposal ‘‘semi-irrelevant.’’ 
When your own President says your 
proposal is semi-irrelevant, as Trump 
has said to the Senate Republicans, 
you know that they are tied in a knot 
and can’t get anything done. 
The President seems to endorse a dif-
ferent policy every time he finds a 
microphone. The one thing we are sure 
he supports is spending taxpayer dol-
lars on a new FBI building to boost the 
value of his hotel. 
Yesterday, we learned the President 
asked for nearly $400 million in renova-
tions to the White House in the Repub-
lican COVID proposal. Seriously? The 
President proposes no help for Ameri-
cans to stay in their houses but wants 
the taxpayers to fork over nearly $400 
million to help him renovate the White 
House? 
Simply put, negotiations with the 
White House and Senate Republicans 
right now are like trying to nail Jell-O 
to the wall. We are trying to work with 
our counterparts, but it is immensely 
frustrating to deal with a negotiating 
partner who can’t say what they sup-
port on nearly any issue. 
Now, we are hearing the President 
and his representatives have floated 
the idea of a skinny bill to address one 
program, to extend unemployment in-
surance at much lower rates, which 
hurts the unemployed. But while the 
Nation waits, desperate for comprehen-
sive relief, they leave everything else 
out. 
What about improving testing, where 
people have to wait in line—wait for 
hours, days, and weeks to get their

tests back? What about helping State 
and local governments, who have to lay 
off firefighters and busdrivers? What 
about dealing with people who might 
be evicted? What about dealing with 
people who can’t feed their kids? The 
list of issues goes on and on and on, 
and they are all immediate and urgent. 
So to have this bill, which is inad-
equate on employment benefits alone— 
cuts them to the bone—and not include 
any of the other issues, in a hope to es-
cape and then do nothing more? Forget 
it. It will not pass the Senate. It will 
not pass the House. It is a stunt. 
Even if the White House would agree 
to another extension of enhanced un-
employment at its current level, which 
many, if not most, Senate Republicans 
will refuse to support, there are just 
too many things left out—opening up 
our schools safely, healthcare testing 
and reducing the wait to get test re-
sults, State and local governments, so 
much more. 
And even if the White House finally 
comes around to the position that we 
should extend the moratorium on evic-
tions, that wouldn’t be enough. It 
makes no sense to extend the morato-
rium on evictions without helping 
Americans actually afford the rent. We 
can prevent landlords or banks from 
kicking Americans out of their homes 
for another few months, but then what? 
The 
same 
Americans 
would 
be 
6 
months behind on the rent and have no 
hope of making up the difference. 
So let’s look. Here is where we are. 
Americans are worried as this awful 
pandemic rages on. The lifelines we 
passed here in Congress to protect fam-
ilies, small businesses, renters, school 
kids, and so many more are expired, 
and our Republican colleagues dither. 
We have a comprehensive, bold pro-
posal. They have virtually nothing. 
Let’s remember recent history. That 
may give us some hope that we can get 
something done. Back in March and 
April, Republicans were late to the 
game, just as they are now, and pro-
posed stingy, insufficient legislation in 
response to COVID–19, just like they 
are doing now. Each time, Democrats 
were not bullied by Republicans into 
passing something that wouldn’t work 
and be insufficient, but we demanded 
that our colleagues sit down with us 
and negotiate a bill that meets the 
needs of the American people—and that 
is what we did. 
In the second, third, and fourth 
phases of COVID relief, our negotia-
tions produced much better legisla-
tion—legislation 
that 
passed 
both 
Houses with near unanimity. It is 
never easy, and it is never painless, but 
it can be done. We just need our Repub-
lican colleagues to get their act to-
gether, roll up their sleeves, under-
stand the gravity and breadth and 
depth of this problem and negotiate 
with us in a serious way. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

OFFICER. 
The

The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
REMEMBERING JOHN LEWIS 
Mr. 
CARDIN. 
Madam 
President, 
today our colleague John Lewis will be 
laid to rest. What an incredible legacy 
he leaves behind. 
I was blessed to serve with him in the 
House of Representatives. The two of 
us were elected in the same class to 
start serving in the House of Rep-
resentatives in 1987. We became friends, 
and he was certainly an inspiration to 
all of us. 
I particularly mention his name 
today because of the challenges we are 
finding to our First Amendment right 
to peacefully protest. John Lewis fre-
quently talked about ‘‘good trouble’’ 
and that all of us have a responsibility 
to speak out when we see something 
that is wrong and to do it in a peaceful 
way. 
It is interesting that his last public 
appearance was with the protesters of 
Black Lives Matter here in DC, as he 
wanted to be there and was proud to 
see the diversity of the group who was 
there to protest the brutalities that we 
have seen in America and the systemic 
racism we see in our country. 
We not only have the right but the 
responsibility to speak out when we see 
these injustices. The First Amendment 
to our Nation’s Constitution is key to 
the foundation of our country’s democ-
racy, including the right of people to 
peacefully assemble and petition for re-
dress of grievances. 
The President of the United States 
ordering unidentified agents of the De-
partment of Homeland Security to ar-
rest and detain protesters is a flagrant 
breach of trust and potentially a viola-
tion of the law. Congress must speak 
up in a unified, bipartisan voice and 
tell the President that such an esca-
lation and militarization of our city 
streets without provocation or invita-
tion from local officials must stop and 
must stop now. 
I am gravely concerned that when 
Federal law enforcement agents are de-
ployed in this manner, their presence 
has increased tensions and caused more 
confrontation between demonstrators 
and police. Indeed, local, State, and 
even Federal officials—including the 
U.S. Attorney—have criticized the Fed-
eral agents’ intervention and tactics in 
Portland. 
I share the concerns of many of my 
colleagues regarding the misuse of re-
sources and personnel, particularly 
when Federal law enforcement officers 
are used for political purposes by the 
President to violate the civil rights of 
our constituents. We all should be con-
cerned that both the Justice and 
Homeland Security Departments are 
misusing their emergency authorities 
and are actually aggravating the situa-
tion in Portland and elsewhere. 
I have cosponsored legislation that 
would place important limits and over-
sight on the use of Federal officers for 
enforcement operations and arrests re-
lating to protests, including making 
sure that law enforcement officers are 
clearly identified. 
I recently voted in the Senate to 
place further limits on the transfer of 
excess military equipment to State and 
local law enforcement agencies, and I 
will continue to demand that America 
reform its Federal, State, and local law 
enforcement agencies. 
After the shocking death of George 
Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis, 
Congress must address systemic racism 
and police brutality through passage of 
the Justice in Policing Act. While this 
legislation has passed the House, Sen-
ator MCCONNELL has still refused to 
bring it up in the Senate, condemning 
it to his legislative graveyard. 
Now more than ever, we urgently 
need to rebuild trust with our commu-
nities and change the Trump adminis-
tration’s mentality from a warrior to a 
guardian approach for law enforce-
ment. 
News reports indicate that Federal 
law enforcement officers have been 
using 
unmarked 
vehicles 
to 
drive 
around downtown Portland and detain 
protesters since at least mid-July. In 
some cases, citizens could not tell the 
difference between law enforcement 
and far-right extremists in the region 
who wore similar military gear. 
This reminds us of the most radical 
images that we have seen in authori-
tative, repressive regimes on how they 
violate the rights of their citizens. 
Federal officials have been reported 
as grabbing Americans in the dark, not 
providing any form of identification, 
and arresting, searching, and detaining 
individuals in cells before properly 
reading their Miranda rights. There are 
widespread reports of Federal agents 
not having any probable cause before 
making these arrests. 
Not only are these actions irrespon-
sible and dangerous, it is a violation of 
our constitutional rights. America’s 
strength is in the ideals that we believe 
in. We are the global leader in demo-
cratic values and the rule of law. These 
actions weaken our Nation, and these 
actions weaken America’s credibility 
and global leadership on behalf of 
democratic values. 
I am pleased that last week the in-
spectors general of the Department of 
Homeland Security and Justice agreed 
to investigate how their agents used 
force, detained people, and conducted 
themselves in confrontations with pro-
testers both in Portland, OR, and 
Washington, DC. 
Recall in Washington, DC, that At-
torney General Barr used force to clear 
a peaceful protest at Lafayette Park 
just outside the White House. Attorney 
General Barr took this action so that 
the President could hold up a Bible for 
a photo-op outside of a church. This 
was an unacceptable breach of faith in 
the Constitution. It breaks the trust

between our law enforcement and our 
citizens. 
Defending democracy and the rule of 
law—the very freedoms we as a nation 
hold so dear—is hard work. It is made 
harder when the very individuals sworn 
to uphold the law work so hard to un-
dermine it. 
The Justice Department is the only 
Cabinet agency named after an ideal, 
and Mr. BARR has forfeited his ability 
to effectively lead it. 
In particular, the Justice Depart-
ment inspector general will investigate 
how U.S. marshals have used force in 
Portland and how other parts of the 
Justice Department—such as the FBI, 
Drug Enforcement Administration, and 
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms 
and Explosives—were used in the Na-
tion’s Capital. 
The inspector general of the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security has said he 
opened an investigation into allega-
tions that Customs and Border Protec-
tion agents improperly detained and 
transported protesters in Portland and 
that he would review the deployment 
of DHS’s personnel in recent weeks. 
America is not under siege, as the 
President would like citizens to be-
lieve—except by a President who freely 
uses aggressive law enforcement as a 
prop to distract the country from his 
flailing response to the pandemic that 
has crippled our Nation. Citizens are 
rightly concerned that the administra-
tion has deployed a secret police force, 
not to investigate crimes but to intimi-
date individuals it views as political 
adversaries. 
Several former Secretaries of Home-
land Security have sounded the alarm 
as well. Michael Chertoff, a Secretary 
of Homeland Security under George W. 
Bush, wrote recently: 
The Trump administration’s deliberate de-
cision to intervene in the Portland protests 
with a heavy hand, unconventional means 
and inflammatory political rhetoric has con-
tributed to growing public distrust—particu-
larly of the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity. 
Critics of the department are now rightly 
worried that its law enforcement agents 
might be increasingly deployed by President 
Trump to score political points, or even 
interfere with the November election. 
Secretary Chertoff concluded: 
These actions, now or into the future, en-
danger our democracy and undermine the na-
tion’s safety—by hurting the department’s 
ability to carry out its core mission of pro-
tecting Americans from genuine threats to 
our security. 
Tom Ridge, the first Secretary of 
Homeland Security after its creation, 
said that the presence of Federal au-
thorities in Portland, OR, as protests 
continue in the city, is not consistent 
with the Department of Homeland Se-
curity’s mission. He noted that the 
first words of the Department’s vision 
statement that he helped establish are 
‘‘preserving our freedoms.’’ 
Secretary Ridge continued: 
When they appear to be quasi-military 
rather than law enforcement, I think it’s 
like pouring a little bit of gasoline on the 
fire. . . . Preserving the right to dissent is 
something very important. 
Now, I know President Trump has 
threatened to send additional Federal 
officers to Baltimore and other cities 
to quell any further dissent or protests. 
Let me remind President Trump that 
the protests in Baltimore after the 
death of George Floyd in police cus-
tody have been peaceful, so we don’t 
need additional Federal agents de-
signed to crack down on free speech 
and peaceful protests, nor do we want 
Federal agents to come to Baltimore 
with the purpose of escalating tensions 
with the community or trying to pro-
voke or incite violence or to discourage 
the lawful right of citizens exercising 
their First Amendment. 
Instead, in Baltimore, we want to 
continue working cooperatively with 
our Federal partners, like our U.S. at-
torney, to address the stubborn prob-
lems involving drug gangs and the high 
violent crime and murder rate. Ensur-
ing the safety of our communities re-
quires an all-hands-on-deck approach. 
In Baltimore, we are using a task force 
known as the Baltimore Organized 
Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force 
Strike Force, which is made up of 
local, State, and Federal partners. This 
task force only works due to continued 
transparency, collaboration, and en-
gagement 
with 
the 
community 
throughout this process. 
Together, the citizens of Baltimore 
will keep working with our law en-
forcement authorities to improve safe-
ty in our neighborhoods and on our 
streets. The city of Baltimore and the 
U.S. Department of Justice are con-
tinuing to work closely together, along 
with our U.S. District Court for the 
District of Maryland, to fully imple-
ment a consent decree to bring con-
stitutional policing to Baltimore resi-
dents so that the police adopt a guard-
ian instead of a warrior approach. 
Instead of spreading divisive rhetoric 
and taking escalatory actions against 
our citizens—tactics recently employed 
by President Trump—we should focus 
on working constructively at the Fed-
eral, State, and local level to promote 
proven strategies and solutions—like 
the strike force—that effectively re-
duce crime and improve safety. 
I look forward to the findings and 
recommendations 
of 
the 
inspectors 
general of those two Departments to 
make clear what went wrong and to 
take steps to make sure this type of 
Federal law enforcement authority is 
never abused again in the future. 
I would hope that all my colleagues 
would recognize the threat of these ac-
tions to the protections in the First 
Amendment of our Constitution, and 
we will work together as one body to 
protect the lawful rights of our citizens 
to protest their disagreements with 
government in a peaceful way. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

TROOP WITHDRAWAL 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am 
vice chairman of the Defense Appro-
priations Subcommittee. It is an awe-
some responsibility and assignment. 
We end up dealing with over 50 percent 
of the discretionary domestic spending 
each year in the United States. I work 
with my chairman, Senator SHELBY, 
and I have worked with others in the 
past trying to keep up with a changing 
environment in the world and a chang-
ing agenda in Washington. Many of the 
briefings I receive are open and public, 
and many are also classified. 
Last week, I met with the top U.S. 
commander in Europe, General Tod 
Wolters. General Wolters provided for 
me and Senator SHELBY a classified 
briefing on the Trump administration’s 
plans to remove almost 12,000 Amer-
ican troops from Germany. Yesterday, 
the Secretary of Defense, Mark Esper, 
made a similar briefing but publicly to 
the press. 
I am extremely concerned by both 
the classified and unclassified informa-
tion I have been given about this plan 
and by the differences in the briefing I 
received compared to the public an-
nouncements from the Secretary of De-
fense yesterday. Let me start off by 
saying that this plan makes no sense. 
While some are framing this as an im-
provement of our military posture in 
Europe, I don’t buy it. Nobody else 
should either. 
Germany now spends 1.3 percent of 
its gross domestic product on defense. 
Along with a majority of NATO mem-
bers, Germany has agreed to reach a 
goal of 2 percent of GDP on defense. 
Germany ought to make good on its 
word; that is for sure. But to be clear, 
many, including President Trump, fail 
to appreciate that there is much more 
to NATO’s importance than simply 
meeting a spending goal. In fact, there 
are many important ways to evaluate 
this historic NATO alliance and judge 
the commitment of each member, in-
cluding the political will of its leaders, 
its shared vision and values, and the 
interoperability 
of 
our 
military 
through regular training. All of these 
things add to NATO’s deterrence. But 
President Trump is clearly just using 
this argument about the percentage 
contribution and insufficient spending 
to drive a petty and personal grudge 
against Germany. 
How do we know this? Because—lis-
ten to this—the countries that would 
be receiving our troops transferred out 
of Germany also do not meet the 2 per-
cent goal. 
President 
Trump 
was 
reportedly 
angry that German Chancellor Merkel 
declined an invitation for an in-person 
G7 summit in the United States in the 
middle of this global pandemic. Think

of that: She was worried about the 
health consequences of such a meeting. 
We are canceling gatherings right and 
left in America because of a genuine 
concern we have for the well-being of 
one another. Chancellor Merkel’s posi-
tion is hardly unreasonable. It makes 
sense. Many of the statements and con-
duct from the President Trump do not. 
Amidst this snub to our NATO allies, 
President Trump continues to try to 
bring President Putin and Russia into 
the G7, even after reports about Rus-
sian bounties being put on American 
soldiers in Afghanistan and the Presi-
dent’s failure time and again since this 
has been disclosed to raise the issue 
with Vladimir Putin. 
During the briefing last week, I un-
derstood there would be a distributive 
process for planning how these troops 
would be moved and when they would 
be moved. We would discuss the infra-
structure that needs to be built in the 
United States as well as in Europe, and 
we would be in close consultation with 
our allies in the process. 
In contrast, the Vice Chairman of the 
Joints Chief of Staff, General Hyten, 
stated yesterday that there is a plan-
ning process occurring. He also went on 
to say that ‘‘we’ll start moving right 
away with forces moving right away.’’ 
Really? 
Without 
the 
planning? 
It 
sounds like this general is snapping to 
the attention of the President, who is 
determined to poke the German Chan-
cellor in the eye. Shouldn’t our highest 
priority be the defense of America 
rather than a spite match? 
If I am confused about how quickly 
this plan has unfolded, I will bet the 
rest of our NATO allies are as well. 
I might also say that I received a pre-
liminary cost estimate on how much 
American taxpayers will have to pay 
for this political adventure by Presi-
dent Trump. This figure is still classi-
fied. I am sorry that it is, but I can as-
sure you the costs are substantial. Sec-
retary Esper was dismissive yesterday 
of its cost; he should not be. It is sub-
stantial. 
Hiding the costs of this troop realign-
ment plan brings to mind the Presi-
dent’s campaign promise that Mexico 
was going to pay for our border wall. In 
reality, the Department of Defense 
paid for a large part of it because the 
President diverted funds appropriated 
for our national defense to this Captain 
Queeg venture of his on our southern 
border. 
The 
Defense 
Department 
should 
make cost estimates of this plan public 
today. Let the American people know 
what the President expects us to spend 
in order for him to get the last word 
with Angela Merkel. The American 
people ought to decide for themselves 
whether this is a cost worth bearing. 
Let me tell you what has been con-
spicuously absent from both public and 
private briefings, and that is whether 
our commitment to our real allies in 
Europe and NATO is really designed to 
address the frontline of potential Rus-
sian aggression and provocation. I 
know what that frontline is, and most 
people do as well—the Baltics and Po-
land. Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and 
Poland—here are four countries that 
have the most to lose if Putin chooses 
a path to war. Each of them meets and 
exceeds the spending goals for NATO. 
But this plan for the reallocation and 
reassignment of U.S. troops does not 
help these four countries. 
I went through the briefing. Those 
four countries weren’t raised in the 
briefing. I raised them in a question 
afterward: Why are these countries 
being overlooked if we are moving 
troops to make Europe safer? Instead, 
the Department of Defense yesterday 
threw in as an aside a vague assur-
ance—maybe just a possibility—that 
sometime, maybe in the future, more 
American troops might rotate through 
those countries for short periods of 
time. Major parts of the plan that I 
saw and part of the plan that was re-
leased yesterday actually move Amer-
ican troops and NATO allies further 
away from Russia. 
Vladimir Putin is getting the last 
laugh again when it comes to this 
President. 
Vladimir 
Putin 
fears 
a 
united NATO. Sadly, President Trump 
has done everything he can to divide 
and diminish that NATO alliance. 
President Putin believes that as long 
as that NATO alliance is divided, he is 
in a stronger bargaining position. 
Sadly, he is right. 
NATO is the most successful alliance 
in 
American 
history. 
Instead 
of 
strengthening it, the President of the 
United States is weakening it. Instead 
of leading it, he is undermining it. The 
best way to reassure our allies that we 
are with them is to scrap this plan 
now. 
If this administration is so confident 
about how good an idea this is, tell the 
American people how much it is going 
to cost and explain why we are not re-
allocating our forces in Europe to the 
real frontline in Poland and the Bal-
tics. Instead of pulling back our troops, 
we should be withdrawing this half- 
baked plan and start over anew with a 
focus on stopping aggression from 
Vladimir Putin and standing behind 
our traditional allies. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The

The bill clerk proceeded to call the

NOMINATION OF DEREK KAN 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise 
today to speak on the nomination of 
Derek Kan to serve as second in com-
mand at the Office of Management and 
Budget. 
It is not every day that I stand here 
and endorse a nomination—a nomi-
nee—of a current President. So I don’t 
want anybody to have a heart attack, 
but I do want to stand up and say that 
this is a good nomination. I wish we 
had more like him. I am pleased that 
at least we have this one today to con-
sider. 
Derek 
Kan 
served 
previously 
as 
Under Secretary for Transportation 
Policy at the Department of Transpor-
tation, where he served as a principal 
adviser to the Secretary and provided 
leadership in the development of poli-
cies at the Department. 
I have a couple of quotes here from 
two of my Democratic colleagues that 
referenced his time at the Department 
of Transportation. One of our Demo-
cratic colleagues from here in the Sen-
ate said these words: ‘‘Mr. Kan, from 
your time at the Department of Trans-
portation, I know you to be a talented 
and thoughtful leader who can work 
collaboratively with Congress and oth-
ers to find common ground.’’ 
Think about those words: ‘‘who can 
work collaboratively with Congress 
and others to find common ground.’’ 
Another 
of 
our 
Democratic 
col-
leagues said of Derek Kan: ‘‘Derek Kan 
is a serious, smart person and a vast 
improvement over the previously men-
tioned names.’’ 
That is a quote. I will say it again: 
‘‘Derek Kan is a serious, smart person 
and a vast improvement over the pre-
viously mentioned names.’’ 
Now, that is not damning with faint 
praise. That is, I think, praise. I think 
it is well earned, and I just wanted to 
share that with you. 
He has been nominated to serve by 
this administration in a number of po-
sitions, and he has gotten the support 
of Democrats and Republicans—not 
unanimous support. I wouldn’t get 
unanimous support if I were nominated 
for something that came through here 
either—but he has gotten strong sup-
port, for the most part. 
I was pleased to be able to vote in 
favor of his confirmation to this par-
ticular position. He was confirmed—at 
that time it was as the Department of 
Transportation Under Secretary, and I 
think he was confirmed in the Senate 
by a vote of 90 to 7. 
Prior to this appointment, Mr. Kan 
served on the Amtrak board of direc-
tors, and he was unanimously con-
firmed to that position by this same 
body. He doesn’t know this, but he and 
I have something in common. We were 
both confirmed—I was sitting Governor 
of Delaware, but I was confirmed to 
serve as the lone Governor at the time 
on Amtrak’s board of directors. And I 
was confirmed unanimously. Somehow 
that slipped through. But that is some-
thing that he and I share in common, 
and he understands well the impor-
tance of the capacity of rail service in 
this country—in this century. 
Mr. Kan is also experienced as a pol-
icy adviser to our current majority 
leader and chief economist for the Sen-
ate Republican Policy Committee. To 
put it bluntly, I think he possesses the 
necessary qualifications and experience 
for this position.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4605 
July 30, 2020 
I have the privilege of serving as the 
senior Democrat on the Homeland Se-
curity Committee with the Presiding 
Officer, and this committee has the re-
sponsibility for vetting individuals who 
have been nominated to serve at the 
Office of Management and Budget. 
During the confirmation process, I 
had the pleasure of speaking with Mr. 
Kan and getting to know him a little 
better and understanding better his 
goals for this important position. Mr. 
Kan clearly showed that he is inti-
mately familiar with the issues that he 
would be tasked with managing at 
OMB, and he showed that he is willing 
to learn and work with others to en-
sure that he is doing everything he can 
to work productively on behalf of the 
American people. 
In fact, Mr. Kan committed to work 
collaboratively with Congress to help 
us fulfill our oversight role. This is a 
shared responsibility: oversight. We all 
need to be interested in oversight. You 
don’t have to serve on a committee 
that 
is 
focused 
on 
oversight—the 
Homeland Security and Governmental 
Affairs Committee. You don’t have to 
serve on a permanent Senate sub-
committee as Senator ROB PORTMAN 
and 
I 
do—the 
Permanent 
Sub-
committee on Investigations—in order 
to be interested in oversight. You don’t 
have to be elected to the U.S. Senate or 
to the House to be interested in over-
sight. This is something that we all 
should be interested in and all of us 
ought to be focused on, and we need to 
do it in a way that is collaborative so 
that we sort of marry our fortunes to-
gether and end up with the synergistic 
effect where the sum is greater than 
the parts thereof. 
I was pleased with the words and the 
commitment he made to work collabo-
ratively with all of us: Democrats and 
Republicans and our staffs. He also 
committed to working with the Gov-
ernment Accountability Office, GAO, 
to help them fulfill their critical over-
sight responsibilities. 
I might add, GAO, which is our 
watchdog, does great work, as the Pre-
siding Officer knows. They have been 
faced with an enormous undertaking, 
enormous challenges, with respect to 
the 
COVID–19 
legislation 
we 
have 
passed and the need for resources to be 
able to do a good job in being the 
watchdog that we need. 
I would just call on all of my col-
leagues to keep that in mind when we 
fashion the next COVID legislation and 
figure out how much money we need to 
provide for GAO to do the enormous 
job that is in front of them. 
It is not often we get a nominee in 
this administration who is open to 
working with both sides here in the 
Congress and is understanding of the 
needs for the executive branch to be re-
sponsive to congressional oversight 
from this administration. In fact, Mr. 
Kan committed to responding to all 
oversight requests from the Homeland 
Security and Governmental Affairs 
Committee, including requests from 
Democratic Senators. He also com-
mitted to ensure that OMB responds to 
all requests from GAO. 
I know these commitments ought to 
be standard operating procedure in our 
democracy, which is built on a system 
of checks and balances, but they cer-
tainly have not always been the case in 
this 
administration, 
especially 
for 
folks nominated to positions like the 
one he has been nominated for. 
Mr. Kan’s willingness to work with 
Congress and his clear qualifications to 
serve in this role are a welcome change 
in a Trump administration nominee 
that deserves to be recognized. For 
those reasons, I intend to support 
Derek Kan, who has been nominated 
for this important position at OMB. I 
urge my colleagues—Democrat, Repub-
lican, and an Independent or two—to 
do the same. 
I have the privilege of serving as the 
senior Democrat on the Environment 
and Public Works Committee. In our 
oversight role there over the Environ-
mental Protection Agency, we ask a 
lot of questions. We ask a lot of ques-
tions of that agency, the leaders of 
that agency. 
We don’t always get the responses 
that we need. In some cases we get the 
back of a hand—no response for days, 
weeks, months. In previous administra-
tions, 
Democratic 
administrations 
where Republican Senators were maybe 
in the minority, they haven’t always 
gotten the kind of response that they 
deserved either, but I think they have 
gotten better than we are getting in 
many cases right now when we try to 
get information out of EPA. 
I think the sort of spirit that I sense 
and have observed in Derek Kan, we 
could use that spirit from some other 
folks who are serving in this adminis-
tration and maybe keep him in mind 
when someday we have a Democratic 
President and a Democratic majority 
in the U.S. Senate. 
So this is a vote I think we are going 
to take in a very short while, and I 
hope, when people come here to vote, 
they will keep in mind some of the 
words I have said and some of the 
words I quoted from other Democratic 
Senators and find a way to vote yes in 
this case. 
We will hold him up to high stand-
ards. I think if he gets confirmed—and 
I think he will—that it is important 
that he continues to demonstrate the 
sort of values that I have found favor-
able in him today. 
I just want to acknowledge that it is 
not every day a Democrat gets to hold 
the gavel at a committee hearing, and 
yesterday Senator GRASSLEY had some 
other business; he had to come over 
and vote on the floor and take care of 
some other business. There was no 
other Republican to take the gavel and 
conduct the hearing, and he called on a 
Senator from Delaware to assume the 
gavel—take the gavel and pound us all 
the way to the finish line in yester-
day’s hearing. 
My wife said to me last night: What 
was the highlight of the day? And I 
said that there were many highlights 
of the day yesterday, but that was 
probably No. 1. 
With that, I yield the floor to my 
friend 
from 
Iowa, 
Senator 
CHUCK 
GRASSLEY. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I do 
thank the Senator from Delaware for 
bailing me out, as we sometimes say in 
Iowa. 
I have two reasons for speaking this 
morning. No. 1, very shortly, this week 
is the 30th year of the Americans with 
Disabilities Act as the law of the land. 
There are plenty of reasons to recog-
nize that law for the landmark that it 
is and how it has helped people advance 
in our society and get more equality, 
but also, I do it because a former col-
league of mine from Iowa, Senator Tom 
Harkin, working along with Senator 
Bob Dole, worked really hard to get 
this landmark civil rights legislation 
signed into law. Since that day, Amer-
ica has continued to improve opportu-
nities, inclusion, and access for indi-
viduals who live with disabilities. 
As my colleagues and I work to de-
feat the virus, heal the racial divide, 
lower prescription drug prices, and re-
store the U.S. economy, let’s take a 
lesson from the passage of the ADA, 
very much a cooperative relationship 
between Republicans and Democrats. 
Let’s work together in good faith and 
work out our differences for the good of 
the American people—whether it was 
the Americans with Disabilities Act or, 
now, efforts to beat the virus and get 
the economy going. 
WHISTLEBLOWERS 
Mr. President, now I speak about an 
issue that each day, each year, every 
year for I don’t know how many years 
I have spoken on this subject, but you 
will soon find out why this is an impor-
tant day to me, as an advocate for 
whistleblowing and the protection of 
whistleblowers. 
Earlier 
this 
month, 
the 
Senate 
unanimously declared today National 
Whistleblower Appreciation Day. Every 
year, we honor whistleblowers on July 
30, and I want to tell you the history of 
that. 
It was on July 30, 1778—I hope you 
heard that right: July 30, 1778—at the 
height of the American Revolutionary 
war that the Continental Congress 
passed the first whistleblower law. 
It did so in support of American sol-
diers who had decided to blow the whis-
tle on their supervisor. That supervisor 
was an American naval commander. It 
seems this commander had not been 
following the rules of war and had been 
brutally 
torturing 
British 
soldiers. 
Knowing his actions were against the 
Navy’s code of ethics, the soldiers de-
cided to blow the whistle to Congress. 
When they did blow that whistle, they 
got the full whistleblower treatment, 
the kind that I hear too often, even 
today. They were sued for libel and 
were thrown into jail.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4606 
July 30, 2020 
Now, that doesn’t happen to maybe a 
lot of whistleblowers in 2020, but whis-
tleblowers are not treated correctly 
yet today. 
Well, Congress wasn’t hearing of how 
they were being treated by being sued 
for libel and being thrown into jail. In 
response to what had happened on July 
30, 
1778, 
the 
Continental 
Congress 
passed the first whistleblower law, 
stating its unequivocal support for the 
soldiers and affirming that it is the 
duty of every person in the country— 
not just government employees but 
every single person—to report wrong-
doing to the proper authorities. 
Congress even covered the legal fees 
of the jailed sailors. 
Now, 242 years later, we find our-
selves in the midst of another crisis, 
the COVID–19 pandemic, and today 
Congress and the American people de-
pend on whistleblowers to tell us about 
wrongdoing just as much as our Found-
ing Fathers did. In fact, we depend on 
them more because, as the government 
gets bigger, the potential for fraud and 
abuse, at the same time, gets bigger. 
So does the potential for cruel retalia-
tion 
against 
our 
Nation’s 
brave 
truthtellers. 
But here is the good news: For every 
rogue commander or manager, this 
country is filled with good, honest, 
hard-working people like those sail-
ors—patriots—who are unafraid to step 
forward and blow the whistle just for a 
simple reason—to do the right thing, to 
get the government to do what the 
laws require, spend money according to 
how the law requires the money be 
spent. 
I can think of no better way of re-
membering and honoring the whistle-
blowers than doing exactly as the Con-
tinental Congress did on that day in 
1778: by renewing our resolve and our 
commitment here and now to pass laws 
that encourage, support, and protect 
whistleblowers; 
by 
telling 
whistle-
blowers through strong legislative ac-
tion that they are patriots and that 
Congress and the American people have 
their backs. 
I myself have several critical whis-
tleblower bills pending before this ses-
sion of Congress that are especially 
crucial in light of the COVID–19 pan-
demic. First and foremost, there is the 
legislation I have been working on to 
strengthen the False Claims Act. As we 
all know, the False Claims Act allows 
whistleblowers to file lawsuits and sue 
fraudsters on behalf of the Federal 
Government. 
The Federal Government should be 
doing that, but the Federal Govern-
ment may not know about it. Or if the 
Federal Government does know about 
it, they may have so many cases they 
can’t deal with. So we allow the citi-
zens, through qui tam-type lawsuits, to 
act in the place of the government. 
This is what my amendments in 1986 to 
the False Claims Act did. 
Those cases, since 1996, have brought 
$62 billion back into the Federal Treas-
ury. The False Claims Act has never 
been more important than it is right 
now this very year—34 years after I got 
it passed. That is because the massive 
increase on government funding to ad-
dress the COVID–19 crisis has created 
new opportunities for fraudsters trying 
to cheat the government and steal 
hard-earned taxpayers’ dollars. I heard 
some of this on Tuesday in my com-
mittee from people in Homeland Secu-
rity who have been running down, ei-
ther costing the taxpayers money or 
just receiving bad quality products to 
protect our healthcare people. 
It is especially ironic, considering all 
of this, that the Department of Justice 
has been continuing its recent practice 
of dismissing charges in many of the 
false claims cases brought by whistle-
blowers without the Department of 
Justice even stating its reasons. This is 
definitely not the right approach. 
If there are serious allegations of 
fraud against the government, the At-
torney General should have to state 
the legitimate reasons for deciding not 
to pursue them in court. That is just 
common sense. 
My legislation clarifies the ambigu-
ities created by the courts and reins in 
this practice that undermines the pur-
pose of my 1996 amendments to the 
False Claims Act, which was to em-
power whistleblowers. And remember, 
you shouldn’t weaken a piece of legis-
lation that has brought $62 billion of 
fraudulently taken money back into 
the Federal Treasury. This legislation 
requires the Justice Department to 
state its reasons. 
What is wrong with telling people 
why you are dropping the case and pro-
vide whistleblowers who bring the 
cases an opportunity to be heard when-
ever it decides to drop a false claims 
case? 
These problems I am bringing up 
with the Department of Justice remind 
me of the initial carrying out of the 
false claims amendments that I got 
passed in 1986. The Department of Jus-
tice resented some citizen coming in 
and being able to go to court and get 
justice for the taxpayers because it 
made it look like the Department of 
Justice wasn’t doing its job. So what? 
We are helping the taxpayers. We are 
enforcing the law. 
I thought around 1992 or 1993 that 
they got over it and moved ahead with 
it. But even yet in 1992, Attorney Gen-
eral Barr, then—and I don’t know 
whether he was Attorney General then 
or just a citizen—even claimed that the 
False Claims Act’s amendments I got 
passed were unconstitutional. 
By the time he got 30 years later, 
coming back into government—and my 
questioning him about it—he did say 
that he felt that the False Claims Act 
was 
constitutional. 
That 
is 
big 
progress from 1992, when you thought 
it was unconstitutional. 
We still seem to have some problems 
with the Justice Department, but this 
bill should not be necessary, but I have 
to pursue it anyway at the present 
time. 
Mr. President, on another matter, 
during the pandemic, there has also 
been a dramatic increase in whistle-
blower complaints filed with the SEC. 
Whistleblowers have been calling at-
tention to scam artists peddling coun-
terfeit and substandard medical goods 
and phony cures to the consumers. 
The 
Whistleblower 
Programs 
Im-
provement Act, which I introduced last 
year, strengthens protections for SEC 
and the Commodity Futures Trading 
Commission whistleblowers. It requires 
the SEC and CFTC to make timely de-
cisions 
regarding 
whistleblower 
re-
wards. 
We are now waiting for the Senate 
Banking Committee to sign off on the 
SEC portions of the bill, which the SEC 
supports. I just had a conversation 
with the chairman of the SEC on this 
very point within the last hour. 
I am also working on legislation that 
will provide timely, critical protection 
to whistleblowers working in our na-
tion’s law enforcement agencies. Of 
course, I have been having a national 
conversation—we all have been having 
a national conversation lately—about 
the role of law enforcement in our 
country. I firmly believe that law en-
forcement officers play a critical role 
in maintaining our system of justice. 
They are there to protect the constitu-
tional rights of our citizens and never, 
of course, to do harm or infringe upon 
those constitutional rights. 
For decades, it has been unlawful for 
law enforcement officers to work on 
any level to infringe on the constitu-
tional rights of Americans. And when-
ever the Attorney General has cause to 
believe law enforcement is overstep-
ping its bounds and infringing on those 
rights, he has the legal authority to in-
tervene and pursue action on behalf of 
the United States to stop the practice 
and hold those responsible accountable. 
Of course, the Attorney General can’t 
prosecute what he doesn’t know about. 
It is law enforcement officers them-
selves who are out there on the 
frontlines protecting all of us. 
Congress and the American people 
depend on them to be vigilant and to 
speak up if they see something hap-
pening that they know is wrong. Those 
who do choose to step forward and re-
port violations in accordance with our 
Federal laws deserve Federal whistle-
blower protections. That is why I am 
working to ensure that law enforce-
ment whistleblowers who report viola-
tions of the constitutional rights of 
American citizens to Congress and the 
Justice Department are guaranteed 
simple 
whistleblower 
protections, 
which we give to a lot of other people. 
Another whistleblower bill currently 
awaiting passage is my Criminal Anti-
trust Anti-Retaliation Act. This legis-
lation strengthens protections for pri-
vate sector whistleblowers who report 
violations of antitrust laws. The bill 
was passed by the Senate last October 
and has been pending before the House 
of Representatives ever since. 
The House tries to argue that the 
Senate is the legislative graveyard. We

hear that from people across the Ro-
tunda on almost anything and any day. 
But here is a case where its delayed ac-
tion on this bill suggests that it isn’t 
always the Senate that isn’t consid-
ering this legislation. 
Each of these bills fills a critical void 
in our current whistleblower laws, and 
each one ought to receive consider-
ation and an up-or-down vote before 
the end of this Congress. Of course, if 
that is going to happen, Congress needs 
to pick up its pace. It needs to take a 
cue from those strong actions taken by 
the Congress—the Continental Con-
gress, let me emphasize, during the 
American Revolution, a body that saw 
the need, took the time, and devoted 
necessary resources to stand up for 
whistleblowers in the midst of a war 
for the very existence of our country. 
Today, let’s all take a moment to re-
flect on the high standards that those 
early Americans set for us back on 
July 30, 1778, and let’s remember never 
to let excuses or partisan differences 
keep us from pursuing our common in-
terests in passing strong, meaningful 
whistleblower laws. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
FISCHER). The Senator from Wisconsin. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST 
Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, 
back in February 2020, before the 
COVID recession, there were 158.8 mil-
lion Americans employed. We have 
gone through a lot. COVID is probably 
the most significant event—certainly 
in my lifetime—affecting people’s lives, 
the tragedies we have seen, affecting 
our economy, affecting the Federal 
budget. 
At the end of June, there were 142 
million Americans employed. That is a 
reduction of 16.6 million Americans or 
10.5 percent. I want people to remember 
that 10.5 percent. 
Over the last month or so, there have 
been a number of respected economists 
who made forecasts of how much our 
economy is going to shrink. These are 
folks from the IMF and CBO and the 
Federal Reserve Board of Governors, 
economists at Morgan Stanley and 
Goldman Sachs. The range of what 
they are predicting our economy will 
shrink to is somewhere between 4.6 per-
cent and 8 percent. This is causing eco-
nomic devastation—a real human toll 
on real people. 
As a result of that, Congress acted. 
We acted fast. We acted swiftly. We 
acted massively. We wanted to provide 
financial help to individuals who were 
unemployed all of a sudden through no 
fault of their own. We wanted to help 
provide financial need to businesses 
that were viable, that can hopefully 
survive and rehire and help us recover 
from this COVID recession. We also 
wanted to make sure we provided 
enough liquidity in the market so we 
wouldn’t see any kind of seizing up and 
see real financial devastation. 
The result of all that was that within 
a very short period of time, by the end 
of April, we had already passed four 
different financial relief packages to-
taling $2.9 trillion. We just held an 
oversight hearing in my committee 2 
days ago. There is even dispute on that 
number. Some witnesses said it is close 
to $3.6 trillion. I am going to use $2.9 
trillion as a minimum. 
To relate that to what I just talked 
about, that represents about 13.5 per-
cent of our economy. Again, employ-
ment is down 10.5 percent. Economists 
are predicting our economy will shrink 
somewhere between 4.6 percent and 8 
percent. But we acted swiftly and mas-
sively. We knew what we were going to 
enact was far from perfect. We all un-
derstood that. It was far from perfect, 
but it worked, and we had to do it. 
We passed an amount equal to 13.5 
percent of last year’s GDP. Less than a 
month later, Speaker PELOSI and her 
House Democrats passed a fifth pack-
age out of the House worth $3 trillion— 
$3 trillion. I am sorry. That is not a se-
rious attempt at financial relief. If we 
add that to the $2.9 trillion, that would 
represent 27.5 percent of last year’s 
economy. 
Again, employment is down 10.5 per-
cent. 
Our 
economy 
will 
probably 
shrink by no more than 8 percent. Yet 
Speaker PELOSI and House Democrats 
wanted to increase the amount of debt 
burden on our children by passing a 
package that would bring the total re-
lief package up to 27.5 percent of our 
GDP. It is not serious. 
It should surprise no one when Lead-
er MCCONNELL and Chief of Staff Mead-
ows and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, 
as they tried to forge a deal with 
Speaker of the House PELOSI and Mi-
nority Leader SCHUMER, that they 
couldn’t reach a deal; that there was 
probably no goalpost that they will not 
move to make sure that doesn’t hap-
pen. 
But 
the 
problem 
with 
that 
ap-
proach—and I would call it a very cyn-
ical, political approach, really playing 
with people’s lives and livelihood—is 
that tomorrow the Federal unemploy-
ment extension that we passed as part 
of the CARES Act—because we realized 
we wanted to try to help everybody 
who was unemployed because of the 
COVID recession—expires. 
As I said, the CARES Act was far 
from perfect. I certainly did not want 
one of the provisions. I voted against 
it. I actually supported the amendment 
of the Senator from Florida to reduce 
the $600 flat payment. That is a real 
problem because it represents some-
thing like 134 percent of average wages, 
and we are creating a very perverse in-
centive for people to remain unem-
ployed when our economy is calling for 
more workers. 
I want to quote an economic adviser 
to both Presidents Clinton and Presi-
dent Obama, Larry Summers. He once 
stated: 
The second way government assistance 
programs contribute to long-term unemploy-
ment is by providing an incentive, and the 
means, not to work. Each unemployed per-
son has a ‘‘reservation wage’’—the minimum 
wage he or she insists on getting before ac-
cepting a job. Unemployment insurance and 
other social assistance programs increase 
the reservation wage, causing an unem-
ployed person to remain unemployed longer. 
We want to avoid that situation. We 
want to help workers, but we want to 
avoid the situation where we prolong 
unemployment or create a sense for 
people to stay on unemployment insur-
ance. The fact is that, according to a 
University of Chicago study, 68 percent 
of people collecting unemployment are 
making more on unemployment than 
they made when they were working. 
CBO estimates something between five 
out of six people currently collecting 
unemployment are making more not 
working than working. The Bureau of 
Labor statistics at the end of May said 
there were 5.4 million jobs open—not 
being filled. 
We have a problem. We have two 
problems. We can’t do a deal because I 
don’t believe our friends on the other 
side of the aisle are serious about doing 
a deal. But we have unemployment ex-
piring, and the current provision was 
too generous to create a perverse in-
centive. 
I have introduced a piece of legisla-
tion that I have cosponsored with the 
Senator from Indiana and the Senator 
from Florida, who would also like to 
speak 
to 
this. 
It 
is 
called 
the 
Coronavirus Relief Fair Unemployment 
Compensation Act. There is no fancy 
acronym. It describes what the bill 
does. It extends Federal plus-up for un-
employment to the end of the year. 
The COVID recession is not ending 
any time soon. Rather than having to 
come back and do this over and over 
again and increase the anxiety on 
Americans who are unemployed, let’s 
extend this to the end of December. 
Our bill gives States the option of ei-
ther a $200 flat plus-up or a plus-up 
equal to no more than two-thirds of an 
individual’s average wage, not to ex-
ceed $500. The States have the option. 
If they can’t handle the two-thirds 
plus-up, they can accept the $200 flat 
plus-up. 
In case our Democratic colleagues 
are going to complain about that as 
not being generous enough, two-thirds 
of weekly wages is exactly what the 
House passed in phase 2 of the COVID 
relief package. Two-thirds of average 
wages is what they set as the amount 
of money for paid sick and family 
leave. 
I also want to point out that $200 a 
week is eight times the amount the 
Democrats, back in 2008 and 2009—I 
think 2009—passed as part of the great 
recession relief package. They passed 
$25 per week plus-up, so $200 per week 
plus-up is eight times that. 
Again, we, as Republicans, are trying 
to meet them already more than half-
way to do a deal on unemployment. 
Again, those individuals who are with-
out a job through no fault of their own 
have the comfort and relief that they 
will have assistance from the Federal 
Government.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4608 
July 30, 2020 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana. 
Mr. BRAUN. Just 5 months ago, we 
had the hottest economy in 37 years. 
Running a business—starting it from 
Main Street as a little company—it 
was lucky enough to grow over those 37 
years. Three of my four kids run it 
now. 
The reason I ran for the Senate was 
to make sure we had that kind of at-
mosphere in place for the productive 
economy, the enterprising, the hard- 
working Americans who work at com-
panies on Main Street. 
Since COVID arrived, of course, it 
shocked us all. We know it is a tricky 
foe. It has peculiarities. Yet the one 
thing that is certain is that we need to 
get back to the economy that was rais-
ing wages for those most in need, was 
doing it in a real way, and not through 
government. 
Yes, government needs to get in-
volved now and then, and this was the 
case. Like the Senator from Wisconsin 
stated, we moved quickly, and we did 
something. 
What I see on the other side of the 
aisle, with this monstrosity of $3.5 tril-
lion, is an effort beyond just addressing 
the displacement from COVID–19. I see 
it as an effort to try to replace Main 
Street and the productive economy. It 
doesn’t work through here, and we 
should have never, back in late March, 
had 
something 
that 
would 
have 
incentivized not working. Of course, we 
tried to fix it, but friends on the other 
side of the aisle did not agree with us. 
If we want to get back to some form of 
a new normal—sooner or later, when 
we whip this foe, COVID–19—and back 
to what it was before, we can’t do it 
through government. 
When you look at not only this bill 
they have but at the other stuff that 
we need to keep in mind in leading up 
to the election, we cannot afford it, 
and it doesn’t make sense. It is replac-
ing enterprisers, Main Street—every-
thing that makes this country great— 
with a bloated Federal Government. 
When I heard that this bill was out 
there—coming from a quick-footed en-
trepreneur now here in the Senate—I 
didn’t hesitate at all to get on it. We 
need to do this because we need to cut 
to the chase. We have hard-working 
Americans who are still unemployed. 
They have gotten displaced out of that 
great economy. This takes care of that 
without putting into place something 
that is so broad, so expansive, and that 
does not address the essence of what is 
at issue here. It makes sure there is a 
pathway so that we can get back to 
that Trump economy—that economy 
which was working more for everyone 
than at any time ever before. Don’t ask 
people who have been here in the busi-
ness of government. Why don’t you ask 
people who have been running busi-
nesses, who have been on Main Street, 
who have been doing it? 
That is why we need to get this 
across the finish line. It addresses the 
key thing that we need to do tran-
sitionally so that we may get back to 
where Main Street and the real econ-
omy are running things and where 
there is not an attempt by the other 
side to replace what has been making 
the economy work. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, I 
thank the Senator from Indiana for 
acting quickly in cosponsoring this 
piece of legislation. 
I now yield to the Senator from Flor-
ida. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, I thank the senior Senator from 
Wisconsin and the junior Senator from 
Indiana for their hard work in address-
ing the out-of-control spending of the 
Federal Government and for finding 
ways to assist Americans who need 
help in the midst of this pandemic. 
The coronavirus is a crisis that has 
demanded action to protect Americans, 
but if we are not careful, Congress is 
going to create another devastating 
crisis down the road, one of our own 
doing. Our national debt and deficits— 
already at unsustainable levels—have 
skyrocketed as Congress has spent al-
most $3 trillion to address this crisis. 
Even if you remove the Paycheck Pro-
tection Program that has kept workers 
on payrolls, the total amount spent by 
Congress to respond to the pandemic 
and help workers amounts to more 
than $50,000 per unemployed American. 
Do you think any unemployed Amer-
ican has received anything close to 
$50,000? Of course not. That is because 
every dollar spent by Congress seems 
to be spent in the least efficient way 
possible. 
Now Congress is negotiating a new 
spending bill of at least $1 trillion 
without even understanding if or how 
the $3 trillion already allocated has 
been spent. You would never operate a 
business like that. You would never op-
erate your household like that. Gov-
ernment should not be able to get away 
with it. 
In June, I and Senators JOHNSON and 
CRUZ asked all 50 States how they have 
allocated the trillions of dollars in tax-
payer funding they have received from 
the 
Federal 
Government 
for 
the 
coronavirus response. So far, the ma-
jority of States has refused our re-
quest. Instead of telling us how they 
are being responsible with American 
taxpayer 
dollars, 
they 
want 
more 
money from the Federal Government. 
Where is the oversight and account-
ability? It doesn’t exist in Washington 
right now. 
I am thankful that my friends Sen-
ators JOHNSON and BRAUN are focused 
on protecting our future and reining in 
Washington’s excess. Instead of just 
throwing money at every problem, my 
colleagues are actually thinking about 
the impact this spending will have on 
the future of our children and grand-
children and how we are impacting our 
ability to fund our military and our 
safety nets like Social Security, Medi-
care, and Medicaid. 
Over my 8 years as the Governor of 
Florida, we completely turned our 
economy around by making hard budg-
etary decisions, by cutting taxes and 
regulations, and by making sure we got 
a return on every taxpayer dollar. Sen-
ators JOHNSON and BRAUN and I all 
come from business backgrounds, and 
we understand that you just can’t 
spend without having accountability. 
You have to invest wisely. 
We have to start doing the exact 
same thing at the Federal level be-
cause, at some point, someone is going 
to have to pay for it. If we don’t start 
acting in a more fiscally responsible 
manner, our children and our grand-
children are no longer going to have 
the same opportunities we all have had 
to live the American dream, and that is 
actually not fair. 
It is time we take this seriously. The 
best way to help people right now is to 
get our economy reopened, to support 
businesses by cutting taxes and regula-
tions, and to ensure that we have 
ample testing and PPE across the 
country. That is how we get back on 
track. That needs to be our focus in 
going forward. 
I thank my colleagues for their hard 
work in trying to make sure we don’t 
waste people’s money and to make sure 
we take care of the people who actually 
need help right now. 
I yield to Senator JOHNSON. 
Mr. JOHNSON. I thank the Senator 
from Florida for his words of support. 
Madam President, as if in legislative 
session, I ask unanimous consent that 
the Senate proceed to the immediate 
consideration of my bill at the desk. I 
further ask that the bill be considered 
read a third time and passed and that 
the motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Democratic leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, in 
reserving the right to object, let’s talk 
about how we got here. 
For over 3 months, our Republican 
colleagues have dithered, dallied, and 
not taken seriously the most enormous 
health crisis we have had in 100 years 
and the most enormous economic crisis 
we have had in 75 years. Now, all of a 
sudden, in the last day or two, they see 
the cliff. There are many cliffs, but 
they see the cliff of unemployment in-
surance running out. 
We have been asking them to nego-
tiate on this for a very long time. We 
have had nothing. Speaker PELOSI and 
I asked Leader MCCONNELL to sit down 
with us almost a month ago, and he 
would not. So we got here because our 
Republican 
colleagues 
couldn’t 
get 
their act together. They still don’t 
have their act together, and now they 
are worried. Yet, instead of being seri-
ous about negotiating, they have cre-
ated 
a 
stunt, 
which 
shows 
how 
unserious the Republicans are at com-
ing to an agreement.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4609 
July 30, 2020 
I dare say, if this bill were voted on 
by the floor, a large number of Repub-
licans—perhaps a majority—would vote 
against it. It would fail in the Senate 
by a large margin and would never pass 
the House. 
Instead of engaging in this stunt of 
trying to get the heat of America off 
their backs, they ought to do some-
thing real, which is to sit down and se-
riously negotiate with the Democrats 
about this issue. 
This proposal, amazingly enough, is 
even stingier than the one the Repub-
licans introduced a few days ago. In-
stead of giving workers who lost their 
jobs through no fault of their own a 30- 
percent pay cut, they give them a 33- 
percent pay cut. It is just so wrong, 
and if you look at all of the data, it has 
been rejected by the American people. 
My colleague from Indiana says—and 
I know he is sincere—you can’t solve 
this problem through the government. 
I have news for you. When you have the 
greatest economic crisis in 75 years and 
the greatest health crisis in 100 years, 
the private sector cannot solve this 
problem. That is one of the reasons you 
guys are all tied in a knot—you must 
have the government get involved, and 
you don’t want to do that. 
I hear my friend from Florida talk 
about the deficit. Well, that didn’t 
matter when we passed a $1.5 trillion 
tax break for the wealthiest people and 
the biggest corporations in America. 
The deficit didn’t matter then, but 
when it is helping working people who 
have lost their jobs, when it is helping 
small businesses get on their feet, 
when it is helping to feed children, 
when it is helping to keep people in 
their homes and apartments, then we 
hear about the deficit. 
Let me tell you what is wrong with 
this proposal. There are two basic rea-
sons. 
One, it doesn’t work on its own. As I 
said, No. 1, it is even stingier than the 
original proposal. They are moving 
backward—our 
Republican 
friends 
are—and they are giving workers an 
even greater pay cut than they had be-
fore. 
Second, the pandemic unemployment 
insurance has kept millions out of pov-
erty. We all work to keep people out of 
poverty. This has worked. If we cut it 
back, it is estimated that millions will 
fall back into poverty and that mil-
lions will go in it. 
The third is one of the few things we 
hear about to get the economy going. If 
you talk to our economists—liberal 
and conservative—they will tell you 
the No. 1 thing preventing the economy 
from getting worse is consumer spend-
ing. This bill puts money in people’s 
pockets, and they spend it. Even con-
servative economists say it is very 
much needed to get the economy going. 
Fourth, it can’t work. We have called 
a whole bunch of State governments 
and State unemployment offices. They 
cannot implement this plan imme-
diately, and many say it would take 
months. I know that the Senator from 
Wisconsin has given States an option 
of cutting the thing to $200 or getting 
67 percent. Many States say they will 
never be able to implement the 67-per-
cent part and that people will be stuck 
with that big cut. 
The main point on that is that many 
States will not be able to implement 
this new plan for weeks or even 
months, and people will not have their 
money. 
So the No. 1 thing that is wrong with 
this proposal is that, just on the merits 
itself, it fails by giving a big pay cut, 
by pushing more people into poverty, 
by taking money out of our economy 
that consumers can spend, and because 
it is fundamentally unworkable. 
There is another reason. We have a 
lot of problems. 
In a few minutes, I, the Senator from 
Oregon, and the Senator from Michigan 
will ask unanimous consent to pass the 
Heroes Act. 
We have a lot of cliffs. As of Thurs-
day, hundreds of thousands—and soon 
millions—could be evicted from their 
apartments. This bill does nothing 
about that cliff. 
As of this week—and next week’s 
being a new month—State and local 
governments will be running out of 
money. Already, 1.5 million State and 
local workers have been laid off, and 
more will be laid off. That is a cliff. 
What are we doing about that? 
Testing. If you go to any place in 
America, including the three States we 
are talking about here, people have to 
wait days and weeks for their test re-
sults, and some don’t even ever get 
their test results back. 
We are not going to solve this prob-
lem until we solve the coronavirus 
problem. We all know that President 
Trump and this administration have 
failed on testing. Almost every other 
Western country that has dealt with 
this issue—in Western Europe or East 
Asia—is way ahead of us. We should be 
ashamed. We have a President who has 
dithered and has not taken seriously 
the testing regime. The Heroes Act 
fixes that problem, and we are not 
going to fix our economy until we fix 
the healthcare problem, my friends. 
The Heroes Act does many, many 
other things, like getting people back 
to school, not like Donald Trump does 
in pushing people back to school even 
if it is not safe. Well, remember what 
he did in Arizona? in Texas? in Florida? 
He pushed the State Governors to get 
people back. Now look at what has hap-
pened. The same thing will happen in 
the schools if we are not careful. We 
have help there, which my good friend 
from Wisconsin’s bill doesn’t even men-
tion. That is another cliff. 
We have a month before school 
starts, and this bill—skinny or stingy— 
is not up to the moment. It is not even 
close to being up to the moment. 
It is amazing that we have such a cri-
sis in America and that our Republican 
friends in the Senate and the White 
House and the House cannot even face 
up to the problem. They are obsessed 
with saying we shouldn’t spend any 
money. Well, believe me, if we don’t 
spend any money, things will get 
worse, and we will have to spend more 
later. 
This is the dilemma we are in be-
cause of COVID. It is no one’s fault, but 
that is the dilemma we are in, and it is 
being made so much worse by this 
President. We don’t hear a peep from 
the other side about how the President 
has messed this up. Instead, we get this 
stunt to try to show they want to do 
something that they know won’t pass 
and know won’t solve the problem. 
So I am going to offer a unanimous 
consent request in a few minutes to 
pass the Heroes Act, which has already 
passed the House, so it would do some 
real good. It covers all the areas I men-
tioned and does a far better job at deal-
ing with the unemployment situation 
than my good friend from Wisconsin’s 
bill. 
I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Wisconsin. 
Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, a 
quick response. The Democratic leader 
states this is not adequate. Again, I 
would remind the Senate that in 2009, 
when they passed a Federal plus-up for 
unemployment benefits—total Demo-
cratic control—they passed $25 a week. 
So the $200 a week is eight times what 
they passed in 2009. Apparently, they 
felt that was adequate back then. 
There was also a study out of the 
University of Chicago that a $200 plus- 
up on State unemployment benefits 
coming from the Federal Government 
replaces more than 100 percent of 
wages for 20 percent of the workers 
currently unemployed. The other 80 
percent get replacement that ranges up 
to 100 percent. 
Again, this is a very generous pro-
posal. And, of course, the option of 
two-thirds is exactly what the House 
passed in phase 2 of the coronavirus re-
lief packages—two-thirds of weekly 
wages for paid sick and paid family 
leave. Now, all of a sudden, it is inad-
equate. And of course their solution— 
what they are going to offer—is an-
other $3 trillion, further mortgaging 
our children’s future when we haven’t 
spent about $1.2 trillion of the $2.9 tril-
lion we have already authorized. 
It is not a serious proposal, which is 
why Leader MCCONNELL could not ne-
gotiate, because they weren’t negoti-
ating in good faith. The Democrats are 
being cynical. This is not a serious 
offer. 
This is a very serious and, quite hon-
estly, more than generous offer to help 
Americans and alleviate the anxiety 
they are going to be feeling if the 
Democrats just simply decide to reject 
this. It is very unfortunate, but that is 
the state of play in the Senate. It is 
very sad. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
first, before I do my UC, I would re-
mind my good friend—I remind myself

July 30, 2020 
to take off my mask—I would remind 
my good friend that it took us 10 years 
to get out of the crisis of 2008. Unem-
ployment stayed high. Job numbers 
stayed high. Looking at 2008 as a model 
for recovery is not anything anyone 
would want to do. 
In a few minutes, I am going to offer 
the Heroes Act as a unanimous consent 
alternative, and I mentioned before the 
many things it does. But let me just 
say in the larger sense, we have an 
enormous crisis in America. We have 
higher unemployment than we have 
ever had since the Depression. Today, 
the 150,000th death was recorded. Thus 
far, the Trump administration, fol-
lowed by the Republican Senate, has 
been an abject failure at dealing with 
that crisis. 
It would have been much better if the 
President had done what chiefs of state 
in Europe and Asia did—stepped up to 
the plate, implemented testing, and 
put adequate money in people’s pock-
ets. We might be more on the road to 
recovery, like those other countries 
are. 
Aren’t 
my 
Republican 
friends 
ashamed that Europe and Asia did bet-
ter than us, the greatest country in the 
world? And do you know why? Because 
of the very philosophy my colleagues 
have 
mentioned—don’t 
spend 
any 
money, and, in President Trump’s 
view, ignore the crisis. It will go away 
when the weather gets warm. Everyone 
has testing, he said, back in March. 
We Democrats feel the pain in Amer-
ica. We feel the pain of people who 
have lost their jobs through no fault of 
their own. We feel the pain of small 
business people who have struggled to 
build their businesses for decades—my 
dad was a small business man—and 
then they lose those businesses. We feel 
the pain of parents who can’t feed their 
kids. We feel the pain of moms and 
dads who are worried about whether 
they can send their kids back to school 
safely. We feel the pain of people when 
they get tested and they have to wait 
days, weeks to get a result, when the 
test means nothing. 
Our responsibility as Democrats and 
Republicans is to get something done, 
something real—not a stunt, not some-
thing stingy, and not something that is 
so narrow, it only deals with one as-
pect of the problem, inadequately at 
that. That is why we are offering the 
Heroes Act. It is not perfect. There are 
a few things some people might add. 
But it is a heck of a lot better to meet 
this crisis than what we have seen from 
our Republican friends—a bill that, as I 
said, moves backward, is stingy, and 
probably wouldn’t get the support of a 
majority of Republicans if it were put 
on the floor, let alone any of us. 
Of course we have to do something. 
The Heroes Act is the right thing to do. 
But I want to make one prediction for 
everyone who is worried about the fu-
ture here. If the past is prologue, some-
thing very close to the Heroes Act will 
be enacted. Look at COVID 2, COVID 3, 
and COVID 3.5. In each case, the initial 
Republican reaction was similar to the 
reaction we have heard this morning: 
Can’t do it. We will dare the Democrats 
to block us. 
It didn’t work. The public was on our 
side. But more importantly, once the 
Republicans 
showed 
they 
couldn’t 
bully anybody and couldn’t put a pro-
posal on the floor, an inadequate bill, 
and pass it, they came to the table and 
negotiated. 
We are still waiting for Leader 
MCCONNELL to go into that room with 
Mnuchin and Meadows and PELOSI and 
me. We are waiting for our Republican 
Senate colleagues to come up with a 
coherent plan that can get their sup-
port. We are still waiting for the Presi-
dent to understand the gravity of this 
situation and do something about it, 
for God’s sake. 
I believe, if this is objected to, within 
a little while, our Republican friends 
will feel the pressure from their con-
stituents and from national media to 
realize that they have to come and ne-
gotiate in good faith on a bold, strong, 
comprehensive bill that will pass. 
Before I ask consent for the Heroes 
Act, I will yield first to my colleague 
from Oregon and then to my colleague 
from Michigan. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, this 
morning showed why we need the 
Democratic approach to dealing with 
unemployment insurance and why the 
pain that was reported this morning 
would get even worse under the pro-
posal offered by Senator JOHNSON. 
This morning, Americans learned 
that our economy cratered in the sec-
ond quarter—essentially, GDP dropped 
by 9.5 percent from April through June. 
That translates to a 33-percent annual 
contraction of the American economy. 
So what you have with today’s analysis 
is a gross domestic product in free fall. 
If Republicans slash unemployment 
benefits with this proposal, the gross 
domestic product is going to fall faster, 
and the economy will collapse. 
Folks, the economists, people who 
aren’t political figures, told us this 
morning—this is a five-alarm fire. It is 
the biggest and fastest drop ever re-
corded, colleagues, wiping out years of 
economic gains in a matter of weeks. 
The fact is, when you take the kind 
of 
economic 
hammering 
that 
we 
learned about this morning, and you 
have the Democratic approach with re-
spect to supercharged unemployment— 
what we wrote in the Finance Com-
mittee, that Secretary Mnuchin signed 
off on, the $600 per week, which finally 
included those people who nobody even 
talked about in the 1920s, gig workers 
and part-timers and independent con-
tractors—they got a fair shake. 
The reason we thought it was so im-
portant to supercharge those benefits 
and why we feel so strongly about 
doing it now, with an additional $600 
per week, is so that people can make 
rent and pay groceries, while all these 
folks are out of work. And we learned 
again about thousands and thousands 
of more workers in every part of the 
country getting hit again with layoffs. 
When jobless Americans receive unem-
ployment benefits, it becomes one of 
the biggest booster shots for the Amer-
ican economy. When jobless Americans 
receive unemployment benefits, and 
they spend it on food, they spend it on 
car payments, they spend it on rent, 
and they spend it on medical bills. It is 
part of the gross domestic product. It 
makes no sense—it makes no sense, 
colleagues—to take that support away, 
as the Senator from Wisconsin seeks to 
do. 
One point four million people have 
filed for unemployment benefits this 
past week. Before the pandemic, unem-
ployment claims had never crossed 
700,000 in a single week, not even dur-
ing the great recession. They have now 
been at 1.3 million or higher for 19 
straight weeks. 
So here the Senate is, a few hours 
after seeing the worst domestic prod-
uct report ever recorded, and what is 
the response of the Senate Repub-
licans? To slash unemployment even 
more than they originally proposed, 
yanking an economic lifeline from 30 
million Americans and delivering an 
economic wrecking ball directly into 
our fragile economy. 
The last point I want to make—and 
we 
have 
Senator 
STABENOW, 
my 
seatmate on the Finance Committee, 
here—is to highlight the fact that from 
the 
beginning, 
Senate 
Republicans 
were hostile to the idea of trying to 
give a fair shake to these workers and 
these families who were hit so hard. 
Eugene Scalia—the first thing he 
said after we did that work in the Fi-
nance Committee—the first thing he 
said was not ‘‘Oh, we have to do our job 
administering the benefits.’’ The first 
thing he said was that his big concern 
is that unemployed people are going to 
be dependent on government. How pre-
posterous. 
I see my friend Senator BROWN here, 
who spends a big chunk of his waking 
hours talking about the dignity of 
work. So much for the dignity of work 
when you hear about what Eugene 
Scalia said. 
I hosted a nationwide townhall meet-
ing just a couple of nights ago, and 
there were workers from the Midwest, 
and they said: People are saying we 
don’t want to work. If I get a job offer 
at night, I will be there the first thing 
in the morning, ready to go. 
This is not about workers being un-
able to work; it is about scarcity of 
jobs, just the way those figures this 
morning pointed out. 
So I think that we are going to have 
further discussion on other issues, but 
I just want to mention one last point 
before yielding. 
Today we heard some remarkable 
comments about how Donald Trump— 
and I guess this was his musing, but 
whenever he muses, it actually some-
times is part of a strategy—he talked 
about putting off the election and that

July 30, 2020 
the problem being that people would be 
voting by mail. Now, there is not a 
shred of evidence—not a shred of evi-
dence—that this is a problem. 
The reason it is not a problem—and I 
don’t say it just because I am the Na-
tion’s first mail-in U.S. Senator; take 
the word of far-right conservatives— 
the late Dennis Richardson in our 
State, about as conservative as you 
get. One of the last things he did before 
he passed was he pointed out that there 
is no voter fraud in our vote-by-mail 
elections. He said it doesn’t happen. A 
conservative. A rock-ribbed conserv-
ative. 
So we just heard that comment this 
morning, Leader SCHUMER. Of course, 
the law says that he can’t change the 
election, but it shows again why it is 
so important to have the elections pro-
vision from the Heroes Act—which I 
was honored to work with Speaker 
PELOSI on—be part of the way in which 
people vote this fall because they 
shouldn’t have to choose between vot-
ing or their health. Most of the poll 
workers in America are over the age of 
60, they shouldn’t be put at risk, which 
is obviously what Donald Trump would 
be willing to do. 
So the Heroes bill—we are now going 
to talk about, I believe, the nutrition 
part, which Senator STABENOW
has 
championed so eloquently. 
But I wanted to take a moment to 
focus on the economic numbers that 
came out this morning and how the Re-
publican proposal would make our abil-
ity to fight what was described a few 
hours ago worse and also talk about 
the fiasco of Donald Trump’s efforts 
every single day to chip away at peo-
ple’s opportunities to vote-by-mail and 
in other ways. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I 
am really proud to stand with a group 
of colleagues and leaders who under-
stand what is happening to the Amer-
ican people and the hardship they are 
facing and the fact that they just want 
some help and they want people to un-
derstand that. We are in the middle of 
a pandemic. It is not done yet. We 
know we have to wrap our arms around 
what is happening with the healthcare 
pandemic before we can do anything 
else, but in the meantime we have an 
economic crisis, and we have a hunger 
crisis in this country. 
It is very hard for me to listen to 
folks—all of us, none of us are worried 
about going hungry tonight, not one. 
My guess is, we are not worried about 
our grandkids or others whom we know 
going hungry tonight or our moms and 
dads, but there are 14 million kids 
right now who aren’t getting what they 
need to eat and could very likely go 
hungry tonight. They need a safety 
net. 
You know, when I look at what is the 
priority here with Senate Republicans, 
you know who gets a safety net? Wall 
Street gets a safety net. The stock 
market gets a safety net. The Sec-
retary of Treasury will say: Hey, what 
do you guys need? We are backing you 
up. We got your back. But for the fami-
lies of our country who, through no 
fault of their own, have been put into a 
situation where they have to worry 
about a roof over their head and food 
on the table and dollars to be able to 
pay the bills through help with unem-
ployment, our colleagues say we have 
the audacity to think that they ought 
to have a safety net, too; that the ma-
jority of Americans ought to know 
that somebody’s got their back. 
We are here to say that we are the 
ones who have their back, and we hope 
that before this is done, the Senate and 
the House will come together to do 
that. 
Right now, there are senior citizens— 
a lot of them—who get a minimum 
amount of monthly help for their food. 
It is $16 a month, not a week—a month. 
We have the audacity to stand here and 
want to pass a Heroes Act that would 
raise that to $30 a month, and our col-
leagues will object to a $14-a-month 
raise for our poorest senior citizens. 
Now, for everyone else, I mean we are 
looking at about $1.40 per meal—$1.40 
per meal. I would challenge any of us 
to try and get a meal for $1.40. What 
the United States provides for someone 
who is in need of help right now is $1.40 
per meal, and we have the audacity to 
be asking for that to be raised by a lit-
tle less than $1 a day. That is what a 
15-percent increase in SNAP is. It is a 
little less than $1 a day for somebody. 
Our colleagues act like this is unbe-
lievable—unbelievable that we would 
think people should get 90 cents more a 
day to help with food. That is what we 
are talking about in this package. It is 
about getting people help. It is about 
understanding the hardships that they 
face and knowing it is not over and not 
going to be over for too long. 
Let me just stress, in closing, that 
one of the most efficient ways we can 
address stimulating the economy right 
now is by putting money in the pockets 
of people who have to spend it. One of 
the best ways—in fact, economists tell 
us the best way is giving somebody $1 
that they have to go to the grocery 
store and spend it on food. If you give 
them $1, it translates into $1.70 in the 
economy to the grocery store, the proc-
essor, and the farmer. We need to get 
this done. 
We are also deeply concerned about 
the proposals they put forward on edu-
cation that I will leave for another 
day, but it is time—it is time to recog-
nize what people are going through and 
let them know that somebody cares 
and somebody is going to help them 
and somebody is going to have their 
back. 
I would yield to my friend and col-
league from Ohio who has been such a 
leader. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. I want to thank Senator 
STABENOW and Senator WYDEN. 
I will speak for just 2 or 3 minutes. I 
know that Senator SCHUMER will make 
another unanimous consent request. 
Think about what Senator MCCON-
NELL wants to do. Senator MCCONNELL 
is going to cut $400 in unemployment 
insurance to tens of millions of unem-
ployed workers, hundreds of thousands 
in my State alone—in Oregon, Michi-
gan, Illinois, New York, Minnesota, 
Texas, Florida, and Wisconsin. Thou-
sands of workers are going to lose $400 
a week. 
Think about what is going to happen. 
Around the country, the moratorium 
on evictions is expiring. Around the 
country, in community after commu-
nity, a moratorium on electric and 
water cutoffs is about to happen. So 
workers are going to lose $400 a week. 
They are going to face eviction. 
What is going to happen? 
We know what is going to happen. 
What is going to happen is more people 
will lose their homes, more people will 
be in homeless shelters, more people 
will spend the night in their cousin’s 
basement in the middle of a pandemic. 
It is cruel, and it is really stupid pol-
icy to cut their income for unemploy-
ment for the millions of unemployed 
workers and then provide no dollars for 
rental assistance, no dollars for paying 
their mortgage, and no help for those 
workers. How can we? We are the 
United States of America. How can we 
do such a thing? 
I yield to Senator SCHUMER. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
just two quick things on what Presi-
dent Trump said today. I know my col-
league from Oregon brought it up—the 
idea that, once again, all he wants to 
do is divert from his abject failure on 
the coronavirus crisis. He says: Oh, 
well, maybe we will not have an elec-
tion. 
That is up to the Senate and the 
House, 
Mr. 
President. 
President 
Trump, the election will be in Novem-
ber, on November 3, and you will not 
change it. Stop diverting attention, 
President Trump. That is what you 
have done for 3 months as more people 
get sick, as more people get unem-
ployed, as we see the numbers we saw 
today. 
Instead of focusing on all these crazy, 
egotistical, and wrong-headed ideas, 
focus on COVID–19, focus on testing, 
focus on unemployment, focus on get-
ting the kids back to school, focus on 
the many problems we face and under-
stand the moment and largeness of this 
crisis. I say that to President Trump, 
and I say that to my Republican col-
leagues. 
We are waiting. We are waiting for 
you to get your act together and under-
stand the depth of this crisis, the 
breadth of this crisis, and do something 
real—not a stunt. 
Madam President, as if in legislative 
session, I ask unanimous consent that 
the Senate proceed to the immediate 
consideration of Calendar No. 455, H.R.

July 30, 2020 
6800, the Heroes Act; that the bill be 
considered read a third time and 
passed, and the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table with no intervening action or de-
bate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Wisconsin. 
Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object, I would like 
to first respond to the Senator from 
Oregon about the economic news: yes, 
on an annualized rate from the down-
turn in the second quarter, 9.5 percent. 
But again, I pointed out, respectfully, 
that 
economists 
are 
predicting 
a 
shrinkage of GDP 4.6 and 8 percent be-
cause we are in recovery. 
The employment has dropped by 10.5 
percent. We have already passed $2.9 
trillion. We haven’t spent $1.2 trillion 
of that at least. So we haven’t spent 
$1.2 trillion. Yet our Democratic col-
leagues want to pass a bill that costs $3 
trillion. 
We are already $26.5 trillion in debt 
by the end of this fiscal year. That 
would be approaching $28 trillion. They 
want to pass a bill by unanimous con-
sent for $3 trillion when we haven’t 
spent $1.2 trillion of the $2.9 trillion we 
have already passed. That massive 
amount would represent 27.5 percent of 
our economy, when economists are say-
ing it will shrink by probably no more 
than 7 percent or 8 percent. 
We don’t need to authorize more 
money. What we need to do is help the 
American people who are unemployed. 
I know the minority leader called that 
stingy. The offer we are making—the 
$200 flat payment—does not provide an 
incentive to stay unemployed. It re-
places more than 100 percent of peo-
ple’s wages for 20 percent of the people 
currently unemployed—a 100-percent 
wage replacement for 20 percent. That 
is according to a study by the Univer-
sity of Chicago. 
For the other 80 percent, it replaces 
up to 100 percent. What is stingy about 
that? Why do our Democratic col-
leagues want to propose continuing the 
$600 per-week plus-up that is pre-
venting 
people—incentivizing 
people 
not to reengage in the economy so that 
our economy can recover. It makes no 
sense. 
Again, I will point out that the two- 
thirds option is the exact same amount 
that the House passed—the Demo-
cratic-controlled House passed in phase 
2 of the COVID–19 relief packages for 
paid sick and family leave. So, again, 
we tried to tailor this to protect those 
American workers. We tried to tailor 
this based on what Democrats them-
selves have proposed and passed. Yet 
they would rather play politics. They 
would rather be cynical and object to 
my unanimous consent request because 
time is running out—I acknowledge 
that. 
So we are responding, but as in so 
many other debates—whether it is gun 
control or immigration—it is their way 
or the highway. They simply will not 
take yes for an answer. It is very un-
fortunate they are taking this position 
that they want to indebt our children 
for another $3 trillion, and they will 
not say yes to a very reasonable pro-
posal structured on things they pro-
posed and passed in the past. 
Madam President, It is very unfortu-
nate, but I have to object to $3 trillion 
of additional debt on our children. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The assistant Democratic leader. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President—— 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The as-
sistant Democratic leader has been rec-
ognized. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I be-
lieve there are pending requests by sev-
eral Members, and I don’t want to try 
to preempt it. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would 
the Senator yield the floor? 
Mr. DURBIN. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 4019 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I 
thank the assistant Democratic leader. 
We come back to the floor today, the 
Senator from Minnesota and I, to 
reoffer a unanimous consent request 
that Senator MARKEY, the Senator 
from Massachusetts, and I offered pre-
viously. 
After the death of George Floyd and, 
unfortunately, similar incidents, it has 
become increasingly obvious that our 
country is in need of reconciliation— 
racial reconciliation and personal rec-
onciliation. 
One of the things we could do to 
honor the memory of George Floyd and 
to attempt to take one small step to-
ward that reconciliation is to make 
Juneteenth a Federal holiday. We pre-
viously had offered this unanimous 
consent request, and my friend from 
Wisconsin has his reasons for object-
ing, but one of the major newspapers in 
my State said to me: Try again. So I 
am coming here to the floor to reoffer. 
Juneteenth has been a holiday in 
Texas for 40 years because of the dis-
tinct Texas connection. Just to remind 
my colleagues, Juneteenth was the day 
when the Union Army Major General 
Gordon Ganger showed up in Galveston 
and told people who had previously 
been slaves that they were no longer 
slaves 21⁄2 years after the Emancipation 
Proclamation. 
I believe, in all sincerity, we need to 
remember our history because, you 
know what, we learn from our mis-
takes, and if we don’t remember our 
history, we will not learn from our 
mistakes, and we will commit those 
mistakes over and over and over again. 
The tragic and brutal killing of 
George Floyd earlier this year has 
shown a light on the injustices that 
still exist in our society. Now, for 
somebody who looks like me, my expe-
riences have been much different from 
those of our friend TIM SCOTT, the Sen-
ator from South Carolina, or the expe-
riences of a pastor whom I encountered 
in Houston the other day at a round-
table that Sylvester Turner, the mayor 
of Houston, convened so that they 
could share with me their experiences. 
This pastor, who was head of the 
local NAACP chapter, told me: I honor 
the police. I respect the police. I sup-
port the police. But my son, he is 
afraid of the police. 
So, we clearly have a long way to go 
in treating all people the same, regard-
less of the color of their skin. And 
when the perception among some in 
the minority community is that they 
are being treated differently, that is a 
problem that we should all try to ad-
dress together. 
So one way we could attempt to 
make this small step toward that rec-
onciliation and continue to remind 
ourselves on an annual basis of how far 
we have come but how far we still have 
to go would be to take up this bill, pass 
it, and get it to the President’s desk 
without further delay. 
At this point, before I ask for unani-
mous consent, I would yield to the Sen-
ator from Minnesota. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Minnesota. 
Ms. SMITH. Madam President, I 
thank my colleague from Texas. I ap-
preciate his leadership on this. 
Juneteenth is among the oldest cele-
brations of emancipation and is cer-
tainly worthy of a Federal holiday. I 
want to read an op-ed from the Wash-
ington Post, written by the musician 
Usher, which I think eloquently sums 
up why it is not only important to 
honor this day as a Federal holiday, 
but it is also important to recognize it 
as a part of American history. 
I ask unanimous consent to intro-
duce the Washington Post op-ed in full 
into the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[June 18, 2020] 
USHER: WHY IT’S SO IMPORTANT THAT 
JUNETEENTH BECOME A NATIONAL HOLIDAY 
(By Usher Raymond IV) 
Usher Raymond IV is a musician, actor 
and entrepreneur. 
At the 2015 Essence Music Festival in New 
Orleans, I wore a T-shirt that caught a lot of 
people’s attention. The design was simple. 
The words ‘‘July Fourth’’ were crossed out 
and under them, one word was written: 
‘‘Juneteenth.’’ I wore the shirt because, for 
many years, I celebrated the Fourth of July 
without a true understanding that the date 
of independence for our people, black people, 
is actually June 19, 1865: the day that the 
news of the Emancipation Proclamation fi-
nally reached some of the last people in 
America still held in bondage. 
I have no issue with celebrating America’s 
independence on July 4. For me, wearing the 
shirt was an opportunity to inform others 
who may not necessarily know the history of 
black people in America, and who are not 
aware that Juneteenth is our authentic day 
of self-determination. It is ours to honor the 
legacy of our ancestors, ours to celebrate 
and ours to remember where we once were as 
a people. And it should be a national holiday, 
observed by all Americans. 
Growing up in Chattanooga, Tenn., I was 
taught in school one version of U.S. history

that frequently excluded the history of my 
family and my community. The black his-
tory I learned came from the ‘‘Eyes On the 
Prize’’ documentary that aired during Black 
History Month. That was where I learned 
about Emmett Till, Rosa Parks and the Rev. 
Martin Luther King Jr. When I moved to At-
lanta at age 13, I went deeper and discovered 
more about the movement, the horrors of 
slavery and the resilience of our people. I 
came to understand Juneteenth’s history a 
decade ago during a period of reflection and 
in pursuit of any ancestral history that 
would tell me who I am. 
The liberation Juneteenth commemorates 
is cause for celebration, but it also reminds 
us how equality can be delayed. On June 19, 
1865, on the shores of Galveston, Tex., Union 
Gen. Gordon Granger arrived by boat to an-
nounce to enslaved African Americans that 
the Civil War had ended and they were now 
free. While President Lincoln’s Emanci-
pation Proclamation was issued two and a 
half years prior, and the Civil War had ended 
in April of that year, it wasn’t until June 19, 
1865, that almost all of our ancestors were 
free. We should honor their lives and cele-
brate that day of freedom forever. 
I cherish the words of Nina Simone. I re-
spect the legacy of Harry Belafonte and the 
unapologetic blackness of James Brown. I 
admire the entrepreneurship of Madam C.J. 
Walker. I have learned from my elders. Their 
wisdom has taught me to use my voice to 
support my people, so many of whom are 
hurting right now. Making sure that our his-
tory is told is critical to supporting and sus-
taining our growth as a people. The least we 
deserve is to have this essential moment in-
cluded in the broader American story. 
I am humbled by the platform that has 
been given to me because of my musical tal-
ents, but I know I must do more with it. As 
an artist, it is my duty to reflect the trying 
times in which we live. My heart is shattered 
by the ongoing injustices in this country, in-
cited by its long history of racism that has 
led to deadly outcomes for too many of our 
people. This country must change. 
And it must change quickly. 
Recognizing Juneteenth as a national holi-
day would be a small gesture compared with 
the greater social needs of black people in 
America. But it can remind us of our journey 
toward freedom, and the work America still 
has to do. 
We could observe it, as many black Ameri-
cans already do, by celebrating both our first 
step toward freedom as black people in 
America and also the many contributions to 
this land: the construction of Black Wall 
Street; the invention of jazz, rock n’ roll, 
hip-hop and R&B; and all the entrepreneur-
ship and business brilliance, extraordinary 
cuisine, sports excellence, political power 
and global cultural influence black Ameri-
cans have given the world. 
And rather than observing Juneteenth as 
we do other holidays, by taking it off, we can 
make it a day when black culture, black en-
trepreneurship and black business get our 
support. A national Juneteenth observance 
can affirm that Black Lives Matter! 
What changes do you hope will come out of 
protests and debates about police and race? 
Write to us. 
I proudly join the incredible people and or-
ganizations who have been working on this 
for years, among them the inspiring Opal 
Lee, a 93–year-old from Fort Worth, Tex., 
who has campaigned for the recognition of 
Juneteenth at the state and local level. 
There has never been a more urgent time 
than now to get this done. On Thursday, 
Sens. Tina Smith (D–Minn.), Edward J. Mar-
key (D–Mass.), Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D– 
Calif.) and Cory Booker (D–N.J.) announced 
that they are introducing legislation to 
make Juneteenth a federal holiday. Congress 
must pass this bill immediately. 
As we celebrate today, let’s stay open to 
possibility. Let’s support black-owned busi-
nesses today and every day. Let’s uplift our 
resilient history. Let’s honor our people. 
Happy Juneteenth, America. 
Ms. SMITH. Usher wrote:

So thank you to my colleague from 
Texas. I am glad to stand with him in 
making Juneteenth a Federal holiday. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
YOUNG). The Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as in 
legislative session, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Judiciary Committee 
be discharged from further consider-
ation and the Senate now proceed to S. 
4019; further, that the bill be consid-
ered read a third time and passed; and 
that the motion to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Wisconsin. 
Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, reserv-
ing the right to object, let me first 
state and make perfectly clear that I 
think the emancipation of slaves is a 
day worth celebrating. I have no argu-
ment whatsoever with the fact that we 
should probably celebrate it better 
than we have in the past. But there are 
other ways of celebrating it—a resolu-
tion in the Senate creating a national 
day of celebration without declaring it 
a national holiday. 
The effect of declaring it a national 
holiday is primarily one thing: It gives 
Federal workers a paid day off. Now, 
Federal workers are compensated quite 
well, and I want to quickly go through 
this again, as we did last week. I have 
some charts up here. 
If you take a look at just their wage, 
Federal workers, on average, make 
about a little over $94,000 per year. In 
the private sector, the average wage is 
$63,000, which is 67 percent of what Fed-
eral workers make. If you also include 
benefits—total compensation—Federal 
workers 
make, 
on 
average, 
about 
$135,000, almost $136,000 per year. In the 
private sector, it is about $75,000, which 
is 55 percent of what Federal workers 
make. 
So if you strip out only the benefits, 
which is what we are talking about 
with holiday pay and paid family leave 
and other things, Federal workers, on 
average, get compensated about $41,000 
annually, versus the private sector’s 
$12,000, which is only 29 percent of what 
Federal workers make. 
What we are talking about is a paid 
day off. Now, take a look at what Fed-
eral workers get in terms of the num-
ber of days off with pay. It is quite gen-
erous, particularly after last year’s Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act, in 
which we added paid parental leave. 
I have two charts here. Here is one: If 
a Federal worker gets paid parental 
leave—and I realize that only happens 
a few times during somebody’s life-
time—but Federal workers get 10 paid 
holidays. That is probably the max 
anybody gets in the private sector. In 
terms of paid leave, minimum, they get 
13 days off; maximum, they get 26; and 
by the way, 26 is more than 5 weeks off 
with 
pay—basically 
paid 
vacation. 
They get 4 weeks after only 3 years. 
That is virtually unheard of in the pri-
vate sector—very generous paid vaca-
tion in the Federal workforce. Then, 
with paid parental leave, they get 60 
days off maximum. 
So, a Federal worker taking advan-
tage of paid parental leave will get 96 
to 109 days off or, put a different way, 
for every 1.4 days a Federal worker 
works, they get a day off. 
Now, let’s strip out paid parental 
leave. Let’s look at people who aren’t 
having a child or adopting a child— 
again, same basic numbers: 10 paid 
holidays, 13 to 26 paid leave days, 13 
sick days, for a total of anywhere from 
36 to 49 days of leave that is paid. For 
a more senior worker, for every 4.3 
days they work, they get a day off, 
which is basically a 4-day workweek. 
By the way, if they don’t take the paid 
leave days, they can carry them over. 
So, again, the private sector benefits 
aren’t even close to this generous. I am 
not 
objecting 
to 
celebrating 
Juneteenth. What I am objecting to is 
the rest of America paying for another 
paid day off for Federal workers. By 
the way, it costs about $600 million per 
year. The CBO score is over 10 years; 
that is $6 billion. The sponsors of this 
bill want to just go ahead and incur 
that additional cost on the American 
economy 
and 
American 
taxpayers 
without a vote. They can’t do it just by 
unanimous consent, which is really 
what I am objecting to in this process 
here. 
So, again, I have a different proposal. 
We could either declare it a national 
day of celebration. That would be fine. 
Or we can go ahead and declare it and 
make it a national holiday, but if we 
are going to do that, let’s just take one 
of their paid days away. They come out 
whole. 
Last week, I was accused of taking 
something away from Federal workers. 
Not really—I am still leaving them

with the same 36 to 49 or 96 to 109 days 
off. I am just saying that it strikes me 
as kind of strange that the only way we 
can properly celebrate Juneteenth is 
by giving Federal workers a paid day 
off, paid by every other American tax-
payer, to the tune of $600 million a 
year. 
So, again, what I would recommend 
is 
that 
modification: 
Declare 
Juneteenth a national paid holiday but 
remove one of their paid sick leaves. 
So I ask the Senator to modify his re-
quest to include my amendment at the 
desk; that the amendment be consid-
ered and agreed to; that the bill, as 
amended, be considered and read a 
third time and passed; and that the 
motions to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the 
Senator so modify his proposal? 
The Senator from Minnesota. 
Ms. SMITH. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, it is notable to me 
that we are gathered here today, while 
in Atlanta we are celebrating the life 
of JOHN LEWIS. In this moment, I think 
it is worth remembering that when 
Congress was debating whether to 
make a Federal holiday honoring Mar-
tin Luther King, Jr.—Dr. King, in the 
1980s—people made this same kind of 
argument about its potential cost. 
Ronald Reagan made this argument. 
But President Reagan came around, 
and he signed into law this bill, and 
now that holiday is celebrated nation-
wide as a day of reflection and rededi-
cation to progress toward racial jus-
tice. Just as the civil rights movement 
is honored as an important milestone 
in the history of this country, so 
should be emancipation. 
Just as the argument that it is too 
expensive to give Federal employees a 
day off was wrong regarding Martin 
Luther King Day, it is wrong for 
Juneteenth. And just as Ronald Reagan 
got on the right side of history, I think 
that we will get on the right side of 
history, and we will finally have a full 
holiday to commemorate Juneteenth, 
not as a holiday with an asterisk, not 
as a half holiday, but as a full holiday; 
therefore, I object to this modification. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Is there objection to the original re-
quest? 
The Senator from Wisconsin. 
Mr. JOHNSON. I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
HEALS ACT 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if you 
want to know what is wrong with 
Washington, take a snapshot of this 
day. Take a snapshot of where we stand 
at this moment. 
In the midst of the worst health cri-
sis in American history in 100 years 
and in the midst of the worst economic 
setback in 75 years, we have reached 
the point in the U.S. Senate where we 
are going to adjourn until next week, 
leaving in doubt whether 30 million un-
employed Americans will continue to 
receive support from the Federal Gov-
ernment. How have we reached this 
point? 
Well, in anticipation of this moment, 
10 weeks ago, the House of Representa-
tives passed a rescue package that not 
only addressed unemployment benefits 
but a score of other major concerns we 
have at this moment in our history and 
at this moment in our economy—10 
weeks ago. 
Since then, the burden has been on 
the Republican leader in the U.S. Sen-
ate, Senator MCCONNELL, of Kentucky, 
to pick up the challenge and to produce 
his own approach, whatever it may be, 
representing his caucus—the Repub-
lican caucus—on what to do with the 
economy and what to do with the pan-
demic. We stand today, preparing to 
leave for 3 or 4 days, with nothing— 
nothing. 
The situation is so bad that an indi-
vidual Republican Senator decided to 
come to the floor and see if he could fix 
it. I disagree with his approach com-
pletely, but I respect the fact that he is 
as frustrated as we all are waiting on 
Senator MCCONNELL to come forward. 
Here is the reality of what we face 
and the reality that Senator MCCON-
NELL should face. Any solution coming 
out of the Senate needs to be bipar-
tisan. Democrats and Republicans need 
to agree, and we did on March 26. The 
vote was 96 to nothing for the CARES 
Act—96 to nothing. I went home to Illi-
nois and people would come up to me 
and say: I can’t believe you did that. I 
didn’t think you agreed on anything in 
Washington, but you all agreed on one 
thing, the most significant economic 
rescue package in the history of the 
United States. 
Well, we were challenged to do it 
again, and we have failed miserably in 
the Senate. Under the current leader-
ship with a Republican majority, they 
cannot produce a bill to bring to con-
ference or at least to a conference 
table between the House and the Sen-
ate. 
I would like to address directly some 
of the arguments being made. Here is 
one that you have heard over and over. 
I think it is an urban legend, and I 
want to say a word about it. Here is 
how it goes: $600 a week? At $600 a 
week, at that level, individuals will not 
even take a job. They will sit home on 
the couch and watch another round of 
Netflix, binging, and they will not even 
want to go back to work. How many 
times have you heard that $600 is just 
too much money? I can tell you that 
$600 is the equivalent of $15 an hour, 
which many of us believe is at least a 
minimum living wage. It is certainly 
not a luxury salary for anyone. If you 
have lost your job, that $600 Federal 
check, together with whatever the 
State sends your way, has to pay for a 
lot of things: rent, mortgage, car pay-
ments, utilities—did I mention health 
insurance?—food, clothing for the kids, 
the debts you have already incurred 
leading into this, and your credit 
cards. All of a sudden, $600 a week 
tends to evaporate. 
What if you had health insurance 
where you worked, and they laid you 
off or fired you and said it was over, 
that they are closing down? If you 
tried to pick up the employer’s share of 
your health insurance, the average cost 
is $1,700 a month. So $600 a week, $2,400 
a month, and $1,700 of it is just going to 
keep the health insurance you had on 
the job? 
Then there is this abiding notion 
that people who are unemployed just 
aren’t trying hard enough to get a job. 
They say: You know, the jobs are out 
there, and these folks are just saying: I 
would rather not. 
Let’s take a look at the facts, and 
here are the facts. For every job that is 
available in America today, there are 
four unemployed people. So it isn’t as 
if it is the other way around, one job 
for every four unemployed people. It is 
four unemployed people for each job 
that is available. 
And to the argument by some em-
ployers that, well, I just can’t get them 
to come back to work, it turns out that 
employers are filling jobs faster now 
than at any time. There are people pre-
pared to go back to work. I happen to 
believe that many of these people see 
returning to work as the right thing to 
do for them economically. Unemploy-
ment cannot last forever; they know 
that. Secondly, it may not be meeting 
their needs, as their family requires of 
them. Third, the job itself may be 
something they had invested part of 
their life into and want to continue. 
Fourth, there may be benefits in that 
workplace that aren’t available, even 
through the unemployment system 
available today. So I reject the no-
tion—this urban legend—that $600 a 
week is so much that people are turn-
ing down the opportunity to go back to 
work. It is not an urban legend; it is an 
urban lie. 
Yale University just came out with a 
report from their economics depart-
ment this week. I put it into the 
RECORD yesterday. You can find it, if 
you wish. It proves the point I just 
made. They looked at the statistics. 
This is just not a viable complaint 
against the unemployment system. 
What Senator MCCONNELL has led us 
to is this moment, where, when we re-
turn next week, there will be no Fed-
eral unemployment benefit—none. It 
will have expired. What do we say to 
these millions of family members who 
are struggling at this moment? Try 
harder. Go take anything. That is what 
the future is for you. 
I don’t believe that. I think we are a 
better nation than that. 
Facing the worst public health crisis 
that we have seen in a century, real-
izing what it has done to each and 
every one of our lives and families, un-
derstanding how devastating it must be 
to lose a job in the midst of this, that 
sometimes people for the first time 
aren’t working, realizing how desperate

these families are to keep things to-
gether, are we really going to walk 
away from them? I think it is time for 
Senator MCCONNELL to sit down with 
the Democratic leaders. There is no al-
ternative to this. 
Steve Mnuchin, the wandering mes-
senger on Capitol Hill, can do his job— 
and I wish him well—but it is no re-
placement for grown-ups to sit at the 
same table, to sit down and work out a 
compromise. We did on March 26. We 
can do it again. We need to do it for 
these families. 
I will tell you something else. When 
we get reports about the state of the 
economy—and I have heard numbers 
back and forth—that on an annualized 
basis it is contracting from 29 percent 
to 33 percent, that is a big amount. It 
is one out of three businesses. A third 
of the goods and services in this coun-
try—think about that—going away and 
disappearing. We have already seen evi-
dence of that. 
What do you do to put life back into 
an economy? Don’t take my word for 
it. Listen to the Chairman of the Fed-
eral Reserve, Jerome Powell. He said it 
again yesterday: We have to deal with 
this pandemic; that means more test-
ing. 
The Republican proposal that is 
floating here and has not been offered, 
is $26 billion more in testing. We are at 
$100 billion. I think we need at least 
$100 billion. Why do we need it? So it is 
generally available, easily available to 
every person and family in America; so 
that it is affordable—and I hope that 
means free—and, most importantly, so 
that it is timely. 
To people who say, well, I took a 
test, I ask: How long did it take to get 
the results on your COVID–19 test? 
They say: Oh, 6 days, 7 days. That is 
not a timely test that you can use to 
make a plan. It is a piece of medical 
data. It is a piece of history. If we are 
going to hope to open this economy in 
a responsible way, to get to contact 
tracing that really works, if we hope to 
open our schools so they are safe for 
the kids and the teachers and the ad-
ministrators and everyone else, we 
need testing available, and we need a 
system of testing that is timely. 
We have failed in addressing this pan-
demic. Why do I say that? It sounds 
like an outrageous political statement. 
Because the United States has 5 per-
cent of the population in the world and 
25 percent of the COVID infections. 
Twenty-five percent of the COVID in-
fections in the world are in this coun-
try and 5 percent of the population. 
Other countries have handled this bet-
ter. We know it. We should learn from 
them. 
This President has to get away from 
the medical quackery which he spreads 
around on his Twitter account and in 
his speeches. He has to stop looking at 
these medical gurus, which he dis-
covers in the weird corners of the 
internet, and peddling their goods for 
the rest of America. He has to show 
some guts and wear a mask more often 
so people understand that even Trump 
Republicans need to take into consider-
ation what they are doing to the people 
around them. That, to me, is the only 
way to get out of this mess and do it 
quickly. Otherwise, we are going to 
face this more. 
We should have done better. By this 
time, we should have had an alter-
native to what the House did 10 weeks 
ago. We do not. By next week, we have 
to do it. 
I will just say flat out that there is 
no point in considering going home at 
the end of next week unless we have 
solved this problem. There is no ex-
cuse. 
I yield the floor.

NEW MARKETS FOR STATE-INSPECTED MEAT AND 
POULTRY ACT 
Mr. ROUNDS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to urge the Senate to include the 
New Markets for State-Inspected Meat 
and Poultry Act in a COVID–19 re-
sponse legislation that we are consid-
ering during this work period. 
This is legislation I have worked on 
with my colleague Senator ANGUS KING 
of Maine for several years, long before 
COVID–19 disrupted the safety and se-
curity of the American food supply. It 
has bipartisan support. 
COVID–19 revealed the cracks in mul-
tiple industries—our food supply, phar-
maceuticals, defense, and manufac-
turing in general. Every American pays 
the price for foreign reliance—every 
American. This is a moment in history 
when we can rebuild what ‘‘American 
made’’ 
and 
what 
‘‘made 
America 
great’’ really means in the first place. 
That, of course, is American produc-
tion and innovation across all indus-
tries. 
As consumers of food—and that is ev-
erybody, 
Republican 
and 
Democrat 
alike, 
Independents 
included—we 
should demand that we have this pro-
duction capacity in the United States. 
Heavy reliance on foreign production 
and manufacturing is a mistake, and 
America needs to see a renaissance of 
American production and ingenuity. 
Just as an example, on July 29 of this 
year, it was announced that JBS, a 
Brazilian-owned company, intends to 
acquire the Mountain States Rosen 
lamb plant in Greeley, CO. It has been 
reported that JBS will grind ham-
burger and cut steaks, which, unfortu-
nately, will eliminate the ability of 
this plant to process nearly 350,000 
lambs within the United States. This is 
yet another example of a foreign com-
pany working to consolidate and to in-
tegrate the American food supply sys-
tem to the detriment of U.S. ag pro-
ducers. We just simply can’t sit here 
and watch this occur on our watch. We 
are already paying the price of foreign 
ownership in our food supply system 
today. 
The time is now to aggressively pur-
sue American options for production 
and processing in order to protect 
American consumers and our entire 
economy. 
Right now, we are actually giving an 
unfair and unnecessary advantage to 
the large, sometimes foreign-owned, 
meat processing facilities. 
These large facilities typically pur-
sue licensing through the USDA Fed-
eral meat inspection process, which 
gives them a certification allowing 
them to sell across all State lines. 
However, smaller processors that are 
trying to inject competition into a 
market which is dominated by pri-
marily big players, typically pursue 
State-inspected certifications, which, 
unfortunately, today, do not allow 
them to sell meat across State lines. 
The irony is that the State processors 
that are out there also need to be fed-
erally approved to meet or exceed 
these Federal inspection standards. So 
our 
smaller 
meat 
processors 
are 
achieving a certification of equal or 
higher standards but are given a li-
cense with less ability to market their 
product. They have to stay within the 
boundaries of the State in which they 
are produced. 
In my hometown of Fort Pierre, SD, 
a beef processing company was an-
nounced to be opening in May of this 
year, 2020. This is the kind of American 
production we want to see more of. But 
if this processor chooses to pursue a 
State-inspected meat license instead of 
a USDA license, they will not be able 
to sell across State lines, even though 
South Dakota’s meat poultry inspec-
tion program has standards that meet 
or exceed Federal inspection standards. 
This is unacceptable and is harming 
our small American processors’ ability 
to compete fairly. 
This is why we should include the 
New Markets for State-Inspected Meat 
and Poultry Act in our next COVID–19 
relief legislation. 
In recent months, partially due to 
the toll the COVID–19 pandemic has 
had on our meat processing facilities, 
we have seen renewed support for this 
particular effort. In the Senate, we now 
have 12 cosponsors from both sides of 
the aisle. Additionally, there was com-
panion legislation which was intro-
duced in the House of Representatives 
by Representative LIZ CHENEY of Wyo-
ming. 
I would like to explain what our leg-
islation does and why it is so impor-
tant to include it as part of the Federal 
Government’s response to COVID–19. 
The New Markets for State-Inspected 
Meat and Poultry Act would allow 
meat that has been inspected by a fed-
erally approved State meat and poultry 
inspection program to be sold across 
State lines. 
Currently, cattle, sheep, and swine 
that are raised in South Dakota by 
some of the best producers in the world 
and inspected at a South Dakota proc-
essing facility are limited to markets 
within the State. Yet they meet or ex-
ceed Federal inspection standards. It 
just doesn’t make sense, especially 
when there is high demand for locally 
sourced and processed proteins in a

State-approved facility, which, by Fed-
eral law has standards that meet or ex-
ceed Federal inspection standards. 
Our legislation would allow these 
products, which pass State inspection 
standards, to be sold across State lines, 
opening up new markets for producers 
and giving consumers greater choice at 
the grocery store. At a time when our 
food supply is in danger, this is a very 
easy first step. 
Like so many sectors of our econ-
omy, the food production industry was 
ill-prepared 
for 
the 
unprecedented 
changes that needed to be made when 
the COVID–19 pandemic hit. Labor 
shortages and worker protection meas-
ures slowed down plants around the 
country, and outbreaks even caused 
some of the facilities to shut down en-
tirely. 
We saw this happen in my home 
State of South Dakota, where our 
Sioux Falls Smithfield plant processes 
20,000 hogs a day and employs approxi-
mately 35 hard-working individuals. At 
the peak of the crisis, hog processing 
dropped approximately 40 percent in 
May, and beef production dropped ap-
proximately 35 percent in May, when 
compared to 2019 production levels 
across the United States. At one point, 
there was a backlog of nearly 1 million 
cattle ready to be processed. 
Meanwhile, grocery stores across the 
country began to see meat shortages 
on 
their 
shelves 
because 
of 
the 
chokepoint found in the concentration 
of beef processing at the big four pack-
ers, where processing capacity had 
been curtailed. Livestock producers 
were faced with one of the worst sce-
narios 
they 
could 
face—having 
to 
euthanize their animals because they 
weren’t able to get them into a proc-
essing facility. While we have been able 
to recover some of the production ca-
pacity since that time, it is far from 
being back to normal, and we are still 
unprepared to deal with the continuing 
pandemic. 
While we work to get meat and pork 
processing facilities back up and run-
ning at capacity, we should also be uti-
lizing State-based solutions to help off-
set the backlog and help provide addi-
tional capacity. Specifically, we should 
include the New Markets for State-In-
spected Meat and Poultry Act in the 
next relief package. 
Currently, 27 States operate State 
meat inspection programs. Meat and 
poultry inspected at these facilities are 
already sold for public consumption in 
the States where they are licensed. 
Today, if you have meat or poultry 
processed at a South Dakota inspection 
facility in Hudson, SD, you wouldn’t be 
able to sell it across the border just a 
few miles away in Iowa, but you could 
sell it a couple hundred miles away in 
Lemmon, SD. 
It really doesn’t make much sense, 
especially since State meat and poul-
try inspection facilities are required by 
law to be at least equal to federally in-
spected processing facilities with re-
gard to their food safety standards. 
These products are safe for consump-
tion and should be allowed to be sold 
nationwide. This will help offset the 
pressure on federally inspected facili-
ties during the ongoing pandemic and 
in the future as well. 
This is a commonsense solution that 
has bipartisan, bicameral support. It is 
time to end this arbitrary regulation 
restricting the sale of these products to 
within State lines and allow facilities 
inspected by State meat inspection 
programs to increase production and 
sell their product nationwide. 
Including the New Markets for State- 
Inspected Meat and Poultry Act in fu-
ture COVID–19 relief legislation is good 
for producers and very good for con-
sumers.

The majority leader. 
HEALS ACT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, on 
Monday, the Republicans introduced a 
trillion-dollar proposal to give Amer-
ican families more coronavirus relief. 
Most urgently, the Republicans want 
to continue a Federal supplement to 
State unemployment insurance, which 
is set to expire, as we all know, tomor-
row. 
If our Democratic colleagues had 
acted with the urgency that struggling 
people deserve, we could right now be 
finishing up a major bipartisan pack-
age for kids, jobs, and healthcare. If 
our Democratic colleagues had acted 
with urgency, unemployed Americans 
wouldn’t be facing a total elimination 
of this extra help. 
Instead, jobless Americans are star-
ing down this cliff because Speaker 
PELOSI and the Democratic leader have 
refused to negotiate. They have refused 
to move 1 inch from the Speaker’s far- 
left proposal that is so absurd and so 
unserious that their own moderate 
Democratic Members began trashing it 
the instant it came out. This is the 
multitrillion-dollar 
boondoggle 
that 
would tax and borrow in order to pro-
vide a massive tax cut to the rich peo-
ple in blue States—the SALT give-
away; that would fund diversity studies 
of the legal pot industry; and that 
would do 1,000 other things with no re-
lationship whatsoever to the crisis. 
Just a few minutes ago, our colleague 
from Wisconsin tried to get consent to 
continue the unemployment assistance 
to prevent it from expiring tomorrow, 
and the Democratic leader objected un-
less he got to pass the entirety of the 
massive wish list. The Republicans 
want to continue this aid before it ex-
pires, but the Democratic leader says: 
Let them eat SALT. 
This is what was written about their 
proposal: ‘‘Privately, several House 
Democrats concede [the bill] feels like

July 30, 2020 
little more than an effort to appease 
the most liberal members of the cau-
cus.’’ 
Yet, now, Speaker PELOSI and the 
Democratic leader have declared that 
unemployed Americans will not get an-
other cent—not another cent—unless 
the Senate agrees to pass the entire 
bill that even the Democrats say is ri-
diculous. This is their position: Unem-
ployed people, schools, hospitals, and 
American families will not see another 
dime unless they get to cut taxes for 
millionaires in Brooklyn and San Fran-
cisco. That is what this is about. 
Sure, they will call the Republicans 
names for wanting to make sure the 
system doesn’t pay people more not to 
work, but the Democratic leader gave 
away the game this morning. He said 
on the floor that he now opposes even 
continuing the aid at the $600 level. 
They want jobless aid to expire tomor-
row—period. Lest we forget, just a few 
days ago, multiple Democratic Sen-
ators and the Democratic House major-
ity leader were all saying they were 
prepared to negotiate and land some-
where south of $600. Multiple Demo-
crats said they were open to continuing 
the aid at a level that didn’t pay people 
more to stay home. 
Now the Democratic leader hasn’t 
just contradicted his colleagues and re-
fused to talk, he has gone even further 
and declared he will not even let the 
aid continue at $600. The Democratic 
leader has tried to rule out every op-
tion except that of leaving the Capitol 
today and beginning his weekend with 
this unemployment benefit set to ex-
pire. 
These aren’t the actions, my friends, 
that would lead to any agreement. 
They aren’t the actions that will actu-
ally make a law. 
I am not sure whether my Demo-
cratic colleagues really agree that 
hurting unemployed people is their 
side’s best political strategy, but if 
that is their position, they will have to 
vote on it with the entire country to 
see. 
In just a moment, I am going to 
make the Senate vote on a privileged 
motion that will be a motion to pro-
ceed to legislation which would be used 
to prevent the unemployment aid from 
expiring. 
We have a number of views on both 
sides of the best way to accomplish 
that. The bill would be amendable. No-
body who actually wants to negotiate, 
nobody who actually wants a bipar-
tisan outcome would be disadvantaged 
by merely proceeding to the debate. 
We have had enough rope-a-dope. We 
have had enough empty talk. It is time 
to go on the record. We will see who 
really wants a bipartisan outcome for 
the country and who is trying their 
hardest to block one. 
f 
LEGISLATIVE SESSION 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
move to proceed to legislative session. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
to be recognized to respond to the lead-
er. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Well, we have had a 
lot of words from the leader—none of 
them talk about reality. One picture 
equals all his words: SCHUMER, PELOSI, 
Mnuchin, Meadows in a room negoti-
ating, where the Republican leader 
can’t even show up because his caucus 
is so divided. In his own words, 20 of his 
Members don’t want to vote for any-
thing. 
Now, faced with a crisis they cre-
ated—for 10 weeks we have asked the 
leader to negotiate, and now, finally, 
they have woken up to the fact that we 
are at a cliff. But it is too late—too 
late because even if we were to pass 
this measure, all the States—almost 
every State says people would not get 
their unemployment for weeks and 
months, all because of the disunity, 
dysfunction of this Republican caucus 
and of the leader, afraid to negotiate 
because he doesn’t have his people be-
hind him. 
The bottom line is very simple: This 
new proposal moves things even back-
ward. Instead of a 30-percent cut from 
what people are getting, it is a 33-per-
cent cut. And we all know that the pro-
posal that is in existence now has kept 
millions out of poverty. 
Now we hear talk from the other side 
that this creates the deficit—this in-
creases the deficit. We can’t spend 
money. Well, I would remind them of 
the $1.5 trillion tax cut for the rich— 
tax cut for the rich. No one even 
thought about the deficit then. But 
when it comes to average folks, work-
ing people, we don’t hear a thing. 
Unemployment is a crisis. There are 
many crises. All your constituents, the 
parents, are saying: Why can’t we open 
our schools safely? They need dollars. 
We can’t negotiate that proposal. 
People are being thrown out of their 
homes. That is a cliff that happened 
Thursday. Nothing for that. 
The bottom line is very simple: This 
is the worst health crisis in 100 years. 
This is the worst economic crisis in 75 
years. Unfortunately, at this great mo-
ment of terrible trouble in our country, 
our Republican friends are paralyzed, 
and when they want to do something, 
it is a stunt, not a real negotiation, 
that they know won’t pass, because 
their backs are against the wall and 
the American people—just look at the 
data—know who is to blame and know 
who doesn’t want to help people. 
So the bottom line is very simple: We 
Democrats know what the problem is, 
and we are unified. We have a very 
strong proposal. And to look at the 
things in that proposal with the cal-
lousness that my friend the Republican 
leader has done; to say that this is all 
politics when people are being thrown 
out of their homes and we want to give 
them shelter; when people are not able 
to feed their children and we want to 
give them food; when small busi-
nesses—men and women who have 
struggled—can’t keep their businesses 
going, we hear nothing. 
Our proposal—the one to which the 
Republicans objected—deals with these 
problems in a serious, significant, and, 
yes, expensive way. But we know what 
is going on on the other side of the 
aisle. It was said by my friend from In-
diana: Let the private sector do it. 
Well, my friends, this is a moment 
where the private sector can’t solve the 
problem. This is a moment when we do 
need strong, active, and bold relief— 
something that this caucus has been 
running away from, ignoring, for far 
too long. 
My fellow Americans, we are in an 
enormous crisis. We are stepping up to 
the plate on this side of the aisle. 
Please let your Senators know on the 
Republican side of the aisle how deep 
this crisis is, how painful it is for peo-
ple, and to step up to the plate, get in 
the room, and negotiate a real deal and 
stop doing stunts that simply are polit-
ical—get it off my back—that you 
know cannot pass. 
I yield the floor.

amount based on an individual’s average

equal to the individual’s average weekly

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arizona. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST 
Ms. MCSALLY. Mr. President, I de-
ployed to Washington to be a prag-
matic problem-solver, and for the past 
51⁄2 years I have made it my mission in 
Congress to better the lives of hard- 
working Arizonans. In a time of toxic 
partisanship, this is no easy feat. It re-
quires me to go across the aisle to find 
where the Venn diagram overlaps. 
Well, today I am calling on my Sen-
ate colleagues to be pragmatic, to meet 
in the middle on what we should agree 
on. I am asking Senators to simply ex-
tend expanded unemployment benefits 
for 7 days while Congress comes up 
with a solution. Who could be against 
that? 
With the 1st of August approaching, 
Americans out of work are counting on 
us for cash so they can pay their rent 
and put food on the table for their fam-
ilies. While some States will get the 
expanded checks, we understand, for 
the next week or two, Arizonans have 
gotten 
their 
last 
expanded 
check. 
These Arizonans are in my neighbor-
hood, live on my street, and worked 
paycheck to paycheck before this once- 
in-a-century pandemic hit. 
Well, I am here to tell them that 
Washington, 
DC’s 
dysfunction 
and 
bickering is alive and well. Congress, 
once again, is using hard-working 
Americans as pawns in their political 
games. 
For the many Arizonans out of work 
right now, this is not a game. Ameri-
cans, Arizonans are calling out for 
help, and it is time we deliver it. 
What I am offering today is a simple 
7-day extension of the extra $600 a 
week for unemployed Americans while 
we work through our differences on 
how to move forward and see Ameri-
cans through this first-in-a-century 
crisis. This is a reasonable proposal. 
Who could possibly be against this? 
I understand, as we work to defeat 
this virus—which we will—and support 
the economic recovery for our country, 
we need to incentivize people to return 
to work safely, when they are able. 
And there are disagreements in this

July 30, 2020 
Chamber on what that looks like, what 
the ultimate dollar figure or percent-
age will be, where we land and for how 
long. 
I know today Congress needs to do 
their job and to prevent this des-
perately needed, extra lifeline from 
fully expiring. In this uncertain time, 
everyone is doing the best they can to 
make ends meet, to help each other, to 
help our neighbors, to stay safe—every-
one, that is, except Congress. 
Americans who have lost their liveli-
hoods through no fault of their own due 
to this cruel virus should not be the 
collateral damage of political maneu-
vering. I am calling on the Senate: 
Let’s do what we were sent here to do. 
Let’s do our job. 
In the face of the virus, we have 
asked millions of Americans to go back 
to work when they can safely, to make 
hard decisions, to do what they were 
hired to do. It is time for the Senate to 
do the same. 
This is a reasonable request. It is 
simply a 7-day extension of the ex-
panded unemployment benefits while 
we continue to work out our dif-
ferences. Who could possibly be against 
this? 
Therefore, I ask unanimous consent 
that the Senate proceed to the imme-
diate consideration of my bill at the 
desk. I further ask that the bill be con-
sidered read a third time and passed 
and that the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. SCHUMER. Reserving the right 
to object. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this 
UC request is clearly a stunt. A 1-week 
fix can’t be implemented in time, and 
the Senator knows that. Plus, there are 
many other problems Arizonans have 
in addition to this one. 
Arizonan parents are worried that 
schools will not open safely. Arizona 
renters are worried they will be evicted 
from their apartments. Arizona parents 
are worried that they can’t feed their 
kids. Arizona small businesses are wor-
ried that they will not have the nec-
essary help. 
All of those things are in the Heroes 
Act, plus not even a 1-week extension— 
which can’t even be implemented—but 
an extension until January 31. 
So I would ask my colleague to tell 
Arizonans whether she supports the He-
roes Act or not, which goes much fur-
ther and is much stronger on unem-
ployment and many other issues. 
I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Arizona. 
Ms. MCSALLY. Mr. President, this is 
disappointing and a political stunt and 
a game. For all the normal people 
watching out there who don’t under-
stand why Washington is so dysfunc-
tional, we are just looking for a 7-day 
extension so they can get another 
check and pay their rent. 
I asked the question: Who could pos-
sibly be against this? 
Well, we found out. It is the Senator 
from New York. So you can clip the 
tape or put his picture on your refrig-
erator when you open it up because it 
is the minority leader who is against 
this, on his path to try and become the 
majority leader. And that is unfortu-
nate. Arizonans deserve better. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 6800 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am 
going to ask once again that our Re-
publican colleagues support the Heroes 
Act. 
This is a dramatic crisis affecting all 
of America in many different ways. We 
Democrats have come up with a bold, 
strong plan supported by the vast ma-
jority of people—average, middle-class 
people. Our proposal deals with the 
issue of unemployment all the way 
through January 31—not a 1-week 
stunt which can’t even be adapted in 
time. 
Our proposal deals with schools and 
their ability to open. Our proposal 
deals with small businesses. Our pro-
posal deals with so many of the issues 
facing America. 
Our colleagues on the other side, we 
know, are tied in a knot. Our col-
leagues on the other side can’t come to 
an agreement on anything. They did an 
empty shell bill because the only thing 
they could support was an empty shell 
bill with nothing inside of it. 
Well, that is not what the American 
people want. They want action. I would 
urge the Republican leader to start ne-
gotiating in good faith and in serious-
ness. I would urge the President to do 
things about testing and tracing, also 
in the Heroes bill. 
I would urge that we rise to the occa-
sion of this enormous crisis. We Demo-
crats are doing that in a bold and 
strong way. We haven’t heard anything 
from our Republican colleagues. 
I ask unanimous consent that the 
Senate proceed to the immediate con-
sideration of calendar No. 455, H.R. 
6800, the Heroes Act; that the bill be 
considered read a third time and passed 
and the motion to reconsider be consid-
ered made and laid upon the table with 
no intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Ohio. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, we 
have already had this debate once 
today when the Democratic leader 
chose to offer this motion knowing 
that, of course, it is not serious. What 
he is talking about here, just after hav-
ing rejected a very commonsense pro-
posal, which is a 1-week extension for 
the unemployment insurance—by the 
way, at $600, which is exactly what the 
Democrats say they want. They want 
to keep it at $600 even though, as we 
know from numerous studies, that 
means that, for many people—in fact, 
for 68 percent of the people on unem-
ployment insurance, based on the Uni-
versity of Chicago study—they are 
making more on unemployment insur-
ance than they can make at work. 
I think all of us here in this Chamber 
want to be sure that folks are taken 
care of. In fact, we just voted on legis-
lation to provide the ability to be able 
to debate this very issue and other 
issues. But to say that people should be 
making substantially more for not 
working rather than working is some-
thing I think even a lot of my Demo-
cratic colleagues do not find accept-
able. 
Instead, the minority leader, once 
again, is offering the Heroes Act, as he 
has done before. You will recall this is 
the House-passed legislation that was 
passed, actually, a while ago during 
different times. But it is $3.5 trillion. 
That is what the CBO says—$3.5 tril-
lion. 
That makes it, of course, the most 
expensive piece of legislation ever 
passed by either body anytime in our 
history, by far. By the way, it has a 
number of provisions that have nothing 
to do with COVID–19. 
So here we are in the middle of this 
crisis. In many places it is getting 
worse, not better. We do need to act, 
but we need to be sure we are acting in 
an effective, targeted way and not put-
ting things out there—a $3.5 trillion 
bill including many things that have 
nothing to do with COVID–19. 
It has immigration policy changes 
there. We can debate those separately. 
Immigration policy issues are very 
contentious and are tough things for us 
to resolve in any context, but certainly 
we shouldn’t put it in a COVID–19 bill. 
It has unprecedented mandates on 
the States that say to the States: You 
have to do the elections the way Con-
gress wants to do them. You have to do 
mail-in ballots the way we are saying 
you have to do them. You have to use 
the kinds of ideas that we say you have 
to use. 
This has always been in the province 
of the States. Again, a lot of my Demo-
cratic colleagues agree it should con-
tinue to be in the province of the 
States to make those kinds of detailed 
decisions on elections. 
It doubles the amount of money in 
the Heroes Act that goes to States as 
compared to even what the National 
Governors Association is asking for. 
Three and a half trillion dollars begins 
to add up when you do things like that. 
You give twice as much to the States 
as the States are even asking for. 
Of course, one of my favorites—and I 
know, again, the Senator from New 
York feels strongly about this from a 
tax policy point of view—included in 
the COVID–19 bill is a very expensive 
change in tax policy that actually is a 
huge tax break for wealthy individuals; 
that is, repealing the SALT changes 
that were made. Over 50 percent of the 
benefit of this goes to the top 1 per-
cent. That is based on the Tax Policy 
Center.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4620 
July 30, 2020 
Based on our own Joint Committee 
on Taxation, which is a nonpartisan 
group here in Congress, what they are 
trying to get through in their legisla-
tion, the Heroes Act—40 percent of that 
benefit or more, according to the Joint 
Committee on Taxation, goes to those 
with income over $1 million. What is 
that doing in the COVID–19 bill? 
The Democratic leader talked about 
the need for more money for testing. I 
couldn’t agree with him more. By the 
way, the proposal that was presented 
by Senator MCCONNELL
earlier this 
week has a lot more money for testing. 
It also has more money for antiviral 
medications, for vaccines, and for en-
suring that workplaces can be safe. It 
has the same amount of money—maybe 
even a little bit more; the Senator 
from Tennessee can tell us—for our 
schools, to be able to reopen our 
schools safely. 
There is a lot of common ground 
here. I think we can find it. I really do. 
I know that today has not been an ex-
ample of that. We are even rejecting 
here—a moment ago—a 7-day simple 
extension of 600 bucks per week. 
But when I look at it, I see the school 
money as being identical, and I see the 
tax provisions that we have to help en-
courage people to go back to work and 
encourage companies and nonprofits to 
put measures in place to make the 
workplace safe, like plexiglass shields 
or more hand sanitizers or PPE. These 
are all things we can agree on. 
Even on the issue of unemployment 
insurance—and I have talked to many 
of my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle about this—I think there is a way 
we can get there. I think Democrats re-
alize that $600 per week does create 
this disincentive because it is, on aver-
age, 134 percent of what people were 
making in the private sector. We can 
come up with a way to deal with that. 
One is a return-to-work bonus, which is 
an idea that has a lot of bipartisan ap-
peal. 
Let’s put aside these games. Let’s 
put aside these extreme positions. 
Let’s figure out how we can come to-
gether. This evening was not a good ex-
ample of that, having rejected the 7- 
day extension of $600 per week of unem-
ployment insurance, but I think now 
we have this opportunity, with the leg-
islation that was passed earlier today, 
to begin to have that debate. We can 
have the debate on unemployment in-
surance. We can have it on a whole 
range of issues—how we deal with 
schools, 
how 
we 
deal 
with 
the 
healthcare crisis we have, the under-
lying crisis. We can deal with all these 
issues in a way that enables us to find 
common ground, to create real solu-
tions for the people we represent as we 
face this unprecedented pandemic. 
With that, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Democratic leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, two 
quick points. One, my friend from 
Ohio—and I know he has lots of good 
ideas and a great deal of sincerity— 
made my point. The vast majority of 
Republicans oppose $600 for any time. 
That is why they are not calling it up 
for a vote—it shows what a stunt the 
Senator from Arizona has done. 
Second, I think all the points my col-
league made about things that are ex-
traneous—they are not; they are re-
lated to COVID. But one thing not in 
our bill—$1.7 billion so the President’s 
hotel doesn’t get competition. That is 
an extraneous thing. It is not in our 
bill. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I 
ask through the Chair, does the Sen-
ator from Ohio wish to speak further? 
Mr. PORTMAN. No. 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I 
thought the Senator from Arizona 
made a very commonsense proposal. 
We are in a position here in the Con-
gress that we often find ourselves in: 
We have different opinions—dramati-
cally different opinions in some cases. 
What she said was, while we are work-
ing those things out, let’s extend the 
$600 unemployment benefit for 7 days 
so people aren’t hurt. That is a com-
monsense proposal. I regret that wasn’t 
adopted. 
I like what the Senator from Ohio 
said. Instead of starting—when you 
have 
a 
disagreement 
over 
several 
items, my experience is that you don’t 
start with the things that you disagree 
on the most; you start with the things 
you agree on the most. 
There are a number of things in the 
House-passed bill and in the Senate Re-
publican bill that was introduced on 
Monday, which the President sup-
ports—let me repeat that. The House of 
Representatives passed a bill. They 
have a Democratic majority. The Sen-
ate has a Republican majority, and we 
have a Republican President. We have 
a Republican President and a Repub-
lican bill, and we have a House-passed 
bill, and it is time to see if we can put 
the two together. That is why we have 
two bodies. But that requires Senators 
and Members of the House who are 
willing to sit down and come to some 
compromise or some resolution of the 
issues. 
There are some things about which 
we have big differences. One is the dol-
lar figure. As the Senator from Ohio 
said, we have already spent $3.5 tril-
lion. That is a number so big, most of 
us couldn’t even speak it before we got 
to this era of the sneaky, dangerous 
COVID virus. 
Let’s look at the other side. On what 
might we agree or many of us agree? 
We don’t have 100 percent on either 
side who are going to agree on most 
anything. 
We might start with schools. Schools 
are starting up in the southern part of 
the United States, where the Presiding 
Officer is from—Florida—and I am 
from Tennessee. Schools are getting 
ready to go back, and so are colleges. 
That means there are 70 million stu-
dents who would like to go back to 
school 
or 
college—100,000 
public 
schools, 35,000 private schools, and 6,000 
colleges. 
What help do they need? They need 
help reopening safely so that they can 
go 
back 
with 
students 
physically 
present as consistent with safety as is 
possible. 
I talked with the Governor of Ten-
nessee, Bill Lee, yesterday. He said 93 
of the 95 counties in Tennessee had 
schools that were going to reopen in 
person. 
Maybe 
not 
every 
student, 
maybe not every class, but in 93 of the 
95 counties, the Governor said they 
know that children need to be in school 
and their parents need for them to be 
in school. Two-thirds of married par-
ents work outside the home. 
This is a bill for the children, though. 
I mean, every teacher, every pediatri-
cian, and almost every parent knows 
that, especially with young children, if 
they are left out of school for such a 
lengthy period of time, it damages 
them; it hurts them. There is a health 
risk in going back, yes—not very much 
for young children—but there is a big-
ger emotional, intellectual, and phys-
ical risk if they stay out of school. 
What have we proposed to do? We 
proposed to help pay for the schools to 
open safely and to help pay for the col-
leges to open safely, which most are 
doing. 
The Chronicle of Higher Education 
said yesterday that 50 percent of our 
colleges plan to open this fall with stu-
dents physically present. Thirty-five 
percent have a mix, with students 
physically present and online instruc-
tion. That means only 13 percent will 
be all virtual—at least that is their 
plan. 
If we could agree on that, why 
shouldn’t we help them? Well, we can 
agree on it because the House of Rep-
resentatives bill and the Senate Repub-
lican bill have almost exactly the same 
amount of money in them—about $1,250 
for K–12 schools—that is a lot of money 
per student; $1,250 per student—and 
about $1,500 per student for colleges to 
help them open safely. We could agree 
on that. 
I think we can agree on childcare. We 
ought to be talking about back to 
school, back to childcare, back to 
work. It is hard to go back to work if 
you don’t have childcare. There are 
provisions in the House bill and the Re-
publican bill that aren’t so different. 
Testing. We all believe, I think, that 
we need maximum advance on testing, 
especially point-of-care testing—quick, 
reliable tests. There is money in the 
Republican bill and in the Democratic 
bill to advance that effort. 
Then there are the small business 
loans, called PPP. That probably was 
the most successful part of the early 
CARES bill, but a bipartisan group of 
Senators has worked on getting rid of 
some of the problems with it and come 
up with a proposal to extend that.

July 30, 2020 
Those are several major points of 
which we agree. And I think the Sen-
ator from Arizona’s suggestion that we 
pass the unemployment benefit for an-
other week while we work together to 
get an agreement was a commonsense 
one. 
(The remarks of Mr. ALEXANDER per-
taining to the introduction of S. 4375 
are printed in today’s RECORD under 
‘‘Statements on Introduced Bills and 
Joint Resolutions.’’) 
Mr. ALEXANDER. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
SUPREME COURT 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, I came 
to this floor 3 weeks ago to talk about 
the U.S. Supreme Court. I come today 
to revise and extend my remarks. 
There are now five Republican-ap-
pointed Justices on the Court. Actu-
ally, Republicans have appointed 11 out 
of the last 15 Justices to the bench, but 
is this the conservative Court we have 
worked for? More to the point, is this a 
constitutionalist Court? 
The only thing I can say for certain 
when looking at the results of this last 
term, that in the words of the late Jus-
tice Scalia: ‘‘The Imperial Judiciary 
lives.’’ 
This is a Court that freely rewrites 
congressional statutes, that has pro-
tected the worst leftwing Presidents of 
earlier years, that in the final week of 
its term, gave away half of the State of 
Oklahoma. 
For those who consider themselves 
constitutional conservatives, these de-
cisions are a clarion call to wake up 
and to acknowledge what is staring us 
in the face: Judicial imperialism is 
alive and well. It is marching on un-
daunted. 
For religious conservatives, these de-
cisions are a call to action. Now is the 
time for us to be heard, and we can 
begin with what we expect of our nomi-
nees to the High Court, what we expect 
them to understand, what we expect 
them to affirm. 
That brings me to the case that pro-
pelled religious conservatives into ac-
tivism and politics in a new way over 
four decades ago—the case that, for re-
ligious conservatives, made the Su-
preme Court the great issue of the day: 
Roe v. Wade. I know that when it 
comes to the Supreme Court, we are 
not supposed to talk about Roe. That is 
the open secret on the right. It is cer-
tainly what religious conservatives 
have been told for years: Don’t mess up 
the Supreme Court nomination process 
by raising Roe. It is imprudent. It is in 
poor taste. It will divide our coalition. 
No, we are supposed to stick to talk-
ing about process, about methods, 
maybe throw in some talk about um-
pires, but do not talk about Roe. 
Well, the truth is, Roe is the reason 
we have a legal conservative movement 
to begin with. Roe is what propelled 
generations of religious conservatives 
to vote for Republican Presidents and 
Republican Senators and Republican 
politicians of every rank and station— 
all on the promise to reverse this trav-
esty of a decision, this moral and social 
injustice that in 47 years has taken the 
lives of 61 million unborn—61 million. 
Republicans have said: Vote for us. 
Vote for us, and we will undo this 
wrong. We will return this issue to the 
people. Yet all these years later—11 Re-
publican-appointed 
Justices 
later— 
here we are. The Nation is apparently 
no closer to the day when the Supreme 
Court will renounce this outrage, re-
nounce its imperial pretensions, and 
allow the good and decent people of 
this Nation to debate and decide this 
matter for ourselves. 
So I say to my Republican col-
leagues: How long must this go on? 
How many more elections must there 
be? How many more promises must be 
made? How many more Justices must 
be appointed before we will expect of 
our nominees what the voters already 
expect of us? How long before we ask 
our nominees to the Supreme Court of 
the United States to recognize Roe as 
the outrage that it is? 
Let’s just be frank. Roe is an illegit-
imate decision. It has no basis in the 
Constitution—none. It has no basis in 
the law. None of the Constitution’s spe-
cific and enumerated guarantees of pri-
vacy even begin to legitimize the tak-
ing of innocent human life; none are re-
motely on point. 
Even liberal scholars recognize this. 
Whole books are written about what 
Roe v. Wade should have said. Roe 
marks the point at which the modern 
Supreme 
Court 
decided 
that 
they 
would just impose their own views— 
their own social and moral and legal 
views—on the Nation, despite what the 
people want, despite what the Con-
stitution says, no matter how the laws 
are written. 
In the words of the late constitu-
tional scholar, John Hart Ely—who 
was, I would point out, a political lib-
eral—‘‘Roe is not constitutional law 
and it gives almost no sense of an obli-
gation to try to be.’’ 
Roe is the very essence of judicial 
imperialism. It is a brazen power grab 
by unelected Justices imposing their 
moral and social views on the Nation, 
just like another group of Justices did 
in a case called Plessy v. Ferguson, 
just like another group of Justices did 
before that in a case called Dred Scott. 
Yes, I do mean to compare Roe to 
those earlier cases because Dred Scott 
and Plessy and Roe belong together. 
They are the worst miscarriages of jus-
tice in our history—the worst judicial 
opinions of all time. Dred Scott and 
Plessy and Roe are abusive, morally re-
pugnant decisions that wounded the 
soul of this Nation. They dishonored 
this Nation’s fundamental face in the 
dignity and worth of every person. 
For these reasons, Roe is no sec-
ondary issue, something to be pushed 
to the side in the nomination process. 
Roe is central. Roe is a window into 
the constitutional world view of a 
would-be Justice. It is a measure of 
their sense of what a Justice should be. 
Because if you believe that Roe was 
rightly decided, then there just is no 
two ways about it, you are a judicial 
imperialist. If you believe Roe was 
rightly 
decided, 
you 
believe 
that 
unelected judges should have the power 
to enact their social views, to promote 
their own social agenda, regardless of 
what the Constitution says or what we 
the people have expressed preference 
for, voted for, and enacted into law. 
I would just add that it seems to be 
the case, inevitably, that when Jus-
tices enact their views, they enact the 
views of a certain social class. Oh, yes. 
The highly educated, managerial front 
row of American society, the class of 
the faculty lounge and the C-suite, 
that is what you get when judges gov-
ern America. That is not what the Con-
stitution calls for. That is not what the 
Constitution specifies. The Constitu-
tion says that sovereignty rests with 
‘‘We the People’’; that it should be the 
people who are in charge. It is what the 
American people want and have writ-
ten in their fundamental law and in 
their statutes that should carry the 
day. 
The people have a right to run their 
own government. They have a right to 
expect their views to prevail, to have 
their Constitution be obeyed, and to 
expect that the Justices appointed to 
their Supreme Court will abide by the 
Constitution’s terms as we the people 
wrote them. 
That is why I say today: I will vote 
only for those Supreme Court nominees 
who have explicitly acknowledged that 
Roe v. Wade was wrongly decided the 
day it was decided. I say again: I will 
vote for those nominees only and for 
those nominees alone. When I say ‘‘ex-
plicitly acknowledge,’’ I mean on the 
record before they are nominated. I do 
not want private assurances; I do not 
seek them. I do not want forecasts 
about future votes or future behavior 
because, frankly, I wouldn’t believe 
them. I don’t want promises of any 
sort. I want evidence that Supreme 
Court nominees will obey the Constitu-
tion and the law. I want to see in the 
record clear acknowledgement that 
any nominee understands Roe to be the 
travesty that it is. If that record is not 
there, then I will not support the nomi-
nation. I don’t care who does the nomi-
nating. 
Some will say that this is yesterday’s 
battle; that we should just accept Roe 
and move on; that today’s Supreme 
Court is the best we could possibly 
hope for, to which I say that every sin-
gle life is worth fighting for. I will not 
accept failure, and I will not accept de-
feat. I take this stand because I believe 
it is what justice and fidelity to the 
law requires in our time of me and of 
those who would exercise the awesome 
power of judicial review entrusted to 
Justices in article III of our Constitu-
tion. 
I also believe it is what the Repub-
lican Party owes the millions of Ameri-
cans who have made this cause the rea-
son for their vote for many years—

these men and women of good will and 
faith who labor still day in and day 
out, rejoicing in hope, patient in tribu-
lation, working for that time when jus-
tice will be done. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Hawaii. 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I would 
say that the views expressed by the 
good Senator from Missouri are not 
views widely shared by people in this 
country. And to compare the decisions 
in Plessy v. Ferguson and the Dred 
Scott decisions with the Roe decision 
dishonors the memory of Congressman 
John Lewis, who only today was bur-
ied, put to rest in Georgia. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. President, the COVID–19 pan-
demic has laid bare the systemic racial 
inequities, 
inequalities 
in 
our 
healthcare system. 
While the virus has touched Ameri-
cans of every race and nationality, it 
disproportionately impacts people of 
color. We all know that. People of color 
make up just 40 percent of our coun-
try’s population but account for over 60 
percent of all coronavirus cases and 50 
percent of deaths from coronavirus. 
These inequities manifest themselves 
differently in each of our States. In Ha-
waii, for example, we are seeing pro-
nounced disparities among our Pacific 
Islander community and particularly 
among citizens of the Freely Associ-
ated States of Micronesia, the Marshall 
Islands, and Palau. I am focusing my 
remarks on this vibrant community 
today because our country has rarely 
done right by them. Let me give you 
some background. 
After liberating their territory in 
World War II, the United States admin-
istered the Trust Territory of the Pa-
cific—which includes what are now the 
Freely Associated States—for nearly 40 
years. Even in the most generous char-
acterization, the United States failed 
to live up to its trust obligations to 
promote the political, social, and eco-
nomic development of the region. 
In addition to chronically under-
funding 
social 
programs 
like 
healthcare and education, the United 
States used the Marshall Islands as a 
base for dozens of nuclear tests over a 
12-year period, from 1946 to 1958, in-
cluding the 15-megaton Castle Bravo— 
the largest thermonuclear device ever 
detonated by the United States. Dec-
ades later, the citizens of Micronesia 
and the Marshall Islands continued to 
suffer 
generational 
health 
con-
sequences with substantially increased 
rates of cancer, birth defects, and mis-
carriages. 
In 1986, the Federated States of Mi-
cronesia and the Republic of the Mar-
shall Islands achieved independence 
and formally entered into Compacts of 
Free Association, COFA, with the 
United States. Palau followed in 1994. 
Under the terms of these compacts, 
these three countries provide the U.S. 
military with exclusive access to their 
strategically situated lands in ex-
change for security guarantees, eco-
nomic and financial assistance, and the 
right of their citizens to travel, work, 
and live in the United States without 
having visas. 
It is difficult to overstate the impor-
tance of the compacts to our strategic 
interests in the Indo-Pacific region. In 
a Senate Armed Services Committee 
hearing last year, U.S. INDOPACOM 
Commander ADM Philip Davidson suc-
cinctly noted how the compact nations 
‘‘contribute way out of proportion to 
their population in our defense.’’ This 
is particularly true with respect to 
China, wherein our compacts with 
these island nations enable us to lit-
erally hold the line against aggressive 
Chinese economic and military expan-
sion throughout Oceania. 
If we are to ensure a free and open 
Indo-Pacific, we must treat the com-
pact nations with the respect they de-
serve. First and foremost, this means 
keeping the promises we have made to 
these 
partners, 
especially 
on 
healthcare. Our initial compact agree-
ments stipulated that COFA citizens 
were eligible for a range of Federal pro-
grams as ‘‘permanently residing under 
color of law,’’ including Medicaid cov-
erage. The so-called welfare reform law 
of 1996, however, resulted in COFA citi-
zens’ suddenly becoming ineligible for 
Medicaid and other Federal programs 
even as they may live in the United 
States legally and indefinitely. 
I have done some research as to what 
happened in the welfare reform law, 
and there is absolutely nothing in the 
legislative history of that law to indi-
cate why, suddenly, COFA citizens 
were not eligible for Medicaid cov-
erage. According to a report from the 
University of Hawaii Economic Re-
search Organization, the exclusion of 
COFA citizens from Medicaid increased 
the mortality rate of COFA citizens by 
20 percent and contributed to signifi-
cant public health issues in my home 
State of Hawaii. 
I have led the fight to pass bipartisan 
legislation to restore Medicaid eligi-
bility for COFA citizens throughout 
my time in the Senate, and we have 
come close to righting this wrong on 
several occasions, including in the bi-
partisan comprehensive immigration 
bill that the Senate passed in 2013. 
The COVID–19 pandemic injects a 
new urgency into this effort. All across 
the country, COFA citizens work in es-
sential industries like meat processing, 
food service, and custodial services. 
These jobs put COFA citizens at an in-
creased risk, and they are suffering dis-
proportionately from COVID–19 as a re-
sult. 
In Hawaii, Pacific Islanders make up 
about 4 percent of our population but 
account for nearly a quarter of our 
COVID–19 cases. In northwest Arkan-
sas, the Marshallese make up no more 
than 3 percent of the population but 
have suffered half the deaths. In Du-
buque, IA, the Marshallese community 
accounts for more than a third of the 
city’s COVID–19 deaths despite their 
making up only about 1 percent of the 
city’s population. 
A number of factors drives these dis-
parities, 
but 
reduced 
access 
to 
healthcare certainly isn’t helping. In 
fact, it is hurting a lot. The Govern-
ment Accountability Office estimates 
that 14 percent of COFA citizens in Ha-
waii 
lack 
health 
insurance—nearly 
three times the State’s average. Na-
tionwide, 22 percent of COFA citizens 
are uninsured. 
In the absence of restored Medicaid 
eligibility, 
which 
would 
certainly 
lower the number of uninsured COFA 
citizens, our community health centers 
are, once again, stepping up. My con-
versations earlier this month with rep-
resentatives from Kokua Kalihi Valley 
Comprehensive Family Services and 
West Hawaii Community Health Center 
reinforced the crucial role these com-
munity health centers play in building 
reciprocal trust with the communities 
they serve. Both community health 
centers have been working closely with 
COFA citizens to combat stigma and 
fear by reaching out directly to the 
community to encourage them to seek 
care. This includes providing testing 
and outreach services in multiple lan-
guages. They have also been coordi-
nating food deliveries to families, in-
cluding to COFA citizens who are quar-
antining at home, and assisting some 
families with alternate housing ar-
rangements so they can isolate away 
from healthy family members. 
Our health centers are doing excep-
tional work with COFA citizens, and I 
strongly support providing them robust 
funding in the next COVID–19 relief 
bill. 
Most importantly, we need to uphold 
our commitment to the compact na-
tions and restore Medicaid eligibility 
for COFA citizens who are legally in 
our country. We can do that by includ-
ing my Covering our FAS Allies Act to 
restore Medicaid eligibility for COFA 
citizens in the next COVID relief bill. 
In the Heroes Act, the House has al-
ready restored eligibility to this popu-
lation, and it is time for the Senate to 
join them in righting an historic 
wrong. 
I yield the floor.

The Senator from Nevada. 
HEALS ACT 
Ms. ROSEN. Mr. President, this Na-
tion faces a moment of crisis. The 
coronavirus pandemic has taken a seri-
ous and devastating toll on our coun-
try. Right now, in every corner of 
America, families are struggling to get 
by, and they are worried about what 
the future holds in store for them. 
Americans are worried about where 
their next paychecks will come from. 
They are worried about whether or not 
they will be able to keep their small 
businesses open. They are worried 
about how they will be able to pay 
their mortgages, their rent, or their 
utility bills, and they are worried 
about how they are going to feed their 
children. 
As I said before, this is a time of cri-
sis, but it is a moment that we can 
overcome together. We are a nation 
that in the face of great challenges has 
responded with caring and compas-
sionate 
leadership. 
COVID–19 
is 
a 
major challenge—make no mistake 
about that—but we as a Congress can 
bring real and meaningful results to 
the American people. I am sad to say 
that the legislation introduced by 
Leader MCCONNELL, the HEALS Act, 
does not do this. In fact, it does not 
even come close. 
This is a bill that slashes Federal un-
employment assistance for people who 
are out of work not due to any fault of 
their own and because of a deadly pan-
demic and an unprecedented economic 
catastrophe. This is a bill that has no 
money for programs like SNAP to en-
sure that American children don’t go 
hungry. This is a bill that provides no 
support to State and local governments 
so that they can continue to provide 
critical services during the pandemic. 
This is a bill that provides no support 
for the EIDL Program or EIDL Ad-
vance, which provide direct support to 
small businesses to pay their operating 
expenses. This is also a bill that 
doesn’t even continue the eviction 
moratorium, putting countless Ameri-
cans at risk of losing their homes as 
soon as this weekend when the rent 
comes due. This is unacceptable. 
In Nevada, our travel and tourism in-
dustry has been hit hard by the pan-
demic, which has hurt our entire econ-
omy. In April, unemployment reached 
over 30 percent—30 percent. It is the 
highest in our Nation. Even now, 
months later, unemployment is still in 
the double digits—15 percent by the 
last count—which is more than four 
times our prepandemic level. 
Now, just as Nevadans feel that we 
can’t take any more pain, this bill 
plans to slash unemployment relief? 
Amidst our unemployment crisis, 
State and local governments are also 
struggling. In Nevada and across our 
country, our public employees have 
been on the frontlines of the pandemic, 
fighting against the disease and work-
ing to ensure the safety and well-being 
of all Americans. 
With little revenue coming in and 
significant costs going out, our States, 
our cities, our towns, and our Tribes 
are now facing massive budget short-
falls that will require cuts to critical 
programs and which threaten the pay 
of our teachers, our firefighters, and 
our first responders. The HEALS Act— 
Senator 
MCCONNELL’s 
proposal—has 
zero funds for any of them. 
While the majority leader’s party 
prides itself on helping business, our 
Nation’s small businesses, too, are left 
behind in his legislation. 
Small businesses, the economic en-
gines 
that 
keep 
our 
communities 
going, have been hammered by this 
pandemic. But the HEALS Act has 
zero—zero additional funding for the 
Economic Injury Disaster Loan Pro-
gram, which has benefited millions of 
small businesses nationwide, including 
tens of thousands of small businesses 
in Nevada. 
Senator CORNYN and I introduced bi-
partisan legislation last week that 
would not only provide $180 billion in 
funds to the EIDL and EIDL Advance 
Programs but will also lift the Small 
Business 
Administration’s 
arbitrary 
caps on the loans and grants that all 
small businesses can receive. 
Real bipartisan solutions are pos-
sible, but our bipartisan proposal to 
help small businesses is not in Senator 
MCCONNELL’s bill either. 
Let’s be clear. The HEALS Act is not 
a bipartisan solution, and it does not 
address all the needs of the American 
people. Just as a house cannot stand 
without support from a sturdy founda-
tion, we cannot expect the American 
people to stand upon a bill that is the 
legislative equivalent of cheap drywall 
and a coat of paint. 
Our constituents, my constituents, 
need real support, a lifeline, not just 
window dressing. So I ask my col-
leagues in this body to rise to the chal-
lenge we face and provide that lifeline 
to the people of Nevada and to all of 
the American people. 
Let’s help people keep their homes. 
Let’s help families feed their children. 
Let’s help small businesses keep their 
doors open. We must come together 
and 
develop 
timely, 
targeted, 
and 
thoughtful legislation to protect both 
the lives and livelihoods of the Amer-
ican people during this crisis. They de-
serve no less. 
Across the country right now, sci-
entists and healthcare professionals 
are working around the clock, maxi-
mizing resources, developing innova-
tive ways to protect the health of our 
Nation and save lives. As they work 
day in and day out, Congress needs to 
do the same. 
The House passed the Heroes Act 
over 2 months ago. It is long past time 
for the Senate to get to work. It is im-
perative that the Senate remain in ses-
sion and that Senators remain in 
Washington, 
working 
tomorrow 
through the weekend until the Senate 
passes a true coronavirus relief bill. 
Working Americans don’t get Fridays 
off, and neither should Congress. 
Although we may not agree on every 
aspect of how to address this crisis, my 
Democratic colleagues and I stand 
ready to work across the aisle to de-
liver relief to the American people. 
So I ask the majority leader, who 
controls our schedule—I ask him this: 
Don’t we owe it to our constituents, to 
the American people, all Americans, to 
work through the weekend until we 
have an agreement? The essential 
workers on the frontlines of this battle 
aren’t taking the weekend off to rest, 
and neither should we. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
ELECTIONS 
Ms. 
CANTWELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
while I come to the floor this after-
noon, I am kind of questioning whether 
the heat of Washington, DC, has gotten 
to people. Clearly, it has been a record 
July here, with 90-plus degree tempera-
tures every day. But the notion that we 
should somehow cancel the election in 
the fall, I think, is either the heat of 
the 
moment 
or 
just 
clear 
wrongheadedness. 
I have been waiting for some time to 
come to floor to talk about our voting 
system and why it is so important to 
protect it and why now we should rec-
ognize that Americans, in having to 
deal with the coronavirus, have had the 
ability to vote and the ability to get 
there and the ability to be protected 
while they are voting. It has occurred 
in several elections that we need to be 
doing more. 
That is why I continue to support the 
efforts of our colleagues to make sure 
that we are doing everything we can to 
protect elections. 
I know that Leader MCCONNELL has 
proposed the HEALS Act, but it doesn’t 
contain any money for helping safe and 
secure elections in November. I know 
that the House bill, the Heroes Act, 
does help put money in place to keep 
polling workers safe during the pan-
demic. I know that we have other legis-
lation, whether it is Senator WYDEN’s 
bill, which I am on, the Vote By Mail

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4624 
July 30, 2020 
Act, which would help eligible U.S. vot-
ers vote by mail, or whether it is other 
legislation, like that of my colleague 
Senator KLOBUCHAR, to help back up 
paper ballots and create election secu-
rity grants to help States improve 
their cybersecurity. 
I have talked many times at many 
hearings about our challenges with cy-
bersecurity, and I know that all this 
legislation—my colleagues have been 
out here on the floor, and they have 
tried to bring them up, but to no avail. 
Well, I think instead of suggesting 
that the election be canceled, the 
President should be advocating that 
Congress pass aid and assistance to 
States to make sure that, during the 
COVID pandemic, things are in place so 
that poll workers can get to their jobs 
on time, that they can work effectively 
in doing that and protect their health 
and security and protect the health 
and security of the public. What I don’t 
think he should do is to diminish the 
very important role that mail-in ballot 
voting has had in the United States of 
America. 
I say that coming from a State where 
we have mail-in ballots. The mail-in 
ballot system has grown over time to 
be the primary way in which we vote in 
the State of Washington. I say it is the 
primary way because I am sure there 
are ways that people can show up and 
vote at particular election offices, and 
there are probably other things. But, 
no, we don’t have an election site. For 
those who love going to the polling 
places as a way to exercise their de-
mocracy and their rights, I appreciate 
that too. There is nothing better than 
participating in the democracy of an 
election by going there and casting a 
vote. But you also can increase the 
participation of the American public to 
vote by mail if you give them that op-
portunity. 
So it just happened to occur that on 
my way in today, I was actually trying 
to cast my own ballot; that is, I have 
my mail-in ballot for the August 4 elec-
tion that is going to happen next week, 
and I want to make sure I fulfill my 
constitutional duty to vote in the next 
election. So I think it is a great oppor-
tunity to come to the Senate floor and 
put stock really to the myth that I 
think the President is continuing to 
create that you cannot vote by mail. 
Here is my mail-in ballot. Here is the 
ballot that is sent to my home address 
in Edmonds, WA. It basically has the 
date of the election on it and requires 
me to fill it out and return it. What is 
great about this ballot is this. First of 
all, I love mail-in voting. 
Even if I liked going to the polling 
place, what you now get enclosed, in 
addition to your ballot, is a voters’ 
guide, which is sent by the secretary of 
State. It is pretty thick because can-
didates also give a statement about 
why they are running. Literally, the 
citizens of Washington, weeks in ad-
vance before getting this ballot, can sit 
and leaf through the various positions 
of candidates, and they also include 
websites. If you want to go to the can-
didate’s website and look up more in-
formation about a candidate or see 
where they stand on an issue, it is a 
guide that helps you understand what 
your ballot is and who is on it. 
Who doesn’t think that is a great 
way to inform the American people 
about voting? We have one of the high-
est voting rates in the Nation. As I say 
that, I know that there are States that 
are not mail-in ballot States that also 
have high numbers in Presidential 
election years, but the great thing 
about our vote-by-mail system is we 
have a pretty good participation by our 
public in off-year elections. The school 
board election or local county election 
or even a regional election gets the at-
tention that I believe is important for 
democracy and for voter participation. 
I actually happened to start filling 
out my ballot this morning. I am not 
going to show everybody whom I voted 
for, but I will just show you what the 
front of the ballot looks like. 
I did vote already in the Governor’s 
race. No doubt I voted for a Democrat. 
I am a Democrat. 
At the top of this ballot, once I am 
done, I get to tear off this device right 
here. It says: I voted. So there I go. I 
got a little boost to my democracy 
gene. I am so glad I participated. 
Here is the actual number of this bal-
lot and an ID, and I tear that off. I tear 
that off and keep it. I keep this, and 
this is proof that I mailed this ballot. 
That is the great part of our system. 
Just for those who are really curious 
about this, I now have a privacy enve-
lope. Now that I am done filling out my 
ballot, I stick it in this privacy enve-
lope. Why do I do that? If somebody 
thinks that my privacy is violated be-
cause on the outside of this envelope I 
sign this signature, they separate these 
two things. This privacy envelope sepa-
rates this and throws the ballots that 
are legitimate to be counted, and now 
no one knows exactly how I voted. 
I take this privacy envelope, and I 
stick it in the official document enve-
lope that I am going to mail back. So 
I stick it in there, and guess what I 
have to do? I have to sign and date it. 
That signature is the validation of this 
system. It is the validation by my sig-
nature, the same as when I went into a 
voting booth, as we used to do, and 
signed my name. It is a validation 
against someone who is trying to cre-
ate mischief with this system. It is 
what makes the vote-by-mail system 
work effectively in our State. I say 
that because our State has had many 
close elections, and yet no one has ever 
contested the outcome of the final 
election because we go through this 
system. 
Yes, we have had some very inter-
esting incidents. We had a very close 
Governor’s race once, where as they 
were recounting the ballots and count-
ing through the official system, a gen-
tleman owned up that he had voted for 
his wife who had died. He was so wor-
ried that he was going to get caught in 
this system that he owned up in ad-
vance and said: I am sorry. I might be 
one of the seven final votes in this de-
cision, and I want to tell people I made 
a mistake. I know that she was so en-
thusiastic, but she passed away, and it 
was just a few days ago. So I went 
ahead and voted for her. 
So, no, that is not allowed under this 
system. This system works because we 
know who people are, and we have a 
validation of this system. This system 
allows us to participate and understand 
the election process. 
So I don’t know why the President 
will not let America vote, only if they 
vote in a way that he thinks is—well, I 
am not sure, because now he is saying 
we should delay the election. He is say-
ing it should be delayed. I am saying 
what the President should be doing to 
help the constitutional rights of Amer-
ican citizens is protecting their right 
to vote by helping to secure our elec-
tion sites with enough workers, people 
working at the polls if they choose to 
go and do that, and also protecting our 
mail-in ballot system by allowing 
those States that want to pursue a 
mail-in ballot to make sure that those 
ballots work and are delivered on time 
so that they can be counted. 
I don’t expect every State in the 
Union to adopt the same philosophy as 
the State of Washington, but clearly 
our State allows enough time for those 
ballots to get there. They allow so 
many days after the election. Why? Be-
cause we have a lot of military. We 
have 10 military bases, and we have a 
lot of people from Washington who are 
stationed overseas, and their ballots 
should not be made invalid just be-
cause they mailed them before the 
election but somehow, because of the 
travel time, they didn’t get there in a 
timely fashion. So our State considers 
7 days, the postmark after 7 days if it 
is delivered. 
I know that for some people this is 
all new. They don’t want to move to 
this. I guarantee you, in 25 years we 
will all be voting by mail. This system 
will be in place, and we will be asking 
ourselves: Why did we drag our feet? 
I am at least heartened to hear that 
my Republican colleagues in the Sen-
ate have squashed the President’s idea 
of canceling the election. Now what I 
want to hear is, Are they going to help 
us get the dollars and the systems in 
place to allow America to vote, to 
allow them to vote with confidence, 
not to constantly hear an undermining 
of that process but a support of that 
process, and not to undermine vote-by- 
mail, because it has worked in Wash-
ington? It has worked. 
I was elected in the year 2000 and 
only won by 2,229 votes—not a lot—cast 
out of the huge number of voters in our 
State. Yet people had confidence in 
that system. It is not as if the numbers 
didn’t change in a recount here or 
there or somebody found a mistake 
here or there. It was that we had a sys-
tem where you can find a mistake.

So stop trying to cancel the election 
based on the success of what has em-
powered more Americans to vote and 
be involved and be educated in our de-
mocracy. Let America vote, and let’s 
get on with putting the securities in 
place that will help America get to the 
polling places in a secure fashion and 
get their ballots to the election offi-
cials in a timely manner. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
REMEMBERING JOHN LEWIS 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, on 
February 21, 1940, John Lewis was born 
in Troy, AL—a son of sharecroppers, 
born to be a person to bring good trou-
ble to the Nation. He grew up on his 
family’s farm and attended segregated 
public schools in Pike County, AL. 
As a young boy, he was inspired by 
the activism that surrounded him—the 
Montgomery 
bus 
boycott 
and 
the 
works of a leader name Rev. Dr. Martin 
Luther King, Jr. He attended Fisk Uni-
versity, and he organized sit-in dem-
onstrations 
in 
segregated 
lunch 
counters in Nashville, TN. 
In 1961, he started participating in 
the Freedom Rides. He was just a 
young man. He would get on board a 
segregated bus, and he would dare to 
sit in the ‘‘Whites Only’’ area just to 
make a simple statement—that any 
person of any race should be able to sit 
anywhere they choose to sit in Amer-
ica, and it would be OK. He literally 
risked his life just riding on a bus in 
the wrong seat. 
He became best known in 1963 when 
he helped to organize the March on 
Washington. He was part of what they 
called the Big Six in the civil rights 
movement. He was nationally recog-
nized. We lose track of the fact that in 
1963 he was one of the keynote speakers 
in the March on Washington. He stood 
in front of the Lincoln Memorial at 23 
years old. 
His focus on nonviolent protests, his 
focus on training people on how to 
speak out for what is just and for what 
is right, his focus on challenging people 
to rethink justice and to be able to see 
all people as being created in the image 
of God, all people equal, was a message 
that our Nation needed to hear and was 
a message he delivered over and over 
again. From his youngest days, he 
brought good trouble, as he said, to our 
Nation to awaken us. 
He led 600 peaceful, orderly pro-
testers across the Edmund Pettus 
Bridge in Selma, AL, on March 7, 1965. 
They were going to march from Selma 
to Montgomery to demonstrate the 
need for voting rights changes in the 
State of Alabama, but Alabama State 
Troopers met them there in what is 
known as Bloody Sunday. He and other 
peaceful protesters, simply marching, 
were attacked and beaten for doing 
what is just. 
It was a telling thing to see John 
Lewis’s body this past week cross that 
historic bridge one last time, and as he 
crossed, to have Alabama State Troop-
ers stand on the bridge and salute his 
body as it went by because John Lewis 
brought change to America. 
John Lewis was elected to Congress 
in 1986 in Georgia’s Fifth Congressional 
District, where he served faithfully. He 
was affectionately known as being the 
conscience of the Congress. 
He was trained in religious teachings. 
He had a theological degree. He was 
often called ‘‘the reverend.’’ He never 
lost track of his faith. He treated peo-
ple with respect. Even people he dis-
agreed with and voted differently from, 
he would treat them with respect in a 
way that would honor God and honor 
them and honor his own family. 
What is interesting, some of the 
statements John Lewis has made over 
the years always struck me. His quiet 
demeanor and his stern way of address-
ing justice always came back to his 
faith. A statement he made in 2004 
really sticks with me. He said: 
I’m deeply concerned that many people 
today fail to realize that the movement was 
built on deep-seated religious convictions, 
and the movement grew out of a sense of 
faith—faith in God and faith in one’s fellow 
human beings. 
Many of us who were participants in this 
movement saw our involvement as an exten-
sion of our faith. 
He said: 
We saw ourselves doing the work of the Al-
mighty. Segregation and racial discrimina-
tion were not in keeping with our faith, and 
so we had to do something. 
And he did. 
Representative Lewis left a long leg-
acy as a civil rights leader. He will not 
be forgotten in our Nation. The Big Six 
leaders made significant changes. I 
think about those changes he saw just 
in his lifetime and the changes that he, 
personally, was engaged in making in 
our Nation. Representative Lewis once 
made the statement: ‘‘When people tell 
me nothing has changed, I tell them, 
come walk in my shoes and I will show 
you change’’ because Representative 
Lewis, just in his lifetime, in the bat-
tles he fought, led, and changed, 
changed segregated schools in Amer-
ica; took away segregated water foun-
tains in America; took away seg-
regated movie theaters in America; 
took away segregated public transport 
in America; changed how people ap-
plied for jobs, got jobs, enjoyed their 
jobs; changed the opportunities for a 
person being able to live wherever they 
wanted to live in America; changed 
even how we vote in giving equal ac-
cess for every American to be able to 
get to the ballot and vote. That is just 
in John Lewis’s lifetime. He left a leg-
acy of change. 
His nonviolent protests, his training 
in leading people, stands in stark con-
trast to what I see some people who 
call it protests are doing right now. 
When I see what is happening right 
now in Portland every night and 
watching individuals gear up and lit-
erally attacking Federal law enforce-
ment, throwing Molotov cocktails at 
them, pointing laser pointers at their 
eyes, shooting large-scale fireworks at 
them, trying to set a building on fire— 
when I watch that and those individ-
uals trying to say they are protesting 
for justice—they are not protesting for 
what is just. John Lewis was protesting 
for what is just. 
John Lewis made the change in 
America, led a Nation and led a genera-
tion, even as a young 23-year-old man, 
to do the right thing in the right way. 
The change that he brought is a gift to 
the generations for millennia in our 
Nation. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
HEALS ACT 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, it is 
Thursday afternoon, and normally I 
come down to the Senate floor to talk 
about the Alaskan of the Week—what I 
call that person. It is one of my favor-
ite things to do in the Senate. But I 
just witnessed something so remark-
able and disturbing that I actually 
want to come down to the Senate floor 
and explain what just happened on the 
floor because I think a lot of people 
probably missed it, if they are watch-
ing at home, and maybe didn’t under-
stand it. There was a lot of discussion 
going on here. Let me just say that the 
Senate minority leader from New York 
just objected to extending the current 
level of unemployment insurance in 
the CARES Act—$600 a week to help 
American workers who had been laid 
off due to the pandemic. He just ob-
jected to that and stopped legislation 
that was moving on the floor to extend 
unemployment insurance for another 
week. Let me repeat that: The Senate 
minority leader of the U.S. Senate, 
when we are moving in good faith, as 
we are discussing and negotiating bills 
here, one element of CARES that is 
going to expire at the end of this 
month, unemployment insurance in the 
CARES Act, the Senate minority lead-
er just blocked that from happening. 
Who knows why, but there will be mil-
lions of Americans, in 2 days, who will 
lose that benefit, and the Senate mi-
nority leader just blocked it. 
I sure hope our friends in the media 
write this story because that is ex-
actly, exactly, exactly what happened. 
Let me describe in a little bit more 
detail. As you would expect in a democ-
racy, in the U.S. Senate, we have been 
debating, working on, and negotiating 
a new relief package due to the pan-
demic. In March, we passed unani-
mously in this body the CARES Act to 
try to bring relief to our fellow Ameri-
cans whom we knew were going to be 
hurting from this pandemic. We didn’t 
have a crystal ball on how long relief 
could last or should last for unemploy-
ment, for businesses, for small busi-
nesses, for families, for hospitals, for 
schools, or for fishermen. So we are 
now working on, as you expect in a de-
mocracy, what we view as the appro-
priate next level because this has ex-
tended longer than any of us thought, 
and the impacts are very significant. 
That is what we are doing here.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4626 
July 30, 2020 
The Republicans put forward the 
Health, Economic Assistance, Liability 
Protection, and Schools Act—HEALS. I 
think it is a good bill. It is not a per-
fect bill, but it has very significant— 
very significant resources for schools, 
for hospitals, and for families. 
When I was home in Alaska and tak-
ing calls with my fellow Alaskans and 
heard what their priorities are and 
heard what they said was really impor-
tant for them to have in any kind of 
the next relief package, part of my job 
is to listen and try to work hard to get 
that done. 
There is a lot in the HEALS Act that 
is exactly what my constituents have 
been pressing for, what they need, and 
what I believe they need. 
Let me give you a couple of exam-
ples: more flexibility for States and 
local governments on how to use the 
CARES Act funding that they already 
have, a very high priority; additional 
funds for our fishermen. The Presiding 
Officer knows how important that is, 
being 
from 
Florida. 
The 
original 
CARES Act had $300 million. That was 
a provision I got into the CARES Act 
for fishermen. It is not enough but 
something important to this really 
critical part of the Alaskan, American, 
and Florida economies. The HEALS 
Act has $500 million in it because they 
have been hit so hard. There is eco-
nomic assistance in terms of another 
round of paycheck protection for small 
businesses whose revenues have been 
crushed, like in the tourism industry. 
Again, that is something my constitu-
ents have been asking about. Allowing 
501(c)6s to access the PPP, that is in 
there. Allowing certain PPP borrowers, 
like fishermen and seasonal businesses 
to request an increase in loan amounts 
due to the changes that were in the in-
terim final rules that came out of the 
Treasury Department, that is in there. 
Dramatic expansion of testing, more 
funding for vaccine development, ev-
eryone wants that. Securing supply 
chains for crucial medical equipment 
and critical minerals, many of which 
we have in Alaska, that is all in there. 
It is a pretty good bill. It is not per-
fect, but it is a pretty good bill. 
The competing bill, you may have 
seen, you may have read in the paper a 
couple of months ago, came from the 
House—the so-called Heroes Act. It is a 
behemoth in terms of the pricetag, and 
it has some things that, actually, are 
similar to the HEALS Act: school fund-
ing, hospitals. It has other things that 
aren’t in the HEALS Act, some things 
that I think would be completely un-
necessary: a huge tax break for some of 
the richest Americans in the HEROES 
Act. Yes, that is in there. Economic 
impact payments for illegal immi-
grants—I don’t think that is a priority 
right now, at least not for my constitu-
ents. An overt attack on Alaska Native 
organizations, dozens and dozens of 
them, 
Alaska 
Native 
corporations, 
stripping them of any Federal funds 
they receive in the CARES Act, that is 
in the House-passed Heroes Act. Trust 
me, that will never pass on the Senate 
floor because I will not allow it. But 
that is in there. It is a highly inappro-
priate attack on 20 percent of the popu-
lation in my State. 
But here is the point: These are 
starting points. This is what happens 
in the Senate—or at least I thought 
these were starting points. 
But I guess I was wrong because, 
when my good friend from Arizona 
came down and said we are having ne-
gotiations on these bills, we are having 
negotiations on how and to what de-
gree to extend unemployment insur-
ance from the Federal Government— 
she put forward a bill that we all 
agreed to that said, because we are ne-
gotiating right now and the one thing 
in the CARES Act that expires at the 
end of this month is unemployment in-
surance, let’s extend it—at the current 
level. 
It is right now. Let’s extend it so the 
people who are relying on it can have 
something for the next week while we 
continue to negotiate and debate. That 
is very reasonable. That happens all 
the time here. 
The Senate minority leader came 
down, and he blocked it. He blocked it. 
If you are not going to be receiving a 
check next week, there is one person 
you can blame. What did he say when 
he blocked it? Remarkably, he said, in 
essence, if the other side doesn’t accept 
the entire Heroes Act—that bill that I 
just talked about that attacks Alaska 
Natives—then I am going to block ev-
erything. That is what happened on the 
Senate floor like an hour ago. 
No, that is not working in good faith. 
I am sure that the minority leader be-
lieves that the national media will not 
blame him. He is probably right, but it 
should. But it should. 
If you are one of the millions of 
Americans who are worried about this 
issue because you are out of work, we 
just put forward a very simple com-
promise: As we continue to negotiate, 
we will continue the unemployment 
levels paid to Americans that were in 
the CARES Act for another week, at 
the levels that currently exist. 
It was blocked by the Senate minor-
ity leader, without a real explanation, 
essentially saying take our NANCY 
PELOSI $3.5—actually, $4 trillion bill or 
nothing. I sure hope the media reports 
on what just happened. I don’t have 
faith that they will, but that is exactly 
what happened. 
We are facing a national crisis. We 
don’t always come together in imme-
diate agreement on everything, but 
what we have seen in the last several 
months is that we have come together 
in the Congress. These bills haven’t 
been perfect. The bills I just de-
scribed—the HEALS or Heroes—aren’t 
perfect, but what they require is com-
promise and working together. 
When you can’t get to a spot in a cer-
tain amount of time, you look at areas 
where, OK, this is going to expire right 
now—that is pretty important—so let’s 
extend it for a week or two. That hap-
pens all the time here. People do it in 
good faith. 
What we just saw was bad faith. What 
we just saw, in my view, was the Sen-
ate minority leader taking hostage this 
issue, hoping that his friends in the na-
tional media will somehow blame us. I 
think, if you are telling the truth and 
you just watched what happened on the 
Senate floor, that is going to be hard 
to do. My view is we have to come to-
gether in good faith to help our fellow 
Americans, my fellow Alaskans, many 
of whom are still really, really hurting. 
We have a Senator from Arizona who 
tried to do that just an hour ago on the 
floor, and it was rejected. 
There are going to be a lot of people 
next week who are going to be hurting 
because of this, and I hope they accu-
rately report why they are hurting, 
what just happened, and that is not the 
spirit of compromise that we are going 
to need to get through this pandemic. 
I yield the floor.

TRIBUTE TO RICHARD S. 
TAMBURINI 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I 
recognize Chief Richard S. Tamburini 
for his longstanding service and dedica-
tion to Rhode Island and our Nation. 
Chief Tamburini has serviced as chief 
of police for the town of Johnston for 
the past 25 years and will retire at the 
end of next month. 
Chief 
Tamburini’s 
public 
service 
began almost 60 years ago when he 
served with the U.S. Army’s 72nd Sig-
nal Battalion. While with the Army, he 
advanced to the rank of specialist 4th 
class. After leaving the military, Chief 
Tamburini returned home to Provi-
dence’s Federal Hill neighborhood and 
joined the Providence Police Depart-
ment—again committing himself to 
serving and protecting others. He spent 
his first 29 years in law enforcement 
there, rising to deputy chief of police 
and earning degrees from then-Bryant 
College and then-Roger Williams Col-
lege while with the department. After 
he ascended to the rank of lieutenant, 
Chief Tamburini gained distinction in 
combating organized crime, gambling, 
and narcotics trafficking. His integrity 
and skill led him to become the first 
sworn police officer outside of the 
Rhode Island State Police to be grant-
ed authorization to conduct court-or-
dered wiretapping in Rhode Island. 
In 1995, Chief Tamburini assumed his 
current role in Johnston, where he has 
become both the town and the State’s 
longest serving chief of police. In his 25 
years leading the Johnston Police De-
partment, he has continued to serve as 
a role model for his fellow officers and 
has worked to strengthen the commu-
nity’s relationship with his depart-
ment. His many accomplishments in-
clude instituting several popular pro-
grams, such as Walk with Cops to keep 
the department connected with John-
ston’s senior citizens, the Johnston Po-
lice Explorers program to help train 
the next generation of police officers, 
and 
the 
Johnston 
Citizens’ 
Police 
Academy to give local residents a bet-
ter understanding of the day-to-day op-
erations of the police force. 
Chief Tamburini, who is a member of 
the Rhode Island Criminal Justice Hall 
of Fame, has called his time in law en-
forcement his ‘‘life’s work.’’ Time and 
time again, he has been recognized for 
his innovative and outstanding police 
work, earning recognition from the 
Rhode Island Governor’s Office, the 
Rhode Island General Assembly, and 
the throated U.S. Attorney General’s 
Office—to name a few. I think we can 
all agree it has been work well done. I 
join my colleague, Senator WHITE-
HOUSE, in expressing my heartfelt grat-
itude for Chief Tamburini’s years of ex-
emplary dedication and service to 
Johnston, Providence, and our entire 
country. I wish Chief Tamburini, his 
wife Marie, his children and his grand-
children, the very best in the years to 
come. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I 
join my senior colleague to rise today 
in acknowledgement of the ending of 
an era in Rhode Island with the retire-
ment of Johnston Police Chief Richard 
Tamburini next month. I want to 
thank Chief Tamburini for his five dec-
ades of service and community leader-
ship. Prior to beginning a career in law 
enforcement, Chief Tamburini served 
honorably in the U.S. Army’s 72nd Sig-
nal Battalion. The chief worked his 
way up the ranks of the Providence Po-
lice Department over nearly three dec-
ades, including a stint as part of a leg-
endary organized crime investigative 
team along with then-detective and fu-
ture 
fellow 
chief, 
Vincent 
Vespia. 
Tamburini would eventually become 
deputy chief of police in Providence 
prior to his retirement from the De-
partment. 
Chief Tamburini has led the John-
ston Police Department for 25 years. 
His tenure as chief has been marked by 
an increase in community engagement 
through bicycle patrols, and through 
the Walk With Cops and Johnston Po-
lice Explorers programs. The chief’s 
leadership and community-minded ef-
forts have earned him a place in the

prestigious Rhode Island Criminal Jus-
tice Hall of Fame. 
As Chief Tamburini told the John-
ston Sunrise last year, trust between a 
police department and the community 
it serves is the key to effective law en-
forcement. He said at the time: 
I really want to focus on that [trust], be-
cause as chief of police it’s important to me 
that no matter what we do with the commu-
nity, [we need] a strong relationship and a 
level of trust. I think that carries through to 
the rest the department, so they can be as-
sured of that. 
Today, we pay tribute to a great 
Rhode Islander, my friend, Chief Rich-
ard Tamburini. I am grateful for his 
contributions to Rhode Island and wish 
him many years of well-deserved rest 
and relaxation with his family and 
friends. Godspeed.

TRIBUTE TO ROBERT R. HOOD 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, on be-
half of myself and Senator REED, as the 
chair and ranking member of the Sen-
ate Armed Services Committee, it is 
our honor to pay tribute to a great 
leader and senior executive of the De-
partment of Defense, Mr. Robert R. 
Hood. 
Mr. Hood has served as the Assistant 
Secretary of Defense for Legislative 
Affairs from August 2017 to July 2020. 
As he prepares to leave this position to 
enter into the private sector, we com-
mend him for his sound leadership, ad-
vice, and professional judgement on nu-
merous critical issues of enduring im-
portance to the Department of Defense, 
Congress, and this Nation. 
Mr. Hood has served our Nation for 
more than 18 years in various capac-
ities within the Federal Government. 
His service to our Nation includes roles 
as a professional staff member for the 
House Committee on Science, as well 
as senior legislative assistant, senior 
policy advisor, and assistant to the 
Speaker of the House of Representa-
tives for policy. Mr. Hood also served 5 
years as the Director of Congressional 
Affairs for the National Nuclear Secu-
rity Administration, a semi-autono-
mous agency within the Department of 
Energy. 
Mr. Hood previously served in the 
White House as special assistant to 
President George W. Bush in the Office 
of Legislative Affairs, overseeing co-
ordination with the Senate, including 
the Armed Services, Homeland Secu-
rity, Foreign Relations and Intel-
ligence Committees. Before working on 
the White House staff, Mr. Hood served 
at the Pentagon as the Principal Dep-
uty Assistant Secretary of Defense for 
Legislative Affairs, where he was re-
sponsible for promoting the policies, 
strategies, and budget of the Depart-
ment of Defense to the U.S. Congress. 
Mr. Hood also served as the Deputy 
Under Secretary of Defense, Comp-
troller, for Budget and Appropriations 
Affairs, working closely with the Ap-
propriations Committees of the Con-
gress. 
For the past 3 years as the Assistant 
Secretary of Defense for Legislative 
Affairs, Mr. Hood deftly managed and 
guided the Department’s congressional 
relations, ensuring the preparation of 
key senior leaders for Senate confirma-
tions, 
congressional 
hearings, 
and 
briefings, while simultaneously devel-
oping and leading a skilled and focused 
legislative affairs team. His leadership, 
knowledge, and personal efforts greatly 
contributed to one of the most success-
ful legislative years in Department his-
tory, culminating with the establish-
ment of the U.S. Space Force, which 
was signed into law on December 20, 
2019 as part of the fiscal year 2020 
NDAA. 
Mr. Hood provided significant con-
tributions and leadership during the 
development and execution of the Sec-
retary of Defense’s Congressional En-
gagement Strategy, ensuring an inte-
grated legislative program directly 
aligned with the National Defense 
Strategy. This comprehensive plan sup-
ported the Department’s priorities, 
aligned legislative objectives to the 
congressional calendar, and guided the 
execution of over 4,000 congressional 
engagements within the Office of the 
Secretary of Defense and oversight and 
alignment of over 10,000 congressional 
engagements across the Department 
during his 3-year tenure. The strategic 
execution of these engagements di-
rectly led to the attainment of Depart-
ment of Defense legislative priorities 
and resourcing at historic levels in the 
fiscal years 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 Na-
tional 
Defense 
Authorization 
Acts, 
NDAAs, appropriations bills. 
On behalf of the Senate, we thank 
Robert, his wife Jennifer, and his chil-
dren: 
Evan, 
Caroline, 
Megan, 
and 
Emma, for their continued commit-
ment, sacrifice and contribution to this 
great Nation. We join our colleagues in 
wishing him future success as he tran-
sitions into the private sector.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO JUDGE CHARLES D. 
SUSANO, JR 
∑ Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, 
today I honor one of my constituents, 
Judge Charles D. Susano Jr., who re-
tired in April after 25 years of dedi-
cated service to the State of Tennessee. 
Judge Susano is the state’s longest 
serving state appellate judge and has 
led a remarkable life of public service 
and thoughtful jurisprudence. 
Judge Susano is a native and lifelong 
Knoxvillian. Born in 1936, he attended 
Knoxville Catholic High School before 
going to the University of Notre Dame 
where he graduated magna cum laude. 
Following an honorable discharge from 
the U.S. Army, Judge Susano returned 
to his Tennessee roots to attend the 
University of Tennessee Law School, 
where he was a member of the Ten-
nessee Law Review and the Order of 
the Coif. 
Judge Susano began his legal career 
clerking for Chief Justice Hamilton 
Burnett in the inaugural class of clerks 
to the Tennessee Supreme Court. He 
practiced law in Knoxville for 30 years, 
while also giving back to the commu-
nity as a member of the advisory com-
mission to the Tennessee Supreme 
Court on Civil Rules, as well as board 
member of several local nonprofits. 
In 
1994, 
Governor 
Ned 
Ray 
McWherter appointed Judge Susano to 
serve as a judge for the Tennessee 
Court of Appeals, and he won the seat 
later that same year. Judge Susano 
would go on to win statewide reelec-
tion in 1998, 2006, and 2014, and he 
served as the presiding judge of the 
Court of Appeals from 2012–2014. During 
his time on the court, he has authored 
over 1,000 legal opinions and received 
numerous awards including: the Jus-
tice Frank F. Drowota III Outstanding 
Judicial Service Award in 2017; Appel-
late Judge of the Year from the Amer-
ican Board of Trial Advocates, Ten-
nessee Chapter in 2003; and the Courage 
in the Face of Adversity Award from 
the Knoxville Bar Association in 2004. 
I want to thank Judge Susano for his 
many years of service to Tennessee. 
The end of his long tenure in the Ten-
nessee judiciary will certainly be felt 
by many in the State. I wish him, his 
wife, and their children all the best as 
they begin this new chapter in their 
lives.∑

TRIBUTE TO KEITH SALTHE 
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this 
week I have the honor of recognizing 
Roundup Fire Chief Keith Salthe of 
Musselshell County for his bravery and 
decisive action that stopped the spread 
of a fire in downtown Roundup. 
On the morning of May 20, 2020, Fire 
Chief Salthe and his team of 20 volun-
teer firefighters, as well as firefighters 
from Hawk Creek, Dean Creek, and the 
Montana Department of Natural Re-
sources and Conservation, responded to 
a fire that broke out at the Vintage 
Cafe´ in Roundup. 
Five hours after the fire ignited, 
Salthe and his team were forced to 
knock down the building to ensure that 
the fire didn’t spread to the remaining 
businesses on the block. 
For his decisive action, Musselshell 
County sheriff called Chief Salthe the 
real hero of the day and said that if it 
weren’t for Chief Salthe and his team, 
the entire block would have been lost. 
It is my distinct honor to recognize 
Fire Chief Salthe today. His leadership 
during this fire emergency stopped the 
spread of the fire towards other busi-
nesses, saving lives and preventing 
what could have been a tragedy for the 
community of Roundup. Roundup is 
fortunate to have brave men like Keith 
Salthe and his team of volunteer fire-
fighters who were ready to jump into 
harm’s way at a moment’s notice for 
the safety of their fellow Montanans.∑

TRIBUTE TO TERRY TOBINESS 
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, it is my 
honor to recognize Terry Tobiness for 
her 50 years of dedication to her coun-
try, her patients, and her fellow vet-
erans. 
A graduate of the Helena College of 
Technology, Terry’s first job out of col-
lege was at St. John’s Hospital in Hel-
ena. 
From then on, Terry went on to work 
at Crest Nursing Home in Butte, hold-
ing various roles over 18 years as a 
medical nurse, physical therapy aide, 
and assistant director of nursing and 
social services representative. 
In 1980, Terry continued her service 
and joined the Army Reserves, deploy-
ing to the United Arab Emirates during 
the first gulf war as part of Operation 
Desert Storm in the 1990s. 
As a fellow veteran herself and a 
dedicated health care hero, Terry spent 
the last 10 years of her nursing career 
in Great Falls, providing care at the 
Great Falls VA clinic in the Neurology 
and Pain Department as a nurse. 
Terry’s commitment to helping oth-
ers is exemplary of the rich legacy of 
service we have in Montana. I know 
that all of Terry’s patients over the 
years are thankful for her lifetime of 
service to the community, the State of 
Montana, and our country.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO DAVE LILLEHAUG 
∑ Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, 
today I rise to honor my dear friend, 
Minnesota Supreme Court Justice Dave 
Lillehaug, on a distinguished career 
and well-deserved retirement. 
I have been lucky to call Dave a 
friend for 35 years and have seen him 
not just as a brilliant lawyer but a 
fearsome litigator, a tireless advocate 
in the pursuit of justice, and an excel-
lent judge. 
In fact, the same skills that led him 
to endlessly prepare for his date with 
his future wife Winifred somehow also 
landed him on the Minnesota Supreme 
Court. 
Here is the story. 
Winifred told me that she was more 
than a little bit unnerved during her 
first date with Dave—a lunch in Wash-
ington after they met when she was 
selling condos and he was buying one. 
At lunch, Winifred realized just how 
much Dave already knew about her. 
She was from Pittsburgh, and he had 
read up on every detail about the town, 
including the latest steel plant closing. 
In those pre-Google days, 24 hours after 
meeting her, he had somehow re-
searched every detail about her life so 
he could be informed and impressive on 
the first date. 
She had already been thoroughly 
‘‘vetted,’’ as if she herself was being 
considered for a national office. 
She was a little concerned, so on the 
next date, she brought a friend who 
happened to work for the Chamber of 
Commerce—just so she could get a sec-
ond opinion. 
Unfazed, wanting to impress her 
friend, Dave researched and memorized 
the entire legislative agenda for the 
U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 
Dave may have overdone it, and 
Winifred came away from the lunch 
convinced that he was interested in her 
friend and not her. Somehow, Dave 
salvaged it. Winifred and Dave have 
been happily married for 38 years. 
Those same skills Dave honed when 
he dated Winifred served him very well 
on the bench. 
I have so many fond memories of 
Dave, who impressed not just me but 
my family as well. 
On the day Paul Wellstone an-
nounced he was recommending Dave 
for U.S. attorney, my mom sent the ar-
ticle to me on my honeymoon with the 
words ‘‘how exciting is this!’’ In addi-
tion to the usual newlywed photos, 
that article made it into my official 
honeymoon scrapbook. 
Dave played a very important role in 
another seminal moment in my life as 
well. The night I was elected Hennepin 
County attorney, it was Dave counting 
the votes late into the night. It was 
close. Everyone went home—except 
Dave. And at 5:00 a.m. the next morn-
ing, Dave called to tell me I had offi-
cially won. 
I am very grateful for Dave’s friend-
ship, his wisdom, and his sound advice 
and will be forever in awe of his bril-
liant career—as I know Paul Wellstone 
would have been. 
Congratulations to Dave on his re-
tirement.∑

TRIBUTE TO MAJOR GENERAL JON 
JENSEN 
∑ Ms. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize the career of Min-
nesota Adjutant General Jon Jensen 
and to congratulate him on the next 
step in his career. On Friday, Major 
General Jensen will be promoted to 
lieutenant general and become our Na-
tion’s next Director of the Army Na-
tional Guard. In this position he will 
oversee the national activities of the 
Army National Guard and work to en-
sure the Army Guard remains one of 
our finest public institutions. 
General Jensen joined the Iowa Na-
tional Guard’s 168th Infantry Regiment 
in 1989 before later transferring to the 
Minnesota National Guard in 2002. 
Through hard work and dedication, he 
rose to become the Minnesota National 
Guard’s 31st Adjutant General in No-
vember, 2017. In this role, General Jen-
sen has served as the head of Min-
nesota’s Army and Air National Guard, 
where he has demonstrated the highest 
levels of duty, honor, and service. 
I have had the pleasure of working 
with General Jensen during my time in 
office at the State and Federal levels. 
He is a proven leader who has seen the 
Minnesota 
Guard 
through 
deploy-
ments, natural disasters, and preparing 
the Minnesota Guard to meet future 
challenges. We worked closely to pre-
serve the National Guard’s access to 
the Readiness and Environment Pro-
tection Initiative, REPI, a program 
which both ensures the Guard’s ability 
to carry out critical training and also 
works to conserve the natural habitat 
surrounding military bases. General 
Jensen has been a strong advocate for 
this program and worked with my of-
fice to ensure National Guard installa-
tions across the Nation have continued 
access to the REPI Program. This is 
just one example that demonstrates 
General Jensen’s dedication to service 
which 
makes 
him 
an 
outstanding 
choice to be the next Director of the 
Army National Guard. 
In addition to the outstanding job 
General Jensen has done running the 
Minnesota National Guard, he is also 
inspiring, intelligent, and optimistic— 
all important qualities in a strong 
leader and qualities that have helped 
General Jensen make outstanding con-
tributions throughout his more than 30 
years of service. Given his strong quali-
fications, leadership qualities, and ex-
tensive experience, I cannot think of a 
better candidate to become our Na-
tion’s next Director of the Army Na-
tional Guard. 
On behalf of myself and all Minneso-
tans, thank you for your dedicated 
service to Minnesota and our Nation. I 
know you will excel in your new role, 
and I look forward to continuing to 
work with you for many years to 
come.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTION 
By Mr. ALEXANDER: 
S. 4375. A bill to amend title XVIII of 
the Social Security Act to make per-
manent certain telehealth flexibilities 
under the Medicare program related to 
the COVID–19 public health emergency; 
to the Committee on Finance. 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I 
want to speak for a few minutes about 
the changes to telehealth during the 
last five months—one of the most dra-
matic developments in the delivery of 
medical services ever—and why we in 
Congress should make many of those 
changes permanent. 
I recently heard from a psychiatric 
nurse practitioner in Nashville who has 
been 
seeing 
patients 
during 
the 
COVID–19 pandemic using telehealth— 
which means she uses the Internet to 
see her patients over video or she calls 
them on the telephone. 
She told me about one of her elderly 
patients who, before the COVID–19 pan-
demic, got to her appointments by 
walking from her high-rise apartment 
to Gallatin Road, catching a bus, and 
then walking from the bus stop to the 
clinic. 
When the patient got to the clinic, 
she had to wait for her appointment. 
Then, when the appointment was over, 
she had to do all of these steps in re-
verse to get back home. 
Because of telehealth, this nurse said 
that her patient was in tears out of ap-
preciation that she could now have ap-
pointments from her own home. She 
had access to health care without the 
long journey, and she could still re-
ceive her medications. 
The nurse said that several of her 
other elderly patients have had similar 
experiences and have asked if they 
could continue to have access to tele-
health in the future, even after the 
pandemic. 
Because of COVID–19, the health care 
sector and federal and state govern-
ments have been forced to cram 10 
years’ worth of telehealth experience 
into almost 5 months. In 2016, there 
were almost 884 million visits nation-
wide between patients and physicians, 
according to the Center for Disease 
Control and Prevention. Almost all of 
them were in person—online or remote 
visits were rare. 
During the last four months, the 
number of online or remote visits vir-
tually exploded. According to Vander-
bilt University Medical Center, Van-
derbilt went from 10 telehealth visits a

July 30, 2020 
day before the pandemic to more than 
2,000 telehealth visits a day across spe-
cialties, including primary care, pedi-
atrics, and behavioral health. In less 
than 3 months, Vanderbilt has provided 
more than 100,000 telehealth visits. 
Before 
COVID–19, 
approximately 
13,000 Americans enrolled in the tradi-
tional Medicare program received tele-
health services in an average week. In 
the last week of April, nearly 1.7 mil-
lion Americans enrolled in traditional 
Medicare received telehealth services. 
In total, over 9 million Americans in 
traditional Medicare received a tele-
health service between mid-March and 
mid-June. 
The Nashville Journal reports that 
Tennessee’s Centerstone, which pro-
vides treatment for mental health and 
substance use disorders, says it is pro-
viding nearly 2,500 telehealth visits per 
day and 30 percent more of patients are 
keeping their appointments, which is 
key to treating these disorders. Ac-
cording to Bob Vero, Centerstone’s 
CEO, ‘‘We’ve taken away a lot of the 
reasons people don’t follow through 
with their care.’’ 
Tim Adams, the CEO of Ascension 
Saint Thomas Health, which has 9 hos-
pitals in Middle Tennessee and employs 
over 800 physicians, told me that he 
predicts that 15–20 percent of the sys-
tem’s visits between patients and phy-
sicians will be conducted through tele-
health in the future. 
In that 15 to 20 percent holds true 
across the Nation because of telehealth 
expansion during COVID–19—it would 
produce a massive change in our health 
care system. 
Congress and the administration re-
acted to the pandemic by creating a 
regulatory environment that made the 
current telehealth boom possible by al-
lowing: in-home virtual visits; tele-
health for patients in rural areas at 
rural health clinics; telehealth from 
physical therapists, speech language 
pathologists and other providers; tele-
health for many more services includ-
ing emergency department visits; and 
allowing Medicare hospice and home 
dialysis patients to start their care 
with a virtual visit. 
Now Congress is beginning to build 
on what we’ve learned and make those 
changes permanent. Here are three 
steps Congress should take now, as a 
part of the COVID–19 legislation that 
we are working on: 
Step One is to pass the COVID–19 
HEALS Act legislation that was intro-
duced Monday, which: 
Provides telehealth access to part- 
time and hourly employees; extends 
the administration’s telehealth flexi-
bilities and waivers through the end of 
the 
Public 
Health 
Emergency, 
or 
through 2021; and allows Rural Health 
Clinics and Federally Qualified Health 
Centers to continue to provide tele-
health to Medicare beneficiaries for 5 
years beyond the public health emer-
gency. 
Step Two is to pass the CONNECT for 
Health Act. That legislation explores 
ways to expand telehealth services and 
begins to permanently remove some of 
the restrictions on where a patient 
needs to be for telehealth access. The 
bill is already supported by a broad co-
alition in the Senate and the House. 
Here in the Senate, the CONNECT for 
Health Act has been led by Senators 
ROGER WICKER (R–MS), BRIAN SCHATZ 
(D–HI), CINDY HYDE-SMITH (R–MS), BEN 
CARDIN (D–MD), JOHN THUNE (R–SD), 
and MARK WARNER (D–VA)—and today 
the bill has 38 cosponsors in the Sen-
ate. 
This bill was first introduced in 2016 
and these senators deserve great credit 
for seeing the need to expand perma-
nently telehealth services even before 
the pandemic forced a massive change 
in how Americans receive health care 
from their doctors. 
Step Three would be to pass the bill 
I’m introducing today which would go 
further than either of those first two 
steps and would make permanent in- 
home visits and rural telehealth ac-
cess. The bill would also give the Sec-
retary authority to make permanent 
other changes that the Administration 
has made over the last few months. 
Here’s what the bill being introduced 
today does: 
Ensures that patients can access 
telehealth anywhere by permanently 
removing Medicare’s so-called ‘‘geo-
graphic and originating site’’ restric-
tions, which required both that the pa-
tient live in a rural area and use tele-
health at a doctor’s office or clinic. 
Congress temporarily ended these re-
strictions in the Coronavirus Prepared-
ness and Response Supplemental Ap-
propriations Act that was signed into 
law on March 6, allowing millions of 
Americans to talk with their doctor 
virtually during the pandemic. 
Making this change permanent will 
ensure Medicare beneficiaries do not 
lose that ability when the pandemic 
ends. 
Protects access to telehealth for pa-
tients in rural areas. The bill makes 
permanent a change allowing Medicare 
beneficiaries 
to 
continue 
receiving 
telehealth services from Rural Health 
Clinics or Federally Qualified Health 
Centers. 
Telehealth access is especially im-
portant for patients in rural and other 
medically underserved areas because 
they no longer have to travel to see 
their primary care doctor. 
Those are two changes that this bill 
would make permanent. 
Then it would give the Secretary of 
Health and Human Services new au-
thorities to do these three things: 
Help patients continue to access tele-
health from physical therapists, speech 
language 
pathologists, 
and 
other 
health care providers. 
The bill gives authority to the Sec-
retary of Health and Human Services 
to allow Medicare to permanently ex-
pand the types of health care providers 
that can offer telehealth services. 
Before COVID–19, only doctors, nurse 
practitioners, physician assistants, and 
certain other practitioners could de-
liver telehealth services. 
Today a much wider range of health 
practitioners are providing telehealth 
services. 
Help give Medicare recipients many 
more telehealth services. 
The bill gives authority to the HHS 
Secretary to give Medicare the flexi-
bility to reimburse for more telehealth 
services. 
During the pandemic, Medicare has 
been reimbursing for 135 telehealth 
services, more than doubling the num-
ber of telehealth services covered be-
fore COVID–19. Examples include emer-
gency department visits, home visits, 
and physical, occupational and speech 
therapy services. Help Medicare hos-
pice and home dialysis patients begin 
receiving care through a telehealth ap-
pointment. 
Medicare requires a face-to-face visit 
when a patient begins hospice and 
home dialysis care, and this change 
would provide authority to the HHS 
Secretary to allow a telehealth visit to 
fulfill the requirement for an in-person 
visit. This will provide flexibility to 
improve access for these patients and 
account for individual circumstances. 
This legislation is the result of the 
Senate Health, Education, Labor and 
Pensions Committee hearing on June 
17, during which senators asked health 
care experts about the 31 temporary 
Federal policy changes made in re-
sponse to the COVID–19 pandemic. 
The legislation I am introducing 
today incorporates the recommenda-
tions of those experts to make perma-
nent 5 of the most important changes— 
and helps to ensure that patients do 
not lose the benefits that they have 
gained from using telehealth during 
the COVID–19 pandemic. 
This bill would make permanent the 
telehealth changes in the legislation 
introduced Monday as well as the CON-
NECT for Health Act. The best result 
for the American people would be for 
Congress to approve all three steps— 
the changes in the HEALS Act, the 
CONNECT for Health Act, and my leg-
islation—in the next COVID–19 package 
so we don’t miss the opportunity to 
support and encourage one of the most 
important changes in the delivery of 
medical services ever. 
By Mr. KAINE: 
S. 4390. A bill to establish a grant 
program to support schools of medicine 
and schools of osteopathic medicine in 
underserved areas; to the Committee 
on Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, commu-
nities of color and those living in rural 
and underserved area face significant 
barriers to healthcare, including physi-
cian shortages. Unfortunately, in many 
communities of color and rural areas, 
there are few pathways to enter the 
medical profession. Recent data shows 
that while medical school enrollment

is up by 30 percent, the number of stu-
dents from rural areas entering med-
ical school declined by 28 percent be-
tween 2002 and 2017, with only 4.3 per-
cent of all incoming medical students 
coming from rural areas in 2017. Simi-
larly, Black, Hispanic/Latino, and Na-
tive American students face several 
barriers to matriculate and graduate 
from medical school. This exacerbates 
the barriers to care and the disparities 
in health outcomes that these commu-
nities experience. It is critical that we 
expand the diversity of our physician 
workforce to tackle the rampant dis-
parities and systemic biases within our 
healthcare system. 
This is why I am introducing the Ex-
panding Medical Education Act, which 
aims to tackle the lack of representa-
tion of rural students, underserved stu-
dents, and students of color in the phy-
sician pipeline by encouraging the re-
cruitment, enrollment, and retention 
of students from disadvantaged back-
grounds. The bill would provide grants 
through the Health Resources and 
Services Administration, HRSA to col-
leges and universities to establish or 
expand allopathic or osteopathic med-
ical schools in underserved areas or at 
minority-serving institutions, includ-
ing historically Black colleges and uni-
versities, HBCU. These grants can be 
used for planning and construction of a 
medical school in an area in which no 
other school is based; hiring diverse 
faculty and staff; recruitment, enroll-
ment, and retention of students; and 
other purposes to ensure increased rep-
resentation of rural students, under-
served students, and students of color 
in our physician workforce. 
Our rural communities and commu-
nities of color face significant chal-
lenges in access to healthcare. It is 
time our physician workforce reflected 
these communities. We need to diver-
sify our physician pipeline and change 
the disparity in representation, and 
this bill will help get us there. I hope 
the 
Senate 
passes 
this 
legislation 
quickly to expand the diversity of the 
medical profession and to take a step 
towards improved access to care for 
our marginalized communities.

AFFIRMING 
THE 
STRATEGIC 
PARTNERSHIP 
BETWEEN 
THE 
UNITED STATES AND MONGOLIA 
AND RECOGNIZING THE 30TH AN-
NIVERSARY OF DEMOCRACY IN 
MONGOLIA 
Mr. SULLIVAN (for himself and Mr. 
CARDIN) submitted the following reso-
lution; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 665 
Whereas the United States and Mongolia 
established diplomatic relations in January 
1987, and since that time the relationship has 
grown stronger based on shared strategic in-
terests, security cooperation, democratic 
values, good governance, and respect for 
human rights; 
Whereas, since its peaceful democratic rev-
olution in 1989, through a series of initia-
tives, Mongolia has charted a successful path 
to multiparty democracy and a free market 
economy; 
Whereas, in 1990, the Government of Mon-
golia declared an end to a one-party, author-
itarian, political system and adopted demo-
cratic and free market reforms; 
Whereas, in 1992, Mongolia adopted a con-
stitution establishing a parliamentary de-
mocracy, becoming the first country in Asia 
to transition from communism to democ-
racy; 
Whereas Mongolia has shown its commit-
ment to a ‘‘third neighbor’’ relationship with 
the United States by sending troops to sup-
port United States operations in Iraq from 
2003 through 2008 and Afghanistan since 2009, 
and Mongolia has a strong record of troop 
contributions to international peacekeeping 
missions; 
Whereas 
successive 
Mongolian 
govern-
ments have taken notable steps to strength-
en civil society, battle corruption, and spur 
economic development; 
Whereas the Parliament of Mongolia, the 
State Great Khural, has engaged with Con-
gress, including through the House Democ-
racy Partnership, thereby promoting respon-
sive and effective governance through peer- 
to-peer cooperation; 
Whereas Mongolia began as a partner to 
the Organization for Security and Co-oper-
ation in Europe (OSCE) in 2004, graduated to 
become a participating state in 2012, and par-
ticipates actively in the work of the OSCE 
for stability, peace, and democracy; 
Whereas Mongolia has regularly invited 
the OSCE and other organizations to send 
monitoring teams for its presidential and 
parliamentary elections; 
Whereas Mongolia has also been an active 
member of the Community of Democracies 
(CoD), a global coalition of states that sup-
port adherence to common democratic val-
ues and standards, and Mongolia has not 
only remained active since the founding of 
the CoD in 2000, but successfully chaired the 
CoD from 2011 through 2013; 
Whereas, in addition to supporting the 
OSCE and CoD, Mongolia supports demo-
cratic initiatives while participating in a 
wide range of other global institutions; 
Whereas, most recently, on June 24, 2020, 
Mongolia successfully organized parliamen-
tary elections, strengthening its commit-
ment to democracy and the rule of law; 
Whereas the success of Mongolia as a de-
mocracy and its strategic location, sov-
ereignty, territorial integrity, and ability to 
pursue an independent foreign policy are 
highly relevant to the national security of 
the United States; 
Whereas the United States has provided 
support to Mongolia through the Millennium 
Challenge Corporation through an initial 
compact signed in 2007 designed to increase 
economic growth and reduce poverty and a 
second compact signed in 2018 involving in-
vestments in water infrastructure, including 
supply and wastewater recycling, as well as 
water sector sustainability; 
Whereas, on September 20, 2018, the United 
States and Mongolia signed a joint state-
ment and the Roadmap for Expanded Eco-
nomic Partnership, outlining the intent to 
deepen the bilateral commercial relationship 
through full implementation of the obliga-
tions under the Agreement on Transparency 
in Matters Related to International Trade 
and Investment between the United States of 
America and Mongolia, signed at New York 
September 24, 2013 (in this preamble referred 
to as the ‘‘United States-Mongolia Trans-
parency Agreement’’), and to collaborate in 
supporting Mongolian small- and medium- 
sized enterprises through various programs 
and projects; 
Whereas, according to the Bureau of the 
Census, trade between the United States and 
Mongolia is modest but growing, with total 
trade in 2019 between the two countries of 
approximately 
$217,500,000, 
including 
$192,700,000 in United States exports to Mon-
golia and $24,800,000 in United States imports 
from Mongolia; 
Whereas Mongolia is a beneficiary country 
under the Generalized System of Preferences 
program, but its use of the program remains 
low, as, in 2018, only $3,300,000 of exports 
from Mongolia to the United States were 
under the program; and

(6) to strengthen border security, prevent 
illegal transshipment and trafficking, ex-
pand cooperation on civil aviation safety and 
oversight, and efficiently facilitate legiti-

(8) to continue to develop an environment 
in which civil society, social media, and a 
free and independent media can flourish; and 
(9) to maintain high-level official dia-
logues, encourage bilateral exchanges at all 
levels of government, and further develop 
people-to-people exchanges to deepen en-
gagement on issues of mutual interest and 
concern: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate—

tionship between the United States and Mon-
golia and remains committed to advancing 
this Strategic Partnership in the future; 
(2) emphasizes the importance of free and 
fair elections in Mongolia;

tions that promote democratic values, which 
reinforces the commitment of the people and 
the Government of Mongolia to those values 
and standards; 
(4) encourages the United States Govern-
ment to help Mongolia use its benefits under 
the Generalized System of Preferences pro-
gram and other relevant programs to in-
crease trade between the United States and 
Mongolia; 
(5) urges the United States International 
Development Finance Corporation to expand 
activities in Mongolia to support economic 
development, diversification of the economy

OF 
THE 
1890 
LAND-GRANT 
EDU-
CATIONAL INSTITUTIONS 
Mr. BOOZMAN (for himself, Mr. 
JONES, Mr. TILLIS, Mr. MANCHIN, Mr. 
PERDUE, Mr. WARNER, Mr. KAINE, Mr. 
ROBERTS, Mr. BLUNT, Mr. PORTMAN, Mr. 
CARDIN, Mrs. LOEFFLER, Mr. VAN HOL-
LEN, and Mr. WICKER) submitted the 
following concurrent resolution; which 
was referred to the Committee on Agri-
culture, Nutrition, and Forestry: 
S. CON. RES. 42 
Whereas the Act of August 30, 1890 (7 U.S.C. 
321 et seq.), popularly known as the ‘‘Second 
Morrill Act’’, led to the creation of 19 his-
torically Black Federal land-grant edu-
cational institutions; 
Whereas the 19 historically Black 1890 
land-grant educational institutions are iden-
tified as Lincoln University, Alcorn State 
University, the University of Arkansas at 
Pine Bluff, Alabama A&M University, Prai-
rie View A&M University, Southern Univer-
sity, Virginia State University, Kentucky 
State University, the University of Maryland 
Eastern Shore, Florida A&M University, 
Delaware State University, North Carolina 
A&T State University, Fort Valley State 
University, South Carolina State University, 
Langston University, Tennessee State Uni-
versity, Tuskegee University, Central State 
University, and West Virginia State Univer-
sity; 
Whereas the Act of May 8, 1914 (7 U.S.C. 
341), popularly known as the ‘‘Smith-Lever 
Act’’, provided for the establishment of the 
Cooperative Extension Service within the 
Department of Agriculture for the dissemi-
nation, through Federal land-grant edu-
cational institutions, of information per-
taining to agriculture and home economics; 
Whereas, since the 125th Anniversary of 
the 19 historically Black 1890 land-grant edu-
cational institutions in 2015, Congress passed 
the 2018 Farm Bill which included new Fed-
eral investments, such as— 
(1) the program providing scholarships for 
students at 1890 land-grant educational insti-
tutions under section 1446 of the National 
Agricultural 
Research, 
Extension, 
and 
Teaching Policy Act of 1977 (7 U.S.C. 322a); 
and 
(2) the recognition of at least 3 Centers of 
Excellence at 1890 land-grant educational in-
stitutions under section 1673(d) of the Food, 
Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 
1990 (7 U.S.C. 5926(d)); and 
Whereas appropriate recognition should be 
given to the significant contributions made 
by the 19 historically Black 1890 land-grant 
educational institutions to the heritage, edu-
cational development, advancement, and ag-
ricultural strength of the United States: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate (the House of Rep-
resentatives concurring), That it is the sense 
of Congress that— 
(1) the 130th anniversary of the 1890 Land- 
Grant Educational Institutions should be ob-
served; 
(2) such a day should be observed with ap-
propriate ceremonies and activities to recog-
nize the collective contributions that these 
19 historically Black Federal land-grant edu-
cational institutions have made to the 
United States; 
(3) the Second Morrill Act and the Smith- 
Lever Act have helped the United States de-
velop agricultural leaders; and 
(4) the Department of Agriculture and the 
National Institute of Food and Agriculture 
should remain committed to supporting the 
goals of the Second Morrill Act and the 
Smith-Lever Act.

CENTENNIAL OF AMERICAN 
LEGION EARL GRAHAM POST 159 
HON. BILL FLORES 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 30, 2020 
Mr. FLORES. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the 100-year anniversary of 
American Legion Earl Graham Post 159. 
American Legion Post 159 was chartered 13 
February 1920 and named after First Lieuten-
ant Cyrus Earl Graham, Texas A&M University 
class of 1916. 
Lieutenant Graham was a member of the 
United States Army Air Corps and was killed 
in action in France on 9 November 1918. 
From the beginning, The American Legion 
created an egalitarian organization open to 
membership regardless of race, gender, or re-
ligion. Post 159 has embodied these goals 
and has been a community-minded organiza-
tion since its inception 100 years ago. 
During this period, Post 159 has been dedi-
cated to serving the local Brazos Valley com-
munity through events such as the Brazos 
County Fair and the historical Juneteenth 
Celebration, both of which were hosted on 
The American Legion grounds. These events 
saw over 1,000 people come together to em-
brace our community. 
Post 159 of The American Legion continues 
its commitment to the community to this day, 
with programs that provide activities for local 
youth and veterans, as well as support for Ac-
tive Duty military members currently serving 
overseas. 
The annual Resource Fair and Veterans As-
sistance program provides over $20,000 in fi-
nancial assistance to veterans in need. 
Madam Speaker, it is clear that The Amer-
ican Legion Earl Graham Post 159 has had a 
significant and positive impact on the Brazos 
Valley during its 100–year history. 
I have requested the United States flag be 
flown over our Nation’s Capitol to recognize 
this significant milestone and their contribu-
tions to our veterans and to our community. 
As I close today, I urge all Americans to 
continue praying for our country, for our vet-
erans, and for our military men and women 
who protect us and for our first responders 
who keep us safe at home.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
CAREER 
OF 
BULLHEAD CITY CHIEF OF PO-
LICE BRIAN WILLIAMSON 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 30, 2020 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to commemorate the retirement of Bullhead 
City Chief of Police Brian Williamson, ending 
a career serving our country for 32 years in 
law enforcement. 
Chief Williamson began his honorable ca-
reer in 1988 by enlisting in the U.S. Army as 
a military police officer. He would leave the 
Army in 1992, only to enter public law enforce-
ment to protect the people of Western Ari-
zona. 
After serving with the Mohave County Sher-
iffs Office, Chief Williamson became a patrol 
officer with the Bullhead City Police Depart-
ment, working his way through the ranks to 
eventually achieve the position of chief of po-
lice, where he has served for the last nine 
years. This year, Chief Williamson is entering 
a much-deserved retirement and we in West-
ern Arizona deeply thank him for his tireless 
service to Mohave County. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank Chief 
Williamson for his lifetime of service to our na-
tion and offer my warmest wishes for a happy 
retirement. Western Arizona is safer and 
stronger on the back of the service provided 
by Chief Williamson and his officers, and I 
urge my colleagues to join me in wishing Chief 
Williamson well in the next adventures life 
brings.

H.R. 2, THE MOVING FORWARD 
ACT 
HON. RICK LARSEN 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 30, 2020 
Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today in support of medium-sized cit-
ies in Washington state and across the coun-
try who play a critical role in driving the na-
tion’s economy. 
In Washington state, transportation and in-
frastructure mean jobs and are key to eco-
nomic recovery as the nation grapples with the 
COVID–19 pandemic. Recently, the House 
passed H.R. 2, the Moving Forward Act, a 
comprehensive package that invests more 
than $1.5 trillion in America’s transportation 
and infrastructure over the next five years. 
This includes nearly $7 billion for Washington 
state’s transportation network. The Moving 
Forward Act is part of a long-term vision to put 
Americans back to work, jumpstart the econ-
omy and make the transportation network 
smarter, safer and greener. 
Although H.R. 2 significantly increases sur-
face transportation funding, it falls short in 
helping the nation’s medium-sized cities, like 
Mountlake Terrace, Lynnwood and Oak Har-
bor in my district. Congress must recommit to 
supporting medium-sized cities’ efforts to im-
prove their transportation systems and foster 
economic development. We can do this by in-
creasing federal infrastructure investment. 
Previously known as Transportation Invest-
ment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) 
grants, the U.S. Department of Transpor-
tation’s (DOT) Better Utilizing Investments to 
Leverage 
Development 
(BUILD) 
program 
awards grants to local surface transportation 
projects across the country. However, the 
BUILD program’s structure can force medium- 
sized cities to delay or indefinitely postpone 
vital transportation projects. 
The City of Mountlake Terrace, Washington 
is one example. The city applied for a BUILD 
grant in 2011 and 2012 to help fund the rede-
velopment of Main Street to facilitate eco-
nomic development and affordable housing 
connected to the planned Light Rail station. 
Despite receiving among the highest economic 
benefit ratios by DOT, the city’s population 
size was the main reason DOT did not fund 
the project. 
The City of Shoreline, Washington faced a 
similar problem. For the past two years, 
Shoreline has submitted a BUILD grant appli-
cation for a project to rebuild a highway inter-
change that will help reduce congestion and 
improve mobility. Although this project was 
highly rated and advanced to the Transpor-
tation Secretary’s desk for consideration, it 
has not received federal funding due to its me-
dium-sized population. 
To help address these issues, I introduced 
the Better Utilizing Investments to Leverage 
Development 
for 
Underfunded 
Projects 
(BUILD UP) Act earlier this year. The BUILD 
UP Act would require at least 30 percent of 
funding from the U.S. Department of Transpor-
tation’s BUILD grant funding be awarded to 
cities with 10,000 to 75,000 residents. Over 
the past two years, cities with populations be-
tween 10,000 and 75,000 have received ap-
proximately 35 percent of BUILD funding. The 
BUILD UP Act would codify current DOT dis-
tribution practice and not re-route funding from 
other rural or urban areas. 
As the country recovers from the COVID–19 
pandemic, Congress must ensure medium- 
size cities can access the federal resources 
necessary to proceed with shovel-ready infra-
structure projects and to help put Americans 
back to work. I encourage House leadership

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF ROBERT EDINGTON 
HON. TERRI A. SEWELL 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 30, 2020 
Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the life and legacy of 
Robert Edington, a military veteran, former 
Alabama State Senator and Representative, 
prominent Mobile area lawyer, dedicated com-
munity leader and devoted husband and fa-
ther. His many years of service to his state 
and to his country demonstrate his patriotism, 
his servant heart and his commitment to our 
American values. 
Robert Edington was born in Mobile, Ala-
bama to Judge David Henry Edington and 
Cornelia Owen Edington on November 18, 
1929. He studied at Rhodes College as an un-
dergraduate and earned his Juris Doctorate 
from the University of Alabama. In addition to 
his distinguished military career, Robert prac-
ticed law in Mobile, Alabama for over sixty 
years, establishing himself as one of the pre-
eminent lawyers in the area. 
A veteran, Robert served on active duty with 
the U.S. Navy from 1951 to 1955, and in the 
Navy Active Reserve from 1955 until his retire-
ment as a Commander in 1980. Robert’s ex-
emplary service record was evident in the 
many awards, medals and accolades he 
earned throughout his years of selfless serv-
ice. As Navy Air Operations Officer, Robert 
was awarded the Korean Service Medal with 
two Battle Stars; the China Service Medal; the 
United Nations Service Medal; and the Korean 
Presidential Unit Citation. 
Robert further served his state and his 
country in the Alabama State Legislature, first 
as a State Representative from 1962 to 1970; 
and then as State Senator from 1970 to 1974. 
During his time in the State Legislature, Rob-
ert was instrumental in the creation of the Uni-
versity of South Alabama, the University of 
South Alabama College of Medicine and the 
development of Bishop State Community Col-
lege. He also played a lead role in estab-
lishing the Alabama Historical Commission 
and was recognized for his efforts by the Na-
tional Trust for Historic Preservation in Wash-
ington, D.C. with their national award. 
Robert also authored legislation which cre-
ated the USS Alabama Battleship Commis-
sion. Seeing his vision through, Robert served 
on the commission in during its creation in 
1963 through 1972 and later served as its 
Chairman. During this period, Robert also lo-
cated and arranged for the Alabama OS2U’s 
transfer and relocation. Owing to his leader-
ship and dedication, Robert was again ap-
pointed to the Battleship Commission in the 
year 2000. 
Robert has also served as State President 
and National Director of the Navy League of 
the United States. In this capacity, he actively 
supported port visits of U.S. Navy vessels for 
important occasions, including Mardi Gras. He 
has also served as President of the CSS Ala-
bama Association USA, where he has over-
seen tremendous fundraising and artifact re-

A dedicated member of the Mobile, Ala-
bama community, Robert was Mobile’s Consul 
to Guatemala for twenty years and organized 
Mobile’s first trade mission to Central America. 
For his efforts, he was awarded the U.S. De-
partment of Commerce’s Achievement Award. 
Robert served on the National Advisory

blessed to be influenced by their wise counsel 
and infectious commitment to community serv-
ice. Robert led by example, dedicating his life 
to love of God, country, family and community. 
He was always willing to work to improve the 
lives of others. From his military career to his 
political and civic engagement, Robert has left 
an indelible mark on the city of Mobile and the 
state of Alabama. May we find comfort in 
knowing that his extraordinary legacy will live 
on in the many people he impacted. 
On behalf of the Alabama Congressional 
Delegation, I ask my colleagues to join me in

HONORING CLIFFORD 
SPIEGELMAN, PH.D. 
HON. BILL FLORES 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 30, 2020 
Mr. FLORES. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life and legacy of Dr. Clifford 
Spiegelman of College Station, Texas, who 
passed away on 14 May 2020. 
Dr. Spiegelman, known as Cliff to his family 
and friends, was born on 15 May 1948 in 
Long Island, New York, to Charlie and Doris 
Spiegelman. 
In school, he was an accomplished athlete 
and won numerous awards for track and other 
sports. He also excelled in the classroom and 
pursued a career in academics, receiving his 
bachelor of science from the State University 
of New York at Buffalo in 1970, his master’s 
degree in managerial economics from North-
western University in 1973, and his Ph.D. in 
statistics and applied mathematics from North-
western University in 1976. 
Cliff started his career with the agency now 
known as the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology, commonly called NIST. He 
later became a tenured professor at the De-
partment of Statistics at Texas A&M Univer-
sity. 
Serving on the faculty at Texas A&M for 
over 30 years, Cliff became renowned in his 
field and a highly sought-after expert in the 
application of statistical expertise to forensic 
science, chemistry, and medicine. In 2009, he 
was named a distinguished professor of statis-
tics, the university’s highest rank for faculty. 
His contributions to the field of statistics were 
further recognized in his appointment as a re-
gents professor in 2019. 
Cliff was particularly known for his helpful 
nature and deep commitment to justice and 
fairness in the criminal justice system. He was 
nationally recognized for his research on sta-
tistical interpretation of criminal evidence, such 
as bullet fragment analysis and firearm tool 
marks. 
He was a fierce advocate of accuracy by in-
vestigators to prevent false convictions. He 
further expanded his advocacy through his 
work with the Innocence Project, testifying pro 
bona in evidentiary admissibility hearings and 
providing research that played critical roles in 
overturning false convictions of innocent indi-
viduals. 
His commitment to justice extended outside 
of the courtroom as well. He served on the 
Texas Forensic Science Commission as well 
as the Texas Holocaust and Genocide Com-
mission, where he worked to ensure that the 
death statistics of the Holocaust and other 
genocides are reliably reported. 
Dr. Spiegelman leaves a professional legacy 
that is unmatched in his field. However, his 
proudest accomplishments were outside of the 
workplace. 
Cliff married Dr. Katherine Bretzlaff in 1990, 
a fellow professor at Texas A&M. Together, 
they raised two daughters, Lindsey and Abi-
gail, who each carry their parents’ commit-
ments to academic excellence, strong work 
ethic, and kindness to those around them. 
In the tributes written by the many individ-
uals and organizations positively impacted by 
Cliffs work, nearly all spoke of Cliffs pride in 
his family and his frequent excitement to share 
the achievements of his daughters. 
Madam Speaker, Dr. Clifford Spiegelman’s 
life was defined by his outstanding accom-
plishments as a professor, mentor, and expert 
in statistics, as well as his commitment to his 
family and friends. He will be forever remem-
bered for his strong principles and commit-
ment to excellence and as a devoted hus-
band, father, and friend. 
My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest and 
heartfelt condolences to the Spiegelman fam-
ily. I have requested the United States flag be 
flown over our Nation’s Capitol to honor the 
life, legacy, and service of Dr. Clifford 
Spiegelman.

rooms have turned into makeshift classrooms, 
and parents have taken it upon themselves to 
educate their children. 
However, as we approach what would be 
the start of a new school year, new challenges 
for these families lie on the horizon. 
Can parents devote more time to their chil-
dren’s education while maintaining their own 
job responsibilities? 
Madam Speaker, I cannot stress this point 
enough: we must safely reopen schools so 
students do not run the risk of falling further 
behind. 
The American people are counting on Con-
gress to act, and we can’t wait a second 
more.

TRIBUTE TO COL. EDWIN DENT 
SELBY 
HON. VERN BUCHANAN 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 30, 2020 
Mr. BUCHANAN. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
pay tribute to Col. Edwin Dent Selby of St. Pe-
tersburg, Florida, a World War II veteran who 
will be 100 years old on October 16, 2020. He 
was born in 1920 at Fort Sam Houston, 
Texas, where his father, a career Army officer 
was stationed. He and his brother and sister 
were raised in many states and the Phil-
ippines. 
After attending college at the New Mexico 
Military Institute, he began active duty as a 
2nd Lieutenant on December 27, 1941, shortly 
after the attack on Pearl Harbor. His training 
started on horseback in the Cavalry branch 
and later transitioned to tanks in the Armor 
branch. He served over three years in WW II 
in combat theaters in North Africa and Italy. At 
one time he was placed in charge of 5,000 
German prisoners of war. His outstanding 
service led him to be assigned to a high level 
staff position in Italy at the Mediterranean The-
ater of Operations, United States Army 
(MTOUSA), Allied Force Headquarters, Su-
preme Allied Command. 
Upon his return stateside he met and mar-
ried 1st Lieutenant Elizabeth Moffat, a U.S. 
Army nurse. After post war service in Vienna, 
Austria, he was assigned as a tank gunnery 
instructor at the Armor school at Fort Knox, 
Kentucky. In 1957 he, his wife and four chil-
dren moved to Taiwan (then Formosa) where 
he was an armor advisor with the Military As-
sistance Advisory Group (MAAG). While there, 
his beloved wife became suddenly ill and died. 
He returned to St. Petersburg, Florida, as a 
widower with four children 10 and under 
where he was placed in charge of the Army 
reserve units on the west coast of Florida. 
After over 21 years of service he retired as a 
Colonel in 1962. 
Following his retirement, he started Selby 
Real Estate in St. Petersburg. It was a highly 
successful brokerage which eventually grew to 
have 100 sales associates who covered much 
of Pinellas County. He bought and later per-
sonally operated with his wife, Janice, a 100- 
acre citrus grove in Parrish, Florida, where 
they grew, sold and shipped worldwide 25 va-
rieties of fruit. He later expanded the grove to 
include a llama and emu ranch. At the age of 
nearly 85 he finally retired from his third ca-
reer to his home in St. Petersburg Beach 
where he lives today with his wife Janice. He 
has enjoyed a fulfilling life of service to others 
and has lived very active life that included 
swimming, horseback riding, skiing, tennis, 
golf and travelling. 
I appreciate this opportunity to honor him for 
his service and wish him a happy birthday.

IN RECOGNITION OF JOAN DOWD 
ON HER RETIREMENT AFTER 42 
YEARS OF SERVICE TO CATHO-
LIC EDUCATION 
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 30, 2020 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Joan Dowd who is retiring 
from teaching after 42 years of service to 
Catholic education. Joan was honored with a 
surprise parade at Holy Rosary School on 
June 6, 2020. 
The daughter of Joseph and Ann Baker, 
Joan was born on August 22, 1952 in Pittston, 
Pennsylvania. Committed to her faith from a 
young age, she grew up attending St. Mary’s 
Assumption Church along with her two sisters, 
Barbara and Joyce, and she was the third 
generation in her family to attend St. Mary’s 
Assumption elementary school. Joan went on 
to study at St. John’s High School and at 
Marywood University. 
After graduating from college in 1976 with a 
degree in health and physical education and a 
certificate in elementary and special edu-
cation, Joan was hired as the assistant girls’ 
basketball coach at St. John the Evangelist 
School. She then went on to coach the girls’ 
basketball team at St. Mary’s Assumption, 
leading her team to a league championship. 
Joan began her teaching career as a sub-
stitute at St. Anthony’s School in Dunmore. In 
1978, she returned to her alma mater, St. 
Mary’s Assumption, where she taught second 
grade for the next 33 years. In addition to 
teaching her students the traditional school 
subjects, she helped them grow in their faith 
and guide them through receiving the sacra-
ments of Reconciliation and Eucharist. Joan 
devoted her time to the school community by 
volunteering for committees and extra-cur-
ricular 
activities, 
including 
the 
school’s 
forensics team. 
When St. Mary’s Assumption closed its 
doors in 2011, Joan was undeterred and re-
mained committed to Catholic education. She 
accepted a new post as the second-grade 
teacher at Holy Rosary School in Duryea, 
Pennsylvania. During her tenure as an educa-
tor, she taught generations of students and 
fostered lifelong relationships with her stu-
dents, their parents, and her colleagues. 
Joan lives in Pittston with her husband, Mi-
chael and dog, Charley. They have two sons, 
Kevin and Brian and one grandchild, Rory. 
It is an honor to congratulate Joan on her 
retirement after 42 years of teaching in the Di-
ocese of Scranton’s Catholic school system. 
As an educator, her commitment to her stu-
dents and school community was unmatched, 
and under her tutelage, her students received 
a first-rate education while learning many im-
portant life lessons. I wish her a restful and 
enjoyable retirement. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF LEWIS 
MERRIMAN BUTTERY 
HON. BILL FLORES 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 30, 2020 
Mr. FLORES. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life and legacy of Mr. Lewis 
Merriman Buttery of Lampasas, Texas, who 
passed away on 20 December 2008. Lewis 
Buttery was born on 20 March 1924 in San 
Angelo, Texas, to Albert James and Dorothy 
Hoss Buttery. 
On his 18th birthday, just 3 months after the 
attack on Pearl Harbor, he attempted to enlist 
in the United States Navy. He had hoped to 
join his older brothers in service—one, an 
Army artillery officer, and the other, a naval 
aviator. Unfortunately, Lewis was denied en-
listment at that time due to health issues. 
This denial only strengthened his resolve to 
serve his country. Each month he attempted 
to enlist until he was finally accepted and 
sworn in on 20 October 1942. 
Lewis was called to Active Duty in June of 
1943 and was sent to the University of Texas 
to continue pursuit of his engineering degree. 
He was later sent to Midshipmen School at 
Columbia University in New York. In March 
1944, Lewis was commissioned as an ensign 
and ordered to San Francisco to complete 
gunnery school. 
He was ultimately assigned to USS Patrol 
Craft Escort 880 in Adak, Alaska, as a gun-
nery officer. 
In preparation for the invasion of Japan, his 
ship was converted into a weather ship, and 
he became the areological, (weather) officer. 
The ship was transferred to the Marshall-Gil-
bert Islands area to transmit weather observa-
tions and to guide Army Air Corps bombers 
which were preparing the way for the invasion 
of Japan. The invasion did not occur due to 
the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Naga-
saki, after which Japan quickly surrendered. 
Prior to being released to Inactive Duty in 
the Ready Reserve in July 1946, he became 
the executive officer of the ship and was pro-
moted to lieutenant junior grade. 
Lewis was called back to Active Duty in 
June 1950 at the start of the Korean war, but 
his orders were canceled before he could 
reach his ship in San Diego. Ultimately, Lieu-
tenant Buttery received an honorable dis-
charge in 1954. 
Following World War II, Mr. Buttery came 
home and finished his degree in chemical en-
gineering at the University of Texas at Austin. 
He also married Virginia Kerzee in Limestone 
County, Texas, raised a family, and had a 
successful career. 
Lewis was also a student of maps and car-
tography. Prior to the war in 1941, he com-
pleted courses in surveying and mapping at 
Texas A&M University and continued that avo-
cation through the rest of his life. During his 
extensive work-related travels, Mr. Buttery col-
lected numerous atlases and maps, which he 
and his wife later donated to the University of 
Texas at Arlington’s Cartographic History Li-
brary. 
He was a founding member of the Texas 
Map Society and author of numerous mono-
graph and facsimile portfolios devoted to early 
Texas. One of his works, entitled, ‘‘Regional 
Maps of Texas: 1720–2001; Region 1 North

Texas,’’ contains many valuable insights about 
the mapping history of large portions of Texas. 
The maps that he and Virginia donated and 
the works that he published will continue to 
educate future generations interested in car-
tographic history. 
He was very proud of his time in the Navy 
and believed that it molded and shaped him 
throughout the remainder of his life. In rec-
ognition of this, the ‘‘Navy Hymn’’ was sol-
emnly played at his funeral. 
I have requested that a United States flag 
be flown over our Nation’s Capitol to honor the 
life, legacy, and service of Lewis Merriman 
Buttery. 
As I close today, I urge all Americans to 
continue praying for our country in these dif-
ficult times, for our military men and women 
who protect us, and the first responders who 
protect us at home.

TRIBUTE TO BRUCE KENNETH 
NESTANDE 
HON. KEN CALVERT 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 30, 2020 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and pay tribute to an outstanding in-
dividual, Bruce Nestande, who passed away 
at the age of 82 on July 9, 2020. Bruce was 
a loving husband, father, brother, grandfather, 
an honorable veteran and an esteemed com-
munity leader. He will be deeply missed. 
Bruce was born and raised in Minnesota 
and as a child developed a love of baseball. 
A gifted athlete, Bruce nearly turned his hobby 
into a career when he was drafted to the Kan-
sas City Athletics. He decided not to sign with 
the team and instead enrolled himself in the 
Reserve Officers’ Training Program at the Uni-
versity of Minnesota. Bruce graduated with a 
degree in economics and following graduation 
continued his studies in Quantico, VA at the 
U.S. Marine Corps Officer Candidates School. 
After his time in Quantico, Bruce was de-
ployed to Southeast Asia and upon return was 
stationed at Camp Pendleton in San Diego, 
CA. This sparked Bruce’s love for California, 
the state that would be his home for the next 
50 years. After his service in the military, 
Bruce began to work in politics. He served as 
a special assistant to Governor Ronald 
Reagan and later went on to run for elected 
office. Bruce was elected and served in the 
California State Assembly from 1974 to 1980, 
where he championed a diverse set of issues 
from land use to public safety. In 1980, Bruce 
was elected to the Orange County Board of 
Supervisors where he was a leader on 
projects that led to the construction of Orange 
County’s toll roads and the maintenance of 
Riverside County’s Prado Dam. 
Politics was Bruce’s greatest hobby and po-
litical discussions ran through the Nestande 
household constantly. His children were well 
versed in policy issues from a young age and 
two even went on to follow his footsteps into 
politics. As a political leader in California, 
Bruce garnered respect across both sides of 
the aisle, willing to come together with Demo-
crats to find common ground whenever pos-
sible. Even those in Sacramento he consist-
ently sparred with had an unwavering respect 
for Bruce. 
I had the pleasure of knowing Bruce through 
his service to Southern California and can per-
sonally attest to his numerous achievements 
and the countless lives he touched. He was a 
great American, a true patriot, an esteemed 
leader, and a dedicated husband, father, and 
friend. I extend my heartfelt condolences to 
his wife, Pamela, to their children, Brian, 
Gabrielle, and Francesca, his siblings Jim and 
Linda, his grandchildren, and the rest of his 
family and friends. Bruce was preceded in 
death by his son Barry, and I find comfort in 
knowing the two of them have been reunited. 
Although Bruce may no longer be with us, he 
will continue to have a lasting impact on the 
lives of his family and community.

HONORING THE LIFE OF MICHAEL 
TY SPRADLIN 
HON. BILL FLORES 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 30, 2020 
Mr. FLORES. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Senior Airman Michael Ty Spradlin of 
Bryan, Texas, who passed way on 5 February 
2020. Known as Ty to his family and friends, 
he was killed in a motorcycle accident at 
Yokota Air Force Base in Japan. 
Ty was born 5 March 1991 in Wheelock, 
Texas, to Theresa Lynn Spradlin and Michael 
Todd Spradlin. He graduated from Bryan High 
School in 2009 and enlisted in the United 
States Air Force in 2012. 
Over his 8 years of service in the United 
States Air Force, Ty worked as a crew chief 
on a variety of C–130 aircraft. He traveled to 
many countries and enjoyed the opportunity to 
see the world. 
During his service, Ty traveled to the Phil-
ippines, 
Australia, 
Thailand, 
Kuwait, 
and 
Korea. He served at three different squadrons 
over those 8 years, including: the 353rd Spe-
cial Operations Group, Kadena Air Force 
Base, Okinawa, Japan; the 755th Aircraft 
Maintenance Squadron at Davis-Monthan Air 
Force Base, AZ; and the 374th Maintenance 
Squadron, Yokota Air Force Base, Japan. 
Senior Airman Spradlin bravely served his 
country, and his legacy will be forever woven 
into our American military history. Ty was not 
only a proud public servant; he was a friend 
to all, a loving son, a brother, and an uncle. 
My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest and 
heartfelt condolences to the Spradlin family. 
I have requested the United States flag be 
flown over our Nation’s Capitol to honor the 
life, legacy, and service of Senior Airman Mi-
chael Ty Spradlin. 
As I close today, I urge all Americans to 
continue praying for our country, for our vet-
erans, for our military men and women, and 
for our first responders who protect us at

PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 30, 2020 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I was un-
avoidably detained and missed the vote.

forcement officers, departments or units for 
exceptional achievement.

HONORING THE LIFE OF WAYNE 
PURSELLEY 
HON. BILL FLORES 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 30, 2020 
Mr. FLORES. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life and legacy of Alvie W. 
‘‘Wayne’’ Purselley of Waco, Texas, who 
passed away on 29 February 2020. 
Wayne was born on 27 June 1932 in Lov-
ing, Texas, to Herman and Ida Purselley. He 
attended Texas A&M University and, upon 
graduation, was commissioned as a second 
lieutenant in the United States Air Force, ulti-
mately serving for 22 years. He flew 6,000 
hours as navigator and served as a missile 
launch officer before retiring as a lieutenant 
colonel. 
Following his retirement from the Air Force, 
Wayne became a teacher and planetarium di-
rector for Richfield High School in Waco, 
where he wrote and taught the ‘‘Christ Re-
vealed in the Stars’’ lecture series for many 
years. 
Wayne was a dedicated member of High-
land Baptist Church for 45 years, where he 
served in both leadership and teaching roles. 
In addition to his many roles within the church 
community, Wayne served as the president of 
the local Military Officers Association of Amer-
ica, Waco chapter, as well as the chairman of 
the McLennan County Republican Club. 
Wayne served our country and community 
for many years, and his legacy will be forever 
woven into our American history. 
Wayne was a committed and faithful hus-
band to his wife, Barbara; a Loving father; a 
committed teacher; a mentor; a community 
servant; and a friend to many. 
My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest and 
heartfelt condolences to the Purselley family. 
I have requested the United States flag be 
flown over our Nation’s Capitol to honor the 
life, legacy, and service of Wayne Purselley. 
As I close today, I urge all Americans to 
continue praying for our country, for our vet-
erans, for our military men and women who 
protect us, and for our first responders who 
keep us safe at home.

HONORING MIKE MCQUAID 
HON. GREG STANTON 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 30, 2020 
Mr. STANTON. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the life and legacy of Mike McQuaid, 
who passed away on July 25, 2020. A man of 
deep faith, Mike was a committed advocate for 
people experiencing homelessness in our 
community and transformed our approach to 
serving those in need. His empathy and focus 
on human dignity serve as an example to all 
of us, and Arizona is a kinder, more just place 
for his presence among us. 
After a successful career in commercial real 
estate, Mike devoted himself to serving mem-
bers of our community experiencing homeless-
ness. What began as serving hot meals 
through a church community service project 
turned into using his professional expertise to 
create a comprehensive campus that would

house critical services for our neighbors in 
need. Today, because of Mike’s leadership 
and perseverance, the Human Services Cam-
pus in downtown Phoenix brings together nu-
merous local agencies to serve men and 
women experiencing homelessness and has 
become a national model for addressing one 
of our society’s most pressing needs. 
Mike was equally known for his visionary 
leadership as he was for his humility and kind-
ness. Mike swept the floors of the building 
with the same determined focus as he nego-
tiated deals in the halls of power. For all his 
hours of labor and sweat, Mike never asked 
for anything financial in return, drawing a sal-
ary of $1 a month when he became the first 
director of the new campus. His life became 
an inspiration and example to executives and 
leaders across Arizona, and he never shied 
away from asking everyone to consider what 
it meant to love your neighbor. Always ready 
with a kind smile and word of encouragement, 
Mike continuously maintained a personal con-
nection to the cause, befriending families in 
need and providing direct services where he 
could. 
Mike will be deeply missed by his friends, 
family and all of those committed to justice 
and societal change. His work and service will 
be felt for generations to come and today I 
rise in gratitude to honor his life and legacy. 
Thank you, Mike, and Godspeed.

HONORING THE CAREER AND 
SERVICE OF KEN DELACRUZ 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 30, 2020 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the retirement of Mr. Ken 
Delacruz, President of the Metal Trades Coun-
cil at General Dynamics Electric Boat, after 46 
years of service as a shipbuilder and a leader 
in our region. 
In his time at the shipyard, Kenny has seen 
it all—he saw the boom years of construction 
on the Los Angeles and Ohio Class sub-
marines early in his career as a welder, the 
lean post-Cold War years of Seawolf and the 
uncertain start of Virginia class. In recent 
years, he’s led the workforce as the yard 
ramped up for steady rate construction of the 
Virginia class program and the start of the Co-
lumbia class submarine, an historic expansion 
in work and activity that has surged hiring in 
the yard with a new generation of shipbuilders. 
Since 1991, Kenny has served as President 
of the Metals Trades Council at Electric Boat, 
representing thousands of workers across the 
waterfront trades. In that position Kenny has 
negotiated eight collective bargaining agree-
ments—the latest winning 85 percent approval 
among members in 2019. Being a labor leader 
in a shipyard is a tough job, but in his incred-
ible 29 years as president Ken has earned the 
respect of generations of his members, man-
agement, and elected officials. 
Kenny’s permanent footprint on the yard will 
be felt in other ways as well, most importantly 
with his focus on the future of the workforce. 
In 2014, Ken was instrumental in helping to 
make the case to then-Labor Secretary Tom 
Perez during his visit to Groton about the 
need for federal investment in the manufac-
turing pipeline program to help new tradesmen 
and women gain the skills and training they 
need to succeed. After that visit, the eastern 
Connecticut workforce investment board re-
ceived a $6 million workforce innovation grant 
from the U.S. Department of Labor that has 
resulted in hundreds of pre-apprenticeship 
graduates acquiring entry level skills at EB. 
And, he led the effort re-establish and re-invig-
orate the apprenticeship program to ensure 
that the knowledge of our veteran skilled ma-
chinists and welders can be handed down to 
the next generation. 
On a personal note, for over twenty years, 
Kenny has always been a good friend and 
confidante, who taught me a lot about his 
members, their amazing talents and value to 
eastern Connecticut, navy shipbuilding and 
our national defense. 
As Kenny prepares for his well-deserved re-
tirement, he can take pride in knowing that the 
shipyard he joined in 1976 has a more solid 
foundation and a brighter future thanks to his 
leadership and commitment to his workforce 
and the nation’s undersea priorities. He has 
been a trusted ally, a committed partner and 
a friend to me and my office. And most impor-
tant, he’s been a fearless advocate for the 
men and women of the Metal Trades Council. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring 
Kenny’s 46 years of service to Electric Boat 
and our nation, and in wishing him a safe and 
happy retirement.

FREE IRAN GLOBAL SUMMIT 
HON. TOM McCLINTOCK 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 30, 2020 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD the following remarks by 
Mrs. Maryam Rajavi, the President-elect of the 
National Council of Resistance of Iran. Mrs. 
Rajavi addressed the three-day Free Iran 
Global Summit in July 2020 in Albania, home 
to thousands of members of the principal Ira-
nian opposition group, the Mujahedin-e Khalq 
(PMOI/MEK). 
The online summit linked Iranians and 1,000 
current and former government officials, bipar-
tisan lawmakers and international dignitaries 
from 30,000 locations in 102 countries . 
Below are excerpts from Mrs. Rajavi’s 
speech: 
This summit echoes the voice of the Ira-
nian people’s 40-year resistance against reli-
gious dictatorship and fascism and for free-
dom and democracy. 
This is the voice of the largest, the long-
est-standing, most sophisticated, and most 
serious organized resistance in Iran’s his-
tory, with the roaring river of its martyrs’ 
blood, and the moving chants of massacred 
Mujahedin members who continued to insist 
on their belief to the end, against the most 
murderous and cruel rulers. 
This summit echoes calls for the clerical 
regime’s overthrow, which were heard during 
successive uprisings from December 2017 and 
January 2018 to November 2019 and January 
2020. It is the people’s calls for the regime’s 
overthrow after the conclusion of ‘‘reformer 
vs. principlist’’ theatrics that was aimed at 
preserving this very regime. 
This summit is the voice of Resistance 
Units and rebellious cities across Iran who 
have put an end to a history of despair, in-
credulity, and inaptitude, replacing it with 
the pledge of ‘‘we can and we must.’’ 
Today’s summit represents our enchained 
homeland in three of its most prominent fea-
tures: A rebellious and revolutionary Iran; 
an Iran united in solidarity; and a free and 
democratic Iran of tomorrow. 
We have come together to underline three 
monumental and historic commitments that 
we have pledged to accomplish. 
Our first commitment is that we, the peo-
ple of Iran and the Iranian Resistance, will 
overthrow the clerical regime and will re-
claim Iran. 
Our second commitment is that we, the 
people of Iran and the Iranian Resistance, 
will build a free and democratic Iran. 
And our third commitment is to remain 
faithful to our people’s sovereignty and their 
vote; to not seek power at any cost, but to 
establish freedom and justice at any cost; to 
never return to the dictatorships of the Shah 
and the mullahs. As the majority of elected 
lawmakers in the U.S. and Europe have 
pointed out, we want to establish a demo-
cratic, secular and non-nuclear Iran. 
From all indications, the ruling theocracy 
is at the point of being overthrown. 
The uprisings that spanned from December 
2017 and January 2018 to November 2019 and 
January 2020 were not about reforming the 
regime. Rather, these uprisings sought to 
overthrow the clerics. 
[The young] generation delivered the thun-
derous chants of ‘‘Death to the oppressor, be 
it the Shah or the [supreme] Leader.’’ ‘‘We 
don’t want the Shah or the Leader, we don’t 
want a choice between bad and worse.’’ 
This generation chants ‘‘Our enemy is 
right here. They lie when they say it is 
America.’’ 
The Iranian Resistance relied on precise 
and well-documented reports to register the 
figure of 1,500 martyrs during the November 
2019 uprising. The actual figure is much 
higher. 
These uprisings checkmated the Iranian 
regime’s political apologists, advocates, lob-
byists, and paid operatives, by completely 
discrediting their deception and lies. 
The regime’s puppets kept saying that it 
would be inconceivable for the people of Iran 
to turn to uprisings and revolution to over-
throw the mullahs. 
They kept saying that change in Iran will 
not happen except from within the regime 
itself. And time and again, they repeated the 
mullahs’ false claim about the PMOI/MEK’s 
lack of popular support. 
This explains why the mullahs and their 
mob of interrogators and functionaries have 
unleashed against the Resistance and the 
PMOI/MEK. They see themselves about to be 
overthrown and are in agony over the fact 
that these uprisings and rebellious youth 
have adopted the roadmap and the strategy 
of the PMOI/MEK. 
The volcanic uprising in November washed 
away all unfounded claims. 
It was proven that it is possible to inspire 
and organize protests. 
It was proven that despite all the repres-
sion and crimes, our people have a spectac-
ular desire and readiness to continue their 
uprising. 
And it was proven that a force capable of 
overthrowing the regime has emerged and is 
lurking in the hearts of Iranian cities. 
It is this rebellious force which, despite un-
relenting arrests, empowers resistance units 
to constantly regroup, reproduce, and mul-
tiply themselves. 
Over the past two years, the emergence of 
rebellious cities and the operations of resist-
ance units against repression, aimed at 
breaking the suppressive atmosphere, fueling 
the engine of the uprisings, and mobilizing 
the people, have made the regime feel the 
clearly and vividly.

July 30, 2020 
If they [the mullahs] continue to pursue 
their current path and course of action, 
namely belligerence, missile launches, ter-
rorism, intimidation and closing ranks, they 
will inevitably crash head first. 
If they make the slightest retreat, namely, 
if they change their behavior and abandon 
their 
suppression, 
terrorism 
and 
bellig-
erence, then they would undermine the very 
existence of rule of the velayat-e faqih (abso-
lute clerical rule). 
For this reason, Khamenei calls for the 
creation of ‘‘a young and Hezbollahi govern-
ment’’ and sees a monolithic Parliament and 
a murderous Judiciary as the only way out 
of the vortex of crises and the only way to 
preserve the regime. 
The international community’s decision to 
activate the snapback mechanism would be 
the coup de grace shot to the regime’s wind-
fall achievements under the JCPOA and the 
policy of appeasement. 
To date, the accelerating outbreak of the 
coronavirus has taken the lives of at least 
72,000 people in Iran. 
In March, Khamenei admitted that he 
sought to create an opportunity and a bless-
ing out of the coronavirus crisis. 
The abnormal surging trend of the number 
of corona virus victims in Iran is a product 
of the criminal policies of Khamenei and 
Rouhani. The strategy of launching mass 
casualties as a barrier against the threat of 
an uprising and eventual overthrow is ex-
actly designed to pacify and demoralize the 
Iranian society, rendering it hopeless and 
paralyzed. 
During the breathtaking coronavirus cri-
sis, the mullahs continued to launch expen-
sive satellites into space. Concurrently, they 
pursued their belligerent and terrorist ac-
tivities in Iraq and Syria and escalated their 
ominous nuclear activities to a new level. 
The ruling mullahs must answer why the 
value of the country’s official currency has 
plunged so much? Why is there no ability to 
create jobs? Why is Iran one of the four 
countries in the world with the highest infla-
tion rates? 
And you must say where did Khamenei 
amass 100 billion dollars in his executive 
headquarters? 
The 15 institutions and foundations under 
Khamenei’s control have a total of one tril-
lion dollars’ worth of assets. 
We pledged to overthrow the regime, take 
back Iran and restore all the violated and 
plundered rights of the people of Iran. 
Our people must enjoy the right to be 
healthy, have shelter, to employment, to or-
ganize and have syndicates, autonomy for 
ethnic minorities, equal participation in 
running society’s affairs, gender equality 
and popular sovereignty. 
They must be free of religious slavery and 
sexual exploitation. They must enjoy free-
dom of expression, opinion, and choice. They 
must be pulled out of poverty and be free 
from fear; this means ending torture, execu-
tions, and social and economic insecurity. 
We have pledged to restore all these free-
doms and rights. We make this pledge before 
the Iranian people and history. This is our 
pledge to 120,000 martyrs who fell for free-
dom. 
Today, in Iran, one of the greatest battles 
and one of the greatest tests of our time 
rages on between freedom and religious fas-
cism, between democracy and religious fun-
damentalism. 
We urge all governments and international 
bodies to stand with the people of Iran in 
this historic showdown against the greatest 
threat to world peace and security. 
The Iranian regime’s leaders planned to 
launch a major terrorist attack against the 
Free Iran Grand Gathering in Paris, in 2018. 
The terrorists in possession of the bomb were 
arrested by the Belgian Police. The regime’s 
diplomat, who delivered the bomb, has been 
in jail for more than two years. 
For the first time, a serving diplomat faces 
trial in Europe for direct involvement in ter-
rorism. This is a great disgrace for the re-
gime, and it shows that the regime spares no 
effort to commit any crime and pay any 
price to destroy its alternative. 
The trial of the four detained terrorists as 
the perpetrators of this terrorist act is a nec-
essary step. But the real decision makers 
were Khamenei, Rouhani, Zarif, and Intel-
ligence Minister Mahmoud Alavi. 
As I have reiterated time and again, we 
have not come to gain something for our-
selves; we have come to sacrifice and pay the 
requisite price. 
We are determined to restore freedom and 
people’s sovereignty in Iran, and this will 
happen. 
Long live freedom. God bless the people of 
Iran.

HONORING THE LIFE OF COLONEL 
GLENN STARNES 
HON. BILL FLORES 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 30, 2020 
Mr. FLORES. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life and legacy of Colonel Glenn 
Starnes, who passed away on 30 March 2020. 
Glenn was born 27 January 1959 as the 
second son of Charles and La Verne Starnes. 
He graduated from Texas A&M University in 
1981 and was commissioned as an officer in 
the United States Marine Corps. 
Colonel Starnes led a life of service to both 
his country as a decorated marine and to the 
Texas A&M community as a member of the 
Office of the Commandant’s staff. 
Glenn served in the Marines for 30 years 
and commanded at every level, from field artil-
lery battery to field artillery regiment. While 
serving his country, he was stationed in seven 
States and two countries. He fought in Oper-
ation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring 
Freedom through two tours of duty in 2003 
and 2005. Glenn also served on joint duty with 
the U.S. Central Command and later served 
as an exchange officer with the United King-
dom’s Joint Headquarters. 
Colonel Starnes was awarded the Legion of 
Merit with two Gold Stars, the Bronze Star 
with Combat ‘‘V’’ Device, the Defense Meri-
torious Service Medal, the Meritorious Service 
Medal with Gold Star, and the title of Officer 
of the Order of the British Empire from the 
Queen of England. 
After 30 years of service Glenn retired from 
the Marine Corps in 2011. 
In 2012, Colonel Starnes joined the Texas 
A&M University community as Assistant Com-
mandant for Operations and Training for 
A&M’s internationally recognized Corps of Ca-
dets. 
In his 8 years on this job, Glenn was a tire-
less worker who loved the Corps and the op-
portunity to serve as mentor for many of its 
members. 
He was highly respected by his colleagues, 
and many Aggies feel fortunate enough to call 
him friend. Colonel Starnes’ 30 years of dedi-
cated service embody the core values of 
Texas Aggies: respect, excellence, leadership, 
loyalty, integrity, and selfless service. His loss 
will be deeply felt by the Texas A&M commu-
nity and the Corps of Cadets. 
Madam Speaker, Colonel Starnes served 
his country proudly for many years, and his 
legacy will be forever woven into our American 
history. He was not only a dedicated public 
servant, he was a loving son, a husband, a fa-
ther, an effective mentor, and a loyal friend to 
hundreds. 
My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest and 
heartfelt condolences to the Starnes family. 
I have requested the United States flag be 
flown over our Nation’s Capitol to honor the 
life, legacy, and service of Colonel Glenn 
Starnes. 
As I close today I urge all Americans to con-
tinue praying for our country, for our veterans, 
for our military men and women who keep us 
safe, and for our first responders who keep us 
safe at home.

Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the bicentennial celebration of 
Franklin First United Methodist Church in 
Franklin, Kentucky. Shortly after the town was 
surveyed in 1820, the Union Church was es-
tablished where Presbyterians, Methodists and 
Baptists would all hold services. Franklin First 
would go on to have an incredible two-hun-
dred-year history, producing numerous servant 
leaders and engaging in missionary work that 
would spread beyond the 1st District. Mem-
bers of this church have proven to be stead-
fast leaders across the globe. In 1874, Mrs,

Missionary Society in Kentucky, In 1887, Miss 
Nannie B. Gaines served as a missionary in 
Hiroshima, Japan, going on to become the 
first principal of the initial girls’ school in Hiro-
shima. She laid the foundation for the modern 
21st century educational institution of Hiro-
shima Jogakuin, which now encompasses kin-
dergarten, junior high, high school and univer-
sity students. John T. Tigert was named 
Bishop after obtaining his undergraduate de-
gree at Vanderbilt University, where he was 
part of the university’s inaugural graduating 
class. His brilliant leadership moved the 
church forward in numerous ways. His son, 
John J. Tigert, Jr., would continue his father’s 
legacy of leadership by becoming a Rhodes 
Scholar, College Football Hall of Fame in-
ductee and President of the University of Flor-
ida. To ensure the future growth of the church, 
Doug Wilson planted the idea of building a 
Christian Life Center that was completed in 
1996. This building offered after-school pro-
grams for children and helped to instill the val-
ues of the church in the next generation. 
Franklin First has seen numerous congregates 
go on to be ordained as Methodist ministers or 
serve as local pastors. This track record of 
success demonstrates their desire to spread 
the lessons they learned at Franklin First be-
yond just their membership. The lessons they 
learned from Miss Nannie B. Gaines are still 
seen in the church through their international 
missionary work. The church routinely leads 
trips to Haiti and Honduras, and in 2020 they 
sponsored 41 educational scholarships for 
children from the region. Franklin First also 
participates in numerous local missionary 
projects through Room in the Inn and Good 
Samaritan, while also organizing an annual 
Trunk or Treat event that provides a safe 
place for local community children. Throughout 
the past 200 years, this church has faithfully 
served Simpson County in numerous ways. I 
am proud to recognize Franklin First United 
Methodist Church for the incredible work they 
have done not only in their community and 
state, but throughout the entire world.

HONORNG THE LIFE OF LIEUTEN-
ANT COMMANDER DENNIS LEE 
HASSMAN 
HON. BILL FLORES 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 30, 2020 
Mr. FLORES. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life of Lieutenant Commander 
Dennis Lee Hassman, Jr., of College Station, 
Texas, who passed away on 12 April 2020. 
Lieutenant Commander Hassman graduated 
from Texas A&M University in 1988 and sub-
sequently enlisted in the United States Navy. 
During his 20 years in the Navy, he served 
as a Remote Control Mission Commander and 
E–2C Airborne Mission Commander. Lee also 
served 
as 
a 
Naval 
Flight 
Officer 
and 
Antiterrorism/Force Protection Officer. In 2005, 
Lieutenant Commander Hassman received an 
MBA from the Naval Postgraduate School. 
In 2008, Lee retired from the Navy and re-
turned to Texas A&M University to serve as a 
member of the Office of the Commandant’s 
staff and as a cadet training officer for A&M’s 
internationally recognized Corps of Cadets. 
During this time, he worked closely with ca-
dets, providing guidance and direction to ca-
dets at the unit, major unit, and Corps levels. 
Madam Speaker, Dennis served his country 
proudly for many years, and his legacy will be 
forever woven into our American history. The 
passing of Lieutenant Commander Hassman 
will be deeply felt by all of those in the Texas 
A&M community and by his family and his 
friends. 
My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest and 
heartfelt condolences to the Hassman family. 
I have requested the United States flag be 
flown over our Nation’s Capitol to honor the 
life, legacy, and service of Lieutenant Com-
mander Dennis Hassman. 
As I close today, I ask all Americans to con-
tinue praying for our country during these dif-
ficult times, for our veterans, for our military 
men and women who protect us, and for our 
first responders who keep us safe at home.

HONORING MARY M. BLACK 
HON. GREG STANTON 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 30, 2020 
Mr. STANTON. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the life and legacy of Mary M. Black, 
who passed away on March 21, 2020. A 
woman of courage and conviction, Mary re-
lentlessly fought for a better life for our state’s 
children and families. For 35 years, she 
served as chief executive of Black Family and 
Child Services of Arizona, an agency she 
founded after encountering systemic inequities 
in our state’s child welfare system. Because of 
Mary’s work, the needs and hopes of families 
of all backgrounds have been elevated and 
heard, and we are better for her presence 
among us. 
Mary was a fearless champion of children. 
Having grown up in rural Louisiana with loving 
parents who endowed her with a strong sense 
of self-esteem, Mary’s work was grounded in 
her firm belief that all children deserve a safe 
and supportive home. After graduating from 
Grambling State University, Mary became a 
social worker in Arizona’s child welfare sys-
tem, where she became acutely aware of the 
hardships faced in trying to place Black chil-
dren in foster care and adoptive families. She 
responded with leadership and faith, dedi-
cating herself not only to finding loving and 
caring homes for Black children, but also de-
veloping policies and programs that valued 
children of color and treated all families with 
dignity and respect. Mary’s vision resulted in 
the founding of Black Family and Child Serv-
ices of Arizona, which has become one of the 
state’s most respected nonprofit social serv-
ices agencies. Since its inception, the agency 
has kept families together, found foster and 
adoptive homes for children in need, and cre-
ated prosperity and opportunity for Arizonans 
of all races and backgrounds. Mary and her 
pioneering work have been recognized numer-
ous times for its innovation and focus on 
human dignity. 
Mary’s passion and leadership have inspired 
Arizonans to do justice, to love kindness and 
to keep fighting to ensure all children grow up 
in safe and supportive homes. We join her 
family in grief and gratitude, thankful that we 
bore witness to her work in Arizona and con-
fident that her legacy will be felt for genera-
tions. Godspeed, Mary.

IN HONOR OF BISHOP L.D. 
SKINNER, SR. 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 30, 2020 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, it 
is with a heavy heart and solemn remem-
brance that I rise today to pay homage to an 
outstanding man of God, dedicated servant, 
and dear friend of longstanding, Bishop L.D. 
Skinner, Sr. Bishop Skinner transitioned from 
labor to reward on Saturday, July 18, 2020, at 
the age of 69. His homegoing service will be 
held on Friday, July 31, 2020, at the River Mill 
Event Centre in Columbus, Georgia. He 
leaves behind a loving family, a dedicated 
church family, and an appreciative community 
for his extraordinary life of serving God and 
humankind. 
Bishop L.D. Skinner, Sr. was born in Eliza-
beth City, North Carolina, to the union of Rich-
ard, Sr. and Alethia Bembry Skinner. He al-
ways had a thirst for knowledge and improving 
himself. A highly educated man, Bishop Skin-
ner graduated from the North Carolina College 
of Theology with a Bachelor of Arts in Biblical 
Studies, A Master of Arts in Theology, and a 
Doctor of Theology Degree. He also earned a 
Doctor of Divinity Degree from Christ United 
Theological School. 
He was a man of God who was devoted to 
his calling. He was the Founder and Senior 
Pastor of the Bread of Life Christian Center 
and the Founder and Presiding Prelate of Ex-
plosion Ministries Fellowship of Interdenomina-
tional Ministers. A gifted teacher and mentor, 
Bishop Skinner guided many in their ministe-
rial calling. 
But Bishop Skinner also knew that involve-
ment in his community was an integral part of 
his calling as a Minister of the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ. Accordingly, he was involved in 
many social and civic organizations that had 
as their purpose the uplift of humankind. He 
served as Vice President of the Columbus 
Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance, Vice 
President of the Columbus NAACP, Chaplain 
and Counselor at the House of Mercy, Volun-
teer Chaplain at Jack T. Rutledge Correctional 
Institution, a member of Dr. Creflo Dollar’s 
Ministerial Association, Board Member of the 
Columbus Salvation Army, the Columbus 
NAACP, and the Urban League of Greater Co-
lumbus. 
A man of many talents, he was also a gifted 
author. During his lifetime, he authored four

books to include: Overcoming Grasshopper 
Mentality; How to Whip Negative Thinking in 
Eleven Easy Steps; Prayer an Awesome 
Weapon; Encounters with God; and his final 
publication, Ordered Stops. These books help 
to impart his message as given by God to a 
broader audience as he impacted the world for 
Jesus Christ. 
Mother Teresa once said that ‘‘At the end of 
life we will be judged by whether we lived to 
the standard set by Jesus who said: ‘‘I was 
hungry, and you gave me something to eat. I 
was naked, and you clothed me, I was home-
less, and you took me in.’’ Bishop L.D. Skin-
ner, Sr. lived his life to help other people be-
cause of his love for Jesus Christ, and human-
kind is better because he traveled this way. 
Bishop Skinner accomplished much in his 
life, but none of it would have been possible 
with the Grace of God and the love and sup-
port of his wife, partner and co-laborer in the 
ministry, Lady Ruth McDaniel Skinner, his 
three sons, Darius, Darnell, and Darryl and his 
eight grandchildren. He will be greatly missed 
by his family but will also be missed by his 
community and all of those that he touched in 
his unique way. 
On a personal note, I will always appreciate 
the support that Bishop Skinner provided me 
over the years. As he did for so many others, 
his counsel and wisdom provided me with an 
unvarnished truth that helped me to deal with 
tough issues. He always had an open door 
and an open heart. For that, I will be forever 
grateful. 
Madam Speaker, my wife, Vivian and I 
along with countless others throughout Geor-
gia and the nation salute Bishop L.D. Skinner, 
Sr. for his distinguished accomplishments in 
the ministry and his humble service to human-
kind. I ask my colleagues in the House of 
Representatives to join us in extending our 
deepest sympathies to Bishop Skinner’s fam-
ily, friends, loved ones, and all those who 
mourn during this difficult time of bereave-
ment. We pray that they will be consoled and 
comforted by an abiding faith and the Holy 
Spirit in the days, weeks, and months ahead.

HONORING THE LIFE OF EDWIN H. 
COOPER 
HON. BILL FLORES 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 30, 2020 
Mr. FLORES. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Edwin H. Cooper of Robertson Coun-
ty, Texas. Edwin passed away on 29 April 
2020. 
Edwin was born 3 September 1930 to Mar-
garet and Leslie Cooper. He graduated from 
San Marcos High School in 1949 and enrolled 
in Texas A&M University, where he was a 
proud member of the fighting Texas Aggie 
band. 
While at Texas A&M, Cooper was also a 
member of the Alpha Zeta Fraternity (scho-
lastic) and was a distinguished student. 
During the summer of 1951, Edwin married 
his high school sweetheart, Peggy Jean Mar-
tin. 
In 1953, Edwin received a bachelor of 
science in wildlife management and was com-
missioned as a second lieutenant in the 
United States Army. He attended Armor Basic 
Camp in Fort Knox, Kentucky, before being 
assigned to the Second Armored Division in 
Baumholder, Germany. 
After his honorable discharge, Edwin re-
turned to Texas and his family to work as an 
Assistant Agriculture County Agent in Travis 
County. 
Edwin’s professional career combined his 
two loves: wildlife and Texas A&M University. 
Beginning as a specialist in wildlife conserva-
tion, he worked his way up to Director of Of-
fice School Relations and Coordinator of Spe-
cial Projects—Education Information Services, 
all at Texas A&M University. 
Edwin’s professional experience also in-
cluded specialist in wildlife conservation at the 
Texas Agriculture Extension Service, Assistant 
to President Earl Rudder, Director of Civilian 
Student Activities, Assistant to President Jack 
K. Williams, Director of Admissions; Dean of 
Admissions and Records, Director—Office of 
School Relations, and Coordinator of Special 
Projects—Education Information Services, all 
at Texas A&M University. 
Mr. Cooper is the author of four books, in-
cluding 
one 
entitled: 
‘‘Forty 
Years 
at 
Aggieland,’’ published in 2013, which detailed 
his career at Texas A&M. 
Upon his retirement, Edwin and his wife, 
Peggy, moved to Camp Creek Lake in Robert-
son County, where he continued to enjoy fish-
ing, hunting, and spending time outdoors with 
his family and friends. 
Edwin’s civic involvement included Vice 
President of the Bryan-College Station Jay-
cees, President of the Brazos County A&M 
Club, Councilman of the Texas A&M Associa-
tion of Former Students, and Vice President of 
the Bryan-College Station Chamber of Com-
merce, and Board of Directors of the Aggie 
Band Association. 
Mr. Cooper has served as a member of the 
Board of Trustees of the A&M Consolidated 
Independent School District, chairman of the 
Board of the St. Joseph Hospital, Class Agent 
of the Texas A&M Class of 1953, President of 
the Executive Committee of College Board- 
Southwest Region, and Trustee to College 
Board. He also served 2 years as chairman of 
the National Membership Committee of Col-
lege Board. Edwin was enthusiastically in-
volved in Methodist church activities in Bryan- 
College Station and in Franklin, Texas. 
Madam Speaker, Edwin served his country 
proudly for many years, and his legacy will be 
forever woven into our American history. 
Edwin was not only a public servant; he was 
a proud Texas Aggie, a devout Methodist, and 
a committed family man. I will always remem-
ber Mr. Cooper because his signature is af-
fixed to my Texas A&M diploma. 
My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest and 
heartfelt condolences to the Cooper family. I 
have requested that a United States flag be 
flown over our Nation’s Capitol to honor the 
life, legacy, and service of Edwin H. Cooper. 
As I close today, I urge all Americans to 
continue to pray for our country during these 
difficult times, for our veterans, for our military 
men and women who protect us, and for our 
first responders who keep us safe at home. 
HONORING SEVEN SPRINGFIELD 
POLICE OFFICERS 
HON. BILLY LONG 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 30, 2020 
Mr. LONG. Madam Speaker, today I rise to 
pay tribute to seven fine Springfield police offi-
cers after 25 years of service to their commu-
nity. These men have dedicated their lives to 
serving and protecting Springfield, and their 
absence will be felt throughout the Springfield 
Police Department. They are shining examples 
of what it means to wear the badge and have 
served as strong role models for their fellow 
officers. 
Maj. Greg Higdon, Sgt. Justin Gargus, Cpl. 
Chris Welsh, Capt. Kevin Grizzell, Lt. Chris 
Wells, Lt. Mark Schindler, and Sgt. David 
Stone are members of the Springfield Police 
Department’s 39th Police Academy and have 
each earned the Springfield Police Depart-
ment’s Life-time Achievement Award. These 
men have not hesitated to risk their own safe-
ty for the good of their community, and Spring-
field is better for it. 
Whether acting as the department’s top 
commanders, the leading expert in gang activ-
ity, or head of the Zone 1 Patrol Division, 
these men have enriched and protected their 
community. The city of Springfield is grateful 
for their service and I join Springfield residents 
in wishing each of them the very best as they 
embark on their next chapters.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E710 
July 30, 2020 
Dr. McIntyre was born on 13 May 1949, in 
Houston, Texas, to David and Mary McIntyre. 
From a young age, Dave felt a sense of duty 
and a call to selfless service which guided him 
throughout his life. He followed this call to the 
United States Military Academy at West Point 
where he was commissioned as armor officer 
in 1971. Following graduation from Airborne 
School and U.S. Army Ranger School, Dave 
was assigned as a scout platoon leader and 
jumpmaster in the 82nd Airborne Division at 
Fort Bragg in North Carolina. 
Over 30 years of dedicated service, Dave 
traveled all over the United States and to 
more than 45 foreign countries. He served 
with an armored cavalry reconnaissance unit 
at the Czechoslovakian border, flew to the 
base of Mt. Everest in a Russian Mi–17 Hip 
helicopter, participated in the changing of the 
guard with the Gurkha Rifles at the Khyber 
Pass, and led a delegation to Angkor Wat. 
In addition to his many years of service in 
the field, Dave placed great focus on aca-
demics and serving our country through edu-
cation. He graduated with honors from the 
Command and General Staff College and 
earned his first master’s degree from Auburn 
University. He then went on to serve as a pro-
fessor of English literature at West Point while 
earning a Ph.D. from the University of Mary-
land. After 30 years of service, Dave retired as 
a colonel from his post as Dean of Faculty 
and Academics at the National War College in 
Washington, D.C. 
In June 2008 Dave was appointed to the 
National Security Education Board by Presi-
dent George W. Bush and confirmed by the 
Senate. He served on this board for 4 years 
until 2012. From 2010 to 2014 he was a Dis-
tinguished Visiting Fellow at the Homeland Se-
curity Studies and Analysis Institute in Wash-
ington, D.C. His time in D.C. also included 
providing congressional testimony and national 
strategic documents for the Army Chief of 
Staff and serving on the National Board of Di-
rectors of the InfraGard National Members Alli-
ance. In addition to serving on many other 
boards and committees, he also served as a 
board member of the Homeland Security and 
Defense Education Consortium. 
Following his retirement, David accepted a 
position as a professor at Texas A&M Univer-
sity through his role as founding director of the 
Texas A&M Bush School of Government and 
Public Service graduate Certificate in Home-
land Security program, his legacy of expertise 
in homeland security will live long through the 
knowledge and expertise he shared with his 
students. 
Also, while serving as a professor at Texas 
A&M, Dave continued to advise the U.S. Gov-
ernment on many projects and published a se-
ries of textbooks on homeland security. Dave 
also spoke at conferences and events as a 
premier subject matter expert of homeland se-
curity. 
Dave’s life was dedicated to his call to serv-
ice, and through this journey he met his wife, 
Cathy. Together they raised two sons who 
share their father’s spirit of service. He rel-
ished spending time with his family and seven 
grandchildren at home in College Station, 
Texas. 
I first met Colonel McIntyre when he and I 
ran for this congressional seat in 2010. As I 
got to know him, I found him to be a fierce 
competitor, a policy expert, a committed public 
servant, a man of integrity, and an ultimate 
gentleman. I can tell you firsthand that we will 
miss his contributions to Brazos Valley and to 
our Nation. 
Madam Speaker, Dr. David McIntyre’s life 
was defined by his outstanding accomplish-
ments as Army officer, professor, an expert in 
homeland security, as well as his commitment 
to his family and friends. He will be forever re-
membered as a true leader in his field, a de-
voted husband, father, and friend. 
My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest and 
heartfelt condolences to the McIntyre family. I 
have requested that the United States flag be 
flown over our Nation’s Capitol to honor the 
life, legacy, and service of Dr. David McIntyre. 
As I close today, I urge all Americans to 
continue praying for our country during these 
difficult times, for our veterans, for our military 
men and women who protect us, and for our 
responders who keep us safe at home.

HONORING DEACON WILLIAM 
FRANCIS XAVIER KANE 
HON. SETH MOULTON 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 30, 2020 
Mr. MOULTON. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
commemorate the life and service of an Amer-
ican patriot and decorated Army veteran, Dea-
con William Francis Xavier Kane. Kane was 
an Army intelligence officer during the Vietnam 
War, serving in small communities alongside a 
South Vietnamese battalion. Kane was seri-
ously injured in the line of duty, leaving him 
hospitalized. Due to Kane’s valor during the 
war, he was presented with a Bronze Star and 
Soldier’s Medal for Heroism. In the years fol-
lowing his brave service in the Army, Kane 
went on to have a long career as a special 
agent in the FBI. 
Kane’s service to our country did not stop 
with his astounding career in the military and 
FBI. After four years studying at St. John’s 
Seminary located in Brighton, Massachusetts, 
Kane was ordained a Permanent Deacon for 
the Archdiocese of Boston. After devoting him-
self to a life of spirituality, he then found his 
true vocation. Serving as the director of prison 
ministry for the Archdiocese of Boston, Kane 
provided spiritual support and comfort to those 
in need during their incarceration. Kane also 
took up Spanish to have better communication 
with the many Spanish-speaking inmates he 
assisted. Kane was once asked what led him 
to this type of work, and he responded with a 
quote by Irish poet Bobby Sands: ‘‘There is no 
place more lonely than the prison cell.’’ 
In 2001, Kane founded the Holy Family Par-
ish Mission after a trip to the Dominican Re-
public. Kane believed that mission work could 
help individuals empathize with those who are 
impoverished, and in turn, deepen their capac-
ity for compassion and love. In 2016, Kane re-
ceived the John C. DeDeyn Jr. Achievement 
Award from his alma mater, Niagara Univer-
sity, in recognition of his service to others. 
Madam Speaker, Deacon William Kane 
lived a life of service for the United States 
government and its citizens. The Coronavirus 
pandemic has claimed the lives of more than 
150,000 Americans. Deacon Kane is one of 
the 2,083 veterans counted among that total. 
Kane was a dementia patient under the care 
of the VA at the time of the Coronavirus 
breakout. He passed away May 10th. The vi-
sion of the VA is ‘‘to provide veterans the 
world-class benefits and services they have 
earned—and to do so by adhering to the high-
est standards of compassion, commitment, ex-
cellence, professionalism, integrity, account-
ability, and stewardship.’’ I believe it is evident 
that they have fallen short in their duties. In a 
VA where all but one of the patients in a spe-
cific unit have contracted this generation’s 
most contagious virus, it is clear that adequate 
protections were not provided to Deacon Kane 
as well as the other patients in the unit. 
As a member of the Armed Services Com-
mittee and an advocate for veteran’s rights, I 
call upon the House to investigate this occur-
rence further and remain committed to using 
all of the powers this office affords me to pro-
tect veterans, and all Americans, from this 
virus and the leaders in this country who have 
failed to accept the responsibility to fight it.
