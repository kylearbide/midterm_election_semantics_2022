DESIGNATION OF THE SPEAKER

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
In 
a 
world 
where 
weakness 
is 
shunned and flaws disparaged, we pray 
to You, O Lord, that You would uphold 
and redeem our imperfect existence 
with Your perfect power and loving 
presence. 
There is not one of us who is not 
found wanting according to the world’s 
measurement of perfection, but in You 
we find our strength. There are holes in 
our lives which we attempt to fill with 
futile effort, but there is not one aspect 
of our being that You do not stand 
ready to enhance with a capability be-
yond that which anyone can possibly 
imagine. 
Your power is released in our weak-
ness. Your perfect plan is made evident 
where we flounder. 
And so before You, O Lord, we lay be-
fore You everything that holds us 
back—our fear of failure, our sense of 
inadequacy, our paralysis of faith. 
In Your mercy may we boast not of 
our own competence and ability, but of 
the work You are accomplishing in us 
and through us despite even our best 
efforts. 
In this may we find our reason for 
being and rejoice in the privilege we 
have to serve You in this time and this 
place. 
In Your powerful name we pray. 
Amen.

INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT 
OF COLUMBIA CODE RETURNING 
CITIZENS COORDINATION ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 6, 2022 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I 
rise to introduce the District of Columbia Code 
Returning Citizens Coordination Act. I intro-
duced a similar version of this bill earlier this 
year. This bill would require the Federal Bu-
reau of Prisons (BOP) to provide information 
to the District of Columbia government on indi-
viduals convicted of felonies under D.C. law in 
BOP custody. Currently, BOP provides no in-
formation to D.C. on these individuals, even 
immediately before release, which inhibits re-
entry, increases recidivism and harms public 
safety. 
Federal law requires BOP to incarcerate in-
dividuals convicted of felonies under D.C. law. 
There are currently 3,200 such individuals in 
BOP custody, and they are located in prisons 
throughout the United States. This unique cus-
tody arrangement creates several obstacles to 
successful reentry, including information shar-
ing among agencies. 
BOP asserts that federal privacy laws pro-
hibit it from providing any information to D.C. 
on these individuals, which prevents D.C. from 
having services ready for them when they re-
turn from prison. Yet, studies consistently 
show the importance of health care, housing, 
education, job training and substance use dis-
order treatment for successful reentry. 
This bill would require BOP to provide D.C. 
two types of information on each individual 
convicted of a D.C. Code felony in BOP cus-
tody. Every 90 days, BOP would provide the 
name, age, Federal Register Number, facility 
where housed and the scheduled release 
date. Upon D.C.’s request, BOP would provide 
D.C. the same information that BOP provides 
to the Court Services and Offender Super-
vision Agency for the District of Columbia 
(CSOSA) on these individuals, such as their 
release plan. CSOSA is a federal agency that 
supervises individuals convicted of D.C. Code 
felonies on supervised release and parole. 
D.C. would be allowed to provide the bio-
graphical information only to counsel for the 
individuals, and to organizations that provide 
legal representation to individuals in criminal 
or post-conviction matters, or in matters re-
lated to reentry. D.C. would not be allowed to 
provide any of the other information, and D.C. 
law enforcement agencies would not have ac-
cess to any of the information. 
The overwhelming majority of people in pris-
on return home. I hope everyone agrees on 
the importance of successful reentry. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation. 
HONORING ERIC CHILDS OF 
MIND’S EYE COMICS 
HON. ANGIE CRAIG 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 6, 2022 
Ms. CRAIG. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
honor of National Small Business Week, May 
2–5, 2022, and to thank Eric Childs of Mind’s 
Eye Comics. Eric’s dedication to his commu-
nity in Burnsville is what fuels Minnesota’s 
Second Congressional District. 
Mind’s Eye Comics was established in 1998 
in Eagan, Minnesota. A dedicated and long-
time customer, Eric stepped in to continue the 
business after the original owner retired from 
the comic book business. He has continued to 
ensure that Mind’s Eye welcomes all levels of 
comic enthusiasts in the Second Congres-
sional District, Minnesota, and beyond. 
Small businesses like Mind’s Eye Comics 
are the backbone of our economy. I’m proud 
that Eric is a member of my Small Business 
Taskforce. I’m thankful for his expertise and 
guidance as we work to shape policies to ben-
efit and strengthen our small business econ-
omy.

GETTING RID OF ATF’S ILLEGAL 
LISTS OF LAW-ABIDING AMERI-
CANS 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 6, 2022 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise to de-
mand that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, 
Firearms and Explosives (ATF) destroy their il-
legal lists of law-abiding gun-owning American 
citizens. 
The Firearms Owners’ Protections Act of 
1986, 18 U.S.C. 926(A)(3), says that ‘‘No such 
rule or regulation prescribed after the date of 
the enactment of the Firearms Owners’ Pro-
tection Act may require that records required 
to be maintained under this chapter or any 
portion of the contents of such records, be re-
corded at or transferred to a facility owned, 
managed, or controlled by the United States 
or any State or any political subdivision there-
of, nor that any system of registration of fire-
arms, firearms owners, or firearms trans-
actions or dispositions be established.’’ There 
could not be a clearer prohibition on lists of 
gun owners. 
However, incredibly ATF has 920,664,765 
records. And 94 percent of those records are 
digitized. But never fear, we must trust ATF’s 
word that these records are ‘‘nonsearchable.’’ 
But it begs the question; why have a database 
if it is unsearchable? Their excuse is ludi-
crous. This is a gun registry of lawful gun- 
owning citizens clearly prohibited by federal 
law. 
And they want more people on the list. The 
current process is already illegal and unconsti-
tutional, as all firearms dealers are required to 
turn over EVERY record to the ATF when they 
lose their federal license. But now, the Biden 
administration’s new regulations require that 
ALL records be kept. 
ATF has engaged in another troubling un-
constitutional action—this time a violation of 
due process. Congressional candidate Laura 
Loomer was never notified that the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) found her pos-
session of a firearm a violation of federal law. 
The only reason she became aware of the 
FBI’s decision was due to the fact that she 
made several inquiries after being denied a 
concealed carry permit. 
In other words, the federal government did 
not tell Ms. Loomer that she was illegally own-
ing firearms—a clear violation of due process. 
DOJ has still not yet responded to a letter I 
sent them over six months ago asking for clar-
ification on this issue. 
The ATF is a rogue control agency violating 
American rights at every opportunity. They do 
not just want every gun serialized—they even 
want gun parts serialized. And they cleverly 
changed the definition of machine gun so that 
more guns would be considered illegal. 
I have introduced a bill, the No Gun Lists 
Act, that would force ATF to destroy all the 
ATF’s illegal lists of gun-owning Americans. 
And the creation of any new lists is expressly 
prohibited. Furthermore, the bill would allow 
negatively affected individuals to sue the ATF 
for damages done by the agency in violation 
of the bill. 
These abuses of the Constitution—whether 
the Second Amendment or due process— 
must be opposed at all costs.

HONORING THE 18TH 
INTERNATIONAL VEENA FESTIVAL 
HON. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 6, 2022 
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Madam Speaker, 
today 
I 
wish 
to 
recognize 
the 
Sri 
Annamacharya Project of North America 
(SAPNA), along with Veena Council Global, in 
commemoration of the 18th International 
Veena Festival. SAPNA was conceived as the 
Saint Annamacharya Project USA by Dr. 
Sriram and Mrs. Saradapurna Sonty in 1989. 
The International Veena Festival presents 
over 50 Saraswathi Veenas—an ancient In-
dian string instrument originating in Vedic 
times and referenced in Vedic Scripture from 
thousands of years ago. Veena music is 
known to bring about spiritual healing, a feel-
ing of communion, and a connection with a 
higher power. 
Through the International Veena Festival, 
SAPNA seeks to sustain classical music; to 
promote innovative music traditions on a glob-
al stage; and to foster friendship, peace, har-
mony, and universal understanding through 
music in today’s turbulent times. 
Madam Speaker, I celebrate the work of 
SAPNA to honor the cultural heritage of more 
than 4 million Indian-Americans, uplift tradi-
tional Indian artists, and bridge cultural divides 
through music.

III, Debbie and David Cook, and Fritz Olthof. 
In addition, Tri-State Industries will be pre-
sented the Enterprise of the Year Award. For 
their outstanding contributions to the commu-

2022, at Avalon Manor in Merrillville, Indiana. 
The Honorable Eric Holcomb, Governor of the 
State of Indiana, will serve as the keynote 
speaker for this special event. 
Brian Boomsma is the president of Dutch 
Farms, Inc., which was founded in 1987 by 
Brian and his brother, Bruce. In the beginning, 
Dutch Farms sold farm fresh eggs to local gro-
cery stores and markets throughout the 
Chicagoland area. Over time, the company ex-
panded its product line to include dairy, meat, 
juice, baked goods, and more. Today, the 
family-owned business operates out of a 
400,000 square foot campus in the Pullman 
District of Chicago. Under the remarkable 
leadership of Brian, Dutch Farms currently dis-
tributes its products in 40 States and 15 coun-
tries. Dutch Farms is committed to giving back 
to the community through its support of var-
ious organizations, including food banks, youth 
groups, veterans’ groups, and soup kitchens. 
Napoleon Branford III is a Northwest Indiana 
native hailing from East Chicago. Napoleon is 
a graduate of East Chicago Roosevelt High 
School and played on the celebrated Rough 
Riders basketball team that won the State title 
in 1970. For this accomplishment, Napoleon 
was inducted into the Indiana Basketball Hall 
of Fame. Later in life, Napoleon established 
and led the successful investment and bank-
ing firm, Siebert Branford Shank & Co., LLC, 
and served as its chairman from 1998 to 
2016. Currently, he is chairman and CEO of 
his own company, NBIII Entertainment. He is 
also one of the chief financial strategists for 
Team Harris, LLC. Napoleon has given of his 
time and efforts to numerous charitable orga-
nizations and foundations throughout his life-
time including, but not limited to, the California 
Healthcare Foundation, the Boy Scouts of 
America, and the American Heart Association. 
Dave and Debbie Cook are the founders of 
Hoosier Bat Company, located in Valparaiso, 
Indiana. Dave Cook worked as a scout for the 
New York Yankees, and during that time, he 
observed players struggling to transition from 
using aluminum bats to wooden bats. Seeing 
the need and the opportunity, Dave painstak-
ingly created a patented design, a durable 
wood bat that helped to ease this transition. In 
1991, Dave and Debbie founded Hoosier Bat 
Company, which they continue to operate and 
grow today. The company sells its bats 
throughout the United States and worldwide. 
Hoosier Bat Company caters to all levels of 
the game, from Little League to the major 
leagues, and they have made bats for many 
successful Major League Baseball players. 
The Cooks are involved in numerous chari-
table endeavors, and they continue to donate 
bats to events and organizations that give 
back to the community. 
Fritz Olthof is the founder of Olthof Homes, 
which he established in 1961. Fritz learned the 
basics of building a strong work ethic at a 
young age, which he credits to his upbringing 
and his father, in particular. Fritz’s first project 
was a seven-flat building in Lansing, Illinois, 
and he moved full steam ahead from that mo-
ment on. Currently, Olthof Homes is based in 
Saint John, Indiana, and has an office in Indi-
anapolis as well. Olthof Homes continues to 
grow and expand building new home commu-
nities throughout Northwest Indiana, Northeast 
Indiana, and Central Indiana. Fritz is proud to 
have all four of his sons and his grandson 
working for the business. The company has 
been proud of their dedication to support local 
charitable organizations, including the Food 
Bank of Northwest Indiana and Habitat for Hu-
manity, to name a few. 
The recipient of the Enterprise of the Year 
Award is Tri-State Industries, a steel manufac-
turing and fabrication company based in Ham-
mond, Indiana. The company was founded in 
1980 by Don Keller and initially made indus-
trial pipe glides and slides. Today, the com-
pany is a contract manufacturer for large enti-
ties in the railcar, construction, and mobile 
trailer industries across Indiana, Illinois, and 
Wisconsin. Additionally, the Keller family 
founded Tri-State Automation, a business that 
advances the use of robotics in manufacturing. 
This truly innovative technology produces ro-
bots that weld, haul materials, and serve other 
customized industrial functions. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my 
other distinguished colleagues join me in com-
mending these dedicated leaders and organi-
zations upon their induction into the Northwest 
Indiana Business and Industry Hall of Fame. 
For their influence, innovation, and dedication 
to the community of Northwest Indiana and 
beyond, the inductees are worthy of the high-
est praise.

2022 CONGRESSIONAL ART 
COMPETITION 
HON. MICHAEL F. DOYLE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 6, 2022 
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
artistic ability of a young student from my Con-
gressional District, Lillian Spencer from the 
Pittsburgh 
Creative 
and 
Performing 
Arts 
School. 
Ms. Spencer is the winner of the 2022 18th 
Congressional District of Pennsylvania’s High 
School Art Competition, ‘‘An Artistic Dis-
covery.’’ 
Ms. Spencer’s artwork, an acrylic painting 
entitled ‘‘Surmount,’’ was selected from a 
number of outstanding entries in this year’s 
competition. 
In fact, 27 works from 8 different schools in 
Pennsylvania’s 18th Congressional District 
were submitted to our panel of respected local 
artists. 
It is a real tribute to Ms. Spencer’s skill and 
vision that their work was chosen as the win-
ner of this year’s competition. 
I should add that Ms. Spencer took second 
place in this competition last year with a color 
pencil composition entitled ‘‘Seeing Eye to 
Eye.’’ 
Ms. Spencer’s artwork will represent the 
18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania in 
the national exhibit of high school students’ 
artwork that will be displayed in the United 
States Capitol over the coming year. 
I encourage my colleagues as well as any 
visitor to Capitol Hill to view Ms. Spencer’s art-
work, along with the winning entries from the 
high school art contests held in other Con-
gressional Districts, which will be on display in 
the Capitol tunnel. 
It is amazing to walk through this corridor 
and see the interpretation of life through the 
eyes of these young artists from all across our 
country. 
Hanna Paras from the Pittsburgh Creative 
and Performing Arts School was awarded sec-
ond place for their acrylic painting entitled 
‘‘Self-Healing.’’ 
Rebecca Carter from the Pittsburgh Creative 
and Performing Arts School received third 
place for their photograph entitled ‘‘Refracted.’’

HONORING JACK KOLB-WILLIAMS 
OF THE GARAGE 
HON. ANGIE CRAIG 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 6, 2022 
Ms. CRAIG. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
honor of National Small Business Week, May 
2–5, 2022, and to thank Jack Kolb-Williams of 
The Garage. Jack’s dedication to his commu-
nity in Burnsville is what fuels Minnesota’s 
Second Congressional District. 
The Garage has supported small, local art-
ists of all ages throughout the Second Con-
gressional District and Minnesota for more 
than two decades. They provide an important 
creative and cultural space for the community 
for all ages to enjoy local music. 
Small businesses like The Garage are the 
backbone of our economy. I’m proud that Jack 
is a member of my Small Business Taskforce. 
I’m thankful for his expertise and guidance as 
we work to shape policies to benefit and 
strengthen our small business economy.

HONORING SAMUEL BRUCE, JR. 
HON. SHEILA CHERFILUS-McCORMICK 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 6, 2022 
Mrs. 
CHERFILUS-MCCORMICK. 
Madam 
Speaker, I include in the RECORD the following 
Proclamation honoring the life of Samuel 
Bruce, Jr. 
Whereas, on behalf of the Congress of the 
United States and the United States of Amer-
ica, want the family of Samuel Bruce, Jr. to 
know that we all mourn the passing of a tal-
ented young man. We recognize him as a be-
loved member of our South Florida community 
and extend our deepest condolences. 
Whereas, Bruce, helped the Raiders win 
back-to-back state titles in high school, 
amassing more than 1,300 receiving yards 
and 21 touchdowns. He later signed with the 
Hurricanes of the University of Miami to further 
his education in the state he loved. 
Whereas, Sam Bruce became a giant in our 
community, we now honor his memory and 
the hard work and determination he stood for. 
As he demonstrated throughout his life, we all 
need to be more like him and wear our hearts 
on our shelves.

SUPPORTING H.R. 3525, THE COM-
MISSION TO STUDY THE POTEN-
TIAL CREATION OF A NATIONAL 
MUSEUM 
OF 
ASIAN 
PACIFIC 
AMERICAN HISTORY AND CUL-
TURE ACT 
HON. ZOE LOFGREN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 6, 2022 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
support of H.R. 3525, the Commission to 
Study the Potential Creation of a National Mu-
seum of Asian Pacific American History and 
Culture Act. 
I am proud to represent a district that is 
home to hundreds of thousands of Asian Pa-
cific Americans with the largest concentration 
of Vietnamese-Americans in the country. For 
years, I’ve seen firsthand how our Asian Pa-
cific American community embodies the Amer-
ican experience. That is why, as chairperson 
of the Committee on House Administration, I 
convened hearing in 2020 to examine a pre-
vious version of this bill. It is also why, during 
this Congress, I have worked to ensure this 
bill made it to the House Floor for a vote. 
During our 2020 hearing, witnesses testified 
to the troubling lack of knowledge of Asian Pa-
cific American history and culture among 
American students and associated that lack of 
knowledge with a shortage of exposure, rather 
than with a shortage of Asian Pacific American 
contributions to the Nation. For example, wit-
nesses noted—among many other startling 
datapoints—only 3 percent of sites in the Na-
tional Register of Historic Places are associ-
ated with Asian Pacific American history, and 
studies of U.S. history textbooks show a 
shocking lack of content on Asian Pacific 
Americans. This is disconcerting, as Asian Pa-
cific Americans have been in the United 
States since the early 19th century and, today, 
are the fastest growing demographic in the 
country. Asian-Americans built the Trans-
continental Railroad and much of our Nation’s 
agricultural infrastructure, fought in the Civil 
War, helped lead the fight for farmworkers’ 
rights and made key breakthroughs in atomic 
science and more. 
Unfortunately, notwithstanding all the ways 
in which Asian Pacific Americans have 
strengthened the United States, the commu-
nity has repeatedly been subject to cruelty. 
From the Chinese Exclusion Act and Japa-
nese internment to the spike of racism and vi-
olence we have all witnessed over the past 
several years, America must do better by the 
Asian Pacific American community. We must 
do everything we can to honor the history and 
culture of Asian-Americans. I can think of few 
better ways to do that than a museum dedi-
cated to their story. By establishing a commis-
sion to study the potential creation of an Asian 
Pacific American museum, we will be taking a 
meaningful step toward achieving that goal. 
I strongly support H.R. 3525 and encourage 
my colleagues to do so as well.

HONORING SENATOR AND 
DIPLOMAT ROBERT C. KRUEGER 
HON. JOAQUIN CASTRO 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 6, 2022 
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the life of former U.S. Am-
bassador and Senator Robert C. Krueger, who 
passed away on April 30, 2022, at the age of 
86. 
Born 
September 
19, 
1935, 
in 
New 
Braunfels, Texas, Krueger earned degrees 
from Southern Methodist University, Duke, and 
Oxford. His passion for education would play 
an integral role in his professional life, and he 
spent most of his career in academia—first as 
a professor of English literature and later 
teaching government and ethics—at Duke Uni-
versity, the University of Texas at Austin, Rice 
University, Oxford University, Texas State Uni-
versity, and Texas Tech University. 
In 1974, the people of Texas’s 21st Con-
gressional District elected Krueger to be their 
U.S. Representative, and he was voted after 
his first term as the most effective freshman 
Member. Furthermore, in 1976, he was the 
only other Texan to stand and speak in sup-
port of Congresswoman Barbara Jordan’s 
amendment to the 1965 Voting Rights Act. As 
the late Congresswoman said, ‘‘He believed 
that democracy includes everybody.’’ After two 
terms in the House, Krueger was appointed by 
President Jimmy Carter to serve as U.S. Am-
bassador-at-Large and Coordinator for Mexi-
can Affairs. He remained in that role through 
the end of the Carter Presidency. 
In 1990, Texas voters elected Krueger to 
the Texas Railroad Commission, a powerful 
entity that regulates oil and gas. Two years 
later, Texas Governor Ann Richards appointed 
him to fill the vacant Senate seat left by Sen-
ator Lloyd Bentsen. In the Senate, Krueger in-
troduced anti-stalking legislation, and would

fight to strengthen healthcare for veterans, 
combat pollution in the Gulf of Mexico, and 
end Federal subsidies for tobacco, among 
other priorities. 
After Krueger’s Senate term ended, Presi-
dent Bill Clinton appointed him Ambassador to 
Burundi. At the time, Burundi was suffering 
from intense violence and political conflict, and 
the assignment represented deep faith in 
Krueger’s diplomatic abilities. Krueger served 
in Burundi until 1995, when his convoy was 
ambushed by gunmen in an assassination at-
tempt due to his vocal opposition to the geno-
cide. On his courage, President Bill Clinton re-
marked, ‘‘ . . . if we didn’t have brave people 
there, like Ambassador Bob Krueger, it would 
be even harder to avoid human tragedy.’’ 
From 1996 to 1999, Krueger served as U.S. 
Ambassador to Botswana and later as a Spe-
cial U.S. Representative to the Southern Afri-
can Development Community (SADC) from 
1998 to 2000. After an accomplished career in 
public service, Krueger returned to academia 
and retired in 2017, living out his days in New 
Braunfels at the same house in which he grew 
up. 
Madam Speaker, I join my fellow Texans in 
mourning the loss of a stalwart patriot and 
public servant. Senator Bob Krueger’s career 
took him around the world, but he never lost 
sight of his deep roots in Texas. My thoughts 
are with his wife of 39 years, Kathleen, his 
children, Mariana, Sarah and Christian, and all 
those who knew and loved him.

HONORING JOHN SWANEY OF 
PRECISION SIGNS AND IMAGING 
HON. ANGIE CRAIG 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Ms. CRAIG. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
honor of National Small Business Week, May 
2–5, 2022, and to thank John Swaney of Pre-
cision Signs and Imaging. Jack’s dedication to 
his community in Burnsville is what fuels Min-
nesota’s Second Congressional District. 
Precision Signs and Imaging has provided 
important services to business, large and 
small, throughout Minnesota. John has led 
Precision Signs and Imaging to not only busi-
ness success, but also in serving their local 
community. John and Precision Signs and Im-
aging showcase the impact that small busi-
nesses can have on their local community. 
Small businesses like Precision Signs and 
Imaging are the backbone of our economy. I’m 
proud that John is a member of my Small 
Business Taskforce. I’m thankful for his exper-
tise and guidance as we work to shape poli-
cies to benefit and strengthen our small busi-
ness economy.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF NICK TULLIER, EAST BATON 
ROUGE SHERIFF’S DEPUTY 
HON. CLAY HIGGINS 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 6, 2022 
Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor the life and service of 
my Thin Blue Line brother Nick Tullier. 
Nick served his state and community honor-
ably as a patrol deputy with the East Baton 
Rouge Sheriff’s Department. 
A member of the Thin Blue Line for nearly 
two decades, Nick Tullier was critically injured 
in the line of duty on July 17, 2016. While re-
sponding to a call in Baton Rouge, Nick and 
his fellow deputies were ambushed in a tar-
geted attack against law enforcement. 
Nick was shot three times. By all accounts, 
he was not supposed to live. He did. 
Though paralyzed due to the injuries, Nick 
defied every expectation over the last 6 years. 
He was a fighter. His spirit was strong, and 
he never gave up. Nick fought until the very 
end. 
On May 5, 2022, Nick Tullier’s watch ended. 
We all mourn his passing. However, we also 
celebrate Nick’s life. 
‘‘Greater love hath no man than this, that a 
man lay down his life for his friends.’’—John 
15:13 KJV 
Nick was selfless and acted with love for his 
fellow man. He put his own life on the line to 
protect the community he had sworn to serve. 
I am blessed to have known Nick and to 
have shared a few brief hours in the course of 
his journey. He is survived by his parents, his 
two sons, two brothers, and five nephews. 
They are all in our prayers. 
Many times, I have prayed for Nick, for his 
family, and for healing. Our prayers are with 
them now in this time of mourning. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the citizens of 
the State of Louisiana, I pay tribute to the life, 
commitment, and sacrifice of Nick Tullier. May 
his legacy and his service to the Thin Blue 
Line never be forgotten.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF 
SAVANNAH A. VAN DYKE BELLO 
HON. MARK DeSAULNIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 6, 2022 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize long-time community mem-
ber Savannah Van Dyke Bello, as she cele-
brates her 100th birthday. 
Savannah was born in Idabel, Oklahoma to 
Richard and Rebecca Van Dyke. Savannah 
later moved to California where she met her 
husband, Albert Bello, and the couple became 
parents to three children. 
Throughout her life, Savannah has dem-
onstrated her dedication to public service and 
civic education. After overcoming tuberculosis 
herself and noting the stigma behind the dis-
ease, Savannah enrolled in nursing school. 
She worked as a nurse at the Contra Costa 
County Medical Center from 1961 until her re-
tirement in 1984. Additionally, throughout the 
1960s and 1970s, Savannah was involved in 
the civil rights movement. She was and con-
tinues to be passionate about helping the 
Black community to connect with their history. 
Savannah has shown her passion for bettering 
her community in many ways, including as a 
member of the Richmond Congress of Racial 
Equality (CORE) in the 1960s, working with 
the American Red Cross for over 20 years, 
and engaging in local, statewide, and national 
elections. Savannah is also a writer and her 
book, ‘‘Savannah . . . Unexpected Turns’’ de-
scribes 20th century American history through 
her own lens. 
In her personal life, Savannah is a proud 
Catholic and attends Saint David of Wales 
Catholic Church in Richmond, California. She 
loves attending Bible study to connect more 
with her faith. Savannah also enjoys quilting, 
writing poetry, and spending time with her 
three children, three granddaughters, and nine 
great-grandchildren. 
Savannah is a leader in our community and 
is respected for her intellect and compassion. 
Please join me in congratulating Savannah on 
her 100th birthday and her lifetime of service.

HONORING 
MARTHA 
HEIDE 
FOR 
HER SERVICE TO THE PEOPLE 
OF SOUTHWEST OHIO 
HON. MICHAEL R. TURNER 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 6, 2022 
Mr. TURNER. Madam Speaker, I want to 
pay tribute to a long-time staff member and 
dear friend, Mrs. Marty Heide, who left my of-
fice at the end of April to begin her well-de-
served retirement. 
Marty and I have worked together for over 
33 years. She started her career as an em-
ployee at my downtown Dayton, Ohio law firm, 
and worked in my office during my two terms 
as mayor of Dayton. 
After I was elected to Congress in 2003, 
Marty spent the next 19 years serving the citi-
zens of Southwest Ohio as a caseworker in 
my district office, and as District Outreach and 
Director of Special Events for Greene County. 
Marty Heide has touched the hearts of ev-
eryone who has had the good fortune to know 
her and to work with her. She has earned a 
reputation as an experienced, knowledgeable 
and sympathetic caseworker who never hesi-
tated to go above and beyond the call of duty 
to help a constituent, listen to their concerns, 
work toward a solution—and more often than 
not, a successful outcome. 
Marty was responsible for organizing the an-
nual Congressional Art Competition, to show-
case the artistic talents of high school stu-
dents in the Dayton area. She also directed 
my Military Service Academy Board, spending 
countless hours mentoring some of our best 
and brightest young people, and selecting the 
future leaders of our Armed Forces for nomi-
nations to our Nation’s military academies. 
Marty has helped literally thousands of my 
constituents cut through the maze of the Fed-
eral bureaucracy—whether they were seniors 
having trouble obtaining their Social Security 
or Medicare benefits, or helping to expedite 
the renewal of a passport, or solving problems 
with tax returns, or helping a future citizen ob-
tain a green card. 
Madam Speaker, I cannot tell you how 
many times a happy constituent has told me 
about how Marty helped them, or a close fam-
ily member, resolve a problem. 
The president of the Dayton Philharmonic 
Orchestra once contacted my office with an 
urgent request for an expedited visa to allow 
a musical group from Canada, Jeans n 
Classics, to perform for Dayton’s annual Sum-
mer in the City Musical Festival. He sent me 
a message, saying that ‘‘Marty did a fantastic 
job in getting this issue resolved quickly and 
efficiently. We are very, very grateful for 
Marty’s prompt, helpful, and courteous assist-
ance.’’

A retiree from Beavercreek recently needed 
help gaining access to funds from his Thrift 
Savings Plan, which were needed to cover 
vital living expenses during the coronavirus 
pandemic. Marty jumped right into action, and 
the matter was cleared up in a very short pe-
riod. ‘‘Without Marty’s skillful intervention,’’ he 
wrote, ‘‘I may still be waiting for TSP to com-
plete my requested transfer of these funds.’’ 
After Marty helped expedite the renewal of 
his son’s passport for a trip to Tokyo, a man 
from Dayton wrote: ‘‘My son and I couldn’t 
have completed the Transpacific business/per-
sonal trip without Marty’s outstanding profes-
sionalism and stick-to-itiveness. We were able 
to bond, spending quality time with each other 
that’ll never be forgotten.’’ 
On behalf of myself, and on behalf of the 
countless Miami Valley residents she has 
helped, I thank Marty Heide for a job well 
done. I will be forever grateful for the friend-
ship and support she has given to me, the 
staff, and the people our congressional district. 
Her presence in my office will certainly be 
missed. I wish her and her husband, Randall, 
a happy, healthy, and productive retirement.

Friday, May 6, 2022 
Ms. CRAIG. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
honor of National Small Business Week, May

tions to fulfill the IT needs of smaller busi-
nesses throughout the Second Congressional 
District and Minnesota. Brian has ensured that

RECOGNIZING THE 80TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE INSTITUTE OF IN-
TERNAL AUDITORS 
HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 6, 2022 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate In-
stitute of Internal Auditors (IIA) on the occa-
sion of its 80th anniversary and to recognize 
Internal Audit Awareness Month. 
The IIA was founded in 1941 by a small 
group of auditors based in New York City who 
understood the importance of the profession 
as well as its critical role in governance, risk, 
and control. From these humble beginnings 
the IIA has grown tremendously with branches 
in 170 countries and over 210,000 members. 
By relentlessly advocating for its members, 
providing valuable training to students, hosting 
conferences and so much more the IIA works 
to uplift this critically important profession. 
Madam Speaker, the IIA is a real New York 
success story. I ask that my colleagues join 
me in celebrating the Institute for all that they 
do to promote the critical field of auditing and 
wish them continued success.

RECOGNIZING 
MR. 
MICHAEL 
KOBITO AS GEORGIA’S TEACHER 
OF THE YEAR 
HON. BARRY LOUDERMILK 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 6, 2022 
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Mr. Michael Kobito of 
Bartow County, Georgia as the 2023 Georgia 
Teacher of the Year, and to commend his ex-
ceptional service to students in Bartow Coun-
ty, as well as his incredible contributions to 
their academic enrichment. 
Mr. Kobito teaches AP Music Theory at 
Woodland High School; and, in addition to 
providing students with a top-notch instruction 
in the performing arts, Mr. Kobito leads four 
concert bands, a 200-member marching band, 
the school basketball pep band, a jazz band, 
and the winter guard. 
Mr. Kobito’s AP Music students achieved a 
100 percent pass rate on the AP exam within 
his first year of teaching, a result of his dedi-
cation to their education, as well as their en-
thusiasm for his class. His teaching philosophy 
emphasizes the potential of each individual 
student and encourages them to treat every 
day as an opportunity to learn and achieve. 
As the 2023 Georgia Teacher of the Year, 
Mr. Kobito will serve as an advocate for Geor-
gia students and educators, and as an ex-offi-
cio member of the Georgia State Board of 
Education. Furthermore, he will compete for 
the recognition of 2023 National Teacher of 
the Year. 
Once again, I commend Mr. Kobito for his 
exceptional work as a Georgia educator and 
congratulate him on achieving this important 
honor within the Georgia education system. I 
would also like to acknowledge the runner up, 
Katie Blum of Sugar Hill Elementary, and all 
Georgia’s Teacher of the Year finalists for 
their tremendous work and dedication to edu-
cating our next generation of successful Geor-
gians.

COLUMBIA 
RIVER

RECREATION 
ENHANCE-
MENT AND CONSERVATION (REC) 
ACT OF 2022 
HON. EARL BLUMENAUER 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 6, 2022 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, today 
I introduced the Mount Hood and Columbia 
River Gorge Recreation Enhancement and 
Conservation (REC) Act of 2022. 
Over the last several years, I have listened 
to 
feedback 
from 
Oregonians, 
Tribal 
sovereigns, local elected officials, businesses, 
and others about Mt. Hood and the Columbia 
River Gorge. People have shared information 
about how they use these special places, their 
concerns, and their proposed solutions to im-
prove management, address wildfire risk, en-
hance recreation, and protect natural re-
sources. I worked to reflect those views in this 
legislation, which will create a leading model 
of Tribal co-management on the Forest, retain 
and restore healthy ecosystems, develop long 
term sustainable recreation and transportation 
plans for the region, and enhance community 
resilience through climate adaptation and miti-
gation. 
This legislation represents many years of 
listening to community members and refining 
ideas. It also remains a work in progress. I 
look forward to continuing this community-fo-
cused effort to protect and improve access to 
Mount Hood and the Columbia River Gorge. 
I urge my colleagues to support this legisla-
tion.

HONORING MR. PETER 
BONITATIBUS 
HON. STEPHEN F. LYNCH 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 6, 2022 
Mr. LYNCH. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
recognition of Mr. Peter Bonitatibus, who is re-
tiring after a tireless 35-year-long career in the 
Commonwealth of Massachusetts’ system of 
higher education. Born in Quincy, Peter has 
resided in Whitman for the last 20 years with 
his wife Margaret and their children Sheila, 
Danny, Justin, and Mary. 
Peter is proud to have spent his entire ca-
reer working with many outstanding police offi-
cers, 
faculty, 
and 
staff 
in 
several 
of 
Massachusetts’s finest public institutions of 
higher learning. Before his retirement, he was 
considered the key person for all things tech-
nological for the University of Massachusetts 
Boston’s Division of Student Affairs. The group 
includes over 300 part and full-time employees 
that encompass Police, General Medicine, 
Counseling, student care, Housing, Activities, 
Leadership programs, Multicultural Affairs, and 
student hunger and housing security matters. 
Peter is a tireless advocate on behalf of the 
people he worked with, often going the extra 
mile to ensure the health and safety of his be-
loved community. His incredible attention to 
detail and technical skill have led his col-
leagues to dub him the ‘‘Mr. Spock’’ of UMass 
Boston. A badge he wears with honor, as he 
is a great fan of Star Trek. 
Peter began his career in 1986 as a police 
officer at Framingham State College. He then 
worked at Bridgewater State College and fi-
nally served at UMass Boston, where he was 
elevated to Sergeant and then hired as UMass 
Boston’s Director of Student Affairs Tech-
nology Services. During his career until his re-
cent retirement, Peter has been recognized as 
a national leader in the security technology 
profession and served as the Education Chair 
for the Boston Chapter of ASIS International. 
A dedicated family man, Peter and his wife 
Margaret raised their four beloved children in 
Whitman. Through his example, his children 
now work in public service and law enforce-
ment and continue Peter’s legacy of giving 
back to the community and a life of serving 
others. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Peter’s service, thank him, 
and wish him well in retirement.

HONORING THE MEMORY OF 
DOROTHY THIGPEN 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 6, 2022 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, today I want to 
honor the memory of Dorothy Jean Thigpen, a 
long-time resident of Detroit, Michigan. 
Born and raised in Tennessee, her life’s 
journey took her from rural Tennessee to De-
troit’s Jeffries projects to the Manoogian Man-
sion and finally to the rural suburbs of Virginia. 
As a child, her family moved to Michigan, 
where she spent time in Albion and Detroit. As 
a student attending Detroit’s Central High 
School, she met and married the love of her 
life George Westly Thigpen, Jr. on October 11, 
1958. From their union, she had seven daugh-
ters and one son. Her young family lived in 
many places around the city of Detroit. 
During the 70s and as her family grew, she 
put her skills to work sewing parachutes at a 
downtown armed forces factory. Shortly after 
the Vietnam War ended, Dorothy got a job at 
Fisher Body as a power sewer making car 
seats for luxury vehicles. She retired from 
Fisher Body after more than 20 years of serv-
ice on a medical retirement in 2000. 
A working mother, Dorothy ensured her chil-
dren took their education seriously. Her house 
was always filled with music and weekly rou-
tines. Because discipline was primary for 
Dorothy, she was famous for her ‘‘I can show 
you better than I can tell you’’ lessons. She re-
quired her children to have fun outdoors and 
charged them to be creative, athletic, and 
come home before the streetlights come on. 
Above all, Dorothy Thigpen’s life was filled 
with love, service, and her faith. She enjoyed 
her time spent with family and friends, enjoy-
ing all life had to offer. Please join me in hon-
oring her memory.

HONORING JON ERICKSON OF 
ANGRY INCH BREWING

Friday, May 6, 2022 
Ms. CRAIG. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
honor of National Small Business Week, May 
2–5, 2022, and to thank Jon Erickson of Angry 
Inch Brewing. Jon’s dedication to his commu-
nity in Lakeville is what fuels Minnesota’s Sec-
ond Congressional District. 
As Lakeville’s first craft brewery, Angry Inch 
has become a central part of historic down-
town Lakeville. When Jon turned his hobby for 
home brewing into something bigger, he and 
all the staff at Angry Inch showcased how a 
small business can serve a community. 
Small businesses like Angry Inch Brewing 
are the backbone of our economy. I’m proud 
that Jon is a member of my Small Business 
Taskforce. I’m thankful for his expertise and 
guidance as we work to shape policies to ben-
efit and strengthen our small business econ-

DEDICATED 
COMMUNITY 
MEMBER AND SMALL BUSINESS 
OWNER 
HON. ADAM SMITH 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 6, 2022 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, 
I rise to recognize Efrem Fesaha for his many 
years of service as a dedicated community 
member and small business owner. Having 
first founded Boon Boona Coffee in 2012, 
Efrem has grown his business to now include 
multiple locations that employ more than 20 
people, This year, Efrem was awarded the 
2022 Small Businessperson of the Year by 
both the SBA of Washington State and of the 
Pacific Northwest Region due to his out-
standing work navigating the challenges posed 
by the pandemic while fostering inclusive and 
welcoming spaces at his shops. He is one of 
ten 
finalists 
for 
SBA’s 
National 
Small 
Businessperson of the Year. 
Efrem founded Boon Boona Coffee after vis-
iting his family in Eritrea and drawing inspira-
tion from East African coffee. He has dedi-
cated his business to bringing the rich culture 
of East African Coffee to the Seattle area. Not 
only has Efrem greatly contributed to the cul-
ture of Washington’s 9th district, he has also 
set out to create a positive impact globally, 
sourcing fresh coffee beans from African pro-
ducers and women-owned growers. 
The SBA’s recognition of Efrem’s achieve-
ments is well-deserved and speaks to his 
strong character, work ethic, and under-
standing of the importance of creating wel-
coming environments for community members 
to gather. 
Madam Speaker, it is my privilege and 
honor to recognize Efrem Fesaha for his out-
standing career achievements and for his con-
tributions to our community.

DENOUNCING 
TREATMENT 
OF 
AMERICAN HERO AND VETERAN, 
AIRMAN BRIAN KOLFAGE 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 6, 2022 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to expose the shameful treatment of Iraq war 
veteran Brian Kolfage by the U.S. Govern-
ment. 
Airman Kolfage lost three limbs defending 
our country in the Iraq war. While serving a 
second tour of duty in Iraq in 2004, a rocket 
shell exploded 25 feet from him. Due to his te-
nacity and determination, he shocked his doc-
tors and left Walter Reed after only 11 
months. He earned a Purple Heart and is the 
most wounded airman ever to have survived a 
war in the history of our country. 
Brian Kolfage’s service to country did not 
end with his military valor. Incredibly, he ran a

private organization that helped build 3 miles 
of border wall along the Rio Grande river, a 
place where construction is difficult due to the 
great potential for erosion. 
So how do our corrupt elites treat this hero? 
They respond like they did to the many peace-
ful protesters on January 6, to the pro-life pro-
testers facing over 10 years for trying to save 
the unborn, or to anyone who disagrees with 
their globalist, America-last agenda. They per-
secute them; they make their lives a living 
hell; they ruin them. 
As our ruling elites were not happy that the 
illegal hordes could not continue to stream 
across the border, they activated their deep- 
state machinery and sent their secret police to 
arrest Airman Kolfage. Fifteen Federal law en-
forcement goons dragged him out of his house 
without a wheelchair, subjecting him to utter 
humiliation and pain in front of his family. No 
thought whatsoever was given to his disabled 
status. And in prison, the VA refused him pain 
medications, without which he suffers unbear-
able pain. 
Mr. Kolfage had worked tirelessly, 12 hours 
a day, for several years to get this 3-mile sec-
tion of wall built. He ran and operated the or-
ganization that got it done. For taking a salary, 
the Federal Government arrested him, saying 
he had no right to get paid anything because 
his website said any money raised would go 
to build the wall. In my view, he was part of 
getting the wall built. There was nothing wrong 
with him getting a salary and saying the 
money would be used to build the wall. With-
out him, it would not have been complete, and 
no real American would object to a man get-
ting paid to devote himself to a selfless project 
like this one and succeeding. 
Airman Kolfage was just intimidated into tak-
ing a plea deal by our third-world, kangaroo- 
court judicial system. This veteran and activist 
should be celebrated as a hero in so many 
ways. Instead, he will rot in a Federal prison. 
A greater injustice is hard to imagine. To his 
wife, Ashley, and two children, my heart goes 
out to them. I am praying for them all. Please 
know that I will continue to fight against the in-
justice done to her husband.

CELEBRATING 100 YEARS OF 
PILGRIM REST BAPTIST CHURCH 
HON. RUBEN GALLEGO 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 6, 2022 
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Pilgrim Rest Baptist 
Church, which will celebrate its 100th anniver-
sary this month. 
Founded in 1922 by Reverends Jake How-
ard, R. Thomas, and M. Boyd, Pilgrim Rest 
has been serving the Phoenix community ever 
since. In addition to its well over twenty min-
istries, Pilgrim Rest offers a wide range of 
human services that assist not only their con-
gregation, but any in the community who are 
in need. These services include family sup-
port, employment assistance, a monthly food 
bank, and much more. As the church has 
grown, Pilgrim Rest has expanded its sanc-
tuary, built the Word Center to house class-
rooms and the Family Services Resource 
Center, and opened the Wellness Center to 
care for the physical body as well as the soul. 
Since 2018, Pilgrim Rest has been under 
the able leadership of Pastor Terry E. Mackey, 
who has continued to develop Pilgrim Rest 
and the community it serves. Pilgrim Rest’s 
mission is to be, ‘‘like a city that sits upon a 
hill; a beacon of hope for all.’’ They have been 
spreading that hope for the last 100 years, 
and I look forward to seeing all they will do 
next. 
I would like to again congratulate Pilgrim 
Rest Baptist Church on 100 years of faith and 
service.

HON. LOUIE GOHMERT 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 6, 2022 
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, it is with 
enormous pride that I recognize and congratu-
late the Tyler Junior College Lady Apaches on 
an outstanding basketball season in which 
they captured the National Junior College Ath-
letic Association Division 1 Women’s National 
Championship title. 
Throughout the 2021–2022 season, the 
Lady Apaches developed a reputation with 
one of the top offenses in the country, aver-
aging 78.8 points per game, making it appar-
ent that the Lady Apaches were a force with 
which to be reckoned. Entering the NJCAA 
tournament with a season record of 23–8 and 
as the No. 17 seed, the Lady Apaches were 
underdogs in each of their five games in the 
tournament. However, they demonstrated their 
hard work and determination to earn a spot in 
the championship game. 
The Lady Apaches demonstrated incredible 
focus and skill to clinch the National Cham-
pionship over the Georgia Highlands Lady 
Chargers with a final score of 92–80. It is an 
esteemed honor to pay tribute to the team 
members and coaches of the 2021–2022 
NJCAA Division 1 Women’s Basketball Na-
tional Champions: Veonce Powell (No. 1), 
Nassarine William (No. 3), Tia Morgan (No. 4), 
Nadechka Laccen (No. 5), Emari Sidney (No.

24), Head Coach Trenia Tillis-Hoard, Assistant 
Coach Chelsea Hudson, Assistant Coach 
Brianna Brooks, Student Assistant Coach 
Brynn Sultz, and Manager Keairra Grant. 
This tribute goes out to all of the amazing 
athletic staff and support staff at Tyler Junior 
College including the Director of Intercollegiate 
Athletics Kevin Vest; Assistant Athletic Direc-
tor Kelsi Weeks; Associate Athletic Director 
Chuck Smith; Administrative Assistant Jordan 
Jones; Head Athletic Trainer Eddy McGuire; 
Assistant Athletic Trainer Victoria Morris; Stu-
dent Trainer Paige Arkfeld; Student Trainer 
Haven Bengi; Registrar Records/State Reports 
Coordinator Denny Yarbrough; Enrollment 
Support Services Specialist Erica Thurman, 
and all other personnel that contributed to this 
amazing championship season. 
An athletic team cannot achieve any true 
level of excellence without unwavering support 
from its school leaders including President Dr. 
Juan E. Mejia; Provost Dr. Deana Sheppard; 
and Associate Vice Provost of Student Affairs 
Dr. Tim Drain. That is exactly the kind of sup-
port the Lady Apaches experienced from the 
entire community of Tyler and Smith County. 
That is why congratulations go to all the out-
standing family, friends, and fans who contrib-
uted to the success of the Lady Apaches dur-
ing this championship season. 
The accomplishment of Deborah Ogayemi 
(forward) should be of particular note, who 
averaged 17 rebounds a game during the 
tournament and was voted the Tournament’s 
Most Valuable Player. Joining her on the All- 
Tournament Team were teammates Shadiya 
Thomas (guard) and Taryn Wills (guard). 
Head Coach Trenia Tillis-Hoard is to be con-
gratulated for receiving the Coach of the Tour-
nament award. 
This is not just a feat for the basketball 
team but for the entire college. This rep-
resents the 67th national championship in the 
school’s history as a NJCAA Division 1 con-
tender. Furthermore, The Lady Apaches were 
in the national tournament for the fifth time in 
six years and in the national championship 
game for the third time ever. This will be the 
first National Championship the Lady Apaches 
have won since their only other championship 
win in 2000. This speaks highly of the hard 
work and dedication of the men and women 
and the excellent coaching staff at Tyler Junior 
College. 
It is with great pride that I join with all of 
east 
Texas 
in 
congratulating 
the 
Lady 
Apaches basketball team on their NJCAA Divi-
sion 1 National Championship. May God con-
tinue to bless these consummate first-class 
competitors, along with their families, friends, 
and neighbors in east Texas. This outstanding 
accomplishment is now preserved, which will 
endure as long as there is a United States of 
America.

HONORING D.C.’S 2022 GREEN 
RIBBON SCHOOLS 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 6, 2022 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to ask the House of Representatives to join 
me in congratulating two District of Columbia 
schools on being recognized by the U.S. De-
partment of Education as Green Ribbon 
Schools. 
For the past 11 years, the Department of 
Education has recognized schools for their 
sustainability 
practices. 
Since 
2011, 
11 
schools in the District have been recognized 
as Green Ribbon Schools. This year, J.G. 
Whittier Elementary School and American Uni-
versity were selected as Green Ribbon 
Schools. 
J.G. Whittier Elementary School, located in 
Manor Park in Northwest D.C., was estab-
lished in 1926 and serves 324 students in 
grades K–8. The school recently held a Sus-
tainability Science, Technology, Engineering, 
Arts and Mathematics (STEAM) Day, which al-
lowed students to learn about sustainability 
and the effect that we have on the environ-
ment, as well as to engage in project-based 
activities connecting their learning. I applaud 
J.G. Whittier Elementary School for its rec-
ognition as a Green Ribbon School. 
Located in Spring Valley in Northwest D.C., 
American University helps students to learn, 
research and work to spark positive change in 
their neighborhood and the world. Established 
in 1893 by an Act of Congress, American Uni-
versity enrolls 14,000 students in its under-
graduate and graduate programs. American 
University has a proud history of sustainability, 
which includes becoming one of the first uni-
versities in the Nation to reach carbon neu-
trality, in 2018. I applaud American University 
for its recognition as a Green Ribbon School.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF 
MARY 
FRANCINE 
‘‘MERRI 
DEE’’ DORHAM 
HON. BOBBY L. RUSH 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, May 6, 2022 
Mr. RUSH. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor and celebrate the life and legacy of an 
extraordinary woman, journalist, television 
broadcast legend, and philanthropist, Mary 
Francine ‘‘Merri Dee’’ Dorham. 
Merri was born in Chicago, Illinois on Octo-
ber 30, 1936. While she grew up in New Orle-
ans, Louisiana, she returned to Chicago as a 
teenager where she graduated from Engle-
wood Technical Prep Academy High School in 
1955. After graduating, Merri attended Xavier 
University in New Orleans, where she was a 
business administration major. Although she 
had to drop out to support her siblings, her 
passion for journalism would land her at 
WBEE in 1966 and, two years later, Merri 
began hosting an entertainment program at 
WCIU on Saturday nights. 
In 1971, Merri’s popularity on local television 
resulted in her having her own talk show, ‘‘The 
Merri Dee Show’’ on independent station, 
WSNS-Channel 44. That year, Merri faced a 
personal tragedy when she and a talk show 
guest were kidnapped from the television sta-
tion and nearly killed. She survived this hor-
rendous incident and made it her life’s mission 
to advocate for victims of gun violence. She 
lobbied state and local public officials in pass-
ing Illinois’ first victims’ bill of rights, which 
would become a model for other states. 
In 1972, Merri became an anchor for WGN- 
TV’s 9 p.m. newscast, becoming the first Afri-
can American lead anchor for a news station 
in a major U.S. city. For the next three dec-
ades, she would play a pivotal role at the sta-
tion as a senior leader, including serving as 
WGN’s Community Relations Director. In this 
capacity, Merri was a liaison between the sta-
tion and the many social and community orga-
nizations around town and managed multiple 
public service campaigns, including hosting 
countless broadcasts of the legendary Bud 
Billiken Parade, the nation’s largest and long-
est running African American parade, annually 
attended by one million onlookers and two 
thousand parade participants. 
Merri’s philanthropic commitment was con-
sistent beyond her professional career. She 
participated in several charities and organiza-
tions including the Chicago-based program 
Athletes for a Better Education—a charity she 
founded. She was a yearly fixture as television 
host for the United Negro College Fund’s 
‘‘Evening of Stars’’ for nearly two decades, in 
addition to hosting numerous telethons for the 
Easterseals. 
Throughout the next 40 years, Merri would 
spotlight her love for children through several 
on-air 
segments, 
including 
‘‘The 
Waiting 
Child,’’ which focused on children in the foster 
system in need of an adoptive home. Her im-
pact was recognized by then-Illinois Governor 
Jim Edgar, who recognized her with a com-
mendation in 1998 for helping to increase 
state adoptions by more than 50 percent. Her 
hard work and dedication also earned her the 
Adoption Excellence Award from the U.S. De-
partment of Health and Human Services in 
2004. 
Merri Dee was a trailblazer in the world of 
broadcast journalism for young Black women 
paving a path for increasing diversity in news-
rooms. She was a committed mentor, an au-
thor, and devoted leader in her community led 
by her faith, forgiveness, and grace. A recipi-
ent of countless awards and accolades, she 
was inducted in the National Association of 
Black Journalists Hall of Fame and served as 
the president of Illinois’ AARP chapter. She 
was an incredible leader; a compassionate; a 
kind professional and gloriously gifted friend 
with a broad, welcoming million-dollar smile. 
Her loss is deeply felt in Chicago, the Na-
tion, and across the entire world. My thoughts 
and prayers are with her family, loved ones, 
and to all who were impacted by her wonder-
ful spirit.
