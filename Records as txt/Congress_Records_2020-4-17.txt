God of mercy, thank You for giving

We ask You, O Lord, to come to our 
aid now, in the midst of the global 
spread of the coronavirus, that we may 
experience Your healing love. Heal 
those who are sick with the virus. May 
they regain their strength and health 
through quality medical care. 
Heal us from our fear, which prevents 
nations from working together and 
neighbors from helping one another. 
Be with those who have died from the 
virus. May they rest in peace. 
Be with the families of those who are 
sick or have died. Defend them from 
illness and despair. May they, too, 
know Your peace. 
Be with the doctors, nurses, research-
ers, and all medical professionals who 
put themselves at risk in the process. 
May they know Your protection and 
peace. 
Be with the leaders of all nations. 
Give them the foresight to act; the wis-
dom to invest in long-term solutions 
that will help prepare for or prevent fu-
ture outbreaks. May they know Your 
peace. 
Stay with us as we endure and 
mourn, persist, and prepare. Give us 
Your peace and heal us. 
May everything done this day be for 
Your greater honor and glory. 
Amen.

REMEMBERING FREDERICK 
LANGSTON HUNT 
HON. DONNA E. SHALALA 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, April 17, 2020 
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
memory of Frederick Langston Hunt, who 
passed away peacefully on April 8, 2020. My 
thoughts are with his family. 
Frederick Langston Hunt, the only child of 
Frederick F. Hunt and Bernice S. Hunt, grew 
up in the close-knit community of Coconut 
Grove, FL. He graduated with honors from 
G.W. Carver High School and was a member 
of the Thorians Class of ’64. After completing 
his undergraduate education at Howard Uni-
versity and earning his master’s degree from 
Montclair University, he moved to Albany, 
Georgia where he met Cellestine Hill, whom 
he married in 1972. He and Cellestine shared 
a dedication to the civil rights movement and 
a gift for making each other laugh. 
In the early seventies, the Hunts moved to 
Greensboro, NC, where Frederick was a doc-
toral candidate at the University of North Caro-
lina at Greensboro. Over the years, he served 
as Director of African American Studies at 
Guilford College and as a professor at Shaw 
University. Fred was also instrumental in es-
tablishing the Head Start program in the Triad 
area. It was during this time that Maia Nataki 
Cellestine Hunt, their only child, was born. 
Fred took such pride in his only child, who fa-
vored him so much, that some joked she 
should have been named ‘‘Fredericka’’. 
Frederick was an educator with the mind of 
an entrepreneur, a heart for his people, and 
the spirit of a musician. The common thread in 
everything he pursued was his commitment to 
racial, social, and economic justice. His pas-
sion for education and learning dominated his 
early professional life, and he always made 
time to be a trusted counselor and guide for 
young people. Frederick started a mentoring 
group for young men, frequently hosted 
Kwanzaa celebrations at his home or commu-
nity centers, and dedicated himself to serving 
Dudley High School through the Parent 
Teacher Association. He always remained ac-
tive in local politics and service organizations 
like the N.A.A.C.P. 
Even when Fred focused his professional 
efforts on real estate, first as an agent and 
later establishing his own real estate firm, he 
continued to find ways to serve. He hosted 
workshops to prepare people for home owner-
ship and frequently assisted customers with 
their first home purchases. He was regularly 
recognized by his peers and the High Point 
Regional Association of Realtors for excelling 
in the field, and he continued his real estate 
business when he returned to Miami to be 
closer to his mother. 
Once he settled in Coconut Grove, he 
joined Greater St. Paul, A.M.E., where his 
mother was a lifelong member. He was also a 
member of the Greater St. Paul Male Chorus 
and the Sons of Allen, a group dedicated to 
fellowship and mentoring in the community. In 
2012, as his health challenges mounted, he 
moved to Maryland to be closer to his daugh-
ter. 
Frederick is survived by his daughter, Maia 
Hunt Estes; his son-in-law, Elliott; his chosen 
siblings, Dr. Thomas Garvin and June Garvin; 
his niece Loren Statia (Jeff); and nephew 
Khari Garvin (Leslie); his in-laws, Estell Scott 
Estes and Eric and Jacinta Estes; his grand-
nephew Ethan Estes; and a host of friends 
and loved ones who became his family.

Friday, April 17, 2020 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Miguel May 
for receiving the Arvada Wheat Ridge Service 
Ambassadors for Youth award. 
Miguel May is a student at Arvada High 
School and received this award because his 
determination and hard work have allowed him 
to overcome adversities. 
The dedication demonstrated by Miguel May 
is exemplary of the type of achievement that 
can be attained with hard work and persever-
ance. It is essential students at all levels strive 
to make the most of their education and de-
velop a work ethic which will guide them for 
the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to 
Miguel May for winning the Arvada Wheat 
Ridge Service Ambassador for Youth award. I 
have no doubt he will exhibit the same dedica-
tion and character in all of his future accom-
plishments.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF GUY 
THOMAS HARRIS 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, April 17, 2020 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
today I rise to celebrate the life of Guy Thom-
as Harris, who passed away peacefully on 
April 6, 2020 at the age of 81. 
A lifelong resident of Lee County, Guy 
proudly served our nation in the Mississippi 
Army National Guard and Reserves for 13 
years. After being honorably discharged, Guy 
joined the Tupelo Police Department in 1963 
where he served as a law enforcement officer 
for 20 years, he retired as a Captain in 1983. 
Following his retirement, Guy became a sales-
man at Tupelo Auto Sales until he retired per-
manently in 1999. 
Guy was known for many things, he was a 
faithful member of Saltillo First United Meth-
odist Church where he enjoyed listening to 
Brother Tim Greene’s sermons. Guy frequently 
enjoyed fellowship with his many friends over 
a good meal, and could always been seen 
with his wife, Elaine; on their front porch wav-
ing to honking friends as they drove by. He 
was an avid sports fan and especially enjoyed 
watching his daughter’s softball games, coach-
ing men’s softball, and watching the New York 
Yankees and Dallas Cowboys. Guy was most 
well-known for being a childhood friend of 
Elvis Presley. Guy took great pride in his role 
as a historian for the Elvis Presley Birthplace 
and Museum in Tupelo and helped author 
‘‘We Remember Elvis’’ with his first-hand ac-
counts of growing up with the King of Rock 
and Roll. 
Guy leaves behind his wife of 61 years, his 
daughter, three grandchildren, four great- 
grandchildren, and many other close family 
members and friends. He loved his family, and 
especially cherished spending time with his 
grandchildren and great-grandchildren. The life 
Guy lead was one of love, service, passion, 
and loyalty. Guy never met a stranger and will 
be greatly missed by all whom he encoun-
tered.

Dr. Pham Do Thien Huong is an optometrist

causes in her community. Dr. Pham Do Thien 
Huong is a passionate activist who leads 
Huong Viet Scout Troop (with more than 200

has created a competition named ‘‘Uoc Mo 
Viet’’ (Vietnamese Dream), to encourage Viet-
namese American children to learn the Viet-
namese language through Vietnamese songs 
and short stories. The competition started at 
the beginning of 2020 and has since flour-
ished with more than 100 contestants. Even in

continue online to acknowledge the hard work 
of all its participants.

ognized as a hero, both within the Vietnamese

HONORING DR. MARGIE BROWN 
PULLEY 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, April 17, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. Margie 
Brown Pulley. 
Dr. Margie Brown Pulley is a lifelong resi-
dent of Greenwood and Leflore County. She is 
a 1971 honor graduate of Amanda Elzy High 
School. At Amanda Elzy, Dr. Pulley excelled 
both academically and athletically. She was 
captain of the 1970 Amanda Elzy girl’s state 
championship basketball team. In September 
1971, she entered Jackson State University, 
and three years later in May 1974, she grad-
uated with honors with a B.S. degree in Social 
Science. She later received her Master’s, Spe-
cialist, and Doctorate degrees in School Ad-
ministration from Delta State University. 
Dr. Pulley spent thirty-eight (38) years work-
ing with the Greenwood Public School District. 
Her professional career began in 1974 as a 
teacher of Social Studies at Greenwood High 
School. During the next fifteen (15) years, Dr. 
Pulley taught Mississippi History, World His-
tory, U.S. History, and Government and Eco-
nomics. She also later served as Assistant 
Principal at Greenwood High School. From 
1990 until 1999, she served as the Principal of 
Threadgill School. According to Dr. Pulley, that 
experience as principal was both challenging 
and rewarding. At Threadgill, Dr. Pulley set 
high expectations for herself, her faculty and 
her students. Under Dr. Pulley’s administration 
as principal of Threadgill, the culture, climate 
and academic achievement improved signifi-
cantly. She is proud to say that her tenure as 
Principal at Threadgill was a major highlight in 
her career. In 1999, Dr. Pulley became Assist-
ant Superintendent of the Greenwood Public 
School District. In this capacity Dr. Pulley 
worked passionately with principals to ensure 
that faculty, staff, and students’ needs were 
met. She specifically directed Federal Pro-
grams, Personnel, Curriculum and Tech-
nology. In July 2008, Dr. Pulley was appointed 
Interim Superintendent of the Greenwood Pub-
lic School District. In January 2009, she was 
named Superintendent of the Greenwood Pub-
lic School District. Under Dr. Pulley’s leader-
ship, the school district received district-wide 
SACS accreditation, implemented a dress 
code, modified the grading system to a 10 
point scale, brought dual enrollment from Mis-
sissippi Valley State University to Greenwood 
High School, restructured the athletic program 
and significantly improved student achieve-
ment by placing academics first. Ultimately, 
according to the State Department of Edu-
cation, the Greenwood Public School District 
was rated as a ‘Successful School District for 
Three Years in a Row’: 2009–2010, 2010– 
2011, and 2011–2012’. The school district was 
also presented The TORCH Award by the 
Mississippi School Boards Association. Fur-
ther, under her leadership, the Mississippi 
Teacher of the Year was selected from Green-
wood High School, and Bankston Elementary 
School was named as a National Blue-Ribbon 
School. 
Dr. Pulley retired in 2012 and was later 
named as Conservator of the Oktibbeha 
County School District. Dr. Pulley successfully 
cleared all accreditation violations and suc-
cessfully led the consolidation efforts of the 
Oktibbeha County School District with the 
Starkville School District. Oktibbeha County 
Schools was rated a ‘‘C’’ school district. 
In July 2015, Dr. Pulley was named as Con-
servator in the Tunica County School District. 
Under her leadership, academic achievement 
has improved, and the Tunica County School 
District has been recognized by the Mis-
sissippi Department of Education for having 
the highest achievement in the state for math 
growth among the lowest 25 percent of high 
school students. Additionally, Dundee Elemen-
tary has been recognized as having the high-
est achievement in the state for math growth 
among the lowest 25 percent of elementary 
students. Recently, the principals at Dundee 
Elementary and Rosa Fort High School re-
ceived recognition as finalists for the MS prin-
cipal of the year. Presently, Rosa Fort ranks 
No. 8 in the state for its graduation rate (93.1 
percent). 
Dr. Pulley has received numerous awards 
and recognitions which includes but are not 
limited to: National Association of Federal Pro-
grams Administrators Service Award; Delta 
Sigma Theta Sorority Service Award; Certifi-
cate of Achievement from the Yale Child 
Study Center; Administrator of the Year for the 
Greenwood Public School District; Friendship 
Baptist Church: Badge of Courage Ward 
(2010); Greenwood Voters’ League: Lady of 
the Year (2010); Superintendent of the Year: 
Delta Area Association for the Improvement of 
Schools (2010); Delta’s Best in Education 
Award: 2011; and Shiloh 7th Day Adventist: 
Educator of the Year: 2011. 
Dr. Pulley is a lifelong member of Springhill 
Baptist Church in the Browning Community 
where she serves as a trustee and church 
secretary. In Dr. Pulley’s spare time she loves 
to attend and watch basketball and football 
games, read, and cook for her entire family 
every Sunday and all holidays. She also takes 
care of her eighty-eight (88) year old mother 
who lives with her. Dr. Pulley, a widow, was 
married to the former Superintendent of the 
Leflore County School District, Mr. Cedell Pul-
ley. She has three adult sons: Bill, a recre-
ation center director; Kelvin, an attorney; and 
Kenneth, deputy superintendent of schools. 
She also has three beautiful grandchildren: 
William, Rhaegan, and Morgan, and a daugh-
ter-in-law, Jessica. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Dr. Margie Brown Pulley for 
her dedication to serving her community and 
this great state.

IN HONOR OF HOOSIER HERO, 
OFFICER BREANN LEATH 
HON. ANDRE´ CARSON 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, April 17, 2020 
Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Madam Speaker, 
today I rise with a profound sense of sadness 
to remember Indianapolis Metropolitan Police 
Department (IMPD) Officer Breann Leath, a 
fallen Hoosier who dedicated her 24 years of 
life to serving others. I join the City of Indian-
apolis, the IMPD, as well as the entire law en-
forcement community over the loss of a true 
public servant. 
On April 9, 2020, Officer Leath responded to 
a domestic violence call on the east side of In-
dianapolis and was tragically killed. Officer 
Leath was responding to a call for help, like 
she had done bravely so many times over her 
career. She acted bravely and dutifully, and 
without hesitation and in doing so, sacrificed 
her own life. 
Prior to her three years of service with the 
Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department, 
Officer Leath served in the National Guard 
with the 387th Military Police Company at 
Camp Atterbury where she was honorably dis-
charged as a specialist. Those who knew her 
in high school recall she always wanted to be 
a police officer. IMPD Chief Randall Taylor 
stated of Leath, ‘‘She is the example of the 
type of officer we want on this department.’’ It 
is clear Officer Leath had a passion to her 
community and country. She was twenty-four 
years old and is survived by a young son as 
well as her parents who both served with the 
Marion County Sheriff’s Office. 
Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in ex-
tending our thoughts and prayers to Officer 
Leath’s family. Our communities need more 
dedicated public servants like Leath. We pay 
tribute to her life by maintaining our steadfast 
support for law enforcement providers who 
honorably and selflessly serve our commu-
nities.

Patch Arnold is a student at Oberon Middle

The dedication demonstrated by Patch Ar-
nold is exemplary of the type of achievement 
that can be attained with hard work and perse-
verance. It is essential students at all levels 
strive to make the most of their education and 
develop a work ethic which will guide them for

tion and character in all of his future accom-

Mississippi and Senator CARDIN of Maryland. 
As the United States Delegation to the OSCE 
Parliamentary Assembly, we recognize the im-
portance of building partnerships with our 
counterparts from other countries especially 
during such unprecedented times. 
As the Chairman of the Committee on Secu-
rity, I recognize multilateral diplomacy works to 
U.S. interests when we take the initiative. Par-
liamentarians have a special role to play as 
elected officials in this process, showing the 
depth of each of our country’s commitment to 
security and cooperation not only in Europe, 
but around the globe. 
During our most recent video conference, 
Italian Minister for European Affairs, Vincenzo 
Amendola, joined to update us on Italy’s re-
sponse to COVID–19. He stressed the need 
for continued cooperation in response not only 
to the health threat but also to the economic 
havoc the pandemic has caused. 
Shortly after our video conference con-
cluded, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo an-
nounced the United States will provide an ad-
ditional $225 million in health, humanitarian 
and economic assistance to boost response 
efforts worldwide. This is in addition to the 
$274 million already deployed to fight COVID– 
19. In the past two decades, the Secretary 
noted, the United States has provided $140 
billion in health assistance globally, helping to 
make us an undisputed leader in health and 
humanitarian aid. Some of this aide has been 
to countries in Europe, including Italy. I would 
add that this is not only a reflection of our 
country’s unmatched generosity over the dec-
ades, but our national interest as well. Many 
of the health threats we have faced come from 
beyond our borders, including COVID–19, and 
we have an interest in trying to respond effec-
tively to those threats where they first develop, 
before they reach our shores. 
A final outcome of the recent video con-
ference was endorsement of United Nation 
Secretary General Antonio Guterres’ recent 
call for a ceasefire regarding conflicts around 
the globe at this time when countries need to 
face a common pandemic threat. 
The Helsinki Commission provides Members 
of Congress with the opportunity to work with 
our friends and allies around the globe to pro-
mote our shared democratic values and work 
in a bipartisan fashion on core foreign policy 
issues. While our calls have been focused on 
fighting COVID–19 we are still tracking other 
international conflicts. For example, during the 
video conference I, along with other parlia-
mentarians, raised the issue of the unwar-
ranted Russian aggression in Ukraine and 
Georgia. I am encouraged by the level of en-
gagement from my OSCE Parliamentary As-
sembly colleagues and will continue to work 
with them through this global pandemic. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in 
recognizing the importance of these discus-
sions with our European allies and friends.

HONORING 
THE 
BOLSA 
CHICA 
LAND TRUST AND THE 50TH AN-
NIVERSARY OF EARTH DAY 
HON. HARLEY ROUDA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, April 17, 2020 
Mr. ROUDA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the Bolsa Chica Land Trust. This 
organization has worked tirelessly for over 20 
years to preserve the mesa, lowlands, and 
wetlands of Bolsa Chica and educate the com-
munity on its cultural significance. 
Ahead of the 50th anniversary of Earth Day, 
it is important to recognize the organizations 
that protect our Earth every day. Since 1996, 
the Bolsa Chica Land Trust and over 22,000 
volunteers have worked with the scientific 
community, the Native American community, 
and state agencies to acquire threatened land, 
restore damage to the environment, and pre-
serve the natural habitats in Bolsa Chica. In 
addition to its conservation efforts, the Bolsa 
Chica Land Trust serves the community by 
conducting educational programs to raise 
awareness about the Bolsa Chica wetlands 
and tell its rich cultural history. 
Due to their passionate and inspirational 
leadership, the Bolsa Chica Land Trust is rec-
ognized for its continuous commitment to pro-
tecting our Earth, both within the environ-
mental community and to all of us who value 
the restoration and preservation of our pre-
cious natural resources. 
I ask that all Members join me in honoring 
the extraordinary leadership and activism of 
the Bolsa Chica Land Trust.

TRIBUTE TO JENNIFER HOLMES 
HON. KAY GRANGER 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, April 17, 2020 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Jennifer Holmes, a member of 
the professional staff of the House Appropria-
tions Committee, who is retiring after 28 years 
of service to the Legislative Branch. 
Jenny began her Federal career in 1986 
working for the U.S. Government Accounting 
Office. Soon after, in 1989, she started her 
long tenure working for the House Appropria-
tions Committee, first as staff of the Treasury- 
Postal Service and Defense Appropriations 
Subcommittees. 
After leaving the Hill briefly to work in the 
private sector, Jenny returned to the House 
Appropriations Committee in 2005. In 2007, 
Jenny became professional staff for the Legis-
lative Branch Appropriations Subcommittee 
where she was instrumental to the operations 
of Congress. In response to two tragic events 
that affected our colleagues in the House of 
Representatives, the shooting of Congress-
woman Gabrielle Giffords and the shooting at 
the Congressional baseball game practice, 
Jenny worked tirelessly to ensure that re-
sources were focused beyond just the few 
square blocks that make up the Capitol 
grounds. 
Jenny advocated for infrastructure projects 
that will make the Nation’s Capital, specifically 
the U.S. Capitol grounds, accessible for years 
to come. Jenny was involved in many impor-
tant projects, such as the restoration of the 
Capitol dome, improvements to the Capitol 
power plant, billion-dollar renovations of the 
Cannon House Office Building, the Library of 
Congress’s Visitor Experience initiative and so 
many more. Jenny and her colleagues on the 
committee staff oversaw many of these 
projects from start to finish, and she should be 
very proud of her accomplishments. 
Jenny was known to cheerfully volunteer to 
coordinate 
retirement 
ceremonies, 
portrait 
dedications, and other social events for the 
Appropriations Committee. Jenny also dem-
onstrated her leadership and compassion by 
pulling together Appropriations Committee 
staff, Members, and external stakeholders for 
a very meaningful celebration of life event in 
honor of Chuck Turner, a long-time Committee 
staff member who was a dear friend and men-
tor to many. 
A hallmark of Jenny’s reputation was being 
a problem solver. She dedicated so much of 
her life to public service and never forgot why 
she was here. I know Jenny is looking forward 
to spending time with her husband Paul. her 
sons Kevin and Caiden, her daughter Karley, 
and her horses. We wish her the very best in 
her next journey and thank her for everything 
she has done for the United States Congress. 
PAUL MARTIN 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, April 17, 2020 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Paul Martin 
for receiving the Arvada Wheat Ridge Service 
Ambassadors for Youth award. 
Paul Martin is a student at Moore Middle 
School and received this award because his 
determination and hard work have allowed him 
to overcome adversities. 
The dedication demonstrated by Paul Martin 
is exemplary of the type of achievement that 
can be attained with hard work and persever-
ance. It is essential students at all levels strive 
to make the most of their education and de-
velop a work ethic which will guide them for 
the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to Paul 
Martin for winning the Arvada Wheat Ridge 
Service Ambassador for Youth award. I have 
no doubt he will exhibit the same dedication 
and character in all of his future accomplish-
ments.

REMEMBERING JOHN PRINE 
HON. STEVE COHEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, April 17, 2020 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise to pay 
tribute to a great singer-songwriter and friend, 
John Prine, who passed away last week in 
Nashville 
from 
complications 
of 
the 
coronavirus. John was an exceptional lyricist, 
described by his friend and producer Jerry 
Phillips as ‘‘thinking like nobody else thought’’ 
and writing lines that were ‘‘brilliant in the 
strangest way.’’ John produced three of his 18 
albums in Memphis, including his debut, the 
eponymous ‘‘John Prine,’’ in 1971. The album 
was cut at Chips Moman’s American Sound 
Studio, and included his classics ‘‘Angel from 
Montgomery’’ and ‘‘Paradise.’’ His fourth 
album, ‘‘Common Sense,’’ was made in 1975 
at Ardent Studios in Memphis and was pro-
duced by the legendary Steve Cropper. His 
sixth album, ‘‘Pink Cadillac,’’ was made at the 
Sam Phillips Recording Service in 1979 by 
Sam’s sons, Knox and Jerry. John’s last 
album, ‘‘The Tree of Forgiveness,’’ was re-
corded in Nashville and produced by his friend 
Matt Ross-Spang of Memphis. Songs from 
that album—You Got Gold,’’ ‘‘When I Get to 
Heaven’’ and ‘‘No Ordinary Blue’’—were part 
of his last performance in Memphis, at The 
Orpheum, on September 25, 2018. John’s 
songwriting career took off when, working as 
a postal worker in Chicago, he was discovered 
by singer-songwriter Kris Kristofferson. Bob 
Dylan said of his work: ‘‘Prine’s stuff is pure 
Proustian existentialism. Midwestern mind trips 
to the Nth degree. And he writes beautiful 
songs.’’ Always gracious and friendly, he 
seemed to his friends to be delighted with life. 
As Ross-Spang told The Commercial Appeal: 
‘‘If you can imagine a kid eating an ice cream 
cone for the first time, that’s how John looked 
at life. He had a love of Archie comics, hot 
dogs, meatloaf, fried chicken and Cadillacs. 
He always had a twinkle in his eye.’’ And as 
his friend Memphis singer-songwriter Keith 
Sykes said in tribute: ‘‘I don’t think there’s 
many songwriters who can make you laugh 
and cry in a single line—and make it rhyme.’’ 
John Prine’s was a life well-lived and he’s 
been taken too soon. He leaves the treasure 
of song for future generations to enjoy and 
learn about life. He will be missed.

HONORING CAPTAIN CLARENCE 
MCGEE 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, April 17, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a generous and 
brave man Captain Clarence McGee. Captain 
McGee has shown what can be done through 
hard work, dedication and a desire to serve 
others. 
Captain McGee, a Yazoo City Firefighter, is 
known for his generous spirit and for making 
a positive impact in the lives of local children. 
Captain Clarence McGee, a native of Holly 
Bluff, has been a member of the Yazoo City 
Fire Department for over six years. He is the 
son of Eddie Ma McGee of Holly Bluff and is 
the loving husband of Cheris McGee. He is 
the 
father 
of 
six 
children: 
Codarrius, 
Terryianna, Demarrious, Dontarrius, D’Rihya, 
and Cla’Zarreria. 
McGee graduated from Yazoo County High 
School in 2001. He attended Holmes Junior 
College for almost two years before accepting 
a job at the Nissan Plant, where he worked in 
stamping as a dye setter. 
McGee started at the Fire Academy in 2011. 
He failed the academy twice and refused to 
give up. Third time’s a charm, he passed the 
academy. In 2013 he started working full-time 
for the Yazoo City Fire Department, where he 
fell in love with the interacting with various 
children attending local schools. 
Captain McGee is actively involved in his 
church, New Foundation M.B. Church in Holly 
Bluff, where he was raised. 
Aside from his work as a fireman, McGee 
also operates a side business renting outdoor 
recreation equipment, and is known through-
out the community as the ‘‘Space Jump Man’’. 
In the past he has been known to rent out his 
space jumps to local community events or 
fundraisers free of charge so that local chil-
dren can have a place to play and enjoy them-
selves. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Captain Clarence McGee 
for his passion and dedication to serving 
Yazoo County and desire to make a difference 
in the community.

HONORING HUSKY HALL 
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, April 17, 2020 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
honor of Robert ‘‘Husky’’ Hall, a giant in the 
world of Virginia high school basketball who 
set 
several 
coaching 
records 
with 
the 
Martinsville Bulldogs. Coach Hall died on April 
5, 2020, at the age of 91. 
Husky Hall was a native of Fieldale in Henry 
County, Virginia. He played basketball, base-
ball, and golf at Elon College, now Elon Uni-
versity, in North Carolina and earned a mas-
ter’s degree in education from the University 
of North Carolina at Greensboro. He also 
served his country in the United States Army 
during the Korean War. After coaching boys 
and girls varsity basketball in Pleasant Grove, 
North Carolina, he became an assistant bas-
ketball coach at Martinsville in the 1950s. 
The head coach at the time, Mel Cartwright, 
Sr., was another major figure in Martinsville 
sports. During the early years, Husky Hall was 
the assistant, then began sharing duties with 
Coach Cartwright. In this period, Martinsville 
earned state championships in 1958, 1961, 
and 1964. 
Husky Hall became Martinsville’s head 
coach in 1965 and held the position until he 
retired in 1995. Over those years, his teams 
won 605 victories, a Virginia High School 
League (VHSL) record at the time. He still 
holds the VHSL record for the seven state 
championships his teams achieved, in 1966, 
1976, 1980, 1981, 1982, 1985, and 1986, and 
for playing in seven consecutive state cham-
pionship games from 1980 to 1986. 
Coach Hall’s leadership focused on the fun-
damentals of basketball. He insisted on lead-
ership and discipline. As a result, he brought 
out the best in his players and his assistant 
coaches, some of whom went on to great 
coaching careers of their own, and college 
coaches sought the secrets of his success. 
On top of his basketball duties, Husky Hall 
coached golf at Martinsville as well. In that 
role, the school won its only state champion-
ship at the Group AAA level in any sport in 
1974. 
In 1994, Coach Hall told the Roanoke Times 
about his approach: ‘‘If it’s going to work, 
someone has to be in charge, and you hope 
the players look up to the coach because he’s 
earned their respect.’’ He succeeded in earn-
ing the respect not only of his players and as-
sistant coaches but the whole Martinsville 
community and the world of Virginia high 
school basketball. The Virginia High School 
Hall of Fame inducted Coach Hall in 91, the 
second year of its existence. 
Coach Hall is survived by his daughters 
Robin Morgan and Terry Jamerson and seven 
grandchildren. He was predeceased by his 
wife, Verona. I offer my condolences to his 
family on their loss. Husky Hall’s name will live 
long in Virginia high school sports.

Friday, April 17, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable 
public servant, Ms. Patricia Ransom, who is a 
lifelong resident of Jackson. 
Ms. Patricia Ransom grew up in the 
Georgetown area and graduated from Lanier 
High School. She holds an Associate of Arts 
degree in Business Administration from Hinds 
Community College. Her first position after 
graduating was in Human Resources at Jack-
son Public Schools, where she was respon-
sible for assigning substitute teachers. Eight 
years later, she moved to the Property Ac-
counting Department, where she has served 
as a data clerk for the last 20 years. Ms. Ran-
som has three children that attended JPS 
schools. She believes you cannot educate a 
child’s mind without also educating the heart 
and that everybody in the District plays a role 
in this, from the cafeteria worker to the custo-
dian, to the bus driver, to the teachers and ad-
ministrators. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Ms. Patricia Ransom.
