MONDAY, MAY 11, 2020 
The Senate met at 3 p.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY).

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Marvelous Redeemer, You alone are 
God, keeping Your covenant with hu-
manity throughout the generations. 
Bless our Senators. Enable them to 
find shelter in the shadow of Your 
wings. Lord, bless their plans as they 
seek to do Your will on Earth, and em-
power them to succeed. Use them to 
bring comfort and healing to a troubled 
nation and world. Keep them aware of 
the constancy of Your presence, inspir-
ing them to give primacy to prayer and 
praise as they work for Your glory. 
We pray in Your majestic Name. 
Amen.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HAWLEY). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the 
pandemic has disrupted just about ev-
erything Americans take for granted in 
life, including our food supply. Empty 
grocery store shelves have greeted U.S. 
consumers, perhaps for the first time 
in their lifetimes. The pandemic shines 
a national spotlight on the ‘‘farm to 
fork’’ supply chain. Market disruptions 
are forcing farmers to make tough 
choices—milk being dumped, eggs de-
stroyed, and market-ready hogs may 
have nowhere to go. Farmers are shoul-
dering a heavy burden, with profound 
impact to their livelihood and mental 
health. 
As a champion for American agri-
culture, I am leading efforts to help 
our farmers get through these tough 
times. There is a lot of help coming 
from other people as well. 
As always, Iowa pork producers want 
to do what they do best, which is put 
food on our tables. They are teaming 
up with local meat lockers and food 
banks to do what is called Pass the 
Pork, a statewide initiative launched 
by Iowa Governor Reynolds. The Pass 
the Pork Program aims to stock food 
pantries with hogs donated by local 
farmers and from financial contribu-
tions to cover the costs of processing 
and distribution. Where there is a will, 
there is a way. We all know it. 
I salute Iowans pulling together the 
Iowa Way. 
I yield the floor. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, the 
Senate is back for its second week in 
session, and we have more important 
work to do for the American people. 
While 
our 
Nation 
fights 
the 
coronavirus pandemic, many of our fel-
low Americans have been taking new 
safety precautions but continue to 
show up to perform essential work. Be-
cause of delivery drivers and grocery 
clerks, families can keep food on their 
shelves. Because of utility workers, 
people hunkered down at home have 
power. Because of pharmacists man-
ning their counters, Americans have 
been able to keep getting the medi-
cines they need so this health crisis 
does not compound itself. Then, of 
course, there has been the selfless work 
of so many doctors, nurses, and other 
healthcare professionals. 
Frankly, even the word ‘‘essential’’ 
does not do full justice to all the new 
American heroes we have met these 
past weeks. 
In my home State of Kentucky, we 
met people like Leilani Krause. She is 
a 30-year nursing veteran who now 
oversees care at a senior living facility 
in Louisville. A few weeks ago, she her-
self contracted the coronavirus. Even 
as she stayed home to recover, she 
never stopped working. She still did all 
she could to coordinate her patients’ 
care over video calls. As soon as she

felt better and doctors gave her the all- 
clear, she checked right back into work 
right on the frontlines. 
I want to thank all of my Senate col-
leagues as we continue to perform our 
essential responsibilities to serve citi-
zens like Miss Krause and so many 
other American heroes all across our 
country. Of course, much of the work 
before us relates to the pandemic itself. 
Our committees of jurisdiction are at-
tacking COVID–19 and its effects from 
every angle. 
This week, Chairman ALEXANDER and 
our colleagues on the HELP Committee 
will hold a major hearing on smart and 
safe ways for Americans to get back to 
work and back to school. They will 
hear expert testimony from the very 
top leaders: Dr. Fauci, Dr. Redfield, Dr. 
Hahn, and Admiral Giroir from HHS. 
Chairman CRAPO
and the Banking 
Committee will hear from representa-
tives from the Federal Reserve and the 
FDIC on financial regulation. Obvi-
ously, that is an essential topic as the 
government continues to push out bil-
lions and billions of dollars in emer-
gency liquidity following the CARES 
Act. 
With huge numbers of Americans 
working, teaching, and learning from 
home and with telemedicine more im-
portant than ever, the Commerce Com-
mittee will hear from experts about ac-
cess to broadband internet during the 
crisis. 
The Judiciary Committee will hold 
an important hearing on issues of legal 
liability 
during 
this 
unprecedented 
time. It is crucial that as we continue 
to fight the pandemic itself, we ensure 
it is not followed up by a second job- 
killing epidemic of frivolous lawsuits. 
This would be just about the worst 
time in living memory to let trial law-
yers line their pockets at the expense 
of the rest of our country. The Senate 
is going to play a strong role in ensur-
ing that does not happen. 
While our committees are working 
away, here on the floor, we will start 
this week by confirming two more 
qualified nominees to important posts 
that should not remain empty at this 
time. We will begin with Brian Mont-
gomery of Texas, named by President 
Trump to serve as Deputy Secretary of 
Housing and Urban Development. Then 
we will turn to Troy Edgar of Cali-
fornia to be Chief Financial Officer at 
the Department of Homeland Security. 
I understand some of my distin-
guished Democratic colleagues com-
plain that the full Senate should not 
have to spend more time on these sorts 
of uncontroversial executive branch 
nominees. I agree. But as long as their 
own Democratic leadership continues 
to hold important posts open for as 
long as possible in order to just spite 
the White House, as long as the minor-
ity continues to break from long-
standing Senate precedent to obstruct 
even the least controversial nominees, 
then, frankly, they will have to con-
tinue to show up and vote on them. The 
floor votes they say they dislike are 
the direct result of their own tactics. 
We are also going to take up impor-
tant 
legislation 
this 
week. 
While 
COVID–19 rightly dominates headlines 
around the world, the United States of 
America 
also 
faced 
many 
serious 
threats before this virus began to 
spread, and they are still with us 
today. 
Later this week, we will turn back to 
reauthorizing 
important 
authorities 
under the Foreign Intelligence Surveil-
lance Act. This is urgent because the 
House refused to take up the Senate’s 
short-term 
extension 
of 
important 
counterterrorism 
and 
counterintel-
ligence authorities before they left 
town. House Democrats let these tools 
expire, so we must act quickly to clean 
up their mess and renew these authori-
ties, which our government needs to 
fight terrorists and check the agents of 
China and Russia. 
The bipartisan bill we will take up 
was negotiated exhaustively by House 
Republicans and the Attorney General 
of the United States. Determined advo-
cates for reform after the shameful 
abuses of 2016 sat down with deter-
mined defenders of the good parts of 
these tools, and they hammered out a 
strong compromise. The legislation 
will introduce more daylight and more 
accountability into the FISA process 
where appropriate, but it will ensure 
that the embarrassments of 2016 do not 
jeopardize these essential national se-
curity tools altogether. 
I hope the Senate will be able to dis-
patch the amendments that we will 
consider and pass this important legis-
lation on a bipartisan basis to keep the 
American people safe.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will pro-
ceed to executive session to resume 
consideration of the following nomina-
tion, which the clerk will report. 
The legislative clerk read the nomi-
nation of Brian D. Montgomery, of 
Texas, to be Deputy Secretary of Hous-
ing and Urban Development.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, the 
United States has well over a million 
confirmed cases of COVID–19. We are 
quickly, 
unfortunately, 
approaching 
80,000 fatalities. 
Alongside this great crisis of public 
health, 
this 
shocking 
and 
heart-
breaking loss of life, there is a looming 
economic catastrophe. There are now 
more than 30 million newly unem-
ployed Americans, over one-tenth of 
the population in the United States 
and the highest number since the Great 
Depression. Many believe this number 
underestimates the real total. 
Once this crisis is over, there is no 
guarantee that these millions of newly 
unemployed Americans will be able to 
resume their old jobs. How many peo-
ple will find new jobs? At what salary? 
Even the most optimistic scenarios 
predict a period of extended high un-
employment. Others suggest we are 
looking at the kernels of a second 
Great Depression. 
Here on the Senate floor, for the sec-
ond week in a row, we are living in the 
alternative reality of Republican Lead-
er MCCONNELL’s making. He has sched-
uled no legislative business here on the 
floor related to COVID–19—none—no 
measures for the unemployed, no relief 
for renters or homeowners, no legisla-
tion to increase testing capacity, no 
proposals to help State and local gov-
ernments retain teachers, firefighters, 
busdrivers, and police officers. 
Looking at the Senate calendar, you 
would never know that we are working 
in the midst of a national crisis. It 
looks like any other session—a few ex-
ecutive 
nominations, 
hearings 
on 
rightwing judges, and legislation from 
previous months that the leader should 
not have delayed. It is just totally, to-
tally divorced from reality. 
Despite the obvious health risks, 
Senators are ready to do our jobs. Why 
don’t we actually do our jobs and focus 
on COVID–19? For the sake of common 
sense and the good of the Nation, the 
Senate should be focused on COVID–19. 
We should be holding multiple serious 
oversight hearings every week. Several 
of my colleagues on the other side, in-
cluding the Republican leader, have 
said they want to see how the legisla-
tion we have already passed is working 
before doing anything else. At the 
same time, the Republican majority is 
slow-walking the hearing process. 
Finally, after a lot of Democratic 
pressure from myself and many others, 
the leader is sort of eking out, week by 
week, hearings. We have just heard 
that we will hear from Powell and 
Mnuchin on the 19th. That will be al-
most 2 months after a bill that let $4 
trillion of lending authority be re-
leased before there is a hearing. 
Why didn’t we hold a hearing 3 weeks 
ago, 5 weeks ago, or last week? It is

S2333 
May 11, 2020 
just outrageous. How can the Repub-
lican Senators say we want to see how 
this is working and not have a whole 
bunch of hearings to exam how it is 
working, instead of squeezing them out 
under direct pressure from us Demo-
crats? 
Now, tomorrow, in the Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions Committee 
there will be a hearing conducted re-
motely with Dr. Fauci. This is the kind 
of hearing we need, not once a week 
but several a day. The American people 
need to hear from experts in a fair, 
open, and truthful setting. 
Until now, we have mostly heard 
from the members of the Coronavirus 
Task Force through the distorted lens 
of the White House press conference, 
where the President often prevents 
them from answering fully, interrupts 
their responses, or even contradicts 
their fact-based advice. 
This will be one of the first opportu-
nities for Dr. Fauci to tell the Amer-
ican people the unvarnished truth 
without the President lurking over his 
shoulder. 
Dr. Fauci, let it rip. 
But it shouldn’t be this one com-
mittee 
hearing 
tomorrow, 
and 
it 
shouldn’t be Dr. Fauci alone testifying, 
or even with the two he is testifying 
with. This is the routine oversight 
business of Congress, and we are now in 
a crisis. It should occur in every com-
mittee every week. There should be 
testimony from administration offi-
cials, ranging from Dr. Birx to Sec-
retary Mnuchin, to Secretary DeVos 
and others. 
We should also be debating another 
major emergency relief bill. As we 
speak, more and more businesses are 
going under, more and more people are 
losing their jobs, and more and more 
families don’t have enough food to feed 
their children or are sitting for hours 
in car lines to get to food banks. 
Speaker PELOSI
and I completely 
agree. The new bill should be big, and 
it should be bold, and that is what the 
House is working on right now, while 
the Senate, under Leader MCCONNELL’s 
leadership, dithers. 
Already, however, we have heard that 
congressional Republicans are telling 
everyone they want to slow down. 
Leader MCCONNELL says he wants to 
hit the pause button. President Trump 
and administration officials are saying 
we might not need to do anything more 
to help the country. This would be a 
catastrophic mistake. 
At the outset of the Great Depres-
sion, President Hoover was also reluc-
tant to use national resources to at-
tack the problem. He, too, was ideo-
logically opposed to a vigorous and 
strong response from the Federal Gov-
ernment. President Hoover’s failure 
was likely responsible for extending 
the length and deepening the severity 
of the Great Depression. 
If President Trump and our Repub-
lican colleagues go the way of Herbert 
Hoover, if they oppose or slow-walk 
government intervention to save the 
economy that is hurtling downward, I 
fear the Nation could suffer a similar 
fate—a second depression. We must 
avoid that at all costs. Now is not the 
time for timidity. Now is not the time 
for small thinking. Now is the time for 
action—big, bold, continued action. 
There are so many issues that de-
serve our attention. On a daily basis, 
President Trump talks about the need 
to reopen our country. Well, President 
Trump, the only way we can safely re-
open the country is if we have testing. 
To finally beat this disease, we need 
testing. To reopen businesses safely, we 
need testing. To reopen schools and 
sporting events, we need testing. To 
contain a resurgence in the fall or 
early next year, we need testing. Test-
ing is, by far, the No. 1 priority from a 
public health standpoint and, maybe, 
from an economic standpoint as well. 
For many countries, mastering the 
challenge of testing and contact trac-
ing their population was their first pri-
ority. Here in the United States, unfor-
tunately, the Trump administration is 
still trying to catch up. Three months 
ago—3 months ago—President Trump 
said: ‘‘Anybody that wants a test can 
get a test.’’ That is still not even close 
to being true. 
Americans have gotten sick, and be-
cause they could not get tested, they 
never knew if they contracted COVID 
and never knew if they passed it on to 
loved ones, colleagues, workers, or 
friends. For many who could get test-
ed, they had to wait weeks for an an-
swer, long after the disease had run its 
course and potentially spread to oth-
ers. 
We may never know the full extent of 
the human consequences that resulted 
from President Trump’s administra-
tion’s failure to rapidly develop a test-
ing 
plan 
in 
the 
early 
days 
of 
coronavirus, but we do know that coun-
tries that did it successfully—such as 
South Korea, Germany, Australia, and 
New Zealand—were able to deal with 
the virus much better than we have. 
And to think the United States, which 
has always been the leader in public 
health, is lagging behind these other 
countries because of the President’s de-
nial and ineptitude should bother every 
single American, no matter what your 
politics. 
Congress provided $25 billion in the 
most recent relief legislation to in-
crease testing capacity and contact 
tracing, and we are going to need to do 
more. If President Trump is so keen on 
speeding up the process of reopening 
the country, we should endorse what 
Democrats have urged him to do: Cre-
ate a national testing regime imme-
diately. 
On one final matter, education, in 
the CARES Act, Congress provided a 
little over $30 billion to help States, 
school districts, and higher education 
systems respond to the coronavirus 
after many schools were forced to close 
or to move to remote learning. We need 
more money than that, of course, and I 
think Democrats in both Houses agree. 
It has come to our attention that 
Secretary DeVos has been using a por-
tion of the existing funding not to help 
States or localities cope with the crisis 
but to augment her push for voucher- 
like programs, a prior initiative that 
had nothing to do with COVID–19. 
We have also learned that Secretary 
DeVos has added restrictions to the 
fund that weren’t included in the law, 
including guidance that DACA recipi-
ents cannot receive aid. Shameful— 
there is no other word for it. Secretary 
DeVos is exploiting emergency relief 
funding to further her own rigid ideo-
logical agenda and deprive students of 
desperately needed Federal assistance. 
The Secretary of Education should re-
verse course immediately. 
Subsequently, DeVos should testify 
in Congress as soon as possible. As 
someone who has habitually skipped 
congressional 
hearings, 
Secretary 
DeVos has a lot to answer for. If our 
students had the same attendance 
record as Secretary DeVos, they would 
have flunked out of school. Secretary 
DeVos needs to come clean about how 
her Department is exploiting congres-
sional relief efforts intended to help 
schools recover and reopen. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ERNST). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, as 
our 
Nation’s 
war 
against 
the 
coronavirus has waged on, the Senate 
has taken decisive action to provide 
the resources we need to win the fight. 
We sent critical equipment to our 
frontline healthcare workers, and we 
have expanded testing resources na-
tionwide. We provided loans to small 
businesses in order to protect jobs, and 
we sent direct financial assistance to 
the Americans who are struggling the 
hardest to make ends meet. These four 
bills—now law—passed by Congress 
have addressed both the public health 
crisis at the heart of the pandemic and 
the ensuing economic fallout. 
Now, with the States beginning to 
gradually reopen their economies, we 
are staring down the barrel of a second 
epidemic, one generated by opportun-
istic lawsuits, crushing legal fees, and 
drawn-out court battles. 
According to a database compiled by 
law firm Hunton Andrews Kurth, more 
than 950 such lawsuits have already 
been filed in the United States. We 
have seen suits against healthcare 
workers, nursing homes, colleges, gov-
ernments, retailers—you name it. As 
our economy begins to reopen, unfortu-
nately, so will the legal floodgates. The 
litigation epidemic is shaping up to be 
a big one.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2334 
May 11, 2020 
Now, don’t get me wrong, lawyers 
aren’t all bad. I confess to being one 
myself. And there will no doubt be 
some meritorious claims. But many 
suits potentially serve as the cash 
cow—a chance to shake down a busi-
ness for a nuisance settlement due to 
the cost alone of defending a lawsuit, 
even if you win. 
With a pandemic that has affected 
more than 1 million Americans, you 
better believe there are some preparing 
for a gold rush. You can hear the TV 
commercials now asking if you or a 
loved 
one 
was 
impacted 
by 
the 
coronavirus, encouraging you to call a 
1–800 number to see if you could be en-
titled to some money. 
Imagine you are a nurse who is being 
sued by the family of a patient who 
tragically passed away at your hos-
pital. Even though you acted in good 
faith and you took every precaution to 
save the life of the patient, you could 
get pulled into a nightmarish legal 
fight over a case that ends up having 
no merit in the first place. 
Let’s say you are a small business 
owner who closed your doors at the 
start of the pandemic, but then you ap-
plied for the loans, and you have done 
everything in your power to stay afloat 
until you could reopen. When that time 
comes, you take every precaution. 
Your employees wear masks, you re-
duce the number of customers so as to 
provide for social distancing, you regu-
larly clean your store, and you have 
hand sanitizer available for all employ-
ees and customers. But then somebody 
says that they contracted the virus in 
your store and that they are going to 
sue you. Well, I have no doubt that, un-
less we provide for some limitations, 
there will be businesses that will say: 
Why bother? Why take on the risk? It 
is just not worth it. 
We know small businesses provide 
the lion’s share of the jobs in our econ-
omy, and they can get roped into 
spending all their savings—what is 
left—to defend or settle a nuisance law-
suit. And the fear of these con-
sequences could worsen the toll this 
crisis has already taken on our econ-
omy. 
We simply cannot allow a flood of 
frivolous lawsuits to harm our incred-
ible healthcare workers or stunt our 
economic recovery. As we speak, I am 
working with colleagues on legislation 
to address the anticipated lawsuit bo-
nanza. 
Let me be clear. Not all lawsuits are 
created equal. Without a doubt, there 
will be legitimate claims as a result of 
reckless wrongdoing in the wake of 
this pandemic. Those are the types of 
cases we want to make sure are heard. 
Last week, the Utah Daily Herald re-
ported that one business required staff 
who tested positive for the COVID–19 
to report to work anyway. Almost half 
of the business’s employees tested posi-
tive. You don’t have to be Perry Mason 
or Matlock—I realize I am dating my-
self here—to see that this is an egre-
gious violation of Federal guidelines. 
There is no desire to impede the effort 
to hold bad actors accountable, period. 
That is my guiding principle. The prob-
lem is with the expected onslaught of 
frivolous claims, which will do nothing 
more than harm the very people al-
ready hurt by this virus. 
Just because a lawsuit is baseless 
doesn’t mean it will be quick, easy, or 
cheap to resolve, and we can’t put our 
healthcare 
workers 
in 
a 
situation 
where, after battling this virus for 
months on end, they then have to bat-
tle a false claim in court. 
Future legislation should include li-
ability protections for our frontline 
workers and small businesses that are 
complying with the very government 
regulations designed to protect against 
the spread of the virus. 
More than a dozen Governors have al-
ready provided liability protections to 
healthcare workers, but we can’t just 
depend on the States to uphold these 
protections. We can’t wait for the dam 
to break. Congress must act to provide 
the shield for the healthcare workers 
who have done everything in their 
power to save lives during this unprec-
edented crisis. 
Again, to state the obvious, this 
would not interfere with liability for 
intentional or grossly negligent con-
duct. As I said before, no one wants to 
put a stop to meritorious lawsuits. We 
want to prevent baseless claims from 
tying up our courts, destroying jobs, 
and holding our economy hostage. 
There are several ways to accomplish 
this, but we need to focus on a solution 
that provides clarity for our businesses 
and prevents gamesmanship in the 
courts. 
Michael Krauss is a law professor at 
George Mason University who special-
izes in tort law. He has pointed out 
that employees can get workers’ com-
pensation benefits if they become sick 
or disabled on the job. In other words, 
employees will be covered by existing 
workers’ compensation laws. We are 
talking about third-party claims, not 
employees. Defending lawsuits, no mat-
ter how far-fetched, is expensive, and 
litigation costs alone can make the dif-
ference between the destruction and 
survival of a business. 
Professor Krauss said that in his 
opinion, the ideal statute would say: 
‘‘If you do the following, you may not 
be sued.’’ He said that could include a 
list 
of 
requirements, 
like 
wearing 
masks. There could be specific regula-
tions for restaurants, meatpackers, or 
other industries. 
Any liability limitations will only 
protect the individuals and companies 
that comply with Federal guidelines 
and seek to keep their workers and the 
public safe. 
My colleagues and I have been in dis-
cussions about the best way to do this, 
and we are actively developing a pro-
posal that I hope will gain bipartisan 
support. There are fair and reasonable 
ways to deal with this. We have seen 
this before. This is not a novel concept. 
Whether it is the response to the Y2K 
paranoia around the turn of the cen-
tury or the attacks of 9/11, there are 
many more examples where Congress 
has, on a bipartisan basis, responded to 
a national emergency and provided 
these sorts of commonsense legal pro-
tections. 
As we continue to work to support 
the American people during the crisis 
we are facing today, we can’t ignore 
the onslaught of lawsuits that could 
soon bankrupt small businesses and 
strangle our recovering economy. Con-
gress must act to ensure America 
doesn’t wake up from this pandemic 
only to find itself in a legal nightmare 
that we could have and should have 
prevented. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
RUSSIA 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
in the last several weeks, a lot of infor-
mation relating to the FBI’s Russia in-
vestigation has been declassified and 
made public. That is in large part 
thanks to action taken by Attorney 
General Barr and action taken by Act-
ing Director Grenell at DNI on declas-
sification of a lot of things that should 
have been declassified a long time ago. 
Their acts of transparency are finally 
shining a light on the dark corners of 
the Federal Government. The public’s 
business ought to be public. There is 
too much overclassification in the Fed-
eral Government. Barr and Grenell are 
doing what they ought to do, and I 
hope they keep it up. 
In the last several weeks, we have 
also seen a lot of denial from some 
quarters in the media about the infor-
mation that has been released. 
Also last week, former President 
Obama said the rule of law is at risk 
because of the Justice Department’s 
dismissal of the Flynn case. Contrary 
to what President Obama believes or 
the media might say, I believe the op-
posite is true. The rule of law is at risk 
if the Federal Government can get 
away with violating the Constitution 
to do what they did to Lieutenant Gen-
eral Flynn. 
When it comes to those violations 
and other misconduct by former gov-
ernment 
officials, 
Obama 
and 
the 
mainstream media pundits all seem to 
be silent all of a sudden. I have heard 
no comment from Mr. Obama about the 
independent inspector general’s find-
ings that Andrew McCabe lied under 
oath to Federal investigators multiple 
times or about how Department of Jus-
tice prosecutors falsely told the court 
that they had produced all Brady mate-
rial to Flynn. I didn’t hear them when 
the Federal Government surveilled an 
American citizen connected to the 
Trump 
campaign 
without 
probable 
cause and based on intelligence that 
the FBI knew was questionable at best. 
There is too much silence on some-
thing that now is so obvious. 
Since 2017, I have aggressively pur-
sued the Flynn investigation to find 
out more about why the FBI decided to

May 11, 2020 
interview Flynn, make him a subject of 
an investigation, and then why the 
Justice Department eventually charged 
him. From the beginning, I wanted to 
know the facts of the case, and from 
the beginning, none of what I found 
looked right. Having done good govern-
ment oversight for over 40 years, I 
know a government foul-up when I see 
it. 
The public knows a lot more than 
they did in 2017 when the news first 
broke about this Flynn case. For exam-
ple, we know that on January 4, 2017, 
the FBI wrote a closing memorandum 
on Flynn, who was code-named ‘‘Cross-
fire Razor’’ by the FBI. That memo-
randum said the intelligence commu-
nity could find no derogatory informa-
tion on the general. 
On the very same day the FBI was 
ready to close the Flynn case, Peter 
Strzok asked another FBI agent some-
thing like this: ‘‘Hey, if you haven’t 
closed Razor, don’t do it yet.’’ So 
Strzok obviously had another agenda. 
The case was still open at that mo-
ment, and Strzok asked that it be kept 
open ‘‘for now.’’ Strzok then quickly 
messaged Lisa Page, saying that Razor 
still happened to be open because of 
some oversight and said: ‘‘Yeah, our 
utter incompetence actually helps us. 
20 percent of the time . . . ’’ 
During the course of my oversight 
activities of the FBI, I have uncovered 
and made public large amounts of 
Strzok’s and Page’s messages. When re-
viewing all the faults and disasters of 
the Russia investigation, these text 
messages are very, very important. 
They are the free expression of these 
top 
FBI 
employees’ 
mindset, 
unencumbered by rules or decorum. 
They give us a look at what the drivers 
of the Russia investigation actually be-
lieved. 
In August 2016, just after the FBI 
opened the Russia investigation, Page 
said: ‘‘Trump’s not ever going to be-
come president, right? Right?!?’’ She is 
the one who edited Flynn’s 302 sum-
mary along with Strzok, which contra-
dicted the original 302. Strzok re-
sponded to the Page quote that I just 
gave about whether Trump would ever 
become President this way: ‘‘No. No he 
won’t. We’ll stop it.’’ Their animus to-
wards Trump helps to explain why they 
cut corners and why they didn’t follow 
regular protocol in running their in-
quiry. 
On January 5, 2017, the day after 
Strzok moved to keep the Flynn case 
open, President Obama met with Direc-
tor Comey, Deputy Attorney General 
Sally Yates, Vice President Biden, and 
National Security Advisor Susan Rice. 
At that meeting, they briefed Presi-
dent Obama on the Russia investiga-
tion. It is unclear to what extent they 
discussed the details of the investiga-
tion amongst each other, but given all 
that we know now regarding the fake 
foundation to the inquiry, it is time we 
asked: What did Obama and Biden 
know, and when did they know it? 
During the course of my oversight, I 
acquired an email from Susan Rice. 
She sent herself an email on Obama’s 
last day in office, January 20, 2017. 
That email memorialized the alleged 
contents of the January 5, 2017, meet-
ing with Obama that I previously re-
ferred to. As I noted in 2018 when I 
made the email public, I found it very 
odd that among her activities in the 
final moments of the final day of the 
Obama administration, that she would 
write herself an email about a meeting 
that happened several weeks prior 
about this investigation. According to 
Rice, Obama wanted everything done 
‘‘by the book.’’ 
Of course, we now know that never 
happened. She also said, in part: ‘‘The 
President’’—as 
in 
Obama—‘‘asked 
Comey to inform him if anything 
changes in the next few weeks that 
should affect how we share classified 
information with the incoming team.’’ 
Then, 1 week later, on January 12, 
2017, somebody in the Obama adminis-
tration leaked the Flynn-Kislyak call 
to the Washington Post that, for the 
very first time, ignited rumors about 
Flynn’s association with Russians and 
a possible violation of the arcane 
Logan Act. 
Now, wasn’t this really a perfectly 
timed leak—one that would help to cre-
ate a fake foundation to interview 
Flynn? 
Well, guess what happened. Twelve 
days later, on January 24, 2017, Strzok 
interviewed Flynn in the White House. 
Prior to that interview, Comey chose 
not to follow normal protocols to in-
form the White House that the FBI in-
tended to interview an employee. Now, 
we all know that the FBI would nor-
mally work through the White House 
counsel to have discussions for ap-
proval and who would be present at 
that interview. 
You have seen it on television several 
times this weekend: Comey bragging 
about getting away with skirting the 
rules. When he was asked in a 2018 
interview about how he did it, Comey 
said—and this is what showed up in 
these last weekends: 
I sent them— 
Meaning he sent the FBI agents to 
interview. 
I 
sent 
them. 
Something 
I 
probably 
wouldn’t have done or even gotten away with 
in a more organized investigation, a more or-
ganized administration. 
According to Comey’s former assist-
ant, Comey said: ‘‘We just decided, you 
know, screw it,’’ in reference to their 
breaking 
protocol 
with 
the 
White 
House. 
Now, I referred to an email that said 
the President wanted to do this by the 
book. Well, what I just described to 
you is hardly ‘‘by the book.’’ Flynn was 
never told during this interview what 
he was being secretly interrogated for, 
and the whole thing was done without 
Flynn having an attorney present. In 
fact, I think I recall they even told him 
he didn’t need an attorney. 
Now, we know that the FBI had no 
real investigative purpose to interview 
Flynn. We also know, based upon FBI 
notes, that agents apparently inter-
viewed Flynn to trick him in a lie so 
that they could prosecute him or get 
him fired. That prosecuting him or get-
ting him fired are very clear in some 
notes that we got from the FBI, hand-
written notes. 
Keep in mind that the FBI had pre-
pared to close this case weeks before, 
except it didn’t quite get closed be-
cause Strzok came in and said: Can we 
keep it open—or something to that ef-
fect. 
The FBI already had the transcript of 
the Flynn-Ambassador Kislyak call. 
They knew exactly what was discussed. 
So what was the point of interviewing 
Flynn if they already had the tran-
script? 
Well, lucky for Strzok, the FBI had 
not technically closed the Flynn case. 
So he figured yet they could lay a trap 
for Flynn, and they did lay a trap. 
In doing so, they didn’t warn him 
that he was under investigation. They 
went around the Justice Department, 
and I made it very clear how they by-
passed the White House on interview 
protocols, because Comey was bragging 
on television about that. 
Under Comey’s leadership, the FBI 
abused government powers in ways 
that our Founders and Framers feared 
most, because they had had enough of 
George III. They weren’t going to let it 
happen again in the United States. 
That is why they wrote the Constitu-
tion the way they did. 
The Russia investigation, in other 
words, is a textbook example of what 
not to do. At every step of the inves-
tigation, the government sought evi-
dence to advance it, never got the evi-
dence that they needed to advance it, 
and advanced the investigation any-
way. 
That is pretty clearly an abuse of 
power. 
Let’s recall that Comey also leaked 
his memos of his private discussions 
with President Trump to get the spe-
cial 
counsel, 
Mueller, 
appointed. 
Comey is pretty smart. He had a plan. 
It worked. That plan worked to get 
Mueller appointed. Mueller did his 
work for 2 years, and it cost the tax-
payers $30 million. In the end, Mueller 
found no collusion and no obstruction, 
which is exactly the same information 
that the House Intelligence Commit-
tee’s 50-plus depositions told us. Those 
were done way back—not way back but 
a little way back—in 2017. Mueller fin-
ished his job in 2019. That is more than 
$30 million just to reinvent the wheel. 
Now, with respect to Comey, I think 
it is monumentally important to point 
out a piece of his testimony from 2017, 
before the House Intelligence Com-
mittee. Comey said the following: 
. . . we had an open counterintelligence in-
vestigation on Mr. Flynn, and it had been 
open since the summertime, and we were 
very close to closing it. In fact, I had—I 
think I had authorized it to be closed at the 
end of December, beginning of January. 
Now, Comey leaked his memos so 
that the public would know the Presi-
dent allegedly said to him that he

May 11, 2020 
hoped Comey would let the whole 
Flynn thing go. That is what the hook 
was to getting a special counsel ap-
pointed. 
Not once in Comey’s memos did he 
mention that by the time that con-
versation occurred, he had already au-
thorized the Flynn case to be closed. 
Don’t you think that is a material fact 
that would put the proper context on 
his interactions with Trump? 
Attorney General Barr is exactly 
right. What the FBI did to Flynn can-
not be justified by any angle of review. 
What the FBI did is to flout the rules, 
the law, and the Constitution. Entrap-
ment is unconstitutional. 
That is where the outrage ought to 
be—not on the dismissal of the case but 
on facts that the case was brought in 
the first place and a good man’s life 
was destroyed. 
Mueller had all these facts. He had 
documents. He had the Brady material. 
He had the FBI notes and contradic-
tory 302 summaries. He had the emails. 
He had all the information that showed 
Flynn was set up, targeted, and pres-
sured to plead guilty in a secret side 
deal between the Mueller team and his 
former lawyers, only because he was 
running out of money and the govern-
ment was coming after his son. 
Flynn did what maybe a lot of people 
would do when your family is at stake. 
Flynn did what he did to save his fam-
ily from financial ruin and his son from 
reputational ruin. He did what any fa-
ther would do for his family. 
If it can happen to Flynn, it can hap-
pen to you. It can happen to any Amer-
ican, and, in some ways, this also hap-
pened to a person named Carter Page 
and with the illegal surveillance on 
Carter Page. 
You know, in this business of self- 
government and this business of con-
stitutional safeguards, we still are in a 
constant battle between liberty and 
tyranny, and we have seen some tyr-
anny in regard to Flynn. My fellow 
Americans, let’s use the Russia inves-
tigation and all of its shortcomings to 
forever guard against the tyranny of 
the Federal Government. 
On one last thing, people are con-
stantly phoning our offices and want-
ing to know when all the people who 
did the injustice to Flynn are going to 
be prosecuted, because they think 
there are two standards of justice. You 
know, they announced yesterday that 
McCabe isn’t going to be prosecuted. 
But Flynn was entrapped to be pros-
ecuted, and how wrong that is. A lot of 
people want justice brought to the peo-
ple who did the injustice, and I think 
they ought to be prosecuted. 
But even more important than pros-
ecuting him, it is about time that 
these facts get out so the public knows 
the injustice that is going on within 
our government, within the FBI, in the 
highest levels of the FBI. 
We aren’t finding fault with the peo-
ple in the FBI who are doing what 
needs to be done to bring law and order 
to our country, but when we have these 
unusual, illegal, unconstitutional, cor-
rupt things that happened to Flynn, it 
ought to wake up the American people. 
It ought to wake up those of us in gov-
ernment to make sure it never happens 
again.

NATIONAL POLICE WEEK 
Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, I 
rise today to recognize the National 
Police Week in honor of the men and 
women who serve and protect our com-
munities. The individuals called to up-
hold the rule of law do so in times of 
crisis, and they serve their families, 
friends, and neighbors at a moment’s 
notice. They are selfless public serv-
ants who courageously face danger 
head-on. 
Law enforcement officers respond to 
calls for help while not knowing what 
challenges they will face. We are in a 
unique time right now and experi-
encing unprecedented challenges in our 
country. Law enforcement officers are 
working to protect citizens while also 
safeguarding themselves against the 
unseen enemy of COVID–19. 
The disease has forced departments 
in Arkansas and all over the country to 
change protocols in order to prevent 
the spread of the disease, but that 
hasn’t stopped the resolve, the deter-
mination, and the passion of officers to 
defend the community. Despite this 
new challenge, they continue to serve 
with the same level of professionalism 
and integrity. 
We are working to provide depart-
ments and agencies with additional re-
sources to safeguard these public safe-
ty officers. I am pleased the Depart-
ment of Justice recently awarded Ar-
kansas near $7 million so we can better 
serve the safety needs of officers in the 
State and get them personal protective 
equipment—gloves, masks, and sani-
tizer—that they need in order to per-
form their job safely. This funding is 
vital as the calls for assistance keep 
coming and police officers continue to 
respond to these emergencies. 
I want to thank our law enforcement 
officers for their bravery today and al-
ways. It takes a special person to put 
their life on the line every day to pro-
tect our communities. We are fortu-
nate to have some of the very best in 
Arkansas. 
National Police Week is a time that 
we honor the sacrifices of individuals 
who selflessly serve their community 
and give their lives, if necessary, while 
in the line of duty. We preserve their 
legacies by adding their names to the 
National Law Enforcement Officers 
Memorial in Washington, DC, to serve 
as a reminder of their sacrifices. 
This year, the names of 307 fallen of-
ficers will be added to the memorial, 
including five Arkansans. The names of 
Game Warden Ollie Mitts, Deputy 
Sheriff George Rogers, Deputy Sheriff 
Ulyss Baldwin, Fayetteville Police Of-
ficer Stephen Carr, and Stone County 
Sergeant Michael Stephen, Sr. are new 
to the memorial. We will remember 
forever them as heroes. 
I am a proud cosponsor of the Senate 
resolution marking National Police 
Week because we must always remem-
ber the brave officers whose lives were 
cut short because of their public duty 
and recognize those who continue to 
selfishly serve to keep us safe. 
I am proud to honor the individuals 
who are called to serve and protect and 
will advocate for policies that provide 
our communities and officers with the 
resources they need to protect them-
selves. 
Thank you to the officers in Arkan-
sas and those all across the country for 
upholding the law, protecting the com-
munity, and saving lives. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BOOZMAN). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
PROTECTING HUMAN RIGHTS DURING PANDEMIC 
ACT 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, to 
all of my colleagues and to our staff 
here in the Chamber, those who are 
mothers, I hope they had a wonderful 
Mother’s Day weekend, and it is a joy 
to return to work today. I will tell you, 
I am really blessed to have some of 
those moms. They are policy experts, 
and they are a part of my staff. I listen 
a lot to what they have to say. 
Like with all of our staff, I admire 
their dedication and their focus—espe-
cially now and especially when it 
comes to discussing how this COVID 
crisis is affecting their children, how 
they are learning and how they are uti-
lizing technology to communicate and 
practicing distance learning and hear-
ing what schools are doing as they are 
all going through a learning curve. We 
are all going through a learning curve 
on how to utilize technology. 
The thing that is so significant, as I 
talked to so many of these working 
moms and dads, what we realize and 
they realize and what they highlight 
with me is that embodied in this tech-
nology, we have a lot of dangers that 
exist and vulnerabilities that are being 
created to the privacy of our children. 
Long before students were forced to 
attend classes via webcam, Congress 
began taking a hard look at how the 
companies providing digital classrooms 
were protecting what I term the ‘‘vir-
tual you’’—you and your presence on-
line—how they were protecting that 
virtual you of underage users.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2337 
May 11, 2020 
As it turns out, what we found in the 
work that we were doing—some of it I 
did while I was in the House, as chair-
man of the Subcommittee on Commu-
nications and Technology of Energy 
and Commerce, and some of that work 
I continued here. But back in 2015, as 
we started doing a deeper dive on what 
was happening with protecting privacy 
and presence online, the Electronic 
Frontier Foundation filed a complaint 
with the FTC against Google, alleging 
that their Google for Education plat-
form was exploiting students’ personal 
information and potentially exposing it 
to third parties. 
Think about this. The Google for 
Education program—kids were logging 
on, and they were using this. Google— 
what were they doing? Data mining. 
What were they doing with what they 
were data mining, which is your infor-
mation? They were then sharing that 
with third parties. And guess what. 
You didn’t know. The parents didn’t 
know, and the children didn’t know. 
What we found out was that one wrong 
click, and any program administrator 
could expose a student’s virtual you to 
potential outside websites. A 2017 re-
port from the Electronic Frontier 
Foundation confirmed and expanded on 
these concerns. Even free products can 
come at the cost of student privacy. 
Last month, Google donated 4,000 
Chromebooks to students in rural Cali-
fornia—4,000 
Chromebooks. 
That 
sounds like a very generous donation, a 
way to help close that digital divide, a 
way to connect students to the inter-
net, to open up the world and bring the 
world in to them. The problem is that 
this year, the State of New Mexico 
sued Google over a similar program, al-
leging 
that 
Google 
was 
using 
Chromebooks to track students. Well, 
how about that? Here you go. Here is a 
free Chromebook. Use it. But what hap-
pens? All of that research work you 
were doing via Google is being data- 
mined, tracked, and shared. 
We need to be wary of these free pro-
grams because what we now know is 
that when it is free, you and your in-
formation and your child’s information 
is tracked, it is data-mined, and it is 
shared. That means that you and your 
information 
are 
the 
product—the 
freebie, if you will. The Chromebook is 
simply the way, the mechanism to take 
your information from you and allow 
Google or Big Tech to have it, and then 
they sell it to somebody over here who 
is going to do what with it? Guess 
what. They are going to be marketing 
back to you. That data is a valuable re-
source, and what do they do once they 
have data-mined it? They are going to 
sell it to whoever is willing to pay the 
highest price so they can use it and 
market back to you and your kids 
something that they want you to buy. 
Now, that is what is happening. 
I am sure everyone remembers the 
video platform Zoom. Many of us have 
probably used it in meetings even 
today. Zoom was thrust into the spot-
light as we started this COVID crisis, 
and after watchdogs uncovered not 
only a research and development pres-
ence in China but protocols that al-
lowed data, including—now, I want you 
to listen to this. This is one of those 
buyer beware things—user beware. We 
are talking about Zoom. What was dis-
covered was that Zoom allowed data, 
including screen captures and video— 
that means you on screen; you, your 
face, and video; what you are saying; 
the presentation you are making; the 
question you are asking—all of that to 
flow in and out of China. 
Schools, corporations, and even Sen-
ate offices have all been forced to ques-
tion this platform, to give up this plat-
form and to find some other way to 
communicate. We know that many of 
our children are going to school in 
Zoom classrooms every day. In our 
churches, our choirs are singing on 
Zoom, and sermons are being delivered 
on Zoom. 
The rise in mandatory use of tech-
nology by students prompted me, along 
with 
Senators 
MARKEY, 
HAWLEY, 
BLUMENTHAL, CASSIDY, and DURBIN, to 
ask the FTC to launch a major inves-
tigation into how these platforms are 
protecting student privacy. What we 
are wanting to know is, what are you 
doing to put that wall there so that the 
information of these underage users, 
these children, is not going to be 
shared? What are you doing to make 
certain that their faces, their images, 
their voices, and their questions are 
not going to be captured? Can you 
imagine anything more frightening 
than to think your child is sitting in a 
Zoom classroom, and this data is flow-
ing to China, and somebody is cap-
turing these images, and then that is 
going to be shared with somebody you 
don’t know. You don’t know what they 
are going to do with it, and you don’t 
know why they want it, and you, as a 
parent, have chosen to completely stay 
off social media because you don’t 
want that kind of intrusion into your 
child’s life. 
Don’t you think that these corpora-
tions ought to figure this out, that this 
is an area of concern for moms and 
dads and grandmoms and granddads, to 
protect these children? Oh, but it 
doesn’t matter to China, does it? All 
China is interested in is making a buck 
off the American consumer. They feel 
like, if you use our service, we have got 
that right. I think we need to be send-
ing a message to them. 
Both the education technology and 
the digital advertising industries are 
notoriously opaque about their privacy 
policies. I am joined by other members 
of the Judiciary Committee Tech Task 
Force in having conversations with 
many of these companies, and I will 
tell you, we have made some progress. 
I have been pleased with many of the 
companies’ willingness to share with us 
some of these policies and to look for 
ways that we can protect unsuspecting 
consumers and our precious children. 
Since the FTC is preparing to con-
sider revisions to the Children’s Online 
Privacy Protection Act, COPPA, now is 
the perfect time. It is the necessary 
time for a deep dive into the data col-
lection and processing practices of 
these firms. 
You know what, sometimes we hear 
the phrase ‘‘Oh, let’s do it for the chil-
dren.’’ ‘‘This is for the children.’’ ‘‘We 
have to do this or that for the chil-
dren.’’ Let me tell you something right 
now: This is one of those things that 
are absolutely for the children, to pro-
tect them online so that Big Tech and 
some of these China-owned compa-
nies—and bear in mind, colleagues, if 
you are doing business in China and if 
you are a company in China, who are 
you owned by? Who do you answer to? 
You answer to the Chinese Communist 
Party. I will tell you right now, I do 
not want them to have images of our 
children, data on where they sit, where 
they go to school, and what their inter-
ests are. 
These privacy policies have to be re-
viewed. We want to make absolutely 
sure that the FTC has all the facts 
they need to be certain we keep chil-
dren safe online. Section 6 of the FTC 
Act empowers them to do this. I urge 
agency officials to make use of that au-
thority. This is an imperative. The 
pandemic has shown us that it only 
takes a little disruption to prompt bad 
actors to take advantage of a situa-
tion. 
Here in the U.S., even during a pan-
demic, we have the right to challenge 
laws that we feel are unjust. But in 
many places around the world, the pan-
demic has provided an opportunity for 
oppressive regimes to enact so-called 
emergency laws that restrict human 
rights without justification or over-
sight. China and Russia—two of the big 
offenders—have used the crisis to ramp 
up their use of surveillance to restrict 
privacy and freedom of movement. ‘‘We 
have to do it. We have a pandemic.’’ 
That is what they say. 
In Bolivia and the Philippines, gov-
ernment officials are using the pan-
demic as an excuse to silence their leg-
islative bodies and punish critics. ‘‘Oh, 
leave it to us. We are going to be able 
to solve this. You don’t need to weigh 
in.’’ That is what they are saying. 
In Cambodia, Venezuela, Belarus, 
Egypt, 
Turkey, 
South 
Africa, 
and 
many other countries, officials are fol-
lowing 
China’s 
playbook 
and 
pre-
venting the journalists from publishing 
news that contradicts official propa-
ganda. ‘‘Don’t bother with the truth. 
We are going to make up a version of 
the truth and then that is what we are 
going to tell people. Don’t listen to 
anything else. Listen to us. We have 
truth coming at you. We are making it 
up as we go.’’ That is what they are 
saying. 
The way they are using surveillance 
to limit freedom and to craft a message 
is something that should frighten ev-
eryone. It is all happening under the 
guise of ‘‘combating COVID–19.’’ 
So last week, Senator MARKEY and I 
filed a bill that will help address these

abuses. I thank Senator MARKEY for 
the great work he does on human 
rights and also the work he and I did 
on the House on online privacy. 
The Protecting Human Rights Dur-
ing Pandemic Act would require the 
State Department and the U.S. Agency 
for 
International 
Development—or 
USAID—to take actions to prevent 
human rights abuses in the name of 
coronavirus response. The bill author-
izes funding through 2025 for programs 
that support human rights defense dur-
ing and in the aftermath of harmful re-
sponses to the pandemic. Congress 
would receive strategic plans from the 
State Department and USAID detailing 
how those funds are being put to use, 
as well as regular reports on human 
rights violations perpetrated in the 
name of pandemic response. 
The spread of COVID–19 has forced 
businesses, families, and governments 
to take extraordinary measures to pro-
tect human life. Some have proven ef-
fective; unfortunately, others are miss-
ing the mark. We still have much to do 
in terms of pandemic response, and we 
continue to work on it every day. But 
I encourage my colleagues not to let 
the severity of our situation distract 
from our responsibility to set an exam-
ple for the rest of the world. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Idaho is recognized. 
NOMINATION OF BRIAN D. MONTGOMERY 
Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise 
today to urge my colleagues to confirm 
Brian Montgomery as the next Deputy 
Secretary of the U.S. Department of 
Housing and Urban Development. Mr. 
Montgomery is among the most re-
spected voices in the housing market, 
as well as one of the most experienced. 
His breadth of experience includes 
service as the head of the Federal 
Housing Administration—or FHA—dur-
ing 
the 
Bush 
administration, 
the 
Obama administration, and the Trump 
administration. 
Mr. 
Montgomery 
guided 
FHA 
through the 2008 financial crisis and 
has provided steadfast leadership at 
the FHA through the ongoing COVID– 
19 pandemic, arguably the two most 
turbulent times for the housing market 
in a generation. 
Prior to the COVID–19 outbreak, he 
oversaw the return of FHA’s insurance 
fund to its strongest financial position 
since fiscal year 2007, while continuing 
to provide affordable homeownership 
opportunities to tens of thousands of 
first-time homebuyers each year. Since 
the outbreak, he has worked to make 
sure that FHA performs its traditional 
countercyclical role of maintaining li-
quidity and credit access in the mort-
gage market where traditional sources 
of home financing may have dried up. 
For over a year now, Mr. Mont-
gomery has also served in the capacity 
of Acting Deputy Secretary at HUD, 
where he has managed the day-to-day 
operations of the Department under 
Secretary 
Ben 
Carson. 
Mr. 
Mont-
gomery knows the Department inside 
and out and has been intimately in-
volved in carrying out HUD’s mission 
to create strong, sustainable, inclusive 
communities and quality affordable 
housing opportunities for millions of 
Americans. 
He has been described by the Na-
tional Multifamily Housing Council as 
‘‘a housing policy veteran with deep ex-
pertise and experience across a wide 
variety of policy areas.’’ The National 
Association of Homebuilders has noted 
that ‘‘throughout his government and 
private sector career, Brian has proven 
himself to be both an expert in afford-
able housing policy, as well as an out-
standing Federal agency administrator 
and communicator.’’ 
This confirmation vote comes at a 
critical time. In the wake of COVID–19, 
we have already seen a huge number of 
mortgage borrowers enter forbearance, 
while many landlords are struggling to 
make ends meet, and countless renters 
are unsure where their next rent pay-
ment will come from. Homeless shel-
ters are at or near capacity and facing 
novel 
issues 
related 
to 
social 
distancing, and the homeless commu-
nity, who may be particularly exposed 
to the risk of contracting COVID–19, is 
leaning on HUD for help. 
HUD has a central role to play in ad-
dressing these challenges and more. 
The CARES Act acknowledges this im-
portant role, entrusting HUD with over 
$12 billion in additional funding to pro-
vide immediate relief and to address 
emerging issues. Bold leadership is es-
pecially needed during this critical 
time for HUD, and Mr. Montgomery is 
a trusted voice who fits the mold per-
fectly. 
Fifteen years ago, this body con-
firmed Mr. Montgomery on a voice vote 
to serve as FHA Commissioner. Two 
years ago, we confirmed him as FHA 
Commissioner, again, on a strong bi-
partisan vote of 74–23. 
I support Brian Montgomery, and I 
urge my colleagues to join me today in 
voting ‘‘yes’’ on his nomination. 
Thank you. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION 
Egypt—AH–64E Refurbished Apache Attack 
Helicopters and Related Eguipment and 
Support 
The Government of Egypt has requested to 
buy equipment to refurbish forty-three (43) 
AH–64E Apache attack helicopters. This in-
cludes: eighty-eight (88) T700–GE–701D en-
gines (86 remanufactured, 2 spares); forty- 
seven (47) AN/ASQ–170 Modernized Target 
Acquisition and Designation Sight/AN/AAR– 
11 Modernized Pilot Night Vision Sensors 
(MTADS/PNVS) (43 remanufactured, 2 new, 2 
spares); forty-five (45) AAR–57 Common Mis-
sile Warning Systems (CMWS) (43 new, 2 
spares); and ninety-two (92) Embedded Global 
Positioning System/Inertial Navigation Sys-
tems (EGI) (86 new, 6 spares). Also included 
are AN/AVR–2B Laser Detecting Sets, AN/ 
APX–119 transponders, Identify Friend or 
Foe (IFF), AN/APN–209 radar altimeters, AN/ 
ARN–149 Automatic Direction Finders, UHF/ 
VHF radio, tactical AN/ARC–201E radio, 
APR–39 Radar Warning Sets, Improved Data 
Modems IDM–401, Enhanced Image Intensi-
fiers EI2, Hellfire launchers M299, 2.75 inch 19 
tube rocket launchers, M230 automatic guns, 
M230 spare gun barrels, MT06 initiators, car-
tridge actuated JAU–59, training devices, 
helmets, simulators, generators, transpor-
tation, wheeled vehicles and organization 
equipment, spare and repair parts, support 
equipment, tools and test equipment, tech-
nical data and publications, personnel train-
ing and training equipment, U.S. govern-
ment and contractor engineering, technical, 
and logistics support services, and other re-
lated elements of logistics support. The esti-
mated total cost is $2.3 billion. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy and national security of the United 
States by helping to improve the security of 
a friendly country that continues to be an 
important strategic partner in the Middle 
East. 
Egypt intends to use these refurbished AH– 
64 helicopters to modernize its armed forces 
to address the shared U.S.-Egyptian interest 
in countering terrorist activities emanating 
from the Sinai Peninsula, which threaten 
Egyptian and Israeli security and undermine 
regional stability. This sale will contribute 
to Egypt’s military goal to update its capa-
bility while further enhancing greater inter-
operability between Egypt, the U.S., and 
other allies. Egypt will have no difficulty 
sustaining these refurbished aircraft. 
The proposed sale will not alter the basic 
military balance in the region. 
The principal contractors involved in this 
program are the Boeing Company, Meza, AZ, 
and Lockheed Martin Corporation, Orlando, 
FL. There are no known offset agreements 
proposed in connection with this potential 
sale. 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
not require the assignment of any additional 
U.S. Government or contractor representa-
tives to Egypt. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The highest classification of the AH–64 
Apache Attack Helicopter AH–64 Apache hel-
icopter is CONFIDENTIAL and the highest 
classification of data and information is SE-
CRET. The AH–64 Apache helicopter weapon 
system contains communications and target 
identification equipment, navigation equip-
ment, aircraft survivability equipment, dis-
plays, and sensors. The airframe itself does 
not contain sensitive technology; however, 
the pertinent equipment listed below will be 
either installed on the aircraft or included in 
the sale: 
a. The AN/ASQ–170 Modernized Target Ac-
quisition and Designation Sight/AN/AAQ-11 
Pilot Night Vision Sensor (MT ADS/PNVS) 
provides day, night, and limited adverse 
weather target information, as well as night 
navigation capabilities. The PNVS provides 
thermal imaging that permits nap-of-the- 
earth flight to, from, and within the battle 
area, while TADS provides the co-pilot gun-
ner with search, detection, recognition, and 
designation by means of Direct View Optics 
(DVO), EI(2) television, and Forward Look-
ing Infrared (FLIR) sighting systems that 
may be used singularly or in combinations. 
b. The AAR–57 Common Missile Warning 
System (CMWS) detects energy emitted by 
threat missiles in-flight, evaluates potential 
false alarm emitters in the environment, de-
clares validity of threat and selects appro-
priate countermeasures. The CMWS consists 
of an Electronic Control Unit (ECU), Electro- 
Optic Missile Sensors (EOMSs), and Se-
quencer and Improved Countermeasures Dis-
penser (ICMD). 
c. The AN/APR–39 Radar Signal Detecting 
Set is a system that provides warnings of 
radar-directed air defense threats and allows 
appropriate countermeasures. This is the 
1553 databus-compatible configuration. 
d. The AN/AVR–2B Laser Warning Set is a 
passive laser warning system that receives,

processes, and displays threat information 
resulting from aircraft illumination by la-
sers on the multi-functional display. 
e. The Embedded Global Positioning Sys-
tem/Inertial Navigation System plus Multi- 
Mode Receiver (EGI+MMR). The aircraft has 
two EGIs which use internal accelerometers, 
rate gyro measurements, and external sensor 
measurements to estimate the aircraft state, 
provides aircraft flight and position data to 
aircraft systems. The EGI is a velocity- 
aided, strap down, ring laser gyro based iner-
tial unit. The EGI unit also houses a GPS re-
ceiver. 
2. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the specific 
hardware and software elements, the infor-
mation could be used to develop counter-
measures that might reduce weapon system 
effectiveness or be used in the development 
of a system with similar or advanced capa-
bilities. 
3. A determination has been made that 
Egypt can provide substantially the same de-
gree of protection of this technology as the 
U.S. Government. This proposed sale is nec-
essary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign pol-
icy and national security objectives outlined 
in the Policy Justification. Moreover, the 
benefits to be derived from this sale, as out-
lined in the Policy Justification, outweigh 
the potential damage that could result if the 
sensitive technology were revealed to unau-
thorized persons. 
4. All defense articles and services listed in 
this transmittal has been authorized for re-
lease and export to Egypt.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION 
Hungary—Advanced Medium Range Air-to- 
Air Missiles Extended Range (AMRAAM-ER) 
The Government of Hungary has requested 
to buy sixty (60) AIM-I20C–7/C–8 AMRAAM- 
ER missiles, and two (2) spare AIM-I20C–7/C– 
8 AMRAAM-ER guidance sections. Also in-
cluded are four (4) AMRAAM-ER training 
missiles (CATM-120C); missile containers; 
spare and repair parts; cryptographic and 
communication security devices; precision 
navigation equipment; software, site sur-
veys; weapons system equipment and com-
puter software support; publications and 
technical documentation; common muni-
tions and test equipment; repair and return 
services and equipment; personnel training 
and training equipment; integration support 
and test equipment; and U.S. Government 
and contractor, engineering, technical and 
logistics support services; and other related 
elements of logistical and program support. 
The total estimated cost is $230 million. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy and national security of the United 
States by improving the security of a NATO 
ally. This sale is consistent with U.S. initia-
tives to provide key allies in the region with 
modern systems that will enhance interoper-
ability with U.S. forces and increase secu-
rity. 
This proposed sale improves Hungary’s de-
fense capability to deter regional threats and 
strengthen its homeland defense. The sale is 
in support of Hungary’s acquisition of the 
National Advanced Surface to Air Missile 
System (NASAMS) air defense system and 
would provide a full range of protection from 
imminent hostile cruise missiles, unmanned 
aerial vehicles, rotary wing and fixed wing 
threats. This sale will contribute to Hun-
gary’s 
interoperability 
with 
the 
United 
States and other allies. Hungary should not 
have any difficulties absorbing this equip-
ment into its armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support does not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The prime contractor and integrator will 
be Raytheon Missile Systems, Tucson, AZ. 
There are no known offset agreements pro-
posed in connection with this potential sale. 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
not require the assignment of additional U.S. 
Government and contractor representatives 
to Hungary. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. AIM–120 Advanced Medium Range Air- 
to-Air Missile Extended Range (AMRAAM- 
ER) is a medium range ground based air de-
fense missile capable in all-weather against 
multiple targets in a sophisticated elec-
tronic attack environment. AMRAAM-ER 
utilizes an active C–7 or C–8 seeker and war-
head joined with a new control section and 
rocket motor. This provides extended range 
and altitude, higher speed and maneuver-
ability, and has been extensively tested and 
proven. The AIM-l20C–8 is a form, fit, func-
tion refresh of the AIM–120C–7 and is the 
next generation to be produced. AIM–120 
Captive Air Training Missiles (CATM) are 
non-functioning, inert missile rounds used 
for armament load training, which simulate 
the correct size and weight of live missiles. 
2. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the specific 
hardware and software elements, the infor-
mation could be used to develop counter-
measures or equivalent systems which might 
reduce weapon system effectiveness or be 
used in the development of a system with 
similar or advanced capabilities. 
3. This sale is necessary in furtherance of 
the U.S. foreign policy and national security 
objectives outlined in the enclosed Policy 
Justification. A determination has been 
made that Hungary can provide the same de-
gree of protection for the sensitive tech-
nology being released as the U.S. Govern-
ment. 
4. All defense articles and services listed in 
this transmittal have been authorized for re-
lease and export to Hungary.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION 
United Arab Emirates (UAE)—Mine Resist-
ant Ambush Protected (MRAP) Vehicles 
The Government of the United Arab Emir-
ates has requested the sale of Excess Defense 
Articles (EDA) of up to four thousand five 
hundred sixty-nine (4,569) MRAP vehicles 
consisting of a mix of MaxxPro Long Wheel 
Base (L WB), MaxxPro Recovery Vehicle 
(MRV), MaxxPro L WB chassis, MaxxPro 
Dash, MaxxPro Bases Capsule, MaxxPro 
MEAP Capsules, MaxxPro Plus, Caiman 
Multi-Terrain 
Vehicles 
without 
armor, 
Caiman Base, Caiman Plus, Caiman Capsule, 
and MRAP All-Terrain Vehicles (MATV), lo-
gistics support services, and other related 
elements of logistical and program support. 
The estimated total program cost is $556 mil-
lion. 
The proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy and national security objectives of 
the United States by helping to improve the 
security of an important regional partner. 
The UAE has been, and continues to be, a 
vital U.S. partner for political stability and 
economic progress in the Middle East. This 
sale is consistent with U.S. initiatives to 
provide key allies in the region with modern 
systems that will enhance interoperability 
with U.S. forces and increase security. 
The UAE intends to utilize the MRAP ve-
hicles to increase force protection, to con-
duct humanitarian assistance operations, 
and to protect critical infrastructure. Addi-
tionally, these MRAPs will enhance the 
UAE’s burden sharing capacity and defensive 
capabilities. The UAE will have no difficulty 
absorbing this equipment and support into 
its armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not affect the basic military 
balance in the region. 
These vehicles will be coming from U.S. 
Army stocks as EDA; the required EDA Con-
gressional Notifications were made August 6, 
2014. There are no known offset agreements 
proposed in conjunction with this proposed 
sale. 
Implementation of this sale will not re-
quire the assignment of U.S. Government or 
contractor representatives to the UAE. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The Mine Resistant Ambush Protected 
(MRAP) vehicle is an armored, multipurpose 
combat vehicle intended to support mounted 
urban operations to include convoy security 
support and dismounted patrols. It is de-
signed to increase crew survivability. The 
vehicle has a blast-resistant underbody de-
signed to protect the crew from mine blasts, 
fragmentation, and direct fire weapons. 
2. All MRAP vehicle information needed to 
operate, train, and maintain the vehicles are 
UNCLASSIFIED. Some design and test data, 
design performance parameters, armoring 
methodology, vulnerabilities, armor types, 
and configuration can be classified up to SE-
CRET. 
3. Loss of this hardware, software, docu-
mentation, and/or data could permit develop-
ment of information which may lead to a sig-
nificant threat to future U.S. military oper-
ations. If a technologically advanced adver-
sary were to obtain knowledge of the specific 
hardware and software elements, the infor-
mation could be used to develop counter-
measures or equivalent systems which might 
reduce weapon system effectiveness or be 
used in the development of a system with 
similar or advanced capabilities. 
4. A determination has been made that the 
UAE can provide substantially the same de-
gree of protection for this technology as the 
U.S. Government. This proposed sale is nec-
essary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign pol-
icy and national security objectives outlined 
in the Policy Justification. 
5. All of the defense articles and services 
listed in this transmittal have been author-
ized for release and export to the UAE. 
ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING SCOTT MCCORMICK 
∑ Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor the life of Crossett, AR, 
Mayor 
Scott 
McCormick. 
Mayor 
McCormick passed away on April 16, 
2020. 
Mayor McCormick spent his life serv-
ing his community. He was a proud 
member of the Crossett Police Depart-
ment who joined the force in 1978. In 
the two decades that followed, he hon-
orably performed numerous roles in-
cluding working as a criminal investi-
gator. He earned the rank of captain 
before he left the department in 1998 
after 20 years of protecting the citizens 
of Crossett. 
Mayor McCormick was dedicated to 
his community and continued working 
for the people. Shortly after hanging 
up his badge, he was elected mayor of 
Crossett, and the public went on to 
place its trust in his leadership five ad-
ditional times. 
He was certainly beloved. The citi-
zens of Crossett appreciated his com-
mitment and hands-on approach which 
he demonstrated by attending numer-
ous events throughout the years, being 
available to citizens and revealing a 
willingness to listen. 
His leadership was also valuable to 
organizations across the State. He was 
a member of the Arkansas Municipal 
League’s Executive Council, First Class 
Cities Advisory Council, and the Public 
Safety Advisory Council, in addition to 
other groups. 
He inspired the people of Crossett to 
work together in support of the com-
munity and encouraged respect for all 
citizens. 
I am grateful for Mayor McCormick’s 
decades of public service and for the 
way he devoted his life to his faith, 
family, and community. I pray God 
will bless the McCormick family and 
the people of Crossett as they cope 
with this loss and celebrate the life of 
Mayor Scott McCormick.∑

50TH ANNIVERSARY OF HOT 
SPRINGS VILLAGE 
∑ Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize the 50th anniversary 
of Hot Springs Village, AR. 
On April 20, 1970, developer John Coo-
per founded Hot Springs Village as a 
premier retirement destination. In the 
decades since residents first moved in, 
it has grown into one of the largest pri-
vate gated communities in the coun-
try. 
To recognize this milestone, the com-
munity organized a year-long celebra-
tion spearheaded by the 50th Anniver-
sary Planning Committee. Committee

members began laying the groundwork 
for the activities months ago, engaging 
with the chamber of commerce as well 
as local businesses, churches, and civic 
clubs to make this a year to remember. 
The enthusiasm from community 
members is demonstrated by the spe-
cial logo created to commemorate this 
occasion 
that 
features 
the 
phrase 
‘‘Proud Past and Strong Future.’’ 
Hot Springs Village continues to wel-
come new residents including young 
professionals. Numerous outdoor op-
portunities which include nature trails, 
tennis courts and golf courses provide 
avenues to maintain a healthy life-
style, build camaraderie among folks 
who enjoy the same activities and the 
opportunity to learn new skills. 
The men and women who call Hot 
Springs Village home have a lot to be 
grateful for. They have helped shape 
the city and made it an attractive des-
tination for events and for future resi-
dents. 
Congratulations to the 50th Anniver-
sary Planning Committee members for 
their hard work and preparation. I am 
excited for the community as it comes 
together to recognize and commemo-
rate this historic milestone and wish 
all the very best as celebrations take 
place throughout the year.∑

IOWA SAFE SCHOOLS 
∑ Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, I would 
like to recognize Iowa Safe Schools as 
they hold their 15th annual Iowa Gov-
ernor’s Conference on LGBTQ Youth 
today, May 11, 2020. 
This annual tradition, which began 
in 2006, is an effort to help end bullying 
in our schools and to create leadership 
opportunities for LGBTQ youth stu-
dents from not just Iowa but from

Thank you to Iowa Safe Schools for

ment and as members of the uniformed serv-
ices; 
Whereas millions of individuals work in 
government service and as members of the 
uniformed services, in every State, county,

dreds of cities abroad; 
Whereas public service is a noble calling 
involving a variety of challenging and re-
warding professions; 
Whereas the ability of the Federal Govern-
ment and State and local governments to be 
responsive, innovative, and effective depends 
on the outstanding performance of dedicated 
public servants; 
Whereas the United States has recently re-

greatness and prosperity;

the Earth, the Moon, and space to help im-

(14) improve and secure transportation sys-
tems; and 
(15) assist veterans of the Armed Forces; 
Whereas members of the uniformed serv-

general welfare of the United States; and 
(2) are on the front lines in the fight to de-
feat terrorism and other threats to the secu-
rity of the United States, and maintain 
homeland security; 
Whereas public servants work in a profes-
sional manner to build relationships with 
other countries and cultures in order to bet-
ter represent the interests and promote the 
ideals of the United States; 
Whereas public servants alert Congress and 
the public to government waste, fraud, and 
abuse, and dangers to public health; 
Whereas the individuals serving in the uni-
formed services, as well as the skilled trade 
and craft employees of the Federal Govern-
ment who provide support to their efforts— 
(1) are committed to doing their jobs re-
gardless of the circumstances; and 
(2) contribute greatly to the security of the 
United States and the world; 
Whereas public servants have bravely 
fought in armed conflicts in the defense of 
the United States and its ideals and deserve 
the care and benefits they have earned 
through their honorable service; 
Whereas public servants— 
(1) have much to offer, as demonstrated by 
their expertise and innovative ideas; and 
(2) serve as examples by passing on institu-
tional knowledge to train the next genera-
tion of public servants; and 
Whereas the week of May 3 through May 9, 
2020, marks the 36th anniversary of Public 
Service Recognition Week: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the designation of the week of 
May 3 through May 9, 2020, as ‘‘Public Serv-
ice Recognition Week’’; 
(2) commends public servants for their out-

and 
(7) supports efforts to promote an efficient 
and effective public service that serves the 
people of the United States. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, in honor 
of Public Service Recognition Week, I 
rise to express my gratitude and appre-
ciation for the millions of men and 
women who serve as Federal, State, 
county, and local government employ-
ees across the United States of Amer-
ica. Since 1985, Public Service Recogni-
tion Week has brought communities 
together to give tribute to our Nation’s 
public servants on the first week of 
May. I am proud to be a co-sponsor of 
the annual Senate resolution marking 
this occasion each year, and I thank 
Senators SINEMA
and LANKFORD
for 
their leadership in introducing this 
year’s edition, which the Senate will 
pass momentarily. 
We must never take for granted that 
public servants are committed to serv-
ing the public. In a time of unprece-
dented crisis, with millions working 
from home and the real risk of falling 
victim to disease by going into the 
workplace, public servants work for us. 
In more ordinary times, with people 
less concerned but still dependent on 
essential public goods such as clean 
water, schools, and a safe community, 
public servants work for us. The 
COVID–19 pandemic only makes more 
apparent what has always been true: 
we owe so much, from the daily oper-
ations of our society to the rapid relief 
to emergencies, to the men and women 
who form our public service. 
Now more than ever, public servants 
are working on the front lines, often 
times potentially putting themselves 
at risk, to continue those daily oper-
ations of our society and provide crit-
ical rapid relief to this immense na-
tional crisis. At the Federal level, they 
have dutifully taken on the respon-
sibilities charged upon them by Con-
gress through the CARES Act. Thou-
sands of workers at the Department of 
Treasury and Small Business Adminis-
tration, making due with insufficient 
staff and resources, are playing an in-
strumental role in responding to the 
economic downturn by distributing bil-
lions of dollars in stimulus payments 
to individuals and loans to small busi-
nesses. At the state level, workers of 
State unemployment insurance agen-
cies now face truly historic demands of 
their abilities as the unemployment 
rate approaches levels not seen since 
the end of the Second World War. De-
spite the stress, despite the technical 
challenges, and indeed despite the sys-
tem infrastructure that makes it ex-
ceedingly difficult for applicants to re-
ceive benefits in the first place, these 
workers are doing everything they can 
to make the system work for people. 
And at the county and local levels, 
public servants are striving to ensure 
compliance with special quarantine or-
ders and offering testing and other 
emergency services. 
The United States will undoubtedly 
overcome this pandemic. But we must 
recognize that it would not happen 
without our public servants. We have 
the example of Nancy Sullivan, resi-
dent of Bethesda, Maryland and an em-
ployee at the National Institutes of 
Health, honored this year as a finalist 
for the Samuel J. Heyman Service to 
America Medals for developing a high-
ly effective medical treatment for the 
deadly Ebola virus that ravaged Africa 
between 2014 and 2016. I have no doubt 
that we today enjoy the service of 
brave public servants who will con-
tribute similarly in finding a break-
through for COVID–19. Or for that mat-
ter, the innumerable public servants 
across our Nation, across countless 
fields and areas of expertise, from sen-
ior executives to call center workers, 
each in their own way working for the 
public interest of America. 
Public Service Recognition Week 
therefore bears a special significance in 
2020. It is my hope that amidst the pan-
demic, we are able to reflect on the ab-
solutely essential role our public serv-
ants play, and that this does not go for-
gotten once we emerge from this crisis. 
The men and women who make up our 
public service are fighting for us every 
day, just as they were before the crisis, 
and just as they will be afterward. Ei-
ther we can take their work for grant-
ed or, perhaps, we can remember to 
fight for them, too.

strategy to regain observer status for Tai-
wan in the World Health Organization, and 
for other purposes. 
f 
TEXT OF AMENDMENTS 
SA 1582. Mr. MCCONNELL (for Mr. 
INHOFE) proposed an amendment to the 
bill S. 249, to direct the Secretary of 
State to develop a strategy to regain 
observer status for Taiwan in the 
World Health Organization, and for 
other purposes; as follows: 
Strike all after the enacting clause and in-
sert the following: 
SECTION 1. PARTICIPATION OF TAIWAN IN THE 
WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) The World Health Organization (WHO) 
is a specialized agency of the United Nations, 
charged with coordinating health efforts 
within the United Nations system. The 
World Health Assembly (WHA) is the deci-
sion-making body of the WHO, which con-
venes annually in May to set the policies and 
priorities of the organization. Statehood is 
not a requirement for attendance at the 
WHA, and numerous observers, including 
non-members and non-governmental organi-
zations, attended the most recent WHA in 
May 2018. 
(2) Taiwan began seeking to participate in 
the WHO as an observer in 1997. In 2009, with 
strong support from successive United States 
Administrations, Congress, and like-minded 
WHO Member States, and during a period of 
improved Cross-Strait relations, Taiwan re-
ceived an invitation to attend the WHA as an 
observer under the name ‘‘Chinese Taipei’’. 
Taiwan received the same invitation each 
year until 2016, when following the election 
of President Tsai-Ing Wen of the Democratic 
Progressive Party, Taiwan’s engagement in 
the international community began facing 
increased resistance from the People’s Re-
public of China (PRC). Taiwan’s invitation to 
the 2016 WHA was received late and included 
new language conditioning Taiwan’s partici-
pation on the PRC’s ‘‘one China principle’’. 
In 2017 and 2018, Taiwan did not receive an 
invitation to the WHA. 
(3) Taiwan remains a model contributor to 
world health, having provided financial and 
technical assistance to respond to numerous 
global health challenges. Taiwan has in-
vested over $6,000,000,000 in international 
medical and humanitarian aid efforts im-
pacting over 80 countries since 1996. In 2014, 
Taiwan responded to the Ebola crisis by do-
nating $1,000,000 and providing 100,000 sets of 
personal protective equipment. Through the 
Global Cooperation and Training Frame-
work, the United States and Taiwan have 
jointly conducted training programs for ex-
perts to combat MERS, Dengue Fever, and 
Zika. These diseases know no borders, and 
Taiwan’s needless exclusion from global 
health cooperation increases the dangers 
presented by global pandemics. 
(4) Taiwan’s international engagement has 
faced increased resistance from the PRC. 
Taiwan was not invited to the 2016 Assembly 
of the International Civil Aviation Organiza-
tion (ICAO), despite participating as a guest 
at the organization’s prior summit in 2013. 
Taiwan’s requests to participate in the Gen-
eral Assembly of the International Criminal 
Police Organization (INTERPOL) have also 
been rejected. In May 2017, PRC delegates 
disrupted a meeting of the Kimberley Proc-
ess on conflict diamonds held in Perth, Aus-
tralia, until delegates from Taiwan were 
asked to leave. Since 2016, the Democratic 
Republic of Sa˜o Tome´ and Prı´ncipe, the Re-
public of Panama, the Solomon Islands, the 
Republic of Kiribati, the Dominican Repub-
lic, Burkina Faso, and the Republic of El 
Salvador have terminated longstanding dip-
lomatic 
relationships 
with 
Taiwan 
and 
granted diplomatic recognition to the PRC. 
(5) Congress has established a policy of 
support for Taiwan’s participation in inter-
national 
bodies 
that 
address 
shared 
transnational challenges, particularly in the 
WHO. Congress passed H.R. 1794 in the 106th 
Congress, H.R. 428 in the 107th Congress, and 
S. 2092 in the 108th Congress to direct the 
Secretary of State to establish a strategy 
for, and to report annually to Congress on, 
efforts to obtain observer status for Taiwan 
at the WHA. Congress also passed H.R. 1151 
in the 113th Congress, directing the Sec-
retary to report on a strategy to gain ob-
server status for Taiwan at the ICAO Assem-
bly, and H.R. 1853 in the 114th Congress, di-
recting the Secretary to report on a strategy 
to gain observer status for Taiwan at the 
INTERPOL Assembly. However, since 2016 
Taiwan has not received an invitation to at-
tend any of these events as an observer. 
(b) AUGMENTATION OF REPORT CONCERNING 
THE PARTICIPATION OF TAIWAN IN THE WORLD 
HEALTH ORGANIZATION.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Subsection (c) of section 1 
of Public Law 108–235 (118 Stat. 656) is amend-
ed by adding at the end the following new 
paragraph: 
‘‘(3) An account of the changes and im-
provements the Secretary of State has made 
to the United States plan to endorse and ob-
tain observer status for Taiwan at the World 
Health Assembly, following any annual 
meetings of the World Health Assembly at 
which Taiwan did not obtain observer sta-
tus.’’. 
(2) 
EFFECTIVE
DATE.—The 
amendment 
made by paragraph (1) shall take effect and 
apply beginning with the first report re-
quired under subsection (c) of section 1 of 
Public Law 108–235 that is submitted after 
the date of the enactment of this Act. 
SEC. 2. BRIEFING ON UNITED STATES STRATEGY 
REGARDING 
TAIWAN’S 
INTER-
NATIONAL RECOGNITION. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 90 days 
after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
and every 180 days thereafter for three years, 
the Secretary of State, or the Secretary’s 
designee, shall provide to the appropriate 
congressional committees a briefing on ac-
tions taken by the United States to reaffirm 
and strengthen Taiwan’s official and unoffi-
cial diplomatic relationships. 
(b) ELEMENTS.—The briefing required by 
subsection (a) shall include the following ele-
ments: 
(1) A description of the actions taken by 
the United States commencing May 20, 2016, 
to consult with governments around the 
world, including the governments that main-
tain official diplomatic relations with Tai-
wan, with the purpose of inducing those gov-
ernments to maintain official diplomatic re-
lations with Taiwan or otherwise strengthen 
unofficial relations with Taiwan. 
(2) An enumeration of specific countries of 
concern, if any, and a description of the ac-
tions taken, or actions anticipated, by those 
governments, commencing May 20, 2016, to 
alter the formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan 
or to otherwise downgrade official or unoffi-
cial relations. 
(3) A plan of action to engage with the gov-
ernments of the countries identified in para-
graphs (1) and (2) and increase cooperation 
with respect to Taiwan. 
(c) APPROPRIATE CONGRESSIONAL COMMIT-
TEES.—In this section, the term ‘‘appropriate 
congressional committees’’ means— 
(1) the Committee on Foreign Relations of 
the Senate; and 
(2) the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the 
House of Representatives. 
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE IMPLEMEN-
TATION OF THE ASIA REASSURANCE 
INITIATIVE ACT. 
It is the sense of Congress that the full and 
timely implementation of section 209 of the 
Asia Reassurance Initiative Act (Public Law 
115–409), which reiterates longstanding bipar-
tisan United States policy, is critical to 
demonstrate United States support for Tai-
wan. 
f 
DIRECTING THE SECRETARY 
OF 
STATE TO DEVELOP A STRAT-
EGY TO REGAIN OBSERVER STA-
TUS FOR TAIWAN IN THE WORLD 
HEALTH ORGANIZATION 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent the Senate pro-
ceed to the immediate consideration of 
Calendar No. 100, S. 249. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the bill by title. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
A bill (S. 249) to direct the Secretary of 
State to develop a strategy to regain ob-
server status for Taiwan in the World Health 
Organization, and for other purposes. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill, which 
had been reported from the Committee 
on Foreign Relations with an amend-
ment to strike all after the enacting 
clause and insert in lieu thereof the 
following: 
SECTION 1. PARTICIPATION OF TAIWAN IN THE 
WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following 
findings: 
(1) The World Health Organization (WHO) is 
a specialized agency of the United Nations, 
charged with coordinating health efforts within 
the United Nations system. The World Health 
Assembly (WHA) is the decision-making body of 
the WHO, which convenes annually in May to 
set the policies and priorities of the organiza-
tion. Statehood is not a requirement for attend-
ance at the WHA, and numerous observers, in-
cluding non-members and non-governmental or-
ganizations, attended the most recent WHA in 
May 2018. 
(2) Taiwan began seeking to participate in the 
WHO as an observer in 1997. In 2009, with 
strong support from successive United States 
Administrations, 
Congress, 
and 
like-minded 
WHO Member States, and during a period of im-
proved Cross-Strait relations, Taiwan received 
an invitation to attend the WHA as an observer 
under the name ‘‘Chinese Taipei’’. Taiwan re-
ceived the same invitation each year until 2016, 
when following the election of President Tsai- 
Ing Wen of the Democratic Progressive Party, 
Taiwan’s engagement in the international com-
munity began facing increased resistance from 
the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Taiwan’s 
invitation to the 2016 WHA was received late 
and included new language conditioning Tai-
wan’s participation on the PRC’s ‘‘one China 
principle’’. In 2017 and 2018, Taiwan did not re-
ceive an invitation to the WHA. 
(3) Taiwan remains a model contributor to 
world health, having provided financial and 
technical assistance to respond to numerous 
global health challenges. Taiwan has invested 
over $6,000,000,000 in international medical and 
humanitarian aid efforts impacting over 80 
countries since 1996. In 2014, Taiwan responded 
to the Ebola crisis by donating $1,000,000 and 
providing 100,000 sets of personal protective 
equipment. Through the Global Cooperation and 
Training Framework, the United States and 
Taiwan have jointly conducted training pro-
grams for experts to combat MERS, Dengue 
Fever, and Zika. These diseases know no bor-
ders, and Taiwan’s needless exclusion from

global health cooperation increases the dangers 
presented by global pandemics. 
(4) Taiwan’s international engagement has 
faced increased resistance from the PRC. Tai-
wan was not invited to the 2016 Assembly of the 
International 
Civil 
Aviation 
Organization 
(ICAO), despite participating as a guest at the 
organization’s prior summit in 2013. Taiwan’s 
requests to participate in the General Assembly 
of the International Criminal Police Organiza-
tion (INTERPOL) have also been rejected. In 
May 2017, PRC delegates disrupted a meeting of 
the Kimberley Process on conflict diamonds held 
in Perth, Australia, until delegates from Taiwan 
were asked to leave. Since 2016, the Democratic 
Republic of Sa˜o Tome´ and Prı´ncipe, the Repub-
lic 
of 
Panama, 
the 
Dominican 
Republic, 
Burkina Faso, and the Republic of El Salvador 
have terminated longstanding diplomatic rela-
tionships with Taiwan and granted diplomatic 
recognition to the PRC. 
(5) Congress has established a policy of sup-
port for Taiwan’s participation in international 
bodies that address shared transnational chal-
lenges, particularly in the WHO. Congress 
passed H.R. 1794 in the 106th Congress, H.R. 428 
in the 107th Congress, and S. 2092 in the 108th 
Congress to direct the Secretary of State to es-
tablish a strategy for, and to report annually to 
Congress on, efforts to obtain observer status for 
Taiwan at the WHA. Congress also passed H.R. 
1151 in the 113th Congress, directing the Sec-
retary to report on a strategy to gain observer 
status for Taiwan at the ICAO Assembly, and 
H.R. 1853 in the 114th Congress, directing the 
Secretary to report on a strategy to gain ob-
server status for Taiwan at the INTERPOL As-
sembly. However, since 2016 Taiwan has not re-
ceived an invitation to attend any of these 
events as an observer. 
(b) AUGMENTATION
OF REPORT CONCERNING 
THE PARTICIPATION OF TAIWAN IN THE WORLD 
HEALTH ORGANIZATION.—

ments the Secretary of State has made to the 
United States plan to endorse and obtain ob-
server status for Taiwan at the World Health 
Assembly, following any annual meetings of the 
World Health Assembly at which Taiwan did 
not obtain observer status.’’. 
(2) EFFECTIVE
DATE.—The amendment made 
by paragraph (1) shall take effect and apply be-
ginning with the first report required under sub-
section (c) of section 1 of Public Law 108–235 
that is submitted after the date of the enactment 
of this Act. 
SEC. 2. BRIEFING ON UNITED STATES STRATEGY 
REGARDING 
TAIWAN’S 
INTER-
NATIONAL RECOGNITION. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 90 days after 
the date of the enactment of this Act, and every 
180 days thereafter for three years, the Sec-
retary of State shall provide to the appropriate 
congressional committees a briefing on actions 
taken by the United States to reaffirm and 
strengthen Taiwan’s official and unofficial dip-
lomatic relationships. 
(b) ELEMENTS.—The briefing required by sub-
section (a) shall include the following elements: 
(1) A description of the actions taken by the 
United States commencing May 20, 2016, to con-
sult with governments around the world, includ-
ing the governments that maintain official dip-
lomatic relations with Taiwan, with the purpose 
of inducing those governments to maintain offi-
cial diplomatic relations with Taiwan or other-
wise strengthen unofficial relations with Tai-
wan. 
(2) An enumeration of specific countries of 
concern, if any, and a description of the actions 
taken, or actions anticipated, by those govern-
ments, commencing May 20, 2016, to alter the 
formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan or to other-
wise downgrade official or unofficial relations. 
(3) A plan of action to engage with the gov-
ernments of the countries identified in para-
graphs (1) and (2) and increase cooperation 
with respect to Taiwan. 
(c) APPROPRIATE
CONGRESSIONAL
COMMIT-
TEES.—In this section, the term ‘‘appropriate 
congressional committees’’ means— 
(1) the Committee on Foreign Relations of the 
Senate; and 
(2) the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the 
House of Representatives. 
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE IMPLEMEN-
TATION OF THE ASIA REASSURANCE 
INITIATIVE ACT. 
It is the sense of Congress that the full and 
timely implementation of section 209 of the Asia 
Reassurance Initiative Act (Public Law 115– 
409), which reiterates longstanding bipartisan 
United States policy, is critical to demonstrate 
United States support for Taiwan. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I ask unanimous 
consent that the committee-reported 
substitute amendment be withdrawn; 
that the Inhofe substitute amendment 
at the desk be considered and agreed 
to; that the bill, as amended, be consid-
ered read a third time and passed; and 
that the motion to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The committee-reported amendment, 
in the nature of a substitute, was with-
drawn. 
The amendment (No. 1582) was agreed 
to, as follows: 
[Purpose: In the nature of a substitute] 
Strike all after the enacting clause and in-
sert the following: 
SECTION 1. PARTICIPATION OF TAIWAN IN THE 
WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) The World Health Organization (WHO) 
is a specialized agency of the United Nations, 
charged with coordinating health efforts 
within the United Nations system. The 
World Health Assembly (WHA) is the deci-
sion-making body of the WHO, which con-
venes annually in May to set the policies and 
priorities of the organization. Statehood is 
not a requirement for attendance at the 
WHA, and numerous observers, including 
non-members and non-governmental organi-
zations, attended the most recent WHA in 
May 2018. 
(2) Taiwan began seeking to participate in 
the WHO as an observer in 1997. In 2009, with 
strong support from successive United States 
Administrations, Congress, and like-minded 
WHO Member States, and during a period of 
improved Cross-Strait relations, Taiwan re-
ceived an invitation to attend the WHA as an 
observer under the name ‘‘Chinese Taipei’’. 
Taiwan received the same invitation each 
year until 2016, when following the election 
of President Tsai-Ing Wen of the Democratic 
Progressive Party, Taiwan’s engagement in 
the international community began facing 
increased resistance from the People’s Re-
public of China (PRC). Taiwan’s invitation to 
the 2016 WHA was received late and included 
new language conditioning Taiwan’s partici-
pation on the PRC’s ‘‘one China principle’’. 
In 2017 and 2018, Taiwan did not receive an 
invitation to the WHA. 
(3) Taiwan remains a model contributor to 
world health, having provided financial and 
technical assistance to respond to numerous 
global health challenges. Taiwan has in-
vested over $6,000,000,000 in international 
medical and humanitarian aid efforts im-
pacting over 80 countries since 1996. In 2014, 
Taiwan responded to the Ebola crisis by do-
nating $1,000,000 and providing 100,000 sets of 
personal protective equipment. Through the 
Global Cooperation and Training Frame-
work, the United States and Taiwan have 
jointly conducted training programs for ex-
perts to combat MERS, Dengue Fever, and 
Zika. These diseases know no borders, and 
Taiwan’s needless exclusion from global 
health cooperation increases the dangers 
presented by global pandemics. 
(4) Taiwan’s international engagement has 
faced increased resistance from the PRC. 
Taiwan was not invited to the 2016 Assembly 
of the International Civil Aviation Organiza-
tion (ICAO), despite participating as a guest 
at the organization’s prior summit in 2013. 
Taiwan’s requests to participate in the Gen-
eral Assembly of the International Criminal 
Police Organization (INTERPOL) have also 
been rejected. In May 2017, PRC delegates 
disrupted a meeting of the Kimberley Proc-
ess on conflict diamonds held in Perth, Aus-
tralia, until delegates from Taiwan were 
asked to leave. Since 2016, the Democratic 
Republic of Sa˜o Tome´ and Prı´ncipe, the Re-
public of Panama, the Solomon Islands, the 
Republic of Kiribati, the Dominican Repub-
lic, Burkina Faso, and the Republic of El 
Salvador have terminated longstanding dip-
lomatic 
relationships 
with 
Taiwan 
and 
granted diplomatic recognition to the PRC. 
(5) Congress has established a policy of 
support for Taiwan’s participation in inter-
national 
bodies 
that 
address 
shared 
transnational challenges, particularly in the 
WHO. Congress passed H.R. 1794 in the 106th 
Congress, H.R. 428 in the 107th Congress, and 
S. 2092 in the 108th Congress to direct the 
Secretary of State to establish a strategy 
for, and to report annually to Congress on, 
efforts to obtain observer status for Taiwan 
at the WHA. Congress also passed H.R. 1151 
in the 113th Congress, directing the Sec-
retary to report on a strategy to gain ob-
server status for Taiwan at the ICAO Assem-
bly, and H.R. 1853 in the 114th Congress, di-
recting the Secretary to report on a strategy 
to gain observer status for Taiwan at the 
INTERPOL Assembly. However, since 2016 
Taiwan has not received an invitation to at-
tend any of these events as an observer. 
(b) AUGMENTATION OF REPORT CONCERNING 
THE PARTICIPATION OF TAIWAN IN THE WORLD 
HEALTH ORGANIZATION.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Subsection (c) of section 1 
of Public Law 108–235 (118 Stat. 656) is amend-
ed by adding at the end the following new 
paragraph: 
‘‘(3) An account of the changes and im-
provements the Secretary of State has made 
to the United States plan to endorse and ob-
tain observer status for Taiwan at the World 
Health Assembly, following any annual 
meetings of the World Health Assembly at 
which Taiwan did not obtain observer sta-
tus.’’. 
(2) 
EFFECTIVE
DATE.—The 
amendment 
made by paragraph (1) shall take effect and 
apply beginning with the first report re-
quired under subsection (c) of section 1 of 
Public Law 108–235 that is submitted after 
the date of the enactment of this Act.

REGARDING

(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 90 days 
after the date of the enactment of this Act,

the Secretary of State, or the Secretary’s 
designee, shall provide to the appropriate 
congressional committees a briefing on ac-
tions taken by the United States to reaffirm 
and strengthen Taiwan’s official and unoffi-
cial diplomatic relationships. 
(b) ELEMENTS.—The briefing required by
