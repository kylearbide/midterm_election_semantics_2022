ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair will entertain up to 15 requests 
for 1-minute speeches on each side of 
the aisle. 
f 
BUILDING BACK BETTER NOW AND 
FOR THE FUTURE 
(Ms. GARCIA of Texas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to discuss the jobs created 
by the Infrastructure Investment and 
Jobs Act. 
By passing this historic piece of leg-
islation, we have set in motion adding 
two million jobs a year for the Amer-
ican people. High-paying, stable jobs 
filled 
by 
skilled, 
union, 
American 
workers. 
These are the jobs that hold families 
together. They put everyday people in 
control of their future for themselves 
and for their children. 
We are building the roads, bridges, 
high-speed internet, ports, and airports 
we need. We are strengthening our frail 
electric grid. 
We are building back better now and 
for the next generation to come, for all 
our children. 
f 
SKYROCKETING ENERGY PRICES 
(Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to address the cri-
sis that is causing energy prices to 
skyrocket and hurting Pennsylvanians. 
This year it is estimated that Ameri-
cans will pay 32 percent more to heat 
their homes than they did last year. 
This sudden spike in prices is the re-
sult of President Biden’s war on afford-
able energy sources, sources like oil, 
natural gas, coal, and the Marcellus 
shale that is so readily available in 
Pennsylvania. 
Instead of promoting these affordable 
baseload power sources, the Biden ad-
ministration has doubled down on their 
failed policies. So far, President Biden 
has canceled projects, including the 
Keystone XL pipeline. He has refused 
to sign new drilling leases that would 
ultimately lower the cost of energy for 
my constituents. 
President Biden and his far-left ad-
ministration 
are 
fighting 
against 
American 
businesses 
and 
against 
American families. 
The dead of winter is not the time to 
implement the Green New Deal. The 
coldest months of the year are no time 
to raise heating costs. These reckless 
policies must end. 
f 
CLIMATE CHANGE SOLUTIONS 
(Ms. UNDERWOOD asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, cli-
mate change presents an existential

threat to our environment, our econ-
omy, and our future. That is one of the 
reasons I was so proud to support the 
bipartisan infrastructure law, a genera-
tional investment in clean energy jobs 
and technology, like solar. 
This investment is critical for the 
communities I represent, which are al-
ready working to advance clean energy 
technologies at home in Illinois. Just 
last week Mundelein, Illinois, was 
awarded the Department of Energy’s 
SolSmart Silver award for making it 
faster, easier, and more affordable for 
communities to utilize solar energy. 
We owe it to our families, commu-
nities, and future generations to create 
climate change solutions. Thanks to 
the bipartisan infrastructure law, that 
is exactly what we are doing. 
f 
CONGRATULATING PRESIDENT 
AMIRIDIS 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the University of 
South Carolina Board of Trustees se-
lecting Dr. Michael Amiridis as the 
new university president. As estab-
lished by Dr. Harris Pastides, he con-
tinues the importance of Greek herit-
age so meaningful for the people of 
South Carolina. 
Having previously spent over 20 years 
on the USC campus, President Amiridis 
returns from the University of Illinois 
at Chicago, where he has been chan-
cellor. As President Amiridis is already 
familiar with the university commu-
nity, I am confident that the school, 
branch campuses, and students will 
benefit from his appreciation of the ex-
traordinary Gamecock traditions. 
Shortly after being selected, Presi-
dent Amiridis said, ‘‘Through aca-
demics, research, and its vibrant cul-
ture, the university system is criti-
cally important to the people of South 
Carolina and to the State’s future. I 
feel privileged to be able to lead this 
great institution.’’ 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
who successfully protected America for 
20 years, as the global war on terrorism 
continues, moving from the safe haven 
in Afghanistan to America. 
f 
REMEMBERING MIKE DUFFY 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize the life of a 
well-known and generous man from 
Davenport, Iowa. Mike Duffy passed 
away peacefully on January 21 sur-
rounded by his loved ones. 
For the overwhelming majority of his 
life, Mike called Davenport home. He 
began working at the age of 11 and did 
not stop until his retirement. He 
helped his father, John, grow the fam-
ily business, Per Mar Security, into an 
Iowa institution. 
Mike 
worked 
a 
number 
of 
jobs 
throughout his life, and he always 
treated everyone from all walks of life 
with equal respect. That is just who 
Mike was, and he has made the lives of 
everyone around him better because of 
it. 
Mike’s long list of accomplishments 
include being recognized by the Iowa 
Business Hall of Fame, the Quad Cities 
Area 
Junior 
Achievement 
Hall 
of 
Fame, and the Security Industry Hall 
of Fame. Mike served the Quad Cities 
around the clock, serving on multiple 
boards and committees, including the 
Davenport Chamber of Commerce, St. 
Ambrose University, and the Handi-
capped Development Center, just to 
name a few. 
Even at his visitation, his employees 
told his wife, Linda, about his selfless 
service in delivering the Sunday paper 
to them for the coupons, even though 
he read it online. Mike worked his en-
tire life to support his family, his 
friends, and his community. 
Mike’s wife, Linda; their children; 
and 31 grandchildren are in my prayers. 
f 
CONGRATULATING DOUG 
WEATHERS 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to honor the accom-
plishments of Doug Weathers, the long- 
time WTOC Savannah broadcaster who 
was recently inducted into the Georgia 
Association of Broadcasters Hall of 
Fame. 
Doug has been a titan of Georgia 
broadcasting since 1962, when he first 
began presenting the news. 
Starting in 1954 as a film editor, 
Doug worked his way through running 
the projector, operating studio cam-
eras, and helping with production until 
he was tapped to host. When it comes 
to news, Doug truly is a jack-of-all- 
trades. 
Doug helped WTOC news reach the 
top of their local ratings and remain 
there during his tenure. In 1973, Doug 
left WTOC for WJCL because they had 
the ability to broadcast in color, and 
he helped springboard them to number 
one in the local ratings. 
When Doug eventually returned to 
WTOC, he helped bring their evening 
news back to number one, where it re-
mained until his retirement in 2001. 
Having worked in every aspect of a 
television studio, Doug has helped 
modernize and popularize local news 
throughout our State. We are very 
grateful for his years of service and 
congratulate him on this historic ac-
complishment. 
Congratulations to my friend and my 
neighbor.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, the Chair 
will

further

today on motions to suspend the rules

dered. 
The House will resume proceedings 
on postponed questions at a later time.

ignate the facility of the United States 
Postal Service located at 3900 Crown 
Road Southwest in Atlanta, Georgia, 
as the ‘John R. Lewis Post Office

resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled,

of H.R. 5577 to designate the facility of 
the United States Postal Service lo-
cated at 3900 Crown Road Southwest in

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H313 
February 1, 2022 
As a college student in Nashville, 
Congressman Lewis was a founder and 
chairman of the national civil rights 
organization, Student Nonviolent Co-
ordinating Committee, or SNCC. 
In 1963, John Lewis was involved in 
planning the March on Washington for 
Jobs and Freedom. As a part of the 
event, Lewis delivered a keynote ad-
dress at the Lincoln Memorial in which 
he called on an army of movement ac-
tivists to ‘‘march through the South’’ 
in a sustained campaign of nonviolent 
resistance to produce effective civil 
rights legislation and destroy Jim 
Crow. 
His fight for Federal civil rights leg-
islation continued in 1965, as Congress-
man Lewis participated in new voter 
registration drives and peaceful dem-
onstrations in Selma, Alabama, where 
he sustained a fractured skull as a re-
sult of being beaten during what is now 
known as Bloody Sunday. 
President Jimmy Carter appointed 
Lewis as the associate director of the 
Federal volunteer agency, ACTION, 
where he worked to build connections 
to local volunteer groups and diversify 
the agency’s workforce. 
From 
1981 
to 
1986, 
Congressman 
Lewis held a seat on the Atlanta City 
Council, where he tackled local issues, 
such as public funding for infrastruc-
ture, zoning laws, and homelessness. 
As 
a 
Representative 
of 
Georgia, 
Lewis made monumental strides as he 
focused on backing or introducing leg-
islation advancing civil rights, envi-
ronmental 
justice, 
education, 
and 
healthcare. 
In 1991, Lewis proposed legislation to 
establish the museum of African Amer-
ican history and worked to gather sup-
port for the proposal until George W. 
Bush signed into law a bill creating the 
National Museum of African American 
History and Culture. 
Mr. Speaker, one of the greatest hon-
ors of my professional life, and really 
my life, was the opportunity to get to 
know and serve with the great John 
Lewis in this body, and I think if you 
asked most Members who had the 
privilege of getting to know him and 
serve with him in the U.S. House of 
Representatives, that they would count 
among their finest honors to be able to 
have that privilege as well. 
Sadly, we lost Congressman Lewis, 
our beloved John, who died on July 17, 
2020, and I encourage all of my col-
leagues to honor the memory of Con-
gressman John Lewis’s legacy and his 
fight for civil rights through the dedi-
cation of the post office at 3900 Crown 
Road Southwest as the ‘‘John R. Lewis 
Post Office Building’’, and may his 
memory be for a blessing. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
b 1415 
Mr. LATURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of H.R. 5577, which would name 
a post office after our former House 
colleague, John Robert Lewis. 
Besides being a long-term Member of 
Congress and serving as chief deputy 
whip in the 110th Congress, he is best 
known for his role as a leader of the 
civil rights movement. 
Congressman Lewis’ legacy is inspir-
ing. 
John was the chairman of the Stu-
dent Nonviolent Coordinating Com-
mittee in the 1960s. He was one of the 
original Freedom Riders in 1961. 
In 1963, John helped organize the 
March on Washington. 
In 1965, John led the first of three 
marches between Selma and Mont-
gomery across the Edmund Pettus 
Bridge. 
There are few Americans as distin-
guished as John R. Lewis, and I am 
proud to support this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Georgia (Ms. WIL-
LIAMS), who has the privilege of not 
having stepped in the shoes, but to 
have succeeded the great former Con-
gressman John Lewis. 
Ms. 
WILLIAMS 
of 
Georgia. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 
5577, legislation that I introduced to re-
name the main post office on Crown 
Road in Atlanta after my mentor and 
predecessor, a friend to many of us, 
Congressman John Robert Lewis. 
Giving the Fifth Congressional Dis-
trict’s main United States post office 
Congressman Lewis’ name is a proper, 
lasting tribute to the life of a civil 
rights hero. And to have the people’s 
House take this bill up on the first day 
of Black History Month could not be 
more fitting. 
Congressman Lewis was a Freedom 
Rider, the youngest speaker at the 1963 
March on Washington, a recipient of 
the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and 
the conscience of the Congress. 
The sacrifices Congressman Lewis 
made paved the way for me to even 
stand before you today as a Member of 
this body. 
Congressman Lewis was a natural 
leader, and nearly 2 years after his 
passing, his mere memory has united 
over 360 cosponsors to honor his life 
and legacy by designating the John R. 
Lewis Postal Building. 
As I reflect on the power of over four- 
fifths of this body coming together to 
honor the life of Congressman Lewis, I 
can only imagine the good we could do 
by coming together in the same num-
bers to advance what Congressman 
Lewis called the beloved community; 
the good we could do by standing to-
gether, fiercely defending the civil 
rights that Congressman Lewis put his 
life on the line for; the good we could 
do if we all said something, did some-
thing, whenever we see something that 
is not right; the good we could all do if 
we heeded the words in Congressman 
Lewis’ final essay ‘‘to answer the high-
est calling of your heart and stand up 
for what you truly believe.’’ 
While it speaks volumes that so 
many of us have united to commemo-
rate Congressman Lewis, it would 
shout to the heavens where Mr. Lewis 
could hear us if we united with the 
same energy in the spirit of justice and 
moral obligation. 
As we look at the trying times that 
our country is facing, let us not only 
honor Congressman Lewis with the 
post office. Let us channel Congress-
man Lewis every day in Congress. Let’s 
make sure today’s passage of H.R. 5577 
is only a starting point for our work 
ahead in his honor. 
Mr. LATURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. CARTER). 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remem-
ber and honor the life of the great John 
Lewis. 
I am honored to have called Con-
gressman Lewis a colleague and, more 
importantly, a friend. Mr. Speaker, I 
have many fond memories of serving in 
Congress, but some of my fondest 
memories are walking from the Cannon 
Building over here to the Capitol with 
John Lewis. Here I am, this kid from 
south Georgia, walking with an icon 
over here to the Capitol. And we did it 
on many occasions. His office was a 
floor below mine when I was in the 
Cannon Building. 
I also cherish the time that he in-
vited Members of the Georgia delega-
tion to his home, and we had dinner 
that night. He sat and told us stories, 
stories of his experiences with Dr. 
King. I was proud to call John Lewis 
my friend. 
Like all of us in these Halls, we can 
say that his wisdom, his spirit, and his 
friendship are deeply missed. 
But what can you say about John 
Lewis that hasn’t already been said? 
He was a giant among men. He fiercely 
dedicated his life to fighting for equal-
ity and for justice for all. 
From his early days fighting segrega-
tion in Nashville, to the Freedom 
Rides, and to his service in the Halls of 
Congress, John Lewis dedicated his life 
to a more perfect Union. 
John Lewis never stopped. And now 
more than ever, it is encouraging to be 
reminded of John’s unyielding opti-
mism 
and 
faith 
in 
the 
American 
Dream. 
My hope is that today’s bill would, in 
a small way, continue his legacy. The 
bill we are considering today would 
name Atlanta’s central postal facility 
after this American hero. It is only ap-
propriate to do so for a city shaped so 
much by Mr. Lewis. 
What is more, Mr. Speaker, I am not 
sure if you have looked at the number 
of cosponsors on this bill. If you count, 
this bill has an incredible 341 cospon-
sors as of this morning. By my esti-
mates, that makes it the most bipar-
tisan bill that Congress has considered. 
And that is telling of John Lewis’ leg-
acy. 
I should note that this legislation 
has the support of Congressman Lewis’ 
family, the John and Lillian Miles

Lewis Foundation, as well as local At-
lanta officials. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative 
NIKEMA WILLIAMS, who now represents 
Mr. Lewis’ old district in Atlanta, for 
sponsoring this effort. 
As a Georgian, as a colleague, and as 
a friend, I am especially honored to 
support this legislation and urge all of 
my colleagues to do the same. 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distin-
guished gentleman from Rhode Island 
(Mr. CICILLINE), a member of the Judi-
ciary Committee who chairs the Anti-
trust, Commercial, and Administrative 
Law Subcommittee. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding and giv-
ing me an opportunity to say a few 
words about our extraordinary col-
league, the late John Lewis. 
John Lewis is someone who had such 
an enormous impact on this country, 
someone who risked his life and en-
dured violence and intimidation to 
help create a more beloved community 
and a better country. John was a 
gentle man who continued his fight for 
equality and justice and dignity for 
every single person in this country. 
Many of us had the privilege of cross-
ing the Edmund Pettus Bridge with 
John Lewis, but for me what was par-
ticularly helpful and memorable was 
that John Lewis was a champion in the 
fight for LGBTQ and the Equality Act. 
At a very critical moment, he became 
part of that effort, and I thought to 
myself: Here is a man who has already 
done more than anyone could imagine 
one person could do for human dignity, 
for equality, and for justice, and he was 
still in the fight for the LGBTQ com-
munity. 
One of the most extraordinary honors 
of my life is having served in Congress 
and, certainly, having the friendship of 
the extraordinary John Lewis, someone 
who was beloved by everyone here. 
I will end with this. When I first met 
Mr. Lewis, he called me brother. That 
went on for about 6 months. I thought 
to myself, well, he doesn’t remember 
my name. You know, that is just the 
way it is. But I soon learned that he 
called everyone brother and sister be-
cause, in John’s heart, we were all part 
of a common family. 
So this post office—and I thank Con-
gresswoman NIKEMA WILLIAMS for her 
sponsorship—will be a permanent me-
morial to the extraordinary contribu-
tions of the life of John Lewis to our 
country. 
Mr. LATURNER. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no further speakers, and I am prepared 
to close. 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, as I have said, nearly all the 
Members of this body who had the 
privilege to get to know Congressman 
Lewis would count among their finest 
honors the chance to serve in this es-
teemed institution with him. 
John was really the embodiment of 
goodness. John Lewis was someone who 
I never heard cast aspersions, who I 
never saw angry or directed anger at 
someone else. He certainly had anger 
toward injustice and really channeled 
that energy and his passion to make 
sure that everyone in the United 
States had an opportunity to live and 
experience justice as his life’s work. 
There were so many times that 
John’s rallying cry for Members of this 
institution was that we needed to stand 
up and speak out and make sure that 
we did not remain silent. That is abso-
lutely essential and is as important 
today as it was back in the 1960s and 
before that when he was walking across 
the Edmund Pettus Bridge and leading 
the fight for voting rights. We carry on 
that fight for him to this day in his 
memory. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
PELOSI), the distinguished Speaker of 
the United States House of Representa-
tives. 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for bringing this im-
portant legislation to the floor of the 
House in such a bipartisan way. 
I rise today in support of legislation 
to honor the leadership and legacy of 
Congressman John Robert Lewis. 
I thank the gentleman, who is also 
from Georgia, for presiding. It makes it 
very special to all of us. 
I support this legislation officially 
and personally, as our beloved John 
Lewis was the conscience of the Con-
gress and a dear friend to many of us 
who served with him. 
I came in with the same class as 
John Lewis, so I served with him for 
decades, and I had the benefit of seeing 
up close and personal on a daily basis 
the special nature of this man. 
Let us salute Congresswoman NIKEMA 
WILLIAMS, who has the awesome privi-
lege of serving in John Lewis’ seat for 
Georgia, for her committed leadership 
in making this legislation possible. 
John Lewis was a titan of the civil 
rights movement—we all know that—a 
moral giant on Capitol Hill and in the 
country, and a hero of American his-
tory who transformed our Nation with 
his vision, his persistence, and his 
courage. 
John offered our Nation a clarion 
voice for freedom and justice from 
lunch counters in Nashville to the Ed-
mund Pettus Bridge in Selma, from the 
steps of the Lincoln Memorial to the 
floor of the House. On the floor of the 
House, John led a demonstration in 
support of gun violence prevention that 
was historic. 
John’s extraordinary sacrifice, in-
domitable spirit, and endless gen-
erosity in the face of unimaginable ad-
versity made him revered in both 
Houses of Congress, on both sides of 
the aisle, and across the country. 
It was my solemn honor to welcome 
John back to the Capitol a final time 
in July 2020 to lie in state. 
Then, in July 2021, I had the great 
privilege of leading a congressional del-
egation to San Diego to christen the 
formidable USNS John Lewis. 
Today, we again honor John by 
affixing his name upon a post office in 
the heart of his beloved Atlanta, an-
other fitting tribute that will inspire 
generations of Georgians. 
It is appropriate we do so today as 
Americans across the Nation mark the 
beginning of Black History Month this 
very day. 
As we do so, let us pledge to continue 
to carry on John’s mission to strive for 
a more perfect Union and to work to 
build a world worthy of John Lewis’ 
legacy. 
Mr. Speaker, I also proudly honor a 
pioneering spirit and a friend of John 
Lewis’, a progressive champion and a 
dear longtime friend of so many of us, 
Congresswoman Lynn Woolsey, with 
legislation to rename the Petaluma 
downtown post office in her honor, 
which I am proud to cosponsor as a 
Californian. 
We pay a proper tribute to an inspir-
ing leader who has improved the lives 
of countless working families in the 
bay area and beyond. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman 
JARED
HUFFMAN
for his committed 
leadership to bring this legislation to 
the floor and for carrying on a great 
legacy that he and Lynn Woolsey 
shared of leadership on behalf of the 
families of the north bay. 
During Lynn’s two decades in the 
House on the Education and Labor 
Committee and as co-chair of the Con-
gressional Progressive Caucus, she was 
a leader on welfare reform in the nine-
ties, opposing the war in Iraq since day 
one, working relentlessly on ending 
gender 
discrimination, 
championing 
fervently our environment, and, again, 
bravely protesting the genocide in 
Darfur. 
So the Congress will salute her in-
strumental leadership. She was one of 
the leaders who established Women’s 
History Month, an important tradition 
allowing us to pay homage to the ex-
traordinary women on whose shoulders 
we now stand. 
For two reasons I come to the floor. 
Of course, one, to share in honoring 
John Lewis in the naming of the post 
office, and to honor Lynn Woolsey. I 
hope we have a strong bipartisan ‘‘aye’’ 
in both cases. 
Mr. Speaker, I again thank Chair 
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ for affording me 
this opportunity to speak on behalf of 
two great champions of the Congress, 
and I urge an ‘‘aye’’ vote. 
b 1430 
Mr. LATURNER. Mr. Speaker, I sup-
port this bill, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, it is an incredible privilege to 
be able to manage the time on this leg-
islation to name the main post office 
in the city of Atlanta after the great 
and late Honorable John R. Lewis. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

PROMOTING RIGOROUS AND INNO-
VATIVE COST EFFICIENCIES FOR 
FEDERAL 
PROCUREMENT 
AND 
ACQUISITIONS ACT OF 2021 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, I move to suspend the rules 
and pass the bill (S. 583) to promote in-
novative acquisition techniques and 
procurement strategies, and for other 
purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 583 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Promoting 
Rigorous and Innovative Cost Efficiencies 
for Federal Procurement and Acquisitions 
Act of 2021’’ or the ‘‘PRICE Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds that— 
(1) small business participation in the Fed-
eral marketplace is key to ensuring a strong 
industrial base; 
(2) the Business Opportunity Development 
Reform Act of 1988 (Public Law 100–656) sets 
forth the requirement for the President to 
establish Government-wide goals for pro-
curement contracts awarded to small busi-
nesses; 
(3) each year, the Small Business Adminis-
tration works with each Federal agency to 
set their respective contracting goals and 
publishes a scorecard to ensure that the 
total of all Federal agency goals meets the 
required targets for the Federal Government; 
(4) the Department has received among the 
highest scorecard letter grades 10 years in a 
row and is the largest Federal agency to 
have such a track record; 
(5) in virtually every segment of the econ-
omy of the United States, including the 
homeland security community, there are 
small businesses working to support the mis-
sion and playing a critical role in delivering 
efficient and innovative solutions to the ac-
quisition needs of the Federal Government; 
(6) the Procurement Innovation Lab of the 
Department— 
(A) is aimed at experimenting with innova-
tive acquisition techniques across the Home-
land Security Enterprise; 
(B) provides a forum to test new ideas, 
share lessons learned, and promote best prac-
tices; 
(C) fosters cultural changes that promote 
innovation and managed risk taking through 
a continuous cycle of testing, obtaining feed-
back, sharing information, and retesting 
where appropriate; and 
(D) aims to make the acquisition process 
more smooth and innovative within the con-
struct of the Federal Acquisition Regulation 
for both the Federal Government and con-
tractors; and 
(7) despite progress in the adoption of new 
and better business practices by many Fed-
eral agencies, the overall adoption of mod-
ernized business practices and advanced 
technologies across the Federal Government 
remains slow and uneven.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-

Florida (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ) and 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Kansas 
(Mr. 
LATURNER) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Florida. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous 
material on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Florida? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 
583, the Promoting Rigorous and Inno-
vative Cost Efficiencies for Federal 
Procurement and Acquisitions Act, or 
the PRICE Act. 
This bipartisan bill was introduced 
by Chairman GARY PETERS of the Com-
mittee on Homeland Security and Gov-
ernmental Affairs, along with Senators 
ERNST and CARPER. I commend them 
for their bipartisan leadership, as well 
as JOE NEGUSE for leading the House 
companion bill. 
Mr. Speaker, to meet its complex and 
critical missions in service of the 
American people, the Federal Govern-
ment must ensure that its procurement 
practices make use of innovative ap-
proaches that maximize the ingenuity 
and opportunity of American small 
business. 
These small businesses are the back-
bone of the American economy and the 
breeding ground for cutting edge solu-
tions that can be transformative in 
government 
operations. 
Recognizing 
that the Department of Homeland Se-
curity has been a leader in small busi-
ness utilization, the PRICE Act re-
quires it to publish an annual report on 
the projects of its Procurement Innova-
tion Lab. 
Dedicated to improving the acquisi-
tion process within the construct of 
the Federal Acquisition Regulation, 
the lab is a proving ground for innova-
tive ideas and a forum for developing 
and sharing lessons learned and best 
practices. 
Under the bill, the Department would 
be required to develop guidance and 
training on innovative procurement 
techniques for contracting and pro-
gram management personnel, and to 
make these best practices available to 
other Federal agencies. 
The bill would also convene the Chief 
Acquisition Officers Council to exam-
ine and report on best practices in ac-
quisition innovation in Federal con-
tracting, including through small busi-
ness engagement, which is vital to 
keeping our industrial base strong and 
vibrant. 
The report would include a review of 
the practices and technology applica-
tions with the greatest success in im-
proving program outcomes, enhancing 
customer experience, and meeting the 
Federal Government’s small business 
contracting goals. These goals cannot 
be a check-the-box exercise that pro-
vides opportunity to only a handful of 
companies. Rather, they must be about 
opening the doors of Federal con-
tracting to as many small businesses 
as possible to expand our industrial 
base. 
The PRICE Act will pave the way for 
more cohesive and widespread adoption 
of modernized business practices and 
advanced technologies across the Fed-
eral Government. It also has the power 
to advance the goals of the Small Busi-
ness Act by creating greater oppor-
tunity for small businesses. 
Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, I urge 
my colleagues to support this bill, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LATURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the Federal procure-
ment and acquisition process is often 
cumbersome, complex, and inefficient. 
Doing business with the Federal Gov-
ernment is expensive and time-con-
suming. In fact, many commercial ven-
dors must hire staff who are respon-
sible for understanding the Federal ac-
quisition regulatory requirements just 
so they can do business with the gov-
ernment. 
For small businesses with fewer re-
sources, this is an even greater chal-
lenge. In reality, most small businesses 
are struggling to survive in the Biden 
economy, let alone trying to navigate 
complex procurement processes and 
regulations. 
The Department of Homeland Secu-
rity’s Procurement Innovation Lab has 
issued reports stressing the need for in-
novative approaches to making Federal 
procurement more effective and effi-
cient. Thankfully, the PRICE Act will 
help put those insights into action. 
The PRICE Act requires DHS to de-
velop department-wide guidance and 
training to improve procurement meth-
ods. These procurement best practices, 
which encourage reducing the time to 
award contracts, achieving cost sav-
ings, and better serving agency mission 
outcomes will be shared with other 
Federal agencies via a report. 
Also under the PRICE Act, the Office 
of Management and Budget will con-
vene a working group within the Chief 
Acquisition Officers Council to identify 
and disseminate government-wide best 
practices to modernize Federal con-
tracting. Such best practices will focus 
on better utilizing small businesses, in-
creasing procurement efficiency, im-
proving program outcomes, and achiev-
ing a better customer experience at 
agencies. 
The working group will provide its 
recommendations to Congress, which 
will help us identify and pursue smart 
procurement policy reforms. This is 
critical to ensure our Nation’s Federal 
agencies can efficiently purchase the 
best products and services to serve the 
American people. 
Mr. Speaker, this is not a Big Gov-
ernment bill. It is a big idea bill. The 
PRICE Act does not mandate that the 
Government 
employ 
certain 
ap-
proaches. Rather, through reporting re-
quirements, it will equip Federal agen-
cies with innovative acquisition prac-
tices. It will develop best practices to 
improve procurement methods across 
the government and the PRICE Act 
will help small businesses conduct 
business within the government. 
This bill does not establish perma-
nent programs or requirements but 
simply requires key Federal entities to 
conduct careful study and distribute 
the resulting recommendations govern-
ment-wide and to Congress. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bipartisan legislation, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, I urge passage of S. 583, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. 
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 
583. 
The question was taken.

Specialist Turcotte was deeply com-
mitted to our Nation and served the 
country with distinction. 
In 2017, he was killed during a live- 
fire training exercise at Fort Carson, 
Colorado. He is survived by his wife, 
parents, and two sisters. I encourage 
all of my colleagues to join me in hon-
oring his legacy by naming the post of-
fice at 42 Main Street as the Specialist 
Matthew R. Turcotte Post Office. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of

a 
Slatersville, Rhode Island, post office 
after Army Specialist Matthew R. 
Turcotte. 
Matthew Turcotte was a lifelong resi-
dent of Smithfield where he played 
high school football just 4 miles down 
the road from the post office that will 
bear his name. While in high school, 
Turcotte enlisted in the U.S. Army and 
served with the 2nd Infantry Brigade 
Combat Team of the 4th Infantry Divi-
sion. He was deployed overseas to 
Kosovo and earned the Army Achieve-
ment Medal and the Global War on Ter-
rorism Service Medal, among others. 
In 2017, he was tragically killed dur-
ing a training exercise at Fort Carson, 
Colorado. This American hero is dearly 
missed by his wife, parents, sisters, and 
friends. Specialist Turcotte was a dedi-
cated soldier and patriot. 
Mr. Speaker, I support this bill, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Rhode 
Island 
(Mr. 
CICILLINE), in whose district the post 
office resides. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of S. 566, legislation 
to rename the United States Postal 
Service facility in Slatersville, Rhode 
Island, 
the 
Specialist 
Matthew 
R. 
Turcotte Post Office. 
A fallen soldier from North Smith-
field who gave his life in service of his 
country, Specialist Matthew Turcotte 
was tragically killed during a training 
accident in 2017 when he was only 20 
years old. An exceptional young man 
who exemplified the utmost commit-
ment to serving his community and his 
country, Matthew’s service continues 
to make all Rhode Island proud. 
Matthew, a lifelong North Smithfield 
resident eager to serve his country, en-
listed in the U.S. Army while attending 
North Smithfield High School, where 
he was cocaptain of the football team 
and a member of the track and field 
team. 
After his graduation in 2015, Matthew 
enlisted as a specialist and began his 
military career at Fort Benning. Dur-
ing his 2 short, enlisted years, he 
earned numerous awards for his serv-
ice, including the Army Achievement 
Medal, 
National 
Defense 
Service 
Medal, 
the 
Armed 
Forces 
Expedi-
tionary Medal, the Global War on Ter-
rorism Service Medal, the Army Serv-
ice Ribbon, the Overseas Ribbon, and 
the NATO Medal. 
Matthew’s superiors in the military 
described him as a tremendous soldier 
who exemplified selfless service to our 
military and our Nation. He was de-
ployed to Kosovo in 2016, and following 
his return, married his high school 
sweetheart and beloved wife, Megan. 
In August of 2017, Matthew was killed 
during a live-ammunition training ex-
ercise at Fort Carson in Colorado while 
serving with the 2nd Infantry Brigade 
Combat Team of the 4th Infantry Divi-
sion. 
As we prepare to dedicate this post 
office in Matthew’s memory, I am 
thinking about his father, Raymond; 
his mother, Liza; his wife, Megan; his 
sisters, Kayla and Paige; and all his ex-
tended family and loved ones. 
Mr. Speaker, let us never forget the 
enormous debt of gratitude that we 
owe to not just Matthew and his fam-
ily, but to all military families across 
the country who support the brave men 
and women who defend our Nation and 
often shoulder the pain of unimagi-
nable grief and loss. 
b 1445 
The decision to live one’s life in serv-
ice of others is never an easy one, and 
Matthew’s commitment to a vocation 
of service represented the very best of 
our Nation and Rhode Island. For his 
patriotism, for his love of family and 
community, and for his dedication to 
the principles we as Americans hold 
dear, we salute Matthew and dedicate 
this post office in his honor. 
I know that Matthew’s legacy will 
continue to inspire our community in 
North Smithfield and all Rhode Island-
ers. 
The dedication of this post office is 
an enduring expression of our gratitude 
for his service and a permanent re-
minder of his sacrifice. We know that 
Matthew’s legacy and the impact he 
had on those who knew and loved him 
will far outlast anything we do or say, 
Mr. Speaker, but it is the least we can 
do for one of the great heroes of our 
Nation, Matthew R. Turcotte. 
Mr. LATURNER. Mr. Speaker, I sup-
port this bill and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, may the memory of Matthew 
R. Turcotte be for a blessing, and I 
urge passage of S. 566, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. 
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 
566. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it.

The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Florida. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Florida? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 2324, to designate the facility of 
the United States Postal Service lo-
cated at 2800 South Adams Street in 
Tallahassee, Florida, as the D. Edwina 
Stephens Post Office. 
Edwina Stephens is remembered as a 
unique and influential community ac-
tivist who touched people’s lives in nu-
merous roles for over 50 years. 
Born in Rocky Ford, Georgia, Edwina 
spent the majority of her adult life as 
a member of the Tallahassee commu-
nity. Professionally, she was known as 
a 
fabulous 
nurse 
who 
pioneered 
changes 
in 
Tallahassee’s 
local 
healthcare industry at Florida A&M 
University and Tallahassee Memorial 
Hospital. 
In the community, she was recog-
nized for being an acclaimed environ-
mentalist and tireless activist who suc-
cessfully campaigned against cases of 
environmental disenfranchisement and 
fought inequality of neighborhood serv-
ices in underserved communities. 
Ms. Stephens’ achievements in Talla-
hassee include facilitating the hiring of 
Black cashiers at Winn-Dixie stores, 
leading the successful crusade to shut 
down the Medical Waste Facility on 
the southside, and spearheading the in-
frastructure 
revitalization 
for 
the 
Southside. These activities improved 
the quality of life not only for South-
side residents, but for all the people of 
Tallahassee. 
In addition to her mission of advo-
cating for positive change, Edwina was 
a historian and visionary for many on-
going projects. Ms. Stephens is also re-
membered as a warm, caring woman 
who possessed political grit and organi-
zational skills needed to foster endur-
ing relationships between government, 
media, and the community. 
I encourage my colleagues to join me 
in honoring a pioneer in the healthcare 
community by naming the post office 
at 2800 South Adams Street as the D. 
Edwina Stephens Post Office. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. LATURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
2324, which would name a Tallahassee 
post office after D. Edwina Stephens. 
Edwina Stephens was a community 
activist, a civil rights icon, and nurse, 
working 
to 
improve 
Tallahassee’s 
Southside neighborhoods. She was af-
fectionately known as the ‘‘Mother of 
Southside.’’ She was also awarded the 
‘‘Florida Finest Award’’ by former 
Governor Lawton Chiles. 
Mr. Speaker, I support this bill and 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, as a member of the Florida 
delegation, I am proud to help honor a 
daughter of the State of Florida, and I 
urge passage of H.R. 2324, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. 
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 2324. 
The question was taken.

Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, I move to suspend the rules 
and pass the bill (H.R. 735) to designate

Service located at 502 East Cotati Ave-
nue in Cotati, California, as the ‘‘Ar-

Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 735, to designate the facility of 
the United States Postal Service lo-
cated at 502 East Cotati Avenue in 
Cotati, California, as the Arthur L. 
Ibleto Post Office Building. 
Mr. Ibleto reigned in the Sonoma 
County food and wine community for 
nearly 50 years as its one and only 
‘‘Pasta King.’’ His Italian catering and 
frozen food business is an institution 
and his award-winning grapes can be 
found in numerous Sonoma Valley 
wines. 
Mr. Ibleto was known for his gen-
erosity and he lent considerable time 
and 
resources 
to 
charitable, 
edu-
cational, and civic causes. He contin-
ued working full-time until his passing 
on November 24, 2020, at age 94. 
But his accomplishments are not lim-
ited to food, wine, and the building of 
his community. At just 17, Mr. Ibleto 
deserted Mussolini’s fascist army to 
join the Italian resistance and fought 
behind enemy lines to help the Allies 
defeat Nazi Germany during World War 
II. 
In 1949, he left Italy for Petaluma, 
California, where he met and married 
Victoria Eleanor Ghirardelli. The two 
settled in Cotati, California, in 1951.

cated at 223 West Chalan Santo Papa in

as 
the 
Atanasio 
Taitano Perez Post Office. 
Mr. Atanasio Taitano Perez was a 
life-long public servant to Guam and 
the United States. 
Over the course of his 36-year career 
he not only served as the first post-
master of Guam, but also served in the 
Guam judicial system serving as chief 
clerk, and later associate justice in the 
Guam High Court of Equity. 
Mr. Perez was also involved in peti-
tioning Congress to establish Guam’s 
permanent civilian government, which 
its citizens enjoy today. 
Unfortunately, he did not live long 
enough to see his efforts through, as he 
passed away on April 23, 1950. President 
Truman signed the Guam Organic Act 
into law 3 months later on August 1, 
1950. 
To this day, Mr. Perez is revered for 
his efforts not only in civil service, but 
also for advocacy on behalf of the 
Chamorro and Guamanian people of 
Guam. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my 
colleagues to join me in honoring Mr. 
Perez’ legacy by naming the post office

It is fitting that this post office 
would be named for Perez, who was ap-
pointed as the first postmaster of 
Guam in 1901. In addition to his exten-
sive government service, Perez was per-
sonally involved in the movement that 
petitioned Congress for U.S. citizenship 
for the people of Guam.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H320 
February 1, 2022 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my 
colleagues in consideration of H.R. 2842 
to designate the facility of the United 
States Postal Service located at 120 4th 
Street in Petaluma, California, as the 
Lynn C. Woolsey Post Office Building. 
Lynn Woolsey was born Lynn Carol 
Robinson in Seattle, Washington, on 
November 3, 1937. A graduate of Se-
attle’s Lincoln High School, Woolsey 
attended the University of Washington 
from 1955 to 1957. She left school to 
marry Terry J. Critchett in 1958, and 
they eventually settled in Marin Coun-
ty, California. They had three children, 
Joseph, Ed, and Amy. 
After working as a secretary at a 
technology company and relying partly 
on welfare assistance, Woolsey opened 
a personnel services firm and returned 
to college at the University of San 
Francisco to earn her bachelor’s degree 
in 1980. 
In 1984, Woolsey won a seat on the 
Petaluma City Council, where she 
served until 1992, including as vice 
mayor in her final year. When Cali-
fornia Representative Barbara Boxer 
ran for the Senate in 1992, Woolsey ran 
to replace her and was elected in 1993 
with 65 percent of the vote. 
Congresswoman Woolsey served on 
the House Budget Committee, the Gov-
ernment Operations Committee, and 
the Education and Labor Committee. 
As subcommittee chair of the Work-
force Protections Subcommittee, she 
led a measure to provide job-protected 
leave for family members of injured 
soldiers. 
Among other successes, Congress-
woman Woolsey fought legislation that 
threatened to reduce the scope of wel-
fare programs; advocated for expanding 
school breakfast programs; and spon-
sored legislation to encourage young 
girls to study math and science, her 
‘‘Go, Girl’’ initiative. 
As co-chair of the Congressional Pro-
gressive Caucus, Congresswoman Wool-
sey advocated for a budget proposal to 
lower the deficit while supporting the 
social safety net. 
A prominent member of the Out of 
Iraq Caucus, Woolsey criticized the 
George W. Bush administration’s pros-
ecution of the war, voted consistently 
to suspend funding for the war, and in-
troduced a bill to redirect $60 billion in 
Pentagon funds toward domestic civil-
ian programs. 
Throughout her congressional career, 
Woolsey tended to her northern Cali-
fornia district. She delivered hundreds 
of millions of dollars back home for a 
variety of capital-intensive projects, 
including $9 million for a Petaluma 
River flood control project and $52 mil-
lion for a seismic retrofit of the Golden 
Gate Bridge. 
Naming a post office for Lynn C. 
Woolsey is entirely appropriate given 
her distinguished career and contribu-
tions to her State and country, and I 
urge all Members to support this bill. 
I will just add what a privilege it was 
to have a chance to get to know and 
serve with Lynn Woolsey. She was a 
fierce advocate for her point of view. 
She spent every single day on the floor 
of this body during the Iraq war and 
spoke out against it every single day 
without fail. She is a woman of her 
convictions and someone who fiercely 
defended making sure that her con-
stituents’ voices were heard. 
Mr. Speaker, it was a privilege to 
serve with her, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. LATURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 2842, which would name a Cali-
fornia post office after former Con-
gresswoman Lynn Woolsey. 
Woolsey first entered politics after 
winning a seat on the Petaluma City 
Council in 1984. She served on the city 
council until 1992, when she entered the 
race to succeed then-Representative 
Barbara Boxer. 
During her two decades in the U.S. 
House, she brought attention to the 
struggles of impoverished women and 
children. She retired from Congress in 
2013 at the end of the 112th Congress. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. HUFFMAN), 
who succeeded Congresswoman Wool-
sey. 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman from Florida and my 
other colleagues for their kind words 
about our friend, my predecessor and 
our former colleague, Lynn Woolsey. 
Lynn is a one-of-a-kind, barrier- 
breaking trailblazer and a lifelong ad-
vocate for women and working fami-
lies. In her 20 years of service in this 
body, she was a passionate voice for 
progressive values, unflinching in her 
convictions and ahead of her time in so 
many ways. Speaker PELOSI
often 
called her the conscience of the Con-
gress. 
She was born and raised in Seattle, 
Washington, but she put her roots 
down as a young woman in Sonoma 
County, raising a family, becoming a 
civic leader, and eventually launching 
a political career. She chaired the 
Sonoma County Commission on the 
Status of Women and then served on 
the Petaluma City Council before being 
elected to the House in the ‘‘Year of 
the Woman.’’ 
Congresswoman Woolsey understood 
firsthand the challenges and struggles 
confronting single mothers because she 
lived them. She never forgot the hard-
ships she faced when she was forced to 
go on public assistance to keep her 
family afloat. It was because of this 
journey as a former welfare mother— 
the first to ever serve in Congress— 
that she fought so hard for children 
and families. 
She dedicated her career to improv-
ing education and empowering Amer-
ican workers through her service on 
the Education and Labor Committee 
and as ranking member of the Work-
force Protections Subcommittee. She 
was a champion for healthier school 
meals and sponsored the first-ever ex-
pansion of FMLA to ensure that mili-
tary families have access to leave to 
prepare for a deployment or to care for 
a wounded warrior. 
Lynn also served as co-chair of the 
Congressional 
Progressive 
Caucus, 
using that platform to push for work-
ers’ rights, environmental justice, and 
equity for all as well as a people’s 
budget that would invest in working 
people instead of corporate tax cuts 
and military campaigns. 
Her passion for conservation and pro-
tecting our national heritage can be 
seen throughout my district. From the 
rebuilding of Hamilton Wetlands and 
Bel Marin Keys, to the cleanup of 
Skaggs Island, to the dredging of crit-
ical waterways, her work will ensure 
future 
generations 
can 
enjoy 
the 
breathtaking beauty of California’s 
north bay. 
One of her greatest, hardest-fought 
achievements was the expansion of the 
Cordell Bank and Greater Farallones 
National Marine Sanctuaries. Because 
of her work, one of the most productive 
marine areas off the West Coast is now 
permanently protected. 
Since she was a young child, Lynn 
wished for a more peaceful and just 
world. Mr. Speaker, you have just 
heard some words about her advocacy 
for peace and the way she spoke 
against the Iraq war. Together with 
BARBARA LEE and MAXINE WATERS— 
they called themselves the Triad—she 
formed the Out of Afghanistan and Out 
of Iraq Caucuses to promote a safe, re-
sponsible way to bring our troops home 
and to put an end to those conflicts. 
As some of the floor staff may re-
member, Lynn gave nearly 500 Special 
Order hour speeches advocating for 
what she called smart security, a pro-
gressive approach to global engage-
ment and foreign policy, one that em-
phasized diplomacy and humanitarian 
assistance rather than military force. 
Her work in Congress was all about 
fighting for children and families, and 
nothing made her prouder than her 
own children and family. Anyone who 
knows Lynn understands that she con-
siders them her greatest legacy of all. 
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of my col-
leagues, I am so honored today to ask 
for you to vote ‘‘yes’’ and join me in 
honoring 
Congresswoman 
Woolsey’s 
unique and exemplary career and serv-
ice by passing this legislation. 
Mr. LATURNER. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no further speakers. I support this bill, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, what a gift to be able to help 
name this post office and give this 
well-deserved honor to a remarkable 
woman, who I hope is watching right 
now, because she deserves every ounce 
of the respect that this naming rep-
resents. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 
2842, and I yield back the balance of my 
time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H321 
February 1, 2022 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to support this honor for Congress-
woman Lynn Woolsey. 
As a single mom with three small children, 
she went on welfare before working her way 
to success in both business and local politics. 
She went on to serve with distinction in Con-
gress but she never forgot the children. 
In Congress she was a fierce advocate for 
peace her entire career and she was right. 
She was a founding member of the Out of Iraq 
Caucus when that was not very popular with 
the general public and with most of our con-
gressional colleagues. She was right about so-
cial policy. She was right about war and 
peace. And she is a delightful human being. I 
am pleased to support this commemoration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. 
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 2842. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Mr. Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

JEREMY L. RIDLEN POST OFFICE 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, I move to suspend the rules 
and pass the bill (H.R. 3579) to des-
ignate the facility of the United States 
Postal Service located at 200 East Main 
Street in Maroa, Illinois, as the ‘‘Jer-
emy L. Ridlen Post Office’’. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 3579 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. JEREMY L. RIDLEN POST OFFICE. 
(a) 
DESIGNATION.—The 
facility 
of 
the 
United States Postal Service located at 200 
East Main Street in Maroa, Illinois, shall be 
known and designated as the ‘‘Jeremy L. 
Ridlen Post Office’’. 
(b) REFERENCES.—Any reference in a law, 
map, regulation, document, paper, or other 
record of the United States to the facility re-
ferred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to

ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ) and 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Kansas 
(Mr. 
LATURNER) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Florida. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous 
material on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Florida? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 3579 to designate the facility of 
the United States Postal Service lo-
cated at 200 East Main Street in Maroa, 
Illinois, as the Jeremy L. Ridlen Post 
Office. 
Army National Guard Specialist Jer-
emy L. Ridlen was born in Maroa, Illi-
nois, where he attended Maroa-Forsyth 
High School with his twin brother, 
Jason. Jeremy and Jason were students 
at Illinois State University, where they 
joined the National Guard and were as-
signed to the 1544th Transportation 
Company. In 2003, the National Guard 
activated their unit and deployed them 
to Fallujah, Iraq, where Jeremy served 
as postal clerk. 
On May 23, 2004, Jeremy was killed 
after a truck rigged with explosives 
detonated next to his convoy. He was 
23 years old. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to join me in honoring Jeremy 
L. Ridlen, who made the ultimate sac-
rifice for his country, by naming the 
post office at 200 East Main Street 
after him, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. LATURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this 
bill, which would name a post office in 
Illinois after Army National Guard 
Specialist Jeremy Ridlen. 
Ridlen was born and raised in Maroa, 
Illinois. Jeremy and twin brother, 
Jason, went on to attend Illinois State 
University, and both signed up for the 
National Guard. 
They were assigned to the 1544 Trans-
portation Company, which was acti-
vated in 2003 and deployed to Fallujah, 
Iraq. Jeremy served as the postal clerk 
there. 
Sadly, on May 23, 2004, Jeremy was 
killed in an ambush after a truck ex-
ploded next to his convoy. 
Specialist Ridlen was an outstanding 
patriot, and I encourage my colleagues 
to support this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from Illinois (Mr. RODNEY 
DAVIS). 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my colleagues for giv-
ing us the opportunity to honor a hero, 
Jeremy Ridlen. 
I rise in support of this bill today to 
designate the United States Postal 
Service facility in Maroa, Illinois, as 
the Jeremy L. Ridlen Post Office. 
Army Specialist Jeremy Ridlen was 
born and raised in Maroa, Illinois, 
where he attended Maroa-Forsyth High 
School with his twin brother, Jason. 
Jeremy and Jason, like my twin 
boys, were inseparable. They were ac-
tive in their church, played on its soft-
ball team, and were included in its 
weekly prayer list after they both de-
ployed. 
Jeremy and Jason attended Illinois 
State University and joined the Na-
tional Guard shortly thereafter. Their 
unit, the 1544 Transportation Company, 
was deployed to Iraq in 2003. On May 23, 
2004, after a truck rigged with an IED 
detonated next to his convoy, small 
arms fire killed Jeremy in the ambush. 
Designating this post office in honor 
of Jeremy will serve as a testament to 
his bravery and a reminder of all those 
who laid down their life for the United 
States of America. 
Jeremy Ridlen died serving his coun-
try, and for that, he is a hero to all of 
us. He put his country above all else, 
and we thank him for his service and 
are thinking of his entire family back 
in Illinois today. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote for this legislation. 
Mr. LATURNER. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no further speakers. I support this bill, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, I would say to the gentleman 
from Illinois that as a fellow parent of 
twins—mine are 22—I send deepest con-
dolences. Although I know his passing 
was back in 2004, I know the pain is 
fresh for his family. It is an honor to be 
able to join my colleagues in helping to 
name this post office. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 
3579, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. 
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 3579. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

the United States Postal Service lo-
cated at 202 Trumbull Street in Saint 
Clair, Michigan, as the Corporal Jef-
frey 
Robert 
Standfest 
Post 
Office 
Building. 
Corporal Jeffrey Robert Standfest 
was born on April 24, 1987. He was a 2005 
graduate of Saint Clair High School 
where, during his senior year, he won 
12 of his 14 cross-country races and was 
named the Times Herald newspaper’s 
Runner of the Year. He also ran cross- 
country during his tenure at Oakland 
University and helped lead his team to 
a conference championship. 
Described as an all-American kid, he 
joined the military because his grand-
father had served in the Marines during 
World War II. Due to his constant dem-
onstration of maturity and leadership, 
Corporal Standfest was selected to be-
come one of his unit’s few dog han-
dlers, in addition to his role as a com-
bat engineer. 
In Afghanistan, he had been oper-
ating alongside his fellow engineers as 
a dog handler to detect IEDs and assist 
the route clearance platoon. Sadly, 
while attempting to clear a building on 
June 16, 2010, tragedy struck in the 
Helmand province of Afghanistan when 
Corporal Standfest, along with his 
bomb-sniffing dog, Sergeant Ruppert, 
was 
killed 
by 
an 
IED. 
Corporal 
Standfest was only 23 years old. 
In the aftermath of his death, then- 
Governor Granholm lowered flags to 
halfstaff. Corporal Standfest was post-
humously awarded the Purple Heart. 
He was previously awarded the Combat 
Action Ribbon, National Defense Serv-
ice 
Medal, 
Afghanistan 
Campaign 
Medal, Global War on Terrorism Medal, 
and the NATO medal. 
Naming a post office after Corporal 
Standfest is appropriate, given his 
dedication to his country. I urge my 
colleagues to join me in honoring Cor-
poral Standfest. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time 
Mr. LATURNER. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this 
bill which honors Corporal Jeffrey Rob-
ert Standfest. Inspired by his grand-
father, a Marine in World War II, this 
all-American kid joined the military as 
a combat engineer. Corporal Standfest 
was later selected to become one of his 
unit’s few dog handlers, a testament to 
his maturity. 
Tragically, Corporal Standfest was 
killed by an IED on June 16, 2010, while 
clearing a building in the Helmand 
province of Afghanistan. His bomb- 
sniffing dog, Sergeant Ruppert, was 
also killed. Corporal Standfest was 
only 23 years old. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly encourage 
my colleagues to support this bill hon-
oring a true American hero. I support 
this bill, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LATURNER. I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. 
MCCLAIN). 
Mrs. MCCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, the 
House will vote on my bill to rename 
the Saint Clair Post Office after Ma-
rine Corporal Jeffrey Robert Standfest. 
Before we do, I want to tell you a little 
bit about the life of this brave young 
man. 
Mr. Speaker, Corporal Standfest was 
described by those who knew him as re-
spectful, 
family-oriented, 
dedicated, 
hardworking, and the all-American 
kid. 
He was a runner at Saint Clair High 
School where he graduated in 2005. His 
success as a runner, along with his rep-
utation as a leader, continued during 
his time at Oakland University. In 2008, 
wanting to follow in the footsteps of 
his grandfather who served our Nation 
during World War II, Jeff enlisted in 
the Marine Corps. He was deployed to 
Afghanistan as a combat engineer and 
a K9 handler. Tragically on June 16, 
Corporal Standfest and his canine, Ser-
geant Ruppert, were killed by an IED. 
He was only 23 years old. 
Mr. Speaker, we must always remem-
ber that the rights and freedoms we as 
Americans hold dear are only secured 
through the courage and sacrifice of 
those who serve. Eleven years later, his 
memory, his courage, and his sacrifice 
are kept alive by his parents, Timothy 
and Karen, and his sister, Jaclyn, all of 
whom knew him and loved him. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill could never 
heal the wounds of losing him, but pas-
sage of this bill will demonstrate to his 
loved ones that Congress and this coun-
try will never forget his bravery and 
ultimate sacrifice. Passage of this bill 
will ensure that the residents of Saint 
Clair will always be reminded about 
their high school star runner, the all- 
American kid who answered the call to 
serve and gave his life in defense of this 
great country. 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, I am prepared to close. 
Mr. LATURNER. Mr. Speaker, I want 
to thank my colleague from Michigan 
for coming down here to speak about 
such a brave American hero. 
Mr. Speaker, I have no further speak-
ers. I am prepared to close. I do support 
this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, I urge passage and yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. 
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 3613.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H323 
February 1, 2022 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 4168 to designate the facility of 
the United States Postal Service lo-
cated at 6223 Maple Street as the Petty 
Officer 
1st 
Class 
Charles 
Jackson 
French Post Office. 
Petty Officer Charles Jackson French 
was born in Arkansas in 1919 and first 
enlisted in the United States Navy in 
1937. In 1941, Petty Officer French com-
pleted his first enlistment but decided 
to reenlist after the devastating attack 
on Pearl Harbor that December. 
Petty Officer French served as a mess 
attendant on the USS Gregory when the 
military was racially segregated, but 
that did not stop him from rescuing 15 
of his fellow injured sailors when their 
ship was attacked and sunk by Japa-
nese gunfire. 
Petty 
Officer 
French 
helped 
his 
crewmates into a life raft and tied it to 
himself, swimming for nearly 8 hours 
through 
nightfall 
and 
swarming 
sharks, until they were finally identi-
fied and rescued. For this, he received 
a letter of commendation from Admi-
ral William F. Halsey, Jr., in May of 
1943. 
After retiring from the military, 
Petty Officer French moved to Omaha 
before moving to San Diego where he 
passed away at the age of 37. 
Mr. Speaker, naming a post office 
after Petty Officer 1st Class Charles 
Jackson French is a way to honor his 
dedication to his country. I encourage 
my colleagues to join me. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. LATURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 4168 which would name a post 
office after Petty Officer Charles Jack-
son French. 
Petty Officer French enlisted in the 
U.S. Navy in 1937. He completed his 
first enlistment in 1941 but decided to 
reenlist after the horrendous attack on 
Pearl Harbor. 
He served as a mess attendant on the 
USS Gregory where he saved 15 of his 
fellow sailors when their ship was at-
tacked and sunk by Japanese gunfire. 
Officer French helped his fellow sailors 
into a lifeboat, tied it to himself, and 
swam for nearly 8 hours in the dark 
until they were finally rescued 
After retiring from the military, 
Petty Officer French moved to Omaha

STAFF SERGEANT MARSHAL 
ROBERTS POST OFFICE BUILDING 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, I move to suspend the rules 
and pass the bill (H.R. 1298) to des-
ignate the facility of the United States 
Postal Service located at 1233 North 
Cedar Street in Owasso, Oklahoma, as 
the ‘‘Staff Sergeant Marshal Roberts 
Post Office Building’’. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1298 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. TECHNICAL SERGEANT MARSHAL 
ROBERTS POST OFFICE BUILDING. 
(a) 
DESIGNATION.—The 
facility 
of 
the 
United States Postal Service located at 1233 
North Cedar Street in Owasso, Oklahoma, 
shall be known and designated as the ‘‘Tech-
nical Sergeant Marshal Roberts Post Office 
Building’’. 
(b) REFERENCES.—Any reference in a law, 
map, regulation, document, paper, or other 
record of the United States to the facility re-
ferred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to 
be a reference to the ‘‘Technical Sergeant 
Marshal Roberts Post Office Building’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ) and 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Kansas 
(Mr. 
LATURNER) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Florida. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Florida? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 1298 to designate the facility of 
the United States Postal Service lo-
cated at 1233 North Cedar Street in 
Owasso, Oklahoma, as the Technical 
Sergeant Marshal Roberts Post Office. 
At the age of 28, Technical Sergeant 
Marshal D. Roberts deployed with the 
219th Engineering Installation Squad-
ron, 138th Fighter Wing, Oklahoma Air 
National Guard in support of Operation 
Inherent Resolve. 
He died as a result of a rocket attack 
from an Iran-backed militia group at 
Camp Taji on March 11, 2020. Technical 
Sergeant Roberts was the first member 
in the history of the Oklahoma Air Na-
tional Guard to be killed in combat. 
Technical Sergeant Roberts gave the 
ultimate sacrifice for this country, and 
his service will never be forgotten. He 
is survived by his wife and fellow mem-
ber of the Tulsa-based 138th Fighter 
Wing, Kristie Roberts, and their 8-year- 
old daughter, Paityn. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my 
colleagues to join me in honoring 
Technical Sergeant Marshal D. Roberts 
by naming the post office at 1233 North 
Cedar Street as the Technical Sergeant 
Marshal Roberts Post Office. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. LATURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I stand today in support of H.R. 1298, 
which would name a post office after 
Technical Sergeant Marshal Roberts. 
Sergeant Roberts was from Okla-
homa and enlisted in the Air Force in 
May 2014. He was assigned to the 219th 
Engineering Installation Squadron of 
the Oklahoma Air National Guard’s 
138th Fighter Wing. Sadly, he was 
killed in a rocket attack on Camp Taji 
in Iraq. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this 
bill honoring an American hero, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. LATURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentleman from Okla-
homa (Mr. HERN). 
Mr. HERN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in solemn memory of an Oklahoma 
hero, Technical Sergeant Marshal Rob-
erts. 
Sergeant Roberts had a strong love 
for his country and was intensely proud 
to serve in the Oklahoma Air National 
Guard. He was deployed to Camp Taji 
in Iraq in support of Operation Inher-
ent Resolve when his unit was engaged 
in enemy fire. 
Sergeant Roberts gave his life de-
fending our Nation and the freedoms 
we enjoy every day, leaving behind a 
proud wife and a loving daughter. Since 
his death, Oklahomans have shown 
overwhelming support for Sergeant 
Roberts’ family and have taken every 
opportunity to celebrate his memory. 
I will never forget when his remains 
were brought back to Tulsa in March 
2020, when the city had just begun 
lockdown. Still, there were hundreds 
and hundreds of Oklahomans waiting 
outside the airport to welcome him 
home and mourn with his family. 
At his funeral, at the dedication for 
the highway named after him, at our 
Memorial Day service, and at countless 
events since his death, Oklahomans 
have shown up in massive numbers to 
support and to honor his service and to 
thank his family. 
You see, Oklahomans recognize the 
importance of military service and the

sacred responsibility we all have to 
keep his legacy alive. 
We can rest in the knowledge that 
Sergeant Roberts’ sacrifice was not in 
vain. He laid down his life for hundreds 
of millions of Americans that he never 
knew and future generations yet to 
come. 
Mr. Speaker, renaming the Owasso 
Post Office in his honor is a small but 
meaningful gesture and ensures that 
our community proudly keeps his story 
alive for all the generations to come. 
Mr. LATURNER. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no further speakers. I am prepared to 
close. 
Mr. Speaker, I support this bill. I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, may the memory of Technical 
Sergeant Marshal D. Roberts be for a 
blessing. 
I urge all Members to support H.R. 
1298. I yield back the balance of my 
time.

question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.

The question was taken; and (two-

MOMENT OF SILENCE HONORING 
THE LIFE OF THE HONORABLE 
CLARENCE ‘‘BUD’’ BROWN, JR. 
(Mr. CHABOT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I rise this 
evening along with several of my Ohio 
colleagues to honor the life of a great 
Ohio Congressman, Clarence ‘‘Bud’’ 
Brown, Jr., who sadly passed away last 
Wednesday at the age of 94. 
Congressman Brown represented the 
people of Ohio’s Seventh District with 
great distinction from 1963 through 
1983. As ranking member of the House 
Energy and Power Subcommittee, Con-
gressman Brown crafted legislation to 
help his constituents and the American 
people overcome the 1970s energy cri-
sis. 
Congressman Brown hailed from an 
impressive Ohio family. His father rep-
resented the Seventh District for 27 
years in Congress. His son, Clarence 
‘‘Clancy’’ Brown, III, is an actor who 
has appeared in many movies, includ-
ing Shawshank Redemption, but is 
probably best known to American par-
ents as the voice of Mr. Krabs in 
SpongeBob SquarePants; and Congress-
man Brown’s nephew, Zac Haines, cur-
rently serves on Miami University of 
Ohio’s board of trustees. 
Mr. Speaker, I respectfully request 
that all Members keep Congressman 
Brown’s family and loved ones in their 
prayers as they mourn this profound 
loss. I would ask for a moment of si-
lence in his honor. 
f 
SCOOTER CHAPMAN IS 
LEGENDARY 
(Mr. KILMER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, the word 
‘‘legendary’’ gets thrown around in this 
place a fair amount, but back in my 
hometown of Port Angeles, Wash-
ington, we have had the opportunity to 
see a local legend in action for seven 
decades. 
Scooter Chapman has been the voice 
of Port Angeles sports for decades, 
working at radio KONP since the 1950s. 
He has been a sportscaster, a referee, 
an umpire, but he has been more than 
that. He has been someone who cared 
about young people and their success. 
He has been someone who built pride in 
our community, and for every PA High 
Roughrider, pride in his or her school. 
Back in 1992 I had the honor of pre-
senting him a letterman’s jacket on be-
half of our graduating class. In the dec-
ades since, he has racked up more hon-
ors, recognitions, and hall of fame en-
tries than you could possibly count. 
Now, 30 years later, I am honored to 
recognize Scooter Chapman from the 
floor of the United States House of 
Representatives, as he prepares to sign 
off from KONP and hang up his micro-
phone after 70 years at the station. 
Scooter Chapman has touched so 
many lives. He has made our commu-
nity stronger. Mr. Speaker, he is, in a 
word, legendary. 
f 
ISRAEL IS NOT AN APARTHEID 
STATE 
(Ms. FOXX asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, let me make 
one thing clear: Israel has never been 
and will never be an apartheid state. 
Amnesty International’s latest re-
port that labels Israel as an apartheid 
state is nothing short of an outright 
denial of the Jewish State’s right to 
exist. This report should be condemned 
immediately. It is the textbook defini-
tion of anti-Semitism. 
Instead of peddling these falsehoods 
and 
baseless 
allegations, 
Amnesty 
International would do well to focus on 
the human rights violations of the Chi-
nese Communist Party. 
America has stood side by side with 
Israel since its creation, and our shared 
values remain the keystone of our stra-
tegic partnership. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand 
with Israel and the Jewish community. 
They deserve our unwavering support. 
f 
ON-DEMAND TRANSIT IS 
TRANSFORMATIONAL 
(Mr. AUCHINCLOSS asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. AUCHINCLOSS. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to highlight how on-demand 
transit is a force multiplier for public 
transportation and a driver of lower 
costs in Massachusetts and across the 
Nation. 
For example, Via has partnered with 
the city of Newton in my district to 
provide an on-demand transit service 
called NewMo, which provides low-cost 
rideshares for all residents. During a 
recent ride-along, I saw firsthand the 
transformational power of on-demand 
transit, especially for youth, seniors, 
and people with disabilities, who gain 
autonomy from the ability to inde-
pendently access and safely connect to 
jobs and services. 
The Infrastructure Investment and 
Jobs Act will bring significant funding 
to the Bay State to modernize transit, 
including expanding on-demand tran-
sit. This innovation can increase eco-
nomic mobility, create new jobs, and 
reduce our carbon footprint. 
I look forward to working with the 
Biden administration to leverage the 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs 
Act 
to 
expand 
on-demand 
transit 
throughout Massachusetts and across 
the country.

CONGRATULATING FOREST COUN-
TY SHERIFF BOB WOLFGANG ON 
HIS RETIREMENT 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratu-
late Forest County Sheriff Bob Wolf-
gang on his retirement. 
Sheriff Wolfgang was first elected 
sheriff in 2001 and proceeded to spend 
two decades as the Forest County sher-
iff. In his work as sheriff, Bob aimed to 
engage the community and help people 
turn their lives around. 
During his five terms, Sheriff Wolf-
gang and his office worked to overhaul 
conceal carry permits, improve secu-
rity, and start several programs aimed 
to engage the county’s youth. 
From participating in ‘‘Shop with a 
Cop’’ to a Forest County Youth Field 
Day, Sheriff Wolfgang focused on work-
ing with children to improve relation-
ships with police and the community. 
He also spent time raising awareness 
for scams targeting senior citizens. 
Sheriff Wolfgang always focused on 
helping the community and being a 
positive role model for other officers 
and Forest County residents. His im-
pact on all of our community cannot be 
overstated. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Sheriff Wolf-
gang for his dedication and service to 
Forest County and the region. May he 
enjoy his retirement. He deserves it. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF PETE 
DUPRE 
(Mr. GOTTHEIMER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in memory of Pete DuPre. 
Pete, better known as Harmonica 
Pete around the world, was a true 
American hero, an advocate for vet-
erans and a constant inspiration to all 
those who were touched by his music. 
Spending time with him was a true 
honor that I will never forget, nor will 
my 12-year-old daughter, Ellie. She 
met him for the first time 4 years ago. 
They became pen pals and good friends. 
Pete recently passed at the age of 98. 
Pete served for 3 years overseas as a 
U.S. Army medic in some of the most 
important battles of World War II, in-
cluding the Battle of the Bulge, a true 
turning point in the war for Allied 
Forces. 
Pete returned home and continued to 
represent our Nation, traveling the 
globe, performing as an ambassador for 
the Greatest Generations Foundation. 
He earned his nickname by playing our 
national anthem on his harmonica at

Vikings stadium in front of tens of 
thousands of people, on the USS Ari-

As we mourn the loss of Harmonica

SENIOR CITIZENS WANT TO WORK 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to encourage the body to 
pass the Senior Independence Act. 
When I was back home over the last 
week, as I toured my businesses, wher-
ever I went—be it in agriculture, tour-
ism, transportation, manufacturing, or 
retail—businesses all had the same 
problem. They couldn’t find enough 
people to work. They suggested I look 
at a change in Social Security law. 
Social Security is great, but cur-
rently under Social Security law—and 
kind of a mistake that Franklin Roo-
sevelt made in the original way it was 
proposed—as soon as you make $19,500, 
you wind up losing a dollar for every 
additional $2 you earn. This is causing 
people who would like to work more to 
stop working because the tax rate is 
just too high. 
It is time to pass the Senior Inde-
pendence Act and move toward the 
point where you can make up to $30,000 
before they take away your money, al-
lowing more independence for our sen-
iors and more labor for our businesses.

AMERICA COMPETES ACT LEVELS 
THE PLAYING FIELD 
(Mr. MRVAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. MRVAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to express my profound apprecia-
tion that the House is expected to con-
sider this week H.R. 4521, the America 
COMPETES Act of 2022. 
Indiana’s First Congressional Dis-
trict is home to an incredible manufac-
turing, steel, and industrial workforce. 
These workers can compete with any-
one in the world. When they are pro-
vided with a level playing field, they 
can thrive in our global economy. 
I am pleased that the America COM-
PETES Act will take historic strides to 
defend the American worker, our man-
ufacturing base, and grow our econ-
omy. 
Together we can take action in this 
legislation to address supply chain vul-
nerabilities, increase the production of 
American-made semiconductors, and 
improve our ability to defend against 
illegally traded goods. 
I commend all the leaders for advanc-
ing this legislation, and I look forward 
to its prompt consideration on the 
House floor.

REMEMBERING VICTORIA SANDS 
DIXON 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
TORRES
of New York). Under the 
Speaker’s announced policy of January 
4, 2021, the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. RODNEY DAVIS) is recognized for 60 
minutes as the designee of the minor-
ity leader. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity 
to be here tonight. It is actually bitter-
sweet because we are here to honor a 
friend, a long-time friend to many, 
even to some sitting here in this insti-
tution because Vicki Dixon was an in-
stitution here in Washington, D.C.; not 
in a bad way, but in a way where she 
touched so many lives in such a posi-
tive manner. 
I am going to go ahead and save my 
comments about Vicki until later be-
cause we have got some friends that 
got to know Vicki over the years like 
I did, and got to not only become 
friends but just to see the wholesome, 
genuine, kind individual that Victoria 
Sands Dixon was. 
Her career was encapsulated by help-
ing so many people here in Congress 
get things done, and her passing is bit-
tersweet to all of us. 
One good friend of Vicki and a very 
good friend of mine is the ranking 
member on the Committee on Vet-
erans’ Affairs. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST). 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
good friend RODNEY DAVIS for yielding 
time to me and for organizing this Spe-
cial Order. 
Tonight you are going to hear several 
words from our colleagues that will 
echo the same resounding words, and, 
that is, Vicki Dixon should be recog-
nized for all that she did in her life. 
But most of all, she was kind. She was 
a friend. 
When the delegation got together, 
she was always there to welcome new-
comers to D.C. that she may have 
known from a time in Illinois. 
She dedicated her life to serving our 
country, which she loved deeply. In her 
30-plus years here in Washington, D.C., 
she worked for several Members of Con-
gress as well as seven Cabinet Secre-
taries. 
Vicki will be deeply missed by those 
of us who knew her, whether in Illinois, 
Washington, or Florida, where she just 
retired to in the fall. She left our Cap-
itol community and our Nation better 
off than it was before. She was loved. 
She will be missed tremendously. 
When the Illinois delegation got to-
gether over at the club, it was always 
amazing how quick she would come up 
to greet everyone, show friendship and 
kindness, give you some advice now 
and again on how to deal with this 
place, as crazy as it is at times. 
Both Tracy and I send our prayers to 
her mother, Peggy; her sister, Kristi; 
and all of her many nieces and neph-
ews; and we want to say a special 
thank you for how she has touched 
each one of our lives. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my good friend Mr. 
BOST for those heartfelt words. 
I now yield to the gentleman from Il-
linois (Mr. LAHOOD), another good 
friend of Vicki. 
Mr. LAHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I echo the 
comments of both Congressman BOST 
and Congressman DAVIS. It is bitter-
sweet to be here tonight to honor the 
life of Vicki Dixon, who was a friend to 
many in Illinois and here in Wash-
ington, D.C. 
Vicki passed away too early, but I 
am glad we have the opportunity to-
night to pay tribute to her wonderful 
career, her generosity, and her support 
of so many. 
I thank you, Congressman DAVIS, for 
organizing this Special Order. 
When you think about Vicki Dixon 
and her career, you can’t help but 
think about Illinois. She was a native 
of Shelbyville, Illinois. Vicki felt a call 
to service at a very young age. From 
1979 to 1989, Vicki worked for former Il-
linois Congressman Dan Crane and 
then 
went 
on 
to 
work 
for 
Mr. 
Derwinski at the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs before serving at the Inte-
rior Department until she retired in 
2016. She served many different Secre-
taries at the Department of the Inte-
rior. 
Vicki was a proud Illinois Repub-
lican, and she always supported the 
party back there and many of our can-
didates and elected officials. Vicki was 
integral in the development of some-
thing called the Lincoln Series. The 
Lincoln Series was a leadership pro-
gram for young Republican women in 
Illinois dedicated to increasing the 
number of young Republican women 
serving in government and political po-
sitions. That Lincoln Series would not 
have happened without Vicki Dixon. 
There are many people that grad-
uated from the Lincoln Series, so we 
owe a debt of gratitude to so many peo-
ple that Vicki helped touch by that 
program. It was just one of many 
things 
that 
Vicki 
did 
that 
was 
impactful on so many different folks. 
Vicki was known to many of us here 
in the Halls of Congress for her work 
specifically at the Department of the 
Interior and the Capitol Hill Club. 
Many of us got to know Vicki. Vicki 
was very involved with the Capitol Hill 
Club and many of our activities over 
there. Vicki was always kind and gen-
erous, had a smile on her face, and was 
willing to help. 
Vicki will be sorely missed by every-
one who knew her here in D.C. and, of 
course, back home in Illinois. My pray-
ers remain with Vicki’s family. May 
she rest in peace.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H327 
February 1, 2022 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank Congressman LAHOOD 
for those great words. I didn’t know she 
was one of the folks who started the 
Lincoln Series. That is great. 
That is a great program, and it 
makes me see the influence of Vicki 
Dixon even more. A lot of great people 
have gone through that program, and 
now I know why it is a great program— 
because of people like Vicki. 
Another good friend of Vicki Dixon— 
well, there is Vicki talking. I just 
knocked it down. She is like: Shush, 
stop saying so many nice thing about 
me. 
Another good friend of Vicki is her 
colleague from the State of Wash-
ington. You and your wife were very 
close to Vicki. I know, after her pass-
ing, we exchanged phone calls to try to 
find out what happened. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE, what is your wife’s 
name again? 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. You always have 
trouble with that. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. I do. 
Tell Joan I said hi. And it is now in the 
CONGRESSIONAL
RECORD
that I acted 
like I didn’t know her name. 
In all seriousness, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Washington 
(Mr. 
NEWHOUSE) to tell the American people 
about our friend Vicki. 
b 1930 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank Mr. DAVIS for yielding, and I 
thank him very much for organizing 
this Special Order honoring Vicki here 
on the House floor. It truly is some-
thing that she deserves because this in-
stitution of Congress, she held it in 
high regard, as you know. So it is an 
honor for me to be able to stand here 
and honor her and honor her life. I call 
her a friend, Victoria Lynn ‘‘Vicki’’ 
Sands Dixon. 
I only had the pleasure of knowing 
her, I think, for about the last 5 years, 
but I have to tell you, it soon became 
clear after meeting Vicki that she is 
one of those people that you could real-
ly call an angel on Earth. She treated 
her friends just like family, and hon-
estly, she would do anything for her 
friends. 
As you mentioned, Vicki was a really 
close friend of my wife, Joan—she is 
going to kill me for saying this—for 
over 42 years. In fact, Vicki was even 
the maid of honor at our wedding. That 
is how close she was to us. 
Vicki was considerate and thought-
ful, gracious and funny, generous to a 
fault, and always the first to lend a 
helping hand. I can’t tell you how 
many times Vicki, not even being 
asked, came to the rescue. 
One time, Joan and I had just moved 
into a new house in the middle of win-
ter, and the gas hadn’t been turned on 
yet. We couldn’t get the gas company 
to respond. Vicki, before the end of the 
night, when the house temperature got 
down into the 40s, we had no less than 
six little heaters trying to keep that 
house warm. That is the kind of person 
she was. Vicki was always there to 
help. 
I know you have heard from some of 
our friends tonight, and there are so 
many people that would agree with 
them that Vicki truly was a friend, but 
she was more than that, too. Vicki was 
a dedicated American. Vicki was faith-
ful to her country, certainly proud of 
her party, proud of her home State of 
Illinois, and, as you heard, a devoted 
public servant. 
It truly is a loss as we lose Vicki, but 
if there is anyone that I can think of, 
anyone worthy of moving on to a bet-
ter place, it is her. Vicki was an exam-
ple of the engaged and selfless citizen 
that we really all should try to emu-
late. 
I know Vicki’s family and her com-
munity continue to be blessed by her 
memory. May Vicki rest in peace with 
her beloved Bob Michel. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I encourage the gentleman to 
feel free to stick around if any other 
thoughts on Vicki’s life come to mind 
to make sure we let the world know. 
Mr. Speaker, I do want to share a 
note I got from people who were very 
close to Vicki, and this epitomizes the 
influence Vicki had on so many here. I 
think this note speaks for so many peo-
ple. It says: ‘‘I am still devastated, just 
like everyone who knew her. Wow.’’ 
You can look around this city, you 
can look around this Capitol, and you 
can see what Vicki Dixon meant. It 
didn’t matter if you were a Republican 
or a Democrat. She worked for both ad-
ministrations. This is the person who 
was able to help navigate people in the 
right direction to get things done. 
Vicki is the perfect example of a ca-
reer public servant who did not work 
for the public attention but for the 
sake of our country. Vicki loved the 
United States of America. 
Through Vicki’s kindness and profes-
sionalism, she won the hearts of many, 
from the highest positions here in 
Washington to the humblest positions 
here in Washington. I hope that when 
we all leave, we can say the same 
thing, 
that 
our 
best 
friends 
just 
weren’t those who walked into the best 
offices in this complex, but that our 
best friends were those who made sure 
the lights worked in these offices, that 
our friends were those who make Wash-
ington work for all of us just like Vicki 
Dixon did. 
One of my favorite memories of Vicki 
is actually getting to meet her. It was 
with my great friend, my former boss, 
former chief of staff Craig Roberts. He 
introduced me to her. Then I got re-
introduced to Vicki by my former col-
league, my mentor, and my friend and 
former boss, Congressman Shimkus. 
That brings up a great memory that 
I have of Vicki and Leader Michel, sit-
ting right behind home plate. I could 
tell that the game was going well be-
cause Vicki was very much smiles 
when I would chase a passed ball back 
to the backstop. If the game wasn’t 
going well, she probably wouldn’t look 
at me while I was going back, making 
another error maybe, possibly, and, 
yes, historically. 
But I can remember Vicki sitting 
there with Leader Michel in a Cubs jer-
sey. I am from Illinois. I am not a Cubs 
fan, and neither was John Shimkus. He 
was a much more rabid fan of the Car-
dinals than many. Vicki Dixon was the 
only one that could wear a Cubs jersey 
around Congressman John Shimkus be-
cause she was Vicki Dixon. 
From 1989 until her retirement in 
2016, Vicki served Secretaries of the In-
terior, as I mentioned earlier, under 
both Republicans and Democrats. That 
is where I got a chance to see what she 
meant to people. 
The constituents I used to work for 
when I worked for Congressman John 
Shimkus got VIP tours of the monu-
ments because Vicki Dixon realized 
that when constituents come to Wash-
ington, they want to see their Nation’s 
Capital. She did everything she could 
to make that happen, so much so that 
when I became a Member of Congress, 
she continued to help us allow our con-
stituents to see the monuments under 
her direction at the Department of the 
Interior. 
I remember a good friend of hers that 
used to work with her at the Depart-
ment of the Interior under President 
Bush. I have exchanged texts with Lori 
Yates, my good friend, over the last 
few weeks upon Vicki’s passing. 
Lori, Vicki knew you were a great 
friend, too. She knew that that friend-
ship mattered. And understand that 
Vicki is in a better place. Vicki is with 
her friends and those she loved the 
most in a place where there is no pain. 
But in a place like Washington, D.C., 
she will be missed. 
Vicki worked for the Office of the 
Secretary and the Bureau of Land Man-
agement as an expert in external af-
fairs. Before Interior, she worked for 
Congressman Dan Crane. She also 
worked for Veterans Affairs Secretary 
Ed Derwinski. 
As my colleagues mentioned, Vicki is 
a native of Shelbyville, Illinois. Vicki 
attended 
Lake 
Land 
College 
in 
Mattoon. 
I can remember one day my wife and 
I were driving around our hometown of 
Taylorville, and we just so happened to 
drive by Vicki’s mom’s house because 
Vicki’s mom, Peggy, lived in my home-
town for some time. And who do I see 
standing out in the driveway of her 
mom’s house in Taylorville, Illinois, 
but Vicki Dixon? Of course, Vicki 
flagged us down, and we stopped. 
I got to know her mom even after 
that meeting. I know her mother, 
Peggy, is devastated by her loss. 
Vicki moved from D.C. to Naples, 
where she again quickly made new 
friends. But on January 8, it is one of 
those days where you exchange phone 
calls with colleagues and friends, and 
you hate to have that discussion, but 
just so everybody knows, Vicki passed 
peacefully in her sleep unexpectedly in 
Naples.

February 1, 2022 
I can’t tell you how devastated we all 
are to know that Vicki is not going to 
be able to enjoy that house, that time 
that she wanted to enjoy in Naples. But 
Vicki lived one of the fullest lives I 
think we could ever wish for. 
Vicki’s mom, Peggy, and her family 
are devastated, and we know that. I 
hope you know that our prayers are 
with them all. I would urge anyone 
watching tonight to say a quick prayer 
for Vicki’s mom and Vicki’s family. 
But Vicki is resting in peace. Vicki is 
again in a place experiencing no pain, 
and I believe there is a God that allows 
her to be able to experience that peace 
with those she loved the most. 
Vicki, we know you are resting in 
peace, but D.C. is not resting with you 
right now. D.C. is honoring you to-
night. 
There is not a person that I think de-
serves more than Victoria Sands Dixon 
to be honored by an institution that 
she loved so much. 
God bless Vicki and her memory and 
those who knew her, and let’s all use 
Vicki as an example. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
SUPREME COURT NOMINATIONS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, since 
the time John Jay was inaugurated as 
the first Chief Justice, only 115 individ-
uals have been chosen to sit on the 
U.S. Supreme Court. Out of these 115 
Justices, only 5—only 5—have been 
women. Only two—only two—have been 
African 
Americans. 
Only 
one—just 
one—has been Hispanic. And to date, 
never—never—has 
an 
African-Amer-
ican woman sat on the highest Court in 
the land. 
Soon, President Biden will have an 
opportunity to make the Supreme 
Court look more like America by nomi-
nating the first Black woman in U.S. 
history to serve as a Justice. Every 
single Member of this Chamber, regard-
less of party, should embrace the Presi-
dent’s commitment to make sure that 
our courts—and especially the Supreme 
Court—better reflect our country’s di-
versity, 
and 
nominating 
a 
Black 
woman as Justice is a long overdue 
step toward achieving that goal. 
Past Presidents, from Eisenhower to 
Johnson to Reagan, were clear about 
their intentions of nominating historic 
and barrier-breaking individuals to the 
Supreme Court. President Biden’s com-
mitment to nominate a Black woman 
is a continuation of that important ef-
fort. 
And once President Biden announces 
his nominee, I intend to have the Sen-
ate move quickly so we can fulfill our 
constitutional duty to advise and con-
sent 
and, 
ultimately, 
confirm 
the 
President’s pick. We will have a fair 
process but also a quick process so that 
the work of the Supreme Court con-
tinues uninterrupted. 
If our democracy is to prosper in the 
21st century, the American people 
must have confidence that our Federal 
courts will faithfully adhere to the sol-
emn principle of ‘‘equal justice under 
law.’’ The more our judges reflect our 
Nation’s vibrancy and rich diversity, 
the more effectively they will be able 
to administer equal justice. 
And make no mistake, a more bal-
anced, more diverse judiciary has been 
one of the Senate Democrats’ top pri-
ority in our work with the Biden ad-
ministration. Over the past year, we 
have worked at a record pace to con-
firm the most judicial nominees in the 
President’s first year since the time of 
Ronald Reagan, and we have done it 
with nominees who bring diversity in 
their backgrounds, their life experi-
ences, 
and 
professional 
expertise— 
something that didn’t happen, really, 
in a large way until this year.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S422 
February 1, 2022 
One day, I hope the barrier-breakers 
of today will be closer to the norm of 
tomorrow. We want more women to sit 
on our courts, especially the Supreme 
Court. We need more people of color, 
more 
public 
defenders, 
more 
civil 
rights lawyers, more children of immi-
grants to sit on our courts to reflect 
the broad diversity that America is and 
will continue to be. In fact, it will con-
tinue to grow. 
The more Americans look at our 
courts and see people who look like 
them and come from the same back-
grounds and share similar experiences, 
the better off our justice system and 
our democracy shall be. And nowhere 
else is this more important than the 
Supreme Court. 
So I applaud the President’s commit-
ment to choosing a qualified and his-
toric nominee, and the Senate stands 
ready to work quickly to confirm 
President Biden’s pick when we get it. 
ECONOMIC GROWTH 
Mr. President, on economics and eco-
nomic wins, at the beginning of last 
year, the CBO projected that the U.S. 
economy would reach a growth rate of 
about 3.5 percent by the end of 2021. 
The International Monetary Fund had 
a rosier outlook. They said economic 
growth could be closer to 4 percent. 
The Federal Open Market Committee 
was perhaps the most optimistic, fore-
casting a growth rate of about 4.3 per-
cent. 
They were all wrong. The U.S. econ-
omy shattered most expectations and 
grew at the amazing rate of 5.7 percent, 
the strongest rate since the time of 
Ronald Reagan. This was no accident, 
far from it. Last year’s historic turn-
around is a reminder that the right 
leadership 
in 
government 
matters. 
Democrats promised in 2020 to fix Don-
ald Trump’s utter mismanagement of 
the COVID crisis and get our country 
back on track. And, a year later, after 
securing the strongest growth rate in 
decades, Democrats are delivering on 
that promise. 
After Congress passed the American 
Rescue Plan, I said: ‘‘Help is on the 
way.’’ And that help is getting America 
back on a path to normal. Though we 
are still learning to live with the virus, 
our economy, our communities, and 
our schools are better off because of 
vaccines, because of testing, and be-
cause of targeted legislation we passed 
last year, like the RESTAURANTS Act 
and Save Our Stages. 
I want to stress an important point 
that is forgotten too often. We are fi-
nally seeing wages go up at a signifi-
cant rate. That is dollars in the work-
ing people’s pockets. 
For decades, economists have decried 
the lack of wage growth in America. It 
has been reported that from 2000 to 
2020, if you were in the bottom 75 per-
cent of Americans—the majority—your 
wage growth was not real at all. In 
other words, costs ate up all of the 
wage growth, and the wage growth was 
paltry, in many years: 0 percent, 1 per-
cent, declining in some. Lack of wage 
growth has been the scourge of our 
economy for so long, as it affects aver-
age working folks, closing off opportu-
nities for millions of hard-working peo-
ple who have worked harder and harder 
only to see their lives deteriorate. 
Now we are finally seeing signs that 
wages are going up, and that is going 
to stay for years to come. This is real 
progress for working families. As we 
keep fighting to lower costs, we Demo-
crats are going to do everything we can 
to see that this large wage growth re-
mains and continues, and that will 
mean better lives for the American 
people. 
We know the work is not done. We 
know we must keep working to help 
Americans lower costs so they can bet-
ter afford the basics, from healthcare 
and prescription drugs to daily essen-
tials like groceries, to the costs of 
higher 
education. 
Addressing 
these 
issues remains our focus. 
We also must address strained and 
broken supply chains. Later this week, 
the House will take up the long-await-
ed USICA bill by passing a companion, 
the America COMPETES Act. I have 
been working very hard to make sure 
that this happens. Once conferenced, 
this legislation would bring manufac-
turing back to America instead of 
sending jobs overseas. This bill will 
say: ‘‘Buy America’’; keep the jobs 
here. 
We saw what just happened in Ohio 
in the advent: thousands and thousands 
of new jobs in manufacturing. So this 
legislation is going to bring manufac-
turing back to America, bring jobs over 
here, good-paying jobs back here. 
It would strengthen domestic supply 
chains and, thus, reduce our costs and, 
in particular, help our country address 
its semiconductor shortage, a driver of 
rising costs in so many different 
things, from cars to cell phones to ev-
erything. 
Finally, all this is a reminder of what 
Democrats at our core stand for: build-
ing ladders of opportunity for working 
Americans to get to the middle class 
and provide stability to those already 
in the middle class so they can stay 
there and thrive. And wages going up is 
a large part of that. And this adminis-
tration’s record on wage increases, we 
haven’t seen in decades. 
We still have more work to do to 
bring our country out of the rubble of 
COVID so that we can look confidently 
into the future. But the growth of last 
year showed we are well on our way, 
and Democrats will keep working to 
help working people—working families, 
middle-class families, poorer families 
trying to get to the middle class—have 
the kind of prosperity and help they 
need and deserve. 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. 
President, 
Senate 
business: 
approps and on nominations. On a sepa-
rate matter, we Senate Democrats will 
continue to work with our Republican 
and House counterparts on the vital 
task of passing an omnibus package to 
fund the Federal Government, avoid a 
shutdown, and ensure government ef-
fectively serves the American people. 
This morning, I will meet with 
Democratic appropriators to discuss 
the state of negotiations as we work 
toward the omnibus. I will be meeting 
with Speaker PELOSI in that meeting, 
as well. Later today, the four-corners 
appropriators—Chairman 
LEAHY, 
Ranking Member SHELBY, Chairwoman 
DELAURO, 
and 
Ranking 
Member 
GRANGER—will also meet to continue 
their talks. We need to have an omni-
bus to fund the government. That is 
the goal we are working toward, and I 
want to thank my colleagues for their 
diligence and their leadership. 
Separately, of course, today the Sen-
ate will continue confirming the Presi-
dent’s highly qualified nominees. Be-
cause of a growing backlog of non-
controversial nominees, which a small 
handful of Republicans continue to ob-
struct, I filed cloture 2 weeks ago to 
move forward on 20 individuals. Today, 
we will have votes on three of these 
nominees. We are prepared to work late 
into the evenings this week to get 
these nominees confirmed without fur-
ther delay. 
Confirming these nominees is a top 
priority for the Senate this week. They 
will serve on our Federal judiciary, ad-
vance America’s diplomatic and eco-
nomic interests, and work to strength-
en our national security. The vast ma-
jority of these men and women were re-
ported out of committee with strong 
bipartisan support and normally would 
pass through this Chamber with con-
sent, without a lengthy process. In-
stead, because of a handle of obstruc-
tionist Republicans, the Senate will 
take the necessary votes to confirm 
these nominees. 
Every President deserves to staff 
their team with the individuals that 
the President sees fit, and we in the 
Senate will keep working to make sure 
President Biden has his nominees con-
firmed so they can carry out their mis-
sion serving the American people. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Republican leader is recognized. 
THE ECONOMY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Working Ameri-
cans and their families are being ham-
mered by the worst inflation in 40 
years, and Washington Democrats own 
it. Sometimes it can be difficult to di-
rectly connect Washington policies to 
the downstream effects on our families. 
Sometimes it can be tricky to identify 
cause and effect. But not this time— 
not in this case. 
The pain that families are feeling 
today was not just foreseeable, it was

actually foreseen by experts all across 
the political spectrum. 
Economists said this inflation is ex-
actly—exactly—what would happen if 
Democrats pushed ahead with their 
reckless spending sprees that the econ-
omy simply did not need. 
Larry Summers, who was Treasury 
Secretary for President Clinton and 
ran the National Economic Council for 
President Obama, warned Democrats a 
year ago this week that Democrats far- 
left plans could trigger ‘‘inflationary 
pressures of a kind we have not seen in 
a generation.’’ 
Jason Furman, who chaired Presi-
dent Obama’s Council of Economic Ad-
visers, said the very same thing. He 
said the Democrat’s spending binge was 
‘‘definitely too big for the moment. I 
don’t know any economist that was 
recommending something the size of 
what 
was 
done.’’ 
That 
is 
Jason 
Furman, President Obama’s Council of 
Economic Advisers. 
But our Democratic colleagues did 
not let families’ actual needs restrain 
their radical daydreaming. They had 
already made up their minds. This tem-
porary pandemic was to serve as a Tro-
jan horse for permanent socialism. 
Remember, right from the start, in 
March of 2020, with Americans dying 
from this new, mysterious virus, a top 
House Democrat called it ‘‘a tremen-
dous opportunity to restructure things 
to fit our vision.’’ 
So the new Democratic Party govern-
ment’s first major act was to start 
printing, 
borrowing, 
and 
spending 
money like there was no tomorrow. 
They managed to blow through roughly 
$2 trillion on a so-called COVID bill 
that utterly failed to crush the virus. 
Less than 9 percent of the money went 
to the healthcare fight at all. Even the 
liberal expert, Steve Rattner, a former 
Obama official, said the spending spree 
was Democrats’ ‘‘original sin’’ when it 
comes to inflation. 
And working Americans are paying 
dearly for it every single day. Just 
look at the headlines: 
2021 went down as the worst year for infla-
tion since 1982. 
Higher prices seeped into just about every-
thing households and businesses buy. 
There’s no telling when prices will fall to 
more sustainable levels. 
Further quotes: 
[R]ising costs for food . . . rent and other 
necessities are heightening the financial 
pressures on America’s households. 
Rising prices have wiped out the healthy 
pay increases that many Americans have 
been receiving, making it harder for house-
holds, especially lower-income families, to 
afford basic expenses. 
Yes, it is true that inflation is up all 
around the world. This is partially a 
global phenomenon. But the United 
States has it worse—worse—than al-
most everyone else. 
Data from Pew show that America’s 
inflationary spike has been the third 
worst among all countries they meas-
ure. We have it worse than any other 
country in the G12—much worse infla-
tion than the UK or France or Aus-
tralia or Japan. That is what this agen-
da has bought us. 
And Americans are afraid this may 
still just be the beginning. Seventy- 
nine percent of Americans now expect 
inflation will get even worse over the 
next 6 months. Now the Democratic- 
caused inflation has the Federal Re-
serve signaling they may need to raise 
interest rates higher and faster than 
they had expected. 
This brings its own set of risks upon 
the American people, and, again, it is 
exactly—exactly—what 
experts 
pre-
dicted. 
A full year ago this week, the econo-
mist, Michael Strain, testified that 
Democrats’ spending could corner the 
Fed and force them to clamp down on 
the recovery sooner than necessary. 
Democrats had mainstream economic 
experts warning against their reckless 
spending plans and still decided to 
drive right over the cliff. 
Working families are paying the 
price 
every 
day—at 
the 
checkout 
counter, at the gas pump, at the used 
car lot, when they pay their bills, when 
they look for housing. And now Wash-
ington Democrats are trying again to 
revive talk of yet another—another— 
reckless bout of spending this year. 
American families are already hurt-
ing enough. They need that bad idea to 
stay buried. 
BURMA 
Mr. President, on an entirely dif-
ferent matter, today marks 1 year 
since the people of Burma yet again 
had their future hijacked by a military 
coup. Since this time last year, the 
Tatmadaw—which is what they call the 
Burmese 
military—has 
tried 
to 
achieve, through open repression and 
violence, 
what 
it 
long 
sought 
to 
achieve from the shadows. They want 
to derail Burma’s democracy. 
The ruling generals now have the 
blood of thousands of protesters and in-
nocent civilians on their hands. Thou-
sands more are languishing in prison 
on political charges. 
Those detained include my friend 
Aung San Suu Kyi. They have also in-
cluded a number of foreigners like the 
American journalists Nathan Maung 
and Danny Fenster. The Australian 
economist Sean Turnell remains un-
justly imprisoned for now. Even one 
political prisoner would be one too 
many. 
The Tatmadaw’s violence in the 
streets and its desecration of justice in 
sham courts have been a sad step back-
ward for Burma. Unfortunately, it is a 
step that many of us who pay close at-
tention to this country have feared. 
But 1 year ago—1 year on—it is en-
couraging to see the people of Burma 
rejecting one of the oppressors’ favor-
ite cynical tactics, and that cynical 
tactic is to try to stoke resentment 
and violence between diverse ethnic 
groups. 
Well, Burma’s ethnic groups are no 
longer buying that. They see the com-
mon enemy that denies them their 
freedom. Millions of people across 
Burma are rallying together behind the 
representative National Unity Govern-
ment. 
They are swelling the ranks of the 
National Unity Consultative Council in 
what can rightly be described as a rev-
olution. But their bravery and unity 
may yield little without greater inter-
national assistance. 
A year ago, I called on the Biden ad-
ministration to impose costs on those 
who stand in the way of the people of 
Burma and urged our partners to do 
the same. Along with many in the Bur-
mese diaspora communities that call 
Kentucky home, I was encouraged by 
President Biden’s quick condemnation 
of the coup, the sanctions against two 
of the junta’s main funding sources, 
and efforts to target individual coup 
leaders. 
But, regrettably, these well-inten-
tioned efforts have not been enough. 
There is more the Biden administra-
tion must do, and there is more that 
must be done by our democratic part-
ners out in the region. The administra-
tion should be prioritizing Burma in its 
diplomacy throughout Asia, especially 
India. 
Along with our partners, the United 
States should expand sanctions to fur-
ther isolate the military and security 
forces. We should move to expose coun-
tries like Russia and China that aid 
and abet the repression of the people of 
Burma. 
We must push back on Cambodia, 
which chairs the Association of South-
east Asian Nations, and indicates they 
may welcome—actually welcome—the 
illegitimate regime to international 
summits. 
The United States and our partners 
should also provide more direct help to 
the representative institutions that are 
trying to protect the people of that 
country. This should include direct, 
cross-border, humanitarian assistance 
that bypasses the Tatmadaw, institu-
tional support, and capacity building 
for the NUG and the NUCC. 
Look, the international stakes go be-
yond Burma itself. The Tatmadaw 
aren’t the only ones who benefit from 
chaos and injustice reigning in Burma. 
The 
Chinese 
Communist 
Party 
loathes—literally loathes—the idea of a 
functioning democracy in its own back-
yard. They have been working for years 
to keep Burma weak and subservient to 
Beijing. And Russia has found a happy 
customer in the Tatmadaw for surplus 
arms. 
So, 1 year on, the people of Burma 
are paying close attention. From pris-
on, from exile, from the streets of its 
cities, they are watching to see which 
friends of democracy have their backs. 
They are watching which champions of 
human rights remember the political 
prisoners whom the junta has jailed 
and the innocent men, women, and 
children it has murdered. 
I have been proud to support the peo-
ple of Burma on their long journey to-
ward self-government. I have been 
proud to help ensure their struggles are 
not forgotten.

America and our partners need to 
pass this crucial test. We must leave no 
room for doubt about our commitment 
to democracy in Burma. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-

dered. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, we re-
cently passed the 1-year anniversary of 
President Biden’s inauguration. It is a 
natural time for taking stock of the 
first year of his Presidency. 
In President Biden, we were supposed 
to get a leader—a leader at home and 
on the world stage. The grownups, we 
were told, were back in the room. But 
the truth of the matter is that Presi-
dent Biden’s first year in office has 
been marked by a lack of leadership 
more than anything else. 
Again and again, President Biden has 
simply abdicated his responsibilities. 
Take perhaps the two defining domes-
tic crises of the Biden Presidency: our 
inflation crisis and our border crisis. In 
both cases, the response of the Presi-
dent and his administration has by and 
large been to stick their fingers in 
their ears and pretend the crises don’t 
exist. Sure, the President or his people 
make a gesture toward the problem 
every now and then, but mostly, you 
would be forgiven for thinking that 
neither the border crisis nor the infla-
tion crisis was even on the President’s 
radar. 
Migrants continue to pour across our 
southern border in massive numbers, 
creating a humanitarian, enforcement, 
and security nightmare. And the Presi-
dent? Well, he appears to believe that if 
he ignores the problem long enough, it 
will go away. When he does talk about 
immigration, it amounts to a green 
light to the cartels and traffickers to 
keep leading migrants to our borders. 
That is why I recently joined more 
than 100 lawmakers in requesting that 
the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity’s inspector general investigate the 
Biden administration’s border failures. 
Between the President’s rhetoric and 
his failure to take any meaningful ac-
tion to address the influx of illegal im-
migration, it is no surprise that we saw 
more than half a million attempts to 
cross our southern border illegally in 
the current fiscal year’s first 3 months 
alone—half a million. 
Meanwhile, American families are 
struggling with the worst inflation in 
40 years—40 years. The last time infla-
tion was this bad, ‘‘E.T.’’ was just 
premiering, and ‘‘Return of the Jedi’’ 
hadn’t even come out yet. American 
families are struggling with huge in-
creases in the price of the most basic 
necessities, from food to fuel. And the 
administration’s 
response? 
Mostly 
crickets. 
Of course, President Biden hasn’t 
just been largely ignoring this crisis; 
he actually helped create it. The so- 
called American Rescue Plan Act the 
Democrats passed and the President 
signed into law in March of last year 
helped produce the sky-high inflation 
we are experiencing. But instead of ad-
dressing the resulting crisis, the Presi-
dent has been focused on passing an-
other massive government spending 
bill that would almost undoubtedly 
worsen our inflation problem. Yes, his 
solution to our inflation crisis is to 
double down on the strategy that 
helped produce so much inflation in the 
first place. 
Meanwhile, Americans are wondering 
if their paychecks will stretch to afford 
the sharp increases at the grocery 
store and in gas prices, utility bills, 
household commodities, and the list 
goes on. 
On the world stage, of course, the de-
fining moment of President Biden’s 
first year was his disastrous with-
drawal from Afghanistan. The Presi-
dent’s arbitrary, chaotic withdrawal 
was a real low point for our country. 
Thirteen of our military men and 
women died in a terrorist attack dur-
ing the evacuation from Kabul. We 
abandoned thousands of individuals 
who had worked with us in Afghanistan 
and whom we had promised to protect 
and left behind hundreds of American 
citizens. The President, who was sup-
posed to restore our standing on the 
world stage, left our allies wondering if 
our word could be relied on, not to 
mention the fact that the disastrous 
withdrawal left our country in a more 
precarious national security position. 
Meanwhile, the President’s recent 
press conference left serious questions 
as to how well he is likely to handle 
another pressing national security, and 
that is the issue in Ukraine. Casually 
dismissing a possible ‘‘minor incur-
sion’’ into Ukraine’s sovereign terri-
tory did not inspire confidence in the 
President’s ability to stand up to Rus-
sia. 
We can’t afford missteps and walk 
backs. Putin is looking to test America 
and NATO’s resolve, looking for any 
hesitation or division. I hope the Presi-
dent and the majority party will take 
seriously the threat to Ukraine, utilize 
any remaining levers of American in-
fluence to deter a renewed attack, and, 
if Putin proceeds, make him imme-
diately realize it was a miscalculation. 
Perhaps the biggest thing the Presi-
dent was going to do—the most impor-
tant way he was going to be a leader— 
was to pull our country together. That 
was the defining theme of President 
Biden’s inaugural address. 
I quote: 
Today, on this January day, my whole soul 
is in this: Bringing America together. Unit-
ing our people. And uniting our nation. 
Contrast that speech with the speech 
that book-ended the other end of his 
first year, his speech in Georgia on 
election legislation. We went from a 
President who wanted to unite our Na-
tion to a President who refers to his 
political opponents as enemies. 
‘‘We can see each other not as adver-
saries but as neighbors,’’ the President 
said in his inaugural address. ‘‘We can 
treat each other with dignity and re-
spect.’’ In his Georgia speech, by con-
trast, the President’s political oppo-
nents became not only adversaries but 
enemies and racists, all for the crime 
of disagreeing with the President’s vi-
sion of election reform. 
The President’s complete condemna-
tion of half the country was striking. I 
lost track of the number of people he 
implied were racist. The President as-
sumed bad faith on the part of those 
who disagree with him. Missing from 
his speech was any shred of recognition 
that perhaps Americans of good will 
can disagree on election legislation. 
No, if you disagree with the President, 
you are a racist. Like Hillary Clinton 
before him, it is clear that President 
Biden conceives of a large portion of 
the American people as deplorables. 
The President repeatedly referred to 
justice in his Georgia speech. Perhaps 
he should consider the profound injus-
tice of baselessly suggesting half the 
country is racist. 
In his inaugural address, the Presi-
dent said, ‘‘We must reject a culture in 
which facts themselves are manipu-
lated and even manufactured.’’ I have 
been profoundly disappointed to see the 
President and many of my Democrat 
colleagues manipulate the facts about 
State election bills to support their de-
sire for a Federal takeover of elections. 
Manipulated facts were a hallmark of 
the President’s speech in Georgia, as he 
tried to twist a mainstream election 
law into Jim Crow 2.0. His attempts 
were particularly ironic given that the 
State he was complaining about offers 
greater opportunities to vote than are 
offered by the President’s home State 
of Delaware. 
Days later, at a press conference 
marking his first year in office, the 
President laid the groundwork for fu-
ture division and disunity by sug-
gesting that the 2022 elections could be 
illegitimate if Democrats’ election leg-
islation doesn’t get passed; that is, I 
assume, if Democrats don’t win. It was 
yet another profoundly disappointing 
remark from a President who was sup-
posed to take the lead in bringing this 
country together. 
One year into the Biden Presidency, 
it has become clear that the President 
of the inaugural address—the President 
whose whole soul was committed to 
uniting our Nation—has long ago dis-
appeared. The President has not only 
failed to unite the country, but, as his 
ugly and divisive speech in Georgia 
made clear, he has come to regard any-
one who opposes his policies with ac-
tive hostility and contempt. 
Just 1 year—1 year—after dedicating 
himself to uniting our country, the 
President is dividing Americans into 
supporters and enemies. ‘‘We must end 
this uncivil war that pits red against 
blue, rural versus urban, conservative

versus liberal,’’ the President said in 
his inaugural address. It is too bad the 
President’s actions have not matched 
his words. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PADILLA). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
UKRAINE DEMOCRACY DEFENSE LEND-LEASE ACT 
OF 2022 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the 
former leader of the Soviet Union, 
Vladimir Lenin, once said: 
You probe with bayonets: If you find mush, 
you push. If you find steel, you withdraw. 
Well, apparently, the current Russian 
President subscribes to this same point 
of view. President Putin has made no 
secret of his desire to restore the 
former Soviet Union. In 2005, he de-
clared: 
The [demise] of the Soviet Union was the 
greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the cen-
tury. 
‘‘The [demise] of the Soviet Union 
was the greatest geopolitical catas-
trophe of the century,’’ he said in 2005. 
He went on to say: 
As for the Russian people, it became a gen-
uine tragedy. Tens of millions of our fellow 
citizens and countrymen found themselves 
beyond the fringes of Russian territory. 
So perhaps we should not have been 
surprised when, in 2008, Russia invaded 
Georgia—that is, the country of Geor-
gia. Then, when it came to a global re-
sponse, the Russian President found 
mush, so he pushed. In 2014, Russia in-
vaded Ukraine for the first time since 
the end of the Cold War, taking its Cri-
mea region. Once again, President 
Putin found mush, so he pushed. 
Today, more than 100,000 Russian 
troops are massed along the Ukrainian 
border. An invasion could happen at 
any moment. This impending crisis 
raises a fundamental question for the 
freedom-loving countries of the world: 
Will President Putin be met with mush 
or steel? Will the anticipated cost of an 
invasion in terms of blood, treasure, 
and reputation become so high that he 
backs down or will a muted global re-
sponse encourage his lust for empire? 
In times like these, the civilized 
world looks to the United States for 
leadership. Ours may no longer be a 
unipolar world, with the rise of China 
and the dreams of empire of the Rus-
sian Federation, but our country re-
mains a beacon of freedom, strength, 
and democracy that serves as an exam-
ple for the rest of the world. 
So the question the world is asking 
is, Will America still lead? Will we ac-
cept our responsibilities under treaties 
like that of the North Atlantic Treaty, 
which formed NATO, the North Atlan-
tic Treaty Organization? To be sure, 
Ukraine is not yet a member of NATO, 
but will we and the other members 
allow Putin to dictate membership in 
the multilateral, rules-based order rep-
resented by NATO by threats and 
force? Will we aid a democracy like 
Ukraine in its self-defense? These are 
questions that lie before us, and so far, 
the Biden administration’s response 
has been less than reassuring. 
Last year, the administration waived 
sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 Pipe-
line, giving Russia the green light to 
continue its monopoly on the energy 
supply to Europe along with its ability, 
because 
of 
that 
monopoly, 
to 
weaponize energy to an even greater 
extent. 
The administration’s response led to 
a poorly planned and even more poorly 
executed 
exodus 
from 
Afghanistan, 
leaving Afghans vulnerable and at the 
mercy of the Taliban and leaving our 
friends and allies around the world 
aghast at the manner in which that 
exit occurred. 
Then, a couple of weeks ago, Presi-
dent Biden suggested that minor incur-
sions—minor 
incursions—by 
Russia 
into Ukraine may be tolerated—a line 
that he would later, thankfully, walk 
back. 
President Biden has given our allies 
multiple reasons to doubt the resolve 
and credibility of the United States as 
that leader of the free world. Whether 
out of naivete or idealism or just error 
of judgment, it doesn’t change the fact 
that President Biden has repeatedly 
projected a lack of decisiveness and 
weakness, and Putin, you had better 
believe, has taken notice. 
As it stands today, the international 
response to Russian aggression is dis-
jointed 
and 
disorganized 
at 
best. 
France is all in on diplomacy. The 
United Kingdom is offering clear but 
limited military assistance. Germany, 
unfortunately, seems to support ap-
peasement. The United States and the 
rest of the world are waiting for Presi-
dent Biden to step up to the challenge. 
I believe we have a responsibility to 
stand with Ukraine and help its people 
defend its sovereignty and its democ-
racy. Now, that doesn’t mean having 
American troops on the ground, but 
there are other ways we can help 
Ukraine defend itself and raise the 
costs of a threatened Russian invasion 
into their country. Forceful language 
and threats of sanctions may be impor-
tant, but they are clearly not enough. 
We need to take concrete steps to mini-
mize the likelihood of a Russian attack 
and ensure that Ukraine, as I said, has 
the resources they need in order to de-
fend themselves in the event of an in-
vasion. 
There is a historical parallel. During 
World War II, President Roosevelt rec-
ognized how critical it was for the 
United States to support Great Britain 
even at a time when the American peo-
ple were isolationists and when Amer-
ica’s official policy was neutrality to-
ward the war in Europe. President Roo-
sevelt recognized it was important to 
do what we could to support Great 
Britain during its hour of need, when it 
was literally hanging on by a thread, 
because it lacked the resources it need-
ed to protect its people and fend off 
German forces. So President Roosevelt 
vowed to transform the United States 
into what he called the arsenal of de-
mocracy and worked with Congress to 
devise a creative solution that later be-
came known as the Lend-Lease Act. 
This legislation, signed into law in 
March of 1941, allowed the United 
States to supply our allies with weap-
ons, ships, aircraft—any materiel they 
needed in order to mount their defense 
at a critical time in the war in Europe. 
Later that year, Winston Churchill, 
the Prime Minister, said the bill ‘‘must 
be regarded without question as the 
most unsordid act in the whole of re-
corded history.’’ Now, Winston Church-
ill certainly had a way with words, and 
when he calls it an unsordid act, I 
guess today we would say it was the 
most selfless and unselfish act in the 
whole of recorded history by the 
United States of America. 
The circumstances today are not 
those of March of 1941. There is no mis-
take about that. Yet, if you look back 
at the historical parallels—at the cir-
cumstances in 1939, when Hitler in-
vaded Czechoslovakia for similar rea-
sons for which Putin is claiming he has 
a right to invade Ukraine—they are 
chilling. If we had stood up to Germany 
then, we might have avoided a global 
calamity and prevented the loss of mil-
lions of innocent lives. 
So what best to inform our actions 
today but the experience of the past, to 
correct our mistakes, and to duplicate 
the successful efforts in World War II 
or at other times in our history. The 
lessons of the past must inform the 
present, and I believe we still have a 
duty to lead when it comes to pro-
tecting democracies and freedom-lov-
ing countries around the world. 
Once again, America can now become 
that arsenal of democracy for Ukraine. 
To that end, I have introduced bipar-
tisan legislation called the Ukraine De-
mocracy Defense Lend-Lease Act to en-
sure that Ukrainian forces have the re-
sources they need to deter and defend 
against Russian aggression. 
I am proud to have worked with sen-
ior members of the Armed Services 
Committee and Senate Foreign Rela-
tions Committee—people like Senators 
CARDIN, WICKER, SHAHEEN, GRAHAM, 
BLUMENTHAL, SULLIVAN, and HASSAN— 
on this legislation, which will give the 
administration 
and 
give 
President 
Biden more flexibility and more effi-
ciency when it comes to being that ar-
senal of democracy for Ukraine. 
As it stands today, the President of 
the United States has a menu of op-
tions to support our friends and allies 
in times of conflict. In some cases, like 
the loan of equipment, the United 
States could eventually retain end use. 
In others, this would make clear we 
would support grants or emergency aid 
where we would not recover the fund-
ing or assets sent to our allies. This

February 1, 2022 
bill provides an additional option on 
the menu, allowing the United States 
to provide assistance that may other-
wise be unfeasible unless we could re-
tain end use. This legislation author-
izes the President to enter into lend- 
lease agreements directly with Ukraine 
and provide the military equipment 
necessary to protect the Ukrainian 
people. 
My hope is that this will send an-
other message to Vladimir Putin that 
not only do you need to consider the 
statements and actions of the execu-
tive branch but that you also need to 
look at the bipartisan support that 
Ukraine is getting in the U.S. Con-
gress—tangible support—in terms of 
weapons they can use to deter and, if 
not to deter, to defeat Russian aggres-
sion. Russia must know that an inva-
sion would be met with steel and not 
mush. If Russian troops make the deci-
sion to move forward, Ukrainian forces 
would have the lethal weapons needed 
to defend their sovereignty. I am proud 
of the fact that this effort does have 
such strong bipartisan support, and I 
hope more of our colleagues will join us 
in this legislation. 
This is one important way we can 
send a message to our friends and allies 
around the world that you are not 
alone, that America can be trusted, 
that our commitments are credible and 
they will be met not just with words 
but with action. 
Thanks to the leadership of Chair-
man MENENDEZ of the Foreign Rela-
tions Committee and Ranking Member 
RISCH, I have been proud to work with 
this bipartisan group of colleagues to 
discuss not just this lend-lease legisla-
tion but a more comprehensive ap-
proach to counter Russian aggression. 
We have discussed the lend-lease bill, 
as well as additional security assist-
ance and lethal aid for Ukraine. 
The group is currently crafting a 
package of targeted sanctions, as well, 
meant to deter Russia from invading. 
It includes limited but immediate 
sanctions in response to ongoing ag-
gression and, in particular, cyber at-
tacks, which were a new domain un-
known in World War II but which are 
very real in 2022. 
Russia cannot operate under the illu-
sion that it will only receive a slap on 
the hand for invading Ukraine. I will 
leave it to the chairman and ranking 
member to make announcements about 
this legislation, but suffice it to say 
that I am encouraged that bipartisan 
progress is being made. 
We agree on the outlines of what is 
being discussed, and we are committed 
to striking a deal as quickly as possible 
because time is of the essence. Nobody 
knows, except Vladimir Putin, when he 
will order the invasion of Ukraine. But 
make no mistake, America stands with 
Ukraine, and we will do everything we 
can to help them defend themselves 
against an invasion by the Russian 
Federation. 
This is not just a Ukraine problem. 
This is not just a Europe problem or a 
NATO problem. The potential for esca-
lation makes this a global security 
problem. Russia didn’t stop after Geor-
gia or Crimea, and it likely will not 
stop after Ukraine. 
We are confronting the scope of Rus-
sia’s power and influence on the global 
stage, and America’s leadership, as al-
ways, is absolutely crucial. 
The United States has a responsi-
bility to promote peace and security 
around the world. If Russia invades 
Ukraine and America does nothing, we 
show the world that our position can’t 
be trusted, that our promises to our al-
lies are not credible, and we also show 
that we will sacrifice the lives and the 
treasure of freedom-loving countries 
like Ukraine to the biggest bully on 
the continent. 
A shifting global order would send a 
signal to other countries, as well—not 
just in Europe but around the world, in 
places like China and Iran—that all 
bets are off. They may be incentivized 
to mount similar pressure campaigns 
and not fear retaliation by the United 
States and our allies. If that were to 
happen, America would no longer be 
the global superpower. We would sud-
denly become a regional power with 
mere aspirations and no global reach. 
Make no mistake, an attack on 
Ukraine is also an attack on America’s 
global security interests and on world 
peace and could have cascading con-
sequences that right now are too hor-
rible to contemplate. 
This is an existential threat to our 
leadership in the world and to the glob-
al order we underwrite and to our way 
of life and the way of life for freedom- 
loving democracies around the world. A 
Russian invasion of Ukraine is far 
more existential than a mere isolated 
and faraway quarrel. 
I appreciate the hard work of Sen-
ators on both sides of the aisle to de-
velop this response—this strong re-
sponse—to Russia’s threatened aggres-
sion. We need to do our part to ensure 
that, when Russia probes with bayo-
nets, it shall be met with steel.

Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unan-

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

TRIBUTE TO CHRISTOPHER AUSTEN JOYNER 
Mr. BURR. Mr. President, occasion-
ally, Members are given the oppor-
tunity for a point of personal privilege. 
This is mine today. Today, I rise to 
speak in tribute to Christopher Austen 
Joyner, my most trusted adviser for 
the last 24 years. 
This week, Chris will retire from a 
22-year career working in public serv-
ice, most of them supporting me in 
some capacity. 
Twenty-two years is a long time. In 
Hill terminology, that translates to 
three terms in the House, followed by 
almost three terms in the U.S. Senate. 
And in Chris’s case, it includes partici-
pation in almost every one of my cam-
paigns since 1998. To say that I will 
miss our partnership is an understate-
ment. 
Joyner’s love of country, his dedica-
tion to serve, his ability to bring out 
the best in staff and in me have been a 
true gift for the last two decades. 
Chris, I hope you will enjoy a well- 
earned retirement; that you can head 
out to the coast; that you can have a 
few laughs with your wife, Amanda, 
your kids, Liz and Andrew; that you 
can enjoy some more baseball games, 
whether that is coaching Andrew’s Lit-
tle League team or sitting at Nats 
Park; and that you can properly reflect 
on your poor decision to get a pan-
demic puppy. From now on, I hope that 
there will only be one Monday per 
week, and, in addition to lunch, you oc-
casionally get dinner. I expect to see 
you here, though, for the occasional 
breakfast burrito. 
Like so many young staffers, Chris 
started his Hill career as an intern at 
the Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee in 1996. In the spring of 1998, 
Alicia Clark, my then-chief of staff, 
brought Chris to my House office as a 
legislative assistant. Chris worked in 
my House office from 1998 to 2005, in-
volved in almost every issue that came 
through our doors: foreign policy, de-
fense, oversight, trade, tax, ag. In my 
House office, I could always count on 
Chris to be committed, prepared, and 
willing to work within the conference 
and across the aisle to get things done 
for the American people. 
One of Chris’s proudest accomplish-
ments during those years was his work 
with a bipartisan group of House staff-
ers to draft legislation that ultimately 
became the tobacco quota buyout. Of 
course, I think his most noticeable ac-
complishment there in those years was 
to meet and marry the love of his life, 
Amanda, who has been patient over the 
years with long nights, nonexistent 
weekends, and staffdels that produced 
laundry smelling like jet fuel and ex-
plosives. 
Chris rose through the office ranks to 
become policy director, and he joined 
my Senate office in 2005. In the spring 
of 2006, after 8 years on Team Burr, 
Chris went looking for new challenges 
and briefly worked as a Washington rep 
for the American Petroleum Institute. 
Thankfully, he wasn’t gone too long, 
and, in 2008, Chris agreed to come back 
to my Senate office as chief of staff. As 
my chief, Chris hired and mentored my 
staff both here and in North Carolina 
and provided me invaluable counsel on 
a host of issues facing the American 
people. Whatever the problem, Chris al-
ways brought the best options to the 
table, occasionally with some good 
bourbon, and provided the best advice, 
even if I didn’t always agree. 
When I took over as chairman of the 
Senate Select Committee on Intel-
ligence in January 2015, I knew that

Chris would bring his keen intellect, 
good judgment, and steady leadership 
to the staff director role. Although 
Chris had never worked in the intel-
ligence community, I knew that he had 
the right balance of respect for the in-
telligence community’s mission and 
commitment to the Senate’s important 
oversight role. 
Chris dove into this role head first, 
learning everything he could about the 
intelligence community, becoming a 
champion of its missions and of its 
workforce. He traveled the world in 
pursuit of ground truth, joining me on 
trips to war zones, crisis hotspots, and 
training locations to show the intel-
ligence community our support; trav-
eling via trains, planes, armored cars, 
helicopters, and, occasionally, souped- 
up golf carts. Chris knew the value of 
an in-person thank-you to our people 
in harm’s way and the importance of a 
surprise stop to ensure that the reality 
on the ground was described back in 
Washington in the same way. 
Chris’s bipartisanship and his sup-
portive leadership style served him 
well during his time on the Intel Com-
mittee. Thankfully, he also kept his 
sense of humor and his penchant for 
movie quotes and exactly the right 
GIF. 
As staff director during the SSCI’s 
Russia investigation, Chris led a bipar-
tisan team of staffers on an almost 4- 
year-long effort to uncover foreign in-
terference in the 2016 election. Al-
though we had some heated moments 
and a lot of drama, Chris never 
wavered from the mission that Senator 
WARNER and I had given the staff: to 
follow the facts wherever they led. 
Chris’s leadership style is not flashy, 
and his quiet support for the SSCI staff 
and his devotion to the IC mission kept 
the committee focused on its essential 
oversight mission throughout a high- 
profile investigation in the beginning 
of the pandemic. 
Clearly, Chris could not get enough 
of this important mission, and for the 
last 2 years, Chris has served as the 
senior adviser on the committee, con-
tinuing the committee’s efforts to 
focus the intelligence community on 
critical work exposing malign foreign 
influence. His work is clearly rated 
AAA. 
Chris, I am proud of you. I am so 
thankful to you, and I hope you know 
how much your service has meant to 
all of us and especially to me. You have 
been a voice of common sense in a divi-
sive time, a steady hand through good 
times and bad times, and a champion of 
the legislative branch. Our Nation is 
safer, our intelligence community is 
sharper, and this institution is strong-
er because of you. Thank you for dedi-
cating your life and service to your Na-
tion and thank you for your dedication 
to me. It has truly been an honor and 
a privilege to have you by my side on 
this journey. We wish you well.

ture time has expired.

Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak for 2 min-
utes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
TRIBUTE TO CHRISTOPHER AUSTEN JOYNER 
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I apolo-
gize to my good friend the Senator 
from North Carolina for being a bit 
late. I have never seen him be this 
timely and this brief in his comments. 
But I wanted to take a moment to 
echo what I know he said about Chris 
Joyner, who has served with enormous 
distinction for Senator BURR in both 
his personal office and on the Intel-
ligence Committee. I want to particu-
larly recognize Chris and my staff di-
rector, Mike Casey, who managed to 
work together and, frankly, negotiate 
a peace treaty between Senator BURR 
and me. When we started the Russia in-
vestigation, we had a few bumps. 
But, as I am sure Senator BURR has 
pointed out, Chris served with enor-
mous distinction in a very, very chal-
lenging time, putting together an in-
vestigation that came with integrity, 
truthfulness, and bipartisanship in a 
period—particularly under the previous 
administration—where 
those 
mile-
stones were not often highly regarded. 
Chris has decided to move forward in 
his career, and I simply want to join 
and echo Senator BURR’s comments 
about his commitment and service and 
wish him all the best in his future en-
deavors. 
With that, Mr. President, I yield the 
floor, and I appreciate the courtesy of 
an extra couple of minutes.

VIOLENT CRIME 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
everybody knows that violent crime is 
rising in America. Killings of police are 
at a 20-year high, the world’s worst 
record 
since 
9/11. 
Homicides, 
carjacking, and retail crime are all 
very high. Criminals are pushing peo-
ple in front of the subways, looting en-
tire trains filled with packages, and 
stealing so much from stores that the 
stores can’t afford to stay open. 
I have already come to this Senate 
floor many times to describe the hor-
rors of increased attacks on police and 
the surge in murders. These tragedies 
cry out for action. 
These are the results of campaigns to 
defund the police. Our streets are law-
less because blue cities have pulled the

police 
back. 
The 
consequences 
of 
depolicing extend far beyond the vio-
lence that ‘‘defund the police’’ rhetoric 
inspires. It extends beyond criminals 
emboldened to commit crimes like 
murder and armed carjackings. 
We have all seen the images of a Cali-
fornia train yard littered with opened 
boxes as far as the eye can see. Train 
robberies are up by 160 percent in Los 
Angeles County, and that is just over 
the past year. The Governor of Cali-
fornia compared the scenes to a Third 
World country. I have seen them, and I 
agree with the Governor of California. 
Organized retail crime is out of con-
trol. Criminals rely on the lack of ac-
tive policing to commit large-scale 
theft. According to the National Retail 
Federation, 69 percent of retailers say 
that they have had an increase in theft 
in the last year, and 78 percent say 
more law enforcement would help stop 
the crimes of retail theft. 
Why would people not expect more 
law enforcement? Everybody knows 
that government is established for the 
public safety, among other reasons, but 
that is foremost. 
It still isn’t a secret what liberal cit-
ies need to do to keep crime out of 
their cities, out of their railways, out 
of their subways, out of their streets, 
and out of their stores. Send police 
where the crime happens. Tell the po-
lice to arrest criminals. Prosecute 
those criminals. Do not release dan-
gerous criminals out on bail. It is a 
very simple and effective way to reduce 
the amount of crime. 
Do you know what won’t work? Some 
of my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle think that the solution is gun 
control, but here is the issue: Gun con-
trol won’t stop a criminal from pushing 
an innocent victim in front of a sub-
way, let alone keep a criminal from ob-
taining an illegal gun. 
The real problem is enforcement by 
the police. The crime spike began in 
June 2020 when blue cities nationwide 
pulled the police off their streets, pro-
gressive 
prosecutors 
at 
that 
time 
stopped prosecuting, and these blue cit-
ies started bail reform policies that re-
leased 
violent 
criminals 
into 
the 
street. No police on the streets but a 
lot of criminals on the streets—it is no 
surprise that crime has risen. 
The problems are depolicing, polit-
ical—progressive prosecution, and inef-
fective bail policies. Blue city mayors 
depoliced until some realized that was 
a bad, bad decision to make. 
This liberal attitude toward crimi-
nality may now have a light at the end 
of the tunnel. It seems to be changing 
for the better. 
Just two or three examples: New 
York City’s new mayor, Eric Adams, 
announced that he would revive a 
plainclothes anticrime unit to combat 
the violence, and he is also suggesting 
better bail policies. A couple of months 
ago, we heard San Francisco Mayor 
London Breed declare a state of emer-
gency over crime in her city. And then, 
maybe a month ago, we saw Chicago 
Mayor Lori Lightfoot ask for Federal 
resources to fight crime. 
The Nation’s crime spike is the re-
sult of less law enforcement. Criminals 
are feeling bold—very bold—because 
they know they will go uncaught and, 
if uncaught, unpunished. 
Far-left mayors need to use a simple 
solution with a very proven record of 
success. They need to bring police back 
to our streets and keep the criminals 
off of our streets. 
(Mr. MURPHY assumed the Chair.) 
PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS 
On another matter, Mr. President, I 
want to talk about high drug prices. 
Three years ago, I began a bipartisan 
effort to lower prescription drug costs. 
And that isn’t just a Chuck Grassley 
issue; that is a bipartisan issue. 
Following, first, Finance Committee 
hearings that I chaired, bipartisan ne-
gotiations, and a bill markup, I intro-
duced with the senior Senator from Or-
egon a bill that we call Grassley- 
Wyden—but I don’t care if it is called 
Wyden-Grassley. The point is the Pre-
scription Drug Pricing Reduction Act 
will go a long way to stop the massive 
increase we have in drug prices. We 
passed this bill out of the Finance 
Committee on a bipartisan vote of 19 to 
9. I have never stopped working to ad-
vance a bipartisan, negotiated, and bal-
anced drug pricing bill. 
Drug prices are rising, and more 
Americans are having a harder time 
paying these high costs for prescription 
drugs. AARP says brand-name drugs 
that seniors use are going up at more 
than twice the rate of inflation. New 
data from another source, the National 
Health Interview Survey, estimates 
that 3.5 million seniors had difficulty 
affording their medication. 
I hear stories about rising drug costs 
all the time at my 99 county meetings. 
We have a Q&A at every one of those 
meetings so people can bring up any 
subject they want to bring up. They set 
the agenda, and always prescription 
drug pricing is on that agenda. The 
people probably asking the question, 
‘‘What are we going to do about pre-
scription drug pricing?’’ are probably 
the very same ones who are being hit 
by these high prices, and they notice 
the big increase in prices from year to 
year. 
As an example, Iowans tell me about 
the rising cost of their insulin or how 
they worry about paying for out-of- 
pocket costs in the doughnut hole. No 
matter how you look at it, drug costs 
are going up, and Americans are paying 
more. 
For 12 months, President Biden and 
the Democratic majority has focused 
on a partisan reckless tax-and-spending 
spree, and they have not made any 
progress in passing drug pricing reform 
as part of their partisan proposal. I 
compliment them for trying to do 
something about drug pricing, but it 
hasn’t happened yet, and the way you 
get things done in the U.S. Senate is by 
doing it in a bipartisan way. 
By every public account, the talks in 
the other party on their agenda have 
stalled. In fact, as best evidence of this, 
just this very day, the senior Senator 
from West Virginia said that the Dem-
ocrat bill is—this is his word—‘‘dead.’’ 
So instead of spending more time on 
bills that do not have votes, we could 
pass bipartisan legislation to lower 
drug costs this very day. It would have 
a meaningful impact on lowering pre-
scription drug costs. Let’s not waste 
another minute. 
So the Grassley-Wyden bill or the 
Wyden-Grassley bill remains our best 
chance to lower prescription drug costs 
in a bipartisan manner, and I urge my 
colleagues to work with me to pass this 
bill. 
I will give you just some examples— 
probably only a half dozen out of 27 
major pieces it has in it. 
No. 1, it caps out-of-pocket costs at 
$3,100. And I will have to give it to the 
Democrat proposal; they have reduced 
that down to $2,000. I am willing to ne-
gotiate 3,100 or 2,000. 
Secondly, it eliminates the doughnut 
hole. 
Third, it caps rising drug prices in 
Medicare at the inflation price index. 
Four, the bill ends uncapped tax-
payer-funded subsidies for Big Pharma. 
Five, it brings more sunshine, more 
competition, and more oversight to 
how Big Pharma prices drugs in the 
first place. 
Lastly, out of 2,700 sections in this 
bill, I want to say it saves $72 billion 
for seniors and $95 billion for tax-
payers. 
In addition to this bill, I have four 
prescription drug bills that have passed 
the Judiciary Committee with unani-
mous support. So, obviously, all four of 
those are bipartisan bills. 
These four bills bring more competi-
tion, let more affordable drugs come to 
the market, and end anticompetitive 
behavior by Big Pharma. 
I urge my colleagues to work with 
me to pass bipartisan drug pricing re-
form today. 
I will end by saying that, maybe 
early in the new administration, I had 
a telephone conversation with Presi-
dent Biden on the subject of drugs. He 
sent his legislative staff up here to 
meet with me on the subject. And I 
pointed out what they were trying to 
do, as I just pointed out to my col-
leagues today. They wanted to do it a 
different way; it doesn’t seem to be 
getting traction. So I said to the Presi-
dent’s staff—and I said to the President 
himself: You might want to take a look 
at this bipartisan bill, probably move 
it. 
BIPARTISAN LEGISLATION 
Mr. President, the other thing is—on

But at the end of that meeting, I

that point, he suggested a bipartisan 
bill 
that 
I 
have 
dealing 
with 
meatpacking

slaughter. So I told him today that 
maybe we can work on that piece of 
legislation, as well, in a bipartisan 
way. 
So I could point out three issues that 
I have moving with Democrats that 
could be brought up now. I will bet 
every one of the 99 Senators in here 
have bipartisan bills that they could be 
working on, and we ought to start that 
process going if we are going to have 
success for the year of 2022. 
I yield the floor.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous 
consent 
that, 
notwith-
standing rule XXII, at 5 p.m. today all 
postcloture time on the Ruiz nomina-
tion expire; and that following the con-
firmation vote, the Senate vote on the 
motions to invoke cloture on the 
Puttagunta, Lopez, and Staples nomi-
nations in the order listed, without in-
tervening action of debate; further, 
that if cloture is invoked on any of the

Republican leader. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. DURBIN. I want to notify all 
Senators that they should expect four 
rollcall votes beginning at 5 p.m. 
UKRAINE 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, there is 
a photograph that we have all seen: six 
battle-weary victorious marines rais-
ing the American flag on Iwo Jima. It 
is one of the most iconic photos of 
World War II. 
It was taken 77 years ago this month. 
Among those six brave marines was a 
coal miner’s son from western Pennsyl-
vania. His name was Sgt Michael 
Strank. At 25 years of age, he was the 
oldest of the six flag raisers. The men 
in his rifle squad idolized him. One of 
them said: ‘‘He was the kind of Marine 
you read about, the kind they make 
movies about.’’ 
Sergeant Strank used to tell his men: 
‘‘Follow me and I’ll try to bring you all 
home safely to your mothers.’’ 
One week after he raised the Amer-
ican flag atop Mount Suribachi, Mi-
chael Strank was killed in the Battle 
of Iwo Jima. He was the first of the six 
flag raisers to die. 
Today, he is buried among America’s 
heroes in Arlington National Ceme-
tery, but that is not the end of the 
story. 
In 2008, a Marine security guard 
based at the U.S. Embassy in Slovakia 
discovered that Michael Strank was 
not a natural-born U.S. citizen; he had 
received his citizenship through his fa-
ther when his father became a U.S. cit-
izen in 1935. So where was this marine’s 
marine born? He was the first child 
born into an ethnic Ukrainian family 
in what is now Slovakia. Like my own 
mother, who was born in Lithuania, 
Michael Strank came to America with 
his mother as a toddler, as soon as his 
father could save the money for their 
passage. 
Those who were there that day on 
Iwo Jima will remember that a loud 
cheer went up from thousands of ma-
rines when they saw, finally, that red, 
white, and blue of the U.S. flag flying 
over the highest peak on that island. 
They knew that that day, in the war 
between freedom and tyranny, freedom 
had won. 
Today, almost 80 years later, the bat-
tle between freedom and tyranny con-
tinues, and one of its new flash points 
is Ukraine. The Ukrainian people have 
made it clear: They want to be free and 
independent. They want to chart their 
own future. They want to choose their 
own leaders through elections that 
they conduct. 
This is the future that more than 92 
percent of Ukrainians chose in a ref-
erendum in 1991, after Ukraine declared 
its independence from the crumbling 
and corrupt Soviet Union, but Russian 
President Vladimir Putin—the old KGB 
agent—refuses 
to 
acknowledge 
Ukraine’s right to exist, its right to 
independence, and its right to self-de-
termination. 
For almost 100 days, from November 
2013 to January 2014, the Ukrainian 
people waged a ‘‘Revolution of Dig-
nity’’ to force from office a corrupt, 
Russian-backed, puppet President—and 
they won. In retaliation, Russia in-
vaded and annexed the Crimean Penin-
sula and parts of eastern Ukraine and 
installed a Russian-friendly govern-
ment. This forceful occupation of parts 
of Ukraine by Russia marked the first 
time, the first time since World War II 
ended, that one nation had redrawn the 
map of Europe by force. 
For the last 8 years, Russia has tried 
relentlessly to destabilize the demo-
cratically 
elected 
Government 
in 
Ukraine. This is part of the reason that 
President Trump’s efforts to withhold 
congressionally approved military aid 
for Ukraine in order to extract polit-
ical favors was egregious. Now, Putin 
has amassed more than 120,000 Russian 
soldiers on the borders of Ukraine. 
Whether 
Putin 
is 
driven 
by 
megalomaniacal delusions of restoring 
the Soviet Union or is simply seeking 
to create chaos and sow dissension 
among NATO allies is unclear, but here 
is what is clear: A Russian invasion of 
Ukraine would constitute a grave as-
sault not only on Ukraine, but on the 
institutions and agreements that have 
kept peace in Europe for almost 75 
years. 
A Russian invasion of Ukraine also 
could be seen as a danger to our NATO 
allies in Poland and in the courageous 
young Baltic democracies in Lithuania, 
Latvia, and Estonia. It would be a cat-
astrophic mistake on Putin’s part, and 
President Biden has made that point 
over and over. 
Chicago is home to one of the largest 
Polish communities outside of Warsaw, 
the largest Lithuanian community out-
side of Vilnius, and one of the largest 
Ukrainian 
communities 
outside 
of 
Kyiv. 
More 
than 
46,000 
Ukrainian 
Americans live in the Chicago area, the 
third largest Ukrainian community in 
the United States. 
A week ago, I attended a celebration 
at the Cultural Center in Chicago, on 
Chicago Avenue in Ukrainian Village. 
Also speaking at that gathering was 
Oksana Markarova, Ukraine’s Ambas-
sador to the United States. I can tell 
you, the Polish and Lithuanian com-
munities in Chicago were there stand-
ing in solidarity with the people of 
Ukraine—and with the people of Po-
land, Lithuania, and the Baltic to de-
cide their own futures. 
Vladimir Putin and his henchmen 
should know that the United States, 
NATO, and the entire community of 
democracies also believe that it is the 
right exclusively of Ukraine and other 
young democracies to protect their ter-
ritorial boundaries and decide their 
own fate. The United States made its 
position clear yesterday in the U.N. Se-
curity Council. Ukraine, the United 
States, NATO, and the entire commu-
nity of democracies all want a diplo-
matic solution to Russia’s threats on 
Ukraine. That is what we seek. If 
Vladimir Putin wants to avoid a deba-
cle that will cost his nation dearly in 
lives and treasure, he will agree to this 
solution. 
I commend President Biden, Sec-
retary of State Blinken, and their 
teams for their strong support of 
Ukrainian independence and against 
Russian aggression. The Biden admin-
istration has provided significant mili-
tary equipment for our Ukrainian 
friends to ensure that President Putin 
knows the price that a further invasion 
will cost. The administration has also 
bolstered the defense capabilities of 
our NATO partners in Poland and the 
Baltics. And if Putin is counting on 
partisan division in the Senate to 
weaken America’s resolve to defend 
Ukraine and its neighbors, he is mis-
taken. 
Yesterday, Senator GRASSLEY and I 
introduced a bipartisan resolution cele-
brating 100 years of diplomatic rela-
tions between the United States and 
the Baltic States and reaffirming our 
close relationship with these young de-
mocracies. Later this week, Senator 
SHAHEEN and I and several of our col-
leagues, from both parties, will meet 
with the Baltic and Polish Ambas-
sadors to reaffirm U.S. support for 
their nations. 
I hope that we will also see strong, 
bipartisan support for legislation that 
is being drafted by Senators MENENDEZ 
and RISCH, the chair and ranking mem-
ber of the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee. That bill will impose se-
vere, crippling economic sanctions on

Russia for any further invasion of 
Ukraine. It would bolster similar bruis-
ing sanctions drawn up by the Biden 
administration. It will ensure that any 
Russian aggression against Ukraine or 
its neighbors will be felt in Russia by 
their economy and their people. 
I mentioned that my mom came to 
this country when she was 2 years old, 
from Lithuania, in 1911. Her boat land-
ed in Baltimore. At the time, Lith-
uania was under the control of Tsarist 
Russia. It was a brutal, repressive 
place. 
After World War II, Lithuania be-
came part of the USSR against its will, 
another brutal and repressive regime. 
But in 1991, Lithuania became the first 
Soviet Republic to declare its inde-
pendence. In response, Soviet tanks 
under control of Gorbachev rolled in to 
crush the new Lithuanian democracy. I 
was there before those tanks arrived. 
Their Parliament is called the Seimas. 
They had put sandbags around the out-
side of it to try to stop the Soviets and 
their tanks. They took me in the back, 
in a small room off to the side, and 
showed me their arsenal. It consisted 
of about 10 rifles that had been bor-
rowed from farmers in the countryside 
to try to defend their capital, Vilnius. 
Kids were assembled outside, praying 
the Rosary in the snow, lighting little 
candles by the sandbags to show the 
solidarity of the people of Lithuania, 
their determination to survive. 
Soviet tanks rolled in, killed 13 inno-
cent people, and injured dozens more. 
But then, to the world’s astonish-
ment—and mine too—Prime Minister 
Mikhail Gorbachev ordered the tanks 
to withdraw. 
Later, another Russian President, 
Boris Yeltsin, supported Lithuanian 
independence. Years after his death, 
Lithuania honored him with an award 
for his commitment to Lithuanian 
statehood and bilateral relations be-
tween Lithuania and Russia. 
Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin 
understood that you can brutalize a 
people who are determined to be free, 
but you can never defeat them. Ulti-
mately, freedom will win. It is a trag-
edy that Russian President Putin can-
not or will not learn that same lesson 
of history today when it comes to 
Ukraine. 
Seventy-seven years ago, an Amer-
ican marine born in Ukraine raised the 
American flag on Iwo Jima. Today, a 
generation of young Ukrainians raised 
in freedom are holding high the yellow- 
and-blue flag of their own nation and 
saying: We too want to be free. Our 
message to them is very simple and 
straightforward: You are not alone. 
Like the shipyard workers in Gdansk 
and the other members of the Polish 
Solidarity movement who helped bring 
an end to the decrepit and brutal So-
viet Union—like the 2 million Esto-
nians, Latvians, and Lithuanians who 
actually physically joined hands to de-
fend freedom across their nations—his-
tory and the free world will stand with 
you. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
UKRAINE 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I am 
here today to talk about the escalating 
aggression by Russia against Ukraine, 
an ally and a sovereign country whose 
territorial integrity is once again 
under attack. In our generation, this is 
where the fight for freedom is being 
held; this is where it is being waged. It 
is going to affect not just Ukraine and 
Eastern Europe but countries all over 
the world, depending on the outcome. 
Today, I am going to address what I 
think the appropriate role is for us as 
Americans, what more we can do to 
help avoid what could become an inter-
national disaster and a humanitarian 
crisis. 
Russia is the aggressor here, having 
invaded Ukraine twice in the past 8 
years, illegally annexing Crimea, in-
serting troops and offensive military 
weaponry into the Donbas region of 
Ukraine, 
initiating 
cyber 
attacks 
against public and private entities in 
Ukraine, and using disinformation to 
try to destabilize the democratically 
elected Government of Ukraine. 
Now they have gone further by 
amassing more than 100,000 troops 
under the command of 100 tactical 
groups on Russia’s Ukrainian border. 
This 
Russian 
deployment 
includes 
rockets and tanks and artillery and is 
no longer just on the eastern border of 
Ukraine, but it is now across the bor-
ders, including the northern border, 
where 
Russian 
combat 
troops 
and 
heavy 
equipment 
have 
gone 
into 
Belarus. And on the Belarus-Ukrainian 
border, a Russian presence is being felt. 
It is also in Crimea and in the Black 
Sea area, where Russia is taking ad-
vantage of their illegal annexation to 
move troops in those areas close to 
Ukraine. 
I will give you a little history about 
how we got here. Eight years ago, the 
people of Ukraine made a clear choice. 
They stood up to a Russian-backed, 
corrupt government in 2014 and made a 
conscious decision to turn to the West, 
to the European Union, to us, the 
United States of America. 
I was in Ukraine in 2014, shortly after 
what is called the Euromaidan, also 
the Revolution of Dignity. The barri-
cades were still there. And in the cen-
ter of town, the Maidan, in Kyiv, was 
occupied still by Ukrainian patriots, 
insisting that Ukraine chart its own 
course. The Ukrainian people had re-
jected authoritarianism and, instead, 
embraced freedom, embraced democ-
racy, freedom of speech, freedom to 
gather, freedom for the respect of law, 
respect for the judicial institutions in 
the country, and free markets. 
Now, have they stumbled along the 
way sometimes with regard to reforms, 
including of the judicial system? Yes, 
of course. Most fledgling democracies 
do; all of them do. But they have made 
tremendous progress, and they are on 
their way toward becoming what they 
wanted to become at the time 8 years 
ago—again, this Revolution of Dignity 
that is called the Euromaidan—more 
like a Western European or Eastern 
European country that is part of the 
EU. 
Despite Russia’s unrelenting efforts 
to destabilize Ukraine over the past 8 
years, the people of Ukraine have re-
mained committed to this independent, 
sovereign, and democratic principle, 
that vision. 
And Ukrainians today are actually 
increasingly patriotic and opposed to 
the Russian efforts to destabilize their 
country. According to polling data, 
this sentiment is especially true among 
young people, which makes sense be-
cause they have tasted the fruits of 
freedom—free enterprise, the ability to 
express themselves, the ability to con-
nect with the rest of the free world. 
They don’t want state control. They 
don’t want repression. They don’t want 
fear. Instead, they want liberty and 
prosperity. 
Moscow and Russia would have the 
world believe that somehow this mas-
sive, unwarranted Russian buildup is 
about trying to shore up its border 
against threats from Ukraine and from 
NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Or-
ganization. Nothing could be further 
from the truth, of course. This is pat-
ently false. Ukraine’s military posture 
has always been defensive. Unlike Rus-
sia, Ukraine has upheld its commit-
ments under the Minsk agreements, 
which were designed to ensure a cease- 
fire in the Donbas region, the eastern 
part of Ukraine. NATO, of course, is de-
fensive. It is not an offensive group and 
is no threat to Russian territorial in-
tegrity. 
My hope is that Congress can come 
together 
this 
week—Republicans, 
Democrats, Senate, and House—and 
issue a strong message to the people of 
Ukraine that we stand with them in 
their fight for freedom; to Russia that 
if they choose to invade, the armed 
conflict will carry a heavy cost, and 
the sanctions that would result from 
that would be devastating; and then to 
the world that the United States 
stands with its allies, not just in East-
ern Europe but throughout the free-
dom-loving countries of the world. 
I am hoping Congress will pass an ex-
tensive sanctions package, including 
increased security funding for Ukraine, 
more resources for cyber security, and 
funding for the Global Engagement 
Center at the U.S. State Department to 
help 
push 
back 
on 
Russian 
disinformation. 
I want to say a word about our allies. 
In many respects, I believe that what 
Vladimir Putin has done by these ag-
gressive actions we talked about is to 
strengthen the transatlantic alliance,

including those countries that are part 
of NATO, and go beyond that, countries 
in other parts of the world that under-
stand that this is about the cause of 
freedom. So many have stepped up. 
Denmark is providing F–16 jets to near-
by Lithuania. Spain is sending ships to 
join a NATO fleet. France is getting 
ready to send troops to Romania, they 
say. The United Kingdom has sent 
anti-tank weapons directly to Kyiv and 
supported Ukraine in so many ways. 
When I was in Ukraine recently, I 
was there to see a cargo plane unload 
anti-tank weapons from the UK to 
Ukraine. And recently, the United 
States has not just increased our mili-
tary assistance to Ukraine to help it 
defend itself, but also we have placed 
8,500 of our troops on heightened alert 
to go to be with our NATO allies in the 
region in Eastern Europe. They, of 
course, welcome that. 
Ukraine, by the way, has never asked 
for U.S. troops or NATO troops to de-
fend Ukraine. They have asked for help 
to be able to defend themselves. And 
that is an important distinction. 
On the Russian pipeline to Europe 
called Nord Stream—I think it was a 
bad idea before all this started and I 
think it is even a worse idea now—Rus-
sia provides Germany with roughly 
one-third of their natural gas supply 
already, a dependency that will in-
crease substantially with the activa-
tion of the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline. 
Let’s not forget, this multimillion- 
dollar pipeline is one that this body, 
the U.S. Senate, chose not to impose 
sanctions on just a few weeks ago after 
we had already done so once before on 
a bipartisan basis. I will say the vote 
last week was not 60 votes, but it was 
a majority of this body voting to im-
pose sanctions because, again, the Nord 
Stream 2 Pipeline is a bad idea in 
terms of the dependency of Europe on 
Russia. 
Once the pipeline is complete, it will 
supply a lot of Russian gas to Ger-
many, the rest of Europe, and Russia 
will use it as a political weapon. We 
have seen this. This is no surprise that 
they would do it. They did in it in 
Moldova, and of course they have done 
it in Ukraine. 
Even today, German prices are being 
affected by what Russia decides is ap-
propriate. Germany has told us pri-
vately that they are willing to shut 
down the pipeline if Russia invades 
Ukraine, but they should say so pub-
licly and clearly. 
I am also concerned about Germany’s 
resistance to approving arms sales to 
Ukraine. Again, Ukraine just wants the 
help to be able to defend itself. A great 
example of this is some artillery pieces 
that were made in East Germany dec-
ades ago. Those artillery pieces, those 
howitzers, are now in the hands of the 
Estonians. The Estonians want to pro-
vide these weapons to the Ukrainians. 
The 
Ukrainians 
want 
them. 
Even 
though they are older howitzers, they 
need them. They need the artillery. 
And yet, because they were made in 
Germany—in East Germany—decades 
ago, under the licensing agreement, 
Germany has to approve Estonia send-
ing Ukraine these weapons they so des-
perately need. That approval has not 
been forthcoming. 
To me, this is outrageous that 
Ukraine is not receiving the weapons it 
needs because another country that is 
part of the NATO alliance is saying 
that they are not going to approve the 
transfer. I hope that will change. I 
hope very soon we will see that trans-
fer approved. 
Germany, by the way, might say—as 
I have heard from some, and I have had 
conversations about this with them— 
that they don’t like to send weapons 
into hot spots. Well, they are certainly 
happy to send weapons into the Middle 
East. In fact, last year, as I understand 
it, it was their largest year ever of ex-
ports of military weapons made in Ger-
many to other countries, including to 
countries like Egypt, as an example. 
So we need to be sure that we are 
doing all we can to avoid Russia mak-
ing this terrible mistake. And a big 
part of this should be all the countries 
in the region, certainly our NATO al-
lies, standing up and providing mili-
tary assistance to Ukraine and making 
clear that if something happens, that 
the consequences will be devastating 
because of sanctions. 
The cost of freedom in Eastern Eu-
rope is at stake here, but so is, really, 
the stability of all of Europe. The 
Ukrainian officials themselves have 
talked about this. The Foreign Min-
ister, Foreign Minister Kuleba, whom I 
met with recently in Ukraine, stated 
that Germany is taking a stance that 
‘‘does not correspond with the level of 
our relations and the current security 
situation.’’ 
I agree. 
People listening may be wondering: 
Why should the United States get en-
gaged here? Why is this Senator from 
Ohio passionate about this? 
Well, first, in Ohio, we have a lot of 
Ukrainians I have gotten to know over 
the years, and it is not just about the 
Ukrainian Americans in Ohio; it is 
about people from all over that part of 
the world—Central Europe, Eastern 
Europe, certainly the Baltics, Lith-
uania, Latvia. The people whom I talk 
to tell me that this is, again, a seminal 
moment, not just in the history of 
Ukraine, but in the history of our 
world because, again, it is the fight for 
freedom being played out right before 
our eyes. These nationality groups, in-
cluding, 
of 
course, 
the 
Ukrainian 
Americans, are deeply concerned that 
this continued aggression unchecked 
will lead to other countries, including 
the Baltics, including Poland and oth-
ers, being subject to the same kind of 
pressure from Russia. 
But it is also because I believe what 
happens in Ukraine does affect the 
cause of freedom more broadly. Coun-
tries all over the world are watching. 
Authoritarian countries are watching. 
Democratically elected countries are 
watching. And they are wondering, in 
the 21st century, are we going to allow 
something like this to occur, when one 
country looks to another and says that 
I want that country so I am going to 
invade and take that land? 
Again, until we had the invasion of 
Crimea only 8 years ago, this hadn’t 
happened in almost 80 years since 
World War II on the continent of Eu-
rope. 
This is something that countries are 
watching to get a message to see 
whether the United States is going to 
continue to be the country that joins 
with others, including our NATO alli-
ance but a much broader group of free-
dom-loving countries to stand up for 
the cause of freedom and to stand up 
for the right of a sovereign country to 
be able to protect its own borders. 
I recently joined a bipartisan delega-
tion led by me and my good friend Sen-
ator JEANNE SHAHEEN. Senator MUR-
PHY, who is on the floor tonight, was 
also with us. We personally met with 
President Zelensky. We also met with 
four or five other Cabinet officials, in-
cluding the Secretary of Defense. We 
talked about the U.S. commitment to 
provide military assistance to ensure 
Ukraine can defend itself and deter the 
threat. If you talk to these individuals 
and you talk to the military officials 
we talked to and the commanders—and 
I have also been to the line of contact, 
where this hot water is going on with 
Russia even today in the Donbas re-
gion. I have been there. I have talked 
to the troops. You will see that there is 
a commitment, a strong commitment 
by the Ukrainians to defend them-
selves. They get that this is a critical 
time in their history. 
We tried to send a clear message on a 
bipartisan basis. I believe we did. I be-
lieve that this time—this time—unlike 
2014, when, frankly, Ukraine and the 
world wasn’t ready, that the situation 
is very different. The military is pre-
pared. The people of Ukraine have a 
strong sense of nationalism and a deep 
patriotism and they will fight and this 
will be a bloody conflict that we all 
want to avoid. 
The other thing I will say about 
Ukraine is they are our friends. They 
are our allies. They share our values. 
When the United States was looking 
for help in Iraq and Afghanistan, some 
NATO partners came through, but so 
did Ukraine. Ukrainian troops were 
shoulder to shoulder with American 
troops during some very tough situa-
tions in those countries. These are our 
friends. This is a country that has al-
lied with us because they believe that 
that is the best future for the Ukrain-
ian people. 
It is time for us to stand with them 
in response to this unwarranted and 
unprovoked Russian aggression. My 
hope is that Congress will act on a bi-
partisan 
and 
bicameral 
basis—the 
House and Senate, Republicans and 
Democrats—and send a strong message 
to Russia that would avoid a bloody 
conflict, deter them from taking the

actions that they are contemplating 
and making a terrible mistake, but 
also that we would send a strong mes-
sage to the people of Ukraine to give 
them strength during this time, and, fi-
nally, a message to the global commu-
nity that the lamp of freedom will not 
be extinguished. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, we are 4 
months into the fiscal year, and our 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
have still not agreed to a deal to fund 
the Federal Government, including the 
Department of Defense. In a matter of 
days, we will face the prospect of a 
long-term 
continuing 
resolution 
or 
government shutdown if an agreement 
on overall funding levels cannot be 
reached. 
From the moment President Biden 
submitted his budget request, Repub-
lican leaders said his proposed $12.6 bil-
lion increase for defense was not 
enough. So, on a bipartisan basis, we 
worked to raise that number to a level 
proposed by the ranking member of the 
Armed Services Committee and sup-
ported by every Republican on the 
committee as well as the 88 Senators 
who voted for the final National De-
fense Authorization Act. 
But even with that defense number in 
hand, our Republican colleagues con-
tinue to draw out negotiations on a 
top-line funding number for the Fed-
eral Government. In doing so, they risk 
pushing us into a full-year continuing 
resolution that would fund defense at a 
level 
that 
is 
less 
than 
President 
Biden’s initial request. 
Let me say that again. They were 
deeply critical of the President’s pro-
posal. They worked and we worked 
with them to get a robust increase in 
defense spending, and now they are pre-
pared to accept a number even below 
President Biden’s request. 
Make no mistake, a full-year CR will 
short-change our military, and it will 
disrupt the efficient operations of the 
Federal Government in the midst of 
international 
tension, 
the 
ongoing 
COVID–19 pandemic, and a fragile eco-
nomic recovery. 
As my colleague from Ohio just 
pointed out, we are in a serious con-
frontation on the Ukrainian border be-
tween Russian forces and Ukrainian 
forces. And we have indicated that we 
want to help. A big part of that help 
would come from the Department of 
Defense, but it would be very difficult 
with a continuing resolution to mar-
shal the help and support to our col-
leagues and our friends in Ukraine. 
As I noted, the outlines of a reason-
able agreement for both defense and 
nondefense funding have been evident 
for some time. Indeed, the National De-
fense Authorization Act, which passed 
on a bipartisan basis in December, set 
a funding level for defense that is 5 per-
cent higher than last year’s enacted 
level. It reflects the level proposed by 
Ranking 
Member 
INHOFE. 
And, 
as 
chairman of the Senate Armed Serv-
ices Committee, I fully supported that 
funding level and cosponsored Senator 
INHOFE’s amendment to authorize the 
increase. 
For his part, Senator LEAHY
has 
adopted the NDAA defense funding lev-
els in the bills that the Appropriations 
Committee introduced in November. 
He accommodated that increase by re-
ducing funding for domestic programs 
by $22.5 billion from the level in the ad-
ministration’s request. 
So Democrats have agreed to in-
crease defense funding and to reduce 
nondefense funding from the levels re-
quested by the President. In doing so, 
Democrats proposed a budget that 
funds defense activities at a level that 
is higher than nondefense activities. 
Let me underscore that point, be-
cause GOP leaders often say there 
should be parity between defense and 
nondefense spending. Senate Demo-
crats have proposed spending bills that 
have $777.5 billion for defense and $753 
billion for every other discretionary 
program—the 
VA, 
education, 
agri-
culture, FBI, Department of Homeland 
Security, and so on. Democrats have 
offered our Republican colleagues near-
ly everything they have asked for, but 
they won’t take yes for an answer. 
As we drift toward the full-year CR, 
our colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle are reacting with nonchalance to 
the impacts on defense. 
Let me remind my colleagues what a 
full-year CR will mean for national de-
fense. It will mean that defense spend-
ing would be about $37 billion lower 
than the levels set out in the NDAA 
and lower than the funding levels re-
quested by President Biden—yes, those 
levels they criticized so aggressively 
that President Biden suggests. If they 
pursue this path of a CR, the numbers 
for defense will be less than the Presi-
dent’s initial request. 
It means military personnel accounts 
will be funded $5 billion below what the 
Department requested. A CR means 
DOD will have to cannibalize other ac-
counts in order to provide the pay raise 
and other benefit increases that our 
servicemembers rightfully deserve. 
It means the Pentagon may have to 
delay or suspend permanent change-of- 
station moves and accession of troops— 
again, all of this in the context, as my 
colleague from Ohio pointed out, of a 
major crisis in Europe and a growing 
concern about Chinese activities in the 
Pacific. 
It means training and readiness ac-
counts will fall about $5.3 billion short 
of what the Department requested. And 
the key to the morale of soldiers— 
among one of the most important 
keys—is that they are well trained and 
they are prepared. We owe it to them 
to give them that training and ensure 
they are prepared. 
It means the military healthcare ac-
count will be short over $1 billion. 
A CR also means that we will be tied 
to funding priorities from a year ago, 
even 
though 
circumstances 
have 
changed markedly. For example, our 
military engagements with Afghani-
stan and Eastern Europe are vastly dif-
ferent from last year. Funding will be 
trapped in the wrong accounts and the 
Defense Department will not have the 
flexibility to move it where it is need-
ed. 
A CR will prevent the Defense De-
partment from effectively modernizing 
and reinvesting in new programs. Be-
cause new program starts are not al-
lowed under a CR, the Department of 
Defense will be forced into funding leg-
acy systems that are outdated and in-
efficient. Meanwhile, important new 
initiatives and acquisitions would be 
delayed. 
We won’t be able to fund three addi-
tional ships and seven more Joint 
Strike Fighters in the Navy’s 2022 
budget. The Marines would have to 
delay procurement of the MQ–9A Reap-
er UAV, and the Amphibious Combat 
Vehicle. 
The Space Force would have to cut 
two of the five planned national secu-
rity space launch missions, and the Air 
Force would have to delay the Ground- 
Based Strategic Deterrent Program 
and the long-range standoff weapon. 
DOD also won’t be able to start over 
100 military construction projects— 
new facilities that our servicemembers 
need to do their jobs safely and effec-
tively. This includes, among others: $32 
million in Air Force corrosion and sim-
ulator projects in Florida, $55 million 
for a joint operation center at Fort 
Polk in Louisiana, $56 million in total 
projects for Wisconsin, $75 million in 
total projects for Georgia, $94 million 
in total projects for Michigan, $161 mil-
lion in total projects for Texas, $186 
million in total projects for California, 
$251 million for a runway extension at 
Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in 
Alaska, $251 million in total projects 
for South Dakota, and $321 million in 
total projects for North Carolina. 
Finally, a CR will disrupt DOD’s 
partnerships with outside partners in 
the private sector and academia, and 
with our allies, because they inject un-
certainty, instability, and additional 
costs to R&D and acquisition proc-
esses. 
In short, a yearlong CR will make us 
less competitive with our adversaries 
and less able to respond to the rapidly 
changing global landscape, which was 
illustrated so eloquently by my col-
league from Ohio. It would be a self-in-
flicted wound at a dangerous time for 
the country and our international part-
ners. 
The impact will not only be felt on 
the defense side of the ledger. As the 
COVID–19 
pandemic 
continues 
to 
produce new and potentially dangerous 
strains, we risk losing $5 billion in re-
search at the NIH and $2.4 billion in 
funding for our public health infra-
structure, including funding for the 
CDC, BARDA, and the National Dis-
aster Medical System. 
And a CR would sacrifice $3 billion in 
new investments in mental health, and

one of the obvious outcomes of this 
pandemic is the mental health chal-
lenge that is facing all Americans, and 
particularly young Americans. 
We risk losing a proposed $400 in-
crease in the maximum Pell grant, just 
as schools and students are trying to 
finalize financial aid packages. Too 
many students have put off their col-
lege education due to economic hard-
ship and uncertainty during the pan-
demic. This Congress should not make 
matters worse by withholding student 
aid. 
A CR would also be a slap in the face 
to the Capitol Police, who have been 
stretched to the limit in the aftermath 
of the January 6 assault on the Capitol. 
It would deny the department needed 
funding to hire new officers, for over-
time and retention payments, as well 
as resources for officer wellness and 
mental health support. 
Chairman LEAHY has bent over back-
ward to engage our Republican col-
leagues. Four months into the fiscal 
year, we need them to reach an agree-
ment. Otherwise, we risk a full-year CR 
in which everybody loses—most of all 
the American people.

(The remarks of Mr. MORAN per-
taining to the introduction of S. 3541 
are printed in today’s RECORD under 
‘‘Statements on Introduced Bills and 
Joint Resolutions.’’) 
Mr. MORAN. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, first, 
I would like to commend my colleague, 
the senior Senator from Kansas, for his 
incredible ongoing leadership on the 
issue of the veterans of our Nation and 
his strong commitment to each and 
every one of those veterans and to the 
men and women who wear the uniform 
and go to battle to keep us safe and 
keep us free, and it is his long history 
of leadership for which I am most 
grateful. 
ENERGY 
Mr. President, I come to the floor 
today to talk about a different issue, 
and that is the need for more American 
energy. 
Right now, the American people are 
facing the worst inflation in 40 years. 
In November, we saw the biggest price 
increases from an energy standpoint in 
10 years. CNBC reports that one in five 
American families could not afford to 
pay an energy bill this past year. 
Roughly the same number of Ameri-
cans have kept their homes at an 
unhealthy temperature because they 
can’t afford the cost of energy to heat 
it. 
Gas prices have gone up by roughly $1 
a gallon since Joe Biden took office. 
This is the fastest increase in gas 
prices in 40 years. The price of gas af-
fects the price of everything else. It is 
increasingly expensive in this country 
to transport goods from the farm and 
from the factory to the people who 
need the products. As a result, the 
American people aren’t just paying 
more at the pump; they are also paying 
more at the grocery store. 
So why are energy prices rising so 
quickly? Well, demand is up and supply 
is down. It is basic economics. 
Under Joe Biden, American energy 
production still hasn’t recovered in 
this country to the levels that we were 
producing energy prior to the pan-
demic. Why would that be? Because 
this is a direct result of the anti-Amer-
ican energy policies of this White 
House. 
On his first day in office, Joe Biden 
killed the Keystone XL Pipeline. He 
blocked new oil and gas leases on pub-
lic lands all across the country. He 
stopped the exploration for energy in 
the Arctic. He tried to ban exploration 
for energy off our coasts. He has 
threatened to raise taxes on American 
energy. So what happened? Well, as a 
result of this radical, anti-American, 
Biden energy agenda, we are failing to 
produce enough energy in this country, 
and people who have the capacity and 
ability to do it and have worked those 
jobs for a long time are having a hard 
time keeping a job. 
America is now producing 1.4 million 
fewer barrels of oil each and every day 
than we were prior to the pandemic. 
We are now using more oil from Russia 
than we are from Alaska. This is spe-
cifically the result of the Biden poli-
cies. 
Joe Biden is attacking American en-
ergy. He is turning into a great sales-
man for Russian energy. I mean, why is 
it that right now, we are importing 
twice as much—twice as much—crude 
oil from Russia as we did a year ago? It 
is because of Joe Biden. Joe Biden has 
even had his National Security Advisor 
plead with Russia to produce more oil 
to sell to the United States. 
I know the Presiding Officer may find 
that very hard to believe, but all you 
have to do is go to the White House’s 
website and read the sad fact. 
Just months after he killed the Key-
stone Pipeline, Joe Biden gave a big 
stamp of approval to Vladimir Putin— 
to Putin—for his pipeline, the Nord 
Stream 2 Pipeline. He killed the Amer-
ican pipeline and approved the Russian 
pipeline. Joe Biden’s energy policy is, 
pipelines for Putin and no pipeline for 
the American people, and the American 
people have been paying the price as a 
result. It seems that Joe Biden would 
rather have us buy energy from our en-
emies than have us produce the energy 
in our country and sell it to our 
friends. 
So, as a result of the Biden policies, 
Vladimir Putin has hit the energy fi-
nancial jackpot. For decades, Putin has 
used energy as a geopolitical weapon. 
How does he use it? He uses it to coerce 
and intimidate, and that includes our 
allies. We saw this in November when 
Putin shut off the flow of natural gas 
to Moldova. By giving Vladimir Putin 
Nord Stream 2, President Biden gave 
Putin a new geopolitical weapon, and 
now Putin is emboldened, and he is 
flush with cash. 
Right now, today, Vladimir Putin is 
preparing to do something he has want-
ed to do for years. He has amassed over 
100,000 troops on the border with 
Ukraine. With the Winter Olympics 
about to begin in China, Russia is ex-
pected to invade Ukraine. If Russia in-
vades, this will only worsen the energy 
crisis in that part of the world but also 
here as well. 
Vladimir Putin is cunning, he is op-
portunistic, and he is aggressive. When 
he sees an opportunity, he takes it. 
Putin can smell weakness, and he 
views our President, Joe Biden, as 
weak and ineffective. 
The sledgehammer we have against 
Putin is to shut down the Nord Stream 
2 Pipeline and to do it permanently. 
Last month, this body had an oppor-
tunity to do just that. Yet Senate 
Democrats filibustered the bill. The 
same Democrats who voted to get rid 
of the filibuster on the floor of the Sen-
ate used the filibuster to shut down a 
bill that many of them have supported 
for years. This is hypocrisy at its 
worst. 
Democrats, last week, based on lob-
bying from the White House, refused to 
sanction Putin’s pipeline. The Nord 
Stream 2 Pipeline is going to lead to an 
enormous transfer of wealth from our 
allies to our enemies. It is going to 
make our allies weaker, and it is going 
to make Vladimir Putin that much 
stronger. When Putin gets stronger and 
wealthier, what does he do? Well, he 
tends to become more aggressive. It is 
not just a threat to Europe; it is a 
threat to the whole world. 
So I have introduced legislation 
called the ESCAPE Act. My bill im-
poses mandatory sanctions on Russian 
pipeline projects, and it expedites the 
sales of American natural gas to our 
NATO allies. 
We have the ability to produce mas-
sive amounts of more energy in the 
United States than Joe Biden and the 
Democrats are allowing our country to 
produce, and, of course, the Democrats 
are killing jobs and hurting paychecks 
in the process. 
It is incumbent upon us to give our 
allies an opportunity to have energy 
and not be beholden to Vladimir 
Putin’s supply. We need to produce it 
here. We have it here. We should be 
producing it here.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S435 
February 1, 2022 
Vladimir Putin knows how to turn 
off the lights, and he knows how to 
raise energy prices in foreign coun-
tries. We can’t let Europe become more 
dependent on Vladimir Putin for any-
thing, and neither should we become 
more dependent, although that seems 
to be the Biden policy. Buy more crude 
oil from Russia than we were a year 
ago—Joe Biden in action. 
We need to expand our exports. We 
need to expand the production of Amer-
ican energy. We have it, and we have 
the capacity to do it. If we want to re-
duce inflation—and that is the No. 1 
topic I heard about in Wyoming this 
past week as I traveled around and vis-
ited with high school groups, rotary 
clubs, people in diners, and folks all 
around the State in many, many com-
munities—then why aren’t we just pro-
ducing more energy at home? That will 
help bring down the costs at the pump, 
the cost to heat, and the cost to get 
goods to market. 
We need to be producing it in Amer-
ica, in this country, and not be be-
holden to the far-left extremists who 
want energy costs to go up when the 
American people are struggling to get 
by. Energy is called the master re-
source for a reason. It powers our Na-
tion. It powers our military. It powers 
our economy. The same is true for our 
allies. We should not allow our allies to 
fall into the clutches of Vladimir 
Putin, even though that is what Joe 
Biden’s policies are doing today. 
We need more American energy, not 
less, and we need it now. 
I yield the floor.

THE GREAT EXPERIMENT 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, from 
the sweeping Green Mountains to the 
shores of the iconic Lake Champlain, 
one need look no further than Vermont 
to find the beating heart of America. 
To 
this 
day, 
communities 
across 
Vermont are welcoming refugees from 
around the world and most recently 
from war-torn Afghanistan. It is our 
history as a nation of immigrants that 
make these United States, as George 
Washington put it, the Great Experi-
ment. 
But with each passing moment, it 
seems this simple foundation of our 
Nation is under attack. Nationalism is 
on the rise and, with it, the threat that 
bedrock principles of our democracy 
are threatened. The strength of our Na-
tion rests not in what divides us, but in 
what unites us. By sharpening the divi-
sion, we edge toward authoritarianism, 
as Vermonter Haviland Smith wrote 
earlier this month in his column, 
‘‘Rural Ruminations.’’ 
Another of our great Presidents, 
Abraham Lincoln, so clearly said, ‘‘A 
house divided cannot stand.’’ Those 
words, now nearly 164 years old, are as 
true today as ever.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S437 
February 1, 2022 
I would invite everyone to read 
Haviland’s recent column, and I ask 
unanimous consent that it be printed 
in the RECORD. 
Its observations, and importantly the 
questions he pose, deserve thoughtful 
consideration. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the Times Argus, Jan. 3, 2022] 
RURAL RUMINATIONS: EDGING TOWARD 
AUTHORITARIANISM 
(By Haviland Smith) 
At the onset of 2022, The United States of 
America appears to be heading for possible 
major change. Opposing forces and ideologies 
are so hostile toward each other that there is 
clearly the possibility that this former rel-
atively pure democracy will be taken over by 
an entirely authoritarian management. 
Authoritarianism is defined as ‘‘the en-
forcement of strict obedience to authority at 
the expense of personal freedom and a lack of 
concern for the wishes and opinions of oth-
ers’’. Does that not define the United States 
at this moment? All we need to do now to be 
true to the ongoing world pattern is codify 
the situation governmentally. 
If you look around the world you will see 
case after case of countries being taken over 
by authoritarianism. Look at the Phil-
ippines, Brazil. Nicaragua, and Venezuela. 
One rationale for these takeovers is to ‘‘re-
store order’’. 
How is it possible that the United States 
could fit into this mold? To understand that 
question, it is important to look at the reli-
gious and ethnic makeup of today’s authori-
tarian states. What you will see right away 
in many if not most of those states are eth-
nically and/or religiously divided countries. 
Authoritarianism in the Middle East has not 
only ethnic divisions (Arab, Persian, Kurd, 
Druze, Turkish, etc.), but the religious split 
between Shia and Sunni. The Chinese have 
the Uighurs and over 50 other ethnic groups. 
The Russians have over 120 ethnic groups 
within their borders. And so it goes on and 
on, with many, if not most countries dealing 
with minorities that are not always friendly 
and that are often sufficiently hostile for the 
majority to install authoritarianism to gain 
and maintain power and to cope with those 
minority groups and their concomitant dis-
orders. 
Where many if not most of such divided 
countries have simply evolved that way 
through the realities of geography and sim-
ple migration, the United States is in class 
by itself. It has voluntarily created what 
may well be the world’s most diverse coun-
try and it has done so purposefully and ea-
gerly. Let’s face it, the only people who have 
always lived here are the native Americans. 
Europeans changed all that when they ar-
rived in numbers on this continent in the 
middle of the 16th century. Since then, large-
ly for economic reasons, we have seen every 
kind of migration that has ever existed. Over 
the centuries we have benefitted from immi-
gration from over 100 countries in Africa, 
Asia, Central America, the Caribbean, the 
Middle East, North Africa, Europe, South 
America and North America. 
Many of those immigrants, particularly 
black Africans, were brought here against 
their will as slaves to work for the European 
settlers. Others, mostly from more adjacent 
countries to our south, came here to work 
for better compensation, but it is critical to 
understand that they have played an incred-
ibly important role in the advancement of 
the United States on the economic front. 
How are we Americans to survive if today’s 
politicians succeed in forbidding or even lim-
iting the migration of Latin Americans who 
come to work mostly in agriculture? Who 
will do that work? 
Nativism has always existed in United 
States history. Some of the original colo-
nists despised people who did not share their 
own religious faiths. Nativism was particu-
larly strong during the major periods of im-
migration in the 19th Century. 
Somewhere along the way, America’s na-
tivists came to believe that people who were 
born in the United States were somehow bet-
ter that those born abroad. Given our history 
and recognizing today’s realities, one simply 
has to ask whether the remnants of nativism 
are playing a role in the philosophy of a 
large chunk of the American population. 
We have imported diverse groups of people 
over the years. In the main, they have been 
encouraged to maintain their original identi-
ties and cultures. This has created here in 
immigrant America the kinds of frictions be-
tween those groups that have always existed 
around the world. With a positive attitude 
toward immigration, whether for justified 
reasons or not, we have created the kind of 
situation that has led to authoritarian coups 
throughout the world. 
One could speculate that the negative atti-
tudes of one third of our population toward 
immigrants and foreigners is nothing more 
than a holdover of attitudes that have ex-
isted here since the first European settlers 
arrived on our shores. That certainly does 
not make those attitudes appropriate, but it 
would provide some understanding on how 
they got here and why they continue to 
exist. 
ls America to have the next authoritarian 
regime?

AMERICA’S PHOTOJOURNALISTS 
AND JANUARY 6 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, they 
are sometimes called the Fourth Es-
tate. The dedicated writers, research-
ers, editors, and investigators of the 
media, new and old. Their reporting 
writes the first draft of history. What 
an awesome responsibility. 
But today, I want to recognize one 
particular set of reporters: the press 
photographers. Their images, also part 
of the first draft of history, bring the 
words to life. The photos they capture 
tell stories through images—sometimes 
moving, sometimes horrific—a lan-
guage so universal that, sometimes, 
they need no words. 
Many have written about the events 
of January 6, when a violent mob of in-
surrectionists attacked the Capitol 
and, indeed, our very seat of govern-
ment. I was here that day, like so 
many Members of Congress, both the 
House and Senate, and so many staff-
ers. And what I saw was unlike any-
thing I have seen in my 47 years in the 
U.S. Senate. The press saw it, too— 
going on air to give accounts of what 
was happening, filing stories on the 
wires as the events were unfolding— 
and snapping the photographic evi-
dence of the violence, the fear, the van-
dalism, and, yes, the determination of 
that day. 
Scott Applewhite, a longtime photog-
rapher for the Associated Press, earlier 
this month published a piece for ‘‘The 
Public’s Radio,’’ recounting his experi-
ences that day and sharing several of 
the photographs he took that docu-
ment the events that unfolded. It is 
well worth a read, and I ask unanimous 
consent that it be printed in the 
RECORD. 
For anyone who is unaware of or who 
doubts the role of the press, and of its 
vigilant 
photographers, 
know 
this: 
While we work to make history, it is 
they who write it, as they capture and 
document it in their images. And make 
no mistake: Their jobs are as critical 
today as ever before. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the Public’s Radio Jan. 5, 2022] 
‘WE HAVE TO BE THERE’: AP PHOTOGRAPHER 
RECALLS CAPITOL SIEGE 
(By Scott J. Applewhite) 
When the U.S. Capitol came under siege a 
year ago, Associated Press photographer J. 
Scott Applewhite was in the House chamber. 
In some respects he was the eyes of the 
world. All these months later, he is still 
processing the events of Jan. 6 as a photo-
journalist and as an American. When he 
thinks about it, Applewhite’s ultimate as-
sessment is this: The job of the photo-
journalist, is to show people what they can’t 
see on their own. And to do that, journalists 
have to be there—as he was. 
WASHINGTON (AP).—The U.S. Capitol was 
under siege. By Americans. 
It was Jan. 6, 2021, on Capitol Hill in Wash-
ington, and Associated Press photographer J. 
Scott Applewhite was in the middle of it 
all—and was the eyes of the world in some 
respects. His camera recorded images that 
we are still gazing at today. 
Here, he remembers some moments that 
stood out to him—moments that, so many 
months later, he is still processing as a 
photojournalist and as an American. 
‘‘The Capitol has been breached!’’ the Cap-
itol Police officer shouted to lawmakers. 
Tear gas was in the Rotunda. ‘‘Get out your 
escape hoods and prepare to evacuate!’’ the 
officer said. 
Glass was breaking in the main door to the 
chamber of the House of Representatives— 
the very door where you see the president 
enter for the State of the Union address. 
Quickly, the police and a few lawmakers 
grabbed benches and cabinets and barricaded 
the door. 
From the officers came loud commands: 
Evacuate. Now. Stragglers were not toler-
ated—members of Congress, staffers, journal-
ists, all. 
But the move to safety was not immediate. 
Because they didn’t know what was on the 
other side of the door. 
You could hear the growl of the mob just 
outside. In the chamber, the officers were fo-
cused, their guns aimed. And I was trained 
on the door as well—with a telephoto zoom. 
It was pretty sure I was right where I was 
supposed to be. I kept my lens focused on 
that reinforced door. Then: There was an 
eye, trying to see inside—the face of one of 
the rioters wearing a Trump hat. What he 
did not see were the guns aiming inches from 
his face. 
I kept steady and held tight on that spot. 
When the breach of the Capitol was an-
nounced and evacuation began, it was a cha-
otic and uncertain process. Evacuate to 
where? The mob was on the other side of the 
doors. 
Eventually, the officers announced that 
tear gas had been deployed in the nearby Ro-
tunda. All were instructed to don escape 
hoods that were stashed under the seats. 
That was part of the preparedness in the

wake of 9/11. I didn’t put one on because I 
needed to see to use my camera. 
After the evacuation order came, AP pho-
tographer Andy Harnik lingered and took 
many important images: lawmakers taking 
cover, and Capitol Police holding rioters at 
gunpoint. 
Andy and I were both in the balcony that 
overlooks the House chamber. Andy had been 
on a side where some members of Congress 
were watching and the police presence was 
plentiful. I had been on the opposite side 
with about 30 reporters and photographers. 
The officers eventually pushed everyone out. 
Andy must have been among the last. He 
said the final frame he shot in the chamber 
was one of me sitting alone in the House 
press gallery. Andy caught the terror in the 
faces of elected members of Congress as they 
dived for cover. When police rushed the 
members out, Andy kept his camera up, cap-
turing rioters held at gunpoint by tactical 
officers outside the chamber. 
The Capitol is where I work every day, and 
I am a familiar face to most police. When 
those on the chamber floor shouted up at me 
to get out, I told them I was fine and refused 
to leave. This is what we do: We stay and re-
port. 
One got more belligerent until another of-
ficer, a special agent in the protection divi-
sion who guards the leadership, intervened. 
He shouted over, ‘‘Scotty’s OK!’’ Two words 
is all it took (that and the obvious—they had 
their hands full with a mob on the other side 
of door). 
The officer, in plain clothes, was Lt. Mi-
chael Byrd. Moments later, outside the 
House chamber, he shot and killed protester 
Ashli Babbitt as she climbed through a bro-
ken window of a barricaded door leading to 
the Speaker’s Lobby. 
From that point on, I was the only jour-
nalist and the only person remaining in the 
balcony to witness the standoff in the House 
chamber. 
When the mob began to break the glass in 
the door, I could barely see the face of one of 
the rioters. The cops and a new congressman 
with a law enforcement background tried to 
de-escalate the situation even as guns were 
pointed at the hole in the glass. 
The room was pretty dark. I was looking 
through a long zoom lens usually used out-
doors for shooting sports or wildlife. I had 
brought it along for a little extra reach— 
closeups of faces and details during Electoral 
College voting, which is normally illumi-
nated with TV lights. 
The siege at the chamber door lasted about 
45 minutes, until tactical units moved the 
intruders away. I was then able to move 
around the balcony above the House floor to 
record the deserted room and the debris. The 
gavel used by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi 
sat on the dais, surrounded by discarded 
emergency escape hoods and debris. 
After the lawmakers and press evacuated, 
those doors were secured. For another two 
hours, I was locked in. Then an FBI tactical 
team swept through and threw me out of the 
building. 
The joint session of the House and Senate 
resumed about 9 p.m. Andy Harnik and I per-
severed through the night and finished about 
3 a.m. I went back to my office in the Senate 
Dirksen building, ate some soup and slept 
from 5 to 7 a.m. Then we started the next 
day’s coverage. 
The news went on, as it always does. 
People have given me a lot of applause in 
the past year for what I did on Jan. 6, 2021, 
for the photos I took, for refusing to leave 
during the final evacuation. But I want to 
make one thing clear: I was simply doing my 
job. As were many of my colleagues. 
AP photographers John Minchillo and 
Julio Cortez suffered the brunt of the riot as 
they bravely threw themselves between the 
mob and the police. Manny Ceneta maneu-
vered his way around the Senate side of the 
Capitol to capture Trump supporters as they 
were stopped outside the chamber. Free-
lancer Jose Luis Magana took the photos of 
demonstrators scaling the wall of the west 
side of the Capitol. Jacquelyn Martin and 
Carolyn Kaster were also at the Trump rally 
and the march to the hill. 
I was working directly with Washington 
photo editor Jon Elswick, who expedited my 
photos to the wire. Jon was patient with me 
because I was sending lots of pictures in a 
short time. This is usually not good form; we 
normally use judgment and discretion in how 
many we send in a short time so that the 
photo desk isn’t overwhelmed. 
In this case, I told Jon I was going to move 
as much as I could. Why? My previous expe-
rience in conflict zones and working around 
the military and police reminded me that 
my cameras might be destroyed by the mob 
or my disks confiscated by police. The abil-
ity to transmit from the camera ensured 
that the AP—and the world—would get the 
photos. 
The fact is, I never really came face to face 
with the mob, except through a telephoto 
lens. And it really did take every one of us 
to record this story. Most of us in the Cap-
itol that day—Getty, Reuters, AFP and oth-
ers—couldn’t move around without inter-
ference from the mob or the Capitol Police. 
Each of us covered what we could. 
The result, if you will, was like a mosaic— 
views 
from 
different 
photographers 
all 
around the Capitol that composed a more 
complete picture. 
I’ve witnessed plenty of violence and up-
heavals before, coups and revolutions, when I 
was doing conflict coverage abroad, but I am 
still shocked to experience it here. It was 
Americans attacking America. 
What I saw, and what my camera captured, 
during the standoff at the House chamber a 
year ago was this: a place where a line was 
drawn—with courage, duty and guns. 
And though they ultimately failed, in a 
very real way the rioters succeeded. It was 
an hour of anarchy, with an unchecked mob 
bringing one of the country’s most sacred 
ceremonies—and the peaceful transfer of 
power—to a screeching, scary halt. 
I often think about what might have hap-
pened if Pelosi had not called the Electoral 
College back immediately. Postponing a few 
days might have seemed the normal thing, 
but that didn’t happen. The rioters had 
mostly escaped the police. Donald Trump 
was still in the White House for two more 
weeks. Jan. 6 was one of the longest days in 
our short American history. Imagine how 
long 14 more days might have been. 
I’ve been at this a while, and I’ve learned: 
Some moments are hard to look at and some 
are hard to look away from. But whatever 
the moment might be, the job of the photo-
journalist—the responsibility—is to show 
people what they can’t see on their own. 
To do that, we have to be there.

HONORING MAJOR DAVID MONIAC 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise today to honor the 200th an-
niversary of Major David Moniac, the 
first Native American to graduate from 
the U.S. Military Academy at West 
Point. 
Today, I would like to share the in-
spiring story of Major Moniac. He was 
born in 1802 and lived near present-day 
Pintlala, within Montgomery County, 
AL. Several of Moniac’s family mem-
bers were members of the Creek Nation 
and influenced passage of the Treaty of 
New York in 1790, which declared peace 
between the Creek Nation and the 
United States. This treaty is signifi-
cant as it contained an important pro-
vision for the U.S. Government to edu-
cate four young Creek Native Ameri-
cans. Twenty-seven years later in 1817, 
David Moniac was accepted into the 
U.S. Military Academy under this pro-
vision at only 16 years old. 
Despite facing an uphill battle due to 
his age and being the only minority at 
West Point, Moniac persevered. He 
went on to graduate in the year 1822 as 
a brevet second lieutenant in the 6th 
U.S. Infantry Regiment. 
In 1836, Moniac answered the call of 
the U.S. military, to fight for our Na-
tion and aid the Army in the Second 
Seminole War occurring in Florida. 
Moniac was named captain and pro-
ceeded to organize a unit of Creek Vol-
unteers from Alabama to serve. During 
the war, this impactful Alabamian 
demonstrated true leadership as he 
commanded an assault on a Seminole 
stronghold and earned a promotion to 
major in October 1836. One month 
later, in November 1836, Major Moniac 
was killed by a musket volley at the 
Battle of Wahoo Swamp while he was 
leading a charge of Creek Volunteers. 
Moniac’s death marked the end of the 
battle. 
Major Moniac was laid to rest at a 
cemetery in Bushnell, FL, near the site 
of the Battle of Wahoo Swamp. To re-
member his incredible courage and 
bravery, the inscription on his grave 
marker states, ‘‘He was as brave and 
gallant a man as ever drew a sword or 
faced an enemy.’’ 
On November 21, 2021, Governor Kay 
Ivey presented the Alabama Distin-
guished 
Service 
Medal 
to 
Major 
Moniac’s family at the Alabama State 
Capitol. 
The 
Distinguished 
Service 
Medal recognizes exceptionally meri-
torious service to the government in a 
duty of great responsibility. 
Today, we honor Major David Moniac 
for 
his 
impact 
and 
the 
trans-
formational change that he led as he 
paved the way for other Native Ameri-
cans to receive admission to West 
Point. His legacy continues to make 
not only my home State of Alabama 
proud and grateful for his leadership 
but our entire country. It is a privilege 
to honor Major Moniac today in Con-
gress 200 years later commemorating 
his service and sacrifice.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO TREVOR O’BRIEN 
∑ Ms. HASSAN. Madam President, I 
am proud to recognize Trevor O’Brien 
of Lodonderry as January’s Granite 
Stater of the Month. When Cobblestone 
Ale House, a popular local bar in 
Keene, was destroyed by a 5-alarm fire, 
Trevor jumped into action to support 
the people in his community who were 
impacted by this devastating event.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S439 
February 1, 2022 
Trevor had previously worked at the 
ale house as a bartender for 10 years, 
and during that time, he was part of a 
vibrant community that felt to him 
like family. During his shifts, the bar 
would fill up with locals and tourists 
alike, who were there to meet up with 
old friends or make new connections. 
Trevor met his now-wife while working 
there, and he is officiating a wedding 
soon for another couple who met at the 
bar. 
When Trevor heard the news of Cob-
blestone Ale House burning down, he 
immediately knew that he had to sup-
port his community during this dif-
ficult time. He made an impromptu Go- 
Fund-Me page that he shared over so-
cial media and asked his friends to do-
nate the equivalent of one final drink 
at the bar. Within an hour donations 
were pouring in. The campaign contin-
ued to spread from person-to-person 
and has since taken off, raising nearly 
$20,000. 
The money from the Go-Fund-Me will 
be going to bar staffers to help with 
lost wages and to the tenants who lived 
above the ale house who lost belong-
ings in the fire. 
Trevor’s actions are a testament to 
him, but also reflect the determination 
to be generous, kind, and strong neigh-
bors that is a hallmark of Granite 
State character. Trevor’s decision to 
help others sparked a movement that 
will make a real difference for people 
in his community, and I am honored to 
name him as January’s Granite Stater 
of the Month.∑

RECOGNIZING REDOX BIO- 
NUTRIENTS, LLC 
∑ Mr. RISCH. Madam President, as a 
member and former chairman of the 
Senate Committee on Small Business 
and Entrepreneurship, each month I 
recognize and celebrate the American 
entrepreneurial spirit by highlighting 
the success of a small business in my 
home State of Idaho. Today, I am 
pleased to honor Redox Bio-Nutrients 
as the Idaho Small Business of the 
Month for February 2022. 
Redox Bio-Nutrients is a world-re-
nowned fertilizer producer based in the 
heart of Burley, ID. CEO Darin Moon 
spent his childhood on a family farm in 
Heyburn, ID, before starting a career in 
soil science. After several years man-
aging a farm in California, Darin re-
turned to Idaho in 1993 and founded 
Redox Bio-Nutrients, and in doing so, 
he achieved his lifelong goal of using 
science to produce more nutritious 
food. 
Darin’s business acumen and innova-
tive approach have been the corner-
stones of the business’ growth. Over 
the years, Darin’s focus on innovation 
has earned him seven patents and pro-
vided Redox’s customers with high- 
quality fertilizer that improves their 
crop yields. Today, the company sup-
plies agricultural products in over 40 
States and 32 countries, serving as a 
global testament to Idaho’s industrious 
entrepreneurial spirit. 
In addition to employing 19 Idahoans 
and 
14 
employees 
across 
multiple 
States, Darin’s commitment to the 
Burley community is evident in his 
service on the Cassia County School 
District’s school board. In 2018, he 
helped launch Connect, a district-wide 
program dedicated to connecting stu-
dents in need with mental health re-
sources and free therapy. 
Congratulations to Darin, his family, 
and all the employees of Redox Bio-Nu-
trients, LLC on being selected as the 
Idaho Small Business of the Month for 
February 2022. You make our great 
State proud, and I look forward to your 
continued growth and success.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. TESTER (for himself, Mr. 
MORAN, Ms. HASSAN, Mr. TILLIS, 
Mr. MANCHIN, Mr. SULLIVAN, 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL, Mr. BOOZMAN, 
Mrs. MURRAY, Mr. TUBERVILLE, 
Ms. HIRONO, Mr. CASSIDY, Mr. 
SANDERS, 
Mr. 
CRAMER, 
Ms. 
SINEMA, 
Mr. 
ROUNDS, 
Mr. 
BROWN, and Mrs. BLACKBURN): 
S. 3541. A bill to improve health care 
and services for veterans exposed to 
toxic substances, and for other pur-
poses; to the Committee on Veterans’ 
Affairs. 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, today I 
want to speak about a piece of bipar-
tisan 
legislation 
that 
Chairman 
TESTER
and I introduced with the 
unanimous support of every member of 
the Senate Committee on Veterans Af-
fairs, both Republicans and Democrats. 
Consensus is often hard to find, as we 
know, in this body, but caring for our 
Nation’s veterans—our heroes—has a 
way of bringing us together. I tell Kan-
sans back home that the Senate on vet-
erans affairs is one of the few places 
left on which Republicans and Demo-
crats find common ground. I hope that 
continues, and I hope that spreads. 
Caring for our Nation’s veterans is an 
honor that we all have, and when you 
reach an agreement between some of 
the most liberal members of our com-
mittee and the most conservative 
members of our committee, you know 
that you have a really good deal. 
I first learned about the issue of 
toxic exposure years ago, while attend-
ing an event for Vietnam veterans at 
home in Kansas. After hearing about 
their struggles with exposure to Agent 
Orange, I introduced the Toxic Expo-
sure Research Act, which was signed 
into law in 2016 and mandates research 
on health conditions of children and 
grandchildren of veterans who were ex-
posed to toxins during their military 
service. 
Our military veterans and their fami-
lies and their survivors know exposure 
to toxic substances has become com-
monplace in modern warfare. Regret-
tably, the negative long-term health 
effects are sometimes not identified 
until long after the time of exposure, 
leaving veterans to face serious med-
ical issues years after their service. 
Toxic exposure during military serv-
ice has created significant healthcare 
concerns for veterans, going back to 
mustard gas exposure in World War I 
and, most notably, the Vietnam gen-
eration’s exposure to Agent Orange. 
Despite these clear examples of last-
ing impact of military toxic exposures, 
struggles with health conditions asso-
ciated with burn pits continue to 
plague the latest generation of vet-
erans who served in the Global War on 
Terror. 
I have spoken with veterans across 
Kansas and held a townhall meeting in 
my home State on the effects of toxic 
exposure on our veterans’ health. My 
office continues to receive casework

S445 
February 1, 2022 
from veterans regarding the burden of 
proof to gain access to healthcare. This 
legislation—the one that our com-
mittee will consider tomorrow—lessens 
that burden and creates a pathway for 
thousands of Kansas veterans and 
many more thousands of American vet-
erans to receive healthcare for ill-
nesses caused by toxic exposure. 
For decades, toxic-exposed veterans 
have faced overwhelming barriers to 
getting VA healthcare and the services 
that they deserve. Post-911 veterans 
are the newest generation of American 
heroes to suffer from toxic exposures 
encountered in their military service. 
These American heroes who put on 
the uniform and volunteered to go into 
harm’s way on our behalf deserve to 
have 
their 
level 
of 
commitment 
matched by those of us who serve here 
in Congress. When our government 
sends troops to war, we make a pledge 
to care for them when they come home. 
Veterans who are made sick from serv-
ice deserve medical care for those con-
ditions. 
The Health Care for Burn Pit Vet-
erans Act is an important first step in 
making certain our veterans receive 
the care they need as a result of their 
service. 
I appreciate the entire Senate Vet-
erans’ Affairs Committee for working 
together to craft this consequential 
legislation to care for our servicemem-
bers who put their lives and health on 
the line for us. I also appreciate every 
member of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs 
Committee—Senators TILLIS, HASSAN, 
SULLIVAN, MANCHIN, BOOZMAN, SAND-
ERS, 
CASSIDY, 
BROWN, 
BLACKBURN, 
BLUMENTHAL, 
TUBERVILLE, 
HIRONO, 
CRAMER, 
SINEMA, 
and 
ROUNDS—for 
working together to better the lives of 
those who have served. Additionally, I 
am grateful for the support of many 
VSOs—veterans service organizations— 
that represent millions of veterans 
across the Nation. 
This legislation is part of a com-
prehensive and phased approach. This 
first phase provides the VA with the 
authority 
it 
needs 
to 
expand 
healthcare for combat veterans. For 
many who are sick and suffering, time 
is running out, and our first priority is 
to get these veterans their healthcare 
now. 
Our bill would also mandate training 
for the VA healthcare providers and 
benefit specialists to ensure a level of 
competence across the Department to 
make sure veterans receive exemplary 
treatment and service. 
Our legislation would direct the VA 
to incorporate a clinical screening to 
inquire about a veteran’s potential ex-
posures and symptoms commonly asso-
ciated with toxic exposure. 
I talked to a veteran today who said 
she has been to the VA twice for care 
and treatment and has never been 
asked about whether she encountered 
any substance that could have been 
damaging to her health during her 
service. After speaking with these vet-
erans, I have come to understand that 
this basic and preventive act of screen-
ing is not part of enrollment or basic 
care provided by the Department. That 
must change. 
Solutions to this complex problem 
cannot be generated by Congress alone 
and require a coordinated and system-
atic approach that involves partnering 
with the VA. My view is that we make 
a commitment to those who serve that 
we will do our work. This is a signifi-
cant step in getting us to a point at 
which we are living up to that commit-
ment and doing it in a way that is not 
damaging to any other veteran. 
I urge my colleagues to read our bill, 
to grow their understanding of this 
complex challenge, and to join our 
committee, every single member of the 
committee, in passing this bill to get 
one step closer to providing care and 
relief on one of the most pressing chal-
lenges facing veterans today. 
By Mr. MCCONNELL (for himself, 
Mr. PAUL, Mr. LEE, Ms. SINEMA, 
Mr. BRAUN, and Mr. OSSOFF): 
S. 3545. A bill to require the Director 
of the Bureau of Prisons to be ap-

mittee on the Judiciary. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask

Whereas the United States abolished the 
transatlantic slave trade in 1808 and abol-
ished chattel slavery and prohibited involun-
tary servitude in 1865; 
Whereas, because the people of the United 
States remain committed to protecting indi-

modern slavery, which is commonly consid-
ered to mean—

(1) the recruitment, harboring, transpor-
tation, provision, or obtaining of an indi-
vidual through the use of force, fraud, or co-
ercion for the purpose of subjecting that in-
dividual to involuntary servitude, peonage, 
debt bondage, or slavery; or 
(2) the inducement of a commercial sex act 
by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the 
individual induced to perform that act is 
younger than 18 years of age; 
Whereas forced labor and human traf-
ficking generates revenues of approximately 
$150,000,000,000 annually worldwide, and there 
are an estimated 40,000,000 victims of human 
trafficking and modern slavery across the 
globe; 
Whereas victims of human trafficking are 
difficult to identify and are subject to ma-
nipulation, force, fraud, coercion, and abuse; 
Whereas the Department of Justice has re-
ported that human trafficking and modern 
slavery has been reported and investigated in 
each of the 50 States and the District of Co-
lumbia; 
Whereas the Department of State has re-
ported that the top 3 countries of origin of 
federally identified human trafficking vic-
tims in the United States in fiscal year 2020 
were the United States, Mexico, and Hon-
duras; 
Whereas, to help businesses in the United 
States combat child labor and forced labor in 
global supply chains, the Department of 
Labor has identified 156 goods from 77 coun-
tries that are made by child labor and forced 
labor; 
Whereas, since 2007, the National Human 
Trafficking Hotline has identified nearly 
74,000 cases of human trafficking; 
Whereas, of the more than 26,500 endan-
gered runaways reported to the National 
Center for Missing and Exploited Children in 
2020, 1 in 6 were likely child sex trafficking 
victims; 
Whereas youth experiencing homelessness 
experience high rates of human trafficking 
and 1 in 5 homeless youths is a victim of sex 
trafficking, labor trafficking, or both; 
Whereas the Administration for Native 
Americans of the Department of Health and 
Human Services reports that American In-
dian, Alaska Native, and Pacific Islander 
women and girls have a heightened risk for 
sex trafficking; 
Whereas the Department of Justice found 
that studies on the topic of human traf-
ficking of American Indians and Alaska Na-
tives suggest there are— 
(1) high rates of sexual exploitation of Na-
tive women and girls; 
(2) gaps in data and research on trafficking 
of American Indian and Alaska Native vic-
tims; and 
(3) barriers that prevent law enforcement 
agencies and victim service providers from 
identifying and responding appropriately to 
Native victims; 
Whereas, according to the Government Ac-
countability Office, from fiscal year 2013 
through fiscal year 2016, there were only 14 
Federal investigations and 2 Federal pros-
ecutions of human trafficking offenses in In-
dian country; 
Whereas, to combat human trafficking and 
modern slavery in the United States and 
globally, the people of the United States, the 
Federal Government, and State, Tribal, and 
local governments must be— 
(1) aware of the realities of human traf-
ficking and modern slavery; and 
(2) dedicated to stopping the horrific enter-
prise of human trafficking and modern slav-
ery; 
Whereas the United States should hold ac-
countable all individuals, groups, organiza-
tions, governments, and countries that sup-
port, advance, or commit acts of human traf-
ficking and modern slavery; 
Whereas, through education, the United 
States must also work to end human traf-
ficking and modern slavery in all forms in 
the United States and around the world; 
Whereas victims of human trafficking de-
serve a trauma-informed approach that inte-
grates the pursuit of justice and provision of 
social services designed to help them escape, 
and recover from, the physical, mental, emo-
tional, and spiritual trauma they endured; 
Whereas combating human trafficking re-
quires a whole-of-government effort that 
rests on a unified and coordinated response 
among Federal, State, Tribal, and local 
agencies and that places equal value on the 
prevention of trafficking, the identification 
and stabilization of victims, and the inves-
tigation and prosecution of traffickers; 
Whereas laws to prosecute perpetrators of 
human trafficking and to assist and protect 
victims of human trafficking and modern 
slavery have been enacted in the United 
States, including— 
(1) the Trafficking Victims Protection Act 
of 2000 (22 U.S.C. 7101 et seq.); 
(2) title XII of the Violence Against Women 
Reauthorization Act of 2013 (Public Law 113– 
4; 127 Stat. 136); 
(3) the Justice for Victims of Trafficking 
Act of 2015 (Public Law 114–22; 129 Stat. 227); 
(4) sections 910 and 914(e) of the Trade Fa-
cilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 
(Public Law 114–125; 130 Stat. 239 and 274); 
(5) section 1298 of the National Defense Au-

Whereas the Justice for Victims of Traf-
ficking Act of 2015 (Public Law 114–22; 129 
Stat. 227) established the United States Ad-
visory Council on Human Trafficking to pro-
vide a formal platform for survivors of 
human trafficking to advise and make rec-
ommendations on Federal anti-trafficking 
policies to the Interagency Task Force to 
Monitor and Combat Trafficking established 
by the President; 
Whereas the Department of Defense, the 
General Services Administration, and the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administra-
tion issued a final rule (80 Fed. Reg. 4967) to 
implement Executive Order 13627, entitled 
‘‘Strengthening Protections Against Traf-
ficking in Persons in Federal Contracts’’, 
that clarifies the policy of the United States 
on combating trafficking in persons as out-
lined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation 
by strengthening the prohibition on contrac-
tors from charging employee recruitment 
fees; 
Whereas, although such laws and regula-
tions are currently in force, it is essential to 
increase 
public 
awareness, 
particularly 
among individuals who are most likely to 
come into contact with victims of human 
trafficking and modern slavery, regarding 
conditions and dynamics of human traf-
ficking and modern slavery, precisely be-
cause traffickers use techniques that are de-
signed to severely limit self-reporting and 
evade law enforcement; 
Whereas January 1 is the anniversary of 
the effective date of the Emancipation Proc-
lamation; 
Whereas February 1 is— 
(1) the anniversary of the date on which 
President Abraham Lincoln signed the joint 
resolution sending the 13th Amendment to 
the Constitution of the United States to the 
States for ratification to forever declare, 
‘‘Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, 
except as a punishment for crime whereof 
the party shall have been duly convicted, 
shall exist within the United States, or any 
place subject to their jurisdiction’’; and 
(2) a date that has long been celebrated as 
National Freedom Day, as described in sec-
tion 124 of title 36, United States Code; and 
Whereas, under the authority of Congress 
to enforce the 13th Amendment to the Con-
stitution of the United States ‘‘by appro-
priate legislation’’, Congress, through the 
Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 
(22 U.S.C. 7101 et seq.), updated the post-Civil 
War involuntary servitude and slavery stat-
utes and adopted an approach of victim pro-
tection, vigorous prosecution, and preven-
tion of human trafficking, commonly known 
as the ‘‘3P’’ approach: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate supports— 
(1) observing National Trafficking and 
Modern Slavery Prevention Month during 
the period beginning on January 1, 2022, and 
ending on February 1, 2022, to recognize the 
vital role that the people of the United 
States have in ending human trafficking and 
modern slavery; 
(2) marking the observation of National 
Trafficking and Modern Slavery Prevention 
Month with appropriate programs and activi-
ties, culminating in the observance on Feb-
ruary 1, 2022, of National Freedom Day, as 
described in section 124 of title 36, United 
States Code; 
(3) urging continued partnerships with 
Federal, State, Tribal, and local agencies, as 
well as social service providers and nonprofit 
organizations to address human trafficking 
with a collaborative, victim-centered ap-
proach; and 
(4) all other efforts to prevent, eradicate, 
and raise awareness of, and opposition to, 
human trafficking and modern slavery.

Whereas more public awareness of the 
issue of parental choice in education can in-
form additional families of the benefits of 
proactively 
choosing 
challenging, 
moti-
vating, and effective education environments 
for their children; 
Whereas the process by which parents 
choose schools for their children is non-
political, nonpartisan, and deserves the ut-

Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic has exac-

OSSOFF, Mr. WYDEN, Mr. DURBIN, Mr. 
SULLIVAN, Mr. CRUZ, Mr. BRAUN, Mr. 
SCOTT
of Florida, Mr. TILLIS, Mr. 
WICKER, and Mr. MORAN) submitted the 
following resolution; which was consid-
ered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 502 
Whereas, President Franklin D. Roosevelt 
established the Women Accepted for Volun-
teer Emergency Service (referred to in this 
preamble as ‘‘WAVES’’) on July 30, 1942, 
when he signed the Act of July 30, 1942 (56 
Stat. 730, chapter 538) into law; 
Whereas, despite social stigmas and public 
opinion averse to women in uniform, women 
applied for WAVES in such numbers that en-
rollment ceilings were reached within the 
first several years; 
Whereas, while women had served in the 
enlisted ranks of the Navy in a variety of po-
sitions during World War I, legislation 
passed after World War I limited women to 
service as nurses until the creation of the 
WAVES; 
Whereas, during World War II, women in 
the United States were recruited into the 
Armed Forces to perform military assign-
ments so that men could be freed for combat 
duties; 
Whereas, under the direction of Lieutenant 
Commander (later Captain) Mildred Helen 
McAfee, the WAVES peaked in 1945 at nearly 
80,000 officers and enlisted personnel, or ap-
proximately 2.5 percent of the wartime 
strength of the Navy and was composed of 
women from urban and rural communities 
across many socioeconomic backgrounds; 
Whereas, the Secretary of the Navy’s An-
nual Report Fiscal Year 1945 stated that 
there were 8,475 officers and 73,816 enlisted 
WAVES serving in the spring of 1945; 
Whereas the WAVES worked at large and 
small naval commands from Florida to 
Washington and from California to Rhode Is-
land, as well as overseas; 
Whereas the WAVES numerous and diverse 
contributions ranged from yeoman, chauf-
feur, and baker to pharmacist, artist, air-
craft mechanic, and dental hygienist; 
Whereas during World War II, WAVES 
served as training instructors throughout 
the country for newly recruited WAVES as 
well as thousands of aspiring male naval avi-
ators, gunners, and navigators destined for 
combat units; 
Whereas the WAVES who served in naval 
aviation taught instrument flying, aircraft 
recognition, celestial navigation, aircraft 
gunnery, radio, radar, air combat informa-
tion, and air fighter administration but were 
not allowed to be pilots; 
Whereas the WAVES served the Navy in 
such numbers that, according to a Navy esti-
mate, enough men were freed for combat 
duty to crew the ships of 4 major task forces, 
each including a battleship, 2 large aircraft 
carriers, 2 heavy cruisers, 4 light cruisers, 
and 15 destroyers; 
Whereas, at the end of World War II, Sec-
retary of the Navy James Forrestal stated 
that members of the WAVES ‘‘have exceeded 
performance of men in certain types of work, 
and the Navy Department considers it to be 
very desirable that these important services 
rendered by women during the war should 
likewise be available in postwar years 
ahead’’; 
Whereas, by the end of World War II, more 
than 400,000 women had served the United 
States in military capacities, with every 
Navy aviator who entered combat having re-
ceived some part of his training from a 
WAVE; 
Whereas the WAVES, despite their merit 
and the recognized value and importance of 
their contributions to the war effort, were 
not given status equal to their male counter-
parts, and struggled for years to receive the 
appreciation of Congress and the people of 
the United States; 
Whereas the WAVES helped to catalyze the 
social, demographic, and economic evo-
lutions that occurred in the 1960s and 1970s 
and continue to this day; and 
Whereas the pioneering women who served 
in the WAVES are owed a great debt of grati-
tude for their service to the United States: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) honors the women who served the 
United States in the Navy Women Accepted 
for 
Voluntary 
Emergency 
Service 
(‘‘WAVES’’) during World War II; 
(2) commends the WAVES who, through a 
sense of duty and willingness to defy stereo-
types and social pressures, performed mili-
tary assignments to aid the war effort, with 
the result that men were freed for combat 
duties; and 
(3) recognizes that the WAVES, by serving 
with diligence and merit, not only opened up 
opportunities for women that had previously 
been reserved for men, but also contributed 
vitally to the victory of the United States 
and the Allies in World War II.

for those elected to serve in parliament 
to resume their duties without impedi-

lows: 
Strike the preamble and insert the fol-
lowing: 
Whereas, on February 1, 2021, the military 
of Burma (the ‘‘Tatmadaw’’) and its aligned 
Union Solidarity and Development Party 
(USDP) conducted a military coup against 
the civilian government hours before Par-
liament was to convene in a new session, re-
sulting in the military junta illegally de-
taining State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, 
President Win Myint, and members of Par-
liament, as well as pro-democracy activists 
from the 88 Generation and other civil soci-
ety leaders; 
Whereas, 
since 
February 
1, 
2021, 
the 
Tatmadaw has detained more than 11,000 
people for exercising their rights of freedom 
of speech and assembly and killed more than 
1,400 civilians, including children; 
Whereas the Tatmadaw has put the demo-
cratically-elected 
civilian 
leadership 
of 
Burma, including President Win Myint and 
State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, through 
sham trials for fabricated crimes and sen-
tenced them to lengthy prison terms in order 
to remove them from political competition; 
Whereas the Tatmadaw has become the 
world’s second largest detainer of journal-
ists, with over 100 journalists imprisoned 
since the military coup; 
Whereas the Tatmadaw’s actions have 
driven hundreds of thousands from their 
homes and driven thousands to flee across 
Burma’s borders into Thailand, India, and 
Bangladesh; 
Whereas fighting between the Tatmadaw 
and several ethnic armed groups continues, 
with government forces committing in-
creased abuses against ethnic Karen, Kayah, 
Kachin, Chin, Rakhine, Shan, and Rohingya 
minority populations; 
Whereas the Tatmadaw restricted freedom 
of movement, telecommunications, and the 
media, limiting access to information to and 
from Burma during a political and public 
health crisis; 
Whereas senior generals of the Tatmadaw 
have been sanctioned by the United States 
Government for serious human rights abuses 
and for their role in the coup and are subject 
to ongoing investigations into their conduct 
by the International Criminal Court and the 
International Court of Justice; 
Whereas, on January 28, 2021, the Union 
Election Commission rejected allegations by 
the Tatmadaw that fraud played a signifi-
cant role in determining the outcome of the 
November 2020 elections; 
Whereas Burma’s November 8, 2020, elec-
tions resulted in the National League for De-
mocracy party securing enough seats in Par-
liament to form the next government; 
Whereas the Tatmadaw has a long history 
of committing atrocities against the people 
of Burma, including the targeting of specific 
ethnic groups; and 
Whereas senior United States officials 
have committed to making a determination 
of whether such atrocities constitute geno-
cide: Now, therefore, be it

CONDEMNING THE MILITARY COUP 
THAT 
TOOK 
PLACE 
ON 
FEB-
RUARY 1, 2021, IN BURMA 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent the Senate pro-
ceed to the immediate consideration of 
Calendar No. 26 S. Res. 35. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The clerk will report the resolution 
by title. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 35) condemning the 
military coup that took place on February 1, 
2021, in Burma and the Burmese military’s 
detention of civilian leaders, calling for an 
immediate and unconditional release of all 
those detained and for those elected to serve 
in parliament to resume their duties without 
impediment, and for other purposes. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolution, 
which had been reported from the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations, with an 
amendment to strike all after the re-
solving clause and insert the part 
printed in italic, and with an amend-
ment to strike the preamble and insert 
the part printed in italic, as follows: 
S. RES. 35 
Whereas Burma’s November 8, 2020, elections 
resulted in the National League for Democracy 
party securing enough seats in Parliament to 
form the next government, notwithstanding the 
disenfranchisement of more than 1,500,000 vot-
ers, mostly from ethnic minority communities in 
Kachin, Karen, Mon, Rakhine, Shan, and Chin 
states; 
Whereas, on January 28, 2021, the Union Elec-
tion Commission rejected allegations by the mili-
tary of Burma (the ‘‘Tatmadaw’’) that fraud 
played a significant role in determining the out-
come of the November 2020 elections; 
Whereas, on February 1, 2021, the Tatmadaw 
and its aligned Union Solidarity and Develop-
ment Party (‘‘USDP’’) conducted a military 
coup against the civilian government hours be-
fore Parliament was to convene in a new ses-
sion, resulting in the military junta illegally de-
taining State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, 
President Win Myint, and members of Par-
liament, as well as pro-democracy activists from 
the 88 Generation and other civil society lead-
ers; 
Whereas the Tatmadaw restricted freedom of 
movement, telecommunications, and the media, 
limiting access to information to and from 
Burma during a political and public health cri-
sis; 
Whereas senior generals of the Tatmadaw 
have been sanctioned by the United States Gov-
ernment for serious human rights abuses and for 
their role in the coup and are subject to ongoing 
investigations into their conduct by the Inter-
national Criminal Court and the International 
Court of Justice; 
Whereas, since August 25, 2017, 740,000 
Rohingya have fled northern Rakhine State to 
neighboring Bangladesh to escape a systematic 
campaign of atrocities by Burma’s military and 
security forces, and over three years later, con-
ditions are still not conducive to the safe, vol-
untary, and dignified return of the Rohingya to 
Burma; 
Whereas, according to the Department of 
State’s August 24, 2018, report entitled ‘‘Docu-
mentation of Atrocities in Northern Rakhine 
State’’, violence committed by the Burmese mili-
tary (Tatmadaw) against the Rohingya, includ-
ing from August to October 2017, was not only 
‘‘extreme, large-scale, widespread, and seem-
ingly geared toward both terrorizing the popu-
lation and driving out the Rohingya residents,’’ 
but also ‘‘well-planned and coordinated’’; 
Whereas, on August 28, 2018, the United 
States Ambassador to the United Nations told 
the United Nations Security Council that the 
Department of State report’s findings were 
‘‘consistent with’’ those in an August 27, 2018, 
report by the Independent International Fact- 
Finding Mission on Myanmar (IIFFMM) which 
urged that top Burmese military officials be in-
vestigated and prosecuted for genocide; and 
Whereas Secretary of State Antony Blinken 
committed at his nomination hearing before the 
Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate 
on January 19, 2021, and in subsequent written 
responses to questions for the record, that he 
will oversee an interagency review of whether 
the atrocities committed against the Rohingya 
in Burma constitute genocide: Now therefore be 
it 
That the Senate— 
(1) supports the people of Burma in their am-
bition for a genuine democracy, sustainable 
peace and genuine ethnic reconciliation, and 
the realization of fundamental human rights for 
all, including for ethnic minorities whose 
human rights have been violated repeatedly and 
who have been disenfranchised historically; 
(2) calls on the military junta to— 
(A) immediately and unconditionally release 
all those detained as a result of the military 
coup on February 1, 2021; 
(B) immediately restore all forms of commu-
nications, including access to the internet with-
out surveillance; 
(C) remove all impediments to free travel that 
have been imposed as a result of the coup; 
(D) return to power all members of the civilian 
government elected in the November 8, 2020, 
elections and allow them to fulfill their mandate 
without impediment; 
(E) allow for freedom of expression, including 
the right to protest, peaceful assembly, press 
freedom, and freedom of movement; and 
(F) allow unfettered reporting from local, na-
tional, and international media; 
(3) calls on social media companies to suspend 
the accounts of USDP and Tatmadaw military 
leaders that have used their platforms to spread 
disinformation, fear, and psychological violence; 
(4) supports the use of all diplomatic and de-
velopment tools to ensure that vulnerable 
groups, including ethnic and religious minori-
ties, as well as all children, youth, and teachers 
in educational settings are safe, and schools 
and universities are not targeted for attacks or 
use by the military;

February 1, 2022 
(5) expresses grave concern for the safety and 
security of hundreds of thousands of Rohingya 
refugees who previously fled the Tatmadaw, 
and now face challenging conditions in camps 
like Cox’s Bazar and Bhasan Char in Ban-
gladesh or risk being turned away or moved into 
holding centers in other neighboring countries; 
(6) calls on the President, the Secretary of 
State, and the Secretary of Defense to fully im-
plement section 7008 of the Department of State, 
Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Ap-
propriations Act, 2021 (division K of Public Law 
116–260) and any similar or successor law gov-
erning United States foreign assistance fol-
lowing a coup d’etat, and to immediately— 
(A) impose targeted restrictions aimed at the 
Tatmadaw, military-owned or controlled enter-
prises, and those responsible for the February 1, 
2021, coup; 
(B) work with the international community, 
including at the United Nations Security Coun-
cil, with United States allies in the region, and 
with the Association of Southeast Asian Na-
tions, to condemn the coup and take steps to en-
sure that international economic engagement in 
Burma does not contribute to human rights 
abuses and enrich individuals connected to the 
coup; 
(C) support conditionality on diplomatic, eco-
nomic, and security relations with Burma, in-
cluding using the voice and vote of the United 
States at multilateral development institutions, 
until all those detained in the February 1, 2021, 
coup are released and there has been a full res-
toration of civilian-controlled parliament re-
specting the November 8, 2020, election results; 
and 
(D) utilize the United States Government’s po-
sition on the United Nations Security Council to 
bring about greater international cooperation in 
the pursuit of justice and accountability in 
Burma; and 
(7) urges the Secretary of State to swiftly con-
duct an Interagency Process and issue a deter-
mination as to whether the crimes committed by 
the Burmese military against the Rohingya be-
ginning in August 2017 constitute crimes against 
humanity or genocide. 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I 
rise today to speak about the terrible 
tragedy that befell the people of Burma 
1 year ago today, when the Tatmadaw, 
the Burmese military, reclaimed total 
power in the coup d’etat of February 1, 
2021. Since then, the military has 
waged a brutal campaign against its 
own people, a people that has nonethe-
less stood up to challenge the crack-
down 
through 
civil 
disobedience, 
strikes, and protests. And when that 
failed to move the junta, the people of 
Burma have been forced to resort to 
military action against their oppres-
sors. 
Burma is a complex, polyglot society 
made up of many ethnic groups and re-
ligious tradition. Yet the one thing 
that seems to have united a wide cross- 
section of the Burmese people has been 
this violent rupture of what for more 
than decade had been a fitful trend to-
ward 
increasing 
democratization. 
Today, the opposition to the military 
has galvanized the people to such an 
extent that organized resistance has 
turned to increasingly well-organized 
paramilitary action against the mili-
tary and its institutions of repression. 
As authoritarianism grows around 
the world, we must work with like- 
minded nations to fight corruption, 
protect human rights, increase trans-
parency, and work with civil society to 
defend democracy and the freedom of 
marginalized people around the world. 
Throughout its independence, Bur-
ma’s history has suffered decades of re-
pressive military rule and civil war 
with ethnic minority groups, and what 
we are seeing today in Burma is no dif-
ferent. 
The February 1 military coup and the 
capture of elected government officials 
in Burma was a clear attack on the 
democratic process of free and fair 
elections and the will of the Burmese 
people. This affront poses a direct 
threat to the ongoing stability of the 
country, its economy, and the health 
and welfare of its citizens. On the very 
same day the newly elected Parliament 
was set to assume office, the Burmese 
military, the Tatmadaw, staged a coup 
rather than see their grip on power and 
corrupt gains threatened by the will of 
the Burmese people. 
Since the coup took place, Burma’s 
human rights situation has deterio-
rated exponentially. The military has 
detained over 11,000 people for exer-
cising their right to freedom of speech 
and assembly and killed more than 
1,400 
civilians, 
including 
children. 
Fighting between Myanmar’s military 
and several ethnic armed groups con-
tinued, with government forces com-
mitting increased abuses against eth-
nic 
Kachin, 
Karen, 
Kayah, 
Chin, 
Rakhine, Rohingya, and Shan minority 
populations. Military and police abuses 
were amplified with arbitrary arrests, 
detention, torture, and killings in cus-
tody. These actions by the military 
have driven hundreds of thousands 
from their homes and thousands more 
to flee across Burma’s borders into 
Thailand, India, and Bangladesh. 
We have also seen the Tatmadaw put 
the 
democratically 
elected 
civilian 
leadership of Burma, including Presi-
dent Win Myint and State Counsellor 
Aung San Suu Kyi, through sham trials 
for fabricated crimes and sentenced 
them to lengthy prison terms in order 
to remove them from political com-
petition. 
On February 4, just 3 days after the 
coup, I introduced this resolution with 
Senator YOUNG condemning the mili-
tary’s February 1 military coup. The 
resolution has been revised through 
amendments offered by colleagues and 
updated to reflect recent events. It re-
tains the same essential message, call-
ing for the immediate and uncondi-
tional release of all those detained and 
for elected officials to be allowed to re-
sume their duties without impediment. 
I was heartened to see President 
Biden take action through a series of 
executive orders since last February. I 
am especially pleased to see that the 
Biden administration has issued sanc-
tions in coordination with our allies. 
This is not something the U.S. should 
be acting on unilaterally. 
It is imperative that we move for-
ward with a floor vote on this resolu-
tion, and I am hopeful that we can do 
the same in the coming days on the bill 
I introduced in October, the BURMA 
Act. 
This important legislation authorizes 
the President to impose sanctions on 
individuals and entities who helped 
stage the February 1 coup d’etat in 
Burma and are responsible for the sub-
sequent repression of fundamental free-
doms, perpetuation of human rights 
abuses, use of indiscriminate violence 
towards civilians, and other gross 
atrocities. 
Additionally, the bill authorizes in-
creased humanitarian assistance for 
Rohingya refugees and provides sup-
port for civil society and independent 
media; 
prohibits 
the 
import 
of 
gemstones from Burma into the U.S.; 
calls for the United States to pressure 
the United Nations to take more deci-
sive action with regards to Burma; and 
requests a genocide determination re-
garding 
the 
persecution 
of 
the 
Rohingya. 
It is important for the international 
community to continue to pressure the 
military junta to restore democracy 
for the people of Burma. The behavior 
of the Tatmadaw has not and will not 
change without concrete and robust ac-
tions from the international commu-
nity to bring justice, accountability, 
and restore democracy. 
I remain committed to continuing to 
work with the Biden administration 
and my colleagues in Congress to en-
sure that the U.S. and international re-
sponse to the military coup is coordi-
nated and targeted to have a strong 
impact on those responsible, while also 
encouraging a peaceful transition of 
power back to the civilian government. 
I continue to stand in solidarity with 
the people of Burma and condemn the 
ongoing violence against them. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. I further ask that 
the committee-reported amendment to 
the resolution be withdrawn, and the 
amendment to the resolution which is 
at the desk be considered and agreed 
to. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The committee-reported amendment, 
in the nature of a substitute, was with-
drawn. 
The amendment (No. 4918), in the na-
ture of a substitute, was agreed to as 
follows: 
(Purpose: In the nature of a substitute) 
Strike all after the resolving clause and in-
sert the following: ‘‘That the Senate— 
(1) supports the people of Burma in their 
ambition for democracy, sustainable peace, 
and genuine ethnic and religious reconcili-
ation, and the realization of internationally 
recognized human rights for all, including 
for ethnic and religious groups whose human 
rights have been violated repeatedly and who 
have been disenfranchised historically; 
(2) calls on the Tatmadaw to— 
(A) immediately and unconditionally re-
lease all political prisoners detained as a re-
sult of the military coup on February 1, 2021; 
(B) immediately restore all forms of com-
munications, including access to the inter-
net without surveillance; 
(C) immediately end the use of violence 
and allow for a legal process for account-
ability and justice for those unlawfully de-
tained, injured, and killed by the Tatmadaw; 
(D) remove all impediments to free travel 
that have been imposed as a result of the 
coup;

crimes 
committed 
by

Mr. MENENDEZ. I know of no fur-
ther debate on the resolution. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
further debate? 
Hearing none, the question is on 
adoption of the resolution, as amended. 
The resolution (S. Res. 35), as amend-
ed, was agreed to. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. I further ask that 
the committee-reported amendment to 
the preamble be withdrawn; that the 
amendment to the preamble, which is 
at the desk, be considered and agreed 
to; that the preamble, as amended, be 
agreed to; that the amendment to the 
title be considered and agreed to; and 
that the motions to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table 
with no intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The committee-reported amendment 
to the preamble, in the nature of a sub-
stitute, was withdrawn. 
The amendment (No. 4919), in the na-
ture of a substitute, was agreed to as 
follows: 
(Purpose: To amend the preamble) 
Strike the preamble and insert the fol-
lowing: 
Whereas, on February 1, 2021, the military 
of Burma (the ‘‘Tatmadaw’’) and its aligned 
Union Solidarity and Development Party 
(USDP) conducted a military coup against 
the civilian government hours before Par-
liament was to convene in a new session, re-
sulting in the military junta illegally de-
taining State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, 
President Win Myint, and members of Par-
liament, as well as pro-democracy activists 
from the 88 Generation and other civil soci-
ety leaders; 
Whereas, 
since 
February 
1, 
2021, 
the 
Tatmadaw has detained more than 11,000 
people for exercising their rights of freedom 
of speech and assembly and killed more than 
1,400 civilians, including children; 
Whereas the Tatmadaw has put the demo-
cratically-elected 
civilian 
leadership 
of 
Burma, including President Win Myint and 
State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, through 
sham trials for fabricated crimes and sen-
tenced them to lengthy prison terms in order 
to remove them from political competition; 
Whereas the Tatmadaw has become the 
world’s second largest detainer of journal-
ists, with over 100 journalists imprisoned 
since the military coup; 
Whereas the Tatmadaw’s actions have 
driven hundreds of thousands from their 
homes and driven thousands to flee across 
Burma’s borders into Thailand, India, and 
Bangladesh; 
Whereas fighting between the Tatmadaw 
and several ethnic armed groups continues, 
with government forces committing in-
creased abuses against ethnic Karen, Kayah, 
Kachin, Chin, Rakhine, Shan, and Rohingya 
minority populations; 
Whereas the Tatmadaw restricted freedom 
of movement, telecommunications, and the 
media, limiting access to information to and 
from Burma during a political and public 
health crisis; 
Whereas senior generals of the Tatmadaw 
have been sanctioned by the United States 
Government for serious human rights abuses 
and for their role in the coup and are subject 
to ongoing investigations into their conduct 
by the International Criminal Court and the 
International Court of Justice; 
Whereas, on January 28, 2021, the Union 
Election Commission rejected allegations by 
the Tatmadaw that fraud played a signifi-
cant role in determining the outcome of the 
November 2020 elections; 
Whereas Burma’s November 8, 2020, elec-
tions resulted in the National League for De-
mocracy party securing enough seats in Par-
liament to form the next government; 
Whereas the Tatmadaw has a long history 
of committing atrocities against the people 
of Burma, including the targeting of specific 
ethnic groups; and 
Whereas senior United States officials 
have committed to making a determination 
of whether such atrocities constitute geno-
cide: Now, therefore, be it 
The 
preamble, 
as 
amended, 
was 
agreed to. 
The title amendment (No. 4920) was 
agreed to as follows: 
(Purpose: To amend the title) 
Amend the title so as to read: ‘‘A resolu-
tion condemning the military coup that took 
place on February 1, 2021, in Burma and the 
Tatmadaw’s detention of civilian leaders, 
calling for an immediate and unconditional 
release of all those detained, promoting ac-
countability and justice for those killed by 
the Tatmadaw, and calling for those elected

The resolution, as amended, with its 
preamble, as amended, reads as follows: 
S. RES. 35 
Whereas, on February 1, 2021, the military 
of Burma (the ‘‘Tatmadaw’’) and its aligned 
Union Solidarity and Development Party 
(USDP) conducted a military coup against 
the civilian government hours before Par-
liament was to convene in a new session, re-
sulting in the military junta illegally de-
taining State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, 
President Win Myint, and members of Par-
liament, as well as pro-democracy activists 
from the 88 Generation and other civil soci-
ety leaders; 
Whereas, 
since 
February 
1, 
2021, 
the 
Tatmadaw has detained more than 11,000 
people for exercising their rights of freedom 
of speech and assembly and killed more than 
1,400 civilians, including children; 
Whereas the Tatmadaw has put the demo-
cratically-elected 
civilian 
leadership 
of 
Burma, including President Win Myint and 
State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, through 
sham trials for fabricated crimes and sen-
tenced them to lengthy prison terms in order 
to remove them from political competition; 
Whereas the Tatmadaw has become the 
world’s second largest detainer of journal-
ists, with over 100 journalists imprisoned 
since the military coup; 
Whereas the Tatmadaw’s actions have 
driven hundreds of thousands from their 
homes and driven thousands to flee across

Burma’s borders into Thailand, India, and 
Bangladesh; 
Whereas fighting between the Tatmadaw 
and several ethnic armed groups continues, 
with government forces committing in-
creased abuses against ethnic Karen, Kayah, 
Kachin, Chin, Rakhine, Shan, and Rohingya 
minority populations; 
Whereas the Tatmadaw restricted freedom 
of movement, telecommunications, and the 
media, limiting access to information to and 
from Burma during a political and public 
health crisis; 
Whereas senior generals of the Tatmadaw 
have been sanctioned by the United States 
Government for serious human rights abuses 
and for their role in the coup and are subject 
to ongoing investigations into their conduct 
by the International Criminal Court and the 
International Court of Justice; 
Whereas, on January 28, 2021, the Union 
Election Commission rejected allegations by 
the Tatmadaw that fraud played a signifi-
cant role in determining the outcome of the 
November 2020 elections; 
Whereas Burma’s November 8, 2020, elec-
tions resulted in the National League for De-
mocracy party securing enough seats in Par-
liament to form the next government; 
Whereas the Tatmadaw has a long history 
of committing atrocities against the people 
of Burma, including the targeting of specific 
ethnic groups; and 
Whereas senior United States officials 
have committed to making a determination 
of whether such atrocities constitute geno-
cide: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the people of Burma in their 
ambition for democracy, sustainable peace,

ation, and the realization of internationally 
recognized human rights for all, including 
for ethnic and religious groups whose human 
rights have been violated repeatedly and who 
have been disenfranchised historically; 
(2) calls on the Tatmadaw to— 
(A) immediately and unconditionally re-

coup;

and 
(G) allow unfettered reporting from local,

pend the accounts of the Union Solidarity 
and Development Party and the Tatmadaw 
that have used their platforms to spread 
disinformation, fear, and psychological vio-
lence; 
(4) supports the use of all diplomatic, eco-
nomic, and development tools to ensure that 
vulnerable groups, including ethnic and reli-
gious groups, as well as all children, youth, 
and teachers in educational settings are safe, 
and schools and universities are not targeted 
for attacks or use by the Tatmadaw; 
(5) expresses grave concern for the safety 
and security of hundreds of thousands of in-
ternally displaced persons (referred to in this 
resolution as ‘‘IDPs’’) and refugees who have 
been displaced by the Tatmadaw and now 
face challenging conditions in camps; 
(6) expresses grave concern for the 3,000,000 
people of Burma who are in need of humani-

Burma, of which 165,000 remain in the south-
east, adding to those already displaced in 
Rakhine, Chin, Shan and Kachin states;

tries, including Thailand, India, and Ban-
gladesh, to meaningfully assist refugees who 
have fled and continue to flee the Tatmadaw;

State, and the Secretary of Defense to fully 
implement section 7008 of the Department of 
State, Foreign Operations, and Related Pro-
grams Appropriations Act, 2021 (division K of 
Public Law 116–260) and any similar or suc-
cessor law governing United States foreign 
assistance following a coup d’etat, and to im-
mediately— 
(A) impose targeted restrictions aimed at 
the Tatmadaw, military-owned or controlled 
enterprises, and those responsible for the 
February 1, 2021, coup; 
(B) work with the international commu-
nity, including at the United Nations Secu-
rity Council, with United States allies in the 
region, and with the Association of South-
east Asian Nations, to condemn the coup, 
delegitimize the junta, and take steps to en-
sure that international economic engage-
ment in Burma does not contribute to 
human rights abuses and benefit individuals 
connected to the coup; 
(C) support conditionality on diplomatic, 
economic, 
and 
security 
relations 
with 
Burma, including using the voice and vote of 
the United States at multilateral develop-
ment institutions, until all those detained in 
the February 1, 2021, coup are released and 
there has been a full restoration of civilian- 
controlled parliament respecting the Novem-

(D) utilize the United States Government’s 
position on the United Nations Security 
Council to bring about greater international 
cooperation in the pursuit of justice and ac-
countability in Burma; 
(E) legitimize and provide assistance to the 
National Unity Government of the Republic 
of the Union of Myanmar, the National 
Unity Consultative Council, the Civil Dis-
obedience Movement in Myanmar, and other 
entities promoting democracy in Burma, 
while simultaneously denying legitimacy 
and resources to the junta; 
(F) promote national reconciliation among 
the diverse ethnic and religious groups in 
Burma; 
(G) counter support to the junta by the 
People’s Republic of China and the Russian 
Federation; and 
(H) secure the restoration of democracy, 
the establishment of an inclusive and rep-
resentative civilian government and a re-
formed military reflecting the diversity of 
Burma and under civilian control, and the 
enactment of constitutional, political, and 
economic reform in Burma; and 
(9) urges the Secretary of State to swiftly 
conduct an Interagency Process and issue a 
determination as to whether the targeting 
and murder of innocent civilians by the 
Tatmadaw during and after the February 1, 
2021, coup d’etat, specifically those associ-
ated with ethnic and religious groups in 
Burma, 
and 
crimes 
committed 
by 
the 
Tatmadaw against such ethnic and religious 
groups prior to the coup constitute crimes 
against humanity or genocide. 
EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE 
SENATE ON THE POLITICAL SIT-
UATION IN BELARUS 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of Calendar No. 167, S. Res. 345. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the resolution by 
title. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 345) expressing the 
sense of the Senate on the political situation 
in Belarus. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolution 
which had been reported from the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations with an 
amendment to strike all after the re-
solving clause and insert the part 
printed in italic, and with an amend-
ment to strike the preamble and insert 
the part printed in italic, as follows: 
Whereas the United States Senate has long 
maintained strong bipartisan concern regarding 
the troubling lack of democracy in Belarus, 
highlighted by the passing of the Belarus De-
mocracy Act of 2004 (Public Law 108–347; 22 
U.S.C. 5811 note); 
Whereas the 116th Congress, as referenced in 
H.R. 8438, the Belarus Democracy, Human 
Rights, and Sovereignty Act of 2020, and Senate 
Resolution 658, which both passed with unani-
mous support, stated its deep concern regarding 
the fraudulent election in Belarus on August 9, 
2020; 
Whereas on September 17, 2020, the Moscow 
Mechanism of the human dimension of the Or-
ganization for Security and Cooperation in Eu-
rope (OSCE) was invoked by 17 participating 
states with regard to credible reports of human 
rights violations before, during, and after the 
presidential election of August 9, 2020, in 
Belarus; 
Whereas, following Alyaksandr Lukashenka’s 
inauguration on September 23, 2020, the United 
States, the European Union, numerous Euro-
pean Union member states, the United Kingdom, 
and Canada announced they did not recognize 
the legitimacy of the election results; 
Whereas after the August 9, 2020 presidential 
election, the Government of Belarus responded 
to the resulting peaceful protests, the largest in 
the country’s history, with a violent crackdown, 
including the detention of more than 10,000 
peaceful protestors, according to the United Na-
tions Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights in Belarus; 
Whereas the Government of Belarus, under 
the misrule of the Lukashenka regime, continues 
to engage in a pattern of clear and persistent 
violations of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms and disrespects the basic principles of 
democratic governance by subjecting tens of 
thousands of pro-democracy political activists, 
peaceful protesters, and ordinary citizens to 
harassment, beatings, abductions, forced depor-
tations, and imprisonment and by committing 
acts of transnational repression to punish any 
dissent expressed by Belarusian citizens; 
Whereas the Lukashenka regime continues to 
silence independent media, such as Nasha Niva, 
tut.by, and Belsat, and has unlawfully raided 
the offices of media outlets, including Radio 
Free Europe/Radio Liberty, and arrested jour-
nalists; 
Whereas on September 11, 2020, then-Deputy 
Secretary of State Stephen Biegun said that ‘‘we 
stand by our long-term commitment to support 
the sovereignty of Belarus as well as its terri-
torial integrity, as the aspirations of the 
Belarusian people to determine their own path 
remains in front of us’’; 
Whereas on May 23, 2021, the Lukashenka re-
gime forced a commercial airliner flying between

two European Union member states to land in 
Minsk in order for the regime to arrest jour-
nalist Raman Pratasevich and his partner Sofia 
Sapega, a violation of international law result-
ing in near universal condemnation from the 
international community and coordinated sanc-
tions by the United States, the United Kingdom, 
and the European Union; 
Whereas on May 28, 2021, the White House 
announced the re-imposition of full blocking 
sanctions against nine Belarusian state-owned 
enterprises and announced a new Executive 
order to increase sanctions on elements of the 
Lukashenka regime; 
Whereas the Lukashenka regime has actively 
encouraged or forced at gunpoint more than 
4,000 migrants from other countries to cross 
through Belarus into European Union member 
states Lithuania, Latvia, and Poland, amount-
ing to people smuggling and obliging these 
countries to declare a state of emergency; 
Whereas on June 9, 2021, the Committee on 
Foreign Relations of the Senate held a hearing 
regarding the political situation in Belarus, in 
which United States Ambassador to Belarus 
Julie Fisher testified that ‘‘Despite the oppres-
sion, the violence, and the turmoil that followed 
the events of the past year provide glimmers of 
hope. A new generation of brave Belarusians, 
with courageous women at the front, have 
emerged. They represent a Belarus determined 
to chart its own path. They represent a Belarus 
in which wearing a red and white dress, hang-
ing a flag, or playing a particular song will not 
result in torture, forced confessions, or even 
death.’’; 
Whereas on July 27, 2021, President Biden met 
Belarusian 
opposition 
leader 
Sviatlana 
Tsikhanouskaya at the White House and de-
clared that ‘‘The United States stands with the 
people of Belarus in their quest for democracy 
and universal human rights.’’; 
Whereas on August 9, 2021, President Biden— 
(1) announced an Executive order authorizing 
the imposition of blocking sanctions on certain 
sectors of the Belarus economy, including the 
potash, tobacco products, and construction sec-
tors; and 
(2) pursuant to such executive order and Ex-
ecutive Order 13405, issued additional sanctions 
on Belarusian individuals and entities, includ-
ing Belaruskali (a state-owned potash fertilizer 
company) and the Belarus National Olympic 
Committee; and 
Whereas 
Belarusian 
opposition 
leader 
Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya continues to rep-
resent 
the 
widely 
shared 
desire 
of 
the 
Belarusian people for free and fair elections and 
democracy: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, øThat the Senate— 
ø(1) continues, on the first anniversary of 
the illegitimate presidential election in

nize Alyaksandr Lukashenka as the legiti-
mately elected leader of Belarus;

ical professionals, professors, teachers, ath-
letes, and cultural leaders;

participate in the OSCE process;

ø(5) welcomes the United States Govern-
ment’s close coordination with the European 
Union, the United Kingdom, Canada, other

national organizations to promote the prin-
ciples of democracy, the rule of law, and 
human rights in Belarus and encourages con-
tinued coordination to apply maximal pres-
sure on the Lukashenka regime;

Aleh 
Hruzdzilovich

ø(8) condemns the forced diversion of 
Ryanair 
Flight

Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, 
today, the Senate will consider S. Res. 
345, legislation I authored with Senator 
ROGER WICKER to bring attention to 
the people of Belarus and their pursuit 
of 
democracy. 
Since 
Alyaksandr 
Lukashenka egregiously stole the Pres-
idential elections in 2020, we have wit-
nessed a continued crackdown on the 
people of Belarus, who are being denied 
their basic human rights. After un-
justly claiming victory, Lukashenka 
responded to peaceful, pro-democracy 
protests across Belarus with violence 
and oppression, throwing thousands of 
Belarusians in jail. 
In May last year, his regime forced a 
commercial airliner flying between two

February 1, 2022 
European states to land in Minsk so his 
security forces could arrest a jour-
nalist and his partner, an action for 
which 
the 
U.S. 
has 
charged 
four 
Belarusian officials with hijacking. 
Then last fall, his regime exploited vul-
nerable migrants by bringing them to 
Belarus and forcing them at gunpoint 
across the border into the European 
Union, leading several countries to de-
clare a state of emergency. 
These abuses are demoralizing to the 
Belarusian people, who keep up the 
fight to bring Lukashenka to account 
for his egregious behavior. But now, we 
are witnessing a new level of despera-
tion by Lukashenka, who is supporting 
Putin in his campaign of aggression 
against 
Ukraine. 
He 
has 
endorsed 
Putin’s agenda and invited Russian 
troops for major military exercises on 
Belarusian soil. Lukashenka has effec-
tively given Putin permission to use 
his own country for a training ground 
to undermine a sovereign nation. 
As Lukashenka supports Vladimir 
Putin’s efforts to destabilize the demo-
cratically elected government in Kyiv, 
at home he has proposed a constitu-
tional referendum that would allow 
him to stay in office indefinitely. 
Indeed, life under Lukashenka is per-
ilous. Today, there are more than 1000 
political prisoners in Belarus, 1000 peo-
ple imprisoned because of the insecu-
rities of one man. I welcome the recent 
statement from the Department of 
State bringing attention to the ill 
treatment of these prisoners. And I call 
on the Lukashenka regime to release 
these prisoners without conditions and 
abide by their commitments to human 
rights as a member of the Organization 
for Security and Cooperation in Eu-
rope. 
Lukashenka has ruthlessly attacked 
independent media in Belarus, includ-
ing Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, 
which he declared an extremist organi-
zation. Anyone who subscribes to RFE/ 
RL can be arrested and jailed. RFE/ 
RL’s journalists who reported on the 
2020 elections have been harassed, de-
tained, arrested, and stripped of their 
credentials. 
I want to highlight the stories behind 
the names of these journalists. They 
have been arrested and torn from fam-
ily and friends indefinitely, simply for 
doing their jobs to shed light on the 
truth. 
Ihor Losik was sentenced to 15 years 
in prison in December after a lengthy, 
closed door trial. Andrey Kuznechyk 
has been detained since November on 
unknown 
criminal 
charges. 
Aleh 
Hruzdzilovich has been detained since 
late December for his reporting activi-
ties, after previously serving two stints 
in jail following the election. 
The Lukashenka regime’s cowardly 
attacks on the free press do not project 
strength. They show that regime is, in 
fact, weak, desperate and afraid of the 
truth. And the truth is—the Belarusian 
people want to live in a free country 
and choose their own future. 
This is why I have been proud to lead 
efforts in the Senate to condemn the 
actions of the Lukashenka regime and 
support the brave people of Belarus 
who continue to stand up to an increas-
ingly 
autocratic 
government. 
Last 
year, Senator WICKER and I cofounded 
the Free Belarus Caucus to advocate 
for the pro-democracy movement and 
continue to push for free and fair elec-
tions in Belarus. 
I 
have 
met 
with 
Sviatlana 
Tsikhanouskaya numerous times and 
others from the Coordination Council 
who are leading the effort to bring a 
peaceful, 
democratic 
transition 
of 
power to Belarus. She is an admirable 
woman who did not seek the spotlight, 
but stepped up on behalf of her people 
when they needed her most. Her leader-
ship is critical for the future of democ-
racy in Belarus, and we must do every-
thing we can to assist her and the 
Belarusian people. 
And today, I am calling on my col-
leagues in the Senate to join me in sup-
porting 
this 
resolution, 
which 
ex-
presses solidarity for the Belarussians’ 
pursuit of freedom and a future of their 
own making. As we work together to 
respond to Russian threats against 
Ukraine, we must not forget the plight 
of Belarusians. We must be steadfast in 
our strong support to those suffering 
under the rule of authoritarians. So I 
urge my colleagues to join me at this 
critical moment and support this reso-
lution. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. I further ask that 
the Shaheen amendment at the desk to 
the committee-reported amendment to 
the resolution be agreed to, and that 
the committee-reported amendment, as 
amended, be agreed to. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The amendment (No. 4921) was agreed 
to, as follows: 
(Purpose: To make technical amendments) 
On page 13, strike lines 1 through 8, and in-
sert the following: 
(7) calls for the unconditional release of all 
political prisoners and journalists detained 
on dubious charges, including opposition

Babaryka, 
pro-democracy 
activist 
Maria 
Kalesnikava, and Radio Free Europe/Radio 
Liberty

On page 14, lines 8 and 9, strike ‘‘consider 
all 
economic, 
political, 
and 
diplomatic 
tools’’ and insert ‘‘consider further tools’’. 
The committee-reported amendment, 
in the nature of a substitute, as amend-
ed, was agreed to. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. I know of no fur-
ther debate on the resolution, as 
amended. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there 
is no further debate, the question is on 
the resolution, as amended. 
The resolution (S. Res. 345), in the 
nature of a substitute, as amended, was 
agreed to. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. I ask unanimous 
consent that the committee-reported 
amendment to the preamble be agreed 
to; that the preamble, as amended, be 
agreed to; and that the motions to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table with no intervening ac-
tion or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The committee-reported amendment 
to the preamble, in the nature of a sub-
stitute, was agreed to. 
The 
preamble, 
as

was 
agreed to. 
The resolution, as amended, with its 
preamble, as amended, reads as follows: 
S. RES. 345 
Whereas the United States Senate has long 
maintained strong bipartisan concern re-
garding the troubling lack of democracy in 
Belarus, highlighted by the passing of the 
Belarus Democracy Act of 2004 (Public Law 
108–347; 22 U.S.C. 5811 note); 
Whereas the 116th Congress, as referenced 
in H.R. 8438, the Belarus Democracy, Human 
Rights, and Sovereignty Act of 2020, and Sen-
ate Resolution 658, which both passed with 
unanimous support, stated its deep concern 
regarding the fraudulent election in Belarus 
on August 9, 2020; 
Whereas on September 17, 2020, the Moscow 
Mechanism of the human dimension of the 
Organization for Security and Cooperation in 
Europe (OSCE) was invoked by 17 partici-
pating states with regard to credible reports 
of human rights violations before, during, 
and after the presidential election of August 
9, 2020, in Belarus; 
Whereas, 
following 
Alyaksandr 
Lukashenka’s inauguration on September 23, 
2020, the United States, the European Union, 
numerous European Union member states, 
the United Kingdom, and Canada announced 
they did not recognize the legitimacy of the 
election results; 
Whereas after the August 9, 2020 presi-
dential election, the Government of Belarus 
responded to the resulting peaceful protests, 
the largest in the country’s history, with a 
violent crackdown, including the detention 
of more than 10,000 peaceful protestors, ac-
cording to the United Nations Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights 
in Belarus; 
Whereas the Government of Belarus, under 
the misrule of the Lukashenka regime, con-
tinues to engage in a pattern of clear and 
persistent violations of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms and disrespects the 
basic principles of democratic governance by 
subjecting tens of thousands of pro-democ-
racy political activists, peaceful protesters, 
and ordinary citizens to harassment, beat-
ings, abductions, forced deportations, and 
imprisonment and by committing acts of 
transnational repression to punish any dis-
sent expressed by Belarusian citizens; 
Whereas the Lukashenka regime continues 
to silence independent media, such as Nasha 
Niva, tut.by, and Belsat, and has unlawfully 
raided the offices of media outlets, including 
Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, and ar-
rested journalists; 
Whereas on September 11, 2020, then-Dep-
uty Secretary of State Stephen Biegun said 
that ‘‘we stand by our long-term commit-
ment to support the sovereignty of Belarus 
as well as its territorial integrity, as the as-
pirations of the Belarusian people to deter-
mine their own path remains in front of us’’; 
Whereas on May 23, 2021, the Lukashenka 
regime forced a commercial airliner flying 
between two European Union member states 
to land in Minsk in order for the regime to 
arrest journalist Raman Pratasevich and his 
partner Sofia Sapega, a violation of inter-
national law resulting in near universal con-
demnation from the international commu-
nity and coordinated sanctions by the United 
States, the United Kingdom, and the Euro-
pean Union; 
Whereas on May 28, 2021, the White House 
announced the re-imposition of full blocking

sanctions against nine Belarusian state- 
owned enterprises and announced a new Ex-
ecutive order to increase sanctions on ele-
ments of the Lukashenka regime; 
Whereas the Lukashenka regime has ac-
tively encouraged or forced at gunpoint more 
than 4,000 migrants from other countries to 
cross through Belarus into European Union 
member states Lithuania, Latvia, and Po-
land, amounting to people smuggling and 
obliging these countries to declare a state of 
emergency; 
Whereas on June 9, 2021, the Committee on 
Foreign Relations of the Senate held a hear-
ing regarding the political situation in 
Belarus, in which United States Ambassador 
to Belarus Julie Fisher testified that ‘‘De-
spite the oppression, the violence, and the 
turmoil that followed the events of the past 
year provide glimmers of hope. A new gen-
eration of brave Belarusians, with coura-
geous women at the front, have emerged. 
They represent a Belarus determined to 
chart its own path. They represent a Belarus 
in which wearing a red and white dress, 
hanging a flag, or playing a particular song 
will not result in torture, forced confessions, 
or even death.’’; 
Whereas on July 27, 2021, President Biden 
met Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana 
Tsikhanouskaya at the White House and de-
clared that ‘‘The United States stands with 
the people of Belarus in their quest for de-
mocracy and universal human rights.’’; 
Whereas on August 9, 2021, President 
Biden— 
(1) announced an Executive order author-
izing the imposition of blocking sanctions on 
certain sectors of the Belarus economy, in-
cluding the potash, tobacco products, and 
construction sectors; and 
(2) pursuant to such executive order and 
Executive Order 13405, issued additional 
sanctions on Belarusian individuals and enti-
ties, including Belaruskali (a state-owned 
potash fertilizer company) and the Belarus 
National Olympic Committee; and 
Whereas 
Belarusian 
opposition 
leader 
Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya continues to rep-
resent the widely shared desire of the 
Belarusian people for free and fair elections 
and democracy: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) continues, on the first anniversary of 
the illegitimate presidential election in 
Belarus on August 9, 2020, to refuse to recog-
nize Alyaksandr Lukashenka as the legiti-
mately elected leader of Belarus; 
(2) condemns Lukashenka’s ongoing crack-
down on members of the pro-democracy 
movement, senior members of the Coordina-
tion Council, peaceful protesters, employees 
from state-owned enterprises participating 
in strikes, independent election observers, 
independent journalists and bloggers, med-
ical professionals, professors, teachers, ath-
letes, and cultural leaders; 
(3) continues to call for the fulfillment by 
the Government of Belarus of Belarus’ freely 
undertaken obligations as an Organization 
for Security and Co-operation in Europe 
(OSCE) member and accept the OSCE’s offer 
to facilitate a national dialogue and fully 
participate in the OSCE process; 
(4) calls for new presidential and par-
liamentary elections to be held in Belarus, 
conducted in a manner that is free and fair 
according to OSCE standards and under the 
supervision of OSCE observers and inde-
pendent domestic observers; 
(5) welcomes the United States Govern-
ment’s close coordination with the European 
Union, the United Kingdom, Canada, other 
allied and partner countries, and inter-
national organizations to promote the prin-
ciples of democracy, the rule of law, and 
human rights in Belarus and encourages con-
tinued coordination to apply maximal pres-
sure on the Lukashenka regime; 
(6) continues to call for the immediate re-
lease, without preconditions, of all political 
prisoners in Belarus; 
(7) calls for the unconditional release of all 
political prisoners and journalists detained

(8) condemns the forced diversion of 
Ryanair 
Flight 
4978 
to 
arrest 
Raman 
Pratasevich and his partner Sofia Sapega, 
which violated international civil aviation 
law and risked the lives of innocent pas-
sengers and crew, and calls for their imme-
diate unconditional release; 
(9) commends the bravery of Belarusians 
who have created innovative ways to protest 
Lukashenka’s autocracy and applauds the 
Belarusian diaspora’s efforts to maintain 
international focus on the deteriorating po-
litical situation; 
(10) lauds the extraordinary support offered 
by the Governments of Lithuania, Ukraine, 
and Poland to support the people of Belarus, 
including support for the political opposi-
tion, accommodation of political refugees, 
and backing a free media; 
(11) calls on the Lukashenka regime to im-
mediately 
halt 
exploiting 
and 
instrumentalizing migrants and to stop di-
recting individuals to the borders of Lith-
uania, Latvia, and Poland; 
(12) welcomes the Executive order an-
nounced on August 9, 2021, that applies addi-
tional sanctions on the Lukashenka regime 
and urges the Biden Administration to con-
sider further tools at its disposal to support 
democracy in Belarus; 
(13) welcomes the European Union sanc-
tions imposed on the Lukashenka regime 
and urges the United States to continue to 
coordinate additional measures with the Eu-
ropean Union; and 
(14) emphasizes that the United States sup-
ports the people of Belarus in their quest to 
maintain their sovereignty, choose their own 
leadership, and live in freedom, and recog-
nizes the extensive efforts of the Belarusian 
opposition to coordinate efforts with the 
United States, the European Union, the 
OSCE, and the United Nations to bring free 
and fair elections to its people.

IRAN 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, 
for nearly 30 years, first as a member 
of the House Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee and, to this day, as chairman of 
the Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee, I have had the privilege of en-
gaging in the most pressing foreign 
policy and national security issues fac-
ing our Nation. 
While we are rightly focused on the 
crisis unfolding around Ukraine, we 
must not lose sight of how dangerously 
close Iran is to becoming a nuclear- 
armed state, for we know that a nu-
clear-armed Iran would pose an unac-
ceptable threat to U.S. national secu-
rity interests, to our allies in Europe, 
and to overall stability in the Middle 
East. 
As someone who has followed Iran’s 
nuclear ambition for the better part of 
three decades, I am here today to raise 
concerns about the current round of 
negotiations 
over 
the 
Joint 
Com-
prehensive Plan of Action and Iran’s 
dangerously and rapidly escalating nu-
clear program that has put it on the 
brink of having enough material for a 
nuclear weapon. Three to four weeks— 
a month or less—is how long most ana-
lysts have concluded it would take Iran 
to produce enough fissile material for a 
nuclear bomb if they chose to do so. 
That is not a timeline we can accept. 
That is why I am calling on the 
Biden administration and our inter-
national partners to exert more pres-
sure on Iran to counter its nuclear pro-
gram, its missile program, and its dan-
gerous behavior around the Middle 
East, including attacks on American 
personnel and assets. 
Now, before I continue, let me set the 
record straight. While some have tried 
to paint me as belligerent to diplomacy 
or worse, I have always believed that 
multilateral, diplomatic negotiations 
from a position of strength are the best 
ways to address Iran’s nuclear pro-
gram, and I have always advocated for 
a comprehensive diplomatic agreement 
that is long-lasting, fully verifiable, 
and with an enforceable snapback sys-
tem of sanctions should Iran breach 
any terms. 
It was for very specific reasons that I 
opposed the JCPOA back in 2015 as well 
as an underlying concern that I just 
could not shake, a sense that the deal 
itself at the time was the best case sce-
nario, hinging on good-faith actors and 
overly optimistic outcomes without 
enough consideration for the worst 
case scenarios that might arise from 
the behavior of bad actors. Today, 
many of the concerns I expressed about 
the JCPOA back in August of 2015 are 
coming back to haunt us in the year 
2022. 
First and foremost, my overarching 
concern with the JCPOA was that it 
did not require the complete dis-
mantlement of Iran’s nuclear infra-
structure. Instead, it mothballed that 
infrastructure for 10 years, making it 
all too easy for Iran to resume its il-
licit nuclear program at a moment of 
its choosing. 
The deal did not require Iran to de-
stroy or fully decommission a single 
uranium 
enrichment 
centrifuge. 
In 
fact, over half of Iran’s operating cen-
trifuges at the time were able to con-
tinue spinning at its Natanz facility. 
The remainder—more than 5,000 oper-
ational centrifuges and nearly 10,000 
not yet operational—were to be merely 
disconnected. Instead of being com-
pletely removed, they were transferred 
to another hall at Natanz, where they 
could be quickly reinstalled to enrich 
uranium, which is exactly what we 
have seen happen over the past year, 
nor did the deal shut down or destroy 
the Fordow nuclear facility, which Iran 
constructed underneath a mountain to 
house its covert uranium enrichment 
infrastructure. Under the JCPOA, it 
was merely refurbished. 
Now Iran is back in business at 
Fordow, spinning its most advanced 
centrifuges and enriching uranium to a 
higher level of purity than before it en-
tered into the JCPOA. 
In the 2 years since President Trump 
left the JCPOA, Iran has resumed its 
research and development into a range 
of centrifuges, making rapid improve-
ments 
to 
their 
effectiveness—huge 
strides that we will never be able to 
roll back. 
Today, Iran has more fissile mate-
rial—2,500 kilograms—more advanced 
centrifuges, and a shorter breakout 
time—3 to 4 weeks—than it had in 2015. 
This is exactly why I was so concerned

February 1, 2022 
over the JCPOA’s framework of leaving 
the vast majority of Iran’s nuclear pro-
gram intact. This is how Iran was able 
to rapidly rebuild and advance its en-
richment capabilities once the agree-
ment fell apart. That was a serious 
mistake. 
Back in 2015, I also expressed my 
grave concern that Iran only agreed to 
provisionally—provisionally—apply the 
Additional Protocol of the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty. The Addi-
tional Protocol is what allows the 
International Atomic Energy Agency 
to go beyond merely verifying that all 
declared nuclear material and facilities 
are being used for peaceful purposes 
and provides it with a verification 
mechanism to ensure states do not 
have undeclared nuclear materials and 
facilities. 
The Additional Protocol was particu-
larly important because Iran has never 
fully come clean about its previous 
clandestine nuclear activities. For well 
over two decades, mounting concerns 
over Iran’s secret weaponization efforts 
united the world. The goal that we 
have long sought, along with the inter-
national community, is to find out ex-
actly what Iran accomplished in its 
clandestine program, not necessarily to 
get Iran to declare culpability but to 
determine how far they advanced their 
weaponization program so that we 
would know what signatures to look 
for in the future.

Albright, 
a 
physicist 
and 
former nuclear weapons inspector and 
founder of the Institute for Science and 
International Security said:

the military dimensions of Iran’s nuclear 
program is fundamental to . . . [any] long- 
term agreement. [An agreement] that side-
steps the military . . . issues would risk 
being unverified. 
The reason that he said that an 
agreement that sidesteps the military 
issues would be unverifiable is that it 
makes a difference if you are 90 per-
cent, in terms of enriched material 
down the road in your weaponization 
efforts, or only 10 percent advanced; 90 
percent or 10 percent makes a big dif-
ference. 
The 
state 
of 
Iran’s 
weaponization efforts significantly im-
pacts the breakout time for the regime 
to 
complete 
an 
actual 
deliverable 
weapon so this verifiability is critical. 
In 2015, I explained that the JCPOA 
did not empower international weapons 
inspectors to conduct the kind of any-
time, anywhere inspections needed to 
get to the bottom of Iran’s previous 
weaponization program, and in Feb-
ruary of last year, 2021, we saw the con-
sequences of not insisting that Iran 
permanently ratify the Additional Pro-
tocol. Iran simply decided they were 
done with the Additional Protocol and 
refused to allow the International 
Atomic Energy Agency to fully inves-
tigate locations where it found traces 
of uranium enrichment. 
It is now obvious that the IAEA, or 
what we call the International Atomic 
Energy Agency, is significantly limited 
in its ability to determine the extent of 
Iran’s previous nuclear program and 
whether further militarization activi-
ties have continued all this time. With-
out the complete adoption of the Addi-
tional Protocol, the JCPOA did not em-
power the IAEA to achieve this task. 
So that was then and this is now, and 
though I had my concerns with the 
JCPOA, as I have expressed, I am also 
absolutely clear-eyed, as everyone else 
in this Chamber should be, that the 
way in which President Trump unilat-
erally withdrew from the deal—with no 
diplomatic plan for constraining Iran’s 
nuclear ambitions, without the support 
of any of our allies, without any kind 
of 
serious 
alternative—emboldened 
Iran to pursue its nuclear ambitions 
like never before. 
Now, we can’t live in a counterfac-
tual world where all parties remain in 
full compliance, but we do know that, 
even for the first couple of years of the 
JCPOA, Iran’s leaders gave absolutely 
no—no—indication that they were will-
ing to look beyond the scope of these 
limited terms and fought vigorously to 
keep their highly advanced nuclear in-
frastructure in place, and that was 
under a more ‘‘moderate’’ regime. They 
continued their destabilizing activities 
and support for terrorism in the great-
er Middle East with abandon. 
So today I ask: Why would we try to 
simply go back to the JCPOA—a deal 
that was not sufficient in the first 
place and still doesn’t address some of 
the most serious national security con-
cerns that we have? 
Let me lay out specific concerns 
about the parameters of the JCPOA, 
which, it appears, the Biden adminis-
tration is seeking to reestablish. 
For decades now, Iran has pursued all 
three elements necessary to create and 
to deliver a nuclear weapon: producing 
nuclear material for a weapon, the 
fissile material—that is basically what 
we just talked about being 3 to 4 weeks 
away; the scientific research and devel-
opment to build a nuclear warhead— 
that is why we don’t know the full di-
mensions of what they were doing in 
terms of how advanced they got to the 
weaponization, the ability to have the 
nuclear warhead that makes the bomb 
go boom; and then the ballistic missile 
to deliver them—that, they already 
have. 
So if you think about it, they have 
the missiles capable—I will talk about 
that a little bit more in a few min-
utes—they have the missiles capable of 
delivering. They have the fissile mate-
rial—are on the verge of having the 
fissile material necessary to create the 
ability for an explosion. These are 
checked off. The only question is the 
warhead. At what point are they there? 
And we don’t fully know. 
Since 
the 
Trump 
administration 
exited the deal, Iran has installed more 
than 1,000 advanced centrifuges, ena-
bling it to enrich uranium more quick-
ly. While the deal the United States 
and our partners are pursuing in Vi-
enna would ostensibly seek to reverse 
technological advancements, the acqui-
sition of knowledge—that is never re-
versible. 
As Kelsey Davenport of the Arms 
Control Association has said, ‘‘Iran’s 
nuclear program hit new milestones 
over the past years.’’ To quote it, it 
says: ‘‘As it masters the new capabili-
ties, it will change our understanding 
about how the country’’—in this case, 
Iran—‘‘may pursue nuclear weapons 
down the road.’’ That is exactly why 
the starting position of the United 
States and our partners during our 
original negotiations was the complete 
dismantlement of Iran’s enrichment fa-
cilities and capacity. 
According 
to 
the 
International 
Atomic Energy Agency, Iran has pro-
duced uranium enriched to more than 
60 percent purity—more than 60 per-
cent purity—at the Natanz facility. 
Why is 60 percent purity so alarming? 
Well, as the Director General of the 
International Atomic Energy Associa-
tion—the U.N. international watchdog 
on these issues—Rafael Grossi has stat-
ed, Iran’s decision to enrich uranium to 
60 percent to produce uranium metal 
has no—no—justification for civilian 
purposes—no justification for civilian 
purposes. 
Iran says: Well, we only want nuclear 
energy for domestic energy consump-
tion. But, as the IAEA’s head says, it 
has no justification to enrich uranium 
to 60 percent for civilian purposes. In 
other words, Iran has already done 
most of the heavy lifting. 
Furthermore, the IAEA reports that 
Iran’s nuclear stockpile has grown to 
nearly 2,500 kilograms. That is nearly 
21⁄2 tons of enriched uranium and eight 
times—eight times—the cap that was 
agreed to in the JCPOA. More and 
more advanced centrifuges, a much 
larger nuclear stockpile, and vastly 
higher levels of enrichment are a dan-
gerous combination. 
As I noted before, Iran’s breakout 
time is now a mere 3 to 4 weeks, but 
according to a report from David 
Albright and others at the Institute for 
Science and International Security, 
Iran could enrich uranium for a second 
weapon in less than 4 months. Once 
they hit this breakout period, which is 
4 weeks away, then to get their second 
bomb, we are talking about 4 months. 
So while the United States has recog-
nized Iran’s right to civilian nuclear 
power, Iran’s behavior continues to in-
dicate that it is actively moving to-
ward developing nuclear weapons capa-
bilities. Adding to the alarm is the fact 
that we don’t even have the full picture 
of exactly how far it has gone. Again, 
that is why full access was and is such 
a critical component of any deal. 
As the original deal was being nego-
tiated, we started from a place of any-
where, anytime inspections that we 
wanted—anywhere, anytime—but that 
is not where the deal landed. 
While I recognize that other factors 
have contributed to Iran’s efforts to 
block inspectors, simply put, I was not 
satisfied in 2015 with the level of visi-
bility the agreement afforded.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S458 
February 1, 2022 
Today, indeed, the IAEA readily 
states it does not have the necessary 
level of access. In fact, in September of 
2021, the IAEA Director, Rafael Grossi, 
warned that ‘‘Iran’s failure to fully co-
operate and communicate with the 
IAEA ‘is seriously compromising’ the 
IAEA’s ability to have full insight into 
Iran’s program.’’ IAEA inspectors were 
denied access three times to the Karaj 
centrifuge component production facil-
ity in their efforts to install new sur-
veillance cameras to monitor Iranian 
activities. 
In addition, Iran is not cooperating 
with the IAEA’s ongoing 2-year-old in-
vestigation into the presence of nu-
clear materials found at four locations 
outside of Iran’s declared nuclear pro-
gram sites. Iran has a lot of access to 
two of those locations but has denied 
and delayed access to the other two. 
The IAEA has further warned Iran 
multiple times that their ‘‘lack of sub-
stantive 
engagement’’ 
in 
resolving 
these issues ‘‘seriously affects the 
agency’s 
ability 
to 
provide 
assur-
ance’’—assurance—‘‘of the exclusively 
peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear pro-
gram.’’ 
But Iran’s obstruction has gone far 
beyond reneging on the inspection pro-
tocols agreed to in the JCPOA. As I 
mentioned previously, in February of 
last year, Iran suspended implementa-
tion of the Additional Protocol. Fol-
lowing that suspension, the IAEA man-
aged an arrangement where Tehran 
agreed to certain surveillance activi-
ties. But even though there was an 
agreement, it refused to transmit any 
data from that surveillance until it got 
all the sanctions relief the regime felt 
entitled to under the JCPOA—never 
mind their own repeated failures to 
meet 
their 
obligations 
under 
the 
JCPOA. 
We are not dealing with a good-faith 
actor here. Iran’s consistent obfusca-
tion, 
continued 
stalling, 
and 
out-
landish demands have left us flying 
blind, especially when it comes to 
verifying that Iran is not engaged in 
activities related to the weaponization 
process, activities related to the design 
and development of a nuclear explosive 
device, activities which were explicitly 
banned in section T of the JCPOA. I am 
talking about utilizing computer mod-
els to simulate nuclear explosions, de-
veloping the diagnostic equipment for 
nuclear testing, and researching con-
ventional explosives for triggering a 
nuclear explosion. 
The JCPOA banned these activities 
because substantial evidence indicated 
that Iran had, in fact, pursued them in 
the past. Yet we cannot verify whether 
Iran is pursuing them again. We cannot 
know for sure because the Iranian Gov-
ernment has repeatedly stated the 
IAEA lacks the authority to inspect 
the very military sites where these ac-
tivities 
took 
place—the 
activities 
where the IAEA has wanted to go to 
but has been denied. 
With Iran’s breakout time now less 
than a month, we must be able to 
verify 
the 
scope 
of 
Iran’s 
weaponization research, and this must 
include Iran’s ballistic missile pro-
gram. We already know that Iran has 
ballistic missiles that could carry a 
warhead to the Middle East and parts 
of Europe. Indeed, given how far Iran’s 
enrichment capabilities and research 
and development have advanced, the 
only element left is preventing Iran 
from weaponizing its stockpile. 
All of this contributes to why we 
have a well-founded, deep mistrust of 
Iran’s willingness to seriously curtail 
its nuclear program. And, of course, 
Iran keeps reminding the United States 
and our Arab Gulf partners that its 
missile 
program 
presents 
its 
own 
unique threats outside of the nuclear 
file. 
I remain highly skeptical it will sus-
pend any of its other threatening and 
destabilizing activities, from ballistic 
missile development to support for ter-
rorist proxies. Even as the United 
States, our P5+1 partners, and Iran 
convened in Vienna for indirect nego-
tiations about returning to the JCPOA, 
Iran’s leaders took it upon themselves 
to antagonize all parties and show, my 
view, their true intentions. 
In December, they launched a rocket 
with a satellite carrier into space to re-
mind us all that even as they dragged 
out diplomatic negotiations, their am-
bitions remain acquiring the ability to 
eventually deliver a nuclear warhead. 
This launch was yet another provo-
cation like those we have seen over the 
past several years, some of which di-
rectly—directly—violate the terms of 
U.N. Security Council resolution 2231. 
That resolution codified the JCPOA, 
our agreement with Iran, and plenty of 
others that are far outside of the lim-
ited scope of the deal. 
Beyond this failed launch into space, 
Iran’s dangerous behavior has hit clos-
er to home. In recent years, Iran has 
increased direct threats to U.S. per-
sonnel and assets and continued pro-
viding weapons to terrorist proxies 
throughout the Middle East. 
The U.S. intelligence community last 
year assessed that ‘‘Iran and its mili-
tant allies continue to plot terrorist 
attacks against U.S. persons and inter-
ests. . . . Iran has the largest ballistic 
missile force in the region . . . [and] is 
increasingly active in using cyberspace 
to enable influence operations.’’ 
The Center for Strategic and Inter-
national Studies reports that Iran not 
only has the largest and most diverse 
ballistic missile program in the region, 
but it has also used those ballistic mis-
siles to attack U.S. personnel stationed 
in Iraq—personnel who, let’s be clear, 
have been there at the invitation of the 
Iraqi 
Government. 
While 
our 
last 
President made light of what he called 
headaches, the fact is, nearly a dozen 
servicemembers suffered from trau-
matic brain injuries during the attack 
on Al Asad Air Base in 2020. 
Already this year, there have been 3 
rocket and drone attacks, with public 
reports of 14 rockets hitting an Iraqi 
air base hosting U.S. forces and wound-
ing 2 American servicemembers. 
Allow me to share an article in the 
New Yorker by Robin Wright entitled 
‘‘The Looming Threat of a Nuclear Cri-
sis with Iran.’’ She writes of a con-
versation with CENTCOM commander 
Gen. Kenneth McKenzie in which he 
said the following: 
The lesson of Al Asad . . . is that Iran’s 
missiles have become a more immediate 
threat than its nuclear program. For dec-
ades, Iran’s rockets and missiles were wildly 
inaccurate. At Al Asad, ‘‘they hit pretty 
much where they wanted to hit’’. . . . Now 
they ‘‘can strike effectively across the 
breadth and depth of the Middle East. They 
could strike with accuracy, and they could 
strike with volume. 
The article continues: 
The regime has concentrated on developing 
missiles with longer reach, precision accu-
racy, and greater destructive power. Iran is 
. . . one of the world’s top missile producers. 
Its arsenal is the largest and most diverse in 
the Middle East, the Defense Intelligence 
Agency [has] reported. 
Now, as President Biden’s Special 
Envoy on the question of negotiations 
on a potential return to the JCPOA, 
Robert Malley, has said, ‘‘Iran has 
proven that using its ballistic-missile 
program as a means to coerce or in-
timidate its neighbors’’ is a real chal-
lenge. 
Now, Iran can fire more missiles than 
its adversaries—more missiles than its 
adversaries, 
including 
the 
United 
States and Israel—can shoot down or 
destroy. 
Tehran has achieved what General 
McKenzie calls overmatch, a level of 
capability in which a country has 
weaponry that makes it extremely dif-
ficult to check or defeat. 
‘‘Iran’s strategic capacity is now 
enormous,’’ McKenzie said. ‘‘They’ve 
got overmatch in the theatre—the abil-
ity to overwhelm.’’ 
Iran now has the largest known un-
derground complexes in the Middle 
East housing nuclear and missile pro-
grams. Most of the tunnels are in the 
west, facing Israel, or on the southern 
coast, across from Saudi Arabia and 
other Gulf sheikhdoms. 
This fall, satellite imagery tracked 
new underground construction near 
Bakhtaran, the most extensive com-
plex. The tunnels, carved out of rock, 
descend more than 1,600 feet under-
ground. Some complexes reportedly 
stretch for miles. Iran calls them ‘‘mis-
sile cities.’’ 
A recording of deceased General 
Suleimani echoes in the background: 
‘‘You start this war, but we create the 
end of it.’’ 
An 
underground 
railroad 
ferries 
Emad missiles for rapid successive 
launches. Emads have a range of a 
thousand miles and can carry a conven-
tional or a nuclear warhead. 
The Islamic Republic has thousands 
of ballistic missiles, according to U.S. 
intelligence 
assessments. 
They 
can 
reach—we see on this map that there 
are different missiles. But how far they 
can reach? Its farthest: 2,000 kilo-
meters. They can reach as far as 1,300

miles in any direction—deep into India 
and China to the east; high into Russia 
in the north; to Greece and other parts 
of Europe to the west; and as far south 
as Ethiopia, in the Horn of Africa, and 
dozens of countries in between. About a 
hundred missiles could reach Israel. 
The Biden administration has hoped 
to use progress on the nuclear deal to 
eventually broaden diplomacy and in-
clude Iran’s neighbors in talks on re-
ducing regional tensions. 
Ms. Wright then again quotes Special 
Envoy on Iran Rob Malley as saying: 
Even if we can revive the JCPOA, those 
problems are going to continue to poison the 
region and risk destabilizing it. If they con-
tinue, the response will be robust. 
Well, it may be too late. Tehran has 
shown no willingness to barter over its 
missiles as it has with its nuclear pro-
gram. 
She also quotes Jeffrey Lewis, an ex-
pert on missile proliferation at the 
Middlebury Institute of International 
Studies at Monterey, who said: 
Once you have spent the money to build 
the facilities and train people and deliver 
missiles to the military units that were built 
around these missiles, you have an enormous 
constituency that wants to keep them. I 
don’t think there’s any hope of limiting 
Iran’s missile program. 
And President Raisi, of Iran, told re-
porters after his election: ‘‘Regional 
issues or the missile issue are non-ne-
gotiable.’’ 
Nonnegotiable. Now, the U.S. mili-
tary is still vastly more powerful than 
anything built or imagined in Iran. Yet 
Iran has proven to be an increasingly 
shrewd rival. It has trained a genera-
tion of foreign engineers and scientists 
to assemble weaponry. It has dis-
patched stateless dhows loaded with 
missile parts for Houthi rebels, who 
have fired missiles at military and ci-
vilian targets in Saudi Arabia. It has 
provided the older ‘‘dumb’’ rocket tech-
nology to Hamas and Islamic Jihad. 
The 
majority 
of 
the 
‘‘precision 
project’’ kits crossing at Abu Kamal go 
to Lebanon, where Hezbollah upgrades 
its short-range rockets and missiles to 
hit more accurately and to penetrate 
more deeply inside Israel. Hezbollah is 
now estimated to have at least 14,000 
missiles and more than 100,000 rockets, 
mostly courtesy of Iran. 
As McKenzie says, ‘‘they have the 
ability to strike very precisely into 
Israel in a way they’ve not enjoyed in 
the past.’’ 
I shared this article on the floor 
today because I believe it captures the 
gravity of our present reality, and I en-
courage all of our colleagues to read it. 
Beyond what Ms. Wright has laid out 
above with excellent sources and de-
tails, let’s also not forget that Iran 
continues to be a steady fighting part-
ner for the murderous Bashar al-Assad 
regime in Syria, all the while expand-
ing its military footprint along our 
ally Israel’s northern border. 
And, let’s not forget, all of this bel-
ligerent behavior has escalated despite 
the ballistic restrictions under U.N. Se-
curity Council resolution 2231. 
Madam President, resolution 2231 of 
the United Nations was the framework 
that endorsed the JCPOA and imposed 
other restrictions. So just think of 
where Iran will go when these restric-
tions expire next year. They expire, 
under existing law, next year. 
Beyond 
this 
alarming 
aggression 
throughout the region, within its bor-
ders Iran continues to remind the 
world it has no respect for human 
rights. It is a country where dissidents 
and activists who want a better future 
are persecuted and killed. Indeed, just 
last January, Baktash Abtin, a promi-
nent Iranian poet and human rights ac-
tivist who was jailed for ‘‘propaganda 
against the state,’’ died in the noto-
rious Evin prison from COVID–19. 
Iran’s judicial system is a sham that 
denies basic human rights like freedom 
of expression and condones torture and 
extrajudicial killings. Last year—get 
this—the U.S. Justice Department in-
dicted four Iranians for conspiring to 
kidnap and kill an Iranian-American 
journalist, Masih Alinejad, surveilling 
her daily activities in Brooklyn, NY, 
here on American soil. 
And we cannot forget the four Amer-
ican citizens who Iran continues to 
wrongfully detain—Babak and Siamak 
Namazi, 
Emad 
Shargi, 
and 
Morad 
Tabhaz—who are suffering in prison 
and whose family members are des-
perately seeking their return. 
It is against this backdrop of bad be-
havior that Iran is ostensibly negoti-
ating a return to the JCPOA—or 
maybe just dragging out the time. It 
took years of crushing U.S. and inter-
national sanctions to bring Iran to the 
negotiating table in the first place. I 
know because I was the author of many 
of them. And we had to remain united 
in order to bring them to the table, and 
now we have to remain united as well. 
Now, I have been cautiously opti-
mistic about the Biden administra-
tion’s initial efforts. I waited for the 
last year to see results. 
Before the Foreign Relations Com-
mittee, the Secretary of State and oth-
ers—senior members of the administra-
tion—insisted that they would look for 
a ‘‘longer and stronger’’ agreement. I 
have a pretty good sense of what I 
think ‘‘longer and stronger’’ means. 
Longer is obvious: more time. Strong-
er: dealing with elements that had not 
been previously dealt with. 
However, a year later, I have yet to 
hear any parameters of longer or 
stronger terms or whether that is even 
a feasible prospect. And even when it 
seemed that a constructive agreement 
might be possible last summer, upon 
taking office, the Raisi government 
abandoned all previous understandings 
and, as I mentioned, made absolutely 
clear that Iran’s ballistic missiles and 
regional proxy networks are ‘‘not nego-
tiable’’—his words: ‘‘not negotiable.’’ 
Moreover, at this point, we seriously 
have to ask: What exactly are we try-
ing to salvage? What are we trying to 
salvage? 
Iran has moved so far out of compli-
ance with so many of the terms of the 
JCPOA and of the terms of the U.N. Se-
curity Council resolution 2231. Mean-
while, the arms embargo that we had 
has already expired, and restrictions on 
Iran’s missile program are about to ex-
pire next year. 
To quote again Rob Malley, the 
President’s Iran negotiator, trying to 
revive the deal at this point would be 
‘‘tantamount to trying to revive a dead 
corpse.’’ 
I think he is right. It is time to start 
thinking out of the box and consider 
new strategies for rolling back Iran’s 
nuclear program and addressing its 
dangerous 
and 
nefarious 
activities. 
These new efforts should include cre-
ative diplomatic initiatives, stricter 
sanctions enforcement, and a steely de-
termination from Congress to back up 
President Biden’s declaration that Iran 
will ‘‘never get a nuclear weapon on 
my watch’’—his words. 
One critical first step is vigorously 
enforcing the sanctions we have in 
place. 
A few weeks ago, the Washington 
Post reported on the Iranian Revolu-
tionary Guard Corps’ extensive oil 
smuggling operations throughout the 
Persian Gulf: ‘‘Smuggled Iranian fuel 
and secret nighttime transfers: Sea-
farers recount how it’s done.’’ 
Now, I was pleased to see the Depart-
ment of the Treasury dispatch a senior 
official to the United Arab Emirates, 
which has been part of this, to help 
stop it. More significantly and despite 
what it says publicly, numerous re-
ports also suggest that China continues 
to buy Iranian crude oil at a discount— 
a lucrative lifeline for the Iranian re-
gime that both subverts international 
oil markets and gives China yet an-
other inroad into the Middle East. 
Using a sophisticated web of ship-
ping, delivery, and tanker flagging 
techniques, private energy analysts— 
here is where we see their abilities, in 
this space right in here, to make these 
transfers that ultimately go to China, 
through tanker flagging techniques— 
private energy analysts estimate that 
China bought an average of 350,000 to 
650,000 barrels per day—per day—last 
year. 
And according to United Against Nu-
clear Iran, this amounted—that reality 
of how many barrels they are buying 
per day amounted—to about $10 billion 
going to the Iranian regime, in viola-
tion of existing sanctions. 
We can’t turn a blind eye to these 
violations. The Biden administration 
must rigorously enforce our sanctions, 
including targeting Chinese entities in 
a way that will impose a serious cost. 
We must use our sanctions to crush the 
illicit, underground economy of Ira-
nian oil shipments throughout the 
world. 
The international community must 
also leverage a full range of tools. We 
have to urge our P5+1 partners to call 
for snapback sanctions on Iran under 
the parameters of the JCPOA, and we 
should be urging the EU to reimpose 
its pre-JCPOA sanctions on Iran.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S460 
February 1, 2022 
Now, of course, we have to be real-
istic here. Former President Trump’s 
disastrous withdrawal from the JCPOA 
hampered our ability on the sanctions 
front. Indeed, when former Secretary of 
State Mike Pompeo went to the U.N. in 
the summer of 2020 and attempted to 
invoke the snapback mechanism, our 
European partners and the rest of the 
P5+1 roundly rejected him and pointed 
out that the United States, from their 
view, did not even have the standing to 
do so having exited the deal. 
That was then. That said, I believe 
the Biden administration has dili-
gently worked to build back trust and 
cooperation with our partners, and I 
believe the remaining partners must 
look at the facts and officially invoke 
the snapback mechanism to send a 
strong signal to the Iranians. 
We must also be thinking beyond the 
JCPOA. It is worth noting that even 
though President Trump’s withdrawal, 
from my view, was a strategic, serious 
error, nothing technically constrained 
his ability to do so. Iran’s leaders in-
sist they want a guarantee that the 
United States will not withdraw from 
any future agreement. 
As these negotiations continue, the 
best guarantee of a sustainable diplo-
matic agreement with Iran and the 
international community is to build 
one that garners bipartisan political 
support. One such idea that I have been 
working on with Senator GRAHAM is a 
regional nuclear fuel bank that would 
provide Iran with access to fuel on the 
condition that it forgoes all domestic 
uranium enrichment and reprocessing. 
Now, that idea may sound lofty, but 
it is worth noting that the IAEA al-
ready runs a nuclear fuel bank that 
provides access to members in the case 
of a disruption to their existing fuel ar-
rangements. 
Iranian leaders have long maintained 
their nuclear program is for domestic 
energy development, and yet it belies 
logic that Iran would need to highly 
enrich uranium or undertake any num-
ber of the steps they had been taking 
over the past few years for a purely 
peaceful nuclear energy program, to 
say nothing of the fact that Iran was 
the fifth largest crude oil producer in 
OPEC in 2020 and the third largest nat-
ural gas producer in the world in 2019. 
So it has an abundance of natural re-
sources for energy purposes within its 
own country. 
It doesn’t need nuclear fuel for do-
mestic energy consumption. But if you 
accept that—well, we want to keep our 
oil and gas to sell, and we want nuclear 
power for the purposes of domestic en-
ergy consumption, fine, then why do 
you bury your program thousands of 
feet under a mountain? Why do you 
hide what you are doing? Why are you 
enriching to a grade that even the 
IAEA says has no civilian purpose 
whatsoever? Why won’t you show us 
that, in fact, your previous actions 
that 
we 
believe 
may 
lead 
to 
weaponization exist? Why won’t you 
show us, dispel it? 
The kind of arrangement we are talk-
ing about would truly satisfy the need 
for a peaceful nuclear program. Now, 
while we understand that there are 
both political and logistical challenges 
regarding this proposal in the past, we 
don’t believe we should close any po-
tential doors. We believe, actually, 
that our proposal opens new doors be-
cause while we are just now talking 
about Iran—and we have been having 
this conversation with our P5+1 allies 
and Iran in a bilateral arrangement be-
cause of our concerns about Iran’s nu-
clear program—we could be talking 
about the entire region. 
We have successfully negotiated nu-
clear cooperation agreements with a 
number of countries in the region on a 
bilateral basis, including Jordan and 
the United Arab Emirates. In the fu-
ture, such a fuel bank—a regional fuel 
bank—could even be expanded to guar-
antee that any Iranian Gulf state—or 
further beyond in the Middle East for 
that matter—can peacefully fuel its 
commercial nuclear reactors through 
the IAEA fuel bank. That means you 
don’t enrich, but you get the fuel nec-
essary if you want domestic energy 
consumption. 
Of course, regional investment into 
any diplomatic solution—from Gulf 
countries 
and 
Arab 
neighbors 
and 
Israel—is absolutely critical for suc-
cess. Just as we know our sanctions are 
most effective when we work with our 
international 
partners, 
multilateral 
cooperation is critical to finding a suc-
cessful outcome. 
But, particularly, what would be at-
tractive to the Iranian regime? Well, 
what is attractive—or should be attrac-
tive—to the Iranian regime is this ar-
rangement would decouple the view 
that the West is only seeking this ar-
rangement from Iran. 
Iran would not have to give up its 
right to enrich, but would, without a 
loss of national pride, delegate that 
right to a multilateral nuclear fuel 
bank. And by including other Gulf 
countries in such a reasonable natural 
fuel bank with the same terms and con-
ditions, Iran would not have to worry 
about other Gulf countries attaining 
nuclear weapons and posing a security 
threat to them. 
And finally, if we can succeed at a re-
gional nuclear fuel bank, would we stop 
a nuclear arms race in what is already 
a tinderbox of the world? Because if 
Iran can acquire a nuclear weapon, you 
can be sure that the countries in the 
Gulf—Saudi Arabia, Emirates, and oth-
ers—they are going to say, under the 
theory of mutual self-destruction, We 
have to have nuclear weapons too. And 
now, we begin an arms race in a part of 
the world that can ill-afford it. 
As we look to a new approach, I also 
believe that we should revisit a number 
of proposals I laid out in 2015. First, we 
should seek the immediate ratification 
by Iran of the Additional Protocol to 
ensure that we have a permanent inter-
national agreement with Iran for ac-
cess to suspect sites. 
Second, we need a ban on centrifuge 
R&D—research and development—for 
the duration of such an agreement be-
cause it is that advanced R&D that al-
lowed Iran to be 4 weeks away from 
crossing the nuclear threshold so that 
Iran could not have the capacity to 
quickly break out, just as the U.N. Se-
curity Council Resolution and sanc-
tions and snapback is off the table. 
Third, Iran should close the Fordow 
enrichment facility. After all, the sole 
purpose of Fordow was to harden Iran’s 
nuclear program to a military attack. 
But if Iran has nothing to hide and it is 
all for peaceful purposes, why do you 
put it deep underneath a mountain? 
Fourth, the world needs full resolu-
tion of the possible military dimen-
sions of Iran’s program. We need an ar-
rangement that isn’t set up to white-
wash this issue. The world needs to be 
able to go to sleep at night saying Iran 
has 
not 
achieved 
the 
ability 
to 
weaponize its desires. Iran and the 
IAEA must resolve the issue before per-
manent sanctions relief takes place. 
Should Iran fail to cooperate with a 
comprehensive review into the mili-
tary dimensions of their program, then 
automatic sanctions must snap back. 
Fifth, rather than extend the dura-
tion of the agreement, we need a per-
manent agreement. One of the single 
most concerning elements of the origi-
nal deal is its 10- to 15-year sunset of 
restrictions on Iran’s programs, with 
off-ramps starting after year 8. 
Well, think about it: 2015–2022—7 
years—this shows you how quickly 
that, in fact, Iran can be proceeding in 
a way that we would not want it to be 
able to proceed. 
And sixth, we need an agreement 
about what penalties will be collec-
tively imposed by the P5+1 for Iranian 
violations, both small and midsized, as 
well as a clear statement as to the so- 
called grandfather clause which exists 
in paragraph 37 of the JCPOA, to en-
sure that the U.S. position about not 
shielding contracts entered into legally 
upon 
reimposition 
of 
sanctions 
is 
shared by our allies. Everybody should 
be in the same boat. We are seeing 
that. 
And 
without 
these 
elements 
clearly delineated, there is room for in-
terpretation admission. 
I believe there is space for a deal 
with Iran. And I believe that one that 
garners bipartisan support would be 
the best guarantor of the political lon-
gevity the Iranians insist they want. 
Our goal must be the right deal, not 
just any deal. We must not agree to an 
arrangement that merely delays the in-
evitable. 
As we think about broader diplo-
matic options, we must be clear about 
what a good negotiation entails: Get-
ting more, obviously, requires giving 
more. If Iran were willing to make 
greater concessions on halting uranium 
enrichment, destroying nuclear infra-
structure, and seriously constraining 
its 
ballistic 
missile 
program, 
the 
United States and the international 
community should consider lifting a

broader scope of sanctions, potentially 
including some primary sanctions. 
While Iran’s leaders are scraping by 
in the resistance economy, the truth is 
that the whole country would be better 
off if the regime abandoned their en-
richment and weaponization efforts 
and focused on providing everyday Ira-
nians with real economic opportunity. 
At the same time, Iran must also 
fully 
understand 
that 
the 
United 
States will not hesitate to take any ac-
tion necessary to protect our interests 
and those of our allies, and that in-
cludes the use of military force where 
appropriate and necessary. One of our 
greatest strengths is our enduring se-
curity partnerships with nearly every 
country in the Middle East region. 
Last month, a group of senior bipar-
tisan diplomats, military officers, and 
former Members of Congress on both 
sides of the aisle issued a statement to 
the Washington Institute for Near East 
Policy about the importance of a cred-
ible military threat should Iran breach 
certain red lines. Let me quote from 
their statement. They said: 
Indeed, the Vienna negotiations are in dan-
ger of becoming a cover for Iran to move to-
ward achieving a threshold nuclear weapons 
capability. . . . While the United States has 
recognized Iran’s right to civilian nuclear 
power, Iran’s behavior continues to indicate 
that it not only wants to preserve a nuclear 
weapons option but is actively moving to-
ward developing that capability. Indeed, as 
the director-general of the International 
Atomic Energy Association, Rafael Grossi, 
has stated, Iran’s decision to enrich uranium 
to 60 percent and to produce uranium metal 
has no justifiable civilian purpose. . . . With-
out convincing Iran it will suffer severe con-
sequences if it stays on its current path, 
there is little reason to hope for the success 
of diplomacy. 
This is all from their statement. 
Therefore, for the sake of our diplomatic 
effort to resolve this crisis, we believe it is 
vital to restore Iran’s fear that its current 
nuclear path will trigger the use of force 
against it by the United States. The chal-
lenge is how to restore U.S. credibility in the 
eyes of Iran’s leaders. Words—including for-
mulations that are more pointed and direct 
than ‘‘all options are on the table’’—are also 
necessary but not sufficient. 
In that context, we believe it is important 
for the Biden administration to take steps 
that lead Iran to believe that persisting in 
its current behavior and rejecting a reason-
able diplomatic resolution will put to risk 
its entire nuclear infrastructure, one built 
painstakingly over the last three decades. 
Such steps may include orchestrating 
high-profile military exercises by the U.S. 
Central Command, potentially in concert 
with allies and partners, that simulate what 
would be involved in such a significant oper-
ation, including rehearsing air-to-ground at-
tacks on hardened targets and the suppres-
sion of Iranian missile batteries. 
Also important would be to provide both 
local allies and partners as well as U.S. in-
stallations and assets in the region with en-
hanced defensive capabilities to counter 
whatever retaliatory actions Iran might 
choose to make, thereby signaling our readi-
ness to act, if necessary. 
Perhaps most significantly, fulfilling past 
U.S. promises to act forcefully against other 
Iranian outrages, such as the drone attack 
by Iran-backed militias against the U.S. base 
at al-Tanf in Syria and Iran’s illegal capture 
of merchant ships and killing unarmed sea-
men, might have the salutary impact of un-
derscoring the seriousness of U.S. commit-
ments to act on the nuclear issue. 
Again, I encourage everyone to read 
this statement from colleagues, con-
gressional colleagues, military leaders, 
and diplomats on both sides of the 
aisle. 
Last year, following years of quiet 
cooperation 
and 
the 
narrowing 
of 
shared security concerns, the United 
States and our partners and allies wel-
comed Israel into the U.S. Central 
Command area of responsibility. We 
have a number of shared interests— 
from maritime security to confronting 
a growing threat of ballistic missiles 
and UAVs—and we must continue to 
strengthen our bilateral and regional 
partnerships to ensure that we have all 
the means necessary to protect our in-
terests. 
Moreover, we must forcefully and 
proportionately respond to Iran’s ongo-
ing attacks on our diplomatic and mili-
tary facilities in Iraq and Syria. We 
will not fail to respond against direct 
attacks on the United States that 
threaten our diplomat and service-
members. Full stop. 
Let me close by saying that the Ira-
nian nuclear threat is real, and it has 
grown disproportionately worse by day. 
It is becoming a clear and present dan-
ger. The time is now to reinvigorate 
our multilateral sanctions efforts and 
pursue new avenues, new ideas, new so-
lutions for a diplomatic resolution. 
But today, I call on the Biden admin-
istration and international community 
to vigorously and rigorously enforce 
sanctions, which have proven to be 
among the most potent tools for im-
pacting Iran’s leaders and the IRGC. 
We cannot allow Iran to threaten us 
into a bad deal or an interim agree-
ment that allows it to continue to 
build its nuclear capacity, nor should 
we cling to the scope of an agreement 
that it seems some are holding on for 
nostalgia’s sake. 
As I said 7 years ago, hope is not a 
national security strategy. In the 
words that I spoke in 2015, I said: 
Whether or not the supporters of the agree-
ment admit it, this deal is based on ‘‘hope’’; 
hope that—when the nuclear sunset clause 
expires—Iran will have succumbed to the 
benefits of commerce and global integration 
. . . 
Well, I hate to say, they have not. 
. . . hope that the hardliners will have lost 
their power and the revolution will end its 
hegemonic goals . . . 
They have not. 
. . . and hope that the regime will allow 
the Iranian people to decide their own fate. 
The hardliners are more entrenched, 
and they have not allowed the Iranian 
people to decide that future. 
Hope is part of human nature, but unfortu-
nately it is not a national security strategy. 
The Iranian regime, led by the Ayatollah, 
wants above all to preserve the regime and 
its Revolution— 
Unlike the Green Revolution of 2009. 
This is still true. 
So it stretches incredulity to believe they 
signed on to a deal that would in any way 
weaken the regime or threaten the goals of 
the Revolution. 
They will not. 
I understand that this deal represents a 
trade-off, a hope that things [might] be dif-
ferent in Iran in 10–15 years. 
Maybe Iran will desist from its nuclear am-
bitions. 
But it has not. 
Maybe they’ll stop exporting and sup-
porting terrorism. 
But it has not. 
Maybe they’ll stop holding innocent Amer-
icans hostage. 
But they have not. 
Maybe they’ll stop burning American flags. 
But it has not. 
Maybe their leadership will stop chanting 
‘‘Death to America’’ in the streets of Tehran. 
But it has not. Or the hope was 
maybe that they won’t do those things. 
Well, they have continued to do all of 
those things. 
While there are so many crises brew-
ing across the world, we cannot aban-
don our efforts to prevent a nuclear- 
armed Iran and the arms race it will 
surely set off in the Middle East. We 
cannot ignore Iran’s nefarious support 
for terrorism or accept threats to 
American interests and lives. We must 
welcome 
legitimate 
and 
verifiably 
peaceful uses of nuclear power but re-
main true to our nonproliferation prin-
ciples and our unyielding desire to 
build a more stable, safer, prosperous 
world for the American people and for 
all peace-loving people to thrive. In 
order to do so, Iran cannot and must 
not possess a nuclear weapon.

JONATHAN E. GIERKE, UNITED 
STATES MARINE CORPS 
HON. GREGORY F. MURPHY 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 1, 2022 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in great sorrow. On Jan-
uary 19, 2022, Lance Corporal (LCpl.) Jona-
than E. Gierke, from Lawrenceville, Georgia, 
tragically passed away as a result of a tactical 
vehicular rollover in Onslow County, North 
Carolina. LCpl. Gierke was stationed in my 
Congressional district at Camp Lejeune and 
was a Landing Support Specialist with Combat 
Logistics Battalion 24, Combat Logistics Regi-
ment 2, 2nd Marine Logistics Group. 
LCpl. Gierke was the son of a Navy veteran 
and a member of the Junior Reserve Officers’ 
Training Corps (JROTC) at Collins Hill High 
School, Georgia. He began his active duty in 
March of 2021. Since then, LCpl. Gierke’s as-
signments include being stationed at Marine 
Corps Recruit Depot, Parris Island, South 
Carolina; School of Infantry-East in Camp 
Lejeune, North Carolina; and Marine Corps 
Combat Service Support Schools in Camp 
Lejeune, North Carolina. 
LCpl. Gierke’s service to our country can 
best be shown by his attainment of the Na-
tional Defense and Global War on Terrorism 
Service Medals. His duty and commitment to 
our country will never be forgotten and I am 
forever grateful for all that he accomplished 
and for his service to our beloved country. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in re-
membering this patriot and recognizing all the 
sacrifices that he made for our beloved coun-
try.

HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 1, 2022 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Dr. Paul Antonik for his excep-
tional career culminating in his appointment as 
Chief Scientist for Connectivity and Dissemi-
nation at the Air Force Research Laboratory. 
Dr. Antonik dedicated his long and distin-
guished career to developing warfighting infor-
mation technologies for air, space, and cyber-
space forces. Dr. Antonik began his work with 
the Department of the Air Force in 1978 as an 
electronic engineer at the Rome Air Develop-
ment Center. After five years of service, he 
transitioned into the private sector, working on 
developing, designing, and evaluating sensor 
systems, waveforms, and signal processing 
techniques. In 1998, Dr. Antonik returned to 
government service and joined the Sensors 
Directorate at the Air Force Research Labora-
tory. Dr. Antonik’s exceptional work earned 
him a spot in the Senior Executive Service in 
2012 as the Chief Scientist for Connectivity 
and Dissemination. 
Dr. Antonik received six U.S. patents and 
authored or co-authored over fifty-five journals, 
papers, and reports. Additionally, Dr. Antonik 
won the prestigious Presidential Rank Award 
in 2019. As the Chief Scientist, Dr. Antonik led 
the Information Directorate as its principal sci-
entific advisor and oversaw technologies that 
span the functional areas of command and 
control, communication, computer, intelligence, 
and cyber. Throughout his career, Dr. Antonik 
served the Air Force in a multitude of roles de-
veloping sensor systems and knowledge-aided 
signal processing techniques. Dr. Antonik was 
an early advocate for applying artificial intel-
ligence into the radar signal processing chain, 
which is now a best practice for this type of 
work. 
I am grateful for Dr. Antonik’s over thirty 
years of service to the Air Force and his con-
tribution to the scientific community. On behalf 
of New York’s 21st Congressional District, I 
would like to congratulate Dr. Antonik on his 
retirement and wish him the best in his future 
endeavors.

She has spent years contributing to education 
in Northwest Florida in many capacities. She 
is currently working as an Exception Student 
Education Paraprofessional. 
In Northwest Florida, we are fortunate to 
have some of the best educators in the Na-
tion. It is recognized that working in education 
is one of the most difficult yet rewarding occu-
pations in existence. Mrs. Swords has dedi-
cated her life to educating children in a way 
that will best help them learn. 
Mrs. Swords support and outreach extend 
throughout Okaloosa County School District. 
Mrs. Swords has displayed dedication by 
working with students individually, according to 
their unique needs and by working in a 
childcare network as a teacher of four year 
olds. I commend her for her steadfast willing-
ness to serve those that matter most—the stu-
dents and youth of our Nation. 
For all of her admirable contributions to our 
community, I am truly proud to have Mrs. 
Swords as a constituent in Florida’s First Con-
gressional District. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the United 
States Congress, I am privileged to recognize 
Mrs. Swords for her many accomplishments, 
and her commitment to excellence, profes-
sionalism, innovation, and collaboration in the

HONORING THE CREW OF THE 
‘‘HORIZON RELIANCE’’ 
HON. KAIALI‘I KAHELE 
OF HAWAII 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 1, 2022 
Mr. KAHELE. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the men and women of the crew of 
the U.S. Flag commercial ship Horizon Reli-
ance, sailing out of Honolulu and operated by 
third-generation, family-owned Pasha Hawaii. 
On the evening of November 6, 2020—over 
1,000 miles northeast of O‘ahu—a private 
turbo-prop plane with two individuals onboard 
was enroute from California to Honolulu before 
suffering an engine casualty. As a pilot my-
self—with thousands of hours logged in both 
military and commercial passenger aircraft— 
believe me when I say that this is the worst 
possible scenario in aviation: to be in the mid-
dle of the ocean, 1,000 miles from the closest 
land, in the middle of the night when your one 
and only engine fails. 
As water rapidly filled the cabin, the two pi-
lots managed to escape the aircraft, clam-
bering into their life raft and called the Hono-
lulu Coast Guard Search and Rescue center 
via satellite phone. 
With 8–10 foot seas and 30 knot winds on- 
scene, the Coast Guard realized the gravity of 
the situation and quickly dispatched a mayday 
alert calling out for volunteer commercial ships 
to lend aid, as the distance from shore pre-
vented a search-and-rescue helicopter oper-
ation. 
Due to the hazardous conditions, the first 
ship to arrive on scene was unable to rescue 
the desperately heaving life raft, but was able 
to remain on scene rendering a glimmer of 
hope for the crash survivors. Shortly there-
after, the Horizon Reliance, under the com-
mand of Captain Mark Tuck, arrived and 
expertly commenced a small-boat operation to 
retrieve the survivors. Cautiously maneuvering 
the vessel under arduous conditions, the men 
and women of the Horizon Reliance—union 
members of the Masters, Mates and Pilots, 
Marine Engineers’ Beneficial Association, and 
Seafarers International Unions—recovered the 
pilots aboard the vessel and brought them to 
safety. 
I cannot overstate how truly close this inci-
dent came to tragedy; the lives of these two 
aircraft crash survivors, their families and 
friends were forever changed due to the ac-
tions of the crew of the Horizon Reliance that 
fateful evening. It speaks even more to the 
dedication and devotion to duty of the mari-
ners of the U.S. merchant fleet—the brave

RECOGNIZING 
CHRISTOPHER 
CHEW, 
CHIEF 
OF 
POLICE 
OF 
EVESHAM, NEW JERSEY 
HON. ANDY KIM 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 1, 2022 
Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I 
stand today to recognize Christopher Chew, 
Chief of Police for Evesham, New Jersey, for 
his 25 years of service to his community and 
our state. 
Eight months after graduating from Rowan 
University with a degree in criminal justice, 
Chief Chew began his career with the 
Evesham 
Township 
Police 
Department’s 
(ETPD) patrol bureau in February of 1997. He 
soon transferred to the investigative bureau, 
where he conducted investigations into the 
distribution of illegal narcotics alongside the 
Burlington County Prosecutors Office Nar-
cotics Task Force. 
In April of 2010, he was selected to com-
mand the newly created Office of Professional 
Standards, overseeing areas such as internal 
affairs, policy management, and accredita-
tions. In 2011 thanks to his leadership, ETPD 
became a nationally accredited law enforce-
ment agency through the Commission on Ac-
creditation of Law Enforcement Agencies 
(CALEA) and has been further accredited 
throughout the years. This merit, often de-
scribed as the ‘‘gold standard in public safety’’, 
places ETPD in the top one percent of agen-
cies across the country. This distinction is 
shared with only seven other municipal law 
enforcement agencies in New Jersey. 
In August of 2013, he was promoted to 
Chief of Evesham Police and over the course 
of his eight and a half years, Chief Chew 
sought to strengthen ties between his depart-
ment and our community. I had the pleasure 
of meeting Chief Chew in my first term as 
Congressman and came to know him and his 
commitment to tackling challenges in our com-
munity. Seeing an unprecedented increase in 
opioid overdoses and deaths, he worked with 
local drug counselors to provide immediate as-
sistance to anyone suffering from addiction 
through the ‘‘Straight to Treatment’’ program. 
In addition, officers and educators worked to-
gether under the #NotEvenOnce program at 
Cherokee High School to inform students 
about the dangers of opioid addiction. This 
interactive experience showed students the 
connection between the opioid epidemic at 
large and its connection to our community. 
Chief Chew was recently asked about his 
proudest accomplishment. He described new 
wellness and safety programs for the mem-
bers of his department which have yielded a 
healthier, more vibrant, collaborative, and pro-
ductive workforce. Outside organizations have 
described it as the ‘‘first of its kind’’ and has 
since become a model for other departments 
across the country. 
Chief Chew represents the best New Jersey 
has to offer—exemplifying service and being a 
positive example for others in our community. 
Despite his upcoming retirement next week, 
Chief Chew plans to remain active in the force 
and committed to passing on his knowledge to 
the department’s next generation of leader-
ship. I wish him the best of luck with his retire-
ment as he spends his time teaching yoga 
and writing, taking time to be with his wife, Ni-
cole, and two children, Michael and Natalie. 
May retirement bring him the happiness and 
comfort his service gave us for 25 years.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF 
TRAVIS ADAM STARK 
HON. BRIAN BABIN 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 1, 2022 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the 100th birthday of World War II 
veteran Travis Adam Stark. 
Travis Stark was born on January 31, 1922, 
in Blox, Texas, to parents George and Geor-
gia Stark. The eldest of nine children, Travis 
spent his youth working on the family farm in 
Bon Wier, Texas. At 19, he joined the Civilian 
Conservation Corps (CCC) and was sent to 
work in Zavalla, Texas. While employed with 
the CCC, he was chosen to assist a local col-
lege with trapping foxes for research pur-
poses. Due to the economic instability brought 
on by the Great Depression, he sent most of 
his wages back home to support his family. 
After 11 months with the CCC, Travis accept-
ed a job at the local shipyard and was there 
only a few weeks before being drafted by the 
United States Army. 
On November 4, 1942, Travis was assigned 
to Company C of the 844th Engineer Aviation 
Battalion. His job within the battalion was to 
build airstrips and operate and maintain heavy 
equipment. His company was sent to England 
just before D-Day. After our forces invaded 
Normandy, Travis’ company was sent to 
France. He was later stationed in Germany 
and then in Austria. While in Austria, he and 
11 other ‘‘good old boys’’ from Texas and Lou-
isiana were asked to hunt game to supple-
ment the Army’s rations with fresh meat. After 
doing his part to fill the stomachs of his fellow 
warfighters, Travis’s company was sent back 
to France, where they boarded a ship and re-
turned to America. For his military service, 
Travis received an honorable discharge on 
January 1, 1946, along with a European-Afri-
can-Middle Eastern (EAME) Campaign Medal, 
a Victory Ribbon, one Service Stripe, five 
Overseas Service Bars, and an Expert Rifle 
Badge. 
After his time in the Army ended, Travis re-
turned to Southeast Texas. He began working 
for Texaco, Inc., where he would remain for 
the next 39 years. Later, Travis married Bernis 
Kraus, and they had one daughter. He later 
became the proud grandfather of two grand-
daughters and the great-grandfather of five 
great-grandchildren. 
Madam Speaker, Travis spent his life loving 
God, his family, and his country. It is my honor 
to recognize him as an American patriot who 
valiantly answered the call to protect and de-
fend this great nation during the Second World 
War. I thank him for his inspiring service and 
dedication to our country.

HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 1, 2022 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Lauren 
Martens of SEIU for his 16 years of service to 
the Service Employee International Union 
(SEIU) Colorado State Council. 
For more than 40 years, Lauren has orga-
nized and fought tirelessly on issues in the 
labor community on many different issues. In 
his last position he fought and advocated for 
a raise to the minimum wage and won paid 
sick and family leave, passed and defended 
the Affordable Care Act, helped fund public 
services, defeated attacks on union rights, 
fought for immigrant and racial justice, and 
much more. 
He has been able to help support members 
fighting for and winning their union, making 
their voices heard in politics, and winning im-
provements in their lives at the bargaining 
table, including with the first-ever union con-
tract for state employees. I have admired 
Lauren’s passion to be part of the fight for jus-
tice and have worked with him over the years 
on numerous issues. His hard work and dedi-
cation to the labor community in Colorado is 
tremendous. 
I extend my deepest appreciation for Lauren 
Martens and his service and dedication to our 
community. I thank him for his continuous 
dedication to serving the people of Colorado.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF 
TUFAIL AHMAD 
HON. JAMIE RASKIN 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 1, 2022 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize one of my remarkable constitu-
ents, Tufail Ahmad, who passed away on Jan-
uary 13, 2022. Tufail dedicated his life to civic 
engagement and public service. His unwaver-
ing dedication to building a better future for his 
family, neighbors, friends and community is a 
true testament to the values we cherish as a 
country. 
Tufail was born on March 4, 1938 in the 
small village of Allahabad, India. As a young 
man, he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree and 
Master of Arts degree in Commerce from Al-
lahabad University before emigrating to Paki-
stan. While in Pakistan, Tufail worked as an 
assistant professor and then as the Deputy 
Auditor General for the Pakistan Audit and Ac-
counts Services. Tufail later travelled to the 
United States in 1968 as a member of the 
Pakistan audit team at United Nations Head-
quarters in New York City. After formally emi-
grating to the United States in 1973, Tufail 
briefly worked at a shipping firm before he 
proudly founded his own international trading 
firm, Euro-America Shipping and Trade Inc. 
After 27 years at the trading firm, Tufail 
went on to volunteer community service and 
served as a board member of the Committee 
for Montgomery, Progressive Maryland and 
the Upcounty Citizens Advisory Board. Tufail 
was also well known for his outstanding active

involvement in state and local politics, includ-
ing serving as Precinct Chair and D15 Caucus 
Chair. He was later recognized as Precinct Of-
ficial of the Year in 2004 and in 2018 was in-
ducted into the Montgomery County Human 
Rights Hall of Fame. 
In 2003, in what has become his enduring 
legacy, Tufail co-established the Montgomery 
County Muslim Council where he spearheaded 
efforts to boost civic engagement in the Mus-
lim community. He also co-founded the Mont-
gomery County Muslim Foundation, an organi-
zation that aspires to a hunger-free and hate- 
free society for all people, regardless of their 
faith, race or gender. Under Tufail’s deter-
mined leadership, the Montgomery County 
Muslim Foundation became one of the largest 
nonprofit charitable foundations in Mont-
gomery County. 
Tufail devoted his life to providing for, and 
sharing with, all of our people. His unshakable 
commitment to improving the lives of his 
friends, family, neighbors, and community em-
bodies true American patriotism. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in honoring the remarkable life and 
wonderful legacy of my constituent, Tufail 
Ahmad.

REMEMBERING MR. WELTON M. 
HOLMAN 
HON. TROY A. CARTER 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 1, 2022 
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to remember Mr. Welton M. Hol-
man, a well-known educator and student 
motivator of Monroe, Louisiana who entered 
the gates of heaven on January 24, 2022. 
Born in Monroe, Louisiana in 1946, Mr. Hol-
man attended Richwood High School and was 
known as an outstanding football player. He 
attended Southern University in Baton Rouge 
on a full football scholarship and in 1971, he 
graduated with his Bachelor of Science de-
gree—launching his lifelong journey of youth 
mentorship and coaching. 
Mr. 
Holman 
taught 
and 
coached 
in 
Moorehouse Parish, Union Parish, and Clai-
borne Parish before coming home to the Mon-
roe City School System at Carroll High 
School, where he spent most of his career 
teaching and coaching football. 
To further his education before retirement, 
he also attended Grambling State University 
and Louisiana Tech University where he re-
ceived his Masters of Science Degree. 
Even when he was technically retired, he 
continued his passion as a substitute teacher 
until he passed away. 
Whether they were on his team or not, most 
people called him ‘‘Coach.’’ 
Over the years, Mr. Holman mentored many 
students, engaging them with his personality 
and positive spirit. 
He appeared in theatrical performances, vol-
unteered for community clean-ups, and was 
famous for his pep rally rendition of ‘‘Members 
Only.’’ 
Coach’s dream was to inspire and support 
young people, and he undoubtedly has 
achieved this dream and has made a lasting 
difference on his community. 
My deepest prayers are with Mr. Holman’s 
family, friends, students, and loved ones in 
this difficult time, especially his stepdaughter, 
my dear friend Louisiana State Senator 
Katrina Jackson. 
May you find comfort in scripture that reads, 
‘‘I can do all things through Christ which 
strengthens me’’ (Philippians 4:13 ). 
May they continue to live his dream as they 
cherish so many beautiful memories they had 
with him, and may Welton ‘‘Coach’’ Holman 
rest in heavenly peace.

ZACHARY 
W. 
RIFFLE, 
UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS 
HON. GREGORY F. MURPHY 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 1, 2022 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in great sorrow. On Jan-
uary 19, 2022, Private First Class (PFC) 
Zachary W. Riffle, from Kingwood, West Vir-
ginia, tragically passed away as a result of a 
tactical vehicular rollover in Onslow County, 
North Carolina. PFC Riffle was stationed in my 
Congressional district at Camp Lejeune and 
was a Landing Support Specialist with Combat 
Logistics Battalion 24, Combat Logistics Regi-
ment 2, 2nd Marine Logistics Group. 
PFC Riffle began his active duty in March of 
2021. Since then, PFC Riftle’s assignments in-
clude being stationed at Marine Corps Recruit 
Depot Parris Island, South Carolina; School of 
Infantry-East at Camp Lejeune, North Caro-
lina; and Marine Corps Combat Service Sup-
port Schools. 
PFC Riffle graduated from Preston High 
School, West Virginia where he played football 
and wrestled. His service to our country can 
best be shown by his decision to forgo his 
senior wrestling season to graduate early and 
become a Marine as soon as possible. In ad-
dition, PFC Riffle’s selfless commitment to our 
nation can be shown by his attainment of the 
National Defense and Global War on Ter-
rorism Service Medals. His duty and commit-
ment to our country will never be forgotten 
and I am forever grateful for all that he accom-
plished and for his service to our beloved 
country. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in re-
membering this patriot and recognizing all the 
sacrifices that he made for our beloved coun-
try.

HONORING BARBARA PEARCE AND 
JOE MOONEY FOR THEIR OUT-
STANDING 
CONTRIBUTIONS 
TO 
CONNECTICUT HOSPICE 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 1, 2022 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, nestled 
along the shore in Branford, Connecticut lies 
Connecticut Hospice, an organization founded 
in 1974 by Florence Wald, then an Associate 
Professor and Dean of the Mental Health and 
Psychiatric Nursing Program at Yale Univer-
sity, and dedicated to delivering coordinated, 
comprehensive and compassionate care to 
people with terminal illnesses and their fami-
lies. 
Connecticut Hospice was the first such or-
ganization of its kind in our nation and over 
the years, has cared for thousands of patients 
and provided comfort to them and their loved 
ones in their final days, becoming a national 
model of care and inspiring thousands of simi-
lar programs in other communities. Indeed, it 
was at Connecticut Hospice that I spent the 
last weeks with my mother, Luisa. 
Just a few years ago, Connecticut Hospice 
was facing some difficult challenges and found 
itself in need of an organizational shake-up. 
That is when Barbara Pearce and Joe Mooney 
stepped up and became an integral part of 
Connecticut Hospice reaching a new bar of 
care and standard of service. Barbara took on 
the role of Chief Executive Officer and Joe the 
dual responsibilities of Chief Operating Officer 
and Chief Financial Officer. 
Barbara Pearce, an active community leader 
and philanthropist, has dedicated countless 
years of service to a number of organizations 
as a board member or advisor. When she 
learned of the troubles at Connecticut Hos-
pice, she decided to take on an enormous 
task. In her own words, Connecticut Hospice 
‘‘is the mothership. We are the one that peo-
ple look to and visit from around the country 
and around the world to see how cutting-edge, 
end-of-life care is delivered.’’ For that reason, 
‘‘it is not enough to give good care.’’ As staff 
and volunteers will attest, Barbara was 
straightforward about the tough decisions that 
needed to be made. And anyone who knows 
Barbara will tell you, once she is focused on 
a goal, she is a force of nature. 
Recently retired from state service as a 
Deputy Commissioner at the Connecticut De-
partment of Revenue Services and with over 
forty years of experience as a financial execu-
tive in both the government and private sector, 
Joe Mooney was just the person Connecticut 
Hospice needed to step in as Chief Operating 
Officer and Chief Financial Officer. With his 
background, Joe was in a unique position to 
utilize his talents and expertise to not only 
right the ship but ensure its solid foundation 
for the future. 
Since its inception, Connecticut Hospice has 
always been a leader in caring for the termi-
nally ill and their families. Under the careful di-
rection of Barbara and Joe, the organization 
has navigated many challenges and obstacles, 
including the Covid–19 pandemic. Though 
they both originally planned for their interven-
tion to be brief, they have chosen to stay on. 
It is their vision and leadership that will ensure 
Connecticut Hospice can continue in its mis-
sion to provide the very best of comfort and 
care to the terminally ill and their loves ones 
in the most vulnerable of times. It is a gift we 
are all beyond grateful to them to have pre-
served. It is my honor to join the staff, volun-
teers and families of Connecticut Hospice in 
extending my deepest thanks and appreciation 
to Barbara Pearce and Joe Mooney for their 
outstanding efforts on behalf of this very spe-
cial organization. I look forward to continuing 
our work together.

APPLAUDING 
PINELLAS 
PARK 
HIGH SCHOOL FOR THREE CON-
GRESSIONAL 
APP 
CHALLENGE 
WINS 
HON. CHARLIE CRIST 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 1, 2022 
Mr. CRIST. Madam Speaker, I am honored 
to congratulate the students, teachers, and 
alumni of my home district’s own Pinellas Park 
High School for winning the 2021 Congres-
sional App Challenge for Florida’s 13th Con-
gressional District. This will be Pinellas Park 
High School’s third winning submission to the 
Congressional App Challenge in only five 
years—the most for any school in Florida’s 
13th District. 
Since our first Congressional App Challenge 
in 2017, the students of the Pinellas Park High 
School STEM Club have submitted highly 
original and technically sophisticated apps ad-
dressing the needs of the culturally-diverse 
communities 
I’m 
honored 
to 
represent. 
Helmed by their dedicated STEM teacher, 
Lafrance ‘‘Joe’’ Clark, this club has proven 
time and again the power of hands-on STEM 
instruction, collaboration, and teamwork. 
Over the past five years, the winning teams 
of Pinellas Park High School have created 
apps that address a host of issues facing our 
community. From large challenges like those 
confronting Pinellas Veterans transitioning to 
civilian life, to smaller but still important ones 
like the lack of accessible information on teen 
skincare, these students have used tech-
nology to tackle the tough problems they see 
in the world around them. This year’s winning 
submission, Healthy Minds, is no exception— 
providing a platform for teens experiencing 
mental health challenges to access health pro-
viders, resources, and expert information. 
As the Representative for Florida’s 13th 
Congressional District, I want to congratulate 
our 2021 Congressional App Challenge win-
ners—Trudy Kwok, Jenna Nguyen, Gabriel 
Moreno, and Rashonda Fayson. Under the 
leadership of the excellent Mr. Joe Clark, they 
are doing their STEM club, school, and com-
munity proud.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF LUSIA ‘‘LUCY’’ HARRIS STEW-
ART 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 1, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and 
service of a remarkable individual basketball 
champion, Lusia ‘‘Lucy’’ Harris Stewart. 
Lucy was born February 10, 1955, in Minter 
City, Mississippi to Ethel and Willie Harris. 
Lucy, at the age of 66, was called to her heav-
enly resting place on Wednesday, January 18, 
2022, 
at 
Greenwood-Leflore 
Hospital 
in 
Greenwood, MS. 
From her humble beginnings in rural Leflore 
County, Lucy, along with her eleven siblings, 
were raised on a system of integrity premised 
on the tenets of love, kindness and compas-
sion imparted by their parents who instilled a 
central moral compass that echoed the heart 
of the Good Samaritan and core ethical values 
encompassed in the importance of work, fam-
ily, community, and the love of God. 
A graduate of Amanda Elzy High School in 
Greenwood, MS, Lucy received a Bachelor of 
Science in Education degree in health, phys-
ical education, and recreation in 1977, a mas-
ter’s degree in education in 1984 and an hon-
orary doctorate degree in 2014—all from Delta 
State University. Lucy still owns a plethora of 
Lady Statesmen basketball records and has 
the honor of holding another distinction: at the 
1976 Olympics, Lucy scored the first points 
ever recorded in an Olympic women’s basket-
ball game. Lucy changed the face of women’s 
basketball. Opponents called her unstoppable 
but even that barely described her approach 
to the game. 
To this date, Lucy is still Delta State’s ca-
reer record holder in points (2,891) and re-
bounds (1,662) and averaged 25.9 points and 
14.5 rebounds per game in 115 career games 
played. Lucy shot an astonishing 63.3 percent 
from the field in her illustrious collegiate ca-
reer. 
She holds the distinction as being the first 
female, collegiate player inducted in the Na-
tional Basketball Hall of Fame (1992) and is a 
member of the Women’s Basketball Hall of 
Fame (1999). She is also a member of the 
Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame (1990) and 
the Delta State Sports Hall of Fame (1983). 
Lucy collected Kodak All-American honors in 
1975, 1976, and 1977, and was the Mis-
sissippi Sportsperson of the Year in 1976. She 
became the first and only woman drafted by 
the NBA, when the New Orleans Jazz se-
lected her in the 1977 draft. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life, legacy, and service of 
Mrs. Lusia ‘‘Lucy’’ Harris Stewart.

HONORING THE LIFE OF DON 
HANSEN 
HON. MIKE LEVIN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 1, 2022 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to pay tribute to Don Hansen, who 
passed away on January 5, 2022. 
In 1938, as a young boy, Don and his family 
moved from Iowa to San Clemente, a beautiful 
beach town in my congressional district in 
Southern California. When Don turned twelve, 
he worked at the San Clemente Pier, hauling 
fish from arriving ships to the shore. Later, 
Don enlisted in the United States Coast Guard 
at the age of eighteen, serving four years— 
with two of those years stationed in Guam. 
Don moved back to San Clemente after his 
honorable discharge, working at a sportfishing 
company that he would ultimately buy in 1966. 
Each season, Don took over 10,000 fishermen 
into the waters off the coast of Southern Cali-
fornia. In 1970, he was honored as San 
Clemente’s ‘‘Citizen of the Year’’ for his ef-
forts. 
A year later, Don moved his operation a few 
miles north of San Clemente to Dana Point 
Harbor, founding Dana Wharf Sportfishing and 
Whale Watching, the harbor’s first business. 
During that time, he helped jumpstart the 
whale watching industry and created the first 
and longest-running annual whale festival in 
the world, the Dana Point Festival of Whales. 
In March 2021, I was honored to celebrate the 
Festival’s 50th anniversary with Don and his 
family. 
Beyond his role as a business owner and 
leader of his community, Don was always a 
strong advocate for sustainable fishing. The 
Coastal Conservation Association of California 
awarded Don its highest honor, the Anthony 
Hsieh Conservation Award, for his decades of 
work 
to 
improve 
the 
accessibility 
of 
sportfishing. He maintained positions on the 
Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission, 
Pacific Fisheries Management Council, and 
the Sportfishing Association of California. He 
is survived by his children, David, Michael, 
Jeff, Donna, Jane, and Jenifer, and his 15 
grandchildren. 
Don Hansen lived an incredible and full life. 
He was a central part of his community and 
his love of the ocean and his dedication to the 
conservation, understanding, and appreciation 
of whales changed Southern California for the 
better. We are grateful for his service and con-
tributions to his community.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 1, 2022 
Mr. GAETZ. Madam Speaker, I rise to rec-
ognize Ms. Saronda Lewis as the Walton 
County Educational Support Professional of 
the Year. Since August of 1998, Ms. Lewis 
has served the Walton County School District 
with exceptional passion and an unwavering 
commitment to serving others. 
In Northwest Florida, we are fortunate to 
have some of the best educational support 
professionals in the Nation. It is recognized 
that the position of Food Services Manager 
can be difficult but can also be so rewarding. 
Ms. Lewis has performed her many duties 
without any question, while also committing to 
provide a big smile for all those she encoun-
ters. 
Her support and outreach extend far beyond 
the hearts and minds of her own students 
through her willingness to help wherever as-
sistance is needed. Ms. Lewis has displayed 
dedicated teamwork by coordinating events, 
like Freeport’s Annual Bayfest and the Spring 
Festival. I commend her for her steadfast will-
ingness to serve as an example for those that 
matter most, the students and youth of our 
Nation. 
For all of her admirable contributions, I am 
truly proud to have Ms. Lewis as a constituent 
in Florida’s First Congressional District. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the United 
States Congress, I am privileged to recognize 
Ms. Saronda Lewis for her accomplishments 
and her commitment to excellence, profes-
sionalism, innovation, and collaboration in the 
Walton County School District. I thank her for 
her service and wish her all the best for con-
tinued success.

Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor an extraordinary American 
patriot, soldier, mentor, and hero, Lt. Gen. 
(RET.) Robert Lewis ‘‘Sam’’ Wetzel. He 
transitioned on Thursday, January 20, 2022. 
His Funeral Mass was held on Friday, January 
28, 2022, at 1:00 p.m. at St. Anne Catholic 
Church in Columbus, Georgia followed by a 
military burial at the Fort Benning National 
Cemetery and visitation at the National Infan-
try Museum and Soldier Center. 
Lt. Gen. (RET.) Robert Lewis ‘‘Sam’’ Wetzel 
was born in Clarksburg, West Virginia on Oc-
tober 6, 1930. His impressive 34-year military 
career began after he graduated from Irving 
High School in 1948. He planned to attend 
Purdue University, but ultimately went to the 
United States Military Academy at West Point. 
After graduating from West Point in 1952 as 
an Infantry Officer, he was immediately de-
ployed to Korea, where he served as a Com-
pany Commander. In 1961, as a captain, he 
commanded a mechanized infantry company 
in Germany. 
In 1968, as a Lieutenant Colonel, Wetzel 
was deployed to South Vietnam to serve as 
the commander of the 4th Battalion, 31st In-
fantry Regiment (United States), also known 
as the ‘‘Polar Bears’’. During a firefight, an 
enemy bullet grazed his forehead leaving a 
small but permanent scar. The abrasion and 
his actions during the Vietnam War prompted 
his nomination for a Purple Heart, which he 
declined, however, believing that his wound 
was not severe enough to warrant being 
awarded a Purple Heart. 
Following his return from Vietnam, he was 
promoted to the rank of Colonel and assumed 
command of a brigade at Fort Carson, Colo-
rado. In 1975, following promotion to the rank 
of Brigadier General, he was sent to West 
Germany, where he commanded the First In-
fantry Division. Following his command with 
the First Infantry Division, he received his sec-
ond star from the Commander of all European 
and American forces in Europe, the renowned, 
General Alexander Haig. 
Wetzel went on to serve as General Haig’s 
Chief of Staff in Belgium from 1978 to 1979. 
During this time, he worked with his staff to 
develop a response to the Soviet Union’s de-
ployment of nuclear missiles in Europe. The 
ultimate strategy was to deploy the Perishing 
II missiles in Europe, so that Moscow could be 
hit in a matter of minutes, shortening the re-
sponse time for the Soviet Union. Unfortu-
nately, domestic political battles began in 
NATO countries about deploying the Pershing 
II missiles, and that strategy was deferred. 
After his tenure as General Haig’s Chief of 
Staff, Wetzel commanded the Third Infantry 
Division in Wu¨rzburg, where he led his division 
to victory in the annual war games staged in 
West Germany. 
In 1981, Wetzel was diagnosed with what 
was thought to be terminal melanoma cancer 
and was given less than a year to live. During 
this time, the Army offered him full medical 
disability in exchange for retirement, but he re-
fused the offer, signed a waiver, and remained 
on active duty. The Army sent him back to the 
United States, where he managed to make a 
full recovery and assume command of the in-
fantry training center in Fort Benning, Georgia. 
In 1983, Wetzel was promoted to the rank 
of Lieutenant General and sent to Germany as 
the Deputy Commander in Chief of U.S. 
Forces in Europe as the NATO allies had fi-
nally approved the Pershing II plan. Upon his 
arrival, Wetzel’s main responsibility was to re-
ceive and deploy the Pershing II missiles amid 
anti-war demonstrations all over Europe. It is 
argued that the Perishing II plan was one of 
three key factors that contributed to the defeat 
of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold 
War. 
In 1986, Senior Military Assistant to the 
Secretary of Defense, Colin Powell, suc-
ceeded Wetzel in command of V Corps in 
Frankfurt, Germany. This was his last assign-
ment before retirement. 
Following his military service, he continued 
to serve his community and make a positive 
impact in the lives of others. His contributions 
include serving as the Commander in Chief of 
the Military Order of the World Wars, a Vet-
erans organization of commissioned officers, 
which is committed to promoting national se-
curity, patriotism, good citizenship, and service 
to one’s country. During his stint as Com-
mander in Chief, he worked tirelessly to edu-
cate the public, local civic clubs like Kiwanis 
and Rotary, and the media on national secu-
rity issues while also instilling patriotism and 
leadership skills in young people through Boy 
Scouts, Girl Scouts, JROTC, ROTC, and other 
youth programs. 
Among his numerous honors and awards 
are the Army Distinguished Service Medal, a 
Bronze Star, two Legions of Merit, six Air 
Medals, a Joint Superior Service Medal, a 
Meritorious Service Medal, and a Combat In-
fantryman’s Badge with Star. 
Lt. Gen. (RET.) Wetzel accomplished much 
throughout his life, but none of this would 
have been possible without his enduring faith 
in God and the love and support of his wife, 
Eileen; their children, Margaret, Robert, Ei-
leen, Theodore, Patricia, Catherine, and Mi-
chael; and a host of other family, friends, and 
associates, all of whom will miss him dearly. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
in the House of Representatives join my wife, 
Vivian, and me, along with the more than 
730,000 residents of the Second Congres-
sional District of Georgia in paying tribute to 
Lt. Gen. (RET.) Robert Lewis ‘‘Sam’’ Wetzel 
for his extraordinary service to his nation, his 
community, and to humankind. We extend our 
deepest condolences to his family, friends, 
and all those who mourn his loss.

HONORING AND CONGRATULATING 
THE SERVICE OF LT. COL. JOHN 
‘‘KARL’’ MARKS 
HON. VICKY HARTZLER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 1, 2022 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor and congratulate the service of 
one of the highest-time fighter pilots in the 
U.S. Air Force, Lt. Col. John ‘‘Karl’’ Marks. 
On September 1, 2021, U.S. Air Force Re-
serve pilot, Lt. Col. Marks made history when-
ever he became the only pilot to reach 7,000 
hours in the A–10C Warthog; in addition to be-
coming one of the highest-time fighter pilots in 
the U.S. Air Force. Lt. Col. Marks is assigned 
to the 442nd Fighter Wing based out of White-
man Air Force Base. He has an impressive 
career which spans over three decades with 
over 3,610 flights, 1,150 combat hours from 
thirteen combat deployments in multiple thea-
ters of operations, and his most memorable 
combat mission of the destruction of 23 Iraqi 
tanks in a trio of missions during Desert 
Storm. 
It has been said that Lt. Col. Marks is a 
humble and outstanding attack pilot who loves 
to fly and brings an immense amount of in-
valuable knowledge to the 442nd Fighter 
Wing. Among the incredible feat of achieving 
7,000 hours in a single aircraft type, Lt. Col. 
Marks has had memorable missions from 
Desert Storm I, Desert Storm II, and from Af-
ghanistan. During his time in Afghanistan’s 
Kunar Valley in 2014, Lt. Col. Marks was able 
to help extract a Jaguar 20 squadron which 
was surrounded by the Taliban with no casual-
ties. This is just one of the many successful 
combat missions Lt. Col. Marks has had. 
It is with great honor that I recognize the 
dedicated service of U.S. Air Force Pilot Lt. 
Col. John ‘‘Karl’’ Marks. Please join me in con-
gratulating this true American hero for his 
dedicated valor and service to our Nation.

IN RECOGNITION OF SERVICE OF 
NAMI NEW HAMPSHIRE EXECU-
TIVE DIRECTOR KENNETH NOR-
TON 
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 1, 2022 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in recognition of Kenneth Norton’s nearly 20 
years of service to the National Alliance of 
Mental Illness of New Hampshire. For the past 
two decades, Ken has served his community 
as a steadfast advocate for mental health 
services and suicide prevention leading the 
way before many in today’s society recognized 
the importance of behavioral health. 
Ken started with NAMI NH in 2003 to help 
create and grow prevention programing and 
spread awareness to policy makers, providers, 
and families across our state. By focusing his 
efforts on the organizations three cornerstones 
of support, education and advocacy, Ken has 
significantly expanded NAMI’s presence in 
New Hampshire after stepping into the role of 
Executive Director in 2011. Under his leader-
ship, the staff of NAMI NH, the budget, and 
the number of people served has quadrupled 
in size recognized by their well-deserved Non-
profit Impact Award from the NH Center for 
Nonprofits in 2019. 
By working with lawmakers and the public 
advocates such as NAMI NH and other mental 
health advocates, Congress has delivered ex-
panded funding opportunities to prevent, edu-
cate, and treat our communities in need. 
Using these new grant opportunities NAMI NH 
offers Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) Mental 
Health Awareness & Deescalation training for 
our police, fire, and EMS. This allows our first 
responders to learn how to best manage indi-
viduals experiencing mental illness so they

may protect the public while ensuring their 
own safety in these scenarios. NAMI pro-
grams, such as CIT, help develop profes-
sionals and individuals from all backgrounds 
and strengthen the communities they serve. 
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic 
we have seen increased anxiety, fear, isola-
tion, and grief from people of all ages increas-
ing the need for mental health services. The 
strain placed on hospitals to treat this new in-
fectious disease has limited access to critical 
services including behavior health. Yet advo-
cates like Ken never faltered despite this un-
precedented time and continued his efforts to 
support community members in need of be-
havioral health services. 
While in Congress I am proud to have 
worked with Ken to open opportunities for 
mental health, suicide prevention, and addition 
services, and I am grateful for the devoted 
staff and volunteers at NAMI NH for their tre-
mendous work. 
On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-
shire’s First Congressional District, I want to 
thank Ken for his continued dedication to the 
wellbeing of fellow Granite Staters and wish 
him the best as he transitions from his role as 
Executive Director.

HONORING RETIRED ARMY COLO-
NEL MIKE PLUMMER FOR HIS 
DEDICATION IN SERVING FORT 
DRUM AND THE NORTH COUN-
TRY 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 1, 2022 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor and remember the extraor-
dinary life of retired Army Colonel Mike Plum-
mer. Colonel Mike Plummer played a pivotal 
role in reactivating the 10th Mountain Infantry 
Division and bringing it to Fort Drum, New 
York. Col. Plummer’s prioritization of creating 
an enduring bond between Fort Drum and the 
community forever changed the North Coun-
try. Col. Plummer graduated from the U.S. 
Military Academy at West Point in 1960 prior 
to serving in Vietnam. For the next thirty 
years, Col. Plummer valiantly served in infan-
try units at every level of the XVIII Airborne 
Corps. 
While working at the Pentagon during the 
waning days of the Cold War, Col. Plummer 
recognized the growing importance of light in-
fantry units. He was tasked with flying to 
northern New York to scope out Fort Drum as 
a potential base for the newly reactivated 10th 
Mountain Light Infantry Division. This visit 
would sway Col. Plummer into advocating for 
Fort Drum to be the home of the 10th Moun-
tain Division. He believed the harsh winter 
conditions of Fort Drum would create a divi-
sion that was prepared for any environment 
they may encounter. In 1984, Plummer 
brought the 10th Mountain Division to Fort 
Drum and immediately prioritized creating a 
strong relationship between the military and 
the North Country community. The required 
expansion of Fort Drum, prior to the arrival of 
the 10th Mountain Division, created many jobs 
and stimulated the economy in the North 
Country. Plummer’s role in introducing the 
10th 
Mountain 
Division 
into 
the 
region 
changed the North Country and the Watertown 
community forever. 
After serving as the 10th Mountain Divi-
sion’s first Chief of Staff at Fort Drum, Col. 
Plummer retired in 1991. Following his retire-
ment from the Army, Col. Plummer remained 
committed to improving the North Country 
community and bettering the lives of Fort 
Drum soldiers. In 1992, Col. Plummer created 
the Adopt-a-Platoon program, which gathered 
community members together to write letters 
and send care packages to deployed soldiers 
and host a pizza party when they returned. 
This program started out local in the North 
Country and has now developed into a na-
tional program that has adopted service mem-
bers of all branches of the military. The suc-
cess of the Adopt-a-Platoon program is en-
tirely due to Col. Plummer’s dedication to en-
suring the local community supports their serv-
ice members. 
Col. Plummer dedicated his career to im-
proving the lives of others. In addition to the 
Adopt-a-Platoon 
program, 
Col. 
Plummer 
served as an advisor to the Board of Directors 
of Advocate Drum, created the Yellow Ribbon 
campaign, organized scholarship funds for 
family members of the 10th Mountain Division 
soldiers killed or wounded in action. Helped 
establish the soldier 101 program in the North 
Country to give the community a better under-
standing of the life of a soldier, and developed 
the idea for the ‘‘North Country Honors the 
Mountain’’ monument in Watertown’s Thomp-
son Park. This monument commemorates the 
lasting impact that the 10th Mountain Division 
has on the North Country and pays tribute to 
the sacrifice of every Fort Drum soldier. 
Col. Plummer has made an indelible impact 
on the North Country and Fort Drum. Through-
out his entire life he put his family, the 10th 
Mountain Division, and the North Country 
above himself. On behalf of New York’s 21st 
Congressional District, I am honored to re-
member and celebrate the life of Col. Mike 
Plummer. The impact he has made on the 
North Country can never be overstated.

TRIBUTE TO HONOR THE LIFE OF 
LEONARD WARE 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 1, 2022 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the rich life and distinguished career 
of Leonard Ware. Leonard was born on Janu-
ary 19, 1928, in Everett, Washington, and died 
at his Palo Alto home on December 19, 2021. 
With him at his death bed were his wife 
Jeanne, and his dog Jake. 
Leonard Ware earned his undergraduate 
degree from the University of Washington and 
his law degree from Syracuse University in 
1953. He was a member of the honorary legal 
society Phi Delta Phi. 
Leo served as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in 
the Western District of Washington from 1953 
to 1955, and was a member of the Palo Alto 
Planning Commission from 1965 to 1968. He 
was a member of the Palo Alto, Santa Clara 
County, Washington State and American Bar 
Associations. He was also a member of the 
State Bar of California and the California Trial 
Lawyers Association, as well as the Palo Alto 
Club and the Bohemian Club. 
Based on a handshake in 1969, Leo and his 
friend John Freidenrich established their law 
firm which became known as Ware Fletcher 
and Freidenrich. The firm prospered, merged 
several times and was eventually acquired by 
the global firm of DLA Piper. 
Leo went to Mississippi in the ‘60s to reg-
ister Black voters and was a staunch sup-
porter of civil rights laws. He was an original 
investor in Embarcadero Media, on the original 
board of University National Bank and Trust, 
and with his wife, was a strong supporter of 
many non-profit organizations. 
Leo loved spending time at his ranch in 
Morgan Hill where he raised animals and grew 
grapes, and he will be deeply missed by ev-
eryone who had the privilege to know him. 
Leo leaves his wife of 62 years, Jeanne, 
and his daughters Laura and Pamela, his son 
Lincoln, nine grandchildren and three great 
grandchildren. His daughter Jennifer pre-
deceased him. 
Madam Speaker, I ask the entire House of 
Representatives to join me in extending our 
condolences to Leonard Ware’s family, and in 
honoring Leo for the excellence of his life, his 
work and his countless contributions. We are 
a better community and a stronger country be-
cause of him.

dents and played a critical role in ensuring

RECOGNIZING MR. LANCE CLIMER 
AS THE WALTON COUNTY, FLOR-

HON. MATT GAETZ 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 1, 2022 
Mr. GAETZ. Madam Speaker, I rise to rec-

TRIBUTE TO CHERYL A. HICKMON 
HON. JAMES E. CLYBURN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 1, 2022 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to a dedicated community 
servant, mentor, and advocate for social jus-
tice and economic empowerment. Cheryl A. 
Hickmon, the 27th National President of Delta 
Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc., transitioned from

ford, Connecticut. She was born on May 11, 
1962, to the late Dr. Ned Hickmon and 
Consuella Anderson Hickmon. She was a

in Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. began 
when she was initiated through the Alpha Xi

Alpha Xi. Chapter (1983 to 1984) and South 
Atlantic Regional Representative (1984 to 
1986). After graduating from South Carolina

icine. She supervised the In Vitro Fertilization 
Laboratories for Andrology and Endocrinology. 
Cheryl Hickmon was highly skilled and experi-
enced in the specialties of Andrology and En-
docrinology. One of her greatest joys was as-
sisting couples with the gift of children. 
Cheryl Hickmon served her community in 
various ways; the NAACP, the National Coun-
cil of Negro Women, the National Brotherhood 
of Skiers, and was a member of St. Monica’s 
Episcopal Church. She was the recipient of

pleasure of knowing Cheryl Hickmon agree 
that she embodied integrity, grace, and an un-
selfish, giving spirit. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you and my col-
leagues to join me in commemorating the life 
of Cheryl A. Hickmon, a woman who led with 
humility and lived by the motto, ‘‘Don’t meas-
ure life by the number of breaths you take, but 
by the number of moments that take your 
breath away.’’
