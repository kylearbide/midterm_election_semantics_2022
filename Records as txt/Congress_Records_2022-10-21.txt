PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
God of grace and God of glory, put a 
new song in our hearts this day. May 
our mouths sing praise to You, our 
God. 
Many are the wonders You have 
done. We need only look around us and 
bear witness to Your remarkable cre-
ation. Gracious are Your plans for us. 
Your love is revealed daily in the op-
portunities You lay before us and the 
friends and family with whom You 
have surrounded us. 
We look upon Your majesty and 
tremble when we realize how insuffi-
cient our efforts are before You. May 
our trust in You serve to bridge the 
distance that stands between Your in-
tent and our best laid plans. 
Blessed are those who trust in You. 
Better off are they who rely on You 
and not on their own pride, who yield 
to Your truth and do not turn to follow 
false gods. 
O Lord, You are our help and our de-
liverer. May all who seek You discover 
the gladness to be found in You. May 
those who long for Your saving help 
soon find reason to proclaim Your 
greatness. 
We offer our songs of praise and the 
prayers of our hearts by the power of 
Your name. 
Amen.

HONORING MRS. ANGELA LICATA 
AND HER TERM AS PRESIDENT 
OF THE ASSOCIATION OF METRO-
POLITAN WATER AGENCIES 
HON. THOMAS R. SUOZZI 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 21, 2022 
Mr. SUOZZI. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the dedicated service of Angela 
Licata as she nears the conclusion of her term 
as President of the Association of Metropolitan 
Water Agencies. 
Angela has spent more than thirty years of 
her career at the New York City Department of 
Environmental Protection, which each day de-
livers more than one billion gallons of fresh, 
clean drinking water to the taps of nine million 
customers throughout New York State. Over 
the years Angela has played key roles in con-
tributing to New York City’s PlaNYC blueprint 
for sustainable growth, identifying climate 
change adaptation strategies, launching anal-
yses of sustainable water rate structures, and 
managing capital expense budgets to ensure 
appropriate investment in the infrastructure 
necessary to provide safe and reliable water 
service. 
In addition, Angela has been a leader 
among her colleagues at the nation’s drinking 
water utilities. Since 2014 she has served on 
the Board of Directors of the Association of 
Metropolitan Water Agencies (AMWA), an or-
ganization representing the nation’s largest 
publicly owned drinking water systems. She 
began her term as President of AMWA’s 
board in 2020. During her time on the board 
she has testified before Congress on the chal-
lenges posed by lead service lines, actively 
participated in initiatives to increase diversity 
in the water sector, and outlined innovative 
approaches to achieving collaboration be-
tween climate scientists and the water utility 
community. 
This month, Angela’s term as President of 
AMWA’s board will come to an end. Madam 
Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join with me 
today in recognizing Angela Licata for her 
service to AMWA, the people of New York, 
and the water sector as a whole. I am proud 
to count Angela among my constituents, and 
I wish her continued success and happiness in 
her career.

RECOGNIZING MS. MAGAZINE 
HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 21, 2022 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. 
I rise to recognize Ms. Magazine for its work 
to provide comprehensive coverage of wom-
en’s issues and to celebrate the magazine’s 
fiftieth anniversary. 
When feminist activists Gloria Steinem and 
Dorothy Pittman Hughes started Ms. Magazine 
in December 1971 with a 40-page insert inside 
New York magazine, few could have predicted 
its longevity and its far-reaching impact. But 
the magazine immediately struck a chord with 
women, selling 300,000 copies in eight days 
and generating 26,000 subscription orders and 
more than 20,000 reader letters within weeks. 
While most magazines marketed to women 
at the time emphasized domestic topics such 
as the importance of finding a husband, Ms. 
Magazine featured stories on prominent wom-
en’s issues including abortion, the Equal 
Rights Amendment, domestic violence, and 
sexual harassment. 
In July 1972, the first issue of Ms. Magazine 
was published with an image of Wonder 
Woman on the cover. In the same issue, 53 
women, including Billie Jean King, Nora 
Ephron, and Gloria Steinem, signed a ‘‘we 
have had abortions petition,’’ one year before 
the Supreme Court’s landmark decision in Roe 
v. Wade. 
In the years following, Ms. Magazine has 
covered and influenced the feminist move-
ment. On a personal note, the magazine also 
profoundly impacted my career aspirations 
and legislative agenda in both the New York 
City Council and in Congress. 
Over the course of my career, I didn’t have 
to call Ms. Magazine five times to convince 
them to cover issues and legislation like the 
Debbie Smith Act, the horrific crime of sex 
trafficking, and the Equal Rights Amendment. 
Ms. Magazine also faithfully chronicled my 
20-year fight to create the National Women’s 
History Museum on the Mall. Without Ms. 
Magazines’ coverage and advocacy, we might 
still be fighting. 
Women comprise half the population. But 
we get nowhere near half the attention on crit-
ical issues. Most other magazines and new 
outlets swoop in to cover monumental wom-
en’s issues like the rollback of Roe. v. Wade. 
But Ms. Magazine is there every day to cover 
issues of importance to women and to shine 
the light on women’s often-hidden contribu-
tions to all fields. 
I join millions of women worldwide in recog-
nizing the extraordinary accomplishments and 
contributions of Ms. Magazine over the past 
50 years, and in wishing them every success 
in the next 50. Because Ms. Magazine isn’t 
just a magazine. It’s a movement.

HONORING THE CAREER OF JOHN 
WALKER 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 21, 2022 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor John Walker, a Central Valley born 
photojournalist who dedicated his career to 
documenting the world around us. John used 
his craft and camera lens to capture the joys 
and sorrows of our community and tell count-
less stories that helped emotionally connect us 
all. 
John’s passion for photography developed 
alongside his father’s, who was an amateur 
photographer. When John was a sophomore 
in high school, his dad bought him his first 
camera and turned one of the rooms in their 
house into a darkroom. His father helped him 
develop his photography skills. 
After graduating from Fresno State Univer-
sity with a degree in journalism, John got his 
first newspaper job in 1980 at the Mesa Trib-
une in Arizona. In 1985, the Fresno Bee of-
fered John a position and he spent the next 
37 years as a photojournalist. 
John’s work is well respected and has re-
ceived acclaim. He’s won many awards, in-
cluding picture of the year from the National 
Photographers Press Association, Society of 
Newspaper Design, Best of the West, and 
California Newspaper Publishers Association. 
His work has appeared in newspapers across 
the United States and published in Time Mag-
azine, Newsweek, and Sports Illustrated. 
In his 42-year career in journalism, John 
had to evolve along with new technology. He 
started out shooting film and developing im-
ages in a darkroom, transitioned to digital 
photos and continued to adapt his storytelling 
abilities through in-depth video stories. 
John’s success in photojournalism comes 
from his deep understanding of people and 
the power of pictures to tell a story. He has 
the ability to communicate across language 
barriers, cultural and political differences. He 
cares about the people and places he photo-
graphs—it’s that empathetic approach that 
captured readers attention and brought our 
community to life. 
I invite everyone to celebrate John’s career 
with me. May his work continue to inspire fu-
ture journalists to tell meaningful stories and 
shed light on areas of improvement in society. 
His images preserve the history of the San 
Joaquin Valley and offer an empathic perspec-
tive that we should forever cherish. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the career of John Walker. 
May we continue to be inspired by work. His 
photographs are an outstanding source of 
pride for the Central Valley.

RECOGNIZING RED PARKA PUB’S 
50TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 21, 2022 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of the Red Parka Pub celebrating 50 
years of business in the Mount Washington 
Valley. This incredible milestone is a testa-
ment to the staff and ownership who have 
been serving up quality home cooked meals 
with a smile for half a century. Known for its 
live music acts, comfortable patio seating for 
hot New England summer days, and active in-
volvement in the community, it’s no wonder 
that the Red Parka Pub remains a popular 
destination for locals and tourists alike.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E1064 
October 21, 2022 
Dating back to the pub’s opening on No-
vember 3, 1972, the ownership realized that 
the Red Parka could serve as more than a 
family-style restaurant and took an active role 
in the community by promoting numerous 
causes and hosting fundraisers meant to give 
back to the state of New Hampshire. Today, 
that spirit of service lives on in the Red Parka 
Pub Challenge Cup, considered to be one of 
the longest continuously running dual giant 
slalom races in the country. This race has 
raised more than $250,000 for the Eastern 
Slope Ski Club over its history, including a 
whopping $21,000 last year. 
The management team have taken an ac-
tive leadership role in the hospitality industry 
as well, forming the Valley Originals as a coa-
lition of independently owned restaurants. This 
coalition annually contributes $335,000 to the 
community, and the management team here 
at Red Parka still serve in the leadership of 
the coalition to this day. 
Under the leadership of General Manager 
Terry O’Brien and co-owner Jean Melczarek, 
the Red Parka Pub has established itself as a 
mainstay in the town of Glen, and I would like 
to commend them both for their incredible 
dedication to this storied pub. On behalf of my 
constituents in New Hampshire’s First Con-
gressional District, I congratulate the Red 
Parka Pub on 50 years of service and wish 
them another successful 50 years.

RECOGNIZING WESTLANDS WATER 
DISTRICT 
HON. DAVID G. VALADAO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 21, 2022 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the achievements of the 
Westlands Water District on their 70th Anni-
versary. 
Located on the west side of Fresno and 
Kings Counties, the Westlands Water District 
is home to some of the most fertile and pro-
ductive farmland on the planet. On September 
8, 1952, per the request of farmers on the 
westside of the San Joaquin Valley, the Fres-
no County Board of Supervisors officially an-
nounced the creation of the Westlands Water 
District. Initially, the district encompassed ap-
proximately 400,000 acres of land. After merg-
ing with West Plains Water District in 1965 
and purchasing Broadview Water District in 
2007, the district reached its current size of 
approximately 615,000 acres. On average, the 
district and its farmers provide for over 35,000 
jobs and generate over $4.7 billion in eco-
nomic activity each year. 
One distinct aspect of the Westlands Water 
District is that it remains one of the only water 
districts in the world that distributes irrigation 
water exclusively through a highly efficient 
system of pressurized pipe. With approxi-
mately 1,100 miles of buried pipe throughout 
the district, they are able to track every drop 
of surface water delivered in the district—from 
the moment the water enters the system to 
the moment it reaches the field. Additionally, 
the district and its farmers have invested mil-
lions of dollars each year in its water infra-
structure system so the system can continue 
serving all of the district’s water users for fu-
ture generations. 
For seven decades, even while battling 
droughts, unpredictable climates, and chang-
ing 
regulations, 
the 
farmers 
within 
the 
Westlands Water District have been leaders in 
implementing cutting-edge water conservation 
technologies and efficient irrigation practices 
through their hard work, innovative tech-
nologies, and commitment to continuous im-
provements. The district and its farmers have 
been, and will continue to be, an essential part 
of developing a robust water infrastructure 
throughout the Central Valley. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
House of Representatives to join me in hon-
oring the achievements of the Westlands 
Water District on their 70th Anniversary.

TENNIAL ANNIVERSARY 
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 21, 2022 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor to rise today to commemorate the 100

versity-Kansas City has been recognized as a

professionals. Originally named Central Col-
lege of Chiropractic, the institution enrolled 
their first class of students in 1922 and cele-
brated the graduation of its first doctor of 
chiropractic in 1924. Founded by graduates of 
the world’s first school of chiropractic care, 
Palmer College of Chiropractic, Dr. C.S. 
Cleveland Sr., Dr. Ruth R. Cleveland, and Dr. 
Perl B. Griffin became one of the first estab-
lished families in chiropractic care in the Na-
tion. After two years of operation, Central Col-
lege of Chiropractic was renamed to Cleve-
land Chiropractic College, reflecting the influ-
ential contributions of the founding family. 
As enrollment at the institution began to 
grow, it remained centered on creating a tight- 
knit community amongst students, staff, and 
faculty to ensure there was an existing support 
system as students continued their academic 
and professional journeys. As a result of the 
institution expanding, Cleveland Chiropractic 
College acquired the Ratledge System of 
Chiropractic Schools located in Los Angeles in 
1951 and was renamed as Cleveland Chiro-
practic College of Los Angeles in 1955. With 
roots in Kansas City and Los Angeles, the col-
lege became known across the country, at-
tracting students from every corner of the Na-
tion. After Dr. C.S. Cleveland Sr.’s leadership 
was over, his son, Dr. C.S. Cleveland Jr. 
served as chancellor of both campuses and 
saw the establishment of a new bachelor’s de-
gree in human biology and a new program fo-
cused on pre-professional Health Science. 
Known as a worldwide chiropractic lecturer, 
Dr. C.S. Cleveland Jr. began the process of 
expanding the college’s degrees while keeping 
chiropractic care as the foundation of the insti-
tution. 
To provide students with more hands-on ex-
perience and access to advanced techno-
logical facilities, a newly developed facility was 
created in 2008 and by 2011, the Los Angeles 
campus consolidated operations with the Kan-
sas City campus. Under the leadership of 
fourth-generation chiropractor and grandson of 
the founders, Carl S. Cleveland III spear-
headed the transition to university status, 
changing the institution’s name to Cleveland 
University-Kansas City. Under the new name, 
the university was able to support the addition 
of multiple degrees such as new associates, 
bachelors and masters’ programs to enhance 
the opportunities available for students. 
As the university continues to evolve to 
meet changing needs in the health science 
fields, it remains invested in promoting health, 
wellness, and vitality, ultimately leading to bet-
ter healthcare for all. 
Madam Speaker, please join me and all of 
Missouri’s Fifth Congressional District in hon-
oring Cleveland University-Kansas City for 
their monumental achievement of 100 years of 
service and their indelible mark on commu-
nities across the Nation. I am certain that this 
institution will continue to support its students 
and instill in them a spirit of care as they fur-
ther develop their personal and professional 
skills and enter the healthcare field. Let us cel-
ebrate this milestone achievement and wish 
Cleveland University-Kansas City continued 
prosperity for the next 100 years to come.

REMEMBERING ERIC POMEROY 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 21, 2022 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and lasting contribu-
tions of Eric Michael Pomeroy. 
Passing away far too soon at the age of 54, 
Mr. Pomeroy leaves behind an indelible legacy 
in the education and wider community in Yuba 
City. 
Mr. Pomeroy was a lifetime resident of the 
Yuba-Sutter community who served his com-
munity with sincere devotion and joy. Mr. 
Pomeroy devoted 24 years of his life to edu-
cation including 10 years as a teacher for 
CTE, Academic, and Alternative Education, 
and 14 years as an educational administrator. 
As the Assistant Superintendent of Career and 
Adult Education for the Sutter County Super-
intendent of Schools, Mr. Pomeroy oversaw 
Sutter County One Stop, Tri-County ROP, Sut-
ter County Adult Education, and North Central 
Counties Consortium. Throughout his career, 
Mr. Pomeroy worked ceaselessly to create op-
portunities for students and provide a sup-
portive environment for educators. 
Mr. Pomeroy was a lifelong volunteer across 
the Yuba-Sutter community. He served as a 
board member of Yuba-Sutter-Colusa United 
Way and was a former member of the Rotary 
and Kiwanis Clubs. His passion for swimming 
led him to serve as not only the President and 
Head Coach of Sutter Buttes Swimming, but 
also a Special Olympics Swim Coach. Mr. 
Pomeroy also served as a CCA official for Si-
erra Nevada and officiated for the CCA swim

Pomeroy believed in finding the joy and humor 
in life—always searching to do what was right. 
Mr. Pomeroy is survived by his wife of 15 
years, Daniela, and two loving daughters, 
Erica and Gianna. His family and the Yuba- 
Sutter community will dearly miss his joyful 
and adventurous spirit. I would like to extend 
my deepest sympathies to Mr. Pomeroy’s 
loved ones. I know that they, along with the 
entire Yuba-Sutter community, join me in cele-
brating his life and legacy.

HONORING NATIONAL WHITE CANE 
SAFETY DAY 
HON. VERONICA ESCOBAR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 21, 2022 
Ms. ESCOBAR. Madam Speaker, I am hon-
ored to recognize October 15, 2022, as Na-
tional White Cane Safety Day. 
White Cane Safety Day is observed every 
year to celebrate the accomplishments of peo-
ple who are blind or visually impaired. The 
white cane carries special significance be-
cause it is a tool that helps visually impaired 
people be independent. To celebrate this year, 
the El Paso Council of the Blind is partnering 
with the El Paso Community College, Center 
for Students with Disabilities and Diversity and 
Inclusion Programs to host a community-wide 
event to bring awareness about issues that 
blind and visually impaired people have 
learned to conquer. 
The El Paso Council of the Blind has been 
active in our community for nearly ten years 
and has welcomed hundreds of members over 
that time. They provide essential programs like 
peer support for persons with vision loss and 
their families, Braille for Badges, sensitivity 
training for paratransit drivers, guide dog meet 
and greet sessions, and assistance to older in-
dividuals who are blind or visually impaired. 
They also fight to protect the right to voting 
privacy and accessibility, and they advocate 
for the expansion of much-needed training re-
sources in Texas and El Paso. 
I am grateful to the El Paso Council of the 
Blind and our community partners for gath-
ering on this day to raise our consciousness to 
the plight of the blind and visually impaired 
and for their tireless work to help those who 
carry a white cane lead their lives with inde-
pendence, dignity, and hope.

RECOGNIZING PASTOR RONALD K. 
BENSON 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 21, 2022 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, today, I want 
to recognize Pastor Ronald K. Benson of 
Greater Haven of Rest Church of God in 
Christ, in Michigan’s 13th District Strong, as 
he celebrates his fifty years of service in faith. 
Pastor Ronald K. Benson was born and 
raised in Detroit, Michigan. He is the eldest of 
ten siblings. Pastor Benson is the fourth gen-
eration of his family to be raised in the Church 
of God in Christ. He was called to the ministry 
as a young man and member of the Conner 
Avenue Church of God in Christ. Pastor Ben-
son’s mission has been to be a faithful servant 
of the Lord and the people of his flock. Pastor 
Benson has served over the years in many 
capacities; he is the Superintendent of the 
Progressive District, Northeast Michigan Juris-
diction, Executive Secretary and Liaison to the 
late Honorable Bishop P.A. Brooks, Northeast 
Michigan 
Jurisdiction, 
Finance 
Committee 
member and Trustee Board member and Sec-
retary. 
Pastor Benson possesses a true passion for 
community service. He has assisted and co-
ordinated numerous programs and events, in-
cluding an annual school supplies giveaway, 
winter coats for children in need program, and 
a community health screening fair. He also 
spearheaded the creation of a resource center 
for adults. The 13th Congressional District is 
grateful for Pastor Benson’s compassion and 
humble spirit by the many people he has 
helped on his journey. 
Please join me in celebrating Pastor Ronald 
K. Benson for fifty years of service to Greater 
Haven of Rest Church of God in Christ and 
the community of Detroit.

HONORING JEFFREY SIEGEL 
HON. JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 21, 2022 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to honor a cherished friend, Jeffrey Siegel. For 
over the past six decades, Jeffrey Siegel has 
graced concert halls around the globe as a 
solo pianist for the world’s greatest orchestras. 
As Jeffrey Siegel celebrates his 80th birthday, 
I wanted to join the huge chorus of grateful 
music lovers who continue today to be in-
spired and enthralled by his performances. 
Jeffrey grew up in Chicago’s Rogers Park 
neighborhood, as did I. He attended grammar 
school at Rogers School and graduated from 
Sullivan High School—as I did, just a couple 
of years behind him. With home-town pride, 
we watched Jeffrey advance in the world of 
classical music. I was more than a little im-
pressed when Marion Block, my neighborhood 
piano teacher, invited the young Jeffrey to our 
very modest recital at her home to expose us 
to the wonders of a truly talented young pian-
ist. I never forgot it. 
Jeffrey Siegel is a remarkable communicator 
as well as performer, bringing music to life in 
a unique way. For several decades, he has 
presented ‘‘Keyboard Conversations,’’ during 
which he gives the audience fascinating back-
ground about the composers, the world and 
times they lived in, and the important features 
of the composition that deserve special atten-
tion. Everyone from the newest to the most 
experienced listeners have a richer musical 
experience. 
Each ‘‘Keyboard Conversation’’ ends with a 
Q and A and a lively discussion with the audi-
ence. Jeffrey presents these well-attended 
programs on a regular basis throughout the 
country including at Northwestern University 
where my husband and I try to never miss a 
concert, and occasionally spend an evening 
talking politics and policy over dinner. 
Jeffrey Siegel is a remarkable human being 
and one of America’s most esteemed pianists. 
‘‘An achievement of the sort seldom heard.’’ 
The New York Times. 
Jeffrey Siegel has everything: massive tech-
nique, musical sensitivity and character-wide 
tonal resonance, immense reserve of power, 
and ability to communicate.’’ Los Angeles 
Times. 
I wish my dear friend a Happy Birthday.

6TH ANNIVERSARY OF FILVETREP 
HON. DAN NEWHOUSE 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 21, 2022 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the Filipino Veterans Rec-
ognition and Education Project’s 6th anniver-
sary and all their work to raise awareness and 
support for Filipino-American World War II sol-
diers. 
FilVetREP is a volunteer initiative with the 
mission to obtain national recognition for all 
Filipino-American World War II soldiers for 
their service in the Philippines from July 1941 
to December 1946. The initiative worked to 
successfully secure legislation that would 
award the Congressional Gold Medal to sol-
diers and survivors, which I proudly cospon-
sored and voted for during my first term in 
Congress. 
After nearly 75 years, Filipino-American sol-
diers who served finally received their much- 
deserved recognition with the passage of the 
Filipino Veterans of World War II Congres-
sional Gold Medal Act of 2015. 
FilVetREP has since conducted over 80 
ceremonies across the United States and in 
the Philippines to award veterans and their 
families the Congressional Gold Medal. 
From a grateful Nation, I thank all of the Fili-
pino-American soldiers for their service, and 
thank FilVetREP for their work to support and 
recognize our veterans. I extend my congratu-
lations on the Filipino Veterans Recognition 
and Education Project’s 6th anniversary and 
wish them many more decades of servant 
leadership.

CELEBRATING THE DAY OF 
RESTORATION 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 21, 2022 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize our ally, and a friend to our Na-
tion, Azerbaijan, on its Day of Restoration. 
This day recognizes the emancipation and lib-
eration of Azerbaijan from the authoritarian 
communist Soviet regime. The scourge of 
communism and leftist authoritarianism is not 
just something we face today, but people 
across Europe were subjected to this evil 
since the 1920’s. Azerbaijan was taken over 
by leftists aligned with the communist block 
leading to generations of misery and oppres-
sion. 
But all that changed. 
I wish nothing but peace and prosperity for 
the Azeris. There has been conflict between 
Azerbaijan and Armenia over borders and 
other issues. It is my fervent prayer that the

people in that region know peace and turn to 
God for guidance. There are many factors that 
lead to military action, and I will not pretend to 
know the circumstances of every conflict, but 
I do know that war must be a last resort, and 
nations must do everything in their power to 
minimize death and destruction. 
During these tense times of global uncer-
tainty, I hope and pray that peace will prevail. 
While not failing to admit that flaws are 
present in the decisions of every nation, I am 
happy that the United States has maintained a 
strong relationship with Azerbaijan. May both 
of our nations never experience the bondage 
of an evil, foreign, totalitarian power ever 
again.

HONORING TYLER SHIELS AS 
IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 21, 2022 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
ask the House of Representatives to join me 
in honoring Iowa State Trooper Tyler Shiels as 
our Iowan of the Week. 
Every day our law enforcement officers re-
spond to unclear situations that pose varying 
degrees of risk. These officers never know ex-
actly what will happen when they are pre-
sented with a situation. Whether it’s respond-
ing to a distress call or handling a traffic stop, 
officers must rely on their training and instincts 
to get a full sense of what each situation is 
presenting them. 
Back in December, then Cass County Dep-
uty Tyler Shiels had to do just that when he 
made a traffic stop that turned into a possible 
terror threat. After Deputy Shiels made the 
stop and started interviewing the driver by his 
vehicle, Deputy Shiels noticed something was 
off. This did not seem like the other routine 
stops he had to perform in the past. Upon fur-
ther inspection, Deputy Shiels discovered a 
firearm, ammunition, magazines, and a GPS 
with directions to the White House. Deputy 
Shiels was stunned, and even further sur-
prised when the driver was so transparent 
about what they were trying to accomplish. 
The driver was traveling from California to 
Washington, D.C. with plans to harm the 
President of the United States. However, once 
Deputy Shiels stopped him and found out 
what the driver was doing, he quickly got in 
contact with Federal authorities to notify them 
of what was happening in rural Iowa. 
On Tuesday, April 19th, now Iowa State 
Trooper Shiels, along with the Cass County 
Sheriff’s Department, were recognized by the 
United States Department of Homeland Secu-
rity at the Cass County Courthouse. Trooper 
Shiels was recognized for stopping a possible 
act of terror, and the Sheriff’s department was 
recognized for the outstanding training and re-
sources that they’ve provided their officers. 
I am incredibly grateful to have officers like 
Trooper Tyler Shiels serving the great State of 
Iowa and our Third Congressional District. It’s 
officers like him whose diligent work protects 
our communities and even the Nation as a 
whole. I am honored to name Trooper Tyler 
Shiels as this week’s Iowan of the Week, and 
I am thankful for his service to Iowa and our 
Nation. 
HONORING JOHN GALER 
HON. RODNEY DAVIS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 21, 2022 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my good 
friend John Galer. On October 8th, Mr. Galer 
was named the chairman of the National 
Newspaper Association. 
John owns The Journal-News and several 
other publications in Central Illinois. As the 
publisher of 10 newspapers in the area, John 
clearly has had a highly successful career and 
is a respected leader in the newspaper com-
munity. 
The Galer family came to The Journal in 
1945 when John’s grandfather, Del, took over 
production management duties. John’s father, 
Phillip Galer, purchased The Journal’s first off-
set press in 1968. He and John helped ex-
pand the business during the 1970s and 
1980s. In 2004, John and his wife, Susan, 
bought the Montgomery County News, also in 
Hillsboro, and merged that publication and 
staff into The Journal operation. The Journal- 
News, a 6,000-circulation, twice weekly, has 
been well received throughout the community 
and is a community advocate. 
John received the Illinois Press Association 
Distinguished Service Award in 2017. He also 
gives his time to numerous civic, foundation 
and charity organizations. Mr. Galer also is a 
member of Image Hillsboro, a nonprofit seek-
ing to revitalize the town through economic 
and community initiatives. 
I have no doubt John will continue to thrive 
in his new leadership position as the chairman 
of the National Newspaper Association, and I 
wish nothing but the best for my friend. The 
National Newspaper Association is in good 
hands under John’s new leadership.

HONORING EDNA LEWIS 
HON. ABIGAIL DAVIS SPANBERGER 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 21, 2022 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of a distin-
guished Virginian, Ms. Edna Lewis. 
Edna was born in Freetown, Orange Coun-
ty, Virginia in 1916. As a child growing up in 
a small farming community of emancipated 
slaves, Edna learned how to grow and cul-
tivate food on her grandfather’s farm. Drawing 
upon the heritage and culture of her African- 
American ancestors, Edna developed her dis-
tinct style of traditional Southern cooking. 
At the age of sixteen, Edna left Freetown 
and eventually settled in New York City. Work-
ing as a seamstress and dressmaker, it wasn’t 
until 1949 that she began cooking profes-
sionally as the head chef at Cafe´ Nicholson, a 
new restaurant in Manhattan. The restaurant 
and Edna’s unique style of Southern cooking 
quickly gained a dedicated following—includ-
ing prominent individuals ranging from Eleanor 
Roosevelt to Truman Capote. 
Even after Edna eventually left Cafe´ Nichol-
son, demand for her cooking and culinary ex-
pertise did not diminish. She published her 
first cookbook in 1972, followed shortly after 
by The Taste of Country Cooking in 1976. The 
Taste of Country Cooking, her seminal work, 
combines recipes and stories from her child-
hood in Freetown. Edna’s ability to impart her 
voice and heritage in the cookbook made it 
loved and adored by many. 
Edna published two more cookbooks over 
the course of her life. She was the recipient of 
numerous accolades, including the James 
Beard Living Legend Award and International 
Association of Culinary Professionals Lifetime 
Achievement Award, among many others. In 
2014, she was honored by the creation of a 
U.S. postal stamp with her image. 
Now, in honor of Edna’s life and achieve-
ments, the Orange County community will be 
installing a historical marker so that visitors 
can learn more about her and her contribu-
tions to our Commonwealth and our Nation. 
As the U.S. Representative for Virginia’s Sev-
enth District, I thank Orange County for cre-
ating an enduring memory of Edna so that fu-
ture generations can remember one of the 
great champions of Southern cuisine.

CELEBRATING THE 40TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE NATIONAL MU-
SEUM 
OF 
TOYS 
AND 
MINIA-
TURES 
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 21, 2022 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today with an abundant sense of joy to recog-
nize the 40th anniversary of the National Mu-
seum of Toys and Miniatures, located in Kan-
sas City, Missouri. Home to the world’s largest 
collection of fine-scale miniatures and one of 
the most extensive collections of historic toys 
currently on public display, the museum has 
educated, inspired, and delighted adults and 
children alike since its opening in 1982. 
Founded by close friends Mary Harris Francis 
and Barbara Hall Marshall, the National Mu-
seum of Toys and Miniatures stands out as 
one of the most treasured institutions in Mis-
souri’s Fifth Congressional District. 
Born less than four years apart, Mary Harris 
Francis and Barbara Hall Marshall not only es-
tablished the Toy and Miniature Museum of 
Kansas City, as it was known until the sum-
mer of 2015, but also provided the cherished 
collections that went on display. Barbara—one 
of three children of Hallmark founder J.C. Hall 
and his wife, Elizabeth—developed an appre-
ciation for art at an early age, when she 
helped her dad review card designs. Having 
always looked forward to receiving the small-
est presents from her father, Barbara acquired 
her first fine-scale miniature in the 1950s—a 
rocking chair that could fit in the palm of her 
hand. Drawn to the artistic efforts required to 
create fine-scale miniatures, Barbara became 
a serious collector by the 1970s. With her eye 
for detail refined through her professional ca-
reer in the art department at Hallmark, along 
with her volunteer service at the Nelson-Atkins 
Museum of Art, Barbara only collected minia-
tures of the highest quality, and frequently 
commissioned works from artists who could 
meet her standards. Setting aside her per-
sonal stylistic preferences, Barbara encour-
aged artists to create the works of their 
dreams, and in doing so, the boundaries of

fine-scale miniatures as an art form were ex-
plored and redefined through her patronage. 
Mary Harris Guinotte Francis, whose lineage 
included the Guinotte family that helped found 
Kansas City, taught elementary school at 
Notre Dame de Sion and never lost the con-
nection she felt to her own childhood. Guided 
by her sense of playfulness and her love for 
the make believe, Mary developed a passion 
for collecting dolls, dollhouses, toys, and 
games of many time periods. Most interested 
in objects that had been handmade and well- 
loved, Mary acquired her first antique doll-
house in 1974. Assuring her husband she 
would ‘‘never need another,’’ Mary’s ever-ex-
panding collection of large, antique dollhouses 
soon began occupying a significant portion of 
her family’s home as she continued to put her 
curatorial acumen to use. Mary’s sense of joy 
in life was evident in her collection, but it be-
came apparent that a larger space was need-
ed to house the treasure trove of toys and 
miniatures that she and Barbara had acquired 
in their respective homes. When the two 
women returned from a trip and showed 
Mary’s mother what they had purchased along 
the way, Mary’s mother stated that ‘‘if you girls 
get one more thing, you’re going to have to 
start a museum.’’ This remark, having planted 
an idea in the minds of Barbara and Mary, 
would prove prophetic. 
Opening its doors in 1982, the Toy and Min-
iature Museum of Kansas City was first lo-
cated in the historic Tureman Mansion at the 
corner of 52nd and Oak on the University of 
Missouri-Kansas City campus. At this time, the 
7,500-square-foot museum employed only two 
full-time staff members. Expansions in 1989 
and 2004 saw the museum grow to 33,000- 
square-feet, and by 2012, the museum’s col-
lection included 72,000 objects. Embarking on 
their first public capital campaign in 2012 to 
support building and exhibit improvements, the 
museum raised nearly $11 million and began 
a nineteen-month renovation in 2014. Reopen-
ing on August 1, 2015 as the National Mu-
seum of Toys and Miniatures, the collection 
currently numbers more than 86,000 objects. 
In 2016 and again in 2018, the museum re-
ceived Leadership in History Merit Awards 
from the American Association of State and 
Local History, testaments to the institution’s 
educational significance. 
The museum’s fine-scale miniatures include 
architectural works, room settings, fine and 
decorative art, tools, equipment, and figures 
made to scale, most commonly 1:12. Crafted 
by master artists, the miniatures collection in-
cludes working reproductions of objects in the 
full-scale world, highlighting the ingenuity and 
skill that miniature artists employ to create 
their intricately detailed works. Without step-
ping foot outside Kansas City, the miniatures 
collection allows visitors to see Louis XV’s 
study at the Palace of Versailles, an Italian 
Renaissance studio, and a Boston Beacon Hill 
mansion. 
The museum’s toy collection, the largest of 
its kind in the midwestern United States, docu-
ments society’s cultural beliefs, technological 
advancements, and the hopes and dreams of 
generations of children from the 18th century 
to the present. The collection examines the 
role that toys play in providing comfort and 
teaching skills, while stories collected and told 
through children’s points of view encourage 
visitors to think about the meaning of their 
own toys, thereby fueling conversations about 
childhood and the importance of memories. In-
deed, toys represent touchstones to our ear-
liest and most personal memories, containing 
important historical and cultural clues about 
the past. 
It is often said that the National Museum of 
Toys and Miniatures offers something for ev-
eryone, and it is a place where art meets his-
tory. Barbara Hall Marshall once explained 
that ‘‘the most enjoyment you can get from a 
collection that you put together is to share it 
with other people.’’ For forty years, the mu-
seum has welcomed visitors from around the 
world and shared with them the precious col-
lections that Barbara and Mary Harris Francis 
first assembled. Luckily for those visitors, they 
all left a little younger. Madam Speaker, 
please join me in congratulating the National 
Museum of Toys and Miniatures on forty 
years. Here’s to many more.

intern for the Jamaican consulate, the Bureau 
of Oceans International, Environmental and 
Scientific Affairs at the U.S. Department of 
State. Michelle later volunteered with Syrian 
refugees for a nongovernmental organization

hundreds of Afghans for evacuation. During 
the course of these efforts, Michelle’s brother, 
who was stationed in COP Charkh in Logar 
Province, mentioned that his interpreter had 
contacted him for help evacuating from Af-
ghanistan. Michelle helped prepare his evacu-
ation applications and compiled all the nec-
essary components of his visa for the Depart-
ment of State vetting. This interpreter had 
been wounded in combat by the Taliban while 
supporting Michelle’s brother in their duties 
and has successfully been relocated out of Af-
ghanistan, in addition to his wife and 9 chil-
dren. These people will now have a safe fu-

lives and aided countless others. 
It is because of the leadership displayed by 
Ms. Ball that I am especially proud to serve Il-

RECOGNIZING 
UNIVERSITY 
OF 
CALIFORNIA, DAVIS REPORT ON 
DROUGHT 
RAVAGING 
CALIFOR-
NIA’S SACRAMENTO VALLEY 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 21, 2022 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the work by the University 
of California, Davis to quantify the ongoing, 
unprecedented drought’s devastating impacts 
on the Sacramento Valley economy. This rav-
aging drought has left hundreds of thousands 
of acres of Sacramento Valley farmland 
unplanted this year, causing dramatic harm to 
people, fish, waterfowl, shorebirds, and other 
wildlife. 
On August 29, 2022, researchers at UC 
Davis in my Congressional district published a 
report entitled ‘‘Continued Drought in 2022 
Ravages California’s Sacramento Valley Econ-
omy.’’ I encourage all Members of Congress 
to review this important study and work with 
me to help mitigate this historic drought im-
pacting the Sacramento Valley, other parts of 
California, and the American West. The report 
reads as follows: 
Drought in 2022 is severe by any measure. 
The 2020 and 2021 water years left California, 
and especially California agriculture, dam-
aged and vulnerable (Sumner et al. 2021, 
Medellı´n-Azuara, et al. 2022). After a prom-
ising start, the record failure of precipita-
tion in January and February left the state 
with such a deficit that despite some snow 
and rain in March and April, levels of water 
tables, snowpacks, and reservoirs have left 
the available irrigation water supply in a 
perilous condition. The water situation for 
Sacramento Valley agriculture is as bad as it 
has ever been. The depth of this drought was 
reflected in repeated dismal announcements 
during the spring of huge reductions in pro-
jected irrigation availability. 
In this report, we assess the likely eco-
nomic impacts of drought for farms and 
ranches on the Sacramento Valley in 2022. 
First, we briefly describe the economics of 
Sacramento 
Valley 
agriculture 
in 
2019, 
which, while still drought impacted, was rel-
atively ‘‘normal’’ in the water situation and 
in the broader economic situation. We used 
data from Sacramento Valley county agri-
cultural commissioners’ reports for values of 
farm output and the IMPLAN data set on 
linkages across sectors of the economy to ex-
tend implications of farm economics of the 
2022 drought to the broader Sacramento Val-
ley economy. The Sacramento Valley, which 
here is taken to include Butte, Colusa, 
Glenn, Placer, Sacramento, Sutter, Tehama, 
Yolo, and Yuba Counties, has a large, di-
verse, and vibrant agricultural economy. 
Farms and ranches rely on precipitation 
within the Valley as well as the surrounding 
hills and mountains for production of crops 
and livestock. 
Several key assumptions and limitations 
of any projections of economic effects of the 
current drought must be listed at the outset. 
These are important to interpret our results. 
First, irrigation water availability for the 
rest of the growing season and water year 
has been mostly determined; however, the 
growing conditions that affect crop yields 
and crop production as well as the market 
conditions that affect farm costs and reve-
nues are yet to play out. That means, while 
we can project the economic impacts of this 
drought relative to a baseline, we cannot 
speak with great confidence about, for exam-
ple, crop yields or market prices for the farm

commodities currently growing or yet to be 
planted in the Sacramento Valley. Agricul-
tural outcomes remain uncertain until final 
crops and livestock products are sold. 
Second, because our main source of data on 
economic linkages across sectors of the 
economy is the IMPLAN data base, we for-
mally delineate upstream connections from 
farms to purchased inputs used on farms. 
This limits the scope of the modeled impacts 
of drought and leaves out some important 
implications. When farm production falls in 
a region, there also will be less economic ac-
tivity downstream a step or two from the 
farm and IMPLAN modeling based on farm- 
level data does not capture that. For exam-
ple, Sacramento Valley peaches or tomatoes 
that are not produced cannot be processed or 
shipped. However, there is no comprehensive 
data to consider implications of farm pro-
duction shortfalls for food processing and 
similar industries. A dearth of detailed data 
on economic linkages for many specific agri-
cultural industries in the Sacramento Valley 
limits our ability to assess downstream im-
pacts quantitatively for each industry. To 
partially remedy this limitation, we use the 
data that is available for rice and rice mill-
ing and processing, and extend those results 
(on a proportional basis) where appropriate 
to the rest of agriculture in the Sacramento 
Valley. 
Third, the simulations that underlie our 
projected impacts are based on illustrative 
judgements 
about 
how 
much 
the 
2022 
drought is likely to cut crop and livestock 
output. As discussed more below, we assume, 
based on historical data, recent news about 
water cutbacks, and other assessments, the 
most probable output reductions relative to 
a normal water year. These current judge-
ments are subject to revision as new infor-
mation becomes available. 
For the simulations in this report, we at-
tribute the following output impacts to the 
2022 drought relative to the 2019 base: Rice: 
¥50%; Fruits and tree nuts: ¥10%; Vegeta-
bles, other grains, and all other crops: ¥20%; 
and Livestock and livestock products, in-
cluding apiary services: ¥10%. Of course, 
some farms will have much larger cuts than 
others, and some specific commodities with-
in a category will face larger water cuts 
leading to increased output reduction. Our 
results are roughly proportional meaning, as 
data allows better projected output impacts, 
the economic impacts can be readily ad-
justed. The drought in 2022 is likely to re-
duce direct farm and ranch value of output 
in the Sacramento Valley by about $950 mil-
lion, or more than 20%, in aggregate. These 
losses will cost the Sacramento Valley about 
5,000 on-farm jobs and reduce the value added 
generated from farming and ranching by 
about $560 million. The impact of these farm 
losses and their upstream impacts to the 
Sacramento Valley economy are a loss of 
more than 9,000 jobs and almost $1 billion in 
economic value added. A fuller accounting, 
however, takes account of the impact of lost 
farm production on farm processing, mar-
keting, transport, and related downstream 
implications. We do not have data for de-
tailed calculations of these implications. 
However, using data from rice farm produc-
tion and rice milling as a guide, we have 
made the best assessment available. We 
project that the 2022 drought impacts on 
farm production are likely to cause a loss of 
about 14,300 jobs and about $1.315 billion in 
economic value added in the Sacramento 
Valley. 
In 2019, the region produced about $4.83 bil-
lion of direct farm revenue. Table 1 lists ag-
ricultural value of output by commodity cat-
egory for the Sacramento Valley based on 
data from County Agricultural Commis-
sioners. Tree nuts, primarily almonds and 
walnuts, are the leading category of farm 
commodities, having recently grown to more 
than one-third of the value of output. Grains 
account for almost one-quarter of output; 
rice accounting for more than 80% of grains 
or almost 20% of the value of Sacramento 
Valley farm output. Other grains include 
corn, wheat, and grain seed crops. Fruits, es-
pecially wine grapes, olives, prunes, peaches, 
and other tree fruits, are important as are 
vegetables, led by processing tomatoes. 
Other crops include hay, pasture, and a vari-
ety of seed crops. Livestock include beef cat-
tle, a few dairies, some poultry, and eggs 
and, importantly, products and pollination 
services from the apiary industry. 
Table 1 also includes direct farm and ranch 
jobs, which totaled about 34,000 in 2019, and 
the upstream jobs tied to farm and ranch 
output through indirect and induced effects. 
Indirect jobs are those tied to farm produc-
tion because they are employed in industries 
that supply farm inputs and services and the 
jobs for input purchases that ripple out from 
there. These jobs include such services as 
farm equipment repair, veterinary services, 
or crop consultants. They also include jobs 
in industries that supply farm inputs such as 
feed processing, fertilizers, or farm equip-
ment. Induced jobs are those caused by ex-
penditures by proprietors and employees in-
cluded in the direct and indirect impacts. So, 
for example, induced employment includes 
that generated by expenditures of farm oper-
ators and employees and the local businesses 
and employees from whom farms and ranches 
buy inputs. 
As noted above, the standard approach to 
estimating 
economywide 
impacts 
using 
multimarket relationships is to only con-
sider impacts from upstream linkages in 
order to avoid double counting and related 
errors. For example, local supermarket jobs 
are not linked to farm output within the 
local region, even though supermarkets cer-
tainly sell some products derived from local 
farms. This is appropriate because people 
buy the same amount of food whether it is 
grown locally or not, and most food con-
sumers live farm from where their food is 
grown. 
However, in important cases, upstream 
economic activity and jobs really are tied di-
rectly to local farm production. That is espe-
cially true for the shipping and processing of 
bulk farm commodities. For example, rice 
grown in the Sacramento Valley tends to be 
dried and milled in the Sacramento Valley. 
Likewise, tomatoes are almost always proc-
essed near where they are grown. These facts 
mean that, just as with the impact of rice 
production on rice milling and shipping jobs, 
Sacramento Valley tomato processing jobs 
fall when Valley tomato acreage and produc-
tion declines. Below, when we assess Sac-
ramento Valley economywide impacts, we 
include some downstream economic activity 
when we are confident that it is tied closely 
to local farm production quantities. 
Using 2019 as the recent base for a ‘‘nor-
mal’’ year, we apply our drought induced 
projected losses to the 2019 data to simulate 
2022 drought impacts. Our assessments of the 
likely direct impact of the 2022 drought on 
output are based on past drought con-
sequences and the cost to farms of making 
acreage and yield adjustments (Sumner et al. 
2021a, band Medellı´n-Azuara 2022). The tree 
and vine crops tend to have the smallest 
acreage or yield adjustments of any crops, as 
farms typically try to avoid permanent ad-
justments to what may be a temporary 
water shortage. Additionally, tree and vine 
crop operators tend to be willing to pay 
extra to pump groundwater or to transfer 
water from annual crops. We project a 10% 
cut in tree and vine crop output to reflect 
additional culling of older vineyards and or-
chards as well as some yield reduction that 
follows 
from 
reduced 
water 
application 
rates. 
Annual crop cutbacks for grains, oilseeds, 
hay and silage, vegetables and other crops 
are much larger than we expect for tree and 
vine crops, but still less severe than the re-
duction for rice. Higher prices for vegetables 
and harvested forage crops will offset some 
of the revenue declines caused by reduced 
acreage and yields. Historically, fallowing 
rates are moderate for these crops; even in 
the San Joaquin Valley where drought cuts 
usually have been more severe. The USDA 
Prospective Planting report, released on 
March 31, 2022, indicated only slight reduc-
tions in intentions to plant wheat, feed 
grains, and hay in California relative to 2020 
(NASS, USDA). Rice was the exception to 
moderate intensions to reduce acreage plant-
ed. California rice growers indicated a 30% 
planned reduction in acreage. 
Based on the June 30 USDA acreage plant-
ed report and local report from the industry 
and water district personnel, our judgment is 
that rice acreage will be down by about 50%. 
The water situation turned out to be even 
worse than growers expected during the sur-
vey period of mid-March. Also, most rice 
acreage is eligible for indemnities from pre-
vented planting provisions in crop insurance 
policies when severe irrigation water cut-
backs imply there will not be enough water 
to support the crop. Therefore, some of the 
loss to growers will be mitigated. Moreover, 
if rice acreage is left unplanted, some water 
that would have otherwise been used for rice 
can be transferred to other crops on the 
same farm, on nearby farms or to farms out-
side the Sacramento Valley. 
Finally, we estimate that livestock output 
will decline by 10%. The drought affects irri-
gation for pasture and forage crops as well as 
the feed value of rainfed pastures. In addi-
tion, honeybees represent a significant live-
stock industry in the Sacramento Valley. 
The revenue from pollination services has 
been already earned. Honey yields are lower 
in drought years because bees have less for-
age, which contributes to our projected live-
stock losses. Only small reductions due to 
drought are expected for the (relatively 
small) Sacramento Valley dairy and egg in-
dustries. 
Table 2 shows the results of applying these 
assumptions to the 2019 farm and ranch rev-
enue data. The bottom line is that direct 
farm output is likely to be lower by about 
$950 million or about 20% from 2019. The pro-
jected direct revenue loss is larger because 
farms and ranches will make many adjust-
ments and incur higher costs to keep produc-
tion losses to a minimum. Notice that more 
than half the overall loss of direct farm 
value of output is for grains, most of which 
is due to rice acreage left unplanted. 
The output losses discussed in Section 3 
translate into on-farm job losses. The job 
losses are roughly proportional to output re-
ductions within an industry. However, some 
parts of agriculture are more labor intensive 
than others, so they have larger influence on 
overall farm labor use. For example, fruit 
farming is much more labor intensive per 
dollar of revenue than is grain farming. The 
first column of Table 3 shows the 2019 farm 
and ranch jobs in the Sacramento Valley for 
each industry sector and for the total, which 
is taken directly from Table 1. We note that 
other crops are labor intensive because many 
of the farms are small, part time family is 
included in the totals. 
The projected farm and ranch agricultural 
jobs in 2022 are listed in the second column 
of Table 3. For example, we project 14,313 
jobs in the tree nut industry and a total of 
28,780 farm and ranch jobs. These are lower 
than the jobs in 2019 because of the impact of

drought. The losses in direct farm and ranch 
jobs are shown in the third column. We 
project a direct loss of more than 5,000 jobs 
on farms and ranches in the Sacramento Val-
ley due to the 2022 drought. Of course, the 
losses to the broad economy from drought in 
agriculture go much deeper than the direct 
losses 
of 
jobs. 
Table 
4 
summarizes 
economywide losses in the Sacramento Val-
ley caused by drought in agriculture for 
value of output, employment, labor income 
and value added. (Value added is the measure 
of economic activity that removes any dou-
ble counting across industry segments and is 
used for economic aggregates such as na-
tional, state, and regional GDP). 
The first row of Table 4 shows the direct 
agricultural losses and the losses for value of 
output and employment that are familiar 
from Tables 2 and 3. Labor income in column 
2 shows earnings from jobs, including earn-
ings of the proprietors such as farm owners 
and operators. As expected, many of these 
agricultural jobs are seasonal and many 
farms are operated part time, so the annual 
earnings are well below what full-time, year- 
around employees of full-time business oper-
ators would earn. The ‘‘value added’’ column 
represents the wages paid to hired workers 
and income attributed to proprietors. An-
other way to think of value added is the rev-
enue of the industry minus the value of 
goods and services purchased directly from 
other industries. Value added for the econ-
omy as a whole is economic output being 
careful to remove any potential double 
counting. For example, output of the dairy 
industry includes the value of the grain, hay 
and other feeds that are turned into milk by 
the dairy cows and sold by the farm. Value 
added of the dairy industry nets out the 
value of all inputs purchased by the dairy 
farming industry, including purchased feed 
and nutrition consultant services, and oth-
ers. The sum across industries of all the di-
rect losses of agricultural output due to 
drought in 2022 is $954 million, whereas loss 
of value added is $572 million, which may be 
thought of as loss income earned by hired 
workers and farm operators (farms and 
ranches) within the agricultural industry. 
The second row of Table 4 includes losses 
to upstream suppliers to Sacramento Valley 
agriculture. Industries that supply goods and 
services to farm and ranch operations lose 
sales and profits and their workers lose jobs 
when farm output falls due to drought. Such 
businesses include local repair shops, fer-
tilizer firms, insurance companies or law of-
fices that work with farms and ranches. 
These indirect effects reflect losses of output 
jobs, labor income and value added of Sac-
ramento Valley businesses that rely on farm 
and ranch customers. The third row of Table 
4 includes induced losses. These reflect lost 
output, jobs and income in all sectors af-
fected by lost agricultural incomes (mostly 
reduced incomes of labor and those contrib-
uting labor, management, and capital). This 
includes the reductions in goods and services 
that farmer and farm worker families buy in 
the Sacramento Valley. The ripple effects of 
such purchases include everything from hair-
cuts to autos and schooling. 
The direct and upstream losses for the Sac-
ramento Valley economy, shown in row 4 of 
Table 4, are the sum of the direct, indirect, 
and induced effects. One must be careful in-
terpreting the sum of the direct and indirect 
output rows. The direct output includes the 
value of inputs used in production; therefore 
it incorporates the indirect output and to 
simply add them up would be double count-
ing. For example, the output of almonds in-
cludes the contribution of the honeybees (in-
cluded in livestock income) that pollinated 
the crop. Thus, in evaluating the overall con-
tribution 
of 
agriculture 
and 
the 
economywide impact of the drought we focus 
on value added in the fourth column. We 
note that Table 4 contains only the farm and 
the upstream economywide losses due to 
drought. Upstream economywide losses due 
to specific agricultural industries are in an 
appendix available from the authors. 
In this section, we emphasized the results 
in Table 4 are upstream impacts. This means 
that the reduced economic activity in trans-
port and processing of farm commodities is 
not included in the impacts. We do not have 
data to estimate such impacts for agri-
culture broadly. For some products; the 
downstream economic activity within the 
Sacramento Valley may be relatively small. 
For example, many calves raised and sold in 
the 
Sacramento 
Valley 
are 
shipped 
to 
feedlots in the Midwest and slaughtered and 
processed outside the Sacramento Valley. 
However, for other important products such 
as tree nuts, processed fruits and vegetables, 
there is substantial value added in the Sac-
ramento Valley and jobs in downstream in-
dustries depend on Sacramento Valley farm 
production. 
Fortunately, we do have data within the 
IMPLAN system on rice milling, which is an 
important downstream agricultural proc-
essing industry that relies on farm produc-
tion of rice in the Sacramento Valley. The 
next section shows how considering rice 
milling indicated a larger economywide eco-
nomic impact of the 2022 drought. Above, 
rice farm value of output was combined with 
other grains, which is how rice farming is re-
ported within the IMPLAN data sets. The 
Agricultural Commissioners data show that 
the value of farm rice production in 2019 was 
almost $0.95 billion based on about 500,000 
acres of rice. These totals, as expected, differ 
slightly from the aggregate statewide data 
from the USDA, National Agricultural Sta-
tistics Service. 
The top half of Table 5 uses rice farm rev-
enue data, together with linkage multipliers 
from the IMPLAN data set that are applica-
ble to the ‘‘grains’’ category, to assess up-
stream economywide contributions of Sac-
ramento Valley rice in 2019. Notice the re-
sults reported in the top half of Table 5 data 
equal 80%, or more, of the magnitude of the 
impacts for grains as a whole in 2019. Total 
direct sales, jobs, labor income and value 
added are all only slightly lower than for all 
grains in 2019. 
The bottom four rows of Table 5 represent 
the economic output and other aggregates 
for rice milling as an industry. Because these 
results are for rice milling, the main up-
stream input (indirect output) is rice grown 
on farms. The direct output is milled rice, 
which has a price and output value almost 
double that of farm rice output. The output 
of farm rice is the main contributor to the 
indirect output of $1,282 million for rice mill-
ing. Because of this, economywide impacts 
on rice milling are built directly on the base 
of rice farm output; therefore, anything that 
reduces rice farm output necessarily reduces 
rice milling output in the Sacramento Val-
ley. The economywide impacts of drought on 
rice milling subsume the effects of rice pro-
duction and capture much of the downstream 
impact. 
Table 6 shows the projected effects of the 
2022 drought, which, based on currently 
available information, we assume cuts rice 
production by 50% and reduces economic 
contribution of rice production and milling 
by 50%. The bottom panel shows that the re-
duction in rice output caused by the drought 
reduces Sacramento Valley employment by 
5,293 jobs: including jobs in rice farming and 
milling as well as the other indirect and in-
duced losses. The important effects on Sac-
ramento Valley income are the loss of labor 
income of $398 million and reduced value 
added in the Sacramento Valley of $703 mil-
lion. The loss of value added is 36% larger 
($703 million/$514 million) than the impact of 
rice farming without capturing the first step 
downstream. The employment impact of rice 
milling is 52% higher than of rice farming. 
These results for rice milling show the im-
portance of capturing downstream economic 
activity when it is reliant on local farm pro-
duction. Unfortunately, we do not have 
enough data to fully evaluate the contribu-
tions of other processing activities in the 
Sacramento Valley for crops such as tree 
nuts, fruits, and processing vegetables. None-
theless, we expect the impacts for these in-
dustries may be similar to those of rice. In 
the final remarks we make the appropriate 
adjustments to the results of Table 4 to take 
into account the first step of downstream 
impacts. 
Table 4 showed projected losses from the 
2022 drought for the Sacramento Valley, in-
cluding direct and upstream indirect and in-
duced impacts, are: employment loss of 9,396 
jobs, labor income loss of $504 million, and 
economic value-added loss of $967 million. 
Using the more detailed results for rice pre-
sented in Table 6, however, we show that 
these upstream results do not capture the 
true extent of the economic implications and 
are likely too small by between one third 
and one half. When we adjust the employ-
ment and value-added results to account for 
downstream processing, using the rice re-
sults as a guide, we find substantially larger 
impacts. 
Our best estimates are that the farm im-
pacts of the 2022 drought are likely to cause 
economic losses of about 14,300 jobs and loss 
of value added of about $1.315 billion.

IN HONOR OF FILIPINO AMERICAN 
HISTORY MONTH 
HON. JOSH HARDER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 21, 2022 
Mr. HARDER of California. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate Filipino American His-
tory Month. Across the United States, Filipino 
Americans have played a crucial role in this 
country’s success and have built a remarkable 
legacy that deserves to be recognized and 
celebrated. 
In our community especially, Filipino Ameri-
cans have a rich and storied history. In the 
early 1900s, thousands of Filipinos immigrated 
to the United States, with many settling in and 
around Stockton, California. In fact, according 
to 1930s census data, over half of all Filipinos 
in the United States were in San Joaquin 
County. From this large population grew Little 
Manila, a Filipino neighborhood in Stockton 
that served as a home for the newly formed 
immigrant community. Little Manila was a safe 
harbor from discrimination and became a 
place for Filipino culture and families to thrive. 
While only a small portion of Little Manila re-
mains, its impact can still be felt throughout 
Stockton all these years later. 
Today, Filipino Americans have built on the 
legacy started by their parents and grand-
parents and continue to enrich our nation. In 
San Joaquin County, we have a strong and vi-
brant Filipino American community of nearly 
30,000. They work in every industry, serve our 
community in numerous ways, and have 
brought immense value to the Central Valley. 
The history of Filipino Americans is preserved

and rightfully applauded thanks to the hard 
work of advocacy groups like the Filipino 
American National Historical Society, which 
chose Stockton as the location for the organi-
zation’s museum. 
In countless ways, the history of Filipino 
Americans embodies the ideals of the Amer-
ican Spirit: hard work, dedication, resiliency, 
and a firm belief that better days lie ahead. 
Filipino Americans are an integral part of our 
area and have played an irreplaceable role in 
the larger American story. I am incredibly 
proud to celebrate October as Filipino Amer-
ican History Month and eagerly anticipate the 
role that Filipino Americans will play in our

HONORING MR. FRANK SCARFO OF 
THE CITY OF TORRANCE 
HON. MAXINE WATERS 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 21, 2022 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Mr. Frank Scarfo, a 94-year-old U.S. 
Army veteran in my Congressional District 
who has quite an interesting history. Mr. 
Scarfo served our country as a counterintel-
ligence officer based in Italy during the Korean 
War. In a little-known Army operation, Mr. 
Scarfo helped identify and report communist 
party operatives who were attempting to infil-
trate the Army’s leadership by working as sup-
port staff in Italy. 
Born and raised in a small coal-mining town 
called Norton in West Virginia, Mr. Scarfo was 
brought up speaking only Italian in his parent’s 
household until the age of eight. After grad-
uating from college, he registered for the draft 
in December 1950 and after making the Army 
aware of his fluency in Italian was sent to Fort 
Holabird, Maryland, home of the Army’s Intel-
ligence School from 1945 to 1972, where he 
was trained as a counter-intelligence officer. 
Assigned to the 7617 Military Post in 
Livorno, Italy, Mr. Scarfo served his country 
for two years supporting the 4th Logistical 
Command, uncovering potentially dangerous 
enemy operatives who were working for the 
U.S. Army in Livorno, Pizza, and Florence, 
Italy. The cover name for the operation was 
the ‘‘Labor Control Detachment’’ and it re-
mains somewhat secretive to this day. Mr. 
Scarfo went on to serve for an additional four 
years in the Army Reserve, rising to the rank 
of sergeant. 
Proud of his contributions to the American 
occupation of Europe in the early 1950s, Mr. 
Scarfo would have continued his service in the 
Army if he didn’t need to return home to West 
Virginia to take care of his ailing parents. He 
later moved to California and worked with 
space pioneer Wernher von Braun’s operation 
at the Aerospace Corporation, which led to the 
successful moon landings in the late 1960s 
and early 1970s. 
In honor of Frank Scarfo’s participation in 
this little-known military operation in the Euro-
pean theater, I am pleased to bring to light his 
service to our country and thank him for a job 
well done. 
RECOGNIZING MR. ART CHIANELLO 
HON. DAVID G. VALADAO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 21, 2022 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Mr. Art Chianello for his 20 
years of service to the City of Bakersfield and 
congratulate him on his retirement. 
Mr. Chianello started his career in the city of 
Bakersfield working as an Engineer in the De-
sign Division of the Public Works Department. 
He quickly rose the ranks to become the Man-
ager of the Bakersfield Water Resources De-
partment. In this position, Mr. Chianello 
oversaw the River and Agricultural Water and 
Domestic Water divisions. His duties included 
administrating 
the 
regulation, 
distribution, 
water banking, and recordkeeping operations 
on the Kern River, as well as monitoring the 
city’s domestic water system. Mr. Chianello’s 
work ensured that over 143,000 residents and 
local businesses in Bakersfield had access to 
clean drinking water. 
One of Mr. Chianello’s proudest professional 
accomplishments occurred during his work as 
a wastewater manager in the Bakersfield Pub-
lic Works Department. There, he played an in-
strumental role in the predesign, design, and 
construction of a project that aimed to double 
the treatment plant capacity of the city’s 
wastewater plant. Mr. Chianello’s dedication 
and hard work allowed the department to com-
plete the project on-time and on-budget. This 
passion to serve his community honorably 
only grew throughout his career. 
For 20 years, Mr. Art Chianello has been an 
exemplary public servant. His leadership, abil-
ity to work collaboratively, and desire to help 
others have been essential to securing suc-
cessful outcomes for the Bakersfield Water 
Resources Department and for all the resi-
dents of the City of Bakersfield. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
House of Representatives to join me in recog-
nizing the career of Mr. Art Chianello and 
wishing him the best in retirement.

LES REARDANZ RETIREMENT 
HON. RICK LARSEN 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 21, 2022 
Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Madam Speak-
er, I rise in recognition of the retirement of Les 
Reardanz and his remarkable 31-year career 
of service in the United States Navy. 
Les’s years in uniform have meant time 
away from his family and friends. He has 
served our country, the Navy and our commu-
nity with devotion and integrity. Whether on 
deployment in Afghanistan, advising the Chair-
man of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on legal mat-
ters, or helping safeguard Puget Sound fol-
lowing 9/11, Les’s tours of duty were as ex-
pansive as his skill set. The Navy and the 
Judge Advocate General’s Corps are undoubt-
edly better off thanks to his years of service 
and leadership. 
Les also served as Executive Director for 
the Port of Everett. During his tenure, he 
strengthened the critical relationship between 
the Port and the Navy and helped lay the 
foundation to expand the seaport and rede-
velop the Everett waterfront. Also, Les played 
a key role in reaching the agreement that cre-
ated the Blue Heron Slough. 
I wish Les the best as his Navy career 
ends, new chapters begin and as he continues 
serving his community at the Whatcom Trans-
portation Authority. 
I thank Les for his dedicated service and 
congratulate him on a job well done.

RECOGNIZING ELLIOT BERRY 
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 21, 2022 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
alongside my colleague Congresswoman ANN 
MCLANE KUSTER to honor Elliot Berry and his 
forty-seven years of service to New Hamp-
shire Legal Assistance. Through his impactful 
career, Elliot embodied the highest values of 
service to our state’s most vulnerable commu-
nity members. 
Witnessing the systematic and legal chal-
lenges faced by the residents he served, Elliot 
dedicated his efforts to not only helping his cli-
ents navigate the system but making positive 
changes to our state’s housing policies. New 
Hampshire residents enjoy more protective 
renter’s rights and housing laws thanks to El-
liot’s work. These protections will continue to 
benefit hundreds of families across New 
Hampshire long after his retirement, making 
our state safer and more economically viable 
for the future. 
In 1975, Elliot began his journey with New 
Hampshire Legal Assistance after graduating 
from Boston College Law School and starting 
out as a VISTA volunteer. Throughout thou-
sands of cases for individual clients, appeals, 
and class-action lawsuits, Elliot stayed reso-
lute in his commitment to protecting the most 
vulnerable members of our communities. This 
spirit of service was exemplified in Elliot’s 
challenges to a series of local zoning laws 
proposed in the 1990s that precluded the de-
velopment of low-to-moderate income housing 
units. Elliot’s advocacy extended past housing 
issues to include representing incarcerated 
men and women across New Hampshire, re-
sulting in the construction of a new prison fa-
cility for women in Concord and improved ac-
cess to mental health and drug counseling 
services for men and women. 
Elliot’s belief in the right to safe and afford-
able housing distinguishes him as a true 
champion for low-income families, and the leg-
acy of his service will continue to improve the 
lives of residents across the Granite State for 
years to come. 
On behalf of the constituents of New Hamp-
shire’s First and Second Congressional Dis-
tricts, we thank Elliot for his many years of 
service, and for being part of what makes the 
Granite State such a special place to live. We 
are honored to recognize and congratulate El-
liot on his retirement and wish him the best of 
luck in his next chapter.

HONORING THE LIFE OF GERI 
LANGLOIS 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 21, 2022 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to mourn the passing of a beloved 
Northeastern Connecticut public servant, Mr. 
Geri Langlois of Windham, Connecticut. Geri 
Langlois sadly passed at the all too young age 
of 68 on Sunday, September 18, 2022, after a 
valiant battle with myelodysplastic syndrome. 
Mr. Langlois was a leader who was instru-
mental in executing successful development 
projects in eastern Connecticut which will have 
a lasting legacy on the lives of residents 
throughout the region. 
Born on April 16, 1954, in Putnam, Con-
necticut to Carol and Edrose Langlois, Geri 
grew up with his family only a few towns south 
of Windham in Canterbury. Geri graduated 
from Windham High School and continued to 
practice his devotion to learning at Southern Il-
linois University Carbondale. Geri was a true 
jack of all trades, including, for example, the 
additional education he gained from MIT 
where he studied computer sciences, as well 
as his numerous other passions, from gar-
dening to crafting custom guitars. 
Upon his graduation from university, Geri’s 
lifelong arc began to bend to its true form: 
public service. In applying his unique ability to 
master any new skill or challenge before him, 
Geri first started out as an organizer for the 
Connecticut Citizen Action Group, committing 
himself toward the mission of creating a just 
and sustainable Connecticut. Given his natural 
success at community organizing, Geri then 
ran for and was elected to the position of First 
Selectman of the Town of Thompson, yet an-
other community in the northern reaches of 
the Second District of Connecticut. Among his 
countless skills, Geri was clearly most adept 
as an advocate for others, and his neighbors 
ultimately promoted him to the elected office 
of State Representative of the 51st District. 
Madam Speaker, I had the pleasure of serving 
in the Connecticut General Assembly in the 
1980s and early 1990s as a colleague of Geri, 
and had a front row seat to watch him in ac-
tion. I witnessed his intelligent, principled ad-
vocacy for the people of the 51st District 
which was highly successful. State Represent-
ative Langlois specifically facilitated many key 
economic development projects including the 
revitalization of Windham Mills, an iconic site 
in the Town of Windham as well as the enact-
ment of a prescription drug plan for Con-
necticut seniors in 1987 which predated the 
U.S. Congress passage of Medicare Part D by 
14 years. Geri was a great friend and an ally 
on many issues during our time together and 
his honorable service will be remembered for 
all time. 
Geri Langlois’ charisma extended far past 
the state officials he routinely worked with and 
came to be known as a ‘‘fighter of the peo-
ple.’’ After his terms as State Representative 
and First Selectman, Geri remained a stalwart 
champion of economic development through 
his tenure as Executive Director at the North-
east Connecticut Economic Alliance and Presi-
dent of the Windham Mills Development Cor-
poration. At the Northeast Connecticut Eco-
nomic Alliance, he helped struggling small 
businesses obtain funding when they were 
locked out of obtaining funds from traditional 
lending sources, spurring economic activity 
throughout all of Windham County. As a mem-
ber of the Windham Zoning Board of Appeals, 
he remained an active participant in commu-
nity-based discussions, oriented toward eco-
nomic development, through to his final days. 
Geri’s most defining trait was his love for his 
family. Despite Geri leading an immensely 
busy life and career, he always made certain 
to prioritize his wife of 27 years, Sherry, chil-
dren, and grandchildren. In fact, the bond be-
tween Sherry and Geri was so well tuned that 
they even co-founded a business together, 
Rapid Framework, which was missioned to-
ward supporting other businesses through 
website development services. 
Madam Speaker, it is an honor to represent 
constituents as devoted to the prosperity of 
their community as Geri Langlois. Geri’s sto-
ried career of public service is a shining bea-
con that has reflected onto countless others to 
inspire good citizenship. I am honored to have 
gained the opportunity to work with such a re-
markable individual on behalf of eastern Con-
necticut. His memory will live on in the hearts 
of his family and throughout the communities 
and businesses which he helped grow. To that 
end, I ask that my colleagues in the House 
join me in honoring Geri’s life, so that his dis-
tinct work in service to the region may never 
be forgotten.

HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF 
KEITH SWARTZENTRUBER 
HON. DARIN LaHOOD 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 21, 2022 
Mr. LAHOOD. Madam Speaker, I would like 
to congratulate Keith Swartzentruber, the ex-
ecutive director of Snyder Village, who is retir-
ing after 34 wonderful years of service across 
Central Illinois. 
Keith Swartzentruber joined the staff as an 
administrator of Snyder Village when it opened 
its doors in 1988 and has held the position of 
executive director at Snyder Village for the last 
17 years. Under his leadership, Snyder Village 
has grown from a modest organization offering 
a health center and six independent living cot-
tages to the full-life plan community that it is 
today. Currently, over 400 residents call Sny-
der Village home, and roughly 240 staff mem-
bers make up the Snyder Village team. Span-
ning over 48 acres, Snyder Village now en-
compasses a skilled nursing health center, as-
sisted living, home care services, inpatient and 
outpatient therapy, and a retirement commu-
nity with 40 apartments and 170 cottages. 
As a true servant leader, Keith encourages 
and supports staff to embody the Snyder Vil-
lage mission statement: to provide for the 
physical, emotional, and spiritual needs of oth-
ers in a loving, dignified, and Christian atmos-
phere. Keith exemplifies the high level of care 
and service which has made Snyder Village 
the remarkable place it is. He can often be 
found visiting with residents and staff mem-
bers, ensuring they feel valued and cared for. 
His leadership and service have been recog-
nized by his peers and the community through 
several awards, including the Life Services 
Network Leadership Recognition Award. 
Our community has been fortunate to ben-
efit from the service and leadership of Keith 
Swartzentruber. I extend my sincere congratu-
lations to Keith on his 34 years of service at 
Snyder Village. I wish him much success as 
he continues to lead a life of service to the 
Metamora community and central Illinois.

HONORING THE WORK OF DR. 
ROBERT FICKLIN 
HON. BRUCE WESTERMAN 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 21, 2022 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Dr. Robert Ficklin, for-
estry professor at the University of Arkansas 
at Monticello, for receiving the Society of 
American Foresters (SAF) Fellows Award. The 
SAF Fellows Award is the highest recognition 
in the forestry profession. It is a testament to 
Dr. Ficklin’s lifetime of service to the industry 
and the Society of American Foresters in par-
ticular. Dr. Ficklin is only the third forestry pro-
fessor in the history of UAM to receive this es-
teemed honor. 
Dr. Ficklin has made extraordinary contribu-
tions to the forestry industry at a local, state, 
and national level. His service and leadership 
over the last twenty years at UAM has left a 
lasting impact on his students. His former stu-
dents now hold professional forestry and envi-
ronmental management positions in state and 
federal agencies, as well as various academic 
positions. Dr. Ficklin was recognized for his 
impact in the UAM forestry program by being 
the first forestry faculty member to become a 
finalist in the Hornaday Outstanding Faculty 
Award. 
In addition to his impact on students, Dr. 
Ficklin has been instrumental in research and 
innovation. His research on forest soils in the 
Ozark uplands, the Western Gulf Coastal 
Plain, and the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Valley 
have been presented nationally. His research 
has resulted in numerous publications, papers, 
reports, abstracts, and presentations that will 
be used for many years. 
I am proud to recognize Dr. Ficklin today for 
his many accomplishments and to thank him 
for his commitment, dedication, and service to 
the forestry industry. Dr. Ficklin’s contributions 
to the forestry sector will be felt for years to 
come. Arkansas is the gold standard when it 
comes to forestry, and that is in large part due 
to forestry leaders like Dr. Robert Ficklin.

so they can enjoy a day outdoors with their 
friends and families. Mike Stachel and David 
Windholz ask nothing for themselves and pro-
vide a joyous and wholesome experience that 
creates memories that last forever. They have 
been doing this selflessly for over four dec-
ades. 
We commend them for their community spir-

children, the disabled, and the seniors of my 
district. We are proud to salute their efforts to 
continue to provide these wonderful events for 
so many generations of my district’s residents.

roles in leadership. May her joy to help others 
continue to impact more lives, and her story 
be a role model to many.

sands of dollars. Most of all, the credit union 
encourages NYCHA residents to open bank 
accounts in a community where many do not 
have access to mainstream banks and face 
additional hurdles to securing a bank account. 
Urban Upbound has also helped over 25,000 
residents prepare their taxes and file returns, 
helping them secure more than $25 million in 
tax 
refunds. 
Through 
this 
work, 
Urban 
Upbound promotes long-term asset building 
and provides economic mobility to the commu-
nity. 
Urban Upbound’s efforts extend beyond fi-
nancial aid. The organization provides college 
counseling through SAT prep courses and ad-
vising, which has led to a 95 percent college 
placement rate for residents enrolled in the 
pre-college program. The heavy emphasis 
Urban Upbound places on the importance of 
education signals its commitment to the 
generational growth and success of its neigh-
borhoods. 
Urban Upbound also provides employment 
services, helps create and polish resumes, 
conducts mock interviews, and provides ca-
reer counseling, which has helped approxi-
mately 1,800 clients secure employment. 
When it comes to helping residents achieve 
their goals of a better life, Urban Upbound 
truly is a champion for the residents of public 
housing. 
Urban Upbound is hosting a gala to honor 
its eighteen years of service with the appro-
priate theme ‘‘Celebrating Success.’’ This 
year’s festivities mark a return to in-person 
celebrations following the COVID–19 Pan-
demic, during which Urban Upbound provided 
the community with resource assistance. As a 
partner in New York City’s COVID–19 Take 
Care Initiative, Urban Upbound helped individ-
uals throughout the Queens NYCHA commu-
nity find recovery care, practice quarantine 
protocols, and secure basic needs such as 
food, medicine, and laundry. This year’s gala 
celebrates in the triumphant resilience of 
Urban Upbound and the community it proudly 
serves. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing the outstanding work of 
Urban Upbound. For eighteen years, Urban 
Upbound has worked to help break the cycle 
of poverty and create a positive impact on 
low-income communities. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF U.S. 
JUDGE STERLING JOHNSON 
HON. THOMAS R. SUOZZI 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 21, 2022 
Mr. SUOZZI. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the legacy of Judge Sterling Johnson 
who passed away on October 17, 2022. Judge 
Johnson will be remembered as a devoted 
family man, advocate for individuals suffering 
from AIDS, dedicated jurist, special drug pros-
ecutor, member of the New York City Police 
Department, U.S. Marine veteran and mentor 
to the next generation of young attorneys. 
At a time when AIDS was still considered a 
terrifying death sentence, Judge Johnson 
fought relentlessly for the humane treatment of 
individuals suffering from AIDS. In 1993, he 
ordered the government to immediately shut 
down a Guanta´namo Bay detention facility that 
was full of Haitian refugees who had been 
found eligible for asylum but were denied 
entry into the United States solely because 
they had H.I.V. or AIDS. He likened their living 
conditions to ‘‘an H.I.V. prison camp’’. In an-
other remarkable case, Judge Johnson ruled 
that New York City had failed to provide ne-
cessities to thousands of residents who were 
poverty stricken and suffered from AIDS. 
These necessities included emergency hous-
ing, food stamps and Medicaid. He ordered a 
federal magistrate to make sure that the AIDS 
stricken population had access to these bene-
fits. In this way he used his power to alleviate 
the suffering of thousands of society’s most 
vulnerable members. 
Prior to his time on the bench, Judge John-
son was a member of the New York City Po-
lice Department. While serving in this capacity, 
he received his undergraduate degree from 
Brooklyn College and graduated in the top ten 
percent of the Brooklyn Law School Class of 
1966. Judge Johnson left the police force the 
following year to accept an appointment as an 
assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern Dis-
trict of New York based in Manhattan where 
he prosecuted more than 7,000 criminal 
cases. He also served as the City’s special 
narcotics prosecutor and was named execu-
tive liaison officer for the Drug Enforcement 
Administration’s Presidential Drug Advisory 
Council under President Gerald Ford. In 1991, 
President George H.W. Bush nominated 
Judge Johnson for the United States Court for 
the Eastern District of New York. During his 
30-year tenure on the bench, Judge Johnson 
ruled in over 500 cases. 
Judge Johnson also served as the executive 
director of the NYPD Civilian Complaint Re-
view Board, investigating allegations of police 
misconduct and brutality. Judge Johnson was 
a founding member of the National Organiza-
tion of Black Law Enforcement. The New York 
Chapter of this organization is named in his 
honor. He was also instrumental in founding 
the National Black Prosecutors Association. 
Judge Johnson was also a sought-after guest 
lecturer and gave speeches at universities 
around the world. 
Despite his demanding career, Judge John-
son always made time to mentor young attor-
neys. His office was full of young lawyers 
seeking his wisdom and advice. He instilled 
the values of duty, dedication, discipline, integ-
rity, and social justice in the next generation of 
lawyers. He would often say ‘‘If you are early, 
you are on time. If you are on time, you are 
late.’’ He deeply believed that one must be a 
leader, take initiative, and zealously chase 
one’s ambitions. When Justice Ketanji Brown 
Jackson started her career, she asked Judge 
Johnson if she should become a judge. As a 
result of his guidance and encouragement, 
she went on to make history as the first black 
female Supreme Court Justice. 
In addition to his distinguished career, 
Judge Johnson also raised a remarkable fam-
ily. He was a devoted husband to Barbara 
Johnson and a loving father to his children 
Sterling III, Alicia and Jennifer, and daughter- 
in-law Wendy Johnson. Judge Johnson was 
especially close to his son-in-law, David Dan-
iels. Judge Johnson was lovingly called G.Pa 
by his grandchildren Jessica Barnes and F. 
Attiyya Akinwole; and was a doting great 
grandfather to his adorable great grand pup-
pies Jibe, Oba, and Enzo. Judge Johnson en-
joyed fishing and playing solitaire. We take 
solace in the thought that Judge Johnson has 
been reunited in heaven with his daughter 
Alicia and dog Oba. 
I offer my deepest sympathy and prayers to 
Judge Johnson’s family and hope that the 
knowledge that he is remembered so dearly 
by his friends and colleagues will bring com-
fort during this difficult time.

RECOGNIZING 
MR. 
DAVID 
PAUL 
HORAN’S 80 YEARS OF COMMU-
NITY SERVICE AND LEGAL AC-
COMPLISHMENTS 
HON. CARLOS A. GIMENEZ 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 21, 2022 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Key West native Mr. David Paul 
Horan for his community leadership and nota-
ble achievements in admiralty and maritime 
law. 
David Horan has spent almost 50 years 
serving on various community boards and 
commissions in the Florida Keys. Since 1973, 
he has served as a Director of the Greater 
Key West Chamber of Commerce. Other lead-
ership roles have included serving on the Key 
West Military Affairs Committee, the Florida 
Keys National Marine Advisory Sanctuary 
Counsel, 
and 
the 
Special 
Environmental 
Counsel for Monroe County. In 2001, Mr. 
Horan was inducted into the Key West Cham-
ber of Commerce Hall of Fame, Key West’s 
highest community service award. 
In addition to his work serving the commu-
nity, David is an accomplished lawyer. Admit-
ted to the Florida Bar in 1972, David special-
izes in complex federal and state litigation. 
Much of his career has been dedicated to pro-
tecting local interests against excessive regu-
lation. One pro-bono case of David’s, Young 
v. DCA, was monumental: the Florida Su-
preme Court’s opinion reversed almost twenty 
years of decisions on the ‘‘burden of proof’’ 
issue, significantly restricting the state of Flor-
ida’s authority to overturn local governmental 
decisions. David has also represented many 
commercial fishermen in addition to salvors of 
historic shipwrecks, generally centuries-old 
Spanish galleons sunk along Florida’s coast. 
Another of David’s notable legal victories 
came in his successful oral argument in the

1982 Supreme Court case Florida Dept. of 
State v. Treasure Salvors, Inc, which con-
cerned the ownership of salvage from the 
1622 Spanish Galleon Nuestra Senora de 
Atocha. The Supreme Court rejected the 
State’s claim to the property and upheld the 
transfer of artifacts to Treasure Salvors. 
What an honor it is to recognize David 
Horan for his phenomenal career in law and 
life of service to the Florida Keys and Florid-
ians across the state. I wish David, his wife, 
five children, and many grandchildren all the 
best as he begins a ninth decade of a very full 
life.

REMEMBERING LOUIS J. 
FRANCHIMON 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 21, 2022 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and lasting contribu-
tions of Louis J. Franchimon. Passing away at 
the age of 84, Mr. Franchimon leaves behind 
an indelible legacy in the labor community 
throughout the Bay Area. 
Mr. Franchimon was born on March 12, 
1938, in the Netherlands. At a young age, Mr. 
Franchimon and his family immigrated to the 
United States for his father’s work with the 
Dutch Embassy in Washington, D.C. Through-
out his career, Mr. Franchimon developed a 
passion for bettering the working conditions 
and furthering the development of proper train-
ing, organized labor, and fair compensation for 
working people in construction. His ceaseless 
devotion to this work throughout the Bay Area, 
especially in Napa and Solano counties, 
earned him the admiration of his community 
as well as numerous accolades. As a lifelong 
advocate, Mr. Franchimon greatly benefitted 
the labor community in Northern California 
through his tireless efforts. 
Through his passion and advocacy, Mr. 
Franchimon left a lasting impact on the com-
munity. His significant legacy is commemo-
rated in the annual ‘‘Lou Franchimon Lifetime 
Achievement Award’’ awarded by the Napa 
Solano Central Labor Council. In 2012, Mr. 
Franchimon received the first of this award, 
the highest honor given by the Council to 
date. It is now awarded each year to a worthy 
recipient who embodies Mr. Franchimon’s de-
votion to defending and bettering the labor 
movement. 
Mr. Franchimon is survived by his two sis-
ters, three children, several grandchildren and 
great-grandchildren, and a community that will 
miss his enduring spirit. I would like to extend 
my deepest sympathies to Mr. Franchimon’s 
loved ones. I know that they, along with the 
entire Bay Area community, join me in cele-
brating his life and legacy.

RECOGNIZING MR. FRANCISCO 
CASTILLON 
HON. DAVID G. VALADAO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 21, 2022 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Mr. Francisco Castillon for 
receiving the National Association of Commu-
nity Health Center’s Lifetime Achievement 
Award. 
As a migrant and seasonal farmworker for 
over 12 years throughout his youth, Mr. 
Castillon experienced the challenges in ac-
cessing healthcare firsthand. As a result, his 
career has been centered on delivering high- 
quality medical, dental, behavioral, and other 
services to the medically underserved, espe-
cially the poor, the voiceless, and farmworkers 
and their families. For over 30 years, Mr. 
Castillon has worked for Community and Mi-
grant Health Centers (C/MHC) as CEO, Dep-
uty Director, Program Manager and Consult-
ant. In addition, Mr. Castillon served as the 
President and CEO of the California Health 
Federation, representing over 300 health cen-
ters throughout California. Furthermore, he 
was also the Chairman of the Board of the 
National Association of Community Health 
Centers (NACHC), which is based out of 
Washington D.C. and represents over 1,500 
C/MHCs. 
Since 2010, Mr. Francisco Castillon has 
served as CEO of Omni Family Health, a 
growing network of state-of-the-art health cen-
ters located throughout Kern, Kings, Tulare, 
and Fresno counties. During Mr. Castillon’s 
time as CEO, Omni has expanded from 12 
health centers to 38, more than doubling the 
number of patients served. Mr. Castillon con-
tinues to lead Omni’s growth, with plans to 
open future locations in Kern and Fresno 
Counties. Serving the medically underserved 
individuals and families in our communities 
has been Mr. Castillon’s lifelong passion. 
Mr. Castillon is a mission-driven executive, 
well respected among his peers and within the 
communities he has served. One of the keys 
to his success is a firm commitment to man-
aging C/MHCs with honesty, integrity, and 
transparency. He is one of very few execu-
tives within the C/MHC movement that has 
earned five national awards for his contribu-
tions and accomplishments in serving these 
vulnerable groups. For these reasons, Mr. 
Castillon was the perfect candidate to be hon-
ored by the NACHC with the Lifetime Achieve-
ment Award for his achievements, dedication, 
and contributions to the community health 
center movement. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
House of Representatives to join me in hon-
oring the achievements of Mr. Francisco 
Castillon and congratulating him on receiving 
the NACHC Lifetime Achievement Award.
