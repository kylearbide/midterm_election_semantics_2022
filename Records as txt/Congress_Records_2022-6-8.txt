AND STILL I RISE: THOSE WHO 
TOLERATE GUN VIOLENCE PER-
PETUATE IT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. GREEN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, and still I rise. I rise today with a 
message of grave concern, especially 
for those who have suffered in Uvalde, 
Texas, with reference to the slaughter 
that took place there, the mass mur-
ders. 
But I do have something that gives 
me some degree of hope. I have an open 
letter that was published in The Dallas 
Morning News that I would like the 
share. I would like to read some ex-
cerpts from the letter. It is styled: ‘‘An 
Open Letter Supporting Senator JOHN 
CORNYN and Gun Safety Measures.’’ 
It reads in part: 
We, the undersigned, are conservatives, 
mostly from Texas and our friends from 
other States, outdoor and gun enthusiasts. 
We vote for Republican Senators. We believe 
in the Second Amendment. 
It goes on to read: 
We are especially encouraged that Senator 
CORNYN is focusing on two vital ways to im-
prove gun safety: red flag law and expanding 
background checks. 
We are also hopeful that the momentum 
building for those two changes may also spur 
consideration of raising the age to purchase 
a gun to 21, which we believe is another im-
portant step in curbing gun violence. 
They close with: 
There are many of us across these great 
United States. We are organizing. Please join 
us. 
I thank them, the conservatives, gun 
enthusiasts, and those who support 
Senators. I want to thank them for this 
open letter because this issue of gun vi-
olence is one that we have to have a 
collective response to. The politicians 
alone will not solve this problem. 
I respect my colleagues and the polit-
ical order. I happen to be one of them. 
But I know that there has to be some 
input from the influentials of the 
world, the chambers of commerce and 
the businesses communities. 
So I encourage the business commu-
nities to do as these businesspersons 
have done: Take a stand, a public 
stand. Take a stand for justice. Take a 
stand for these children. Take a stand 
against mass murders. Please take a 
stand. Those who tolerate this perpet-
uate it. 
f 
THE CRISIS AT THE BORDER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, this past week, I joined a 
group of 12 of my colleagues to visit 
our southern border and to see first-
hand the crisis that President Biden’s 
open border policies have created. 
What we saw were massive gaps in 
our border wall that allow for the car-
tels to traffic money, drugs, and 
human beings across our southern bor-
der. The Border Patrol agents whom we 
spoke with told us that in the Rio 
Grande sector that they are encoun-
tering nearly 10,000 migrants each 
month. 
In the past year Border Patrol agents 
have apprehended people from 174 na-
tions attempting to cross our border. 
And even more troubling, they have en-
countered 42 individuals on the ter-
rorist watch list. 
According to Border Patrol data, 
over 1,200 pounds of fentanyl were 
seized in the month of April alone, and 
at a time when we have just seen over 
100,000 
Americans 
killed 
by 
drug 
overdoses, this spike in fentanyl traf-
ficking has made each and every State 
a border State. 
It is time to address this crisis. It is 
time to finish our border wall—a wall 
that President Biden has refused to 
complete while $350 million of unused 
border wall rust away underneath the 
Texas sun. 
In his budget for this year, Joe Biden 
doesn’t even mention the crisis on the 
border. Instead of giving our Border 
Patrol agents the tools that they need, 
President Biden has proposed to cut 
$800 million from the Department of 
Homeland Security budget. If Presi-
dent Biden were to visit the border, he 
would see this crisis firsthand. But, in-
stead, he has chosen to hide from the 
problem and continue to allow deadly 
drugs to flow into our communities and 
kill our citizens. 
The American people can’t afford to 
wait any longer. It is time for the

REMEMBERING THE HONORABLE 
ELLA SCARBOROUGH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. ADAMS) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. ADAMS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to remember my friend who was 
a champion for the people of Charlotte, 
Mecklenburg County, and North Caro-
lina; a trailblazer for Black women, es-
pecially those in public service; and a 
sincere, authentic, and humble servant 
of God who always looked out for ‘‘the 
least of these’’: the Honorable Ella 
Butler Scarborough. 
I include in the RECORD, Madam 
Speaker, a remembrance from her col-
leagues on the Mecklenburg County 
Commission that reads in part: ‘‘Com-
missioner Scarborough’s passion was 
limitless, and her loss is immeas-
urable.’’ 
BOARD OF COUNTY COMMISSIONERS 
STATEMENT FROM THE MECKLENBURG BOARD OF 
COUNTY
COMMISSIONERS—ELLA
SCAR-
BOROUGH, CONGRESSIONAL RECORD 
The Mecklenburg Board of County Com-
missioners was saddened to learn of the pass-
ing of Commissioner Ella Butler Scar-
borough. 
Commissioner Scarborough was more than 
a colleague or public figure. Throughout her 
life, Commissioner Scarborough was a pillar 
in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg community 
who made an immense impact, especially on 
the 
lives 
of 
our 
most 
vulnerable 
and 
marginalized citizens. 
Commissioner Scarborough was elected to 
the Mecklenburg Board of County Commis-
sioners in 2014, and went on to serve as Chair 
from 2016 to 2018, making her the first Afri-
can American woman to be elected to that 
position. 
Prior to serving on the Board of County 
Commissioners, Commissioner Scarborough 
made history as the first African American 
woman to be elected to the Charlotte City 
Council, serving from 1987 to 1997 (district 
and at-large). She was also a statewide can-
didate for U.S. Senate in 1998 and ran for 
Charlotte mayor in 1999 and 2001. In 2008, 
Commissioner 
Scarborough 
served 
as 
a 
North Carolina delegate at the Democratic 
National Convention. In the 1960s, during her 
youth in South Carolina, she became known 
for her activity in the civil rights movement. 
A fierce advocate for youth literacy, solu-
tions to homelessness and equality, Commis-
sioner Scarborough’s tireless efforts and 
dedication to the community at-large was 
exemplary and instrumental in eliminating 
inequities that created challenges for many 
in our community. 
Commissioner Scarborough was a member 
of Friendship Missionary Baptist Church. 
She was the devoted mother to two children 
and widow of Levern ‘‘Pete’’ Scarborough. 
She graduated from South Carolina State 
University with a degree in library science 
education and earned a master’s degree from 
the University of Charleston in West Vir-
ginia in organizational leadership. 
Commissioner Scarborough’s passion was 
limitless. and her loss is immeasurable. Our 
prayers go out to her family, friends and the 
entire Mecklenburg County community that 
is a better place today due to her dedication. 
Signed—The Mecklenburg Board of County 
Commissioners: 
Chairman—George Dunlap, District 3. 
Vice Chair—Elaine Powell, District 1. 
Pat Cotham, At-Large. 
Leigh Altman, At-large. 
Wilhelmenia I. Rembert, Temporary At- 
Large. 
Vilma D. Leake, District 2. 
Mark Jerrell, District 4. 
Laura Meier, District 5. 
Susan Rodriguez-McDowell, District 6. 
Ms. ADAMS. Madam Speaker, Ella’s 
loss is immeasurable in part because 
she was a veteran of the civil rights 
movement going all the way back to 
her youth in South Carolina. The con-
sciousness and her conscience of that 
movement was seen in her work as a 
pillar of our community who fought for 
our vulnerable and marginalized. 
She worked for equality and equity 
not only for Black Americans but for 
every community. She worked for the 
homeless and unhoused; she worked for 
youth literacy and public education. 
Even as her health failed, she never 
stopped fighting. 
Like many HBCU graduates from her 
generation, she made history. She was 
the 
first 
African-American 
woman 
elected to the Charlotte City Council 
and the first to serve as the chair of 
the Mecklenburg County Commission. 
Her leadership opened doors and in-
spired others. She encouraged other 
Black women to run and serve. 
But Ella was the kind of person who 
was more concerned about the work 
she did than the history she made. She 
was a true child of the civil rights gen-
eration. She was the great-grandniece 
of the legendary Mary McLeod Be-
thune. Her entire family was involved 
in the movement. 
When she was 17, she put her body 
and her life on the line to integrate a 
segregated movie theater in her com-
munity. Five years later, as a student 
at South Carolina State, she did the 
same at a bowling alley in Orangeburg. 
This time the activists were not so 
lucky. South Carolina Highway Patrol 
officers fired into the crowd of stu-
dents—Ella’s friends—killing 3 and in-
juring 10 times as many. Ella was spir-
ited away out of danger by a member of 
the football team. 
It is a blessing that Ella was spared 
that day to continue her fight. Even 
when she was jailed in the fight to end 
Jim Crow, she never stopped fighting, 
and she never forgot her blessings. 
However, overcoming adversity and 
integrating 
segregated 
spaces 
was 
something she had done since the day 
she was born. 
As Charlotte’s Hannah Hasan wrote: 
She has been fighting since birth. She was 
born premature; 3 pounds. At that time 
Black babies weren’t guaranteed an incu-
bator, so her little body had to fight just to 
exist. 
Indeed, when her father convinced 
the hospital to admit baby Ella to the 
ICU in Sumter, she became the first 
Black baby in that space. Perhaps that 
miracle was why she was never afraid. 
It was a miracle. 
But the greater miracle of Ella Scar-
borough was that after she counted her 
many blessings, she extended those 
blessings to others, both as a member 
of her faith home, Friendship Mis-
sionary Baptist Church, and then as an 
elected official and public servant. 
Blessings are not just ours to have 
but to give. 
That was the lesson that I hope we 
can all learn from Councilwoman, 
Commissioner, and Chairwoman Ella 
Scarborough as we honor and remem-
ber her today. 
f 
GETTING GUN CRIMINALS OFF 
THE STREETS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, 
the mass shootings across our country 
cry out for solutions that work. The 
good news is we know what works, and 
we also know what doesn’t work. 
We have been passing gun control 
laws for more than 50 years. The num-
ber of American households with fire-
arms has dropped significantly in those 
years. 
So let me ask: Are things getting 
better or worse? 
We know this from decades of experi-
ence: Gun control laws are extremely 
effective at disarming law-abiding citi-
zens. They are completely ineffective 
at disarming criminals, madmen, and 
terrorists. They create a world where 
law-abiding citizens are defenseless and 
the gunman is king. 
The day after the Uvalde massacre, a 
criminal with an AR–15-style rifle shot 
into a crowd that was gathered for a 
graduation party in Charleston, West 
Virginia. A woman with a concealed 
weapon shot him dead on the spot. No-
body else was hurt. Had that occurred 
on a school property or other so-called 
gun-free zone, the death toll could eas-
ily have been counted by the dozens. 
The left scoffs at the notion that 
only a good guy with a gun can stop a 
bad guy with a gun. 
Well, do they know of any other way? 
There is none. 
The only question is how long it will 
take for that good guy with a gun to 
show up. It has often been said that the 
police can be there in minutes when 
seconds count. And what we found time 
and again is that even when the police 
get there, they don’t always act. 
Those who are directly threatened by 
a gunman are those who are in the best 
position to stop such an attack because 
they are there on the spot and their 
lives depend on it. And yet the left 
won’t let them. 
We think nothing of seeing an armed 
guard at a bank or a shopping mall. 
They are there to protect our money 
and our merchandise by killing bad 
guys with guns. Yet the left goes ber-
serk when anyone suggests that we do 
the same thing to protect our children. 
What makes the left believe gun laws 
will be any more effective at keeping

guns out of the hands of criminals than 
our drug laws have been at keeping 
drugs out of the hands of addicts? 
The difference is that drug laws don’t 
disarm law-abiding citizens from de-
fending themselves, their children, and 
their fellow citizens. Gun laws do. 
The President tells us that hardening 
our schools isn’t the answer. Well, if he 
actually meant that, he ought to dis-
miss the Secret Service and open the 
front door of the White House and be 
sure to declare it a gun-free zone. 
Of 
course, 
hardening 
vulnerable 
venues like schools works. There is a 
reason why 98 percent of mass shoot-
ings occur in so-called gun-free zones: 
There is nobody there to shoot back, 
and the criminals know that. The Buf-
falo shooter noted precisely that in his 
manifesto. 
The good news is we know what 
works. Prosecuting gun criminals and 
putting them in prison until they are 
old and gray works. Yet woke district 
attorneys across the country refuse to 
do so. Executing murderers works. Yet 
the left has largely succeeded in all but 
abolishing the death penalty. 
b 1015 
And protecting the right of respon-
sible citizens to return fire works. It 
stops an estimated half million to 2 
million crimes in this country every 
year. 
The father of modern policing, Sir 
Robert Peale, often observed that the 
police are simply an extension of com-
munity; that, in reality, the commu-
nity is the police and the police are the 
community. Every citizen, he said, has 
a right and duty to defend themselves 
and to uphold the law. The police are 
there, not to replace private citizens, 
but to support them. 
So let me ask, is the surest path out 
of this violent chapter of our history 
the quixotic quest to get 400 million 
guns off the streets, or is it to get the 
criminals who use them off the streets? 
That is what we once did, before social 
justice replaced criminal justice. 
We prosecuted gun criminals to the 
fullest measure of the law. We executed 
murderers. 
We 
identified 
the 
dan-
gerously mentally ill and confined 
them so we could treat them. These 
measures worked until the left seized 
control of our cities and reversed them. 
I think it is long past time to take 
those streets back, get the criminals 
and dangerously mentally ill off of 
them, and protect our children with 
the same resolve and force as we use to 
protect our money. 
f 
HONORING THE 100TH INFANTRY 
BATTALION OF HAWAII 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Hawaii (Mr. CASE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CASE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today with my colleagues to recognize 
and honor the selfless service of the 
Japanese Americans who served our 
country in World War II with the 
famed 100th Infantry Battalion of Ha-
waii, or the One Puka Puka. 
This year, the fabled 100th celebrates 
its 80th anniversary. The battalion was 
composed of 1,400 Americans of Japa-
nese ancestry whose loyalty was ques-
tioned by our government following 
the attacks on Pearl Harbor and much 
worse. Although much of the U.S. pub-
lic looked upon them with disdain and 
skepticism, these soldiers simply per-
severed. Their story is one of patriot-
ism, tenacity, and courage. 
Following the attacks on Pearl Har-
bor, and when anti-Japanese hysteria 
was at its peak, these young men 
raised their hands and demanded the 
right to defend America. 
With the support of U.S. military of-
ficers and others in Hawaii and else-
where, the Federal Government even-
tually created an all-nisei, or second- 
generation Japanese-American Army 
unit, the 100th Infantry Battalion. 
Just before their deployment in Au-
gust of 1943, the men of the One Puka 
Puka selected the motto ‘‘Remember 
Pearl Harbor’’ to reflect their anger at 
the attack on their country. 
Although the cloud of racism and un-
derlying 
uncertainty 
hovered 
over 
these brave Americans, their perform-
ance was nothing less than exemplary. 
In September 1943, the 100th arrived in 
North Africa, but soon transferred to 
central Italy, where it faced heavy 
combat. It eventually became known 
as the Purple Heart Battalion because 
of its high casualty rate. 
One of its members and casualties 
was Captain Spark Matsunaga, who 
suffered grievous injuries in a mine 
field. He later became a Member of this 
hallowed House and, after that, a 
United States Senator, inspiring gen-
erations, including me, who was privi-
leged to serve 3 years on his staff. His 
own story is just one of countless we 
can and should remember. 
In August, 1944, and after a year of 
combat, the battalion integrated with 
the Japanese Americans of the 442nd 
Regimental Combat Team. They then 
continued to fight through Italy and 
France. The men of the 100th spent 20 
months in Europe and fought in six 
campaigns across Italy and France. 
They received six Distinguished Serv-
ice Crosses and earned three Presi-
dential Unit Citations. Along with the 
442nd, the 100th Infantry Battalion is 
recognized 
as 
the 
most 
decorated 
American unit in our history for its 
size and length of service. 
The lineage and honors of the 100th 
and 442nd live on today and are pre-
served by the 100th Battalion, 442d In-
fantry, U.S. Army Reserve. Today, the 
unit is staffed with reservists from Ha-
waii, American Samoa, Guam, and 
Saipan. These men and women carry on 
the legacy of the soldiers that endured 
so much before them 80 years ago. 
We all owe a debt of gratitude to 
groups like the Nisei Veterans Legacy 
and the Military Intelligence Service 
Education Society of Hawaii, and oth-
ers, for keeping the 100th Battalion’s 
legacy alive. They have all been crit-
ical in recognizing the sacrifices of our 
Japanese Americans to defend a coun-
try that questioned their loyalty. 
On the walls of the National Japa-
nese American Memorial, not far from 
our U.S. Capitol, the late Senator 
Spark Matsunaga’s words still ring 
true today: ‘‘We believed a threat to 
this Nation’s democracy was a threat 
to the American Dream and to all free 
peoples of the world.’’ 
Today, we renew our debt of grati-
tude to the Japanese Americans of the 
One Puka Puka. May they live forever 
in our hearts and minds.

RECOGNIZING LINDSAY HOLCOMB, 
JR., ON HIS 88TH BIRTHDAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize and wish a happy 88th birth-
day to an exemplary North Carolinian, 
Lindsay Holcomb, Jr., of Winston- 
Salem, North Carolina. It has been my 
honor and pleasure to know Lindsay 
for nearly 30 years, and I understand 
what a remarkable man he truly is. 
After graduating from Duke Univer-
sity in under 4 years, he went on to 
serve in both the United States Army 
and National Guard. Later, he became 
president of Pine State Knitwear, a 
prominent 
textile 
manufacturer 
in 
Mount Airy, North Carolina. 
Additionally, he served on the Board 
of Trustees for Northern Surry Hos-
pital for three decades, and was chair-
man four of those years. 
That is an impressive resume. But 
there is more, much more to his story. 
He served in pivotal leadership roles 
within the community as well and 
showed his generosity in many ways. 
He and his late brother, Smith, fund-
ed a care wing at Arbor Acres, an inde-
pendent living community in Winston- 
Salem, in honor of their mother who 
suffered from dementia. They also do-
nated the waiting room in the Perry 
Clinic at Arbor Acres. 
He is the kind of person who would 
give the shirt off his back to help 
someone in need, and his service to 
others speaks volumes about his char-
acter. 
God bless you, Lindsay, and happy 
88th birthday. Here is to many more. 
RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF WILLIAM 
MORGAN, JR. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize 
William 
Morgan, 
Jr., 
of 
Statesville, North Carolina. For the 
last 81⁄2 years, he has served as a city 
council member and mayor pro tem of 
Statesville. In these two roles, he has 
excelled tremendously. 
I have had the pleasure of knowing 
William for many years, and there is 
no question about how dedicated he is 
to serving others.

forts, and record of accomplishments 
for the city of Statesville and its many

citizens has not gone unnoticed. Thank 
you for your service to our great State, 
and may God bless you and Tina as you 
enter this new chapter of your life. 
IT IS TIME TO RE-EDUCATE WASHINGTON 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, Wash-
ington needs to be re-educated on the 
meaning of ‘‘shall not be infringed.’’ 
The Second Amendment insulates 
the American people from the Federal 
Government exerting undue influence 
over them; otherwise known as in-
fringement. 
When the Federal Government acts 
in haste, the room for error is dras-
tically compounded; as is the case with 
the Democrat gun control bills that are 
before this very body. 
Let me be very clear: The horrific 
tragedies that occurred in Uvalde and 
Buffalo are truly heartbreaking. I con-
tinue to pray for our society and for 
the families of the men, women, and 
children who were senselessly mur-
dered. 
Before proposals are put on the table, 
however, this problem must be diag-
nosed in its entirety. 
The Supreme Court has recognized 
the right of individual citizens to keep 
and 
bear 
arms 
under 
the 
Second 
Amendment. 
Further, the Court specifically recog-
nizes that the inherent right to self-de-
fense is protected by the Second 
Amendment as well. 
A study conducted in 2013 estimated 
that firearms are used in defense from 
half a million to 3 million times annu-
ally. Americans exercise their Second 
Amendment rights when protecting 
their family and property. It was not 
written so that one could go hunting. 
As former Senator Tom Coburn once 
said, ‘‘It was to create a force to bal-
ance a tyrannical force here.’’ 
The Federal Government should not 
be in the business of issuing edicts that 
threaten the Second Amendment rights 
of Americans. It is a right that cannot 
be infringed. 
f 
GUN CONTROL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
the Virgin Islands (Ms. PLASKETT) for 5 
minutes. 
Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Speaker, I 
have shared before that my father was 
for many decades a New York City po-
lice officer. He had to carry a firearm 
to protect himself and others, but was 
acutely aware of individuals on the 
street, often with guns illegally, who 
could harm him and those he was 
tasked to protect. 
I do not oppose the right of American 
citizens to own guns, or intend to rob 
any constitutional rights. But, we all 
know that money, hatred, and power 
have used the Constitution to cover 
themselves from showing the real in-
tent that they have, the love of greed, 
desire for power, ignorance, racism, ha-
tred. That is what many are using that 
constitutional 
protection 
to 
cover 
themselves from. 
Over 50 percent of gun violence is at-
tributable to people who use handguns 
to commit suicide. The remainder of 
those deaths and injuries are largely 
homicide and murder, such as wide-
spread street crime. Then there are 
mass killings, which have been on an 
uptick in recent years. 
On May 24, in Texas, an 18-year old 
boy acted as a lone gunman in the sec-
ond 
deadliest 
school 
shooting 
on 
record. Armed with a semiautomatic 
rifle and 375 rounds of ammunition, he 
entered 
Robb 
Elementary 
School, 
opened fire, and laid waste to 19 chil-
dren and two teachers. The pervasive-
ness and regularity of such occurrences 
in the United States has reached epi-
demic levels. 
In 2020, 45,222 Americans died of gun- 
related injuries, more than any other 
year on record. That is a 14 percent in-
crease since 2019; a 25 percent increase 
since 2015; and a 43 percent increase 
since 2010. In this year alone, almost 
19,000 people have already lost their 
lives; a number, evidenced by the 
events of the past couple of weeks, are 
only on the rise. 
This weekend alone, over a dozen 
mass shootings took place: Buffalo, 
Texas, Philadelphia, South Carolina, 
Kentucky, Tennessee, Oklahoma, so 
many more. These mass killings are 
just the tip of the iceberg with respect 
to gun violence carnage in America. 
Firearms are the leading cause of 
death for children and teens in this Na-
tion. How many more children will be 
sacrificed before action is taken? How 
many more schools will we allow to be-
come battlefields and burial grounds 
for the sake of the cloak that many are 
using the Constitution for. 
The time for action is now. We know 
that our gun violence epidemic can be 
substantially curtailed with thought-
ful, reasonable commonsense gun legis-
lation. This includes raising the age, as 
we have done for so many things, for 
automatic purchases to 21, and devel-
oping and implementing more com-
prehensive background checks to pre-
vent situations like the Buffalo shoot-
ing and the Uvalde massacre. 
We need to strengthen gun laws for 
gun trafficking, which is devastating 
our country. Areas with strong gun 
laws cannot curtail the influx of illegal 
guns trafficked in from States with few 
restrictions. Places like New York City 
and Chicago cannot curtail the illegal 
weapons coming from other places. 
With higher unemployment rates, 
places like my home, the Virgin Is-
lands, has the second highest rate of 
guns smuggled across its borders and a 
homicide rate nine times higher than 
the 50 States. 
As well as better establishing and 
regulating gun storage to prevent mi-
nors from acquiring deadly weapons, it 
is necessary for Members on both sides 
of this debate to come together to pro-
tect the lives of our citizens. 
Throw off the cloak that you are 
using, 
calling our Constitution to 
hover and hide what you are really pro-
tecting: money, power, hatred.

RECOGNIZING STEVE MEINHAUSEN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. CLOUD) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CLOUD. Madam Speaker, today, 
I rise to recognize an extraordinary 
friend and great servant of the Texas 
27th 
Congressional 
District, 
Steve 
Meinhausen. 
Steve came to Texas in 2004 with his 
wife, Carrie, and four children: Mat-
thew, 
Makenna, 
Kacey, 
and 
Ellie. 
Steve and his family brought selfless 
hearts and an entrepreneurial spirit to 
our part of south Texas. 
Steve opened many businesses during 
his time, the most famous being Stevie 
Lew’s BBQ. In 2017, when Hurricane 
Harvey hit Rockport, among his many 
generous community endeavors, Steve 
graciously opened his restaurant to 
feed over 12,000 meals to volunteers and 
others in need. 
Steve has built for his family a leg-
acy of generosity, a sincere love of 
God, and a strong work ethic. I thank 
Steve for all he has done for the many 
people he has blessed in the Rockport- 
Fulton area. He is truly a servant of 
God and an exemplary citizen. 
It is my honor to recognize Steve for 
his outstanding service and dedication 
to family, to community, and to our 
Nation.

ENDING GUN VIOLENCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Minnesota (Ms. OMAR) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. OMAR. Madam Speaker, it has 
been 23 years since Columbine. It has 
been 15 years since Virginia Tech, 10 
years since Sandy Hook, 4 years since 
Parkland. We have offered prayer and 
thoughts for years with no real action. 
It has been 15 days since the school 
shooting in Uvalde, Texas, where 19 
children were massacred. One of the 
students, a 10-year-old girl, survived 
because she covered herself in the 
blood of her dead classmate. 
We have trained kids to hide under 
their tables. We have trained teachers 
to barricade their doors. We have 
trained schools to lock down their 
campuses. Now, are we going to train 
kids to cover themselves with their 
friend’s blood in order to survive? 
When are we going to understand the 
common denominator here is not just 
criminals but making it easy for crimi-
nals to access deadly weapons? 
Australia, New Zealand, the United 
Kingdom, and Canada all dealt with 
mass shootings, but there was a na-
tional outcry, and they put in place re-
strictions to stop mass carnage from 
happening again. 
We don’t have mental health issues 
more than any other country. What we 
do have here are politicians who lack 
the moral courage to stand up to the 
NRA. We have a society that is not 
willing to stand up to protect its citi-
zens, especially its most vulnerable,

which is our beautiful children. We 
have to be better than that. 
We also must remember, Madam 
Speaker, it is not just mass shootings. 
It is white supremacists in Buffalo who 
massacre elders. It is gangs who car-
nage our neighborhoods, who allow for 
a 3-year-old in my district to get 
mowed down by gunfire. 
The problem is guns. The problem is 
our colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle. We have to have the courage to 
stand up to them and to stand up for 
our country. 
PROTECTING INDIVIDUAL FREEDOMS 
Ms. OMAR. Madam Speaker, Roe v. 
Wade is fundamentally about privacy. 
Fifty, 60, 70 years ago, in order for 
women to access abortion care, they 
had to go to back-alley clinics and use 
wire hangers. 
In 1973, it was decided that women 
have a right to make their own deci-
sions about their bodies. We have to be 
a country that refuses to go back. We 
have to be a country that refuses to 
have women in my generation and the 
generation before enjoy more freedoms 
than my daughter’s generation and the 
next. 
Republicans will say they are the 
party of freedom and liberty, but they 
are the party that doesn’t believe in 
liberty and freedom for women. Demo-
crats are the party that is protecting 
your freedom and expanding liberty, 
which is why we introduced and passed 
the Women’s Health Protection Act be-
cause codifying Roe v. Wade into law is 
essentially about protecting the free-
doms for individuals to make their own 
private 
decisions 
about 
their 
healthcare. 
If you stand for freedom, if you stand 
for liberty, join us and reject an ex-
tremist, fascist, misogynistic, back-
ward party that wants to take us back 
to the stone age where men dictated 
what women do with their bodies. Help 
us exist in a country where our values 
of uplifting and advancing the rights of 
individuals still stand. 
RAMPANT FOOD INSECURITY 
Ms. OMAR. Madam Speaker, one in 
six children in the United States 
doesn’t have enough food to eat. It is 
unconscionable that we allow 16 per-
cent of our children here in this coun-
try to go hungry. 
Right now, MITCH
MCCONNELL
and 
Republicans are blocking funding to 
continue the school waivers that allow 
for children to continue to eat in 
schools. Our inability to get these 
waivers and feed millions of children 
who are food insecure is inexcusable. 
Globally, there are 276 million people 
facing 
food 
insecurity 
around 
the 
world, with countries in the Horn of 
Africa teetering on the edge of famine. 
We have an opportunity to get people 
on board and rally around those who 
are in need and starving. 
HONORING THE LEGACY OF CAROL 
MARTINEAU BALDWIN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. KATKO) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Carol 
Martineau Baldwin, who passed away 
on May 26, 2022, at the age of 92. 
Carol was a beloved member of the 
central New York community and a de-
voted philanthropist. 
A Syracuse native, Carol met her 
husband, Alexander Baldwin, while at-
tending 
Syracuse 
University. 
They 
were married in 1954 and had six chil-
dren. 
The family lived in Long Island, 
where Alexander taught at Massapequa 
High School until his death from lung 
cancer in 1983. Carol moved back to 
Syracuse and, in 1990, was diagnosed 
with breast cancer. She nearly lost her 
battle with breast cancer but overcame 
it following a double mastectomy. 
Following this experience, she dedi-
cated her life to helping others fight 
breast cancer. In 1996, she founded the 
Carol M. Baldwin Breast Cancer Re-
search Fund on the campus of SUNY 
Stony Brook. Five years later, in con-
junction with SUNY Upstate Medical 
University, the Carol M. Baldwin Fund 
of Central New York was established in 
Syracuse. 
To date, the Baldwin fund has pro-
vided more than 60 grants to support 
research programs and has spurred 
nearly $24 million in additional grant 
funding. The fund supports numerous 
programs, including studies of contrib-
uting factors to breast cancer, edu-
cation of medical professionals and the 
general public, and studies of the out-
comes of detection and treatment on 
patients and families. 
Outside of her philanthropic work, 
Carol has been a prominent fixture in 
our community, and many in her fam-
ily are dear friends to my wife, Robin, 
and me. 
For the last two decades, breast can-
cer patients in central New York and 
throughout the country have benefited 
from the steadfast commitment of 
Carol Baldwin. 
Carol is survived by her six children, 
25 grandchildren, and 14 great-grand-
children. While she will be dearly 
missed in our community, central New 
Yorkers will continue to honor her leg-
acy. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my col-
leagues in the House join me in hon-
oring the life and legacy of Carol 
Martineau Baldwin. May she rest in 
peace. 
f 
PREVENTING GUN VIOLENCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Mrs. CHERFILUS-MCCORMICK) 
for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. 
CHERFILUS-MCCORMICK. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 7910, the Protecting Our Kids 
Act. 
As we all know by now, on May 24, 21 
children and teachers were senselessly 
murdered in Uvalde, Texas. Just 10 
days earlier, 10 Black people were 
killed in a racially motivated hate 
crime. 
For decades, the epidemic of gun vio-
lence has gripped this country, depriv-
ing Americans of their neighbors, sib-
lings, children, and friends. On average, 
over 38,000 people die from gun violence 
every year in this country, including, 
on average, over 1,600 children. That is 
roughly an average of five kids every 
day. 
Think about that: Five children 
being murdered, committing suicide, or 
being killed by the unintentional dis-
charge of a weapon every day in Amer-
ica. 
I do not pretend that this bill will 
save every one of those children or stop 
racially motivated murder in our Na-
tion, but the idea that we simply stand 
back and do nothing and expect this 
problem to resolve itself is nonsense. 
It offends the tens of thousands of 
gun violence victims every year, their 
families, and communities that are 
ravaged by unending tragedy. We can 
and we must take steps, meaningful 
steps, to reduce gun violence. 
This bill will restrict the sale of as-
sault-style weapons to those over the 
age of 21 years old. It will close long-
standing and dangerous loopholes in 
Federal law, require that firearms sold 
in the United States be traceable, and 
help prevent gun trafficking, among 
other steps. These are measured, com-
monsense, and widely supported meas-
ures that would help reduce gun vio-
lence in our country. 
As an American, as a Congress-
woman, and as a mother of two chil-
dren, I implore the Members of the 
House and the Senate to pass this bill. 
I am pleading with this Congress to set 
aside partisanship, dogma, and reflex-
ive bickering. Now is the time to come 
together and act in unison to end the 
violence in our schools and on our 
streets.

RECOGNIZING KOREAN WAR 
VETERANS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
New York (Ms. MALLIOTAKIS) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize veterans of 
the Korean war as this month marks 
the 72nd anniversary of the war’s be-
ginning. 
Sadly, the Korean war is too often re-
ferred to as the forgotten war. I am 
here today to recognize the 5.7 million 
American men and women who served 
in that war, along with seven Korean 
war veterans our community lost in 
the past year: Albert A. Fowler, Ralph 
M. Lanza, Thomas H. O’Rourke, Nich-
olas J. Matranga, Walter H. Zipf, Rob-
ert Klose, and Hermando J. Folla. 
These veterans put their lives on the 
line to defend our Nation and to fight

communism, and we are forever grate-
ful for their service. 
This past weekend, I joined the Cor-
poral Allan Kivlehan Chapter of the 
Korean War Veterans Association and 
local members of the Korean-American 
community to honor them. 
b 1045 
Last year, I also honored the life and 
legacy of Private First Class Raymond 
Andrew Smith as his remains returned 
to Brooklyn 71 years after he was re-
ported missing in action. 
While the return of Raymond’s re-
mains is something to be celebrated, 
our Nation must not forget that more 
than 81,600 Americans remain missing 
from World War II, the Korean war, the 
Vietnam war, the Cold War, the Gulf 
war, and other conflicts. 
On Monday, the anniversary of D- 
day, I was honored to receive a POW/ 
MIA Chair of Honor from our local 
Rolling Thunder chapter to display in 
my office as a permanent tribute to the 
brave men and women who honorably 
served our Nation overseas, but sadly 
never made it home. 
I urge my colleagues to consider 
doing the same because we all must do 
more as a grateful Nation to raise at-
tention to this issue and diligently 
work to return all prisoners of war and 
soldiers missing in action back to our 
homeland. 
f 
PRIORITIZING THE SAFETY OF 
OUR CHILDREN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Ms. SLOTKIN) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today almost exactly 6 months after 
the shooting at Oxford High School in 
Oxford, Michigan, in my district. I rep-
resent 
Michigan’s 
Eighth 
District, 
which includes Ingham County, Living-
ston County, and north Oakland Coun-
ty. Over the past couple of weeks, I 
have been in meetings with survivors 
and local officials. There are few issues 
that link our urban areas to our subur-
ban areas to our rural areas more than 
gun violence. 
I also represent the east side of Lan-
sing, Michigan, where, just in the past 
week, we have had gun violence be-
tween three young people. And I also 
represent Oxford, where 6 months ago 
we had the school shooting, the most 
recent school shooting before Uvalde, 
Texas. 
I happened to be scheduled to speak 
at the Oxford Virtual Academy gradua-
tion, in-person graduation, the day 
after the Uvalde shooting. I spent the 
day in Oxford, as I have been doing 
about every month, and you could hear 
the pain that people felt in being re-
traumatized by watching what was 
going on in Uvalde. 
The students who I was speaking to 
were a group of students who chose to 
join school virtually, many of them in 
the aftermath of the shooting. I had 
been with the Superintendent of Oxford 
Schools earlier in the day. He was one 
of the very first people on the scene 
helping to provide first aid to the 
young people that we lost. We talked 
about the trauma and retrauma that 
sets in in communities where gun vio-
lence happens again and again. 
I may have a different angle on this 
issue than most. Guns and firearms are 
part of our culture in the State of 
Michigan. I grew up with guns. I re-
member very distinctly getting a four- 
wheeler along with my brother when I 
was 11, and my dad installing the gun 
racks when I was 12 so that my brother 
and I could go out shooting during the 
day. 
I am a CIA officer who was trained on 
a Glock and an M4 semiautomatic for 
my three tours in Iraq alongside the 
military. My husband is a career Army 
officer and carried a weapon every day 
he was deployed. It is just something 
that is normal among the 99 percent of 
responsible gun owners in the State of 
Michigan. 
It is because of that background that 
I fundamentally reject this idea that 
either you care about gun ownership, 
or you care about school safety. That 
is a fundamentally false choice. 
In Michigan, as I said, we have re-
sponsible 
gun 
owners 
everywhere. 
Since the shooting, I have heard from 
more of them in the past 2 weeks than 
I have in the previous 4 years; active 
hunters and sportsmen who are strong-
ly in favor of things like commonsense 
background checks so that mentally ill 
people don’t get their hands on weap-
ons, and certainly things like safe stor-
age of weapons so that a child can’t get 
ahold of a parent’s weapon and use it 
to kill their peers. 
I have a bill that is going in this 
package today in the House. Safe Guns, 
Safe Kids Act is the name of it. It is 
part of protecting our kids in a serious, 
commonsense way. All it says is that if 
you are an adult and you have a fire-
arm in the house, and you also have 
children, you have to take reasonable 
steps to secure that weapon, and if the 
child gets ahold of that weapon and 
uses it to commit a crime, like mass 
murder, you can be criminally liable 
for that crime. 
The bill doesn’t impact your decision 
to buy a gun. Instead, it asks that you 
act responsibly when you have it. This 
is not controversial. It is not partisan. 
It is basic common sense and what 
most people do anyway, just like my 
dad. Personal responsibility is at the 
heart of what it means to be an Amer-
ican, and gun owners have a critical 
role to play in making sure we can pro-
tect our communities. 
While the provisions that the House 
will approve today are commonsense 
measures, I have no illusion on how 
partisan this is going to be. I know how 
much the gun lobby has sway with my 
peers, and I know that straight-up, 
selfish interest in being reelected is 
guiding my colleagues in this Chamber. 
But I encourage my friends on both 
sides of the aisle to prioritize public 
health and public safety over political 
concerns. 
Anything that we pass here in the 
House will need support in the Senate 
to become law, so we want more of our 
Republican colleagues to join with us. 
We want more brave individuals to 
cross the aisle and say: I am going to 
do something about the thing that is 
now the number one killer of young 
people in America. It is gun violence. It 
is not car accidents. It is not drug 
overdoses, and it is not cancer. It is 
gun violence. 
To my friends who are considering 
how to vote on some of the provisions 
today, I encourage you to make a 
choice. Do you care about dealing with 
the leading cause of death of young 
people or not? I urge you to join us. 
f 
WE NEED RELIEF 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Michigan (Mr. WALBERG) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. 
WALBERG. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
when President Biden took office, the 
price of a gallon of gas stood at $2.39 a 
gallon. Today, the national average is 
more than double, clocking in at $4.96 
per gallon. 
Since the beginning of the travel sea-
son, gas prices have reached a new 
record high every single day. The situ-
ation in my home State of Michigan is 
even more dire and unaffordable. In the 
past week, gas prices spiked more in 
Michigan, the motor capital of the 
world, than any other State. Our State 
average has skyrocketed up to $5.21. 
In Jackson, in my district, gas prices 
rose 20 cents overnight last week. In 
Lenawee County, my home county, 
they rose at an even quicker rate to 
$5.29, when I drove to the airport yes-
terday morning. Michigan families are 
struggling to pay these historic prices 
at the pump. 
Robert from Tecumseh, Michigan, 
told me that he along with many other 
seniors on a fixed income are simply 
unable to use their cars because of the 
price of gas. 
Another constituent wrote to me 
that someone drilled a hole in their 
truck’s gas tank and stole their gas. 
This is the environment that Presi-
dent Biden’s antienergy policies have 
created. Since day one, the Biden ad-
ministration has been hostile to Amer-
ican energy. They canceled the Key-
stone XL pipeline. They halted oil and 
gas leases on Federal lands. They reck-
lessly depleted our strategic reserves, 
which is now at its lowest level since 
1987. They have done everything pos-
sible to discourage investment in do-
mestic production. 
At the same time, the administration 
continues to beg Saudi Arabia and 
other foreign countries to boost their 
oil supply. It simply makes no sense. 
In Congress, just one side—House Re-
publicans—has been proposing solu-
tions. We should pass the American En-
ergy Independence from Russia Act to 
unleash our domestic production capa-
bility.

We should pass the Strategic Produc-
tion Response Act to transition supply 
concerns from stopgap measures to per-
manent production solutions. 
And we should pass the PIPES Act, 
which I introduced, to prevent a sitting 
President from unilaterally attacking 
existing domestic energy infrastruc-
ture. 
Let’s not forget: America was energy 
independent just 2 short years ago. 
There is a path to regaining that inde-
pendence and bringing down prices at 
the pump if President Biden will re-
verse course and flip the switch on 
American energy. 
My constituents cannot afford $5-plus 
per gallon of gas. They need relief. We 
need relief. America needs relief, and 
fast. 
f 
ADDRESSING GUN VIOLENCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. COSTA) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, gun vi-
olence, as we know, is plaguing our Na-
tion. In 2022, this year, there have al-
ready been 200 mass shootings in the 
United States. Think about that. It is 
absolutely horrific. 
We ask ourselves, when is enough 
enough? 
Our constituents across the country 
ask us, how many more innocent peo-
ple must die before any reasonable, 
commonsense gun reform legislation 
can pass and add more protection for 
the American public? 
Let’s pass the Protecting Our Kids 
Act, which raises the purchasing age 
for semiautomatic weapons from 18 to 
21, a commonsense idea. Let’s also deal 
with the subject of ghost gun purchases 
and background checks. Again, com-
monsense ideas, and cracks down on 
gun trafficking and straw purchases. 
If the combination of the Protecting 
Our Kids Act is something that you 
might find objectionable in some in-
stance, we have individual pieces of 
legislation, resources for victims of 
gun violence, bipartisan background 
checks, assault weapons ban, legisla-
tion that would also go further to pro-
vide protection in condemning the hor-
rific shootings in Atlanta, Georgia, and 
dealing with hate, bigotry, and vio-
lence against Asian-American and Pa-
cific-Islander communities. 
We also have legislation that would 
designate June 4th National Gun Vio-
lence Awareness Day. There is legisla-
tion that deals with disarming of hate, 
and to try to provide extreme risk pro-
tection for Federal firearms sales to in-
clude those who are subject to extreme 
risk protection that we know red-flag 
legislation 
would 
help 
protect 
us 
against. 
So, there are a lot of things we can 
do. Will we totally eliminate the 
threats to the public? Of course not. 
But there are commonsense ideas we 
can do to improve and increase safety 
for our schools, for our churches, and 
for people who are just going to shop 
for groceries one afternoon. These are 
things we can do, and we should do. 
As chair of the Congressional Crime 
Survivors and Justice Caucus, I am ad-
vocating for resources for survivors of 
gun violence to cope with their trau-
ma, whether it be in Sacramento or 
Fresno or anywhere else around this 
country. 
I support the Second Amendment for 
responsible gun ownership. Let that be 
clear. But America deserves better, and 
I call on all House Members to join me 
in this effort. Let’s put partisanship 
aside and take action to address the 
gun epidemic once and for all. 
Madam Speaker, how much time do I 
have remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 2 minutes remaining. 
CELEBRATING DIA DE PORTUGAL 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today also to celebrate Dia de Por-
tugal, which is a significant holiday for 
Portuguese people all over the world. 
My grandparents came to the United 
States from the Azore Islands in the 
late 19th century and the turn of the 
20th century, 1897 to 1904. Illiterate, 
non-English speaking, like immigrants 
past and immigrants present, coming 
to America to have a better life for 
themselves. But they never, ever left 
their pride of their home country, Por-
tugal, or their sense of culture, which 
lives in me today. 
Portugal is one of America’s longest 
and strongest allies, as it was the first 
to recognize the United States as an 
independent Nation after the Revolu-
tionary War. 
I am proud to be an original cospon-
sor of the AMIGOS Act, introduced by 
our colleague and Congressman DAVID 
CICILLINE. It would create more Amer-
ican jobs and increase investment in 
the United States by strengthening our 
bonds with Portugal. As the co-chair of 
the Portuguese Caucus, I think it is 
important that we continue to build on 
this relationship and the trade that al-
ready exists today. 
I urge the Senate to pass this bipar-
tisan legislation and, again, we will 
continue to work with other colleagues 
of ours who are part of our Portuguese- 
American Caucus to continue to advo-
cate for mutual interests, not only for 
Portugal but for the United States and 
the Portuguese-American community. 
‘‘Happy Portugal Day.’’ ‘‘Feliz Dia de 
Portugal.’’ 
Let us celebrate and let us remember 
that America is a stronger country be-
cause of our welcoming of immigrants 
past and present, and this is a part of 
that recognition.

FARM BILL IMPACT SERIES 
NUMBER 10: RURAL DEVELOPMENT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Kansas (Mr. MANN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. MANN. Madam Speaker, in prep-
aration for reauthorizing the farm bill 
in 2023, I rise today to deliver the tenth 
installment of my farm bill impact se-
ries where I am highlighting various 
aspects of the farm bill that deserve 
this Congress’ awareness and support. 
Rural Development programs exist 
within the farm bill because the people 
of rural America, many of whom work 
to feed, fuel, and clothe us all, must re-
main connected to their families, local 
communities, and the world to do their 
jobs. 
Communities are made up of fami-
lies, and families in rural areas need 
well-built affordable housing in order 
to thrive. USDA Rural Development’s 
Single Family Housing Programs en-
able families and individuals to buy, 
build, or repair affordable homes lo-
cated in rural America. Through these 
programs, qualifying individuals can fi-
nance a new home with no money down 
or get financial assistance to repair 
their wells, hookups to rural water, 
septic, plumbing, heating, air-condi-
tioning, and electrical systems, insula-
tion, and storm shelters or safe rooms. 
USDA Rural Development is also 
committed to helping improve the 
economy and quality of life in rural 
America, and every strong community 
needs strong local businesses. The 
Business and Industry Loan Guarantee 
program improves the economic health 
of rural communities by increasing ac-
cess to business capital through loan 
guarantees, as well as enabling com-
mercial lenders to provide affordable 
financing to rural businesses. 
In Healy, Kansas, the Sharp Brothers 
Seed Company has sold native grass 
seeds since 1958. They needed addi-
tional working capital to build up their 
inventory for a Conservation Reserve 
Program enrollment, so they used the 
USDA Rural Development Business and 
Industry program to secure a $5 million 
guaranteed loan for additional working 
capital. This program helped make 
their operation stronger than ever be-
fore, which is good for rural Kansas. 
Finally, 
strengthening 
rural 
broadband will help ensure that rural 
Americans, agricultural producers in-
cluded, can keep pace with an increas-
ingly tech-driven society and inter-
national marketplace. I believe that 
taxpayer dollars must be spent judi-
ciously on existing broadband pro-
grams, and the goals set by the USDA 
and the FCC must be realistic. 
Last summer, the House Agriculture 
Committee advanced the Broadband 
Internet Connections for Rural Amer-
ica Act out of committee, which au-
thorizes $43 billion toward critical in-
frastructure in rural communities. I 
also joined several of my House Repub-
lican colleagues and introduced legisla-
tion that would leverage the ReCon-
nect program with some of the 2018 
rural broadband investments in rural 
areas with little or no internet access. 
The ReConnect program is an exam-
ple of a successful public-private part-
nership. Its matching grants help cover 
the cost of cable, implementation, and 
installment for broadband in rural

communities. I support whatever di-
rectly benefits the resilient people of 
rural America, because they are the 
lifeblood of this country. That is why I 
support the Rural Development pro-
grams within the farm bill, and why I 
am bringing awareness to them now to 
ensure that these programs remain 
strong in the 2023 farm bill. 
I will be back to the floor soon to de-
liver another installment of my farm 
bill impact series and highlight more 
programs and titles within the bill that 
I believe Congress must understand and 
support to ensure that agriculture and 
rural America thrives in this country. 
CONGRATULATING DALE MOORE ON HIS 
RETIREMENT 
Mr. MANN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize a great Kansan, 
Dale Moore, and to congratulate him 
on his retirement from a career of dedi-
cated service to farmers, ranchers, and 
agricultural producers. 
Dale grew up on a livestock, hay, and 
grain farm in Copeland, Kansas, which 
lies in my district, the Big First of 
Kansas. He went to Fort Hays State 
University, worked for Kansas Pork 
Producers 
Council, 
the 
National 
Cattlemen’s Beef Association, and Sen-
ator Pat Roberts. 
In 2001, President Bush appointed 
Dale to serve as chief of staff at USDA, 
after which he served as legislative di-
rector for the House Agriculture Com-
mittee. Most recently, Dale has been 
serving as executive vice president at 
the American Farm Bureau Federation 
where his presence will be deeply 
missed. 
Dale has tirelessly advocated for ag-
riculture for more than 40 years, and 
he never forgot his southwest Kansas 
roots or the values he learned there: 
hard work, others before self, and per-
sonal responsibility. 
I am grateful for Dale’s leadership 
and service, and I offer him, his wife, 
Faith, and their entire family my best 
wishes as they begin this new adven-
ture. 
Congratulations, Dale. 
f 
COMMONSENSE GUN SAFETY 
REFORM 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. VEASEY) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. VEASEY. Madam Speaker, I pose 
a few questions to my friends and col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle. 
You certainly cannot be okay with 
criminals continuously being able to 
access guns. 
You can’t be okay with terrorists 
being able to buy guns. 
You can’t be okay with sociopaths 
continuing to buy guns. 
You certainly can’t be okay with 
what has happened in Uvalde; before 
that, Buffalo; what just happened in 
Tulsa, Sandy Hook, Parkland. 
So if you are not okay with that, why 
the inaction? Why do you continue to 
prevent commonsense gun safety legis-
lation that would stop sociopaths, ter-
rorists, and criminals from obtaining 
weapons? Why don’t you work with us 
to pass commonsense legislation that, 
in many cases, over 90 percent of the 
public supports? 
So many gun owners that I have 
talked to all across north Texas, people 
that are on the opposite end of the po-
litical spectrum to me, tell me that 
they support this commonsense gun 
safety legislation. 
You continue to show inaction to the 
American public. It is unacceptable. 
We have got to do better. We have an 
opportunity to get something done this 
time around, and it is about time. The 
American public is sick of seeing noth-
ing occur every time one of these mas-
sacres takes place in our country. 
Madam Speaker, I urge our Repub-
lican colleagues to work with us on 
passing legislation that is long overdue 
and that the public is asking for. We 
can’t continue to watch this happen 
and do nothing. We need to take ac-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair. 
f 
MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS IN OUR 
NATION 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. TONY GONZALES) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. TONY GONZALES of Texas. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to raise 
awareness for the severe mental health 
crisis in our country. 
Two weeks ago, there was a terrible 
incident 
that 
occurred 
in 
Uvalde, 
Texas; 19 innocent children were mur-
dered and two of their teachers along-
side them. Uvalde is in my district, 
Texas’ 23rd District. 
Over a year ago, after I got elected, I 
visited Uvalde and I sat down with the 
county judge, who is a Democrat, and 
the mayor, who is a Republican, and 
the local sheriff. I sat down with them, 
and I said, If I could do one thing, what 
would that be, gentlemen? And they 
go: Tony, we need a mental health hos-
pital. 
They identified this crisis over a year 
ago. Last year, we appropriated over $2 
million toward that hospital. It is a 
$25-million project, and I am working 
on the remaining $23 million to get 
that over the finish line. This is some-
thing that that community asked for. 
There is so much division here in 
Congress. There is so much hate and 
rhetoric that gets spewed. I think men-
tal health is an area that can bring us 
together, that can unite us as we go 
forward, not only as we reflect on what 
happened in Uvalde, but across the 
country. 
COVID did something to this coun-
try. We are coming out of that, and I 
think part of the mental health crisis 
that is going on in our country has to 
be addressed. It is heartbreaking to see 
what happened, to be there as the 
Uvalde community heals and comes to-
gether. What I will say is, this mental 
health crisis goes beyond those that 
are looking to cause harm to them-
selves and others. 
Madam Speaker, I would argue every-
one in that community needs to sit 
down with a mental health provider; 
my staff, included. Our team essen-
tially had turned into a mini FEMA of-
fice where we were answering all kinds 
of different claims every day and hav-
ing to hear these horrendous stories 
and having to hear the issues that our 
community was dealing with. 
So this crisis is very deep and it is 
very sad. It is an issue that this body 
needs to address. It needs to start early 
on, not wait until when an incident oc-
curs. We have to start very early on. 
This shooter, this gunman, was a trou-
bled young man for a very long time. It 
was no surprise to a lot of people what 
occurred. If we could have got ahead of 
the issue instead of waiting until the 
problem happened, I think that is crit-
ical. 
Another thing a lot of people don’t 
realize, the day of the shooting, there 
was actually a young lady that had sui-
cide ideations, and two of the local law 
enforcement officers had taken her to 
San Antonio. This was hours before the 
shooting. 
What does that mean? That means 
the community of Uvalde has a very 
deep mental health issue that is pop-
ping up every single day. And Uvalde 
isn’t unique. It isn’t just this one small 
town and this one incident. We have 
seen it happen all over the country. 
Madam Speaker, I urge this body to 
come together. I urge Congress to come 
together and use this terrible incident 
to unite us in finding real, tangible so-
lutions. Part of those solutions is iden-
tifying mental health resources which 
we can provide directly to the commu-
nities of need.

BABY FORMULA SHORTAGE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. ROSE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, in late 
April and early May when parents and 
Republicans 
in 
Congress 
began 
to 
sound the alarm about the unaccept-
able 
scarcity 
of 
baby 
formula, 
I 
thought to myself, Well, this is just an-
other example of the compounding ef-
fect of the bad policies of the Biden ad-
ministration. 
But at the time, the facts had not 
come to light that the crisis is yet an-
other direct result of the mismanage-
ment and misguided Biden Presidency; 
a President focused on a woke, progres-
sive agenda, while the basic functions 
of government are neglected or mis-
managed. 
The most critical fact that has come 
to light is that Abbott Nutrition’s 
Sturgis plant supplied about one-fifth, 
20 percent, of all infant formula in the 
United States before it closed. Further-
more, the company makes the majority 
of the formula for infants in the

Women, Infants, and Children program. 
That is more than 43 percent of babies 
in 
the 
United 
States. 
It 
is 
unfathomable that a facility this crit-
ical to the lives of our Nation’s 
newborns can somehow slip through 
the cracks. 
As of this past weekend, I am glad to 
see that the Sturgis plant is making 
formula again, but it could take a cou-
ple of months for supply to hit store 
shelves. Currently, the Nation’s cur-
rent out-of-stock rate is 74 percent. In 
Tennessee, it is 92 percent. This is in-
deed a worst-case scenario for parents 
and their vulnerable infant children. 
How did we get here? Let’s go 
through the timeline. 
In September of 2019, inspectors 
found a handful of sanitary issues with 
the plant in Sturgis but allowed man-
agers to continue operating while they 
implemented necessary changes. 
Due to the COVID–19 pandemic, the 
FDA conducted its first routine inspec-
tion of the Abbott Sturgis plant in 2 
years in September of 2021. They found 
that the issues uncovered in the 2019 
surveillance inspection had been re-
solved. At about the same time, in Sep-
tember 2021, the FDA receives the first 
complaint that a child was hospitalized 
with Cronobacter. Meanwhile, the Na-
tion’s out-of-stock rate for infant for-
mula rose to 11 percent in November of 
2021, when Dr. Robert Califf was nomi-
nated to serve as commissioner of the 
FDA. 
December 1, the FDA received a sec-
ond complaint related to the death of a 
child. The Centers for Disease Control 
determined that Cronobacter could 
have been a contributing factor. 
In January of this year, the FDA re-
ceives their third complaint of a child 
hospitalized with Cronobacter, while at 
the same time The New York Times re-
ports that baby formula shortages are, 
‘‘worsening 
throughout 
the 
United 
States.’’ 
On January 31, the FDA begins a de-
layed follow-up inspection of the Ab-
bott Sturgis plant. Thirteen days later, 
the nationwide out-of-stock rate of in-
fant formula rises to 26 percent. Two 
days later, on February 15, Dr. Robert 
Califf is confirmed by the U.S. Senate 
as the new commissioner of the FDA. 
Two days after that, on the commis-
sioner’s second day on the job, Abbott 
announces a voluntary recall and hold 
of certain powdered infant formulas 
produced at the Sturgis plant. The 
same day, the FDA receives a fourth 
Cronobacter complaint. 
Why does this timeline matter? Be-
cause President Biden said he wasn’t 
made aware of the issues with the 
stock of baby formula until late April. 
Now just imagine, on your second 
day on the job, a fire breaks out in 
your office, and you don’t call the 
President to let him know? I don’t un-
derstand. I truly don’t. 
Again, this plant produces one-fifth 
of the Nation’s supply of baby formula. 
The crisis was foreseeable and extraor-
dinary steps should have been taken to 
avoid it. There is no doubt in my mind 
that the February formula recall fol-
lowed by the Sturgis plant closure is 
the primary factor that turned an al-
ready increasing problem into a crisis. 
There should have been more ur-
gency. It should have been clear to the 
Biden administration in February that 
we were going to have a problem. 
Maybe it was and they just didn’t want 
to tell the President, or maybe he was 
busy that day. Who knows. I am sure 
we will find out when Republicans take 
back the majority and conduct proper 
oversight of this administration. 
Put simply, the FDA and President 
Biden fumbled the ball for months, and 
families across this country are paying 
the price. We cannot afford for this ad-
ministration to take its eye off the ball 
again. The President must do better.

CELEBRATING 
THE 
SESQUI-
CENTENNIAL 
CELEBRATION 
OF 
ENNIS, TEXAS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. ELLZEY) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. ELLZEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the sesquicentennial 
celebration of the city of Ennis, Texas, 
founded on June 8, 1872. 
When the railroad was expanded from 
Houston to St. Louis in 1872, many of 
the workers found solace and commu-
nity in what we know today as Ennis. 
The railroad workers were drawn to 
the area’s bluebonnets and cotton 
fields. The appreciation for the natural 
beauty that surrounds this Texas town 
still runs deep in the community. 
Through the years, Ennis has grown 
as an agricultural and industrial com-
munity, attracting residents and visi-
tors, which has earned it the title of 
the ‘‘Official Bluebonnet City’’ of our 
State. 
Ennis is known for more than just its 
bluebonnets. It is also the hosting city 
of the National Polka Festival. The 
National Polka Festival began in 1967 
and attracts as many as 50,000 people to 
the town. 
Ennis is also home to the Texas 
Motorplex, where national records have 
been set and speed milestones have 
been broken. My family and I have 
been able to witness some truly re-
markable races there. 
It is places like these that make 
Texas proud. The events and venues of 
Ennis, Texas proudly promote Texas 
values by providing a family atmos-
phere and cultivating community out-
reach. 
Strolling along the historic district 
of Ennis, one can experience plentiful 
restaurants 
and 
shopping 
options. 
When entering any store, you are kind-
ly greeted. Families and neighbors wel-
come each other with open arms. The 
hospitality of Ennis is seen through 
these interactions, and it becomes evi-
dent why the citizens of Ennis take so 
much pride in their town. 
Ennis has encompassed many of our 
Texan values, including community 
and family, and has shown Texas pride 
for the past 150 years. I am proud and 
honored to represent the people of 
Ennis in the Sixth Congressional Dis-
trict of Texas. I look forward to what 
the next 150 years brings to the great 
city of Ennis.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
God of peace and author of our salva-
tion, we pause in prayer to You for the 
ongoing 
conflict 
overwhelming 
the 
country of Ukraine and terrorizing its 
people. After over 100 days of fighting, 
O Lord, the people cry to You for deliv-
erance. 
We pray to You on their behalf as 
their voices grow weak with exhaus-
tion, their hope dim with each passing 
hour of unrelenting adversity. 
God, You are their refuge and their 
strength. Do not delay Your salvation 
from them. You are their ever-present 
help in time of trouble. Do not deny 
them the strength of Your abiding spir-
it. 
Though the Earth gives way to the 
aggression of their foe, give them rea-
son not to fear. Though the seas are en-
snared with the adversary’s worst in-
tentions, send Your spirit to brood over 
these waters and disrupt their chaotic 
plans and bring the order of Your 
peace. 
May Ukraine bear witness to Your 
promises. God, You are within her, she 
will not fall. God, You will help her at 
break of day. Lord Almighty, You are 
with them. You are their fortress. 
We pray with Ukraine by the power 
of Your sovereign name. 
Amen.

GUN REFORM 
(Mr. PHILLIPS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Madam Speaker, Jim 
Ramstad 
represented 
Minnesota’s 
Third District in Congress as a prin-
cipled Republican from 1991 to 2009. 
His widow, Kathryn, a remarkable 
woman in her own right, wrote me last 
week and asked that I share her mes-
sage with the country: ‘‘Jim voted for 
the 1994 crime bill and its gun control 
measures. He was one of only six Re-
publicans to cast what was clearly a 
difficult vote, but he felt so strongly 
about the compelling need to act and 
believed it was consistent with his bi-
partisan, pragmatic, and commonsense 
approach to fighting crime. 
‘‘After so many mass shootings, I 
cannot understand why Congress does 
not at the very least,’’ she wrote, ‘‘ban 
semiautomatic weapons like the AR–15 
that have been used in so many recent 
mass shootings.’’ 
She continued, ‘‘I feel very strongly 
about this and ask sincerely, what can 
we do to legislate reasonable legisla-
tion like in 1994?’’ 
What can she do? She asks; she and 
the country ask, I might add. 
We all know what we can do. And I 
say, let’s do it.

CONGRATULATING MASTER 
SERGEANT SILVERINE JAMES 
(Mr. CLINE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate retired Army 
Master Sergeant Silverine James on 
the naming of the Salem VA Medical 
Center’s Women’s Health Clinic in her 
honor. 
Allowed to enlist by her mother, 
James joined the Army in 1949 and, 
after leaving in 1951, she eventually re-
turned to the service in 1953 as an ad-
ministrative specialist at the New 
York Point of Embarkation. 
Though the Army was still seg-
regated at the time of her rejoining, 
Mrs. James was given an assignment 
that would help lead to the integration 
of her company and later was a trail-
blazer while serving at Camp Zama in 
Japan as the only African American in 
the Judge Advocate General section of 
the Far East Command. 
By the time she retired in 1973, Mas-
ter Sergeant James had completed 22 
years of service. Taking a well-de-
served year off after retirement, James 
began a job at the Salem VA, where she 
spent nearly 5 years before taking a job 
with FEMA. 
In an article chronicling her life, 
Master Sergeant James said simply, ‘‘I 
gave my country the best part of my 
life.’’ 
It was great to be with Mrs. James 
last week to name the center in her 
honor. She surely did give the VA the 
best part of her life and her country 
the best part of her life. 
Congratulations 
on 
this 
well-de-
served honor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5347 
June 8, 2022 
Mr. LIEU. Madam Speaker, in March 
of this year, The Washington Post pub-
lished an article titled: ‘‘GOP law-
makers push historic wave of bills tar-
geting rights of LGBTQ teens, children, 
and their families.’’ 
In April, The Washington Post pub-
lished another article titled: ‘‘Some 
Republicans fear party overreach on 
LGBT measures.’’ 
I just thought I would now recite for 
you what Jesus Christ said about ho-
mosexuality: ‘‘. . . . ’’ 
f 
GUN CONTROL 
(Mr. ROSE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to address the heartbreak Ameri-
cans continue to reel from, the horrible 
killing of 19 students and two teachers 
by a demented teenager in Uvalde, 
Texas. 
As an elected Representative, as well 
as a parent, I am eager to find solu-
tions that make our kids safer. Those 
solutions must include strengthening 
mental health services and school secu-
rity across this country. 
Democrats in Congress have a choice 
to make. Do they want to focus yet 
again on more gun control, which 
won’t work and won’t pass the Senate, 
or do they want to focus on mental 
health and school security improve-
ments which will help, and on which we 
might be able to reach consensus and 
pass into law? 
Madam Speaker, I believe we can en-
hance protection for our children with-
out throwing away any of our hard-won 
freedoms. The ball is in the Democrats’ 
court. 
f 
GUN SAFETY LAWS 
(Mrs. LEE of Nevada asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today as we mark the 159th 
day of this year, and more than 246 
mass 
shootings; 
Columbine, 
Sandy 
Hook, Uvalde, Parkland. We cannot 
pretend that we have not been here be-
fore, and we cannot fail to act yet 
again. 
I have heard from mothers in my dis-
trict who are frightened for their chil-
dren’s safety. I have heard the horrors 
of the survivors of the October 1 shoot-
ing in Las Vegas, and survivors of do-
mestic violence and other daily gun vi-
olence that doesn’t always make the 
headlines. 
And I have heard the echoes of dec-
ades of disappointment and frustration 
as Congress has failed over and over 
again to do something. 
This is not about politics. It is about 
protecting our kids. This is about 
doing the jobs we were elected to do be-
cause I refuse to accept that because 
we may not be able to prevent all gun 
violence, we should not prevent any 
gun violence. 
We can act and must act, and that is 
why I am voting to pass the gun safety 
laws. 
f 
GAS PRICES 
(Mr. VALADAO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, gas 
prices across the country have reached 
yet another record-breaking high. The 
pain at the pump my constituents are 
facing is a direct result of this adminis-
tration’s war on American energy. 
Unfortunately, 
the 
administration 
continues to pass the blame for a crisis 
of their own making. 
In California, we are suffering with 
out-of-control prices that reached over 
$6.30 per gallon this week. That is near-
ly $1.50 higher than the national aver-
age; thanks, in part, to the State’s gas 
tax. 
Central Valley families are strug-
gling to drive their kids to school, get 
themselves to work, and buy groceries 
to feed their families. Any reduction in 
prices would provide much-needed re-
lief. 
I am, once again, calling on the State 
to immediately suspend the 51 cent per 
gallon tax. We need to unleash the 
power of our domestic energy produc-
tion and suspend the gas tax to get 
these prices under control for Central 
Valley residents. 
f 
SENSIBLE GUN SAFETY 
LEGISLATION 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam 
Speaker, in the House Oversight and 
Reform Committee this morning, we 
heard compelling testimony from indi-
viduals that had been directly affected 
by gun violence. 
The Buffalo Police Commissioner, 
Joseph Gramaglia, and also Zeneta 
Everhart provided testimony that is 
clear and compelling. 
The Buffalo shooting that took place, 
the shooting started at 2:30 in the 
afternoon and ended 2 minutes and 3 
seconds later; one shooter, one weapon 
of mass destruction, 13 people shot, 10 
people dead. 
We need sensible gun safety legisla-
tion in this country. When you look at 
the need for background checks, that 
doesn’t 
violate 
anybody’s 
constitu-
tional rights; but it affirms the right of 
people to live freely, to live safely, to 
live in a prosperous way in our neigh-
borhoods and throughout the country. 
f 
100 DAYS OF PUTIN’S WAR 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, last week marked 100 
tragic days since war criminal Putin’s 
war of mass murder against the sov-
ereign country of Ukraine. Putin’s 
merciless killing continues to horrify 
the world, while the heroic fight by 
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and 
the brave Ukrainians continue to draw 
inspiration. 
Ukrainians are front line in the glob-
al conflict of democracy’s rule of law, 
opposed by authoritarian’s rule of gun. 
I was grateful to be in Lithuania last 
week meeting with members of the 
NATO Parliamentary Assembly. Led 
by its president, GERRY CONNOLLY, the 
bipartisan delegation welcomed Fin-
land and Sweden into NATO, which 
Putin has unintentionally unified for 
victory in Ukraine. 
Putin is sacrificing Russian troops 
for his personal gain of oil, money, and 
power. 
Ever 
resolute, 
President 
Zelenskyy has said, ‘‘We have defended 
Ukraine for 100 days already. Victory 
will be ours.’’ 
America 
and 
the 
world 
support 
Ukraine in its efforts to protect its 
citizens and defeat evil. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops 
who have successfully protected Amer-
ica for 20 years in the global war on 
terrorism as it continues moving from 
the Afghanistan safe haven to America. 
f 
HONORING DR. LIANG CHEE WEE 
(Mrs. HINSON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Mrs. HINSON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and honor a dy-
namic leader from Iowa’s First Con-
gressional District, Dr. Liang Chee 
Wee. 
Dr. Wee is retiring after serving as 
the president of Northeast Iowa Com-
munity College for nearly 13 years. His 
passion for inclusivity ensured that ev-
eryone who stepped foot on the NICC 
campus, students, educators, employ-
ees, and members of the community all 
felt at home. 
Under his leadership, NICC became a 
space for addressing challenges in the 
community, and the college has made 
great strides in promoting growth for 
minority-owned businesses in the area. 
Dr. Wee always has a smile and a 
kind word of encouragement for every-
one that he meets. His authentic serv-
ant leadership will be missed at NICC, 
but I know that his work to improve 
our community is far from over. 
So thank you, Dr. Wee, and congratu-
lations on this exciting new chapter in 
your retirement.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5348 
June 8, 2022 
and a dear friend of mine, will retire 
from his long-time role as president of 
the University of Maryland, Baltimore 
County, more affectionately known as 
UMBC. 
Over the past 30 years, Dr. Freeman 
Hrabowski has transformed STEM edu-
cation at UMBC, most notably by ex-
panding resources for women and stu-
dents of color. 
UMBC was barely 10 years old when 
Dr. Hrabowski arrived as vice provost 
in 1987. Later, he was chosen as execu-
tive vice president and then named 
president in 1992, helping make UMBC 
a nationwide leader in STEM learning 
and a nationwide leader in education 
generally as well. 
Over the last decade, UMBC has grad-
uated more African Americans with 
doctorates in science and engineering 
than any other university in the 
United States. The school also pro-
duces the highest number of African- 
American undergraduates who go on to 
earn Ph.D.s in the natural sciences and 
engineering. 
These achievements occurred in no 
small part thanks to Dr. Hrabowski’s 
leadership, which made a critical dif-
ference as UMBC grew and expanded its 
academic programs. 
At UMBC and beyond, he has dedi-
cated his career to realizing the prom-
ise of students of color in STEM, and 
students generally as well, no matter 
their background, are assured access to 
high-quality science education. 
In 
2011, 
Madam 
Speaker, 
Dr. 
Hrabowski chaired the National Acad-
emies committee that produced a key 
report on expanding minority partici-
pation in science. In 2012, he was 
tapped by President Obama to serve as 
the chair of the inaugural President’s 
Advisory Commission on Educational 
Excellence for African Americans. 
When the COVID–19 pandemic hit in 
2020, Dr. Hrabowski sprang into action. 
Not only did he work to ensure that 
UMBC was contributing to research 
and taking safety measures, he and his 
wife, 
Jacqueline, 
personally 
volun-
teered for the phase 3 Moderna vaccine 
trial. Together, they campaigned to re-
duce vaccine hesitancy in Maryland, 
particularly in communities of color. 
Madam Speaker, one of the lead re-
searchers who developed the Moderna 
vaccine, Dr. Corbett, was a UMBC grad-
uate and the keynote speaker at our 
annual Maryland Fourth and Fifth Dis-
tricts’ Black History Breakfast this 
year. 
In addition to his leadership of 
UMBC, Dr. Hrabowski has authored nu-
merous books on STEM education and 
lifting up academically successful stu-
dents of color so they can reach for 
success in their careers. 
In a field where representation is 
lacking and where opportunities have 
not always been equitable, he has been 
at the forefront of the effort to ensure 
that all students, regardless of their 
background, can pursue their dreams 
and ambitions. 
Dr. Hrabowski has been recognized 
nationally and internationally for his 
impact. He was the recipient of the 
Carnegie Corporation of New York’s 
Academic Leadership Award in 2011, 
one of the highest honors for an educa-
tor in this country. 
He has been named as one of the 100 
most influential people in the world, as 
one of America’s most impactful lead-
ers, and as a top-tier university presi-
dent. 
Indeed, many universities in the Big 
Ten, many universities in the Ivy 
League, many universities in other 
parts of our country have opportuned 
Dr. Hrabowski to come to be their 
president. His love and commitment to 
UMBC, however, kept him there and fo-
cused on developing it as an extraor-
dinary institution of higher learning. 
I believe that the last part is the one 
of which Dr. Hrabowski is most proud; 
that is, a top-tier university president. 
While he has been rightfully lauded as 
a global leader in STEM, first and fore-
most, he is an educator. 
Frederick Douglass once wrote that 
it is easier to build strong children 
than it is to repair broken men. Over 
his long career in education, Dr. 
Hrabowski has laid the foundation for 
many thousands of young people to be-
come the best version of themselves. 
UMBC today graduates a diverse 
group of exceptionally bright and capa-
ble students who are quick to follow 
their dreams in large part because of 
Dr. Hrabowski’s talent, focus, and ef-
fort. He has been working so hard to 
make his dream of educational oppor-
tunity and excellence a reality, and he 
has succeeded in many ways. 
His legacy will surely be cemented in 
the innumerable achievements of his 
students that they have made over the 
last 30 years and will surely continue 
to do so for decades to come. 
Madam Speaker, as he prepares to 
leave UMBC at the end of this year, Dr. 
Hrabowski has set the school on a path 
of success and continued innovation. 
All Marylanders, and all Americans, 
can be proud of his unwavering com-
mitment to his students, to UMBC, and 
to his unshakable belief in the power of 
young people of color to achieve and 
contribute in the fields of STEM. 
The future of science, technology, en-
gineering, and math education nation-
wide is stronger not only at UMBC but 
throughout this country as a result of 
his leadership. 
Those of us fortunate enough to 
count Dr. Hrabowski among our friends 
are all the better for knowing him. I 
hope my colleagues in the House will 
join me, Madam Speaker, in congratu-
lating Dr. Hrabowski on his retirement 
this week and thanking him for his 
groundbreaking work over the last 30 
years. 
He is retiring from UMBC, Madam 
Speaker, but I am sure that he is not 
retiring from his life of advocacy for 
those who seek opportunity and the re-
alization of the American Dream. 
He is an extraordinary individual, an 
extraordinary 
speaker, 
an 
extraor-
dinary human being. I am certain that 
he will continue to benefit Maryland 
and our country as an educator and a 
visionary for many years to come. 
Godspeed, Dr. Hrabowski.

Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, for 
the purpose of debate only, I yield the 
customary 30 minutes to the gentle-
woman

Minnesota 
(Mrs. 
FISCHBACH), pending which I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. Dur-
ing consideration of this resolution, all 
time yielded is for the purpose of de-
bate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
yesterday, 
the 
Rules Committee met and reported a 
rule, House Resolution 1153, for two 
measures. 
First, it provides for consideration of 
H.R. 2377 under a closed rule. The rule 
self-executes a manager’s amendment, 
provides 1 hour of general debate equal-
ly divided and controlled by the chair 
and ranking member of the Judiciary 
Committee, and provides one motion to 
recommit. 
Second, the rule provides for consid-
eration of H.R. 7910 under a closed rule. 
The rule provides 2 hours of general de-
bate equally divided and controlled by 
the chair and ranking member of the 
Judiciary Committee. It provides that 
following debate the House will vote 
separately on retaining each title of 
the bill and provides one motion to re-
commit. 
Additionally, the rule deems passage 
of H. Res. 1151 and H. Res. 1152. 
Finally, the rule extends recess in-
structions, suspension authority, and 
same-day authority through June 17. 
Madam Speaker, I am struggling to 
put into words right now the tremen-
dous pain that so many Americans feel 
in the wake of the mass shootings in 
Uvalde, Texas, and Buffalo, New York, 
pain because, once again, we are bury-
ing America’s children. 
The hopes and dreams and futures of 
our kids, birthday parties and bar 
mitzvahs, and summer breaks and high 
school graduations stolen by a sense-
less, unceasing drumbeat of gun vio-
lence. The lives of innocent shoppers 
ended in a hate-fueled rampage of 
white supremacy. 
It does not have to be this way. What 
kind of country are we if we let this 
happen and do nothing? What does that 
say about our values and our priorities 
as a society? 
I am so deeply disappointed and frus-
trated as a Member of Congress, but 
even more as a parent. What happened 
in Uvalde is unconscionable. 
For God’s sake, the parents had to 
submit DNA because the bodies of their 
fourth graders were unrecognizable. 
They had to identify them by their 
shoes because the exit wounds pro-
duced by an AR–15 were so large that 
their bodies were torn apart by the bul-
lets. 
Madam Speaker, 18-year-olds can’t 
even rent a car, but they can buy guns 
that can tear people apart. It just 
doesn’t make any sense. 
When I think of the trauma the par-
ents had to go through, burying their 
kids, knowing that this could have 
been prevented if bills like the ones we 
are considering today were passed into 
law, it is beyond heartbreaking. 
There are no words, just sadness, 
when I think of my kids. Then, I think 
of all the parents who won’t get to 
watch their own kids grow up. 
For Uvalde, for Parkland, for Sandy 
Hook, for Buffalo, and all the mass 
shootings that have torn apart commu-
nities all across this country, I am 
pleading with my colleagues: Do not 
throw away this opportunity to get 
something done. Do not let partisan 
talking points get in the way of reason-
able gun safety measures. 
b 1230 
None of these ideas are extreme. In 
fact, they are what the vast majority 
of people in this country want us to do. 
This vote will unequivocally show 
where each and every one of us stands: 
on red flag laws, on raising the age to 
purchase a semiautomatic rifle from 18 
to 21, on gun trafficking and straw pur-
chases, on ghost guns, on the safe stor-
age of firearms, particularly when a 
minor is likely to gain access to them, 
on bump stocks, and on large-capacity 
magazines. 
We will have separate votes on all of 
these issues. This week there will be no 
excuses. 
Really, think about that list. None of 
these proposals are aimed at taking 
firearms away from law-abiding gun 
owners. They are aimed at stopping 
people from getting slaughtered in 
their schools, in churches, in grocery 
stores, in homes. 
These bills would have stopped the 
shooters in Buffalo and Uvalde from 
buying their guns. 
Madam Speaker, I am pleading with 
my colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle to work with us, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Massachu-
setts for yielding me the customary 30 
minutes, and I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. 
Let me be clear: House Republicans 
condemn 
the 
violence 
in 
Buffalo, 
Uvalde, Tulsa, and Philadelphia. We 
stand ready to work with the majority 
to directly address school safety, men-
tal health, and the root causes of gun 
violence. 
Unfortunately, the bills we are con-
sidering today under the rule are noth-
ing more than an attempt by Demo-
crats to try to push their antigun agen-
da. 
H.R. 7910 is a grab bag full of far-left 
proposals that will not effectively ad-
dress gun violence but will severely 
limit America’s Second Amendment 
rights. 
There are a few provisions I would 
like to point out. 
The bill raises the legal age of gun 
ownership to 21. This provision is very 
likely unconstitutional. Even a liberal 
district court in California has already 
determined that with regard to similar 
restrictions. 
This bill broadens the definition of 
‘‘frame or receiver’’ that could define 
multiple parts of the same gun as sepa-
rate firearms. Each of these parts 
would need its own distinct serial num-
ber or risk becoming a classified ghost 
gun. This could turn millions of legal 
guns into contraband, and law-abiding 
gun owners into felons. 
H.R. 2377 is another reminder the 
Democrats fundamentally have no re-
spect for Second Amendment rights. It 
shows their lack of respect for Fourth 
Amendment rights also. This bill de-
stroys the presumption of innocence 
that is the bedrock of our justice sys-
tem. 
It does away with the notion that an 
individual is innocent until proven 
guilty, and instead makes anyone sub-
ject to an extreme risk protection 
order guilty until proven innocent with 
what amounts to another version of a 
red flag law. 
They also want to mandate a system 
for gun storage in private homes, 
which is unconstitutional, and almost 
impossible to enforce without stripping 
even more rights from law-abiding citi-
zens. Democrats are picking and choos-
ing legal standards to deprive citizens 
of their constitutional rights based on 
how closely those rights are aligned 
with their political agenda. 
Furthermore, the universe of individ-
uals who can petition a court for an ex-
treme risk protection order under this 
bill is far too broad, and it creates a 
process that is ripe for abuse. This bill 
would create an opportunity for a dis-
gruntled ex-roommate or predatory do-
mestic partner to use the judicial sys-
tem to harass and burden an individual 
by requiring law enforcement to seize 
that individual’s firearms and ammuni-
tion. 
Federal law already prohibits dan-
gerous and unfit individuals from pur-
chasing or possessing firearms. An in-
dividual with a misdemeanor domestic

violence conviction, an individual in-
voluntarily committed to a mental in-
stitution or adjudicated mentally de-
fective, or an individual who is an un-
lawful user of controlled substances are 
all prohibited from possessing or pur-
chasing a firearm under current law. 
Democrats rejected an amendment 
that will allow for transfers of a fire-
arm to a victim of domestic violence 
for self-defense. Under this bill, a 
friend or neighbor trying to help a vic-
tim would be charged with gun traf-
ficking. 
These bills are not about public safe-
ty, they are about the left’s antigun 
agenda. 
During the Judiciary Committee’s 
consideration of this bill, the chairman 
of the committee conceded that the 
strict gun laws in liberal jurisdictions 
don’t work because criminals are able 
to obtain guns elsewhere illegally. A 
Member from Tennessee on that com-
mittee admitted that the Democrats’ 
bills will make it harder for law-abid-
ing Americans to exercise their Second 
Amendment rights. Another Member, 
one from New York, threatened to 
abolish the filibuster and pack the Su-
preme Court if any of our Nation’s 
checks and balances stood in the way 
of the Democrats’ agenda to trample 
the Second Amendment. 
The majority will argue that these 
are commonsense proposals, but they 
fail to explain the details and the real 
effects of these provisions. 
And what are law-abiding gun owners 
concerned about? They are concerned 
about the attack on their constitu-
tional rights provided in the Second 
Amendment. 
All of us recognize the recent trage-
dies, and our heart goes out to the par-
ents, the families, and communities, 
but the root causes must be addressed. 
Simply attacking law-abiding gun own-
ers will not solve the problem. Address-
ing the causes will. 
House Republicans stand ready to ad-
dress the root causes of these senseless 
acts of violence, but not at the cost of 
America’s constitutional rights. 
Madam Speaker, I oppose the rule, 
and I ask Members to do the same. I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
The gentlewoman said Republicans 
stand ready to address school safety 
and other root causes of gun violence. 
I include in the RECORD a May 26, 
2022, article from The Texas Tribune 
entitled: ‘‘Texas already ‘hardened’ 
schools. It didn’t save Uvalde.’’ 
[From The Texas Tribune, May 26, 2022] 
TEXAS ALREADY ‘‘HARDENED’’ SCHOOLS. IT 
DIDN’T SAVE UVALDE. 
(By Jolie McCullough and Kate McGee) 
Four years after an armed 17-year-old 
opened fire inside a Texas high school, kill-
ing 10, Gov. Greg Abbott tried to tell another 
shell-shocked community that lost 19 chil-
dren and two teachers to a teen gunman 
about his wins in what is now an ongoing ef-
fort against mass shootings. 
‘‘We consider what we did in 2019 to be one 
of the most profound legislative sessions not 
just in Texas but in any state to address 
school shootings,’’ Abbott said inside a 
Uvalde auditorium Wednesday as he sat 
flanked by state and local officials. ‘‘But to 
be clear, we understand our work is not done, 
our work must continue.’’ 
Throughout 
the 
60-minute 
news 
con-
ference, he and other Republican leaders said 
a 2019 law allowed districts to ‘‘harden’’ 
schools from external threats after a deadly 
shooting inside an art classroom at Santa Fe 
High School near Houston the year before. 
After the Uvalde gunman was reportedly 
able to enter Robb Elementary School 
through a back door this week, their calls to 
secure buildings resurfaced yet again. 
But a deeper dive into the 2019 law revealed 
many of its ‘‘hardening’’ elements have fall-
en short. Schools didn’t receive enough state 
money to make the types of physical im-
provements lawmakers are touting publicly. 
Few school employees signed up to bring 
guns to work. And many school districts ei-
ther don’t have an active shooting plan or 
produced insufficient ones. 
In January 2020, the Uvalde Consolidated 
Independent School District received $69,000 
from a one-time, $100 million state grant to 
enhance physical security in Texas public 
schools, according to a dataset detailing the 
Texas Education Agency grants. The funds 
were comparable to what similarly sized dis-
tricts received. 
Even with more funds and better enforce-
ment of policies, experts have said there is 
no indication that beefing up security in 
schools has prevented any violence. Plus, 
they said, it can be detrimental to children, 
especially children of color. 
‘‘This concept of hardening, the more it 
has been done, it’s not shown the results,’’ 
said Jagdish Khubchandani, a public health 
professor at New Mexico State University 
who studies school security practices and 
their effectiveness. 
Khubchandani said the majority of public 
schools in the United States already imple-
ment the security measures most often pro-
moted by public officials, including locked 
doors to the outside and in classrooms, ac-
tive shooter plans and security cameras. 
After a review of 18 years of school secu-
rity measures, Khubchandani and James 
Price from the University of Toledo did not 
find any evidence that such tactics or more 
armed teachers reduced gun violence in 
schools. 
‘‘It’s not just guns. It’s not just security,’’ 
Khubchandani said. ‘‘It’s a combination of 
issues, and if you have a piecemeal approach, 
then you’ll never succeed. You need a com-
prehensive approach.’’ 
INSUFFICIENT ACTIVE SHOOTER PLANS 
Since the shooting, GOP lawmakers have 
repeatedly suggested limiting access to 
schools to one door. 
‘‘We’ve got to, in our smaller schools 
where we can, get down to one entrance,’’ Lt. 
Gov. Dan Patrick offered at the press con-
ference Wednesday. ‘‘One entrance might be 
one of those solutions. If he had taken three 
more minutes to find that open door . . . the 
police were there pretty quickly.’’ 
There are still questions about the timing 
and details of the tragedy, however, includ-
ing whether the shooter busted a lock to get 
into the school or if a door was unlocked. A 
state police official reported Thursday that 
the door appeared to be unlocked but that it 
was still under investigation. 
Khubchandani and education advocates 
said locking doors and routing everyone 
through one entrance is already standard 
practice in most districts. And safety leaders 
said locking exterior doors is a best practice, 
but it’s one strategy that needs to be strictly 
enforced. 
‘‘Sometimes convenience can take priority 
over safety and you can have a plan in place, 
you can have policies in place,’’ said Kathy 
Martinez Prather, director of the Texas 
School Safety Center at Texas State Univer-
sity. ‘‘They’re only as effective as they’re 
being implemented.’’ 
At Wednesday’s press conference, Abbott 
emphasized that the package of school safety 
laws passed in 2019 required school districts 
to submit emergency operations plans to the 
Texas School Safety Center and make sure 
they have adequate active shooter strategies 
to employ in an emergency. 
State law dictates that districts must be 
able to show how they will prepare for, re-
spond to and recover from disasters like ac-
tive threats, but also extreme weather and 
communicable disease. These plans must in-
clude training mechanisms, communication 
plans and mandatory drills. Schools must 
create safety committees and establish a 
way to assess threats. 
But a three-year audit by the center in 2020 
found that out of the 1,022 school districts in 
the state, just 200 had active shooter poli-
cies, even though most districts reported 
having one. The audit revealed 626 districts 
did not have active shooter policies in place 
and 196 districts had insufficient policies. 
Just 67 school districts had viable emer-
gency operations plans overall, the report 
found. 
Martinez Prather wouldn’t say if Uvalde’s 
emergency plan was considered adequate be-
cause of ongoing investigations into the 
shooting. But said the center’s review did 
not find any areas of noncompliance. 
The audit reviewed school districts’ emer-
gency plans in June 2020, and Martinez 
Prather said she was ‘‘absolutely’’ surprised 
that so many schools did not have clear-cut 
plans, especially after the Santa Fe shooting 
and others around the country. 
‘‘Our attention to this issue should not be 
as close to the nearest and latest school 
shooting,’’ she said. ‘‘We need to keep send-
ing that message that this can happen at any 
point in time and to anybody.’’ 
She said the center has spent the last year 
and a half following up with schools to get 
their plans up to standard. 
ARMING TEACHERS AND STAFF WITH GUNS 
Texas leaders have already shunned the 
idea of restricting gun access in the after-
math of the Uvalde shooting. In fact, in re-
cent years, Texas lawmakers have loosened 
gun laws after mass shootings. 
Instead, lawmakers point to the nearly 
decade-old school marshal program in Texas 
as another measure to deter and prevent 
mass shootings. That program was created in 
response to the deadly shooting at an ele-
mentary school in Newtown, Connecticut, 
that left 26 people dead, including 20 first- 
graders. 
Designated school employees who take an 
80-hour training course and pass a psycho-
logical exam are allowed to keep a firearm in 
a lockbox on school grounds, an idea most 
attractive to rural schools in areas where 
law enforcement response can take longer. 
After the school shooting in Santa Fe, 
state lawmakers removed the cap that lim-
ited schools to one marshal per 200 students. 
Today, according to the Texas Commission 
on Law Enforcement, which oversees the 
training for the program, there are 256 mar-
shals across the state. 
While lawmakers tout it as a potential tool 
to prevent mass shootings, just 6% of school 
districts use it, according to a report from 
the Texas School Safety Center. Martinez 
Prather at the Texas School Safety Center 
said many school districts say it’s expensive

and the training is time-consuming for edu-
cators. 
Meanwhile, 280 schools are utilizing an un-
regulated option known as the Guardian Pro-
gram, which allows local school boards to ap-
prove individuals in schools to carry con-
cealed weapons. Each ‘‘guardian’’ must have 
a handgun license and take 15 to 20 hours of 
specialized training by the Texas Depart-
ment of Public Safety. 
Nicole Golden, executive director of Texas 
Gun Sense, said she’s concerned by the 
‘‘minimal’’ level of training school staff go 
through before they are approved to have a 
weapon in the classroom. 
‘‘These aren’t law enforcement officers,’’ 
she said. ‘‘These are school staff who have 
some training, and there’s really not a lot of 
data to support that that’s the safe direction 
to go in.’’ 
Plus, Golden said, placing more guns on 
school grounds can be problematic when data 
shows students of color are disproportion-
ately disciplined. 
When lawmakers decided to expand the 
number of marshals in Texas schools in 2019, 
Black students and parents said the idea 
made them feel less safe in school, knowing 
they are disciplined more than other stu-
dents. 
The study from Khubchandani and Price 
pointed to a 2018 shooting at a high school in 
Kentucky where the shooter killed two and 
injured 14 students in 10 seconds. 
‘‘Armed school personnel would have need-
ed to be in the exact same spot in the school 
as the shooter to significantly reduce this 
level of trauma,’’ the researchers wrote. 
‘‘Ten seconds is too fast to stop a school 
shooter with a semiautomatic firearm when 
the armed school guard is in another place in 
the school.’’ 
$10 PER STUDENT FOR SAFETY 
Big changes often take big money, and offi-
cials have noted that the 2019 school safety 
bill gives about $100 million per biennium to 
the Texas Education Agency. The agency 
then distributes the money to school dis-
tricts to use on equipment, programs and 
training related to school safety and secu-
rity, a little less than $10 per student based 
on average daily attendance. The money can 
be used broadly, ranging from physical secu-
rity enhancements to suicide prevention pro-
grams. 
According to a self-reported survey of dis-
tricts by the Texas School Safety Center, 
more than two thirds of school districts have 
used this money for security cameras. 20% 
used it for active shooter response training. 
Nearly 40% of districts installed physical 
barriers with the allotment. 
But Zeph Capo, president of the Texas 
chapter of the American Federation of 
Teachers, said that money wasn’t enough to 
pay for the more expensive projects law-
makers were suggesting. 
‘‘Districts ended up spending money on 
some programs, some electronic AV equip-
ment, but I don’t think it was nearly enough 
to do what needs to be done in most of the 
schools, which is really change the struc-
tures of the buildings so there’s better con-
trol over entrance and egress,’’ he said, not-
ing that AFT believes more gun restrictions 
is a better solution. 
The TEA also received a separate one-time 
$100 million pool of money to provide grants 
to districts specifically for physical security 
enhancements, like metal detectors, door- 
locking systems or bullet-resistant glass. 
It’s unclear how Uvalde CISD spent the 
$69,000 it received from the state to enhance 
its physical security. School officials did not 
respond to questions Wednesday. As of the 
May 2 report, the district had spent about 
$48,000 of the grant, which is set to end at the 
end of the month. 
Other remote town school districts re-
ceived comparable grants per their student 
population, according to an analysis by The 
Texas Tribune. For example, the Sulphur 
Springs Independent School District in East 
Texas has only a slightly larger student pop-
ulation and received about $71,000 in grant 
funds. 
According to a district document, Uvalde 
CISD, which enrolls around 4,100 students, 
had a variety of so-called hardening meas-
ures in place that lawmakers and school 
safety leaders recommend. 
The district employed four district police 
officers, installed perimeter fencing meant 
to limit access around schools, including 
Robb, and instituted a policy that all class-
room doors remain locked during the day. 
There are campus teams that identify and 
address potential threats, and schools hold 
emergency drills for students ‘‘regularly.’’ 
The district employed a threat reporting sys-
tem for community members to raise con-
cerns. Some schools had security vestibules 
at their entrances and buzz-in systems to get 
inside from the outdoors. 
But a security vestibule, which is basically 
a secure lobby to the school, can be a huge 
expense for school districts already tight on 
money. In 2019, the Waller Independent 
School District estimated that the addition 
of two of these entrances to the junior high 
school would cost $345,000. Security cameras 
at a small elementary school can cost more 
than $20,000, according to industry experts. 
In recent years—even before the Santa Fe 
shooting—school districts have begun to rely 
on bond proposals to find the money to im-
plement some of these changes. 
But Texas voters have expressed hesitancy 
at the ballot box to approve such bonds in re-
cent years, which the Texas Association of 
School Boards attributed to the lingering 
pandemic and political polarization. Recent 
changes by the Texas Legislature have also 
complicated bond requests for schools after 
it started to require districts to write, ‘‘This 
is a property tax increase,’’ on bond project 
signs, even when the proposals wouldn’t af-
fect the tax rate. 
Overall, Monty Exter, a senior lobbyist 
with the Association of Texas Professional 
Educators, said the per-student allotment 
and one-time grants set aside for school se-
curity could never pay for the types of con-
struction projects lawmakers have touted 
publicly in the wake of the shooting. 
‘‘Thinking 
about 
making 
significant 
changes to 8,000-plus campuses, $100 million 
doesn’t necessarily go that far,’’ he said. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, we 
keep hearing that the epidemic of mass 
school shootings can be solved by hard-
ening schools. Guess what? Robb Ele-
mentary had been hardened. We can 
harden schools all we want, we can 
turn them into fortresses, but unless 
we deal with the underlying issue, it is 
going to keep happening. 
The gentlewoman from Minnesota 
also said mental health is a root cause. 
I include in the RECORD a Bloomberg 
article published May 27, 2022, entitled: 
‘‘Republicans Push Unfounded Mental 
Health Claim for Gun Violence.’’ 
[From Bloomberg, May 27, 2022] 
REPUBLICANS PUSH UNFOUNDED MENTAL 
HEALTH CLAIM FOR GUN VIOLENCE 
(By Emma Court) 
Republican politicians from Senator Ted 
Cruz to Texas Governor Greg Abbott have 
been quick to blame mental illness following 
a deadly school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, 
that killed 19 children and two teachers. 
The problem with that thinking is that the 
evidence doesn’t support it—even if common 
sense suggests a mass shooting, especially of 
children, is not the act of a person who is 
mentally well. 
While reporting from Texas following the 
May 24 shooting makes clear the Uvalde gun-
man, Salvador Ramos, was a deeply troubled 
individual, state officials have said he had no 
documented mental health issues. Research 
shows that only a very small percentage of 
violent behavior is connected to mental ill-
ness. 
‘‘If we magically cured all these serious 
mental illnesses tomorrow, which would be 
wonderful—imagine the alleviation of suf-
fering—our violence problem would go down 
by about 4%,’’ said Jeffrey Swanson, a pro-
fessor in psychiatry and behavioral sciences 
at Duke University. 
Firearm violence is a greater risk for 
young males, individuals with a violent 
childhood and those who abuse drugs and al-
cohol. While mental illness can contribute to 
gun violence, the vast majority of those suf-
fering from mental illness will never engage 
in violent acts, Swanson said. 
Attributing school shootings to mental ill-
ness, 
meanwhile, 
increases 
the 
stigma 
around such conditions, which include de-
pression, schizophrenia and psychosis, ac-
cording to experts. 
GUN DEATHS 
National Rifle Association leaders are ex-
pected to shift the focus away from gun poli-
cies that put deadly weapons in the hands of 
the public when their national convention 
kicks off in Houston on Friday. The organi-
zation called the Uvalde massacre ‘‘the act 
of a lone, deranged criminal’’ in a statement. 
Around 45,000 people died from gun-related 
deaths in the US in 2020, according to the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
More than half those deaths were suicides, 
and many of the remainder were murders. 
Guns are also now the leading cause of 
death among children and adolescents, sur-
passing car crashes, drug overdoses and 
drownings, according to recent CDC data. 
Texas is fiercely pro-gun rights, and Ab-
bott last year signed legislation allowing 
Texans to carry handguns without a license. 
Abbott, at a press conference in Uvalde, 
suggested that access to guns isn’t the issue. 
‘‘We haven’t had episodes like this before,’’ 
Abbott said. ‘‘One thing that has substan-
tially changed is the status of mental health 
in our communities.’’ 
In truth, shooters in the US have tried to 
kill in places like schools, malls and bars for 
decades. 
Cruz, who is expected to be at the NRA 
event, has described the shooting as the ac-
tions of a ‘‘violent psychopath.’’ He also said 
none of the gun-law proposals made by 
Democrats would have stopped it. 
Democrats have been quick to dispute 
those claims. ‘‘Spare me the bull,’’ Democrat 
Chris Murphy of Connecticut said to report-
ers after urging his colleagues to take action 
against gun violence. 
Other countries have mental health prob-
lems too but rarely have mass shootings, 
President Joe Biden said in a May 24 speech 
in which he pleaded for gun reform and 
called for standing up to gun manufacturers. 
‘‘They have mental health problems. They 
have domestic disputes in other countries. 
They have people who are lost,’’ Biden said. 
‘‘But these kinds of mass shootings never 
happen with the kind of frequency they hap-
pen in America.’’ 
WIDESPREAD MISCONCEPTION 
Many people associate mental illness with 
violence, likely because of how these condi-
tions are portrayed in the media, including 
in reporting about shootings like Uvalde. 
Mental illness can also be an easy scape-
goat for making sense of tragedies like

Uvalde, which are devastating and hard to 
comprehend, said Lynsay Ayer, a senior be-
havioral scientist at Rand Corp., a nonprofit 
research organization. 
‘‘People want to explain it, to say ‘this 
person wasn’t thinking rationally, wasn’t 
thinking like you and me, something went 
wrong in their brain wiring,’ ’’ she said. 
Blaming mental illness is ‘‘convenient, but 
it’s overly simplistic and runs the risk of 
hurting people who have mental health prob-
lems.’’ 
People with mental health disorders are, in 
fact, more likely to be the victims of vio-
lence than a perpetrator, Ayer said. 
Using mental illness as an explanation for 
such events also plays into outdated tropes, 
like the idea that ‘‘something is wrong with’’ 
those individuals, said Hannah Wesolowski, 
chief advocacy officer for the National Alli-
ance on Mental Illness. 
‘‘I think people confuse having a mental 
health condition with being troubled, and 
they are not one and the same,’’ she said. 
Mental illness is defined by specific medical 
guidelines. It’s also widespread, affecting one 
in five US adults every year. 
Gun violence remains poorly understood. 
One reason: Since 1996, Congress has limited 
federal funding of research into the subject. 
While that’s now changing, gaps in under-
standing remain. Studying mass shootings is 
also challenging because such events are rel-
atively rare, Ayer said. 
(Everytown for Gun Safety, which advo-
cates for universal background checks and 
gun-safety measures, is backed by Michael 
Bloomberg, founder and majority owner of 
Bloomberg News parent company Bloomberg 
LP.) 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, let 
me set the record straight. 
Yes, we have people with mental 
health issues in America. So do other 
countries. Only here in America do we 
have widespread, fatal gun violence to 
the extent that we do, so spare us the 
lectures. 
I should say, under GOP Governor 
Greg Abbott, Texas is last—last—in the 
Nation for mental health access. 
Just one final thing. We keep hearing 
about the inconveniences of these pro-
posals: 
safe 
storage, 
background 
checks, waiting lists. I get it. There 
may be some inconvenience here, but 
stack that up against the carnage, 
stack that up against the mass shoot-
ings, the daily killings in this country. 
I mean, for once, can we put that first 
over 
the 
inconvenience 
of 
going 
through a background check? This is a 
moment I hoped that we could actually 
do something, but instead we are com-
plaining about inconveniences. Give 
me a break. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
BOWMAN). 
Mr. BOWMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of my resolution, H. 
Res. 1152, to condemn the great re-
placement myth, which is a delusional 
white supremacist conspiracy theory. 
I am honored to be joined by my co- 
leads: CBC Chairwoman BEATTY, CHC 
Chairman RUIZ, CAPAC Chairwoman 
CHU, 
LGBTQ-plus 
Equality 
Caucus 
Chairman CICILLINE, CPC Chairwoman 
JAYAPAL, Congressman TAKANO, Con-
gressman RASKIN, and the Representa-
tive from Buffalo, New York, Congress-
man HIGGINS. We are joined by more 
than 140 of our Democratic colleagues 
as original cosponsors. 
On May 14, a self-described white su-
premacist and anti-Semite drove more 
than 200 miles to Buffalo, New York, 
where he killed 10 people and injured 3 
others, 11 of which were Black. 
In a 180-page manifesto that he post-
ed publicly online, he cites the great 
replacement myth as his motivation 
and cause to target Black people. The 
great replacement myth is a racist, 
anti-Semitic, 
Islamophobic, 
xenophobic, nativist, and hateful lie. 
It is 2022, and Black people are still 
being hunted down and killed in Amer-
ica. The same goes for every person of 
color, Jewish people, the LGBTQ-plus 
community, and every marginalized 
person in this country. We remember 
the lives of Aaron Salter, Ruth Whit-
field, Pearl Young, Katherine ‘‘Kat’’ 
Massey, Heyward Patterson, Celestine 
Chaney, Roberta Drury, Margus D. 
Morrison, Andre Mackneil, and Geral-
dine Talley, all who should still be here 
with us today. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield the gentleman an additional 30 
seconds. 
Mr. BOWMAN. Madam Speaker, our 
Nation has been mourning since this 
country was founded. We cannot con-
tinue to carry on as if this hatred is an 
undeniable part of American culture 
and cannot change. We must combat 
white 
supremacy. 
I 
refuse 
to 
be 
complicit in this hatred because we 
have failed to take a stand as a Nation. 
I urge my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to stand together and con-
demn this myth as the white suprema-
cist conspiracy theory that it is and 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on the rule. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I just want to make 
a couple of comments. The gentleman 
from Massachusetts, with all due re-
spect, mentioned other countries. I will 
just point out that other countries 
don’t have the freedoms and don’t live 
the way we do in our great democracy 
or Republic, whichever, and they don’t 
have the constitutional rights that we 
have under the Second Amendment. 
Our citizens ask to have that Con-
stitution respected, and I don’t believe 
I used the word ‘‘inconvenient’’ at all. 
What I used are the words, ‘‘trampling 
our constitutional rights,’’ and that is 
what I think is important here, that we 
do not talk about the gentleman from 
Massachusetts mentioning these incon-
venient things. I am talking about our 
citizens’ constitutional rights under 
the Second Amendment. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes 
to the gentlewoman from North Caro-
lina (Ms. FOXX). 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in opposition to H.R. 2377, the 
Extreme Risk Protection Order Act. 
Simply put, this bill tramples upon the 
Second Amendment by means of de-
stroying the Fifth. 
However, I would like to direct my 
argument against the bill towards an-
other amendment, the Tenth, which re-
serves powers to the States. Nineteen 
States have already enacted red flag 
laws in some form or another, and all 
31 additional States have the authority 
to do so. 
The Federal Government must ask 
itself whether this bill will add any 
measure of additional security the 
States are not already able to make for 
themselves. The Federal Government 
must also look to these States to gauge 
whether red flag laws have any effect 
on gun violence at all. 
It is certainly not the case in Chi-
cago, Illinois, a city subject to State 
red flag laws, which leads all American 
cities in the number of persons killed 
and injured in mass shootings over the 
past 4 years. Red flag laws have saved 
no lives in Chicago. 
This bill is redundant, not to men-
tion likely ineffective. Americans de-
serve better than this. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, the gentlewoman 
from Minnesota made a reference to 
the United States in comparison to 
other countries. I am holding this 
chart up here. You may not be able to 
see, but this is the number of gun 
deaths. The U.K. is way down here, 
France, Germany, Denmark, Switzer-
land, all free countries. You may not 
be able to see because it is so small, 
compared to the United States. You 
sure as hell can see the number of gun 
deaths here in the United States. It is 
unacceptable. It is unacceptable. And 
it is about time that Democrats and 
Republicans all agree that it is unac-
ceptable, and that is what this debate 
is about. 
If we want to talk about other coun-
tries around the world that are free, 
lots of countries that enjoy freedom do 
not have the number of gun deaths and 
massacres. Their parliaments and their 
Congresses are not meeting to grieve 
over the execution and the mass killing 
of little children in schools like we do 
on a regular basis. 
b 1245 
The only question for people here is 
whether we are going to do anything or 
whether this is going to be business as 
usual: Take the money from the gun 
lobby and do nothing. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from North Carolina 
(Ms. ROSS), a distinguished member of 
the Committee on Rules. 
Ms. ROSS. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the chairman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today because 
there is no greater moral imperative 
for us as Representatives than pro-
tecting the safety of our children and 
our residents. 
In recent weeks, our Nation has been 
yet again shaken to its core by the

senseless attack on our most vulner-
able. Heartbreakingly, mass shootings 
have become a steady drumbeat in 
American life, striking community 
after community, and instilling fear in 
the American people as we drop our 
kids off at school, go to the grocery 
store, or enter a house of worship. 
Madam Speaker, after each of these 
terrifying events, after the vigils have 
been held and the new cycle has moved 
on, there is one thing that never fades. 
Every person who has had a friend, 
neighbor, spouse, or child taken by vio-
lence, carries with them the heart-
breaking pain of that incomprehensible 
loss. 
So what will it take for Republican 
leaders to join us in taking action? So 
many Republicans agree with us. How 
many kids need to die? How many fam-
ilies need to suffer before they finally 
say enough is enough? 
I have spent much of my public life 
in public service, and I believe in 
American democracy. And I still be-
lieve in the ability of men and women 
in this Chamber to set their differences 
aside, to make transformative change 
for the public good. 
Madam Speaker, my plea to my col-
leagues across the aisle is to stand up 
for what is right. Let’s start the hard 
work of building a safer America. I 
come from a southern State with plen-
ty of law-abiding gun owners, but peo-
ple from across North Carolina have 
been reaching out to me and my office, 
including several Republicans and gun 
owners. 
Madam Speaker, I support the rule 
and commend it to this body. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, I will offer an amend-
ment to the rule to immediately con-
sider the Prosecutors Need to Pros-
ecute Act, legislation authored by Rep-
resentatives MALLIOTAKIS and TIFFANY 
that ensures accountability for those 
charged with keeping our streets, our 
schools, and our communities safe. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to insert the text of my 
amendment along with extraneous ma-
terials immediately prior to the vote 
on the previous question. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Minnesota? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, 
while my colleagues in the majority 
believe that the best approach to ad-
dressing violence is to strip away 
American’s constitutional rights, Re-
publicans stand with parents and com-
munities in ensuring those who com-
mit crimes are prosecuted to the full-
est extent of the law. And those who 
don’t, will be held accountable. Just 
last night, families in San Francisco 
ousted their district attorney for fail-
ing to keep their streets free from 
criminals. 
Americans are fed up with liberal 
prosecutors 
letting 
criminals 
run 
rampant for the sake of woke idealism. 
This legislation will ensure the Depart-
ment of Justice and the American pub-
lic have the data and information nec-
essary to hold those responsible for 
keeping our streets safe accountable. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. 
MALLIOTAKIS) to further explain this 
amendment. 
Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to oppose the previous 
question so that we can immediately 
consider my bill, H.R. 7967, the Pros-
ecutors Need to Prosecute Act. 
My legislation will hold prosecutors 
accountable and create transparency 
by letting the public know how many 
cases prosecutors are declining to pros-
ecute, the number of offenses com-
mitted by career criminals, and the 
number of criminals released. 
Over the past 2 years, we have seen a 
disturbing trend in progressive district 
attorneys in cities across the country 
who are refusing to prosecute violent 
criminal offenders. 
Look no further than my city of New 
York, where Manhattan DA Alvin 
Bragg released a ‘‘Day One’’ memo ini-
tially directing his staff not to pros-
ecute certain crimes, including: drug 
possession, trespassing, driving with a 
suspended license, sex trading, resist-
ing arrest, and public obscenity. 
He even directed his staff to down-
grade felony charges filed by our po-
lice, including armed robbery, weapons 
charges, and drug dealing. Worst of all, 
his office will no longer seek life sen-
tences without parole, which means 
the most heinous murderers, including 
terrorists, serial killers, cop killers, 
and perps who kill young children in 
connection with sex crimes will be re-
leased back on to our streets in 20 
years or less. 
These policies have sent a clear mes-
sage to criminals, and that message is: 
Go ahead, commit crime, break the 
law, because we will not enforce it. 
What is the point of creating laws if 
the ones currently on the books are not 
enforced? 
With prosecutors that refuse to pros-
ecute, it is no surprise that crime is 
surging in cities across America. In 
Boston and Los Angeles, if you want a 
designer purse, toiletries, or food, you 
can break into any store and take it. 
No questions asked. 
This week, LA’s District Attorney 
George Gascon doubled down on the 
light sentence given to a teen driver 
who mowed down a mother and her 
newborn baby last summer. The teen 
only received juvenile probation, which 
authorities say is less than military 
school and a little bit tougher than 
summer camp. 
In 2020, defund the police rioters and 
looters created chaos in my city of New 
York, destroying storefronts; they as-
saulted police officers, and they even 
put police cars on fire. While police 
made hundreds of arrests, New York 
City district attorneys dismissed the 
majority of those charges filed. 
In the Bronx, more than 60 percent of 
arrestees had their charges dropped, 
and of the 485 rioters arrested in Man-
hattan, 
222 
individuals 
had 
their 
charges dropped entirely, while 73 re-
ceived lesser counts. 
The same goes for Federal prosecu-
tors in Portland, Oregon, who dis-
missed roughly half the cases charged 
in connection with violence and anti- 
police protests. 
In Philadelphia, 23-year-old Police 
Corporal James O’Connor was gunned 
down and killed in 2020 by a career 
felon and wanted gangbanger because 
the DA’s office allowed him to freely 
roam the streets. Perhaps if the DA’s 
office had done its job, Corporal O’Con-
nor would be alive today. We had a 
similar story in my city of New York 
as well. 
In NANCY PELOSI’s San Francisco, on 
New Year’s Eve 2020, a man slammed a 
stolen car into two women crossing the 
street, killing them both. The man, 
who had a lengthy criminal rap sheet, 
was out on parole, thanks to San Fran-
cisco’s soft-on-crime DA Chesa Boudin, 
the son of a domestic terrorist cop-kill-
er associated with the far-left militant 
group, Weather Underground. 
Well, you know what? Voters have 
had enough of the violence and crime 
plaguing our communities and endan-
gering their families. In fact, just last 
night, when San Francisco voters re-
called Boudin, they sent a clear mes-
sage that prosecutors who fail to do 
their job will be removed from office. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentlewoman. 
Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. Madam Speaker, 
our Nation is under attack by crimi-
nals with no regard for property and 
life, and rogue district attorneys who 
allow them to wreak havoc on our 
streets. 
Madam Speaker, I close with the 
words of the late Democrat Senator 
Robert Kennedy: ‘‘Every society gets 
the kind of criminal it deserves. What 
is equally true is that every commu-
nity gets the kind of law enforcement 
it insists on.’’ 
Let’s stop siding with the criminals 
preying 
on 
our 
cities. 
Let’s 
stop 
emboldening the district attorneys to 
lay idly by as crime plagues our 
streets. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to 
support my legislation today. It is time 
to support our citizens, not criminals. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I began this debate 
by appealing to my colleagues to try to 
find common ground and come to-
gether and do something about this 
gun violence epidemic. And yet, we 
hear the same old tired red State 
versus blue State talking points di-
rectly from the gun lobby.

up, I include in the RECORD an April 4,

H5354 
June 8, 2022 
2022, Yahoo News article entitled, ‘‘Re-
publican-controlled States have higher 
murder rates than Democratic ones,’’ 
according to the study. 
[From Yahoo! News, April 4, 2022] 
REPUBLICAN-CONTROLLED STATES HAVE HIGH-
ER MURDER RATES THAN DEMOCRATIC ONES: 
STUDY 
(By Ben Adler) 
Republican 
politicians 
routinely 
claim 
that cities run by Democrats have been expe-
riencing crime waves caused by failed gov-
ernance, but a new study shows murder rates 
are actually higher in states and cities con-
trolled by Republicans. 
‘‘We’re seeing murders in our cities, all 
Democrat-run,’’ former President Donald 
Trump asserted at a March 26 rally in Geor-
gia. ‘‘People are afraid to go out.’’ 
In February, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., 
blamed Democrats for a 2018 law that re-
duced some federal prison sentences—even 
though it was signed by Trump after passing 
a GOP-controlled Congress. ‘‘It’s your party 
who voted in lockstep for the First Step Act 
that let thousands of violent felons on the 
street who have now committed innumerable 
violent crimes,’’ Cotton said during a speech 
in the Senate. 
Last December, Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R– 
Texas, told Fox News viewers, ‘‘America’s 
most beautiful cities are indeed being ruined 
by liberal policies: There’s a direct line be-
tween death and decay and liberal policies.’’ 
But a comparison of violent crime rates in 
jurisdictions controlled by Democrats and 
Republicans tells a very different story. In 
fact, a new study from the center-left think 
tank Third Way shows that states won by 
Trump in the 2020 election have higher mur-
der rates than those carried by Joe Biden. 
The highest murder rates, the study found, 
are often in conservative, rural states. 
The study found that murder rates in the 
25 states Trump carried in 2020 are 40 percent 
higher overall than in the states Biden won. 
(The report used 2020 data because 2021 data 
is not yet fully available.) The five states 
with the highest per capita murder rate— 
Mississippi, Louisiana, Kentucky, Alabama 
and Missouri—all lean Republican and voted 
for Trump. 
There are some examples of states Biden 
won in 2020 that also have high per capita 
murder rates, including New Mexico and 
Georgia, which have the seventh- and eighth- 
highest murder rates, respectively. And 
there are Trump-supporting states with low 
murder rates, such as Idaho and Utah. Broad-
ly speaking, the South, and to a lesser ex-
tent the Midwest, has more murders per cap-
ita than the Northeast, interior West and 
West Coast, the study found. 
Those findings are consistent with a pat-
tern that has existed for decades, in which 
the South has had higher rates of violent 
crime than the nation as a whole. 
‘‘We as criminologists have known this for 
quite some time,’’ Jennifer Ortiz, a professor 
of criminology at Indiana University South-
east, told Yahoo News. ‘‘States like Mis-
sissippi, Louisiana and Alabama have his-
torically had high crime rates.’’ 
Criminologists say research shows higher 
rates of violent crime are found in areas that 
have low average education levels, high rates 
of poverty and relatively modest access to 
government assistance. Those conditions 
characterize some portions of the American 
South. 
‘‘They are among the poorest states in our 
union,’’ Ortiz said of the Deep South. ‘‘They 
have among the highest rates of child pov-
erty. They are among the least-educated 
states. They are among the states with the 
highest levels of substance abuse. All of 
those factors contribute to people engaging 
in criminal behavior.’’ 
‘‘I thought that was a very good study,’’ 
Richard Rosenfeld, a professor of crimi-
nology at the University of Missouri-St. 
Louis and former president of the American 
Society of Criminology, told Yahoo News 
about the Third Way report. ‘‘In Republican 
states, states with Republican governors, 
crime rates tend to be higher. I’m not cer-
tain that’s related to the fact that the gov-
ernor is a Republican, but it’s a fact none-
theless.’’ 
(While the Third Way study divided states 
by presidential vote in 2020, using guber-
natorial party affiliation leads to similar re-
sults because most states have recently cho-
sen the same party for governor and for 
president. Based on presidential vote, eight 
of the 10 states with the highest murder 
rates lean Republican, versus seven of the 
top 10 if one uses the governor’s party.) 
Although murder rates tend to be highest 
in the South, the biggest increases in 2020 
were found in the Great Plains and Midwest, 
according to Third Way. The largest jumps 
were in Wyoming (91.7 percent higher than in 
2019), South Dakota (69 percent), Wisconsin 
(63.2 percent), Nebraska (59.1 percent) and 
Minnesota (58.1 percent). Wyoming, South 
Dakota and Nebraska all voted for Trump 
and have Republican governors. Wisconsin 
and Minnesota voted for Biden and are led by 
Democrats. 
Few large cities are governed by Repub-
licans—only 26 of the 100 largest U.S. cities 
have Republican mayors—making apples-to- 
apples comparisons difficult. But cities that 
do have Republican mayors do not have 
lower murder rates than similarly sized 
Democratic-led cities, the study found. 
Some experts warn against the impulse to 
use crime data to score quick political 
points. 
‘‘Being a Republican or Democratic state 
or city is correlated with many other 
issues,’’ David Weisburd, a professor of crim-
inology and executive director of the Center 
for Evidence-Based Crime Policy at George 
Mason University, wrote in an email to 
Yahoo News. ‘‘That means that the murder 
rate may be due to the state being Repub-
lican, or it may be due to the fact that Re-
publican states have many other risk factors 
related to crime or murder rates. Even with 
a very comprehensive modeling of all of 
these factors, it is very difficult to get a 
valid causal result for explaining crime 
rates.’’ 
That argument cuts both ways, however. 
Weisburd also thinks the claims of Trump 
and other Republicans who say Democrats 
have caused a crime wave in the cities and 
states they govern are unfounded. ‘‘I don’t 
think this argument can be supported no 
matter which way you go,’’ Weisburd said. 
Murder rates in the U.S. rose dramatically 
in 2020 from record lows, and the increases 
are similar across states—regardless of par-
tisan preference. For homicides in 2020, 
Third Way found a 32.2 percent uptick in 
Trump-backing states versus a 30.8 percent 
rise in those that voted for Biden. Some 
states with large cities, such as New York 
and Pennsylvania, saw larger-than-average 
increases: New York went up 47 percent and 
Pennsylvania is up 39 percent. But the larg-
est increases were in rural, Republican-led 
states, including Montana (+84 percent and 
South Dakota (+81 percent). 
The higher national murder rate is natu-
rally causing public concern, although vio-
lent crime does remain far below its early 
1990s high point. ‘‘Using the FBI data, the 
violent crime rate fell 49 percent between 
1993 and 2019,’’ from 757 incidents per 100,000 
people to 379 per 100,000, the Pew Research 
Center noted last November. Between 2019 
and 2020, the murder rate jumped from 6 
homicides per 100,000 people to 7.8 homicides 
per 100,000, but that was still 22 percent 
below the rate in 1991 of 10 homicides per 
100,000. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, 
Republicans would rather point fingers 
than look in the mirror, but a recent 
study found that the highest murder 
rates are often in conservative, rural 
States. The five States with the high-
est per capita murder rate: Mississippi, 
Louisiana, Kentucky, Alabama, Mis-
souri—all lean Republican. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD the summary of a December 16, 
2021, report from Everytown Research 
& Policy, entitled, ‘‘City Dashboard: 
Murder and Gun Homicide Report.’’ 
[From Everytown Research, Dec. 16, 2021] 
SUMMARY: CITY DASHBOARD: MURDER AND 
GUN HOMICIDE REPORT 
(By Everytown Research & Policy) 
In the midst of one public health epidemic, 
COVID–19, 2021 and 2020 were also two of the 
deadliest years on record for another public 
health crisis—gun violence. The United 
States saw a 33 percent increase from 2019 to 
2020 in the rate of gun homicides. This up-
ward trend continued—but slowed—through 
the end of 2021 during which time there was 
an additional 7 percent increase in gun homi-
cides relative to 2020. 
Due to limited funding and inconsistent 
data collection, data on city gun violence is 
too often old, incomplete, and conflicting 
from one federal agency to another. Below is 
the most recent, available, reliable data on 
murders (firearm and non-firearm) from 2016 
to the first three quarters of 2021 and on gun 
homicides from 2016 to 2020 in nearly 500 cit-
ies. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
will debunk some myths. Chicago, New 
York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco 
do not have the highest gun violence 
rates in the country. 
You don’t measure gun violence rates 
by the raw number. These are big cit-
ies. Of course, they are going to have 
more gun deaths than other places. 
You measure these rates by measuring 
per 100,000 people. When you do that, 
these cities aren’t even in the top 20. 
Jackson, Mississippi; Gary, Indiana; 
St. Louis, Missouri; New Orleans; Mem-
phis—the list goes on and on. Find a 
new talking point. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD a February 28, 2018, piece from 
ABC News entitled, ‘‘Trump calls for 
raising minimum age to buy all guns to 
21.’’ 
[From ABC News, Feb. 28, 2018] 
TRUMP CALLS FOR RAISING MINIMUM AGE TO 
BUY ALL GUNS TO 21 
(By Jordyn Phelps) 
President Trump again called for raising 
the minimum legal age to purchase all guns 
to age 21 during a meeting with lawmakers 
on guns and school safety Wednesday, while 
suggesting that those who are staying silent 
on the topic are ‘‘afraid’’ to come up against 
the NRA, 
‘‘I’m going to give it a lot of consider-
ation,’’ Trump said. ‘‘People aren’t bringing 
it up because they’re afraid to bring it up. 
You can’t buy a handgun at 18, 19 or 20. You 
have to wait until you’re 21. You could buy 
the weapon used in this horrible shooting at 
18. You are going to decide—the people in

this room pretty much—are going to decide. 
I would give very serious thought to it.’’ 
While noting the NRA’s opposition to pro-
posals to raise the minimum age to purchase 
firearms, the president made the case that 
raising the minimum age is common sense. 
‘‘The NRA is opposed to it and I’m a fan of 
the NRA. No bigger fan. I’m a big fan of the 
NRA. These are great people. Great patriots. 
They love our country but that doesn’t mean 
we have to agree on everything,’’ Trump 
said. ‘‘It doesn’t make sense that I have to 
wait till I’m 21 to get a handgun but I can 
get this.’’ 
The president also signaled his support for 
the Manchin-Toomey proposal that was de-
feated back in 2013, and is in the process of 
being reworked, that calls for expanding 
background checks on guns sales to include 
firearms sold at gun shows and on the inter-
net. 
The president suggested that the measure 
failed back in 2013 because President Barack 
Obama was in office at the time, saying 
‘‘that was your problem,’’ in reference to 
Obama. But in fact, Obama backed the bill at 
the time. 
He asked Sen. Pat Toomey, a Pennsylvania 
Republican, if the bill he’s sponsoring with 
Senator Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Demo-
crat, would proposing raising the purchasing 
age for certain guns. 
‘‘We don’t address it,’’ Toomey told the 
president. 
‘‘You know why, because you’re afraid of 
the NRA,’’ the president said in reply. 
Wednesday evening, the NRA responded to 
Trump’s proposals. 
In a statement, spokesperson Jennifer 
Baker said: ‘‘While today’s meeting made for 
great tv, the gun-control proposals discussed 
would make for bad policy that would not 
keep our children safe. Instead of punishing 
law-abiding gun owners for the acts of a de-
ranged lunatic our leaders should pass mean-
ingful reforms that would actually prevent 
future tragedies.’’ 
‘‘They can start by fixing the broken men-
tal health system,’’ her statement contin-
ued, ‘‘strengthening background checks to 
ensure the records of people who are prohib-
ited from possessing firearms are in the 
NICS system, securing our schools and pre-
venting the dangerously mentally ill from 
accessing firearms.’’ 
At the White House meeting, the president 
repeatedly expressed his support for legisla-
tion to improve the nation’s background 
check system but said such a measure should 
not also include a provision to expand con-
cealed carry law to allow people with con-
cealed carry licenses to carry their firearms 
across state line. 
‘‘I’m with you but let it be a separate bill,’’ 
Trump told Louisiana Republican Rep. Steve 
Scalise, who was gunned down during a con-
gressional 
baseball 
practice 
last 
year. 
‘‘You’ll never get this passed if you add con-
cealed carry to this, you’ll never get it 
passed. I don’t think—again, you’ll never get 
it passed. We want to get something done.’’ 
The president also vowed to ban bump 
stocks through executive action, telling the 
lawmakers that the rapid-fire devices are 
‘‘gone.’’ 
‘‘I’m going to write that out. We can do 
that by executive order,’’ the president said, 
noting that ‘‘the lawyers’’ are working on 
the language. 
Last week, Trump said he ordered the Jus-
tice Department to move to ban the rapid- 
fire devices that were used in the Las Vegas 
massacre last year. Bump stocks were not 
used in the Parkland shooting. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, 
the very person that everybody on the 
other side of the aisle is so afraid to 
take on, so frightened of, says that we 
should raise the age to 21. 
Madam Speaker, former President 
Donald Trump said it himself: ‘‘You 
can’t buy a handgun at 18, 19, or 20. 
You have to wait until you’re 21. You 
could buy the weapon,’’ meaning an 
AR–15, ‘‘used in this horrible shooting 
at 18 . . . It doesn’t make sense.’’ 
I mean, come on. Trump said this in 
2018, and these guys here are telling us 
that somehow this is a violation of the 
Constitution? Give me a break. 
We are here to try to save the lives of 
America’s kids. And there should be 
more outrage on the other side of the 
aisle, not the usual talking points that 
we hear over and over and over again 
from the gun lobby. If this isn’t impor-
tant, then nothing is. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
MORELLE), a distinguished member of 
the Committee on Rules. 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Mr. MCGOVERN, my colleague 
and friend, the distinguished chair of 
the Committee on Rules, for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of the rule and the underlying leg-
islation, the Protecting Our Kids Act 
and the Federal Extreme Risk Protec-
tion Order Act. 
It is hard to find words to describe 
the despair we feel in the wake of the 
recent series of senseless mass shoot-
ings in Buffalo, Uvalde, Tulsa, and too 
many neighborhoods across our coun-
try. For the sake of the victims, their 
families, and all Americans, we cannot 
rest until we put an end to this vicious 
cycle. 
Madam Speaker, there have been 
more than 200 mass shootings already 
in 2022. That is more shootings than 
there have been days of the year. And 
according to a recent analysis pub-
lished in the New England Journal of 
Medicine, firearm deaths have now re-
placed motor vehicle accidents as the 
leading cause of death for children in 
this country. I know the insurmount-
able pain of losing a child all too well, 
but losing a child to something en-
tirely avoidable, that is a uniquely dev-
astating kind of tragedy. 
Madam Speaker, June is gun violence 
awareness month, but we are already 
painfully, brutally aware. What we 
need now is action. That is why this 
week we are passing legislation to 
strengthen red flag laws, raise the age 
for semiautomatic gun purchases, ban 
bump stocks and high-capacity maga-
zines, and promote safe storage of fire-
arms. 
This builds on action we have already 
taken to enact universal background 
checks and marks a critical step for-
ward in keeping dangerous weapons out 
of the wrong hands. 
In the midst of so much pain and suf-
fering, it is astonishing that there are 
those who still refuse to act. If my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
are not willing to be part of the solu-
tion, then please, please, please, stand 
aside so you are not part of the prob-
lem. 
Madam Speaker, it doesn’t stop here. 
I will continue pushing to ban assault 
weapons, combat gun trafficking so we 
can put a stop to this devastating and 
maddening cycle of violence. Because 
the absolute worst thing we can do is 
nothing at all. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 to the gentleman from Wis-
consin (Mr. TIFFANY). 
b 1300 
Mr. TIFFANY. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to oppose the previous question so 
that the House can consider the Pros-
ecutors Need to Prosecute Act. 
Madam Speaker, it is no secret that 
crime is out of control in this country. 
Annual homicide records have been 
broken in at least a dozen major cities. 
Brazen smash-and-grab robberies in 
broad daylight are a daily occurrence. 
Killing, severe beatings, armed rob-
beries, carjackings, sexual assaults, 
arson, and looting have become a com-
mon feature on the evening news. 
Yet, rogue prosecutors in cities like 
Los Angeles, San Francisco, Philadel-
phia, New York City, and Milwaukee 
continue to release predators from cus-
tody almost as fast as the police can 
arrest them. 
The use of no-cash bail policies, plea 
bargains, and a complete refusal to put 
dangerous repeat offenders behind bars 
has demoralized our police and endan-
gered our communities, and America’s 
most iconic cities resemble a Third 
World country. 
I will give you an example in my 
home State. In Milwaukee County, we 
witnessed back at Christmas a mas-
sacre at the Waukesha County Christ-
mas Parade, 6 people dead, 60 injured. 
How? With a guy that had a rap sheet 
that had felonies, misdemeanors, statu-
tory rape, resisting arrest, and stran-
gulation, and he was out on $1,000 bail. 
Here is the worst part, though: That 
district attorney, John Chisholm in 
Milwaukee County, here is what he 
said years ago about his philosophy. 
‘‘Is there going to be an individual I di-
vert, or I put into treatment program, 
who is going to go out and kill some-
body? You bet. Guaranteed. It is guar-
anteed to happen. It does not invali-
date the overall approach.’’ 
That is what we have for district at-
torneys around the United States. 
Americans are sick and tired of the 
lawlessness, and they are demanding 
accountability. 
Madam Speaker, each year, jurisdic-
tions across the United States benefit 
from the Edward Byrne Memorial Jus-
tice Assistance Grant program, which 
provides funding to States, Tribes, and 
local governments to support a range 
of justice-related programs. 
If we defeat the previous question, I 
will offer an amendment to the rule, 
calling for immediate consideration of 
the Prosecutors Need to Prosecute Act. 
It would, among other things, mandate 
that district attorneys report to Con-
gress on how often they follow through, 
holding criminals charged with violent

crimes,

They would also be required to dis-
close how often they prosecute the ini-
tial charges, how often they secure 
convictions, 
whether or not those 
charged were already on probation or 
parole, and how many offenders were 
released without bail. 
Madam Speaker, the American peo-
ple need to know if the people they 
have entrusted to keep their neighbor-
hoods safe are actually using their tax 
dollars to finance this crime wave. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 10 seconds to the 
gentleman. 
Mr. TIFFANY. It is time to end the 
policy of underwriting progressive poli-
cies that endanger the lives and liveli-
hoods of decent, hardworking Ameri-
cans, and that starts with trans-
parency. 
I urge my colleagues to stand with us 
for safer communities and oppose the 
previous question. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO). 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of the rule, which would 
deem and pass a resolution condemning 
great replacement theory and white su-
premacy. 
The recent mass shooting in Buffalo, 
New York, that claimed the lives of 10 
Americans was committed by a self-de-
scribed white supremacist who ref-
erenced great replacement theory in a 
manifesto. 
The perpetuation of xenophobia, rac-
ism, and anti-Semitism by rightwing 
extremists who believe in a grand con-
spiracy theory that minorities, some-
how facilitated by Jews, are actively 
seeking to diminish the political and 
cultural power of White voters must be 
condemned. 
Notably absent is the condemnation 
of our leaders on the right, who refuse 
to speak out against this senseless vio-
lence and call it what it is: hate speech 
meant to divide us and not unite us. 
This departure from logic and reason, 
and cozying up to fear, is leading peo-
ple to violence and extremism in com-
munities all across this country, and it 
must be stopped. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. BURGESS). 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
We learned in the Rules Committee 
yesterday—in fact, the gentlewoman 
from Minnesota pointed out—how Re-
publicans had little opportunity to pro-
vide any input into these bills that are 
going to be provided for in this rule. 
Unfortunately, the Speaker has no in-
terest in involving half of the Rep-
resentatives in this country in address-
ing an issue we all care about: Keeping 
Americans safe. 
Yesterday, in the Rules Committee, 
it was stated that Republicans vote 
against all mental health bills. I don’t 
know where that concept comes from. 
Republicans passed into law the 21st 
Century Cures Act, which represents 
the most significant reform to the 
mental health system in several dec-
ades. 
Republicans have also taken steps to 
reform the National Instant Criminal 
Background Check System with the so- 
called Fix NICS Act of 2017, which im-
proved reporting to the database. 
Unfortunately, we also know the De-
partment of Justice inspector general 
reported that only 1 percent of individ-
uals who try to purchase a firearm ille-
gally, and it is known they are trying 
to purchase a firearm illegally, are 
prosecuted. 
So, I have introduced a bill, H.R. 194, 
to require the Department of Justice to 
recommence this reporting to Congress 
so that Congress can have a better idea 
of how many guns exist illegally in 
commerce and, ultimately, to ensure 
that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, 
Firearms and Explosives recovers these 
illegal firearms. 
Republicans would have also engaged 
on the issue of the age of purchase, but 
honestly, as brought up by Representa-
tive MASSIE yesterday during the Rules 
Committee hearing, let’s examine all 
the data points to determine whether 
the age for law enforcement officers, 
military service, and the Selective 
Service should also be considered. But 
that was not on the table. 
Then, as if to underscore just how 
partisan and one-sided this rule is 
today, there is a provision in the rule 
that deems a $1.6 trillion budget reso-
lution for fiscal year 2023. Madam 
Speaker, I am a member of the Budget 
Committee, and during the Rules Com-
mittee hearing yesterday was the first 
time I heard about this budget resolu-
tion. It is a 9 percent increase over fis-
cal year 2022 and $21 billion over Presi-
dent Biden’s fiscal year 2023 budget 
proposal. 
We have a problem with inflation in 
this country. We have a problem with 
inflation because the Federal Govern-
ment and congressional Democrats and 
the Biden administration are over-
spending what the economy can tol-
erate. Yet, here we are, adding a 9 per-
cent increase on a resolution that is 
deemed passed when the rule is voted 
on. We don’t even get to debate the 
pros and cons in the committee. It is 
just deemed passed when the rule is 
passed. I have to ask: When will this 
partisan policymaking end? 
Half the country represented by Re-
publicans deserve—and we have a man-
date from our constituents—to be part 
of the legislative process. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Let me remind everybody that 21 
people were killed in Uvalde, 19 chil-
dren. Ten people were killed in Buffalo. 
I say that because I think my col-
leagues need to be reminded about why 
we are here today, not to talk about 
the budget, but to talk about saving 
lives. 
I also remind them that the shooter 
in Buffalo and the shooter in Uvalde 
went in and legally purchased an AR–15 
at 18 years old. 
Our bill that we are talking about 
here today would have prevented that. 
Whatever they are doing for the pre-
vious question—I don’t know what it 
is—would not. 
I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Pennsylvania (Ms. SCANLON), a 
member of the Rules Committee. 
Ms. 
SCANLON. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
since the Judiciary Committee marked 
up the Protecting Our Kids Act last 
Thursday, dozens more Americans have 
been killed or wounded in shootings, 
including in Philadelphia. 
Saturday night was a beautiful sum-
mer evening in the South Street enter-
tainment district when a fistfight 
broke out. It ended with 3 deaths and 11 
injured after multiple people pulled 
guns and fired into the bustling crowd. 
Most of those gun owners were licensed 
to carry. One had a ghost gun, which, 
of course, is the subject of our legisla-
tion today. 
The point is that the current ap-
proach to gun violence in this country, 
which has encouraged a flood of guns 
to our streets, is not working. We need 
to do more, and we need to do it now. 
This isn’t about being progun or 
antigun. Gun violence is not a partisan 
issue. It is a sickness infecting this en-
tire country. 
Whether Philadelphia, Uvalde, Tulsa, 
Buffalo, or anywhere else in between, 
none of us should sit idly by and watch 
preventable gun deaths happen every 
single day, and I know that I, for one, 
cannot. 
We are not helpless. We can change 
this. The needle on this issue has 
moved, and it is not going back. The 
only question is whether Republican 
Members of Congress and the Senate 
will listen to their constituents or the 
NRA. 
Our fellow Americans are demanding 
action. There is nothing unconstitu-
tional about the bills we consider 
today, and they will help stop the rou-
tine slaughter of children, neighbors, 
teachers, doctors, and seniors in our 
schools, neighborhoods, churches, tem-
ples, mosques, and supermarkets. 
I refuse to tell our children that they 
must be sacrificial lambs to a radical, 
twisted 
theory 
of 
armed 
Second 
Amendment liberty that is decoupled 
from personal responsibility and re-
fuses to recognize the overriding pur-
poses of the Constitution, to ensure do-
mestic tranquility and promote the 
general welfare, and that also refuses 
to recognize that there are constitu-
tional limits to the Second Amend-
ment. Our Constitution is not a suicide 
pact. 
Our children know as well as we do 
that we can do something. We have the 
power to pass this bill, and we must. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5357 
June 8, 2022 
My colleague from Massachusetts 
continues to use his talking points and 
mentions the gun lobby, and I want to 
point out that I hear from many of my 
constituents who are law-abiding gun 
owners and who are extremely con-
cerned and oppose this bill. 
As a matter of fact, I met with a 
group of students from my district this 
morning who oppose this legislation. 
Even students know that this bill will 
do nothing to stop gun violence, but 
they do understand it will trample Sec-
ond Amendment rights. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. 
SMITH). 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Missouri. 
Madam 
Speaker, today’s rule is an all-too-fa-
miliar pattern of the legislative lazi-
ness from my Democrat colleagues. 
Once again, Washington Democrats 
are hiding their spending from the 
American people. They are smuggling 
their spending levels for the upcoming 
appropriations process into a rule for a 
totally unrelated bill so they don’t 
have to debate or defend their out-of- 
control spending habits. 
Last year, Democrats did the exact 
same thing. The chairman of the Budg-
et Committee drafts a spending resolu-
tion; he skips over his committee; and 
then they toss it into a rule, hoping no 
one notices. 
At no point in the last 4 years of the 
majority have House Democrats actu-
ally marked up a budget in the Budget 
Committee. Time and again, House 
Democrats have acted with as little 
sunlight as possible because they don’t 
want to be held accountable for their 
record. 
Americans know that Washington 
spending is driving inflation, and now 
Democrats are calling for even more. 
Last year alone, House Democrats 
voted for $7.5 trillion in new spending, 
including the $2 trillion so-called res-
cue plan that ignited the highest infla-
tion in four decades. 
Since President Biden took office and 
one-party Democrat control of Con-
gress took over in Washington, infla-
tion is up 11 percent. Gas prices are up 
110 percent on their watch. President 
Biden’s 2021 deficit was the second 
highest in history, $517 billion more 
than the CBO said it should have been. 
Democrats don’t want to debate 
budgets. They certainly don’t want to 
debate the President’s budget, which 
would spend $73 trillion over the next 
decade, a 66 percent increase over the 
past decade. It would add $16 trillion in 
new debt with well over $1 trillion an-
nual deficits every year. 
Democrats don’t want to talk about 
budgets because they are spending like 
they simply don’t exist. If Democrats 
won’t show their cards, allow me. The 
resolution that is tucked away in this 
rule has over $1.6 trillion in discre-
tionary spending next year, a $132 bil-
lion, or 9 percent, increase over the 
most recent fiscal year 2022 omnibus. It 
is $21 billion more in spending than 
even Biden’s budget proposal. 
Instead of hiding, I urge my col-
leagues to be crystal clear with the 
American people about exactly what 
they have in store for them: tax in-
creases, high inflation, open borders, 
energy dependence, and an ever-grow-
ing mountain of debt. 
b 1315 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, you got to be kid-
ding me. The gentleman from Missouri 
comes down here for 3 minutes and un-
loads on everybody here about a tech-
nical provision that doesn’t even spend 
any money. It is a technical provision 
to allow us to go forward with our ap-
propriations work. 
Not a mention of the children who 
were killed in Uvalde or the people who 
were killed in Buffalo—not a mention. 
What the hell is wrong with this place? 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD—since the gentleman didn’t 
have the dignity to acknowledge those 
who were killed—the names of those 
who were murdered in Uvalde and Buf-
falo.

Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
will respond to the gentlewoman from 
Minnesota. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD this Business Insider article 
entitled ‘‘Host Republican leaders told 
their Members to vote against eight 
gun-safety bills, citing opposition from 
the NRA and Gun Owners of America.’’ 
[From Insider, June 8, 2022] 
HOUSE
REPUBLICAN
LEADERS
TOLD
THEIR 
MEMBERS TO VOTE AGAINST 8 GUN-SAFETY 
BILLS, CITING OPPOSITION FROM THE NRA 
AND GUN OWNERS OF AMERICA 
(By Bryan Metzger) 
House Republicans are poised to vote 
against eight bills aimed at preventing gun 
violence on Tuesday, in part due to opposi-
tion from powerful pro-gun groups on the 
right. 
House Democratic leaders have scheduled 
votes for Wednesday evening on the ‘‘Pro-
tecting Our Kids Act’’—a package of seven 
gun violence-related measures that includes 
raising the age for legal purchase of semi-
automatic rifles and shotguns to 21, closing 
the ‘‘bump stock’’ loophole, and other meas-
ures aimed at preventing the illegal traf-
ficking of guns. 
The House will also vote on the ‘‘Federal 
Extreme Risk Protection Order Act,’’ a fed-
eral ‘‘red flag’’ bill that would allow family 
members and law enforcement officials to 
temporarily block firearm access to those 
who a court determines pose a danger to 
themselves or others. 
In a ‘‘whip notice’’ sent to rank-and-file 
members on Tuesday afternoon, House GOP 
leadership urged a ‘‘no’’ vote on all eight 
bills, referring to the seven-bill package as 
the 
‘‘Unconstitutional 
Gun 
Restrictions 
Act.’’ They wrote that House Democrats had 
‘‘thrown together this reactionary package 
comprised of legislation that egregiously 
violates law-abiding citizens’ 2nd Amend-
ment rights and hinders Americans’ ability 
to defend and protect themselves and their 
families.’’ 
The email also noted the opposition of the 
National Rifle Association and Gun Owners 
of America, including links to talking points 
from the NRA about both the gun package 
and the red flag law. Leaders also noted the 
opposition of Heritage Action for America, 
an advocacy group tied to the conservative 
Heritage Foundation. 
‘‘Due to the importance of this issue, votes 
on this legislation will be considered in fu-
ture candidate ratings and endorsements by 
the NRA Political Victory Fund,’’ declares 
one of the memos shared by party leaders. 
It’s not uncommon for party leaders to 
note the opposition of outside groups to 
major pieces of legislation. For example, in a 
February whip notice urging Republicans to 
vote against a major piece of legislation 
aimed at boosting the US semiconductor in-
dustry, GOP leaders noted the opposition of 
the Federation for American Immigration 
Reform, National Taxpayers Union, and 
Americans for Prosperity. 
But the two gun groups’ inclusion—and the 
NRA’s threat to downgrade candidate rat-
ings or withhold endorsements should any 
Republicans back the measures—underscores 
the enduring influence of pro-second amend-
ment groups on the right, despite the NRA’s 
recent 
financial 
troubles 
and 
shrinking 
membership. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. RASKIN), a member of 
the Rules Committee. 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, the 
blood bath continues. Gun violence has 
now become the number one cause of 
death of children in the United States. 
We have rates of gun violence and gun 
deaths 20 times higher than any other 
industrialized nations like France, the 
United Kingdom, Japan, and Israel. No 
other nation comes close to what we 
are seeing. That is 200 percent higher 
than our peer countries.

The American people want change 
and action, but the minority invites us 
to believe that the bloody carnage pil-
ing up around the country from Buffalo 
to Uvalde, from Newtown to Las Vegas 
is a necessary feature of our Second 
Amendment. 
We are invited to believe that all of 
the lost sons, daughters, mothers, fa-
thers, brothers, and sisters of America 
are the necessary collateral damage of 
their fidelity to the Second Amend-
ment. 
Our family members must be sac-
rificed to a completely false vision of 
the Second Amendment. It is a lie. It is 
a 
lie 
based 
on 
a 
totally 
bogus 
misreading of the Second Amendment 
and what the Supreme Court has actu-
ally said about it. 
Read Justice Scalia in Heller v. Dis-
trict of Columbia. No, he says, the 
right to guns is not an unlimited right. 
No, he says, the Second Amendment 
right is not a right to keep and carry 
any weapon whatsoever, in any manner 
whatsoever, and for whatever purpose. 
No. 
The Second Amendment is not the 
only right in the Bill of Rights that is 
not subject to reasonable regulation in 
the interest of public safety and public 
security. He specifically upheld reason-
able gun safety regulations, including 
bans on carrying a concealed weapon, 
the possession of firearms by felons and 
other people who shouldn’t have guns; 
laws forbidding carrying firearms in 
schools and government buildings; laws 
imposing conditions and qualifications 
on the sale and purchase of firearms. 
Stop 
hiding 
behind 
the 
Second 
Amendment. Take responsibility for 
your irresponsible position. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to direct their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, we already have gun 
laws in this country and yet those laws 
continue to be broken. If Democrats 
want to talk about common sense, how 
about we talk about enforcing the laws 
that already exist. 
Communities across the country are 
making it clear that they want people 
who commit crimes to be prosecuted to 
the fullest extent of the law; yet, lib-
eral prosecutors are letting criminals 
go free with minimal punishment. This 
is not woke. This is dangerous. 
Criminals need to be held account-
able for their actions, and that is why 
we offered the PQ we did. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, the gentlewoman 
mentioned our gun laws, and just to 
demonstrate the absurdity of the gun 
laws that are in place, I include in the 
RECORD
the Texas Parks & Wildlife 
‘‘Migratory Game Bird Hunting Meth-
ods’’ list of regulations, which is valid 
September 1, 2021 through August 31, 
2022. 
[From the Texas Parks & Wildlife, Sept. 1, 
2021] 
MIGRATORY GAME BIRD HUNTING METHODS 
(By Texas Parks & Wildlife) 
HARVEST INFORMATION PROGRAM (HIP) 
No person shall hunt migratory game birds 
in this state unless that person is HIP-cer-
tified in Texas. The federally-mandated Har-
vest Information Program (HIP) improves 
harvest information for all migratory game 
birds. Hunters who buy a Migratory Game 
Bird Hunting Endorsement, including Super 
Combos, will be asked a few simple questions 
about their migratory bird hunting activi-
ties. 
Please report Migratory Game Bird bands. 
Check migratory game birds harvested (espe-
cially doves) for leg bands and report them 
to reportband.gov. 
MEANS AND METHODS 
Shotguns, lawful archery equipment, fal-
conry, dogs, artificial decoys, and manual or 
mouth-operated bird calls are legal. 
A shotgun is the only legal firearm for 
hunting migratory game birds. Shotguns 
must not be larger than 10-gauge, must be 
fired from the shoulder, and must be incapa-
ble of holding more than three shells. Shot-
guns capable of holding more than three 
shells must be plugged with a one-piece filler 
which cannot be removed without disassem-
bling the gun, so the gun’s total capacity 
does not exceed three shells. 
Hunting is permitted in the open or from a 
blind or other type of concealment or from 
floating craft or motor boat provided that all 
motion resulting from sail or motor has 
ceased. Sails must be furled and motor 
turned off before shooting starts. 
A craft under power may be used to re-
trieve dead or crippled birds; however, crip-
pled birds may not be shot from such craft 
under power. 
No person, while hunting waterfowl any-
where in the state, may possess shotgun 
shells containing lead shot or loose lead shot 
for use in muzzleloaders. Approved shot in-
cludes steel (including copper, nickel or zinc- 
coated steel), bismuth-tin, tungsten-iron, 
tungsten-polymer (e.g. moly-shot), and any 
other nontoxic material approved by the Di-
rector of the USFWS. 
BAITING REGULATIONS 
Directly or indirectly placing, exposing, 
depositing, distributing or scattering of salt, 
grain, or other feed that could serve as a lure 
or attraction for migratory game birds to, on 
or over areas where hunters are attempting 
to take them is prohibited by federal law. 
Hunters are responsible for knowing whether 
an area is baited or not. 
For further information on federal regula-
tion regarding baiting: 
USFWS Dove Hunting and Baiting. 
USFWS Waterfowl Hunting and Baiting. 
A hunter may hunt migratory game birds 
including waterfowl, coots and sandhill 
cranes: 
on or over standing crops, standing flooded 
crops and flooded harvested crops; 
over natural vegetation that has been ma-
nipulated; 
on or over a normal soil stabilization prac-
tice that is defined as a planting for agricul-
tural soil erosion control or post-mining 
land reclamation conducted in accordance 
with official recommendations of State Ex-
tension Specialists of the Cooperative Exten-
sion Service of the U.S. Department of Agri-
culture (USDA); 
on or over lands or areas where seeds or 
grains have been scattered solely as a result 
of a normal agricultural practice which is 
defined as a planting, harvesting or post-har-
vest manipulation conducted in accordance 
with official recommendations of State Ex-
tension Specialists of the Cooperative Exten-
sion Service of the USDA. Does not include 
the brocast spreading of seed that is nor-
mally drill-planted; 
over crops or natural vegetation where 
grain has been inadvertently scattered as a 
result of entering or leaving a hunting area, 
placing decoys or retrieving downed birds; 
using natural vegetation or crops to con-
ceal a blind, provided that if crops are used 
to conceal a blind, no grain or other feed is 
exposed, deposited, distributed or scattered 
in the process. 
A person may hunt doves over planted 
crops that have been manipulated for the 
purpose of hunting. Waterfowl and sandhill 
cranes may not be hunted where grain or 
feed has been distributed or scattered as a 
result of manipulation or livestock feeding. 
UNLAWFUL ACTIVITIES 
It is unlawful to: 
hunt migratory birds with the aid of bait, 
or on or over any baited area; 
hunt over any baited area until 10 days 
after all baiting materials have been re-
moved and a game warden has confirmed re-
moval of baiting materials; 
place or allow the placement of bait on or 
adjacent to any area where migratory game 
birds could be attracted for the purpose of 
hunting migratory game birds by any per-
son; 
hunt waterfowl or sandhill cranes over ma-
nipulated planted millet in the first year 
after planting; 
hunt waterfowl or sandhill cranes over 
crops that have been manipulated, unless the 
manipulation is a normal agricultural post- 
harvesting manipulation in accordance with 
official recommendations of State Extension 
Specialists of the Cooperative Extension 
Service of the USDA; 
use any firearm other than a legal shot-
gun; use a trap, snare, net, fishhook, poison, 
drug, explosive or stupefying substance; use 
live birds as decoys; use recorded or elec-
tronically amplified bird calls or sounds; or 
use a sinkbox; 
hunt from or by means of motor vehicles 
or aircraft of any kind (including stationary) 
except paraplegics and single or double am-
putees of legs may hunt from stationary 
motor-driven conveyances; 
use motor-driven land, water or air con-
veyances or sailboats to concentrate, drive, 
rally or stir up any migratory game bird; or 
hunt where tame or captive live ducks or 
geese are present unless such birds are or 
have been for a period of 10 consecutive days 
prior to such taking confined within an en-
closure which substantially reduces the audi-
bility of their calls and totally conceals such 
birds from the sight of wild migratory game 
birds. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, 
shotguns used for duck hunting can’t 
hold more than three shells. Let me re-
peat: In order to protect the duck pop-
ulation in Texas, shotguns cannot hold 
more than three shells. Imagine if our 
Republican friends could muster the 
same courage to protect America’s 
children. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
HIGGINS). 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in support of the 
rule for the House to consider common-
sense measures to protect our commu-
nities and our kids from massacres 
caused by weapons of mass destruction.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5359 
June 8, 2022 
In Buffalo, on May 14, the shooting 
started at 2:30 in the afternoon. In 2 
minutes and 3 seconds it was over: 10 
people were killed, 3 injured, 11 African 
Americans, 1 shooter with a weapon of 
mass destruction. 
I don’t want anybody’s guns, but we 
should at least be able to be supportive 
of background checks to ensure that 
people that shouldn’t have a gun pos-
sess a gun. That uplifts the integrity of 
gun ownership by taking a responsible 
position and does nothing relative to 
constitutional rights, and represents a 
collective responsibility. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, why are we here de-
bating legislation we know will never 
become law, and when there are—com-
pletely separate from this proposal—bi-
partisan efforts going on in the Senate? 
We know this is not a genuine effort by 
the Democrats as they went right to 
extremes of what they know will divide 
this country, and would not work with 
Republicans or accept any of the rea-
sonable amendments that were put for-
ward in committee. 
This is a political ploy being put on 
by the Democrats for them to use as 
talking points, and it is at the expense 
of a tragedy and the heartache of so 
many across this country. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Massachusetts (Mrs. TRAHAN). 
Mrs. 
TRAHAN. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
many of us in this Chamber have young 
children. For us, today’s vote comes 
down to simple questions: Can you as a 
mom or dad imagine getting a call that 
your child’s school was locked down be-
cause of an active shooter? Can you 
imagine standing helplessly behind a 
police line as gunshots are fired near 
your daughter’s classroom? Can you 
imagine having to identify the unrec-
ognizable body of your missing baby 
boy by his favorite shoes? Can you 
imagine standing in line for a DNA test 
praying to God that it does not come 
back a match? 
I ask those questions because that is 
what 19 families in Uvalde just had to 
do. That is their reality and it has been 
the reality for 14 families in Parkland, 
20 families in Sandy Hook, 12 families 
in Columbine, and the list goes on. 
If you imagine that reality, then do 
today what should have been done 25 
years ago. Pass the legislation so no 
parent in America ever experiences 
this horrific reality again. Our children 
are counting on us and they are watch-
ing. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Michigan (Ms. TLAIB). 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, it is in-
humane, colleagues, to allow the kill-
ing of children. I do have one more 
question for so many that I have asked 
over and over again: Is doing nothing 
really going to save lives? Is it going to 
actually result in change? How many 
more of our children have to die? 
How many more school children’s lit-
tle pink shoes will be left behind 
stained with blood before some of the 
electeds in this room put the lives of 
people ahead of the profits of their po-
litical donors? 
In my district, in River Rouge, a 6- 
year-old girl was caught in a crossfire 
and shot by a high-powered assault 
rifle. 
The measures in the Protecting Our 
Kids package that we are set to vote on 
today is essential and it does save 
lives. Let’s just be very clear though: 
Our kids need way more than this. 
They need an assault weapon ban. They 
need far stricter regulations on hand-
guns and bold initiatives to reduce the 
number of firearms in our commu-
nities. 
Most of all, they need accountability 
from us—from all of us. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield the gentlewoman an additional 15 
seconds. 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, they 
need accountability from those of us 
who are enabling the mass murder of 
millions of Americans so they can prof-
it from our pain, and that the people 
that enable their slaughter-for-profit 
scheme are here in our government. 
Madam Speaker, I look forward to 
supporting this and so much more be-
cause our kids deserve it. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, we 
have no further requests for time on 
our side, and I am ready to close. I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, these bills are not 
about keeping kids and communities 
safe from violent criminals, they are 
about furthering a blanket anti-gun 
agenda. This is one-size-fits-all gun re-
striction legislation that would punish 
law-abiding gun owners and fail to im-
prove public safety. My colleagues on 
the left know it. 
This was not a bipartisan effort and 
these bills will never make it through 
the Senate. With very real problems to 
solve, why are Democrats wasting pre-
cious time on something that will 
never make it into law? If Democrats 
were serious about addressing gun vio-
lence, they would engage in meaningful 
conversation about public safety in-
stead of this agenda-driven political 
theater. 
The sad fact is that the Democrats’ 
approach demonstrates that these bills 
and the issue of gun violence on the 
whole are nothing more than political 
talking points in an election year. This 
is designed to advance the radical 
Democrat base that believes no private 
citizen should ever be able to own a 
gun. 
They should be ashamed of them-
selves for putting us through this polit-
ical show rather than working with Re-
publicans on a bipartisan solution to 
gun violence. 
Madam Speaker, I oppose the rule 
and I ask Members to do the same. I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, 
how much time do I have remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 21⁄4 minutes. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
include in the RECORD Newsweek’s May 
27, 2022, article entitled ‘‘More Children 
Have Been Shot Dead in 2022 Than Po-
lice in the Line of Duty.’’ 
[From Newsweek, May 27, 2022] 
MORE CHILDREN HAVE BEEN SHOT DEAD IN 
2022 THAN POLICE IN THE LINE OF DUTY 
(By Gerrard Kaonga) 
More children have been shot and killed in 
the U.S. this year than police while on duty, 
according to new data. 
The Officer Down Memorial Page website 
records the death of police officers across the 
country and honors them for their service. 
As well as showing a picture of the de-
ceased officer, it also shows where they were 
stationed, the date of their death and the 
cause. 
According to the website, in 2022, 20 offi-
cers have been killed after being involved in 
a shooting. 
In comparison, in 2022, 24 students have 
been killed as a result of shootings at school, 
according to data collected by Education 
Week. 
‘‘School shootings, terrifying to students, 
educators, parents and communities, always 
reignite polarizing debates about gun rights 
and school safety,’’ the Education Week re-
port read. 
‘‘To bring context to these debates, Edu-
cation Week journalists began tracking 
shootings on K–12 school property that re-
sulted in firearm-related injuries or deaths.’’ 
According to the Education Week report, 
there have been 27 school shootings in 2022 
and 119 in total since 2018, when they began 
tracking such incidents. 
The Robb Elementary School shooting, 
which resulted in 21 people being killed—19 
children and two adult staff, lifted the num-
ber of children killed in school shootings 
above the number of police officers shot dead 
in the line of duty. 
The other school shootings that brought 
the total number to 24 deaths included an at-
tack at Tanglewood Middle School, Green-
ville, South Carolina, on March 31. 
A 12–year old student was shot and killed 
at the school. At the time, this was the 
youngest age a student had been killed in a 
school shooting in 2022. 
Another incident that contributed was the 
Eisenhower High School shooting, Yakima, 
Washington, on March 15, that resulted in 
one student being killed and another injured. 
There was also a shooting at East High 
School in Des Moines, Iowa, on March 7 that 
resulted in a 15-year-old boy being killed and 
two female students getting injured. 
The second shooting of 2022 that resulted 
in a fatality of a student was at the South 
Education Center, Richfield, Minnesota, on 
February 1. 
LARGE NUMBER OF SCHOOL SHOOTINGS 
A shooting outside the South Education 
Center left a 15–year-old student dead and a 
17–year-old student critically wounded. 
The first incident of 2022 that resulted in a 
student’s death was at Oliver Citywide Acad-
emy, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on Janu-
ary 19. This resulted in a 15–year-old boy

being shot and killed as he waited to go 
home. 
President Joe Biden addressed the issue in 
a speech on Tuesday and said it was time 
America stood up to the gun manufacturing 
industry. Biden also reflected on the fre-
quency of mass shootings in America in his 
speech. 
‘‘It’s been 3,448 days—10 years since I stood 
up at a high school in Connecticut—a grade 
school in Connecticut, where another gun-
man massacred 26 people, including 20 first- 
graders, at Sandy Hook Elementary School,’’ 
he said. 
‘‘Since then, there have been over 900 inci-
dents of gunfire reported on school grounds. 
Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School in 
Parkland, Florida. Santa Fe High School in 
Texas. Oxford High School in Michigan. The 
list goes on and on,’’ Biden said. ‘‘And the 
list grows when it includes mass shootings at 
places like movie theaters, houses of wor-
ship, and, as we saw just 10 days ago, at a 
grocery store in Buffalo, New York.’’ 
‘‘I am sick and tired of it. We have to act. 
And don’t tell me we can’t have an impact 
on this carnage,’’ Biden said. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the remainder of my time. 
Madam Speaker, will the bills before 
us pass the Senate? I sure as hell hope 
so. None of these proposals are ex-
treme. Quite the opposite. In fact, they 
are what the vast majority of people in 
this country—Democrats, Republicans, 
Independents—want us to do. Maybe 
they will get changed in the Senate. 
Even if our Senate colleagues do not 
take up these exact bills, I will tell you 
what this process we are going through 
will absolutely do and why our efforts 
here are worthwhile. 
This process will unequivocally show 
where each and every one of us stand in 
the wake of this unspeakable tragedy. 
More importantly, it will demonstrate 
which of the solutions we are putting 
forward have majority support in this 
half of the Congress. 
As our Senate colleagues discuss gun 
violence solutions, they will have no 
doubt as to where the House of Rep-
resentatives stands on red flag laws; 
raising the age to purchase a semiauto-
matic rifle from 18 to 21; gun traf-
ficking and straw purchases; ghost 
guns; safe storage of firearms, particu-
larly when a minor is likely to gain ac-
cess; bump stocks; and large-capacity 
magazines. 
We will have separate votes on all of 
these issues. This is on top of the back-
ground check bill and the Charleston 
loophole bills we have already sent 
them. 
b 1330 
This week there will be no excuses. 
We will vote on these ideas one issue at 
a time. None of these proposals are 
aimed at taking guns away from law- 
abiding citizens. They are aimed at 
stopping people from getting slaugh-
tered in their schools, in their church-
es, in grocery stores, and in their 
homes. These ideas won’t solve every 
problem or stop every shooting, but no 
sane person can come to the conclusion 
that these proposals would not save 
lives. 
I know that things like background 
checks and waiting until you are 21 to 
buy an AR–15 and smaller magazine ca-
pacity may seem like an inconvenience 
to some people. But when stacked up 
against the carnage we have seen in 
this country, I think we can all live 
with a little inconvenience. 
Madam Speaker, I cannot be any 
clearer. These bills will keep people 
from dying, but only if they become 
law or if similar bills become law. 
I know that everybody hates Con-
gress. Hell, I even hate Congress some-
times. But, Madam Speaker, don’t lis-
ten to the NRA or extremists on this 
bill. Vote your conscience. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote 
on the rule and the previous question. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mrs. FISCHBACH is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 1153 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 8. Immediately upon adoption of this 
resolution, the House shall proceed to the 
consideration in the House of the bill (H.R. 
7967) to amend the Omnibus Crime Control 
and Safe Streets Act to direct district attor-
ney and prosecutors offices to report to the 
Attorney General, and for other purposes. 
All points of order against consideration of 
the bill are waived. The bill shall be consid-
ered as read. All points of order against pro-
visions in the bill are waived. The previous 
question shall be considered as ordered on 
the bill and on any amendment thereto to 
final passage without intervening motion ex-
cept: (1) one hour of debate equally divided 
and controlled by the chair and ranking mi-
nority member of the Committee on the Ju-
diciary; and (2) one motion to recommit. 
SEC. 9. Clause l(c) of rule XIX shall not 
apply to the consideration of H.R. 7967. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time, and 
I move the previous question on the 
resolution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on ordering the previous 
question. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, 
on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, the 
Chair will reduce to 5 minutes the min-
imum time for any electronic vote on 
the question of adoption of the resolu-
tion. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 217, nays 
205, not voting 5, as follows:

AND 
RE-
AFFIRMING THE HOUSE OF REP-
RESENTATIVES COMMITMENT TO 
COMBATING WHITE SUPREMACY, 
HATRED, AND RACIAL INJUSTICE 
Pursuant to section 6 of House Reso-
lution 1153, H. Res. 1152 is adopted. 
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 1152 
Whereas, on May 14, 2022, in Buffalo, New 
York, 10 Americans were killed and 3 were 
injured by a self-described White suprema-
cist who drove more than 200 miles to carry 
out this racist, violent mass shooting with 
an assault-style rifle at a supermarket in a 
predominantly Black neighborhood; 
Whereas the self-described White suprema-
cist and antisemite who allegedly carried 
out this racially motivated, anti-Black mas-
sacre with a firearm reportedly wrote a 
manifesto citing the White supremacist 
Great Replacement Theory; 
Whereas the alleged gunman livestreamed 
the mass shooting on Twitch; 
Whereas the victims who tragically died 
were Aaron Salter, Ruth Whitfield, Pearly 
Young, Katherine ‘‘Kat’’ Massey, Heyward 
Patterson, Celestine Chaney, Roberta Drury, 
Margus D. Morrison, Andre Mackneil, and 
Geraldine Talley; 
Whereas the victims who were injured were 
Zaire Goodman, Jennifer Warrington, and 
Christopher Braden; 
Whereas the ‘‘Great Replacement Theory’’ 
is a White supremacist conspiracy theory 
that perpetuates the racist, xenophobic, na-
tivist, Islamophobic, and antisemitic false-
hood that non-White immigrants are being 
brought into the United States and other 
Western countries to repopulate majority 
White countries and disempower White vot-
ers to achieve a political agenda, and to spe-
cifically bring upon the genocide of White 
people; 
Whereas this hateful conspiracy theory has 
been cited as a motivation for White su-
premacist terrorist attacks domestically and 
internationally, including— 
(1) the targeting of a Tops Friendly Market 
in a predominantly Black neighborhood in 
Buffalo, New York, in 2022, in which the al-
leged gunman murdered 10 Black people, and 
injured 1 Black person and 2 White people; 
(2) the murder of 9 Black worshipers at the 
Emanuel 
African 
Methodist 
Episcopal 
Church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 
2015; 
(3) the White nationalist Unite the Right 
rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017 that 
resulted in 9 wounded and in the murder of 
Heather Heyer; 
(4) the murder of 11 people and wounding of 
6 in an antisemitic attack on the Tree of Life 
L’Simcha synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsyl-
vania, in 2018; 
(5) the targeting of Muslim worshippers, in 
which a gunman murdered 50 people at the 
Al Noor Mosque and Linwood Islamic Centre 
in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2019; 
(6) the targeting of a Walmart in a pre-
dominantly Hispanic neighborhood in El 
Paso, Texas, in 2019, in which a gunman mur-
dered 23 people and injured 3; and 
(7) the targeting of 3 Asian-owned spas in 
the Atlanta, Georgia, metro area on March 
16, 2021, in which a gunman killed 8 people, 
including 6 Asian women; 
Whereas this hateful conspiracy theory 
and White supremacy inflicts harm to indi-
viduals and communities in addition to phys-
ical injuries and death; 
Whereas many individuals in positions of 
power and media institutions with widely 
viewed public platforms have contributed to 
the normalization and legitimization of the 
underlying principles of the Great Replace-
ment Theory; and 
Whereas the people of the United States 
stand in solidarity with those harmed by 
this hateful, senseless tragedy: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives— 
(1) condemns in the strongest terms the 
Great Replacement Theory, a White su-
premacist conspiracy theory that has been 
used to falsely justify racially motivated, 
violent acts of terrorism domestically and 
internationally; 
(2) honors the memory and legacy of the 
victims and acknowledges the lasting impact 
that this White supremacist act of violent 
extremism will have on the Black commu-
nity of Buffalo, New York, the United 
States, and globally; 
(3) encourages all Americans to remember 
the victims of racially motivated hate 
crimes connected to White supremacist con-
spiracy theories such as the Great Replace-
ment Theory; and 
(4) reaffirms the commitment of the Fed-
eral Government to combat White suprem-
acy in all forms by developing the coordi-
nated, whole-of-government approach to ad-
dress White supremacist violence.

Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-

I 
thank the gentleman for yielding, and 
I commend him for his leadership in 
bringing this important legislation to

could be more important than that? I 
thank the gentleman for channeling 
the ideas and enthusiasms of so many 
Members on both sides of the aisle as 
he brings this bipartisan legislation to 
the floor. 
I thank Mr. NADLER for his leader-
ship, and I thank the task force led by 
Mr. MIKE THOMPSON of California for

his important work advancing the 
background check partisan legislation, 
as well as Mr. CLYBURN for his legisla-
tion that is already over on the Senate 
side. 
Madam Speaker, but today, we are 
doing more. Today, we were called to 
action by our colleague, LUCY MCBATH, 
who told us that today we must make 
history to protect the children, and we 
are going to make history by making 
progress. 
So I thank all of our Members, so 
many Members who have been so im-
portant to this legislation. I thank 
them on behalf of the courageous sur-
vivors of gun violence who have spoken 
out, out of respect for those who lost 
their lives and with appreciation for 
the gravity of this issue that we come 
to be on this floor. 
Madam Speaker, as the families from 
Buffalo to Uvalde bury their loved 
ones, even more communities have 
been hit by gun violence. Just last 
weekend, Americans watched in horror 
as at least 13 mass shootings unfolded 
across the country: from Philadelphia 
to Chattanooga to Phoenix to Grand 
Rapids. 
As the data shows, the challenge of 
gun violence goes much further than 
these mass killings. Every night on our 
streets, Americans are being killed in 
gun crimes. And every day, our Nation 
loses Americans to suicides and acci-
dents. This is a tragic daily massacre, 
which rarely makes the headlines or 
the evening news, but it is there. 
So here we are, for the children. 
When those who were advocating gun 
violence or perpetrating it went into 
the classrooms, they crossed a line. It 
is terrible the gun violence that we 
have had in our country. But that they 
would go into Newtown and shoot little 
children who are barely out of diapers; 
and again now in Texas, these beautiful 
children in elementary school, and ev-
erything that happened in between, it 
was an assault on the culture of our 
country that our children would not be 
able to go to school without fear or 
concern about their safety. 
Our children are, as President Ken-
nedy said, our greatest resource and 
our best hope for the future. They are 
our precious treasure. Everything we 
do is for the children. And for the chil-
dren, we must stop this gun violence in 
our country and restore their con-
fidence in their safety, wherever they 
may be. So we are on a crusade for the 
children, and sadly now, by the chil-
dren. 
Children testifying in committee. 
Children coming to events. Last week, 
I had a 5th grader come to a Wear Or-
ange rally that we had in California, 
where she said she lost both her moth-
er and her father in separate gun vio-
lence incidents. In 5th grade, speaking 
at the podium so courageously. Chil-
dren turning their grief, their experi-
ence now, not just—it would be enough 
to end the violence of losing a loved 
one, but to witness it and be a victim 
of it in the classroom. A crusade for 
the children by the children and of the 
children in terms of our motivation to 
stop this for our precious children. 
Indeed, America had lost more chil-
dren from gun violence than any other 
cause. 
Does that embarrass you to think 
that in our country more children have 
died from gun violence than any other 
cause? 
These stories are tragically all too 
common in America today. Countless 
more than those who died are forever 
changed by the horrors of gun violence 
that they saw firsthand or that they 
experienced in their families. 
It is sickening that our children are 
forced to live in this constant fear. And 
make no mistake, these gunmen who 
choose to shoot at innocent children 
are desecrating, again, our culture—a 
culture where all of us, all of our kids 
must and should feel safe, whether it is 
in school, in church, the movies, or any 
other place. 
Madam Speaker, protecting our chil-
dren can and must be a unifying mis-
sion for our Nation because they are 
our, as I said, our national treasure. 
That is why, under the unyielding lead-
ership of our chairman, Mr. NADLER, 
the House will pass the Protecting Our 
Kids Act today. This bold package in-
cludes commonsense measures that 
will make an enormous difference to 
save lives. 
Who wouldn’t vote to raise the age 
from 18 to 21 for a person to have a 
weapon of war? 
Who wouldn’t vote to raise the age to 
take weapons of war out of the hands 
of teenagers? 
Who wouldn’t vote to get illegal guns 
off of our streets by cracking down on 
gun trafficking which is a danger to 
people but also to law enforcement? 
Who wouldn’t vote for background 
checks on ghost gun purchases which 
our law enforcement tells us is a major 
concern out there? 
Who wouldn’t vote to protect chil-
dren from stolen weapons or accidental 
shootings with safe storage require-
ments? 
Who wouldn’t vote to ban bump 
stocks—that was President Trump’s 
executive order—bump stocks from ci-
vilian use or outlawing high-capacity 
magazines designed for massacres not 
for killing varmints. 
These measures will not only help 
stem the tide of mass murder but ad-
dress the equally urgent and wide 
range of daily gun deaths. Let us salute 
the many Members who have worked 
persistently to craft this strong legis-
lation, written to earn bipartisan sup-
port that the American people expect 
and deserve. 
Today’s package is just one step in 
the House’s relentless fight to stop the 
bloodshed. Our Democratic majority, 
as I mentioned earlier, has twice 
passed 
the 
Bipartisan 
Background 
Checks Act and the Enhanced Back-
ground Checks Act, which together 
would put our Nation on a path toward 
universal background checks. 
Tomorrow, thanks again to Congress-
woman 
MCBATH
and 
Congressman 
CARBAJAL, we will pass the Federal Ex-
treme Risk Protection Act, otherwise 
known as the Red Flag Act. This will 
help keep guns out of the hands of 
those who pose a threat to themselves 
or others. 
Soon, we will vote for Mr. CICILLINE’s 
Active Shooter Alert Act to create an 
AMBER alert-style notification during 
a mass shooting, a measure widely sup-
ported by law enforcement. 
And the House will continue to con-
sider additional actions we can take 
that have a proven record of saving 
lives. When I talk about these different 
things, people say, well, what dif-
ference is that going to make? 
Well, the cumulative effect is a big 
one. We know there are negotiations 
going on in the Senate and we are 
prayerful, 
we 
are 
prayerful 
about 
those. Hopefully, we can make some 
advancement. 
Because for all of us who have met 
again and again and again with the 
survivors of gun violence, some coming 
time and again to check up on what is 
happening, others new to that horrible 
club that none of us wants to be a 
member of, they just want something 
to happen. 
b 1445 
Years ago, when I met with the sur-
vivors of Pulse, I said: What can we do 
to be of comfort to you? They said: 
Just make sure it doesn’t happen to 
someone else. 
That is what they said. They didn’t 
say: I need this; I need that. They said: 
Just make sure it doesn’t happen to 
someone else. 
Right now, in the eyes of survivors 
and indeed all Americans, their eyes 
are on us in the Congress to see wheth-
er we have the courage, the commit-
ment, and the conviction to protect the 
children. 
For some in Congress, a moment of 
silence is good enough for them, a mo-
ment of silence. As Mr. HIGGINS said 
when he talked about Buffalo, a mo-
ment of silence now, but action after. 
Now, we are taking that action. 
So many of our colleagues have 
talked about incidents in their district, 
personal experiences shared by people 
who have been victims of gun violence. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT talked about what hap-
pened in his district. 
Again, so many of you have come 
speaking of the horror of it all, and 
every time it happens, it is as if it has 
happened for the first time because the 
horror is so fresh. But it is not the first 
time for the victims who have to relive 
so much of the experience. 
To those who a moment of silence is 
good enough because you don’t have 
the courage to take a vote to protect 
the children, I would say your political 
survival is totally insignificant com-
pared to the survival of our children. 
I urge my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to come together with a 
strong ‘‘aye’’ vote on all the provisions

in the bill for the final package and to 
do so as part of a crusade of, by, and for 
the children. I urge an ‘‘aye’’ vote on 
the Protecting Our Kids legislation. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
What happened in Uvalde, Buffalo, 
and Tulsa is as wrong as wrong could 
be, and our hearts go out to those com-
munities and those families who have 
been impacted in such a terrible way. 
The answer is not to destroy the Sec-
ond Amendment, but that is exactly 
where the Democrats want to go. 
Don’t take my word for it. Just look 
at what they said. The President of the 
United States said last week that he 
wants to get rid of the most popular 
handgun 
in 
the 
country. 
Michael 
Moore, a Democrat—not a Member of 
Congress but a Democrat—said it is 
time to repeal the Second Amendment. 
During 
our 
10-hour 
markup 
last 
Thursday in the committee hearing, 
Representative JACKSON Lee said if this 
bill passes, we are not finished. Rep-
resentative JONES
said if this bill 
doesn’t pass, we will end the filibuster; 
we will expand the Supreme Court; we 
will do whatever it takes to get law- 
abiding citizens’ guns. 
Today, we have this hodgepodge of 
six bills thrown together. Many of the 
elements in these bills are unconstitu-
tional. Even the Ninth Circuit has said 
it is unconstitutional what they want 
to do on the age limit. These bills 
would say when you can buy a firearm, 
what kind of firearm you can get, and 
where and how you have to store that 
firearm in your own darn home. 
Of course, tomorrow, they are bring-
ing the so-called red flag law to the 
floor. Someone who doesn’t like you 
can file a complaint. Within 24 hours, 
there is a hearing that you are not al-
lowed to be at—you can’t confront 
your accuser—and they can take away 
your Second Amendment liberty. That 
is the bill they are going to pass to-
morrow. 
Frankly, this shouldn’t surprise us. 
For 18 months, Democrats have as-
saulted 
the 
First 
Amendment. 
It 
shouldn’t surprise us now that they are 
coming after the Second. Every right 
we enjoy as Americans under the First 
Amendment—your right to practice 
your faith, your right to assemble, 
your right to petition your govern-
ment, freedom of the press—heck, some 
of them call for outlawing certain net-
works. 
And freedom of speech, just a few 
weeks ago, the Biden administration 
tried 
to 
put 
together 
the 
Disinformation Governance Board. Oh, 
my goodness. 
The attacks on the First Amendment 
have been sustained. They have been 
going on for 18 months, and now here 
they come, going after law-abiding 
citizens’ Second Amendment liberties. 
The Speaker started by saying this 
bill is about protecting our kids. That 
is important. Sure is. That is what she 
said, protecting our kids is important. 
Yes, it is. But this bill doesn’t do it. 
What this bill does is takes away 
Second Amendment rights, God-given 
rights protected by our Constitution, 
from law-abiding American citizens. 
That is what this legislation does, and 
that is why we should oppose it. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, our Nation has been 
through trying times these last few 
weeks as we have tried to process the 
mass shootings in Buffalo, Uvalde, 
Tulsa, and all too many other cities. 
Just this past weekend, we learned of 
yet another horrific incident in Phila-
delphia and yet more carnage in Ten-
nessee, Arizona, Virginia, and South 
Carolina. And those are just the stories 
we saw in the news. 
Day after day, we see more lives lost 
to gun violence in our schools, on our 
streets, in our houses of worship, and 
in our homes, touching every region of 
the country. And we hear the urgent 
calls from our constituents crying out 
for us to take action. Today, we heed 
that call. 
H.R. 7910, the Protecting Our Kids 
Act, is comprehensive legislation to 
address the scourge of gun violence, a 
blight that killed nearly 45,000 Ameri-
cans in 2020 alone. 
It builds on the work of several of 
our colleagues, including: 
ANTHONY BROWN’s Raise the Age Act, 
which would raise the lawful age to 
purchase an AR–15 styled semiauto-
matic assault rifle from 18 to 21 years 
old; 
ROBIN
KELLY’s Prevent Gun Traf-
ficking Act, which would establish new 
Federal offenses for gun trafficking 
and straw purchasing; 
DAVID CICILLINE’s Untraceable Fire-
arms Act, which would ensure that 
ghost guns are subject to existing Fed-
eral firearms regulations; 
A trio of gun storage proposals— 
ROSA DELAURO’s Ethan’s Law, ELISSA 
SLOTKIN’s Safe Guns, Safe Kids Act, 
and SHEILA JACKSON LEE’s Kimberly 
Vaughan Firearms Safe Storage Act— 
which would establish storage regula-
tions that keep guns out of the hands 
of children and award grants for fire-
arm storage assistance programs; 
DINA TITUS’ Closing the Bump Stock 
Loophole Act, which would build on ex-
isting regulations banning the manu-
facture, sale, or possession of bump 
stocks for civilian use; 
And TED DEUTCH’s Keep Americans 
Safe Act, which would ban the sale, 
manufacture, and illegal possession of 
gun magazines that hold more than 15 
rounds of ammunition. 
I thank each of them for their con-
tributions to this bill and for making 
this country safer for all Americans. 
Madam Speaker, all of us in this 
Chamber were shaken by the images of 
parents in Uvalde standing in line to 
match their DNA to the remains of 
their 9- and 10-year-old children, par-
ents who should be picking up their 
children from school right now but 
who, instead, are picking up the pieces 
of their lives shattered by this un-
imaginable loss. 
But the question today is: Who 
among us will have the courage to do 
something about it? Who will be able 
to tell mothers and fathers that their 
children need not go to school in a for-
tress just to keep them safe? Who will 
be able to tell children that they did 
all they could today to ensure that 
their parents will return safely from 
the supermarket or their office or an 
evening out? Who will be able to tell 
their constituents that they stood with 
them and not with the gun lobby? 
Americans are watching. They are 
begging us to protect them and their 
loved ones from gun violence. Who 
among us will answer their call? 
I urge all of my colleagues to join me 
in supporting this Protecting Our Kids 
Act, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Ohio (Mr. CHABOT). 
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, this 
legislation represents an unfortunate 
missed opportunity. After witnessing 
the horrible tragedy that occurred at 
Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, 
Texas, we should be coming together 
and working in a bipartisan manner to 
take every constitutionally permissive 
step to make our schools safer and 
more secure and to protect our most 
valuable resources, our children. 
That is what we did after the tragic 
shooting in Parkland, Florida. Back in 
2018, Congressman JOHN RUTHERFORD, a 
former sheriff, led a bipartisan group of 
Members, myself included, in reauthor-
izing the COPS Secure Our Schools 
grant program. The legislation we 
passed increased Federal funding for 
school security and expanded the safe-
ty measures for which the money could 
be used. 
As a result, the Department of Jus-
tice announced over $125 million in 
grants last year to help improve secu-
rity at local schools. Overall, it is a 
good program that will benefit millions 
of students and teachers, but there is 
always room for improvement. 
That is why we should be looking for 
ways to get more money to schools to 
increase security, but the legislation 
before us today contains nothing that 
will really help make our schools safer. 
In fact, efforts to add school security 
provisions to the bill were rejected by 
the majority. 
For example, during the Judiciary 
Committee 
markup, 
I 
offered 
an 
amendment to encourage the hiring of 
retired police officers and honorably 
discharged 
military 
personnel 
as 
school resource officers. After all, no 
one is better trained and better pre-
pared to protect our schools. Unfortu-
nately, the majority rejected this com-
monsense proposal to help improve 
safety and security at schools across 
the country.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5370 
June 8, 2022 
Then, at Rules Committee, I offered 
an amendment to allow unspent Amer-
ican Rescue Plan funds to be used on 
school security programs. Billions set 
aside for schools under that legislation 
hasn’t been spent and could be lost for-
ever if schools don’t meet certain dead-
lines. 
While we do, or did, need to protect 
students and teachers from COVID, 
more children under 11 died at Robb El-
ementary in 1 hour than have died 
from COVID in the entire State of 
Texas this year. Yet, we have $100 bil-
lion—billion with a b—in unspent edu-
cation funds to fight COVID while only 
$125 million—million with an m—avail-
able for school security. 
It seems logical that we should allow 
these unspent funds to be spent to pro-
tect our children and our teachers. The 
money could be used for metal detec-
tors, to adopt security plans, to train 
school officials, to hire school resource 
officers, including, as I mentioned, re-
tired police officers, and to help iden-
tify students with mental health issues 
and get those students the treatment 
that they need. 
Yet, this commonsense amendment, 
too, was rejected by the majority. 
Instead of school security measures, 
we, unfortunately, have a bill full of 
likely unconstitutional provisions that 
won’t pass the Senate anyway. 
The crux of my argument against 
this legislation is the majority is act-
ing quickly when they ought to be 
doing the right thing. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE), the cosponsor of the bill and a 
member of the Judiciary Committee. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
no 9-year-old should be sentenced to a 
death sentence. No grandmother shop-
ping at a grocery store should get a 
death sentence. No mother who testi-
fied today should lose her son. 
Vicious gun violence that has no 
rhyme and no reason. Yes, I am excited 
about this historic moment. H.R. 7910, 
the Protecting Our Kids Act, is, in fact, 
a solution to horrible and vicious prob-
lems. 
It is clear, as I stand next to the chil-
dren, they should not have died. As I 
stand next to those from Buffalo, they 
should not have died. As we know 
about those who were seeking medical 
care in Tulsa, they should not have 
died. 
I have no problem with saying that 
we build on this, and as Ronald Reagan 
said to us, he at the time saw no reason 
for an AK–47 to be used for hunting or 
defending one’s home. 
Dr. Guerrero, a pediatrician, said 
that he raced to the hospital, and as he 
raced to the hospital, he found parents 
outside yelling children’s names in des-
peration, sobbing as they begged for 
news of their related children. Or the 
mother who ran barefoot all the way to 
Robb Elementary School, begging and 
crying for a child. Or Miah, who had 
the wherewithal to watch as her teach-
er was shot dead, she marked herself 
with blood because she was attempting 
to save her life. 
These children, these Americans, our 
loved ones, this should not happen 
again. So, this bill that has a package 
of storage bills, that has a package of 
munitions, that deals with the age, 
deals with a number of items, traf-
ficking, ghost guns, bump stocks, this 
is a way to go. 
b 1500 
I hope, as we go in the future, we are 
not afraid of a 7-day waiting period or 
an assault weapon ban. This is the way 
to go. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield the gentlewoman an additional 15 
seconds. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
this is the way to go. 
I thank Chairman THOMPSON
and 
Chairman NADLER. 
This is the way to go. Should they be 
given a death sentence? Where is the 
responsible gun owner that can stand 
with me and declare that they should 
live? You are out there. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has again ex-
pired. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
we need humanity and courage. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
7910, the ‘‘Protecting Our Kids Act.’’ 
Our country is experiencing a crisis of gun 
violence. It is critical that Congress act now to 
protect our children and our communities by 
supporting H.R. 7910. This multifaceted legis-
lation is a combination of humanity, courage, 
decency, and action. 
I traveled to Uvalde and listened to the 
grieving parents and families of children and 
teachers slaughtered at Robb Elementary. We 
can no longer standby idly as our children suf-
fer such life-changing trauma. 
As I stand here today, I am reminded of the 
immortal words of the conscience of Con-
gress, Representative John Lewis, following 
the 2016 Pulse Nightclub massacre. He said: 
‘‘This is the fight. It is not an opinion. We 
must remove the blinders, the time for silence 
and patience is long gone.’’ 
He asked—‘‘Where is the heart of this 
body? Where is our soul? Where is our moral 
leadership? Where is our courage?’’ 
Far too many have died by gunfire since 
Representative Lewis asked, ‘‘Are we blind?’’ 
I ask this body today: Where is our courage? 
Are we still blind to this horror? What will it 
take for us to act? 
As a Texan, I understand how deeply guns 
are embedded in our culture. Though, I equal-
ly understand how our children are impacted 
by the presence of guns in our communities. 
My 
heart 
was 
touched 
by 
Kimberly 
Vaughan, a 14-year-old student, was the 
youngest victim to die along with eight school-
mates and two teachers, at Santa Fe High 
School in Texas in 2018. The shooter gained 
access to his father’s shotgun and pistol, kept 
in a closet, to carry out the murders. 
To commemorate Kimberly Vaughan, I intro-
duced a provision of H.R. 7910 that expands 
the requires safe firearm storage devices to be 
made available at the point of sale—for both 
rifles and shotguns—which will train new gun 
owners on the value of safe storage and re-
mind seasoned gun owners that safe storage 
goes hand-in-hand with responsible gun own-
ership. 
There are now more guns held legally and 
illegally in the U.S. than there are people. 
While gun violence touches every corner of 
America, Texas has suffered some of the 
deadliest mass shootings in history. 
Despite the escalating gun violence statis-
tics, which have left innumerable families and 
communities broken and afraid, Congress has 
still failed to act. 
Instead, lawmakers in several states, includ-
ing in my state of Texas, have reconvened 
after mass shootings to soften gun laws, most 
notably, passing permit-less carry legislation. 
I have been dismayed by those who repeat-
edly offer thoughts and prayers, then fail to 
act. Our top priority as lawmakers should be 
protecting our communities. Yet, we have re-
linquished that duty through inaction. 
Now is the time for action. We cannot wait 
any longer. I call upon each of my colleagues, 
on both the right and left, to muster your cour-
age and join me in support of H.R. 7910—life- 
saving legislation, which represents the hard 
work of so many dedicated members of Con-
gress. 
I thank House Judiciary Committee Chair-
man NADLER and Representative MIKE THOMP-
SON, Chair of the Gun Violence Prevention 
Task Force, for working with me on this bill 
and recognizing the urgency and necessity of 
bringing it to the floor. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. GAETZ). 
Mr. GAETZ. Madam Speaker, Speak-
er PELOSI tells us she is on a crusade 
for 
the 
children. 
Someone 
should 
maybe remind the Speaker the Cru-
sades did not always end well when 
they were reflexively driven by emo-
tion and riddled with poor planning. 
No, this is no crusade for the chil-
dren. If it were, you wouldn’t leave our 
children as sitting ducks in gun-free 
zones when they go to school every 
day. 
The Speaker says we need action. We 
are for action. How about the action of 
my bill to create a national stand- 
your-ground law to strengthen self-de-
fense, or RICHARD HUDSON’s bill for na-
tional concealed carry, or any number 
of proposals Republicans have offered 
to unlock the safe and secure environ-
ment when we have our military vet-
erans and our former members of law 
enforcement able to carry a firearm re-
sponsibly in schools to be able to re-
spond to these acts of violence? 
No, their version of action is more 
gun control and raising the age to be 
able to buy certain firearms. Well, on 
November 25, 2021, a crazed lunatic 
with a knife broke into a home in El 
Paso and began assaulting a woman in-
side. 
The 
20-year-old 
homeowner 
grabbed his rifle and killed the assail-
ant. That is action. 
In 2017, in Sutherland Springs, Texas, 
a gunman open fired inside the First 
Baptist Church. A Good Samaritan 
grabbed his AR–15 and engaged the

shooter, stopping him from further car-
nage—a good use for an AR–15. 
In 2019, in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, 
a 19-year-old killed three would-be bur-
glars who broke into his home. 
These situations happen every day. 
There would be more death and more 
bloodshed if we were to accept these 
proposals from the Democrats. 
The Second Amendment isn’t about 
hunting or about self-defense; it is 
about power. It is about the power that 
is reserved in the citizenry to curate a 
balance so that Americans are not 
overrun by tyranny. Thank God we 
haven’t had to use the Second Amend-
ment for the purpose that some might 
have envisioned necessary when our 
Founders were creating the Constitu-
tion. 
That power belongs to the people, not 
to the Democrats trying to take their 
rights away. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. THOMPSON), a cosponsor 
of the bill and the chairman of the Gun 
Violence Prevention Task Force. 
Mr. 
THOMPSON 
of 
California. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of this bill, the Protecting Our 
Kids Act. I point out that every argu-
ment we have heard against it so far is 
nonsense. 
Every student deserves to feel safe in 
school, and every parent should know 
that their child is safe when they walk 
out of their house in the morning. 
After each mass shooting, too many 
people 
are 
content to offer their 
thoughts and prayers. The Protecting 
Our Kids Act is more than thoughts 
and prayers. 
I was proud to work on this bill with 
Chairman NADLER, Chairwoman JACK-
SON LEE, and all of our colleagues who 
have contributed bills and input that 
have made this bill the important bill 
that it is. 
As a lifelong hunter, gun owner, and 
as a combat veteran, I believe in law- 
abiding citizens’ ability and right to 
own firearms. As a gun owner, I believe 
that all responsible gun owners have 
that responsibility to support efforts to 
help keep our schools, streets, and 
communities safe from mass shootings 
and from the everyday gun violence 
that often goes unreported by the 
media. 
Each provision in this bill helps re-
duce gun violence, and it saves lives. 
Raising the age to buy an assault 
weapon saves lives. Limiting magazine 
capacity will limit the carnage of mass 
shootings, and it saves lives. Going 
after traffickers keeps guns out of the 
hands of people who shouldn’t have 
them, and it saves lives. Safe storage 
helps reduce suicides and keeps kids 
safe at home and school, and it saves 
lives. The unregulated sales of bump 
stocks and ghost guns is tearing up our 
communities; regulating ghost guns 
and regulating bump stocks saves lives. 
This bill respects the Second Amend-
ment while taking steps to protect our 
communities from the epidemic of gun 
violence. None of our careers are worth 
more than the lives of the children in 
this country. We need to pass this bill, 
and I hope we do it with strong bipar-
tisan support. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, the 
previous speaker said ‘‘nonsense.’’ It is 
not nonsense to defend the Second 
Amendment. The Second Amendment 
protects our God-given right to protect 
ourselves, our family, our property, 
and our freedom. That is not nonsense. 
That is essential is what it is, and it is 
a critical part of the Constitution. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to 
the gentleman from North Carolina 
(Mr. HUDSON). 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, as 
the father of an elementary school 
child, I am devastated every time we 
have a school shooting. That is why 
identifying solutions to stop these 
tragedies is so important to me. 
There are only two significant gun 
safety bills to pass Congress recently. 
Both were Republican bills passed by a 
Republican majority and signed by a 
Republican President. 
The Democrats’ mantra has been ‘‘do 
something.’’ My Republican colleagues 
and I know that the American people 
expect us to do something that mat-
ters. 
That is why I introduced H.R. 7966, 
the STOP II, Secure Every School and 
Protect our Nation’s Children Act. It 
builds on the STOP School Violence 
Act signed into law in 2018 and redi-
rects unused COVID–19 funding to pro-
vide $1 billion to hire school resource 
officers, and it provides $1 billion to 
hire mental health guidance coun-
selors. 
Our guidance counselors are wonder-
ful, caring people who are stretched too 
thin. They may not always have the 
time they need to reach all the chil-
dren who need help. There is $5 billion 
included to fund STOP School Violence 
programs that harden schools, expand 
active shooter training, and provide re-
sources for law enforcement, school of-
ficials, and students to intervene be-
fore someone reaches a breaking point. 
Under my legislation, schools can 
also apply for threat assessments to 
identify weaknesses in security and in 
mental health services. A clearing-
house is also codified under Homeland 
Security to share best practices for 
school safety. 
My STOP II Act is one of 12 bills that 
House Republicans are bringing for-
ward that actually solve problems and 
actually save lives, all without threat-
ening the Second Amendment rights of 
law-abiding citizens. If gun control 
worked, Chicago would be one of the 
safest cities in America. 
My colleagues across the aisle have 
so far refused to work with us where 
there is common ground on this issue. 
They and the media know the bills we 
are considering today have no chance 
of becoming law. 
I ask my colleagues across the aisle 
to set aside this partisan agenda. In-
stead, help me to harden schools. Help 
me to intervene with students in a 
mental health crisis before they reach 
a breaking point. 
Imagine the impact if we had inter-
vened and gotten the help that this 
young man in Uvalde needed before he 
dropped out of high school. Help me 
protect our children and teachers to 
make sure tragedies like this never 
happen again. 
Madam Speaker, if we adopt the mo-
tion to recommit, we will instruct the 
Committee on the Judiciary to con-
sider my amendment to H.R. 7910 to 
provide needed resources to schools for 
safety and security and mental health 
intervention and counseling. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to insert the text of the 
amendment 
in 
the 
RECORD
imme-
diately prior to the vote on the motion 
to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from North Carolina? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. COHEN), a member of 
the Judiciary Committee. 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of this bill and would 
like to see a bill that is even stronger. 
There is no question that children— 
and that is what they are—should not 
be buying AR–15s before they are 21. In 
fact, I don’t think they should be buy-
ing them at all. But until they are 21, 
they shouldn’t be buying them. 
It has been proven scientifically that 
the male brain is not developed to a 
certain point to be trusted at that time 
with that type of weapon. Those are 
weapons of war. Those weapons tore 
apart those children, decapitated them, 
and made them unidentifiable. That 
was the purpose of those weapons, and 
that is what happened. There is no rea-
son for that to occur. 
The opinion in 2008 that gave the 
right to carry a gun was not unlimited. 
It said you can have reasonable restric-
tions. That is what Justice Scalia said. 
These are reasonable restrictions. 
As far as my friend, Mr. HUDSON, I 
have great respect for him. One of the 
teachers at Uvalde who was hit and 
lost all 11 children said: We trained. 
There is no training that can prepare 
you for this. There is nothing you can 
be prepared for. 
If you get more school counselors, 
does that help people in the movie the-
aters and in Columbine? No. Movie the-
aters, churches, grocery stores all need 
to be protected. This country is wild 
with guns, and we need to restrict 
them. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. GOHMERT). 
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, it 
has been difficult in debate last week 
and even today to be told that we have 
no courage. We were told in debate last 
week: We don’t want to hear anymore 
about 
social 
media, 
violent 
video 
games, Hollywood, mental illness. And

they sure don’t want to hear any more 
about prayers. They are disgusted 
hearing about prayers. They don’t want 
to hear any more about fatherlessness 
and drug use. 
Maybe if we heard more prayers from 
leaders of this country instead of tak-
ing God’s name in vain, we wouldn’t 
have the mass killings like we didn’t 
have before prayer was eliminated 
from school. 
It is not like we are not willing to 
consider the best way to stop mass 
shootings, but if you look at the plans 
being proposed in these bills, you can 
find these things in cities controlled by 
Democrats. 
If you look at the 16 cities that were 
hit with record homicide rates, they all 
had Democrats at the top controlling 
things: Philadelphia, 524 murders last 
year; Austin, Texas, had a record 88; In-
dianapolis, 258; Albuquerque, 107; Co-
lumbus, Ohio, 179; Jackson, Mississippi, 
129; and Atlanta, Georgia, 150. 
If you look at the Speaker’s own 
State—as this article by AWR Hawkins 
said this week, an FBI report on active 
shooter incidents in 2021 shows Cali-
fornia was the number one State for 
such incidents, with 6 incidents out of 
the 12 that met the definition of mass 
killing. 
In California, universal background 
checks, assault weapons ban, high-ca-
pacity magazine ban, 10-day waiting 
period on gun purchases, red flag laws, 
gun registration requirements, good 
cause 
requirement 
for 
concealed 
carry—and what is the response we got 
in debate last week about? You ought 
to have due process. We are told: Oh, 
they get due process. Look at the bill. 
What the Democrats call due process 
is just like the January 6th Com-
mittee. It is not due process. It is not 
bipartisan. They have only one side 
that is heard at the hearing. The peo-
ple, when they want to take away your 
gun, they don’t get to be there. The 
husband can rush in and claim the bat-
tered wife is a threat. That is enough 
to get her eliminated from being able 
to use a weapon or have a weapon. 
These are not the ways to fix things. 
For people who are okay with late- 
term abortions and ripping the arms 
and legs off of children that feel the 
pain and then crushing the skulls, it is 
desensitizing. 
Madam Speaker, it is not well re-
ceived. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. JOHNSON), a member of 
the Judiciary Committee. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, how free are we as Americans 
if we are holed up in our homes, shell- 
shocked by gun violence? We should 
not have to live like that. We shouldn’t 
have to live tormented by the need to 
buy yet another gun more powerful 
than the one our neighbor purchased 
last week. That is not freedom. Our 
kids deserve better. 
The old and tired NRA Republican 
Party philosophy, which is the only 
way to stop a bad guy is a good guy 
with a gun, has not and will not work. 
In Uvalde, 19 good guys with guns 
didn’t stop the killer of 19 school kids 
and two teachers. 
We have done it the Republican way 
for far too long now, and for the sake 
of the kids, it is time to do something 
different. 
Today, the good guys in the House 
will stand up to the NRA and pass the 
commonsense Protecting Our Kids Act.

Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD an article dated 
May 31, 2022, from The New York Times 
titled 
‘‘California 
has 
America’s 
Toughest Gun Laws, and They Work.’’ 
[From the New York Times, May 31, 2022] 
CALIFORNIA HAS AMERICA’S TOUGHEST GUN 
LAWS, AND THEY WORK 
(By Shawn Hubler) 
The grotesque toll of gun violence is again 
being debated in Congress. As Luis Ferre´- 
Sadurnı´ and I reported over the long week-
end, states are not holding their breath. 
Particularly this state: In ways that have 
tended to be underreported, California has 
significantly lowered gun deaths, Dr. Garen 
J. Wintemute, an emergency room doctor 
and longtime firearm violence researcher, 
told me this week. 
‘‘For the last 20, maybe even 25 years—ex-
cept for the two years of the pandemic, 
which have increased homicides and suicides 
across the country—our rates of firearm vio-
lence have trended downward,’’ said Dr. 
Wintemute, who directs the Violence Pre-
vention Research Program at the University 
of California, Davis, Medical Center in Sac-
ramento. ‘‘And this has been at a time when 
most of the rates in the rest of the country 
have gone up.’’ 
California’s rate of firearm mortality is 
among the nation’s lowest, with 8.5 gun 
deaths per 100,000 people in 2020, compared 
with 13.7 per 100,000 nationally and 14.2 per 
100,000 in Texas, the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention has reported. And Cali-
fornians are about 25 percent less likely to 
die in mass shootings, compared with resi-
dents of other states, according to a recent 
Public Policy Institute of California anal-
ysis. 
I asked Dr. Wintemute how California is 
different. Here’s a lightly edited excerpt 
from our conversation, which took place on 
Memorial Day after his emergency room 
shift: 
Just a couple of weeks ago, California had 
a mass shooting. By what measures are our 
policies a success? 
You have to look at it on a population 
basis. We do have more mass shootings in 
California, but we’re also by far the largest 
state. I looked a while ago at the rates of 
firearm violence across the 21st century— 
homicide and suicide together—and the rest 
of the country was up, but California’s rates 
were so far down that the average was flat. 
We always hear that nothing works, that 
even California’s strict gun laws are ineffec-
tive. 
That’s because we evaluate policies one at 
a time, in isolation. The results for one pol-
icy might be mixed or even negative. But 
what California has done over a number of 
decades has been to enact a whole bundle of 
policies that I think work in synergy, to 
measurable effect. 
It sounds like the ‘‘Swiss cheese model’’ 
public health experts have used to address 
Covid. 
Yes. The idea is to prevent the holes in the 
policies from lining up. But if we rank the 
states, California’s rate of firearm violence 
ranks 29th out of 50 states for homicides and 
44th for suicides. 
Can you share some examples? 
California has done a lot to prevent high- 
risk people from purchasing firearms. We’ve 
broadened the criteria for keeping guns out 
of the hands of people who pose a danger to 
themselves or others due to mental illness. If 
you’re convicted of a violent misdemeanor in 
California, you can’t have a gun for the next 
10 years; that offense has to be a felony in 
most states. 
We require background checks, and not 
just from licensed retailers; in most states, 
purchases from private parties require no 
background checks or record keeping of any 
kind. We have a system, that we’re evalu-
ating now, for getting guns back from ‘‘pro-
hibited persons’’—people who have been con-
victed of violent crimes or who are facing do-
mestic violence restraining orders. And we 
enforce these policies, unlike a lot of other 
states. 
What else? 
In the early 1990s, cheap handguns—‘‘Sat-
urday Night Specials’’—were almost entirely 
manufactured around Los Angeles. It was a 
few companies making upward of 800,000 
cheap handguns a year. So the state imposed 
standards for design and safety. One of the 
companies has since gone to Nevada. The 
rest went belly-up and no one else has come 
in to fill the gap. 
What about gaps? 
Every time California sets a new standard, 
the gun industry tries to outwit it. Unregu-
lated ghost guns have become immensely 
popular here, precisely because we’re such a 
tightly regulated market. And the state pro-
gram to recover guns from prohibited people 
has never had the level of funding it needs to 
do the whole job—there are only about 40 
trained agents for the whole state and a 
backlog of at least 10,000 people whose guns 
need to be taken. 
Overall, what could the rest of the country 
learn from California? 
The lower the prevalence of ownership, the 
lower the rate of firearm violence—that’s 
been one of the most robust research find-
ings for decades. Rates of gun ownership are 
lower here, in part because of this bundle of 
state measures. In the United States overall, 
something like 25 percent to 30 percent of in-
dividuals own guns. In California, it’s about 
15 percent to 18 percent. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, the 
evidence doesn’t lie. California’s rate 
of firearm mortality is among the Na-
tion’s lowest, with 8.5 gun deaths per 
100,000 people in 2020, compared with 
13.7 per 100,000 nationally and 14.2 per 
100,000 in Texas. Gun safety laws work. 
It is that simple. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the 
distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
Maryland (Mr. HOYER). 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
This is an emotional debate. It is an 
emotional debate because we lose, on a 
daily basis, family members, neigh-
bors, friends, and fellow citizens to a 
bullet or multiple bullets—killed by 
gun. 
I do not subscribe to the theory that 
some promote that the more guns we 
have, the safer we will be. I believe 
that is somewhat like the O.K. Corral 
theory that if you have a faster gun, 
then you will be safe. Eventually,

somebody will have a faster, bigger, 
and more surprising gun than we. 
Madam Speaker, like all Americans, 
I found the mass shooting at Uvalde, 
Texas, heart-wrenching, tragic, and un-
acceptable. Although the news was ex-
cruciating to watch, it was anything 
but surprising given our history with 
deadly firearms. Sadly, we didn’t even 
have time to mourn the 19 children and 
two teachers who were killed in Uvalde 
before news broke of another mass 
shooting—over and over and over and 
over and over and over again. 
At some point these statistics have 
to move us to respond in an effective 
way. My friend from North Carolina 
suggested hardening the schools. We 
have hardened this Chamber over the 
objections of some when we know that 
no gun should be in this Capitol other 
than those possessed by law enforce-
ment, Capitol Police. 
According to the nonpartisan Gun 
Violence Archive, there have been as 
many as 33 mass gun violence incidents 
in the 14 days since the attack on Robb 
Elementary. We have more guns in this 
country than any other nation on 
Earth. The Second Amendment guaran-
tees that we have a right to a gun, but 
the Supreme Court in Heller said: But 
there are limitations to that right. 
I strongly support an individual 
American’s right to have a gun in his 
or her home—their home—to protect 
themselves and their business. But the 
Court said: Be reasonable. 
In the past week alone, 7 days, we 
have seen mass shootings in Chat-
tanooga, Tennessee, in Philadelphia, 
Pennsylvania; and Tulsa, Oklahoma. 
Not even 10 days before the shooting in 
Robb Elementary, a domestic terrorist 
killed 13 people in a grocery store in 
Buffalo, New York. 
In every corner of this country, 
Americans are begging—begging—Con-
gress to protect our kids and our peo-
ple. Many of us like to say, This is the 
people’s House. 
The people are speaking to us and 
crying out for action. 
A gentleman who spoke before me 
said something about saying prayers. I 
believe in prayer. But I also believe the 
admonition that JOHN KENNEDY said 
when he said: ‘‘Let us go forth to lead 
the land we love, asking His blessing 
and His help, but knowing that here on 
Earth, God’s work must truly be our 
own.’’ 
Today, in this House—the people’s 
House—we need to act to protect the 
people. 
Madam Speaker, I want to direct 
your attention to this chart again. 
Look at the numbers—hundreds of 
deaths. In addition to the unconscion-
able trauma these attacks inflicted on 
the parents, children, wives, husbands, 
brothers, sisters, and other loved ones 
of the victims, they have one thing in 
common: the perpetrator got the gun 
legally. 
In Tulsa, Oklahoma, the perpetrator 
got the gun approximately 3 hours be-
fore he shot Dr. Phillips. He was filled, 
obviously, with passion, hate, and 
anger at the pain that he apparently 
was suffering physically and perhaps 
emotionally. 
So what did he do? 
He went down and quickly got a 
gun—an AR–15 to be exact—and went 
and shot not only Dr. Phillips but three 
other people in the process. Those are 
285 deaths we could have prevented if 
we had commonsense gun laws in place. 
Of the 45,000 people who died from 
gun violence last year alone—we are 
talking about making people safe— 
45,000 deaths—they are not safe—how 
many would have also been spared had 
our laws been stronger? 
Frankly, I, myself, would favor re-
instituting the 1994 assault weapons 
ban for which I voted. And I lamented 
the fact that when my Republican col-
leagues were in charge of the House, 
Senate, and the Presidency, they al-
lowed that law to go out of existence. 
None of us can speculate what the cost 
of that was, but there is no doubt in 
my mind there was a cost. In fact, that 
bill reduced mass shootings then, and 
it would do so again now. 
There is much I believe we ought to 
do as the Representatives of the Amer-
ican people in this House. The House, 
though, has already taken action on 
two very critical gun safety measures 
supported by 9 out of 10 Americans. We 
don’t have 9 out of 10 Americans who 
are Democrats in this country. Neither 
side does. But if you have any credence 
in polling data that says what Ameri-
cans think, 9 out of 10 think that com-
prehensive background checks should 
be the law of the land. I don’t know a 
commonsense argument against that. 
We passed the Charleston loophole. 
This gentleman who bought that gun 3 
hours or thereabouts before he killed 
Dr. Phillips would have had time to 
cool off and to perhaps have second 
thoughts, to perhaps have saved the 
life of a doctor whose job it was to save 
lives. We sent those bills over, and Sen-
ate Republicans, however, have refused 
to allow even debate on either of these 
bills—even debate on either of these 
bills that are overwhelmingly sup-
ported by the American people. 
I know that my Republican col-
leagues are as disturbed by the murder 
of children as Democrats are. I believe 
that. I hope that is the case, but I be-
lieve it. But I am confounded by the 
unwillingness to respond in an effective 
way even on asking that everybody get 
checked out, so we know they are not 
criminally insane or a felon or an 
abuser or on the terrorist watch list; 
but it is no to comprehensive back-
ground checks just to see if somebody 
is a danger to themselves or others. 
I know that our colleagues across the 
aisle shed tears when their constitu-
ents die from gun violence, as we do. 
This should not be a Democratic or Re-
publican issue but an issue of our com-
mon humanity and our common sense. 
If we work together, we can achieve a 
safer America. 
We have seen promising signs from 
the Senate that a bipartisan agreement 
may be possible. I surely hope it is. But 
this House will not and should not wait 
to act. That is why we are voting on 
this Protecting Our Kids Act today. 
This legislation is, in my view, long 
overdue. I participated in a sit-in on 
this floor to try to galvanize the Con-
gress. It didn’t work. Sadly, it didn’t 
work. To the disappointment of the 
American people, it didn’t work. 
This comprehensive bill is the prod-
uct of tireless efforts by many of our 
colleagues to address issues that con-
tribute to our gun violence epidemic. 
Thanks to ROBIN
KELLY, the Pro-
tecting Our Kids Act will crack down 
on gun traffickers who take guns, 
where? Into the big cities and spread 
them around. Now, they sell them; 
they don’t give them away for free. But 
it is the traffickers who break the 
laws—not of Chicago, but perhaps don’t 
break the laws of where they bought 
multiple guns for those who can’t buy 
guns. 
Similarly, Representatives Cicilline 
and Espaillat pushed to include provi-
sions that would regulate elusive ghost 
guns. Now, I chaired the Subcommittee 
on Treasury, Postal Service, and Gen-
eral Government that oversaw the Al-
cohol, Tobacco, and Firearms Division, 
and we couldn’t even make sure that 
ordnance—bullets—could be traced be-
cause the NRA was opposed. 
Representative TITUS
ensured that 
we would ban bump stocks, a weapon 
component that allowed a gunman to 
kill 60 people in Las Vegas in 2017 and 
wound hundreds more. 
Was he a hunter? Was he a sports-
man? 
Additionally, this bill will restrict 
high-capacity magazines which enable 
shooters to inflict maximum destruc-
tion in the minimum amount of time, 
thanks to language included by Rep-
resentative DEUTCH. Because of Chair-
woman DELAURO, Chairwoman JACK-
SON LEE, and Representative SLOTKIN, 
this bill also protects our kids from 
gun violence at home by implementing 
gun storage safety standards. 
Common sense and common purpose 
protects our kids. 
This act also includes Representative 
ANTHONY BROWN’s measure to raise the 
legal age for purchasing assault weap-
ons and shotguns from 18 to 21. You can 
buy an AR–15, apparently, or some 
other multiple-shot, quick-shot weap-
on, but you can’t buy a drink in many 
jurisdictions. 
Is that common sense? 
This legislation never would have 
come together without the leadership 
of Chairman NADLER. I thank the 
chairman for his leadership, and I 
thank the committee for their work on 
this bill. I thank Chairwoman JACKSON 
LEE of the Subcommittee on Crime, 
Terrorism and Homeland Security, and 
I thank Chairman THOMPSON
of the 
Gun Violence Task Force. 
This bill, as well as additional legis-
lation from Representatives MCBATH 
and CARBAJAL that will be considered 
subsequently on Thursday, takes major

steps forward to make our commu-
nities and our children safer. 
Is it perfect? 
Will it stop all the killing? 
No, it won’t. We know that. 
Is there a perfect answer? 
No. 
Is making schools safer bad? 
No. We support that. 
I don’t know that we support making 
them into armed camps, as some would 
suggest, because I think that would 
make them less safe in many respects. 
b 1530 
So I urge all of my colleagues to put 
our country, our constituents, and our 
kids first. Let us rise above party and 
partisanship and special interests as we 
seek to do what is right, what is nec-
essary, and what an overwhelming ma-
jority of the American people are look-
ing to Congress to achieve. 
Isn’t that what we are supposed to 
do, represent the people? 
I am hopeful we can find a bipartisan 
path forward to enact long-overdue re-
forms to make our communities safer 
from gun violence because a bullet 
doesn’t care about your race, your 
faith, your age, your orientation, or 
any other factor. 
And yes, people do care about those 
things and manifest it in the worst way 
possible. But they do it with an instru-
ment that will allow them to kill a lot 
of people very quickly. 
The American people care what we do 
here today. The American people care 
that their Congress is doing everything 
possible to keep them safe, to keep our 
children safe. The American people 
care. 
Each of us today has a chance to 
show that we care. God’s work on 
Earth must truly be our own. Vote for 
this bill. Make our kids and commu-
nities and people safer. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. JEFFRIES), a member of 
the Judiciary Committee. 
Mr. 
JEFFRIES. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
America is in the midst of a shocking 
gun violence epidemic that should 
shock the conscience of everyone, and 
has devastated children, families, and 
communities. We must address it with 
the fierce urgency of now. 
But there are some in this Chamber 
who would rather bury their heads in 
the sand and act like everything is 
okay. 
It is not okay that Black folks were 
gunned down in Buffalo, New York, 
simply because of the color of their 
skin. 
It is not okay that members of the 
Jewish community were gunned down 
in the Tree of Life synagogue in Pitts-
burgh simply because of their religious 
beliefs. 
It is not okay that children were 
gunned down and shredded in Uvalde, 
Texas, by an 18-year old who should 
never have had access to a weapon of 
war. 
It is not okay that mass murder has 
become a way of life in the United 
States of America. That is why we 
must pass comprehensive gun violence 
prevention legislation, address this epi-
demic decisively, and allow America to 
be the best version of itself. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from 
Kentucky (Mr. MASSIE). 
Mr. MASSIE. Madam Speaker, today 
we are debating six gun control provi-
sions in one. Why are there six bills in 
here? Because none of them work. 
But you can’t take six bills that 
don’t work and put them together and 
make one that does. It doesn’t work 
that way. 
These 
are 
unserious, 
unconstitu-
tional and, most troubling, dangerous 
provisions; six titles in this bill, and 
they all suffer the same inherent prob-
lem that gun control suffers when we 
pass it here in these legislatures, and 
that problem is, criminals do not obey 
the law. They are going to love some of 
these laws, though. 
Let’s take, for instance, the so-called 
safe storage provisions in here. Home 
invaders are going to love the fact that 
Congress has now told you you need to 
lock up your gun in your house. How 
are you going to defend yourself when 
your guns are locked up? This is dan-
gerous. It is also unconstitutional. 
The Supreme Court already ruled in 
Heller that it is unconstitutional to re-
quire Dick Heller to keep his gun dis-
assembled and unloaded in his house. 
That violates the Second Amendment. 
Think about the provision to raise 
the age to 21 to buy a long gun. That 
includes rifles and shotguns, not just a 
handgun, which is already impermis-
sible. This is unconstitutional, and it is 
immoral. 
Why is it immoral? Because we are 
telling 18-, 19-, and 20-year olds to reg-
ister for the draft. You can go die for 
your country. We expect you to defend 
us, but we are not going to give you the 
tools to defend yourself and your fam-
ily. 
I offered an amendment in com-
mittee that would let the spouse of 
somebody in the armed services serving 
overseas acquire the means of self-de-
fense while her husband is serving 
overseas; let her defend her and her 
children. Just because she is 18, 19, or 
20, and her husband is serving, she 
shouldn’t be defenseless. The Demo-
crats voted it down in committee. 
I offered an amendment to say that 
we won’t treat domestic violence vic-
tims as gun traffickers if they happen 
to get a gun from a neighbor instead of 
getting it from the gun store. Every 
Democrat but one voted against pro-
tecting domestic violence victims. 
Let me give you one that is not a hy-
pothetical. 
My 
dear 
friend 
Nikki 
Goeser, who worked in my congres-
sional office, watched her husband 
murdered in front of her in a gun-free 
zone because she followed the law. She 
had a licensed registered firearm and, 
in a moment she regrets to this day, 
she left it in her car because she knew 
the law said not to bring it in there; 
but her stalker knew she wasn’t going 
to have a gun. Her stalker murdered 
her husband in front of her. 
Criminals don’t follow the law. So 
let’s do the one serious thing we could 
do. 
Why must children keep dying? Let’s 
quit advertising our schools as soft tar-
gets. Let’s quit saying that these are 
gun-free zones, and that these kids are 
sitting ducks. 
In 1990, Congress did another knee- 
jerk reaction that has cost more lives 
than it saved. It is called the 1990 Gun- 
Free School Zones Act. 
Fortunately, some States and school 
districts have had the wisdom to over-
ride this provision. And guess what? 
We don’t have to guess. 
Does hardening our schools work? 
Does letting trained teachers and pro-
fessional staff carry, does it protect 
children? We know it does. Because in 
every single school district, every 
school that has allowed them to carry, 
there hasn’t just been no mass shoot-
ings, there hasn’t been a single shoot-
ing. Why? 
Because these insane individuals, 
they seek one thing. They seek some 
twisted version of glory, which in-
volves a body count. And they know 
they will not achieve that if they walk 
into that school and the first thing 
they see when they whip out their gun 
is a staff member who is armed and 
trained, and they die unceremoniously. 
That is what they deserve. 
Put three of those on the news, and 
you could stop this. 
So we should quit advertising our 
schools. Quit making that the Federal 
default that they are sitting ducks. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the distinguished 
gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. 
CICILLINE), a member of the Judiciary 
Committee. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, al-
most 6 years ago I sat down right here 
on this floor with the late, great John 
Lewis and so many colleagues to pro-
test the Republicans’ unwillingness to 
take up gun safety legislation after the 
Orlando shooting at the Pulse night-
club. 
We promised to the American people 
that if we were given the majority, we 
would deliver on gun safety legislation. 
Last year, we passed bills for ex-
panded criminal background checks 
and to close the Charleston loophole to 
ensure criminals can’t buy firearms. 
And 
today, 
we 
will 
pass 
groundbreaking legislation to address 
gun violence and the epidemic of gun 
violence in our country. 
Gun violence is the crisis of this gen-
eration. There isn’t a person or a com-
munity in this country that isn’t af-
fected by gun violence. It doesn’t mat-
ter if you are rich or poor, in a city or 
suburb, young or old. We are all a text 
message away from this happening to 
any one of us. 
In the last 159 days alone, we have 
had more than 240 mass shootings in

this country; almost 19,000 dead from 
guns, and 27 school shootings. Children 
killed in Uvalde, Parkland, Sandy 
Hook, and many more places across the 
country. 
Enough is enough. It is time to do 
something. Every minute we wait, 
every minute we fail to act, we sen-
tence more Americans and more chil-
dren to death by guns in this country. 
The Protecting Our Kids Act is a 
smart, commonsense package that will 
save lives. I urge my colleagues to take 
this first step with us. Help reduce gun 
violence in this country. Protect your 
constituents from the gun violence 
that 
is 
ravaging 
communities 
all 
across America. 
And we can’t stop here. This is a 
great bill. There is a lot more work to 
be done to make certain that kids and 
all the members of our communities 
are safe. 
But have the courage to stand up. 
Actually, it doesn’t take a lot of cour-
age. Do your job. Protect your con-
stituents from these horrific acts of 
gun violence. 
Vote ‘‘yes’’ on this legislation. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are directed to address their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Arizona (Mr. BIGGS). 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
I oppose H.R. 7910, the Democrats’ 
latest gun control effort. Supporters of 
this bill do not want to protect Amer-
ica’s Second Amendment rights be-
cause they don’t care about Second 
Amendment rights. 
Instead of addressing the societal 
issues that have been caused by dec-
ades of progressive leftwing policies 
that have assaulted the American fam-
ily and American society, they want to 
ban guns. 
They ignore the fact that many of 
the cities with the most restrictive gun 
control laws also have the highest lev-
els of crime. They simply do not ac-
knowledge that they don’t believe in 
the Second Amendment. 
But let’s talk about what Repub-
licans have proposed because Repub-
licans have proposed many efforts. You 
just heard from Mr. MASSIE one of his. 
Well, here is what you don’t hear. I 
listened very carefully to the majority 
leader. He was enumerating through 
polls. But guess what? The majority of 
Americans believe schools would be 
safer if teachers were given options to 
carry a firearm. That comes from The 
Economist, the latest Economist poll 
last week. 
A similar poll: 26 percent are safer 
with an armed guard. Utah allows 
teachers to carry a concealed weapon. 
They not only have not had a mass 
shooting, they have never had a shoot-
ing since that law has been in place. 
Justice Scalia said in his Heller opin-
ion that the very text of the Second 
Amendment implicitly recognizes the 
pre-existence of the right, the Second 
Amendment right, and declares only 
that it shall not be infringed. This is 
not a right granted by the Constitu-
tion. Neither is it in any manner de-
pendent upon that instrument for its 
existence. 
The Second Amendment simply de-
clares that it shall not be infringed, 
but that is exactly what your bills do. 
The Republicans have also said, let’s 
harden the schools. Look, you have got 
$122 billion that you gave in relief, 
COVID relief to K–12. More than 90 per-
cent of it remains unused. 
And you say, well, we don’t want to 
talk about doors. What do we do? We 
hide behind doors because they work. 
You can harden schools and make 
them work. You can arm guards and 
make them work and make children 
safer. 
We all condemn the acts of violence 
that have occurred throughout our 
country, but the answer cannot be re-
stricting America’s right to protect 
themselves. Every day, Americans use 
guns to protect themselves and their 
families. This bill will make it harder 
for Americans to do this. That is an in-
convenient fact that my colleagues 
across the aisle simply can’t and 
choose not to address. 
Last week, at markup, Democrats re-
peatedly claimed that good guys with 
guns do not stop bad guys with guns. 
But Congressman MASSIE read a long 
list of incidents of good guys using 
guns to stop bad guys. But that list 
was ignored. 
I will give you one. In Charleston, 
West Virginia, a woman with a 9-milli-
meter 
handgun 
stopped 
a 
shooter 
shooting into a crowd with an AR–15. 
Here 
is 
one. 
Stephen 
Willeford 
stopped a shooting at a church in Suth-
erland Springs. 
I urge you to vote ‘‘no.’’ 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman from California (Mr. LIEU), 
a member of the Judiciary Committee. 
Mr. LIEU. Madam Speaker, when I 
served in the U.S. military, I was 
trained on firearms. 
Let me tell you what a bullet from 
an AR–15 does to you. The bullet leaves 
the muzzle of the AR–15 at a speed 
three times higher than that of a hand-
gun. The energy is so strong that the 
bullet will disintegrate 3 inches of your 
bone. 
A person shot with an AR–15 looks 
like a grenade exploded in their body. 
The bullet also causes your human 
flesh to ripple violently, so that even if 
the bullet misses your artery, the 
human flesh, the ripples can burst arte-
ries anyway. 
In Uvalde, Texas, little kids were de-
capitated and had their faces blown off. 
A person under 21 cannot buy a 
Budweiser. We should not let a person 
under 21 buy an AR–15 weapon of war. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
b 1545 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. 
JAYAPAL), a member of the Judiciary 
Committee. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Madam Speaker, the 
Protecting Our Kids Act is about say-
ing no more to mass shootings, no 
more to children murdered in schools, 
no more to Black people murdered at 
the grocery store, no more to doctors 
being murdered in hospitals, no more 
to losing our children, our fathers, 
mothers, siblings, and friends in this 
uniquely American epidemic of gun vi-
olence. 
The families who have lost loved ones 
know that these deaths are not inevi-
table. We need to act now. 
This bill has simple but effective so-
lutions: Raise the minimum age to 21 
to buy a semiautomatic rifle, prohibit 
gun trafficking and high-capacity mag-
azines, require safe storage, and crack 
down on ghost guns and bump stocks. 
Had these protections been enacted 
in 1999, they would have stopped at 
least 35 recent mass shootings and 
saved over 400 lives. 
Today, we can choose to mean it 
when we say ‘‘never again.’’ Vote 
‘‘yes.’’ Save lives. Save children. Save 
our communities. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman 
from 
Florida 
(Mrs. 
DEMINGS), a member of the Judiciary 
Committee. 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Madam Speaker, as 
a police chief, I was expected to get 
things done, to do everything within 
my power to keep people safe. 
Offering thoughts and prayers is fine. 
My grandchildren do that. But if that 
was all I did as a police chief after 
mass shootings, no one would have let 
me get away with that. Well, there is 
an expectation for Congress, too, to do 
more. 
Madam Speaker, what is painfully 
wrong with this tragic moment in our 
history are the people who want the 
power of the position but not really the 
responsibility. 
Congress failed that little girl who 
could only be identified by her green 
tennis shoes. Congress failed the loved 
ones in Buffalo, at the Pulse nightclub, 
and in Newtown. 
After the Parkland shooting in Flor-
ida, Republican legislators helped pass 
red flag laws and other meaningful leg-
islation to keep guns out of the hands 
of dangerous people. 
Will we do something? Haven’t we 
had enough, or is it just too scary to do 
the right thing? 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I

gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
CORREA), a member of the Judiciary 
Committee. 
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of the Protecting Our 
Kids Act. 
Over the last 20 years, we have lost 
thousands of lives—thousands of lives—

to mass shootings. Gun violence is now 
the leading cause of death of children 
in America. Let me repeat: Gun vio-
lence is now the top cause of death of 
children in America. 
This legislation is not perfect, but if 
we can save one, two, three lives by 
passing this legislation, then it is 
worth our effort. 
It is our obligation to pass this legis-
lation. Our thoughts and prayers are 
not enough. We have to act and act 
now, and I call on my colleagues to 
join us in voting in favor of protecting 
our kids. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. GARCIA), 
a member of the Judiciary Committee. 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today in strong support of 
H.R. 7910, the Protecting Our Kids Act, 
and H.R. 2377, the Federal Extreme 
Risk Protection Order Act. 
In Texas, our souls are crushed, and 
our hearts are still broken. We stand in 
solidarity with our friends and neigh-
bors in Uvalde and communities across 
the Nation, mourning the lives of those 
who have lost their lives to gun vio-
lence. 
Empathy, love, and morality are call-
ing upon us to pass these bills that are 
commonsense legislation to reduce gun 
violence and save children’s lives. 
Let’s not be deceived by the absurd 
proposition to arm our teachers in 
schools. Let’s let schools be schools. A 
teacher should be armed with books, 
not guns. Children need to focus on 
learning the ABCs, not how to dodge 
bullets. 
I urge my colleagues across the aisle 
to consult their conscience, not the 
NRA, and vote ‘‘yes’’ on these meas-
ures. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, how 
much time remains on each side. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New York has 401⁄2 min-
utes remaining. The gentleman from 
Ohio has 381⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
Colorado 
(Mr. 
NEGUSE), a member of the Judiciary 
Committee. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today not to offer my words but the 
words of a brave Coloradan, Tom Mau-
ser. Tom’s son, Daniel, was murdered 
at Columbine High School 23 years ago 
in 1999. He was 15 years old, the same 
age as me. 
Tom shared with me that in the 
weeks before his death, Daniel asked 
him, ‘‘Dad, did you know there are 
loopholes in the Brady Bill?’’ 
At 15 years old, Daniel was able to 
see the gaping holes in our Nation’s 
gun laws. Tragically, so were the two 
18-year-old killers, teenagers that, in 
Tom’s 
words, 
‘‘saw 
loopholes 
big 
enough to drive a truck through.’’ 
As Tom said to me today, what has 
Congress really done to protect our 
precious children from gun violence in 
those 23 years? Shamefully, nothing. 
It is time for Congress to do its job. 
It is time to act and to demonstrate 
that you give a damn about our chil-
dren. TOM is right. I beg my colleagues, 
support this commonsense bill. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Wisconsin (Mr. FITZGERALD). 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in opposition to H.R. 7910. 
I thought I would take this oppor-
tunity to do my own fact check on 
some of the inaccurate claims my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
presented at last week’s markup. 
My Democrat colleagues will often 
claim there are loopholes in the cur-
rent background check system, some-
times specifically citing the Charleston 
loophole. This is simply not true. Fed-
eral firearms licensees cannot transfer 
a firearm without performing a back-
ground check on the purchaser. 
The FBI is notified immediately if a 
prohibited person attempts to purchase 
a weapon, and the FBI has 3 days to 
follow up. The 3 days for follow-up pre-
vent the FBI from sitting on their 
hands and not following through with 
background checks as a way to deny a 
person a firearm by bureaucracy and, 
therefore, take away their Second 
Amendment rights. 
Another claim frequently made by 
my colleagues is that banning so-called 
assault weapons, a term they rarely de-
fine, would reduce mass shootings. De-
spite automatic weapons already being 
illegal to the general public, the left 
uses the term ‘‘assault weapons’’ to de-
scribe scary-looking guns, regardless of 
the actual characteristics of the fire-
arm. Even weapons mischaracterized as 
assault weapons are used in less than 1 
percent of all homicides. 
Many of my colleagues claim man-
dating so-called safe storage of fire-
arms is a commonsense approach to re-
ducing gun violence. Not only does a 
requirement to keep a firearm within 
the home unloaded or locked up not 
comply with Supreme Court precedent, 
but it also puts them at a disadvan-
tage. 
Listen, if you want to accomplish 
something today, pass what many 
States have done, and that is to make 
resources available to secure schools. 
Madam Speaker, $100 million, and over 
1,300 Wisconsin schools have removed 
themselves from the list of the most 
vulnerable with State dollars. Let’s do 
that today and really accomplish some-
thing. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. 
DEAN), the vice chair of the Judiciary 
Committee. 
Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, it is said 
that a civilized society that can no 
longer feel outrage can no longer be 
civilized. 
Ten people slaughtered in their gro-
cery store. Nineteen children and two 
teachers massacred in their school, 
only to have parents who had dropped 
their children off in the morning wait 
in some horror line to offer DNA sam-
ples. At least 15 people murdered in 
mass shootings just this weekend, in-
cluding in my home city, Philadelphia. 
Outrage. We must feel the outrage. 
Do these tragedies from guns in the 
hands of bad actors sound like the well- 
regulated militia explicitly mentioned 
in the Second Amendment? Of course 
not. It is outrageous. 
We want to save our children. We 
want to save our babies. We want to 
save our families, the elderly who live 
in constant fear. 
Yet, did you hear, Madam Speaker, 
the argument on the other side of the 
aisle? A God-given right for an 18-year- 
old to slaughter children in a school? 
Enough is enough. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Georgia (Mrs. MCBATH), a member 
of the Judiciary Committee who knows 
the tragedy of gun violence personally. 
Mrs. MCBATH. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of the Protecting 
Our Kids Act, a chance for us to keep 
our families healthy and whole and 
safe. 
Day after day, hour after hour, the 
American people have felt the pain and 
the horror and the despair of yet an-
other mass shooting, another family 
torn apart, another community bro-
ken. 
I know that feeling. You know my 
story. My son, Jordan, was just 17 
years old when he was shot by a man 
who simply didn’t like the loud music 
that he was playing in his car. 
How long do we let American fami-
lies in this country keep suffering this 
pain? 
That is why we must pass this com-
monsense legislation, why we must 
take this step toward ensuring that we 
are creating true progress for the next 
generation. 
Americans deserve better, and shame 
on us if we do not take action. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman 
from 
Texas 
(Ms. 
ESCOBAR), a member of the Judiciary 
Committee. 
Ms. ESCOBAR. Madam Speaker, on 
August 3, 2019, in El Paso, a white su-
premacist massacred 23 innocent peo-
ple at Walmart. Our red flag bill might 
have saved them. 
On August 31, 2019, eight people were 
killed in Midland-Odessa by a man who 
failed his background check and pur-
chased a gun through a private sale. 
Our bill on private firearm sales might 
have saved them. 
On May 18, 2018, at Santa Fe High 
School, a 17-year-old used his father’s 
gun to kill 10 people. Our safe storage 
bill might have saved them.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5377 
June 8, 2022 
In Uvalde, parents are burying their 
babies today after an 18-year-old pur-
chased an AR–15-style rifle and slaugh-
tered 21 individuals. Our bill raising 
the age to 21 might have saved them. 
These are just the recent Texas mass 
shootings. 
It is not the teachers, the schools, or 
the doors. It is the guns. 
We can’t save every life, but my God, 
shouldn’t we try? 
We hear Americans, and today in the 
House, we are taking the action you 
are demanding. Take note of who is 
with you and who is not. I am proud to 
remain El Paso Strong. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman from New York (Mr. JONES), 
a member of the Judiciary Committee. 
Mr. JONES. Madam Speaker, I rise 
because we find ourselves on a path 
that we have traveled before, a path 
that the American people were prom-
ised they would never have to meet 
again after Columbine, after Sandy 
Hook, after Parkland, and now after 
Uvalde. 
For two decades—two decades—Re-
publicans bought by the NRA have 
blocked every attempt to pass legisla-
tion that would stop children from 
being massacred in their classrooms. 
Why? Because nothing is easier than 
buying an AR–15 in this country except 
buying a Republican Member of Con-
gress. 
Today, Democrats in the House will 
pass the Protecting Our Kids Act, and 
we need the Senate to abolish the fili-
buster to do the same. 
b 1600 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the distinguished 
gentlewoman 
from 
Illinois 
(Ms. 
KELLY). 
Ms. 
KELLY 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, for years I have heard that 
tired argument that gun violence pre-
vention legislation won’t work. ‘‘Just 
look at Chicago,’’ they say, ‘‘where 
residents have some of the strictest 
gun laws but the highest rates of gun 
violence.’’ 
The reason for that is simple—gun 
trafficking. More than 60 percent of 
guns used in crimes in Chicago come 
from out of State, and we are not the 
only city where this happens. 
According to the ATF, from just 2016 
to 2020, one-third of the more than 1.3 
million 
crime 
guns 
recovered 
and 
traced 
by 
law 
enforcement 
were 
brought in across State lines. These 
guns are purchased in States with lax 
laws, trafficked across State lines, and 
then sold to people in our State who we 
know should not have a gun. 
In Illinois, we are doing everything 
we can to protect our residents. Our 
neighbors are failing us. That is why I 
introduced 
the 
Prevent Gun Traf-
ficking Act, and why I am so glad this 
solution is included in the Protecting 
Our Kids Act. This is a simple, com-
monsense solution. Making straw pur-
chasing a Federal crime will help stop 
the flow of guns into our communities 
from out of State. Most importantly, it 
will save lives. 
Stopping gun trafficking and straw 
purchasing is just one step we can take 
to eliminate gun violence. The Pro-
tecting Our Kids Act is a smart, broad 
approach to a complex issue. Passing 
this bill is the next step forward in sav-
ing children, and we cannot wait. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Connecticut (Ms. DELAURO), the 
distinguished chairwoman of the Ap-
propriations Committee. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of the Protecting Our 
Kids Act, a comprehensive package to 
address gun violence in the United 
States. I am pleased that it includes 
my legislation, Ethan’s Law, which 
will keep kids across the country safe 
by ensuring that firearms are safely 
stored and secured. 
I introduced Ethan’s Law in the 
House over 3 years ago in memory of 
Ethan Song, a Guilford, Connecticut, 
teenager, 15 years old, who acciden-
tally shot himself with an unsecured 
gun in 2018. The firearm was improp-
erly stored in a Tupperware box with 
the gun lock keys and the ammunition 
nearby. 
Before I had the honor of introducing 
Ethan’s Law in Congress, it passed the 
Connecticut General Assembly and the 
State senate with broad bipartisan sup-
port, signed into law in 2019. Today, we 
take a critical step to make Ethan’s 
Law the national standard in safe stor-
age. 
Ethan’s Law will set a Federal stand-
ard for safe gun storage and incentivize 
States to create and implement safe 
gun storage laws. This legislation is a 
child safety bill, first and foremost, be-
cause losing just one child to acci-
dental gun violence is too many. 
What happened to Ethan was tragic. 
No parent should have to lose their 
child because of an unsecured gun. It is 
time for Congress to act. 
In the words of Ethan Song’s parents, 
Mike and Kristin Song, whose relent-
less advocacy led us to this moment: 
‘‘Not a single person on Earth can 
change the past, but every one of us 
can change the future.’’ Let’s change 
the future while saving countless lives 
by passing the Protecting Our Kids 
Act. 
When Kristin Song found out that 
Ethan’s Law was included in the Pro-
tecting Our Kids Act, she said that the 
first person she wanted to tell was 
Ethan, her beautiful boy, that she has 
fearlessly fought for since the day she 
was forced to watch him be lowered 
into the ground. Upon hearing the 
news, she immediately drove to the 
cemetery, and she ran across it yelling, 
‘‘Ethan, we did it. Your lifesaving leg-
islation will be heard, it will get a 
vote.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I am voting in favor 
of this legislation. I urge my col-
leagues to do the same. 
We love you, Ethan. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK). 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, 
this is called the Protecting Our Kids 
Act, but sadly it does no such thing. 
The one thing that we could do imme-
diately to protect our kids is the one 
thing that the Democrats refuse even 
to consider. 
We think nothing of it when we see 
an armed guard at a bank. Well, they 
are there for one purpose—to stop any-
one who is trying to steal our money. 
And, yet, when we suggest that we 
should use the same force and resolve 
to stop someone from killing our chil-
dren, the left goes berserk. I simply do 
not understand such a screwed-up 
value system as that. 
President 
Biden’s 
press 
secretary 
says that hardening our schools is not 
something he supports. Think about 
that. The most heavily guarded person 
in the world in the most hardened for-
tress in the country is telling us that 
we cannot protect our children and our 
schools as seriously as we protect our 
money in our banks. Of course, hard-
ening the schools works. 
Listen to the sick mind that pro-
duced the massacre in Buffalo. He 
wrote, ‘‘Attacking in a weapon-re-
stricted area may decrease the chance 
of civilian backlash. Schools, courts, or 
areas where CCW are outlawed or pro-
hibited may be good areas of attack. 
Areas where CCW permits are low may 
also fit in this category. Areas with 
strict gun laws are also great places of 
attack.’’ That is the Buffalo shooter. 
Criminals understand that even if the 
Democrats in this House do not. 
In committee, I offered an amend-
ment to require schools receiving Fed-
eral security funds to have at least one 
armed guard on every campus and to 
allow school officials who have met the 
requirements of their State to carry a 
concealed weapon to have it on campus 
to protect their students if they want 
to. This is something that can be im-
plemented immediately and that could 
well have stopped the massacre at 
Uvalde. 
It doesn’t depend on criminals obey-
ing the law, as this bill does. It doesn’t 
depend on someday, maybe, reducing 
possibly the 400 million firearms in this 
country. It doesn’t make self-defense 
harder for honest and decent people. In 
fact, it makes self-defense easier for 
honest and decent people. It would 
make future attacks on our schools 
much less likely to succeed and infi-
nitely more dangerous to those con-
templating such an act. Yet, the Demo-
crats refuse to even consider it. 
We know how to reduce gun violence. 
Harden our schools and protect our

children with the same seriousness as 
we protect our money. Prosecute gun 
criminals. Send them to prison for the 
rest of their lives. Execute murderers. 
Confine the dangerously mentally ill so 
that we can treat them. Stop letting 
terrorists into the country across our 
southern border. 
Yet, woke district attorneys often 
refuse to prosecute gun criminals or 
they quickly drop gun charges to re-
duce their sentences. The Democrats 
have all but abolished the death pen-
alty. They have released dangerous 
criminals from our prisons, released 
dangerous criminal, illegal aliens into 
our communities, flooded our streets 
with the dangerously mentally ill, and 
turned a blind eye as terrorists come 
across the border that they have left 
wide open. And then they wonder why 
we are plagued with violent criminals. 
Maybe it is time to get serious about 
removing criminals from our streets 
and fortifying our schools. That is 
something we could do today that will 
have an immediate effect today. 
Protecting Our Kids Act. It does no 
such thing. It is a tale told by an idiot 
full of sound and fury signifying noth-
ing. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
Maryland 
(Mr. 
BROWN). 
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Madam 
Speaker, again and again we hear a 
common refrain when a mass shooting 
happens, a young man, typically under 
the age of 21, legally purchases a semi-
automatic rifle and murders innocent 
people. We saw this in Uvalde; we saw 
this in Buffalo; we saw this in Indian-
apolis in 2021; and we saw this in Park-
land in 2019. In fact, six of the nine 
deadliest mass shootings since 2018 
were by young men who should never 
have been allowed to purchase these 
weapons in the first place. 
Right now, you must be 21 in this 
country to buy a handgun but only 
need to be 18 years old to buy a semi-
automatic rifle capable of committing 
unspeakable tragedies. I served in the 
military. I trained with these weapons. 
I know what they can do. 
These weapons of war have no place 
in our neighborhoods, let alone in the 
hands of an untrained 18-year-old boy. 
The answer is simple—raise the age 
needed to purchase these weapons to 
21, in line with the age to purchase 
handguns. We have bipartisan support 
for this: Democrats, Republicans, gun 
safety advocates, law-abiding citizens 
and responsible gun owners, teachers, 
and veterans, because it is common 
sense. 
Shooting after shooting, we ask our-
selves what more could we have done. 
We debate whether one action could 
have saved the lives of those children, 
those mothers, fathers, grandmothers, 
and neighbors. I am done with that. It 
is time for action. 
Raising the age to buy these weapons 
won’t solve our Nation’s gun violence 
epidemic overnight, but if we can make 
it just a little harder for someone to 
get their hands on these deadly weap-
ons, if we can save just one life or one 
community from this carnage and 
grief, it will be worth it. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation. 
Raise the age to buy these deadly 
weapons. Enough is enough. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman 
from Michigan (Mr. WALBERG). 
Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, the 
despicable violence that took place in 
Uvalde and other places was horrific, 
and we mourn the loss of innocent life. 
The thought of losing my fourth-grade 
grandson in this way shakes me to the 
core. 
There are steps we can take to pre-
vent tragedies from occurring without 
endangering and infringing upon the 
rights of law-abiding citizens. I will not 
support legislation taking away the 
Second Amendment rights of my con-
stituents. We must focus on root 
causes of violent crimes and the many 
cultural issues plaguing our society. 
As a Nation, we face a severe mental 
health crisis, fatherless homes, break-
down of families, glorification of vio-
lence that permeates our culture at 
every level, even to the devaluation of 
63 million innocent babies’ lives taken 
in the last 50 years. It must be all- 
hands-on-deck—in 
our 
homes, 
our 
schools, and our churches—to address 
the foundational issues that keep our 
kids and communities safe. 
Madam Speaker, let’s not just do 
something. Harden our schools. Tackle 
them with real solutions. Oppose this 
legislation and do the right thing to 
save innocent lives. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the distinguished 
gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. 
LANGEVIN). 
Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to plead with my colleagues 
to support H.R. 7910, the Protecting 
Our Kids Act. 
We gather just days after an 18-year- 
old mowed down 19 schoolchildren and 
two of their teachers with an AR–15. 
Just days earlier, a racist conspiracy 
theorist used that same type of weapon 
of war to murder 10 Americans, turning 
a grocery store into a bloody battle-
field. Nineteen families in Uvalde and 
10 families in Buffalo are permanently 
shattered, never to be the same again. 
On average, more than 110 Americans 
suffer the same fate, death by gun, 
every single day. 
Madam Speaker, no one can tell me 
that I don’t know what I am talking 
about when it comes to damage that 
guns can do. Forty-two years ago, I was 
a sixteen-year-old police cadet when a 
gun misfired, severing my spinal cord, 
and changing my life forever. 
Of course, we will never be able to 
stop every single gun injury or death, 
but we have the power to act, to pass 
commonsense gun safety laws that re-
duce the preventable heartbreak expe-
rienced by far too many families in 
this country. We must get illegal guns 
off our streets. We must pass red flag 
laws to keep guns out of the wrong 
hands. We must raise the minimum age 
to buy a semiautomatic assault weapon 
to 21, and we can. 
These 
are 
commonsense 
policies, 
backed by broad, bipartisan majorities 
of Americans. But instead, some of my 
colleagues have the audacity to sug-
gest that we turn our schools into 
armed fortresses. 
What 
is 
next? 
Armed 
churches? 
Armed movie theaters? Is this the 
country you want to leave to your chil-
dren and grandchildren? I certainly 
don’t. 
Madam Speaker, guns are now the 
leading cause of death for children in 
this country. No other developed coun-
try on Earth would ever tolerate this 
level of gun violence, and we shouldn’t, 
either. 
Those children in Uvalde deserved to 
grow up. 
The victims in Buffalo deserved to 
return home safe. 
And the 40,000 Americans who die 
from guns every year deserved to live. 
The American people are counting on 
us to deliver change. I pray that we 
won’t let them down. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Utah (Mr. OWENS). 
b 1615 
Mr. OWENS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in opposition to H.R. 7910. The violence 
that occurred in Uvalde, Texas, was 
horrific. As we consider the pain these 
families are experiencing, we can do 
more now. Let us focus today like a 
laser beam on protecting our precious 
children. 
My friends on the other side of the 
aisle want us to vote on a hasty, par-
tisan, and overreaching package of 
bills they developed in the middle of 
the night without any Republican 
input. 
The legislation we are considering 
today is clearly designed to strip law- 
abiding Americans of their constitu-
tional rights. In a town hall meeting 
last summer, President Biden himself 
said he would like to ban the sale of 
handguns and rifles, full stop. It is no 
wonder law-abiding Americans see this 
legislation as central Federal over-
reach. 
History has taught us some great les-
sons. One is that, ‘‘Liberty, once lost, 
is lost forever.’’ 
I grew up in the Deep South where, 
for a time, Black Americans were un-
able to defend themselves. After the 
Civil War, Democrat Black Codes and 
Jim Crow laws prohibited people of 
color from owning firearms. 
Most people have heard the phrase, 
‘‘40 acres and a mule,’’ the order issued 
in 1865 that allowed 40,000 former slaves 
to live on hundreds of thousands of 
acres. 
After the assassination of Abraham 
Lincoln, the Democrat President, An-
drew Johnson, a Confederate sym-
pathizer, confiscated this land, dis-
placing thousands of Black Americans

and families. This is an example of why 
the right to bear arms is necessary to 
safeguard and protect our life, liberty, 
and property. 
The 
Democrats’ 
proposals 
are 
unhelpful in protecting our kids and go 
against all common sense. They ignore 
real solutions that will keep our chil-
dren safe and help prevent future acts 
of senseless violence. 
Most importantly, they are not pro-
posing anything that protects our chil-
dren now. We don’t need to spend an-
other 2 years fighting over solutions. 
We have solutions available imme-
diately. The Securing Our Students 
Act, my legislation, would empower 
local school districts to immediately 
receive unspent funds from the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan and implement secu-
rity measures in their schools now. 
Of the $122 billion appropriated to the 
America’s K–12 schools in last year’s 
$1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, 
roughly 93 percent remains unspent. I 
invite my colleagues to join me in de-
manding these hundreds of billions of 
dollars be immediately used to help 
local schools determine and implement 
the safety measures that best fit their 
communities. 
We 
can 
harden 
our 
schools and protect our children at 
school now. 
We can never bring back those pre-
cious children we lost, but we can, and 
we must, work together to prevent fu-
ture tragedies. 
This is a solution that will harness 
the full weight of American innovation 
and technology and keep our schools 
safe now to ensure that no child, edu-
cator, or family has to say goodbye to 
a loved one because of any kind of vio-
lence. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman from Michigan, (Mr. LEVIN). 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Speaker, I thank Chairman NADLER for 
pulling this vital package together. 
I speak as a father of four who is 
heartbroken 
and 
still 
processing 
Uvalde, Buffalo, and the unending 
string of mass shootings; a longtime 
gun reform advocate and a member of 
the Gun Violence Prevention Task 
Force who demands real, commonsense 
gun reform to save lives now. 
That is why I support the Protecting 
Our Kids Act in this moment of pro-
found grief and collective loss. When it 
comes to the epidemic of gun deaths, 
there is no panacea. We must pass 
meaningful 
reforms, 
evaluate 
our 
work, and then keep on passing more 
legislation. 
Though I am extremely supportive of 
this long-overdue package, I am con-
cerned about criminal penalties for 
safe storage violations. Over-criminal-
ization too often harms Black and 
Brown communities. 
As a warrior for racial justice, I urge 
all of us to investigate how disparate 
communities would be impacted before 
this bill heads to the President’s desk. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to 
support this bill. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. ROY). 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Ohio for yielding. 
Why do we have guns? 
Why do we have the Second Amend-
ment? 
Is it to hunt? Sure. 
Self defense? That is even more im-
portant. 
The fact is, if you read the founders— 
Federalist No. 46, James Madison con-
trasts us with the tyrannical govern-
ments of Europe who are, ‘‘afraid to 
trust the people with arms.’’ 
Joseph Story in his Commentaries on 
the Constitution in 1833: ‘‘The right of 
the citizens to keep and bear arms has 
justly been considered as the palladium 
of the liberties of a republic. Since it 
offers a strong moral check against the 
usurpation and arbitrary power of rul-
ers; and will generally, even if these 
were successful in the first instance, 
enable the people to resist and triumph 
over them.’’ 
We have a Second Amendment be-
cause we understand in this country 
that there are some things, inalienable 
rights, that you cannot justly take 
away from a free and equal human 
being. Tyrants disarm the people they 
intend to oppress. Those are the facts. 
Jewish people in Germany were pro-
hibited from owning firearms; 13 mil-
lion Jews were exterminated by the 
Nazis. 
The Soviets instituted gun control 
and millions were killed; 20 million dis-
sidents 
were 
rounded 
up 
and 
exterminated. 
Mao disarmed the Chinese people; 20 
million dissidents were exterminated. 
In Cambodia, the Khmer Rouge was 
able to take advantage of the fact that 
limited gun ownership to just hunters 
and killed 1.5 million to 3 million Cam-
bodians. 
Turkey disarmed Armenians, and 1.5 
million Armenians were killed in the 
Armenian Genocide. 
The South disarmed slaves and ac-
tively fought against their arming. 
And then in the 20th century, armed 
Black Army veterans, for example, in 
Louisiana, were able to defend against 
the KKK. 
Even 
fact-checking 
organization 
Snopes said: ‘‘We find it reasonable to 
conclude that gun confiscations, facili-
tated by laws requiring the registra-
tion 
and/or 
licensing 
of 
firearms, 
played a crucial role in carrying out of 
20th-century genocides.’’ 
This is not fiction. This is in our life-
time. This is in our grandparents’ life-
time. This is in our recent history. 
This is why the Second Amendment 
matters. It is not trivial. It is not 
something you just brush aside. This is 
a foundation of liberty. It is who we 
are. But in order to sell a lie to the 
American people that the government 
will protect them from all manners of 
evil, while defunding the police, leav-
ing our borders wide open—I am glad 
my 
colleagues 
can 
suddenly 
find 
Uvalde on a map—while allowing dan-
gerous cartels operating hundreds of 
miles into Texas, allowing fentanyl to 
pour into our communities and kill 
tens of thousands of children—the very 
children my colleagues say they wish 
to protect. 
In order to do this, Democrats in this 
body are willing to take away citizens’ 
God-given right—yes, the God-given 
right that was mocked earlier—to pro-
tect himself or herself, or her family or 
his family, from harm—the very harm 
they foster by appeasing lawlessness, 
and importantly, from the very tyr-
anny being applied to them to deny 
that right. 
That is what is at stake, this bill; 
and it gets brushed aside, raise the age 
limit. Well, there are constitutional 
questions to that, in the 4th Circuit, 
9th Circuit, and other circuits. 
The second title in straw purchases, 
the very straw purchases the Democrat 
DAs don’t even want to really pros-
ecute, would prohibit a law-abiding cit-
izen from giving a gun to a friend as a 
gift. 
Safe storage would make it unlawful 
for me to have the 22- and the 20-gauge, 
propped up by my door right now in 
Texas, to kill coyotes and snakes. It 
would make it unlawful. 
This will not do any good. It will 
harm Americans, and it undermines 
our foundational liberties that are cru-
cial for a free state. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. 
MANNING). 
Ms. MANNING. Madam Speaker, so 
far this year, our country has experi-
enced more than 250 mass shootings. 
And it is only June. Gun violence is 
now the number one cause of death of 
children in this country. We cannot let 
this continue. 
The Protecting Our Kids Act is an 
important step toward curbing gun vio-
lence by limiting high-capacity maga-
zines, raising the minimum age to buy 
assault weapons to 21, and encouraging 
safe storage practices. 
If these measures had been in place, 
the 18-year-old gunman in Uvalde, 
Texas, would not have been able to buy 
the two assault weapons he used to 
murder 19 children and two teachers. 
The Dayton, Ohio, shooter would not 
have been able to buy the high-capac-
ity magazine that allowed him to shoot 
26 people in 30 seconds. 
Madam Speaker, we can’t solve this 
complex problem at once, but neither 
can we desist from taking common-
sense measures to help make this coun-
try safer for our children. Let’s honor 
our oath. Let’s do our job to keep the 
American people safe. Vote ‘‘yes’’ on 
this bill. It is the least we can do for 
our constituents. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
SPEIER).

June 8, 2022 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I be-
lieve I am the only Member of this 
House that is a victim of gun violence. 
My body is riddled with bullets. I have 
a divot in my leg that is the size of a 
football. I have skin grafts on all parts 
of my body. I live with that every sin-
gle day. 
A victim of gun violence is trauma-
tized over and over again. I implore my 
colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle, if we had a 737 that crashed every 
month for 12 months in this country, 
we would do something about it. And 
that is what is happening to children in 
this country. 
Madam Speaker, 1,500 kids die of gun 
violence every single year. We have to 
do something about it. All we are say-
ing is don’t let them purchase an as-
sault weapon until they are 21. We al-
ready say you can’t purchase a hand-
gun until you are 21. Dr. Guerrero this 
morning 
talked 
about 
decapitated 
heads. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues—I am leaving this institu-
tion—to please do something. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. SCHA-
KOWSKY). 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the chairman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I will share a con-
versation that I had with Anna Kate, 
who is a constituent of mine in my dis-
trict. She called my office absolutely 
distraught; this was late in the day of 
the shooting. She said that parents 
have really reached their breaking 
point right now and that she is afraid, 
and she is afraid for her 7-year-old son. 
She said, I want to tell my child, you 
will be safe in school. 
What a simple sentence that most 
parents—any parent—would want to 
say. ‘‘You will be safe in school.’’ 
But I can’t, she said. 
Children continue to die, and this is 
on all of us, all of our conscience. 
There is no issue more important than 
this. 
We can do something starting today, 
something real. We can finally pass 
this legislation. Let’s do it. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
ESHOO). 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the chairman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, where is the soul of 
America in this Chamber? I have lis-
tened to every speaker since the debate 
began. 
I think that Shakespeare would say: 
Thou dost protest too much. 
We have simple, profound facts. Our 
children are being blown away. Last 
week, the first funeral, that casket 
could not be opened. 
I think every single Member here is a 
parent. 
Walk 
behind 
that 
casket. 
Think of yourselves and your own chil-
dren. They deserve solutions to this. 
There has to be more from you than 
damning the Democratic Party. 
Come on. We are Members of Con-
gress. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 10 seconds to the 
gentlewoman. 
Ms. ESHOO. Many of us say a prayer, 
the Lord’s prayer. And at the end we 
say: And lead us not into temptation 
but deliver us from evil. Amen. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Wisconsin (Mr. TIFFANY). 
Mr. TIFFANY. Madam Speaker, not 
one word from our colleagues when it 
comes to the crime waves in cities like 
Chicago, Los Angeles, Milwaukee, Min-
neapolis, New York, San Francisco, 
and Philadelphia. 
To do so would be to criticize their 
own soft-on-crime policies. It has been 
going on for a decade now. They hope 
Americans ignore the inconvenient 
truth. Criminals don’t get background 
checks, and they don’t fear laws be-
cause rogue prosecutors financed by 
progressive dark money groups don’t 
enforce our laws. 
b 1630 
These 
criminal 
strongholds 
and 
Washington, D.C., have one thing in 
common: They are run by Democrats 
who refuse to enforce our laws. 
This administration, responsible for 
a 40-year inflation high, erasing our 
border, and a shrinking economy, will 
say anything to distract from their 
own failures. Jimmy Carter says thank 
you for making the seventies look 
good. 
Week after week, we hear about vio-
lent criminals revictimizing commu-
nities without being held accountable. 
The people furthering these policies 
and making our communities less safe 
are the same people who are fervently 
arguing 
to 
disarm 
Americans 
and 
defund the police. They are the same 
people weaponizing the FBI against 
their political opponents and the same 
people who want to repeal the Second 
Amendment. I wish they would just 
tell the American people the truth in-
stead of deploying Trojan horses. 
Whether it is rifle bans, 9-mm bans, 
Federal red flag laws, one thing is cer-
tain: They will not change the out-
comes for the people in those cities. 
As some Members of this body have 
said in the last few weeks: This is just 
the beginning. We will not stop. 
They will continue to erode our 
rights because they believe in a nanny- 
state government, not a government of 
the people. 
What Americans need is the enforce-
ment of our laws holding criminals ac-
countable and protecting our constitu-
tional rights. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD a May 27, 2022, 
piece from CNN titled ‘‘States with 
weaker gun laws have higher rates of 
firearm related homicides and suicides, 
study finds.’’ 
[From CNN, May 27, 2022] 
STATES WITH WEAKER GUN LAWS HAVE HIGH-
ER RATES OF FIREARM RELATED HOMICIDES 
AND SUICIDES, STUDY FINDS 
(By Emma Tucker and Priya Krishnakumar) 
A new study published Thursday by a lead-
ing non-profit organization that focuses on 
gun violence prevention found that there is a 
direct correlation in states with weaker gun 
laws and higher rates of gun deaths, includ-
ing 
homicides, 
suicides 
and 
accidental 
killings. 
The study by Everytown for Gun Safety de-
termined that California had the strongest 
gun laws in the country. Hawaii topped the 
list with the lowest rate of gun deaths in the 
country while Mississippi led the country 
with both the weakest gun laws and highest 
rate of gun deaths. 
‘‘What this project does, is show what 
we’ve been saying for years: Gun laws save 
lives,’’ said Nick Suplina, senior vice presi-
dent of law and policy at Everytown for Gun 
Safety Support Fund. ‘‘We think this is 
going to be a really important tool for law-
makers, reporters and advocates that have 
been looking for the kind of visual tool that 
can make that case clearly.’’ 
To compile its list, the group used data 
from the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, looked at each state’s rate of 
gun deaths in 2020 and compared those rates 
with 50 policies that they say are scientif-
ically proven to be effective in preventing 
gun violence, Suplina said. 
The research team then weighed the list of 
gun safety policies based on their efficacy, 
ranked each state on its implementation of 
those policies and compared that score with 
the rates of gun deaths in each state, he said. 
The CDC’s data includes homicides, acci-
dental killings and suicides committed by 
guns. According to the CDC, over 45,000 peo-
ple in the United States were killed with a 
firearm in 2020—more than half died by sui-
cide. 
The analysis, first reported by CNN, put 
California at the top of the list for gun law 
strength—a composite score of 84.5 out of 100, 
with one of the lowest rates of gun deaths 
per 100,000 residents, at 8.5 out of 30 and 
below the national average of 13.6. Hawaii 
has the lowest rate of gun deaths in the 
country with the second strongest gun law 
score. It also has the lowest rate of gun own-
ership, with firearms in 9 percent of house-
holds, the data shows. 
As state legislatures begin to convene for 
their 2022 legislative sessions, lawmakers 
will consider a breadth of bills that either 
loosen or expand gun protections across var-
ious states. 
‘‘I have seen firsthand in California that 
the work we have done to strengthen gun 
laws has been both life-saving and effective,’’ 
said Rep. Mike Thompson (D–CA). chair of 
the House Gun Violence Prevention Task 
Force. ‘‘Gun laws work, and we need them 
across the board to ensure that felons, do-
mestic abusers, and those with mental 
health issues can’t simply go to the next 
state over to circumvent the very laws 
meant to keep guns out of their hands.’’ 
CNN has reached out to the National Rifle 
Association (NRA) to comment on the re-
search, but it declined to do so before seeing 
the data. 
Mississippi has the weakest gun laws with 
a score of 3 out of 100 and has the highest 
rate of gun deaths per 100,000 residents—28.6 
out of 30, the research shows. 
Massachusetts has adopted 37 of the 50 
policies and has the second-lowest rate of

gun deaths, while Missouri has only eight of 
the gun safety policies and the fourth high-
est rate of gun deaths in the US. Louisiana 
and Wyoming are among the top five states 
with the highest gun deaths and the weakest 
gun safety laws. 
‘‘Lawmakers in the states at the bottom 
can’t pretend to be ignorant about the im-
portance of gun laws after looking at this re-
port,’’ said Shannon Watts, the founder of 
Moms Demand Action, which has been fight-
ing for gun safety measures since the 2012 
Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 
Connecticut that killed 20 children and six 
educators. 
Mother and activist DeAndra Dycus said 
the gun violence problem in Indianapolis is 
‘‘tearing our community apart.’’ 
Nearly eight years ago, her 13-year-old son, 
DeAndre ‘‘Dre’’ Knox, was shot in the back 
left side of his head at a birthday party in 
Indianapolis when shots were fired during a 
confrontation between two boys. DeAndre, 
now 21, survived after being on life support 
for several days, Dycus said, and he cur-
rently lives in a facility with non-verbal 
quadriplegic paralysis. 
‘‘As a mother, when I look at him, I see ev-
erything that was taken away,’’ Dycus said. 
‘‘My son was a dreamer. He was a scholar. He 
was on this road to being something great.’’ 
‘‘But on the flip side, I see this little boy 
who has made such an impact, not just on 
our city but our country, as it pertains to 
what it looks like to survive,’’ she said. ‘‘Dre 
has embodied that.’’ 
Everytown 
designated 
a 
list 
of 
five 
foundational laws that have proven to be the 
most effective in lowering gun violence 
rates. These include requirements for a back-
ground check and/or permits to purchase 
handguns; a permit to carry concealed guns 
in public; the secure storage of firearms; the 
rejection of ‘Stand Your Ground’ laws; and 
the enactment of ‘extreme risk’ laws that 
temporarily remove a person’s access to fire-
arms when there is evidence that they pose 
a serious risk to themselves or others, ac-
cording to Everytown. 
Last year, several conservative states— 
such as Texas, Iowa, Tennessee, Montana, 
Utah and Wyoming—passed legislation al-
lowing some form of permitless carry as 
President Joe Biden pushed forward execu-
tive actions to address gun violence fol-
lowing several high-profile mass shootings. 
In Texas, the controversial ‘‘constitutional 
carry’’ legislation went into effect in Sep-
tember that allows most Texans who legally 
own a firearm to carry it openly in public 
without obtaining a permit or training. 
Supporters of the bill have argued that by 
removing the licensing requirement they are 
removing an ‘‘artificial barrier’’ to residents’ 
right to bear arms under the Constitution 
and ensuring more Texans have access to 
‘‘the protection of themselves or their fami-
lies’’ in public. But law enforcement officials 
and experts have expressed concerns that the 
open carrying of firearms makes it more dif-
ficult for police to quell violence. 
‘‘As we’ve seen gun extremism continue to 
rise in this country, we’ve also seen people 
who open carry start out at marches and ral-
lies and then show up in elected officials’ 
homes, in polling places, statehouses and 
then on January 6th at the US Capitol,’’ 
Watts said. 
According to Watts, the shooting in a 
Michigan high school in December that 
killed four students is a ‘‘textbook example’’ 
of why laws that require the secure storage 
of firearms are essential to gun safety. 
The alleged gunman in that shooting, 15- 
year-old Ethan Crumbley, is accused of fa-
tally shooting four classmates and wounding 
several others on November 30. His parents 
were charged with four counts of involuntary 
manslaughter in the same incident. All three 
have pleaded not guilty. 
Prosecutors allege that James Crumbley, 
the father of the suspected shooter, bought 
the gun used in the shooting four days ear-
lier. The incident prompted outrage over 
Ethan’s alleged accessibility to the gun, ar-
guing that the shooting could have been pre-
vented. 
Only 23 states currently have some sem-
blance of a secure storage requirement, 
Watts said. 
Last year, Everytown successfully worked 
to pass secure storage laws in Maine, Colo-
rado, and Oregon, among others, according 
to Watts. 
During this year’s legislative session, 
Watts said the organization will work with 
lawmakers in hopes of passing such laws in 
at least 14 states. States such as California, 
Michigan and New Jersey are working on 
first-of-its kind legislation that requires par-
ents to be notified about secure storage. 
Everytown’s research shows that 21 of the 
country’s states have rejected Stand Your 
Ground laws, which allow individuals to use 
deadly force in public as self-defense even if 
they can safely walk away from the situa-
tion. 
Despite strong gun laws, some states still 
feel the effects of being close to a state with 
more lax regulations. For example, Illinois 
has the sixth-strongest gun safety laws in 
the country, but its neighboring state of In-
diana has much weaker gun laws, Suplina 
says. 
According to Suplina, this could explain 
why such a high number of guns purchased in 
Indiana have ended up in Chicago. Last year, 
the U.S. Department of Justice charged six 
Indianapolis residents related to the straw 
purchasing of firearms. Prosecutors said 
more than 20 of the guns were recovered in 
Chicago after being used in violent crimes, 
including murder. 
Gun violence overall has risen during the 
pandemic. More than two-thirds of the coun-
try’s 40 most populous cities saw more homi-
cides last year than in 2020, and most of 
them were a result of gun violence, accord-
ing to a CNN analysis of police department 
data. For many cities, the elevated rates of 
homicide continued into 2021. 
While experts say the reasons for the rise 
in homicides are varied, murders are increas-
ingly carried out with guns. The increase in 
gun violence was underscored in the FBI’s 
2020 Uniform Crime Report, which stated 
that about 77 percent of reported murders in 
2020 were committed with a gun, up from 74 
percent in 2019. The agency reported that the 
number of homicides increased by nearly 30 
percent from 2019, the largest single-year 
jump the agency has recorded. There is no 
federal database of gun sales, but other inde-
pendent surveys have found that gun sales 
have soared during the Covid–19 pandemic. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from the District of Co-
lumbia (Ms. NORTON). 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of the package of gun 
violence prevention bills we are consid-
ering today. 
Gun violence is at unseen epidemic 
levels in this country. We need to com-
bat the source of the epidemic: easy ac-
cess to guns. 
I will address, however, the impact of 
the lack of statehood for the residents 
of the District of Columbia on their 
ability to pass and maintain their own 
commonsense gun violence prevention 
laws. 
If Republicans take the majority in 
the next Congress, they could elimi-
nate D.C.’s gun violence prevention 
laws, which they have repeatedly tried 
to do, including its ban on assault 
weapons and high-capacity magazines 
and its universal background checks. 
At least seven current Republican 
Members of Congress have introduced 
such bills. I have defeated each effort 
in Congress to overturn D.C. gun vio-
lence prevention laws, and I vow to do 
so again, but the ultimate remedy for 
congressional interference in local D.C. 
matters, of course, is D.C. statehood. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. CASTRO). 
Mr. 
CASTRO 
of 
Texas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise to vote to do something. 
It is too easy for dangerous people to 
get dangerous weapons in this country, 
and we are either going to do some-
thing about it or we are not. 
I want you to imagine for a second 
that a shooter with an AR–15 goes into 
your child’s or grandchild’s school to-
morrow or next fall and leaves a hole 
the size of a basketball in their chest 
or leaves their head decapitated off 
their body. Ask yourself what you 
would ask of the people who represent 
you. Would their thoughts and prayers 
be good enough for you if that hap-
pened to your child? Would they being 
worried about their primary election 
be okay with you? 
The people of Uvalde, when I spoke to 
them, asked me how it is that some-
body who is 18 can’t buy beer or ciga-
rettes, but they can go into a gun store 
and buy two AR–15s and go kill 20 peo-
ple. 
The teachers who died, the cops who 
died, the children who died cannot vote 
to change the law. Only we can do that. 
This is our legacy. Vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to direct their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman 
from 
Florida 
(Ms. 
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ). 
Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to confront the 
Nation’s leading child killer: gun vio-
lence. 
Passing the Protecting Our Kids Act 
does that by raising the legal age to 
buy certain semiautomatic rifles and 
closing the ghost gun loophole. It 
strengthens safe storage rules at home 
and clamps down on bump stocks and 
high-capacity magazines. 
Once more, House Democrats will do 
something meaningful to address this 
carnage while House Republicans do 
nothing. Yes, a few Senate Republicans 
may do the absolute minimum, but 
when an 11-year-old tells Congress that 
she smeared her murdered friend’s 
blood on her own body to play dead and 
stay alive in Uvalde, I will take baby 
steps over no steps.

June 8, 2022 
From Uvalde and Buffalo to Park-
land, Orlando, and Las Vegas, America 
is bleeding. While this legislation will 
not end gun violence, it is a tour-
niquet. 
The deaths, suicides, and astronom-
ical health costs are too high, and we 
cannot continue to forsake our na-
tional freedoms to learn, work, and 
worship without fear. 
Let’s pass this legislation and re-
claim America’s values and confront 
this Nation’s leading killer of children: 
gun violence. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 21⁄2
minutes to the gentleman 
from Virginia (Mr. CLINE). 
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Ohio for yielding. 
I rise in opposition to the so-called 
Protecting Our Kids Act. What we saw 
2 weeks ago in Uvalde, Texas, was trag-
ic and horrific, and we should take ac-
tion to prevent future tragedies such as 
this one, but this bill is not the solu-
tion for several reasons. 
First, the bill restricts the Second 
Amendment 
rights 
of 
law-abiding 
adults. With very limited exceptions, 
the bill would prohibit 18- to 20-year- 
olds from buying nearly all semiauto-
matic rifles and shotguns. 
During the markup of this bill, the 
Judiciary Committee chairman argued 
that this is applicable because these 
young adults don’t have fully formed 
brains. Yet, we entrust these same 
young adults to serve our country in 
the military and die for our country. 
We trust these young adults to vote in 
our elections. 
What is even more interesting is 
while Democrats believe that these 
young adults don’t have fully formed 
brains, they certainly are more than 
willing to try to reduce the age at 
which a person can vote to 16. 
Second, the bill makes it more dif-
ficult for a domestic violence victim to 
keep a firearm for protection. As draft-
ed, the bill would criminalize a domes-
tic violence victim’s attempt to seek 
help from a friend or neighbor in ob-
taining a firearm. 
The safe storage requirements of the 
bill make it harder for people to access 
a firearm in an emergency by man-
dating a one-size-fits-all approach for 
firearm storage. 
Finally, the bill’s limits on magazine 
capacity will essentially ban many 
common firearms, some of which may 
accommodate between 15 and 30 rounds 
of ammunition. 
Overall, this bill is an attempt to re-
strict the constitutional rights of law- 
abiding citizens while ignoring the 
broader problems of why these trage-
dies are happening. 
Let’s talk about school resource offi-
cers in our schools. Let’s talk about 
fortifying school buildings. Let’s talk 
about ending the dangerous mirage of 
gun-free zones. And yes, let’s talk 
about mental health. 
We have to look for commonsense so-
lutions that make it easier for Ameri-
cans to protect themselves and their 
loved ones. I oppose this bill, and I urge 
my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
CHU). 
Ms. CHU. Madam Speaker, we cannot 
let America be like this. 
Children shouldn’t be texting their 
family good-bye as they lay barricaded 
behind desks. Parents shouldn’t dread 
having to drop a child off at school, 
wondering if this is a death sentence. 
And a grandmother shouldn’t have to 
fear being murdered as she goes into a 
grocery store to get dinner. 
The U.S. is the only country in the 
world with more civilian-owned fire-
arms than people, and it is costing us 
our loved ones’ lives. 
Thoughts 
and 
prayers 
are 
not 
enough. They never were. We have to 
take action. This is what we were sent 
to Congress to do, to act. 
The bill before us today, H.R. 7910, 
the Protecting Our Kids Act, will save 
lives. We can no longer act like we are 
powerless to stop mass murders in our 
communities when it is clear there is 
so much we can do. 
Pass this bill. Enough is enough. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Georgia (Mrs. GREENE). 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. In 1990, our 
schools became gun-free school zones, 
and on September 6, 1990, when I was 16 
years old, my high school went on 
lockdown because one of the students 
at my school brought three guns to 
school in a duffel bag on the school 
bus, brought the guns into our school, 
and proceeded to take control of our 
high school. And he was the only per-
son in the school who had guns. That is 
why that happened. 
There was no one to protect us who 
had a gun that day. The only person 
with guns was the very mentally ill, 
upset teenager who had brought guns 
to school that day to kill other stu-
dents. I know that fear. As a matter of 
fact, I think I am the only Member of 
Congress that that has actually hap-
pened to. 
I am also a mom. I have dropped off 
my kids at school for years, wondering 
would this happen at my children’s 
school. Would they face a terrible fate 
like the poor children in Uvalde? This 
should never happen to our children, 
and I can’t help but point out to all of 
us here, while we are debating how to 
protect our kids in school and we are 
debating our Second Amendment gun 
rights, I want to point out that we are 
all so privileged to be in this building 
being protected by armed guards with 
guns who are protecting our lives. 
It is shocking to me that this body of 
Congress won’t do the same thing for 
children in schools all over America 
because we know one thing works. We 
know that a gun is a tool, and it is a 
weapon that can be used to defend 
yourself or defend others. We are all 
lucky enough to have that privilege, 
but our schoolchildren aren’t. 
If we really want to be serious about 
protecting our kids here in America, 
we will repeal the Gun-Free School 
Zones Act, and we will put into action 
real legislation that protects children 
in schools everywhere, all over Amer-
ica, with good guys with guns, the 
same way we are being protected. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the distinguished 
gentleman from Florida (Mr. DEUTCH), 
a member of the Judiciary Committee. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I am 
disappointed in the way that our col-
leagues are so cavalierly avoiding the 
facts. 
These commonsense measures, had 
we passed them before, could have 
saved over 400 people killed in mass 
shootings since Columbine. 
I am disappointed in the cavalier 
mischaracterization of jurisprudence. 
Justice Scalia said that the rights se-
cured by the Second Amendment are 
not unlimited. My colleagues know 
that the changes in this law that we 
are proposing today will not undermine 
the Second Amendment in any way. 
Madam Speaker, I have two docu-
ments that inform everything I do 
here. One is the Constitution of the 
United States, and the other is this list 
that I wrote on February 14, 2018, of 
every one of the 17 members of my 
community slaughtered by a killer 
with an AR–15 in his high school. 
We 
have 
heard 
a 
lot 
about 
foundational rights, foundational lib-
erties, as if the Second Amendment is 
the sum total of the Constitution. 
Madam Speaker, the First Amendment 
matters as well, and for these 17, they 
have no right to practice religion and 
to pray for themselves or all of those 
who are killed every time we offer 
thoughts and prayers. And for these 17 
and everyone killed by gun violence, 
they cannot peaceably assemble as the 
First Amendment gives the right to all 
Americans. And, Madam Speaker, most 
of all, they cannot petition the govern-
ment for redress of their grievances, 
not these 17, not the 19 from Uvalde, no 
one killed by gun violence. 
Today, we can help redress the griev-
ances of all those lost to gun violence 
by passing this important legislation. 
We must, and we will. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman 
from Florida (Mr. RUTHERFORD). 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in opposition to H.R. 7910 
because this bill does nothing to stop 
human violence, which is the real prob-
lem at hand here. 
Straw purchases are already illegal. 
You can’t buy a gun for someone else 
to get around the background check. 
Bump stocks are already regulated like 
automatic weapons, thanks to the 
Trump administration. 
Infringing on the Second Amendment 
rights of law-abiding Americans is not 
the answer. In fact, the bill before us 
will even make criminals out of legal 
gun owners. 
This bill would put the Federal Gov-
ernment in charge of law-abiding citi-
zens and how they store their firearms

inside their own homes. This bill puts 
firearms storage over and above self- 
defense. 
Instead, let’s work together to ad-
dress human violence problems by bol-
stering our mental health system, 
identifying individuals before they be-
come active shooters and mass mur-
derers, and improving our school safety 
through crime prevention through en-
vironmental design, CPTED. It can be 
done. 
b 1645 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
GARAMENDI). 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I 
have heard over and over again we 
ought to harden our schools. We ought 
to let every teacher have a gun. 
One question that needs to be asked 
as that argument goes forward: Why? 
Why do we need to do that? 
We need to do that because an 18- 
year-old was able to buy two AR–15s, 
go to the school in Uvalde, and shoot 
up all of the students and teachers—19. 
That is presumably why we have to 
harden our schools. 
Maybe it is time for us to come to 
the reality that it is time for us to pass 
commonsense gun safety legislation. 
This particular piece of legislation 
does just that. It doesn’t take away the 
Second Amendment rights. 
What it does is to provide every 
American with the right to life, lib-
erty, and the pursuit of happiness, and 
not having to worry about whether 
their school has been hardened suffi-
ciently to prevent an 18-year-old with 
two military-style weapons to enter 
that school. It is time for us to act. 
Pass this legislation. 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, it is 
time to act. 
On January 19, 1989, my wife Patti and I 
entered the ICU at San Joaquin General Hos-
pital. We were there to see a five-year-old boy 
and his parents, who recently fled from war- 
torn Laos. The boy was fighting for his life. A 
day earlier, a gunman, armed with an AK 47c, 
walked onto the playground at Cleveland Park 
Elementary School in Stockton California and 
started shooting, killing five children and injur-
ing thirty-two. ‘‘We came here to escape war,’’ 
the boy’s parents pleaded. ‘‘How could this 
happen in America?’’ 
I represented Stockton in the California Sen-
ate in 1989 during the Cleveland Park Ele-
mentary shooting. After hearing from first re-
sponders and victims, I introduced legislation 
that would become California’s assault weap-
ons ban—the first of its kind in the nation. 
Senator Dianne Feinstein bravely took up the 
case in Washington, and in 1994 Congress 
passed and President Clinton signed the fed-
eral assault weapons ban into law. Unfortu-
nately, the federal ban expired in 2004 when 
the Republican-led Congress refused to ex-
tend the ban. 
Tragically, mass shootings have been on 
the rise ever since Congress let the assault 
weapons ban expire. Last month in Texas, 
days after his 18th birthday, a man purchased 
two AR–15-style assault rifles and 375 rounds 
of 5.56-caliber ammunition. Days later, on May 
24, 2022, he entered Robb Elementary School 
in Uvalde, Texas, and murdered 19 fourth- 
grade children and two teachers. America was 
left heartbroken and appalled by the horrific 
mass shooting and is asking how a youth who 
could not buy a beer was able to buy and pos-
sess more weapons of war than a trained Ma-
rine would carry into a deadly conflict. 
Unfortunately, 
the 
horror 
witnessed 
in 
Uvalde is not an isolated incident in today’s 
America. There have been over 20 mass 
shootings in America since the tragedy at 
Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texas. Mothers, 
fathers, children, and grandparents have all 
had their lives cut short and left behind friends 
and family to mourn their loss. America is ex-
periencing a gun violence epidemic, and we 
are foolish to think anything will change with-
out immediate action locally and nationally. It 
is estimated that over 20 million AR–15-style 
assault rifles are in the homes and streets of 
America. There have already been 233 mass 
shootings in America since January 2022. We 
have to act to change this. 
During the 10 years America had a federal 
assault weapons ban, gun homicide rates de-
clined 49% nationally. Sadly, mass shootings 
and gun homicides have become more fre-
quent and deadly since the ban expired. There 
have been more mass shootings in the last 
two years than in the 10 years under the fed-
eral assault weapons ban. 
It’s time for Congress to reinstate the fed-
eral assault weapons ban. H.R. 1808, the As-
sault Weapons Ban Act, would do just that 
and institute a buy-back program to remove 
many of these deadly weapons from our com-
munities. Congress also must also institute a 
universal background check system with a 
waiting period, establish a national Red Flag 
law, ban ghost guns, limit magazine sizes, 
allow civil lawsuits against gun manufacturers, 
and institute a stiff tax on all gun sales and 
assault weapons ammunition. This tax should 
be used to compensate gun violence victims 
and increase investments in gun violence re-
search. 
The Democratic House of Representatives, 
with no support from Republicans, has already 
voted twice this session to pass gun safety 
legislation. This month, House Democrats will 
take further action by voting for legislation to 
protect our communities from gun-wielding 
men and women bent on murder and violence. 
The tragic fact is that the Senate Republicans, 
like their House colleagues, have refused to 
vote for even the most minimal gun safety leg-
islation and are using the filibuster to block 
commonsense reforms that will save lives. 
The gun violence epidemic cannot be toler-
ated. It cannot be normalized. We must not re- 
elect lawmakers and candidates who would 
rather protect the NRA and their gun-ob-
sessed donors than innocent children and 
teachers. These shooters are cowards going 
after the most vulnerable. 
As I write this, the memory of that family 
gathered around that hospital bed at San Joa-
quin General Hospital haunts me as I envision 
hundreds of families gathered around hospital 
beds and coffins weeping and asking, ‘‘How 
could this happen in America?’’ It happens be-
cause our courts and too many politicians 
have chosen to protect gun manufacturers, 
gun sellers, and gun owners rather than chil-
dren, teachers, worshipers, and shoppers. In 
the fall mid-term elections, America must elect 
candidates who will vote for gun control. 
We must be as brave as those children and 
teachers in that classroom last month. We 
must stand up to the NRA and its supporters. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. 
CAROLYN B. MALONEY). 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I rise in support 
of the Protecting Our Kids Act. 
Today, the victims’ families and 
community members from the mass 
shootings in Buffalo and Uvalde ap-
peared before the Oversight Committee 
demanding action. These communities 
have faced unspeakable tragedy. 
It is our duty as lawmakers to listen 
to them and work to build a world 
where they will never have to see these 
horrific events repeated. This legisla-
tion will save countless lives from the 
violence these families have had to en-
dure. 
We must support every title in this 
bill, especially title II, cracking down 
on interstate gun trafficking. I have 
spent over a decade fighting for gun 
trafficking and straw purchases to be 
made a Federal offense. The illegal 
interstate movement of firearms into 
New York, known as the ‘‘Iron Pipe-
line’’ has caused countless firearms to 
enter our State unlawfully. Preventing 
gun 
trafficking 
across 
State 
lines 
should be a bipartisan goal. 
As a mother and teacher, I am horri-
fied by these attacks on our schools, 
grocery stores, and our communities. I 
urge my colleagues to support this bill. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Florida (Mrs. CAMMACK). 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
came here today to speak on behalf of 
women and the parents of my district— 
heck, honestly, I came to speak on be-
half of all Americans who want their 
kids to be safe and secure in their 
schools, and for people to be safe in 
their communities. 
I came here today to say that we all 
want these things because our hearts 
collectively break when any life is lost. 
We mourn for those lives lost need-
lessly. 
We need to do better, and we can do 
better, which is why every single Mem-
ber of this Chamber must, without hes-
itation, denounce, decline, decide, and 
oppose against H.R. 7910, the politics 
over our kids act. 
This is common sense. Taking legal 
firearms out of the hands of law-abid-
ing citizens does nothing but empower 
criminals. 
It is already illegal to commit mur-
der. Has that stopped murder? Has that 
stopped violence? No. 
Madam Speaker, you said in your 
opening 
remarks: 
‘‘Protecting 
our 
kids—what could be more important 
than that?’’ You said: ‘‘We are here for 
the children.’’ You went on to say: 
‘‘Everything we do is for the children,’’ 
and that today’s effort to strip our con-
stitutional rights is a ‘‘crusade for the 
children.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5384 
June 8, 2022 
You must have forgotten the nearly 
60 million children that have been mur-
dered through some of the most hor-
rific means during an abortion. All on 
your watch. 
You invoke JFK, and say: ‘‘Our chil-
dren are our best resource and our best 
hope for the future.’’ 
Is that so? 
Why do you deny them their future 
by killing them in the womb? It sounds 
a bit hypocritical, if you ask me. 
You also made the statement that 
the leading cause of death for children 
is firearms. Then why does the data re-
fute that? ‘‘NBC News’’ reported that 
motor vehicle deaths of kids from age 1 
to 17 continues to be the number one 
cause of death. 
Spare me, Madam Speaker, that you 
are here fighting for the children be-
cause your three decades in Congress 
reflect a record of anything but a fight 
for children. 
Certainly not the kids being traf-
ficked at the border. Not the kids being 
abused. Not the kids fighting for their 
life in the womb, or the kids whose fu-
ture is being stolen by abusive Big 
Government policies. 
If this were about protecting kids, 
then why does this bill do nothing to 
secure or harden our schools? Why 
were there no bipartisan efforts as part 
of this package? Why do these bills do 
nothing to address the mental health 
crisis that we are facing that is driving 
the violence? It is not the guns; it is 
the people. 
People who are intent on committing 
acts of evil and violence will do so by 
any means necessary. That is a fact. 
While you have conveniently forgot-
ten so much, I certainly do not want to 
forget how many victims of domestic 
violence will be left without options to 
protect themselves if this garbage bill 
becomes law. 
The same party screaming to defund 
our police is the same party screaming 
about how you—a law-abiding citizen— 
should not be able to defend yourself. 
Finally, I would be remiss if I didn’t 
mention that you have clearly all for-
gotten your oath. An oath that we took 
here on this Chamber floor to uphold 
and defend the United States Constitu-
tion, and the Second Amendment is 
part of that. 
Madam Speaker, and to all my col-
leagues, the Constitution is not a la 
carte, you can either accept it all or 
none of it, but you cannot cherry-pick. 
If you cannot uphold your oath, then 
you should resign. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All 
Members are reminded, once again, to 
address their remarks to the Chair. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from New Jersey (Ms. SHERRILL). 
Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Speaker, 
like so many parents across the Na-
tion, when I sent my four kids off to 
school this past week, I worried that 
they wouldn’t be coming home, like so 
many children across the country. 
I got a bit hopeful when I heard that 
my colleagues are speaking for women 
across the country, and I expected to 
hear then that they were going to talk 
about passing universal background 
checks because we know that 88 per-
cent of the country wants to see uni-
versal background checks passed. I am 
sorry, I must have missed that in their 
conversation. 
When I heard how devastated my col-
leagues are for the little children that 
have been dying, like I am, I thought, 
well, great, maybe we will hear some-
thing about passing a law that restricts 
people 21 and under from purchasing 
guns, like MITCH MCCONNELL said he is 
willing to consider. I must have missed 
that, too. 
I have to tell you, we know these gun 
safety legislation pieces work because 
in New Jersey, we have passed most of 
them, 
and 
we 
have 
made 
major 
progress. In fact, while the rest of the 
country has seen gun rate deaths in-
crease by 33 percent, in New Jersey 
they fell by 10 percent. 
Again, I am hoping, as we speak for 
mothers and women and children and 
families across New Jersey, we start to 
hear about how we are going to pass 
this great legislation. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. BISHOP). 
Mr. 
BISHOP 
of 
North 
Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, it is repeated over and 
over again that the Second Amend-
ment is not unlimited, it has limits. No 
one contends otherwise. 
What are the limits? Wouldn’t it be 
nice to hear that in the debate? 
The limits as set forth in Heller and 
McDonald is that it is improper, and 
you cannot ban weapons that are ‘‘in 
common use at the time.’’ You cannot 
require that firearms in the home be 
‘‘rendered and kept inoperable.’’ 
The Ninth and Fourth Circuits have 
said that, like other constitutional 
rights, all of them, the Second Amend-
ment protections apply to 18- to 20- 
year-olds. The dissenting judge in that 
opinion in the Fourth Circuit acknowl-
edged that there is ‘‘persuasive evi-
dence of that.’’ 
This bill bans for 18- to 20-year-old 
adults guns that are in common use. It 
bans for everyone ammo magazines 
that are in pervasive use. It requires 
that weapons be disabled in the home. 
This one doesn’t violate the Constitu-
tion, I admit, but it even criminalizes a 
neighbor who buys a gun for self-pro-
tection for a victim of domestic vio-
lence. 
The Democrats say more is coming. 
They use the terminology ‘‘weapon of 
war.’’ They intend to ban this class of 
weapons entirely. You have made it 
clear in the House Judiciary Com-
mittee. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE: Madam Speaker, 
will the gentleman yield? 
Mr. 
BISHOP 
of 
North 
Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I will not yield. She 
has had a lot of time. 
Madam Speaker, you made it clear 
that you will proceed regardless of 
what the Second Amendment says. Mr. 
JONES made it clearer than anyone. If 
the filibuster obstructs us, we will 
abolish it. If the Supreme Court ob-
jects, we will expand it. 
Do something, is the mantra. It is 
probably worth remembering that that 
is short for the commonly heard 
phrase, ‘‘do something, even if it is 
wrong.’’ The last thing we need is 
something that is wrong. What is need-
ed is an answer. You are not pursuing 
an answer because, frankly, you are 
not grappling with the problem. 
Could we begin with candor? Are 
these disasters enough to prompt can-
dor? Could we have some truth? You 
have been doing gun control since 1968. 
Has it worked to your satisfaction? 
The gentlewoman from Pennsylvania 
said earlier: The country is sick. She 
has misdiagnosed the problem. 
They say it is the guns. Madam 
Speaker, guns have been prevalent in 
the United States of America since be-
fore our founding. We did not suffer the 
mass shootings. We did not suffer the 
chaos in the cities like she described. 
Why do we have this now? 
Chesterton, 
a 
British 
gentleman, 
came closest, he said: ‘‘The disintegra-
tion of rational society started in the 
drift from the hearth and the family; 
the solution must be a drift back.’’ Ev-
erybody knows it is true. 
If there is a sickness in the country, 
it is the product of 60 years of disinte-
gration of American culture by the lib-
eral project: Assaults on the family; 
hostility to God; cheapening life; per-
vasive expansion of the welfare state; 
ridicule for individual and parental re-
sponsibility; Soros DAs ending punish-
ment 
for 
crime; 
delegitimizing, 
defunding, and abolishing police. 
Behold your handiwork. Stripping 
Americans 
of 
constitutional 
rights 
won’t cure what ails us. Not the Second 
Amendment, not the First Amendment 
to which you are hostile, not the 
Fourth Amendment, not the Fifth 
Amendment. Join us to solve the prob-
lems you have caused. We can find an-
swers together. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair will, once again, admonish Mem-
bers to direct their remarks to the 
Chair. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
New 
York 
(Mr. 
ESPAILLAT). 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in strong support of the Protecting 
Our Kids Act. This overdue legislation 
will tighten gun regulations. 
Unfortunately, 
in 
the 
world’s 
wealthiest country, we have the 32nd 
highest rate of death from gun violence 
across the planet. This is a horrific sta-
tistic that is impacting all of our dis-
tricts—blue districts and red districts. 
In my district, gun violence has 
taken far too many lives, including the 
young 
life 
and 
brutal 
murder 
of 
Krystal Bayron-Nieves, working the 
midnight shift in an East Harlem Burg-
er King. The brutal murder of two po-
lice officers in Harlem’s 32nd Precinct.

June 8, 2022 
An 11-month-old gunshot victim in the 
Bronx. Yes, Madam Speaker, only 11 
months old. 
Madam Speaker, I am here to tell my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
that this epidemic is serious. In fact, it 
is a public health crisis. For this rea-
son, Congresswoman ESCOBAR
and I 
urge our colleagues to join us in a reso-
lution declaring gun violence a na-
tional public health crisis. 
This is just the beginning, Madam 
Speaker. We will continue to pass more 
gun regulations. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
b 1700 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, may I 
inquire how much time each side has 
remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New York has 131⁄4 min-
utes remaining. The gentleman from 
Ohio has 10 minutes remaining. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. 
CLARK). 
Ms. 
CLARK 
of 
Massachusetts. 
Madam Speaker, today in our country 
321 people will be shot, and 111 of them 
will die from those gunshots. Twenty- 
two of the people who are shot every 
day in this country are kids, just like 
the 19 fourth graders sitting in their 
classroom while they were massacred 
in Uvalde. 
So I ask my colleagues: How many 
more? 
How many more innocent people need 
to die? 
How many more elders will be mur-
dered at a grocery store or in their 
houses of worship? 
How many more children, slaugh-
tered 
in 
their 
classroom, 
will 
be 
enough to do something to save lives? 
We are considering the most basic 
measures to keep people safe from gun 
violence and to keep families from hav-
ing to I.D. their children by DNA after 
their bodies were destroyed by a weap-
on of war. 
Raising the age to 21 to buy assault 
rifles, safe gun storage, and cracking 
down on gun trafficking are obvious so-
lutions. Vote ‘‘yes’’ to protect families. 
Vote ‘‘yes’’ to save our children. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman from Oregon (Mr. BLU-
MENAUER). 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, 
it has been heart-wrenching hearing 
the stories on the floor today. 
America is not unique with gun vio-
lence. What is unique is that America 
has accepted the slaughter. Unlike 
Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zea-
land, and Norway, after horrific events 
they acted decisively to reduce gun vi-
olence, and it worked. 
We have stood by while the carnage 
continues 
to 
our 
shame. 
America 
should not be the only rich country 
that cannot protect our children. 
After events in Oregon, I met with 
victims of gun violence, and they de-
veloped a package that looks a lot like 
what we are voting on today. 
It is no longer acceptable for gun vio-
lence enablers to hide behind thoughts 
and prayers. If other countries can pro-
tect their families, then so can we. 
Madam Speaker, pass this package. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
Nevada 
(Mr. 
HORSFORD). 
Mr. HORSFORD. Madam Speaker, 
later this month, 30 years to the day, 
my father was shot and killed by sense-
less gun violence. 
And so I rise today with a heavy 
heart for those who have been mur-
dered by gun violence and the survivors 
who now must live with that trauma 
every single day. 
I have a heavy heart for the 58 vic-
tims and survivors in my hometown of 
Las Vegas who experienced the worst 
mass shooting in U.S. history. 
I have a heavy heart for the parents 
and families in Uvalde, Texas, whose 
children 
were 
murdered 
while 
at 
school. 
I have a heavy heart for the Black 
Americans who were murdered at a 
grocery store in Buffalo, New York. 
I have a heavy heart for the doctors 
and nurses who were killed at a hos-
pital in Tulsa. 
I have a heavy heart. But I also have 
the courage to protect our children, 
and I will continue to work to break 
the cycle of violence. 
The question is: Do my colleagues 
have the courage to protect our kids? 
Vote ‘‘yes’’ on this legislation. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 31⁄2
minutes to the gentleman 
from Florida (Mr. STEUBE). 
Mr. STEUBE. Madam Speaker, guns 
are not the cause of evil, just like the 
vehicle used by the domestic terrorist 
in Waukesha, Wisconsin, to mow down 
innocent people in a parade killing six 
was not the cause of that evil. The per-
son driving it was. 
Why aren’t the pictures of the vic-
tims of that heinous act being shown 
by the Democrats on the floor today, 
like those victims in Uvalde? 
Where was the left’s cry to ban vehi-
cles that killed those innocent lives in 
Waukesha? 
There are no cries to ban cars be-
cause that is not on the left’s agenda. 
Banning guns is. And Democrats use 
these heinous crimes to further the 
long sought-after political objective of 
disarming America, and many Demo-
crats in this Chamber have called for 
outright bans on certain firearms. 
There is a moral decay in our coun-
try that has been created by the left. 
They have torn down traditional insti-
tutions, taken God out of our class-
rooms, and systematically destroyed 
the notion of traditional families and 
values. 
Just look at these numbers in a re-
cent article from The Christian Post: 
Seventy-five percent of most cited 
school shooters in America are father-
less; 60 percent of America’s rapists 
grew up without fathers; 63 percent of 
teenagers who commit suicide don’t 
have a father in their life; 72 percent of 
adolescent murderers are fatherless. 
The same was true for the murderer at 
Robb Elementary. And I could go on. 
Why isn’t the majority talking about 
that? 
Why isn’t the majority talking about 
solutions to have role models in chil-
dren’s lives? 
Because that doesn’t accomplish a 
policy objective for them. 
This bill, nor any bill before us this 
week, will stop mass shootings. This 
bill won’t even decrease gun violence, 
and the facts and evidence from the ju-
risdictions with similar policies make 
that clear. Just look at any holiday 
weekend in Chicago and see how many 
people have been shot with many of 
these policies already in place. 
This bill is simply a step further to 
restrict the ability of law-abiding citi-
zens to own firearms and defend them-
selves while doing nothing to address 
the cultural rot that leads to these 
acts. 
This bill seeks to take the Second 
Amendment rights away from 18- to 20- 
year-olds by taking away their ability 
to purchase a firearm. 
Comparing Census data on the total 
18- to 20-year-old population with De-
partment of Justice data on violent 
crimes committed by that age group— 
and this includes violent crimes not in-
volving guns—only 0.3 percent of 18- to 
20-year-olds commit violent crimes in a 
year. 
Madam Speaker, when you look at 
murder, 
including 
murder 
without 
guns, only 0.013 percent of 18- to 20- 
year-olds commit murder in a year. So 
today Democrats are going to take 
away the lawful right for 99.7 percent 
of adult Americans between the ages of 
18 and 20 for the acts of a few wicked 
people. 
Now, 
think 
about 
that, 
Madam 
Speaker. So the daughter off to college 
and living by herself can’t buy a shot-
gun to keep in her home to protect her-
self against a rapist all because of 0.3 
percent of that age group has com-
mitted a violent crime. 
The magazine limits in the bill are 
even more egregious because it affects 
all Americans and all firearms, not just 
rifles, and will effectively serve as a 
ban on most commonly used handguns. 
As I demonstrated in the Judiciary 
Committee last week, numerous fire-
arms that millions of Americans use 
every single day to protect themselves 
and their families could be rendered 
useless by a 15-round magazine limit. 
And those 15-round magazine limits 
have absolutely no effect on solving 
mass shootings. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to stand for freedom, to stand 
for the Constitution, and to stand for 
the right of law-abiding citizens to de-
fend themselves.

H5386 
June 8, 2022 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
LEE). 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise in strong support of 
H.R. 7910, the Protecting Our Kids Act. 
I thank Chairman NADLER for bringing 
these bills to the floor. 
Gun violence is responsible for more 
than 32,000 deaths each year. This is a 
heartbreaking moment for so many of 
us. This is a public health crisis in our 
country. It is an epidemic. 
The 
victims 
of 
Buffalo, 
Uvalde, 
Tulsa, and other mass shootings de-
serve more than our thoughts and 
prayers. 
Last week, I met with young, gun vi-
olence survivors in my district. They 
spoke powerfully about the cycle of vi-
olence and the easy access to guns, es-
pecially ghost guns. They talked about 
the trauma they endured by them-
selves, their families, and their com-
munities. This is nothing new. This has 
been going on for so many years, and 
they are asking us to take action to 
save lives. 
This bill responds to their call by 
raising the age for purchase of certain 
firearms. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield the gentlewoman an additional 15 
seconds. 
Ms. LEE of California. All I am say-
ing is, all of our children who have died 
through gun violence had a right to 
live, and they had a right to life. 
So I urge all of my colleagues to vote 
‘‘yes’’ and to take action so that we 
can save countless lives. Let’s protect 
our kids. I thank the chairman again 
for yielding. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. ALLRED). 
Mr. ALLRED. Madam Speaker, after 
the mass shooting in El Paso in 2019, I 
received a letter from then 6-year-old 
Cal from Rowlett, Texas. 
He wrote: 
When kids get shot, that is less friends to 
play with. When I grow up I don’t want to 
hear any more on the news about people 
being killed with guns. 
He was 6, and he had to write that to 
his Congressman. Today, just 3 years 
later, he is the same age as some of the 
kids murdered in Uvalde. 
I refuse to accept that there is noth-
ing that we can do, and I refuse to say 
there is nothing we can do to protect 
kids like Cal or my sons in their 
schools. 
We have to act by passing common-
sense measures, like raising the age to 
21 to buy an assault-style weapon, ban-
ning high-capacity magazines, and in-
creasing safe storage. That will save 
lives. This legislation, the Protecting 
Our Kids Act, will save lives. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ to help us save 
lives and for the Senate to finally act 
and to join us in trying to end this cri-
sis. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from New York (Ms. 
VELA´ ZQUEZ). 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, 
we are here today because for the vic-
tims of Uvalde, it is too late; for the 
victims of Parkland, it is too late; for 
the victims of Sandy Hook, it is too 
late; and for the victims of Columbine, 
it is too late. 
Constituents from my district are 
still reeling from recent gun violence 
incidents. We all saw the images of 
people running desperately away from 
the shooter at the subway station in 
Sunset Park. I am tired of watching 
again and again my constituents suffer 
from horrific acts of gun violence. 
This legislation is a necessary step to 
prevent gun violence from happening in 
our schools, places of worship, grocery 
stores, malls, and public transpor-
tation. Moreover, it imposes stronger 
regulations on those who can buy these 
weapons of war. 
Congress cannot be too late anymore. 
Enough is enough. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. 
DELBENE). 
Ms. DELBENE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the Protecting Our 
Kids Act. I am a parent of two great 
kids. When they were young, my hus-
band or I would drop them off at 
school, and we were confident that 
they were in a safe space. But for so 
many parents, that is no longer the 
case. 
I recently hosted a roundtable with 
some of the over 1,000 constituents who 
have written or called into my office 
following the tragedies in Uvalde and 
Buffalo and the over 240 mass shootings 
in 2022. 
It is heartbreaking to hear how par-
ents have to explain to their kids what 
to do if there is an active shooter, as if 
it is inevitable. 
We know what we can do to help pre-
vent future tragedies like Uvalde. We 
can pass commonsense gun safety poli-
cies like this legislation. Enough is 
enough. We have to end the senseless 
deaths of our children and our neigh-
bors. Vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Kentucky (Mr. MASSIE). 
Mr. MASSIE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Ohio for 
yielding. 
The Democrats today say they don’t 
want to take your guns away. Well, 
then why does the legislation do just 
that? 
What they should say today is: We 
don’t want to take all of the guns away 
from all of the people just yet because 
we know we can’t get away with that. 
The 
reality 
is 
the 
anti-Second 
Amendment lobby has vastly outspent 
all 
of 
the 
pro-Second 
Amendment 
groups put together in the last several 
elections. 
Who is in the pocket of whom? 
So the red flag laws take all of the 
guns from some of the people, and the 
bill that will pass tonight, if the Demo-
crats are fortunate enough to do so, 
will take some of the guns from all of 
the people. 
Now, why are the gun owners who 
don’t own so-called high-capacity mag-
azines, for instance, concerned? 
Why are the gun owners who don’t 
own, for instance, AR–15-style weapons 
concerned about this legislation? 
Because they know the legislation 
won’t work, and the response to this 
unserious and unconstitutional legisla-
tion that will allow the school shoot-
ings to continue will be more gun con-
trol from the Democrats. 
Let me give you an example, Madam 
Speaker. They have a high-capacity 
magazine ban in here that bans any 
magazine that can accept over 15 
rounds. 
Well, guess what? 
At Virginia Tech, the shooter carried 
17 magazines none of which held more 
than 15 rounds and most of which held 
10 rounds. The shooter at Columbine 
carried 13 magazines, each of which 
held 10 rounds. This legislation would 
have done absolutely nothing. 
It is not about how many rounds a 
magazine holds. It is about the evil in-
tent of the shooter and is there some-
body there with the capacity to stop 
that shooter before they can get going. 
b 1715 
Why is this legislation dead on ar-
rival in the Senate? 
Why is it dead on arrival in the Su-
preme Court? 
One of my colleagues has already ac-
knowledged they know this is uncon-
stitutional, and they will pack the 
Court if they have to. They said it in 
the Judiciary Committee, to keep this 
legislation alive after it should long 
since die. 
But why is it dead? Because Ameri-
cans don’t support it. 
You have quoted statistics. Those 
statistics are fake. If they were true, 
this would breeze through the Senate. 
But they are not. 
And so I urge my colleagues to re-
spect the Constitution; respect the will 
of the American people; to respect the 
safety of American citizens and, most 
of all, the safety of children. Let’s do 
something to protect them instead of 
these fake virtue signals that will do 
nothing but to curtail the Second 
Amendment rights of Americans. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman from Illinois (Mr. DANNY K. 
DAVIS). 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 7910, Protecting Our Kids 
Act.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5387 
June 8, 2022 
You know, I am so tired of hearing 
about Chicago and other big cities. 
Local governments do what they can, 
do what they will. But this is not a 
local issue. This is a national issue. It 
is a national problem and it requires a 
national solution. 
And so I urge all of my colleagues, no 
matter where you are from, make sure 
that you vote to protect our kids. And 
the only way to do that is get rid of 
these assault weapons and seriously re-
duce the number of guns in our society. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. DIN-
GELL). 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, as a 
child, I lived with a man, my father, 
who should not have had access to a 
gun. When his temper flared, we would 
hide in the closet, my brothers and sis-
ters, praying we would see the morn-
ing. My baby sister never recovered 
from those fears and ultimately died by 
suicide, haunted by the memories. 
Too many children are living with 
those fears today, in classrooms, and in 
their homes. We cannot afford to look 
away, once again, and do nothing. 
Twenty-eight years ago, when the as-
sault weapons ban was debated, my 
husband, then an NRA board member, 
and who, by the way, slept with a gun 
under his pillow until the day he died, 
made one of the toughest votes of his 
career. He supported the bill, though 
he didn’t agree with everything in it. 
We all have a job to do for our coun-
try. I don’t want to take the guns away 
from any responsible gun owner. But 
the clock is ticking. 
Who will be the next mass shooting? 
Who is the next target? 
What do we want our American story 
to be? 
We need to act now. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. TITUS). 
Ms. TITUS. Madam Speaker, I had 
intended to stand up here and speak 
about my provision preventing bump 
stocks being added to guns but, after 
sitting here and listening for several 
hours, my colleagues across the aisle, 
they have been misrepresenting the 
Second Amendment. They have been 
pretending to care about children, and 
they have been blubbering about their 
need for big guns to protect them-
selves. 
I have just got to say one thing. 
America is listening, and it will re-
member who allowed this plague to 
continue to kill our loved ones and 
spread disaster around our country. 
They are listening, and they will re-
member who it was. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. I am pre-
pared to close. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman 
from Florida (Mr. GAETZ). 
Mr. GAETZ. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Well, we have heard the plan from 
Democrats. This is not a modest, trim-
ming around the edges of gun laws. It 
has been a full-throated assault on the 
Second Amendment; a desire to deprive 
people of the weapons that they choose 
at the age that they achieve majority. 
And we have heard countless exam-
ples of where the good guy with the 
gun has been the difference between 
more or less bloodshed. 
But this is particularly an aggrieved 
time to bring this legislation forward 
because we heard the Speaker of the 
House recently say that members of 
the Republican Party were members of 
a cult. So you now have House Demo-
crats demeaning, defaming, calling ex-
tremists, tens of millions of Ameri-
cans, while they try to disarm you and 
then subsequently defund the police. 
And so no good guys are coming when 
the woke mob ends up at your door. 
That is their plan for America. 
And gun control, unrestrained gun 
control is a key part of it. And just 
like they said, they will pack the 
Court; they will blow up the filibuster; 
they will abuse every mores of this 
place for the opportunity to take down 
the Second Amendment. That is what 
is at issue. That is what we are fight-
ing for. 
And Republicans in the United States 
Senate should not sign up for this cha-
rade. They should stand with our fel-
low Americans for the Constitution 
and with American gun owners. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I could not sit idly by to hear the abuse 
of the Second Amendment that Judge 
Scalia would not recognize; and that is, 
that there are no restrictions. 
I believe Judge Scalia would look at 
these dead babies and realize that the 
Constitution and the Second Amend-
ment that is protected, untouched, 
would ask you the question, is there no 
sense of responsibility to be able to 
provide restrictions to save lives? 
How dare you suggest that we cannot 
provide the kind of laws in Protecting 
Our Kids Act that provides the incen-
tives and guidelines to save lives? 
Ask the mothers and fathers of these 
babies. The Second Amendment is not 
absolute. It does allow restrictions; 
just as President Reagan said: He sees 
no reason for an AK–47, at that time, to 
be used for sport or to be used for any-
thing else. 
Support our babies and vote for this 
act. Where is your responsibility and 
courage? 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Representative MASSIE was right on 
target when he said red flag laws take 
all guns from some people and they do 
so without due process. This bill takes 
some guns from all people. But Demo-
crats say, don’t worry. We are not out 
to get the Second Amendment. Really? 
Here 
is 
what 
Representative 
CICILLINE said in committee last week: 
Spare me the B.S. about constitutional 
rights. 
Here is what Representative JONES 
said last week in committee: If the fili-
buster obstructs us, we will abolish it. 
If the Supreme Court objects, we will 
expand. We will not rest until we have 
taken weapons out of circulation in our 
communities. Each and every day, we 
will do whatever it takes; whatever it 
takes. 
They are out to get the Second 
Amendment. 
The right of the American people, the 
right of we, the people, to keep and 
bear arms, shall not be infringed. That 
is what bothers them. They don’t trust 
we, the people. They are smarter than 
us. They are better than us. They don’t 
trust law-abiding American citizens. 
They do not trust them. 
And that is what is so wrong with the 
direction we are going with this legis-
lation and the legislation they are 
going to bring to the floor tomorrow. 
We have seen they don’t trust Ameri-
cans to exercise their First Amend-
ment liberties. Now they are going 
after their Second Amendment lib-
erties. And that red flag law they are 
going to bring up tomorrow goes after 
the Fifth Amendment due process 
rights that we enjoy as American citi-
zens. That is why we should oppose this 
legislation and the legislation tomor-
row. 
And I hope, as my friend from Flor-
ida said, I hope the United States Sen-
ate doesn’t go down this red flag trail 
that they are now on and further take 
away liberties from law-abiding Amer-
ican people. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Too many cities in this country have 
become a shorthand for mass shooting: 
Newtown, San Bernardino, Charleston, 
Las Vegas, Parkland, Santa Fe, El 
Paso, Buffalo, Uvalde. The list goes on. 
How many more communities must 
be visited by tragedy before we take 
action? 
How many more parents need to bury 
their own children because an 18-year 
old with an AR–15 assault rifle stormed 
into their school? 
How many more children must grow 
up without a parent because a high-ca-
pacity magazine allowed a shooter to 
spray dozens of bullets through a su-
permarket? 
Let today be the day that we begin to 
end this cycle of gun violence and we 
take meaningful action to protect our 
communities and, most of all, to pro-
tect our kids. 
You know, the Republicans tell us 
that we want to defund the police. We

don’t want to defund the police. Presi-
dent Biden just said the other day we 
want to fund the police. 
They want to defund the police. They 
want to disarm the police. What chance 
does a policeman, with a regular serv-
ice revolver, have against someone 
with an AR–15 assault rifle? None at 
all. 
They want to make sure that our po-
lice have no chance at all to resist the 
dishonest people who use weapons of 
war because weapons of war overwhelm 
whatever any policeman may have. 
That is the problem here. 
The problem here is that they want 
to defund—or I shouldn’t say defund. 
They want to disarm our police, com-
pared to the crooks and the murderers 
who have the weapons of war which can 
outweigh the service revolvers that 
any police officer will have. 
So we want to protect the police offi-
cers. 
We 
want 
them 
to 
not 
be 
outgunned by the murderers. That is 
where we are. That is what this bill 
does. That is perhaps why they are 
afraid of this bill. 
But we must pass this bill to save our 
police officers, to save our commu-
nities, to save our children. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Madam Speaker, 
we have a gun epidemic which is unique to 
America. 
As a mother and grandmother, like the rest 
of the nation, I am heartbroken by the horri-
fying killings of innocent Americans, especially 
our children. 
In 2021, homicides hit a 15 year high in Los 
Angeles. And this year, according to the Los 
Angeles Police Department, people are being 
killed at a faster pace than last year. 
According to the Centers for Disease Con-
trol (CDC), in 2020, 45,222 people died from 
gun-related injuries. Of these, 19,384, died 
violently. 
These are not just numbers. They represent 
individuals whose lives were cut short as a re-
sult of gun violence. They were moms, dads, 
sons, and daughters. They belonged to a fam-
ily, they were loved, and will forever be 
missed. 
They should be here today. 
Mass shootings must not be an acceptable 
norm. 
Changing our culture of gun violence will not 
happen overnight. We must start the process 
now. There is no excuse for failing to try. 
I urge my Republican colleagues to put par-
tisan politics and special interests aside and 
join us in support of this commonsense legis-
lation to help keep our children and fellow 
Americans safe. 
Our thoughts and prayers are not enough if 
we fail to act and continue to ignore the gun 
violence which forever shatters the hearts of 
families across our nation. 
Martin Luther King Jr., reminded us that 
‘‘the arc of the moral universe is long, but it 
bends toward justice.’’ 
To my Republican colleagues, you do not 
need more time. Americans need you to bend 
towards justice now and help us to prevent 
another Uvalde, another Buffalo, Tulsa, El 
Paso, Parkland, Sandy Hook, and Columbine. 
Enough is enough. 
We must pass this legislation and the Sen-
ate must get it to the President’s desk, without 
delay. 
I urge my colleagues to make our children’s 
lives a priority and support this commonsense

REQUEST TO CONSIDER S. 4160, SU-
PREME COURT POLICE PARITY 
ACT 
(Mr. MCCARTHY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, earlier 
today, a man was arrested for plotting 
to kill Justice Kavanaugh. 
Over a month ago, the Senate unani-
mously passed a bill to provide more 
security for Supreme Court Justices 
and their families, but House Demo-
crats have let that bill gather dust. 
This is the same party whose heated 
rhetoric has encouraged political pres-
sure on conservative Justices. 
Former White House Press Secretary 
Jen Psaki said: 
I know that there is an outrage right now, 
I guess, about protests that have been peace-
ful to date, and we certainly do continue to 
encourage that, outside judges’ homes, and 
that is the President’s position. 
And Majority Leader SCHUMER said: 
I want to tell you, Justice Kavanaugh and 
Justice Gorsuch, you have unleashed a whirl-
wind, and you will pay the price. You won’t 
know what hit you if you go forward with 
these awful decisions. 
Mr. Speaker, with words like that 
and threats like these, Congress cannot 
afford to wait. We have a duty to pro-
tect the Court, the Justices, and their 
families from political violence and in-
timidation. And we can meet that duty 
tonight before the House adjourns by 
sending this bill to the President’s 
desk. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to take from the Speaker’s table 
S. 4160, Supreme Court Police Parity 
Act, and ask for its immediate consid-
eration in the House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
guidelines consistently issued by suc-
cessive Speakers, as recorded in sec-
tion 956 of the House Rules and Man-
ual, the Chair is constrained not to en-
tertain the request unless it has been 
cleared by the bipartisan floor and 
committee leaderships. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, it is 
cleared on the Republican side. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the 
gentleman stating a parliamentary in-
quiry? 
Mr. MCCARTHY. No. I am just stat-
ing there is no objection on the Repub-
lican side, so that would only be the 
Democrats holding the bill up. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
f 
WILBUR DUMAS’ 100TH BIRTHDAY 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today in honor of the 100th 
birthday of Wilbur Dumas, a veteran 
and a well-accomplished Georgian. 
Wilbur was born in McRae, Georgia, 
in 1922 to James and Effie Dumas. In 
1943, he married the love of his life, 
Pollie Snow, in Morven, Georgia. 
Following his marriage, he was draft-
ed into the Army in 1944 during World 
War II and served in the Pacific. Wilbur 
was in the Tokyo Bay on September 2, 
1945, when the official instrument of 
surrender was signed by the Japanese 
on the USS Missouri. 
After the war, he and Pollie moved to 
Port Wentworth where they raised a 
daughter and two sons. They bought a 
house on Commonwealth Avenue in 
1951 where Wilbur still resides to this 
day. Wilbur retired from Kaiser Agri-
cultural Chemical Plant in Port Went-
worth in 1984. 
Unlike many, Wilbur lived to see his 
100th birthday this past May, and it 
was an honor and a privilege to cele-
brate his birthday with him at our 
home 
church 
at 
Port 
Wentworth 
United Methodist Church. 
I wish Mr. Dumas a happy 100th 
birthday. 
What an amazing achievement. 
f 
REQUEST TO CONSIDER S. 4160, SU-
PREME COURT POLICE PARITY 
ACT 
(Mrs. MCCLAIN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. MCCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, today 
an armed man with the intent to kill 
justice Kavanaugh was arrested near 
the Justice’s home. The Senate unani-
mously passed a bipartisan bill that 
would provide security to the Justices 
and their families. Yet House Demo-
crats have refused to act on it. 
Unlike the bills we voted on today, 
we actually have a bipartisan, com-
monsense solution to protect one of 
our Nation’s most sacred institutions. 
Therefore, I ask unanimous consent to 
take from the Speaker’s table S. 4160 
and ask for its immediate consider-
ation in the House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. As the 
Chair previously advised, that request 
cannot be entertained absent appro-
priate clearance. 
f 
THE CONSTITUTION IS ABSOLUTE 
(Ms. FOXX asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, we have cer-
tainly heard our fair share of hot air 
from Democrats as they attack the 
Constitution and the rights of Ameri-
cans. 
A Member from Rhode Island re-
cently said that the constitutional 
rights of the American people are BS. 
President Biden claimed that the Sec-
ond Amendment was not absolute. 
This is a new and dangerous standard 
that is being set—that the Constitu-
tion is merely a doormat that a Mem-
ber of Congress wipes his or her feet on. 
It will surely pain my Democrat col-
leagues to hear this, but I will say it 
anyway: the Constitution is absolute. 
If they have a problem respecting our 
founding document, then why did they 
take a take an oath to protect and de-
fend it in the first place? 
Perhaps they need to do some soul 
searching. 
f 
NUCLEAR ENERGY IS RENEWABLE 
ENERGY 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, it is not 
just American oil and natural gas ener-
gies that are under attack. Another 
one of the Nation’s top sources of en-
ergy, nuclear generation, has faced re-
peated operational obstacles and is fac-
ing threats of extinction. 
Nuclear power is one of the best 
choices for renewable energy we have. 
It is consistent, it runs 24/7, and it isn’t 
intermittent 
or 
dependent 
on 
the 
weather like wind or solar. It takes up 
a small physical footprint, such as 
California’s sole remaining reactors at 
Diablo Canyon, take up only 900 acres 
of land and provides nearly 10 percent 
of California’s energy portfolio and 23 
percent of our carbon-free generation 
that everybody is so worried about. 
It is affordable. Although power 
plants are expensive to build, like most 
things are, they are relatively cheap to 
run. 
Interestingly, nuclear generation has 
recently garnered widespread bipar-
tisan support. Recently, last month, 
the Biden administration launched a $6 
billion Federal effort to keep nuclear 
power plants open that are at risk of 
closing. 
Even 
California 
Governor 
Gavin Newsom seems to have reversed 
his opinion on nuclear energy and has 
expressed some level of support to keep 
Diablo Canyon open. 
Nuclear energy has had an unfair bad 
rap from past incidents, most notably 
Chernobyl. Well, this isn’t the 1980s So-
viet Union. This is the United States. 
We have the innovation and techno-
logical advances to make nuclear en-
ergy a cornerstone of our future in en-
ergy independence. We need to hang on 
to it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5405 
June 8, 2022 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
come tonight to pay tribute to the 
Wheeler Avenue Baptist Church in 
Houston, Texas, celebrating its 60th 
anniversary—its 
diamond 
anniver-
sary—and to thank the senior pastor, 
Dr. Marcus Cosby, and, of course, the 
pastor emeritus, the world renowned 
Rev. Dr. William A. Lawson. 
The leadership of Pastor Cosby is 
founded in his own spiritual grounding 
and as well his commitment, dedica-
tion, and respect for Pastor Lawson 
and his family. 
It is an interesting church now called 
the cathedral, and it is a place where 
people can come for refuge. It is a place 
of intellect and genius because of its 
many members of great talent. 
But, oh, they are the Good Samari-
tans. They are reminded as a church 
body that it is their goal and their re-
sponsibility to feed the hungry and 
those without clothes, those who need 
housing, and as well to open its doors 
to civic participation. 
This is a place that was founded by 
Pastor Lawson and his wife, the late 
Audrey Lawson, in their living room 60 
years ago as Pastor Lawson was, in 
fact, being the Pastor for TSU’s, Texas 
Southern University, students. 
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Wheeler 
Avenue Baptist Church because they 
are a church of action, service, and 
love of God. Bless them for their 60th 
anniversary. 
f 
CRISIS AT THE SOUTHERN 
BORDER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Wis-
consin (Mr. GROTHMAN) is recognized 
for 60 minutes as the designee of the 
minority leader. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, there 
are a variety of topics that I think 
have not been discussed enough lately 
but I think should be addressed on the 
floor. 
We have been gone for 2 weeks prior 
to reconvening this week, and in that 
time I took one more trip to the south-
ern border. I took the trip to the bor-
der because other than arguably the 
threat of an absolute catastrophe over 
the Ukraine, it is easily the biggest 
cause for concern in this country at 
this time. 
b 2045 
I went down to McAllen, Texas, with 
11 other Congressmen. Rather than 
having a trip of twelve which, as I un-
derstand, is the biggest group that has 
been at the border since COVID, we 
should have had 80 or 90 people there to 
see what is going on. 
Prior to talking about things that I 
saw on the trip, I will talk about the 
size of the problem, because the num-
bers tell the story. In the most recent 
April, we let 183,000 people in the coun-
try. 
Frequently, the press, for whatever 
reason, and some politicians, talk 
about the number of people who have 
contact with the Border Patrol. 183,000 
is the number who actually came in 
the country. A year ago in April, that 
number was 66,000. And 2 years ago it 
was 6,000. So we have gone from 6,000 
let in the country in April of 2020, April 
of 2021, 66,000 and, most recently, 
183,000. 
These numbers are staggering. The 
press should be reporting every month-
ly number with banner headlines. Per-
haps, because the story seems old, they 
get tired of reporting it. But it is a 
more significant story every month. 
Of those 183,000, about 60,000 are what 
we refer to as gotaways; that is, not 
people who checked in at the Border 
Patrol and got a cursory review. They 
are people who did not touch the Bor-
der Patrol at all. We don’t know 
whether they were sneaking in this 
country with drugs. We don’t know 
whether they had diseases. We don’t 
know whether they have criminal 
background problems. We don’t know. 
So from 6,000 to 66,000 to 183,000. Who 
knows what it is going to be by this 
time next year. Obviously, it is chang-
ing America dramatically. 
We do have ways to come in this 
country legally. We like to make sure 
that the future America is people who 
have proved themselves, law-abiding, 
hardworking. Here we have no idea who 
we are getting. 
I point out that one of the reasons 
more people are sneaking across the 
border is that, as we have approxi-
mately 120,000 people who check in 
with the Border Patrol, the Border Pa-
trol has to spend more of their time 
doing paperwork and not doing what 
they want to do, which is guard the 
border. That is why we are having a 
much more significant number of peo-
ple come here without any contact 
whatsoever. 
The Biden administration says they 
inherited a mess. They inherited 6,000 a 
month; and now we are at 183,000 a 
month. 
As far as other observations along 
the Rio Grande, the heartlessness of 
the Mexican drug cartels continues to 
be shown. When they want to get drugs 
here, because they know the Border 
Patrol is understaffed, what they do is 
they send a group of people across the 
river, and they know the Border Patrol 
will be obligated to deal with that 
group of people. And then they send an-
other group of people, say, a mile or 2 
miles further on down or further up 
river, where they know they can get 
across with their drugs. 
They also know the cartels are so 
brutal and heartless that they will 
throw a young child overboard in the 
Rio Grande because they know our eth-
ical Border Patrol will save that child, 
rather than deal with the people who 
are sneaking across, perhaps sneaking 
across with drugs. 
For the first time since I have been 
at the border—I have been down there 
several times, in part, due to my sub-
committee assignment, the fact that I 
am a ranking member. The people who 
showed me the Rio Grande pointed out 
at the bend of a river, here is where we 
have a lot of Chinese come across. 
Again, I think people are under the 
impression these are largely Mexican, 
Central American folks. I was surprised 
to hear from my guide that they point-
ed out this is the bend where we see a 
lot of Chinese coming across; which is, 
by the way, typical of what I have seen 
in other regions. This is people from all 
around the world. 
They also pointed out that one of the 
reasons so many people are coming 
here, they come here because the drug 
cartels are making money off them and 
advertising on social media all around 
the world, be it Central America, be it 
Brazil, be it Peru, be it India, or Paki-
stan, or Bangladesh, the drug cartels 
are making money on these folks. 
The further you come, the more they 
make per person. Maybe they are get-
ting six or $7,000 for Mexican, maybe 9 
or 10,000 for Central American, maybe 
15 or $20,000 from Asia. 
One more time—and I repeat things 
up here I find almost hard to believe. 
But one more time, I was told by the 
Border Patrol that right now the Mexi-
can drug cartels make more money 
smuggling people across the border 
than drugs, and that is really saying 
something. 
So, in addition to the other problems, 
we are strengthening the financial hold 
the drug cartels have on Mexico and, to 
a lesser degree, on the United States. 
It is not rocket science how to stop 
this. You stop it by going back to the 
migrant protection protocol in which 
people coming here were held in Mex-
ico pending a hearing. 
When I talk about the non getaways, 
about 120,000 a month, these folks are 
let in the United States and told to 
show up for a hearing at some time. 
They rarely show up. 
When people are paying 10 or $15,000 
to get this far, they would not come 
here in the first place if they were on 
the Mexican side of the border. People 
are not going to pay $15,000 to sit in 
Mexico and hope a hearing goes their 
way. 
So we should go back to the common 
sense provisions we had just a year and 
a half ago, and we would quickly get 
back down to the six or 10 or 15,000 a 
month, 
rather 
than 
the 
massive 
amount that is coming across the bor-
der. 
Another benefit of not having so 
many people cross the border, is we 
would 
decrease 
the 
number, 
the 
horrifically 
high 
number 
of 
drug 
overdoses we have in America. These 
numbers have been repeated, but it is 
another story that I think the press is 
dropping the ball on because they 
think because it is an old story it is 
not an important story. 
When I was elected to this job 7 years 
ago, about 47,000 Americans were dying 
every year of drug overdoses. That is 
now over 110,000. By comparison, 57,000 
American troops died in Vietnam. Over

June 8, 2022 
twice as many Americans die every 
year from drug overdoses in this coun-
try as died in 12 years in Vietnam. 
The apathy of the Biden administra-
tion on these numbers and, quite 
frankly, the apathy from the people in 
this Chamber is stunning. 110,000 peo-
ple are dying. Not only does that, by 
itself, mean we have to do a lot more 
at the border, we should greatly in-
crease the penalties for people who 
smuggle fentanyl or sell fentanyl in 
this country. 
Think about that. 110,000 people. 
Think 
about 
their 
parents. 
Think 
about their children. Think about their 
siblings as, for the rest of their life, 
they are going to carry that death with 
them. 
And what do we get from this admin-
istration? Nothing. The border is not a 
priority. We don’t care how much 
fentanyl comes here. 
So again, my request to this body 
and the request from the Biden admin-
istration, show a little bit of sympathy 
for the families, where the people who 
use these drugs die, and care a little bit 
about the future of America. 
In some years, over 800,000 people are 
sworn in as new citizens. Nobody com-
plains. They have been in the country 
5 or 6 years. They have proven they are 
not going to go on welfare. They have 
proven they are not going to commit 
crimes. I have attended their cere-
monies. They make one feel very good 
about being an American. I don’t know 
why we wouldn’t want to have every-
body 
come 
here 
under 
those 
cir-
cumstances, rather than this massive 
increase of people coming across the 
border. 
The next topic which should be dis-
cussed, and every Congressman who 
didn’t spend the last 2 weeks in their 
house heard about it, is the dramatic 
amount of inflation that is out here. 
One thing that bothers me, and it 
bothers me about my own party, is I 
don’t think we spend enough time talk-
ing about where the inflation came 
from. It came from excessive govern-
ment spending and the need of the Fed-
eral Reserve to, in essence, print 
money to deal with that spending. 
I point out that this was not a sur-
prise. I personally—I could say who am 
I—personally pointed out at the time 
the original stimulus package that 
President Biden signed almost imme-
diately upon getting—coming into of-
fice, the $1.9 trillion stimulus package, 
predictably caused this dramatic in-
crease in cost of food, cost of oil, cer-
tainly, cost of housing. 
I remind people that Larry Summers, 
key economist, key economic adviser 
to Barack Obama, said at the time that 
this was the least responsible economic 
policy in 40 years. That is what Barack 
Obama’s economic adviser said. 
But, instead, we got from the other 
side of the aisle, they ignored Mr. Sum-
mers’ concerns. They ignored the con-
cerns of Republicans. And upon Presi-
dent Biden taking office, whoosh, a 
new $1.9 trillion stimulus package. 
Soon thereafter, they added to that 
an over $1 trillion infrastructure bill 
which was bipartisan because they got 
a few irresponsible Republican Sen-
ators to vote for it. But, again, outside 
of regular budget process, these mas-
sive bills. 
And predictably, what happened is 
what Larry Summers and, quite frank-
ly, me and many Republicans said was 
going to happen, dramatic increase in 
inflation; huge increases in the money 
supply; increases in the money supply 
even greater than what we saw in the 
1970s under the Carter inflation. 
It is such a dangerous path we are 
taking. And I think, in the future, as 
President Biden continues to ask for 
more spending, and I think the level of 
spending he asked for in the regular 
budget is excessive in its own right; 
over 12 percent increase in nondefense 
spending there. It would be good if not 
just the Republicans, because we are in 
the minority, but the Democrats as 
well would stand up to President Biden 
and say no. 
We cannot have any more inflation. 
Inflation used to be known—and what 
it is is a regressive tax on the public. 
The average person spends more on 
gas—the average middle-class person 
spends more on gas than the wildly 
well-off person. They spend more on 
housing. They spend more on food. 
This is a policy that harms the mid-
dle class and harms the poor, quite 
frankly, far more than the billionaires 
which have such influence politically 
and get so involved in the last election. 
I know there were times where Re-
publicans stood up to President Trump 
when he wanted to issue new checks on 
some of this COVID bills and voted 
‘‘no.’’ It would be refreshing in the fu-
ture if we had some Democrats stand 
up and say, I voted for you President 
Biden, but this spending was just irre-
sponsible and out of control, and I can-
not stand with you. 
I would love it, in the appropriation 
bills, if we pass—in the current fiscal 
year, had no increase at all. That is not 
a dramatic thing. They should be cut 
dramatically. But it would be good if 
both the Republicans and Democrats 
got together and said we are going to 
go back to sequester sort of increases; 
things that we saw under Barack 
Obama even, and try to hold the in-
creases into under 1 percent, or perhaps 
nothing, because it is going to take 
quite a while to recover for the exces-
sive COVID spending, as well as the 
huge stimulus package that President 
Biden led off with. 
This is not something that was a sur-
prise. It was not something that was 
caused by Ukraine. It was something 
that every middle schooler should 
know. You cannot just print money 
and not have a huge impact on infla-
tion. 
The next thing we are going to look 
at here tonight is, quite frankly, the 
reason I ran for the job, and what I 
thought was the major problem in 
America, and still believe, other than 
the border, which maybe is nudged by 
it, or the threat of some catastrophic 
war in Europe, and that is the role that 
the Federal government has played in 
the breakdown of the American family. 
The number of children born without 
a father in the home was under 5 per-
cent before World War II, and kind of 
in the golden age of America, that is 
what was the norm. 
It is hard to believe anybody would 
not want the nuclear family to be the 
standard that American children grow 
up in. 
b 2100 
However, we do know that Karl 
Marx—and there is this romance with 
socialism that permeates part of the 
Democrat Party, permeates a lot of our 
academic institutions. Karl Marx felt 
that we had to destroy the American 
family. 
As I have said many times before, 
Black Lives Matter, on their website 
around the time of the last campaign, 
said that they wanted to get rid of the 
Western-proscribed nuclear family. 
First of all, it is an insult to the rest 
of the world because families with 
mothers and fathers at home are com-
mon in Asia, common in Africa, com-
mon everywhere. 
But in any event, it is apparent that 
the powerful Black Lives Matter at 
least said they wanted to get rid of the 
nuclear family. Karl Marx wanted to 
get rid of the nuclear family. 
What happened in America that we 
went from very few children not having 
a mom and dad at home to working our 
way to 40 percent of the children born 
in America without mom and dad at 
home? 
It didn’t just happen. It happened be-
cause this institution, beginning with 
who I think is the worst President in 
the country’s history until now, Lyn-
don Johnson, began a war on the fam-
ily. I guess he called it a war on pov-
erty. He really should have called it a 
war on the family. 
He began to put the government in a 
position in which they would take care 
of the children instead of both par-
ents—traditionally, the father. So, in 
other words, they substituted the gov-
ernment for the father in the home. 
Quickly, we reached the point where 
it ramped up from the middle sixties to 
the nineties, then dipped a little with 
welfare reform in the sixties, and now 
is on the upward climb. Forty percent 
of children go home to one parent. 
There are some parents who are able 
to swing it and do a good job, but let’s 
face it: It is much more difficult to 
raise kids in that circumstance, and 
the statistics show it. 
So, how has this body responded? It 
has responded by increasing the incen-
tives to not form a nuclear family. 
Right now, all the government transfer 
payments, be it medical care, be it food 
stamps, be it low-income housing, be it 
the earned income tax payment, be it 
the TANF payments, are all condi-
tioned upon families being in poverty.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5407 
June 8, 2022 
A lot of people considered in poverty 
I don’t think we would consider in pov-
erty. They maybe have an air-condi-
tioned apartment. They may have 
iPhones. They may have cars. But you 
are considered in poverty if you are not 
earning a great deal of money. And the 
bag of things you are getting can, in 
many cases, exceed that of what a 
working parent, frequently a father, in 
the home can provide. 
The government says provided you 
don’t get married to a guy with an in-
come or much of an income, we are 
going to give you a free apartment, fre-
quently a nicer apartment than people 
who are not in the system yet. We are 
going to give you free food. 
When I talk to the clerks at the gro-
cery stores and such, they frequently 
say the food one gets is more expensive 
than the clerks who work at the gro-
cery stores can afford. 
When you give free healthcare, when 
you give additional checks of some 
basis, TANF checks, you can quickly 
wind up in a situation in which, like I 
said, you are better off financially not 
getting married. 
This was, I think, the biggest policy 
mistake we have seen in America, per-
haps in hundreds of years, the decision 
in the 1960s to, in essence, have the 
government replace the husband. 
I think so many of the problems in 
America today, including the crime 
problems that we addressed or tried to 
address in the gun bills that were 
passed earlier today, actually wouldn’t 
be anywhere near the problem they are 
had we not done what we could to de-
stroy the American family as Karl 
Marx wanted. 
It is the bag of things one gets. Ef-
forts have been made throughout the 
last year and a half, some successful, 
some not, to push more and more 
money in the system for people or for 
single parents—could be a man, could 
be a woman—who are not married to 
someone with much of an income, the 
efforts made to increase the earned in-
come tax credit, the increases in the 
food stamps, the efforts made to put 
more low-income housing out there. 
I remember, too, as I mentioned, I 
talked to some of the admittedly more 
liberal people who administer the low- 
income housing. I asked them: What 
about the program don’t you like? 
Well, it is a good program I am glad 
to be part of here, but these people are 
getting nicer housing than I am get-
ting. 
It kind of reminds me like when you 
talk to the clerk at the grocery store. 
The people in the system are getting 
nicer groceries than the people not. 
The people getting the low-income 
housing, once they get off the waiting 
list, are sometimes getting better ac-
commodations than people who are off 
on their own, particularly couples 
starting out. 
In any event, I think if there is one 
thing I would like to have the Repub-
lican Party do, if we ever do get both 
Houses and the Presidency again, is to 
make a concerted effort to change 
these welfare programs so never again 
will the United States be in the busi-
ness of encouraging families without 
both parents, particularly encouraging 
families without a father at home. 
The results of Lyndon Johnson’s poli-
cies have been written about for 50 
years now. Whether we are talking 
about Daniel Moynihan or George Gild-
er or Robert Rector, everybody points 
it out. 
This breakdown in the family, which 
everybody knows is ruining America or 
is largely responsible for causing the 
moral decline in America, it didn’t just 
happen. It happened because the U.S. 
Government and people in this body 
wanted to take money and give it to 
people living a certain lifestyle and 
take it from the tax dollars of people 
living the nuclear family lifestyle. 
I strongly encourage people in this 
body, including Republican leadership, 
if we take control of this House 2 years 
from now with the Presidency, to make 
their number one priority flipping 
around these welfare programs which 
have done so much to lead to the moral 
decline that we have in America today. 
I realize it means standing up to the 
media. It is standing up to—a former 
Democrat mayor of Milwaukee used to 
refer to the poverty pimps. I don’t 
know whether they use that word any-
more. 
It will take standing up to the pov-
erty pimps and finally getting the 
strength of the American family back 
where it was in the 1960s, back where it 
was in the 1950s where our schools 
seemed to be doing a better job, where 
it didn’t seem like the crime was any-
where near as great as today. 
By the way, things like the murder 
rate should be falling precipitously be-
cause of improved medical care, but we 
still have a higher murder rate today, 
last year, than we did in the fifties, 
which is just preposterous but one of 
the effects of Lyndon Johnson’s war on 
the family. 
I leave that goal for both the Repub-
licans and Democrats, to stop and 
think what they can do to get the 
American family back where it was 60 
years ago. 
Those are some of what I consider 
the major issues in America, issues 
that should be talked about today and 
are, quite frankly, of more significance 
than some of the things that the media 
talks about. 
I hope when we get done taking our 
break near the end of June that we do 
something to address the border, or 
President Biden would address it im-
mediately, that we do something to ad-
dress 
the 
huge 
number 
of 
drug 
overdoses and all the broken hearts out 
there of the people who died because of 
this problem. 
I hope we begin to address the break-
down of the family that didn’t just 
happen. It happened almost by design 
of the government. I hope we do some-
thing about the excessive spending, 
which results in this inflation that 
makes it difficult for people at all ages 
of life. But I think it must make it so 
difficult for the youngest people as 
they look forward: Can we buy a home? 
Can we have children?

Vol. 168 
WASHINGTON, WEDNESDAY, JUNE 8, 2022 
No. 98

Eternal God, robed with honor and 
majesty, we praise You for the mar-
velous things You have done through-
out 
our 
Nation’s 
history. 
Lord, 
thoughts about Your mighty deeds con-

OFFICER

LUJA´ N). The Senator from Vermont. 
f 
GUN VIOLENCE 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is hard 
really to know where to start. I am 
here on the Senate floor to talk about 
guns. In a world in chaos, we cannot 
forget about the chaos right here at 
home. Gun violence is killing our chil-
dren: 19 students and two of their 
teachers in Uvalde 2 weeks ago; 20 chil-
dren, and 7 others, in Newtown, CT— 
nearly 10 years ago; 12 students and a 
teacher at Columbine—23 years ago. In 
between? Las Vegas, 58 dead; the Pulse 
nightclub, 49 dead; Marjory Stoneman 
Douglas High School, 17 dead—all vic-
tims of gun violence. And this is just a 
snapshot of the epidemic of gun vio-
lence in our country. 
I look back at my 48 years here in 
the Senate and say, When will we say 
enough? We hadn’t yet finished hon-
oring and celebrating the lives of the 10 
victims in Buffalo before news broke of 
the tragedy unfolding in Uvalde—19 
children, 2 teachers, massacred in their 
school, where they learn and work, 
where they should be safe—safe to just 
be children. 
This weekend, at least a dozen people 
were killed and 60 more injured in 
shooting incidents across the country. 
When is it enough? 
After Sandy Hook, well over decade 
after Columbine shook the Nation, the 
conscience of the country was stirred. 
Now, we said, now we must look at our 
gun laws. Now, we must think about 
what simply makes sense and what 
does not. The Judiciary Committee 
acted. I was proud to lead that, but the 
Senate did not. There were bipartisan 
proposals—proposals that I believe can 
muster bipartisan support again today, 
support that acknowledges that there 
is a problem and acknowledges that we 
can and must do something about it. 
The problem is not the Second Amend-
ment. The problem is the view that the 
Second Amendment is itself absolute. 
I was in Vermont last week, and peo-
ple would say to me, Of course, we pray 
for the victims, but we also pray that 
Congress will finally stand up and do 
something. 
I am with my fellow Vermonters. I 
am a lifelong gun owner. I was on the 
target shooting team at St. Michael’s 
College in Vermont, my alma mater— 
earned my letter in that. Millions of 
other Americans like myself, lifelong 
gun owners, are responsible gun owners 
and honor Americans’ rights to own 
firearms and choose to own firearms to 
defend their families, or to hunt—but 
not to commit battlefield-style mur-
ders. To most Americans, firearms are 
valued for defensive purposes and not 
for murder and mayhem. 
There are ways that we can use our 
common sense to keep our commu-
nities safe and keep guns out of the 
hands of people who are dangerous. 
Let’s start with background checks. 
They are a quick and easy way to help 
accomplish that goal. There is bipar-
tisan support to require background 
checks for commercial firearms sales. 
Now, I think we should go further, but 
we have to start somewhere, and com-
mercial sales background checks are a 
good start; background checks would 
help to bring common sense back into 
this discussion. 
How about extreme risk laws, also 
called ‘‘red flag’’ laws? We should en-
courage more States to enact these 
laws to allow loved ones or law enforce-
ment agencies to petition a court for 
an order that would temporarily pre-
vent an individual in crisis from ac-
cessing firearms. People who are in cri-
sis and are a danger to themselves or 
others should not have ready access to 
firearms. This, again, is practical com-
mon sense. 
We have seen where criminal gangs 
will send people into other States to 
make straw purchases of weapons that 
are then sold back to them. There is no 
criminal statute specifically prohib-
iting straw purchasing, so prosecutors 
have to rely on laws that prohibit mak-
ing false statements in connection with 
the purchase of a firearm—a paperwork

offense. There is bipartisan agreement 
that we should strengthen the pen-
alties for straw purchasers to deter 
this dangerous conduct. This, again, is 
practical common sense. 
We should also add common sense 
and consistency to minimum age re-
quirements to purchase guns. You have 
to be 21 to buy a handgun. You also 
have to be 21 to purchase alcohol or 
even cigarettes. But under our Federal 
laws? Just 18 to buy a shotgun or rifle, 
including an automatic rifle like those 
used on battlefields, like the ones used 
in Buffalo and Uvalde. And if we can-
not find enough common ground to ban 
military-style assault rifles, we should 
at least raise the age at which they can 
be purchased from 18 to 21. 
All of these proposals are practical 
common sense; they should be the least 
that Congress can do to help prevent 
the next mass shooting. But we have a 
problem. We have a problem in the 
United States when the leading cause 
of childhood death in 2020 was firearms. 
Think of that. Our children and our 
grandchildren—and the leading cause 
of death is firearms. 
We have a problem when we cannot 
stand up—and together—to respond to 
the fears of our children. We have a 
problem when we cannot push aside the 
interests of the NRA and the gun in-
dustry or of the Gun Owners of Amer-
ica or other pressure groups that tell 
us that Democrats are ‘‘coming for 
your guns.’’ Of course, some of the gun 
industry will say that because it boosts 
their sales. It boosts their sales, and 
children die. 
I am a Democrat. I am a gun owner. 
I have been both, nearly my entire life. 
I have also been a prosecutor and pros-
ecuted cases and went to death scenes 
at 3 in the morning and seeing people 
shot. I am also parent and a grand-
parent. I am a U.S. Senator. I am the 
Dean of the Senate, and I am a proud 
Vermonter. In my home State, we have 
a long tradition, dating back to our 
founding, of hunting the land. Owner-
ship of our firearms is part of that. I 
have also heard from more than 1,000 
Vermonters 
since 
Uvalde, 
urgently 
telling me that something must be 
done. 
When 
is 
it 
enough? 
Everywhere 
Marcelle and I went last week in 
Vermont, we heard, When is enough 
enough? 
I have spent months—or actually 
years—listening to my friends on the 
Republican side in Congress talk about 
protecting children. Who will step up 
now and who will step in to say 
enough? If we are to protect our chil-
dren, we must be the adults with the 
courage to listen to their fears and to 
act to alleviate them. We are the 
adults who must protect our children. 
We must protect our children. If we do 
nothing, we are not protecting them. 
This isn’t about politics. This isn’t 
about the moneyed interests of pres-
sure groups, lobbying Congress without 
acknowledging the tragedies in our 
world today. This isn’t even about you 
or me, Mr. President. This is about the 
thousands of people who are killed 
through gun violence every year and 
the countless family members forced to 
sorrowfully move on in their absence, 
saying, Why our family? Why our loved 
one? Why my parents? Why my chil-
dren? Why my brother? Or why my sis-
ter? Why? In this, the greatest country 
on earth, our horrific record of gun vio-
lence. 
In no way is this about revoking the 
Second Amendment, but about apply-
ing practical common sense safeguards 
to help mitigate the violence. 
Yet again, I ask, as I have since I 
have been in the Senate, and the Amer-
ican people ask: When is it enough? 
When is it enough? I join those who 
pray for the victims, but I especially 
join those who pray that Congress will 
have the courage, Democrats and Re-
publicans alike, to finally do some-
thing meaningful. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-

f 
GUN VIOLENCE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, today, 
the House oversight and reform com-
mittee heard from a witness who, by 
all means, should never ever have had 
to come before the Congress, Miah 
Cerrillo, an 11-year-old girl who sur-
vived the shooting in Uvalde, TX. 
Our House colleagues will also hear 
from Felix and Kimberly Rubio, the 
parents of 10-year-old Lexi, who was 
killed in the shooting. You can just 
imagine their broken hearts. 
They will also hear from the only pe-
diatrician in Uvalde available to treat 
the victims on that awful, awful, awful 
day. 
I hope every single Member of the 
House and Senate pays attention to 
these proceedings. God knows, many in 
Congress need to listen to what these 
witnesses have to say. 
We need to listen, and Congress needs 
to act, because across every neighbor-
hood, every school, every city, every 
town—urban, suburban, rural—Ameri-
cans are wondering the same thing: 
When is Congress going to act to stop 
the violence? 
Now, that is precisely what we are 
working on right now in the Senate. It 
will be hard to believe, after hearing 
what these witnesses have to say, that 
the Senate cannot find a way to come 
together and act on gun violence. 
Over the past week and a half, my 
Democratic colleagues, led by the ef-
forts of Senators MURPHY, SINEMA, 
BLUMENTHAL, MANCHIN, COONS, HEIN-
RICH, and others, have been holding 
good faith talks with Republicans to 
see if we can arrive at an agreement on 
gun violence legislation. 
As I have said, these bipartisan talks 
deserve the space they need to produce 
meaningful results, and so I hope my 
colleagues continue to make progress 
toward an effective agreement—hope-
fully, by the end of the week. 
The overwhelming consensus of our 
caucus, among the gun safety violence 
prevention advocates and among the 
American people, is that even if we 
can’t get everything done, that getting 
something real done is worth pursuing. 
Let me repeat that. It is an over-
whelming consensus in this caucus, 
among the broad panoply of gun 
groups, gun safety groups, and among 
the American people: Get something 
done. Get something real done, even if 
it is not everything that many of us 
would wish for. 
Given the other side’s long-held re-
fusal to do anything meaningful on gun 
violence, we know how difficult this is. 
But that is all the more reason for us 
to explore every realistic opportunity 
to getting something real done. 
We know we won’t get everything we 
want. The debate for gun safety will 
continue after this moment, but we 
have a moral obligation right now to 
try and get something meaningful— 
something meaningful—done for the 
American people in the name of those 
who have died. 
This is not a partisan issue. Gun safe-
ty is overwhelmingly backed by a large 
majority of Americans, a majority of 
Democrats, Republicans, Independents. 
It is bipartisan because all Americans 
know the same thing: We stand alone 
in the developed world in the number 
of mass shootings that take place 
every year. We stand alone among the 
developed nations in the world in that 
on any given day, another school, an-
other grocery store, another hospital, 
another concert, another neighborhood 
can suddenly become a site of unimagi-
nable tragedy. 
Americans, many for the first time, 
are thinking: I am going to be shot, 
whether they are in a supermarket, 
their kids are in a school, or anywhere 
else. 
And we stand alone in that year after 
year, the plague of mass shootings in 
this country has been met by inaction. 
When other countries have faced these 
mass shootings, they have acted, and 
they have acted well. 
Why aren’t we? 
The American people are tired and 
angry of the same thing happening 
again and again. They are tired of 
nothing getting done. They are tired of 
the greatest country in the world being 
paralyzed and not acting in a right 
way, mainly because people on the 
other side of the aisle haven’t joined 
us.

S2843 
June 8, 2022 
But I urge my colleagues now, let’s 
get something done. The sooner we act, 
the greater chance we have of pre-
venting another senseless mass shoot-
ing in America. Let’s break this cycle 
of gun violence, and let’s end the days 
when parents, doctors, and children 
have to come to the U.S. Capitol in 
order to beg their elected representa-
tives to take action. 
f 
JANUARY 6 HEARINGS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now, 
on FOX News and January 6. 
Tomorrow evening, the House Select 
Committee will hold its first public 
hearings on the insurrection of Janu-
ary 6. It will be a watershed moment 
for what has now been a 10-month in-
vestigation to uncover the truth of 
what happened on that terrible, ter-
rible day in our Nation’s history. 
The American people need to see Jan-
uary 6 for what it was—a deliberate, 
organized, and violent attempt to re-
verse a free and fair election. It was a 
profane and grotesque assault upon 
American democracy. Worst of all, it 
was part of a larger effort from the 
hard right to erode our constitutional 
order from within. 
Just a couple of days ago, someone 
was arrested who said he was within 20 
feet of me and was trying to get me as 
we left this Chamber. 
These hearings will be essential view-
ing. They are a direct look into the 
dark soul of the hard right, and every 
single American needs to know the 
truth of what happened that day. 
Every major broadcast and cable net-
work will cover these proceedings 
live—every network except one, that 
is: FOX News. 
In one of the most cowardly journal-
istic decisions in modern memory, FOX 
News, one of main amplifiers of the Big 
Lie about January 6 and about the 
election, has stated they will not 
broadcast Thursday’s hearing. 
After giving the likes of Tucker Carl-
son a blank check to spread conspiracy 
theories and White supremacist views 
night after night, it is beyond repug-
nant that FOX News refuses to cover 
the investigation into the deadliest at-
tack on our democracy in modern his-
tory. 
It is a disgusting and treacherous de-
cision, one that will gravely harm our 
democracy, one that deliberately will 
conceal the truth from a large portion 
of the viewing public. 
Let me say it once again. FOX’s deci-
sion not to air live proceedings on Jan-
uary 6 is cowardly and is tantamount 
to hiding the truth from the American 
people. 
FOX News has an obligation to report 
the facts of the January 6 investigation 
so their viewers can learn the truth, es-
pecially after FOX News was one of the 
main propagators of so many of the Big 
Lies. 
Are they a real news station? They 
don’t seem to be. I hope they reverse 
this awful decision. 
HONORING OUR PACT ACT OF 2021 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, fi-
nally, on the PACT Act, today, the 
Senate is going to adopt a motion to 
proceed to Honoring our PACT Act, 
and my colleague from Montana, chair 
of our Veterans’ Committee, who has 
worked so hard on this, will speak 
about that shortly, in a moment. 
The PACT Act is one of the most im-
portant veteran healthcare bills this 
Chamber has considered in decades. 
Yesterday, the Senate invoked cloture 
on the motion to proceed by a whop-
ping 86 votes. 
Three and a half million veterans— 
three and a half million—have been 
likely exposed to toxic chemicals in 
the line of duty since 2001. Over the 
years, these toxic exposures have led to 
terrible healthcare complications that 
have cut too many lives short and bur-
dened far too many of our Nation’s he-
roes. 
Tragically, many of our Nation’s vet-
erans have been unable to access the 
care they need because of outdated VA 
rules that dictate eligibility for bene-
fits. The PACT Act would fix that for 
some of the biggest reforms to the VA 
ever. 
It is a no-brainer to move forward on 
a bill to take care of veterans who have 
been exposed to toxins in the line of 
duty. We cannot let dilatory or de-
structive amendments stand in the way 
of the need of our veterans’ dire and 
crucial needs. 
Again, last night’s vote was over-
whelmingly bipartisan. There is no rea-
son for us not to pass this important, 
vital, sensible bill A-S-A-P. Every one 
of us in this Chamber has heard from a 
military servicemember who is strug-
gling to afford quality healthcare, and 
this is one of the best steps the Senate 
can take to improve the lives of those 
who have given their all for our coun-
try. 
Veterans service organizations across 
the country are urging the Senate to 
act, so let’s get this bill passed with 
the same bipartisan good will that has 
characterized the negotiations to date. 
I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2844 
June 8, 2022 
they seek care and benefits because of 
the impact of toxic exposure on their 
lives. 
In the worst care scenarios, folks are 
paying the price with their lives—vet-
erans and heroes like Sergeant First 
Class Robinson, for whom this bill is 
named after. 
Look, we have made some incredible 
advances as a country over our history 
when it comes to taking care of our 
servicemembers both in-theater and 
after they get back home. The survival 
on the battlefield now compared to 50 
years ago has been improved amaz-
ingly. 
Prosthetics—we 
have 
done 
some 
amazing work with prosthetics for the 
folks who have come back who are 
missing limbs. We have been working 
hard on mental health. We are not 
where we need to be, but we are mak-
ing some advances. We have got more 
stuff to do, particularly in the area of 
transition and implementation of al-
ternate forms of mental healthcare. 
But the fact is, with toxic exposure, 
we have never done a good job. This 
bill will put the VA and put this Nation 
on the right track to addressing dec-
ades of inaction and failure by our gov-
ernment—by us—to pay for the cost of 
the war. 
So what does it do? It expands eligi-
bility—expands 
eligibility—for 
VA 
healthcare to more than 31⁄2 million 
combat veterans exposed to burn pits 
since 9/11. 
It supports our post-9/11 and Viet-
nam-era veterans by removing the bur-
den of proof for 23 presumptive condi-
tions caused by toxic exposure, from 
cancers to lung diseases. 
It establishes a framework for the es-
tablishment of future presumptions of 
service connection related to toxic ex-
posure. So why is this important? Well, 
you know how the Senate works. Of-
tentimes, it takes a long time to get 
much done, and it has taken an act of 
Congress—literally, an act of Con-
gress—to get these presumptives ap-
proved in the past. 
Now the VA is going to have a struc-
ture where they can follow the science 
and get these toxic exposures covered, 
the ones that are going to happen in 
the future—and, unfortunately, I am 
afraid that they will happen in the fu-
ture so this structure is important. 
This bill also gives the VA the tools 
it needs to bolster its workforce, to es-
tablish more healthcare facilities, to 
improve claims processing, which will 
better meet the immediate and future 
needs of every veteran that the VA 
serves. 
I have talked about the costs. The 
costs are $287 billion over 10—signifi-
cant, very significant, but it is a cost 
of war. 
Keep in mind that this substitute— 
because of the work that the staffs 
have done in a bipartisan way—is $50 
billion less than the House-passed toxic 
exposure bill. 
So we have done our best to make 
sure that this bill meets the needs of 
our veterans and also meets the needs 
of our taxpayers. 
This is the right thing to do, and it is 
the right thing to get done today be-
cause right now our veterans are pay-
ing the cost. They are the only ones 
paying the cost, and they cannot afford 
to wait any longer. 
I yield the floor.

EXECUTIVE SESSION 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will pro-
ceed to executive session and resume 
consideration of the following nomina-
tion, which the clerk will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read the nomination of Lisa M. Gomez, 
of New Jersey, to be an Assistant Sec-
retary of Labor. 
Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I sug-
gest the absence of a quorum. 
The

OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF MINORITY LEADER 
The Republican leader is recognized. 
U.S. SUPREME COURT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, 6 
months ago, the Washington Post pub-
lished an extremely disturbing report. 
According to the report, a man in his 
mid-20s was stopped near the house of a 
Supreme Court Justice carrying a 
weapon and burglary tools. He report-
edly told police he intended to murder 
the Justice. Reportedly, he indicated 
he was angry at the decision he thinks 
the Court may reach in an upcoming 
case in light of the unconscionable 
leak from a few weeks back. 
So this is where we are. This is where 
we are. If these reports are correct, it 
was an assassination attempt against a 
sitting Justice, or something close to 
it. 
This is exactly—exactly—the kind of 
event that many feared that the ter-
rible breach of the Court’s rules and 
norms could fuel. This is exactly the 
kind of event that many worried the 
unhinged, reckless, apocalyptic rhet-
oric from prominent figures toward the 
Court going back many months and es-
pecially in recent weeks could make 
more likely. 
This is exactly—exactly—why the 
Senate passed legislation very shortly 
after the leak to enhance the police 
protection for Justices and their fami-
lies. 
This 
is 
commonsense, 
non-
controversial legislation that passed in 
this Chamber—in this Chamber—unani-
mously. 
But House Democrats have spent 
weeks blocking—blocking the measure 
that passed here unanimously related 
to security for Supreme Court Justices. 
The House’s Democrats have refused to 
take it up. 
Now, look, that needs to change, and 
it needs to change right now. Right 
now. House Democrats must pass this 
bill and they need to do it today. No 
more fiddling around with this. They 
need to pass it today. They need to 
stop their multiweek blockade against 
the Supreme Court security bill and 
pass it before the sun sets today. 
I will have more to say on this sub-
ject as the facts continue to unfold. 
INFLATION 
Mr. President, on a completely dif-
ferent matter, rising food prices have 
been one of the most relentless and 
painful aspects of the historic inflation 
unfolding on Democrats’ watch. 
One year ago, President Biden’s 
White House bragged—bragged—that 
the cost of an Independence Day cook-
out would be 16-cents cheaper than the 
year before. Well, in the past year food 
prices have jumped more than 9 per-
cent. So that same spread won’t be 
cents cheaper, it will be dollars more 
expensive. 
Grocery store prices have risen at 
their fastest rate since 1980, and at full- 
service restaurants, prices have jumped 
more in the past 12 months than any 
year on record. Any year on record. 
There has been 17 straight months of 
rising food prices. 
So this is not a ‘‘Putin’’ price hike. 
As one of my constituents in Nancy, 
KY, put it a few months back, ‘‘Many 
people are scared that they might have 
to choose between eating and heating 
the house.’’ 
Democrats’ failed policies have made 
it harder to feed a family in America, 
but the pain isn’t limited to the super-
market or to the dinner table, it in-
cludes producers at every step of the 
supply chain. 
According to the owner of Jot ‘Em 
Down Store, which boasts the oldest 
lunch counter in Lexington, rising 
costs have come from all directions. 
‘‘This year, we’ve been hampered by 
supply chain issues, rising gas prices 
[and] inflation . . .’’ 
In my hometown of Louisville, the 
operator of one stand at the local farm-
ers market elaborated, ‘‘The feed to 
feed animals has gone up. Packaging, 
processing has gone up. . . . Butter has 
gone up three times in the last 4 
weeks.’’ Our food producers are feeling 
the pinch. 
A soybean farmer in Muhlenberg 
County put it this way: ‘‘I can put out 
two, maybe three crops in years past 
for what it’s costing this year.’’ 
A corn grower in Christian County 
says rising prices are ‘‘crippling family 
farms like mine.’’ 
Of course, Kentucky farmers are not 
alone. Across America, farm country 
has been absolutely hammered on 
Democrats’ watch. And by the Biden 
administration’s own data, farm pro-
duction expenses from animal feed to 
diesel fuel are climbing even higher 
this year than last year.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2845 
June 8, 2022 
It is a really hard time to be in the 
business of feeding America. But it 
didn’t have to be this way. It didn’t 
have to be this way. Washington Demo-
crats didn’t have to ram through a 
multitrillion-dollar wish list of infla-
tionary spending last spring. The Biden 
administration didn’t have to declare 
war on affordable American energy on 
day one. 
Needless to say, millions of working 
American families sit down for dinner 
these days wondering why on Earth 
they did. 
TRIBUTE TO KENNY KLEIN 
Mr. President, now finally, on one to-
tally different matter, it is my privi-
lege today to pay honor to an iconic 
Kentuckian. 
The NCAA basketball season may 
only last 5 months, but for our out-
going University of Louisville media 
relations manager and Senior Asso-
ciate Athletic Director Kenny Klein, 
the game has been a four-decade odys-
sey. 
When Kenny joined the U of L pro-
gram in 1983, he was the youngest 
Sports Information Director at an 
NCAA Division I football school. Now 
some might have doubted this young 
Tennessean could manage U of L’s im-
passioned 
fan 
base 
or 
Louisville’s 
prickly sports reporters, but he proved 
them all wrong. Long after games 
ended, after players went back to the 
locker 
rooms, 
after 
fans 
returned 
home, Kenny would stay in his office 
well into the night. He would pore over 
notes and statistics to perfect his an-
swers to journalists’ questions, and he 
would stash a cold beer in his desk for 
any reporter who spent the long nights 
with him. 
He was there for the team’s highs— 
888 wins, two NCAA titles—and he 
deftly managed the team’s lows as 
well. Referring to Kenny’s flawless 
handling of media frenzies, one former 
Courier-Journal sports journalist sug-
gested Kenny could run a course in cri-
sis management in his retirement. 
That kind of sterling praise from an 
adversarial journalist, no less, is proof 
of Kenny’s magic touch with the 
media. 
Over the course of his long career, he 
became the face U of L basketball to 
fans spanning generations. As an exam-
ple, the star player of the 1986 cham-
pionship squad Kenny Payne arrived on 
campus during Klein’s second year on 
the job. And next year, Payne will be 
on the court coaching the school’s bas-
ketball program. So students, athletes, 
and administrators came and went, but 
they could always count on Kenny 
Klein’s constant presence. 
Since announcing his retirement, 
Kenny has received an outpouring of 
support from across the country, in-
cluding a Lifetime Achievement Award 
from the College Sports Information 
Directors of America. 
Everyone, from Louisville’s newest 
students to Kenny’s biggest fan in the 
U.S. Capitol, is sad to see him leave his 
post. And we are glad that, after some 
begging, he has promised to stay at U 
of L in a reduced capacity. 
So we all wish him the best in the 
next chapter of his extraordinary life. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
TITLE 42 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, 3 weeks 
ago, a Federal judge blocked the Biden 
Administration from lifting title 42 
COVID restrictions. It was a welcome 
decision that will hopefully stave off 
an additional flood of illegal immigra-
tion on our southern border. But it has 
been pretty much the only bit of good 
news on this front, because the situa-
tion at our southern border is out of 
control. 
In April, U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection encountered 234,088 individ-
uals attempting to cross our border il-
legally—234,088. That is the highest 
number ever recorded. 
The Border Patrol is stretched thin. 
A recent article reported that ‘‘around 
60 percent of CBP agents have been as-
signed to process migrants, taking 
them away from field work.’’ Sixty per-
cent. Detention facilities are over-
flowing and massive numbers of illegal 
immigrants are being released into the 
country, many of whom will never re-
port to an immigration office as or-
dered. 
In short, our southern border is in 
chaos, and if title 42 is lifted, the situa-
tion is almost guaranteed to become 
much worse. 
The Department of Homeland Secu-
rity has estimated that as many as 
18,000 migrants per day could attempt 
to cross our southern border if the pol-
icy is lifted. Eighteen thousand per 
day—that is more than double the 
number we are currently experiencing, 
and the administration has yet to im-
plement any plan for dealing with such 
a situation. 
Illegal immigration, especially the 
kind of out-of-control illegal immigra-
tion we are now experiencing, has seri-
ous consequences. Criminals, including 
human traffickers, drug smugglers, and 
gang members, regularly attempt to 
cross our southern border. The worse 
the situation at our border gets, the 
easier it is for those individuals to 
make their way into the United States, 
and that has consequences for our en-
tire country. 
South Dakota law enforcement offi-
cials tell me that they are seizing 
drugs that they can trace directly back 
to the cartels who smuggle these drugs 
across our border. Our country is cur-
rently in the midst of a fentanyl crisis. 
In fact, right now, fentanyl overdose is 
the leading cause of death for U.S. 
adults between the ages of 18 and 45. 
And where is all this fentanyl coming 
from? Most of it is being trafficked 
across our southern border; and when 
more and more of our Customs and 
Border Protection agents have been 
pulled off the border to process mi-
grants, it is pretty much a guarantee 
that drug smugglers are having a much 
easier time in getting their product 
into the country. 
I mentioned that Customs and Border 
Protection 
encountered 
more 
than 
234,000 individuals who were attempt-
ing to cross our southern border ille-
gally in the month of April, but that 
number only reflects individuals the 
CBP has actually apprehended. In 
April, Homeland Security Secretary 
Mayorkas testified that, in addition to 
the 1.7 million apprehensions at the 
southern border in fiscal year 2021, 
there were more than 389,000 ‘‘got- 
aways’’—individuals the Border Patrol 
saw but was unable to apprehend. 
The Economist recently reported: 
One border expert estimates that less than 
20 percent of people trying to cross the bor-
der undetected are stopped. 
The administration has attempted to 
suggest that the surge in illegal immi-
gration that we have been experiencing 
since President Biden took office is, in 
large part, a function of conditions in 
other countries; but while these factors 
exist—and there are legitimate asylum 
claims at the border—that doesn’t 
mean there is nothing the President 
can do about our out-of-control border 
situation. Better border security is 
well within the President’s control. He 
is just not interested in putting it in 
place, and his Vice President has all 
but formally abandoned her role as bor-
der czar. 
In fact, since taking office, the Presi-
dent has invited increased illegal im-
migration with the policy decisions 
that he has made. On his very first day 
in office, President Biden rescinded the 
declaration of a national emergency at 
our southern border; he halted con-
struction of the border wall; he re-
voked a Trump administration order 
that called for the government to 
faithfully execute our immigration 
laws; and his Department of Homeland 
Security issued guidelines pausing de-
portations except under certain condi-
tions. That was all—all—on his first 
day in office. 
Needless to say, the effect of all of 
this was to declare to the world that 
the U.S. borders were effectively open. 
And, of course, the President’s anti- 
border security efforts didn’t end there. 
The President has significantly lim-
ited the ability of Immigration and 
Customs Enforcement to enforce immi-
gration laws. Deportations dropped 
precipitously during fiscal year 2021, as 
did arrests in the interior of the coun-
try. In March, the administration re-
scinded a 2019 rule expanding the expe-
dited removal for individuals here ille-
gally; and as I have mentioned, of 
course, the administration is attempt-
ing to remove title 42 COVID–19 re-
strictions with no visible plan to con-
trol the resulting surge in illegal im-
migration.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2846 
June 8, 2022 
President Biden has made it known 
that he wants to create a ‘‘fair, or-
derly, and humane’’ immigration sys-
tem. Well, he is failing on all fronts. I 
don’t need to tell anyone that the situ-
ation at the southern border, right 
now, is far from orderly, but it is also 
not humane. The President and other 
members of his party tend to convey an 
attitude that strong border security 
and the enforcement of our Nation’s 
immigration laws are somehow not 
compassionate or humane. Well, they 
are wrong. We are seeing the effects of 
the President’s anti-border security 
policies at our southern border right 
now, and the results are neither com-
passionate nor humane. 
Encouraging individuals to make the 
oftentimes dangerous journey to our 
southern border in the hopes they will 
be able to slip across illegally is not 
humane. Encouraging families and, at 
times, unaccompanied children to ex-
pose themselves to the dangers of heat 
and the elements and human traf-
ficking is not compassionate. At least 
557 migrants died while attempting to 
cross the southern border during fiscal 
year 2021. That, too, was a record num-
ber. How many of them were encour-
aged to make the journey by the Presi-
dent’s lax border policies? 
And I haven’t even mentioned the 
lack of compassion and humanity the 
President displays for Americans af-
fected by the illegal immigration cri-
sis. Straining the resources of U.S. bor-
der communities by smoothing the way 
for illegal immigration and cross-bor-
der criminal activity is not compas-
sionate. Making it easier for cartels to 
flood our Nation with fentanyl is not 
humane. 
The President of the United States— 
any President—has a special responsi-
bility for our Nation’s security, and 
that includes securing our Nation’s 
border. So far, President Biden has 
spectacularly failed to meet that re-
sponsibility. This week, a caravan of 
thousands has reportedly started work-
ing its way north, through Mexico, 
aligning with the Summits of the 
Americas. 
It is long past time for the President 
to get serious about the border crisis 
that he has created, and this summit 
could be an opportunity for him to fi-
nally take action. I hope that he will 
reverse his current course before his 
administration’s signature accomplish-
ment ends up being a legacy of chaos at 
our southern border. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak as if in

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
HONORING OUR PACT ACT OF 2021 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, every 
Senator here has a serious responsi-
bility to make sure that our veterans 
get the support and help they are 
promised after their service to our 
country, and that includes making sure 
that those who have been harmed by 
toxic exposures during their service get 
the service and care they deserve. It 
seems pretty simple, but I hope we can 
hold up our end of the bargain today. 
My dad was a World War II veteran— 
he was a Purple Heart recipient—and 
when he got really sick with multiple 
sclerosis, help from the VA made a 
huge difference for my family. So I 
want to really thank Senators TESTER 
and MORAN for their persistent work on 
this bill. I am glad we have come to a 
bipartisan agreement on the PACT Act 
because it does matter, it will help peo-
ple, and it will save lives. 
Right now, the reality is that too 
many veterans are living with chronic 
illness and respiratory diseases as a re-
sult of toxic exposures from their time 
serving our country in uniform. I have 
heard countless stories about the chal-
lenges they have faced struggling to 
get access to VA care and benefits they 
have earned, and that is unacceptable. 
I believe very strongly that no one 
who put their life or health on the line 
for our Nation should face hurdles get-
ting the care or medical treatment 
they need as a result of that sacrifice. 
When they signed up to serve, we told 
them we would have their backs long 
after their service, so if we are going to 
live up to our promise, then we need to 
pass comprehensive legislation to en-
sure all veterans have access to the VA 
services they deserve. Simply put, we 
need to pass this PACT Act. 
With this bill, generations of toxic- 
exposed veterans would finally be able 
to get the high-quality care they need, 
and the VA will get the resources need-
ed to process claims efficiently and 
better serve our veterans. 
I remember, back when I was 22 years 
old, I interned at the Seattle veterans 
hospital. I have visited with and met 
with VA staff in every part of Wash-
ington State. The doctors, the nurses, 
and everyone else working at our VA 
medical centers really care about this 
work, they care about this Nation, and 
they care about their mission, but they 
need us here in Congress to care just as 
much and fight just as hard for their 
patients, our veterans. That is really 
what this bill is about. 
When VA was considering closing or 
reducing services in Walla Walla, I 
fought back to make sure that our vet-
erans in rural Washington were able to 
see a doctor without having to drive 2 
hours or longer, sometimes through a 
lot of rain and snow. 
About 1 in every 10 residents in 
Washington State is a veteran, and I 
am privileged enough to serve on the 
Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee. It 
is my job to be a voice for Washington 
State veterans who are in Seattle or 
Spokane or Walla Walla or anywhere, 
and that is a job I take seriously. That 
is why I have been continually pressing 
the VA Secretary to cut redtape and 
make sure the VA caregivers program 
works for everyone who needs it, the 
way we wrote it. It is why I introduced 
the Helping Heroes Act to get families 
and kids of disabled veterans the as-
sistance they need. It is why I will 
keep doing everything in my power to 
hold the VA accountable for its really 
unacceptable rollout of the electronic 
health record system in Washington 
State. 
There is a lot we need to do to really 
make sure the VA works for veterans, 
but passing the PACT Act, getting this 
done, is an important and meaningful 
process. 
Washington State veterans deserve 
the very best the VA has to offer, and 
there should be absolutely nothing con-
troversial about making sure all vet-
erans across all generations who are 
suffering from chronic illness get the 
care they have earned. 
I am glad to see we have bipartisan 
support for this bill. Let’s get it done 
and to the President’s desk. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
HEALTH INSURANCE 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today on behalf of 9 
million Americans who directly bene-
fited from very important health insur-
ance credits in the American Rescue 
Plan—credits that are set to expire at 
the end of the year if Congress doesn’t 
act. I don’t believe enough attention 
has been focused on this issue. 
Last year, in March of 2021, we came 
to this very Chamber and passed the 
American Rescue Plan, which provided 
a crucial lifeline for so many families. 
We eliminated health insurance pre-
miums for low-wage workers making 
less than 150 percent of the Federal 
poverty level, expanded eligibility for 
health insurance tax credits to middle- 
class families, and guaranteed that 
health coverage would not cost more 
than 8.5 percent of a person’s income. 
The American Rescue Plan also in-
creased the size of the tax credit for all 
eligible income brackets, putting more 
money in workers’ pockets. 
As a result, ACA health insurance 
premiums were brought down by an av-
erage of $50 per person per month, and 
people in both New Mexico and in Min-
nesota took great advantage of that. 
As a result, a record number of Ameri-
cans—14.5 million Americans—are en-
rolled in the Affordable Care Act 
health insurance plans. That is 2.5 mil-
lion more people who signed up in a

single year than ever before. In my 
home State, that translated to a 
record-low uninsured rate of just 4 per-
cent. That means 96 percent of Min-
nesotans have health insurance, which 
is a great improvement over where it 
was. 
Millions 
more 
Minnesotans 
and 
Americans now have the peace of mind 
that comes with affordable, quality 
health coverage. Eligible households in 
Minnesota have an annual average 
ACA tax credit of $3,600. That is $3,600 
freed up for housing, gas, and groceries, 
while 
maintaining 
access 
to 
healthcare. But unless Congress acts to 
make the enhanced, family-friendly 
tax credits currently set to expire at 
the end of 2022 permanent, millions of 
Americans will have the rug pulled out 
from under them, likely seeing a dou-
ble-digit hike on their health insurance 
premiums. 
Karen 
Tumulty, 
a 
col-
umnist for the Washington Post, called 
it a ‘‘ticking time bomb.’’ 
If these tax credits are not made per-
manent, 70,000 Minnesotans—or 61 per-
cent of Minnesota families—purchasing 
health insurance on their own could 
see a 35- to 41-percent increase in their 
health insurance premiums, and over 
10,000 Minnesotans could lose their 
health insurance tax credits in 2023 un-
less Congress acts. 
In my State, Americans between the 
ages of 55 and 64 would be most af-
fected, and you think about this with 
cost issues and inflation and all the 
things people are already facing. Right 
now, a 60-year-old Minnesota couple 
with a household income of $75,000 is 
saving $773 in monthly premiums. Tak-
ing away those tax credits would in-
crease their annual health spending by 
at least $9,000. That is like taking away 
multiple paychecks. 
It is no wonder that Americans over-
whelmingly support making these tax 
credits permanent. Doctors and pa-
tients have called on us to protect 
these historic gains in affordability, 
coverage, and equity. Families can’t 
afford to go back to paying upwards of 
20 percent or more of their monthly in-
come toward healthcare premiums. 
This is important for patients, and it 
is also important for providers. We 
know—hearing 
when 
we 
are 
back 
home—that 
many 
hospitals 
are 
stretched thin right now, and putting 
millions of Americans’ healthcare in 
jeopardy is going to create a lot of vol-
atility as patients are forced to disrupt 
their care and cancel procedures. 
At a time when so many families are 
struggling to make ends meet, we just 
can’t sit back and let those ACA tax 
credits expire. More Americans insured 
is good for patients, good for families, 
good for communities, and good for our 
country. 
I would note one other thing I would 
do when it comes to healthcare, and 
that is making sure that we allow 
Medicare to negotiate prices under 
Medicare Part D for pharmaceuticals. 
While our communities are facing the 
potential of this—what the Washington 
Post called a ‘‘ticking time bomb’’—we 
also must act when it comes to phar-
maceuticals because those prices are 
also going up. 
I have just presented two really 
straightforward ways that we can help 
families with costs when it comes to 
healthcare. One is making sure we keep 
in place the tax credits that protect 
middle-class families in this country, 
and the second is to make sure we 
allow Medicare to negotiate better 
prices under Medicare Part D because 
when you look at what is happening 
right now, we continue to see major 
drugs—major drugs—go up, doubling, 
go up 200 percent, 300 percent, to the 
point where we are already paying dou-
ble what they pay in Canada for a sig-
nificant number of drugs. For Min-
nesota, that is right across the border. 
We must allow, in my mind, re-
importation of less expensive drugs, 
but the biggest game changer would be 
to lift the ban that the pharmaceutical 
companies got in place in law that says 
Medicare, representing tens of millions 
of seniors, is not allowed to negotiate 
cheaper prices. That is what the VA 
does, and it has been really good for 
our veterans. We should allow the same 
help for 46 million seniors. It will be 
good for all Americans because it will 
bring down the taxpayer expense in 
part of the payment of drugs, and it 
will be good for individual consumers. 
So let’s get these two things done. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

nized your enormous service yesterday,

(Reappointment). 
ORDER OF BUSINESS 
Ms. STABENOW. For the informa-
tion of Senators, at 4:30 p.m. today, the 
Senate will vote on confirmation of the 
Harper and Loyd nominations, in the 
order listed. 
NATIONAL SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAM 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, in 
1946, the National School Lunch Pro-
gram was signed into law by President 
Truman—broadly supported in a bipar-
tisan manner. And for 76 years, we have 
been providing food for our children’s 
schools so they have every opportunity 
to learn and to be successful. Over the 
years, we have added school breakfast, 
and then summer meals, and other sup-
port. 
At the beginning of COVID, we 
worked together on a bipartisan basis 
to make sure our children still had ac-
cess to healthy meals, even though 
they weren’t able to physically be in 
school. We have worked together to 
provide critical funding and flexibility 
until now. Our kids are counting on us 
to do this again. 
In 22 days—22 days—healthy meals 
for many American children will stop if 
we can’t get the bipartisan support 
necessary to extend the flexibilities 
and the funding that allows schools 
and summer programs to keep feeding 
our children healthy meals—22 days. 
Again, critical funding will stop in 22 
days. That is not very far. Summer 
programs need to be planning right 
now. And many children are already 
starting those summer programs. Crit-
ical funding is going to stop in 22 days, 
even though supply chains are still bro-
ken and costs are still rising. 
In July 2020, with bipartisan changes 
we made in the middle of the pan-
demic, almost 6 million children re-
ceived summer meals, and that was 
double the year before. This was a 
great thing for children and families 
across the country. 
During the school year, the roughly 
30 million children who participate in 
school meals knew that they could 
count on breakfast and lunch each day. 
They may not get supper, they may not 
get other food, but they could count on 
breakfast and lunch. 
These are real kids, the same as my 
grandchildren and yours, and they need 
our continued support to be healthy 
and to be successful. That is what this 
is about. They want to spend their 
summers playing with their friends and 
their school days focusing on learning, 
not just trying to ignore a headache 
and a growling tummy. 
There is a little boy in Coopersville, 
MI, who got summer meals for the first 
time because his school district could 
deliver to his neighborhood. If local 
sites can’t open or flexibility doesn’t 
happen, if these options end at the end 
of the month in just 22 days, 20 percent 
of the meal providers in Michigan will 
likely no longer be able to provide that 
healthy food in the summer. 
Kids have always been able to count 
on healthy meals at school, but next 
year is going to bring new challenges 
for children, for families, for schools. 
Take the little girl in Port Huron, 
MI, whose family is doing their very 
best to make ends meet as they recover 
from the pandemic. Over the past 2 
years, she has been able to get school 
meals without her parents and her 
school having to worry about lots and 
lots of paperwork and redtape. But 
when the flexibilities end, schools will 
be right back at it, having mounds of 
paperwork 
for 
too 
many 
families, 
which, too often, result in kids who 
need help being missed or left hungry. 
Schools may also be forced to increase 
the price of meals for children, and 
that is going to be very difficult for 
many working families. 
This lack of action is not only about 
our children, which, of course, that 
should be enough that this is about our 
children; but, too often, when we talk 
about the budgets and the programs, 
we lose sight of the people who are 
doing the work to feed our children, 
and they have to make the hard 
choices on how they are going to con-
tinue to do that. 
For example, 357,000 students get 
their meals at a school in the Miami- 
Dade school district. It is the fourth 
largest school district in the country 
serving more than 35 million meals 
each year to young people. But because 
of 
the 
uncertainty 
in 
the 
supply 
chains, Miami-Dade has struggled to 
find a single distributor to serve their 
school district. 
While this contract has since been 
addressed, many districts have not 
been so lucky, because if we go back to 
low reimbursements in the fall, they 
are finding they can’t find vendors, 
providers, that will bid for those con-
tracts. 
Issues are popping up all over the 
country. In Fort Worth, TX, kids have 
increasingly limited options for food. 
Again, supply chains have broken 
down; food supply chains have broken 
down. The school district is reporting 
over 400 options out of stock, things as 
simple as orange juice or chicken 
wings. 
In a Cleveland school nutrition pro-
gram, they have got 67 open positions 
they are trying to fill, which is the 
other issue right now coming out of the 
pandemic as we look at our labor 
shortage. 
Outside Portland, OR, school food 
staff are going to grocery stores to get 
the food and supplies they need when 
their distributor cancels their order, 
and they are paying up to 10 times 
more doing that in a retail store. 
Starting this month, kids will have 
fewer options for healthy milk and 
other dairy products when the main 
dairy 
serving 
Northern 
Virginia 
schools is going out of business. There 
are a lot of challenges. 
When Senator MCCONNELL, Leader 
MCCONNELL, said he didn’t want to ex-
tend the funding and flexibilities be-
cause the pandemic is over—the effects 
of the pandemic are not over, nor is the 
pandemic. We are managing it better. 
Thank you to the President’s leader-
ship and all of our hard work to make 
sure we have the vaccines, and the 
testing, and the therapeutic medicines, 
and so on, but the supply chains that 
broke down when you shut down an en-
tire economy—not just an American 
economy, by the way, but global econ-
omy. These are still trying to be fixed 
in so many different ways to try to get 
things up and going, which, of course, 
has led to the increased cost in infla-
tion. 
So we are in a situation where our 
schools, going into next year—not only 
this summer but next year—are going 
to have a very, very difficult time 
making sure they can provide healthy 
meals to our children, and there is no 
excuse for that to be happening if we 
come together and act. 
The fact is, we are seeing shortages 
across the board. Healthy options are 
hard to find, and there are delays for 
new equipment so schools could safely 
store prepared food. What happens 
when school food staff are faced with 
challenges like this? Kids don’t eat;

June 8, 2022 
that is what happens. And that is not 
OK. 
Nationwide, 90 percent of our schools 
and summer programs count on the 
funding and flexibility that is cur-
rently in place—90 percent of our 
schools. All of this in red, 90 percent— 
over 90 percent—count on the flexibili-
ties, they count on the funding that we 
put in place during the pandemic that 
is still needed because of the chal-
lenges going on. This is who is count-
ing on us to act to be able to help them 
feed children. 
Starting July 1, 22 days from now, 
that is going to stop for many schools. 
I have been told that if we don’t act, 
one-third of our schools will be in such 
a dire situation that they may not be 
able to continue the National School 
Lunch Program at all. Let me repeat 
that. One-third of our schools may not 
be able to provide healthy meals to our 
most at-risk children through the 
school lunch program at all if we don’t 
come together and do something to 
help them. And we know what to do. 
We just need the bipartisan support to 
do it. This is a shocking failure of our 
country’s responsibility to provide for 
our children and set them up for suc-
cess. 
Throughout the pandemic, Demo-
crats and Republicans have come to-
gether to make sure that schools and 
summer meal programs have the tools 
they need to feed hungry kids. We need 
Republicans to join us again. We are 
working to return to normal, but we 
aren’t there yet. It is so urgent that we 
pass my Support Kids Not Red Tape 
Act right now. I am extremely grateful 
that we have every Democratic Mem-
ber of the U.S. Senate and Independent 
Members and two of our Republican 
colleagues leading the way: Senator 
MURKOWSKI and Senator COLLINS. It is 
a bipartisan, broadly supported way to 
make sure our kids aren’t going hun-
gry. But time is running out, and we 
only need eight more Republican col-
leagues to join us. We have 52; we need 
8. We need eight more Republican col-
leagues to join us to be able to provide 
support for our children and support 
for our schools throughout the next 
year as we are working our way 
through all of these supply chain issues 
and so on that are getting in the way. 
Our kids are counting on us. Twenty- 
two days—twenty-two days—that is 
what we are talking about. We have 
got 22 days before all of the support, all 
of the funding to be able to make sure 
that as many children are getting 
healthy food in the summer as possible, 
the children who need it—and in the 
schools that we have a school lunch 
program and that we are able to pro-
vide healthy meals so that kids can 
focus on learning, they can focus on 
being kids, they can focus on being suc-
cessful—not just how they are going to 
manage their hunger through another 
day. 
Twenty-two days, Mr. President. Our 
kids are counting on us. We need to 
act. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
WHITEHOUSE). 
The 
Senator 
from 
Vermont. 
HONORING OUR PACT ACT OF 2021 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I rise 
today in strong support of the PACT 
legislation that we are now consid-
ering. 
As a former chair and longtime mem-
ber of the Senate Veterans’ Committee, 
one of my highest priorities is to make 
certain that every veteran in this 
country, people who have put their 
lives on the line to defend us, get the 
quality healthcare and benefits that 
they have deserved. 
This is an important piece of legisla-
tion, and I want to congratulate Sen-
ator TESTER, chair of the committee, 
and Ranking Member MORAN for their 
hard work on this. This legislation will 
improve healthcare, research, and re-
sources for veterans who were exposed 
to deadly toxic substances and environ-
mental 
hazards, 
including 
open-air 
burn pits, during their military serv-
ice. This legislation will finally recog-
nize and treat toxic exposure as a cost 
of war for the millions of veterans Con-
gress has ignored for far too long. And 
we do that by adding 23 burn pit and 
toxic exposure-related conditions to 
the VA’s list of service presumptions. 
This will mean that some 3.5 million 
veterans will now be eligible for VA 
healthcare, and that is very, very im-
portant. 
It goes without saying that in the 
wealthiest country on Earth, where we 
spend more on defense than the next 11 
nations combined, no veteran should be 
without the healthcare that they are, 
in my view, entitled to. I understand 
there is not the political support for 
this in Congress right now, but I hap-
pen to believe that in a world in which 
nation 
after 
nation 
guarantees 
healthcare to all of their people as a 
right—in fact, we are the only major 
country on Earth not to do that—that 
the very least we could do is to make 
certain that every man and woman 
who has put the uniform of the United 
States of America on, put their lives on 
the line, are, in fact, entitled to 
healthcare because they served our 
country. That is my view. This bill does 
not do that, but this bill does at least 
enroll 3.5 million more people for VA 
healthcare, and it is a step forward. 
In terms of this bill, clearly, it is un-
acceptable that we have exposed our 
military members to toxic burn pits 
and other dangerous substances on the 
battlefield. For decades, the Pentagon 
has utilized open-air burn pits to dis-
pose of a wide variety of waste, includ-
ing medical, human, and hazardous 
waste. 
Way back in 2009, when he led the 
U.S. Central Command, GEN David 
Petraeus sounded the alarm ‘‘about the 
effects of burn pits and airborne toxins 
on our servicemembers and civilians.’’ 
Despite those concerns, DOD continued 
to expose U.S. forces to burn pits, leav-
ing the VA with the responsibility of 
dealing with the consequences of these 
dangerous and deadly actions. 
So the bottom line is, I am deeply 
supportive of this legislation. It is a 
step forward. But we can significantly 
improve this bill, and that is why I 
have introduced four amendments to 
this important bill that I hope will be 
supported by the Senate. 
First, this first amendment that I 
have offered will expand permanent ac-
cess to VA healthcare to members of 
the National Guard and Reserve who 
are not otherwise eligible. Right now, 
National Guard men and women who 
are activated on Presidential orders 
are eligible for VA healthcare, and that 
is good, but that turns out to be only a 
very small percentage of people who 
are in the National Guard and Reserve. 
And I happen to believe that if you are 
in the National Guard or Reserve and 
you could be called up at any moment 
to put your life on the line, I think you 
should be entitled to VA healthcare. 
And that is what that amendment does. 
The second amendment deals with— 
what can I say—a pathetic and laugh-
able bureaucratic nightmare that cur-
rently exists in the VA. And Rube 
Goldberg would have a hard time com-
ing up with a system like this. This is 
really quite amazing. And that is, 
within the VA bureaucracy, which is 
itself difficult to overcome for many 
veterans, you have a system which now 
has over 3,000 income eligibility stand-
ards based on ZIP Codes. 
So a veteran out there watching this 
says: You know, I would like to apply 
for VA healthcare. I served my country 
honorably. How do I do it? 
Well, it turns out that, depending on 
your income and depending on the ZIP 
Code that you live in, you may or may 
not be eligible for VA healthcare. So, 
in other words, in Vermont you can 
have one veteran with an income of X 
living across the street from another 
veteran who has an income of Y, $3,000 
more or less. One veteran will be eligi-
ble for VA healthcare; another will not. 
In a large State like California, you 
have literally hundreds of different in-
come eligibility standards that vet-
erans are going to have to overcome. 
So if people go to a service officer in 
the VFW or the American Legion and 
ask: Am I eligible, it takes a lot of re-
search to determine whether you are 
eligible. Look at the eligibility stand-
ards for San Francisco versus Los An-
geles, for example. There are many, 
many thousands of dollars in differen-
tial. So you could be eligible in San 
Francisco—rather, eligible in Los An-
geles and not in San Francisco. It real-
ly makes no sense. It is a nightmare. 
This amendment simplifies it. It sim-
ply says that every State in the coun-
try takes the highest level of income 
eligibility and that is the standard. So 
you will have 50 standards rather than 
3,000 standards, and I think that will 
make it a lot easier for veterans to ac-
cess VA healthcare. 
My third amendment is a pretty sim-
ple one. It says that the VA should

June 8, 2022 
maintain a dental clinic in every State 
in the country to provide necessary 
dental services for veterans. Right 
now, there are very few States that do 
not have at least one dental clinic. My 
own State of Vermont is one of those 
States, and I think every State should 
have that. 
My fourth amendment again deals 
with the issue of dental care. One of 
the many, many crises facing the 
American 
dysfunctional 
healthcare 
system is that, by and large, we do not 
recognize 
dental 
care 
as 
being 
healthcare, and the result of that in 
the general public is there are many, 
many, many millions of people who 
cannot afford the outrageously high 
cost of dental care. These are people, 
including many seniors, who literally 
lose all of the teeth in their mouth; 
they can’t chew their food properly. 
For younger people, they can’t go out 
and get a job successfully because if 
you open your mouth and you don’t 
have any teeth in it, it is kind of hard 
to get hired under those conditions. 
Currently, out of the 8.9 million vet-
erans enrolled in VA healthcare, only 
16 percent—or 1.4 million veterans—are 
eligible for dental care, and that is be-
cause, within the VA, almost the only 
people eligible for dental care are those 
with service-connected problems. In 
other words, if you have a service-con-
nected issue with your mouth, with 
your teeth, you are eligible for VA 
healthcare, but if you don’t, if you are 
simply a veteran whose teeth are rot-
ting in his or her mouth, sorry, you are 
not eligible. 
And the limitations of that approach 
are not only that dental care should be 
considered as healthcare in general; if 
somebody is suffering with poor dental 
care, we should take care of that per-
son because it is healthcare. But there 
is no question that dental problems, 
oral problems—infections, et cetera— 
have an impact on our overall health. 
According to the VA, there are 
roughly 3.9 million veterans who have 
chronic diabetes and heart disease who 
are enrolled in the VA—3.9 million. 
Most of the veterans diagnosed with di-
abetes were exposed to Agent Orange 
during their service in the Vietnam 
war. Furthermore, the overwhelming 
healthcare consensus is that poor oral 
health worsens the symptoms of diabe-
tes and heart disease. So what that 
means in English is that you have vet-
erans out there who are struggling 
with diabetes, struggling with heart 
disease, and their problem is exacer-
bated by poor dental health, poor oral 
health; and yet they can’t get the den-
tal care they need, which not only 
should be an end in itself, but it also 
impacts their overall health. 
So, without going into great detail, I 
would say that providing dental care to 
veterans not only eases pain, not only 
addresses overall healthcare concerns, 
but it ends up being a very cost effec-
tive approach. In a 2019 report to Con-
gress on the cost of expanding dental 
care—something that I asked for—the 
VA stated—and I quote: 
. . . the provision of dental services could 
result in some reduction in total health care 
costs. 
Neglecting oral health can contribute to 
health problems including bacterial pneu-
monia, cardiovascular disease, and oral can-
cer. 
In other words, when you treat oral 
problems, you are treating overall 
health issues; and you can keep people 
healthier and not have to expend a 
whole lot of money dealing with the 
health problems of those veterans. 
During a VA briefing earlier this 
month, the VA’s office of dentistry 
stated unequivocally that ‘‘dental care 
is essential to overall health care’’ 
while simultaneously advocating to 
maintain VA’s dental eligibility status 
quo. 
The bottom line is that it is not com-
plicated; dental care is healthcare. By 
ignoring dental care, we cause other 
healthcare problems and we increase 
expenses to the VA. 
So those are the four amendments, 
and I hope the Senate will give them 
serious consideration. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, I 
want to talk today about one of the 
most disturbing human catastrophes in 
the world. Now, I have recently visited 
the Ukraine border, and I have done 
medical mission work around the world 
from Haiti to Honduras to Africa. I 
have seen malnutrition and starvation. 
I have seen trauma. I have seen the 
consequences of the lack of potable 
water and sewage. 
I describe this so when I say our 
southern border—yes, our own south-
ern border—is a humanitarian crisis, 
you know I am not speaking in igno-
rance or hyperbole. And this crisis, this 
humanitarian nightmare, has been cre-
ated by our own President’s policies. 
You see, when he was elected, he sent 
a loud invitation to the whole world; 
and more recently, when he said he was 
ending title 42, it was like turning on a 
stronger magnet. It was like sending a 
flare, a signal. It was like a giant 
Times Square billboard telling all the 
world: Come now, come to the United 
States. Amnesty is waiting for every-
one. 
As for the cartels—the people trav-
eling, they paid no mind to the court 
ruling. Instead, they kept coming. And 
as we speak, the largest caravan to 
date is on its way, with more than 
15,000 people—bigger than my home-
town of Great Bend. 
This invitation, this magnet has 
made an already treacherous, inhu-
mane situation worse. Our President is, 
indeed, inviting people to their own 
peril, to their own harrowing, life- 
threatening journey. 
Let me share with you what I saw 
just 16 days ago on my fourth visit to 
the border. 
Upon our arrival and a short drive to 
the river, we found the Border Patrol 
and our National Guard hard at work 
with some 30 migrants in line waiting 
to be processed. They had turned them-
selves in. And within moments, within 
minutes, that line was over 100 people. 
And at the front of the line were two 
beautiful young sisters, ages 7 and 9. 
They were unaccompanied—no parents 
and no families. I can only imagine 
what it would have been like traveling 
over 1,000 miles from Central America 
to the Rio Grande River without your 
parents or without a family member. I 
can only imagine what might have hap-
pened to them on that trek. 
From the river, we traveled to a de-
tention center where the migrants 
were held for 2 to 3 days. 
I have to again compliment our Bor-
der Patrol; they are doing an incredible 
job in a humanitarian crisis by pro-
viding 
showers, 
shelter, 
clothing, 
healthcare, and meals. The challenge is 
80 percent of our Border Patrol officers 
are having to function like they are 
like running a restaurant, like running 
a hotel, functioning as social workers 
while our borders are left unguarded. 
And 
the 
get-aways—we 
haven’t 
talked about the get-aways. Let me 
tell you the story of one young lady I 
met. Let’s say she was probably 17 
years of age from Central America. She 
or her family paid the cartel some 
$3,000 to get from Central America 
through Mexico across the river and 
into the United States. Now, I don’t 
know if she was raped or violated, but 
this certainly is a very common situa-
tion—all too common during this trek. 
We do know that some people in her 
group were asked to smuggle drugs 
across the border as part of their thor-
oughfare. 
Now, after crossing this treacherous 
river, she was abandoned by her coy-
ote. She was already dehydrated, had 
dysentery. She was malnourished. She 
hadn’t slept for days. And she was no 
doubt frightened. Eventually she found 
refuge at a cartel stash house on the 
Texas side of the border. Yes, now the 
cartel has cartel members living in 
America along the river and, as I later 
found out, all across America. 
Next the cartel arranged—of course, 
for a price—for her to be smuggled via 
car from a border city to a checkpoint 
some 60 miles away. Now these jour-
neys, too, are treacherous, as migrants 
are often placed in containers, in the 
backs of trucks, or in the trunks of 
cars. And when they are chased by 
sheriffs, the drivers recklessly place 
their own human cargo in peril. 
But this person wasn’t done yet. 
About 5 miles short of the checkpoint, 
the human smugglers let her out of the 
car. Then she had to walk around the 
checkpoint—probably a journey of 15 to 
20 miles—through the Texas heat, 
scrub brush, and rattlesnakes. In fact, 
many days now Texas Rangers find 
dead, decayed bodies of migrant work-
ers or migrant folks who had not made 
the trek successfully. 
So this journey around the check-
point would take 3 to 4 days. She was

given 2 days’ worth of water—a milk 
jug full of water. 
A couple miles beyond the check-
point, a new human smuggler, hired 
and coordinated by the cartel to pick 
her up, awaits. This is where I met our 
young lady. We watched as she and 
four others packed into a small car, 
and a fifth hopped in the trunk. After a 
short, high-speed chase, the car finally 
pulled over and the riders fled on foot. 
Now, most were apprehended very 
shortly, including the young lady in 
this photo. 
This is when I met the woman in the 
story for the first time. Again, she 
hadn’t had water for 2 days. Her left 
knee was swollen and painful. She had 
multiple cuts that were infected, mul-
tiple bruises, and she was semicoma-
tose, fading in and out. She had cer-
tainly heat exhaustion and was bor-
dering on a heatstroke. Now, we were 
fortunate. With some minor first aid, 
giving her hydration, cooling her down, 
she is going to make it and she is going 
to be fine. But for many making this 
treacherous journey across the south-
ern border, this story ends much more 
differently and much more tragically. 
I am asking—I am begging our Presi-
dent to turn off the magnet, to turn off 
the billboards that advertise for these 
people to risk their lives, to stop invit-
ing them to their peril and perhaps 
their death. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ROSEN). The Senator from Iowa. 
Ms. 
ERNST. 
Madam 
President, 
today, America looks like a country 
governed by teenagers who grew up 
reading ‘‘Choose Your Own Adventure’’ 
books. They got some authority and 
decided they could govern under a sys-
tem of choose-your-own-laws. But a 
government that derives its power 
from the people cannot endure if its 
laws change every few years based on 
the whims of a select few in positions 
of power. That is, after all, why John 
Adams said we are ‘‘a government of 
laws, not men.’’ 
Folks, our laws are not a buffet. You 
can’t pick and choose which ones to up-
hold and which to overlook based on 
your desires. But that is exactly what 
we are experiencing today under Demo-
cratic control. This is a political party 
that wants to rule but do so without 
following the rules. They want to 
break our institutions, rig the system 
in 
their 
favor, 
and 
fundamentally 
transform our country. 
Today, we are seeing the result of 
this radical agenda. Look no further 
than the Biden border crisis. U.S. law 
requires that immigrants be deported 
or detained pending determination if 
they don’t have a legal right to be 
here, but under this administration, 
enforcement simply no longer exists. 
In September 2019, on the campaign 
trail, Joe Biden proudly said to those 
seeking asylum in America: 
You should come. 
In March 2020, he said: 
The only deportations that will take place 
are commissions of felonies. 
President Biden knew we didn’t have 
the detention space, the enforcement 
capacity, or the administrative staff to 
follow the law, but he encouraged peo-
ple to come, and they listened. 
If the illegal immigrants who have 
entered the United States since Presi-
dent Biden took office establish a new 
city, it would be the ninth largest city 
in the country, with a population of 
1.34 million. And they are still coming. 
Just this week, we learned that what 
might be the largest caravan ever— 
nearly 15,000 migrants—is headed to 
our southern border. This is unaccept-
able and unsustainable, and it was 
completely avoidable. 
This manufactured border crisis is 
also a boon for the deadly drug cartels. 
Customs and Border Protection esti-
mates that smuggling migrants into 
the United States earns cartels up to— 
get this, folks—$6 billion a year. And in 
the first 3 months of 2022, Border Pa-
trol seized over 150 pounds of drugs on 
the southern border. Our country has 
been struggling with an opioid epi-
demic for far too long, and the Biden 
administration’s solution is an open 
border that will allow some of the 
deadliest 
drugs 
to 
be 
transported 
across 
the 
country, 
turning 
every 
State into a border State. In fact, in 
2021, more than 100,000 Americans died 
from drug overdoses—the highest num-
ber ever recorded—with opioids such as 
fentanyl responsible for 3 out of 5 of 
those deaths. Not to mention the hor-
rific abuses many young girls and 
women face at the hands of their smug-
glers. 
Folks, don’t miss this: The Biden ad-
ministration is aiding and abetting il-
legal immigration and all the criminal 
activity that comes with it. They have 
the tools in their toolbox to curb the 
flow of drugs and human trafficking 
and to stop the historic record of ille-
gal border crossings, but they refuse to 
use them. 
On his first day in office, the Presi-
dent canceled the construction of the 
barrier along our southern border, call-
ing it ‘‘a waste of money.’’ Ironically, 
his decision to not build the wall is the 
real waste of money because, while it is 
not providing any security, it is still 
costing taxpayers. Since pulling the 
plug on the project, Biden has contin-
ued paying contractors upwards of $3 
million a day—yes, you heard it right, 
folks: $3 million a day—to watch over 
the unused materials that are lying in 
the desert. Taxpayers are being billed 
to babysit piles of surplus materials. 
But some States being overrun by 
the influx of illegal immigrants would 
still like to set up barriers to control 
who is coming across the border from 
Mexico. Taxpayers have already paid 
$350 million for the concrete, the steel, 
and the fencing that is now sitting idle, 
collecting dust and dollars. Why not let 
States that want to build the wall ac-
cess these unused materials? It would 
save taxpayers money and deter the 
unprecedented number of border cross-
ings that we have seen as a result of 
Biden’s border policies—or in this case, 
lack thereof. 
To 
paraphrase 
a 
well-known 
quotation in Iowa, if you build it, they 
will come. Let’s paraphrase: If you 
don’t build it, they will come. 
Folks, America is and always has 
been a welcoming nation, but those 
seeking a better life here have an obli-
gation to respect our laws, and the 
President has a sworn duty to enforce 
them. That is why I introduced the 
Border’s Unused Idle and Lying Dor-
mant Inventory Transfer Act, or the 
BUILD IT Act, which would turn over 
the unused materials already pur-
chased by taxpayers to construct the 
southern border barrier to any State 
wishing to finish the job. 
President Biden’s refusal to secure 
our border is causing chaos and allow-
ing cartels to smuggle drugs into com-
munities in Iowa and across the coun-
try, while costing taxpayers billions of 
dollars for nothing. 
Here is a simple solution: President 
Biden, please enforce current immigra-
tion laws, curb cartel activity, and put 
these materials to use. Let’s end the 
taxpayer-funded waste, and let’s stop 
the unprecedented flow of illegal mi-
grants, and let’s build it. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, nor-
mally I don’t like to use numbers in 
speeches because I think numbers get 
lost in people’s minds as they are try-
ing to wrap their heads around num-
bers, but I do want to use some num-
bers today because the numbers are 
just so incredible. 
During President Biden’s time in of-
fice, the Department of Homeland Se-
curity has encountered illegal immi-
grants crossing our border more than 
2.8 million times. In not quite a year 
and a half, 2.8 million people were en-
countered crossing the border. Last 
month alone, they caught people try-
ing to cross the southern border ille-
gally 234,088 times. So a quarter of a 
million people just last month were 
caught trying to cross the border. That 
is the highest number in the Depart-
ment’s history. It is more than four 
times the average monthly number 
from 2018 to 2020. If you have a problem 
that is four times bigger than it was in 
the 3 preceding years, it is probably 
time to ask, what were they doing in 
those 3 preceding years that we are not 
doing now? 
Some of the people who cross the bor-
der got sent back and may have gotten 
caught later in the month. They may 
have been a catch-and-release, and 
then they come back. But some people 
who cross the border didn’t get caught 
at all. I am not sure that number is not 
bigger than the other number. But 
even if you had double-counting, it is 
still an incredible number: a quarter of 
a million people coming across the bor-
der illegally in 1 month who were 
caught—not who were coming across 
the border but who were caught coming 
across the border.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2852 
June 8, 2022 
We have never seen such a massive or 
prolonged effort by people to illegally 
enter our country as we are seeing now. 
It has created a giant humanitarian 
crisis at the border. Ask anyone who 
lives in a border community the prob-
lem that has been created by this. 
The Biden administration’s response 
has actually been to tie their own 
hands by removing the most effective 
tools we have to try to manage the sit-
uation. We developed a reasonable ap-
proach to the border based on lessons 
we learned from previous surges—one 
in 2014 when President Biden was Vice 
President and one in 2019. These poli-
cies helped cut the number of people 
trying to cross the border illegally. 
They allowed us to deal with legiti-
mate cases of people seeking asylum in 
a much more responsible way. 
People who actually qualify for asy-
lum come to the United States like 
people don’t come to any other country 
in the world. We are still the most wel-
coming country in the world for people 
who have a legitimate request for asy-
lum, but that doesn’t include every-
body who lives in a poor and dangerous 
place. 
In contrast to what we have been 
doing to make it easier for people to 
seek asylum and harder for people to 
illegally cross the border, the Biden ad-
ministration has over and over again 
reversed the progress that is being 
made. 
As Senator ERNST just well pointed 
out, on their first day, they halted the 
construction of the border wall. The 
logical debate to have there was finish 
the wall in progress and then have a 
debate with the new administration 
about whether you needed more border 
wall, but they halted construction of 
the border wall. The material was 
there. The wall was in progress. In fact, 
the wall, in some places, had been re-
moved so you could put the more effec-
tive wall up, so now there is no wall. 
There were places where we had known 
for several years now that people would 
come across if they could where there 
was no wall and there was no building 
the wall. They revoked a 2017 Execu-
tive order calling for stricter enforce-
ment of the immigration laws. They 
canceled the Migrant Protection Pro-
tocols. They suspended asylum co-
operation agreements known as safe 
third party agreements, third country 
agreements. If someone is unsafe where 
they live and has a legitimate claim 
for asylum, this is not a legitimate 
claim for entry into the United States; 
it is a legitimate claim to get to a 
safer place for them. Guatemala, Hon-
duras, and El Salvador all had agreed 
to those third party, third country 
agreements. 
Even the leaders of even Guatemala 
and Mexico said that President Biden’s 
policies are incentivizing illegal cross-
ings at our southern border, which, of 
course, create a lot of illegal transit 
through their country as well. 
Now the administration seems intent 
on ending the public health policy 
known as title 42, which allows au-
thorities to turn back many of the peo-
ple caught crossing the border ille-
gally. A Federal judge issued a prelimi-
nary injunction blocking the efforts to 
eliminate title 42, but the administra-
tion immediately decided they would 
appeal that decision. 
Now, that is exactly the wrong deci-
sion at this moment, particularly when 
the administration is arguing that we 
need billions of dollars of more money 
to fight COVID, and I think there is 
some merit to that argument, but you 
can’t argue that we need billions of 
dollars to fight COVID and COVID is 
over at the border and is no longer a 
problem there. 
In fact, just the latest example of the 
administration over and over again re-
sponding to the crisis at the border 
with the wrong decision. Time after 
time, the White House could have 
looked at problems that it was causing 
with its immigration policies and re-
verse course. And time after time, it 
responded by going ahead anyway, dou-
bling down on more than one occasion. 
According to the New York Times, 
there are tens of thousands of people 
who have been waiting in the border re-
gion for title 42 to be lifted. They are 
watching the Biden administration and 
the signals it is sending now and how it 
intends to deal with them the next 
time they cross the border. 
Most of them will be allowed to stay 
in the country while they go through 
immigration 
proceedings, 
many 
of 
which can take years to just get a 
hearing. That is why waiting in an-
other country like Mexico was a policy 
that we should have continued to im-
prove and move forward with because 
most people, when they are waiting, 
would find out that they didn’t have a 
legitimate asylum claim; that they 
weren’t going to successfully get into 
the United States and disappear into 
the country that we live in. And they 
would wind up going back and making 
it easier for other people who had a le-
gitimate asylum claim to have that 
asylum here. 
What makes it worse, the adminis-
tration has proposed taking away es-
sential resources to enforce immigra-
tion law. With the budget that they re-
quested for this year, the Department 
of Homeland Security specified cutting 
the enforcement and removal budgets 
to U.S. Immigration and Customs En-
forcement by $614 million. It doesn’t 
sound like, to me, that that is the way 
to deal with a problem that is the size 
of the problem that almost every 
American has a sense of. 
In April, the Homeland Security Sec-
retary said that he will need to repro-
gram funding from other DHS accounts 
to respond to increased activity at the 
border, while the administration—his 
administration—is asking for $614 mil-
lion in cuts. 
Other parts of the Department, like 
the Coast Guard, the Transportation 
Security Administration, the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency, could 
have their operational funding diverted 
to process paperwork for illegal immi-
grants at the border. 
The human tragedy unfolding on our 
border is due, in large part, to the poli-
cies of this administration, a massive 
turnaround that occurred on day 1 and 
hasn’t stopped since. 
We need that act—and they need to 
act on border security effectively and 
restore order to our immigration proc-
ess. 
It is long past time for the adminis-
tration people to be honest with the 
American people about the crisis it has 
created and to do something about it. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota. 
Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I 
rise today, again, regarding the need to 
secure our southern border. Right now 
there is a caravan of migrants making 
its way to Mexico through the south-
ern border. 
Media reports that it could be the 
largest caravan ever, growing to 15,000 
migrants by the time it reaches the 
U.S. border. The unprecedented and 
growing crisis at the southern border is 
due to the Biden administration’s mis-
guided immigration policies. 
This includes the lack of enforce-
ment of key tools, including the ‘‘Re-
main in Mexico’’ policy, the safe third 
country agreements, and the title 42 
public health order. 
U.S. Customs and Border Protection 
reported that in April of this year, over 
234,000 individuals were encountered at-
tempting to illegally cross the south-
ern border—234,000 in the month of 
April. 
This is an increase of 31 percent from 
April of 2021, last year, and a stag-
gering 1,268-percent increase from April 
of 2020, 2 years ago. There are 234,000 
individuals attempting to cross the 
border illegally in just 1 month—just 1 
month. 
I was recently in Del Rio and Eagle 
Pass, TX, to draw attention to the 
challenges at the border and to meet 
with the North Dakota Army National 
Guard soldiers. Our Guard members are 
providing support to Customs and Bor-
der Protection in light of the immigra-
tion crisis. 
Our 
dedicated 
CBP 
officers 
and 
agents are working tirelessly to try to 
fulfill their mission of securing the 
border, with the added pressure and 
stress of addressing the humanitarian 
crisis occurring with the continuing 
surge of migrants seeking to cross the 
border illegally. 
While they do everything they can, 
they face an impossible task that the 
Biden administration’s actions are ex-
acerbating. As I mentioned earlier, the 
current crisis at the southern border is 
the result of the Biden administra-
tion’s policies. 
Notably, the Biden administration is 
now attempting to end the use of pub-
lic health order 42—just last month. 
Those efforts failed when a Federal 
judge correctly issued an injunction 
preventing the Biden administration 
from ending title 42.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2853 
June 8, 2022 
The Federal injunction noted that re-
scinding title 42 will result in a signifi-
cant increase in illegal immigration at 
the southern border. This includes an 
anticipated tripling of illegal border 
crossings at the border, increasing 
from 7,000 per day to 18,000 per day, 
should public health order 42 end. 
At the same time, the ongoing crisis 
at the southern border is creating sig-
nificant challenges for northern border 
operations and the security of our 
northern border. Northern border per-
sonnel and resources continue to be de-
pleted because of the surge at the 
southern border. That is unacceptable. 
We need to address the ongoing crisis 
at the southern border and ensure that 
we have the resources we need at our 
northern border as well. 
Border security is vital to national 
security, and we need to secure them 
both. President Biden’s actions have 
incentivized migrants to take the dan-
gerous journey to the U.S. border. We 
need to change those policies to get the 
border crisis under control. 
That means we need to do three 
things to ensure that we have a secure 
border. We need to make sure that we 
continue the border wall, along with 
personnel and technology to make sure 
that we secure the border; we need to 
reinstate key immigration policies like 
I talked about; and we need to move to-
ward a merit-based immigration sys-
tem. 
Again, we need to enforce our Na-
tion’s immigration laws, resume con-
struction of the border wall, and ensure 
that we have in place the infrastruc-
ture, the personnel, and the technology 
to adequately secure the border. The 
Biden administration needs to take 
these steps, and they need to do it now. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, one of the dangers of having a 
weak President is that our enemies 
will be able to test the boundaries that 
used to keep them in check. They want 
to see just how far they can push it be-
fore we start pushing back. Indeed, we 
have seen that in action during this 
Presidency. 
The threat of violence, crime, and of 
the dangerous influence of those who 
do not wish us well has crept into the 
American consciousness and made an 
already stressful time in our history 
even worse. 
Now, last week’s news about what 
could be the largest migrant caravan 
yet hasn’t helped the situation. We are 
all hearing about it. At least 6,000 peo-
ple, probably 10,000 people, have set out 
from the Guatemala-Mexico border be-
cause Joe Biden invited them to come 
or so they think. That is what they 
heard. That is how they interpreted his 
actions. 
This is not up for debate. You can 
look at the reports on TV. Now, this is 
very shocking to so many of the Ten-
nesseans I am talking to every single 
day. 
First, they say this is a massive na-
tional security and safety concern. It 
makes common sense that you would 
try to stop this, but more importantly 
because they know that this President 
isn’t just abandoning the border; he is 
intentionally giving control of that 
border to international criminals, to 
cartels, to gangs, to people who do not 
wish us well. 
Now, what it appears to be is that for 
many of my Democratic colleagues and 
for this administration, this action of 
intentionally leaving the border open 
is there to keep the radical left happy. 
This is what they want, an open bor-
der policy. But that open border policy 
for terrorist organizations, fugitives, 
cartel mules, this is to them all about 
exploiting Joe Biden’s terrible choices 
and making the chaos work in their 
favor. 
They will continue to push until they 
are stopped. And right now they are 
using this to turn these cartels into 
international organizations. Last year, 
160 different countries came to that 
border. 
The drug dealers, they are all very 
happy with the way it is operating. In 
April, Customs and Border Protection 
intercepted more than 50,000 pounds of 
drugs—37 percent more than in March. 
Now, think about that, 1 month, a 37- 
percent increase. Keep in mind, this 
data only reflects what the CBP found. 
We know for a fact that every month 
the got-aways make it into the country 
undetected. And we have no clue what 
they have brought with them. Law en-
forcement officials in Tennessee have 
told me that around 80 percent of the 
drugs they seize contain fentanyl— 
fentanyl. That is what they are find-
ing. It is coming right over the border 
and coming to a community near you, 
courtesy of the Biden administration. 
We also know that business is boom-
ing for the human smugglers, and this 
caravan is about to provide them some 
excellent cover. 
Over the course of 48 hours this week, 
Border Patrol agents in the Rio Grande 
Valley sector interrupted four separate 
human smuggling attempts, and that 
included 156 different people. That is 
right, 156 people in 48 hours. 
Now, that is just one example that 
we chose to pull out and share. I have 
heard a great many advocates on the 
left accuse Republicans of blowing the 
scope of these smuggling operations 
out of proportion, but here is what I 
will say. I say that just one person fall-
ing into the hands of the cartels is a 
problem. That is one person too many 
who is being subjected to drug traf-
ficking, human trafficking, sex traf-
ficking, being forced into a gang, being 
put on a bracelet that is going to track 
them until they pay their debt to the 
cartel. 
The people locking these migrants 
into shipping containers and stash 
houses without food or water—these 
are not people on a humanitarian mis-
sion. A good outcome is not guaran-
teed, and, indeed, it is quite the oppo-
site. If the cartels guaranteed good 
outcomes, no one would be left for dead 
in the desert or die of heatstroke in an 
overcrowded truck. No one would have 
to work off their debt as a prostitute or 
a drug runner after they got here. But 
the cartels are after money. They are 
not providing humanitarian aid. So 
what do they do? They look at the 
‘‘welcome’’ mat, and they see it as a 
way to cash in. 
In 2020, the National Human Traf-
ficking Hotline reported more than 
10,000 unique cases of potential human 
trafficking in the United States. Only 6 
percent 
of 
those 
victims 
reported 
themselves as being U.S. citizens or 
legal permanent residents. That is cor-
rect—10,000 cases and only 6 percent 
were citizens or legal residents. About 
60 percent of those victims were fe-
male. More than 72 percent of them re-
vealed that they had been forced into 
prostitution or some other form of sex 
work. Eighty-four percent of those sex 
trafficking victims were female. 
This problem doesn’t begin and end 
at the border. End Slavery Tennessee 
reported that they just helped 207 po-
tential trafficking victims in 2021. 
Now, that is one organization in Middle 
Tennessee—one. 
Two 
hundred 
and 
seven trafficking victims in Middle 
Tennessee. 
You know, every town is a border 
town, every State is a border State, 
and every U.S. citizen deserves to know 
why this barbarity has gone unan-
swered by this administration. 
Remember what I said at the begin-
ning of my remarks: Our enemies are 
watching. They are paying attention. 
They are looking for loopholes. They 
are looking for ways to exploit. They 
want to see how far they can push Joe 
Biden, how far they can push this ad-
ministration, and so far, they have not 
found his limit. 
As the President and Democrat allies 
here on Capitol Hill contemplate how 
long they are willing to be pawns in 
this game our enemies are playing, I 
would advise them to just take a look 
at the data—at the data. Look at the 
reports from our own Federal and 
State Agencies. Go talk to the human 
trafficking 
organizations 
in 
your 
State. Look at the number of known 
terrorists whom our Federal Agencies 
have apprehended. Look at the drugs 
that are being seized at the borders, at 
the ports, and back in your hometowns. 
Look at the number of people Border 
Patrol has had to save from smugglers. 
And remember that you are not the 
victims here. You have the power to fix 
this. You could do something about 
this. You do not have to choose to let 
the cartels run unabated at the south-
ern border, bringing thousands upon 
thousands of people to our border. You 
might be pretending that this situation 
on the border isn’t getting worse by the 
day, but people can see with their very 
own eyes exactly what is going on. 
Tennesseans are watching. I think the 
American people are watching, and 
when it gets worse, and it will, they

will never forget that you sided with 
drug dealers and with sex traffickers 
over your own citizens. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Massachusetts. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that at a time 
to be determined by the majority lead-
er, in consultation with the Republican 
leader, the Senate proceed to executive 
session to consider Calendar No. 925, 
Alan M. Leventhal to be Ambassador 
to the Kingdom of Denmark; that there 
be 10 minutes for debate equally di-
vided in the usual form on the nomina-
tion; and that upon the use or yielding 
back of time, the Senate vote without 
intervening action or debate on the 
nomination and the Senate resume leg-
islative session. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Mississippi. 
Mr. WICKER. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object, and I cer-
tainly hope we don’t have to prolong 
this for very long, but I can report to 
Members of the Senate that there are 
Members on this side who have con-
cerns about this particular nomina-
tion. Perhaps those matters can be re-
solved in short order. I certainly under-
stand my friend from Massachusetts 
and his support for this nominee, and I 
respect that. In addition, there are 
larger issues involving actions and con-
duct of the State Department in Eu-
rope writ large that go beyond this 
nominee. Again, I hope the State De-
partment will work with us on those 
important concerns. But for those stat-
ed reasons, I do object at this point. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from Massachusetts. 
Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I 
just want to say that I appreciate the 
position of the Senator from Mis-
sissippi, but I will say this on behalf of 
Alan Leventhal: He is a favorite son of 
Massachusetts. He has left an indelible 
mark on our community, on the sur-
rounding community, and he has done 
just incredible work in his life. 
He is in a senior position at the Mas-
sachusetts Institute of Technology. He 
has worked to train the next genera-
tion of innovators and leaders. He has 
received broad accolades for his trans-
formational work as chairman of the 
board of trustees at Boston University. 
In every professional, philanthropic, 
and personal endeavor, no matter how 
big or challenging, Alan has embodied 
excellence. 
The men and women of our Foreign 
Service and locally employed staff in 
Copenhagen will have an exceptional 
advocate and an accomplished manager 
and Ambassador, and our strong ally 
Denmark will get a committed partner 
with a direct line back to Washington 
to further strengthen our bilateral re-
lationship. This is critical, as we rely 
on Denmark—a key member of NATO 
and of the European Union—to sustain 
its 
leadership 
role 
in 
defense 
of 
Ukraine in the wake of Russia’s inva-
sion. 
So I think it would be invaluable to 
have him on duty right now, especially 
at this critical time in European his-
tory. I understand the objection of the 
Senator from Mississippi, and I look 
forward to working with him and other 
Senators in order to find a route to re-
moving the objection to this extremely 
qualified candidate as Ambassador to 
Denmark. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, 
over Memorial Day weekend, I spent a 
chunk of it in Yuma, AZ. In Yuma, AZ, 
it is 107 degrees in daytime, 102 at sun-
down. Those of us from Oklahoma are 
not used to that kind of heat, but it 
was very helpful to be there, to be on 
the ground and to see what is hap-
pening at that particular border area. 
You see, each area of the border is a 
little bit different. But what we are ex-
periencing right now on our southern 
border is a continual rolling, chaotic 
crisis there. 
I have people who will catch me occa-
sionally in Oklahoma and will say: It 
seems like things are going better be-
cause I don’t hear the media talking 
about what is happening at the border 
anymore. And I will smile at them and 
say: Well, you remember last summer 
when the media was focused on the 
southern border? We had 6,000 people il-
legally crossing a day at that time. 
Now we have 8,000 people illegally 
crossing a day—8,000. In fact, last 
month, we had a quarter million people 
that illegally crossed the border in 1 
month. That was a record, by the way. 
The previous record for a 1-month ille-
gal crossing was the month before. 
Things continue to get worse. 
But each area of the border is a little 
bit different. Now I had not been to 
this 
particular 
border 
crossing 
in 
Yuma, AZ, to be able to see how things 
are different there, but this is either 
the No. 1 or No. 2 most trafficked areas 
for illegal traffic across the entire 
southern border at this point. 
What you see first when you are in 
Yuma, AZ, when you get there to the 
fencing area, you notice this: You no-
tice in Yuma, AZ, that you have got a 
port of entry there; and at that port of 
entry, you have miles and miles of bor-
der fence and then a gap in the fence, 
where on January 20, 2021, construction 
was on to be able to complete this, but 
literally, that day, it stopped. And so 
that gap has never been closed, and so 
border crossings look like this. 
Another picture of it is a picture like 
this. This scenario where there is a 
dam on the Mexico side, and on the 
American side there is the fencing—or 
at least there was going to be fencing. 
There is fencing on both sides of this. 
So individuals literally step over the 
dam, walk over and walk right up into 
the country. And you ask, well, why is 
this not complete? Is it because we ran 
out of materials? Actually, if you go 
just a mile from that last picture, in 
the desert you will see this: just stacks 
and stacks and stacks of steel, 30-foot 
sections all cut and ready to go to be 
able to close those gaps. But those gaps 
are not being closed because the Biden 
administration a year and a half ago 
determined they were not going to 
close those gaps; they were just going 
to leave them open. So there they sit 
open. 
So that is one of the issues. That is 
different in Yuma than in some of the 
other areas where they just literally 
left the steel sit horizontally in the 
desert rather than being installed 
vertically—what it was designed for. 
The second big issue is in this area 
because of those gaps in the fence, indi-
viduals, as they fly into Yuma—they 
are not coming in long caravans to 
come in—they are literally flying into 
Mexicali, Mexico, taking a charter bus 
that the cartels have organized for 
them, where they will pick them up at 
the airport, load up into a charter bus. 
They will drive them up to the gaps in 
the fence with the bus and allow them 
to be able to step across the border. 
They were literally—I could see it— 
they will literally step across the bor-
der and wait for the Border Patrol to 
come and pick them up, like it’s Uber 
XL coming to be able to pick them up 
at their spot. And they know if they 
just stand here on this side of the fence 
and wait long enough, Border Patrol 
will come by, pick them up in a van. 
They will take them to the processing 
area where they get processed and then 
within a couple of days released into 
the country wherever they want to go. 
These individuals are traveling from 
all over the world. In fact, when I met 
with some of the leadership there in 
Yuma, AZ, I just asked the question: 
How are things going? What is hap-
pening in different spots? What are you 
seeing? 
One of the folks there said: Well, last 
week—last week—we encountered peo-
ple from 50 different countries crossing 
just in this spot. 
Why is that? Because the border re-
mains open and people from all over 
the world know they can fly to 
Mexicali, Mexico, pay the cartels—and 
the current rate is between $7,000 and 
$15,000 a person for that section of the 
border. They get on the buses, drive up 
to the border, and then they step 
across. 
It is a different kind of thing. We see 
sometimes pictures of people who have 
traveled 3,000 miles in a caravan. And 
by the way, there is another caravan 
that is actually organizing through 
Central America right now and coming 
through Mexico. The current caravan 
has an estimated 6,000 people in it that 
are walking their way up and traveling 
their way up through Central America 
and Mexico right now. 
But the folks coming through Yuma, 
AZ, are not like that. They step across

the border, and they are carrying lug-
gage with them. In fact, Border Patrol 
has had to actually limit the weight 
that they can actually bring in luggage 
to no more than 50 pounds. They come 
into the process area. They are bring-
ing their luggage with them. They are 
dressed in nice clothes. They are clean. 
They just got a shower the day before. 
They come across the border. They 
wait on Border Patrol. We take them 
to the processing area. In fact, when I 
got to the processing area, one of the 
Border Patrol agents walked up to me 
and said, ‘‘Do you see the lady behind 
you?’’ And I turned around and said, 
‘‘Yes.’’ 
She said, ‘‘She is wearing a Versace 
dress.’’ 
I said that probably should mean 
something to me as a guy, but it cur-
rently doesn’t. And my wife later ex-
plained to me, ‘‘That is a pretty expen-
sive dress.’’ 
Why are we seeing people like that 
crossing the border? Because it is easi-
er to come in illegally into the country 
now than it is legally. 
Most years we have a million people 
a year that legally cross our border— 
legally—that go through the process, 
fill out the paperwork. We do a back-
ground check on those individuals. 
They come through and come into our 
country, and we celebrate people who 
come legally into our country and have 
for over two centuries. These individ-
uals are finding it faster and cheaper to 
just pay the cartel, fly to Mexico, walk 
across the border. And when you walk 
across the border, you are in the coun-
try not just for a few months. Right 
now, when you cross the border and 
enter into this area, as you walk across 
the border you are given a work permit 
and the ability to stay in the United 
States for 8 years until your asylum 
hearing comes up. 
Why do we have people coming from 
all over the world? We have a million 
people doing it legally, but last year we 
had 2 million people do it illegally be-
cause it is faster to just illegally come 
into the border. 
Let me ask a simple question to this 
body: Do we really want a system that 
incentivizes illegal activity as the en-
trance into the United States of Amer-
ica, because right now the incentive is 
to come into the country illegally? 
Let me phrase it this way. For the 
individuals who come across this bor-
der, we do not do a background check 
on these individuals. We have no idea 
any criminal history they have in the 
country from where they are coming. 
We do a background check with Amer-
ican records. We know if they com-
mitted a crime here in the past, but we 
have no idea from any of the countries 
that they are coming from. And let me 
remind you, in Yuma, when I was there 
a week ago, the week before, 50 dif-
ferent nations crossed that border that 
week. We have no criminal background 
check on any of those individuals. 
What else happens with this? Because 
of the chaos that is happening here and 
Border Patrol are having to run their 
Uber XL vans to be able to pick people 
up and take them to processing, and 
they have to come off the line to be 
able to come into the processing cen-
ter. What else is happening? The open 
desert areas not far from here, where 
they know the drug traffickers are ac-
tually 
moving 
large 
quantities 
of 
drugs, they don’t have enough agents 
to be able to patrol that anymore. 
They can see them on cameras. They 
just don’t have enough people to get to 
it. 
The checkpoints that are on the 
highways typically leading out from 
this area to try to pick up the gun and 
drug smugglers coming in and out of 
the country, those checkpoints don’t 
exist anymore. Why? Because they 
don’t have enough staff anymore be-
cause they are managing this chaos at 
the border. 
We are losing our security presence 
on our southern border because the 
President is incentivizing illegal immi-
gration, and it is taking everybody 
that is there for our national security 
to actually be on the border to manage 
the check-in staff for people coming in. 
This is a ticking time bomb. It is 
solvable. 
Let me give you just some very basic 
things on this. No. 1, keep title 42 in 
place. The Border Patrol that I speak 
to when I talk to the folks on the line, 
their No. 1 fear is the Biden adminis-
tration is going to cancel title 42. Now, 
currently, the court is prohibiting 
them from doing that, but their biggest 
concern is, if the Biden administration 
cancels title 42, even more people will 
come across, and this chaos will be 
even worse. That is their No. 1 issue. 
Keep title 42 authority in place. 
The second thing is, stop giving peo-
ple that cross the border between the 
port of entry and illegally cross, stop 
giving 
them 
work 
permits 
that 
incentivizes people to come between 
the ports of entry in an illegal fashion. 
The administration can do that right 
now. 
Third thing: Stop giving people a free 
pass to come into the country for 8 
years to stay in the country while they 
await their asylum hearing. 
Whoever is last in, first up for the 
asylum hearing, and do it right there 
at the border. The asylum hearings can 
be done in less than a month, and do it 
right there at the border so they have 
to remain in place to have their hear-
ing. 
What happens is, these individuals 
cross the border, they cross the border, 
they get their 8-year pass in the coun-
try, they get their work permit. They 
snap a picture of it. They send it to 
their family back home and say: I paid 
this cartel member this much money. I 
crossed in this spot. I stood in this line. 
When I got there, I got into the coun-
try. Come join me. And it keeps accel-
erating. That is a policy decision that 
the administration could stop now, and 
they are choosing not to stop now. 
And the final thing on this. Again, it 
is not hard. Close that gap. 
Why is this so hard? Close that gap. 
We have fewer people crossing in 
California right now than we do in 
Yuma. Why is that? Because the gap is 
closed in California. And while many of 
my colleagues scream ‘‘fences don’t 
work,’’ why do we have fewer people 
crossing in California than we do in 
Yuma, AZ? Well, it is because there is 
a functioning fence in California and a 
big, giant gap in Yuma. This does 
work, and everybody knows it. That is 
why the Biden administration leaves it 
open—because they are facilitating 
this. This is something that is going to 
bite our Nation. It is a national secu-
rity issue, and we should not ignore it. 
Again, I celebrate legal immigration. 
I want more of it in our country. This 
is unchecked, illegal activity, and we 
had better pay attention to it. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
BALDWIN). The Senator from Wyoming. 
INFLATION 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today to talk about 
another Biden crisis. We just had my 
friend and colleague from Oklahoma 
talk about the crisis, as he saw it, at 
the southern border while he was on his 
trip there very recently. We hear from 
other colleagues about the crisis of 
crime in our cities across the country 
as another failure of this administra-
tion’s. I come today to talk about the 
Biden economic crisis, which is hitting 
families in all of our States, in all of 
our communities, and it is the thing 
that I heard the very most about when 
I was home in Wyoming last week. 
Across the country, summer is al-
most here. It is time for barbecues, vis-
iting friends, and family vacations for 
many. This year, there will be many 
fewer who will be able to afford what 
has been a natural part of their family 
lives. 
The American people have just been 
through the most expensive Memorial 
Day ever, and it has been painfully ex-
pensive for families across this coun-
try. This is just a preview of the sum-
mer of stress that families are going to 
be facing all across America. Ham-
burger meat today is at its highest 
price ever; chicken, its highest price 
ever; a gallon of gasoline, its highest 
price ever. 
They say inflation is up by a certain 
percentage, but gas prices have doubled 
since Joe Biden became President. 
There has been a 100-percent increase 
in gas prices since the Democrats be-
came the majority in the Senate and 
Joe Biden was sworn into office. Gas 
prices in America, under the Demo-
crats, have gone up 15 out of 16 months 
since Joe Biden came to the White 
House and CHUCK SCHUMER came to be 
majority leader. Gas now costs more 
than $4 a gallon on average in every 
State of the Union, and we are ap-
proaching $5 on average across the 
country. In the liberal paradise of Cali-
fornia, the gas price today is over $6 a 
gallon if you can find it at that price.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2856 
June 8, 2022 
this thing recently predicted that the 
average price of a gallon of gasoline 
nationwide could be $6.20 all across the 
country this summer. 
So what do the President of the 
United States and the Democrats in 
this body have to do about that? What 
is the solution? Because people are 
looking for solutions. 
The Democrats say: We run the 
place. We are the House. We are the 
Senate. We are the White House. We 
run the place. 
Well, where are your solutions? I 
would say to those Democrats. 
Oh, Joe Biden has a solution: I think 
I will go and beg for oil from Saudi 
Arabia. I think I will go and beg for oil 
from Saudi Arabia. 
The Democratic policy on energy 
seems to be ‘‘anything but American 
energy.’’ The Biden administration has 
already been begging Venezuela, Iran, 
the OPEC cartel, and even Vladimir 
Putin to sell us more oil. We have seen 
that all in the last year. If North Korea 
had oil, I am sure the Democrats would 
go and try to beg them as well. This 
President would rather beg the Saudis 
to sell us energy than to let hard-work-
ing American energy workers get it out 
of the ground here at home. 
Now, we don’t need to go to Saudi 
Arabia. We don’t need to go to Iran. We 
don’t need to go to Venezuela. We don’t 
need to go to OPEC. We don’t need to 
go to Russia. We have it here at home 
in America, and we have an abundance 
of energy. Joe Biden is transferring the 
wealth of our Nation to the Middle 
East. Why? Because that is a decision 
by Joe Biden and the Democrats—to 
send our wealth to the Middle East 
rather than to use the wealth that we 
have here in America. 
Joe Biden has blocked off the vast 
majority of Federal lands from energy 
exploration and production. Even on 
the remaining Federal land, Joe Biden 
continues to cancel major oil and gas 
lease sales. Just last week, while Mem-
bers were home, the Biden administra-
tion, with none of us in Washington but 
all of us at home, said they are going 
to redo the environmental reviews of 
leases made by the previous adminis-
tration. Now, this includes 2,000 leases 
in my home State of Wyoming. For 
every existing energy lease, Joe Biden 
has done what he can to stop produc-
tion there. He has put 4,300 drilling per-
mits in limbo. 
What does he say about this? He said 
it in Japan. He said: We are going 
through an incredible transition. 
This is Joe Biden, the President of 
the United States. 
He said: God willing, when this is 
over, this incredible transition we are 
going through, we will be stronger and 
less reliant on fossil fuels. 
What Joe Biden is saying to every 
American is, tough luck. Take your 
medicine. Take your medicine, and pay 
the price because we are going through 
an incredible transition, and God will-
ing, when it is over, we are going to be 
stronger. 
The real transition that is happening 
today is that we are going from being 
a nation of energy dominance to being 
an energy-dependent nation. We are 
going from prosperity to poverty and 
from wealth to weakness. That is what 
we are getting from the Democrats in 
Congress, the Democrats in the Senate, 
the Democrats in the House, and Joe 
Biden. 
Today, we are still producing 1 mil-
lion barrels of oil fewer than we were 
before the pandemic. So what do Demo-
crats want to do? Once again, the Sec-
retary of the Treasury was with us yes-
terday. They want to raise taxes on the 
American public and on American en-
ergy. Well, what do you think higher 
taxes on energy production are going 
to do when oil is already at a point at 
which people are paying $5 a gallon for 
gasoline? 
For Democrats who choose to go 
home and listen to the people at home, 
I would imagine they are getting an 
earful from the people at home. 
One Democratic Member of the Sen-
ate was on TV yesterday, bragging in a 
hearing. I saw it played a number of 
times. She didn’t care how high energy 
prices went. She didn’t care at all be-
cause she had an electric car and drove 
it here, from her home to Washington, 
DC, so it didn’t matter. Oh, if you can’t 
afford to have $55,000 to buy an electric 
vehicle, too bad for you. That is the 
Democrats’ response. That is what we 
are seeing in this country which Joe 
Biden has led into crisis after crisis 
after crisis. 
High energy prices, of course, mean 
higher prices for almost everything 
else. Higher energy prices are already 
driving up food costs. For any Senator 
who went to a grocery store—and I am 
not sure how many Democrats do the 
shopping for themselves or how many 
Democrats saw how high food prices 
are, but I certainly saw it in Wyoming 
this past weekend—food prices are ris-
ing at the fastest rate in 40 years. Does 
a single Democratic Senator make ref-
erence to that? talk about it? come up 
with or try to find solutions for it? Will 
we have a solution? Joe Biden can’t 
blame Vladimir Putin for high food 
prices. The price of food has gone up 
every 
single 
month—every 
single 
month—since Joe Biden came into of-
fice. High energy prices. High food 
prices. 
There is a 40-year high of inflation in 
this country today, so inflation has 
driven the Federal Reserve to raise in-
terest rates. What does that mean? 
Well, for the seniors and retirees who 
are watching their savings and their 
retirements melt away, it means a lot. 
Interest rates have gone up, and mort-
gage applications have dropped. Many 
Americans are giving up on their 
dreams of even owning their own 
homes. 
Young mothers can’t buy or find in-
fant baby formula to buy. Joe Biden 
didn’t see it coming. People saw it 
coming, and mothers saw it coming, 
but it was ignored by the administra-
tion. Once again, they dropped the ball, 
and the President was caught by sur-
prise. Seven out of every ten stores in 
America have run out of baby formula. 
There have already been cases of chil-
dren being hospitalized because they 
can’t get the right kind of formula. 
What did the Biden administration fi-
nally say? They admitted they knew 
about the crisis last year; yet they did 
nothing. 
Month after month after month, this 
administration did nothing. That is 
kind of what we have gotten with this 
President. The President is too slow— 
too slow to react, to slow to act, and 
too slow to respond to the needs of the 
American people. No wonder they are 
nicknaming him ‘‘Too Slow Joe.’’ That 
is what we have in the White House 
today. It is a disgrace. The country de-
serves better. Americans of every back-
ground and in every stage of life are 
being punished by the bad policies of 
Joe Biden’s and the Democrats’ in Con-
gress. 
For most Americans, this is the 
worst economy they have ever seen. 
More and more Americans are having 
to borrow money just to pay the bills 
to try to keep up. Household debt is 
near an alltime high, and credit card 
day is near an alltime high. The aver-
age car in the United States is now 12 
years old. This is a record high. 
I would have to say to my colleague 
who bragged about having an electric 
car and driving it here and not caring 
about the fact that gas prices have 
gone up and was actually laughing 
about it, it seemed to me, well, you are 
different than most Americans, I would 
have to say, because most Americans 
can’t do what you do. They don’t have 
that opportunity. The average car in 
the United States is 12 years old be-
cause that is what people can afford, 
but they can hardly afford the gas to 
go in it. They can’t afford to buy a new 
car or a used car, let alone an electric 
car. 
Since Joe Biden became President, 
prices have gone up faster than wages. 
That is the complaint I continue to 
hear about at home. Month after 
month after month, the buying power 
of the average American family keeps 
going lower and lower and lower. Now 
two-thirds of the American people are 
talking about living paycheck to pay-
check with nothing left over—nothing. 
As a result, the American people are 
feeling 
stuck 
and 
stressed 
and 
squeezed. 
The pessimism of the economists is 
only exceeded by the pessimism of the 
American people about the Joe Biden 
economy. All told, Joe Biden’s eco-
nomic crisis has become a perfect 
storm of bad economic news. 
Jamie 
Dimon 
is 
the 
CEO 
of 
JPMorgan Chase. He warned of an up-
coming economic hurricane. The eco-
nomic hurricane is a perfect storm of 
record inflation, record debt, a short-
age 
of 
necessities, 
higher 
interest 
rates, vanishing savings, and a shrink-
ing economy. The Biden inflation crisis

S2857 
June 8, 2022 
is quickly spiraling into an all-around 
economic crisis. If the Democrats con-
tinue on this path, it is going to get a 
lot worse soon. 
Inflation for producers is even higher 
than inflation for consumers. In fact, 
inflation for producers has been the 
highest on record. Wholesale prices for 
producers went up 11 percent in the 
last year. That means higher prices for 
the people who grow our food, who 
build our buildings, and who keep the 
lights on. Inflation for producers today 
means inflation for consumers tomor-
row. 
After 13 months of this inflation cri-
sis—a crisis that the administration 
kept ignoring, kept denying, kept re-
fusing to admit was here, kept saying 
wasn’t coming—the Secretary of the 
Treasury said: Well, if it comes, and 
there is a small chance it comes, it will 
be manageable. 
There is no light at the end of the 
tunnel. If there is any light at the end 
of the tunnel, it is because the freight 
train marked ‘‘recession’’ is about to 
hit America. Inflation is so bad that 
the Democrats can’t even deny it any-
more. So they create it; they ignore it; 
they deny it; they blame inflation on 
everybody else. 
Yesterday, in the Finance Com-
mittee, the Secretary of the Treasury 
said: No, no. It wasn’t them. 
The Democrats denied it. They said: 
No, no. It was Putin. It was the pan-
demic. 
But now the Democrats want to 
make it worse. 
Well, it took about 14 months, but 
Janet Yellen admitted earlier this 
week in a CNN interview that she had 
been wrong about inflation. When she 
said there was a slight risk, she was 
mistaken. When she said it was man-
ageable, she was mistaken. 
She said: Now, I was wrong about the 
path inflation would take. This is the 
Secretary of the Treasury for Joe 
Biden, his handpicked person to run 
the economy. She also admitted that 
inflation was a matter of supply and 
demand and that the spending in the 
American Rescue Plan did feed the de-
mand. I think she is talking about the 
$2 trillion that every Democrat voted 
for and that every Republican voted 
against; the $2 trillion to which even 
the Democratic economists said: Don’t 
do that. It is going to make us have 
bad inflation. And we had bad infla-
tion. But Joe Biden and the Secretary 
of the Treasury and every Democrat in 
the House and Senate voted in favor of 
pouring fuel on the fire that turned 
into the inflation we are facing today. 
This was an enormous mistake on 
the part of the Democrats and the 
President—CHUCK SCHUMER and every 
Democrat in this Senate, all the Demo-
crats in the House and Speaker NANCY 
PELOSI. It is costing the average Amer-
ican family today $5,000 more this year 
than last year just to stay even—not to 
get ahead, just to stay even. 
Democrats were warned. They were 
warned by Republicans. They were 
warned by their own experts, and they 
ignored it; simply, flatly ignored the 
warnings, passed the largest spending 
bill in American history. And ever 
since that day, inflation has spiraled 
out of control. More than a year later, 
Democrats still don’t have anything to 
offer beyond blame and excuses. 
Last week, the Secretary of Com-
merce was asked: 
Is there one specific category [of high 
prices] where you think you can actually 
make a difference? 
This is her answer. She said: 
I wish. 
That is what Democrats are left 
with: wishes, wishes—no plan to fix the 
crisis that they have created. 
Joe Biden’s so-called energy inflation 
plan made so many false promises. And 
he talked about this. He wrote an edi-
torial in the Wall Street Journal. You 
would think that maybe somebody at 
the White House who wrote it would 
have been vetted before they gave it to 
the President, before he put his name 
on it. It got Four Pinocchios from the 
Washington Post which talked about 
what the President had to say about 
energy as just being a lie. 
We know what we need to do. We 
need to stop the reckless spending. We 
need to unleash American energy. In-
stead of canceling lease sales, Joe 
Biden needs to open up Federal lands 
to American energy production in-
stead. Instead of canceling pipelines, 
Joe Biden should speed up the pipeline 
permitting process. Instead of begging 
other countries to sell us oil, we should 
get it out of the ground right here in 
America. 
Oh, we have the American energy 
skills and skilled workers to see us 
through this crisis. The President just 
needs to let them go to work. 
Working families have already been 
pushed to the breaking point. People 
are spending their savings, seeing it 
melting away. They have run up credit 
cards just to get by, and now recession 
is heading toward us. We need to 
change 
course. 
The 
administration 
needs to change course because the Joe 
Biden economic hurricane is about to 
hit America. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
GUN VIOLENCE 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, yes-
terday, as chairman of the Senate Ju-
diciary Committee, I had the honor of 
welcoming a group of important guests 
to Washington. 
The committee was joined by the 
families of some of the victims in last 
month’s mass shooting in Buffalo, NY, 
when a White supremacist marched 
into the Tops Grocery store with an as-
sault rifle and massacred 10 Black 
Americans in cold blood and wounded 
three others. Just weeks after laying 
their loved ones to rest, these families 
flew to Washington to deliver one very 
simple, straightforward message to 
Congress: Do something. Do something 
to prevent the next mass shooting, to 
combat the lethal threat posed by vio-
lent White supremacists, to honor the 
memory of those who were slain in this 
horrifying act of racist violence. 
One of the family members who at-
tended yesterday was Garnell Whit-
field, Jr., and his brother Raymond. 
Their mother Ruth Whitfield was the 
eldest victim in this Buffalo shooting. 
She was 86 years old. 
In the hours before her murder, Mrs. 
Whitfield just finished her regular 
daily ritual, visiting her husband, Mr. 
Whitfield’s father, at his nursing home. 
The two had been married for 68 years, 
and in an instant, she was gone. Her 
family is shattered. 
During 
yesterday’s 
hearing, 
Mr. 
Whitfield courageously voiced what 
millions of Americans feel about the 
devastating run of mass shootings in 
America: outrage. He asked me and the 
fellow committee members there a 
really important question: 
What are you doing? You were elected to 
protect us. Is there nothing that you [can] 
personally [be] willing to do to stop the can-
cer of White supremacy and the domestic 
terrorism it inspires? 
Mr. Whitfield concluded his testi-
mony with the following words I hope 
every Member of the Senate will hear. 
He said: 
Mrs. Ruth Whitfield’s life mattered. Your 
actions here will tell us if and how much it 
mattered to you. 
We heard the same sentiment from 
across the country—from Uvalde, TX, 
to Chicago, IL. It is impossible to keep 
track of these mass shootings. They 
have claimed so many innocent lives. 
During this past weekend alone, our 
Nation was hit with at least 10 of 
them—10. Think about it: In this coun-
try, 10 in one weekend. In many coun-
tries—most 
countries 
around 
the 
world—there are none. No other devel-
oped Nation on Earth experiences this 
degree of bloody carnage every day, 
every week. And if we want to prove to 
Americans like Garnell Whitfield that 
the lives of their loved ones who were 
lost really do matter to us, we have to 
do something in the Senate. 
The first thing is simple: close the 
loopholes on the purchase of guns. Cur-
rently, there is a bipartisan group of 
Senators working on this issue. I com-
mend this group, especially Senators 
MURPHY
and CORNYN—Democrat and 
Republican—who are leading this ef-
fort. 
We are also going to hold a hearing 
next week in the Judiciary Committee 
over a phenomena which is equally em-
barrassing. Gunfire is now the leading 
cause of death for kids in America. Did 
you hear that? Gunfire, the leading 
cause of death of children in America. 
We talk about protecting our kids, 
our highest priority. Well, the guns are 
killing our kids more than auto-
mobiles, more than poison, more than 
accidents in the home. 
DOMESTIC TERRORISM 
Madam President, that brings me to 
our second obligation to families like

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2858 
June 8, 2022 
the Whitfields. It was the focus of our 
hearing yesterday. We have got to con-
demn and combat the hateful ideology 
that has inspired attacks like the mass 
shooting in Buffalo. 
During the previous administration, 
officials within the FBI and Depart-
ment of Homeland Security shared a 
sobering assessment—this was under 
the previous President, Trump. They 
found that since 2000, the year 2000, 
White supremacists have been ‘‘respon-
sible for . . . more [homicides] than 
any other domestic extremist move-
ment.’’ 
Right now, in the words of FBI Direc-
tor Wray, the threat of domestic ter-
rorism is ‘‘metastasizing across [Amer-
ica],’’ and we have seen evidence of it 
time and again. 
In the past decade alone, White su-
premacists 
have 
committed 
mass 
shootings in a church, at a Sikh 
gurdwara in the State of Wisconsin, 
synagogues, not to mention a Walmart, 
and a grocery store. 
We have seen other acts of domestic 
terrorism. This past weekend, in Wis-
consin, Madam President, a violent ex-
tremist broke into the home of a 
former judge and shot him to death. 
The murderer was found with a list of 
names that included that judge and 
other officials, including the Governor 
of your State. 
It is no coincidence that the threat of 
White supremacy is growing worse at a 
time when racist rhetoric is being 
dragged into the mainstream of our 
discourse. 
The fact is, in 2022, hate has a formi-
dable platform on FOX News. Media 
figures like Tucker Carlson are ampli-
fying false racist conspiracy theories 
like the so-called ‘‘great replacement 
theory’’ 
to 
millions 
of 
vulnerable 
Americans. 
Night after night, Tucker Carlson le-
gitimizes the fiction that his political 
opponents are scheming to deliberately 
change the demographics of America. 
It is the same racist dogma that in-
spired the resurgence of the Ku Klux 
Klan 100 years ago. They just took off 
the white robes on this gang. 
Tucker Carlson, and pundits like 
him, traffic in fear and hate. They are 
radicalizing their viewers by preying 
on paranoia and winking to the far- 
right extremists who look to them for 
leadership. 
Tragically, we have seen the growing 
use of political violence against elected 
officials, 
against 
flight 
attendants, 
against election workers, school board 
members, and other public servants. To 
make it clear, our condemnation of vi-
olence applies on the right and on the 
left. 
Just this morning, news broke that a 
man was arrested near the home of Su-
preme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. 
Carrying at least one weapon, and with 
burglary equipment, he told police he 
was planning on killing the Justice. 
Let me be clear: We have to stand 
united—Democrats, Republicans, Inde-
pendents, left and right, voters and 
nonvoters alike—in condemning vio-
lence wherever its source, right or left. 
Whether violence is being threatened 
against a sitting Supreme Court Jus-
tice or the Capitol Hill police officers 
on January 6 who wanted to defend this 
building from the insurrectionist mob, 
it is unacceptable and inexcusable. 
As the threat of domestic terrorism 
looms over the country, we must en-
sure that members of law enforcement 
have resources, training, and our sup-
port in their legitimate exercise of 
their duty. That is why we need to pass 
the Domestic Terrorism Protection 
Act. 
I put this bill on the floor in 2017. It 
ensures that the Federal Government 
will keep track of the crimes and the 
nature of them. That is it. It doesn’t 
give any new powers of investigation, 
surveillance, or arrest—simply counts 
the number of attacks and where they 
come from. 
It was the decision of the Trump ad-
ministration to remove White suprem-
acy as one of the motives for this do-
mestic terrorism at a time when the 
head of the FBI tells us that threat is 
metastasizing across America. Presi-
dent Trump was wrong. The FBI should 
be keeping track of these crimes so 
that we know the source of this vio-
lence. 
That is why this legislation is needed 
not just to pass through the Senate but 
to say to the Whitfield family in Buf-
falo, NY: We hear you. We are going to 
start by doing something very basic. 
As we watch one community after 
another torn apart by sickening acts of 
violence, the Members of this Senate 
have to go beyond thoughts and pray-
ers. If anyone in this body is unwilling 
to take even the most basic steps to 
save lives, I would encourage them to 
follow the advice that Mr. Garnell 
Whitfield offered yesterday. If you 
don’t want to take any action, ‘‘yield 
your positions of authority and influ-
ence to others that are willing to 
lead.’’ 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Hawaii. 
Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, I 
want to thank the chairman of the Ju-
diciary Committee for his remarks just 
now. I, too, sit on the Judiciary Com-
mittee, and I listened to Garnell Whit-
field talk about his 86-year-old mother, 
who was murdered, and his charge to us 
to do something, because basically he 
said: If you are not going to do some-
thing in the face of all this gun carnage 
in our country, what are you doing 
here? 
I think that is a question that each 
of us should ask: What the heck are we 
doing here if not to protect America’s 
citizens? 
One of the questions that I asked of 
the panel, which consisted of two 
invitees from the Republican side and 
three panel members of Democratic 
invitees—I asked them: Is the easy ac-
cess to guns in our country a major 
part of the gun violence and the mas-
sacres and the killings in our country? 
And they each said yes. They acknowl-
edged that the easy access to guns, re-
gardless of ideology, is what makes our 
country the outlier country among all 
developed nations. What that says to 
me is that we need to be very, very 
committed and very serious about the 
need to enact sensible gun safety legis-
lation. 
As I listened to one of my other col-
leagues a little bit earlier talking 
about inflation, yes, inflation is a prob-
lem, but certainly it is not the answer 
to just blame the Democrats. I would 
like my Republican colleagues to make 
a commitment to do what we need to 
do and at least get a start in ending 
the gun violence in our country. As I 
said at yesterday’s hearing, Hawaii has 
among the strongest gun safety legisla-
tion in the country. We have the lowest 
gun violence in the country. There is a 
cause and effect here. 
As Mr. Whitfield charged us with yes-
terday, do something. That is our re-
sponsibility. 
HONORING OUR PACT ACT OF 2021 
Madam President, turning to another 
subject, over decades of conflict, mil-
lions of American servicemembers have 
been exposed to burn pits and other 
toxic materials. These men and women 
risked their lives in service to our 
country, and we have a duty to ensure 
they get care for conditions caused by 
these toxic exposures. 
For months, my colleagues and I on 
the Veterans’ Affairs Committee have 
worked to craft a bill that meets our 
responsibility, our duty to our vet-
erans, and now we have the responsi-
bility to pass this legislation here in 
the Senate and deliver for our vet-
erans. 
This legislation is a bill named for 
SFC Heath Robinson from Ohio, who 
served tours of duty in Kosovo and 
Iraq, where he was exposed to toxic 
burn pits. A decade after returning 
home, Sergeant Robinson developed a 
rare form of lung cancer caused by his 
toxic exposure. Tragically, he passed 
away in 2020. 
The Sergeant First Class Heath Rob-
inson Honoring Our PACT Act is his-
toric, comprehensive legislation that 
provides the care toxic-exposed vet-
erans like Sergeant Robinson deserve. 
This bipartisan legislation extends VA 
healthcare eligibility to millions of 
post-9/11 veterans, including nearly 3.5 
million who were toxic-exposed. It also 
adds nearly two dozen conditions to 
the VA’s list of service presumptions 
and strengthens the VA’s ability to 
provide the high-quality care and bene-
fits these veterans need in a timely 
manner. Altogether, this bill delivers 
the historic investment in caring for 
our Nation’s veterans. 
The Honoring Our PACT Act is the 
latest step we are taking to support 
our veterans in Hawaii and across our 
country. 
Just 
yesterday, 
President 
Biden signed legislation to name the 
state-of-the-art VA clinic under con-
struction on Oahu after the late Sen-
ator Daniel Akaka. He also signed our

bill to expand access to breast cancer 
screening and treatment for veterans, 
helping ensure every VA patient can

tinue building on this progress and de-

TESTER, Ranking Member MORAN, and 
Chair MARK TAKANO in the House for 
their leadership in this effort, and I

and their loved ones who have shared 
their stories and advocated for so long 
to help us get to this moment. 
This is an important and long-over-
due step toward honoring our Nation’s 
veterans, caring for them. I urge my 
colleagues to pass this bill without 
delay. 
Madam President, I yield the floor.

f 
HONORING THE MEMORY OF THE 
VICTIMS OF THE HEINOUS AT-
TACK AT THE PULSE NIGHTCLUB 
ON JUNE 12, 2016 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, nearly 6 years ago, our State, Na-
tion, the city of Orlando, and Hispanic 
and LGBTQ communities were at-
tacked. Forty-nine innocent and beau-
tiful lives were lost. It was an evil and 
hateful act, an act of terrorism de-
signed to divide us as a nation and 
strike fear in our hearts and minds. 
But, instead, we came together, we 
supported each other, and we per-
severed. We have proved to the world 
what we in Florida already knew: Flo-
ridians are resilient. 
The days I spent in Orlando following 
the shooting will always be with me. I 
talked to parents who lost their chil-
dren. I went to funerals and wakes. I 
sat in hospital rooms. It was one of the 
hardest things I have ever had to do. It 
was heartbreaking. But in this horribly 
dark time, the selfless courage of so 
many—from community members to 
law enforcement, to healthcare work-
ers—provided a sense of hope. This in-
credible strength, love, and bravery 
lifted up Orlando and the State of Flor-
ida and helped us begin to rebuild. 
This week, on the sixth anniversary 
of this devastating tragedy, the State 
of Florida comes together to honor the 
lives lost too soon, and we vow to al-
ways stand up and fight against evil 
and hatred in this world. 
I was proud that last year Congress 
passed and the President signed into 
law legislation I introduced with Sen-
ator RUBIO and Senator PADILLA to des-
ignate the location of the Pulse night-
club in Orlando as the National Pulse 
Memorial, which will honor the mem-
ory of those we lost. 
Today, I am requesting all my col-
leagues to join Senator RUBIO and me 
to pass a resolution honoring the mem-
ory of the 49 lives lost during the hei-
nous attack at the Pulse nightclub. 
Let’s come together now to say that 
our Nation will always stand against 
hate and evil in this world. 
Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, this 
weekend will mark 6 years since 49 of 
our fellow Americans were killed in 
one of the deadliest attacks in our Na-
tion’s history. 
It was a tragic, despicable terrorist 
attack on the Hispanic and gay com-
munities 
in 
Orlando. 
Each 
person 
killed was a son or daughter, brother 
or sister, mother or father, husband or 
wife. They were part of our families 
and communities. The assault on Pulse 
was an act of pure evil that was and re-
mains the worst terror attack on U.S. 
soil since September 11, 2001. And it 
was inspired by the same ideology of 
hate. But ultimately, that hateful ide-
ology failed to tear apart our commu-
nity. 
June 12, 2016, is a day that I will 
never forget. The senseless, tragic loss 
of life will never dull with time, nor 
will the memory of how our commu-
nities came together in the days and 
weeks that followed. Pulse was a well- 
known nightclub in central Florida. It 
was part of the fabric of the local com-
munity, and that awful day struck a 
terrible blow. But the community 
awoke from the tragedy stronger and 
more united than it was before. 
The terrorist would have been horri-
fied to see the First Baptist Church in 
Orlando—another pillar of the local 
community—opening its doors to the 
LGBT community, welcoming them 
and their families, and holding services 
there. The terrorist would have hated 
to see Floridians from all across the 
State bringing food and water to sup-
port victims, families, and first re-
sponders. There were unending lines to 
donate blood. There were memorial 
services around the State. There was a 
sense that there was something greater 
than any one person worth sacrificing 
for; there was a sense of community, 
fellowship, and solidarity. This is the 
America I know and love, and it is our 
country at its best. 
Sunday will be a day for reflection, 
for remembering those who lost their 
lives to an evil, hateful ideology. It 
will also be a day to acknowledge the 
tremendous impact their families and 
the survivors have had, not only on 
their community and State, but on our 
Nation. 
And while the fight against evil and 
hate continues, we can and should take 
inspiration from their strength.

GUN SAFETY 
Mr. 
CORNYN. 
Madam 
President, 
when the Senate considers complex and 
profound issues of public policy, I am 
particularly reminded of the wisdom of 
our late friend, Mr. Mike Enzi, the Sen-
ator from Wyoming. Not long after I 
came to the Senate, I noticed how pro-
ductive that Senator Enzi, one of the 
most conservative Members of the Sen-
ate, was working on the Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions committee 
with Teddy Kennedy, the ‘‘liberal lion 
of the Senate.’’ You had one of the 
most conservative Members of the Sen-
ate working with one of the most lib-
eral Members of the Senate. But, amaz-
ingly, to me, they seemed to get a lot 
done. 
So I asked Senator Enzi, I said: How 
is it that you, a staunch conservative, 
could work so productively with some-
body with such different views? Sen-
ator Enzi told me: It is easy. I call it 
the 80–20 rule. 
Well, the fact of life is we are not 
going to agree with everybody 100 per-
cent of the time. And I sometimes say 
I don’t agree with my wife 100 percent 
of the time, but she is always right. 
But, seriously, if we are going to get 
things done here in the U.S. Senate for 
the benefit of the American people, we 
have to understand nobody is going to 
get everything they want. And I think 
for purposes of simplicity, an illustra-
tion of Senator Enzi’s comments about 
the 80–20 rule are very helpful. 
I have tried to employ that strategy 
many times since those days, and I 
hope we can apply that wisdom and 
strategy again dealing with this recent 
string of shootings, including Uvalde, 
TX. 
Now this debate evokes strong emo-
tions and strong opinions from people 
across the political spectrum, and it is 
an understatement to say that there 
are serious differences of opinion. 
I start with the premise that I took 
an oath to uphold and defend the Con-
stitution of the United States, and I

June 8, 2022 
have no intention of violating that 
oath. That is where I start. Part of the 
Constitution is the amendments, in-
cluding the first 10 which are the Bill 
of Rights that includes the Second 
Amendment, which provides a con-
stitutional right to keep and bear arms 
for law-abiding Americans. I have no 
intention of violating my oath, and I 
have no intention of undermining the 
rights of law-abiding gun owners in 
America because it is a constitutional 
right. 
It is no secret that when it comes to 
the culture in America, there are very 
different views ranging from, let’s say, 
Connecticut, where Senator MURPHY 
comes from, to places like Texas, 
where guns are commonplace but peo-
ple know how to use them and they use 
them responsibly and they are not a 
threat to public safety. 
There are those who would like to re-
strict the rights of law-abiding gun 
owners because that is their view— 
they strongly hold that view, but I 
have been clear that is a nonstarter for 
me. 
But to Senator Enzi’s wise advice, 
rather than focus on the 20 percent we 
can’t agree on, I have been trying to 
explore common ground with our col-
leagues on a bipartisan basis. These 
were devastating tragedies. We all 
agree with that. We all agree that no 
child should ever fear for his or her 
safety while sitting in a classroom. 
I think we even all agree that there 
is a mental health epidemic in America 
today, and that is a piece of the puzzle. 
To me the shootings are a symptom of 
a larger problem, which is the failure 
of our mental health system in Amer-
ica, and it manifests itself in many dif-
ferent ways. Now, people suffering from 
mental health challenges, by and large, 
they are not violent, but a subset of 
them threaten their own lives with sui-
cide. Some of them, even a subset of 
others, not only commit suicide by at-
tacking a known armed police contin-
gent, but they also engage in homi-
cides, too, which is what happened with 
Salvador Ramos in Uvalde, TX. 
I think there is a consensus in Amer-
ica that criminals and people experi-
encing severe mental health crises 
should not have access to guns. It is 
not just my opinion; it is actually the 
law. That is what the National Instant 
Criminal Background Check System is 
supposed to vet for—to make sure that 
people who have criminal records, peo-
ple who have been institutionalized for 
mental health problems, people who 
are dishonorably discharged, people 
who are under a protective order, peo-
ple who have committed felonies, peo-
ple who have committed domestic vio-
lence, those are all people who now, if 
you went to buy a firearm and under-
went a national instant criminal back-
ground check, you would not be able to 
legally purchase or possess a firearm 
because that is the law of the land and 
has been a long time. 
With that in mind, Senator MURPHY 
from Connecticut, Senator TILLIS from 
North Carolina, Senator SINEMA from 
Arizona, and I have been looking at 
these various factors and tried to come 
up with a targeted bill that might have 
prevented some of these tragedies. To 
me, that is the best way to look at 
this, is to say: If this had been in place, 
is it less likely that this tragedy would 
have occurred? Stated another way, If 
we do this, is there a chance or a prob-
ability that we could save lives in the 
future? To me, that should be our 
focus. 
Instead 
of 
wasting 
time 
talking 
about what we don’t agree on, I think 
it is productive for us to focus on this 
subset of issues where I believe there is 
room for a consensus because, of 
course, that is the only way to make 
progress and to get a result. 
When the Constitution was written, 
it created three branches of govern-
ment; but in particular, the legislative 
and the executive branch, with two 
branches of the Congress. They are 
very different in their nature. They 
made it difficult to pass legislation. It 
is hard. We do it, but it is hard. And it 
is hard because it takes consensus, and 
consensus sometimes takes time, par-
ticularly on issues that evoke such 
strong views and opinions and reflect, 
frankly, the diversity of this country. 
I am glad to say, on this topic, we are 
making steady progress. It is early in 
the process, but I am optimistic where 
things stand right now. What am I op-
timistic about? I am optimistic that we 
could pass a bill in the Senate, it can 
pass the House, and it will get a signa-
ture by President Biden. It will become 
law of the land. 
What is the test of that legislation? 
It is, to me, not whether it meets your 
ideological standard of what the bill 
should look like, but it is simply this: 
Will it save lives? If it will, it is worth 
all of our best efforts. 
As I said, there is broad agreement 
about the mental health challenges, 
not only in our schools, but in our soci-
ety at large and how that manifests 
itself. Sixty percent of the gun deaths 
in America are suicides. Don’t we want 
to try to prevent those suicides? I 
think so. That is why the mental 
health issue is so important, among 
other reasons. And then, obviously, the 
school safety issues. We need to try to 
figure out ways to make our schools 
harder to get into for people like Sal-
vador Ramos. 
Unfortunately, the mental health 
challenges of young, disaffected, and 
alienated boys is a profile that is all 
too familiar. It is reflected in the 
shooter in Uvalde. It is reflected in the 
shooter in Sandy Hook, Adam Lanza. 
They came from much different places 
in terms of their socioeconomics, but 
in terms of their alienation and their 
developing mental illness and their 
willingness to not only take their own 
life but other people’s lives, unfortu-
nately, it paints an eerily similar pic-
ture. 
The shooter in Uvalde was isolated 
and bullied at school. He had a record 
of cutting his face—self-mutilation— 
and abusing and torturing animals, and 
he was known for fighting and threat-
ening his fellow students with every-
thing from assault to rape. He was a 
ticking time bomb, and many people— 
not all the people but many people in 
this small community of 15,000 people 
knew it. Certainly, his mother knew it. 
Unfortunately, his mother was a drug 
user, and he was living with his grand-
mother. But this is a young man who 
shot his own grandmother because she 
wanted him to go back to school be-
cause, of course, he had been out of the 
classroom because of COVID–19 restric-
tions. Frankly, that isolation just 
made his mental illness that much 
worse. 
As I said, the shooter at Sandy Hook, 
Adam Lanza, experienced what was 
later described as ‘‘severe and deterio-
rating’’ mental health problems that 
went untreated, not because his par-
ents didn’t try—they did—but when he 
was prescribed medication to help him 
manage his mental illness, he refused 
to take it, and his mom finally gave 
up, exhausted, as you can imagine. It 
was a period of 3 years that he didn’t 
see any mental health provider at all, 
sitting in his room, playing video 
games, killing people online virtually, 
becoming 
increasingly 
desensitized, 
and spiraling down that psychiatric, 
psychological, and emotional drain. 
We need to equip all of our young 
people in America with the resources 
and the assistance they need in order 
to manage their emotional and mental 
health struggles. I think that is part of 
what we need to do. 
School security, as I said, was also a 
glaring issue at Uvalde. The shooter 
was able to enter Robb Elementary 
School through a door that wasn’t even 
locked. That is a problem. School dis-
tricts need to be prepared for the 
worst-case scenario. They need to pre-
pare for the worst and hope for the 
best. That means evaluating physical 
security, reviewing current protocols, 
developing best practices, and poten-
tially adding or expanding the number 
of school resource officers. Those are 
law enforcement officers on campus. 
I think there is a lot of common 
ground on things we can agree on 
here—safer 
schools, 
better 
mental 
health resources, and coming up with 
additional assistance that will harden 
our schools and provide greater deter-
rence and protections for our students. 
The Senators whom I have been talk-
ing to—including the group of four but 
even the larger group today at noon— 
we have been talking about other 
things we might do to keep individuals 
who are already prohibited by law be-
cause they have a criminal background 
or they have mental health adjudica-
tions and problems. 
How do we keep guns out of the 
hands of criminals and those who are 
undergoing mental health crises? That 
is an area of common ground. This is 
not about creating new restrictions on

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2861 
June 8, 2022 
law-abiding citizens; it is about ensur-
ing the system we already have in 
place works as intended. 
One idea we have discussed is, be-
cause this young man in Uvalde turned 
18 and because there was no look back 
at his juvenile record, he passed a 
background check. It is as if he was 
born on his 18th birthday and nothing 
that happened before was important. 
That is obviously a problem. So we are 
looking at taking steps to encourage 
States to upload juvenile records into 
the National Instant Criminal Back-
ground Check System. This is standard 
practice in some but not most States, 
and it is easy to see why it is impor-
tant. If we are uploading information 
about adults’ mental health adjudica-
tions but we don’t have access to juve-
niles’ mental health adjudications, to 
me, that is a problem. If a 17-year-old, 
for example, is convicted of aggravated 
assault, the record should show up in 
his background check if he tries to pur-
chase a gun when he turns 18. 
I think this is a commonsense way to 
make sure the National Instant Crimi-
nal Background Check databases are 
complete and they are accurate. That 
is not about expanding the system; 
that is about making sure the system 
we have actually works. 
I want to make sure that we are com-
mitted to providing due process protec-
tions for citizens in all circumstances. 
Again, this is part of our Constitution, 
due process of law—the right to appear, 
the right to contest a decision by the 
government and to produce evidence 
and to cross-examine witnesses. That is 
an essential aspect of due process. 
When you talk about depriving some-
body of a constitutional right, it is 
even more important. 
The goal here is to make a law; it is 
not to make a political statement. As I 
said, I am encouraged by the progress 
we are making, but I don’t think artifi-
cial deadlines are useful. The majority 
leader, Senator SCHUMER, has threat-
ened to schedule votes if an agreement 
isn’t reached by a certain time. I don’t 
think that is particularly helpful. 
Again, my goal and I think most Sen-
ators’ goal here is to come up with a 
bill that can pass; otherwise, we might 
as well move on to other topics. But I 
sense a feeling of urgency and a desire 
to actually get things done. Around 
here, if you know people have the will, 
there is a way, and I believe there is a 
collective bipartisan will. So far, ev-
erybody, I believe, has been working in 
good faith. We all understand the dif-
ferences that we have regionally and 
culturally when it comes to things like 
the Second Amendment. We under-
stand the different politics in different 
States. That is the genius of the Sen-
ate that brings us all together. It 
doesn’t make it easy, but it makes it 
possible for us to try to find some com-
mon ground. 
The most common cry you hear 
today when it comes to incidents like 
Uvalde is to do something. I think we 
agree with that, but what that some-
thing is is not easy, but it is impor-
tant, and we need to try. Again, I am 
optimistic because of the progress we 
have made so far that we will do some-
thing here that is important that will 
save lives. To me, that is the goal. And 
I think all 100 Senators would agree, if 
we can achieve that goal, then our ef-
forts will have been worthwhile.

On May 26, 2022, I missed rollcall vote 
No. 210, motion to invoke cloture on 
the Motion to Proceed to H.R. 350, a

terrorism offices within the Depart-

As recent, unthinkably tragic events 
at a grocery store in Buffalo, NY, a 
Taiwanese church in Laguna Woods, 
CA, and now an elementary school in 
Uvalde, TX, have shown, we need to be 
doing much more to protect our fellow 
Americans. Every man, woman, and 
child has the fundamental human right 
to live their life; to be and feel safe in 
their classrooms, house of worship, and 
within their communities. White su-
premacy and gun violence are crises 
that are plaguing our Nation, and inac-
tion is unacceptable. I am disappointed 
that the Senate failed to advance this 
important legislation, and I will con-
tinue working to pass it in the future.

NATIONAL SEERSUCKER DAY 
Mr. 
CASSIDY. 
Madam 
President, 
today I rise in recognition of seer-
sucker manufacturers and enthusiasts 
across the United States. I wish every-
one a Happy National Seersucker Day. 
This uniquely American fashion has a 
storied history dating back to 1909. The 
first seersucker suit was designed by 
Joseph Haspel at his Broad Street fa-
cility in New Orleans, LA. Louisiana is 
proud to have played an important part 
in introducing the country to seer-
sucker apparel. 
This 
lightweight 
cotton 
fabric, 
known for its signature pucker, has 
been worn and enjoyed by Americans 
across the country during the hot sum-
mer months. Mr. Haspel said it best: 
‘‘Hot is hot, no matter what you do for 
a living.’’ 
In the 1990s, Seersucker Day was es-
tablished by Members of this Chamber 
to honor this unique American fashion. 
I proudly resumed this tradition in 2014 
in the U.S. House of Representatives 
and continued this tradition in the 
U.S. Senate. This year, I wish to des-
ignate Thursday, June 9, 2022, as the 
ninth annual National Seersucker Day. 
I encourage everyone to wear seer-
sucker on this day to commemorate 
this traditionally American clothing.

NAWBO—provides dynamic opportuni-
ties for women to network with other 
business owners, mentor one another, 
develop partnerships, and incubate and 
foster that next big idea. It is com-
posed of women of all ages and levels of 
experience from all sectors of the mar-
ketplace. 
This year, as NAWBO Kentucky con-
tinues to celebrate three decades of 
success stories that are as diverse as 
our Commonwealth, its members have 
established a series of awards to recog-

excelled. These include the Woman 
Business Owner of the Year, the Next- 
Gen Women Business Owner of the 
Year, the Public Policy Catalyst of the 
Year, NAWBO Corporate Partner of the

Thomas Coffee, was named the Woman 
Business Owner of the Year. FTC 
opened in March of 2019 and will expand 
in June of 2022, to include a wine and 
cocktail bar and a business center. 
Christine’s husband Justin and their 
two children Kaelan and Cadence have 
been embraced by their community as 
‘‘The Hot Chocolate House,’’ by serving 
hot chocolate instead of candy to their 
neighbors on Halloween. To this day, 
trick-or-treaters 
will 
make 
plans 
weeks ahead to visit the Smalley 
household and it delights the family to 
no end.

PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS 
The following petitions and memo-
rials were laid before the Senate and 
were referred or ordered to lie on the 
table as indicated: 
POM–141. A resolution adopted by the 
House of Representatives of the State of 
Michigan urging the United States Congress, 
federal agencies, and state departments to 
address the ongoing fertilizer price increases 
and shortages that are impacting Michigan 
farmers; to the Committee on Agriculture, 
Nutrition, and Forestry. 
HOUSE RESOLUTION NO. 205 
Whereas, Michigan’s agricultural industry 
is vitally important to the state economy. 
As our nation’s second most diverse agricul-
tural system, it contributes more than $104.7 
billion in economic activity annually to the 
state. More than 800,000 people work in 
Michigan’s agricultural industry, and care 
for nearly 10 million acres of land; and 
Whereas, Fertilizer is a critical agricul-
tural input that is utilized by farmers to pro-
vide nutrients to their land and maximize 
the productivity of their farms. It is essen-
tial that Michigan’s farmers have access to 
fertilizers so they can nourish their land and 
maintain production levels; and 
Whereas, Fertilizer prices in the United 
States have dramatically increased over the 
past decade. While the increase in prices can

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2864 
June 8, 2022 
be attributed to several factors, such as 
strong demand for fertilizer and rising costs 
of raw materials, the recent decision by the 
United States Department of Commerce to 
impose tariffs on imports of phosphate-based 
fertilizers from Morocco and other countries 
has significantly increased fertilizer prices. 
These tariffs were implemented in 2021 after 
the U.S. International Trade Commission 
(ITC) determined that the import of foreign 
phosphatic fertilizers injured U.S. manufac-
turers; and 
Whereas, These tariffs place a substantial 
burden on farmers who are unable to com-
pete with rising costs of production. Addi-
tionally. due to the highly consolidated 
structure of the U.S. fertilizer manufacturer 
industry, many farmers have little bar-
gaining power with suppliers. For example, 
one company controls an estimated 90 per-
cent of the U.S. phosphate fertilizer produc-
tion while another controls nearly half of 
U.S. urea fertilizer production. This highly 
concentrated structure has resulted in local 
input dealers having very little bargaining 
power with the manufacturers. and cost in-
creases are inevitably passed on to farmers; 
and 
Whereas, Michigan farmers are facing the 
greatest increase in fertilizer prices in 13 
years. Without access to fertilizer, Michi-
gan’s agricultural production will fall, and 
the state’s economy will suffer. Not only will 
farmers be directly impacted, but the broad-
er supply chain will also suffer: now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives, 
That we urge the U.S. Congress, federal 
agencies, and state departments to address 
the ongoing fertilizer price increases and 
shortages that are impacting Michigan farm-
ers; and be it further 
Resolved, That copies of this resolution be 
transmitted to the President of the United 
States Senate, the Speaker of the United 
States House of Representatives, the mem-
bers of the Michigan congressional delega-
tion, the U.S. Secretary of Commerce, the 
U.S. Secretary of Agriculture, the commis-
sioners of the U.S. International Trade Com-
mission, and the Director of the Michigan 
Department of Agriculture and Rural Devel-
opment. 
POM–142. A concurrent resolution adopted 
by the Legislature of the State of Louisiana 
urging the President of the United States 
and the United States Congress to take any 
action necessary to halt federal actions re-
sulting in the delay or cancellation of off-
shore oil and natural gas lease sales, and 
urging the United States Department of In-
terior to expedite actions necessary to com-
ply with a court order to resolve lease sales, 
finalize a new five-year plan for oil and gas 
leasing on the Outer Continental Shelf, and 
focus efforts on lease sales in the Gulf of 
Mexico; to the Committee on Energy and 
Natural Resources. 
SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 12 
Whereas, the Gulf of Mexico produces ap-
proximately seventeen percent of the United 
States crude oil and five percent of United 
States natural gas while contributing five to 
eight billion dollars to the federal treasury 
each year and sending hundreds of millions 
of dollars to coastal states for coastal res-
toration and hurricane protection projects; 
and 
Whereas, the oil and gas industry directly 
supports two hundred forty-nine thousand 
eight hundred jobs in Louisiana; and 
Whereas, the oil and gas industry activi-
ties represent twenty-six percent of Louisi-
ana’s gross domestic product, accounting for 
nearly four billion five hundred million dol-
lars in state and local tax revenue in 2019 
alone, representing fourteen and one-half 
percent of total state taxes, licenses, and 
fees collected; and 
Whereas, according to the Bureau of Ocean 
Energy Management, which regulates off-
shore lease sales, the Gulf continues to be 
the nation’s primary offshore source of oil 
and gas, generating about ninety-seven per-
cent of all United States Outer Continental 
Shelf oil and gas production and since 2017, 
Gulf of Mexico lease sales have generated 
more than one trillion dollars from offshore 
leasing; and 
Whereas, since 1953, the United States Sec-
retary of the Interior has been required by 
law to prepare a five-year plan to set a 
schedule for oil and gas leases in United 
States offshore waters based on a lengthy, 
multi-year regulatory process with multiple 
stages for public comment, input, and con-
sultation; and 
Whereas, the Obama administration issued 
a five-year-plan for oil and gas leasing that 
expires on July 1, 2022, which includes two 
remaining lease sales for the Gulf of Mexico, 
Lease Sale 259 and Lease Sale 261; and 
Whereas, the United States Department of 
Interior missed the deadline to issue a notice 
of sale for Gulf of Mexico Lease Sale 259 in 
order to meet the expiration of the current 
five-year plan; and 
Whereas, on January 27, 2021, President 
Biden signed Executive Order 14008, ‘‘Tack-
ling the Climate Crisis’’ declaring a pause on 
leasing on federal lands and waters, includ-
ing the Outer Continental Shelf of the Gulf 
of Mexico; and 
Whereas, the United States District Court 
issued a preliminary injunction on the leas-
ing pause and ordered federal oil and gas 
lease sales to proceed on June 15, 2021; and 
Whereas, the Department of Interior held 
Lease Sale 257 on November 17, 2021; how-
ever, on January 27, 2022, a ruling by the 
United States District Court for the District 
of Columbia invalidated the sale and re-
quired the Department of Interior to reassess 
the environmental impacts of Lease Sale 257; 
and 
Whereas, the Department of Interior is not 
appealing the court ruling and therefore 
there is no indication that leases will be 
awarded to the offshore companies from 
Lease Sale 257; and 
Whereas, there is no indication that the 
federal government will hold another Gulf of 
Mexico offshore lease sale for the duration of 
the Biden administration’s term and there is 
no indication that the Department of Inte-
rior is working on the next five-year plan; 
and 
Whereas, according to the most recent fed-
eral data, although U.S. crude output fell 
slightly with a drop of nearly thirteen and 
one-half percent in offshore Gulf of Mexico 
production from December 2019 through De-
cember 2021, the demand for oil climbed nine 
and four-fifth percent from a year earlier; 
and 
Whereas, oil and gas production in the Gulf 
of Mexico is the only reliable source of fund-
ing for Louisiana’s coastal programs such as 
the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act that 
allows the Gulf states to share in offshore 
revenue generated from offshore oil activity 
including bonus bid revenue; and 
Whereas, over the past five years Lou-
isiana approximately has received between 
one hundred sixty million dollars and four 
hundred seven million dollars from bonus 
bids alone; and 
Whereas, it is estimated that in 2021 the 
state of Louisiana lost approximately twen-
ty to forty million dollars due to the can-
celled lease sales and lost bonus bid revenue; 
and 
Whereas, Louisiana depends on Gulf of 
Mexico Energy Security Act revenues to 
fund a fifty billion dollar coastal restoration 
plan; and 
Whereas, delaying or cancelling Gulf of 
Mexico leasing negatively impacts federal 
and state revenue, as well as Louisiana busi-
nesses and jobs; and 
Whereas, drilling contractors will see im-
pacts, dropping as many as twenty-five per-
cent of the remaining Gulf of Mexico rigs 
over the next several years, in addition to 
the network of staff, supply boats, and other 
vendors that support and maintain drillships 
that equates to roughly one thousand jobs 
per rig; and 
Whereas, the Gulf of Mexico is the safest 
and cleanest oil produced anywhere in the 
world; and 
Whereas, halting domestic energy develop-
ment in one of the lowest carbon intensive 
energy producing regions in the world to 
shift production and capital investment 
overseas undermines decades of environ-
mental progress; and 
Whereas, a 2016 Obama administration 
study conducted by Bureau of Ocean Energy 
Management 
concluded 
that 
America’s 
greenhouse gas emissions will be little af-
fected by leasing decisions on the bureau’s 
offshore leasing program and could in fact 
result in an increase of greenhouse gas emis-
sions in the absence of new Outer Conti-
nental Shelf leasing due to an increase in im-
porting foreign oil; and 
Whereas, the Biden administration is pur-
suing a policy which places the United 
States at the mercy of the Organization of 
Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia 
to meet domestic needs and harming na-
tional and economic security. Therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana 
does hereby urge and request the President 
of the United States and Congress of the 
United States to take any action necessary 
to halt federal actions resulting in the delay 
or cancellation of offshore oil and natural 
gas lease sales. Be it further 
Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana 
does hereby urge and request the United 
States Department of Interior to expedite 
any actions necessary to comply with United 
States District Court for the District of Co-
lumbia order to resolve Lease Sale 257, final-
ize a new five-year plan for oil and gas leas-
ing on the outer continental shelf, and focus 
all efforts on mandated lease sales in the 
Gulf of Mexico. Be it further 
Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be 
transmitted to the President of the United 
States, the United States Secretary of the 
Interior, the United States Secretary of En-
ergy, the Federal Energy Regulatory Com-
mission, the White House National Climate 
Advisor, the clerk of the United States 
House of Representatives, the secretary of 
the United States Senate, and to each mem-
ber of the Louisiana delegation of the United 
States Congress. 
POM–143. A resolution from the House of 
Representatives of the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico requesting that the government 
of the United States to grant a partial ex-
emption from the application of the Coast-
wise Laws to the maritime transportation of 
crude oil and petroleum products between 
the United States and Puerto Rico for the 
duration of the armed conflict between 
Ukraine and Russia and the collateral effects 
thereof; to the Committee on Commerce, 
Science, and Transportation. 
HOUSE RESOLUTION NO. 718 
The implementation of the so-called Coast-
wise Laws in Puerto Rico began with the ap-
proval of the Organic Act of 1900, known as 
the Foraker Act. The Jones Act was subse-
quently approved in 1917 which, among other

things, maintained the effectiveness of the 
coastwise laws until the present day. The 
Jones Act was enacted at a historical junc-
ture which posed certain challenges to the 
United States of America that are no longer 
a concern. As a result, maritime transpor-
tation from U.S. ports to the Island may 
only be provided by U.S.-built, -owned and 
-crewed vessels. Thus, the U.S. Congress en-
acted legislation providing that, in order to 
move goods between the United States of 
America and Puerto Rico, vessels should not 
only be built in the United States but must 
also be owned and operated by U.S. citizens. 
This federal legislation also applies to Guam 
and the states of Alaska and Hawaii. The 
territory of American Samoa, the Common-
wealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and 
the U.S. Virgin Islands, however, are exempt 
from the Jones Act. 
With regard to maritime transportation, 
on March 14, 2013, the U.S. Government Ac-
countability Office, commonly known as 
GAO, issued a report stating that the Jones 
Act may result in higher freight rates, par-
ticularly for certain goods, than would be 
the case if service by foreign carriers were 
allowed. Likewise, the conclusions of the re-
port state that the original goal of the Act 
remains important to military preparedness 
and to the shipbuilding and maritime indus-
tries, but understanding the full extent and 
distribution of the costs that underlie these 
benefits is elusive. 
It is a well-known fact that Puerto Rico is 
facing difficult economic challenges that 
have worsened with the passage of hurri-
canes Irma and Maria, the earthquakes of 
January 2020, inflation, the ongoing COVID– 
19 emergency, and more recently, the cost of 
fuel, factors that are out of the government 
and the consumer’s control. That is, the ris-
ing oil prices coupled with the effects of in-
flation and the emergencies have steadily in-
creased the prices of food, transportation, 
and electricity, thus adversely affecting con-
sumer and business spending. 
In addition to global security concerns, the 
war between Russia and Ukraine has re-
sulted in a shortage of consumer goods and 
pushed oil prices above $125 per barrel, after 
having remained steady between $80.00 and 
$90.00 for a considerable time. Should this 
war continue and no agreement be reached, 
it might lead to a crude oil shortage in Eu-
rope, which would have repercussions on the 
global market, such as even higher prices. 
There is concern due to the fact that there is 
no indication as to whether the price of 
crude oil, goods, and transportation shall 
stabilize any time soon. On the contrary, 
projections show that rising costs and insta-
bility shall persist. 
In spite of our efforts to transform electric 
power generation in Puerto Rico, our system 
still relies primarily on crude oil and petro-
leum products. Likewise, most individual, 
mass transit, and freight motor vehicles on 
the Island run on gasoline or diesel. There-
fore, granting Puerto Rico a partial exemp-
tion from the Jones Act is necessary to pre-
vent future electricity rate increases, miti-
gate the rising costs of gasoline, diesel, 
transportation, as well as the potential 
shortage of crude oil in Europe. 
For all of the foregoing, the House of Rep-
resentatives of the Commonwealth of Puerto 
Rico deems it necessary to take action in 
order to mitigate the multiplier effect that 
crude oil price fluctuations are having on the 
economy, by requesting the President of the 
United States of America and his govern-
ment to approve a partial exemption from 
the application of the Coastwise Laws to the 
maritime transportation of crude oil and pe-
troleum products between the United States 
of America and Puerto Rico for the duration 
of the armed conflict between Ukraine and 
Russia as well as the collateral thereof. 
Be it resolved by the House of Representatives 
of Puerto Rico: 
Section 1.—The President of the United 
States of America is hereby requested to 
grant a partial exemption from the applica-
tion of Coastwise Laws to the maritime 
transportation of crude oil and petroleum 
products between the United States of Amer-
ica and Puerto Rico for the duration of the 
armed conflict between Ukraine and Russia 
and the collateral effects thereof. The fore-
going for the purpose of addressing the de-
mand for land transportation and energy 
generation on the Island, as well as to miti-
gate what would otherwise be higher crude 
oil prices given the volatility of the inter-
national market. 
Section 2.—A copy of this Resolution, 
translated into the English language, shall 
be delivered to the President of the United 
States of America; the Department of Home-
land Security; the leadership of the United 
States Congress; and the Resident Commis-
sioner of Puerto Rico in Washington, D.C. 
Section 3.—This Resolution shall take ef-
fect upon its approval. 
POM–144. A resolution adopted by the Leg-
islature of Rockland County, New York, urg-
ing the United States House of Representa-
tives to pass the Sunshine Protection Act of 
2021, which would make daylight saving time 
permanent; to the Committee on Commerce, 
Science, and Transportation.

THE 
MEMORY 
OF 
THE 
VICTIMS OF THE HEINOUS AT-
TACK AT THE PULSE NIGHTCLUB 
ON JUNE 12, 2016 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida (for himself 
and Mr. RUBIO) submitted the following 
resolution; which was considered and 
agreed to: 
S. RES. 663 
Whereas, on June 12, 2016, a gunman in-
spired by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria 
targeted the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, 
Florida, where he killed 49 innocent victims 
and wounded dozens more in a despicable at-
tack; 
Whereas the attack at the Pulse nightclub 
was an attack on the LGBTQ community, 
the Hispanic community, the City of Or-
lando, the State of Florida, and the United 
States; 
Whereas the Orlando community continues 
to mourn the tragic loss of life but has dem-
onstrated remarkable strength, unity, and 
resilience in the aftermath of the horrendous 
event; 
Whereas June 12 is designated as ‘‘Pulse 
Remembrance Day’’ in the State of Florida 
to honor the victims and survivors of the 
senseless attack; 
Whereas the people of the United States 
continue to pray for those affected by the 
tragedy; and 
Whereas June 12, 2022, marks 6 years since 
the lives of the 49 innocent victims were 
tragically cut short by this senseless act of 
terrorism: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) commemorates the 49 innocent victims 
killed in the attack at the Pulse nightclub in 
Orlando, Florida, on June 12, 2016, and offers 
heartfelt condolences to the families, loved 
ones, and friends of the victims; 
(2) honors the dozens of survivors of the at-
tack and pledges continued resolve to stand 
against terrorism and hate; and 
(3) expresses gratitude to the brave law en-
forcement and emergency medical personnel 
who responded to the attack.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2868 
June 8, 2022 
Whereas 
reproductive 
and 
sexual 
healthcare providers, and those who support 
people making important healthcare deci-
sions, 
provide 
high-quality, 
essential 
healthcare and play a critical role in ensur-
ing people are able to make decisions about 
their bodies and lives with dignity, empathy, 
compassion, and respect; 
Whereas no one should be criminalized for 
providing essential healthcare; 
Whereas no one should be criminalized for 
their pregnancy outcomes, for using contra-
ception, or for obtaining gender-affirming 
care; 
Whereas States and localities have at-
tempted to prohibit healthcare providers 
from providing gender-affirming and repro-
ductive healthcare, including abortion care, 
to patients; 
Whereas people have been prosecuted in 
the United States for their actions during 
pregnancy that allegedly caused harm or 
risk to their pregnancies; 
Whereas people have been forced to under-
go unwanted medical procedures or surgical 
interventions, including involuntary steri-
lization and cesarean sections, prosecuted 
for not seeking healthcare, prosecuted for 
experiencing a miscarriage or stillbirth, 
criminalized for alcohol and drug use during 
pregnancy, and prosecuted for self-managing 
an abortion; 
Whereas groups like the American Medical 
Association, American Public Health Asso-
ciation, American Academy of Pediatrics, 
American Society of Addiction Medicine, the 
American College of Obstetricians and Gyne-
cologists, the American Bar Association, and 
others 
oppose 
the 
criminalization 
of 
healthcare provision and the criminalization 
of pregnancy outcomes; 
Whereas the threat of criminalization or 
prosecution can result in negative outcomes 
by intimidating people from seeking or pro-
viding care; 
Whereas abortion and gender-affirming 
care have become increasingly restricted in 
the United States; 
Whereas research shows there is an in-
creased need and demand for pills to self- 
manage an abortion in States with abortion 
restrictions, and that self-managed abortion 
with access to medications and accurate in-
formation is safe; 
Whereas the reasons why people self-man-
age an abortion are varied and valid; 
Whereas healthcare providers have an eth-
ical obligation to provide essential care to 
their patients and to protect the private 
medical information integral to the patient- 
provider relationship; 
Whereas even when charges are dropped or 
the defendant is exonerated, the turmoil 
caused by arrest or prosecution is irrep-
arable; 
Whereas several States have taken steps to 
repeal or reform laws that had been used to 
criminalize pregnancy outcomes and to in-
crease access to abortion, contraception, and 
gender-affirming care; 
Whereas Black, indigenous, and people of 
color, people with low incomes, LGBTQ+ in-
dividuals, and other marginalized individuals 
are 
disproportionately 
likely 
to 
be 
surveilled, arrested, charged, prosecuted, 
convicted, and heavily punished within the 
criminal justice system; 
Whereas Black, indigenous, and people of 
color, people with low incomes, LGBTQ+ in-
dividuals, and other marginalized individuals 
are more likely, due to persistent dispari-
ties, to experience adverse pregnancy out-
comes that place them under the scrutiny of 
the legal system; and 
Whereas punishing people for their preg-
nancy outcomes or for providing essential re-
productive and sexual healthcare violates 
their fundamental rights: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) condemns the misapplication of crimi-
nal laws to punish people for the outcomes of 
their pregnancies; 
(2) affirms that people deserve access to 
high-quality healthcare without fear of re-
prisal or punishment; 
(3) condemns the criminalization of pro-
viding essential healthcare; 
(4) affirms the ethical obligations of 
healthcare providers to safeguard patient 
privacy; and 
(5)(A) declares a vision for a future where 
access to abortion, contraception, and gen-
der-affirming care is free from restrictions 
and bans universally, and people are able to 
manage care on their own terms, free from 
discrimination or punishment; and 
(B) affirms the commitment of the Senate 
to working toward this goal in partnership 
with providers, patients, advocates, and 
their communities.

SUPPORTING H.R. 7910 AND H.R. 
2377 
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 8, 2022 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
today is day 159 of 2022. There have already 
been over 200 mass shootings this year. 
Madam Speaker, we cannot let this be our 
new reality. Thoughts and prayers are no 
longer enough. We must act, and we must do 
it now. 
This week, we must pass H.R. 7910, the 
Protecting Our Kids Act, and H.R. 2377, the 
Federal Extreme Risk Protection Order Act of 
2022. 
The Protecting Our Kids Act includes provi-
sions that would raise the lawful age to pur-
chase an assault-style weapon from 18 to 21, 
impose new restrictions on large capacity 
magazines, strengthen safe storage require-
ments, and crack down on the sale and dis-
tribution of unlicensed guns. 
The Federal Extreme Risk Protection Order 
Act of 2022 encourages states to improve and 
implement extreme risk laws, which would 
help keep guns out of the hands of those who 
are likely to pose an increased threat to them-
selves or to others. 
Madam Speaker, these are small—but nec-
essary—first steps. I would urge my col-
leagues to join me in supporting these bills, 
and to commit themselves to doing all they 
can to address the issue of gun violence.

COMMEMORATING 
THE 
CENTEN-
NIAL CELEBRATION OF GRANITE 
CONSTRUCTION COMPANY 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 8, 2022 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Granite Construction 
Company on its centennial anniversary and 
honor the lasting contributions of founder, 
Walter J. Wilkinson. Granite Construction 
Company is a leader in the construction indus-
try, paving the way for innovation and 
progress. The company’s Founder Walter J. 
Wilkinson was a man of integrity, persever-
ance, and dedication. He not only lived by 
these principles, but also instilled them in the 
culture and work of the Granite Construction 
Company; these quality ethics and values re-
main today. 
After earning his Bachelor of Arts degree in 
engineering, Mr. Wilkinson began his career 
as an engineer for the Lakeport Ice Company. 
In 1901, at the age of 20, he joined the Gran-
ite Rock Company and would eventually lead 
the construction division as superintendent. 
When Granite Construction Company was 
formed as a wholly owned subsidiary of Gran-
ite Rock in 1922, Mr. Wilkinson was chosen 
as Vice President and Arthur R. Wilson as 
President. 
In 1936, the Wilson family sold their shares 
of Granite Construction to Mr. Wilkinson, who 
then became President. In those early years 
of the Great Depression, Mr. Wilkinson and 
his wife, Carrie B. Earle, struggled to keep the 
company afloat, making personal sacrifices, 
including mortgaging all that they owned to 
help sustain the business. This perseverance 
and personal commitment left a lasting imprint 
on the company. 
With the advent of World War II, the busi-
ness turned around and the company began 
to reach unprecedented levels of growth. 
Projects such as the $400,000 contract to 
build Camp Ord, now known as Fort Ord, in 
1940 allowed Granite Construction to not only 
produce a profit, but also become a leader in 
the 
construction 
industry. 
In 
1942, 
Mr. 
Wilkinson retired from active service with the 
company, and Bert Scott took over as Presi-
dent. Mr. Wilkinson sold his shares to his two 
sons, Walter Junior and Jack. 
A scrupulous but fair businessman, Mr. 
Wilkinson adhered diligently to the code of 
conduct he established for the company, 
prioritizing integrity, hard work, and determina-
tion in his professional and personal life. His 
colleagues called him a ‘‘visionary’’ as he suc-
cessfully steered Granite Construction Com-
pany through rocky times to recovery. 
Outside of his professional work, Mr. 
Wilkinson was devoted to serving his commu-
nity. He kept a daily diary, written in impec-
cable penmanship, chronicling his life and the 
founding of Granite Construction. He was a 
skilled orator, storyteller, and speech writer. 
Active in civic organizations, Mr. Wilkinson 
was a charter member of the Watsonville Ex-
change Club and President of the Chamber of 
Commerce as well as the Rotary Club. More-
over, as President and Founding Member of 
the Association of General Contractors of 
Northern California, Mr. Wilkinson was instru-
mental in establishing the Association’s first 
bylaws. 
Walter J. Wilkinson conducted himself in a 
manner deserving of respect. With loyalty, 
dedication, and perseverance, he laid the 
foundation for a company able to weather the 
toughest of storms. The success of Granite 
Construction as the beacon of progress in to-
day’s construction industry is a tribute to him. 
Congratulations to Granite Construction Com-
pany on their centennial celebration.

HON. STEVE COHEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 8, 2022 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I include in

tional information I recently learned about con-
cerning the Drug Enforcement Agency’s en-
counter with Daniel Kandalaft on or about Jan-
uary 24, 2016 at Charles de Gaulle Airport in 
Paris, France. At a July 8, 2017 Foreign Af-
fairs Committee hearing entitled, ‘‘Attacking 
Hezbollah’s Financial Network: Policy Op-
tions,’’ a witness referenced that Mr. Kandalaft 
was arrested by the DEA. As this recent letter 
from the Drug Enforcement Agency describes, 
the ‘‘DEA does not have the authority to per-
form arrests or detainments in foreign coun-
tries.’’

DEAR CONGRESSMAN COHEN: This responds 
to 
your

to

Anne 
Milgram, dated October 8, 2021, regarding a 
potential Drug Enforcement Administration

Gaulle Airport in Paris, France. We appre-
ciate the opportunity to address your in-
quiry, and we apologize for our delay in re-
sponding to your letter. 
DEA is aware that Mr. Kandalaft was de-
tained by French Authorities on January 24, 
2016, at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, 
France. DEA does not have the authority to 
perform arrests or detainments in foreign 
countries. For further information, we rec-
ommend reaching out directly to the French 
Authorities who have oversight of these ac-
tions. We apologize that we are unable to 
provide more information.

HONORING NANCY CASSIDY 
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 8, 2022 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in recognition of Nancy Cassidy, who is being 
honored for her retirement from the Depart-
ment of Safety after more than twenty-two 
years of service. Throughout her time as a 
government employee, Nancy has worked in a 
wide range of departments and roles. Nancy 
has served the state of New Hampshire with 
distinction and is revered by her peers for her 
expertise. 
Prior to her time in the Commissioner’s Of-
fice, Nancy worked in the Bureau of Financial 
Responsibility with the Division of Motor Vehi-
cles. She quickly moved up in the ranks and 
was promoted to Executive Secretary in the 
Forensic Lab for the Division of State Police, 
where she worked closely with state agencies, 
local officials, and the Attorney General’s Of-
fice for nearly seven years. After being further 
promoted to the Commissioner’s Office, Nancy 
continued to work tirelessly for her community. 
On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-
shire, I want to thank Nancy for her continued

HONORING THE LIFE OF 
ALEXANDER AURRICHIO 
HON. THOMAS R. SUOZZI 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 8, 2022 
Mr. SUOZZI. Madam Speaker, it is with a 
heavy heart that I rise today to honor the life 
of Alexander Aurrichio, a talented young Aus-
tralian Rules Footballer who touched the lives 
of his family, friends, and community. Alexan-
der’s teammates describe him as a compas-
sionate soul with a smile that would light up 
the room. Alexander’s father, Lou Aurrichio, 
remembers his son as ‘‘a leader of men, a 
teacher of children and a true motivator.’’ 
Alexander Aurrichio grew up playing basket-
ball at Half Hollow Hills West High School, in 
Suffolk County, Long Island and went on to 
play collegiate soccer and baseball at Colum-
bia University. This June, Alexander will surely 
be missed when his Columbia University team 
and classmates come together for their 10– 
year reunion. 
Nicknamed ‘‘Rooch’’ Alexander stood tall at 
6’6’’ and 220 pounds, Alexander is described 
as a big young man with an even bigger per-
sonality. According to his mother, Jill, he was 
born an incredible 14 lbs. and called Alex-
ander the Great by all the nurses at the hos-
pital. Not only was Alexander loved by his 
community, he had many close friends world-
wide, especially in Australia where he had 
been playing football since 2014, with a dream 
to one day play for the AFL. He later played 
for South Adelaide in the South Australian Na-
tional Football League (SANFL) before moving 
north to join Northern Territory Football 
League (NTFL) club Waratah in Darwin. 
Alexander’s ‘‘Australian brother’’ Tom Fields 
remembered Alexander by saying ‘‘Alex had 
the gift to enter into someone’s life for a brief 
moment and instantly make them feel happier, 
safe, and better about themselves, to me that 
is the mark of an exceptional human being’’ 
NBA star Tobias Harris played high school 
basketball with Alexander and tweeted, ‘‘Alex 
was seriously one of the greatest human 
beings I’ve come across. I’ve lost a friend that 
I will forever miss.’’ 
Alexander Aurrichio was riding a bicycle in 
Howard Springs on June 8, 2020, when he 
was involved in a fatal crash with a car. He 
was 30 years old. Alexander Aurrichio is sur-
vived by his mother Jill, father Lou and sib-
lings John, Michael, Jillian, and Christopher. 
As we honor him today, we keep his family 
and friends in our thoughts and prayers, with 
the hope that all those he inspired will flourish 
as they keep his memory alive eternally in 
their hearts. 
CELEBRATING 100 YEARS OF THE 
ALPHA 
BETA 
CHAPTER 
OF 
ALPHA GAMMA DELTA FRATER-
NITY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF 
MICHIGAN 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 8, 2022 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the one-hundredth anniver-
sary of the Alpha Beta Chapter of the Alpha 
Gamma Delta Fraternity at the University of 
Michigan—Ann Arbor. Their one hundred 
years of service and dedication to our local 
community is worthy of commendation. 
Alpha Gamma Delta Fraternity was founded 
in 1904 by eleven women at Syracuse Univer-
sity. Over the years, the fraternity has ex-
panded to include chapters at 199 different 
colleges and universities in the United States 
and Canada and has been home to over 
197,000 women. The Alpha Gamma Delta 
Alpha Beta Chapter at the University of Michi-
gan was founded in 1922. Starting with only 
25 members, the fraternity has grown im-
mensely, and members have gone on to be 
leaders in Michigan and around the globe. 
At the University of Michigan—Ann Arbor, 
the Alpha Gamma Delta fraternity has served 
children, families, and individuals affected by 
social and economic challenges in the City of 
Ann Arbor and in surrounding communities. 
The fraternity is dedicated to making a positive 
impact through their philanthropy and leader-
ship. Their volunteer work includes partnering 
with charitable organizations such as Feeding 
America and Meals on Wheels. 
A century after its founding, the Alpha 
Gamma Delta fraternity is working harder than 
ever to make a difference in Ann Arbor. While 
fundraising for Fighting Hunger, the fraternity 
recently raised almost seven thousand dollars 
to help fight hunger in Ann Arbor and all 
around the United States. With the help of 
their enthusiastic members, the Alpha Gamma 
Delta fraternity has lent vital support to those 
in need, supporting our local community and 
beyond. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me today in celebrating the one hundredth an-
niversary of the Alpha Beta Chapter of the 
Alpha Gamma Delta Fraternity at the Univer-
sity of Michigan—Ann Arbor. We are grateful 
for the fraternity’s century of impactful work 
and wish Alpha Gamma Delta members and 
alumni continued success in service in the 
years ahead.

HONORING DR. EVE KURTIN- 
STEINBERG 
HON. JUDY CHU 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 8, 2022 
Ms. CHU. Madam Speaker, I rise today with 
Members of my delegation, the Honorable 
MARK
TAKANO
and the Honorable ALAN 
LOWENTHAL, to honor the life of Dr. Eve Kurtin- 
Steinberg, who passed away on May 5, 2022, 
at the age of 68. From her career in the 
healthcare sector to her outstanding dedica-
tion to the Jewish community, Eve tirelessly 
put the needs of others before her own. We 
were also lucky enough to call Eve a friend. 
A graduate from the University of the 
Pacific’s Thomas J. Long School of Pharmacy 
and the University of California, Los Angeles’ 
Anderson School of Management, Eve used 
her 
medical 
and 
business 
expertise 
to 
kickstart a decades-long, prolific career as a 
healthcare executive and investor. With a pas-
sion for medical technology advancement and 
reducing the cost of patient care, Eve served 
in myriad leadership roles including as the 
managing director of Pacific Venture Group, 
founder and CEO of Physician Venture Man-
agement and CEO, and President of Kurtin 
Communications. She also served as vice 
president of American Medical International, 
was a founding member of the RAND Health 
Board of Advisors, and sat on numerous other 
healthcare boards, including that of her alma 
mater, the Pacific Board of Regents. 
This commitment to helping others also 
seeped into Eve’s longtime advocacy for the 
Jewish community, of which she was consid-
ered a pillar. For decades, Eve devoted her-
self to the Stephen Wise Temple in Los Ange-
les, California, and served in many leadership 
roles including chair of the Wise Parents As-
sociation, chair of the Temple’s Financial 
Oversight Committee, and even as president 
of the Temple’s congregation from 2003 to 
2005. Even when she was not in a leadership 
position within the Temple, Eve was known for 
being an active, vivacious participant in any 
service or event she attended. 
Eve’s dedication to the Jewish community 
and Israel expanded beyond her work with the 
Wise Temple. Eve was also engaged for dec-
ades with the American Israel Public Affairs 
Committee (AIPAC), where she served as Po-
litical Chair for Southern California and helped 
to foster an active AIPAC community within 
the Wise Temple. Furthermore, as director of 
the Union for Reform Judaism, Eve was in-
vited to attend a meeting with former president 
Obama’s then-chief of staff, Jack Lew, to dis-
cuss international relations with Israel, the Af-
fordable Care Act and more because of her 
extensive knowledge on the matters. And a 
lifelong donor to the Jewish Federation of 
Greater Los Angeles, Eve served as cochair 
of their literary program KOREH LA and was 
a longtime member of their Community En-
gagement Committee. She even dedicated her 
time to being a volunteer for School on 
Wheels, a school tutoring program. 
Eve is survived by her spouse, Dr. Michael 
Steinberg, her children Beth and Drew, and 
her grandchildren Lev, Liam, and Micah. It is 
clear that a driving force in Eve’s life was 
serving those around her, in whatever sector 
or group she touched. Eve will be remem-
bered for this very service and dedication 
through the Hebrew saying Eshet Chayil, or 
Woman of Valor. We ask our colleagues to 
join us in commemorating the life of this ex-
traordinary individual.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E593 
June 8, 2022 
College District (AVCCD) President and Su-
perintendent, Edward Knudson, on his retire-
ment from AVCCD after serving in higher edu-
cation for over three decades. 
Like many Americans in the Vietnam era, 
Ed answered the call to serve our nation in 
the United States Armed Forces. He continued 
this proud legacy of service by transitioning to 
the field of higher education. Working at his 
alma mater in the College of Business at Or-
egon State University, Ed moved on to teach 
at a number of institutions, including the Uni-
versity of Georgia, Western Oregon University, 
and the Linn-Benton Community College. 
In 2002, Ed made his way to Bakersfield, 
California, where I would get to know him, his 
passion for teaching, and his love for the col-
lege community. Initially the Dean of Eco-
nomic and Workforce Development at Bakers-
field College, Ed was swiftly promoted to Vice 
President of Academic Affairs in 2006. In 
2009, Ed moved to Moorpark College and in 
2013, began his career with Antelope Valley 
College. 
Serving as the President and Super-
intendent of AVCCD, Ed transformed the 
school. Under his leadership, Antelope Valley 
College awarded a record-setting number of 
degrees and certificates to students and a sig-
nificant construction bond was passed, pro-
viding $350 million towards renovations of the 
school’s facilities. Moreover, Ed positioned An-
telope Valley College to better serve our com-
munity’s local workforce needs by developing 
a bachelor’s degree program in Airframe Man-
ufacturing for students. 
Throughout his life, Ed has devoted himself 
to instilling a sense of duty and love of learn-
ing to every student he met. Though he will be 
greatly missed at AVCCD, I am confident he 
will continue to shape the lives of countless in-
dividuals. On behalf of the 23rd Congressional 
District of California, I would like to thank Ed 
for his service in higher education to our com-
munity in Bakersfield and Lancaster, and I 
wish him and his wife, Susan, the very best as 
they enter this new chapter in their lives.

SPECIAL 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
FA-
THER 
MICHAEL 
DANDURAND 
AND THE TWENTY-FIFTH ANNI-
VERSARY OF HIS ORDINATION 
HON. ROBERT E. LATTA 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 8, 2022 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Father Michael Dandurand, an out-
standing citizen from Assumption, Ohio, who 
will celebrate the 25th anniversary of his ordi-
nation on June 11, 2022. This milestone pro-
vides the opportunity to recognize Father 
Dandurand’s service to the Catholic Church 
and to our country. 
Born and raised in Tiffin, Ohio, Father 
Dandurand earned a bachelor’s degree in his-
tory from Saint Meinrad College Seminary in 
Indiana, a master’s degree in Corporate and 
Public Communication at Seton Hall University 
in 1993, and a Masters of Divinity from St. 
Meinrad school of Theology in 1997. 
After ordination, Father Dandurand served 
as an Associate Pastor in St. Charles Parish 
in Lima, St. Rose Parish in Perrysburg, and 
St. 
Joseph 
Parish 
in 
Maumee. 
Father 
Dandurand also served as an instructor and 
chaplain at Calvert Catholic High School in Tif-
fin, Ohio. From 2006 to 2013, he was pastor 
at the St. Thomas More University Parish in 
Bowling Green, also serving as the Chaplain 
for the Bowling Green State University Foot-
ball Team. At his current parish, Holy Trinity 
Catholic Church, he serves the students at the 
Holy Trinity School as well as the wider parish 
community. Father Dandurand was commis-
sioned as an Air National Guard Chaplain in 
2014 and was assigned to the 180th Fighter 
Wing of the Ohio Air National Guard. He de-
ployed in March 2020 to Bagram Airfield in Af-
ghanistan and also served as the Catholic 
chaplain at the Ali Al Salem Air Base in Ku-
wait. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in celebrating the 25th anniversary of Fa-
ther Michael Dandurand’s ordination. It is my 
great pleasure to recognize this outstanding 
achievement, and I thank him for his service 
to our country and his flock. On behalf of the 
people of the Fifth Congressional District of 
Ohio, I wish Father Dandurand the best in all 
his future endeavors.

HONORING ANDREW ‘‘STEVE’’ 
HEALEY, III 
HON. ANDY KIM 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 8, 2022 
Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor Andrew ‘‘Steve’’ Healey, 
III, a dedicated teacher and coach of 33 years 
for students throughout New Jersey. 
For more than 25 years, Steve served as a 
teacher, head track coach, and defensive co-
ordinator for the Central Regional High School 
football team. Using his experience as a Divi-
sion I athlete at Simpson College, he oversaw 
the school’s teams becoming multiple Shore 
Conference and State champions. Because of 
his leadership and passion, Steve was in-
ducted into the New Jersey State Coaches 
Association Hall of Fame in 2003. At the con-
clusion of his tenure as head track coach, the 
team’s final record was an impressive 188–51. 
It seems only fitting that tomorrow Central Re-
gional High School will be naming the school’s 
track in his honor. 
His passion for coaching and encouraging 
students was seen just as frequently on the 
field as it was in the classroom. For his incred-
ible work he was awarded Central Regional 
Teacher of the Year, the NJ Governor’s Award 
for Outstanding Teacher, and the Who’s Who 
Among America’s Teachers. 
Steve Healey is a shining example of what 
makes a coach and teacher successful: the 
ability to inspire athletes and students to reach 
their fullest potential by imparting knowledge 
and the tools necessary to succeed. I know I 
speak for New Jersey’s 3rd District in con-
gratulating Steve on this incredible tribute. The 
newly named track and the athletes who use 
it will now and forever know about Steve’s in-
credible work ethic, competitive drive, and 
compassion. I congratulate coach on a distin-
guished career and thank him for imparting his 
values so we can strive to live by his example. 
HONORING MICHAEL CLARK FOR 
HIS SERVICE 
HON. JAKE ELLZEY 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 8, 2022 
Mr. ELLZEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life of a true Texan, Michael 
Clark. Mike was a hero that dedicated his life 
to the service of his country. He started his 
career as an interrogator conducting strategic 
level debriefings of legal travelers, escapees, 
and defectors along the border between East 
and West Germany. He later moved to coun-
terintelligence where he was assigned to Bal-
listic Missile Defense Systems Command and 
was the covering agent for the Missile Intel-
ligence Agency and the Strategic Defense Ini-
tiative Program (Star Wars) programs. It was 
here that he participated in multiple espionage 
investigations, the most notable was that of 
James Durwood Harper. After his success 
with counterintelligence Mike spent the next 
20 years of his career in the HUMINT oper-
ations. It was with HUMINT as a case officer 
that Mike focused on spotting, assessing, and 
recruiting foreign nationals in order to conduct 
espionage for the United States. He then 
spent his final 8 years of service with U.S. 
Army Special Operations as the 1st Special 
Forces Operational Detachment Delta (Delta 
Force). Even after retirement Mike still served 
as a Senior Intelligence Operations Specialist 
for a USAF Special Operations unit and as 
CEO of OST–I, a security consulting company 
in Fort Worth Texas. 
Michael Clark is a national hero who was a 
expert in his field and true war fighter. We lost 
a great man who will always be remember for 
his service, love of his country, cigars, and 
Jameson Whiskey. But most of all the love he 
had for his family and friends. I thank Mr. 
Clark, for his dedication to our country and we 
all pray for peace for his family during this 
time.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 8, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a tenacious and 
self-motivated trailblazer Mrs. Dora Smith. 
Dora has shown what can be done through 
hard work, dedication, and a desire to achieve 
success. 
Dora is a native of Vicksburg where she at-

As a member of the Vicksburg Police De-
partment, Dora touched the lives of many chil-

RECOGNIZING CASWELL COUNTY 
HON. TED BUDD 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 8, 2022 
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
congratulate Caswell County for celebrating its 
245th anniversary. 
Caswell County has a rich history, and a 
celebration of the county is a celebration of 
the people who made the region home. Estab-
lished on June 1, 1777, during the Revolu-
tionary War, the county was named in honor 
of Richard Caswell, one of North Carolina’s 
delegates to the Continental Congress and the 
state’s first non-colonial governor. Throughout 
the years, Caswell County has left an indelible 
mark on the trajectory of the Old North State. 
It was the birthplace of many distinguished 
North Carolinians such as our ‘‘Father of Edu-
cation’’ Archibald Murphy, and it was the 
home of acclaimed furnituremaker Thomas 
Day. The county’s farmers developed the land 
into an agricultural powerhouse for over two 
centuries, and they gained international re-
nown for discovering the region’s distinct 
‘‘bright leaf’’ flue-cured tobacco. Caswell 
County is fortunate to continue to have resi-
dents 
and 
community 
leaders 
who 
are 
proactively engaged on the top issues facing 
the county and are always looking to improve 
the quality of life for its citizens. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in con-
gratulating the people of Caswell County for 
celebrating this momentous anniversary. It is 
my sincere hope that the county will continue 
to prosper over the next two centuries and be-
yond.

FOOD AND DRUG AMENDMENTS OF 
2022 
SPEECH OF 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 7, 2022 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise in full 
support of H.R. 7667, the Food and Drug 
Amendments Act of 2022 and I’m proud to 
sponsor this strong, bipartisan FDA user fee 
bill. 
Our nation is an international leader in bio-
medical innovation. With that achievement 
comes an increasingly complex FDA review 
process for drugs and devices. Over the past 
few decades, the user fee agreements have 
evolved to ensure the FDA has the resources 
necessary so its reviews for drugs and de-
vices are prompt, transparent, and predictable. 
The agreements included in the bill before us 
today are the latest evolution, and will in total, 
provide billions of dollars to the FDA over the 
next five years, allowing FDA to hire hundreds 
of new full-time employees. These resources 
will help the FDA recover from the pandemic 
and pick up its regular day-to-day work even 
more effectively. 
Beyond the user fee agreement, the bill in-
cludes several important legislative riders. It 
includes key portions of my bipartisan DEPICT 
Act, which I introduced with Representatives 
KELLY and FITZPATRICK. FDA data shows that 
for the drugs approved in 2020, 75 percent of 
clinical trial participants were white. Only 8 
percent of trial participants were African Amer-
ican and 11 percent were Hispanic. The DE-
PICT Act included in the bill would statutorily 
require drug companies to demonstrate how 
they will include diverse populations in their 
clinical trials by reporting to FDA a ‘‘diversity 
action plan’’ with targets by demographic sub-
groups. As we heard from Dr. Mesa during our 
hearing, diverse clinical trials are not only fair 
and just—it’s good science. 
H.R. 7667 also includes important reforms 
to the FDA’s inspections program based on 
bills introduced by Representatives GRIFFITH 
and WELCH, as well as by myself and Rep-
resentative HUDSON. These provisions will help 
the FDA catch up from a two-year inspection 
backlog due to the pandemic and conduct a 
pilot program of unannounced foreign inspec-
tions. 
H.R. 7667 includes targeted reforms to im-
prove the accelerated approval program so 
that drugs approved under that program ulti-
mately show their clinical effectiveness. 
The bill reauthorizes the Best Pharma-
ceuticals for Children Act (BPCA), which I first 
authored in 1997. Thanks to BPCA and its 
partner, the Pediatric Research Equity Act, 
900 drugs newly have pediatric use informa-
tion. 
Overall, this is a very strong bill with many 
worthy reforms, and I encourage my col-
leagues to vote for it.

HONORING WHITE STAR 
MISSIONARY BAPTIST CHURCH 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 8, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the history of 
White Star Missionary Baptist Church. 
The history of White Star Missionary Baptist 
Church will help to inspire the present and fu-
ture congregations. Since its beginning, White 
Star has stood pointing men and women, 
boys, and girls to the Heavenly way. Amid 
world turmoil in the face of strife and war, and 
at times when Christian ideals are crumbling 
this church has ever held high the banner of 
Christ who said, ‘‘Upon this rock I build my 
church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail 
against it.’’ 
White Star Church had its beginning intri-
cately tied to another church, the ‘‘Colored 
Methodist Episcopal Church.’’ The first church 
held its services in the Methodist church build-
ing that was located on the northwest corner 
of Railway Avenue and Willis Street (the 
present residence of Mr. & Mrs. S.A. Payton). 
White Star Church developed out of the de-
sires of and efforts of some of the residents of 
Belzoni to organize a church. These members 
met in the Methodist building until they were 
able to purchase the Methodist lots and build 
their own church. According to Mrs. Geneva 
York and the legal documents at the county 
courthouse, White Star Church was organized 
in 1915. 
The White Star Church became a separate 
entity in 1920 under the leadership of its first 
pastor, the Reverend I.E. Taylor. During his 
leadership, White Star Church moved to its 
present site at 609 Railway Avenue. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing White Star Missionary Bap-
tist Church for their dedication and tenacity to 
serving their members and community.

COMMEMORATING THE 30TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE 340B DISCOUNT 
DRUG PROGRAM 
SPEECH OF 
HON. DAVID B. McKINLEY 
OF WEST VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 7, 2022 
Mr. MCKINLEY. Madam Speaker, in West 
Virginia, the 340B Drug Pricing Program is es-
sential to providing access to low-cost medi-
cine for inividuals in rural and underserved 
areas. 
Without it, many health care providers would 
not be able to deliver critical services to the 
communities they serve. 
The benefits are clear and the need is obvi-
ous, not just in West Virginia, but for rural and 
underserved communities across the country. 
Since coming to Congress more than a dec-
ade ago, I’ve been strong advocate for the 
340B program. 
It has been an honor to join Rep. 
SPANBERGER on numerous occasions in our 
ongoing effort to defend and protect 340B, be-
cause it is the right thing to do for the people 
we serve. 
On the 30th anniversary of the program, we 
must recommit to holding pharmaceutical com-
panies accountable and protect the program 
going forward. This means ensuring care for 
the uninsured, low-income and rural patients is 
not interrupted and our most vulnerable com-
munities continue to have access to affordable 
medicine. 
If 340B ended in West Virginia, for example, 
the State’s hospitals would see losses of near-
ly $300 million, resulting in services being cut, 
and access to care and low-cost prescriptions 
severely limited, hurting the neediest people 
the most. 
We need to stay engaged and keep up the 
charge. God Bless America.

HONORING 
ABUNDANT 
LIFE 
AS-
SEMBLY CHURCH OF APOSTOLIC 
FAITH, INC. 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 8, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable 
church, Abundant Life Assembly Church of 
Apostolic Faith, Inc. 
In 1978, God instructed Apostle James T. 
Herrington, a native of Sardis, Georgia, to 
transition from his surroundings because he 
had been assigned to a greater work. Leaving 
his family behind, Apostle, his wife, and young 
son moved to Grenada, Mississippi, and start-
ed what was then, a very humble ministry. 
Apostle James T. Herrington is the Vice 
President of the General Board of the Alliance 
of 
Apostolic 
Churches 
of 
Christ 
Jesus 
(AACCJ). He is a member of the Grenada 
Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance; Gre-
nada Chamber of Commerce; Grenada’s 
Chapter of 100 Black Men of America; and 
Grenada’s Chapter of the Rotary Club. 
The Abundant Life Assembly Church of the 
Apostolic Faith, Inc. was literally birthed out of 
his heart and was the first apostolic church to 
grace the city of Grenada. 
Since the church’s inception in 1982, and its 
humble beginning, the church has experienced 
tremendous growth and now Apostle serves 
as Senior Pastor of this assembly and Pre-
siding Bishop and Chief Apostle of the Abun-
dant Life Assembly Churches of the Apostolic 
Faith, Inc. (ALCAF) which has churches 
throughout the southeastern continental United 
States. 
June 2022, the Abundant Life Assembly 
Church of the Apostolic Faith, Inc. will honor 
its’ 40-year anniversary. The ALCAF has done 
so much for the Grenada community. Through 
ALCAF, Apostle Herrington has provided a 
daycare for children to attend, and he has pro-
vided transportation to the community that 
needed rides to their doctor appointments or 
work. Apostle Herrington has also provided 
food boxes. 
We are very thankful for Abundant Life As-
sembly Church of Apostolic Faith, Inc. and 
Apostle James T. Herrington for all the aston-
ishing things he has done for the Grenada 
community. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Abundant Life Assembly 
Church of Apostolic Faith, Inc. for its longevity 
and dedication to serving the community.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E596 
June 8, 2022 
of the Associated General Contractors (AGC), 
the two most prominent commercial building 
associations in the region. Operating as sepa-
rate entities for nearly eighty years, The Build-
ers’ Association and the Kansas City Chapter 
of the AGC hope to better serve their respec-
tive members by bringing them together under 
one roof. With the signing of a ceremonial 
charter, the presentation of a charter certifi-
cate, and the unveiling of the new, unified as-
sociation’s logo, today marks a historic mile-
stone for mid-America’s construction industry. 
Now representing one of the largest commer-
cial construction associations in the county, 
The Builders, a chapter of the AGC, is poised 
to advance the interests of the construction in-
dustry and its workers further than either of 
the original, separate entities could do on their 
own. As members from both associations 
gather today to recognize this important occa-
sion, let us reflect on the history of The Build-
er’s Association and the AGC, the profound 
impact they have made in the heart of Amer-
ica, and the spirit of collaboration that made 
this merger possible. 
The Builders’ Association, originally known 
as The Builders’ and Traders Exchange, was 
founded in 1887 with nearly one hundred and 
forty original members. Under the leadership 
of B.F. Swain, the first Board Chairman, and 
C.L. McDonald, the first managing director, 
The Builders’ played a profound role in the de-
velopment of Kansas City, incorporated just 
thirty-four years prior, and the midwestern 
United States. For nearly one hundred and 
fifty years, The Builders’ have faithfully deliv-
ered safety, craft, and management training; 
employment, labor, and government relations; 
along with construction plans and technology 
tools. Today, The Builders’ Association serves 
hundreds of member companies that employ 
over twenty-five-thousand people in mid-Amer-
ica. For these members, the services offered 
by The Builders’ Association are invaluable to 
fostering a healthy, thriving construction indus-
try. From hosting academies and seminars for 
individuals hoping to enter the industry or ad-
vance within their companies, to helping em-
ployers and job seekers establish mutually 
beneficial relationships, The Builders’ role in 
supporting the commercial construction indus-
try cannot be overstated. By providing young 
people with information and resources about 
careers in the construction industry, and by 
supporting the educational endeavors of stu-
dents planning to enter construction-related 
fields through The Builders’ Association Schol-
arship Foundation, The Builders’ have gone 
above and beyond to ensure a strong con-
struction industry for generations to come. 
Moreover, The Builders’ Training Center in 
North Kansas City, home to eight apprentice-
ship training programs, guarantees that tomor-
row’s construction will be carried out by 
welltrained and well-educated workers. And in 
all that they do, The Builders’ have never 
failed to set the highest standards for workers’ 
safety, understanding that the wellbeing of the 
construction 
industry 
depends 
on 
the 
wellbeing of construction workers. 
The Kansas City Chapter of the Associated 
General Contractors was chartered as a sister 
association to The Builders’ Association in the 
early 1900s. Today, the Kansas City Chapter 
of the AGC represents more than one-hundred 
firms in the heartland region. Realizing the 
value of national connection and engagement 
offered through the Associated General Con-
tractors of America, The Builders’ added the 
option of membership in the AGC soon after 
the organization established roots in Kansas 
City. Herein lies an important observation—for 
nearly a century, The Builders’ and the AGC 
have operated in close collaboration, not only 
sharing members and staff, but also a com-
mon mission and vision. However, as part of 
the Associated General Contractors of Amer-
ica, the largest and oldest national construc-
tion trade association in the United States, the 
Kansas City Chapter of the AGC has histori-
cally been able to offer greater access to re-
sources and services, along with expanded 
opportunities to network with others in the in-
dustry, develop business, and create a strong-
er voice to advocate on behalf of the construc-
tion industry. 
Thus, today’s merger is in keeping with dec-
ades of collaboration between The Builders’ 
and the AGC, in addition to the longstanding 
commitments of both organizations to best 
serve the interests of their members and the 
commercial construction industry. Indeed, the 
One Builders initiative helps strengthen and 
solidify a sense of unity that has long bound 
The Builders’ and the local AGC chapter, and 
in doing so, will enhance the industry’s influ-
ence in the Kansas City region and throughout 
the nation. The Builders, a chapter of the 
AGC, will undoubtedly expand economic op-
portunities for the Greater Kansas City area 
and usher in a new era of prosperity for the 
region’s construction industry and the thou-
sands of workers it employs. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in cele-
brating the merger of The Builders’ Associa-
tion and the Kansas City Chapter of the Asso-
ciated General Contractors to form The Build-
ers, a chapter of the AGC.

HONORING TRUE LIGHT M.B. 
CHURCH 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 8, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the history of 
True Light M. B. Church. 
In 
1934, 
approximately 
43 
members 
marched with candles from Morning Star Bap-
tist Church on Kane Street to a small store on 
East Bell Street in Jackson, Mississippi. Rev. 
J. H. Sims was the founder and first pastor of 
True Light M. B. Church. A few of the pio-
neers were Mary Lee Hicks, Sarah Lynn, 
Pearlina Smith and Rev. James Thomas. Rev. 
Sims served True Light faithfully until his de-
parture. Then, Rev. Will Robinson was in-
stalled as the second pastor of True Light and 
served for three years. Under Rev. Robinson’s 
leadership, the membership relocated from the 
store on Bell Street to a wooden framed build-
ing in the back of True Light Church present 
location. 
Reverend (Dr.) Robert H. Walls was the 
third and most tenured pastor of True Light. 
He was a licensed minister from Baton Rouge, 
Louisiana, and joined True Light in 1935 along 
with his wife, Leatha Warren Walls. After Rev. 
Robinson departure, the church asked Rev. 
Walls to serve as Pastor until they decided to 
call a pastor. The church made great progress 
under his leadership, and the membership in-
creased. Because of this progress, Rev. Walls 
was ordained to preach the Gospel. In April of 
1940, the church asked Rev. Walls to serve 
as True Light’s Pastor, and he accepted this 
calling of God. 
Because of the church’s growth, a survey 
revealed a need for additional space. To ad-
dress this need, the church purchased two lots 
with a seven-room house. Uplifting services 
were held in a small wood framed building on 
the recently purchased property. The contin-
ued growth created the need for a modern 
church building. The church borrowed $10,000 
to construct the building. Pastor Walls drew on 
a brown paper bag a sketch of the present ed-
ifice. Pastor Walls once stated, ‘‘True Light 
Church was spiritually built.’’ He had never 
constructed a building before but became a 
‘‘Master Builder.’’ For five years, day and 
night, he toiled. He had many sleepless nights 
and cried many tears, but he kept on working 
and had faith that God would surely see them 
through. In 1953, the church marched into our 
present edifice. The church began full-time 
worship service in 1961. True Light Church 
was one of the first Black churches in the City 
of Jackson and the first Black church to be 
constructed with bricks in the City of Jackson. 
In 2001, after Pastor Walls entered the 
evening time of his life, Reverend Marvin 
Adams began to serve as Interim Pastor of 
True Light. Rev. Adams and his family were 
long time members of True Light Church. 
Thus, he was familiar with the membership 
and the various ministries. He was installed as 
the fourth Pastor of True Light that same year. 
Under Rev. Adams leadership, three ministers 
served as Associate Ministers: Carlos Casa-
nova, Henry Taylor, and James Thomas. 
Brother Clarence James was ordained as a 
deacon. The interior sanctuary was renovated, 
and a Vesta View added to accommodate 
members and visitors waiting to enter the 
sanctuary. The church purchased a 47-seat 
passenger bus and carpeting was placed in 
the dining area of the Fellowship Hall. A 
Dance Ministry and Food and Clothing Min-
istry were organized. Rev. Adams faithfully 
served as Pastor of True Light Church for 
three years. 
In March of 2006, God sent the church a 
spirit-filled anointed man of His choice, Marcus 
E. Cheeks. Pastor Cheeks was installed as 
the fifth pastor of True Light Church. He is an 
educator by trade holding degrees from 
Tougaloo College, Jackson State University 
and soon to be the University of Mississippi. 
Pastor Cheeks believes that a church’s main 
focus should be in growing spiritually. He has 
the belief that through faithful study, dedication 
to the Word, and an intimate daily walk with 
Jesus Christ, the Lord will surely use him to 
glorify His Kingdom. Under his leadership, four 
ministers have served as Associate Ministers, 
Carlos Casanova, Henry Taylor, James Thom-
as, and Darrel Woullard, Sr. Five Deacons, 
Leroy Carter, Marc Clay, Curtis Holmes, Lee 
Lyle, and Harvey Marshall have been or-
dained. In addition, True Light’s ministries 
have increased to include a Couples Ministry, 
an Outreach Ministry, Small Group Study plat-
form for all Christian teachings, and the imple-
mentation of the Unity Drive designed to in-
crease our personal and financial commit-
ments to God. The church has purchased 
three adjacent properties for future growth. 
Physical renovations have taken place in sev-
eral areas of the church: the Pastor’s Study,

Educational Complex and the purchase of an 
additional church minibus. Most importantly, 
Pastor Cheeks has provided a vision into the 
future, with fervent prayer, focused commit-
ment and faithful service united with our Lord 
and Savior, ‘‘One in Jesus.’’ 
True Light Missionary Baptist Church has 
made significant contributions to the commu-
nity, state and Nation by being actively in-
volved in the Midtown Community, the Jack-
son District Missionary Baptist Association, the 
Jackson District Congress of Christian Edu-
cation, General Missionary Baptist State Con-
vention of Mississippi and the National Baptist 
Convention, USA, Inc. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the history of True Light Mis-
sionary Baptist Church.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE NORTH-
EASTERN PENNSYLVANIA PHIL-
HARMONIC’S 50TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 8, 2022 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, today 
I honor the Northeastern Pennsylvania Phil-
harmonic as they celebrate their 50th anniver-
sary. Under the direction of Music Director 
Me´lisse Brunet and Executive Director Nancy 
Sanderson, the NEPA Philharmonic is a pre-
mier symphony orchestra bringing high caliber 
pops performances and classical music to 
Northeastern Pennsylvania. 
Until the late 1960s, Northeastern Pennsyl-
vania was home to two independent orches-
tras in Wilkes-Barre and Scranton. In early 
1969, the boards of the two symphonies 
began to discuss the idea of increased co-
operation between the two groups, and by Oc-
tober, a goal was set to have a joint orchestra 
give four performances in each city during the 
1970–71 season. In January of 1970, the joint 
venture announced: a two-year trial period of 
a united symphony orchestra to be called the 
Northeastern 
Pennsylvania 
(NEPA) 
Phil-
harmonic. 
The new orchestra was under the direction 
of Scranton’s, Beatrice Brown, then one of the 
few female conductors in the country, and 
Wilkes-Barre’s Ferdinand Liva. After Brown’s 
departure in 1971, conductor of the Pittsburg 
Symphony, Polish-born Thomas Michalak, was 
hired as the first official music director after 
the Philharmonic’s historic incorporation. The 
first performances were held in October 1972 
at the Irem Temple in Wilkes-Barre and at the 
Masonic Temple in Scranton, featuring Bee-
thoven’s Fifth Symphony and Schuman’s 
Piano Concerto in A Minor. 
In 1979, Hugh Wolff, educated at Harvard 
University and the Peabody Institute, took over 
the baton. Under Wolff’s direction, the orches-
tra soared to new heights and established its 
reputation as a prestigious symphony. In 
1982, the Philharmonic gained statewide rec-
ognition during a televised performance of a 
work commissioned for the Commonwealth’s 
tercentennial. During the early 1980s, the Phil-
harmonic also began to attract world renown 
guest artists. 
In 1986, Wolff left the symphony, and the 
board appointed London-Born and Cambridge- 
educated Hugh Keegan to the podium. Over 
14 seasons, he grew the orchestra into one of 
the country’s best regional orchestras with an 
impressively 
broad 
repertoire. 
Following 
Keegan’s tenure, the orchestra continued to 
thrive under the tutelage of Clyde Mitchell and 
later Lawrence Loh. 
Today, the orchestra continues to strive for 
and deliver the highest level of musical excel-
lence and remains the only fully professional 
symphony in the region. The Philharmonic 
also provides arts outreach and education to 
foster the next generation of musical talent. 
I am honored to join with the NEPA Phil-
harmonic to celebrate 50 years of making 
music in Northeastern Pennsylvania. I look for-
ward to seeing their future musical accom-
plishments, and I wish them great success as 
they continue to bring exceptional perform-
ances to our theaters and concert halls.

HONORING THE MEMORY OF LIFE-
TIME 
EDUCATOR, 
MARY 
CALTAGIRONE 
HON. KATHY CASTOR 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 8, 2022 
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in honor of the life and contributions 
of Mary Mortellaro Caltagirone, a beloved 
member of the Tampa Bay community, who 
passed away on April 7, 2022, at the age of 
99 after a lifetime of service as a devoted 
mother, educator and community volunteer. 
A Tampa native of Sicilian decent, Mary 
grew up attending local public schools before 
leaving home to attend college, a rarity for a 
woman of her background at that time. Mary 
attended 
college 
at 
Florida 
College 
for 
Women, now Florida State University, and 
graduated in three years with a Bachelor of 
Science in Spanish and Math in 1943. In addi-
tion to this, she earned a certificate in Elemen-
tary Education from the University of Tampa 
and was a member of three honor societies. 
Mary took all of the education and experience 
she gained and brought it back home to serve 
her community in Tampa. She went on to 
teach for 40 years in Hillsborough County pub-
lic schools at various grade levels and I am 
very grateful and proud to have been one of 
her students myself. 
Mary retired from teaching in 1983, though 
her promotion of education and her community 
involvement only grew from there. Honoring 
her Sicilian heritage and Ybor City roots, Mary 
was a founding member of Lucerna and its 
offshoot organization, Pan American University 
Women (PAUW), whose mission it is to unite 
women of Latin decent who are graduates of 
institutions of higher learning, to promote fel-
lowship, encourage education and profes-
sional accomplishments and to provide chari-
table contributions to the Tampa community. 
Mary served as a four-time president and was 
twice honored as PAUW Woman of the Year. 
Other community organizations and philan-
thropic involvements of hers included the 
Italian Club and their Ladies Auxiliary, Sons of 
Italy, St. John’s Presbyterian Church, Spanish 
Lyric Theater, Judea-Christian Health Clinic 
and the Ybor City Museum, where she 
amassed over 1000 hours of service! Mary’s 
incredible devotion to these groups was ex-
tremely appreciated by their community mem-
bers. In 2005, she was presented with the 
Italian Woman of Excellence Award for Cul-
tural and Civic Involvement and in 2007, she 
was named Person of the Year for Out-
standing Service by St. John’s Presbyterian 
Church. 
Mary was a truly selfless and loving indi-
vidual, and her legacy will continue to live 
through her sons Sam A. and Vincent G. 
Caltagirone (Sue), former daughters-in-law, 
Norma Tomasello Caltagirone and Carol Bond 
Caltagirone, nephews Vincent and Douglas 
Mortellaro (Tracy), cousin George Garcia 
(Bonnie), grandchildren, great-grandchildren 
and many more extended family. Her memory 
will truly be a blessing for her family, her stu-
dents and all in our Tampa Bay community 
who have known her, learned from her and 
worked alongside her. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of my neighbors 
in Tampa Bay and the citizens of Florida, I am 
proud to honor Mary Mortellaro Caltagirone for 
her lifelong dedication to education and for her 
demonstrations of service above self. All in 
our community are eternally grateful for her 
immense contributions. Her legacy will live on 
and inspire many others in the Tampa Bay 
community and beyond for years to come.

HONORING PASTOR ROBIN ROBIN-
SON FOR HER SERVICE TO KERN 
COUNTY, CALIFORNIA 
HON. KEVIN McCARTHY 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 8, 2022 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the outstanding leadership 
and proud legacy of community service of 
Pastor Robin Robinson of Bakersfield, Cali-
fornia. 
Born in Bakersfield and raised in Oklahoma, 
Pastor Robinson returned to her roots in Kern 
County when she was 15 years old, moving 
back to the Golden State to attend Arvin High 
School. After graduation, she went straight 
into the workforce, earning a California State 
contractor’s license to start out and becoming 
a small business owner within the oil industry. 
By age 26, Pastor Robinson joined Canyon 
Hills Church as Bus Director—a move that 
would alter the trajectory of both the church 
and Pastor Robinson’s life forever. 
Transformed by the word of God while at 
Canyon Hills Church, Pastor Robinson de-
cided to enroll in seminary and embark on a 
life of service. Upon graduation, she served as 
the church’s Children’s Pastor for ten years, 
sharing the Gospel with our community’s 
youth. Because of her dedication and devotion 
to the congregation, she later became the 
Outreach Pastor, the Junior High Pastor which 
she served as for 19 years, and then the Adult 
Ministries Pastor, helping to lead the con-
gregation with strength and compassion. 
In 2019, Pastor Robinson accepted an offer 
to lead CityServe Kern County, a nonprofit 
that helps connect and empower local church-
es to better support the needs of our commu-
nity. As the Community Development and 
Church Engagement Director, Pastor Robin-
son coordinated with businesses, local part-
ners, and 120 churches in Kern County to 
help the most vulnerable receive much-need-
ed food, secure housing, and obtain critical job

training. CityServe’s work grew tenfold during 
the coronavirus pandemic and in 2020, the or-
ganization provided over 150,000 meals and 
supplies to residents, due in large part to Pas-
tor Robinson’s work, which led to CityServe 
being recognized as the 2021 Nonprofit of the 
Year for California’s 16th Senate District. 
Throughout her life, Pastor Robinson has 
led with grace, humility, and a steadfast devo-
tion to God and community. Though she will 
be greatly missed in Bakersfield, I am con-
fident she will continue to uplift and transform 
the people around her. On behalf of the 23rd 
Congressional District of California, I would 
like to thank Pastor Robinson for her decades 
of service to our community and I wish her 
and Corby the very best as they enter this 
next chapter of life spending more time with 
their children, Casey and Haley, in Tulsa, 
Oklahoma.

RECOGNIZING 
WWII 
ARMY 
PRI-
VATE WALTER J. KOWALCZYK 
ON THE 78TH ANNIVERSARY OF 
D-DAY 
HON. BRIAN HIGGINS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 8, 2022 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor the sacrifices of Wal-
ter J. Kowalczyk, a U.S. Army Private who 
earned a Bronze Star, a Purple Heart, and a 
Presidential Unit Citation while serving in the 
battles following the Invasion of Normandy. 
Walter Kowalczyk was born in Niagara Falls 
in 1916 to Franciszek Kowalczyk and Sophie 
Smiech, Polish immigrants who had moved to 
the United States just a few years prior. Wal-
ter enlisted in the U.S. Army on April 23, 1941 
as part of the Third Battalion, 334th Regiment, 
of the 84th Infantry Division, more commonly 
known as the ‘‘Railsplitter’’ division. He served 
in the European Theater of Operations from 
December 8, 1944 until September 26, 1945, 
during which his unit supported troops in Nor-
mandy in the aftermath of D-Day. 
While serving as a paratrooper in Europe, 
Private Kowalczyk participated in the battles of 
Ardennes, Central Europe, and Rhineland. 
The campaign in Ardennes, otherwise referred 
to as the ‘‘Battle of the Bulge’’, was carried out 
from December 16, 1944 to January 25, 1945, 
and was the last German offensive which re-
sulted in tremendous loss of life. 
Later, Private Kowalczyk’s unit was awarded 
a Presidential Unit Citation for extraordinary 
heroism, gallantry, determination, and esprit 
de corps under unusually difficult and haz-
ardous conditions during the Battle of Rhine-
land where he was wounded in action. The ci-
tation notes that the unit was assigned to the 
mission spearheading the advance between 
the Roer and Rhine rivers. The battalion en-
countered and defeated considerable enemy 
resistance, but advanced 42 miles along the 
banks of the Rhine River in 12 days. During 
the advance they captured and defended a 
strategically important German town, as well 
as several other cities, towns, and villages. 
Despite little rest and aggressive attacks from 
the enemy, the Third Battalion, 334th Infan-
try’s conspicuous bravery and dauntless deter-
mination played a critical role in the Allied 
Forces advancement deep into Germany. 
Private 
Kowalczyk 
was 
honorably 
dis-
charged from the military on October 10, 1945 
after more than four years of service. After 
serving, he returned to Niagara County and 
worked for Tam Ceramics before retiring in 
1981. In Western New York he was a member 
of United Steel Workers, American Association 
of Retired Persons (AARP), Lewiston Fire 
Company No. 1, Power City Lodge, Italian 
Daughters and Sons of America, and St. 
Peter’s Church. An avid sportsman, he partici-
pated in the 3F Sportsmen’s Club and became 
a charter member of the North American Fish-
ing Club. Additionally, he was an active mem-
ber of the local veteran community, joining 
Portage Post 146 of the American Legion, the 
Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Loyal Order of 
the Moose, and the Polish Legion of American 
Veterans. 
Private Kowalczyk married Sophie Saleski 
with whom he had three children: Carol, Ches-
ter, and Paul. They also had four grand-
children: Sarah, Michael, Teresa, and Jac-
quelyn as well as greatgrandchildren: Geffory, 
Maylianna, and Antonio. Walter sadly passed 
away on November 12, 1993 with the shrapnel 
that resulted from enemy fire during the Battle 
of Rhineland still in his body. His legacy con-
tinued, however, as his son Chester and 
grandchildren Sarah and Michael all served in 
the U.S. Armed Forces. 
Madam Speaker, I take this moment to rec-
ognize the bravery of World War II Army Pri-
vate Walter J. Kowalczyk.

HONORING BETHLEHEM CHURCH 
NO. 1 AND 2 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 8, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable 
community church, Bethlehem Church No. 1 
and 2. 
The old Bethlehem No. 1 church was given 
in 1973 down on Porter’s Bayou. The founder 
of the Bayou was Anderson Robinson. The 
Robinson’s were the first Black family on the 
Bayou. A letter found written by Martin, re-
counts that several families suggested a plan 
to build a Brush Harbor Church in 1888, which 
was done. Shortly, thereafter, the Bethlehem 
Church No. 1 was built on land donated by 
Randall Miller and was pastored by Zachariah 
Coleman. The No. 2 church was bought from 
Jeff Arrington and a congregation was formed 
there in early 1890. The first pastor was Rev-
erend Williams, as mentioned in the letter. The 
last pastor of the Bethlehem Church No. 2 
was Reverend Clarence Hunt, who still lives in 
Cleveland, Mississippi. 
Bethlehem Church No. 2, an old Baptist 
church, was built in November of 1889. They 
closed in 2018 due to mold in the church and 
it was beyond repair. Unfortunately, there 
were no funds available for the needed re-
pairs, so the decision was made to shut its 
doors. There are eight church members who 
joined in with Bethlehem Church No. 1, which 
is equally historic, about a quarter mile down 
the road. 
When Bethlehem Church No. 2 closed its 
doors, the church only had a small congrega-
tion. There had been a disagreement within 
the church for approximately 20 years and 
many of the members left because of it. Ber-
nice Watts-Griffin, one of the eight people, left 
as congregants when Bethlehem No. 2 closed 
in 2018. She had been a member at Beth-
lehem Church No. 2 for over fifty years. The 
former church member said, ‘‘I was one of the 
first students to integrate Shaw Public Schools 
in the mid-1960’s and we had many Civil 
Rights activists in the congregation.’’ Mrs. Grif-
fin was a young girl during that time and do 
not remember any specific or historic meetings 
held during that time. 
Recently, there has been a discussion about 
trying to bet the church placed on a historic 
registry or named a historic site through the 
state. Hopefully, that comes to fruition. When 
asked what she would like to see happen to 
Bethlehem Church No. 2, Watts-Griffin said 
she wished the church would be formally de-
clared and recognized as a historic building. It 
is the wish of the former members of Beth-
lehem Church No. 2 that the property could be 
repaired, however the damages inside the 
church would be of tremendous cost. It is with 
honor and hope to commend the vision of 
such a remarkable church as Bethlehem 
Church No. 2, where history is still standing. 
Although, they have joined with Bethlehem 
Church No. 1, the churches will continue to 
serve the community through service and 
commitment that has sustained the Bethlehem 
Church No. 2 family throughout this journey, 
and whose venture is a testament to God’s 
promise of success and longevity to those 
who diligently seek Him and obey His will. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Bethlehem Church No. 2 for 
their dedication to serving their members and 
community.

SPECIAL RECOGNITION OF AUSTIN 
KOHLHOFER ON HIS OFFER OF 
APPOINTMENT TO ATTEND THE 
UNITED

HON. ROBERT E. LATTA 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 8, 2022 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, it is my great 
pleasure to pay special tribute to an out-
standing student from Ohio’s Fifth Congres-
sional District. I am pleased to announce that 
Austin Kohlhofer of Delta, Ohio, has been of-
fered an appointment to the United States Mili-
tary Academy in West Point, New York. 
Austin’s offer of appointment permits him to 
attend the United States Military Academy this 
fall with the incoming Class of 2026. Attending 
one of our nation’s military academies offers 
the opportunity to serve our country and re-
ceive a world-class education. At the same 
time, these young men and women undertake 
one of the most challenging and rewarding ex-
periences of their lives. 
Austin brings a tremendous amount of lead-
ership, service, and dedication to the incoming 
Class of 2026. While attending Delta High 
School in Delta, Ohio, Austin participated in 
student government and was on the honor roll. 
Throughout high school, Austin was involved

IN RECOGNITION OF PAUL J. SASS 
HON. SAM GRAVES 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 8, 2022 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize my long-time staffer, 
Paul Sass, as he marks his last week on Cap-
itol Hill after more than 20 years. 
Every Member knows that nothing would get 
done around here if it weren’t for the dedica-
tion and commitment of our staff. I have 
served in Congress for 22 years, and I have 
had a lot of great staff over that time. Paul has 
worked for me in a variety of different roles 
over the course of his Capitol Hill career, in 
both my Congressional Office and the two 
committees I have had the privilege of leading. 
Paul is my longest serving staffer and is un-
questionably one of the best and capable 
staffers I’ve ever had. 
In 2002, I hired Paul fresh out of college as 
a Staff Assistant, where he was tasked with 
making the coffee and answering the phones. 
And as I like to remind him, he was our third 
choice for the job at the time. Despite that, 
Paul was determined to prove himself, and he 
quickly climbed the ranks of my legislative 
team, rising to Legislative Director and eventu-
ally to Deputy Chief of Staff. 
After I was elected by my colleagues to 
serve as the Republican Leader of the Small 
Business Committee, Paul served there as my 
Deputy Staff Director from 2009 to 2015. After 
my time as Chairman was done, I asked Paul 
to return to my personal office as Chief of 
Staff to help lead my internal campaign to suc-
ceed my friend Bill Shuster as Republican 
leader of the Transportation and Infrastructure 
Committee. In 2019, I was fortunate enough to 
be elected to that position, and it was an obvi-
ous choice to ask Paul to come with me again 
and lead the Republican Committee staff as 
Staff Director. And for the last three and a half 
years, he has done a fantastic job. 
During this time, Paul oversaw and led our 
staff in negotiations on multiple bipartisan, bi-
cameral legislative efforts of great con-
sequence to our Nation, many of which were 
signed into law. He has worked on two Water 
Resources Development Acts; an aircraft cer-
tification bill, which was crafted in response to 
two major international aviation accidents; the 
CARES Act, which was the first major com-
prehensive legislative response to the COVID– 
19 pandemic and included significant support 
targeted toward the transportation industry; 
two Coast Guard reauthorizations; and efforts 
to reauthorize the surface transportation pro-
grams. 
While Paul’s accomplishments are not lim-
ited to legislative achievements and bills 
signed into law, they do represent some of the 
very real and tangible impacts his 20-year ca-
reer of public service has had on our Nation. 
If you asked Paul, he would say his real leg-
acy and career accomplishments are best 
measured by the relationships he has devel-
oped over the past two decades—from those 
he served under and beside at the beginning 
of his career—to those he has since hired, 
mentored, and guided in their own careers. 
And even to those he met extending his 
Hartwick College baseball career into a ‘‘leg-
endary’’ softball career as part of the Lawn 
Wranglers and Owego dynasties, coaching the 
Republican Congressional baseball team, or 
just talking politics over a beer at the storied, 
now sadly shuttered, Capitol Lounge, without 
a doubt, Paul has put his imprint on the of-
fices, committees, policies, and colleagues 
across Capitol Hill he’s been involved with 
throughout his career, and we are all better for 
it. 
As Paul enters the next phase of his al-
ready-successful career, I thank him for stick-
ing with me for over 20 years. I thank him for 
his advice and guidance. And I thank him for 
his loyalty and friendship. When I look back at 
my Capitol Hill service, it is those dedicated 
staffers like Paul that I am most thankful for in 
helping me address the needs of Missouri’s 
Sixth District and the Nation at large. I thank 
Paul and I wish him continued success in his 
next endeavors.

COVID–19 EIDL FRAUD STATUTE 
OF LIMITATIONS ACT OF 2022 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 7, 2022 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I 
stand in support of H.R. 7334, the ‘‘COVID–19 
EIDL Fraud Statute of Limitations Act of 
2022,’’ to establish a 10-year timeframe during 
which those who defrauded the government in 
unlawful receipt of Economic Injury Disaster 
Loans can be brought to justice. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has robbed our 
nation of over one million souls. 
It has taken from us mothers and fathers, 
children and siblings, friends and neighbors. 
For every tragic death there are countless 
others for whom the world now holds a space 
that can never be filled. 
When the pandemic first arrived on our soil, 
Congress acted quickly to provide Economic 
Injury Disaster Loans to small businesses 
across the country. 
Thanks to these loans—in the face of fear, 
loss, and uncertainty—our nation’s business 
owners kept their doors open. 
They provided meals, manufactured PPE, 
served in non-profits, and safeguarded the 
color, culture, and economic security of Amer-
ica’s towns and cities. 
While struggling with their own losses, hard-
ships, and grief these small business owners 
supported their employees and their commu-
nities. 
Through our EIDL funding they kept our na-
tion running. 
To imagine that some would take advantage 
of the necessary relief provided by our govern-
ment for self-serving gains is abhorrent and 
shameful. 
In New York City, one man defrauded the 
American taxpayers of over $180,000 in Eco-
nomic Injury Disaster Relief funds—and spent 
it at Saks Fifth Avenue. 
A couple in Connecticut used the relief not 
to keep their hair salon open or pay employ-
ees—but to buy investment properties in Flor-
ida. 
One man, right here in Washington D.C. 
stole money that should have been used to 
keep our small businesses afloat and instead 
bankrolled his own yacht and million dollar row 
house. 
While millions of people were dying across 
the country these people chose to look out for 
their own self-interest. 
Today, we hold them accountable to the law 
and to the American people. 
That is why I place my support behind the 
addition of a 10-year statute of limitations for 
criminal and civil charges against COVID–19 
Economic Injury Disaster Loans fraud. 
We owe it to those who did right by their 
businesses, their employees, and their com-
munity. 
We owe it to the American people. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in voting for H.R. 7334 to ensure that 
anyone who wrongfully abused small business 
COVID relief be held accountable.

FOOD AND DRUG AMENDMENTS OF 
2022 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 7, 2022 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of H.R. 7667, the ‘‘Food and Drug 
Amendments Act of 2022,’’ which will reau-
thorize user fees for prescription drugs, med-
ical devices, generic drugs, and biosimilar 
products from fiscal 2023 through 2027. 
Congress has successfully supported the re-
authorization of this important legislation with 
bi-partisan support for over 80 years. 
We must continue in our efforts to generate 
guidance and regulation on the healthcare 
products and pharmaceutical drugs available 
to the American people we serve. 
Let it be known, however, that today, the 
117th Congress brings forward new require-
ments of racial and cultural diversity. 
In addition to providing reauthorization for 
pharmaceutical drug, equipment, and trial 
funding, H.R. 7667 recognizes the millions of 
Americans who are racial and ethnic minorities 
who have been too long mistreated by medical 
trials and studies—to the detriment of our 
health. 
Today we add amendments to this Act that 
will ensure medical care reflects people across 
all groups so that we may receive healthcare 
that is developed and designed to serve us. 
The law that we are reauthorizing today will 
require pharmaceutical manufacturers to sub-
mit to the Secretary of Health and Human 
Services detailed Diversity Action Plans. 
These plans must outline their initiatives to 
include in clinical studies participants across 
various subgroups including: age, sex, geo-
graphic location, socio-economic status, eth-
nicity and race. 
America has an ugly history of racialized 
medical testing.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E600 
June 8, 2022 
As I am sure many of you know, People of 
Color, Black people specifically, have been 
used and abused by the American medical 
system. 
White doctors once claimed that Black pa-
tients couldn’t feel pain—so they used us as 
medical experiments. 
J. Marion Sims, the ‘‘father of gynecology’’ 
perfected his craft by repeatedly slicing open 
enslaved Black women for painful medical sur-
geries without anesthesia. 
On one unmedicated woman, he performed 
30 surgeries. 
For forty years—until 1972—Black men in 
Tuskegee, Alabama were studied and experi-
mented on without their consent. 
Out of 600 men, over 120 died from what 
was a treatable disease. 
In yesteryear, People of Color were treated 
as expendable research material. 
In recent times, we have been left out of 
medical trials entirely. 
When Moderna first began research for their 
life-saving COVID–19 vaccine, it was discov-
ered that Black participants made up only 7 
percent of their clinical trial despite making up 
twice that percentage nationally. 
This is not an isolated problem. 
Nationally, though People of Color make up 
about 39 percent of the U.S. population, we 
are represented by only 2 percent to 16 per-
cent of patients in trials. 
Nearly 50 percent of the residents of Hous-
ton are People of Color. 
We are parents, children, siblings, and loved 
ones. 
We 
are 
front-line 
workers, 
educators, 
healthcare providers, and servicemen and 
women. 
We deserve more. 
We deserve better. 
We deserve to receive medications and to 
use life-saving medical tools that are designed 
and developed with the people’s specific 
needs in mind. 
H.R. 7667 will work to rectify this inequity in 
the United States’ Health Care system through 
mandatory Diversity Action Plans, Educational 
Workshops and Accountability Reports. 
In addition to its vital diversity initiatives, 
‘‘The Food and Drug Amendments Act of 
2022’’ establishes tools to seek out new and 
innovative technology to better meet the 
needs of the American people. 
The Secretary of Health and Human Serv-
ices will establish National Centers of Excel-
lence in Advanced and Continuous Pharma-
ceutical Manufacturing to design, develop, and 
implement better and more efficient pharma-
ceuticals. 
H.R. 7667 will accelerate the development 
of drugs needed in rapid response situations 
like the COVID–19 pandemic, supply chain 
disruptions, and other large scale medical 
emergencies. 
As we have learned over the last two and 
a half years of this pandemic, now is the time 
to prepare for whatever tomorrow might bring. 
These 
developments 
will 
help 
our 
healthcare system get ahead of national med-
ical needs before they become crises. 
This Act will arm America with a strong 
medical foundation in technological and med-
ical advancement for our future, and will en-
courage clinical trials that better represent the 
face of America. 
Madam Speaker, it is a privilege to continue 
in the decades long bipartisan support for the 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and 
the amendments provided in ‘‘The Food and 
Drug Amendments Act of 2022.’’ 
I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for 
H.R. 7667 to provide for a better and more eq-
uitable medical future for our country.

SENATE COMMITTEE MEETINGS 
Title IV of Senate Resolution 4, 
agreed to by the Senate of February 4,
