PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick 
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: 
God of heaven and Earth, thank You 
for giving us another day. 
The Nation awakes to reports of ris-
ing coronavirus numbers, many in 
places once touted as being safe from 
the danger of spread. Have mercy on 
us. Help us to hear Your call to leave 
pride and boasting behind and together 
face a most dangerous threat to the 
health and well-being of our citizens. 
Continue to bless and protect those 
men and women who have been bur-
dened for so long with the care of the 
infected, even as they are asked to 
make more bricks with less straw. As 
hospitals fill, empower those given the 
responsibility to lead with wisdom and 
practical insights to rise to the de-
mands of their leadership. 
May all that is done be for Your 
greater honor and glory. 
Amen.

S4679 
Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, AUGUST 4, 2020 
No. 138 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal Spirit, to whom we must give 
and account for all our powers and 
privileges, guide the Members of this 
body so that they will be faithful stew-
ards of Your will. 
Lord, open their minds and hearts to 
know and do Your bidding, teaching 
them to rely on Your strength and to 
serve You with honor. Help them to 
discover in their daily work the joy of 
a partnership with You. Use them to 
bring good news to the marginalized, to 
comfort the brokenhearted, and to an-
nounce that captives will be released 
and the shackled will be freed. 
May our Senators depend upon the 
power of Your prevailing providence, 
for You are the author and finisher of 
our faith. 
We pray in Your great Name. Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
HYDE-SMITH). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
ABSENTEE VOTING 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
Iowa’s secretary of state Paul Pate will 
mail an absentee ballot request form to 
every registered Iowa voter for the No-
vember election. This is a request 
form, not a ballot, being mailed out to 
everybody. 
Iowa’s current absentee ballot sys-
tem allows anyone who wants to vote 
by mail the option to do so. Just send 
in the request form when you receive 
it, or you may download it online, but 
if Iowans prefer to vote in person, that 
remains their choice. 
There has been a lot of misinforma-
tion claiming that some massive, Fed-
eral intervention is needed to allow 
citizens to vote by mail. This isn’t true 
in Iowa or elsewhere. Every State has 
vote-by-mail, and 16 States ask for a 
reason, such as being over 65, for exam-
ple, but most have waived or loosened 
this requirement. 
Some groups are now using the pan-
demic to push for a Federal mandate 
on States to adopt a new, universal 
vote-by-mail system overnight. It took 
5 years when Washington State imple-
mented voting by mail. Requiring 
every State to replace its current vot-
ing system with a whole new, central-
ized, mail-only system this close to our 
November election is a recipe for dis-
aster. In such a system, every reg-
istered voter, including those who have 
died or moved away, would automati-
cally be mailed a ballot with no voting 
in person. 
Every Iowan who wants to vote ab-
sentee in November can do so, and 
those who want to vote in person can 
also do so safely. It is a voter’s choice 
and should remain so. 
I yield the floor. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
HEALS ACT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
another day has come and gone in this 
once-in-a-century national battle for 
our country. 
Yesterday, more of our neighbors had 
to say goodbye to loved ones whose 
lives were claimed by this virus. Yes-
terday, more doctors and more nurses 
worked long shifts on the frontlines, 
fighting to heal strangers and limit the 
national death toll that now exceeds 
150,000. 
Yesterday, 
more 
workers 
brought home pink slips, and more 
Main Street businesses saw the end of 
their PPP lifelines fast approaching. 
Yesterday, more laid-off Americans 
filed new claims for unemployment in-
surance or lay awake wondering about 
next month’s rent. Yesterday, more 
school officials wondered what to tell 
parents, students, and teachers about 
September. 
What happened here in the Capitol 
yesterday? With the American people 
fighting all of these battles and more, 
what did the Speaker of the House and 
the Democratic leader do with yet an-
other day of deliberations? Yet again, 
it was the exact same refrain. It never 
seems to change: We are feeling opti-
mistic. We spoke very politely to the 
administration, but we are still no-
where close on the substance. 
It has now been more than a week 
since Senate Republicans released a se-
rious proposal for another major rescue 
package—$1 trillion for kids, jobs, and 
healthcare. The Democrats are block-
ing it all. It is like they expect ap-
plause for merely keeping a civil tone 
with the President’s team—never mind 
they are still obstructing any action 
for our country. 
Senate Republicans want to revive a 
Federal add-on to unemployment in-
surance, which the Democratic leader 
would not let us extend last week. We 
want to send another round of direct 
checks straight into families’ pockets. 
We want to supply generous, new in-
centives for rehiring American workers 
and workplace safety. We want to send 
historic money to schools for reopening 
and invest even more in testing and 
vaccine research. We want legal protec-
tions so schools, churches, charities, 
and businesses can reopen.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4680 
August 4, 2020 
The Democrats say they want many 
of the same things. I certainly believe 
that many of my Democratic col-
leagues who serve as ranking members 
want many of the same things and 
could easily find common ground with 
our chairmen if the Democratic leader 
would let them talk. Instead, we have 
gotten a full week of the Speaker of 
the House’s and the Democratic lead-
er’s shutting out all of their own Mem-
bers and refusing to move an inch off of 
demands that everyone knows are out-
landish. 
The Democratic leaders want the en-
tirety of their massive, far-left wish 
list—all of it. Speaker PELOSI is still 
agitating for strange, new special in-
terest carve-outs for the marijuana in-
dustry—even claiming they are COVID- 
related. She said that, with respect to 
this virus, marijuana is ‘‘a therapy 
that has proven successful.’’ You can’t 
make this up. I hope she shared her 
breakthrough with Dr. Fauci. In the 
other corner, Leader SCHUMER is still 
demanding massive tax cuts for rich 
people in blue States or he won’t let 
any relief become law. 
These are the kinds of nongermane 
pet projects that our Democratic col-
leagues are demanding—not a dime for 
kids, jobs, and healthcare unless the 
administration let’s them check off 
every leftwing lobbyist’s Christmas list 
5 months early. 
Let’s listen to what Speaker PELOSI’s 
own House Democrats said about this 
bill when they passed it. Here is what 
House Democrats said about the bill 
that Speaker PELOSI and the Demo-
cratic leader now say is their absolute 
redline: 
One quote: ‘‘The partisan nature and 
wide scope of this bill make it doomed 
upon arrival in the Senate.’’ 
Another 
quote: 
‘‘In 
response 
to 
COVID–19, our relief efforts must be 
targeted, timely, and transparent. The 
HEROES Act does not meet those 
standards.’’ 
Another quote: ‘‘This isn’t a plan; it’s 
a wish list.’’ 
Another quote: ‘‘Partisan gamesman-
ship.’’ 
Another quote: ‘‘Some in my own 
party . . . have decided to use this 
package as an opportunity to make po-
litical statements and propose a bill 
that goes far beyond pandemic relief 
and has no chance at becoming law, 
further declaring the help so many 
need.’’ 
Those are quotes from House Demo-
crats’ views about the so-called Heroes 
Act, but now the entire thing is the 
price of admission for giving hard-hit 
Americans any more aid. 
What worked back in March with the 
CARES Act were productive and good- 
faith conversations between chairmen 
and ranking members—a bipartisan 
process led by Members. 
But this time, the Speaker and the 
Democratic leader have forbidden their 
Members from negotiating at all. The 
ranking member on HELP cannot even 
discuss testing with Chairman ALEX-
ANDER. The ranking member on Small 
Business cannot even discuss PPP with 
Chairman RUBIO
and Chairman COL-
LINS. 
No, no; the Speaker and the Demo-
cratic leader only want themselves at 
the table so that behind closed doors 
they can say that nobody gets another 
dime of Federal unemployment money; 
nobody gets extra school funding; and 
nobody gets more money for testing 
and PPE unless they burn cash on 1,000 
unrelated things. 
I am talking about things like stim-
ulus checks for illegal immigrants; a 
trillion-dollar slush fund for States, 
even though States and localities have 
only spent a quarter of the money we 
sent them in March. Let me say that 
again—a trillion-dollar slush fund for 
States, even though States and local-
ities have only spent a quarter of the 
money we sent them in March. In my 
State, the State administration only 
spent 6 percent of the money we sent 
them—6 percent—diversity and inclu-
sion studies, a soil health program, and 
on and on and on. 
The House bill does all these things 
while completely forgetting a second 
round of the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram—no second round for PPP—and 
sending less money for schools than 
the Senate bill. 
This is what they will not budge 
from. And every day the script is the 
same, and the script is: We had a pleas-
ant conversation, but we don’t feel like 
making a deal. Maybe tomorrow. 
Here is the problem: Every day the 
Democratic leaders repeat the same 
act here in the Capitol, they are letting 
down the struggling people who need 
our help. Day after day, Americans are 
trying to stay above water—layoffs, 
benefit cuts, threats of eviction, the 
possibility of losing a family business 
forever, towns wondering if their Main 
Streets will ever come back, school 
principals with no idea what to tell 
communities. 
That is the reality in Kentucky and 
in all 50 States, and none of these peo-
ple are helped one bit, not one bit, by 
the Democratic leaders’ charade. 
What American families need is an 
outcome, a bipartisan result. Senate 
Republicans have had a roadmap sit-
ting on the table for more than a week. 
We didn’t put every Republican wish 
list item in history into an 1,800-page 
encyclopedia and insist on starting 
there. 
We built a serious starting place 
based on the bipartisan programs we 
passed back in March—unanimously, 
by the way—and what the country 
needs now. 
If our colleagues across the aisle 
would do the same—frankly, if our col-
leagues across the aisle were even al-
lowed—allowed to take part in the dis-
cussions, we could get this done for our 
country. We did it in March. We could 
do it again, but both sides have to ac-
tually want it. 
RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the leadership time 
is reserved. 
f 
EXECUTIVE SESSION 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will pro-
ceed to executive session and resume 
consideration of the following nomina-
tion, which the clerk will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read the nomination of Mark Wesley 
Menezes, of Virginia, to be Deputy Sec-
retary of Energy. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Democratic leader is recognized. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
just listened to my friend the Repub-
lican leader. The Republican leader is 
so tied in a knot by his own caucus and 
his President that all he can do is give 
Alice-in-Wonderland, partisan speech-
es. All he can do is threaten to force 
sham votes that will not pass and will 
not answer the anguished cries for help 
that are coming from so many of our 
fellow Americans. 
On the other hand, over the weekend 
and yesterday, Speaker PELOSI and I 
continued our negotiations with the 
White House on the next phase of 
COVID-relief legislation. After a week 
of stalled talks because Republicans 
could not articulate a position on hard-
ly anything, I believe we are making 
progress. We came closer together on 
several issues; however, we remain far 
apart on a number of issues, but we are 
finally moving in the right direction. 
At the moment, the gap between our 
two parties in the negotiations is about 
priorities and about scale. As this huge 
crisis engulfs our Nation, Democrats 
believe we need a bold, strong, and vig-
orous response from the Federal Gov-
ernment. It will take a lot of resources, 
but if we don’t commit those resources 
now, for sure the costs will only grow 
in the months to come. 
Democrats are fighting to meet the 
needs of a desperate nation. Our Repub-
lican 
friends, 
however—President 
Trump, his aides, and the Republicans 
in the Senate—do not seem to appre-
ciate the gravity of the situation. They 
do not understand the needs of the 
country that are so great, and they are 
not stepping up to meet those needs. 
This disease has washed over our coun-
try like a great flood, and Republicans

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

August 4, 2020 
are acting as if we need to fix a leaky 
faucet. 
Some of our Republican friends seem 
to be going through the motions, con-
tent to pass a bill—any bill so they can 
check a box and go home—but a bill 
that doesn’t come close to meeting the 
needs of America. We cannot do that. 
We cannot pass an inadequate bill and 
then go home while the virus continues 
to spread, the economy continues to 
deteriorate, 
and 
the 
country 
gets 
worse. No box checking will work. We 
need real action. 
We need a relief package that actu-
ally rescues American families, Amer-
ican schools, and American businesses; 
that helps defeat this evil virus and 
prevents our economy from sliding into 
a depression. Democrats are going to 
keep fighting until we get there. 
Republicans on both ends of Pennsyl-
vania Avenue are not yet awake to the 
enormity of the challenge, and we see 
it across a whole range of issues. 
For example, Democrats believe we 
have an obligation to help every Amer-
ican put food on the table. Our Repub-
lican friends start negotiating by say-
ing they don’t think we need to do any-
thing to help hungry families and chil-
dren, but maybe they can compromise 
and help feed a small percentage. That 
is not going to cut it. Let’s say 1 mil-
lion families can’t feed their kids. The 
Republican bill has zero, and we cover 
all 1 million. To say ‘‘Let’s compromise 
and only cover half of them’’ is cruel 
and not going to solve the problem. 
We want to see all our schools reopen 
in the fall, but they need the resources 
and guidance to do it safely—not 25 
percent of the resources, not half. 
Schools need funding for masks and 
PPE, for converting space into more 
socially distant classrooms, for updat-
ing their ventilating systems. Some 
need to double the number of buses to 
keep from packing kids together on the 
morning route to school. It is going to 
cost money, and the Republicans have 
to understand that. Parents must have 
confidence that if their school is going 
to reopen, it has the protocols and in-
frastructure in place to keep their chil-
dren safe. 
It is the same with unemployment. 
Over 50 million Americans have filed 
for unemployment with millions more 
filing new claims each week. We pro-
posed extending the enhanced unem-
ployment benefits that Democrats se-
cured in the CARES Act through the 
end of the year. The policy has kept as 
many as 12 million Americans out of 
poverty and boosted consumer spend-
ing—one of the few bright spots in our 
economy. But Republicans are intent 
on slashing those benefits or letting 
them expire long before the crisis is 
over. One Republican proposal would 
give newly out-of-work Americans a 30- 
percent pay cut; another would give 
them a 33-percent pay cut. 
The Trump administration’s own De-
partment of Labor warned us that 
these proposals, which would pay a per-
centage of a worker’s former wage, are 
patently 
unworkable. 
It 
will 
take 
weeks and months if we adopt the Re-
publican proposal before any checks 
wind up in the hands of millions of 
Americans, and our State unemploy-
ment offices that administer this pro-
gram agree. 
So Republicans need to step up to the 
plate and work with us to find a solu-
tion that shields millions of jobless 
Americans 
from 
further 
economic 
hardship. State, local, and Tribal gov-
ernments have fought this evil virus on 
their frontlines with budgets strained. 
They are at risk of shedding teachers, 
firefighters, 
bus 
drivers, 
sanitation 
workers, slashing public services. 
My good friend Senator CARPER is 
leading a group of Democratic Senators 
to talk about these issues today be-
cause Senate Republicans and the 
White House do not believe in giving 
support to our State and local govern-
ments. That is not an abstract concept. 
Again, these are firefighters and teach-
ers and bus drivers and healthcare 
workers. We don’t care if they are a 
blue State or red State; they need the 
help. 
We must also address our elections 
and make sure that Americans can 
vote safely and confidently with the 
new challenges of coronavirus for the 
first time in a national election. That 
means they need to be able to vote in- 
person and by mail, whichever they 
choose. Adequate funding for State 
election systems in the post office 
shouldn’t be a partisan issue. This is 
about preserving elections, making 
them fair, making every ballot count. 
That is the wellspring of our democ-
racy, and it is COVID-related, and our 
Republican friends are resisting. 
We are still fighting to get enough 
funding for testing and contact trac-
ing. It is extraordinarily frustrating 
that 7 months into this crisis Demo-
crats still have to argue with our Re-
publican colleagues about delivering 
enough support for testing, contact 
tracing, Medicaid, and our healthcare 
system. 
These are just some of the many 
issues we need to work through. When 
people ask ‘‘What is holding things 
up?’’ it is our view that not only are 
our Republican friends disorganized 
and all over the lot, not only is Presi-
dent Trump tweeting about so many 
different things but not taking any 
leadership in this crisis but, most of 
all, that we must meet the needs of 
this enormous crisis and really help 
the American people. We need a strong, 
robust bill. We are working hard for 
that. Our Republican colleagues, inch 
by inch, are beginning to see the light. 
I hope more of them will. 
There are so many issues we must 
work through. Democrats want to get a 
deal done, but we need answers for all 
of them—not just a few. We can’t pick 
out one or two: Oh, we will help schools 
but not kids who need food. That 
doesn’t work. That doesn’t work. We 
will help small businesses but not the 
unemployed. That doesn’t work. 
We have a big, broad, huge crisis—the 
greatest health crisis in 100 years, the 
greatest economic crisis since the 
Great Depression—and we have a lot of 
Herbert Hoovers over here who don’t 
want to do anything—a lot of Herbert 
Hoovers on the Republican side. Well, 
remember what happened then: By not 
meeting the crisis head-on, they cre-
ated the Great Depression—the Repub-
licans did—under Hoover. Let’s hope 
our Republican friends see the light 
and won’t make that same mistake 
again. 
Let me remind my Republican col-
leagues, when there is a crisis of this 
magnitude, the private sector cannot 
solve it. Individuals alone, even with 
courage and sacrifice, are not powerful 
enough to beat it back. Government is 
the only force large enough to staunch 
the bleeding and begin the healing of 
the Nation. 
One of the main reasons holding 
things back—there are so many Repub-
licans on the other side who do not be-
lieve the Federal Government even has 
a role to play. Leader MCCONNELL has 
admitted not once, not twice, not three 
times, but four times that there are as 
many as 20 Senate Republicans who 
will vote against any relief package for 
the American people. 
Those Republicans, who seem to be 
the tail that wags the dog—and it is a 
pretty big tail with over 20 votes— 
those Republicans don’t get it. We 
know you like the private sector over 
government, but there are times when 
there is nothing but government that 
can step up to the plate and solve the 
problem, and this is one of those times. 
Faced with the greatest economic 
threat in 75 years, the greatest public 
health crisis in a century, more than a 
third of the Senate Republican major-
ity will not vote for anything to help 
the American people. Those very same 
Republicans gleefully voted to give a 
$1.5 trillion tax cut to help giant cor-
porations pad their profit margins, but 
helping Americans put food on the 
table, go back to school safely, keep a 
roof over their heads, and survive a 
global pandemic—that is a bridge too 
far. How out of touch can they be? 
These folks cannot be allowed to dic-
tate our policy. By their own admis-
sion, they will not vote for anything. 
Remember that when Leader MCCON-
NELL claims that Senate Democrats are 
the obstacles to progress. More than 
one-third of the Senate Republican 
caucus doesn’t want to vote for any-
thing. 
This week, our Republican colleagues 
have two choices. They can engage in 
the same kind of political theater that 
preluded 
the 
CARES 
Act. 
Leader 
MCCONNELL can schedule a show vote 
on legislation that even his own caucus 
will not support and, again, in his 
Alice-in-Wonderland style, get up on 
the floor and say that Democrats are 
the ones blocking it. He can engage in 
the same partisan maneuvers that have 
resulted in failure and won’t answer 
the anguished cries of Americans.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4682 
August 4, 2020 
As I said earlier—and I want to re-
peat it—the Republican leader is so 
tied in a knot by his own caucus and 
this President that one of his only op-
tions is to give Alice-in-Wonderland, 
partisan speeches and maybe force a 
sham vote that will not pass and will 
not answer the anguished cries for help 
from so many Americans. 
On the other hand, Senate Repub-
licans could roll up their sleeves, wake 
up to the crisis in our country, and fig-
ure out what they can support. I think 
we are all ready for the Republican ma-
jority to figure out just what that is. 
What is dictating our policy and our 
positions on the Democratic side is 
very simple: the national need—large, 
large, large. That is our North Star, 
and we are going to keep pressing for-
ward with the hard work of negotia-
tions, hopeful that we can get a deal 
done to help the country in a time of 
severe crisis. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I 
have a recommendation for my col-
leagues in the Senate. I recommend, as 
the Senator from New York does, that 
they go home—literally, leave Wash-
ington, go home, and meet up with the 
people who sent them to Washington to 
work for them. 
I did last Friday, as I do every week-
end. I asked specifically to meet with 
five individuals who are out of work. I 
wanted them to tell me their story and 
to share that story with the people of 
Chicago. It was quite a moving experi-
ence. 
We have 800,000 Illinoisans who are 
claiming unemployment. Now there is 
a possibility that the $600 a week Fed-
eral benefit that was coming to them 
to help pay their bills will disappear. 
Technically, it ended last Friday. 
So I asked these unemployed Illi-
noisans 
to 
tell 
me 
their 
story. 
Roushaunda Williams told me a story 
about being a bartender for 19 years at 
the Palmer House Hilton before being 
laid off in March. She earned signifi-
cantly more while working than she is 
receiving in unemployment. She is lit-
erally worried she is going to lose her 
home and healthcare if she loses that 
$600 a week. 
Andres Moreno worked at a res-
taurant in downtown Chicago before 
the pandemic. He was pretty proud of 
his career, working in the restaurant 
business. He said: I did well. He and his 
husband have both lost their jobs and 
their health insurance. Without the ad-
ditional $600 a week in unemployment 
compensation, they will not be able to 
even buy health coverage. 
Aileen Dimery is an interesting per-
son. She is in lighting technology. Her 
job involves big events. They set up the 
lights for concerts and other gath-
erings for thousands of people. She 
said: Nobody knows I am there, but I 
do. I am one of the first women who 
has ever been in this profession. 
Well, those big concerts and crowded 
venues aren’t there anymore. Aileen 
doesn’t have anyplace to go back to. 
She said one thing that still sticks 
with me. She said: I started working 
when I was 15. I worked 36 years. You 
know how many weeks, Senator, that I 
have had on unemployment in my 36- 
year work experience? 
I said: No. 
She said: One. This notion that I 
would rather stay home and draw un-
employment than go back to work, 
that isn’t who I am. I have proven over 
a lifetime that I am not someone who 
really doesn’t want to earn their pay. 
Her enhanced unemployment, if it ex-
pires, would mean that her bills—in-
cluding paying rent—just can’t be paid. 
Jesus Morales worked at the Drake 
Hotel in Chicago for 33 years and made 
up to $1,700 a week. He reminds me that 
I met him 20 years ago when he was a 
bartender and a waiter at an event that 
I attended. Well, he has been laid off 
since March, and without the $600 pay-
ment, he is afraid he will not be able to 
make his mortgage payment, and the 
COBRA payment, which covers his 
health insurance for his family, would 
be impossible. 
Samantha Arce is a mother of three. 
She just gave birth a few weeks before 
the lockdown began. Her place of work 
is closed, and her fiance has lost his 
job. They quickly went from two work-
ing parents with three kids to no work-
ing parents. Enhanced unemployment 
payments help them pay hospital bills 
and care for their young kids. She 
brought her little boy. He is about 4 or 
5 months old—cute little fellow. He 
smiled throughout the whole event. 
Little did he know what was going on 
in the minds of his mom and dad as 
they try to cope with the political deci-
sions being made in Washington. 
Losing that $600-a-week payment, 
which the Republicans have proposed, 
would really create a devastating situ-
ation for these families and these indi-
viduals. I hear regularly and have 
heard it for a long time—there is this 
notion that if you are unemployed, you 
are just not trying hard enough. There 
are jobs out there, they say. 
Well, that is not what the numbers 
tell us. There are four unemployed 
Americans for every available job— 
four for every available job. And em-
ployers who say: Well, if so-and-so 
would come back to work, but they are 
making too much on unemployment— 
of course, that is the case in some in-
stances, but it is rare. Did you know 
that of the Americans who have gone 
back to work since we began this pan-
demic assault, of those who have gone 
back to work, 70 percent are making 
less than they made on unemployment? 
Well, why would they make that eco-
nomic decision to go back to work and 
make less than unemployment? 
Well, it is just like Aileen. They are 
workers. At their heart, they are work-
ers. No. 1, they believe in the dignity of 
work; they are proud of what they do; 
and they want to go back to doing it. 
No. 2, they know unemployment is not 
forever. No. 3, sometimes there are 
benefits when you go back to work 
that really count, like the health in-
surance policy that had the doctor and 
the hospital which you and your family 
need. 
In June, the Illinois unemployment 
rate dropped to 14.6 percent, and the 
State added 142,000 jobs, but that un-
employment rate of 14.6 percent is the 
greatest we have faced since the great 
recession. 
Since 
the 
beginning 
of 
March, around 1.7 million unemploy-
ment claims had been filed in our State 
of a little less than 13 million people. 
That is nearly 10 times the number of 
claims processed during the same pe-
riod a year ago. The same thing is true 
in neighboring States like Kentucky, 
where the unemployment claims are 10 
times what they were a year ago. 
Nationwide, around 30 million Ameri-
cans are relying on enhanced unem-
ployment benefits just to keep things 
together. Trust me, they tell me. We 
are not saving this money. We are not 
investing this money. We are spending 
this money as fast as it is handed to us 
to pay for our home, our car, utilities, 
and food. 
The Republican approach would cut 
the unemployment benefit check from 
the Federal Government from $600 a 
week to $200 a week—a $400 cut. It 
would then require States to put in 
place a complex system of 70 percent 
wage replacement. It sounds so logical 
that if you are unemployed, you get 70 
percent of your paycheck. 
That is an interesting formula. How 
do you make a formula like that work? 
Well, you have to gather a lot of data 
about what a person was earning when 
they were employed and then put that 
into a computer, in terms of the pay-
out each State would make under this 
new formula. It is different than what 
States are already doing. What we 
found out is, States are very different 
when it comes to their computer tech-
nology. We were told that, inciden-
tally, by the Trump administration 
when we established the $600-a-week 
payment. They told us back in March: 
Don’t 
make 
this 
too 
complicated. 
Make it simple, a flat dollar amount 
because these 50 States have computers 
that 
range 
in 
sophistication 
from 
primitive to the most modern, and 
they are not going to change these 
computers in time to help the people 
who are currently unemployed. 
The Republicans seem to have forgot-
ten what we were told by the Trump 
administration when we initially en-
acted the $600-a-week payment. This 70 
percent payment for unemployment 
doesn’t work if the computers can’t 
make it work, and we are told it will 
take anywhere from 2 months to 5 
months for these computer systems to 
even try. 
What are these families supposed to 
do, the ones I just described to you, 
while the computer systems are being 
retooled, and who is going to pay for 
the retooling? If the States can’t im-
plement this program, and, instead, the 
flat cash payment goes from $600 to

$200 for month after month after 
month, trust me, the lines at the food 
pantries will be longer than ever. 
The Economic Policy Institute has 
estimated that cutting this benefit to 
$200 a week will reduce our gross do-
mestic product by 2.5 percent and cost 
us 3.4 million jobs. Just what we need, 
more unemployment, thanks to the Re-
publican formula. 
Research from the JPMorgan Chase 
Institute suggests the enhanced bene-
fits have helped thousands of house-
holds to continue purchasing critical 
needs: food, diapers, and the basics. Al-
lowing these benefits to expire will re-
sult in household spending cuts and a 
reduction in economic activity, which 
is exactly the opposite of what we need 
to do right now. 
This weekend, on television, there 
was a governor from the Federal Re-
serve in Minneapolis who basically 
said: This is exactly the wrong time to 
cut back on benefits to the unem-
ployed. 
And when the questioner said to him: 
Well, what about our deficit? 
He was very frank about it. Yes, for 
the time being, it will add to the debt 
of the United States, but if the econ-
omy recovers, which we all have to 
work to achieve, that recovered econ-
omy will be able to take care of that 
debt. That is something to keep in 
mind too. It isn’t just for the benefit of 
the families who are unemployed; it is 
for the benefit of the overall economy 
to put money back into it now. 
We learned in basic economics that if 
you want to get out of a recession, the 
first dollar the government gives away 
should be to the unemployed. They will 
spend every penny of it, and they will 
spend it and then have it respent into 
the economy over and over again. That 
is how you create consumer demand. 
That is how you create demands for 
business activities, goods, and services. 
So, I want to make it clear from 
what I learned last Friday in Chicago. 
No one—no one is getting rich off of 
unemployment. They are using their 
unemployment benefits to survive. Av-
erage rent is about $1,400 a month in 
this country. COBRA health insurance, 
where you pick up the health insurance 
policy from the employer that just laid 
you off, runs about $1,700 a month for a 
family and $600 a month for an indi-
vidual. The average cost of food for a 
male adult in America, between $200 
and $400 a month. Add it all up. There 
isn’t much left over. And if the Repub-
lican proposal of cutting $400 a week 
from each of these unemployed be-
comes the law of the land to try to 
make ends meet, workers of color have 
a disproportionate impact when it 
comes to this economic collapse. 
Overall unemployment was 11.1 per-
cent in June. Unemployment among 
Black workers is 15.4 percent. It is 14.5 
percent for Latinx workers. According 
to the National Bureau of Economic 
Research, Black households cut their 
household consumption by 50 percent 
more and Latino households cut their 
consumption by 20 percent more than 
White households. That is the reality. 
Let me address two or three particu-
lars raised by the Senator from Ken-
tucky about the state of play as we try 
to negotiate a satisfactory conclusion 
and next step. The first point: This 
week marks the third month—the third 
month since Speaker NANCY
PELOSI 
and the House Democrats passed a res-
cue package. For 3 months, their ef-
fort, called the Heroes Act, has been 
sitting on the desk of Senator MCCON-
NELL. Initially, he said: I don’t feel a 
sense of urgency to address this issue. 
Then he went on to say: We haven’t 
spent all the money we appropriated 
the first round. 
Whatever the reason, it wasn’t until 
7 days ago that the Senate Republicans 
kind of made a proposal. The only 
thing we have seen specific in writing 
was their proposal for liability immu-
nity, which I will address in a moment. 
The rest of the things were oddly pre-
sented as potential legislation, which 
would be brought to the floor of the 
Senate. 
Imagine that? We have the White 
House and congressional leaders sitting 
down negotiating, and Senator MCCON-
NELL said: Well, the Republicans will 
bring a bill to the floor. Well, if you 
follow the Senate, six or eight different 
bills to the floor, the first swipe is 
going through Republican majority 
committees. Second, how long is that 
going to take for us to debate and then 
negotiate between whatever we pass 
and what is pending in the Heroes Act? 
It makes no sense. 
But I will tell you what makes even 
less sense. In the negotiations, these 
delicate and important life-changing 
negotiations that are taking place on 
Capitol Hill—these negotiations to de-
termine what is next now that the $600 
Federal payment has expired under un-
employment, for example—in these ne-
gotiations, there are six chairs. One 
chair is occupied by the Chief of Staff 
to the President of the United States, 
Mark Meadows. Another chair is occu-
pied by Secretary Mnuchin from the 
Department of the Treasury. The third 
chair is Speaker of the House, NANCY 
PELOSI. The fourth chair is CHUCK 
SCHUMER, the Democratic leader of the 
U.S. Senate. But there are two empty 
chairs in this room for negotiations. 
Those two empty chairs should be oc-
cupied. One should be occupied by 
KEVIN MCCARTHY, the Republican lead-
er of the House. He is not there. He 
doesn’t attend these negotiations. And 
the other, of course, should be occupied 
by Senator MCCONNELL, the Republican 
leader of the Senate. 
He has enough time to come to the 
floor each day and criticize Speaker 
PELOSI’s measure that she passed 3 
months ago, but he apparently doesn’t 
have time to attend negotiations which 
could resolve the differences between 
the House and Senate and finally bring 
to rest the concerns of millions of 
Americans about whether or not there 
will be enough money coming in next 
week to pay the bills. It is pretty tough 
to come to the floor each day and criti-
cize the Democrats for not showing 
success in negotiations when the Re-
publican leader in the Senate is boy-
cotting the negotiation meetings. What 
is that all about? I have been around 
here for awhile. I have never seen that 
before where one leader is inten-
tionally staying away from the nego-
tiations. I don’t see how that can end 
well. 
I see my colleague from Texas has 
come to the floor. I want to say a word 
about a proposal which he is promoting 
and is likely to speak to this morning 
before I turn the floor over to him. 
Remember when Senator MCCONNELL 
came to the floor in the last several 
months and said: I am drawing a red-
line. When it comes to any negotia-
tions, this redline is liability immu-
nity for corporations, and if you don’t 
accept my language on liability immu-
nity, there will be no negotiations, and 
there will be no positive outcome—red-
line. 
He made that speech over and over 
again as he warned us about the flood, 
the 
tsunami—‘‘tsunami’’ 
was 
his 
word—the tsunami of lawsuits that are 
going to be filed by people, by trial 
lawyers, these mischievous, frivolous 
lawsuits, over the issue of COVID–19. 
So we kept wondering, when are we 
going to get to see Senator MCCON-
NELL’s liability immunity proposal? We 
waited week after week after week. 
Nothing. Just speeches on the floor. 
And then last Monday it was un-
veiled—a 65-page bill. We finally got to 
see what he was talking about. It is un-
derstandable why they held it back. It 
is the biggest giveaway to the biggest 
businesses in America in modern mem-
ory. This bill would literally override 
State laws that have been passed to 
deal with this issue of culpability and 
blame when it comes to the pandemic 
we face. 
Twenty-eight States have already en-
acted laws to deal with it. This McCon-
nell-Cornyn proposal would override 
those State laws. Sadly, their proposal 
would give incentives to cut corners 
when businesses deal with health and 
safety in the midst of this pandemic. 
This bill would jeopardize frontline 
workers and families, and, sadly, it 
would risk further spread of the virus. 
Here is my top-10 list of what is 
wrong with this bill that is proposed on 
liability immunity: 
First, the bill does nothing to protect 
workers, improve safety standards, or 
give businesses any incentive to take 
the proper precautions. 
We had a hearing in the Judiciary 
Committee. I believe the senior Sen-
ator from Texas was at this hearing. A 
fellow representing a convenience store 
chain in Texas—his last name was 
Smartt—was the Republican witness. 
He was a very good witness, I might 
add. He told us how, in the hundreds of 
convenience stores he had in Texas, his 
company was literally doing every-
thing they could think of to make the

work environment and the customer’s 
environment safe. He talked about so-
cial distancing and masks and sani-
tizers. They were doing everything 
they could. But his plea to us was: Sen-
ators, what is my standard of care? 
What is the standard I am expected to 
achieve? If I know that, he said, I can 
move forward and meet that standard, 
and I am going to. I am committed to 
it. 
Do you know what? I believed him. I 
believed his was a good-faith position. 
He said he wanted to know the stand-
ard—the public health standard—ex-
pected of him, and he would meet it. 
I want to tell you, if somebody 
turned around and sued him afterwards 
because of that, I am convinced that 
there isn’t a jury in America—let alone 
in Texas—who would find him to be lia-
ble for negligence or recklessness. He 
did what he was asked to do. He fol-
lowed the standards he was given. But 
his plea to us was: ‘‘Give me a stand-
ard. I don’t know where to turn.’’ That 
is what he told us. 
The second concern I have with this 
bill is that it would gut existing State 
law safety standards. It would federally 
preempt the right of workers and vic-
tims to bring cases under State law to 
seek accountability for coronavirus-re-
lated harms and would supplant State 
laws that require businesses to act 
with reasonable care. 
Under the bill, the only way a victim 
could hold a business liable is if the 
victim proves by clear and convincing 
evidence—a 
higher 
standard 
than 
most—both that the corporation didn’t 
even try to comply with the weakest 
available safety guideline and also— 
also—that the corporation was grossly 
negligent. I can just tell you, having 
spent a few years making a living as a 
lawyer, that those are almost impos-
sible standards to meet. 
Third, 
by 
setting 
an 
immunity 
threshold at ‘‘gross negligence,’’ the 
bill would immunize corporations from 
accountability for conduct that meets 
the standards to prove negligence or 
recklessness under current State law. 
So you can get away with negligence; 
you can even get away with reckless-
ness; but, boy, you just better not show 
gross negligence. That is what the bill 
says. 
Fourth, the bill would enable cor-
porations to be shielded from liability 
even if they make no effort—no effort— 
to comply with the guidelines from the 
Centers for Disease Control, due to the 
way the bill treats nonmandatory 
guidelines. Why would Congress feder-
ally preempt State laws and then allow 
businesses to ignore the Federal CDC 
safety guidelines? 
Fifth, instead of establishing strong, 
clear, enforceable Federal safety stand-
ards by OSHA and CDC, the Republican 
bill would go the other direction and 
shield businesses from enforcement 
proceedings under Federal health and 
safety laws; in other words, specifically 
protecting businesses from being held 
accountable under existing health and 
safety laws, Federal bills, laws like the 
Fair Labor Standards Act, the Ameri-
cans with Disabilities Act, OSHA, and 
many, many more. 
Sixth, my Republican colleagues say 
this bill is aimed only at frivolous 
coronavirus 
lawsuits, 
but 
the 
bill 
would wipe out legitimate claims by 
workers and victims. By forcing all 
COVID lawsuits to meet a higher 
standard of proof, heightened pleading 
requirements, limits on discovery, and 
other restrictive hurdles, the bill would 
make it nearly impossible for workers 
and victims to even file a claim, let 
alone prevail. 
Seventh, the bill would upend the 
medical liability laws of all 50 States 
and impose 5 years of sweeping Federal 
preemption for nearly all healthcare li-
ability cases, including for claims that 
are not related to COVID. 
I went through this and read it over 
and over again because I used to deal 
with 
medical 
malpractice 
cases. 
I 
heard, on the floor, Senator MCCON-
NELL and Senator CORNYN say: ‘‘We 
have to protect the doctors. We have to 
protect the hospitals. We have to pro-
tect the nurses.’’ That, of course, ap-
peals to all of us because we feel such 
a debt of gratitude to the healthcare 
workers and what they are going 
through to protect us. So I took a look, 
and it turns out that they compiled the 
statistics on the number of medical 
malpractice cases filed in America, in 
the 
entire 
Nation, 
that 
mention 
coronavirus or COVID–19. Do you know 
how many medical malpractice cases 
have been filed during what they call a 
tsunami—a tsunami—of frivolous law-
suits against medical providers? How 
many do you think in the course of 
this year? Six. In the entire Nation of 
50 States, 6 lawsuits—what a tsunami. 
The 
provision 
on 
medical 
mal-
practice goes further and says: You 
don’t have to prove that you were deal-
ing with coronavirus to get this special 
treatment. You can say that the 
coronavirus had some impact on you as 
a medical provider. 
Some impact. That is it? What does 
that mean? Coronavirus has had an im-
pact on every single American. Some 
impact? It basically means that all 
medical malpractice suits are going to 
be put on hold for 4 or 5 years regard-
less of the circumstances, regardless of 
whether they had anything to do with 
COVID–19. 
Eighth, the bill aims to solve a prob-
lem that does not exist. We are months 
into this epidemic, and there has been 
no tidal wave of worker or victim law-
suits that justifies this massive Fed-
eral preemption of State laws and 
grants of broad immunity. Out of 4.7 
million Americans—and that is a low- 
ball number—4.7 million Americans 
who we think have been infected by 
COVID–19, there have been 6 COVID 
medical malpractice suits, 17 consumer 
personal injury suits, and 75 condi-
tions-of-employment suits. Many of the 
lawsuits involving COVID–19 are be-
tween insurance companies: Does your 
policy cover, or does your policy cover? 
Ninth, the bill is entirely one-sided 
in favor of corporations. Under the bill, 
corporations get immunity as defend-
ants but can still bring COVID-related 
cases as plaintiffs. Only workers and 
infected victims have their rights cut 
off by this bill. 
Finally, the bill even goes so far as to 
allow corporations and the Department 
of Justice to sue the workers for bring-
ing claims for COVID infection. 
The liability immunity this bill 
would grant would last for 5—5 years. 
The fact that our Republican col-
leagues are proposing 5 years of immu-
nity for corporations but only a hand-
ful of months of assistance for workers 
and families tells you their priorities. 
This Republican corporate immunity 
proposal is not credible, and there are 
serious questions as to whether it is 
even constitutional. This is an area 
traditionally governed by State law. 
Twenty-eight 
States 
have 
adjusted 
their laws to address it during this 
pandemic. The Federal Government 
has deferred to the States on nearly 
every aspect of COVID response—this 
President said: Leave it to your Gov-
ernor; leave it to your mayor—from 
testing, to procuring PPE, to mask 
policies, to stay-at-home orders. There 
is no reason why the Federal Govern-
ment now wants to step in at the ex-
pense of workers and at the expense of 
customers. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose the 
Republican corporate immunity bill. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
LOEFFLER). The Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, it 
was fortuitous that I was here on the 
floor when my friend from Illinois de-
cided to talk about the liability provi-
sions of the bill we filed last week, the 
next installment in the COVID–19 re-
sponse. Let me just spend a couple of 
minutes talking about the issues he 
raised. 
My friend, our colleague from Illi-
nois, is a very talented lawyer. He has 
a lot of great experience in the court-
room. He understands how courts work 
and how the litigation practice works. 
I think at last count I saw that 
roughly 3,000 to 3,500 lawsuits had been 
filed. I don’t know what the exact num-
ber is, but it is pretty irrelevant be-
cause there is ordinarily, under State 
tort laws—at least in my State—a 2- 
year statute of limitations for a per-
sonal injury lawsuit. So I guarantee 
you that the flood is coming. Having 
survived one pandemic, the American 
economy is going to have to withstand 
a second pandemic of opportunistic 
lawsuits. 
I think it is going to be hard for peo-
ple to prove where they acquired the 
virus. Ordinarily, that would be an ele-
ment of the plaintiff’s burden of proof, 
but we know that in jury trials, where 
expert witnesses are hired, all they 
would need to say is that it is more 
likely than not that they got it at this 
daycare center or this nonprofit or in 
this hospital—enough to create a ques-
tion for the jury. Then it is really a

matter of whose expert witness you be-
lieve, and, of course, the chances are 
that you will be found responsible 
based upon that contested factual 
issue. 
It is more likely, I believe, that these 
lawsuits will have very little merit. 
The juries will be very skeptical of 
these lawsuits because they understand 
that this pandemic came out of no-
where. Actually, we know where it 
came from: China. But nobody was 
fully aware of all of the circumstances 
under which we would need to respond. 
We have had to adapt as time has 
gone on, and we have had different ad-
vice from the CDC and the national ex-
perts. For example, I remember—I 
went back and checked. The CDC didn’t 
recommend that we wear masks until 
roughly April. Before that, they were 
really considered ineffective. So if 
somebody files a lawsuit saying, well, 
you should have been wearing masks at 
your 
workplace, 
and 
because 
you 
didn’t, somebody got the virus, well, 
what is the timeframe in which that 
guidance would apply? Would it be ret-
roactive to January, when the virus 
first broke out here in the United 
States, or would it be sort of based on 
lessons learned down the road? 
Here is the real problem: My friend 
from Illinois knows that lawsuits are 
filed every day in America with no real 
expectation of ever trying the case in 
front of a jury—or a judge, for that 
matter—because we all know that the 
costs of defending those lawsuits can 
be enough in and of themselves to deter 
people from reopening their business. 
Frequently, what happens—there is a 
phenomenon known as nuance settle-
ments, where defendants calculate, 
how much is this going to cost me to 
defend, and I will go ahead and pay 
that money now in order to avoid the 
further vexation of a lawsuit. And that 
is the seed money used to file the next 
lawsuit and the next lawsuit and the 
next lawsuit. I think we can reasonably 
expect that there will be a lot of class- 
action lawsuits. 
The goal here is not to provide blan-
ket immunity; the goal is to do what 
we did after the Y2K phenomenon, 
when we questioned whether our com-
puters would actually register the 
change of the century rather than go 
back to the earlier century and wheth-
er the disruption in financial markets 
and the like would occur. This is 
roughly the same sort of thing we did 
after 9/11, too, to provide some sta-
bility, some certainty, to very chaotic 
and challenging times. 
So we know that, in addition to the 
public health fight, we are trying to re-
open our economy safely. Mothers and 
fathers and teachers and school offi-
cials are thinking about how can our 
children 
resume 
their 
education, 
whether online or in person, but safety, 
obviously, is the most important point. 
The fact is, we had one of the best 
economies in my lifetime before this 
virus hit in January, and now we are in 
a recession. The question is, Are we 
going to recover, rebound from this 
now that we have learned how to treat 
people with the COVID–19 virus better 
to save more lives, to prevent them 
from going on ventilators and the like? 
And, as we are in a race to come up 
with better treatments and, hopefully, 
a vaccine—which will be the gold 
standard, I believe, in terms of our 
learning to live with this virus—what 
is going to happen to the economy? 
What is going to happen to the jobs 
that used to be there but which no 
longer exist because of the recession we 
are in? 
The threat of this second pandemic of 
litigation—opportunistic 
litigation— 
will be a body blow to an economy that 
wants to reopen, to people who want to 
go back to work safely, to children who 
want to go back to school, to parents 
who want to have a daycare facility 
watch their children in a safe environ-
ment while they go back to work. 
One of the things we have talked 
about during all this is essential work-
ers. Well, I think all work is essential. 
It is important. It is important to our 
personal well-being, it is important to 
our economy, and it is important to 
the families who depend on the wage 
earner to bring home a paycheck so 
that they can put food on the table and 
pay the rent. 
I believe that this second pandemic 
of COVID–19 litigation—as I said, there 
is ordinarily a 2-year, I believe, statute 
of limitations—could well keep our 
economy shut down, destroy small 
businesses that have been holding on 
by a thread, and, frankly, punish peo-
ple who had no choice but to show up 
for work. 
I mean, if you are a physician or a 
nurse, you didn’t have any option but 
to show up for work. You knew you had 
to do it in order to do your job, in order 
to pursue your profession. Are we then 
going to subject them to litigation 
risks because of their having to en-
counter something totally new and un-
precedented? 
I think it would be a cruel joke for us 
to say: Yes, you are an essential work-
er; yes, you have no choice but to show 
up; and, yes, you have no choice but to 
be subjected to a lawsuit because some-
body 2 or 3 years later wants to second- 
guess the decisions you made in the 
middle of a pandemic. I just think it 
would be enormously unfair to those 
essential workers who had no choice 
but to show up. 
I want to say, in conclusion, I dis-
agree with my colleague on one other 
matter as well. I believe, by rewarding 
compliance with government public 
health guidelines, providing a safe har-
bor for negligence claims, it actually 
incentivizes people to follow those 
guidelines. Isn’t that what we want to 
do? Isn’t that what we want our 
schools, our daycare centers, our non-
profits, our retail businesses—don’t we 
want them to comply with those public 
health guidelines? 
Well, this is one way to reward them 
and incentivize them to do exactly 
that. I know we are still a long way 
away from a negotiated resolution of 
the things that separate us here on this 
next COVID–19 bill, but I agree with 
the majority leader that this is an es-
sential ingredient in that next bill. 
Prior to the arrival of COVID–19 in 
America, 
the 
Texas 
economy 
was 
booming, along with the rest of Amer-
ica’s economy. Businesses have flocked 
to Texas, creating new jobs and at-
tracting top talent from around the 
country. People are literally voting 
with their feet and coming to where 
they have an opportunity to work, pro-
vide for their family, and pursue their 
dreams. 
We began the year with a 3.5-percent 
unemployment rate in Texas—3.5 per-
cent, just one-tenth of a percent above 
the historic low set last summer. But 
as the pandemic began its deadly sweep 
across 
the 
country, 
everything 
changed. Texas businesses, as were re-
quired, closed their doors to stop the 
spread of the virus, and millions of 
workers were suddenly without a pay-
check. 
We didn’t know when our economy 
would begin to recover, when we would 
reopen to a point where those who were 
laid off work could come back safely. 
And we knew State unemployment 
benefits alone were not sufficient to 
bridge the gap. That is why, when we 
passed the CARES Act late in March, 
we didn’t just enhance the unemploy-
ment benefits; we actually sent a di-
rect deposit to the bank account of all 
adults earning less than $75,000 a year. 
We sent them $1,200 to tide them over, 
to give them a lifeline, which I think 
was very, very important because, even 
if you are out of work, you can’t get 
unemployment 
benefits 
instanta-
neously, and we know that a lot of the 
workforce commissions like those we 
have in Texas that administer the un-
employment 
compensation 
program 
were overwhelmed with applications. 
So it was important that we provide 
that direct relief and then the en-
hanced unemployment benefit. 
Well, in Texas, the average unem-
ployment benefit is $246 a week. With 
an additional $600 a week, which we 
added as part of the CARES Act, that 
amount 
more 
than 
tripled. 
Since 
March, more than 3 million Texans 
have filed for unemployment benefits, 
and recipients have taken advantage of 
the bolstered benefits, which I sup-
ported. 
This additional income, provided on a 
temporary basis, has helped families 
cover their rent, their groceries, and 
other critical expenses until they are 
able to return to work, and, for many 
workers, there is still a great deal of 
uncertainty about when that might 
happen. 
When the CARES Act passed in 
March, we were all hopeful that the 
economic outlook at this point would 
be much brighter than it is today, and 
that is why these benefits came with 
an expiration date of July 31, last Fri-
day. We had hoped that our economy

August 4, 2020 
would be rebounding and we would be 
in better shape controlling and defeat-
ing this virus and that more businesses 
would be able to reopen their doors or 
create new jobs, which obviously has 
not happened as quickly as we would 
have liked. 
In Texas, our unemployment rate 
went from 3.5 percent to 13.5 percent in 
April, a 10-point increase in unemploy-
ment. We have made progress since 
then, thankfully, with it dropping now 
down to 8.6 percent—still a historically 
high level of unemployment, but it is 
moving in the right direction. 
While this is encouraging, we still 
have a long way to go, and we cannot 
allow those impacted to go another day 
without the income that they need to 
support their families. As Republicans 
and Democrats continue to work to-
gether toward an agreement on the 
next coronavirus response package, 
these individuals are being sacrificed 
and hurt in the interim. 
Why did Democrats block our at-
tempt to extend unemployment bene-
fits last week? Is it because they don’t 
care about the people who are hurting, 
who need those resources? 
Our colleague from Arizona, Senator 
MCSALLY, offered a bill last week to ex-
tend these benefits for an additional 
week so that we could continue negoti-
ating, but the minority leader, the 
Democratic leader, Senator SCHUMER, 
blocked it. He prevented us from pass-
ing the simple, 1-week extension to 
give us some time to complete our ne-
gotiations and make sure that people 
who needed that money would not be 
hurt. 
I am embarrassed that the Senate 
could not overcome this partisan dys-
function in order to provide this ex-
tended benefit to people who need it 
while we do our job here. There is no 
excuse for allowing this provision to 
expire without even a temporary meas-
ure until a final decision is reached. 
Even though we are coming up on the 
traditional August recess, I believe we 
need to stay here working until an 
agreement is reached to provide these 
workers with the support they need. Of 
course, there is a delicate balance be-
tween helping these workers and stand-
ing in the way of an economic recov-
ery. 
Here is the twist: Over the last few 
months, I have been hearing from a 
number of business owners in Texas 
who are struggling to rehire their em-
ployees because—get this—they are ac-
tually making more from unemploy-
ment than they made while working, 
and this is not just a one-off or an iso-
lated issue. 
According to the Texas Workforce 
Commission, with the $600 Federal ben-
efit on top of the State benefit, 80 per-
cent of the recipients of unemployment 
insurance were making more money on 
unemployment than they were when 
previously 
employed—80 
percent. 
I 
think that is a mistake. Paying people 
more not to work than they would 
make taking available work makes no 
sense whatsoever. 
Now, obviously, if there is not a job 
for people to take, then they should 
continue to get unemployment bene-
fits, but if there is a job, then I think 
the incentive should be to encourage 
them to safely return to work, not to 
pay them more not to work. 
The bill proposed by House Demo-
crats would extend the $600 Federal 
benefit through next January, pro-
viding even less of an incentive for 
workers to safely reenter the work-
force. This is just one of the countless 
places where the Democrats’ $3 trillion 
Heroes Act fails to deliver the relief 
our country actually needs. This is $3 
trillion on top of the roughly $3 trillion 
that we have already spent. 
Rather than helping Americans get 
back to work, the Heroes Act passed by 
the House includes a long list of liberal 
priorities, things like environmental 
justice grants—what in the heck does 
that have to do with COVID–19?—soil 
health studies, and not one but two 
subsidies for diversity and inclusion in 
the cannabis industry—hardly any-
thing to do with COVID–19. 
What is more, our colleagues across 
the aisle who railed about tax cuts for 
the rich, well, they want to allow mil-
lionaires and billionaires in blue States 
to pay less in taxes. They want a tax 
cut for the millionaires and billion-
aires in their States by eliminating the 
cap on the deductibility of State and 
local taxes. 
For too long, people in my State and 
other parts of the country have had to 
subsidize the big-spending blue States 
by allowing them to deduct all of their 
State and local taxes. That means you 
and I have to pay to subsidize those 
high-tax jurisdictions like New York 
City, for example. 
Well, in addition, the Heroes Act 
deepens the hiring struggle businesses 
are already facing, and it rapidly digs 
our Nation deeper and deeper into debt. 
It is so unpopular, even among our 
Democratic colleagues, that it barely 
managed to pass the House in May. 
I want to credit the Senator from 
Wyoming, who is here in the Chamber, 
who pointed out some of the quotes 
from the New York Times and others 
at the time. 
Here is what the New York Times 
said: ‘‘Even though the bill was more a 
messaging document than a viable 
piece of legislation, its fate was in 
doubt in the final hours before its pas-
sage.’’ 
National Public Radio, hardly a bas-
tion of conservative news, said: ‘‘The 
more than 1,800-page bill marks a long 
wish list for Democrats.’’ 
If this bill were to become law, Tex-
ans’ tax dollars wouldn’t be supporting 
our response and recovery; they would 
be funding a range of completely unre-
lated liberal pet projects. 
Speaker PELOSI knew the Heroes Act 
didn’t have a chance of passing in the 
U.S. Senate. She never intended for 
that bill to pass in the Senate. It was 
all about messaging and posturing and 
trying to manage the radicals in the 
Democratic caucus in the House. 
These unwanted, unaffordable, and, 
frankly, laughable proposals are not 
the types of solutions America needs to 
recover from this crisis, especially 
when it comes to rebuilding our econ-
omy. 
In the next relief bill, Congress must 
include additional unemployment ben-
efits to help those who, through no 
fault of their own, are out of work, but 
we can’t defy common sense and con-
tinue paying some people more to stay 
home than to return to work. Our long- 
term economic recovery will depend on 
people safely returning to the work-
force, and Congress cannot stand in the 
way. 
In addition to supporting workers 
until they are able to return to work, 
we also need to ensure that they will 
have a job to go back to. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent to proceed for 5 more minutes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I 
thank my colleague for his indulgence. 
One of the things we need to do is 
make sure that the Paycheck Protec-
tion Program is replenished as well. 
This is the most successful part of our 
coronavirus response—more than $670 
billion appropriated to help small busi-
nesses maintain their payroll, to keep 
their employees on the payroll. 
More than 400,000 small businesses in 
Texas have received these loans, bring-
ing in over $41 billion to the Lone Star 
State. This money has kept countless 
Texans on the payroll not only for 
today but into the future. I hope we 
will continue the Paycheck Protection 
Program as part of the next COVID–19 
response. 
There is another provision that we 
need to address, though, and that has 
to do with the deductibility of the ex-
penses of businesses that have received 
Paycheck Protection Program loans 
and grants. Unfortunately, while Con-
gress made clear that we expected busi-
nesses that received these loans and 
grants to have the benefit of the ordi-
nary business expenses, the Internal 
Revenue Service has said just the oppo-

The Joint Tax Committee that scores 
bills—tax bills—has said that a bill we 
have now introduced that would allow 
that deductibility to make that very 
clear has a zero score because they un-
derstood that Congress intended to 
allow those deductions in the first 
place. 
We have two choices to help small 
businesses: We can write them another 
check, or we can allow them to deduct 
their ordinary business expenses. This 
would provide some more liquidity and 
provide additional assistance and cost 
nothing in terms of the score on the 
bill. It has bipartisan support that I be-
lieve merits our consideration. 
In conclusion, we need to do every-
thing we can to support the workers 
and families struggling to make it 
through this economic downturn, while 
simultaneously securing the founda-
tion for a strong economic recovery.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4687 
August 4, 2020 
The stakes are high, and I believe the 
Senate must stay in session until we 
are able to deliver the relief our coun-
try needs. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that I be able 
to complete my remarks prior to the 
scheduled vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
want to start by addressing a few of the 
things that the minority leader, Sen-
ator SCHUMER, discussed this morning. 
Last week, Senator SCHUMER twice— 
twice—blocked an extension to the 
Federal 
unemployment 
bonus 
pay-
ments. Twice, the Democratic leader 
threw his hands up, and he said no. He 
said: Democrats will not support an ex-
tension of these benefits—he said—at 
any level. Why? He said why. He said 
he wants Republicans to pass his lead-
er’s bill. His leader is NANCY PELOSI. It 
is partisan, and it is loaded. 
Senator SCHUMER likes to talk about 
some of the things in the Speaker’s 
bill, but he carefully avoids much of it 
because one-third of the spending is 
completely unrelated to coronavirus—a 
full one-third. 
Senator SCHUMER says we remain far 
apart. He said that the difference is be-
tween ‘‘priorities and scale.’’ Priorities 
and scale. Well, let’s look at some of 
the priorities in the bill that he sup-
ports: direct payment checks to illegal 
immigrants; 
taxpayer-funded 
abor-
tions; changes to election laws—perma-
nent; tax breaks for the wealthy in 
New York and in California; millions 
and millions more for environmental 
justice, the National Endowment for 
the Arts. It is a long, long list. 
The minority leader’s statement was 
full of metaphors and analogies this 
morning, but he had very little, if any, 
substance. 
The votes we had last week were not 
what he said—‘‘sham votes’’; they were 
real votes that would have extended 
real money to real people all over the 
country. The answer by Senate Demo-
crats, according to their Senate Demo-
cratic leader, is a larger Federal Gov-
ernment. That is what they are pro-
posing. 
The minority leader used the analogy 
of a leaky faucet. He said that we have 
to take care of the flood, but he never 
mentioned actually fixing the faucet. 
Their bill does exactly that—never gets 
to fixing the problem; it just gives 
Americans a larger government. 
The Republican plan provides 10 
times more for vaccine development 
and distribution than what the Demo-
crats passed in the House. It actually 
gets at beating the virus. The Demo-
crats say they are rescuing schools and 
small businesses, but their bill actually 
zeroes out the Paycheck Protection 
Program and provides less money for 
schools. 
As for understanding the needs of the 
country, 
Senate 
Republicans 
have 
passed, in a bipartisan way, $3 trillion 
in relief, and half of that is still 
unspent. 
On the State and local government 
side, it is ironic to hear the minority 
leader mention all of his preferred pub-
lic service workers, but not once in 
that discussion did he mention police 
officers. That is because the platform 
of the Democrats now really is to 
defund the police. And this is at a time 
when the murder rate in his own home-
town—New York City—is at a record 
level. 
I come to the floor to discuss the 
reckless spending and the partisan ob-
struction by the Democratic Party. It 
is the path they have chosen to deal 
with coronavirus. It is the Speaker’s $3 
trillion 
runaway 
spending 
spree. 
Speaker PELOSI says it is her way or 
the highway, and the Senate Demo-
cratic leader, her deputy, CHUCK SCHU-
MER, has been 100 percent behind her 
political stunt. 
At the same time, the Democrats are 
ignoring what the American people tell 
us they want and need. They want to 
resume their lives. People want to re-
sume their lives safely and sensibly, 
and to do so, they need a safe work en-
vironment; they need a safe, effective 
vaccine; they need their jobs back; and 
they need their kids in school. Repub-
licans are doing everything we can to 
provide this. 
At this time of soaring national debt, 
we must make sure that every penny 
we spend is focused on the disease and 
the recovery. Congress has already ap-
proved nearly $3 trillion in combined 
coronavirus aid. When the Senate 
passed the bipartisan CARES Act, it 
was the largest rescue package in U.S. 
history. Over $1 trillion of the relief 
money still has not been spent, and at 
the same time, millions of people who 
lost their jobs in lockdowns remain out 
of work. Schools and small businesses 
face challenges in reopening as well. 
Congress needs to act, and we need to 
act now. We want to support people 
who are most in need and to do it in a 
way that encourages, not discourages, 
work. 
According to the University of Chi-
cago study, two out of three unem-
ployed people are currently making 
more at home than they would at 
work. That is due to this $600-per-week 
bonus payment. It is not common 
sense. 
Last week, when Republicans offered 
a sensible compromise, Democrats re-
jected it out of hand. They want to 
continue paying people more to stay 
home than they would make at work. 
Democratic leaders are holding the un-
employed hostage—as they say, lever-
age—in their negotiations with the 
White House. Once again, the Demo-
crats are putting politics above people, 
slowing the economic recovery, and de-
stroying millions of jobs in the process. 
Senate Republicans, meanwhile, in-
troduced serious relief legislation. The 
Republican legislation is targeted, tai-
lored to the emergency. Our bill pro-
vides resources for healthcare for kids 
and for jobs. We safely reopen the econ-
omy. We safely reopen schools. We fund 
testing, treatment, and vaccines. We 
provide liability protection. We shield 
the medical community, K–12 schools, 
colleges, universities, and small busi-
nesses from frivolous coronavirus law-
suits. We already see greedy trial law-
yers trying to profit from the Nation’s 
pain. Over 4,000 lawsuits have already 
been filed. An avalanche of abusive 
coronavirus lawsuits will flatten and 
flatline the economy as it just tries to 
awaken. 
We continue to put the health, safe-
ty, and well-being of the American pub-
lic first. We are doing everything we 
can to defeat the virus, and we con-
trast our serious efforts with Speaker 
PELOSI’s pricey, partisan pipe dream. If 
enacted, 
her 
so-called 
Heroes 
Act 
would be a huge waste of taxpayer 
money—the largest waste of taxpayer 
money in U.S. history. In fact, her bill 
costs 
more 
than 
all 
previous 
coronavirus legislation combined. It 
may be her dream; it would be a night-
mare for the American public. 
We can go through the things that 
are in the Democrats’ wish list, and 
anything I would say here would just 
be the tip of the iceberg. Let me re-
mind you what POLITICO reported 
when the bill passed the House. It said: 
It is a Democratic wish list filled up 
with all the parties’ favorite policies. 
National Public Radio said the bill 
marks a long wish list for Democrats. 
The New York Times said the bill was 
more a messaging document than a 
viable piece of legislation. 
Government doesn’t have a spending 
problem so much as an overspending 
problem. It is on full display right now 
as the Democrats promote runaway 
spending—spending that is unrelated to 
the 
challenge 
before 
us. 
Speaker 
PELOSI is wasting our Nation’s time on 
a far-left fantasy that does not have a 
single chance in the world of becoming 
law. 
Let me be clear. Republicans will 
hold the line on reckless spending. We 
need to keep the next relief bill to no 
more than $1 trillion, and we need to 
ensure that the bill only includes 
things 
directly 
related 
to 
the 
coronavirus. 
I am ready to act now. It is essential 
we get this right. And for the good of 
the country, this wild, willful, wasteful 
spending by the Democrats has to stop. 
I yield the floor. 
I ask for the yeas and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the question is, Will 
the Senate advise and consent to the 
Menezes nomination? 
Is there a sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-

EMPOWERING OLYMPIC AND 
AMATEUR ATHLETES ACT OF 2019 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of Calendar No. 503, S. 2330. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the bill by title. 
The bill clerk read as follows: 
A bill (S. 2330) to amend the Ted Stevens 
Olympic and Amateur Sports Act to provide 
for congressional oversight of the board of 
directors of the United States Olympic and 
Paralympic Committee and to protect ama-
teur athletes from emotional, physical, and 
sexual abuse, and for other purposes. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill, which 
had been reported from the Committee 
on Commerce, Science, and Transpor-
tation, with an amendment to strike 
all after the enacting clause and insert 
in lieu thereof the following: 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Empowering 
Olympic and Amateur Athletes Act of 2019’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) The courageous voice of survivors is a call 
to action to end emotional, physical, and sexual 
abuse in the Olympic and Paralympic move-
ment. 
(2) Larry Nassar, the former national team 
doctor for USA Gymnastics, sexually abused 
over 300 athletes for over two decades because of 
ineffective oversight by USA Gymnastics and 
the United States Olympic Committee. 
(3) While the case of Larry Nassar is unprece-
dented in scale, the case is hardly the only re-
cent incident of sexual abuse in amateur sports. 
(4) Survivors of Larry Nassar’s abuse and all 
survivors 
of 
abuse 
in 
the 
Olympic 
and 
Paralympic movement deserve justice and re-
dress for the wrongs the survivors have suffered. 
(5) After a comprehensive congressional inves-
tigation, including interviews and statements 
from survivors, former and current organization 
officials, law enforcement, and advocates, Con-
gress found that the United States Olympic 
Committee and USA Gymnastics fundamentally 
failed to uphold their existing statutory pur-
poses and duty to protect amateur athletes from 
sexual, emotional, or physical abuse. 
(6) USA Gymnastics and the United States 
Olympic Committee knowingly concealed abuse 
by Larry Nassar, leading to the abuse of dozens 
of additional amateur athletes during the period 
beginning in the summer of 2015 and ending in 
September 2016. 
(7) 
Ending 
abuse 
in 
the 
Olympic 
and 
Paralympic movement requires enhanced over-
sight 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
Olympic 
and 
Paralympic movement does more to serve ath-
letes and protect their voice and safety.

previous question shall be considered as ordered 
on the motion to its adoption without inter-
vening motion. The motion is highly privileged 
in the House of Representatives and is not de-
batable. A motion to reconsider the vote by 
which the motion is disposed of shall not be in

S4697 
August 4, 2020 
their lives to earn their spot on the 
world stage representing the United 
States at the Olympics. Standing on 
that podium, they should be proud of 
their hard work that earned them that 
place, the honor of wearing our flag’s 
colors at the Games. But no athlete— 
no athlete—whether an amateur ath-
lete or an Olympian, should have to en-
dure abuse and mistreatment to pursue 
the sport they love. 
Were it not for the pandemic, hun-
dreds of our athletes would have been 
in Tokyo right now representing the 
United States of America at the Olym-
pics. Even though our athletes are un-
able to compete today, we owe it to 
them to create for future athletes and 
future competitors a safe place in 
which to compete. 
Today’s passage of S. 2330 marks a 
step toward providing effective safe-
guards and protection to Olympic, 
Paralympic, 
and 
amateur 
athletes 
across the Nation. 
On January 25, 2018, the day after Dr. 
Larry Nassar was sentenced to life in 
prison, as chairman of the Commerce 
Subcommittee 
on 
Manufacturing, 
Trade, and Consumer Protection, with 
jurisdiction and oversight over the 
health and safety of amateur athletes, 
I opened an investigation with my 
ranking 
member, 
Senator 
BLUMENTHAL, into how the U.S. Gym-
nastics, 
the 
U.S. 
Olympic 
and 
Paralympic Committee, and Michigan 
State University allowed girls and 
young women to be assaulted and 
abused over two decades. 
Nassar was ultimately sentenced to 
40 to 175 years in prison for his heinous 
crimes, but the fight to overhaul a sys-
tem that had allowed him to evade jus-
tice and accountability was far, far 
from over. 
Over the next 18 months, we con-
ducted hundreds of interviews with 
athlete survivors, reviewed over 70,000 
pages of documents, and held 4 sub-
committee hearings, including listen-
ing to the horrific stories from sur-
vivors, issuing subpoenas to leaders 
who failed these athletes, watching 
those who were charged to protect 
them plead the Fifth, and even refer-
ring witnesses to the Justice Depart-
ment for failure to tell the truth. 
Senator BLUMENTHAL and I stood in 
the Russell Senate Office Building with 
more than 80 courageous survivors of 
abuse. Some of these women had been 
assaulted by Nassar while competing at 
the Olympics, some while training with 
the national team, others while attend-
ing Michigan State. One by one, they 
told us the organizations that were 
supposed to protect them had failed 
them. 
One person’s abuse is too much, but 
the question asked that day by one of 
the athletes was, Why was there more 
than one? That question has stayed 
with me since it was spoken. Not only 
do we condemn the abuse, but we con-
demn those who allowed it to continue, 
who failed in their responsibilities as 
human beings as well as in their profes-
sional capacities to care for and pro-
tect these young men and women. 
The bipartisan effort of Senator 
BLUMENTHAL and I culminated in pro-
duction of a comprehensive investiga-
tive report which is this document 
here—a significant work for a serious 
challenge. It also resulted in S. 2330, 
the Empowering Olympic, Paralympic, 
and Amateur Athletes Act, the bill we 
are on today. 
This 
legislation 
is 
intended 
to 
strengthen legal liabilities and ac-
countability mechanisms in the gov-
ernance structure of the Olympics or-
ganizations, restore a culture that puts 
athletes first through clear procedures 
and reporting requirements, and fortify 
the independence and capabilities of 
the U.S. Center for SafeSport through 
dependable funding and oversight. 
During the November 13, 2019, mark-
up of this legislation, the Senate Com-
merce, Science, and Transportation 
Committee, our colleagues provided 
thoughtful input through amendments 
to strengthen this legislation. As such, 
I take this moment to thank my col-
leagues—Senator CANTWELL, Senator 
PETERS, Senator GRASSLEY, and Sen-
ator THUNE—for their efforts in im-
proving the legislation to put us in the 
position that we are in today. 
I specifically thank Senator LEE for 
his input in the markup and his contin-
ued contribution to the legislation to 
improve the processes governed by the 
bill. Additionally, Senator GARDNER’s 
leadership on this legislation was para-
mount to S. 2330’s successful passage 
just a few moments ago. Senator GARD-
NER’s own legislation to establish a 
commission to study the broader issues 
within the Olympic and Paralympic 
movements strengthens our ability to 
guide future oversight efforts. Senator 
GARDNER’s support for this package 
was critical. 
I would be remiss not to thank Sen-
ator WICKER, the chairman of the full 
committee, for his continued support 
as the jurisdictional chairman of the 
Senate Commerce, Science, and Trans-
portation Committee from the early 
stages of this effort, and the support of 
his predecessor, Senator THUNE, then 
the chairman of the Commerce Com-
mittee, who was fundamental in this 
effort gaining the momentum it needed 
to get us to the point we are at now. 
Finally, this entire effort would not 
have been possible if not for the tire-
less and thorough work of Senator 
BLUMENTHAL and his staff. Serving as 
chairman and ranking member of the 
same Commerce subcommittee has al-
lowed us to work on a number of im-
portant issues and legislative items to-
gether, but I can honestly say this ef-
fort could very well be one of the most 
important bipartisan efforts and pieces 
of legislation resulting therefrom that 
I have been a part of as a U.S. Senator. 
I thank Senator BLUMENTHAL for his 
leadership 
and 
his 
team’s 
efforts, 
again, to see that these survivors’ an-
swers could be attained and their safe-
ty protected in the future. 
Most importantly, if there is anyone 
who deserves thanks and gratitude, it 
is the athletes and survivors for their 
exceptional bravery—the bravery they 
demonstrated through their willing-
ness to share their stories, to tell what 
happened to them, to talk to us and to 
talk to the rest of the world. This leg-
islation and the prior investigation are 
only possible because of the hundreds 
of courageous and selfless survivors 
who spoke out against abuse, shared 
their stories, and offered input on how 
we can create change to make certain 
all future athletes can participate in 
the sports they love without fear of 
abuse. 
I especially want to recognize the 
athletes who we worked with and who 
shared their circumstances with us 
during our committee hearings and in 
a number of meetings and phone calls 
over 21⁄2 years: Jordyn Wieber, Jamie 
Dantzscher, Aly Raisman, McKayla 
Maroney, 
Maggie 
Nichols, 
Rachael 
Denhollander, Jeanette Antolin, Emily 
Goetz, Jessica Howard, Sarah Klein, 
Kaylee Lorincz, Morgan McCaul, Han-
nah Morrow, Bridie Farrell, and Craig 
Maurizi. 
We told these survivors that while 
powerful institutions had failed them 
in the past, we—our subcommittee, the 
committee, and the Senate—were not 
going to. I would also like to thank the 
staff and individuals who have advo-
cated for our athletes. 
On my staff: George Redden, Mat-
thew Beccio, Tom Bush, Mark Crowley, 
Conor McGrath, Morgan Said, Trent 
Kennedy, 
Angela 
Lingg, 
Miranda 
Moore, and Thomas Brandt. 
On Senator WICKER’s staff: Olivia 
Trusty, Chapin Gregor, Tyler Levins, 
Crystal Tully, and John Keast. 
And on Senator THUNE’s staff: Peter 
Feldman, Jason Van Beek, and Nick 
Rossi. 
Despite the Olympics being post-
poned and everything that is going on 
around the world today, I am grateful 
that we were able to deliver good news 
and take this step today. We are not 
done. We intend to keep that promise 
and get this bill across the finish line. 
We now will continue to work with 
our colleagues in the House of Rep-
resentatives and the White House to 
ensure the timely consideration and 
enactment of the Empowering Olym-
pic, Paralympic, and Amateur Athletes 
Act of 2020. One is too many, but why 
was there ever more than one? May we 
never have to ask that question again 
and may there never be one in the first 
place. 
I yield to the ranking member, the 
Senator from Connecticut. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I 
am here with profound gratitude and 
pride—first of all, gratitude to Senator 
MORAN for his leadership, his vision, 
his courage, and his steadfastness on a 
journey that had many bumps. This 
task was far from easy intellectually, 
legally, politically, and emotionally.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4698 
August 4, 2020 
He stayed with it, and he demonstrated 
the spirit of bipartisanship that I think 
will enable us, as partners, to achieve 
more but also perhaps to reflect a 
model that this body may take in the 
future, even as we go through one of 
the most difficult periods in the his-
tory of the Senate. 
I hope that the work that we have 
done on this bill, which affects real 
lives and real people who suffered such 
grievous harm—and I will begin where 
he ended and say that the heroes here 
are really the athletes and survivors. 
As extraordinary as is their perform-
ance on the field of athletic endeavor 
and as wonderful as is their prowess 
and their grace, what will last in his-
tory as their enduring legacy will be 
the courage and strength they showed 
us again and again and again. They re-
lived one of the most deeply tragic and 
painful chapters of their lives. 
As much as they celebrated victories 
in gymnastics and other sports, they 
endured the abuse—emotional, phys-
ical, and other abuse—from coaches 
and trainers whom they trusted. They 
put their trust in people who betrayed 
them. It was more than just one 
coach—Larry Nassar. It was more than 
just one sport—gymnastics. It was 
more than just 1 year or one episode, 
and it was more than just one form of 
abuse. 
Larry Nassar became the face of a 
pattern of systemic failure and abuse, 
and he reflected a culture of putting 
medals and money above the lives of 
athletes, prioritizing those tangible 
signs of victory above the human lives 
that were impacted so adversely. Sys-
temic failures were reflected in Larry 
Nassar’s success in terrorizing these 
young athletes, and it affected other 
trainers and other coaches who simi-
larly betrayed trust. It affected other 
sports: figure skating, swimming, as 
well as gymnastics. None were immune 
from the sexual, physical, or emotional 
abuse. 
Almost exactly a year ago, Senator 
MORAN and I issued the report that he 
just showed on the floor of the Senate 
showing that this investigation into 
sexual abuse in gymnastics and the 
Olympic movement should lead to a 
bill. I thank not only Senator MORAN 
for his partnership but also other col-
leagues, as he has mentioned: Senator 
WICKER, Senator THUNE, Senator SHA-
HEEN, Senator FEINSTEIN, as well as 
Senator PETERS and Senator CORTEZ 
MASTO. Each of them provided very im-
portant assistance in this effort. 
But most importantly—and I simply 
cannot say it enough times—the real 
heroes here are the athletes who shared 
their stories and stood steadfast in the 
face of betrayals from the very organi-
zations that were supposed to protect 
them. These survivors were failed at 
every level by their doctors, by their 
coaches, by the U.S. Olympic and 
Paralympic Committee, and by the na-
tional governing boards of their indi-
vidual sports. The gymnasts who sur-
vived Larry Nassar’s abuse were also 
failed by Michigan State University, by 
the FBI, and by local police depart-
ments. Given the monumental abdica-
tion of responsibility from countless 
people in power, no one could have 
blamed them for surrendering hope 
that change was possible. But against 
those odds, they persevered, and they 
are the reason that we have passed this 
bill today. They stood with us—phys-
ically stood with us—on so many occa-
sions, evoking their suffering and pain. 
I ask unanimous consent that the 
names of 140 of the Larry Nassar sur-
vivors be printed in the RECORD with 
my remarks so that history will for-
ever 
remember 
their 
bravery 
and 
strength. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the

Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I 
would like to recognize the 193 addi-
tional survivors who have chosen not 
to be identified publicly by name. 
They, too, contributed to this cause, 
and they, too, deserve to be recognized, 
as do survivors in the future who will 
come forward under the tools and 
mechanisms that we are establishing 
today. They should be recognized, val-
ued, and cherished for their courage in 
the future, as well as the past. 
Over 
these 
past 
years, 
Senator 
MORAN and I heard again and again and 
again that the USOPC and the NGBs 
have failed their athletes at every 
turn. Men and women in these organi-
zations knew what was happening, and 
they did nothing. They already had a 
legal duty under the law to report what 
was going on. Clearly, laying out in the 
law what should be obvious—that you 
must report allegations of sexual mis-
conduct 
involving 
minors—was 
not 
enough for them. They betrayed not 
only their trust to these athletes but 
their legal and moral responsibilities. 
The bill that we have passed today 
provides for enforcement and deter-
rence, and it gives Congress essential 
oversight tools to assure that the U.S. 
Olympic and Paralympic Committee 
and NGBs will comply with the height-
ened standards that this bill spells out. 
No one in these organizations can plau-
sibly claim ignorance now of the duty 
to report these heinous crimes, and, if 
they try, Congress has the ability and 
responsibility to intervene. 
This bill also ensures that SafeSport, 
the organization tasked with inves-
tigating and adjudicating reports of 
athlete abuse, has the resources and 
independence it needs to do its vital 
work. 
The 
U.S. 
Olympic 
and 
Paralympic Committee should play no 
role in determining how much money 
the organization charged with inves-
tigating its members’ worst crimes will 
receive each year or how that organiza-
tion is run. Once this bill is signed into 
law, SafeSport will be independent of 
the resource and other powers that 
have prevailed in the past. 
The bill enacts numerous other re-
forms that ensure that athlete safety 
and well-being are prioritized in the 
Olympic movement. It assures that 
morals and athletes’ interests are put 
first and that medals and money do not 
take the place of athletes and their in-
terests. 
I want to finish by stressing the ur-
gency of this task. I urge the House to 
follow our model here and move in a bi-
partisan way to enact these measures. 
The Tokyo Games have been delayed 
until next year, but it is essential that 
our framework go into effect as soon as 
possible and that athletes be given the 
protection they need and deserve. The 
urgency of this task should be shared 
by the House. 
My hope is that the survivors of 
these horrible abuses, who have waited 
years for this act, will see it happen 
during this session and as soon as pos-
sible. 
I want to say finally how grateful I 
am to my staff. Thank you to Anna Yu,

S4699 
August 4, 2020 
Madeline Daly, Adam Bradlow, Subhan 
Cheema, Natalie Mathes, Charlotte 
Schwartz, Colleen Bell, and Maria 
McElwain. 
I want to join in thanking Senator 
MORAN’s staff. Our staffs worked to-
gether with the teamwork that I think 
can also provide a model for this body. 
Finally, this act is profoundly impor-
tant to the future of Olympic athletes 
and sports generally in our country. In 
effect, it says that trainers and coach-
es, the organizations that represent 
them—the organizations that are sup-
posed to care for athletes should do 
their jobs and keep their trust for 
these athletes; protect them, not be-
tray them; put them ahead of whatever 
the other tangible signs of success may 
be, medals or money. It would depend 
on protective, strong enforcement and 
on deterrence. 
My hope is that we will look back on 
this day and say that it transformed 
this athletic endeavor; that it was a 
transformative 
moment; 
that 
it 
changed the culture, not just the rule; 
that it changed the way sports in the 
United States are played; and that it 
embodied the best values of competi-
tion and athletics in our great country. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I would 
like to recognize the efforts of Senator 
COLLINS, the Senator from Maine, her 
substantive and persistent endeavors 
throughout our process to see that a 
just and right result occurs. 
I yield to the Senator from Maine. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, let me 
begin by thanking my two colleagues, 
Senator 
MORAN
and 
Senator 
BLUMENTHAL, 
for 
their 
tremendous 
leadership on the Empowering Olym-
pic, Paralympic, and Amateur Ath-
letics Act. I am very proud to be a co-
sponsor of their bill. This shows what 
the Senate can do when we work to-
gether to accomplish such a critical 
goal. I salute both of them. 
This bill takes effective action to end 
the negligent behavior by some mem-
bers of the U.S. Olympic Committee 
and the amateur athletic organizations 
that oversee Olympic sports that have, 
on far too many occasions, failed to 
protect young athletes from truly hor-
rific instances of abuse. 
Right after the Larry Nassar scandal 
broke, Senator FEINSTEIN and I intro-
duced the Protecting Young Victims 
from Sexual Assault and Abuse Act. 
Members of the USA Gymnastics team 
gave powerful and compelling testi-
mony before the Senate Judiciary 
Committee about the abuses they had 
suffered and endured. We learned more 
about the horrific acts, the crimes 
committed by Larry Nassar against the 
members of the USA Gymnastics team. 
Our bill, which became law in 2018, 
required prompt reporting of every al-
legation of sexual abuse to the proper 
authorities, and it is helping survivors 
obtain justice and protect our young 
athletes. 
Senator 
MORAN
and 
Senator 
BLUMENTHAL
then launched an 18- 
month bipartisan investigation into 
the failures of the U.S. Olympic organi-
zation. They found that these gov-
erning bodies also failed to protect 
their athletes from acts of abuse com-
mitted by coaches and other powerful 
individuals within their organization. I 
am delighted that they have led the 
way and that Congress has continued 
to focus on this issue to protect the 
courageous young athletes across the 
country who have come forward to tell 
their horrific stories. 
This bill strengthens legal liability 
against 
the 
Olympic 
and 
amateur 
sports governing bodies for the sexual 
abuses perpetrated by coaches and em-
ployees, and it gives the athletes great-
er representation on these governing 
boards. It will also ensure that Con-
gress conducts more systemic over-
sight. It will strengthen reporting 
mandates for adults with knowledge of 
abuse allegations. These young ath-
letes who train to represent our coun-
try at the top levels of competition 
and, indeed, those at all levels of com-
petition and those who aspire to com-
pete should never have to fear victim-
ization by trusted coaches and sports 
officials. 
I, too, commend the young athletes 
with whom DIANNE
FEINSTEIN
and I 
met and who have worked so closely 
with Senators MORAN and BLUMENTHAL 
for coming forward. These survivors 
have told their stories. We are now 
going to make a difference for them 
and for future athletes. 
I hope this legislation will be enacted 
and signed into law very soon. 
Thank you. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arizona. 
Ms. MCSALLY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous 
consent 
that 
Senator 
WYDEN and I be able to complete our 
remarks prior to the recess. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST 
Ms. MCSALLY. Mr. President, 5 days 
ago, I stood before you and this body 
and urged our fellow Senators to reach 
across the aisle and find agreement on 
how we can best help millions of Amer-
icans who have lost their livelihoods 
through no fault of their own due to 
this 
once-in-a-century 
pandemic. 
I 
made a simple request for Senators to 
be pragmatic, to meet in the middle, 
and to expand the unemployment bene-
fits through Friday—for 7 days—while 
Congress continues to work through 
our differences and comes up with a so-
lution. 
I asked: Who could possibly be 
against this? Well, it turns out the mi-
nority leader came to the floor person-
ally in order to object. The Senator 
from New York decided to play polit-
ical theater and thought it was more 
important than assisting Americans 
who have been struggling to make ends 
meet. Once again, he led the way and 
used 
hard-working 
Arizonans 
and 
Americans as pawns in a political 
game. 
For the many Arizonans who are out 
of work right now, this is not a game. 
So here I am again, asking for a simple 
extension through the end of this week 
so that Arizonans don’t see an inter-
ruption to these benefits as we work 
through our differences. Again, I ask: 
Who could possibly be against this? 
While some States continue expanded 
checks after they expired on Friday for 
a few weeks, Arizonans got their last 
one. These Arizonans live in my neigh-
borhood. They live on my street. They 
worked paycheck to paycheck before 
this pandemic hit, and then they 
couldn’t work. 
These Arizonans are people we know, 
like the single mom of two from Phoe-
nix who for the first time in her life 
had to rely on unemployment to sur-
vive. She is the owner of a catering 
business. She has seen her income drop 
drastically, as weddings and large 
events continue to be canceled. The 
$840 she collected a week on unemploy-
ment is helping her get through, keep-
ing her afloat, keeping her business 
and her family afloat to care for her 
two sons, one of whom is autistic and 
requires significant support. 
I am pleading with my fellow Sen-
ators: As we work through our dif-
ferences, let’s extend her benefit for 1 
week. Who could possibly be against 
her? 
Last week I heard from another sin-
gle mother of three who lives in Tuc-
son. She told me she is terrified of fall-
ing into poverty because she is forced 
to live on $240 a week. The extra that 
we provided during this once-in-a-cen-
tury pandemic helped her pay her bills 
and make ends meet. 
I am imploring my fellow Senators to 
extend her benefits, to keep her afloat 
for 1 week while we work through our 
differences, to address what we need to 
do to fight this pandemic, to defeat 
this virus, which we will, and provide 
the economic support and the recovery 
we need, because America will emerge 
stronger from this. We need to work 
through those differences. Let’s just 
extend this for a week. Who could pos-
sibly be against her? 
Arizona seniors are also suffering. A 
70-year-old man in Arizona drove for 
Uber and Lyft before the pandemic hit. 
He can no longer safely drive strangers 
throughout Phoenix given his high-risk 
status. He, too, benefited from the ex-
tended unemployment. That additional 
week will really make a difference for 
him. Again, I ask my fellow Senators: 
Who could possibly be against his get-
ting those benefits for another week? 
These are just three of the countless 
stories I have heard from Arizonians. 
They are pleading with Congress to put 
the bickering and the dysfunction aside 
and work together.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4700 
August 4, 2020 
When I got back home last weekend, 
people were asking: Why did they ob-
ject? It was for 7 days while you guys 
work through your differences. Why 
can’t you guys get your act together? 
Why can’t you just do your jobs and, in 
the meantime, just give us 7 more 
days? 
That is a reasonable request. That is 
why I am here again to offer a simple, 
commonsense solution—to extend the 
expanded $600 for unemployed Ameri-
cans through the week while we con-
tinue to work through our differences 
here to provide economic support, re-
lief, and economic recovery for Amer-
ica. Who could possibly be against this? 
Who could possibly be against this? 
Therefore, I ask unanimous consent 
that the Senate proceed to the imme-
diate consideration of my bill at the 
desk. I further ask unanimous consent 
that the bill be considered and read a 
third time and passed and that the mo-
tion to reconsider be considered made 
and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. WYDEN. Reserving the right to 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator for Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President and col-
leagues, the only thing worse than 
what the Republicans have done here— 
cutting off desperately needed unem-
ployment insurance to millions of 
American families and communities— 
would be to allow a bill to pass that 
promises money without actually de-
livering it. Even if this short-term ex-
tension were to pass, State agencies— 
the experts in this field—have told us 
and the ranking Democrat on the Fi-
nance Committee in very clear terms 
that States don’t have enough time to 
reprogram their systems and avoid a 
lapse in benefits. 
The State unemployment systems 
are not equipped to flip these unem-
ployment benefits on and off. Short- 
term extensions don’t work and will 
not 
work 
from 
an 
administrative 
standpoint. 
No Senator has to take my word for 
it. The National Association of State 
Workforce Agencies has said what I 
have just said: A short-term extension 
isn’t enough for the hard-working 
Americans relying on this lifeline who 
don’t have jobs to go back to. What 
about next week and the week after 
that? 
The only responsible route is to agree 
to the extension with triggers that will 
lower the payments only when it is ap-
propriate to do so, and that means 
when the economy is in recovery, not 
when the economy is in freefall like it 
still is now. 
Republicans wish to cover for the 
fact that they refused to come to the 
negotiating table for months. I looked 
at the record. Literally, for months—as 
the author of the $600 more each month 
and the expansion to cover gig workers 
and others—we asked Senate Repub-
licans to join us in negotiations. The 
Democratic leader, Senator SCHUMER, 
and the Speaker, NANCY PELOSI, all 
made that request again and again, and 
Republicans were unwilling to do that. 
So Republicans are trying to cover for 
the fact that they refused to come to 
the negotiating table for months. 
Our country needs a long-term solu-
tion that ensures the extra $600 re-
mains available for as long as this four- 
alarm economic crisis continues. 
I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Arizona. 
Ms. MCSALLY. Mr. President, I am 
just picturing, if you are one of my 
neighbors or one of the people I men-
tioned who are watching TV right 
now—this is Washington. These are bu-
reaucratic reasons why we can’t just 
simply do what I am asking, which is 
extend for 1 week what we all agreed 
upon in the past while we continue to 
work together to try and solve prob-
lems on behalf of Arizonans. That is all 
I am asking. 
Bureaucratic reasons or posturing or 
finger-pointing—people are so tired of 
it. I am tired of it. That is why I first 
ran to come into this deployed zone 
and fight in a different way than when 
I did in uniform but with the same 
exact oath. We are here to solve prob-
lems. We are here to represent the peo-
ple we represent. 
And, while we work through our dif-
ferences, there is political theater hap-
pening, Arizonans. There is political 
theater. There is unserious negotia-
tions, unfortunately, happening be-
cause some people, like the minority 
leader, think that this is the path to 
power. Somehow, Arizonans can be 
hurt, and others can be hurt. Somehow, 
that is going to work in their favor. I 
am disgusted by that. I am simply ask-
ing for us to do our job. 
Maybe I need to offer another bill 
that all Members of Congress have 
their pay held until we sit down and 
solve this. I did that before when the 
CARES Act was being delayed for po-
litical reasons. 
This 
is 
frustrating. 
It 
is 
dis-
appointing. It is simply a 7-day exten-
sion while we work through our dif-
ferences. 
Once again, friends on the other side 
of the aisle have let Arizonans and 
Americans down, but we need to keep 
working to solve this issue and support 
the people we represent. This is a com-
monsense request, and it is very dis-
appointing that they are not letting it 
through. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
f 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST— 
S. 4143 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I would 
like to offer a proposal that really is 
going to help working families and 
those who are trying to make rent, try-
ing to pay for groceries, who every sin-
gle day walk an economic tightrope 
balancing their food bill against their 
fuel bill. 
We just heard a little bit about how 
we really need to solve the problem. 
This does that because, under our bill, 
S. 4143, the American Workforce Res-
cue Act of 2020, what we wish to do on 
our side is tie these unemployment 
benefits to the actual conditions of the 
American economy on the ground. 
We have had this proposal for months 
now because, to some extent—and I see 
my good friend from South Dakota. He 
made an important point in this dis-
cussion. He is a member of the Finance 
Committee, and I saw an article in 
which he stated, you know, it is impor-
tant for people who are really hurting 
in a tough economy—it is important 
for them to get benefits that let them 
pay the rent and buy groceries. Then 
my good friend from South Dakota 
made a point I agree with. He said: You 
know, when the economy gets better 
and unemployment goes down, then—in 
the words of the Senator from South 
Dakota—the benefits can taper off to 
reflect that. 
That is essentially what S. 4143, the 
American Workforce Rescue Act that I 
have authored with the Democratic 
leader, Senator SCHUMER, does is it en-
sures that we are not going to have 
millions of workers every month or 
every few months live in fear that Don-
ald Trump and MITCH MCCONNELL are 
going to pull the rug out from under 
them. 
We would have a benefit that would 
reflect economic conditions on the 
ground, and it would deal with this 
economic challenge for all the months 
until the economy recovers. That is 
what Senator SCHUMER and I put for-
ward some time ago. The $600 would 
gradually phase down based on the 
State’s average unemployment rate 
over 3 months. This would provide cer-
tainty for families and ensure the 
broader economy continues to receive 
the support it needs. 
And, especially, it doesn’t set up arti-
ficial timelines. That is what the Sen-
ate ought to be avoiding, to just set ar-
bitrary dates. What we need to do is 
make sure that politicians—and, cer-
tainly, 
Donald 
Trump 
and 
MITCH 
MCCONNELL have been willing to pull 
the rug out from under the unem-
ployed. We need to make sure that 
there is a plan going forward. 
That is what S. 4143 does, the Amer-
ican Workforce Rescue Act. It will pro-
vide certainty for families and ensure 
the broader economic recovery will be 
our focus, and there will be support 
until we see that kind of recovery. 
So I ask unanimous consent that the 
Committee on Finance be discharged 
from further consideration of S. 4143, 
the American Workforce Rescue Act; 
that the bill be considered read a third 
time and passed; and the motion to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table with no intervening ac-
tion or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4701 
August 4, 2020 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, I would just say 
that the fact that the Senator from Or-
egon is down here right now instead of 
the Democratic leader I would charac-
terize as movement in the right direc-
tion. And the fact that he is making a 
proposal that is based upon legislation 
that, as he mentioned, he has intro-
duced that actually has a trigger, if 
you will, or a way of phasing down un-
employment benefits, I think, is a step 
in the right direction because, up until 
now, every time that the Senator from 
Arizona has come down here to offer up 
a 1-week extension of unemployment 
benefits—and, by the way, I think it is 
very reasonable and, to the Senator 
from Oregon’s point, I find it hard to 
believe that any State and any com-
puter system which is already paying 
out the $600 bonus wouldn’t be able to 
continue that. It strikes me as just 
really unexplainable that you would 
have problems adjusting a computer 
system that is already programmed to 
pay $600 to continue to do that for an 
additional week. That defies logic to 
me. 
So I think that is a very reasonable 
request. It would allow us additional 
time to work on proposals like what 
the Senator from Oregon has sug-
gested. And there are others out there. 
The Senator from Utah, Senator ROM-
NEY, has a proposal that would ramp 
down the unemployment benefits over 
time. It seems to me, at least, we 
might be able to find some common 
ground there between what the Senator 
from Oregon has proposed and what the 
Senator from Utah or other Members 
on our side have proposed. 
I do believe that what the Senator 
from Oregon is suggesting—that is, to 
lock in the $600 bonus indefinitely— 
one, puts it on autopilot; two, sort of 
takes Congress out of the equation; 
and, three, it continues to offer a ben-
efit that, for five out of the six people 
who are receiving unemployment bene-
fits, offers them more in terms of a 
benefit than what they were making 
when they were working. 
That, to me, is something that I 
think needs to be addressed. And if you 
talk to any small business across this 
country right now, they will tell you 
one of the big challenges they have is 
trying to find workers and to compete 
with an unemployment payment that 
actually pays them more than when 
they were working. Trying to get those 
employees back, I think, has been a 
real challenge for a lot of the employ-
ers across the country. 
So I think that is an issue that has to 
be addressed, and I have heard people 
on this side of the aisle, both House 
and Senate, say the same thing. There 
have been Democratic Governors who 
say the same thing, that the $600 ben-
efit needs to be modified in a way that 
more reflects what people were actu-
ally making when they were working. 
So I think there is some common 
ground that we can find, but, again, the 
idea that has been advanced by the 
other side prior to the Senator from 
Oregon coming down here, which has 
been put forward by the Democratic 
leader, is that the Heroes Act should be 
taken up and passed by unanimous con-
sent. That has been the unanimous 
consent request now on multiple occa-
sions when Senator MCSALLY or others 
have come down here to try and get ac-
tion 
on 
this 
unemployment 
issue, 
which is to come over and offer unani-
mous consent to pick up and pass the 
Heroes Act, which, as we all know, is 
not a serious piece of legislation. 
In fact, the Democratic leader’s 
paper of record in New York, the New 
York Times, said: ‘‘The bill was more a 
messaging document than a viable 
piece of legislation.’’ That comes from 
the New York Times. Many of the pro-
posals in that legislation had nothing 
to do with the coronavirus and, in fact, 
addressed a lot of other what I would 
call extraneous items on the policy 
agenda of the Democratic majority in 
the House of Representatives, to in-
clude 
mentioning 
‘‘cannabis’’ 
more 
times than it mentioned the word 
‘‘jobs’’ in that legislation. 
There are studies authorized in the 
Heroes Act that look at diversity—di-
versity—in the cannabis industry— 
more mentions of that than mention of 
the word ‘‘jobs,’’ which I think right 
there tells you that it wasn’t a serious 
piece of legislation. 
It, furthermore, included—if you can 
imagine this—tax cuts, tax cuts for 
Manhattan millionaires. Tax cuts for 
Manhattan millionaires is included in 
the Heroes Act—again, not something 
that has anything to do with helping 
the people who are hurting as a result 
of the pandemic or get at the point 
that the Senator from Oregon is talk-
ing about; that is, addressing the un-
employment issue. 
So I view this as progress. I view this 
as movement in the right direction, the 
fact that the Senator, not the Demo-
cratic leader, is down here offering an 
unemployment proposal, not the He-
roes Act. I hope we can build on that 
and find that common ground that 
would enable us to address clearly 
what are serious needs among lots of 
Americans who are, through no fault of 
their own, unemployed as a result of 
this pandemic. 
Having said that, I will object to the 
request of the Senator from Oregon 
right now but suggest to him that he 
and Democrats other than the leader— 
and I think there are a number of 
Democrats on this side of the aisle, in-
cluding those who lead committees 
like the Senator from Oregon, who is 
the ranking member on the Finance 
Committee, a committee on which I 
serve and with whom I have worked on 
a lot of issues—can sit down and find 
common ground. 
But as long as rank-and-file members 
and leaders of relevant committees are 
sort of locked out and the leaders con-
tinue to try and do this behind closed 
doors, it is going to be very hard, I 
think, to find those types of practical, 
real-world, commonsense solutions. 
I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, while my 
colleague is here, just a brief reac-
tion—and I think my colleague knows 
that you don’t go out and negotiate 
from the seat of your pants on the 
floor. 
First, I want to be clear on this pro-
posal. This is a proposal the Demo-
cratic leader and I, as the ranking 
Democrat on the Finance Committee, 
worked very closely together on. It is a 
proposal that many Senate Democrats 
think could be the basis of reform, and 
lots of people who look at the future of 
these kinds of economic challenges find 
this idea attractive. That is No. 1. 
No. 2, my friend from South Dakota 
thinks that somehow the benefits can 
just be turned on with a snap of the fin-
ger. The National Association of State 
Workforce Agencies have said that the 
proposal offered by the Senator from 
Arizona would not get benefits that 
make rent and pay groceries to people 
anytime soon. 
The question is, Are you going to 
solve a real economic challenge here? 
The economy has faced, last week, a 
staggering economic contraction. Ac-
cording to the Bureau of Labor Statis-
tics, the last numbers, there are four 
unemployed workers for every job. This 
idea that unemployed folks don’t want 
to work is just insulting. 
What unemployed people tell me at 
home is that if somebody offers them a 
job on Monday night, they will be there 
first thing Tuesday morning. 
What is really needed are solutions 
to this question of unemployment in-
surance that ties the benefits to the 
real world conditions on the ground. In 
fact, when you have unemployment 
like this—well over 10 percent—the $600 
extra per week coverage is clearly what 
is necessary to make rent and pay gro-
ceries. But make no mistake about it— 
I see my colleague from South Dakota 
leaving the floor—I listened when he 
said that there ought to be a benefit 
for folks when unemployment is high 
and that when unemployment goes 
down, the benefits would reflect that. 
That is the American Workforce Res-
cue Act. 
If my colleagues are saying they 
want to back S. 4143, I would like to 
get that message in a direct kind of 
way. 
With that, I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4702 
August 4, 2020 
THE GREAT AMERICAN OUTDOORS 
ACT 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, 
this morning, I had the privilege of at-
tending the President’s signing of the 
Great American Outdoors Act. 
Now, this is a town, Washington, DC, 
that is accustomed to hyperbole—that 
is exaggeration—and excessive par-
tisanship. Yet, today, we had neither. 
As the Secretary of the Interior said, 
the bill the President signed is, clearly, 
the most important conservation and 
outdoor recreation legislation that has 
passed in this Congress and become law 
in at least a half century. It may only 
be exceeded by the actual funding of 
the National Park System itself as it 
was gradually created, over time, to 
become an agency with 419 properties. 
This legislation does two things. 
One, it tackles the deferred mainte-
nance backlogs in the Park System. By 
that I mean, look at our campground 
in the Great Smokies, which normally 
has 5,000 families camping there, but it 
has been closed for a number of years 
because the sewage system doesn’t 
work. There are examples all across 
this country, from the Pearl Harbor 
Visitor Center to the National Mall, of 
worn-out trails, of roads with holes in 
them, of roofs that leak, and of sewage 
systems that don’t work. As a result, 
campgrounds are closed because bath-
rooms don’t operate. 
All of these are our national parks 
and our public lands, which is where we 
want to go and where we especially 
want to go right now because what all 
of us want is to get out. We want to get 
outdoors. We want some fresh, clean 
air that we can breathe. 
The head of Bass Pro Shops was tell-
ing me at the White House this morn-
ing that, at first, COVID really hurt 
Bass Pro Shops and that they had to 
close a lot of stores. Guess what is hap-
pening now. The purchasing of fishing 
licenses is going up at a record level. 
People are taking their sons and 
daughters and grandsons and grand-
daughters fishing and hunting—out-
doors and to the parks. This is some-
thing that everyone who cares about 
the outdoors has been worried about 
since the last generation—that young 
people were not going out to the parks. 
They are going today because they 
want to get outside. 
So today was a wonderful day, and 
everyone agreed that this was the most 
important bill for conservation and the 
outdoors in at least a half century. The 
Republicans 
agree 
with 
that. 
The 
Democrats agree with that. Hundreds 
of conservation groups agree with that. 
The President of the United States also 
agrees with that. It is no exaggeration 
to say that something remarkable and 
historic happened today when the 
President signed the Great American 
Outdoors Act. It is also accurate to say 
it was wholly bipartisan because it 
never would have passed if it had not 
been, and it barely passed even though 
it was. It took a Herculean effort. So I 
come to the floor briefly today to talk 
about some of those persons who made 
a difference in this historic event. 
There were many marchers in this 
parade. There always are when some-
thing passes in the U.S. Senate. One 
Senator never really does anything. It 
takes a parade of Senators—almost al-
ways of both parties—and it takes the 
House of Representatives. It also takes 
the President of the United States. 
Because Presidents don’t always get 
the credit they deserve, I want to say 
that there were many marchers in this 
parade—there were Democrats and Re-
publicans, and there were hundreds of 
outdoors groups—but this historic con-
servation legislation would not have 
happened had it not been for President 
Trump. Here is why. 
He is the first President of the 
United States to allow and support the 
use of money derived from energy ex-
ploration on Federal lands for deferred 
maintenance in our national parks, and 
if the President and the Office of Man-
agement and Budget don’t support 
that, it is not going to happen, which is 
one reason this bill hasn’t happened 
even though people have been trying to 
do it for years. 
I mentioned the history of this and 
the deferred maintenance. As the Sec-
retary of the Interior pointed out, it 
was in the Eisenhower years when we 
had the last big investment in our Na-
tional Park System. I know for a fact 
that the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund, which was the other important 
part of this legislation—$900 million a 
year permanently for the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund—was a rec-
ommendation of the Rockefeller Com-
mission in the Lyndon Johnson admin-
istration, which Congress enacted in 
1964. 
I spent some time on that myself 
when I was Chairman of the President’s 
Commission on Americans Outdoors in 
1985 and 1986. It was our No. 1 rec-
ommendation that Congress should do 
what had been recommended in 1964, 
and now we are in 2020. 
So good people have been working 
since 1964 to make the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund permanent, and it 
was signed into law today. Good people 
have been working since the Eisen-
hower years to deal with the deferred 
maintenance 
backlog—the 
potholes, 
the roofs, the sewage systems, the vis-
itor centers, and the malls—in our na-
tional parks. That bill was signed 
today. It is historic. If the President 
had not allowed the money to be used 
in that way and had not supported it 
strongly in the Republican caucus, 
where we had some trouble getting 
enough votes until we got plenty of 
votes, it wouldn’t have happened. 
He did one other thing which people 
don’t know about. Our bipartisan group 
of Senators asked me if I would ask 
him, when he visited Tennessee in 
early March, if he would add to the bill 
or if he would support adding to the 
bill the national forests and the na-
tional wildlife refuges in the Bureau of 
Land Management and the Indian 
schools, which are in disrepair, so that 
the deferred maintenance of all of 
those would be added to this. 
He said: Yes, let’s do it. 
I called that information back to the 
bipartisan group of managers, and the 
group was excited. It was added to the 
bill, and that became law today as 
well. 
Take the Cherokee National Forest, 
which is adjacent to the Great Smoky 
Mountains National Park. We hear 
more about the Smokies, for 10 million, 
11 million, 12 million people go there 
every year. It has a $224 million main-
tenance backlog. This will cut that in 
half over 5 years. The Cherokee Na-
tional Forest is right next to the 
Smokies and has 3 million visitors a 
year, which is more than most national 
parks. It has a $27 million backlog, and 
this will cut that in half. The Indian 
schools will get hundreds of millions of 
dollars in order to build them back up, 
and they are in bad shape. 
So the President deserves credit for 
that. There were many important 
marchers in that parade, but it would 
not have happened without President 
Trump. 
Let me just mention some of the 
other marchers, and let’s talk about 
the ones in the U.S. Senate. I will not 
go on at great length about them, but 
I do want to acknowledge them. 
Let’s start with Senator WARNER, of 
Virginia, and Senator PORTMAN, of 
Ohio. They, in working with the Na-
tional Parks Conservation Association 
and others, introduced the bill to re-
duce the maintenance backlog in the 
parks. Secretary Zinke came to Ten-
nessee 3 years ago and asked me to do 
a similar thing, and I worked with Sen-
ator KING of Maine. We introduced a 
bill. Then we put those bills together. 
So Senator WARNER, Senator KING, and 
Senator PORTMAN deserve a lot of cred-
it for the work they have done on that 
part of the bill. 
Then we have the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund. I mentioned how 
long that work had been going on. Sen-
ator BURR of North Carolina has been 
an advocate of that for many years. 
Senator CANTWELL, a Democrat from 
Washington State, has been as well. 
More recently, Senator MANCHIN, who 
is the ranking Democrat on the Energy 
and Natural Resources Committee, has 
taken a major leadership role in the 
Land and Water Conservation Fund. 
Then there were Senators GARDNER 
and DAINES. If there were a parade, you 
would have to say they were the drum 
majors. They were out front. They 
helped to work with the President. 
They helped to work with this group. 
So you can see what kind of parade we 
are talking about. 
Senator HEINRICH of New Mexico—a 
strong, progressive Democrat, with 
great respect in his caucus—made sure 
that we kept the thing on balance and 
brought a real conservationist zeal to 
this effort. 
We take him for granted, but let us 
give Senator MCCONNELL, the majority

leader, some credit. In the middle of 
COVID, he agreed, at our request, to 
give us 2 weeks to debate this bill and 
try to pass it—2 weeks of Senate floor 
time. If MITCH MCCONNELL had not put 
the bill on the floor, the bill would 
never have had a chance to pass. 
I thank the Democratic leader, as 
well, for creating an environment with-
in his caucus wherein we could work 
through the difficult issues that arose. 
Now, that is just part of the honor 
roll of U.S. Senators who were involved 
in all of this, but it is an important 
honor roll. 
I should add Senator COLLINS, of 
Maine, who, from the beginning, was a 
strong supporter of both the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund and of the 
Restore Our Parks Act. 
So, when I say ‘‘parade,’’ that is what 
I am talking about. There are many 
marchers in this parade, and every sin-
gle one of those U.S. Senators—both 
Democrats and Republicans—was es-
sential to the passage of this bill. 
The final group was made up of out-
side groups. Some people said there 
were more than 800 conservation and 
outdoor groups in support of this. That 
sounds a little bit like hyperbole to 
me, but I think it might have been 
true. I mean, this is something that or-
ganizations have worked on for dec-
ades—literally decades. Some of the 
people I saw at the White House today 
were the same people I met in the mid- 
1980s when I was the Chairman of 
President 
Reagan’s 
Commission 
on 
Americans Outdoors. Most of the peo-
ple involved with the Rockefeller Com-
mission are gone now, which was in 
1963 and 1964, but people for decades 
have worked on this. I couldn’t begin 
to mention all of them, but The Nature 
Conservancy would be one. Pew would 
be another. Then there is the National 
Wildlife Federation, the Congressional 
Sportsmen’s Foundation, the National 
Parks Conservation Association, and 
the National Park Foundation. Sally 
Jewell, the former Secretary of the In-
terior 
in 
the 
last 
administration, 
helped to organize and lead many of 
these folks. 
So you can see, with that sort of 
breadth and every Interior Secretary 
from Babbitt to Zinke, we had quite a 
parade of Americans who wanted to 
celebrate the great American outdoors. 
People say that Italy has its art, that 
England has its history, that Egypt has 
its pyramids, but that the United 
States has the great American out-
doors. We celebrated that today, and I 
was proud to be one marcher in that 
parade. 
As the President signed the legisla-
tion, I was thinking of some gesture I 
could make to him or gift I could give 
him that would be appropriate so as to 
recognize, of all of the marchers in the 
parade, that he was the most con-
sequential because, if he had not sup-
ported it, it wouldn’t have happened. 
So I took with me a walking stick that 
was as tall as I am—about his size— 
that was given to me in 1978 when I was 
walking across Tennessee in my cam-
paign for the Governor of Tennessee. I 
walked in a red and black shirt—a lot 
like the mask I wear today. People 
would give me walking sticks, and this 
was a walking stick that was carved by 
a Smoky Mountain craftsman. It is a 
mountain man walking stick. It is, 
really, a beautiful stick. 
I gave it to the President. He looked 
a little surprised, and then he took it 
and walked away with it. 
I said: Mr. President, you may find 
this will come in handy during the rest 
of the year. 
He said: I think it will. 
So that was a heartfelt gesture to the 
President. I am glad he liked it. I know 
the people in the Great Smoky Moun-
tains like this piece of legislation and 
are grateful for his work on it. I hope 
he keeps that walking stick as a token 
of respect for his support and apprecia-
tion for what he has done to help this 
whole parade of Senators on both sides 
of the aisle create this new law. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, 
the last 6 months have been among our 
country’s most trying and pain-filled 
in recent history. Nearly 160,000 Ameri-
cans have lost their lives—that is more 
than enough people to fill Seattle’s 
CenturyLink stadium twice—and 4.7 
million Americans have been infected. 
Everywhere, nationwide, we see the 
economic consequences of this virus— 
millions of people losing their jobs and 
their healthcare; millions more at risk 
of losing their homes; food lines a mile 
long. All of this as our country begins 
long-overdue work to grapple not just 
with police brutality against Black 
people and communities of color but 
also with the racial injustice imbedded 
in our laws and policies, which has 
caused COVID–19 to have vastly dis-
proportionate impacts on those very 
same communities. 
Since my home State of Washington 
was hit hard early back in February, I 
have been ringing alarm bells every 
day, day in and day out, about the need 
for the Trump administration and this 
Republican-controlled Senate to act 
with urgency, to listen to public health 
experts, and to follow the science and 
put the health and safety of workers 
and families above any political con-
sideration. So you can imagine my 
frustration that for months, as Demo-
crats urged Republicans to work with 
us on additional relief and pass legisla-
tion to do just that in the House, Re-
publicans have refused. 
As we got closer and closer to laid-off 
workers seeing dramatic cuts in unem-
ployment benefits, as we got closer to 
the expiration of the eviction morato-
rium, we heard the Senate Republican 
leader was ‘‘in favor of States just 
going bankrupt.’’ That was April. We 
heard that Senate Republicans didn’t 
feel any urgency to act. That was May. 
Now it is August, and with this virus 
still raging, Senate Republican leaders 
finally produced a so-called relief pack-
age that actually grants corporations a 
‘‘get out of jail free’’ card if their em-
ployees or customers get sick. It guts 
jobless benefits. It rolls back critical 
civil rights protections for workers, in-
cluding 
communities 
of 
color, 
LGBTQIA and other people, women, 
older Americans, and people with dis-
abilities. 
It is a package that fails to keep our 
childcare sector stabilized for more 
than a month; to provide the signifi-
cant funding we need to finally make 
testing and contact tracing fast, free, 
and everywhere; and to require the 
type of end-to-end, comprehensive plan 
that we need to make sure safe, effec-
tive vaccines are cost-free and wildly 
available. 
Their package will not help the mil-
lions who have lost health insurance 
coverage during this crisis or help peo-
ple suffering from the virus afford 
treatment. It does nothing to address 
the impact of this virus on Black, 
Latinx, Tribal communities, and other 
communities of color, and it provides 
zero relief for State, local, and Tribal 
governments, which is an absolute ne-
cessity for my State and so many oth-
ers. 
If that is not enough, one of the cen-
terpieces of this bill is a demand, 
tweeted out by the President of the 
United States, which I, as a former pre-
school teacher and a mom and a grand-
mother, find especially insidious and 
harmful. This is the Republican policy 
to try to force schools to reopen for in- 
person learning, regardless of what the 
public health experts recommend. This 
policy is a lose, lose, lose. It threatens 
the health and safety of students and 
families, educators and communities. 
It would in particular pressure high- 
need school districts to reopen in per-
son despite the risk, and it could 
spread this virus further and longer. 
Many school districts are already re-
jecting that policy and planning for 
distance learning this fall for every 
student because, let me be clear, no 
student’s 
education, 
regardless 
of 
where it takes place, should falter be-
cause the President wants to pretend 
this virus has gone away or because 
Republicans in the Senate are unwill-
ing to stand up to him. 
If a school cannot safely reopen in 
person, they need the resources to en-
sure that every student and educator 
has access to a computer, to the inter-
net, and to other equipment necessary 
to learn outside of a traditional class-
room. So what we need to do is pass 
the Coronavirus Child Care and Edu-
cation Relief Act, which provides K–12 
schools with $175 billion to make sure 
schools can continue to educate stu-
dents in whatever way is safest. 
It makes addition investments in sta-
bilizing our childcare and higher edu-
cation systems, which are facing finan-
cial crisis, and it helps ensure that stu-
dents of all ages, who are dispropor-
tionately impacted by this virus, are 
supported through all they are facing.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4704 
August 4, 2020 
I know there are some who say the 
investments we are proposing are too 
much. Well, what I would say to them, 
as a former chair of the Budget Com-
mittee in the Senate, is that budgets 
are statements of our values and our 
priorities, and I believe that one of our 
top priorities at all times, but espe-
cially in a pandemic, should be making 
sure that students and families and 
educators do not have to choose be-
tween safety and quality public edu-
cation. 
The parents and families I am hear-
ing from are under such immense pres-
sure right now. My question to Repub-
lican leaders is, why, when things are 
already so hard, are you determined to 
make them harder for people who are 
already struggling so much? 
This question is personal for me for a 
lot of reasons, one of which is because, 
when I was growing up, my family fell 
on hard times. My dad, who was a 
World War II veteran, was diagnosed 
with multiple sclerosis, and he couldn’t 
work any longer. That meant that my 
mom, who had stayed home to raise 
our family, had to take care of him 
while also working to support our fam-
ily. Her job didn’t pay enough to sup-
port me and my six brothers and sis-
ters or cover the growing medical bills. 
For several months, we had to rely on 
food stamps, and then my mom got 
Federal support to go back to school, 
and she got a better job. My brothers 
and sisters and I got grants and stu-
dent loans to go to college. 
The point is, I know things could 
have gone a far different way for us had 
the government just said: Sorry; you 
are on your own. 
Well, right now, families across the 
country have fallen on incredibly hard 
times. They are worried and scared be-
cause, so far, ‘‘You are on your own’’ is 
largely 
what 
this 
Republican-con-
trolled Senate and administration have 
told them. 
We owe every worker and family, in-
cluding immigrant families—so many 
of whom are on the frontlines of this 
fight—relief that reflects the depth of 
this crisis and helps them get back on 
their feet, just like mine was able to; 
relief that helps kids learn safely and 
keeps families in their homes, with 
food on the table, until we can get 
through this; relief that helps us come 
back stronger as a nation. It is not too 
much to ask. In fact, it is what we are 
supposed to be here to do, and it is 
what I and Democrats are going to 
keep fighting for. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
TRIBUTE TO JOE BARKSDALE 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
for the benefit of my colleagues who 
want to speak next, I have a 1-minute 
remark and approximately 5 minutes of 
remarks. 
Today is National Chocolate Chip 
Cookie Day. It is a perfect day to sa-
lute an Iowa entrepreneur who built a 
cookie empire at the Iowa State Fair. 
Last year, his business sold 2 million 
chocolate chip cookies during the 11 
days of the fair. 
A lifelong salesperson and legendary 
concessionaire, this 92-year-old Iowan 
is in a league of his own. After more 
than a quarter century rolling cookie 
dough at the State fair, Joe Barksdale 
decided it was time to hang up his 
apron. However, his legacy will con-
tinue for generations to come. He is 
paying it forward by giving back to the 
people of Iowa. Joe gifted his legendary 
cookie recipe to the Iowa State Fair so 
that its profits could be reinvested for 
years to come. 
As of today, Barksdale’s State Fair 
Cookies has a brand new home. The 
permanent cookie building will shorten 
customer wait times with a dozen sales 
windows. For anyone who hasn’t tasted 
this State delicacy, I suggest you put 
it on your bucket list. 
f 
CATTLE SPOT PRICING 
Mr. GRASSLEY. On another matter, 
Madam President, Iowa is home to 
86,000 family farms and leads the Na-
tion in the production of commodities, 
such as corn, where we are No. 1; soy-
beans, No. 2; pork, and eggs, No. 1. Iowa 
also ranks in the top 10 in cattle pro-
duction, as many family farms raise 
livestock alongside their corn and soy-
beans. 
The 2017 USDA Census of Agriculture 
showed over 23,000 farms in Iowa that 
raise cattle or calves, with annual sales 
of $4.7 billion. Caring for livestock 
takes a spirit of commitment, selfless-
ness, and, of course, hard work. These 
farmers get up very, very early in the 
morning, work on their farms all day, 
and are active members of their com-
munities. These families and their val-
ues form the foundation of what makes 
up our rural communities across Iowa. 
However, over the years, the consoli-
dation of the beef industry has threat-
ened the very livelihood of these fami-
lies and rural communities where they 
reside. From the 2012 USDA Agri-
culture Census to the 2017 Agriculture 
Census, Iowa lost nearly 1,500 cattle 
producers. This is not a new issue to 
the beef industry. The concern of fair 
and transparent cattle pricing has seen 
increased attention due to disruptions 
in our food supply chain. It has been 
very obvious during this period of the 
virus pandemic. 
For background, the U.S. Depart-
ment of Agriculture mandates price re-
porting for live cattle and tracks the 
spread between fed cattle prices—what 
the producer gets paid—and the boxed 
beef values, which is what the packing 
company gets paid. 
For the years 2016 to 2018, this spread 
averaged about $21 per hundredweight. 
Soon I will be comparing that to a 
very, very big increase from that $21. 
However, during April and May, there 
were major beef supply disruptions, as 
large numbers of plant workers con-
tracted COVID–19. Because there are 
only four companies that slaughter 80- 
percent of the cattle, companies have 
the advantage of purchasing cattle 
from thousands of producers, acting as 
a chokepoint for the entire industry. 
These packers dominate the market-
place and limit opportunities for price 
negotiation. 
During this time, in these recent 
months, packer profit margins topped 
out at a spread of $279 per hundred-
weight compared to the $21 that I pre-
viously mentioned. This was the larg-
est spread between the price of fed cat-
tle and the price of boxed beef since the 
inception of the mandatory price re-
porting law of 2001. So while all the 
packers were making record profits, 
the independent producer had nowhere 
even to market his livestock. 
It is important to note that the im-
pact of consolidation doesn’t just hurt 
producers. It hurts consumers. We have 
seen the price of ground beef and 
steaks—a staple in many American 
diets—double or triple recently. Gro-
cery stores also limited the amount of 
meat that families could buy. All this 
has made it very clear that the cattle 
market is broken and real action is 
needed to fix it. 
Thankfully, the Trump administra-
tion stepped up to this cause. It has re-
sponded with two decisive actions to 
address the country’s cattle market. 
First, the U.S. Department of Agri-
culture and the Department of Justice 
are both investigating the practices of 
these packing companies, particularly 
the four that dominate the market. 
While this will take time, President 
Trump has personally asked for these 
investigations and said he did it be-
cause he wants to protect the family 
farmer. 
Second, on July 22, the USDA issued 
a significant report that lays out a 
roadmap to fix the cattle marketplace. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture 
mentions 12 different ways to create 
additional price discovery, increase 
marketplace competition, and have a 
more transparent relationship between 
the price of live cattle and the beef 
products that the consumer buys. 
This investigation and report are 
very much a breath of fresh air, par-
ticularly for this Senator who has been 
bringing this issue to the attention of 
Agriculture Department and Justice 
Departments under both Republican 
and Democratic administrations for a 
long period of time. We have had mul-
tiple administrations from Democrats 
to Republicans ignoring independent 
cattle producers and the broken cattle 
market. So I am very grateful that 
President Trump and Secretary Perdue

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4705 
August 4, 2020 
take this issue seriously, when so 
many others before them have ignored 
this problem. 
In the report issued by Secretary 
Perdue, one of the considerations for 
Congress is to create a mechanism to 
mandate negotiated cash trades. I am 
getting to one of the very key reasons 
why I am on the floor today, because I 
see some of the actions in this report 
from Secretary Perdue as almost an 
endorsement of the Grassley-Tester 50/ 
14 concept. 
The Grassley-Tester bill will require 
half of packers’ weekly volume of beef 
slaughter to come as a result of pur-
chases made on the cash market. The 
fact 
is 
that 
without 
a 
mandated 
amount of cash trade, independent pro-
ducers become residual suppliers and 
then lack the leverage to fairly nego-
tiate with packing companies. 
Besides the Grassley-Tester bill, Con-
gress has the responsibility to fully vet 
the 11 other considerations that the 
Trump administration lays out in its 
report. The Agriculture, Nutrition, and 
Forestry Committee should hold hear-
ings on this road map. We should bring 
a diverse set of stakeholders, govern-
ment officials, business executives, and 
subject matter experts to explain the 
challenges that cattle producers are 
facing. The hearings would allow the 
committee to properly vet proposals to 
improve mandatory price reporting, 
which needs to be reauthorized by Sep-
tember 30 of this year. 
The beef industry employs hundreds 
of thousands of hard-working men and 
women who work each day to help feed 
our country and, because we export so 
much, you can say feed the world. 
As the U.S. Department of Agri-
culture Census shows, we are losing 
producers due to consolidation. We 
need to show these men and women 
that Washington, DC, is listening. We 
need to show our rural communities 
that we want them to survive. We must 
develop solutions to the problems that 
they are facing. 
I will continue to be the voice for 
independent producers. Today, I am 
asking my colleagues and Congress to 
be that voice with me. Support my bill 
with Senator TESTER and bring com-
petition and price transparency back 
to the cattle markets. While I am at it, 
I want to reemphasize something I pre-
viously said. The Ag committee should 
hold a hearing on these issues and do it 
very soon. 
I am happy to see Senator TESTER on 
the floor, who I think is here to speak 
on the very same issue. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana. 
Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I 
want to thank Senator GRASSLEY for 
his leadership on this issue. He has 
known for a long time, as I have 
known, that something is amiss in the 
competition in the cattle business. 
I rise today to speak about that. It 
isn’t talked about enough in this body 
or in the United States in general, but 
the fact is that rural America is being 
cast aside, and it is falling prey to cor-
porate interests whose only concern is 
about making a quick buck. The truth 
of the matter is that the American cat-
tle ranchers are suffering. 
It is an open secret that meat pack-
ers have been taking advantage of 
small-scale ranchers, family ranchers, 
and the small and medium-sized feed-
ers for years. While some of us have 
been raising the issue for some time, it 
is now becoming apparent and it has 
come into the national spotlight. 
Almost 1 year ago exactly, a fire at a 
beef packing plant in Holcomb, KS, 
halted 5 percent of our country’s beef 
distribution capacity. It caused the 
price of meat in grocery stores to sky-
rocket and caused a sharp decline in 
cattle prices at the farm gate. It was 
Montana 
producers 
and 
producers 
across this country who took the hit 
while the meatpacking industry re-
ported record profits. 
Following that fire, Senator GRASS-
LEY and I demanded that the Depart-
ment of Agriculture conduct an inves-
tigation looking into price manipula-
tion by the largest packers. Although 
this investigation is ongoing, their 
findings thus far have been disturbing. 
Their findings clearly show that mar-
kets are being manipulated and the 
packing industry is walking all over 
America’s ranchers and consumers. 
Just when we thought that condi-
tions for producers couldn’t get much 
worse and as we saw cattle prices drop 
lower than they have been in decades, 
ranchers were hit with yet another dis-
aster. 
That 
disaster 
was 
the 
coronavirus pandemic. 
This virus forced many of the largest 
packing plants to shut their doors, de-
pleting the Nation’s beef capacity by 
nearly 40 percent. Yet again, it was our 
small-scale cow calf operators, along 
with everyday consumers, who have 
seen skyrocketing beef prices through-
out the last year, and we have seen 
lower and lower prices for the cow calf 
operators and the small to medium- 
sized feeders. They are the ones taking 
the hit. In April and May of this year, 
we saw the largest ever price discrep-
ancy between the price of boxed beef 
and the price received by the cattle 
owner, growing from $66 per hundred-
weight on the boxed beef to $279. 
I need to repeat that, because it is 
nothing short of ridiculous. From early 
April to the middle of May, the price 
for what American cattle ranchers 
were selling for the beef shipped to 
stores across this country increased by 
323 percent. 
Mission control, we have a problem 
here. 
Our ranchers and the American pub-
lic are being taken advantage of in the 
midst of a global health crisis that has 
also driven us into an economic crisis. 
To top it off, cattle transactions on the 
cash market took a steep decline fol-
lowing the Holcomb Fire, allowing for 
even more price manipulation by the 
packers while the number of cows 
slaughtered increased by 5,000 head. 
Now, it is obvious to anybody who 
looks at this situation that the packers 
are using these crises to force markets 
to work for them only. One of the ways 
the packers get away with this is by 
limiting transactions that take place 
on the spot for cash markets. Instead, 
they set prices with formulas that 
allow them to use unfair market power 
to put corporate profits over families, 
ranchers, feeders, and over consumers. 
That is why Senator GRASSLEY and I 
wrote a bill requiring large-scale pack-
ers to increase the proportion of spot 
transactions to 50 percent of the total 
cattle purchases. This would hold cor-
porate packers accountable; make pric-
ing fairer for our producers—cow-calf 
operators, 
small- 
and 
medium-size 
feeders; and bring more money into 
rural economies and into the pockets 
of these families who are feeding this 
country and the world. 
I fear these words are falling on deaf 
ears. The fact is, we need more support 
from this body. We need our colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle to sign on to 
this critical legislation so that we can 
ensure that folks who have been rais-
ing our food for generations are able to 
meet the bottom lines and that fami-
lies in both rural and urban areas who 
rely on affordable beef can keep put-
ting food on the table. We needed you 
to join us yesterday because rural 
America needs help today. Folks across 
my State need help now. 
I know many of my colleagues—espe-
cially those of you who are on the cam-
paign trail—are always looking for 
ways to show support for rural Amer-
ica. I am calling on you to join Senator 
GRASSLEY
and me in standing up 
against this profiteering. 
Another way you can help American 
ranchers today is by supporting a bill 
that my colleague Senator ROUNDS and 
I wrote, the New Markets for State-In-
spected Meat and Poultry Act. It is a 
critical bill that will cut needless red-
tape preventing ranchers from properly 
utilizing State-inspected meat facili-
ties to be able to sell their products 
across State lines. 
We have an opportunity to work on 
these commonsense bills together— 
something that doesn’t happen very 
often in this Senate. We have a critical 
chance to support folks who are the 
very reason we can enjoy a juicy burg-
er or a tender steak. 
Let me close with the words of a per-
son who is in the cattle industry on the 
ground in Montana who told me about 
60 days ago that we are at a crisis point 
in 
production 
agriculture 
when 
it 
comes to beef. If something is not done 
on this issue of packer control of prices 
in the marketplace, if something isn’t 
done to ensure that capitalism isn’t 
working here and that we need to put 
some sideboards on this to funnel some 
of the money down to the growers and 
the small- and medium-sized feeders, 
then our food chain for red meat will 
change. I know for the vegetarians in 
the crowd that might sound like a good 
deal, but it is not because the fact is,

when the food chain in rural America 
goes bust—because that is what we are 
on the verge of—this whole country 
will be diminished by that. 
So it is important that my colleagues 
here in the Senate work with Senator 
GRASSLEY and me to fix this problem. 
It will not be fixed by not doing the 
things we need to do in this body. Sen-
ator GRASSLEY and I have a bill, and 
Senators ROUNDS and KING have a bill, 
and we need to get those two bills 
passed and move on to ensure fairness 
in the marketplace. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. CASSIDY. Madam President, I 
rise to address the issues regarding the 
COVID crisis. Now, as we know, the 
COVID crisis is a public health crisis 
which has led to an economic crisis 
and, in turn, an educational crisis. 
Today, I am going to speak about an 
aspect of the economic crisis—specifi-
cally State and local governments, 
which have had to shut down their 
economy and, in turn, have lost all the 
tax revenue they otherwise would re-
ceive and, because they have lost that 
tax revenue, have put the jobs of fire-
fighters, police officers, teachers, sani-
tation workers, and other essential 
frontline workers at risk. So let me 
proceed. 
Senate Republicans have unveiled a 
proposal for a second line of support for 
American families and small busi-
nesses as our Nation continues to com-
bat the COVID–19 pandemic. The virus 
is an unprecedented challenge, but we 
shall overcome, and the HEALS Act at-
tempts to do that. 
The introduction of this proposal sig-
nals Republicans’ commitment to see-
ing America through this challenging 
time, as was with the CARES Act. The 
ultimate safety of the people of Lou-
isiana and the United States are my 
top priority, and the HEALS Act, as 
with all major bills, is a starting point 
of negotiations to build consensus 
among Members of both parties for the 
best path forward. 
The HEALS Act includes stimulus 
checks for Americans, support for 
small businesses, and billions to help 
schools reopen. While these are criti-
cally important to economic recovery, 
so, too, are the essential services pro-
vided by States and local communities. 
I am talking about police officers, fire-
fighters, teachers, sanitation workers, 
and other municipal workers. Because 
of this economic lockdown, State and 
local governments have seen their tax 
base erode, which threatens their abil-
ity to keep these very people we need 
employed—these people who keep our 
communities running. 
I don’t want to see, for example, a 
situation where cities slash police 
budgets and force layoffs of those who 
put their lives on the line to keep us 
safe. That is why Congress should in-
clude additional relief for State and 
local communities in this relief pack-
age. 
Senator BOB MENENDEZ—and his staff 
has been a wonderful team to work 
with—and I have offered a bipartisan 
proposal called the SMART Act to help 
communities through this pandemic. I 
am privileged to be joined today by 
Senator MENENDEZ and Senator COL-
LINS to speak on its behalf. 
The SMART Act calls for $500 billion 
in funding for State and local govern-
ments, and it would be dispersed in 
thirds. One-third is based on a State’s 
population. Clearly, California needs 
more than Alaska. One-third is based 
upon the COVID–19 impact. My State 
has had one of the highest per capita 
incidences of coronavirus infection. We 
have been terribly impacted. One-third 
is based upon revenue lost, which, 
again, my State, as well as the States 
of my colleagues, has been very im-
pacted. It is a fair formula that 
prioritizes funding to the hardest hit. 
The need is great. S&P Global re-
leased a report detailing the State sus-
ceptibility to fiscal distress in a 
COVID–19 recession. There were 38 
States that had a high or very high 
risk of economic exposure. S&P’s find-
ings echo a Moody’s report that also 
predicted dire effects to States and cit-
ies if nothing is done. Moody’s found 
that 34 States will see tax revenue fall 
by double-digit percentage points, the 
worst of which are Alaska falling 80 
percent, Louisiana at 46 percent, and 
North Dakota at 44 percent. 
According to the National Associa-
tion of Counties, local communities— 
not States; local communities—antici-
pate a $202 billion impact to budgets 
through 2021. Their report shows that 
71 percent of counties have delayed 
capital investments, including infra-
structure and economic development 
projects; 68 percent have cut or delayed 
county services—or parish services in 
the case of Louisiana—human services, 
public safety, and community develop-
ment support; and 25 percent have cut 
the county workforce. Moody’s esti-
mates that 1.3 million have already 
been laid off, and an estimated 1.4 mil-
lion more State and parish county 
workers and municipal workers will be 
laid off in the coming fiscal year. 
Sixty-six percent of counties receiving 
CARES Act coronavirus relief indicate 
that the funding will not cover the 
COVID–19 budget or they are uncertain 
if the budgetary impacts will be cov-
ered. This is the impact of what has 
happened. 
By the way, we spoke earlier of $202 
billion, and this is how the breakdown 
is in terms of lost revenue and lost 
State funding, et cetera. The impact 
upon State and county and municipal 
governments is huge. All told, the Na-
tional Association of Counties predicts 
a loss of 4.9 million jobs and $344 billion 
lost in GDP. It does not have to be that 
way. We can save jobs for police offi-
cers, firefighters, teachers, and others 
by including State and local support in 
the act we are considering. 
As I mentioned before, Louisiana, my 
State, is facing serious shortfalls. We 
are still struggling with a second wave 
of COVID cases. Yesterday, we had the 
No. 
1 
per 
capita 
incidence 
of 
coronavirus. The State is having to 
continue in a phase 2 lockdown, which 
strains not only my folks in Louisiana 
but also the revenue of the local com-
munities where they would otherwise 
spend their money. 
Folks back home know the con-
sequences if they don’t receive support. 
There were 22 parish presidents who 
signed a letter supporting the SMART 
Act. They wrote: 
As elected leaders with parish populations 
ranging from over 400,000 to 18,000, the 
COVID–19 pandemic has created unprece-
dented challenges for all local governments 
not only within Louisiana, but nationally. 
The extreme loss of tax revenues, which pro-
vide for essential services, coupled with un-
foreseen costs brought onto us by the re-
sponse to COVID–19 pandemic, has the poten-
tial to have an extremely detrimental effect 
on our role to provide for the citizens of our 
parishes. 
I received a letter from more than 80 
mayors across my State giving ‘‘their 
strong support and thanks’’ for efforts 
to pass the SMART Act because they 
know I am working to deliver the sup-
port they need for their communities 
or mutual constituents. And mayors 
ranging from cities as large as Shreve-
port to as small as Glenmora and Ath-
ens wrote: 
The SMART Act would provide funding for 
municipal economic recovery that will sup-
port the reopening of businesses and allow 
Louisiana to move forward. We are grateful 
for Senator CASSIDY’s bipartisan efforts and 
for his longstanding partnership with Louisi-
ana’s governments. 
The 
same 
sentiments 
have 
been 
echoed by Louisiana’s Chamber of 
Commerce. 
I understand concerns about spending 
money on State and local government. 
Some are worried the money will be 
used to bail out poor management deci-
sions and overly generous and un-
funded pension plans. I share those 
concerns, which is why the SMART Act 
includes specific provisions prohibiting 
spending in those areas. The SMART 
Act 
money 
replaces 
lost 
revenue 
caused by COVID–19 and nothing more. 
A city or parish or county would have 
to show their books and show that they 
have lost revenue relative to a year ago 
before they would be eligible to receive 
funding from this. 
I understand concerns about spend-
ing, but the cost of doing nothing is 
worse. Federal Reserve Chairman Je-
rome Powell spoke on the State and 
local funding needs, saying that while 
costly, it would be ‘‘worth it if it helps 
avoid long-term damage and leaves us 
with a stronger economy.’’ 
Congress should not allow police offi-
cers, 
firefighters, 
first 
responders, 
teachers, sanitation workers, and oth-
ers to lose their jobs by the millions at 
a time when our country needs them 
most. The United States cannot fully 
recover economically if local commu-
nities cannot provide basic services, al-
lowing commerce to flow.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4707 
August 4, 2020 
As I end, I commend my colleagues 
on the work thus far on the HEALS 
Act. More work is left to be done, and 
I look forward to working with others 
in this Chamber in the coming days to 
strengthen this bill even further and 
finding a common path forward with 
our Democratic colleagues. We cannot 
let Americans down in this time of tre-
mendous need. By working together, 
we can deliver the support they need, 
and we will be stronger as a nation for 
having done so. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
BLACKBURN). The Senator from New 
Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I 
rise today to join my Republican col-
leagues from Louisiana and Maine to 
make a plea for us to break any par-
tisan logjam and support bipartisan, 
commonsense solutions. I want to espe-
cially commend Senator CASSIDY, who 
from the beginning has joined me in 
this effort and has been true to his 
commitment to the issue and to his 
work. We have engaged in a series of 
conferences with major national orga-
nizations in support of the legislation, 
and I appreciate his leadership in this 
regard. I also appreciate Senator COL-
LINS, who joined us from the very be-
ginning in this effort. 
Exactly 76 days ago—yes, 2.5 months 
ago—Senator CASSIDY and I stood here 
on the floor of the Senate with our col-
leagues Senator COLLINS and BOOKER to 
talk about the challenges facing our 
State and local governments and the 
need for Congress to deliver robust, 
flexible assistance to help them deal 
with the pandemic and economic fall-
out. 
In 76 days, we have seen COVID–19 
sweep across our land. The virus is 
surging in States coast to coast. From 
the Deep South to the Upper Midwest, 
no community has been spared. 
America is no stranger to tough 
times. In just the past 100 years, we 
have fought two World Wars. We have 
faced a Great Depression. We have con-
fronted a nuclear-armed Soviet Union. 
We have faced calamitous disasters, 
both natural and manmade, from Hur-
ricanes Katrina and Sandy to the ter-
rorist attacks on 9/11. We have lived 
through many dark days of our history, 
but no matter how steep the challenge, 
no matter how hopeless things ap-
peared at the moment, we always came 
together as a country, and we saw our-
selves as Americans above all else. 
I am proud to be a New Jerseyan. I 
am proud to be from a State that in-
vests in its people, has a great edu-
cational system, and has an innovative 
economy. But when my parents fled 
tyranny in Cuba, their dream wasn’t to 
move to any one State. No, they 
dreamed of moving to the United 
States of America to give me and my 
siblings the opportunity they never 
had. 
We are not a collection of 50 separate 
States. No, we are one Nation, indivis-
ible. When hurricanes hit the gulf 
coast, flooding inundated communities 
along 
the 
Mississippi 
River, 
or 
wildfires raged in the West, I have 
never hesitated to act and cast my vote 
to help my fellow Americans. I have 
never asked how many New Jerseyans 
were affected or how this would impact 
my State. But some in this body have 
chosen to undermine that unity and to, 
instead, pit Americans in one State 
versus their fellow citizens in another. 
They have derided Senator CASSIDY’s 
and my efforts to avoid millions of lay-
offs of essential workers as a ‘‘Blue 
State Bailout.’’ 
For example, the junior Senator from 
Florida has said he refuses to support 
assistance because it will go to pro-
gressive States like New Jersey, New 
York, and California. He spreads false-
hoods about States carrying over large 
annual budget deficits, even though he 
must be well aware that States, unlike 
the Federal Government, must balance 
their budgets according to their State 
Constitution. 
He has the gall to chide other States 
about taking from Florida, even as his 
own 
State 
is 
the 
second 
largest 
‘‘taker’’ State in the entire country. 
Indeed, according to the latest esti-
mates, Florida receives about $45 bil-
lion more from the Federal Govern-
ment than it pays each and every year. 
By comparison, New Jersey actually 
pays about $21 billion more each year 
to the Federal Government than it re-
ceives. Let me say that again. Florida 
takes $45 billion more per year out of 
the Federal coffers than they put in. 
New Jersey puts $21 billion back in. 
To my colleague from Florida: You 
are welcome. 
Why is New Jersey a donor or 
‘‘maker’’ State while Florida is a 
‘‘taker’’ State? Quite simply, it is be-
cause we invest in our people and in 
our communities. New Jersey has the 
best public schools in the country, 
ranking No. 1 in Education Week’s 2019 
report. Florida, well, it ranked in the 
bottom half of the States. 
A better education leads to a better 
economy with higher paying jobs, so it 
is no surprise that New Jersey also has 
the highest per capita income among 
States at over $110,000 per year. By 
comparison, Florida’s per capita in-
come is almost $35,000 less, which puts 
it, once again, in the bottom half of 
States. 
So if you want your children to have 
a quality education, if you want to 
work in a vibrant economy that cre-
ates high-paying jobs, you should live 
in a State like New Jersey. But New 
Jersey, like all States—and through no 
fault of our own—is facing a health and 
fiscal crisis of historic magnitude. And 
because here in Washington we have 
failed to implement a national re-
sponse to a national emergency, our 
local 
towns, 
cities, 
counties, 
and 
States have to deal with this crisis 
alone rather than united as a nation, 
and they are running out of money. 
They are running out of money to 
combat this deadly disease. They are 
running out of money to maintain the 
services our residents and businesses 
depend upon. They are running out of 
money to pay our first responders: po-
lice, 
firefighters, 
paramedics, 
and 
emergency personnel. They are running 
out of money to make sure that there 
are teachers in the classrooms when 
our kids can safely head back to school 
and nurses in our hospitals when a sick 
patient is brought in. They are running 
out of money to make sure the trash 
gets picked up, the buses and trains 
run on time, and the lights stay on at 
City Hall. 
They have been squeezed on both 
sides of the ledger, spending billions of 
dollars in unforeseen costs on emer-
gency response while watching reve-
nues dry up due to the slowing econ-
omy and necessary orders to contain 
the virus. 
Without help from Washington, our 
States, counties, and municipalities 
will have to swallow a toxic cocktail of 
tax hikes, service cuts, and layoffs that 
will only poison our economic recov-
ery. 
It would be the height of irony—and 
a horrible one at that—for the men and 
women we have needed the most to be 
the ones fired as a result of the eco-
nomic distress that the virus has cre-
ated. We need our essential workers on 
the job dealing with the pandemic, not 
on the unemployment line. 
Already, nearly 1.5 million State and 
local workers have been furloughed or 
laid off—and that is only since Feb-
ruary—and double the total local pub-
lic sector jobs we lost during the entire 
great recession of a decade ago. 
If we fail to deliver the robust, flexi-
ble funding our States and commu-
nities need, we will effectively be send-
ing pink slips to millions of Americans. 
We will be saying to all of them: You 
are fired. 
That will be millions more who 
aren’t collecting a paycheck, millions 
who can’t afford to shop at our stores, 
eat at our restaurants, pay their rent, 
or their mortgage. 
Leading 
economists 
respected 
by 
both parties predict it would decimate 
our economy and send us on the path 
to another Great Depression. We can’t 
allow that to happen. 
That is why Senator CASSIDY, Sen-
ator COLLINS, Senator HYDE-SMITH, and 
I came together. We saw early on the 
impact COVID–19 was having on our 
home States and constituents, so we 
came up with the State and Municipal 
Assistance for Recovery and Transi-
tion, or the SMART Act. 
As Senator CASSIDY says, it delivers 
$500 billion in flexible funding to front-
line States, counties, and municipali-
ties. It targets areas with the greatest 
need based on infection rate and lost 
revenues. Unfortunately, from when we 
started this, that is a growing reality 
across the country. Every single town, 
city, and county, regardless of its size, 
would qualify for direct funding. No 
one is left out.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4708 
August 4, 2020 
We immediately built a bipartisan 
coalition with Senators COLLINS, BOOK-
ER, 
HYDE-SMITH, 
MANCHIN, 
and 
SINEMA—Republicans and Democrats 
from all walks of life, cutting across 
the political and geographic spectrum. 
We knew the assistance Congress pro-
vided our State and local governments 
in the CARES Act wasn’t enough to 
deal with the growing need, and we 
warned our colleagues—each and every 
one—that what was happening in New 
Jersey, Louisiana, and elsewhere would 
eventually come to their State if we 
didn’t get this pandemic under control. 
Well, we haven’t, and it is raging. Our 
fellow Americans are suffering, and too 
many of them are dying. 
We have waited for 76 days. What is 
now being offered is wholly inadequate 
to address the needs of the American 
people. In Colorado, for example, the 
estimated State and local shortfall due 
to the pandemic is $10 billion, and 
counting, through 2022. In Alaska, it is 
expected to exceed $4 billion. In Geor-
gia, it will be $2.5 billion in 2021 alone. 
Kentucky could see nearly a 20-percent 
drop in its revenues in 2021, at a time 
when the State’s fiscal house is already 
in disorder. But we are being offered 
not a dime—zero—to help our cities, 
counties, and States confront this chal-
lenge—zero, nothing. That is not some-
thing that is acceptable. 
That is the problem when we ignore 
regular order and let leadership hijack 
the legislative process: We lose our 
voice, and the needs of our constitu-
ents are left out. 
I, for one, didn’t come to Washington 
to sit on the sidelines and wait for a 
handful of people to reach a deal be-
hind closed doors, forced to vote on a 
1,000-page bill within an hour of seeing 
it. But that is exactly what we have 
been doing here for far too long. 
We need to end this high-stakes game 
of closed-door posturing and restore 
the Senate back to the foundation as 
the greatest deliberative body in the 
world. 
It would have been easier for me just 
to embrace the $900 billion for fiscal re-
lief in the Heroes Act. It would have 
been easier for Senators CASSIDY, COL-
LINS, and HYDE-SMITH to just toe the 
party line, but we all knew that stick-
ing to our respective corners wasn’t 
going to help a single one of our con-
stituents. 
It is not too late for the Senate to 
get back on track. Let’s do our jobs. 
Let’s work together on a bipartisan so-
lution that delivers the Federal sup-
port our States, counties, and cities on 
the frontlines of this pandemic need to 
defeat COVID–19 and serve the Amer-
ican people. 
Let’s bring the SMART Act up in 
committee, allow Members on both 
sides of the aisle to offer amendments 
to make the legislation even better. 
You all know what our State and local 
governments will get if we leave it up 
to the present status—absolutely noth-
ing. Good luck explaining that to the 
people back at home. 
I hear some of my colleagues speak 
from this floor, calling not for unity 
but for division. They callously ignore 
the pleas for help from the fellow 
Americans, comforted by the selfish 
but mistaken belief their communities 
are immune to the fiscal Armageddon 
facing our communities. 
Let me be clear. It doesn’t really 
matter how fiscally responsible or con-
servative your State budget has been 
when your revenue drops 30 percent 
overnight. It is not a random blue 
State issue; it is an American priority. 
I believe that history will look kind-
ly upon those who stood up for some 
unity and compromise over dema-
goguery and obstinacy, those who put 
the well-being of the country over scor-
ing partisan points, those who stuck 
their necks out and took a political 
risk for no reason other than it was the 
right thing to do. That is what I be-
lieve we are doing on the floor right 
now—the right thing. 
With that, I am happy to turn to my 
friend Senator COLLINS. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine. 
Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I 
have listened to the presentations of 
my two colleagues, Senator CASSIDY 
and Senator MENENDEZ, and I could not 
agree with them more. We have an op-
portunity to solve a problem that is af-
fecting each and every community in 
our country. 
With the COVID–19 pandemic con-
tinuing to devastate our public health 
and our economy, towns and cities 
across our country are facing increas-
ingly significant new challenges and 
plummeting revenues at the exact 
same time. I urge my colleagues to be 
problem-solvers, to address this crisis 
as part of the relief package that is 
now being negotiated. We cannot wait. 
I have joined with Senators MENEN-
DEZ and CASSIDY and others in this 
Chamber in introducing the SMART 
Act. It would provide much needed fi-
nancial assistance to State and local 
governments 
while 
providing 
safe-
guards to prevent wasteful spending. 
It is a lifeline to our communities, 
just as the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram has been a lifeline to our small 
businesses and their employees. 
The consequences of local govern-
ment shortfalls are dire. Without our 
providing them relief, communities 
face having to lay off essential employ-
ees and reduced services at the worst 
possible time for working families. 
What is their alternative? They can-
not raise taxes. That would be the 
worst thing for them to do. Municipali-
ties are already scaling back their 
budgets, 
furloughing 
workers, 
and 
postponing 
needed 
purchases 
and 
projects. 
These cuts threaten the jobs of our 
police officers, our firefighters, our 
EMS personnel, our dispatchers, our 
sanitation crews, and our public works 
employees at the time when their serv-
ices are vitally needed. They are the 
people who make our communities op-
erate, who make them livable. We need 
them. 
We already know about the stresses 
our schools are undergoing. Do we real-
ly want school budgets to be cut and 
educators laid off at this important 
time? 
The CARES Act did provide $150 bil-
lion to our States and to very large 
communities, but those funds came 
with restrictions, and they did not re-
quire direct distributions to munici-
palities with populations under 500,000. 
There is not a single county in Maine, 
much less a city or town, that has a 
population of that level. 
The National Governors Association 
has called for $500 billion in assistance 
to aid our Nation’s recovery. Organiza-
tions supporting our towns and our cit-
ies and our counties have all endorsed 
the SMART Act. 
Moody’s Analytics warns that failing 
to act could shave 3 percentage points 
from real GDP, from our economic 
growth, and result in the loss of 4 mil-
lion jobs. That is the worst thing to 
happen at this time. 
This week, the Maine Municipal As-
sociation released projections antici-
pating a combined $146 million in lost 
revenue from Maine cities and towns 
by the end of this year alone. We know 
that the revenues are going to take a 
while to recover and are going to affect 
next year as well. 
This builds on Maine’s Revenue Fore-
casting Committee, which expects a 
$1.4 billion State budget shortfall from 
lost sales and income tax revenues over 
the next 3 years. 
As people are driving less, we are also 
seeing our gas tax revenues plummet. 
I have talked with town and city 
managers, with mayors and members 
of 
town 
councils, 
selectmen 
and 
-women, all across the State of Maine 
about the difficult decisions they are 
facing as they attempt to balance their 
budgets. 
These cuts are not theoretical. The 
harm is not just possible; it is occur-
ring today. Let’s look briefly at what 
some Maine communities are already 
having to do. 
The city of Westbrook has announced 
a hiring freeze affecting all city depart-
ments, including the police depart-
ment. Well, that police department has 
five open positions that it needs to fill 
and cannot do so. 
Auburn, 
a 
city 
in 
Androscoggin 
County, has had to freeze six vacant 
positions because of expected revenue 
losses—again, vital positions: two fire-
fighters, a police officer, and three pub-
lic works employees. These cuts come 
as the city of Auburn has spent more 
than $200,000 in new expenses to re-
spond to the virus. 
The town of Falmouth has elimi-
nated four open positions, including a 
police officer, and can no longer go 
ahead with the purchase of a much 
needed new firetruck. 
The town of Windham has kept seven 
needed positions open. These are not

large communities. This is a large 
number of positions. Five of these are 
public works positions, without which, 
how is the plowing going to be done 
this winter to keep the roads safe and 
clear? 
The town has also postponed $1.6 mil-
lion in capital projects. That has a rip-
ple effect on the local economy. It 
means the contractor is neither buying 
supplies nor hiring employees at this 
time. 
In northern Maine, in the northern 
Maine city of Madawaska, the town 
manager has shared with my office 
that the town has had to scrap a $3 mil-
lion road-paving project and will have 
to keep at least three positions vacant. 
This is what they are doing already. 
It is only going to get worse for these 
towns and cities as revenues continue 
to plummet. 
Senator MENENDEZ made a very im-
portant point that I want to reiterate, 
and that is, the way our bill is struc-
tured, every city, every town, regard-
less of size, will receive direct assist-
ance. Every county will receive direct 
assistance. They will not be dependent 
on the largesse of the State. The 
money will go to them to meet these 
essential needs. 
It is common sense to provide the re-
lief needed to avoid these widespread 
layoffs and cuts to essential services at 
the local level, where they often are 
most often needed. These are the public 
servants who keep our communities 
and our citizens safe. They are the pub-
lic servants who keep our communities 
and our citizens healthy. They are the 
public servants who keep our commu-
nities and our citizens educated. They 
are the ones who are plowing our roads 
and repairing our bridges. They are the 
ones who make our towns, our cities, 
our neighborhoods livable. 
Congress must act to provide assist-
ance to every community. This is a 
problem we can solve. Let’s enact the 
SMART Act as part of the next 
coronavirus package. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CAS-
SIDY). The Senator from Delaware. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I am 
going to briefly remove my mask. 
We are about 1 week into baseball 
season. I will lighten this up a little 
bit. We are 1 week into baseball season. 
Some of us here are huge baseball fans. 
This is the home of the Nationals— 
home of the world championship Wash-
ington Nationals. The best two pitch-
ers come from the Detroit Tigers, my 
favorite team. 
For those who might not have been 
watching baseball over the weekend, 
there is a young guy who is a relief 
pitcher for the Tigers. His name is 
Tyler Alexander. He was brought in in 
relief in the second or third inning and 
struck out nine straight bats. He 
struck out the first nine batters he 
faced. I think one other person has 
done that in Major League history. 
So, as we gather here today to figure 
out how to get out of this mess, his job 
that day was to try to figure out how 
to get out of another mess, and my 
hope is that our efforts here in the Sen-
ate, the House, and the White House 
will be as successful as were his. 
I am happy to follow today our friend 
from Maine; our colleague from New 
Jersey; and you, Mr. President, as the 
Senator from Louisiana, in actually 
pointing to something we can agree on. 
People are always saying to me and, I 
know, to my colleagues when we go 
home: Can’t you guys and gals ever 
agree on anything? 
Well, as it turns out, a number of us 
agree that States and local govern-
ments could use some help—some addi-
tional help beyond that which we have 
already provided. That is a good thing. 
We don’t have to pit blue States 
against red States. We can actually 
work together, and in this case we are. 
Very few of us actually come here 
and start our first elected job being in 
the U.S. Senate—some, but not a lot. A 
number of people are former mayors, 
former Governors, former Representa-
tives. But every now and then, some-
body slips through without ever having 
run for elected office. 
I am a former State treasurer. People 
call me a recovering Governor, but I 
am really a recovering State treasurer. 
I was elected State treasurer when I 
was 29. When I was elected State treas-
urer and took my oath, our State had 
the worst credit rating in the country. 
I was elected in 1976—the same year 
that a Republican named Pete du Pont 
was elected Governor of our State. He 
turned out to be a terrific Governor at 
a time when we needed one. He was a 
good mentor for me and someone I al-
ways looked up to, and I hope I was a 
good partner to him and Democrats 
and Republicans in the legislature to 
pull our State out of a real mess. 
Not only did we have the worst credit 
rating in the country that year—1977, 
actually—we had the worst credit rat-
ing, we had no pension fund, we had no 
rainy day fund, and we had the lowest 
start rate of new businesses of any 
State in America. 
We couldn’t balance our budgets if we 
had to. In order to actually have 
money to spend, we issued revenue an-
ticipation notes. 
When I got to the State treasurer’s 
office, I said: What is a revenue antici-
pation note? 
They said: That is the way the State 
borrows money until tax monies come 
in the following April, so that we can 
actually pay payroll and pensions and 
stuff like that. 
I said: You are kidding. 
They said: No, we are not. 
That was then; this is now. When 
Pete du Pont was our Governor and I 
was treasurer, we had a bipartisan leg-
islature. The house and senate were 
split between Democrats and Repub-
licans. But we created a rainy day fund 
and never invaded it. We created and 
fully amortized our pension fund. We 
had no pension fund. We fully amor-
tized it within about 10 years. We did 
all kinds of things, all kinds of budget 
reforms in order to get us on the right 
track. 
Now, I have heard some of my col-
leagues say the States got themselves 
in a mess and they are going to have to 
get out of it. They said they can file for 
bankruptcy; they are badly managed. 
Let me just say, my State is a AAA 
State. We got a AAA rating when I was 
Governor, and we never lost it to this 
day. 
Most States are better run fiscally 
than the Federal Government. You 
only have to look at the way we spend 
money around here—not just in the 
middle of a pandemic. Look at the year 
before the pandemic, at how much our 
Nation’s deficit and debt increased. But 
even fiscally responsible, well-managed 
States like Delaware and some other 
States that are represented on this 
floor right here are finding themselves 
in a situation that one could not have 
imagined just a few months ago. That 
is especially true when we have an ad-
ministration that is simultaneously 
asking State and local governments to 
shoulder the burden of responding to 
the coronavirus. 
Leader MCCONNELL
and Secretary 
Mnuchin say that States don’t need 
more money because they haven’t used 
the coronavirus relief funds that Con-
gress provided in the CARES Act. Well, 
unfortunately, that is just not true. A 
survey conducted by the National As-
sociation of State Budget Officers 
shows that States have already allo-
cated nearly 75 percent of these funds 
already to fight the pandemic and help 
struggling families and small busi-
nesses through this crisis. 
If States across this country see a re-
surgence in infection rates, the cost of 
addressing the health and economic 
crisis is not going down; it is going up. 
At the same time that the cost of ad-
dressing 
this 
pandemic 
has 
sky-
rocketed, businesses are shuttered, and 
tourism and commerce have come, in 
many places, to a standstill. That 
means that hundreds of billions of dol-
lars in lost revenues for States and 
local governments have occurred. 
Delaware is certainly not alone. So 
let me be very clear. This is not a red 
State or a blue State problem; it is a 
United States problem. It is not a con-
sequence of poor management either. 
Over the past couple months, weeks, 
I have had conversations, as my col-
leagues know, with dozens of them on 
both sides of the aisle about what 
States and local communities across 
our country are facing as a result of 
COVID–19. In those conversations with 
my Democratic and Republican col-
leagues, time and again I have heard a 
familiar refrain: The pandemic has 
caused State and local government rev-
enues to plummet in a way that none 
of us have ever experienced or would 
have or could have foreseen. 
Income tax revenues have fallen and 
unemployment numbers have reached

August 4, 2020 
unprecedented levels over the course of 
just a few months. Delaying Federal 
tax deadlines—while it was the right 
thing to do—has wreaked havoc on the 
ability of States to balance their budg-
ets. Sales tax collections and revenue 
from tourism, gas taxes, and tolls have 
dried up as the virus has compelled 
many people to just stay at home. And 
States highly dependent on oil and gas 
revenues, as the Presiding Officer’s 
State is, have been doubly hit by the 
pandemic and turmoil in global energy 
markets. 
Unlike 
the 
Federal 
Government, 
State and local governments have to 
balance their budgets. This means that 
Governors, State legislators, and local 
officials—mayors, 
city 
and 
county 
councils—have had no choice but to 
make deep cuts that will inevitably 
hurt the ability of their communities 
to recover. 
Since the pandemic hit our country, 
State and local governments alone 
have lost 1.5 million jobs. 
Let me say that again. Since the pan-
demic hit our country, State and local 
governments alone have lost 1.5 million 
jobs. 
Those are not private sector jobs. 
Those are not Federal Government 
jobs. Those are just State and local, 
county jobs: teachers, firefighters, po-
lice, and more. 
This 
staggering 
statistic 
is 
bad 
enough on its own, but what does it 
mean if you aren’t one of the one in 
every eight American workers who is 
employed by a State or local govern-
ment? 
Here is what it means. Cuts to edu-
cation budgets means larger class sizes. 
It means fewer bus drivers. It means 
fewer custodians at a time when 
schools are struggling to figure out 
how they will reopen safely this fall. 
I talked earlier this week to a num-
ber of our finest school superintendents 
in Delaware. We talked about—they 
are struggling—how to open up and re-
open schools. As it turns out, they are 
going to have to hire more bus drivers 
if schools reopen—more bus drivers be-
cause kids will be separated. They have 
to separate kids. You can’t put as 
many kids on the school bus. They are 
going to have to hire substitute teach-
ers. If somebody gets sick and they are 
unable to come to work, they will have 
to hire a substitute teacher and pay for 
them as well. And for nurses, it is the 
same way. To be there to help admin-
ister—whether it is taking people’s 
temperatures or administering tests 
and that kind of thing, we are going to 
need more health professionals in our 
schools rather than fewer. 
Cuts to first responder budgets mean 
people must wait longer for EMTs and 
firefighters to arrive during emergency 
situations. 
Cuts in transportation budgets mean 
canceled or delayed infrastructure— 
transportation 
infrastructure 
projects—and fewer construction jobs 
when we are in the middle of the sum-
mer construction season. 
These cuts impact all of us and cre-
ate a ripple effect across the broader 
economy. That is why economists 
across the political spectrum, includ-
ing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome 
Powell, agree that State and local 
budget cuts will weigh down our path 
to economic recovery, not just for a 
couple of weeks, not just for a couple of 
months, but for years to come. 
In fact, based on evidence from the 
last recession, one recent economic re-
port found that every dollar in cuts 
cost the overall economy $1.50 to $2. 
That is one reason the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce has called for additional 
Federal aid for States and for cities. 
The Chamber also recognizes that its 
lost revenue will force officials out of 
State and local levels to either miss 
payments or raise taxes in order to 
make up the shortfall. 
We know that this is impacting every 
part of our Nation. The longer we wait 
to get much needed assistance for our 
State and local governments, the more 
our communities will suffer and the 
more at risk we put our entire econ-
omy. 
We are here. We are sort of like al-
most in overtime. In fact, we are in 
overtime when it comes to the supple-
mental unemployment insurance bene-
fits having expired. We don’t have time 
to wait. Let’s pass long overdue assist-
ance. Let’s pass it so that our home-
towns and our States don’t take an 
even bigger hit that we can’t afford but 
a hit that is avoided. 
With that, I want to yield to some of 
my colleagues who are here to present 
their own perspectives, and we look 
forward to hearing from them. The 
first one, right out of the starting 
block, is a former Governor of New 
Hampshire—like me, a recovering Gov-
ernor—and a terrific U.S. Senator, 
MAGGIE HASSAN. 
I am happy to yield the floor to Sen-
ator MAGGIE HASSAN. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Hampshire. 
Ms. HASSAN. Thank you, Mr. Presi-
dent, and thank you to my colleague 
from Delaware, not only for the kind 
introduction but for the very articu-
late overview that he just gave of the 
challenge before us and the importance 
of providing aid in this next relief 
package to State and local govern-
ments. They have been at the forefront 
of our Nation’s response to COVID–19. 
They provide people and businesses 
with vital support, scouring the world 
for personal protective equipment, set-
ting up testing centers, and providing 
emergency relief for families and busi-
nesses. They also employ millions of 
essential public employees who are on 
the frontlines of this crisis, including 
first responders, teachers, and many 
others. 
Unfortunately, as this crisis rages 
on, State and local communities are 
facing uncertainty, mounting costs, 
and a devastating loss of revenue. For 
too long, the Senate majority leader, 
Mr. MCCONNELL, stalled action on an 
additional relief package, which has 
only made matters worse. 
Now, as negotiations are finally un-
derway, we must ensure that the next 
relief bill provides significant addi-
tional Federal resources to support 
State and local governments’ efforts to 
save lives, protect the public’s health, 
and keep the economy moving. 
As my colleague from Delaware men-
tioned, I am a former Governor. I un-
derstand the challenges that State and 
local officials are experiencing. In New 
Hampshire, following public health 
guidance, local and State officials took 
necessary steps to close down portions 
of the economy in order to save lives. 
They are now feeling the impacts of 
revenue shortfalls directly related to 
those actions, all while keeping up 
their efforts to provide the frontline 
services necessary to save lives and 
provide economic relief. 
In a virtual roundtable with mayors 
and municipal leaders from all across 
the Granite State last month, officials 
described to me the dire situation that 
they are up against. Dover Mayor Bob 
Carrier stated: ‘‘The tsunami of lost 
revenue is on its way.’’ Claremont 
Mayor Charlene Lovett noted how 
budgetary strains are halting infra-
structure projects. With the added bur-
den of increased expenses and loss of 
revenue, Claremont risks falling be-
hind on much needed infrastructure 
improvements like fixing roads. And a 
number of mayors explained their chal-
lenges with budgets for the upcoming 
school year. 
As educators and parents make deci-
sions on whether schools will be in per-
son, remote, or a hybrid version, local 
officials are facing deep uncertainty 
about what the operational costs for 
schools will be. Situations like these 
are playing out in cities and towns all 
across our country. 
Without additional funding from the 
Federal Government, States will be 
forced to slash education, to slash in-
frastructure, and to slash public health 
budgets, which would be devastating, 
especially in the midst of a pandemic. 
It is not just a loss in the services that 
people depend on. Millions of addi-
tional jobs would be lost as well—not 
only the jobs of public workers, by the 
way, but, for example, the private ven-
dors who often do some of this work. 
Think about construction workers on 
an infrastructure project. 
Moody’s 
Analytics 
reported 
that 
without significant Federal support for 
State and local governments, 4 million 
more people—4 million more people— 
could lose their jobs. That loss would 
be 
catastrophic. 
The 
ripple 
effect 
would be felt throughout our entire 
economy. We can’t let that happen. 
Senate Democrats are focused on pro-
viding significant economic relief for 
State and local governments through-
out our country because we recognize 
that it is essential for economic recov-
ery. And, as part of our efforts to sup-
port economic recovery, we must en-
sure that States have the flexibility to

use this funding to backfill revenue 
loss due to COVID–19 and preserve jobs. 
Providing this funding will mitigate 
some of the economic damage caused 
by this pandemic. 
In addition, as we have heard from 
local leaders, from educators, from par-
ents, it is vital that we provide sepa-
rate, dedicated funding for schools. 
Senate Democrats have proposed $430 
billion to help schools implement pub-
lic health protocols, address the chal-
lenges of students who have fallen be-
hind, and provide quality education to 
all students, regardless of how the 
schools reopen. 
Our approach stands in stark con-
trast to the inadequate proposal put 
forward by Senator MCCONNELL, which 
provides too few resources to schools 
and would actually withhold aid if 
schools don’t fully reopen in person, 
even as the administration has failed 
to provide supplies and a strategy that 
would support such efforts to reopen. 
We need our Republican colleagues to 
work with us and deliver sufficient re-
lief without any further delay. We need 
to provide State and local govern-
ments—as well as our schools, our first 
responders, our teachers—with strong 
bipartisan support from the Federal 
Government. 
I know that right now in New Hamp-
shire, even as teachers face uncer-
tainty, they are making lesson plans 
and trying to figure out how they are 
going to make sure that their children 
engage in their remote learning at 
home if their school system doesn’t re-
open, while providing services to their 
students as well. 
All across our State, I know that if 
today’s heavy rains caused flooding, 
our public workers will be out there 
around the clock protecting their com-
munities. I know that our law enforce-
ment, our firefighters will continue to 
respond to calls whether or not they 
have enough personal protective equip-
ment because that is what they do. 
They protect, and they serve. They do 
it with dedication, and they do it with 
commitment. They provide essential 
services that keep our communities 
safe and healthy. It has never been as 
important as it is now. 
All we are asking is that we come to-
gether across party lines, with the 
White House, and support our State 
and local governments in this time of 
need so that we can continue to fight 
this pandemic and so that we can con-
tinue to mitigate the economic harm 
that is ravaging our country. 
That is what State and local aid will 
provide to the people of New Hamp-
shire and the people of our country. 
That is what this moment—this mo-
ment of the worst healthcare crisis 
that we have seen in 100 years and the 
worst economic crisis since the Great 
Depression—that is what this moment 
demands. The livelihoods of millions of 
Americans and the lives of millions of 
Americans depend on our taking action 
right now. 
I yield the floor to my colleague from 
Ohio. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I thank 
Senator HASSAN for her leadership. She 
speaks about State government and 
local government so well because she 
was Governor of New Hampshire. She is 
one of only two women in American 
history who has been a Governor and a 
Senator—a senator, a Governor, and 
then a Senator. Thank you for your on-
going leadership. 
Senator CARPER, thank you for lead-
ing this effort. 
We know Senator MCCONNELL’s office 
is down the hall there. For months, we 
have been begging—begging—Senator 
MCCONNELL, begging President Trump 
to do something, to actually let us do 
our jobs. We wanted to legislate. We 
wanted to do the things that Senator 
HASSAN has just talked about. 
I am not really sure how MITCH 
MCCONNELL
has spent his summer. 
What I do know is that in May, the 
House of Representatives passed the 
Heroes Act. It helped local govern-
ments. It helped people stay in their 
homes so they wouldn’t be evicted. It 
helped our public school system. It pro-
vided $600 to unemployed workers, and 
what is remarkable about that is even 
during this pandemic, we haven’t seen 
the poverty rate go up in this country 
because of the $600 per week that mil-
lions of unemployed workers are re-
ceiving, which they have earned. 
The House did that in May. I don’t 
know what Senator MCCONNELL
has 
done 
since—through 
May, 
through 
June, through July, now into August, 
and, finally, he comes up with some-
thing. We have asked him to extend the 
unemployment insurance for literally 
the hundreds of thousands of workers 
in my State, the thousands of workers 
in Nevada, the tens of thousands of 
workers in Louisiana. We have asked 
the President and the majority leader 
to extend that unemployment insur-
ance. 
But do you know what? 
It is pretty unbelievable to hear of 
people on this side of the aisle making 
$175,000 a year as U.S. Senators—most 
of my colleagues are millionaires—and 
they complain that these unemployed 
workers are getting $600 a week. They 
complain that these workers are get-
ting too much money as we earn 
$175,000 a year. 
Last week, Senator MCCONNELL fi-
nally came up with a plan that does 
nothing to extend the $600 a week and 
that does nothing to keep people in 
their homes and help them pay the 
bills. The last thing we should want is 
a tidal wave of evictions so that people 
will have to go into crowded homeless 
shelters or sleep in their cousins’ base-
ments because they don’t have places 
to live. 
The bill does nothing to help State 
and local governments. Their plan has 
zero 
dollars 
for 
communities—for 
Clark County, OH, or Clark County, 
NV. We know how hard their budgets 
have been hit. Ohio’s Governor has al-
ready announced $750 million in State 
budget cuts, including for education 
and Medicaid, and counties and cities 
and towns are facing similar impos-
sible choices. We know, with there 
being hundreds of thousands of Ohioans 
out of jobs, if they don’t get the $600 a 
week, it will mean that more of them 
will go into poverty, that more of them 
will have trouble feeding their fami-
lies, and that more of them will go into 
homeless shelters. It will only get 
worse if we don’t step in. 
Let’s be clear about what it will 
mean if we don’t get more funding. It 
will mean the layoff of teachers, the 
layoff of firefighters, the layoff of chil-
dren’s services workers. It will mean 
less money for schools—and not just to 
buy new technology they need for re-
mote learning. School costs have gone 
up. They have to make the buses safer 
and the cafeterias safer and the tech-
nology for remote learning and the 
classrooms safer. It will mean fewer re-
sources 
for 
schools 
to 
expand 
broadband and close the digital divide. 
It will mean putting critical infra-
structure projects on hold. It will mean 
property tax hikes and sales tax in-
creases. 
I have talked to mayors and teachers 
and school board members. I spend a 
good chunk of my time, as I know my 
colleagues do, on virtual roundtables 
and conference calls. I talk to mayors 
and teachers, school board members 
and firefighters, chambers of com-
merce, county health commissioners, 
and university and college presidents. 
I was on the phone yesterday with 100 
county commissioners in Ohio—most of 
them Republicans. I had a call orga-
nized by the Richland County Chamber 
of 
Commerce—my 
hometown—with, 
probably, mostly Republicans. Last 
week, it was the Cincinnati Chamber— 
probably mostly Republicans—the Ohio 
college presidents, and Northeast Ohio 
parents and educators. There was an-
other call with Southwest Ohio parents 
and educators. 
In every one of these calls, I heard 
the fear in people’s voices and the de-
mand that we do something—that we 
don’t just walk away like President 
Trump and MITCH
MCCONNELL
are 
doing. They are going to either raise 
taxes on Ohioans who are hurting or 
they are going to lay off workers and 
cut services people rely on. 
One issue that comes up over and 
over is the fear that communities are 
being set back years in our fight 
against addiction. The addiction crisis 
didn’t go away; it just got layered on 
top of this new health and economic 
catastrophe. If we don’t get State and 
local governments additional funding, 
they are going to cut addiction serv-
ices, and they are going to cut mental 
health services. You know that, clear-
ly, the number of child abuse cases has 
gone up during this but not the re-

child abuse. Also, the social workers 
who go into the homes have been laid 
off. 
We need to be clear about what 
‘‘mass layoffs’’ means. It means, if a 
county in Ohio cuts the staff for 
schools, it is not just the individual 
educators who get hurt; obviously, our 
kids suffer, and the economy suffers. It 
means a longer recession, a deeper re-
cession. Yet Senator MCCONNELL says 
20 people on his side of the aisle are 
just going to walk away. They are not 
even willing to vote for help for 
schools, for unemployed workers, for 
people about to be foreclosed on or 
evicted, or for local governments. You 
know, the stock market is doing OK, 
but the stock market is not the econ-
omy. 
We will not have a real recovery 
until we invest in the real economy in 
communities in Ohio and Nevada and 
Arkansas and across this country. 
Ohioans shouldn’t have to fend for 
themselves in the middle of a once-in- 
a-generation crisis. That is essentially 
what the Trump-McConnell plan—if 
you can even call it a serious plan— 
tells Ohio communities: You are on 
your own. You are on your own. 
We must pass a recovery bill, and it 
must include new, flexible funding. 
Trust the communities. Trump and 
MCCONNELL don’t trust local commu-
nities. They send a few dollars here and 
there. They attach strings to it be-
cause they don’t trust local commu-
nities. I trust my local school boards. I 
trust my local county commissioners. I 
trust my local mayors. We have to get 
them help. They know what is best for 
their communities. Let them do their 
jobs. 
Senator MCCONNELL
and President 
Trump, let us do our jobs. 
I yield the floor to the junior Senator 
from Nevada. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nevada. 
Ms. ROSEN. Mr. President, I rise 
today because our States, cities, and 
Tribes are in trouble, and they des-
perately need our help. 
State, local, and Tribal governments 
are on the frontlines in this fight 
against the coronavirus. We have seen 
local leaders in each of our States step 
up during this difficult time to do what 
is necessary to mitigate the spread of 
this virus, to protect the health and 
well-being of their residents, and to 
prevent critical industries and institu-
tions from failing. 
Their goal is the same as ours—to 
protect the lives and livelihoods of the 
people whom they represent. I know 
this to be true in Nevada, where dedi-
cated heroes are working tirelessly to 
combat the COVID–19 pandemic in 
every corner of the Silver State. How-
ever, this proactive and necessary re-
sponse has not come without a cost. In 
addition to the coronavirus, Nevada 
must also deal with an alarming budg-
et shortfall that has been exacerbated 
by a struggling economy that relies on 
tourism and a massive drop in tax rev-
enue. 
Before this crisis began, Nevada had 
not mismanaged its State’s finances. 
The State had a record-low unemploy-
ment rate of 3.6 percent, and we had a 
rainy day fund for emergencies, but we 
have needed to use hundreds of mil-
lions of dollars from that rainy day 
fund in order to try to address our 
budget shortfall. Nevada has a tough 
road ahead and difficult choices to 
make, but Nevada is not alone. Many 
States across the country are identical. 
They are in similar situations. Red and 
blue States are facing this very chal-
lenge due to no fault of their own. Cit-
ies and towns are struggling to contain 
the health and fiscal impacts of this 
pandemic. 
During a special session of the Ne-
vada 
State 
Legislature, 
lawmakers 
overwhelmingly approved a resolution 
to ask Congress and the Trump admin-
istration for funding for State, local, 
and Tribal governments in order to 
help offset an expected $1.2 billion 
budget shortfall caused by this pan-
demic, and they needed the flexibility 
to spend it based on local needs. 
Nevada’s Governor, Steve Sisolak, of-
fered a stern warning, one that applies 
to the whole Nation: Without addi-
tional Federal support for State and 
local funding, States will be ‘‘forced to 
make impossible decisions regarding 
funding critical public health, edu-
cation, and more.’’ 
Without additional State and local 
funding from Congress, our State’s 
budget shortfall will make it over-
whelmingly 
difficult 
to 
provide 
healthcare to everyone who needs it, to 
fund our local school systems, and to 
pay our first responders, and it would 
leave countless Nevadans in distress 
who rely on public programs. 
The 
CARES 
Act 
established 
a 
coronavirus relief fund to support 
States, Tribes, and large local govern-
ments. In Nevada, that funding has 
helped to provide support for Medicare 
providers, which has allowed continued 
healthcare for our seniors and treat-
ment for those high-risk COVID–19 pa-
tients. It has provided for enhanced 
testing and contact tracing in our com-
munities. It has provided for childcare 
programs that are used by essential 
workers. It has provided home-deliv-
ered meals, home healthcare, and sup-
port for families and their caregivers. 
It has provided PPE and critical sup-
plies, like gloves and masks and sani-
tizers. 
Does any of this sound unnecessary 
to you? 
This crisis isn’t over, and those needs 
are still here. I have spoken to mayors 
and county commissioners across Ne-
vada, and they are worried. They must 
make it through to the other side of 
this crisis. They want to protect and 
they want to secure their communities. 
They are counting on us. They are 
counting on Congress to have their 
backs in this effort. Congress must en-
sure that support reaches all Ameri-
cans in every kind of community. 
One of the CARES Act relief fund’s 
shortcomings was that it provided no 
direct support to cities and localities 
with populations under 500,000. For a 
State like Nevada, that means, except 
for Las Vegas, every other city in the 
Silver State would be excluded from di-
rect funding from the Federal Govern-
ment. That is why, in April, Senator 
CORTEZ MASTO and I joined Senator 
HEINRICH
in 
introducing 
the 
Coronavirus Community Relief Act— 
legislation that would provide $250 bil-
lion in new stabilization funds directly 
to cities and counties with populations 
under 500,000. 
We know State and local leaders are 
the ones best equipped to respond to 
their communities’ unique needs, and 
they are desperate. They desperately 
need the resources to do this. Unfortu-
nately, Leader MCCONNELL has refused 
to allow the Senate to take up the He-
roes Act—legislation passed by the 
House that provides continued support 
for State, local, and Tribal govern-
ments, including those cities and coun-
ties with under 500,000 residents. It rec-
ognizes that the pandemic continues to 
damage our communities and that this 
recovery will take time. 
The Heroes Act would allow States to 
pay for frontline healthcare workers, 
first responders, teachers, and other 
workers, and would continue to provide 
those essential services to all of our 
residents. The House passed the Heroes 
Act over 80 days ago—80 days ago— 
while the majority leader’s own pro-
posed legislation, the HEALS Act, does 
absolutely nothing to address the crit-
ical issue of State and local funding. 
Without action, States across the Na-
tion will face consequences that could 
have a devastating impact on countless 
lives. History will judge the way we 
treated each other during this pan-
demic. Each of us in the U.S. Senate is 
in a position to do something—just 
something. I implore my colleagues to 
consider the lives of their constituents, 
to really pay attention, to really hear 
what is happening in their commu-
nities and in communities across this 
Nation—in town after town, in city 
after city—and I want them to remem-
ber that we are all in this together. 
I yield the floor to the great senior 
Senator from the State of Nevada, 
CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BOOZMAN). The Senator from Nevada. 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
you can hear the passion not only in 
my colleague Senator ROSEN, with 
whom I am proud to stand side by side 
to represent the great State of Nevada, 
but in all of the Senators on the floor 
today in their talking about this par-
ticular issue. 
At kitchen tables all over the coun-
try, including in Nevada, families are 
sitting down and are pouring over their 
budgets. Too many of them are trying 
to figure out how to stretch those 
budgets with no income, and they are 
making difficult decisions on which 
bills need the most urgent attention. 
Our State and local and Tribal gov-
ernments across this country are doing

the same thing. With the economic 
downturn caused by the coronavirus 
pandemic, State and local governments 
have less revenue at a time when they 
need those resources to combat the 
virus and keep Nevadans safe. That is 
why, when Congress passed the CARES 
Act in March, the Democrats fought so 
hard for funding for State, local, and 
Tribal governments. 
We wanted to make sure that State 
and local governments had enough cash 
on hand to cover the urgent costs of 
the pandemic so that they could keep 
services running and expand their re-
sponses during this crisis. We needed to 
guarantee these governments could 
cover the costs of emergency shelters 
for COVID patients. We had to make 
sure that frontline responders had 
enough personal protective equipment 
on hand for them to do their jobs. We 
also wanted local governments to help 
people stay in their homes. We allo-
cated $150 billion from the coronavirus 
relief fund for State, local, and Tribal 
governments in March. That was a 
compromise. We came together. We 
worked together to solve that problem. 
I heard on the floor of the Senate today 
that there is bipartisan support for this 
funding as well, but we all knew back 
in March, when we passed the $150 bil-
lion as part of the CARES Act, that it 
was not going to be enough. 
We weren’t sure, but now we know it 
is not enough, and we have to do some-
thing about it. 
We are seeing across the country how 
local governments and States are deal-
ing with this pandemic. 
Senator ROSEN just noted that in Ne-
vada, we are in the middle of a special 
session. The Governor had to call a spe-
cial session of our legislature because 
we have a budget hole of about $1.2 bil-
lion related to COVID–19 pandemic and 
the impact it has had. 
What is that impact? It is the impact 
we all have asked across this country. 
Listen, we are in the middle of a health 
crisis. Until we have that vaccine, we 
have to keep people safe. And the one 
thing that we have asked them across 
the country, including in the State of 
Nevada, in every county, is that if you 
shelter in place, if you go home, if you 
shut your business and help us stem 
the spread of this virus, we will take 
care of you. We will help you put food 
on the table. We will help you pay your 
rent, make sure you have a roof over 
your head, pay your utility bills. We 
will put money in your pockets. 
Oh, and by the way, we will make 
sure that those small businesses have 
access to liquidity so that when we can 
come outside and outdoors again safely 
and securely, our economy will spring 
back that much quicker. 
Unfortunately, when we asked every-
one across the country to follow that 
advice and stay safe, we made a com-
mitment to them as well—a long-term 
commitment—that we would continue 
to work together in a bipartisan way to 
solve this problem and make sure that 
people and individuals had money in 
their pockets and that businesses had 
access to liquidity so that we could get 
through this crisis together. 
In Nevada—and we have seen this 
conversation 
happening 
across 
the 
country—schools are opening in just a 
few short weeks, and many of the lead-
ers in my State at the State and local 
level are looking to Washington for 
help. 
Most States aren’t allowed to borrow 
to meet these expenses, and I know our 
esteemed majority leader has thought 
that bankruptcy is an option for them, 
but I can tell you that for me and for 
Nevada, this is not an option. It just 
cannot happen. 
In the State of Nevada, like most 
States, they are required by law to bal-
ance their budgets. Tribal councils, 
county commissions, and the Nevada 
State Legislature are doing what fami-
lies have been asked to do—they are 
coming together to ask themselves how 
they can pay the most urgent bills in 
that big stack of bills that are coming 
due right now. They are working 
around the clock to get Nevadans the 
support they need to deliver the serv-
ices 
they 
expect—everything 
from 
fighting wildfires that are happening 
right now in Nevada and across the 
West to rethinking how we address and 
open our schools safely for our kids and 
for our staff, for the teachers and the 
administrators. But those repairs that 
are required for our roads and bridges— 
the work that still needs to be done on 
a daily basis—have to continue. So 
governments across this country are 
continuing to juggle those many needs. 
On top of all of that, we know we 
want them to all securely hold 2020 
elections. We want to make sure that 
our families are connected to school 
and work, that there is no homework 
gap, and that Medicaid benefits to 
those in need are available. We need to 
keep EMTs on the job and help busi-
nesses comply with safety regulations 
during the middle of this pandemic. 
With all these demands, States haven’t 
been able to keep up with those essen-
tial bills. 
I will tell you this: I have talked to, 
in my State, like many of us do—we go 
home, or when we are here, we make 
sure that we are communicating with 
so many people across our State. 
In Nevada, we have beautifully di-
verse communities, and we have urban 
and rural areas. I have talked to the 
leaders of all of our counties, our city 
governments, 
and 
our 
Governor. 
Whether they are Republican or Demo-
cratic or Independent, there is still one 
thing in common: They want us to 
come together to find a solution to 
help and support them during this time 
when there is no revenue coming in be-
cause our economy has been ground to 
a halt as we address this health crisis. 
They have all asked both me and 
JACKY ROSEN, Senator ROSEN: Please 
continue to fight for us and make sure 
that the money not only is there and 
available, because we need it to keep 
our constituents safe, but make sure it 
is flexible. Make sure we have the op-
portunity not just to work through the 
State, but that the money goes di-
rectly to some of our local govern-
ments, who I have found—and I don’t 
know, as you all go home, but I have 
found that the money that we did give 
to them through the CARES Act has 
been put to good use because—do you 
know why—because local and State 
governments and Tribal governments 
know what their communities need. 
Why should we dictate to them if 
they want to use that money to help 
people who need rental assistance at 
this point in time or if they want to 
use that money to put food on people’s 
tables because they are not working? I 
mean, isn’t that what this is about—all 
of us working together to help our fam-
ilies across this country, to make sure 
we can all stay safe but still pay those 
bills and still keep our families safe 
and make sure our businesses are 
taken care of. 
But I know this: At the end of the 
day, in the middle of a crisis, our gov-
ernments at the State, local, and Trib-
al government level are the social safe-
ty nets. Where do you think our con-
stituents go when they need that help? 
So I think and know that we have an 
obligation at the Federal level to con-
tinue to work with our State and local 
governments and our Tribal govern-
ments to provide them the necessary 
resources that are needed right now in 
the middle of this pandemic because 
our economy has been ground to a halt. 
So I think it is time for our body to 
come together and do what the Amer-
ican people expect of us, which is to 
work in a bipartisan way to solve this 
problem and really look at how we can 
continue the funding that is necessary 
for our State and local governments. 
Families not only in Nevada but across 
this country expect that of us now. 
So I would hope the majority leader 
would be willing to bring to the floor 
whatever bill is appropriate to have 
this discussion. And I will tell you, 
there are three out there right now. 
There is the Heroes Act, there is the 
SMART Act, which has bipartisan sup-
port, and there is the Coronavirus 
Community Relief Act. There are three 
bills. Let’s bring them to the floor. 
Let’s have this discussion, with the 
focus on coming together to get the 
funding to our State and local govern-
ments and our Tribal communities 
that is needed right now. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Hawaii. 
Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, we are 
on the precipice of a depression be-
cause of politics. Right now, every sin-
gle State and most counties and most 
cities are experiencing a budget crisis 
like they haven’t seen in generations. 
Tax revenues are down due to high 
unemployment, rising healthcare costs, 
and the drop in consumer spending and 
emergency relief costs continue to sky-
rocket, and that means our States, our 
cities, and our towns have run out of

August 4, 2020 
money or are quickly running out of 
money. But in the latest proposal, the 
Republicans allocate nothing at all to 
State and local government. You heard 
that correctly. In midst of the biggest 
public health crisis in a century, Re-
publicans will not send a single dollar 
in emergency aid to our States, our cit-
ies, and to our counties. 
Economically, this is just ridicu-
lously bad. It will cost roughly 4 mil-
lion jobs, and it will have a direct im-
pact on GDP and on the programs and 
services that we need in order to come 
out on the other side of this pandemic. 
Budget shortfalls among State and 
local governments are approaching half 
a trillion already, and for my home 
State of Hawaii, we are confronting 
over a billion dollars in losses. 
Unlike the Federal Government, our 
State and local governments are oper-
ating with finite amounts of dollars. 
They don’t have an unlimited line of 
credit. And a majority of States re-
quire a balanced budget by the end of 
the year. So it is one thing for States 
and counties and municipalities to jug-
gle and survive for a few months by 
moving money around, using cash flow 
management, paying bills late, relying 
on rainy day or reserve funds, but they 
can’t do that forever. By now, many 
have burned up their reserves, and the 
cupboard is bare, and the bills are due. 
The decisions that the Republicans 
are making right now—the official pol-
icy as it relates to funding local gov-
ernments is to force millions to be laid 
off in the middle of the worst pandemic 
in 100 years. 
Refusing to send aid to States and 
local governments isn’t just cruel; it is 
bad economic strategy. Moody’s re-
leased a report projecting that it could 
shave as much as three full percentage 
points from GDP—three full percentage 
points from GDP. 
There are certain things that are not 
within the U.S. Senate’s control as it 
relates to GDP, but this is a choice we 
are about to make—to lay off public 
service workers, to actually—I mean, 
we passed the PPP program, which ba-
sically subsidizes keeping people em-
ployed. We passed this expanded unem-
ployment insurance, which—as Senator 
CORTEZ
MASTO
pointed 
out, 
we 
mandatorily said: Stay home, and we 
will take care of you. Now the official 
public policy of the Republican con-
ference is to lay off firefighters and 
nurses and teachers. 
I know that we get real heated in 
terms of our rhetoric sometimes on the 
Senate floor, and we accuse the other 
side of things that are maybe shading 
the truth in ways that are unfavorable. 
But I just want to point out that that 
is the official public policy of the Re-
publicans right now—that States and 
counties and cities get zero; firehouses 
get zero; public health nurses get zero; 
teachers get zero—and that if they had 
their 
way, 
they 
would 
pass 
a 
coronavirus aid package that forces us 
to lay people off—public health nurses, 
public school administrators, public 
sanitation workers, teachers—in the 
middle of a situation where the virus is 
much worse than it was 3 months ago 
and the economy is much worse than it 
was 3 months ago. 
So I reject the premise that this is 
some sort of Democratic ask. Now, I 
could go through the list of the Na-
tional Conference of Mayors, the Na-
tional Governors Association, the Na-
tional Conference of State Legisla-
tures—all of the organizations that on 
a bipartisan basis represent govern-
ance. They all want State and county 
relief to come into this package. I 
could go through that, but I just reject 
the premise on a human level that we 
have to demand, as though it is some 
sort of progressive wish list—it is not a 
carbon tax, right? It is not criminal 
justice reform. It is not gay rights. 
This is allowing firefighters to stay 
employed. This is allowing our public 
hospitals not to lay off people in the 
middle of a pandemic. This is allowing 
our school systems not to lay off teach-
ers. 
This isn’t a Democratic ask, this is 
an American ask, and I reject the 
premise that the leader of the Senate, 
MITCH MCCONNELL, is going to treat 
this as something that is to be traded 
for. We don’t trade for keeping our fire-
fighters employed. We don’t trade for 
keeping our nurses employed. We just 
do that because it is the right thing to 
do, and we especially do that in the 
middle of the worst public health crisis 
in a century and the worst economic 
situation we have had in almost a cen-
tury. 
I reject the idea that Leader SCHU-
MER and Leader MCCONNELL and Speak-
er PELOSI and Secretary Mnuchin have 
to cut a deal on State and local fund-
ing. Every single Member of the U.S. 
Senate, as soon as this ends up in the 
bill, is going to take credit for it. They 
are going to say: Look, I got you 
money. But let the record reflect that 
the proposal from the Republican con-
ference was that States, counties, and 
municipalities get zero, and that is not 
tenable. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Hampshire. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I 
wanted to join my colleagues on the 
floor today to support legislation that 
would address the needs that we are 
hearing from State and local govern-
ments and that would support bipar-
tisan legislation to address this pan-
demic. That is what we have had to 
date, and there is no reason why we 
can’t get there this time. 
As you know so well, last week the 
United States crossed a devastating 
milestone. More than 150,000 Ameri-
cans, including 417 Granite Staters, 
have died due to complications from 
COVID–19. Sadly, as we all know, those 
numbers 
keep 
increasing. 
The 
coronavirus pandemic has also wreaked 
havoc on our economy. The Commerce 
Department reported on Friday that 
our gross domestic product had shrunk 
to nearly 33 percent—the sharpest eco-
nomic decline in modern American his-
tory. 
For months, my colleagues and I 
have been coming to the floor, week 
after week, urging the majority to take 
up proposals that would provide crit-
ical changes to our healthcare system 
and comprehensive relief for our econ-
omy, but what we have gotten is a 
package that fails to address many of 
the concerns I have heard from Granite 
Staters. 
The bill that was presented to this 
Senate by the Republican majority 
doesn’t provide dedicated funding to 
help nursing homes and long-term care 
facilities, which are the most vulner-
able to COVID–19. In fact, in New 
Hampshire, 80 percent of our deaths 
from coronavirus have been to people 
in long-term care facilities—the high-
est percentage in the country. 
This package doesn’t include housing 
assistance and eviction protections. It 
inadequately funds testing, and it pres-
sures schools to reopen in order to re-
ceive assistance. 
Importantly, the bill lacks any sup-
port for State and local governments 
that are struggling to maintain essen-
tial services while they are also on the 
frontlines 
battling 
this 
pandemic. 
Every day, mayors and community 
leaders tell me about what they are 
facing—the massive reduction in local 
tax revenues and increased costs due to 
COVID–19 response efforts. These chal-
lenges have left our State and munic-
ipal governments in dire straits. 
I would like to read an excerpt from 
a letter I received from Mayor Joyce 
Craig, the mayor of Manchester, New 
Hampshire’s largest city. She says: 
Prior to the COVID–19 pandemic, Man-
chester was thriving. Over the past two 
years, we saw over $250 million in new, pri-
vate investments in economic development; 
we expanded air service from the Man-
chester-Boston Regional Airport; and we 
were seeing a continual decrease in opioid 
overdoses. But due to the COVID–19 pan-
demic, our bright path forward has grown 
foggy, and I am concerned about what lays 
ahead for my city. 
Mayor Craig goes on to say that 
since 
the 
pandemic 
began, 
Manchester’s revenue is down by over 
$3.5 million, including a $1.6 million de-
crease in property taxes that are col-
lected. In total, the State of New 
Hampshire expects to experience a 
budget shortfall of nearly $540 million. 
That is about a 20-percent drop in 
State revenues. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the letter I quoted from 
Mayor Craig of Manchester be printed 
in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4715 
August 4, 2020 
JULY 27, 2020. 
Senator JEANNE SHAHEEN, 
Washington, DC. 
Senator MAGGIE HASSAN, 
Washington, DC. 
Congressman CHRIS PAPPAS, 
Washington, DC. 
Congresswoman ANNIE KUSTER, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SEN. SHAHEEN, SEN. HASSAN, REP. 
KUSTER & REP. PAPPAS: Thank you for your 
leadership in the midst of this global pan-
demic. 
As you know, New Hampshire’s cities and 
towns are on the front lines of responding to 
COVID–19. Day in and day out, we see the di-
rect impact this pandemic is having on our 
residents, businesses, and non-profits. It’s a 
time of disruption like we have never experi-
enced before. 
None of us know how long this crisis will 
last, but we are thankful for your tireless ef-
forts 
to 
advocate 
for 
Granite 
Staters 
through the ‘Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and 
Economic Security (CARES) Act. I am writ-
ing you today to urge you to support and ad-
vocate for sending additional relief directly 
to municipalities like the City of Man-
chester in the ‘Health and Economic Recov-
ery Omnibus Emergency Solutions (HE-
ROES) Act. 
Prior to the COVID–19 pandemic, Man-
chester was thriving. Over the past two 
years, we saw over $250 million dollars in 
new, private investments in economic devel-
opment; we expanded air service from the 
Manchester-Boston Regional Airport; and we 
were seeing a continual decrease in opioid 
overdoses. But due to the COVID–19 pan-
demic, our bright path forward has grown 
foggy, and I am concerned about what lays 
ahead for my city. 
Just as many small businesses and cor-
porations are struggling, so are our munici-
palities. In an effort to reduce the financial 
burden on our citizens and business, local 
governments have absorbed many costs, 
which has resulted in a significant reduction 
in revenue. Since the pandemic began, our 
City’s revenue is down by over $3.5 million to 
date, including a $1.6 million decrease in 
property taxes collected, and a $750,000 in 
parking revenue reduction. Additionally, our 
partners, like the New Hampshire Fisher 
Cats, are asking for financial help from the 
City to ensure they make it through this dif-
ficult time. 
While Manchester and other New Hamp-
shire cities and towns have received some ad-
ditional funding through the CARES Act, we 
are extremely limited in the way that we’re 
able to use these funds. We are often unable 
to be reimbursed for the expenses that the 
City needs most at this time, like revenue 
losses, property tax relief and affordable 
housing. 
We have had to make hard decisions to 
keep our city afloat. City departments have 
had to hold 28 vacancies, have put a freeze on 
all non-essential spending, and have been 
forced to reduce some City services, like 
parks and recreation activities and facilities. 
Our city employees have gone above and be-
yond to fill these gaps, but without addi-
tional funding, our staffing and service re-
ductions will continue to grow. 
Our citizens are fueling the burden of the 
COVID–19 pandemic. Many have had their 
hours cut back or have lost their jobs. They 
have lost childcare, and some are on the 
verge of losing their homes. At this difficult 
time, cities need to be increasing the serv-
ices that it offers to our residents, not de-
creasing them. Manchester is facing an af-
fordable housing and homelessness crisis 
that has been exasperated by COVID–19. As 
we inch closer to the moratorium on evic-
tions being lifted, it is more important than 
ever that municipalities like Manchester re-
ceive federal funds that can be used to pre-
vent homelessness and alleviate our housing 
crisis. 
Just as financial assistance was sent di-
rectly to individuals and small businesses 
impacted by COVID–19, the cities and towns 
managing local responses to this pandemic 
should be allocated the necessary resources 
to properly care for our citizens. 
I appreciate the work that you are all 
doing in Washington to fight for the people 
of New Hampshire. When you are fighting for 
the Granite State in Congress, I urge you to 
keep the State’s municipalities in mind. 
Sincerely, 
JOYCE CRAIG, 
Mayor, 
City of Manchester. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Today, I also spoke 
to the mayor of Nashua, Jim Donchess. 
The mayor told me that he expects to 
lose 10 percent to 20 percent of the rev-
enue base in Nashua. That is $7 million 
to $15 million. That means that serv-
ices would be affected and workers 
would have to be laid off. 
In fact, as he told me, if he had to 
take all of the savings that he would 
need to achieve from the revenue losses 
from just one agency, it would result in 
laying off half of the entire police de-
partment in the city or laying off 150 
to 200 teachers. Obviously, that is not 
tenable. 
I also heard from the mayor of Ber-
lin, Paul Grenier, the mayor of New 
Hampshire’s northernmost city. He 
told me because of the impacts of 
COVID–19, the State of New Hampshire 
is also facing revenue shortfalls. As I 
said, they are expecting about $540 mil-
lion in revenue losses. As he said, if the 
Federal Government doesn’t provide 
some help to State and local commu-
nities, his city of Berlin is expected to 
lose not just any potential funding at 
the Federal level but State funds it had 
budgeted for because it was antici-
pating that it would get State funding 
as it usually does. So losing help from 
Congress in any COVID–4 package 
would have a double impact on the city 
of Berlin and other cities and munici-
palities across New Hampshire. 
I heard from mayors, town adminis-
trators, from local leaders, and from 
our 
Republican 
Governor 
Kirsten 
Noonan. All of them are grappling with 
whether they will be able to fund the 
services that they have committed to, 
whether they will have to lay off first 
responders, 
firefighters, 
police 
and 
teachers if Federal assistance doesn’t 
arrive soon. 
New Hampshire is not alone. We just 
heard Senator SCHATZ talking about 
the impact on Hawaii and Senators 
CORTEZ
MASTO
and ROSEN
talking 
about the impact on Nevada. Everyone 
who has been to the floor is talking 
about what will happen in their States 
if we don’t do something to help. 
No State could have anticipated the 
economic fallout from this pandemic. 
That is why it is essential that Con-
gress provide Federal support to help 
State and local governments as they 
respond to this crisis. 
We have done that before in the bi-
partisan CARES Act. New Hampshire 
was able to receive $1.25 billion to help 
reimburse the State for its COVID–19 
response. These funds have been used 
in New Hampshire to create relief pro-
grams for county and municipal gov-
ernments, small businesses, nonprofits 
of all sizes, frontline workers, and for 
healthcare providers. But of course, as 
we know, that money is running out, 
and so more needs to be done. 
We need State and local funds to pro-
vide additional support for families 
who are experiencing housing insecu-
rity or homelessness, minority- and 
women-owned small businesses and in-
dividuals in recovery or are in need of 
mental health services. New Hampshire 
has been severely affected by the 
opioid epidemic, and people who have 
substance use disorders are feeling the 
impact of this coronavirus perhaps 
more than their neighbors and other 
people in our State. 
In addition to providing dedicated 
funding for State and local jurisdic-
tions, the next relief package should 
remove bureaucratic restrictions pre-
venting these governments from using 
emergency relief funds as they see fit. 
Congress should also provide dedicated 
funding for counties, cities, and for 
municipalities with fewer than 500,000 
residents. They need access to this 
funding because they are just as much 
on the frontlines—the rural commu-
nities in my State—as the biggest cit-
ies in this Nation. Communities of all 
sizes are facing substantial loss of rev-
enue due to COVID–19, and they need 
our help. 
Local leaders are calling out for help. 
We can’t just sit idly by and let these 
governments go bankrupt, as the ma-
jority leader suggests. 
This shouldn’t be a partisan issue. 
We all have a common interest in pre-
serving as much of our economy as pos-
sible so that we are positioned for a 
full and robust recovery once we get 
this coronavirus behind us. So I would 
hope that all of my colleagues in the 
Senate would recognize the urgency of 
this situation we are in and that we 
will take up and pass legislation that 
will provide assistance to State and 
local governments and provide the re-
lief that Americans are calling for. 
The House passed legislation more 
than 2 months ago. Too much time has 
been lost, and it is time for Congress to 
act now. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CAS-
SIDY). The Senator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, we are 
heartbroken for the more than 155,000 
Americans we have lost in this pan-
demic. We are grateful for those on the 
frontlines—the doctors, nurses, the 
healthcare workers who have served 
and sacrificed, and we are committed 
to finding a better way forward. 
There is no excuse for how this virus 
has spread here in the United States. 
We have the capacity, the expertise, 
but we have not demonstrated the co-
ordinated 
strategy 
or 
Presidential 
leadership to overcome this pandemic

and economic disaster. Instead, the 
President engages in a pattern of de-
nial and delay, downplaying the scope 
of this crisis. 
This failed approach has led to thou-
sands of premature deaths, double-digit 
unemployment, shuttered businesses, 
and spiking infection rates throughout 
the country. The economy will not 
snap back until we get COVID–19 under 
control and until States and commu-
nities have the resources they need to 
get a handle on this public health 
emergency. 
The costs of fighting COVID–19 is ris-
ing. State and local budgets are now 
under severe strain while demand for 
essential 
public 
services, 
including 
medical care, safety, and sanitation, is 
going up and up and up. Moreover, 
schools need additional resources to re-
open and support students, and the rev-
enue that is coming in to our States 
and cities and towns is insufficient. 
Without more help, they will be 
forced to make drastic cuts which, in 
my State, could mean cutting critical 
funding 
for 
hospitals 
and 
nursing 
homes in a State with one of the oldest 
populations in the country, zeroing out 
the State’s job training program, clos-
ing a prison facility, cutting Medicaid 
eligibility for vulnerable adults, and 
reducing 
childcare 
reimbursement 
rates, impacting working families and 
childcare 
providers 
throughout 
the 
State. 
With State and local governments 
forced to lay off more workers, the un-
employment crisis worsens, the cus-
tomer base for Main Street shrinks, 
and the economy slides even further 
away from rebuilding. Indeed, the U.S. 
economy 
shrank 
at 
a 
32.9-percent 
annualized pace between April and 
June. 
We must break this vicious cycle by 
passing another emergency relief pack-
age that is right-sized to the challenge. 
The CARES Act is about $1.7 trillion, 
a huge number—difficult to fathom. It 
wasn’t enough. Not even close. In fact, 
the pricetag was smaller than the 2017 
Republican tax bill. Those who now 
claim they can’t afford to help the un-
employed 
and 
the 
communities 
throughout America are the same who 
quickly passed that $1.9 trillion tax bill 
in 2017, which largely benefited big 
businesses and the very wealthy at the 
expense of the average taxpayer who 
needs our help now. 
If there was a will then to spend so 
much so quickly on an ill-conceived 
and misdirected tax bill, the majority 
should have no qualms about spending 
whatever it takes now to beat this 
virus that is attacking our citizens and 
our economy. 
For starters, we need improved test-
ing and contact tracing, more support 
for our hospitals and healthcare pro-
viders, and an effective approach to 
vaccine development and distribution. 
All while preserving as much of our 
economy as we can to have a strong 
foundation from which to rebuild and 
rebound. 
As Federal Reserve Chairman Jay 
Powell said last Wednesday, ‘‘The path 
of the economy is going to depend to a 
very high extent on the course of the 
virus, on the measures that we take to 
keep it in check. . . . We can’t say it 
enough.’’ 
That is why we need additional and 
flexible Federal assistance for State 
and local governments that are fight-
ing this virus on the frontlines while 
also trying to keep their local econo-
mies afloat. I said before the CARES 
Act passed, we needed $750 billion for 
State and local governments to do 
both. The CARES Act included $150 bil-
lion, and I have new legislation to pro-
vide $600 billion more. 
We should support our State and 
local governments because they sup-
port our economy and, just as impor-
tantly, they protect our constituents 
from COVID–19. 
By standing in the way of additional 
Federal funds for State and local gov-
ernments, Republicans may force these 
governments to raise taxes on our con-
stituents, make additional cuts to crit-
ical services, or worst, do both. Let’s 
avoid more self-inflicted pain. 
Getting a handle on COVID–19 also 
means keeping families in their homes 
and avoiding waves of evictions and 
foreclosures that would lead to a major 
spike in homelessness, which would 
likely mean more infections. 
At the same time, we should con-
tinue expanded unemployment benefits 
and provide nutrition assistance so 
people 
in 
desperate 
circumstances, 
through no fault of their own, can af-
ford to pay their bills and eat. We must 
provide relief for the hardest hit busi-
nesses, many of which will continue to 
be shut down for the foreseeable future, 
including relief to the transportation 
sector. 
Any agreement should also include 
more help for childcare providers, pub-
lic schools, and college campuses to 
safely reopen, and support for libraries 
to keep our communities connected. 
We must do all of this so that once we 
have gotten a better handle on the 
coronavirus, we have enough workers 
and businesses with which to rebuild 
our economy. 
We also can’t lose sight of the need 
to safeguard our election infrastruc-
ture. Our Nation and our economy 
can’t take any more uncertainty. Hand 
in hand with that is supporting the 
U.S. Postal Service and its employees, 
who will play an integral role in deliv-
ering mail ballots and are continuing 
to provide a lifeline to Americans. 
For the past 60 consecutive years, 
Democrats and Republicans have come 
together to strengthen our national se-
curity by passing the National Defense 
Authorization Act. I hope we can carry 
this same spirit of courtesy and co-
operation as we craft the next fiscal re-
lief package. Indeed, our national secu-
rity also depends on the critical pillar 
of a strong and vibrant economy. We 
need to act sooner rather than later on 
a comprehensive and robust fiscal 
package. 
With that, I yield the floor in the 
hopes that we will move quickly to leg-
islation that will satisfy the needs of 
our cities and towns of all Americans 
so we can move forward together. 
Thank you.

ator from West Virginia.

TRIBUTE TO GEORGE KAROS 
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor and thank a very good 
friend of mine, Mayor George Karos of 
the city of Martinsburg—I said his 
name wrong, and I don’t want to do 
that because he is a good friend of 
mine—for his great service to the city 
of Martinsburg and the entire State of 
West Virginia. 
He was always really great to work 
with and always gave credit to staff, 
and he did it with such good humor. 
George is the son of Greek immi-
grants who did not speak English when 
they came to this country. They moved 
to Martinsburg before he was born. 
George was born in the early 1930s. 
George has called Martinsburg his 
home his entire life. 
Growing up, he worked at Patterson’s 
Drug Store on Queens Street, where he 
swept the floors and rode his bike to 
deliver prescriptions. Over time, he 
worked his way up in the ranks, taking 
over the soda fountain and eventually 
worked as an assistant in the phar-
macy section of the drugstore. 
George did leave Martinsburg briefly 
when he served his country in the U.S. 
Naval Hospital Corps, where he was 
stationed at both Bethesda Naval Hos-
pital and Quantico Marine Corps Base 
in Virginia. He eventually returned to 
his home that he loved—Martinsburg— 
and he returned to Patterson’s Drug 
Store, which he later bought in 1980 
and operated until his retirement in 
2015. He then began a career as a public 
servant. 
George was first elected to the city 
council as a councilperson-at-large in 
June of 1974, where he served for 26 
years. 
Following this, he decided to run for 
mayor of Martinsburg, and he served as 
the mayor for about 20 years and will 
retire this year at the age of 88. 
George and I started our careers to-
gether. I started as his Congresswoman 
in the year 2000, and George started as 
mayor. 
I know I speak for all of those from 
the Martinsburg community when I 
say that Mayor Karos truly made Mar-
tinsburg a better place to work and 
live. 
I have had the honor and privilege of 
working closely with Mayor Karos dur-
ing his entire time serving as the 
mayor of Martinsburg. We had a field 
hearing out in Martinsburg, and I re-
member the mayor being there and 
welcoming us. I see him at many rib-
bon cuttings and openings. I have been 
to his drugstore to be served at the 
counter. He is just a wonderful, won-
derful man.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4717 
August 4, 2020 
One of my proudest moments with 
Mayor Karos was when we successfully 
secured the funds for infrastructure 
improvement, such as the Big Spring 
water plan and the Raleigh Street ex-
pansion project. George also helped 
create The Martinsburg Initiative most 
recently, which is a program I have 
spoken about before many times on the 
Senate floor. 
This initiative is spearheaded by the 
Martinsburg Police Department, the 
Berkeley County Schools, and Shep-
herd University, as well as a wide array 
of local partners, such as the Boys and 
Girls Club of the Eastern Panhandle. 
The goal of the program is to stem 
the horrible opioid addiction problem 
by identifying and trying to eliminate 
the basic causes of drug abuse in at- 
risk families. The mayor has been dedi-
cated to this. The program is ex-
tremely successful and has made a tre-
mendous impact in the Martinsburg 
community. 
It is also a perfect example of how a 
community can come together at dif-
ferent levels and work together to cre-
ate a lasting and impactful solution to 
a big, big problem. 
Through the actions taken under 
Mayor Karos’s administration, count-
less children in the Martinsburg area 
have now seen that there is a life away 
from illicit drugs and opioid addiction. 
George exemplified hard work, dedi-
cation, and loyalty. He still does. This 
is evident in the length of time he 
served his community and also through 
the results that came from his vision 
and his collaboration with so many 
others in Martinsburg. 
The rest of the State agreed with this 
because George was named ‘‘Mayor of 
the Year’’ and ‘‘Public Official of the 
Year.’’ This came as no surprise to me 
and many, many others. 
George’s favorite motto is ‘‘Plan 
your work and work your plan.’’ That 
is what the mayor did. His second 
motto was something I think we could 
probably use around here: ‘‘A closed 
mouth catches no flies.’’ These were 
the words George followed every day 
when he was working as mayor. They 
helped to keep progress moving, and 
they perfectly describe how George 
conducted himself each and every day, 
which is why he was reelected many 
times but also so beloved in his com-
munity. 
After 46 years of devoted service to 
his city and the community, Mayor 
Karos is retiring. While I am sad that 
this chapter is coming to a close, I am 
grateful for the opportunity to work 
together with him to better the city of 
Martinsburg. His leadership, successes, 
and his life mottos will serve as an ex-
ample to follow. 
I really thank Mayor Karos for being 
a good friend and for letting me get to 
know him. I really thank him for his 
service and wish him the very best in 
his retirement. 
I yield back. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I 
had the chance to at least hear the end 
of Senator CAPITO’s speech. I thank her 
for the work she has done on the opioid 
issue that she was talking about. It is 
one of the very productive areas of bi-
partisanship going all the way back to 
CARA with Senator PORTMAN and my-
self. I know West Virginia, like Rhode 
Island, had a terrible situation. I ap-
preciate very much her comments. 
f 
CLIMATE CHANGE 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I 
am here today for a different topic. I 
am here for the 269th time with my in-
creasingly battered ‘‘Time to Wake 
Up’’ poster to try to alert this Chamber 
to the threat of climate change—some-
thing, obviously, Louisiana knows very 
well—and to the forces that are block-
ing action on climate. 
In these climate speeches, I have 
talked often about the insidious en-
croachment on American Government 
of special interest power, which is what 
is behind all this climate denial and 
obstruction. 
It didn’t happen on its own. The fos-
sil fuel industry’s political forces used 
the cover of anonymous funding—what 
we call dark money—and they used 
phony front groups and clever propa-
ganda to accomplish their aims. 
In effect, these fossil fuel political 
forces have run a covert operation 
against our own government. We ob-
serve the disturbances; we hear the 
rustling in the leaves; we see strange 
sites, but many of us haven’t connected 
the dots. Those who are familiar with 
some of the elements may not put the 
whole story together. Some are so ac-
customed to this sinister behavior that 
they think it is normal. Some folks are 
like a city dweller in the jungle, need-
ing a field biologist to identify the be-
haviors going on around them. 
Let me give you this field biologist’s 
overview. We understand pretty well 
the crew of bad actors lurking behind 
climate denial. Democrats in the Sen-
ate have repeatedly called out and re-
ported on this web of denial funded by 
the fossil fuel industry. Investigative 
journalists like Jane Mayer and schol-
ars like Naomi Oreskes have dug into 
this scheme. There is actually a robust 
academic subspecialty that analyzes 
this web of denial as a novel socio-
economic and political phenomenon. 
The covert special interest machin-
ery behind that effort is not just dedi-
cated to opposing climate legislation. 
Another covert operation it runs is 
chronicled in our recent Senate Demo-
crats’ report here that examines the 
bad actors behind the special interest 
Court capture operation. This oper-
ation has crept forward over years, 
even decades. The Republican Party is 
more the tool of this effort than its 
principal. Big donors are behind it. The 
goal here is to fashion for the donors a 
Supreme Court that will not just rule 
for but reset society’s ground rules to 
favor 
the 
big 
donors 
behind 
the 
scheme. 
On yet another front, there has been 
recent public reporting revealing the 
bad actors rushing to stand up a new 
and improved Republican voter sup-
pression apparatus as they start to 
panic about the November election. 
Earlier this year, longtime partisan 
court fixer Leonard Leo stepped down 
from his formal role as executive vice 
president of the Court capture com-
mand center at the Federalist Society. 
At the same time, a mysterious new 
project called the Honest Elections 
Project began voter suppression work 
in swing States like Florida, Nevada, 
Wisconsin, and Michigan. It ran ads ac-
cusing Democrats of cheating with 
mail-in ballots; it sent threatening let-
ters to election officials challenging 
voter rolls; and it filed legal pro-
ceedings—lots of legal proceedings—ar-
guing for more voting restrictions 
ahead of November. 
But in their hurry, they did a weak 
job of covering their tracks. Reporters 
quickly uncovered that the Honest 
Elections Project is a rebrand of the 
Judicial Education Project—a key cog 
in that same Leonard Leo’s machine. 
As the Guardian reporters who broke 
the story observed, ‘‘By having a hand 
in both voting litigation and the judges 
on the Federal bench, [Leo’s] network 
could create a system where conserv-
ative donors have an avenue to both 
oppose 
voting 
rights 
and 
appoint 
judges who would back at that effort.’’ 
Last, we pretty well know who funds 
the massive and often anonymous po-
litical operation that props up the Re-
publican Party. Take 2016, for instance, 
when the fossil fuel billionaire Koch 
brothers’ political operation spent $2 
million on ads targeting viable Demo-
cratic candidates in just two Senate 
races—Ohio and Wisconsin. 
Over a year before the election, they 
were already at work bombing those 
candidates. 
They 
didn’t 
use 
their 
names. They hid behind phony front 
groups. It took years to dig this out, 
but that is what happened. 
The anonymously funded U.S. Cham-
ber of Commerce spent nearly $40 mil-
lion in 2016 and 2018 supporting Repub-
lican House and Senate candidates. 
Dark waves of untraceable dark 
money pour everywhere into Repub-
lican elections. From slips and leaks 
and investigative reporting, we can see 
enough overlap across these four ef-
forts to state the general proposition: 
It is the same crew. 
If you look at it as a covert operation 
run by special interests against their 
own country, it has at least these four 
programs, but it has one set of inter-
ests behind it: They run the climate de-
nial covert op. They run the Court cap-
ture covert op. They rushed out the 
voter suppression op. And, with their 
money, they captured the Republican 
Party to use as their front. 
If this operation were not covert, if it 
were obvious, if the press and the pub-
lic could readily connect the dots, it 
wouldn’t work. People would know it 
was fossil fuel polluter money. They

would get the joke. That is why it has 
to be a covert operation, and that 
means it needs dark money—anony-
mous, untraceable funds. 
A virulent little galaxy of 501(c)(4) 
groups, 
shell 
corporations, 
donor 
trusts, and other screening tools has 
been crafted to anonymize the donors 
and hide the connections. Why? Be-
cause the blood pumping through this 
beast that gives it life is dark money. 
If we expose that secret blood flow, the 
whole beast shrivels up: no dark 
money, no covert operations. 
That is why efforts to expose the 
dark 
money 
donors 
provoke 
such 
hysterical reactions from the front 
groups and from their operatives and 
from their mouthpieces like the Wall 
Street Journal editorial page. 
I have experienced these hysterical 
reactions over and over. Indeed, there 
was one in the news today. This speech 
might provoke even another. 
But at the end of the day, as Ameri-
cans, I believe we share the proposition 
that nothing could be more corrupting 
than large flows of anonymous money 
in politics. That sort of money doesn’t 
even have to be spent to be corrupting. 
The mere threat of a political attack 
can do the job, and the donor saves the 
money. Or it could be a private promise 
of unlimited support. 
Once a political weapon is permis-
sible, private threats and promises to 
use or withhold that weapon are inevi-
table, and they are inevitably cor-
rupting. 
But don’t think the prospect of cor-
ruption daunts the schemers. A polit-
ical regime that allows their corrup-
tion and helps cover up their covert op-
erations is precisely what the dark 
money donors want. 
Why else would we do nothing about 
climate change when it is so obvious? 
Why else would we ignore every re-
spectable scientist in the field? Why 
else ignore warnings of financial melt-
down looming from bankers and econo-
mists across the country, even across 
the world? Why else ignore the fires 
that are burning up Siberia, for Pete’s 
sake, and, closer to home, the flood 
warnings along our coasts and the 
droughts and the floods and the storms 
across our States? 
When astronomers see celestial bod-
ies behave inexplicably, they look for 
the dark star, the black hole that in-
fluences the behavior of the visible 
bodies. Dark money is the dark star, 
the evil star influencing Congress’s be-
havior—or I should say misbehavior— 
on climate change. 
So a preview of coming attractions 
here: The dark-money-funded race to 
capture the Court is also a race by the 
schemers to establish a new constitu-
tional doctrine protecting their dark 
money schemes. Such a doctrine is al-
ready being grown in the dark-money- 
funded ideological hothouses, a theory 
that dark money anonymity is pro-
tected by the First Amendment rights 
of association and petition—a theory 
giving powerful interests the constitu-
tional right to run covert operations 
against their own government, leaving 
regular citizens beguiled or bewildered. 
That theory may seem ludicrous, 
and, indeed, this notion got only the 
one vote from Justice Thomas in Citi-
zens United, but remember that Thom-
as is the dark money crowd’s leading 
indicator on the Court. 
Don’t scoff. This argument is now 
popping up all over the corporate right-
wing. Twice so far I have had corporate 
entities from whom I requested infor-
mation about their dark money deal-
ings ‘‘plead the First’’ in response to 
my questions. 
The game is on, whether we realize it 
or not, and one of the stakes in the 
game is climate action. We cannot be 
idle about this. Groups that run covert 
operations against our own country are 
not to be trusted with that country’s 
welfare. 
What a foul convergence it would be 
if the dark money schemers used dark 
money to fund a Court capture oper-
ation that delivered a Court-created 
doctrine hatched in dark money hot-
houses, protecting that dark money 
from disclosure for eternity, perma-
nently etching into our Constitution 
this pathway of corruption. 
As I have said over and over, take 
away the corrupting dark money weap-
onry from the fossil fuel industry, and 
we solve climate change. We have lost 
a decade to Citizens United, the deci-
sion that gave this industry the weap-
onry to kill climate bipartisanship. It 
is a decade we and our children will rue 
having lost. 
Let’s lose no more time. Let’s, once 
and for all, root out the corrupting 
dark money machinery, expose its ne-
farious and crooked covert operations, 
shut it down, and start running a real 
democracy around here again. 
If we can’t do this now, then let’s 
pray for an election that lets us do it 
soon. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
f 
THE GREAT AMERICAN OUTDOORS 
ACT 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I am 
here on the floor today to talk about 
some positive news and some positive 
news that happened just today. It is 
not about the coronavirus. It is not 
about politics. It is not about Hurri-
cane Isaias. 
It has to do with some urgent and 
historic help for our national parks, 
something that is really important to 
all of us. We all love our parks. 
Today President Trump signed into 
law the landmark Great American Out-
doors Act, landmark, bipartisan legis-
lation that will protect and conserve 
our public lands. I am happy to see this 
effort finally cross the finish line be-
cause the natural beauty and rich his-
tory of America is something that we 
must preserve for future generations. 
A big part of the new law is bipar-
tisan legislation that is called the Re-
store Our Parks Act that I have worked 
on for more than 3 years with my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle. Sen-
ator MARK WARNER from Virginia was 
my partner in this, as well as Senator 
LAMAR ALEXANDER of Tennessee and 
Senator ANGUS KING of Maine. Our leg-
islation involves urgent stewardship of 
our national parks, which is something 
that I have spent more than a dozen 
years working on. I guess I shouldn’t 
admit that. Sometimes things take a 
long time around here. But going back 
to my days as Director of the Office of 
Management and Budget under Presi-
dent George W. Bush, I started focusing 
on this issue of the backlog of mainte-
nance projects at our national parks. 
It is alarming. It has been growing. It 
now adds up to over $12 billion, far 
more than the parks could ever afford 
to take care of based on the annual 
budgets we provide them from Con-
gress. By the way, the annual budget 
from Congress for all operations and all 
maintenance is less than $3 billion. Yet 
there is a $12 billion maintenance 
backlog. 
When Teddy Roosevelt started the 
national parks, he wanted to preserve 
some of the most beautiful, pristine 
lands in America. He wanted to be sure 
they were going to be there for public 
use. It was a good decision. We now 
have 84 million acres of parkland all 
around the country. Some are those 
beautiful, pristine places like Yosemite 
and Yellowstone and the Tetons with 
spectacular, beautiful vistas, but oth-
ers preserve our history. 
We have historical parks around the 
country. We have battlefields that we 
have preserved around the country to 
tell the story of our country, good and 
bad. We have Presidents’ homes that 
have been preserved to be able to help, 
again, tell the story of America. 
Recently, I was at one of our na-
tional park sites in Ohio, and it is the 
home of an individual who was the first 
Black colonel in the United States 
Army. He was also the first Black su-
perintendent of a national park. The 
home is also a site on the Underground 
Railroad, so it is a place where people 
can go and see where escaping slaves 
were harbored and understand more of 
the history, not just of slavery but also 
of the cooperation and the seeking for 
freedom that came out of the Under-
ground Railroad. This is the Charles 
Young home near Xenia, OH. 
So our national parks are really im-
portant for so many reasons. Yet, dur-
ing the past couple of decades, we 
haven’t taken care of them as we 
should, and this backlog has built up. 
People appreciate our parks. During 
the past decade or so, we have had an 
increase of about 58 million in the 
number of visitors to our national 
parks. More are coming every year. 
Why? It is a relatively inexpensive va-
cation. They are beautiful. People from 
all over the world know about our na-
tional parks, and it is one of the things 
they love about America. 
The problem is that, when these peo-
ple visit the parks nowadays, they are

going to find that, over the years, we 
haven’t kept up with these mainte-
nance needs so the water systems, the 
roads, the bridges, the bathrooms, the 
visitor centers, some of the trails— 
many of these are now in bad shape. 
Some are closed, actually. 
When you go to a national park, you 
may find that a facility is closed be-
cause of a lack of funding for the de-
ferred maintenance. We just haven’t 
had the funding to do the capital im-
provements they need so that they can 
stay functional. 
Just the other week, I saw that first-
hand at Cuyahoga Valley National 
Park in Northeast Ohio. It is a great 
park. It is the 13th most visited na-
tional park in America. It kind of runs 
between Cleveland and Akron, OH. 
It suffered from these deferred main-
tenance problems for years. I saw a 
crumbling trail. I saw trails that were 
falling into the Cuyahoga River and 
couldn’t be used. I saw rusting historic 
train tracks that run through the park. 
It is a tourist railroad that runs 
through. Train tracks are an expensive 
thing to replace. Again, it has to be 
done. I saw a bridge that was really un-
safe to be on and has to be restored. It 
is a historic bridge. We want to pre-
serve it, but the costs are just too high 
given the annual budget for that park. 
Their maintenance backlog at that 
park alone is $50 million, yet their an-
nual budget is about $11 million, which 
goes to the rangers and the programs 
and the maintenance and operations 
but is not enough money to take care 
of these big problems. 
In a way, by not fixing these prob-
lems, we are also increasing the cost. 
Think about it. These costs compound 
year after year. In your own house, you 
might think about what happens if you 
don’t fix the leak in the roof. What 
happens is the drywall begins to have 
problems. You might have mold. The 
floors begin to get wet and wood floors 
begin to buckle. You have additional 
costs that, if you had just fixed that 
roof, you wouldn’t have. 
Well, that is where we are with the 
parks. If we take the time and the ef-
fort to make the fixes now, we will 
save money over time for taxpayers be-
cause 
we 
will 
not 
have 
the 
compounding costs. Every day, it gets 
worse and worse. 
Now, finally, we have come up with a 
way to deal with it. Congress has asked 
our parks, over the last few years, to 
give us their deferred maintenance 
projects with specificity: What are 
your priority projects? What are the 
top priorities? We have asked them to 
lay it out in detail. 
It has been very helpful because we 
now know we have over $12 billion in 
maintenance needs but about $6.5 bil-
lion of that is high-priority projects— 
the projects most in need of immediate 
attention. We know what they are. 
They are shovel-ready. They have been 
vetted. We are proposing a source of 
funding to be able to deal with that be-
cause, again, the annual appropriations 
process does not come near enough to 
matching what we need to have done. 
The highest priority needs at the 
parks is about $6.5 billion. In this legis-
lation—now law of the land—royalty 
income is taken from onshore and off-
shore oil and gas, and some of that roy-
alty is directed toward this use. 
The next 5 years, enough of that 
funding will be there to deal with the 
$6.5 billion, half of the maintenance 
backlog. We would like to do better, 
but, frankly, this is historic. Never 
have we had so much funding go to the 
parks, never have we been able to deal 
with these backlogs that have built up 
over years. 
It is really a debt unpaid. That is 
how I look at it. It is something we 
should have been doing all along. We 
weren’t. The costs have now snow-
balled, and now we need to deal with it. 
It is not so much a new responsibility 
as it is stewardship we never did in the 
first place. It is a debt unpaid. 
Second, again, it is going to save us 
money over time—assuming we want 
the parks to be working, we want the 
trails to be open, we want the visitors 
centers to be welcoming—all of which, 
of course, we do want and we must 
have. 
The bill is not just important for our 
parks but also our economy, too, be-
cause these projects are infrastructure 
projects. We have talked a lot about 
that here on how to get more jobs into 
our economy right now. With the im-
pact of coronavirus on our economy, 
we need more opportunities out there. 
Infrastructure is one. These are infra-
structure jobs—over 100,000 new jobs in 
this legislation alone. 
Again, these projects are shovel- 
ready. They are vetted. They are ones 
that Congress—thanks to our asking 
the Park Service for the information— 
knows what jobs are out there and 
what projects need to be done. 
It is a long-term investment too. As 
of 2019, visitor spending in commu-
nities near our parks resulted in $41.7 
billion of benefit to the Nation’s econ-
omy and supported 340,000 jobs. It is 
new jobs in terms of construction, but 
it is also ensuring the parks continue 
to be able to be attracting these visi-
tors, which adds such a big economic 
boost to our economy. 
I am proud that Congress has come 
together as Republicans and Democrats 
in a nonpartisan way to support this 
important initiative, and I am thank-
ful for the President and his support. 
He showed bold leadership by saying: 
You know what, we are going do this. 
Other Presidents have talked about it. 
In the last three or four administra-
tions, we have talked about it. Again, I 
have been working on it for a dozen 
years. Now we have actually been able 
to do it. 
I also want to thank the Director of 
Office of Management and Budget, 
Russ Vought, for his help; the Sec-
retary of the Interior, David Bernhard; 
and other members of the President’s 
team, including Ivanka Trump, who 
has always been strongly supportive of 
our national parks. 
This is about responsible steward-
ship. These repairs were a debt unpaid. 
We are finally addressing them before 
the cost increase. Our parks have stood 
tall for more than a century now as the 
embodiment of American history and 
our shared commitment to preserving 
some of our most magnificent lands. 
Thanks to Restore Our Parks Act, we 
will now ensure that those parks stand 
tall for centuries to come. 
f 
HEROES ACT AND HEALS ACT 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I also 
want to talk this afternoon a little 
about 
the 
Heroes 
legislation, 
the 
HEALS legislation, and some of the 
commonalities I see between the two. 
On the floor of the Senate this week, 
there has been some discussion about 
the need for us to come together in a 
bipartisan way to put together a pack-
age to deal with the coronavirus. Some 
call it the COVID 5.0 package. It is 
really probably 8.0. We have done a lot 
of legislation already, but there are 
things that still need to be done and 
some urgent matters, including dealing 
with the expiration of the unemploy-
ment insurance. 
I am on the floor today to talk about 
how I see the opportunity for us to 
move ahead by looking at some of the 
commonalities 
between 
the 
Demo-
cratic support and the Republican sup-
port for different legislation. As we all 
know, the discussions over the past 
week have not moved forward as quick-
ly as we would like. In fact, it is pretty 
discouraging. Despite the fact that 
many people thought the Heroes Act 
was really a messaging bill—POLITICO 
wrote a story, one of our news media 
sources up here—and said: ‘‘a mes-
saging bill that has no chance of be-
coming law.’’ Others made the same 
comments. Why? Because it was a $3.5 
trillion pricetag for legislation, which 
would make it by far the most expen-
sive bill ever passed by either House of 
Congress. But also, at a time when we 
had $1.1 trillion leftover from the 
CARES package and States have only 
allocated an average of about 25 per-
cent of their CARES Act funding, it 
seemed like pushing taxpayers to foot 
the bill for the costliest legislation in 
history maybe wasn’t the right way to 
go. 
Also, it had virtually no support 
from Republicans. Also, this legislation 
included a lot of stuff that had nothing 
do with COVID–19. The sense was: Yes, 
it is an important messaging bill for 
Democrats—that is out there—but that 
we needed to figure out a way now to 
come together as Republicans and 
Democrats. 
Leader MCCONNELL also introduced 
legislation. That legislation is called 
the HEALS Act. It is time for us to fig-
ure out how to come together and fig-
ure out a solution going forward. Par-
ticularly with regard to some of these

August 4, 2020 
urgent matters like unemployment in-
surance, we are already past time. Un-
employment insurance already expired 
last Friday. We have to move forward 
with that. We should not be playing 
politics with people’s livelihoods and 
making this a political football. 
Last week, and again today, my col-
league 
from 
Arizona, 
Senator 
MCSALLY, introduced what I thought 
was a great commonsense idea: Let’s 
extend the existing unemployment in-
surance, $600 per week Federal supple-
ment, for another week while we con-
tinue these negotiations so that people 
are not going to see their unemploy-
ment insurance checks decrease sub-
stantially. They would lose all the Fed-
eral benefit unless we do that. They 
would still have the State benefit but 
lose the $600 per week. 
Unfortunately, 
Senate 
Democrats 
said no, objected to this commonsense 
idea. I don’t quite get that. I think we 
ought to keep the $600 in place while 
we negotiate for the next week, and we 
ought to be sure and put the interests 
of the American people first and come 
to a commonsense solution. Now isn’t 
the time for games. It is the time to 
get it right. 
I also note that with regard to unem-
ployment insurance, there are lots of 
ideas out there. For the last few 
months, I have been proposing the idea 
of a return-to-work bonus. Maybe that 
is not the best idea. Maybe people have 
better ideas. The notion there would be 
the $600, which is the current Federal 
benefit, allows people on unemploy-
ment insurance, in many cases, to have 
more income on unemployment than 
they would working. 
According to the studies that have 
been done, including by the University 
of Chicago, about 68 percent of the peo-
ple on unemployment insurance are 
making more money on unemployment 
insurance than they were making at 
work. 
Most 
Americans, 
including 
most 
Members of this Chamber—Republicans 
and Democrats alike—think that is not 
right. You shouldn’t make more not to 
work. 
Unemployment 
insurance 
is 
meant to give you a little help. In 
Ohio, it is about 50 percent, up to a cer-
tain cap, but it is not meant to replace 
your wages, plus—which is what is hap-
pening—on 
average, 
134-percent 
in-
crease in wages if you are on unem-
ployment insurance. 
There must be a way for us to come 
together and to solve this problem. 
There are Democrats and Republicans 
alike who have talked about perhaps 
lowering that amount from $600. I 
heard one of my Democratic colleagues 
on the floor today—the Senator from 
Oregon—talk about maybe you can tie 
it to the unemployment in the State. 
Others of us, again, and I have talked 
about the return-to-work bonus. You 
could take some of that $600 with you 
and go back to work, which would deal 
with, on a voluntary basis, the need for 
people to go back to work because em-
ployers are looking for folks. 
Right now in Ohio, we have a lot of 
jobs open, a lot of manufacturing jobs, 
as an example. I was at a plant re-
cently—a Ford plant—where they are 
looking for people. They have a 25-per-
cent absenteeism rate right now. They 
attribute a lot of that to the fact that 
people can make more money on unem-
ployment insurance, but they need the 
workers badly. 
There are Honda plants in Ohio—that 
is another one of our manufacturers— 
where the white-collar workers are 
going to work on the assembly lines be-
cause they can’t get enough workers 
coming in. 
I hear it across the board. I have 
heard it from those who are involved 
with developmental disabilities trying 
to get their workforce back. I have 
heard it from people who are involved 
with the treatment for opioids, so the 
alcohol and drug addiction boards are 
trying to get their people to come back 
to work. I have heard it from our small 
businesses that are trying to figure out 
how to reopen and reopen safely but 
have a tough time getting people to 
come back to work. There is a need for 
us to figure this out. 
For the workers themselves, it is 
much better for them to be connected 
with their employer again, isn’t it? 
After all, that is where they are likely 
to get their healthcare. If they have it, 
they are likely to get their retirement 
savings. They are likely to get the 
training there to be able to keep up 
with the times. 
It is good to have people at work. 
The dignity and self-respect you get 
from work is something that is of 
value. We should all want that. All of 
us in this Chamber should focus on this 
issue and say: OK. The $600 was put in 
place during a tough summer. Let’s be 
honest. A lot of people had a really 
tough time, and some people are still 
having a tough time. There should still 
be, in my view, a Federal supplement, 
but it can’t be paying people more not 
to work than to work. That makes no 
sense, as we are starting to open this 
economy and open it safely. We have to 
figure out a way forward here. 
There are some Democrats who have 
worked 
on 
this 
issue. 
Timothy 
Geithner is an example of one who was 
Secretary of Treasury under President 
Obama, who put forward, along with 
other Democrats and Republicans, a 
proposal that said: Let’s lower the 
amount, and let’s tie it to the unem-
ployment. 
This is something that, in talking to 
my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle, including some Democratic col-
leagues who have talked to me pri-
vately, that, you know, they get it; 
this is not working, and we need to fix 
it. Let’s do that. It seems to me there 
is a lot of commonality there, and we 
should be able to figure out a way for-
ward. 
Let me mention some of the other 
places where I see a lot of com-
monality. First, both Republicans and 
Democrats agree that it is absolutely 
essential that as people return to work 
they do so safely. In the legislation we 
talked about earlier, the HEALS pack-
age, which Senator MCCONNELL intro-
duced, there is a proposal that is called 
the Healthy Workplace Tax Credit Act. 
Basically, what it says is, if a business 
is willing to put in place safety meas-
ures like a Plexiglas shield or do test-
ing or have the PPE—the gloves and 
the masks and, in some cases, the 
gowns that are needed to stay safe— 
they should be able to get a tax credit 
for that. It not only encourages more 
employment, but it encourages em-
ployers to open in a safe way. 
I spoke to a bunch of restaurants yes-
terday from Ohio. They called in to 
talk about the legislation. They love 
this because they have a lot of costs as-
sociated with making their places safe 
during the coronavirus pandemic. But 
this legislation, again, is stuck because 
we can’t seem to get to a negotiation. 
That is one where Democrats and Re-
publicans could come together. 
There is another one that I think 
makes a lot of sense. It is called the 
Work Opportunity Tax Credit Expan-
sion. That also is in the HEALS legis-
lation. This has always been a bipar-
tisan issue—the work opportunity tax 
credit. We have said simply that just as 
you can get a tax credit to hire vet-
erans or to hire second-chance individ-
uals who have come out of the prison 
system, you should be able to hire peo-
ple from unemployment insurance who 
have lost their job because of COVID–19 
and get a tax credit. This is something 
that, again, Democrats and Repub-
licans should be able to work on to-
gether. 
Finally, in the HEALS package, we 
also have legislation that has a lot of 
appeal to Republicans and Democrats 
that is an expansion of the employee 
retention tax credit from the bipar-
tisan CARES Act. This is legislation 
that passed 96 to 0 around here. We say, 
let’s make this employee retention tax 
credit work better. We expand the 
amount you can get in terms of tax 
credit, expand the amount of time that 
has to be covered. It makes it a much 
better package for small businesses to 
use to be able to attract employees and 
to retain the employees they have. 
Again, this is nonpartisan, I would say, 
and certainly one that can be bipar-
tisan. 
Historically, these tax provisions 
have had bipartisan support. I worked 
with my friend BEN CARDIN in design-
ing the employee retention credit in 
March, expanding the opportunity tax 
credit, which has always had bipartisan 
support, and the healthy workplace tax 
credit. Senator SINEMA actually has a 
very similar bill. 
Second, there is agreement on both 
sides of the aisle, we have to support 
our schools and our businesses so our 
kids can get back into the classroom 
and our parents can get back to work. 
With regard to schools, there is sup-
posedly a big partisan divide over this 
issue. When I see it, I see schools,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

August 4, 2020 
money being practically identical in 
the HEALS package and the Heroes 
Act that passed the House of Rep-
resentatives. In fact, House Democrats 
provided around $58 billion for K–12. 
The HEALS Act actually increases 
that to $70 billion. There is actually 
more money in the HEALS legislation. 
On the business front, both Demo-
crats and Republicans have seen value 
in the Paycheck Protection Program 
we introduced in the CARES Act, 
which is why both bills seek to expand 
it. Albeit in somewhat different ways, 
but there is greater consensus here 
than one might think. We just need to 
sort out the details. 
My colleague from Louisiana is here 
with me tonight in the Chamber. He 
has talked a lot about the need for us 
to improve the way we provide funding 
to local governments, municipalities, 
and to provide more flexibility. I don’t 
think there is much disagreement 
about that on either side of the aisle. 
There may be a disagreement the num-
bers, the amount of funding, but, 
again, the HEALS package has fund-
ing. The Democrats have more funding. 
But flexibility—that is one where I 
think there is a lot of bipartisan con-
sensus. 
I know it is a popular right now to 
say that we are so far apart we can 
never get together, but as I look at 
this, when you actually look at the in-
dividual pieces of this, I see a lot of 
commonalities. The final one I want to 
mention is one where I would think all 
of us should be together. That is ad-
dressing the underlying health crisis 
we face. 
Both the HEALS package and the He-
roes Act provide increased funding for 
research into vaccines and antiviral 
treatments for this disease. Both acts 
also recognize the importance of in-
creasing funding for testing, which is 
critical in making sure we can safely 
and sustainably reopen. 
There 
are 
more 
points 
of 
com-
monality between the Republican and 
Democratic approaches that I could 
touch on, like providing another $1,200 
in stimulus checks for all Americans 
who make less than $75,000 a year. 
That, I understand, is something that 
both Democrats and Republicans sup-
port. That would be a huge part of this 
new package. 
The House-passed Heroes Act has, 
again, a pricetag that is just too high— 
$3.5 trillion. I think most people would 
acknowledge that. I also know there is 
a big difference between that and the $1 
trillion that was in the proposal from 
Senator MCCONNELL—$1 trillion. That 
used to be a lot of money. 
Again, when you look at the actual 
details of this, when you look at what 
is actually in these two pieces of legis-
lation, there is so much commonality. 
I think it is critical that we get this 
legislation right. We have time to do 
that. In the meantime, as Senator 
MCSALLY has proposed, let’s continue 
the $600 for the next week. 
Let’s be sure that we can build on 
these commonalities we see between 
these two pieces of legislation. Re-
treating into partisan corners at this 
critical time doesn’t benefit any of us. 
It certainly doesn’t benefit the United 
States, and it doesn’t benefit us as an 
institution. It certainly doesn’t benefit 
the people I represent. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. BAR-
RASSO). The Senator from Louisiana. 
f 
AIR AMERICA 
Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I rise 
to speak of a largely unknown aspect 
of the Vietnam war and a too neglected 
aspect. I rise to highlight Air America 
and its role in military conflicts from 
the 1940s through the Cold War. 
Air America, which was previously 
known as the Civil Air Transport, oper-
ated under a shroud of mystery, in-
trigue, and, at times, purposeful deceit 
to allow the organization to continue 
covert operations. Its members lived 
the motto ‘‘Anything, Anywhere, Any-
time, Professionally.’’ 
Now, if you would look at this pic-
ture, you would think that this must 
be an Army helicopter pilot performing 
a rescue on an active battlefield. No, 
that pilot was a civilian. He was a con-
tractor of sorts with the U.S. Govern-
ment and was flying that helicopter to 
rescue that soldier or that marine, not 
an enlisted person. Its members, again, 
lived the motto ‘‘Anything, Anywhere, 
Anytime, 
Professionally,’’ 
including 
rescuing those from battlefields. 
They garnered respect as cargo and 
charter airline pilots during the Secret 
War in Laos in the 1960s and 1970s. As 
the war progressed, the U.S. Govern-
ment increasingly relied on Air Amer-
ica pilots to conduct search-and-rescue 
missions of downed U.S. military pi-
lots—often in heavy combat areas with 
no weapons of their own. The daily 
risks that they took to save others 
earned them the reputation as being 
the most shot at airline. I shouldn’t 
laugh, but there is, I am sure, kind of 
a gallows humor they felt when they 
said that, ‘‘the most shot at airline.’’ 
Here is a depiction of a plaque in 
Richardson, TX, that President Reagan 
dedicated. On it are the names of those 
who died as Air America pilots. 
At the plaque dedication in Dallas, 
President Ronald Reagan said: ‘‘Al-
though free people everywhere owe you 
more than we can hope to repay, our 
greatest debt is to your companions 
who gave their last full measure of de-
votion.’’ 
While President Reagan recognized 
the contributions that these pilots 
made to the United States, Air Amer-
ica 
has 
received 
mixed 
support 
throughout its history. The Depart-
ment of Defense and the CIA, among 
others, have argued that Air America 
pilots are not veterans, saying their 
heroic rescues of American soldiers 
were not part of their contracts or 
within the scope of their mission. 
These sentiments have kept Air 
America pilots from receiving veteran 
status and the benefits that come with 
the status. This needs to change. This 
need to change is based on declassified 
materials that show these pilots are 
deserving of such recognition for their 
exploits. 
Who were these dedicated Americans 
serving in Air America? 
Most crews had military training. 
Many bore the scars of fighting on the 
ground in Korea and Vietnam. They 
are former POWs and Special Forces— 
all tough as nails. They were also crop 
dusters and water bombers who fought 
forest fires. They were smoke jumpers 
and flight mechanics. Thousands of 
personnel were indigenous people, both 
male and female. Air America members 
came from all walks of life to answer 
the call to serve. 
Military aircraft was provided to em-
ployees to conduct combat-related ac-
tivity in areas where the U.S. Armed 
Forces could not go due to treaties. 
They served at considerable risk. Nu-
merous employees died or were seri-
ously injured. However, their sacrifices 
were not given the same recognition as 
military members. 
Lowell Pirkle was killed when an 
RPG hit his helicopter, and it burned 
to the ground. Sadly, it took years for 
his remains to be repatriated and sent 
to Honolulu. When Deborah, Lowell’s 
wife, insisted that he be buried in Ar-
lington Cemetery, she was informed 
that Lowell was ineligible because he 
died not in the military but as part of 
Air America. He would eventually be 
buried in Arlington due to his previous 
military service, though the work in 
both engagements was essentially the 
same. 
Let me just pause for a second. Let’s 
look at this poster. 
From 1962 to 1975, Air America in-
serted and extracted U.S. military per-
sonnel and provided combat support 
across the entire Vietnam field. Air 
America rescued hundreds of Ameri-
cans and stranded Vietnamese, includ-
ing the last out of Saigon in April 1975. 
Who can forget these dramatic photo-
graphs? 
Air America pioneered remote land-
ings during the Vietnam war to resup-
ply U.S. troops and key allies, like the 
Hmong in Laos, and Air America pilots 
were the only known civilian employ-
ees to operate non-FAA-certified mili-
tary aircraft in combat zones. 
Lastly, as I previously mentioned, 
here is the memorial plaque in Rich-
ardson, TX, that honors the 146 Air 
America veterans who were killed. 
These men served ‘‘Anything, Any-
where, 
Anytime, 
Professionally.’’ 
Again, it has been denied that they ac-
tually performed these military duties, 
but, once more, declassified documents 
show that the U.S. Government owes 
Air America and, therefore, its mem-
bers status as veterans. 
In August 1965, Secretary of State 
Dean Rusk wrote: ‘‘Political factors re-
quire that Air America helicopters con-
tinue to assume responsibility for all 
search-and-rescue operations in Laos.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4722 
August 4, 2020 
A year prior, Ambassador to Laos 
Leonard Unger said: ‘‘Search and res-
cue is a crucial factor in maintaining 
the morale of pilots, and there is no 
prospect at this juncture of estab-
lishing effective search-and-rescue pro-
cedures without the use of both civil-
ian (Air America) and U.S. military 
personnel.’’ 
The stories go on, but I will add one 
more. 
CIA Assistant General Counsel James 
Harris wrote to the Civil Service Com-
mission: ‘‘In the case of Air America, it 
would have been virtually impossible 
to preserve the cover story had all the 
corporate employees been advised that 
they were really employees of the 
United States Government.’’ 
It is time for the U.S. Government to 
set the record straight about Air Amer-
ica. Their service is commended by all 
who served with them, especially by 
those servicemembers whose lives were 
saved by Air America. We owe them 
more than a debt of gratitude. I urge 
my colleagues to consider the story of 
these brave pilots and work toward 
providing the recognition they deserve 
as Federal employees, including grant-
ing veteran status and the associated 
benefits. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
(The remarks of Mr. DURBIN
per-
taining to the introduction of S.J. Res. 
75 are printed in today’s RECORD under 
‘‘Statements on Introduced Bills and 
Joint Resolutions.’’) 
Mr. DURBIN. I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The

The

The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask

the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
PROTESTS 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I want 
to start by doing something that has 
become 
a 
little 
controversial. 
It 
shouldn’t be, and the fact that it is re-
flects a sad time in our Nation’s his-
tory. Here it is: 
To our Nation’s police, sheriffs, and 
all other law enforcement officers out 
there—State and Federal—thank you. I 
appreciate you and am grateful for 
your service. 
Why has that become controversial? 
Because all of a sudden, criticizing and 
demonizing our Nation’s law enforce-
ment has become the popular liberal 
thing to do. 
Over the last few days, you have 
probably seen the liberal mainstream 
media making wild claims and accusa-
tions that President Trump has de-
ployed so-called secret police to Port-
land. These allegations got even more 
attention over the last few weeks be-
cause some of my Democratic col-
leagues came down to the floor and 
made the wildest accusations about 
how the Federal officers were the worst 
in the world. 
Some of the words they used were: 
‘‘bold,’’ ‘‘sadistic,’’ ‘‘Gestapos,’’ ‘‘storm 
troopers,’’ ‘‘paramilitary’’—words de-
signed to stir the emotions of everyone 
watching. They were talking about the 
law 
enforcement 
community. 
They 
were talking about sheriffs and police. 
Rather than letting these wild allega-
tions go unchecked, let’s remember 
how we got here. 
For over 60 days, violent demonstra-
tors have laid siege on Portland. That 
is not an exaggeration. They have spe-
cifically and deliberately attacked a 
Federal courthouse, attempting to de-
stroy it. Let’s be clear: These are not 
peaceful protesters. Everyone agrees in 
the First Amendment and the support 
for peaceful demonstrations. We all 
agree on that. That is not what we are 
talking about here. That is not what 
happened when the anarchist groups 
co-opted the peaceful protests with the 
fires, the lasers, the bricks, the Molo-
tov cocktails, the sledgehammers, and 
more. 
See the chart. This chart we have 
here, the one on the right says: 
Day 53. Federal facilities and law enforce-
ment officials targeted and attacked over-
night. One officer injured and 5 arrested. 
The one on the left says: 
Day 56. Last night six DHS law enforce-
ment officers were injured in Portland. To be 
clear, criminals assaulted FEDERAL officers 
on FEDERAL property . . . and the city of 
Portland did nothing. 
The response from local leaders? 
They have caved to the mob and will 
not allow local law enforcement to pro-
tect Federal property. In fact, they 
have demanded Federal law enforce-
ment leave and surrender to the mob. 
Can you imagine? This is in America 
that this happened. 
So that leaves us two options: One, 
completely give in to the mob and let 
them burn down the taxpayer-funded 
courthouse—and we all know that they 
will not stop there—or, two, send addi-
tional Federal resources to Portland. 
We are a nation of law and order. Ad-
ditional Federal resources is the only 
correct answer here. The Department 
of Homeland Security doesn’t have a 
choice. They are legally required to 
protect these facilities. 
Contrary to what has been reported 
in the media, these Federal officers are 
acting in accordance with the law. 
They have the legal authority and re-
sponsibility to protect Federal prop-
erty, as well as detain, question, and 
arrest anyone in accordance with that. 
Specifically, that is found in 40 U.S. 
Code 1315. So they aren’t some sort of 
secret police; they are legal law en-
forcement doing what local law en-
forcement wasn’t being allowed to do 
locally there, so they took up their re-
sponsibilities and performed. 
Last week, Governor Brown finally 
conceded. I guess he just got to the 
point where he was willing to be fearful 
for the people and their injuries and 
the terrorist activity that was going 
on. But he conceded and allowed the 
Portland Police Bureau to clear out 
the downtown parks that were a base 
for the agitators and let the State po-
lice officers defend Federal properties. 
That is the responsible thing to do, 
and it shows the President’s commit-
ment to working with State and local 
law enforcement when additional re-
sources are needed. 
It could be easy to think that this is 
an outlier, but, sadly, the national 
‘‘defund the police’’ movement—it is a 
movement in this country now. Every-
one is talking about it, defund law en-
forcement. The movement is having a 
real impact throughout America. 
The result? Shootings have increased 
in New York by 277 percent this year; 
in Chicago, by 50 percent this year, and 
in May, they saw the most violent 
weekend in modern history; and in 
Minneapolis, the murder rate is ex-
pected to surpass an alltime high. 
In fact, as President Trump men-
tioned recently, the 20-most dangerous 
cities in America are run by Demo-
crats. I have to mention this because 
the Washington Post tried to fact 
check the President’s statement. And 
do you know what? It is a good thing 
that they did. The result? The Post 
showed that, per capita, 19 of the 20 cit-
ies with the most violent crime per 
10,000 residents were controlled by 
Democrats, and the one that wasn’t 
controlled by Democrats was an Inde-
pendent, but that Independent is a 
Democrat. 
I guess they hoped we would only 
read the headline and not see the data 
that shows the impact of the lack of 
leadership. In case you can’t tell 
watching at home, the blue lines on the 
chart that will go up here—what we 
have here is the claim ‘‘that the most 
dangerous cities in America all run by 
Democrats. They aren’t.’’ But then 
they found out that they are. Here they 
are. The blue lines are run by the 
Democrats; the red lines, Independents. 
So that is a problem. 
Honorable, good law enforcement of-
ficers are enduring severe budget cuts 
from spineless politicians who want to 
concede to the far left ‘‘defund the po-
lice’’ movement. They are being over-
stretched and overburdened. 
That doesn’t even get into the inju-
ries law enforcement has endured dur-
ing these violent protests recently. In 
Portland alone, three officers are fac-
ing possible permanent blindness after 
having high-intensity lasers shown in 
their eyes. Other officers have faced in-
juries from being hit with bricks and 
fireworks. They have endured verbal 
assaults, been spit on, and called the 
most offensive names. At least 30 offi-
cers have been victims of a doxing, 
where anarchists share where their 
families live online so they can have 
access to them. In fact, since July 4, 
over 245 Federal law enforcement offi-
cers have been injured in Portland. 
Fortunately, President Trump is tak-
ing action, standing up for our police

and also for law enforcement in our 
communities. Last week, he launched 
Operation Legend, a Federal law en-
forcement initiative that will work 
with State and local officials to ad-
dress the spike in violent crimes that 
we are seeing in too many cities. This 
is the right approach to restore law 
and order. 
The last thing I will leave you with 
on the floor is, 2 weeks ago, in the 
midst of sensationalizing statements, 
the junior Senator from Oregon chal-
lenged me, basically, implying that if 
what was happening in Portland was 
happening in Oklahoma, I would feel 
differently. Well, that isn’t—the dif-
ference isn’t how I would feel. The dif-
ference is between Oklahoma City and 
Oregon, I guess. In Oklahoma, we re-
spect our police and the sheriffs and 
the State troopers. 
This is a good one here. This is in the 
Springlake Division. This is in Okla-
homa. I walk past this every time we 
come and go from the station. What a 
wonderful community we see serving 
here in Oklahoma City. You can read 
statements of people saying how much 
they appreciate our law enforcement 
officers. This is the door that was 
there, and it is covered with hearts on 
the door. That tells the story. 
The sacrifice they make daily is real. 
They put their lives on the line to pro-
tect and serve our communities, but 
they also work long hours in difficult 
conditions. Here is a reminder of that 
sacrifice. 
I will put up two officers here. There 
are two officers whom I am going to 
show you. Last month, two Tulsa po-
lice officers were conducting a routine 
traffic stop, pulling over a car with ex-
pired tags. As any veteran officer will 
tell you, there is no such thing as a 
routine anything in law enforcement. 
This 
is 
no 
exception. 
Officer 
Zarkeshan, a rookie, and Sergeant 
Craig Johnson had no way of knowing 
that the man they had just pulled over 
was armed. The man on the left is 
Craig Johnson. Both officers were shot 
multiple times. Sergeant Johnson, who 
has two young sons, died. Officer 
Zarkeshan, after enduring multiple 
surgeries, is blessed. He is now stable 
and making good progress. 
‘‘Protect and serve’’ isn’t just a 
phrase for the hundreds of thousands of 
law enforcement officers around the 
country; it is a calling, a sacrifice for 
them. Too often, officers have to sac-
rifice their lives for their communities. 
That is why, when liberal politicians 
are tripping over themselves, trying as 
hard as they can to demonize all police 
officers, I want to make it clear that 
some of us are standing up against 
defunding police and in favor of defend-
ing police. 
I will always stand with President 
Trump in defense of our good, honor-
able law enforcement officers. They 
will sacrifice anything for those of us 
here, and to not stand up and defend 
them is to dishonor them. 
In Oregon, politicians are clamoring 
to defend the terrorists who are trying 
to destroy law and order. On the other 
side, our President is trying to defend 
it. God bless America’s law enforce-
ment officers and our President. 
The police and our law enforcement 
aren’t the only things the new cancel 
culture has come for more recently. 
While not a literal mob trying to burn 
down buildings, the online liberal mob 
is still seeking to destroy our Amer-
ican icons by canceling them, sub-
jecting them to public backlash fueled 
by the progressive ideology. 
Just before July Fourth—our na-
tional holiday—they came for the Na-
tional Anthem. The Yahoo music edi-
tor-in-chief wrote that the ‘‘’Star- 
Spangled Banner’ seems to be striking 
a wrong note.’’ The Los Angeles Times 
wrote an op-ed titled, ‘‘It’s time to can-
cel the ‘Star-Spangled Banner.’’’ This 
is America we are talking about. 
Why do they do that? Because in the 
fourth stanza of the song—and I didn’t 
even know until a month ago that it 
had more than one stanza. They knew 
it was more than just one stanza. But 
in the fourth stanza, there is a couplet 
that reads: 
No refuge could save the hireling and slave 
From the terror of flight in the gloom of 
the grave. 
Now, because of that, they want to 
cancel the Star-Spangled Banner. Marc 
Ferris, who literally wrote the book on 
the Star-Spangled Banner, stated that 
Key was likely using the term loosely, 
contrasting the free, patriot Americans 
against the British soldiers subjected 
to the yoke of the monarchy. 
But Yahoo’s article even says if there 
is ‘‘a tradition that hurts any part of 
society,’’ it is time to just throw it 
away. That throwing it away has ex-
tended to statues of our Founders, like 
George Washington and Thomas Jeffer-
son. It also includes Mahatma Gandhi 
and Ulysses S. Grant. 
It even includes historical items 
from popular culture like ‘‘Gone with 
the Wind’’—yes, ‘‘Gone with the Wind.’’ 
They wanted to do away with ‘‘Gone 
with the Wind.’’ The organization that 
has a program where, online, they can 
dial up any movie that they want to 
do, one of them is ‘‘Gone with the 
Wind,’’ and they want to do it because 
of—they say—the culture. That hap-
pens 
to 
be 
the 
one 
that 
Hattie 
McDaniel was the first Black American 
to win an Oscar for. 
This is, again, what is going on right 
now. Like so many American families, 
I watch with shock and dismay as to 
how many are setting aside critical 
thinking in favor of an emotional mob 
that moves closer and closer to a total 
Cultural Revolution takeover. 
Should we have expected anything 
less from the Democratic Party as they 
continue to run toward socialism and 
proudly embrace communist beliefs? 
Remember, we have seen this before. 
Chairman Mao knew that, to fully seize 
control and build a socialist country, 
he needed to destroy our ‘‘four olds″: 
old ideas, old culture, old customs, and 
old habits. The Communists in China 
needed the Orwellian control of ‘‘His-
tory has stopped’’ in 1966, and the Com-
munists here in America need it today. 
How else can they erase our ideas, 
culture, and customs in order to im-
pose their radical policies on all of us? 
How much longer do we need to wait 
for their cries of ‘‘Abolish rent’’ to be-
come ‘‘Jail the bourgeois landlord’’? 
We already see professors accused of 
wrong thinking for having the audacity 
to teach or advocate for anything un-
approved by the progressive mob. How 
long until they are denounced as class 
traitors? 
Does our Nation have flaws? Of 
course. But what is unique and is per-
haps the most beautiful part of our Na-
tion is that we have the ability to see 
those flaws, to change them, and to 
grow. And we do it under the promise 
of liberty and justice for all. 
We did that after the Civil War. We 
saw it again after World War II. We saw 
that growth in the civil rights move-
ment. 
The reality of this leftwing ‘‘cancel 
culture’’ mob is that there is no goal of 
debate. The goal is to shame, humili-
ate, 
and 
ridicule 
into 
conformity 
through a vicious attack reminiscent 
of the Chinese Communist Party strug-
gle session. Liberty is under siege. 
Just remember what happened in the 
opinion pages of the New York Times 
for merely publishing an opinion that 
was held by the majority of Americans 
but rejected by the progressive mob. 
Senator COTTON put forward a well-re-
searched 
op-ed—requested 
by 
the 
Times—that advocated the President, 
only as a last resort, should use the In-
surrection Act to put down the ter-
rorist activity we saw in too many cit-
ies over the past few months. 
Again, a national poll held that 58 
percent of registered voters agreed 
with Senator COTTON, but some report-
ers at the New York Times and the pro-
gressive mob didn’t. They raised such a 
protest that the head of the editorial 
page issued an apology, claiming that 
it wasn’t to the standards of the Times, 
that it was too extreme. And that 
wasn’t enough for the mob. He was 
fired. 
Before the ‘‘cancel culture’’ mob goes 
further still to embrace their Presi-
dential 
candidate—who 
has 
gone 
through enough twists and turns to 
make sure that he, too, conforms to 
the progressive demands—we should all 
remember our Nation was founded on 
liberty, and it will only endure with 
true liberty. That means being willing 
to live together in the midst of all 
kinds of diversity, especially diversity 
of thought. 
So, as we began, we can’t forget what 
this is all about: The terrorists ran, un-
checked, in Portland for 60 days. No 
one raced to stop them. Federal offi-
cials had to step in because the State 
and local governments wouldn’t allow 
their law enforcement to police the 
riots. 
Scenes like we saw in Portland will 
not happen in Oklahoma, but they

could happen in other cities where law-
lessness is pervasive. Thankfully, we

TRIBUTE TO EUGENE F. COYLE 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I 
wish to recognize and pay tribute to 
Mr. Eugene F. Coyle, a patriot who 
served in the U.S. Army during the Ko-
rean war. 
At the age of 23, Sergeant Eugene F. 
Coyle enlisted in the U.S. Army, just 3 
months after the war started in Korea. 
As a rifleman and machinegunner as-
signed to the 24st Infantry Division, 
21st Regiment, 2nd Battalion, F Com-
pany, Eugene was quickly put into the 
fight, experiencing a number of combat 
engagements with the enemy. 
One such engagement occurred in 
April 1951 near the Hwacheon Res-
ervoir, South Korea, where Eugene ex-
hibited composure under fire. As squad 
leader, Eugene led an advance against 
the enemy until his position was hit by 
mortar fire. Despite sustaining injuries 
from the shelling, he continued to pro-
vide covering fire for his unit. 
During another combat engagement 
in early July 1951, in the vicinity of 
Sabanggo-ri, North Korea, an enemy 
mortar round threw Eugene from his 
fighting position. Eugene, though in-
jured by shrapnel, would not leave the 
fight. He regained his footing and ran 
to aid a severely injured soldier, get-
ting him to cover. Eugene was later 
sent to the hospital ship USS Repose 
for his own injuries. 
Eugene, deserving of commendation 
for his courage under fire, as well as for 
his wounds resulting from close en-
gagement with enemy forces, would un-
fortunately wait decades before the Na-
tion properly recognized him for his 
service and sacrifice, even as he carried 
a piece of shrapnel embedded within 
his body for over 60 years. 
On November 15, 2017, Eugene F. 
Coyle was awarded the Purple Heart in 
addition to the United Nations Service 
Medal, the National Defense Service 
Medal, the Korean War Service Medal, 
and the Combat Infantry Badge. Like 
many veterans of his generation have 
experienced, poor or lost records have 
made it difficult to meet stringent ad-
ministrative requirements for certain 
military awards. This challenge does 
not diminish their courage, nor our 
gratitude, for their actions in defense 
of freedom. 
The gallantry of Eugene F. Coyle re-
minds us what we owe heroes like him 
for the sacrifices, often unrecognized 
and unrequited, that they have made. I 
am honored to pay tribute to Eugene 
F. Coyle and thank him for his exem-
plary service to our county. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO TIMOTHY MCCARTHY 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, Timothy 
McCarthy has had an amazing career in 
law enforcement where he was at the 
right place when needed. Whether it 
was protecting Presidents or his home-
town of Orland Park, Tim has been 
where people needed him most. After 48 
years, he will be retiring, and today, I 
lend my voice to the many who honor 
him. 
Tim dared to try out for the Univer-
sity of Illinois’ football team as a 
walk-on in 1967, even though he had not 
played the sport at Leo High School in 
Chicago. However, he was so impressive 
that he was given a full scholarship the 
next year, playing strong safety for the 
Fighting Illini. Injuries cut his football 
career short, but he found himself on 
another career path, the Secret Serv-
ice. 
With a father who served in the Chi-
cago Police Department as a sergeant, 
law enforcement was a natural draw 
for him. He started out as an investi-
gator in the Chicago field office for the 
Secret Service in 1972. Tim moved to 
the Presidential protection division for 
President Jimmy Carter. 
On March 30, 1981, Tim was pro-
tecting President Ronald Reagan in 
Washington. A coin toss with a fellow 
agent put him into duty that fateful 
day. He remembers wearing a brandnew 
blue-gray suit when John Hinckley, 
Jr., stepped out from a crowd with a 
handgun and attempted to kill the 
President. 
In 1.7 seconds, John Hinckley, Jr., 
fired six bullets. The first bullet hit 
Press Secretary James Brady. The sec-
ond hit Washington, DC, police officer 
Tom Delahanty. The third was set to 
hit President Reagan, but Tim, with 
that extraordinary courage, stepped in 
front of the President and took the bul-
let in the chest. Another bullet rico-
cheted, hitting the President under the 
arm. Hinckley might have killed Presi-
dent Reagan, but that day, we were 
lucky to have Tim McCarthy doing his 
duty to protect the Gipper. 
Tim spent 2 weeks in the hospital 
and was back on the job that June. He 
would never be able to do the 5 to 7- 
mile runs he used to do, but he contin-
ued in the Secret Service. Tim received 
the National Collegiate Athletic Asso-
ciation Award of Valor in 1982 for his 
heroic deed. He remained in touch with 
President Reagan and his wife, Nancy, 
for the rest of their lives. Tim also 
served in the Presidential protection 
division for President George H.W. 
Bush before returning to Chicago to 
run the Secret Service office there. 
In 1994, Tim accepted the position of 
the Orland Park police chief in Illinois. 
Often, police chiefs serve 3 to 5 years, 
but Tim stayed on for 26 years. He led 
the development of new policing strat-
egies, including bike patrol officers, 
cookouts with police, and community 
meetings with beat officers. Under his 
leadership, 
the 
police 
department 
launched villagewide initiatives, ad-
dressing mental illness through a crisis 
intervention team that focuses on re-
sponses to mental health-related inci-
dents. 
Tim was a hands-on leader, whether 
it was back up for a search warrant or 
reporting a crime scene at early hours 
of the morning or packing sandbags

during a flood. In 2016, he received the 
very first Chief of Police of the Year 
Award from the Illinois Association of 
Chiefs of Police. 
This month, Tim is retiring to be 
with the center of his life his wife, 
Carol, his three kids, and seven grand-
children. He has more than earned it. 
Tim McCarthy did more than make 
history in saving the life of President 
Reagan. He has dedicated his life to 
making America a safer nation. We 
were fortunate to be blessed with his 
courage and his amazing record of pub-
lic service. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise today to speak about coronavirus, 
now clearly the worst pandemic in a 
century. 
I will also speak briefly about the 
need for a national response plan that 
is guided by science and public health, 
not politics. 
The first case of COVID–19 was re-
ported in the United States on January 
20. In the intervening 6 months, we 
have seen cases climb, then fall, and 
now surge once again. 
More than 4 million Americans have 
been infected with coronavirus. So far, 
more than 155,000 have died. 
Every day for the last 4 months, I 
have received an update from my staff 
on coronavirus numbers. 
I have watched, day by day, the num-
ber of positive cases climb. In Cali-
fornia right now, 30 of our 58 counties 
have had more than 1,000 positive 
cases. 
The numbers just go up and up and 
up. It becomes impossible to look at 
the charts and graphs and not come to 
the conclusion that we have to do 
more—and maybe significantly more. 
Simply put, this is the worst pan-
demic in my lifetime. You have to go 
back more than 100 years to the Span-
ish flu epidemic to find something 
comparable. 
But the unprecedented scale of this 
crisis is no excuse for our failure to re-
spond more forcefully and in a nation-
ally coordinated manner. 
Once we realized the scale of the out-
break in the spring, both by the in-
creased cases at home, as well as moni-
toring stricken countries like Italy, it 
became clear that we needed strong 
leadership from the top. 
We didn’t get that. 
Instead, the White House and Presi-
dent Trump blamed states for the lack 
of testing equipment, the hoarding of 
sanitizing supplies and the absence of 
protective gear. 
In March, President Trump said, ‘‘I 
don’t take responsibility at all.’’ 
That is a direct quote from the Presi-
dent of the United States, in the midst 
of a global pandemic with body counts 
rising around the country. We must do 
better. 
More recently, during the renewed 
surge in cases, we have seen a repeat of 
those problems. We know we need more 
testing supplies and protective equip-
ment, but rather than implement the 
Defense Production Act and stock up 
on supplies, we saw little action from 
the White House. 
I have been thinking back to the 
early days of the pandemic. In March, 
San Francisco’s Bay Area imposed the 
first significant stay-at-home order in 
the country. California soon followed. 
It was criticized at the time as an 
overreaction, but it succeeded in slow-
ing the rate of spread, and the death 
toll remained lower than many other 
large States. Soon, much of the coun-
try had similar orders in place. 
In April and early May, there was a 
sense of shared sacrifice. People stayed 
at home, schools closed, many lost 
their jobs. Our way of life shifted in the 
most abrupt way since at least 9/11, if 
not World War 11. 
But the understanding was that we 
made these sacrifices because they 
would help control the virus. We would 
‘‘bend the curve,’’ we would produce 
sufficient 
protective 
gear, 
and 
we 
would make it safe for people to return 
to their lives. 
The idea was that, by the end of sum-
mer, life would return—if not back to 
normal, at least back to some version 
of it. 
It is now almost August. The number 
of new cases climbs each day. K–12 
schools have announced they will be 
closed in the fall. Many colleges are 
following suit. Job losses continue, 
with more than 30 million still receiv-
ing unemployment benefits. 
Simply put, America failed the test 
of reopening. 
If we had responded like other coun-
tries, 
with 
comprehensive 
national 
policies for mask use, avoiding crowds 
and increasing testing capacity, we 
could have been returning to normal 
life right now. 
Instead, many cities and States are 
rolling back their reopening plans and 
may have to reinstitute stay-at-home 
orders to get the Nation back to where 
we were before Memorial Day. 
President Trump last week said the 
administration is ‘‘in the process of de-
veloping 
a 
strategy’’ 
to 
fight 
coronavirus. 
At some point, we will want to know 
why it took 7 months for him to ac-
knowledge a national plan was nec-
essary. Right now, however, we need to 
focus on what that plan will entail. 
Just as importantly, we need to focus 
on who should have input into the te-
nets of such a plan—in a word, ‘‘ex-
perts.’’ 
This is a challenge that requires the 
combined minds of our best and bright-
est, particularly public health and in-
fectious disease experts. This is not an 
arena for politics, period. 
So what do those public health ex-
perts propose? After reading material 
and listening to a range of opinions, 
there are five areas that appear to have 
broad consensus: 
First, we need to ensure that masks 
are used everywhere. 
Early on, we knew simple acts like 
talking and even breathing caused air-
borne transmission of the virus, espe-
cially in confined areas like office 
buildings. 
We 
also 
knew 
individuals 
who 
weren’t 
showing 
symptoms 
could 
spread the virus to others because 
symptoms don’t appear for 5 to 7 days. 
And 
research 
continues 
to 
show 
masks are one of the best tools to slow 
the spread of the virus. Scientific mod-
eling is clear: Masks prevent the spread 
of the virus. 
Yet even with this knowledge, we 
still continue to see a patchwork of 
policies around the country. 
A national mask mandate would dra-
matically reduce the spread of the 
virus, especially by those who don’t yet 
show symptoms. 
On July 14, the CDC called on all 
Americans to wear masks. CDC Direc-
tor Robert Redfield said if all Ameri-
cans wore masks, the current surge in 
cases could be brought under control 
within 2 months. 
Masks work. We need a national 
mask mandate. 
The second step is a national pro-
gram for testing. 
Months into this pandemic, we con-
tinue to hear stories of people not able 
to receive a test. In some cases, my of-
fice has heard from people with fevers 
and coughing but are still told to stay 
home and not get tested. 
Simply put, anyone who wants to be 
tested should be, and the results should 
be returned within 24 hours, not a week 
later. 
Studies have found that if we only 
test individuals who show symptoms, it 
is too late to stop further trans-
mission. 
That means States and cities need 
sufficient supplies to dramatically in-
crease testing. At this time, that is not 
happening. 
A national testing strategy would 
help coordinate action and prevent 
States from having to compete against 
each other. 
The third step, related to increased 
testing, is ensuring we have enough 
testing supplies and safety equipment 
for frontline workers. 
The President could quickly imple-
ment the Defense Production Act. This 
law would allow the Federal Govern-
ment to address supply chain issues 
and increase production and distribu-
tion of testing supplies, medical equip-
ment and personal protective equip-
ment. 
This should have been done months 
ago, but so far, the President has only 
selectively used this tool. He should 
broaden its use immediately. 
It is unconscionable that 6 months 
after this virus appeared on our shores, 
essential workers around the country 
still lack personal protective equip-
ment, not only doctors and nurses but 
grocery clerks, agricultural workers, 
public transportation operators, educa-
tor; and many others. 
These individuals are putting them-
selves at risk to provide necessary

services to the public, and they should 
have access to masks and other equip-
ment to keep themselves safe. 
The fourth step is expanding contact 
tracing, another area where we see a 
patchwork of policies across the coun-
try rather than a cohesive national ef-
fort. 
To work, contact tracing must occur 
immediately after an individual is 
found to be infected. A team deter-
mines everyone with whom an infected 
individual had recent close contact and 
encourages them to get tested, self-iso-
late, and monitor their health. 
Right now, on average, everyone who 
gets COVID passes it to more than one 
other person. In other words, the 
spread is increasing, often by those 
who don’t know they have been ex-
posed. Contact tracing will help solve 
that. 
The logistics, however, often aren’t 
feasible for local governments. That is 
why a Federal contact tracing pro-
gram, possibly using Peace Corps and 
AmeriCorps volunteers as has been sug-
gested, is so important. 
Finally, the fifth area is the need for 
a plan to manufacture and distribute a 
vaccine once it is developed. 
A key component is determining pri-
orities for vaccine distribution. Should 
it go first to essential workers on the 
frontlines? Or should it go to people 
most likely to get the virus, the vul-
nerable populations, and those in hard- 
hit areas? These aren’t easy questions, 
and we should work on answers now. 
We also need to handle the logistics 
involved to ensure rapid distribution of 
the vaccine nationwide. 
These are obvious challenges, but 
they are also complex, and we need a 
plan in place now, ahead of vaccine de-
velopment, rather than waiting until a 
vaccine is developed. 
In addition to those five health-re-
lated planks, I also believe we need a 
coordinated plan to help the small 
businesses and workers suffering dur-
ing this time. 
One example is the Paycheck Protec-
tion Program that helped many small 
businesses. The program provides for-
givable loans if businesses use funds on 
employee salaries and other necessities 
to remain afloat, which will allow 
them to quickly reopen when it is safe. 
Another example is the additional 
$600 in unemployment benefits in the 
CARES Act. This assistance allows 
millions of families to pay rent, cover 
bills, buy food, and contribute to the 
economic 
recovery. 
Unfortunately, 
that vital aid has lapsed. 
Since mid-March, more than 60 mil-
lion Americans have filed for unem-
ployment benefits. Today, more than 30 
million people continue to depend on 
these benefits. 
We can’t cut these lifelines until jobs 
are available for those out of work. If 
the economy remains shuttered and we 
do nothing to help families and busi-
nesses, we are telling millions of Amer-
icans that we don’t care they are hurt-
ing. 
Moreover, we are hurting our own 
economic recovery by taking aid from 
those who most need it, the very people 
who are most likely to spend it to sup-
port the economy. 
The Federal Government exists for a 
reason, and that is to help Americans 
do things they can’t do for themselves. 
The same goes for States, which are re-
sponsible and powerful but can’t do it 
on their own. 
A global pandemic calls for a robust 
Federal response, which must entail a 
national response plan. And that plan 
has to be based on science and on data, 
not politics. 
Thank you.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING 
MAAG 
PRESCRIP-
TION AND MEDICAL SUPPLY 
∑ Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, as a mem-
ber and former chairman of the Senate 
Committee on Small Business and En-
trepreneurship, each month, I recog-
nize and celebrate the American entre-
preneurial spirit by highlighting the 
success of a small business in my home 
State of Idaho. Today I am pleased to 
honor Maag Prescription and Medical 
Supply in Pocatello as the Idaho Small 
Business of the Month for August 2020 
and congratulate them on 70 years of 
business. 
Maag Prescription and Medical Sup-
ply is an independent, locally owned 
pharmacy which has been operated by 
the Maag family since 1950. Established 
by Irvin and Genevieve Maag, the cou-
ple ran all aspects of the business and 
quickly developed a reputation for pro-
viding exemplary service while meet-
ing the specific needs of their cus-
tomers. As the business flourished and 
ownership transitioned to their son and 
daughter-in-law, Greg and Kathy Maag, 
a fire ravaged the facility in 1977. De-
spite this obstacle, the Maags per-
severed and built a new storefront, ex-
panding it three times to accommodate 
the business’s growth. Maag Prescrip-
tion and Medical Supply’s resiliency 
and service to the community has not 
gone unnoticed. For the past 2 years 
the business received the Idaho State 
Journal’s 
annual 
Reader’s 
Choice 
Award. 
Today, Maag Prescription and Med-
ical Supply plays an important role 
serving the community and providing 
more than 20 jobs to Southeast Idaho 
in the midst of the COVID–19 pan-
demic. The Maags have made it a pri-
ority to support their customers while 
maintaining customer and employee 
safety. Their business stands as a true 
testament to American industrious-
ness, exemplifying one of our Nation’s 
most treasured values. Now, in one of 
the 
most 
economically 
uncertain 
times, their story reminds us of the im-
portance of commitment to our com-
munities and resilience in the face of 
adversity. 
Congratulations to Greg and Kathy 
Maag, and all of the employees of Maag 
Prescription and Medical Supply on 
being selected as the Idaho Small Busi-
ness of the Month for August 2020. You 
make our great State proud, and I look 
forward to your continued growth and 
success.∑

By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself 
and Mr. DAINES): 
S. 4431. A bill to increase wildfire pre-
paredness and response throughout the 
United States, and for other purposes; 
to the Committee on Energy and Nat-
ural Resources. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President. I 
rise to speak in support of the bipar-
tisan Emergency Wildfire and Public 
Safety Act of 2020, a bill that Senator 
DAINES and I are introducing today to 
protect our constituents from the in-
creasing 
threat 
of 
catastrophic 
wildfires. 
As a result of climate change, Cali-
fornia and other Western States are ex-
periencing a growing crisis. Over my 27 
years in the Senate, I have witnessed 
dozens of massive wildfires. But the 
level of destruction we have seen in re-
cent years and the transformation of 
wildfire from a seasonal phenomenon 
into a year-round threat require bold, 
new action. Our bill would do just that 
by giving Federal, State, and local gov-
ernments new tools to better manage 
wildfires and protect communities. 
While California has always had dan-
gerous wildfires, the particularly dev-
astating fires in 2017 and 2018 were a 
wake-up call and a harsh example of 
the consequences of inaction on cli-
mate change. The latest National Cli-
mate Assessment found that, over the 
past three decades, the number of acres 
burned in the Western United States is 
double what would have burned if the 
climate weren’t changing. Nowhere is 
this being felt more than in California. 
The 2018 Camp Fire killed 86 people 
in town of Paradise and destroyed 
15,000 homes. That fire spread as fast as 
80 acres a minute according to some es-
timates. After the 2017 Tubbs Fire, I 
visited the Coffey Park subdivision of 
Santa Rosa, which was destroyed when 
wildfire 
swept 
through 
Napa 
and 
Sonoma. The devastation was unlike 
anything I have ever seen. 
According to California Department 
of Forestry and Fire Protection statis-
tics, 10 of the 20 most destructive 
wildfires in California state history 
have occurred in just the last 5 years 
and 2018 was the most destructive wild-
fire season in recorded California his-
tory: nearly 2 million acres burned in 
our State, displacing hundreds of thou-
sands and leading to billions of dollars 
of damage. 
These problems will only grow worse 
as temperatures continue to rise as a 
result of climate change. But we can’t 
simply wait for the world to roll back 
emissions to address our wildfire prob-
lem. Preparing for these challenges 
will require an all-of-the-above ap-
proach utilizing the latest science, 
even if some solutions aren’t politi-
cally popular. 
There are more than 150 million dead 
trees in California’s forests, the result 
of both the historic drought and bark 
beetle populations that are thriving as 
temperatures warm. A single spark in 
the middle of those dead trees can lead 
to an inferno. And while 60 percent of 
the forestland in California is owned by 
the Federal Government, fires don’t 
stop at the borders between federal, 
state, and private land, so any action 
must be coordinated. 
I have joined California leaders and 
environmentalists 
in 
opposing 
the 
wholesale clearing of forests. There is a 
growing consensus around what appro-
priate forest management actions con-
sist of, and I am encouraged by cooper-
ative efforts such as the Tahoe-Central 
Sierra Initiative. 
We can and should increase the use of 
firebreaks to stop massive wildfires 
from spreading into communities, and 
we can identify landscapes that are 
overgrown and restore resilience to our 
forests. But we must do it in a smart 
and sustainable way. 
We should also continue to expand 
commercial markets for timber and 
wood products. Biomass energy genera-
tion would not only help remove over-
growth from the forests but would also 
provide energy for California homes 
and businesses. 
We should increase our use of ad-
vanced detection systems to identify 
outbreaks sooner, and invest in safer 
power transmission lines and other 
methods 
to 
harden 
infrastructure. 
While California has requirements for 
defensible space around at-risk homes, 
incentives 
should 
be 
provided 
for 
homeowners to use fire-safe building 
materials. The Federal Government 
should also increase support for out-
reach efforts, so that risks and mitiga-
tion strategies are communicated to 
vulnerable individuals and commu-
nities. 
This is why I am introducing The 
Emergency Wildfire and Public Safety 
Act of 2020. Our bill would protect com-
munities by reducing wildfire risk in 
Federal forests, getting the private sec-
tor more involved in addressing wild-
fire risk, improving best practices for 
addressing wildfire, and creating more 
resilient 
communities 
and 
energy 
grids. 
The bill would authorize the Forest 
Service to undertake three priority 
wildfire mitigation projects that would 
be limited to 75,000 acres in size, would 
allow for expedited environmental re-
views regarding the installation of fuel 
breaks near existing roads, trails, 
transmission lines and pipelines, and 
would include a technical fix to ensure 
that the Forest Service consults with 
the Fish and Wildlife Service when new 
public 
peer-reviewed 
research 
dem-
onstrates potential harm to threatened 
or endangered species. The bill would 
also codify an existing administrative 
practice that allows the Forest Service 
to expedite hazardous fuel removal 
projects in emergency situations where 
it is immediately necessary to protect 
life, property, or natural and cultural 
resources. 
The 
bill 
also 
makes 
important 
changes to stimulate the private mar-
ket for low-value timber that poses a 
wildfire danger. The bill would estab-
lish a new $100 million biomass infra-
structure program to provide grant 
funding to build biomass facilities near 
forests that are at risk of wildfire and 
to offset the cost of transporting dead 
and dying trees out of high-hazard fire 
zones. The bill would also lift the cur-
rent export ban on unprocessed timber 
from federal lands in the west for trees 
that are dead, dying, or if there is no 
demand in the United States. These 
measures are necessary to ensure that 
we can mitigate wildfire in a commer-
cially viable way, and not just through 
continued government funding. 
In terms of utilizing the latest 
science and techniques, the bill would 
also expedite permitting for the instal-
lation of wildfire detection equipment 
such as sensors, cameras, and other rel-
evant equipment and expand the use of 
satellite data to assist wildfire re-
sponse. The bill would also establish a 
new prescribed fire center to coordi-
nate research and training of foresters 
and forest managers in the latest 
methods and innovations in prescribed 
fire practices to reduce the likelihood 
of catastrophic fires and improve the 
health of forests. 
Given the generational shortage of 
workers in the forest management 
field, the bill would authorize a new 
workforce development program to as-
sist in developing a career training 
pipeline for forestry workers. 
Lastly, the bill would creating more 
resilient communities and energy grids 
by expanding the Energy Department’s 
weatherization program to allow for 
the retrofit of homes to make them 
more resilient to wildfire through the 
use of fire-resistant building materials 
and other methods, and by establishing 
a new $100 million grant program to 
help critical facilities like hospitals 
and police stations become more en-
ergy efficient and better adapted to 
function during power shutoffs. The 
new program would also provide fund-
ing for the expanded use of distributed 
energy systems, including microgrids. 
Finally, the bill would allow FEMA 
hazard mitigation funding to be used 
for the installation of fire-resistant 
wires and infrastructure as well as for 
the undergrounding of wires. 
It is important to be realistic about 
the threat we face. There have always

been wildfires in the West, and there 
always will be. But we must face the 
reality that climate change and rising 
temperatures will mean more risk of 
wildfires. We can and should prepare 
for this future beginning today. That is 
why we have introduced this new bill, 
and I urge my colleagues to take it up 
and pass it as soon as possible. 
By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Ms. 
WARREN, 
Mr. 
SANDERS, 
Mr. 
MERKLEY, 
Ms. 
HIRONO, 
Mr. 
MARKEY, Mr. VAN HOLLEN, and 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL): 
S.J. Res. 75. A joint resolution pro-
posing an amendment to the Constitu-
tion of the United States relative to 
the fundamental right to vote; to the 
Committee on the Judiciary. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in the 
days since we lost our colleague Con-
gressman JOHN LEWIS, many of us have 
come to the floor to talk about his ex-
traordinary courage and tenacity. 
At the age of 25—25—he joined 600 
civil rights activists to march across 
the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, 
AL, in pursuit of the right to vote. We 
have talked about how that day be-
came known as Bloody Sunday, after 
John and the other courageous march-
ers were met with brutal beatings from 
Alabama State troopers, and how, in 
the days that followed, President Lyn-
don B. Johnson called on Congress to 
pass the Voting Rights Act. 
It was 55 years ago this week that 
President Johnson sat at a desk in the 
President’s Room right off this Cham-
ber, a room that we walk by many 
times each week, and signed the Voting 
Rights Act into law. He noted at the 
signing ceremony: 
[L]ast March, with the outrage of Selma 
still fresh, I came down to this Capitol one 
evening and asked Congress and the people 
for swift and for sweeping action to guar-
antee to every man and woman the right to 
vote. In less than 48 hours, I sent the Voting 
Rights Act of 1965 to Congress. In little more 
than 4 months the Congress, with over-
whelming majorities, enacted one of the 
most monumental laws in the history of 
American freedom. 
Those were the words of Lyndon 
Johnson. He signed the Voting Rights 
Act in 1965. 
Well, 
we 
have 
made 
significant 
progress since that day, thanks to 
great 
men 
like 
John 
Lewis, 
who 
marched to enact the Voting Rights 
Act, and the advocates and litigators 
who battled for decades to enforce it. 
But there is a grim reality. Insidious 
voter suppression efforts still continue 
in America today. These efforts may 
not seem as obvious as the old-school 
poll taxes and literacy tests. But make 
no mistake. They are aimed at denying 
the fundamental right to vote, and all 
too often they are successful. 
When I was chairman of the Judici-
ary Subcommittee on the Constitution, 
Civil Rights, and Human Rights, I de-
cided to travel to the States of Florida 
and Ohio for public hearings to speak 
to officials and experts on the ground 
and to determine why those States, 
through their legislatures, were pass-
ing laws—what I considered burden-
some laws, such as reducing opportuni-
ties for early voting. Why were they 
making it harder to vote in Ohio and 
Florida? 
In both States I asked witnesses, 
under oath, what evidence of wide-
spread voter fraud prompted these laws 
that made it more difficult for people 
to vote and limited the time when they 
could vote. The answer was simple. 
Under oath, what was the evidence of 
fraud? There was no evidence of fraud. 
It turned out that there were a hand-
ful of election fraud cases here and 
there, rarely prosecuted, and that is it. 
In contrast to the mere specter of 
widespread voter fraud, we learned that 
these voter suppression laws really had 
consequences. We heard over and over 
that restrictive voting laws have a dis-
proportionate impact on whom? Low 
income voters, Black voters, Brown 
voters, young voters, elderly, vulner-
able voting populations. 
When you make it harder to vote, it 
is tougher for these people to show up 
and vote. Someone knew that. 
After the hearings, we learned more 
about the real reason behind those 
laws. According to news reports, Re-
publican consultants and former offi-
cials admitted after the 2012 election 
that the Florida law discussed at my 
hearing was literally designed to sup-
press the vote, particularly among 
those leaning toward the Democratic 
column. 
A year later, the Supreme Court an-
nounced its decision in Shelby County 
v. Holder. In a 5-to-4 vote, the divided 
Court struck down the provisions of 
the Voting Rights Act that required 
certain jurisdictions to preclear any 
changes in their voting laws with the 
Department of Justice. 
The decision effectively gutted the 
Voting Rights Act of 1965, and in the 
aftermath, several State legislatures 
pushed through discriminatory restric-
tions on voting that previously would 
have required approval by the Justice 
Department ahead of time. 
As an example, in North Carolina the 
legislature enacted a massive voter 
suppression bill, including a strict 
photo ID requirement, early voting 
cutbacks, and the elimination of same- 
day registration, out-of-precinct vot-
ing, and preregistration for teenagers 
who were about to turn 18 before an 
election. 
What did a three-judge Federal panel 
have to say about this North Carolina 
law? They said ‘‘it targeted African 
Americans with almost surgical preci-
sion’’ and ‘‘enacted the law with dis-
criminatory intent.’’ 
Those are unequivocal words. Despite 
all the press releases to the contrary, 
the Court knew exactly what was going 
on in North Carolina. They were trying 
to stop African-American voters in 
that State from being counted. 
Unfortunately, litigation targeting 
these voter suppression efforts has 
faced an increasingly uphill battle, as 
President Trump has packed the Fed-
eral courts with partisan, rightwing 
judges, including several with appall-
ing records on voting rights. 
And though the Supreme Court con-
tinues to state that the right to vote is 
both ‘‘fundamental’’ and ‘‘preservative 
of 
other 
basic 
civil 
and 
political 
rights,’’ the Court has also continued 
to permit broad assaults on America’s 
access to the ballot box. 
Let me give you an example. In 
April, the Court forced thousands of 
Wisconsin primary voters in April of 
this year to choose between their 
health and exercising their right to 
vote in the middle of a COVID–19 pan-
demic. The Court refused to extend the 
deadline for returning absentee ballots, 
despite the public health national 
emergency we face. 
A State official in Wisconsin recently 
said that at least 71 people were in-
fected with COVID–19 after voting in 
person or working at the polls during 
that primary election. 
In June, the Supreme Court turned 
down a request to reinstate a Texas 
district 
court 
judge’s 
order 
which 
would have ensured that all voters in 
the State could ask to vote by mail, in 
light of the pandemic. 
And just last month, the same Court 
refused to lift a stay in Florida that 
will prevent hundreds of thousands of 
otherwise eligible Floridians from vot-
ing in this month’s primary election, 
simply because they can’t pay the fines 
and fees imposed on them long ago as 
part of a criminal sentence. 
What did Justice Sotomayor say in 
her dissent about this Florida case? 
‘‘This court’s inaction continues a 
trend of condoning disfranchisement.’’ 
Well, it is time for this to end. I am 
introducing today a joint resolution. I 
don’t do this lightly. 
In the time that I have served in Con-
gress, I believe that this is only the 
second time that I have proposed an 
amendment to this Constitution. 
I believe, at least personally, that I 
am humbled by this document. I know 
it was far from perfect when written. 
We have learned that over the years 
with all the amendments and the his-
tory that has followed. But I have 
never thought myself worthy to add 
words to that document. One other 
time, on abolishing the electoral col-
lege, I had a bipartisan measure that I 
offered. But this is only the second 
time I have done it. 
This joint resolution would create 
and enshrine an explicit, individual 
right to vote in the U.S. Constitution, 
and protect all Americans who seek to 
exercise this fundamental right. 
Specifically, the amendment would 
provide an affirmative right to vote for 
every American citizen of legal voting 
age at any public election held in the 
jurisdiction in which they reside. 
It would also require that any efforts 
to limit the fundamental right to vote 
would be subject to the strictest level 
of review in the courts. 
Additionally, it would ensure that 
States could no longer rely on section

2 of the 14th Amendment to prevent 
Americans from voting due to an ear-
lier criminal conviction. 
Finally, the amendment would pro-
vide that Congress has the irrefutable 
authority to protect the right to vote 
through legislation. 
If ratified, this constitutional amend-
ment would protect against nefarious 
election administration changes that 
lead to long lines and people beating on 
doors, trying to get in to vote. These 
long lines have reduced voter turnout 
on election day. How in the world can 
we be a stronger nation if fewer people 
participate in the most important part 
of democracy? 
It would protect against photo iden-
tification requirements that dispropor-
tionately harm low-income voters and 
African Americans and Hispanics. 
Black lives matter. Brown lives mat-
ter. American lives matter. And when 
it comes to voting, this insidious effort 
to undermine the opportunity for these 
people to vote has to be called out for 
what it is. 
It would also provide a path to end 
discriminatory 
criminal 
disfranchisement laws that are a relic 
of the Jim Crow era and yet continue 
to strip millions of citizens of their 
fundamental right to participate in our 
democracy. 
Some may ask why we should pursue 
this amendment, when there are clear-
er, perhaps easier, steps that Congress 
can take right now to protect voting 
rights under its existing constitutional 
authority. 
Let me give you an example. The 
Senate can quickly pass the JOHN 
LEWIS Voting Rights Act amendment, 
which the House passed last year, but 
that would rely on the decision by Sen-
ator MCCONNELL to actually let the 
Senate vote on a measure coming over 
from the House. There is little hope 
that is going to happen. 
Given the ongoing ruthless assault 
on voting rights in America, it is clear 
that additional tools are necessary to 
push back against widespread voter 
suppression. I recognize that amending 
the Constitution is no small matter. I 
am well aware that introducing this 
amendment today is not going to lead 
to any immediate change, but I also be-
lieve that this moment represents the 
next step in a movement—a movement 
in America that will ultimately lead to 
a ratification of this amendment. 
I am going to work with my col-
leagues and constituents to build sup-
port. I will ask opponents as to why 
they believe that fundamental right, 
preservative of all other rights in 
America, should not be affirmatively 
granted to the American people and lit-
erally enshrined in the United States 
Constitution—the right to vote. I plan 
to work with grassroots organizations 
who are fighting for their voting rights 
to be restored. 
I am going to work with Representa-
tive MARK POCAN of Wisconsin, who has 
led this effort in the House, and I plan 
to work with civil rights leaders, in-
cluding an old friend, Jessie Jackson, 
who for years has called for this 
amendment to be introduced in the 
Senate. 
I want to thank Reverend Jackson 
for his timeless leadership and advo-
cacy. I am grateful to have the support 
of the Rainbow/Push Coalition as we 
introduce this amendment, along with 
the Advancement Project national of-
fice. Let me thank Senators WARREN, 
SANDERS, MERKLEY, HIRONO, MARKEY, 
VAN HOLLEN, and BLUMENTHAL for co-
sponsoring, and I hope others will join 
us. 
By accident, I was given a book sev-
eral years ago entitled ‘‘White Rage,’’ 
written by Carol Anderson. Carol An-
derson is a professor at Emory Univer-
sity. The book was given to me by my 
brother-in-law, and I was skeptical 
that I would even read it, let alone like 
it. Well, I have to state that I have 
read it and recommended it over and 
over to my colleagues in the Senate, 
including giving a copy to then Senate 
Majority Leader Harry Reid. He de-
cided, after reading the book, that it 
was so good that he invited Professor 
Carol Anderson to come speak to our 
caucus. She is an amazing person and a 
great historian. 
She followed ‘‘White Rage’’ with this 
book, ‘‘One Person, No Vote.’’ In it she 
tells the history of voter suppression. 
It is an eye-opener. 
After the Civil War and all those 
deaths to end slavery, after the assas-
sination of Lincoln and after the effort 
was made to finally give to Blacks in 
the South a chance to become full- 
fledged citizens, they ran into Jim 
Crow laws. 
She talks about something which I 
had heard of but knew little about. I 
would like to say a word from the 
book. 
The question is about the efforts 
made to suppress the Black vote in the 
South, and she writes: 
That became most apparent in 1890 when 
the Magnolia State passed the Mississippi 
Plan, a dizzying array of poll taxes, literacy 
tests, 
understanding 
clauses, 
newfangled 
voter registration rules, and ‘‘good char-
acter’’ clauses—all intentionally racially 
discriminatory but dressed up in the genteel 
garb of bringing ‘‘integrity’’ to the voting 
booth. This feigned legal innocence was leg-
islative evil genius. 
Virginia representative Carter Glass, like 
so many others, swooned at the thought of 
bringing the Mississippi Plan to his own 
state [of Virginia], especially after he saw 
how well it had worked. He rushed to cham-
pion a bill in the legislature that would 
‘‘eliminate the darkey as a political factor 
. . . in less than five years.’’ Glass, whom 
President Franklin Roosevelt would one day 
describe as an ‘‘unreconstructed rebel,’’ 
planned not to ‘‘deprive a single white man 
of the ballot, but [to] inevitably cut from the 
existing electorate four-fifths of the Negro 
voters’’ in Virginia. 
One delegate questioned him: ‘‘Will it not 
be done by fraud and discrimination?’’ 
‘‘By fraud, no. By discrimination, yes,’’ 
Glass retorted. ‘‘Discrimination! Why, that 
is precisely what we propose . . . to discrimi-
nate to the very extremity . . . permissible 
. . . under . . . the Federal Constitution, 
with a view to the elimination of every negro 
voter who can be gotten rid of, legally, with-
out materially impairing the numerical 
strength of the white electorate.’’ 
Unapologetic, straight in his re-
marks, his racism was rampant, and so 
it was across the country. 
Black lives matter. America matters. 
And our democracy matters. Once and 
for all, the right to vote should be en-
shrined in our Constitution. People 
died for it. It is time for us to work 
hard to show that we care. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the text of the bill be printed 
in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the text of 
the bill was ordered to be printed in 
the RECORD, as follows: 
S.J. RES. 75 
Resolved by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled
(two-thirds of each House 
concurring therein), That the following article 
is proposed as an amendment to the Con-
stitution of the United States, which shall be 
valid to all intents and purposes as part of 
the Constitution when ratified by the legis-
latures of three-fourths of the several States: 
‘‘ARTICLE— 
‘‘SECTION 1. Every citizen of the United 
States, who is of legal voting age, shall have 
the fundamental right to vote in any public 
election held in the jurisdiction in which the 
citizen resides. 
‘‘SECTION 2. The fundamental right of citi-
zens of the United States to vote shall not be 
denied or abridged by the United States or 
by any State or political subdivision within 
a State unless such denial or abridgment is 
in furtherance of a compelling governmental 
interest and is the least restrictive means of 
furthering that compelling governmental in-
terest. 
‘‘SECTION 3. The portion of section 2 of the 
fourteenth article of amendment to the Con-
stitution of the United States that consists 
of the phrase ‘or other crime,’ is repealed. 
‘‘SECTION 4. The Congress shall have the 
power to enforce this article and protect 
against any denial or abridgement of the 
fundamental right to vote by legislation.’’.

superior

Whereas, across multiple active military 
theaters from the Far East to Southeast 
Asia, the legendary men and women of Civil

ically, and many of those men and women 
gave their lives in the defense of freedom;

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4736 
August 4, 2020 
Whereas, often at great personal risk of 
enemy ground fire and possible capture, Air 
America acted quickly and decisively to con-
duct search and rescue operations to recover 
downed aviators in trouble, always fully em-
bodying the ‘‘Airman’s Creed’’; and 
Whereas the individuals of Air America 
performed these search and rescue oper-
ations despite often outdated equipment, 
hazardous terrain, dangerous weather, and 
the bureaucracy of their own governments: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes the skill, bravery and loy-
alty of veterans of Civil Air Transport and 
Air America; and 
(2) honors the sacrifices of veterans of Civil 
Air Transport and Air America to defend 
freedom and protect the United States.

ning of such award year, and rounding the

Secretary shall publish in the Federal Reg-
ister a revised table of allowances for the 
purpose of sections 475(d)(2), 476(c)(2), and

oped by determining the present value cost, 
rounded to the nearest $100, of an annuity 
that would provide, for each age cohort of 40 
and above, a supplemental income at age 65 
(adjusted for inflation) equal to the dif-
ference between the moderate family income 
(as most recently determined by the Bureau 
of Labor Statistics), and the current average 
social security retirement benefits. For each 
age cohort below 40, the allowance shall be 
computed by decreasing the allowance for 
age 40, as updated, by one-fifteenth for each 
year of age below age 40 and rounding the re-
sult to the nearest $100. In making such de-
terminations— 
‘‘(1) inflation shall be presumed to be 6 per-

refers to adjusted available income by a per-
centage equal to the percentage increase in

paragraph (1). 
‘‘(f) CONSUMER PRICE INDEX DEFINED.—In 
this section, the term ‘Consumer Price 
Index’ means the Consumer Price Index for 
All Urban Consumers published by the De-
partment of Labor. Each annual update of 
tables to reflect changes in the Consumer 
Price 
Index

‘‘(g) EMPLOYMENT EXPENSE ALLOWANCE.—

award year, the Secretary shall publish in 
the Federal Register a revised table of em-
ployment expense allowances for the purpose

creasing the dollar amount specified in sec-
tions 475(c)(4), 476(b)(3), and 477(b)(4) to re-
flect the inflationary adjustment that is 
used for the income protection allowances in 
subsection (b).’’.

Grant for the academic year, minus the prod-
uct of— 
‘‘(aa) the adjusted gross income, less an 
amount equal to 225 percent of the poverty 
line; and 
‘‘(bb) the total maximum Federal Pell 
Grant for the academic year, divided by an 
amount equal to 100 percent of the poverty 
line. 
‘‘(ii) If the student or, in the case of a de-
pendent student, the dependent student’s 
parent, is not a single parent and the ad-
justed gross income is greater than 175 per-
cent of the poverty line and is less than 275 
percent of the poverty line, the amount shall

igible program of an institution of higher 
education on less than a full-time basis (in-
cluding a student who attends an institution 
of higher education on less than a half-time 
basis) during any academic year, the amount 
of the Federal Pell Grant to which that stu-
dent is entitled shall be reduced in direct 
proportion to the degree to which that stu-
dent is not so enrolled on a full-time basis, 
rounded to the nearest whole percentage 
point, as provided in a schedule of reductions 
published by the Secretary computed in ac-
cordance with this subpart. Such schedule of 
reductions shall be published in the Federal 
Register in accordance with section 482 of 
this Act. Such reduced Federal Pell Grant 
for a student enrolled on a less than full- 
time basis shall also apply proportionally to 
students who are otherwise eligible to re-
ceive the minimum Federal Pell Grant, if en-
rolled full-time. 
‘‘(3) AWARD MAY NOT EXCEED COST OF AT-
TENDANCE.—No Federal Pell Grant under this 
subpart shall exceed the cost of attendance 
(as defined in section 472) at the institution 
at which that student is in attendance. If, 
with respect to any student, it is determined 
that the amount of a Federal Pell Grant for 
that student exceeds the cost of attendance 
for that year, the amount of the Federal Pell 
Grant shall be reduced until the Federal Pell 
Grant does not exceed the cost of attendance 
at such institution.

other provision of this subpart, the Sec-
retary shall allow the amount of the Federal 
Pell Grant to be exceeded for students par-
ticipating in a program of study abroad ap-
proved for credit by the institution at which

costs of such program are greater than the 
cost of attendance at the student’s home in-
stitution, except that the amount of such

bursement system under subparagraph (A).

physical custody may not include certain 
safety measures that are required as part of 
formal adoption proceedings;

This title may be cited as the ‘‘Safe-

Opportunities 
Required 
to 
Kickstart the Economy Act’’ or the ‘‘SAFE 
TO WORK Act’’. 
SEC. 202. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) The SARS–CoV–2 virus that originated 
in China and causes the disease COVID–19 
has caused untold misery and devastation 
throughout the world, including in the 
United States. 
(2) For months, frontline health care work-
ers and health care facilities have fought the 
virus with courage and resolve. They did so 
at first with very little information about 
how to treat the virus and developed strate-
gies to save lives of the people of the United 
States in real time. They risked their per-
sonal health and wellbeing to protect and 
treat their patients. 
(3) Businesses in the United States kicked 
into action to produce and procure personal 
protective equipment, such as masks, gloves, 
face shields, and hand sanitizer, and other 
necessary medical supplies, such as ventila-
tors, at unprecedented rates. 
(4) To halt the spread of the disease, State 
and local governments took drastic meas-
ures. They shut down small and large busi-
nesses, schools, colleges and universities, re-
ligious, philanthropic and other nonprofit in-
stitutions, and local government agencies. 
They ordered people to remain in their 
homes. 
(5) This standstill was needed to slow the 
spread of the virus. But it devastated the 
economy of the United States. The sum of 
hundreds of local-level and State-level deci-
sions to close nearly every space in which 
people might gather brought interstate com-
merce nearly to a halt. 
(6) This halt led to the loss of millions of 
jobs. These lost jobs were not a natural con-
sequence of the economic environment, but 
rather the result of a drastic, though tem-
porary, response to the unprecedented na-
ture of this global pandemic. 
(7) Congress passed a series of statutes to 
address the health care and economic cri-
ses—the Coronavirus Preparedness and Re-
sponse Supplemental Appropriations Act, 
2020 (Public Law 116–123; 134 Stat. 146), the 
Families First Coronavirus Response Act 
(Public Law 116–127; 134 Stat. 178), the 
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Secu-
rity Act or the CARES Act (Public Law 116– 
136), and the Paycheck Protection Program 
and Health Care Enhancement Act (Public 
Law 116–139; 134 Stat. 620). In these laws Con-
gress exercised its power under the Com-
merce and Spending Clauses of the Constitu-
tion of the United States to direct trillions 
of taxpayer dollars toward efforts to aid 
workers, businesses, State and local govern-
ments, health care workers, and patients. 
(8) This legislation provided short-term in-
sulation from the worst of the economic 
storm, but these laws alone cannot protect 
the United States from further devastation. 
Only reopening the economy so that workers 
can get back to work and students can get 
back to school can accomplish that goal. 
(9) The Constitution of the United States 
specifically enumerates the legislative pow-
ers of Congress. One of those powers is the 
regulation of interstate commerce. The Gov-
ernment is not a substitute for the economy, 
but it has the authority and the duty to act 
when interstate commerce is threatened and 
damaged. As applied to the present crisis, 
Congress can deploy its power over inter-
state commerce to promote a prudent re-
opening of businesses and other organiza-
tions that serve as the foundation and back-
bone of the national economy and of com-
merce among the States. These include 
small and large businesses, schools (which 
are substantial employers in their own right 
and provide necessary services to enable par-
ents and other caregivers to return to work), 
colleges and universities (which are substan-
tial employers and supply the interstate 
market for higher-education services), reli-
gious, philanthropic and other nonprofit in-
stitutions (which are substantial employers 
and provide necessary services to their com-
munities), and local government agencies. 
(10) Congress must also ensure that the Na-
tion’s health care workers and health care 
facilities are able to act fully to defeat the 
virus. 
(11) Congress must also safeguard its in-
vestment of taxpayer dollars under the 
CARES Act and other coronavirus legisla-
tion. Congress must ensure that those funds 
are used to help businesses and workers sur-
vive and recover from the economic crisis, 
and to help health care workers and health 
care facilities defeat the virus. CARES Act 
funds cannot be diverted from these impor-
tant purposes to line the pockets of the trial 
bar. 
(12) One of the chief impediments to the 
continued flow of interstate commerce as 
this public-health crisis has unfolded is the 
risk of litigation. Small and large busi-
nesses, schools, colleges and universities, re-
ligious, philanthropic and other nonprofit in-
stitutions, and local government agencies 
confront the risk of a tidal wave of lawsuits 
accusing them of exposing employees, cus-
tomers, 
students, 
and 
worshipers 
to 
coronavirus. Health care workers face the 
threat of lawsuits arising from their efforts 
to fight the virus. 
(13) They confront this litigation risk even 
as they work tirelessly to comply with the 
coronavirus guidance, rules, and regulations 
issued by local governments, State govern-
ments, and the Federal Government. They 
confront this risk notwithstanding equip-
ment and staffing shortages. And they con-
front this risk while also grappling with con-
stantly changing information on how best to 
protect employees, customers, students, and 
worshipers from the virus, and how best to 
treat it. 
(14) These lawsuits pose a substantial risk 
to interstate commerce because they threat-
en to keep small and large businesses, 
schools, colleges and universities, religious, 
philanthropic and other nonprofit institu-
tions, and local government agencies from 
reopening for fear of expensive litigation 
that might prove to be meritless. These law-
suits further threaten to undermine the Na-
tion’s fight against the virus by exposing our 
health care workers and health care facili-
ties to liability for difficult medical deci-
sions they have made under trying and un-
certain circumstances. 
(15) These lawsuits also risk diverting tax-
payer money provided under the CARES Act 
and other coronavirus legislation from its in-
tended purposes to the pockets of opportun-
istic trial lawyers. 
(16) This risk is not purely local. It is nec-
essarily national in scale. A patchwork of 
local and State rules governing liability in 
coronavirus-related lawsuits creates tremen-
dous unpredictability for everyone partici-
pating in interstate commerce and acts as a 
significant drag on national recovery. The 
aggregation of each individual potential li-
ability risk poses a substantial and unprece-
dented threat to interstate commerce. 
(17) The accumulated economic risks for 
these potential defendants directly and sub-
stantially affects interstate commerce. Indi-
viduals and entities potentially subject to 
coronavirus-related liability will structure 
their decisionmaking to avoid that liability. 
Small and large businesses, schools, colleges 
and universities, religious, philanthropic and 
other nonprofit institutions, and local gov-
ernment agencies may decline to reopen be-
cause of the risk of litigation. They may 
limit their output or engagement with cus-
tomers and communities to avoid the risk of 
litigation. These individual economic deci-
sions substantially affect interstate com-
merce because, as a whole, they will prevent 
the free and fair exchange of goods and serv-
ices across State lines. Such economic activ-
ity that, individually and in the aggregate, 
substantially affects interstate commerce is

precisely the sort of conduct that should be 
subject to congressional regulation. 
(18) Lawsuits against health care workers 
and facilities pose a similarly dangerous risk 
to interstate commerce. Interstate com-
merce will not truly rebound from this crisis 
until the virus is defeated, and that will not 
happen unless health care workers and facili-
ties are free to combat vigorously the virus 
and treat patients with coronavirus and 
those otherwise impacted by the response to 
coronavirus. 
(19) Subjecting health care workers and fa-
cilities to onerous litigation even as they 
have done their level best to combat a virus 
about which very little was known when it 
arrived in the United States would divert im-
portant health care resources from hospitals 
and providers to courtrooms. 
(20) Such a diversion would substantially 
affect interstate commerce by degrading the 
national capacity for combating the virus 
and saving patients, thereby substantially 
elongating the period before interstate com-
merce could fully re-engage. 
(21) Congress also has the authority to de-
termine the jurisdiction of the courts of the 
United States, to set the standards for 
causes of action they can hear, and to estab-
lish the rules by which those causes of action 
should proceed. Congress therefore must act 
to 
set 
rules 
governing 
liability 
in 
coronavirus-related lawsuits. 
(22) These rules necessarily must be tem-
porary and carefully tailored to the inter-
state crisis caused by the coronavirus pan-
demic. They must extend no further than 
necessary to meet this uniquely national cri-
sis for which a patchwork of State and local 
tort laws are ill-suited. 
(23) Because of the national scope of the 
economic and health care dangers posed by 
the risks of coronavirus-related lawsuits, es-
tablishing temporary rules governing liabil-
ity 
for 
certain 
coronavirus-related 
tort 
claims is a necessary and proper means of 
carrying into execution Congress’s power to 
regulate 
commerce 
among 
the 
several 
States. 
(24) Because Congress must safeguard the 
investment of taxpayer dollars it made in 
the CARES Act and other coronavirus legis-
lation, and ensure that they are used for 
their intended purposes and not diverted for 
other purposes, establishing temporary rules 
governing liability for certain coronavirus- 
related tort claims is a necessary and proper 
means of carrying into execution Congress’s 
power to provide for the general welfare of 
the United States. 
(b) PURPOSES.—Pursuant to the powers del-
egated to Congress by article I, section 8, 
clauses 1, 3, 9, and 18, and article III, section 
2, clause 1 of the Constitution of the United 
States, the purposes of this title are to— 
(1) establish necessary and consistent 
standards for litigating certain claims spe-
cific to the unique coronavirus pandemic; 
(2) prevent the overburdening of the court 
systems with undue litigation; 
(3) encourage planning, care, and appro-
priate risk management by small and large 
businesses, schools, colleges and univer-
sities, religious, philanthropic and other 
nonprofit 
institutions, 
local 
government 
agencies, and health care providers; 
(4) ensure that the Nation’s recovery from 
the coronavirus economic crisis is not bur-
dened or slowed by the substantial risk of 
litigation; 
(5) prevent litigation brought to extract 
settlements and enrich trial lawyers rather 
than vindicate meritorious claims; 
(6) protect interstate commerce from the 
burdens of potentially meritless litigation; 
(7) ensure the economic recovery proceeds 
without artificial and unnecessary delay; 
(8) protect the interests of the taxpayers 
by ensuring that emergency taxpayer sup-
port continues to aid businesses, workers, 
and health care providers rather than enrich 
trial lawyers; and 
(9) protect the highest and best ideals of 
the national economy, so businesses can 
produce and serve their customers, workers 
can work, teachers can teach, students can 
learn, and believers can worship.

(a) REQUIREMENTS FOR LIABILITY FOR EXPO-
SURE TO CORONAVIRUS.—Notwithstanding any 
other provision of law, and except as other-
wise provided in this section, no individual 
or entity engaged in businesses, services, ac-
tivities, or accommodations shall be liable in 
any coronavirus exposure action unless the 
plaintiff can prove by clear and convincing 
evidence that— 
(1) in engaging in the businesses, services, 
activities, or accommodations, the indi-
vidual or entity was not making reasonable 
efforts in light of all the circumstances to 
comply with the applicable government 
standards and guidance in effect at the time 
of the actual, alleged, feared, or potential for 
exposure to coronavirus; 
(2) the individual or entity engaged in 
gross negligence or willful misconduct that 
caused an actual exposure to coronavirus; 
and 
(3) the actual exposure to coronavirus 
caused the personal injury of the plaintiff. 
(b) REASONABLE EFFORTS TO COMPLY.— 
(1) CONFLICTING
APPLICABLE
GOVERNMENT 
STANDARDS AND GUIDANCE.— 
(A) IN
GENERAL.—If more than 1 govern-
ment to whose jurisdiction an individual or 
entity is subject issues applicable govern-
ment standards and guidance, and the appli-
cable government standards and guidance 
issued by 1 or more of the governments con-
flicts with the applicable government stand-
ards and guidance issued by 1 or more of the 
other governments, the individual or entity 
shall be considered to have made reasonable 
efforts in light of all the circumstances to 
comply with the applicable government 
standards and guidance for purposes of sub-
section (a)(1) unless the plaintiff establishes 
by clear and convincing evidence that the in-
dividual or entity was not making reason-
able efforts in light of all the circumstances 
to comply with any of the conflicting appli-
cable government standards and guidance 
issued by any government to whose jurisdic-
tion the individual or entity is subject. 
(B) EXCEPTION.—If mandatory standards 
and regulations constituting applicable gov-
ernment standards and guidance issued by 
any government with jurisdiction over the 
individual or entity conflict with applicable 
government standards and guidance that are 
not mandatory and are issued by any other 
government with jurisdiction over the indi-
vidual or entity or by the same government 
that issued the mandatory standards and 
regulations, the plaintiff may establish that 
the individual or entity did not make reason-
able efforts in light of all the circumstances 
to comply with the applicable government 
standards and guidance for purposes of sub-
section (a)(1) by establishing by clear and 
convincing evidence that the individual or 
entity was not making reasonable efforts in 
light of all the circumstances to comply with 
the mandatory standards and regulations to 
which the individual or entity was subject. 
(2) WRITTEN OR PUBLISHED POLICY.— 
(A) IN GENERAL.—If an individual or entity 
engaged in businesses, services, activities, or 
accommodations maintained a written or 
published policy on the mitigation of trans-
mission of coronavirus at the time of the ac-
tual, alleged, feared, or potential for expo-
sure to coronavirus that complied with, or 
was more protective than, the applicable 
government standards and guidance to which 
the individual or entity was subject, the in-
dividual or entity shall be presumed to have 
made reasonable efforts in light of all the 
circumstances to comply with the applicable 
government standards and guidance for pur-
poses of subsection (a)(1). 
(B) REBUTTAL.—The plaintiff may rebut 
the presumption under subparagraph (A) by 
establishing that the individual or entity 
was not complying with the written or pub-
lished policy at the time of the actual, al-
leged, feared, or potential for exposure to 
coronavirus. 
(C) ABSENCE
OF
A
WRITTEN
OR
PUBLISHED 
POLICY.—The absence of a written or pub-
lished policy shall not give rise to a pre-
sumption that the individual or entity did 
not make reasonable efforts in light of all 
the circumstances to comply with the appli-
cable government standards and guidance for 
purposes of subsection (a)(1). 
(3) TIMING.—For purposes of subsection 
(a)(1), a change to a policy or practice by an 
individual or entity before or after the ac-
tual, alleged, feared, or potential for expo-
sure to coronavirus, shall not be evidence of 
liability for the actual, alleged, feared, or 
potential for exposure to coronavirus. 
(c) THIRD PARTIES.—No individual or entity 
shall be held liable in a coronavirus exposure 
action for the acts or omissions of a third 
party, unless— 
(1) the individual or entity had an obliga-
tion under general common law principles to 
control the acts or omissions of the third 
party; or 
(2) the third party was an agent of the indi-
vidual or entity. 
(d) MITIGATION.—Changes to the policies, 
practices, or procedures of an individual or 
entity for complying with the applicable 
government standards and guidance after the 
time of the actual, alleged, feared, or poten-
tial for exposure to coronavirus, shall not be 
considered evidence of liability or culpa-
bility.

TIONS.—

GENERAL.—An individual or entity 
against whom a final judgment is entered in 
any coronavirus-related action shall be lia-
ble solely for the portion of the judgment 
that corresponds to the relative and propor-
tionate responsibility of that individual or 
entity. In determining the percentage of re-
sponsibility of any defendant, the trier of 
fact shall determine that percentage as a 
percentage of the total fault of all individ-
uals or entities, including the plaintiff, who 
caused or contributed to the total loss in-
curred by the plaintiff. 
(2) PROPORTIONATE LIABILITY.— 
(A) DETERMINATION OF RESPONSIBILITY.—In 
any coronavirus-related action, the court 
shall instruct the jury to answer special in-
terrogatories, or, if there is no jury, the 
court shall make findings with respect to 
each defendant, including defendants who 
have entered into settlements with the 
plaintiff or plaintiffs, concerning the per-
centage of responsibility, if any, of each de-
fendant, measured as a percentage of the 
total fault of all individuals or entities who 
caused or contributed to the loss incurred by 
the plaintiff. 
(B) FACTORS FOR CONSIDERATION.—In deter-
mining the percentage of responsibility 
under this subsection, the trier of fact shall 
consider— 
(i) the nature of the conduct of each indi-
vidual or entity found to have caused or con-
tributed to the loss incurred by the plaintiff; 
and 
(ii) the nature and extent of the causal re-
lationship between the conduct of each such 
individual or entity and the damages in-
curred by the plaintiff. 
(3) JOINT LIABILITY FOR SPECIFIC INTENT OR 
FRAUD.—Notwithstanding paragraph (1), in 
any coronavirus-related action the liability 
of a defendant is joint and several if the trier 
of fact specifically determines that the de-
fendant— 
(A) acted with specific intent to injure the 
plaintiff; or 
(B) knowingly committed fraud. 
(4) RIGHT TO CONTRIBUTION NOT AFFECTED.— 
Nothing in this subsection affects the right, 
under any other law, of a defendant to con-
tribution with respect to another defendant 
determined under paragraph (3) to have 
acted with specific intent to injure the plain-
tiff or to have knowingly committed fraud. 
(b) 
LIMITATIONS
ON
DAMAGES.—In 
any 
coronavirus-related action— 
(1) the award of compensatory damages 
shall be limited to economic losses incurred 
as the result of the personal injury, harm,

losses if the trier of fact determines that the 
personal injury, harm, damage, breach, or 
tort was caused by the willful misconduct of 
the individual or entity; 
(2) punitive damages— 
(A) may be awarded only if the trier of fact 
determines that the personal injury to the 
plaintiff was caused by the willful mis-
conduct of the individual or entity; and 
(B) may not exceed the amount of compen-
satory damages awarded; and 
(3) the amount of monetary damages 
awarded to a plaintiff shall be reduced by the 
amount of compensation received by the 
plaintiff from another source in connection 
with the personal injury, harm, damage, 
breach, or tort, such as insurance or reim-
bursement by a government.

(1) IN
GENERAL.—Except as described in 
paragraphs (2) and (3), this section preempts 
and supersedes any Federal, State, or Tribal 
law, including statutes, regulations, rules, or 
standards that are enacted, promulgated, or 
established under common law, related to 
joint and several liability, proportionate or 
contributory liability, contribution, or the 
award of damages for any coronavirus-re-
lated action. 
(2) STRICTER LAWS NOT PREEMPTED OR SU-
PERSEDED.—Nothing in this section shall be 
construed to affect the applicability of any 
provision of any Federal, State, or Tribal

(A) limits the liability of a defendant in a 
coronavirus-related action to a lesser degree 
of liability than the degree of liability deter-
mined under this section; 
(B) otherwise affords a greater degree of 
protection from joint or several liability

ered from a defendant in a coronavirus-re-
lated action to a lesser amount of damages 
than the amount determined under this sec-
tion. 
(3) PUBLIC READINESS AND EMERGENCY PRE-
PAREDNESS.—Nothing in this part shall be 
construed to affect the applicability of sec-
tion 319F–3 of the Public Health Service Act 
(42 U.S.C. 247d–6d) to any act or omission in-
volving a covered countermeasure, as defined

HONORING THE LIFE OF 
CONGRESSMAN JOHN LEWIS 
HON. JOE NEGUSE 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 4, 2020 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, today I rise 
because the country has lost a true American 
hero. A giant whose sacrifices and relentless 
pursuit of equality paved the road for so many 
of us who stand here now. 
One of the greatest honors of my life was 
serving with Congressman Lewis. Occasion-
ally, I’d have the privilege of walking with him 
to this very Chamber. Along the way, there 
wasn’t a single Capitol employee whom he 
didn’t greet effusively, and often by name. Put 
simply, he was a truly generous, humble and 
decent man. 
We find ourselves in times when we must 
struggle not only for the safety of our commu-
nities, but also the soul of our nation. 
But as Mr. Lewis said, ‘‘Freedom is not a 
state; it is an act . . . it is the continuous ac-
tion we all must take, and each generation 
must do its part to create an even more fair, 
more just society.’’ 
It is, indeed, difficult times like this for which 
we are made—times when we must embody 
the spirit and drive for freedom in every one 
of our actions. 
Our fight continues while Mr. Lewis has 
earned his rest, and we benefit always from 
his life-long example and the paths he forged 
for each of us. 
From an indebted nation, thank you to Mr. 
Lewis for his endearing spirit and example.

HONORING FREDERICK WILLIAM 
RUSTEBERG 
HON. FILEMON VELA 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 4, 2020 
Mr. VELA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor and pay tribute to the extraordinary life 
of Frederick William Rusteberg of Brownsville, 
Texas. Mr. Rusteberg played an instrumental 
role in the economic and educational develop-
ment of the Brownsville community. 
Born in Brownsville, Texas, on July 1, 1946, 
Mr. Rusteberg attended Brownsville High 
School and then Texas A&M University, where 
he earned a bachelor’s degree in finance. He 
later attended Texas Tech University, where 
he completed his graduate studies and met 
his future wife, Frances Hill. 
In his youth he trained as a Huey helicopter 
pilot and served in the U.S. Army as a First 
Lieutenant in South Korea. He later returned 
to Brownsville where he worked as the assist-
ant Port Director at the Port of Brownsville. He 
then went on to become the Vice-President at 
First National Bank, and in 1984, became the 
founding President and CEO of IBC Bank in 
Brownsville, where he served for over 35 
years until his retirement. 
Mr. Rusteberg was not only a successful 
businessman; he was also a respected leader 
in his community. He served on many aca-
demic and city boards throughout his career 
where he helped to build the city of Browns-
ville’s economy and raise millions of dollars to 
support education in the Rio Grande Valley. 
His family established the first scholarship en-
dowment at the University of Texas at 
Brownsville, now known as the University of 
Texas Rio Grande Valley. 
Mr. Rusteberg was a man of great character 
who helped inspire and motivate those around 
him. In an interview with UT Brownsville Mr. 
Rusteberg said, ‘‘I believe we have a certain 
amount of control over our destiny—you can 
either sit by and watch things happen, or you 
can help make them happen.’’ Mr. Rusteberg 
made great things happen. 
Mr. Rusteberg is survived by his loving wife 
Frances, 
his 
children 
William 
(Tammy) 
Rusteberg and Liz Rusteberg (Chad) Hainley, 
his two grandchildren Jessie and William 
Hainley, and his sisters Joy (Bill) Burns and 
June (Adolph) Dittman. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life of Mr. Frederick Wil-
liam Rusteberg. He will be remembered as a 
great banker, a great boss, a great mentor 
and a great friend. He was a fundamental part 
of the South Texas community and his legacy 
will forever be remembered. I join his family in 
honoring his exemplary life.

INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT 
OF COLUMBIA COURTS IMPROVE-
MENT ACT OF 2020 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 4, 2020 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the District of Columbia Courts Im-
provement Act of 2020. This bill would make 
several important changes to improve the op-
erations of the D.C. Courts. 
First, this bill would remove the consent re-
quirement for D.C. Superior Court magistrate 
judges in certain situations. Currently, consent 
from the parties involved is required for a 
magistrate judge to perform duties in the Civil, 
Criminal and Probate Divisions of the Superior 
Court. Removing this requirement from the 
Civil and Probate Divisions in certain matters 
will further the efficiency of the judicial proc-
ess. The bill also authorizes magistrate judges 
to issue search and arrest warrants and gives 
all magistrate judges contempt authority. 
Next, the bill updates several aspects of 
juror service in the Superior Court. First, it ties 
Superior Court juror pay to the pay jurors re-
ceive in federal court. Currently, the Board of 
Judges of the Superior Court has authority to 
set the pay of jurors, but it is capped at the 
rate paid to federal jurors. Despite this, Supe-
rior Court jurors are crrently paid less than 
federal jurors. The bill also modernizes juror 
summonses by allowing jurors to complete the 
questionnaire electronically, which will save 
the court money on postage and staff time. 
The bill further allows jurors who are 70 years 
old or older to be excused from jury service if 
the individual so chooses. 
The bill also makes improvements for the 
employees of the courts. D.C. Courts non-
judicial employees and Public Defender Serv-
ice (PDS) employees are deemed to be fed-
eral employees for the purposes of early re-
tirement provisions in federal law, but the 
Courts and PDS do not currently have the per-
manent authority to make voluntary separation 
incentive payments or ‘‘buyouts’’—to employ-
ees who separate by voluntary retirement or 
by resignation, unlike the authority possessed 
by federal executive and judicial branches. 
The D.C. Courts and PDS currently have this 
authority in fiscal year 2020 under the fiscal 
year 2020 District of Columbia Appropriations 
bill, but this bill would provide permanent au-
thority. 
Next, this bill allows the D.C. Courts to pay 
attorneys appointed to represent indigent de-
fendants in criminal proceedings and indigent 
children in delinquency and need of super-
vision proceedings up to the amount currently 
allowed in federal court. The D.C. Courts’ cur-
rent rate has not been updated in eight years,

and is $42 per hour less than the federal rate. 
Similarly, the bill eliminates the $25 hourly rate 
fixed rate for D.C. Criminal Justice Act inves-
tigators. Federal investigators in D.C. are cur-
rently paid $65 an hour, and up to $75 an 
hour in death penalty and other complex 
cases. 
This bill also would move the appointment 
and removal of the Register of Wills (ROW) 
and supervisory responsibilities from the Su-
perior Court and the Chief Judge of the Supe-
rior Court; respectively, to the Executive Offi-
cer of the D.C. Courts. This change would 
provide the Executive Officer oversight of the 
personnel for the entire Probate Division, in-
cluding the ROW, which will improve efficiency 
in making personnel decisions and in the over-
all administration of the Probate Division. 
While both the federal government and the 
District of Columbia government have statu-
tory authority to give retroactive pay increase 
to employees on board at the time the in-
crease is ordered and to employees who have 
retired (not resigned) or died between the date 
the increase becomes effective and the date it 
is ordered, the D.C. Courts do not have this 
authority. This bill corrects this deficiency. 
The bill also makes corrections to portions 
of the D.C. Code that reference the Domestic 
Violence Division where it still refers to its old 
name, the Domestic Violence Unit, and up-
dates how title 11 of the D.C. Code references 
individuals with intellectual disabilities. 
Under the Home Rule Act, Congress has 
exclusive jurisdiction over title 11 of the D.C. 
Code (relating to organization and jurisdiction 
of the local D.C. Courts). Because of this, in 
recent history, legislation to improve the oper-
ations of the D.C. Courts has been enacted 
into law every few years. I hope this bill will 
likewise be adopted, and hopefully in a 
bipatisan manner. 
I urge my colleagues to support this impor-
tant bill.

RECOGNIZING CLARKDALE POLICE 
OFFICER CARLOS GODINA 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 4, 2020 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the valor of Clarkdale, Arizona 
Police Officer Carlos Godina on February 27, 
2020. Officer Godina’s selfless action in the 
midst of a confusing and dangerous scene re-
lieved a family in deep distress. 
Responding to assist a medical call, Officer 
Godina found an active crime scene as a sus-
pect had attacked a grandmother and her 
grandchild with a blunt object. In fact, shortly 
after arriving, the suspect charged Officer 
Godina with the same object, forcing Godina 
to use nonlethal force to push the suspect in-
side and away from the woman. 
It was this time that Officer Godina learned 
that the injured child was also inside the 
home, and without hesitation, he rushed into 
the house, again confronted by the suspect 
who was now also wielding a butcher knife. 
Determining that the child was in a critical 
state, Godina called upon the suspect to sub-
due so the child could be cared for. Instead, 
the suspect charged with both weapons, re-
quiring Godina to use lethal force. 
Officer Godina’s composure saved the 
grandmother’s life and preserved the suspect’s 
life as long as possible. While I am heart-
broken to announce that the child succumbed 
to his injuries, Godina’s selfless action allowed 
medical attention to provide enough time for 
the mother to spend the last minutes of their 
child’s life with them. 
Madam Speaker, I am here to recognize Of-
ficer Godina’s bravery and professionalism in 
this active and dangerous situation. Officer 
Godina displayed the best qualities of our 
country’s police officers, and at a time when 
police across the nation are wrongly looked 
down on, Officer Godina reminds us of our of-
ficers’ service to the nation and the constant 
safety we take for granted on the backs of 
their sacrifice.

LEGACY OF ROSA JAMES 
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 4, 2020 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today with a heavy heart to honor the life and 
legacy of Ms. Rosa James: an invaluable 
leader in Kansas City’s African American com-
munity who dedicated her life to improving 
public education issues, encouraging voter 
registration, and addressing civil and racial in-
justices. On Tuesday, July 22, 2020, Ms. Rosa 
James was called home to heaven after a pro-
foundly impactful 86 years of life and service. 
Ms. Rosa James was born and raised in 
Charlotte, North Carolina where she received 
the bulk of her education. In the early 1960s, 
Ms. James moved to Kansas City, Missouri 
where she served as a reading specialist for 
the Kansas City Public Schools for the next 36 
years. Ms. James retired from this work in 
1998 but remained committed to serving the 
education system. Ms. James also befriended 
and mentored future superintendent Mark Be-
dell—a testament to her desire to positively 
shape education in Kansas City for genera-
tions to come. Ms. James’ retirement would 
only be the beginning of her journey to solving 
persistent issues and working to dismantle in-
justices. 
Ms. Rosa James also spent many years of 
her life bridging the racial divides that continue 
to persist throughout our nation today. As 
someone who came of age and worked when 
the African American Civil Rights movement 
was at its peak, Ms. James dedicated herself 
to furthering the movement and actively advo-
cated for the adoption of various civil rights 
bills in the 1960s. Even after the Civil Rights 
Act of 1964 was passed, Ms. James continued 
to work toward racial justice, serving as a 
board member for the Southern Christian 
Leadership Conference (SCLC) and as an ex-
ecutive committee member for the National 
Association for the Advancement of Colored 
People (NAACP). Her work with the NAACP 
earned her the Kansas City Spirit Award and 
the NAACP President’s award. Ms. James 
also served as the 7th-ward committeewoman 
for the Jackson County Democratic Com-
mittee, helping distribute ballot information on 
election days, and would serve as a member 
of the municipal judicial nominating commis-
sion. 
The profound impacts Ms. Rosa James had 
on the Greater Kansas City area extended to 
the citizens and those she worked with and 
mentored as well, always having a positive ef-
fect on everyone with whom she interacted. 
Dr. Mark Bedell, Superintendent of Kansas 
City Public Schools, said that Ms. James ‘‘was 
a great, great lady who genuinely cared about 
this school district and the children in this 
community.’’ Each and every person that knew 
Ms. James, even those whom she simply 
helped register to vote, attest not only to her 
incredible commitment to bettering the com-
munity and the city, but also to her warm- 
hearted kindness that filled the room. 
Ms. James was someone who had a pas-
sion for public service, positive change, and 
bringing about that change. In every instance 
where there was an injustice, she was there, 
standing alongside others attempting to fix it. 
Her immeasurable commitment to bettering 
public schools, registering voters, and ad-
dressing racial injustices, along with her 
cheerful nature and friendly demeanor, left a 
lasting impact on many Kansas Citians. Her 
legacy is defined by meaningful change, lead-
ership, selflessness, and compassion. Madam 
Speaker, please join Missouri’s Fifth Congres-
sional District in honoring the life of Ms. Rosa 
James.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF CONGRESSMAN G.V. ‘‘SONNY’’ 
MONTGOMERY 
HON. MICHAEL GUEST 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 4, 2020 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, the State of 
Mississippi is known for many things—its mag-
nolias, catfish, southern charm, and Sonny 
Montgomery. Today, August 5, is the 100th 
anniversary of his birth and I would like to take 
the opportunity to pay tribute to this legendary 
figure in Mississippi history. 
Congressman Sonny Montgomery was a 
soldier, a public servant, a Veteran, and a 
southern gentleman. His friends called him 
‘‘Mr. Veteran’’ and ‘‘Mr. National Guard.’’ He 
loved his family, his friends, his university, his 
state, his country and our God. 
No one could meet Sonny Montgomery and 
not love his infectious smile and genuine 
warmth. He had an easy grin that made al-
most everyone he encountered feel like an old 
and trusted friend. While he travelled around 
the world, everyone knew Sonny’s home was 
Meridian, 
Mississippi. 
And 
Mississippians 
knew and loved Sonny and they will for many 
generations to come. 
Sonny Montgomery was guided by faith and 
principle. His strong character and integrity en-
deared him to many no matter their political al-
legiances or social status. He was genuinely

well liked on Capitol Hill, and no one on either 
side of the aisle ever questioned his sincerity, 
his integrity, or his independence. Sonny be-
lieved that partisanship should never get in the 
way of what he saw was good for the nation. 
His philosophy for life and leadership fo-
cused on faith, patriotism, relationships and 
perseverance. This is what Sonny Mont-
gomery called ‘‘staying the course.’’ 
After graduating from Mississippi State Uni-
versity in 1943, Sonny Montgomery was com-
missioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. 
Army. He served with the 12th Armored Divi-
sion in Europe during World War II and 
earned the Bronze Star Medal with ‘‘V’’ for 
Valor device for capturing a German machine 
gun nest. 
After World War II, he joined the Mississippi 
Army National Guard. In 1951, he served on 
active duty again during the Korean War as a 
member of the 31st Infantry Division. In May 
1961, as a Lieutenant Colonel, Sonny es-
corted a group of Freedom Riders from the 
Alabama border to Jackson. Our late col-
league John Lewis was on that bus. Sonny re-
tired as a major general in 1980 after 35 years 
of military service. 
On January 3, 1967, Sonny Montgomery 
was sworn in as a Congressman from the dis-
trict I represent today. Sonny’s greatest legis-
lative victory is the enactment of the bill which 
bears his name—the Montgomery GI Bill. As 
a World War II Veteran, he believed the coun-
try should provide educational benefits to its 
service members, and the combination of mili-
tary service and a college degree would make 
these individuals valuable assets to the coun-
try. Sonny Montgomery saw the educational 
shortfall as a direct threat to America’s military 
readiness and national security and used the 
GI Bill to reinvigorate the volunteer base of 
America’s military. 
In October 1984, President Ronald Reagan 
signed into law the Montgomery GI Bill. Under 
the new education benefits, Veterans with two 
years of active service who contributed $1,200 
of their own money were eligible to receive tui-
tion payments of $300 a month for 36 months. 
The new GI Bill was also the first to offer edu-
cation benefits to National Guard and Reserve 
personnel. 
Another of Sonny Montgomery’s achieve-
ments was the creation of the Department of 
Veterans Affairs. His bipartisan efforts ele-
vated the Veterans Administration into an offi-
cial cabinet department in March 1989. Presi-
dent George H. W. Bush offered Montgomery 
the position of secretary of the new depart-
ment, but he decided to continue to serve the 
people of Mississippi in Congress. 
As freshman members of the 90th Con-
gress, Sonny Montgomery and George H. W. 
Bush began a friendship that lasted until the 
Congressman passed away. It is said this bi-
partisan coalition was only challenged during 
their ‘‘do or die’’ dollar a game paddleball 
matches in the House gym with more bragging 
rights on the line. President Bush wrote, 
‘‘While I served in Congress and after that in 
the Executive Branch of government, Sonny 
remained a close confidant, a man whose 
judgement I always trusted, a man whose 
friendship gave me comfort when the going 
got tough.’’ Sonny was a frequent visitor to the 
White House and often spent holidays with the 
Bush family. 
Sonny Montgomery served along with the 
administrations of seven presidents during his 
three decades in the House chamber. His leg-
acy of public service stretches across genera-
tions and party lines and is a testament to 
America’s strong national defense. Sonny re-
tired from Congress in 1997 and returned to 
Meridian. Sonny was awarded the Presidential 
Medal of Freedom by President George W. 
Bush in 2005. 
Sonny Montgomery was a loyal son to Mis-
sissippi, from his birth to his passing, he was 
one of ours. But his work and legacy belong 
to America. We are all indebted to Sonny for 
making our great nation what it is today. 
Sonny Montgomery said, ‘‘Patriotism is a 
pretty simple word, but also a beautiful word 
to most Americans.’’ Sonny Montgomery ex-
emplified patriotism. The gentleman from Mis-
sissippi is recognized and remembered on the 
100th anniversary of his birth.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
HON. PAUL MITCHELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 4, 2020 
Mr. MITCHELL. Madam Speaker, on Roll 
Call No. 178, I am not recorded. Had I been

IN HONOR OF PASTOR JOHN 
POWELL 
HON. KEVIN BRADY 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 4, 2020 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, today I rise to 
honor the life of an incredible servant, John 
Powell, Senior Pastor of Emmanuel Baptist 
Church of New Caney, Texas. 
After stopping on the roadside to help 
someone in distress, Pastor Powell was trag-
ically killed when he was struck by a passing 
truck. Robert Downen, a reporter with the 
Houston Chronicle, wrote a very touching arti-
cle about Pastor Powell’s life and the example 
he set for others—one of selfless service. Ac-
cording to Robert Downen’s account, Pastor 
Powell and a friend were driving in Sherman, 
Texas, when they spotted a car catch fire on 
the side of the road. Pastor Powell imme-
diately stopped, grabbed his emergency kit 
bag and rushed to help. Just as he and his 
friend arrived at the scene, the brakes failed 
on an approaching semi-truck and it veered 
toward the group. Pastor Powell took decisive 
action and was able to push one individual out 
of the way, saving their life. Unfortunately, the 
young pastor was unable to get out of the way 
himself, and was killed. 
Pastor Powell grew up in Kansas City, Mis-
souri, where he knew from a young age that 
he wanted to pursue ministry. That desire led 
him to enroll in the Southern Baptist Theo-
logical Seminary in Louisville, Kentucky where 
he earned his Master of Divinity degree. While 
at the seminary, he showed his care and con-
cern for those less fortunate and began lead-
ing worship services at local homeless shel-
ters. 
After graduation, Powell took on a chal-
lenging assignment and became the pastor of 
a small Baptist church in the West Texas town 
of Hamlin. When later reflecting on the les-
sons he learned during that time, Powell said, 
‘‘Success is faithfulness, even when it’s hard, 
even when you want to give up.’’ 
In 2016, Powell and his family moved to the 
Eighth Congressional District of Texas, where 
he established the Emmanuel Baptist Church 
in New Caney. Over the years, Powell grew 
this small church into a pillar of the community 
and guided his 140 members to walk in the 
light of the Lord, and in fellowship with one 
another. 
Those who knew Pastor Powell remember 
him as bright, passionate, and warm-hearted. 
Many spoke of him as, ‘‘the best man [they’ve] 
ever known.’’ Andrew Walker, a professor at 
Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, said 
of Powell, ‘‘In every sphere of life where he 
had influence, he always wielded it for the bet-
terment of others.’’ 
The Houston Chronicle reported that in Pas-
tor Powell’s final sermon before his death, he 
preached from Psalm 72, saying that, ‘‘in the 
poor man’s distress, Christians might be 
there’’ and asked his congregation, ‘‘How 
could we pray that God would have compas-
sion on those that need it while not having 
that compassion on them ourselves?’’ To 
those who knew him, it was no surprise that 
Pastor John Powell stopped on the side of a 
road to help someone in distress. He died as 
he lived—helping others. He was a man of 
faith and faithfulness who had compassion for 
others, and who willingly risked and ultimately 
sacrificed his own life so that others might live. 
He was a hero. He leaves a legacy of selfless 
service and compassion. His life was a true 
example of Christian love and sacrifice, values 
that we would all do well to reflect on and try 
to emulate. 
Pastor Powell is survived by his wife, Kath-
erine, and their four beautiful children. I join 
the Powell family, the Emmanuel Baptist 
Church, and the entire community of New 
Caney in mourning this tragic loss. May God 
bless Pastor John Powell.

HONORING THE LIFE OF FORMER 
TAIWAN PRESIDENT LEE TENG- 
HUI 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 4, 2020 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life of former Taiwan President 
Lee Teng-hui, revered as Mr. Democracy. As 
the first democratically elected leader of Tai-
wan, Lee is an icon for democracy and plu-
ralism to not just Taiwan, but freedom loving 
people around the world. 
Well known for the symbolism of his election 
and his strong maneuvering which kept Tai-
wan from the grasps of the People’s Republic 
of China, we cannot forget his extensive serv-
ice to Taiwan. Beginning as mayor of Taipei, 
he would go on to serve as the governor of 
the Taiwan province and vice president before 
assuming the presidency in 1988. 
It was from this position he would oversee 
the 1996 election, becoming the first demo-
cratically elected president. Even in the face of 
Chinese aggression, Lee preserved this ad-
vancement and upheld the integrity of his 
election. Today, Taiwan is a strong, key mem-
ber of the global community of nations and 
serves as a symbol of freedom, human rights, 
and democracy for all. 
Madam Speaker, I express my deepest con-
dolences to the family of Lee Teng-hui and the 
people of Taiwan on his passing, and I en-
courage my colleagues to join me in cele-
brating his life and legacy as a beacon of 
democratic advancement.

IN 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
THE 
LIFE 
AND LEGACY OF BRUCE WAT-
KINS, JR. 
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 4, 2020 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, it is with a 
heavy heart that I rise today to honor the life 
and legacy of Mr. Bruce Watkins, Jr. Mr. Wat-
kins spent his days on Earth fighting to pre-
serve, honor, and protect the stories of the Af-
rican Americans who helped build and grow 
Kansas City, living a life that deserves both 
recognition and reflection. 
Mr. Watkins was born in the time of Emmett 
Till and Rosa Parks, into a family with a pro-
found and unwavering commitment to advanc-
ing the cause of civil rights in Kansas City. His 
father was both a co-founder and the second 
president of Freedom, Incorporated, Kansas 
City’s local, Black political organization, as 
well as the first African American elected to 
the City Council of Kansas City. In 1966, his 
father was elected a Circuit Court Clerk, mak-
ing him the first Black person elected to Jack-
son County government, and would later be-
come the first African American to nearly win 
a KC mayoral race. As a former city council 
member and Kansas City’s first African Amer-
ican Mayor, I know that the path I walk was 
planned, plowed, and paved by Bruce Wat-
kins, Sr. It has been an honor to watch Bruce 
Watkins, Jr. valiantly carry his father’s mission 
into the 21st century. 
Mr. Watkins grew up alongside the African 
American Civil Rights Movement, went to 
Southeast High School, and then studied at 
University of Nevada-Las Vegas’ College of 
Business, where he graduated in 1977 with a 
Bachelor of Science in Human Resources 
Management and Services. Thirteen years 
later, he would return to school to earn his As-
sociate degree at Kansas City Kansas Com-
munity College’s School of Mortuary Science, 
before starting his career as a funeral director. 
Mr. Watkins was a keeper of stories. As a 
funeral director at the Watkins Brothers Me-
morial Chapel, Mr. Watkins spent thirty-one 
years performing the unglamorous but noble 
work of honoring our community’s dead and 
supporting their grieving families. As a leading 
member of the Watkins Foundation, he led the 
campaign to have Kansas City’s East Patrol 
Crime Lab named after prominent civil rights 
leader Leon Jordon, forty-five years after his 
assassination. As a member of Freedom, In-
corporated, Mr. Watkins aided in the group’s 
mission to register African American voters in 
Kansas City, elect them to local office, and en-
sure that the voices of Black Kansas Citians 
were heard within the halls of government. 
And as eminent Kansas City leaders, he and 
his cousin Warren Watkins, Jr. fought to gain 
recognition for the slaves likely buried at the 
site of the City’s new airport. Mr. Watkins was 
integral to that continued mission to make 
sure that those we welcome to our magnificent 
city also know of its painful past, etching a 
symbolic headstone of history for his ances-
tors whose graves remain largely unmarked. 
I was proud to call Mr. Watkins a dear friend 
and am humbled not only by his life of service 
but also by the task of paying tribute to it. On 
this day, I wonder how to properly honor 
someone who spent his whole life honoring 
others—how one can do justice to the story of 
a lifelong storyteller. Perhaps, the answer lies 
in not only telling Mr. Watkins’ story but also 
the stories he was passionate about pre-
serving. When we in the Missouri 5th drive on 
Bruce R. Watkins Memorial Drive or pass by 
the Bruce R. Watkins Cultural Center—when 
we look upon the Spirit of Freedom Fountain 
or drive by the Green Duck Lounge—when we 
tell the stories of Fred Curls or Lucile Bluford 
or Leon Jordon—we honor the life and work of 
Bruce Watkins, Jr. May God allow him to con-
tinue that work in the company of that other 
great storyteller, who told us all of the Sower, 
the Weeds, and the Mustard Seed. I think 
they’ll get along well. 
As the keeper of a history he helped make, 
Mr. Watkins continued a four-generation story 
of a family and a city that loved and chal-
lenged one another. Madam Speaker, please 
join me in honoring the life of Bruce Watkins, 
Jr. Let us all seek to emulate his example by 
preserving the stories that tell us who we are 
as a people and a nation and let one of those 
stories be his.
