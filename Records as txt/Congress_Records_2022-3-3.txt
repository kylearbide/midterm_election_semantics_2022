House of Representatives 
The House met at 9 a.m. and was

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Almighty God, You who dwell in 
Your high and holy place, high and 
lofty One who inhabits eternity, hear 
the prayers of those who reside in the 
torment of these times. 
In these harrowing days when na-
tions rage and war threatens to upend 
this fragile world, we call to You with 
humble hearts that You would speak 
into our conflicts and bring order to 
our chaos. 
May this be a time for our self-reflec-
tion. 
How have we played a part in the in-
stability of the world’s order? Call us 
to account for any careless stewardship 
of our influence. 
How have we failed to prevent blood-
shed and destruction? Take us to task 
for any indifference we may have 
shown to the growing unrest around us. 
Repay the contrariness of our faith-
fulness with the comfort of Your con-
stant care. In Your great mercy, heal 
our world. Lead those who call upon 
You out of harm’s way. 
Revive the spirit of the humble, 
those whose courage grows faint, whose 
souls languish in the midst of violence 
and oppression, and grant us Your 
peace. 
We call upon Your sovereign name. 
Amen.

THE JOURNAL 
The SPEAKER. Pursuant to section 
11(a) of House Resolution 188, the Jour-
nal of the last day’s proceedings is ap-
proved. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman 
from California (Mr. LAMALFA) come 
forward and lead the House in the 
Pledge of Allegiance. 
Mr. LAMALFA led the Pledge of Alle-
giance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
The SPEAKER. The Chair will enter-
tain up to five requests for 1-minute 
speeches on each side of the aisle.

PROVIDING SUPPORT TO UKRAINE 
(Ms. DEAN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. 
DEAN. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
no 
amount of warnings from the Biden ad-
ministration and our intelligence could 
have prepared us for the sheer bru-
tality and devastation we have seen 
from Mr. Putin, who expected a quick 
toppling of Ukraine’s young democ-
racy. He was wrong. 
We have watched in awe the resil-
ience and heroism of the Ukrainians 
led by President Zelensky. But their 
bravery alone is not enough. We must 
meet their bravery with global support. 
This is a war and a humanitarian cri-
sis—families, children, forced to leave 
their homes in the carnage of war. The 
number of refugees fleeing Ukraine has 
already exceeded 1 million, and it is es-
timated that it will go as high as 5 mil-
lion. But death, destruction, and dis-
placement must not be forever. 
Madam Speaker, I thank President 
Biden and his administration for their 
steadfast leadership in the West’s sup-
port of Ukraine. Alongside the Presi-
dent, this Congress must continue to 
provide necessary weapons, medicines, 
food, fuel, and refuge. 
Ukrainians worldwide, please know: 
We are here for you. You are welcome 
here. 
God 
bless 
America. 
God 
bless 
Ukraine. 
f 
CLEARING BACKLOGGED VETERAN 
REQUESTS 
(Mr. KELLER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, since 
November 2020, our team has pressured 
the National Personnel Records Center, 
the agency responsible for processing 
veterans’ service records, to return to 
full staffing levels and expedite the re-
quests of veterans, who in some cases 
have waited over a year for access to 
their benefits. 
Most recently, the NPRC was oper-
ating at 25 percent capacity due to the 
pandemic, but it said it would fully re-
open this month. However, the agency 
offered no plan on how it will tackle a 
backlog that has now grown to 600,000 
records requests. That is 100,000 more 
added since June 2021. 
The lack of transparency at the 
NPRC has made it clear that we must 
pass legislation, like the RECORDS 
Act, to direct the NPRC to fully reopen 
and report to Congress on its efforts to 
clear out the backlog of records re-
quests. 
Our veterans did not hesitate to sac-
rifice for America, and we must not 
hesitate in our duty to ensure they 
have a responsive government that is 
attentive to their needs.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1278 
March 3, 2022 
Union address, President Biden’s first 
year delivered a record-breaking num-
ber of new jobs. In total, 6.7 million 
new jobs were created for hardworking 
Americans. 
America also saw the largest cal-
endar-year decrease in unemployment 
in the Nation’s history, paired with 
record-breaking GDP growth. 
But America’s economic prosperity is 
only one side of the equation. Amer-
ica’s public health has also been 
strengthened during Biden’s first year. 
Vaccination rates have tremendously 
risen from 15 percent to a whopping 65 
percent in 1 year for full vaccination. 
That is more than 215 million fully vac-
cinated Americans—again, a record. In 
addition, 70 million households also re-
ceived free COVID tests, and those 
numbers will only rise. 
While these are tremendous accom-
plishments, I can’t say I am too sur-
prised. You see, we have a strong lead-
er in the White House and the backing 
of the American people. As President 
Biden said on Tuesday, never bet 
against the American people. 
f 
HONORING LAW ENFORCEMENT 
(Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I have met with many police 
officers who serve communities in 
Texas’ 25th District, and I continue to 
be inspired by their acts of bravery and 
dedication to protecting others. 
Now, we are facing a time where 
there has been a tragic increase in po-
lice officers being targeted and killed 
while on the job as violent crime sky-
rockets across America. 
Last year alone, 346 officers were 
shot in the line of duty, the highest in 
20 years. One of Texas 25th’s own, Hill 
County Constable Kevin Cordell, was 
shot multiple times while on a high- 
speed car chase. One bullet went 
through the windshield of his vehicle, 
struck him in the head, and exited 
through his neck. By God’s grace, he 
survived the shooting and recovered 
after surgery. 
Liberal activists who care more 
about political agendas than public 
safety are making our cities unsafe. 
Last year, Austin, Texas, submitted to 
the radical left’s antipolice hatred and 
cut $150 million from their police budg-
et. This budget cut put Texas families 
and residents at greater risk for longer 
emergency response times and paves 
the way for lawlessness to run wild in 
the city. 
f 
HONORING REGINA JACKSON 
(Ms. LEE of California asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 
retirement of Ms. Regina Jackson, a 
phenomenal leader and constituent and 
a very good friend, after over 27 years 
of service as president and CEO of the 
East Oakland Youth Development Cen-
ter. 
Ms. 
Jackson’s 
involvement 
with 
EOYDC began in 1984 when, as a grad-
uate of the Coro Fellowship graduate 
program in public affairs, she was in-
vited to serve on the board of directors. 
Ms. Jackson has made it her mission to 
invest in our children and has dedi-
cated herself to this work. 
A key part of her mission at EOYDC 
has been inspiring our youth to per-
form at high levels by providing a safe, 
nurturing environment where young 
people could grow and thrive. 
In addition, her contributions to our 
community are magnificent. She is a 
global thought leader for youth devel-
opment. The International Diplomacy 
Council has sought her expertise to 
counsel agencies across the world. Re-
cently, with the support of my office 
and local East Bay organizations, Ms. 
Jackson led two delegations of stu-
dents to China for a cross-cultural ex-
change. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the 13th 
Congressional District of California, I 
commend Ms. Jackson for her tireless 
service and dedication and wish her 
well in this new chapter of her life. 
f 
PURSUE ENERGY, NOT POLITICAL 
AGENDAS 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, this 
country faces an energy crisis of all 
types: fuel, gas, electricity. But what is 
the issue we are pursuing? It seems to 
be all about this little sliver right here 
on this chart: carbon dioxide. 
Most people are surprised when told 
0.04 percent composes the carbon diox-
ide part of our atmosphere. You see 78 
percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen, 
trace gases. I had to break this out of 
trace gases so you can see it on the 
chart. 
Yet, in my home State of Cali-
fornia—where we had CO2-free power 
plants, two nuclear plants; the second 
one will be gone in 3 years—they want 
to remove hydroelectric dams on the 
Klamath River in my district that 
make zero CO2. 
So, is this really about CO2, or is it 
about some other political agenda? Be-
cause in my district, when the wind 
blows, they have to shut the power off 
because the trees the Forest Service 
are not managing might blow into the 
power lines coming from a hydro-
electric dam. 
I do not understand what the energy 
policy of this country is because I don’t 
think there is one anymore. We need to 
get back to doing what we do well and 
not pursue this fruitless agenda. 
HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF RAYMOND JORDAN, JR. 
(Ms. PRESSLEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the life and legacy 
of the late State Representative Ray-
mond Jordan, Jr. 
Representative Jordan was a good 
man, a trailblazing man, and a friend 
and mentor to many. A resident of 
Springfield and a product of Spring-
field Public Schools, he went on to be-
come the first African American elect-
ed to the Massachusetts State House. 
Over the course of his career, he 
chaired the powerful Ways and Means 
Committee and the Committee on 
Housing and Urban Development. His 
indefatigable commitment to equity 
and justice earned him the enduring 
yet fitting nickname of ‘‘Barracuda.’’ 
His impact in his local community 
and in Massachusetts’ history and poli-
tics is indelible and enduring—in bills, 
in laws, in buildings, but, most of all, 
in people. 
But many of his greatest achieve-
ments will live on through the loving 
family that he built alongside the love 
of his life, Donna Harris Jordan. Of all 
his most memorable titles and tasks, 
he would most want to be remembered 
as a loving husband and father who 
fought tirelessly for his community 
and his people. 
When I think of the late Raymond 
Jordan, Jr., I am reminded of the words 
of the African-American hymn that 
says: ‘‘May the work I have done speak 
for me.’’ 
Indeed, the many works of Raymond 
Jordan speak for him both now and for 
eternity. May he rest in power and in 
peace. 
f 
BIDEN ENERGY CRISIS 
(Mr. MOORE of Alabama asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MOORE of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, we are in the depths of the 
Biden energy crisis. 
On day one of Joe Biden’s Presi-
dency, he launched his war on Amer-
ican energy when he killed the Key-
stone XL pipeline, which could be sup-
plying 830,000 barrels of oil a day from 
Canada to U.S. refineries. As recently 
as a few days ago, we imported 600,000 
barrels of oil from Russia. 
During the State of the Union, Presi-
dent Biden claimed he wanted to ‘‘Buy 
American.’’ But regrettably, he did not 
apply that to our oil or our natural 
gas. Biden has made it crystal clear 
that his anti-energy agenda would con-
tinue. 
He also announced that he would 
once again tap into the Strategic Pe-
troleum Reserve and release 30 million 
barrels of oil in another desperate at-
tempt to reduce gas prices here at 
home. The SPR is supposed to be used 
for national security emergencies and

for major weather events, not for Biden 
to use as a political Hail Mary when 
his policies fail us. Energy security is 
national security. 
Let me say this: Winston Churchill 
said appeasement is like feeding a croc-
odile and hoping he eats you last. We 
must stop appeasing Russia. We must 
be Churchill in this moment, not 
Chamberlain.

RUSSIA’S WAR ON UKRAINE 
(Mr. RUIZ asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, Russia’s 
unprovoked, 
unjustified 
war 
on 
Ukraine threatens peace, democracy, 
and stability around the globe. How-
ever, what it does not do is break us, 
and it has not broken the people of 
Ukraine. 
Instead, the people of Ukraine have 
shown the world their resilience and 
the strength of democracy. As we work 
to hold Vladimir Putin accountable for 
his aggression, we must also ensure 
that we provide support for the Ukrain-
ian people as they seek certainty and 
refuge. 
As an emergency physician and the 
only trained humanitarian in Congress, 
I have seen firsthand what lies ahead 
for those fleeing a crisis. This is a com-
plex humanitarian crisis and deserves a 
human response. The U.S. must con-
tribute to that response, including 
helping our humanitarian partners on 
the ground and granting Ukrainians 
refuge and temporary protected status 
to Ukrainian nationals here in the 
country. 
Madam Speaker, I stand in solidarity 
with the Ukrainian people to protect 
their sovereignty, and my prayers are 
with them.

HONORING OUR PROMISE TO AD-
DRESS COMPREHENSIVE TOXICS 
ACT OF 2021 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. 
DINGELL). Pursuant to clause 1(c) of 
rule XIX, further consideration of the 
bill (H.R. 3967) to improve health care 
and benefits for veterans exposed to 
toxic substances, and for other pur-
poses will now resume. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
AMENDMENT NO. 20 OFFERED BY MS. ROSS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 20 
printed in part B of House Report 117– 
253. 
Ms. ROSS. Madam Speaker, I have an 
amendment at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Page 67, after line 10, insert the following: 
(1) INITIAL
REPORT.—Not later than one 
year after the date of the enactment of this 
Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to 
Congress a report regarding the following: 
(A) Sources of PFAS on military installa-
tions other than AFFF. 
(B) Any recommendation of the Secretary 
regarding whether to expand eligibility for 
the 
registry 
to 
individuals 
exposed 
to 
sources of PFAS described in subparagraph 
(A).

‘‘(4)’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 950, the gen-
tlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. 
ROSS) and a Member opposed each will 
control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from North Carolina. 
Ms. ROSS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge 
support for my amendment, along with 
my colleague from North Carolina, 
Representative ROUZER. 
This amendment will require the De-
partment of Defense to study addi-
tional non-fire extinguishing agent 
sources of toxic PFAS, known as for-
ever chemicals on military installa-
tions. 
Our amendment also requires the De-
partment of Defense to make a rec-
ommendation to Congress on expand-
ing the eligibility for the VA’s registry 
of individuals exposed to PFAS during 
their service. 
While fire extinguishing agents are a 
common source of servicemember expo-
sure to forever chemicals, as the 
Speaker knows, PFAS toxins are ever 
present on military bases from other 
sources. 
Studies have shown that these dan-
gerous toxicants are ubiquitous in the 
kinds of ready-made meal packages, 
textiles, and cookware used on mili-
tary installations. Use of these prod-
ucts has exposed servicemembers and 
veterans to PFAS, which have been 
proven to cause cancer, liver damage, 
birth defects, and other troubling med-
ical conditions. 
We must ensure that we fully under-
stand the scope of PFAS exposure on 
military bases and expand our param-
eters for veteran eligibility for medical 
care accordingly. Doing so will give 
veterans exposed to these toxins the 
opportunity to receive care for the con-
ditions they develop as a result of their 
service in uniform. 
This amendment not only empowers 
and protects veterans, but it solicits a 
critically important study from the 
DOD to better understand the presence 
of PFAS on military installations and 
prevent exposure in the future. 
In alignment with the mission of the 
Honoring our PACT Act, this amend-
ment upholds our responsibility to pre-
vent and mitigate the health con-
sequences of exposure to toxic sub-
stances. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman 
TAKANO for his outstanding leadership 
in bringing this important legislation 
to the floor. I also thank Representa-
tive ROUZER from North Carolina for 
joining me in offering this amendment. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I claim time in opposition, al-
though I am not opposed. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the gentlewoman from Iowa 
is recognized for 5 minutes. 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. ROSS. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. TAKANO), the chairman of 
the Veterans’ Affairs Committee. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding, 
and I am pleased to support this 
amendment by the gentlewoman and 
Congressman ROUZER. 
It will require DOD to submit to Con-
gress a report on sources of PFAS on 
military installations other than aque-
ous film-forming foam and providing 
recommendations regarding whether to 
expand registry eligibility to individ-
uals exposed to PFAS from other 
sources. 
The PFAS data gathered by this 
amendment will be a tremendous value 
as VA, DOD, and other agencies across 
our Federal Government continue their 
research related to this important mat-
ter. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’. 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. ROSS. Madam Speaker, this 
amendment will help us understand ad-
ditional sources of PFAS exposure on 
military bases and empower veterans 
to seek medical care accordingly. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support my amendment 
along with Representative ROUZER and 
the underlying bill, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 950, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendment offered by the gentle-
woman 
from

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1280 
March 3, 2022 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 180 days 
after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall take 
actions necessary to ensure that the burn pit 
registry may be updated with the cause of 
death of a deceased registered individual 
by— 
(A) an individual designated by such de-
ceased registered individual; or 
(B) if no such individual is designated, an 
immediate family member of such deceased 
registered individual. 
(2) DESIGNATION.—The Secretary shall pro-
vide, with respect to the burn pit registry, a 
process by which a registered individual may 
make a designation for purposes of para-
graph (1)(A). 
(b) DEFINITIONS.—In this section: 
(1) The term ‘‘burn pit registry’’ means the 
registry established under section 201 of the 
Dignified Burial and Other Veterans’ Bene-
fits Improvement Act of 2012 (Public Law 
112–260; 38 U.S.C. 527 note). 
(2) The term ‘‘immediate family member’’, 
with 
respect 
to 
a 
deceased 
individual, 
means— 
(A) the spouse, parent, brother, sister, or 
adult child of the individual; 
(B) an adult person to whom the individual 
stands in loco parentis; or 
(C) any other adult person— 
(i) living in the household of the individual 
at the time of the death of the individual; 
and 
(ii) related to the individual by blood or 
marriage. 
(3) The term ‘‘registered individual’’ means 
an individual registered with the burn pit 
registry. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 950, the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. RUIZ) and 
a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
my amendment to the Honoring our 
PACT Act, which includes language 
from my bill, the Burn Pits Registry 
Enhancement Act. 
This amendment would allow vet-
erans in the burn pits registry to des-
ignate someone to update the registry 
with their cause of death. I hope that 
makes common sense. This data is cru-
cial to further identify illnesses that 
are causing burn pit exposed veterans 
to die and will help doctors recognize 
early symptoms. 
I also rise in support of another 
amendment I submitted that was part 
of an en bloc package that passed yes-
terday. That amendment is from my 
Reducing Exposure to Burn Pits Act. It 
would require the DOD to consider 
safer alternatives to burn pits. This 
amendment will get us one step closer 
to ending the exposure to toxic burn 
pits once and for all. 
I have fought for years to bring at-
tention to this issue and its dev-
astating toll on our Nation’s service-
members and their families. 
I have told the story of Jennifer 
Kepner, an Air Force veteran from Ca-
thedral City in my district. She was an 
otherwise healthy mother of two who 
lost her courageous battle with pan-
creatic cancer likely caused by her ex-
posure to burn pits during her military 
service. 
I have told the story of Alejandro 
Camacho, my constituent from Palm 
Desert, who developed testicular can-
cer from the toxic smoke and carcino-
gens he breathed in every day during 
his service in Iraq. 
It is for Jennifer, Alejandro, and the 
millions of other veterans suffering 
from their burn pit exposure that I 
founded the bipartisan, bicameral Con-
gressional Burn Pit Caucus. 
It is why I introduced the Presump-
tive Benefits for War Fighters Exposed 
to Burn Pits and Other Toxins Act to 
create a presumption of service connec-
tion for 23 illnesses related to service 
near burn pits. 
That bill is included in the Honoring 
our PACT Act and highlights the ur-
gent need to pass it now. The Honoring 
our PACT Act will take urgent and ag-
gressive action to give the veterans the 
care they need and ensure we don’t re-
peat the Agent Orange delays that our 
Vietnam veterans experienced. 
Last night, I texted the widower of 
Jennifer Kepner, Ben Kepner, and I 
said: Tomorrow is the big day, my 
friend. He texted back: Tomorrow is 
Jennifer Kepner’s birthday. So we will 
pass this bill on Jennifer Kepner’s 
birthday, which is amazing. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to 
Chairman TAKANO. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of the amendment intro-
duced by Representatives RUIZ, RYAN, 
and GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N. 
Madam Speaker, I want to take my 
30 seconds to just say how much this 
bill, the Honoring our PACT Act, rests 
on the work, passion, and energy of the 
gentleman from the neighboring dis-
trict in Riverside County, which we 
both have the honor to represent. 
Dr. RUIZ has brought his tremendous 
knowledge as a doctor, somebody with 
three medically-related degrees from 
Harvard University—the first Latino to 
do so. I can’t say enough about the 
work that he has done to make this 
possible, and we all are grateful. 
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I claim time in opposition, al-
though I am not opposed. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the gentlewoman from Iowa 
is recognized for 5 minutes. 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, how 
much time do I have remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 13⁄4 minutes remaining. 
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to thank Chairman TAKANO and 
the Veterans’ Affairs Committee staff 
for their tireless work, their leader-
ship, their courage and bravery to ad-
dress this incredible problem. 
I would also like to thank all the vet-
erans who spoke up when nobody lis-
tened, like Rosie Torres from Burn Pits 
360; and many others who have lost a 
loved one; and all the widows who have 
been crying to be recognized and plead-
ing with us to do something so that 
other veterans wouldn’t suffer these 
atrocities. 
This is a self-inflicted DOD wound 
that our military did to our service-
members, and now they are dying as 
delayed casualties of war due to those 
exposures. We need to save lives today. 
This is a life-and-death situation. 
If there is ever a human face to pol-
icy, it is now in this policy because 
there are children wondering why, 
when their parents came back healthy 
from the war, they died 5, 6, 7 years 
later. This is why we need to pass this 
bill and ensure that our promise to our 
veterans, and our promise to our Viet-
nam veterans, that we will never allow 
their 
Agent 
Orange 
experience 
to 
translate ever again into the American 
experience. 
This is our time to stand up for our 
veterans, not just in hugging flags, but 
also in pragmatic solidarity and sup-
port to give them the care and the re-
lief that they need right now. 
Madam Speaker, I wish the Kepner 
family a very happy birthday celebra-
tion in memory of Jennifer Kepner. I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, as both a physician and a 24- 
year military veteran coming from a 
family of veterans, married to a vet-
eran of 30 years, let me say to my col-
leagues: We can save lives today with a 
bill on the President’s desk today by 
passing in this Chamber the Health 
Care for Burn Pit Veterans Act. We can 
pass that now and they can receive 
healthcare now. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 950, the gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. RYAN) and a 
Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Ohio. 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
Chairman TAKANO for including in this 
bill the Heath Robinson Burn Pit 
Transparency Act as a part of this 
comprehensive bill to address toxic ex-
posure in our veteran community. I 
rise today to discuss my amendment, 
the Heath Robinson Burn Pit Trans-
parency Act, named for Heath Robin-
son whom I spoke about in this very 
Chamber just 4 months ago. 
I stand here humbled to see it come 
to the floor in a bipartisan effort to fi-
nally address this dire problem. 
Heath deployed to Kosovo in 2004 and 
Iraq in 2006 and was the Ohio National 
Guard NCO Soldier of the Year in 2012 
and 2013. 
Being a soldier was Heath’s identity. 
He was proud of his service and hum-
bled to serve overseas defending those 
he loved. While deployed, Heath was 
exposed to burn pits in Iraq, and those 
toxic wounds of war followed Heath 
home. He was a loving father, husband, 
and son who, unfortunately and trag-
ically, lost his life on May 6, 2020, at 
the young age of 39. His story is a so-
bering one but reminds us why this 
amendment is needed. 
In late 2016, Heath began noticing 
early symptoms starting with fatigue 
which worsened to chronic, gushing 
nosebleeds and bleeding from his ears. 
After a dozen doctors were unable to 
provide answers, it was finally deter-
mined that at the age of 35 he suffered 
from a rare autoimmune disease. After 
new symptoms presented and Heath’s 
condition 
deteriorated, 
his 
family 
learned Heath was stricken with an ex-
tremely rare form of lung cancer that, 
according to 20 oncologists, could have 
only been caused by prolonged inhala-
tion of concentrated toxic substances. 
Heath was eventually forced into a 
medical separation with his lung can-
cer being deemed 100 percent service 
connected by the Veterans Administra-
tion. His retirement documents specify 
that Heath was a recently retired com-
bat veteran. However, once he applied 
for comprehensive caregiver benefits, 
the VA denied him. They stated that 
although Heath Robinson’s lung cancer 
was 100 percent service connected, 
there was no evidence that his cancer 
was caused by burn pits or combat re-
lated. His wife, a doctor of physical 
therapy, had to take an unpaid leave of 
absence from a full-time job to handle 
her husband’s round-the-clock care. 
This service was paramount to this 
family, and the VA failed them. 
The final year of Heath’s life con-
sisted of his wife and her mom watch-
ing helplessly as Heath suffered in 
pain, struggling to breathe daily, and 
coughing incessantly. Many days were 
spent holding a basin under his face to 
catch vomit and blood streaming from

his nose while they shoved the oxygen 
tube into his mouth intermittently so 
he wouldn’t die. They lost count of the 
number of times he had to be rushed to 
the nearest emergency room only to be 
transferred to a trauma hospital be-
cause the doctors had no idea what to 
do with him. Doctors exclaimed that 
they had never seen a cancer like 
Heath had. 
The VA decided this American sol-
dier and war veteran didn’t qualify for 
caregiver benefits because his exposure 
to inhaling toxic burn pit smoke did 
not cause his lung cancer. The Robin-
son family suffered tremendously while 
earned benefits were withheld by the 
VA. 
The story of the Robinson family is 
one of many dating back years to the 
days of Agent Orange when other vet-
erans suffered the same fate. When vet-
erans seek treatment related to burn 
pit exposure, my amendment requires 
the VA to report it to Congress. It de-
mands transparency and helps find pol-
icy solutions driven by large-scale data 
to get our veterans the care they need 
and that they have earned. We can do 
better to provide care for soldiers and 
family members, and we must provide 
safeguards and transparency to ensure 
that. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote 
on my amendment, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I claim the time in opposi-
tion, although I am not opposed. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the gentlewoman from Iowa 
is recognized for 5 minutes. 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I yield 
15 seconds to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. TAKANO), who is the chair-
man of the committee, for any com-
ments. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of Congressman RYAN’s bi-
partisan amendment. 
Let me just say that the PACT Act is 
something that this Congress must do, 
and the Republican substitute is sim-
ply what we, this Congress, can get 
away with. We cannot simply rest on 
what we can get away with. 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I urge a 
‘‘yes’’ vote, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield back the balance of

MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT 
A message in writing from the Presi-
dent of the United States was commu-
nicated to the House by Mr. Adrian 
Swann, one of his secretaries. 
f 
MOMENT OF SILENCE HONORING 
VICTIMS 
OF 
THE 
CARTERET 
COUNTY PLANE CRASH 
(Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, on Sunday, February 13, a 
catastrophic tragedy took place in a 
close-knit eastern North Carolina com-
munity. 
A small plane carrying eight pas-
sengers, 
including 
four 
teenagers, 
crashed into the Atlantic Ocean about 
4 miles east of the Drum Inlet. Trag-
ically, all eight North Carolinians per-
ished in the crash. 
There are no words to describe the 
pain and devastation that our commu-
nity has felt in the weeks following 
this tragic accident. Yet, through this 
heartbreak we have all been moved by 
the outpouring of love and support 
from all of those across North Carolina 
and our great Nation. 
We cannot thank our first respond-
ers, U.S. Coast Guard, the Carteret 
County Sheriff’s Office, State agencies, 
and community members enough for 
coming together in support of the fami-
lies impacted by this heartbreaking 
tragedy. 
Members of our community have par-
ticipated in many loving tributes to 
honor those we lost. I am grateful to 
the volunteers, ministers, students, 
teachers, 
parents, 
grandparents, 
friends, and classmates who are helping 
to provide aid and support, as well as 
comfort to our Down East residents. 
Their selflessness and commitment to 
others is to be commended, and I honor 
their service. 
We will always remember the beloved 
North Carolinians whom we lost: Doug-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1285 
March 3, 2022 
Mr. Speaker, I respectfully ask for a 
moment of silence to remember those 
who perished on that fateful day. 
f 
LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM 
(Mr. SCALISE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I rise for 
the purpose of inquiring of the major-
ity leader the schedule for next week. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Maryland (Mr. HOYER), the major-
ity leader of the House. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
On Monday, Mr. Speaker, the House 
will meet at 12 p.m. for morning-hour 
debate, and 2 p.m. for legislative busi-
ness, with votes postponed until 6:30 
p.m. 
On Tuesday, the House will meet at 
10 a.m. for morning-hour and 12 p.m. 
for legislative business. 
On Wednesday, the House will meet 
at 9 a.m. for legislative business. 
The House will consider an omnibus 
appropriations package so the House 
and Senate can both pass it before 
March 11. As the Republican minority 
whip knows, on March 11 at 12 o’clock, 
if we have not passed additional au-
thorization for the funding of the gov-
ernment, the government will shut 
down. It is imperative that we act. 
In light of the fact that many of us 
on the Democratic side of the aisle will 
be going to Philadelphia for a legisla-
tive retreat on the Wednesday pre-
ceding March 11, March 9, we need to 
act by that time and send something to 
the Senate. I hope we can do that. 
The House will also consider H. Con. 
Res. 70, condemning threats of violence 
against historically Black colleges and 
universities—too many of which we 
have seen in recent weeks—and re-
affirming support of HBCUs and their 
students, introduced by Representative 
ALMA ADAMS. That will be considered 
under suspension of the rules. 
The House will also consider other 
bills under suspension of the rules. A 
complete list of suspension bills will be 
announced by the close of business to-
morrow. Additional legislative items, 
of course, are possible. 
I want to say that, clearly, one of the 
principal focuses that we have is the 
onslaught and criminal behavior led by 
Vladimir Putin, which is occurring in 
Ukraine. The President spoke to the 
country and to us on Tuesday in the 
State of the Union message, in which 
he made it clear that we need to be 
unified. In fact, we passed a resolution 
in which—for the most part, save three 
of our Members—we were unified. 
Mr. Speaker, I would hope that we 
would remain unified in the face of 
what is the breaking of international 
law and could be called a genocide of 
the Ukrainian people by Vladimir 
Putin. I am hopeful that we will re-
main unified and focused on that issue 
as we proceed. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I share 
the gentleman’s expression of unified 
support with the people of Ukraine. 
Clearly, we stand with the heroic peo-
ple of Ukraine, President Zelensky, and 
the inspiration he has been showing to 
the world, and the strong people of 
Ukraine. 
What we are seeing from Russia is 
barbaric. One of my colleagues, Rep-
resentative SPARTZ, who actually was 
born in Ukraine, she has been very out-
spoken about the genocide that is hap-
pening to the people of Ukraine. As the 
gentleman mentioned, the resolution 
that we passed with Mr. MEEKS and 
Mrs. SPARTZ, it was bipartisan, and an 
overwhelming vote of support standing 
with the people of Ukraine. 
Clearly, they have asked for a num-
ber of very specific things: some mili-
tary equipment, supplies, as well as hu-
manitarian relief. We need to continue 
to push as hard as we can to make sure 
it is delivered as expeditiously as pos-
sible as we watch continuous barbaric 
attacks, raids, bombing, carpet bomb-
ing, cluster bombs, things that are ille-
gal under international law, yet Putin 
continues to commit these barbaric 
crimes against the people of Ukraine. 
They are tough people, and they are 
not going to give up their country. We 
need to do everything we can to help 
them. 
One other thing that was mentioned 
in this resolution because people, obvi-
ously, want to know what they can do. 
There are a number of steps that are 
being taken and there are other steps 
that we would also like to see this Con-
gress take. In the resolution there were 
two provisions specifically that I want-
ed to bring up. 
One of the resolution requests was 
that we—the United States Congress— 
pledge support working with Europe 
and international partners to bolster 
Europe’s energy security and reduce its 
dependence on Russian energy imports. 
The resolution that we passed also 
goes on to say: We resolve that we un-
derscore the importance of maintain-
ing United States’ energy independence 
for the benefit of the American people 
and United States’ allies. With that 
there was a piece of legislation that 
was just filed earlier this week to do 
just that. H.R. 6858, offered by Mrs. 
MCMORRIS
RODGERS
and 
Mr. 
WESTERMAN, the ranking members of 
the Energy and Commerce Committee 
and the Natural Resources Committee, 
goes to the heart of what we can do as 
a country and as a Congress to take le-
verage away from Vladimir Putin as it 
relates to energy. 
We can all see over the years how Eu-
rope has become very dependent on 
Russian energy. They, unfortunately, 
get over 40 percent of their oil from 
Russia. This is also putting billions of 
dollars in the pocket of Vladimir 
Putin. When you look at the price of 
oil today, over $110 a barrel, just look 
at the daily benefit that that gives to 
Vladimir Putin. He is making over $700 
million every single day selling oil to 
the United States and Europe. Think 
about that. 
Vladimir Putin is pocketing today 
over $700 million, and he is going to get 
another $700 million tomorrow and an-
other the day after by selling his oil to 
the United States and to Europe. There 
are things we can do to stop that. That 
is what H.R. 6858 goes to the heart of. 
Some of those things are very specific. 
President Biden, just a few weeks 
ago, put a complete freeze on all oil 
and gas projects in America. All oil and 
gas projects. That means we are not al-
lowing the United States to provide for 
the resources of our country and our 
allies. We used to be exporting oil to 
our allies around the world, it is be-
coming harder to do that because those 
policies by President Biden are shut-
ting off American energy, and at the 
same time President Biden was asking 
Vladimir Putin to produce more oil for 
us. 
There is no reason we should be ask-
ing Russia to do what we in America 
can do, yet that is a policy that was 
put in place. President Biden can re-
verse that today. I have called on 
President Biden to reverse all of these 
specific actions today. This legislation 
would at least show that Congress is 
ready to allow ourselves to be energy 
independent so that we can take that 
leverage away from Putin. We can take 
that $700 million away from Putin. 
b 1115 
Obviously, there are a number of 
other things, just permits for things 
like LNG—natural gas—Putin is sup-
plying a tremendous amount of natural 
gas to Europe. There are six projects 
right now sitting on the Biden adminis-
tration’s desk to approve LNG permit 
applications for major projects, multi-
billion-dollar, 
private-sector-funded 
projects in America to allow us to ship 
natural gas to our European allies so 
they don’t need to get it from Putin. 
Not one of those permits has been ap-
proved in over a year. 
Same thing, permits for pipelines. It 
is not just the Keystone pipeline. There 
are many other pipeline projects in-
cluding two States in the Northeast. In 
the United States, States like Massa-
chusetts are importing their oil from 
Vladimir Putin because they can’t get 
it through pipelines in America. This 
opens that up. 
It does a number of other things to 
allow America to become energy inde-
pendent, but, more importantly, to 
take the leverage away from Vladimir 
Putin that he has today that he is 
using to pocket over $700 million a day 
by selling his energy to us and Europe. 
I would love to see that bill on the 
floor, and I think a lot of other people 
would, too, to send a message to Putin 
that we are not going to be a part of 
helping him finance this barbaric war 
on Ukraine. 
Mr. Speaker, I would ask the gen-
tleman if we could look at bringing 
H.R. 6858 to the floor, have a full de-
bate, and pass a strong piece of legisla-
tion that would send a signal to our

friends around the world, surely to the 
people of Ukraine, but also to Vladimir 
Putin that he is not going to be able to 
finance his war off the backs of oil he 
is selling to the United States and Eu-
rope and using that against the people 
of Ukraine. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to gentleman. 
Mr. HOYER. As I said, I hope we can 
be unified and seek to pursue that 
which unifies us. If we did everything 
that the gentleman suggests is in that 
bill, it would not make an immediate 
difference, and the gentleman knows 
that. The gentleman knows that there 
are literally millions of acres available 
for additional pumping, oil rigs to be 
arrayed both offshore and onshore. The 
gentleman knows we just released 300 
million barrels from the Strategic Pe-
troleum Reserve. 
Mr. SCALISE. Thirty million, I be-
lieve it is. 
Mr. HOYER. Excuse me. Thirty mil-
lion. 
So this administration has taken ac-
tions immediately to assist the Euro-
peans. In addition, of course, the Euro-
peans have done something. As the 
gentleman knows in terms of reliance, 
the Germans, in a very difficult polit-
ical decision for them, have canceled 
any further actions dealing with re-
ceiving energy through a pipeline in 
Germany known as Nord Stream 2. 
He knows further that there is con-
sideration to reactivate or to not de-
commission nuclear plants which pro-
vide not only clean energy but abun-
dant energy. In my part of the world in 
a southern Maryland district that I 
represent, we have a nuclear power 
plant that produces clean energy for us 
in abundance. Very frankly, I have 
heard this argument when we had re-
cession; I have heard this argument 
when we had the stock market go 
down, and the stock market go up. We 
are producing more energy than any 
other country on Earth right now. We 
are exporting energy right now. 
Now, the issue as to whether or not— 
we have a relatively small sector, but 
the gentleman is correct, we are re-
ceiving oil in some jurisdictions from 
Russia—as to whether we ought to con-
tinue that, I think that is a valid argu-
ment, and we ought to pursue it. 
But I want to say to the gentleman 
very, very frankly that we need to be 
focused on what we have done and what 
we are doing. NATO is unified. NATO is 
taking unified action. All the nations 
of NATO are taking actions both with 
respect to stopping any benefits to 
Russia which may facilitate the fund-
ing of their operations. We have taken 
very, very substantial sanctions, as 
you know, and we have cut off the Rus-
sian central bank which freezes Putin’s 
strategic reserve funds. He had $600 bil-
lion that he was relying on that he 
called the ‘‘war fund’’. 
We have imposed full sanctions on 
Russia’s other major financial institu-
tions, state-owned enterprises critical 
to its economy. We have removed Rus-
sian banks from SWIFT, an action that 
nobody thought the Europeans would 
join us in, but they have. We have se-
cured new export controls to cut off 
Russia’s access to tech inputs, includ-
ing microchips. We have frozen the as-
sets of Putin and oligarchs close to him 
and launched a task force to hunt down 
and freeze more of their wealth. We 
have stopped the Nord Stream 2 pipe-
line that I talked about which would 
have made Germany and some of Eu-
rope even more dependent on energy 
from Russia. 
Again, some months ago, nobody 
would have thought that was possible. 
President Biden has achieved that. 
We have done $1 billion in security 
assistance to Ukraine over the past 
year—a massive increase over past ad-
ministrations—and 
have 
also 
an-
nounced a $1 billion sovereign loan 
guaranty to shore up Ukraine’s econ-
omy. 
America, essentially, is energy inde-
pendent. As I said, we are exporting en-
ergy. If we didn’t export energy, we 
may be fully independent. Having said 
that, the gentleman comes from an 
area of the country that refines some 
of the kind of oil we get from Russia, 
heavy crude, as the gentleman knows 
much better than I do because he is 
very, very familiar with that industry. 
Energy is important. We believe as 
well that assuring energy that is not 
damaging to our global health is also 
important. I would be for not buying 
any oil from Russia. Then what would 
happen is—and may happen yet—is the 
price of oil would go up. The gentleman 
knows that. And then the gentleman 
would rise and say to me: How can you 
possibly allow prices to be where they 
are? 
I want to honestly tell the American 
people that we are not sending troops. 
We will not have people on the front 
lines. But we will pay a cost to take 
the actions that the President has cou-
rageously taken and that President 
Zelensky has courageously taken to de-
fend Ukraine’s freedom. We will pay a 
cost. 
So the President is trying to balance 
that with doing what needs to be done. 
I, frankly, think he is doing what needs 
to be done, and I am very proud of the 
fact that, as I said yesterday, we joined 
together in a bipartisan way to support 
the Ukrainian people. 
We have differences of opinion on en-
ergy policy. For the most part, I think 
many of your Members don’t believe 
global warming is the threat that we 
believe it is on this side of the aisle. So 
we have differences of agreement on 
energy. But what we don’t have dif-
ferences of opinion on, I hope, is that 
we ought to decrease to the extent we 
possibly can any economic benefits to 
Putin—not the Russian people, but to 
Putin and the war machine that he has 
put in place, and, as you and I have 
agreed, killing Ukrainians unprovoked, 
unjustified, and illegal under inter-
national law. So that is the real issue 
we ought to be focused on. 
Yes, we ought to continue to have a 
fulsome debate on energy policy—very, 
very important. But I will tell the gen-
tleman, as I said before, there are mil-
lions 
of 
acres—millions—currently 
available to produce more energy in 
this country. 
The gentleman’s party was in charge 
for a long period of time of both the 
House, Senate, and the Presidency 
under President Trump, and essentially 
the policies that the gentleman—I 
don’t know all the policies in that bill, 
obviously, I haven’t read that bill— 
that could have been affected during 
that period of time. 
So the bottom line is, the gentleman 
is correct. We need to make sure that 
Putin pays a horrific price and that we 
substantially reduce the resources he 
has available to perpetrate this inter-
national crime. And in the process, we 
ought to remember that this Congress 
appropriated over $400 million some 
years ago to help Ukraine, and Presi-
dent Trump held that money hostage, 
urging Mr. Zelensky to see if he could 
get dirt on President Biden. President 
Trump has recently said how brilliant 
he thinks Mr. Putin is and that our 
President is dumb. That doesn’t reflect 
unity. That doesn’t reflect a country 
that is together to confront an enemy. 
That undermines our democracy. 
Mr. Pompeo has also said he thinks 
Putin is brilliant. I think Putin is an 
international criminal. He says he is 
very shrewd and very capable. There 
are many dictators and tyrants of the 
world that you can say that about. He 
didn’t say he was a criminal—I am 
talking about Pompeo and Trump—or 
that he was committing a genocide, as 
you and I have said. Those were not 
words that either the former of Sec-
retary of State or the former President 
of the United States used just recently 
after the invasion. 
So I say to my friend very sincerely: 
We have differences of views on energy. 
We don’t have difference of views, how-
ever, on diminishing very radically any 
resources which Putin could rely on to 
perpetrate his unjustified and criminal 
invasion of a sovereign country who 
has shown no threat to Russia or the 
Russian people. 
At some point in time we will con-
tinue this argument about drilling and 
production of more oil. We will con-
tinue, I think, to try to be unified on 
the issue at hand. America’s unity ex-
pressed to the rest of the world will 
give the Ukrainians, I think, more con-
fidence and give NATO more con-
fidence. And I might say when I men-
tioned that NATO has taken extraor-
dinary steps, President Biden, unlike 
his predecessor, created respect and 
unity among the NATO allies. Ger-
many, in particular, on Nord Stream 2, 
the former President uniformly de-
meaned Ms. Merkel and the Chancellor 
of Germany, and our relations with 
Germany were very strained. President 
Biden has put those together—criti-
cally important in facing Putin down 
at this point in time. 
As General Milley said in our brief-
ing—this was not classified—he said he

thought Russia was going to lose in the 
end—or at least Putin was going to 
lose. 
The Russian people do not want this 
war. The Russian people do not feel 
threatened by Ukraine. 
Putin wants to create empire, and 
that is what I think we ought to stay 
focused on and unified on. We will de-
bate energy policy, but let us not de-
ceive the American public that any 
policies of this administration have un-
dermined the ability to drill and 
produce additional energy on those 
millions of acres that are available on 
public lands and in public waters right 
now. Right now. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, there are 
many areas where we have been unified 
in our response to Ukraine, but it is 
not unifying to say leave Russia’s oil 
off the table in terms of sanctions. 
That was left out by President Biden. 
When he issued sanctions he specifi-
cally exempted Russia’s oil, and that is 
not unifying. There are a lot of people 
who are angry about that because we 
are watching the amount of money 
that Putin is putting in his pocket 
every day, and he is using that money. 
So you take other sanctions, you 
take other things off the table, the 
banking system might be hit hard, ex-
cept if he is able to put $700 million— 
and it is probably closer to $1 billion a 
day now with this higher price of oil 
because of what he has done and be-
cause of what our country has done to 
take energy off the table. 
Mr. HOYER. Will the gentleman 
yield so I can clarify? 
Mr. SCALISE. I yield to the gen-
tleman from Maryland. 
Mr. HOYER. I do not believe energy 
ought to be taken off the table. I want 
to assure my friend that is not my po-
sition, nor is it our collective position 
as a party. I understand what the gen-
tleman said. I agree with the gen-
tleman that to the extent that we can 
decrease any—any—underline any—re-
sources available to Putin and his war 
machine, we ought to do it. 
b 1130 
Mr. SCALISE. I appreciate that clari-
fication because it is in President 
Biden’s set of sanctions that he specifi-
cally exempted energy. Clearly, that is 
not unifying, even to us. 
But it is the money that is still al-
lowed to be flowing into Russia, into 
Putin’s pocket, to finance the war that 
many of us want to get at. 
If H.R. 6858, after the gentleman 
looks at it, has some provisions that 
we could work on, I think it would be 
very unifying to the country to say we 
are finally going to confront what 
might be Vladimir Putin’s largest 
source of funding, and that is his oil 
exports to the United States. It offends 
many, many people that, today, we are 
getting over 100,000 barrels every single 
day from Russia because we took 
things like the Keystone pipeline off 
the table. 
That would have brought us oil from 
Canada. Canada is a friend, by the way. 
And it is not like the need and the de-
mand just went away. The demand is 
still there. 
President Biden said no, we don’t 
want Canadian oil. But it wasn’t be-
cause he didn’t want any oil. He didn’t 
say no, we don’t want any pipelines. He 
just said no to the Canada-to-America 
pipeline, but he said yes to the Nord 
Stream 2, initially. But he also said to 
Vladimir Putin: Would you produce 
more oil? 
And let’s keep in mind—I know there 
is this conversation about the planet. 
Let’s be honest about carbon emis-
sions. Carbon is emitted all around the 
globe. So if we shut down production in 
America, which has been done—and it 
is not just on Federal lands where the 
President is not issuing permits. He 
put a freeze just 2 weeks ago on all new 
permits. 
But it is also the banking system 
that he is using to go after oil and gas 
companies, so there is no investment 
being made in America. They are mak-
ing investments, billions of dollars of 
investment, in other countries. They 
are just not making it here in America 
because of those policies. 
Again, that just gives more leverage 
to Putin. We were paying less than $2 
per gallon under President Trump. I 
know the gentleman wanted to bring 
up President Trump. 
President Trump stood up to Putin, 
by the way. You didn’t see an invasion 
anywhere in Ukraine under President 
Trump. You surely did under President 
Obama and Vice President Biden when 
Putin walked in and took Crimea with 
no 
consequence. 
Afghanistan, 
the 
weakness that was being showed clear-
ly was being watched by Putin and Xi 
and other adversaries as a preface to 
then go and start marshaling troops on 
the Ukraine border. 
President Trump didn’t let that hap-
pen. He stood up to Putin and pushed 
back on Putin. He also used energy as 
a weapon against our enemies because 
we were producing enough to not only 
meet our needs but to export to our 
friends around the world. 
Surely, lower pricing was a benefit to 
Americans, but it also helped our allies 
around the world. That has been taken 
off the table. 
But let’s talk about the carbon emis-
sion side because oil is being produced. 
It is just that a lot of it isn’t being pro-
duced here that would otherwise be in 
the mix. 
So if you look at, for example, Rus-
sian oil, Russia emits probably 40 per-
cent more carbon to make the same oil 
that otherwise would be made in the 
United States because we have better 
standards in America. 
I know a lot of people love beating up 
on America. We do it better than any-
body else. Our technology is better 
than anybody else. In fact, our tech-
nology for producing energy is the 
envy of the world. It should be the 
model for the world because if we are 
not making it, Russia is going to be 
making it. 
Believe me, futures prices of oil have 
an impact on price today, which is 
why, when President Biden walked in 
and shut the spigots off in America— 
sure, there is production going on from 
previous leases that happened under 
previous 
administrations, 
including 
President Trump, that was driving the 
price down. But when he walked in day 
one and said no to the Keystone pipe-
line—in other words, no to Canada’s oil 
but yes to Russia’s oil—that had an im-
pact on price. 
When he said no to Federal drilling, 
which then he expanded to all drilling, 
any new permits—sure, the stuff that is 
going on out there is still going on, but 
there is no new investment being made 
in America. It is being made in other 
countries, including Russia, including 
OPEC nations. Because of that, they 
are able to control the price because 
they are cartels. 
We had literally taken the monopoly 
away from OPEC and Russia when we 
were producing enough and using the 
resources of this great Nation, by the 
way, in a much more energy efficient 
way than anywhere else in the world. 
We were reducing carbon emissions in 
America while producing our own en-
ergy, while manufacturing more in 
America. The more things are shut 
down here, they are being made in 
other places, and those other places 
emit more carbon. 
China is building a coal plant prob-
ably every single week. China emits 
more carbon, probably five times more 
carbon, to make many of the same 
things we make in America. 
So the less we make here, it is still 
being made; it is just being made in 
other countries. They get the jobs, but 
they also emit more carbon. So, as peo-
ple talk about carbon emissions, don’t 
leave that point out because it is an 
important point. 
Again, it was President Biden himself 
who asked Putin to produce more oil, 
just last year. The oil produced in Rus-
sia has a higher carbon price than 
made here in America. 
And it makes us less secure. It makes 
Putin more strong. It gives him hun-
dreds of millions of dollars a day that 
we can take off the table. 
I think that would be very unifying if 
we had that debate and said: Can we 
get an agreement on some of these pro-
visions that would actually strengthen 
our country? 
Even if Russian wasn’t invading 
Ukraine, it would be smart American 
policy. It would reduce carbon emis-
sions. But especially considering what 
is going on in Russia, this is much 
more pertinent today to have this dis-
cussion. Again, I think it can be uni-
fying. 
Just because right now we may not 
see eye to eye, I think there is a way to 
see eye to eye on this if we actually 
had that debate and looked at it from 
a global perspective, not just in a silo 
in America because, again, there is a 
global market for oil. Carbon emissions 
are global.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1288 
March 3, 2022 
The countries that are taking the 
things away that we are shutting down 
here in America emit more carbon. It 
is a fact. Why shouldn’t we be talking 
about that, too, and, frankly, taking 
away the leverage that Putin would 
have? 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Maryland. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
First of all, the Speaker just an-
nounced, minutes ago, she is opposed 
to importing any oil from Russia. So 
the comment I just made to the gen-
tleman, if you are trying to project 
that we want to see Russia advantaged 
by any expenditures we have on im-
ports, now the Speaker has said ex-
actly what I just said. We are not for 
that. Okay? 
There are 26 million acres right now 
available and unaffected, as I under-
stand it, by any of the constraints that 
you have talked about, available for 
additional drilling. There are 11 mil-
lion acres, so that is 37 million acres 
currently available for production of 
additional product in the United States 
of America, right now. 
So the red herring of somehow Presi-
dent Biden is constraining the produc-
tion of oil in this country, as I under-
stand it—now, you are much more 
aware of this because you come from a 
producing State and, obviously, are fo-
cused on this. 
But the fact of the matter is, I am 
told that these 37 million acres are un-
affected and are ready for production 
right now. 
Now, the debate we have, Mr. Whip, 
is about what kind of fuels we ought to 
be using. You talked a lot about carbon 
emissions. Scientists tell us that car-
bon emission is a danger. As a matter 
of fact, the Department of Defense, the 
Pentagon, testified when asked, ‘‘What 
is the greatest threat to America’s se-
curity?’’ some—I think it was last 
year; it may have been the year before 
that—said global warming. That is 
what they said. 
Right now, we have an immediate 
challenge. Nothing you suggest will af-
fect that immediate challenge beyond 
the Speaker and I both telling you we 
agree, and I hope the President pursues 
this: No money to Russia, period. No 
buying of Russian products. 
Now, the gentleman mentions that, 
oh, he urged Russia to produce more 
energy last year. Why did he urge that? 
He urged all OPEC nations to produce 
more energy. Why? Because he did not 
want Americans to pay more at the 
pump. I think that is a policy you 
would probably support, trying to keep 
prices down. 
With the oil cartel, when you con-
strain supply, what happens? Demand 
doesn’t diminish because people have 
to drive to work; they have to get their 
kids to school; they have to get home. 
Demand stays steady. 
What happens, inevitably, when sup-
ply is constrained and demand stays 
where it is or it goes up, prices rise. 
Yes, you are right, the President 
stands accused of trying to get more 
supply on the market to bring prices at 
the pump down. 
But we do have a fundamental dis-
agreement, and frankly, we ought not 
to be talking about it now. We had an 
energy bill that most of your side did 
not vote for. We get that. There is a le-
gitimate difference of opinion of where 
we ought to invest our dollars. We be-
lieve we ought to invest our dollars in 
renewable energy that will be there for 
some time and does not pollute our air, 
increase our heat, and make our 
storms worse for the safety of our 
globe and our people for decades and 
centuries to come. 
But, we do agree that we want to 
stop Putin. 
Now, the reason I pointed out Trump, 
because Trump didn’t stop Putin. He 
regaled Putin: He is my friend. I know 
him. We can get together. 
Putin is a thug. He is a criminal 
thug. He is an international criminal. I 
think we all agree on that. And it 
doesn’t help for the former President of 
the United States to tell the world I 
think their guy, this criminal, this 
thug, is smart, or in Pompeo’s words, 
brilliant and our guy is dumb. 
Our guy is not dumb. He is very 
smart. I have known him for 50 years. 
He may disagree on policy, but that is 
not because he is dumb. He has a dif-
ferent perspective. 
Very frankly, he is not withholding 
money from Zelensky. He is making 
sure Zelensky gets money. 
Trump tried to hold hostage money 
for Ukrainian security that we appro-
priated because we wanted early on to 
make sure that Zelensky and the 
Ukrainian people had the resources 
they 
needed. 
Mr. 
Trump 
withheld 
them. Now, ultimately, he paid them 
out, after it was disclosed—after it was 
disclosed. 
We are going to continue to differ on 
energy policy, but don’t mislead the 
American people when you have 37 mil-
lion acres available for additional pro-
duction unaffected by the restraints 
that you talk about. He is talking 
about new stuff. 
So, my friend, let’s focus, in this in-
stance, at this time of crisis, on how 
we can make sure that America is per-
ceived as unified and of one mind, as 
we did right after 9/11 and as we did 
yesterday. 
But we abandon that very quickly in 
this polarized society in which we are 
living. We need to be unified, and we 
need to be honest with the American 
people. It is not going to be cost-free 
because neither Biden—and Biden, by 
the way, is urging the Saudis to in-
crease production and others to in-
crease production. 
But as the gentleman knows, we far 
outstrip any of those nations in the 
production of energy and oil. China, a 
country that is three times, four times 
our size, four times our size, is pro-
ducing 25 percent of what we produce. 
America is producing a lot of energy. 
It did so under Obama. As the gen-
tleman knows, energy production in 
the country rose during the Obama 
years. It rose during the Trump years. 
And it still is at a high plateau. 
The only thing I would say to my 
friend, the whip: We have differences 
on energy policy. We ought to discuss 
those. That is an honest difference of 
opinion. I want to be energy inde-
pendent. 
I hope you heard the President talk 
about Make It In America. All of my 
colleagues rose and sort of pointed at 
me because I have been talking about 
making it America, which is producing 
energy as well, for a good period of 
time. I started the Make It In America 
agenda in 2010 and have been talking 
about it every year since. 
We need to be energy independent, 
and we can use energy as an element of 
foreign policy and strategic policy as 
well, which is why the Speaker said, 
just minutes ago, as I said to you, we 
ought not to be buying oil from Russia, 
period. 
Mr. SCALISE. As we talk about this 
energy policy difference, again, I do 
think it could be unifying. I do think 
we can get to a point where we recog-
nize some of the impediments that are 
real today. While the President says 
Make It In America, there are things 
that President Biden is doing that are 
blocking the ability for us to make it 
in America. 
Again, I have talked about some of 
the regulatory agencies that are mak-
ing it very hard even on some of those 
lands the gentleman references that 
could be open for production where 
they can’t because they reinstated 
some of the things like WOTUS and 
some of the other regulations that 
were removed so that States could look 
at the ability to permit applications 
where now they are not able to do that, 
where banking systems, through Treas-
ury, through the SEC, are blocking fi-
nancial institutions or bullying finan-
cial institutions to not allow invest-
ment by American banks into Amer-
ican production of energy. 
It is real. It is going on. It is a prob-
lem. And it is why many of those en-
ergy companies are making their bil-
lions of investments in other countries 
right now. 
b 1145 
Again, when you have John Kerry, 
the President’s global warming czar, 
just the other day saying he hopes Rus-
sia helps us with this. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, can the 
gentleman clarify when he says, ‘‘just 
the other day’’? 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, probably 
about 4 days ago, where he was talking 
about getting energy production ad-
dressed and some other things ad-
dressed. We shouldn’t have a strategy 
that involves Russia helping us right 
now or Putin helping us right now. 
So don’t give Vladimir Putin that le-
verage. He has leverage. While Nord 
Stream 
2 
is 
blocked 
today, 
Nord 
Stream 1, the original Nord Stream

pipeline, is still operating, providing 
over 40 percent of Germany’s energy. 
That was what President Trump was 
critical of Merkel about, why are you 
signing contracts that make your 
country more dependent on Russia? He 
said that verbatim. He was right back 
then. Germany probably wishes they 
wouldn’t have done it today because 
they were hamstrung in the beginning 
of this. They are now helping, but they 
are also dependent on Russian oil. 
We should be looking at things that 
we can do to not only wean ourselves 
off of Russian oil but our allies around 
the world. There are real specific 
things we can do and there are impedi-
ments in this country today that exist 
that are unnecessary, that are hurting 
our ability to shut down Russia’s abil-
ity to use energy as leverage. They are 
doing it right now. They are using it 
not only as leverage but as a financing 
source. Putin still is pocketing over 
$700 million a day by selling oil to Eu-
rope and America. 
If there are things that we can come 
to an agreement on that would address 
it, I think it would be important that 
we do it as fast as possible to take 
away those points so that Putin has to 
think twice about continuing what he 
is doing, this barbaric genocide that is 
happening in Ukraine. 
So just saying that while it might 
not be something we recognize as uni-
fying today, I think it could end up 
being something unifying in a short pe-
riod of time, if we can keep working 
through those differences. I would just 
encourage that we try to do that. 
If there is anything else on that, I 
would yield, but there is one other 
issue I wanted to raise as well. 
The Senate just a few days ago 
passed unanimously a resolution ask-
ing to open up the Capitol again to the 
American 
people, 
our 
constituents, 
who still are not able to come to the 
Capitol to visit with Members of Con-
gress, to sit in the gallery, to partici-
pate even in the State of the Union. It 
was a unanimous resolution in the Sen-
ate. 
There is a companion resolution by 
Congressman STEIL that was filed, H. 
Res. 961, that would do the same thing 
and express from the House side what 
the Senate just expressed, that it is 
time to open the Capitol to the public 
again. The Senate Republicans and 
Democrats came to an agreement to do 
it. I would just ask that we do the same 
and show the American people that the 
people’s House is open to the people of 
the Nation. If the Senate can come to 
an agreement on it—again, I don’t 
think there is anything controversial 
in the resolution, but I would ask that 
we would bring that up as well. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for that question. The 
answer to it is the Office of the Attend-
ing Physician and the Sergeants at 
Arms in both the Senate and the House 
are looking at that, both from a health 
standpoint and from a security stand-
point. 
I think all of us agree that the Amer-
ican public’s access to the Capitol 
ought to be as fulsome as possible, 
given constraints of health concerns 
and of security concerns. So I join the 
gentleman in saying, as I have said to 
the press, as soon as we can do that re-
sponsibly, we ought to do it. I agree 
with the gentleman. 
I want to add something that is of 
great concern to me. I hope we have 
agreement in this House, and I hope we 
have agreement in the United States 
Senate. I have been shocked, deeply 
saddened, when your party passes a 
resolution and tells the American peo-
ple that January 6 was legitimate po-
litical discourse. 
If we are telling people in this coun-
try that January 6 was legitimate po-
litical discourse, we are going to have 
great concerns about opening up this 
Capitol for the safety of our Members, 
for the safety of the public who wants 
to visit, and for the safety of our staff. 
I would ask my friend; does he be-
lieve that January 6 reflected legiti-
mate political discourse? 
I was shocked, astounded, that a 
major political party in this country 
would tell the American people what 
they saw on January 6 was legitimate 
political discourse. 
Will he please reject that concept, re-
ject that conclusion, that what they 
saw on January 6 had anything to do 
with legitimate political discourse. 
Yes, I want to open up the Capitol, 
but I don’t want to make any represen-
tation to the American people, Mr. 
Speaker, that what happened on Janu-
ary 6 bore any resemblance to what we 
as Americans believe is legitimate po-
litical discourse. 
Rightfully, Senator MCCONNELL and 
former candidate for President of the 
United States, MITT ROMNEY, rejected 
that out of hand. I would hope you and 
your party would do so on this floor 
and tell the American people, yes, we 
want to open up this Capitol, but do 
not delude yourself that anything you 
saw on January 6 bears any resem-
blance in any way to legitimate polit-
ical discourse. 
I had not brought that up, but I am 
constrained to do so as we talk about 
opening up our Capitol. 
Tuesday night, we were an armed 
camp. You saw it, I saw it, we all saw 
it, the fence around the Capitol, men 
and women with automatic weapons, 
both military and civilian, because of 
what happened on January 6, because 
of the concern they had for the safety 
of our democracy and of the ability of 
the President of the United States to 
come and give a State of the Union ad-
dress to the assembled Members of the 
Congress of the United States and the 
United States Senate. That is why all 
of that was there. 
Very frankly, inexplicably, the Re-
publican Party’s national committee 
passed a resolution, apparently over-
whelmingly, that told the American 
people that January 6 was legitimate 
political discourse. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, first of 
all, I have been very clear from the 
very beginning, anyone who broke into 
this Capitol ought to be held account-
able and is being held accountable. 
More arrests have been made than 
probably all of the cities where people 
were burning down cities across Amer-
ica in the summer. That is something 
that ought to be addressed, and the 
Democratic Party doesn’t want to talk 
about that. They just want to talk 
about January 6. 
These resolutions are not about Jan-
uary 6. It is allowing the American 
people to exercise their First Amend-
ment right to come and meet with 
their Members of Congress, which they 
are not able to do right now. 
If you look at that resolution, the 
head of the RNC even came out and 
said that is not what they were refer-
ring to, what the gentleman just al-
luded to. They said they were talking 
about the people who weren’t even in 
the District of Columbia on January 6 
who are being targeted right now. That 
is what they said that they were doing. 
Go take that up with them. 
I have been clear about what has hap-
pened to the people who broke into this 
Capitol and that everybody who breaks 
the law ought to be held accountable, 
not just the people who broke in here 
on January 6, but also people who 
burned the cities down over the sum-
mer of 2020 who haven’t been held ac-
countable. That is something that an-
gers people all over the country. They 
want to see the law equally carried out 
for people who broke the law, no mat-
ter where they were, here or in cities 
across America. 
If you want to criticize one side of it, 
at least be willing to criticize the other 
side of it, too. I surely have. I haven’t 
heard it from the other side. I would be 
more than happy to hear the gen-
tleman talk about people who were 
shooting at cops, killed cops, beat up 
people in streets, burned down police 
stations, government buildings in cit-
ies, took over cities, and haven’t been 
held accountable. Shouldn’t they also 
be held accountable? I say both should 
be held accountable. Does the gen-
tleman agree with that? 
And I yield to the gentleman. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, the equiva-
lency that my friend from Louisiana 
tries to make between citizens, some 
who committed crimes, but citizens 
who are acting because they are seeing 
their children’s lives taken because of 
the color of their skin and what hap-
pened on January 6 to undermine our 
democracy, our Constitution, and our 
election of a President of the United 
States, reflects the resolution the Re-
publican National Committee passed, 
legitimate political discourse. 
They weren’t talking about the peo-
ple—some people saw, obviously, the 
President incite those people to come 
from where that political discourse, 
that discussion—which sounded like in-
citement to me, maybe not to you—and

March 3, 2022 
they came from the White House, at 
the President’s instruction, Mr. Speak-
er: Go down to the Capitol, stop the 
steal, give them hell, fight like hell. 
Instructing the Vice President of the 
United States to do what the Vice 
President of the United States con-
cluded was illegal, not within his 
power, and they came into the Capitol 
calling for the life of the Vice Presi-
dent and the Speaker of this House. 
There is no equivalency. But they 
continue, Mr. Speaker, to make that 
equivalency, to justify what was done 
on January 6, that, oh, well, everybody 
does it. No, they don’t. It is the first 
time in history that it has happened. 
The whip and I are talking about 
what I think we both want to do, open 
up this Capitol, make it more acces-
sible, have people come in, gun free, 
weapon free—come into this Capitol 
and see their democracy in action. 
That resolution was read by the Amer-
ican people as, oh, it is okay, legiti-
mate 
political—there 
was 
nothing 
about January 6 that was legitimate 
political discourse, including what the 
President of the United States had to 
say, at that point in time, Donald 
Trump. That wasn’t legitimate at all. 
Sixty courts determined Joe Biden 
was elected. He still, to this day, lies to 
the American people. Sadly, too many 
people believe him, which led to Janu-
ary 6 and the violence. I am sure that 
the whip believes they ought to be held 
accountable if they came in here and 
waved guns at people and killed a po-
lice officer. I appreciate that he said 
that. 
If he believes, as ROMNEY believes, as 
MCCONNELL
believes—MCCONNELL 
didn’t say they were talking about the 
people talking in political discourse, 
should we do this, should we do that. 
MCCONNELL responded to that resolu-
tion exactly as I have, understanding 
exactly what it meant, inexplicable. 
Very frankly, if we are going to open 
up this Capitol, we need all of us to tell 
every American we are opening up the 
Capitol to peaceful—sure, political dis-
cussion; that is what this place is all 
about. That, Mr. Speaker, is what this 
discourse is about, differences of opin-
ion, how we resolve them, how we 
reach consensus, how we hopefully 
bring people together. But not by wav-
ing racist flags, not by hanging a gal-
lows in front of the Capitol. That is not 
how we do it. 
We ought to all, all 435 of us, reject it 
out of hand. We should not in any way 
try to make it look like, well, some 
other people did this, and some other 
people did that, and, therefore, it is 
okay. 
They attacked our democracy, our 
Constitution, this country. They were 
traitors. We ought to all reject that 
kind of conduct out of hand, not try to 
rationalize it with some other group 
did this and some other group did that, 
people with grievances. 
The Constitution does not guarantee 
being able to shoot at people, police or 
nonpolice. It doesn’t justify destroying 
property. That is criminal activity. I 
agree with that 100 percent. And no 
city was burned down. A little bit of 
hyperbole there, Mr. Speaker. 
b 1200 
Were 
there 
things 
done 
that 
shouldn’t have been done? Yes. Were 
there things that shouldn’t have been 
done and things that happened on this 
Capitol? Yes. 
But January 6 was not analogous to 
any of those things. It was an attempt 
to undermine our democracy, our Con-
stitution, and the election of the Presi-
dent of the United States by this Con-
gress in approving what we should have 
no discretion in one way or the other. 
That is what lawfully is done in each 
State when they send their electors 
here. 
What President Trump kept asking 
Mr. Pence to do was ignore the votes of 
the American people, ignore the law-
fully elected electors and the result of 
their deliberations. 
Mr. SCALISE is my friend. He is a 
good man. A famous quote says that 
nothing is necessary for the spread of 
evil but that good men do nothing. And 
that is why I tell my friend I was so ap-
palled at the rhetoric of that Repub-
lican National Committee resolution 
and what it says to people around this 
country who may have a grievance, 
who may be angry. 
As Senator MCCONNELL interpreted 
it, the resolution was speaking to what 
happened on January 6, whether it was 
at the White House and incitement, 
whether it was at the White House and 
deployment, or whether it was here in 
execution of what was clearly a coordi-
nated effort to prohibit the Congress 
from carrying out its constitutional 
duties. Expressed and acted out. 
So I say to my friend in conclusion, 
I didn’t mean to get into this today, 
but your questions obviously spurred 
my feeling about this because, yes, we 
want to open up the Capitol, but I don’t 
want to give any citizen the thought 
that the Capitol is being opened so 
they can come in here, threaten the 
lives of a Vice President, threaten the 
lives of a Speaker, threaten the lives of 
the minority leader or the Republican 
whip or any others of us. 
Mr. Speaker, the Republican whip is 
my friend. He was badly injured by a 
criminal who may have been deranged 
or whatever, but no excuse, who at-
tacked him because he was a Repub-
lican. Totally unjustified. Totally hei-
nous in its execution. The whip has 
shown 
extraordinary 
courage, 
Mr. 
Speaker, in coming back. I know it has 
been hard. It has been tough for him, 
and all of us admire him for the cour-
age he has shown in coming back, and 
we condemn in the severest terms any 
kind of action that would have put him 
or any other of our Members, our staff, 
or the visitors to this Capitol at risk. 
We are considering it. We want to 
open it up. The American people ought 
to have access to their Capitol. 
Mr. SCALISE. Just again, we con-
demn violence of all kinds: Political vi-
olence, people that just commit vio-
lence because they want to or they 
think they can get away with it or 
they think somebody will bail them 
out if they do it. But we should do it 
across the board, and the punishment 
fits the crime. The laws are on the 
books. It is the prosecutors who go 
after the people, and they are in some 
instances. It should be in all instances. 
I will continue to call it out on both 
sides. I would hope on the other side we 
hear that as well, not just when they 
see it in one place, but when they see 
it in all places, and I would hope we 
would open up the people’s House and 
get the Capitol back open to the Amer-
ican people who want to and have a 
right to come and express their views 
on issues. 
They might want to send an email, 
they might want to make a phone call, 
but they also might want to go to the 
office and sign that log book and try to 
sit down either with the Member of 
Congress or their staff to convey their 
feelings, and we just hope that hap-
pens. Again, the Senate unanimously 
said they want that to happen. I would 
hope the House would do it, too. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
f 
CLIMATE CHANGE REQUIRES 
ACTION 
(Mr. CASTEN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CASTEN. Mr. Speaker, ‘‘climate 
change effects are outpacing our abil-
ity to adapt.’’ That is from the recent 
IPCC report. 
Here is what that means in America 
in 2022: 
We have coastal communities where 
flooding has washed out roads before 
the bond used to pay for that road was 
fully paid off. 
We have mayors with no budget for 
seawalls who are being forced to tell 
their constituents that the only solu-
tion is for them to abandon their 
homes and their businesses and relo-
cate to higher ground. 
NOAA reported recently that sea lev-
els in Florida will be 18 inches higher 
by 2050. What that means is that there 
are properties in Florida today that 
will be underwater before their 30-year

that their town can’t connect them

know what measures are necessary to 
protect American families from that

When you ignore the laws of physics, 
you put taxpayer dollars at risk; you

CONGRATULATING GREG BURKOT 
ON HIS RETIREMENT 
(Mr. GUTHRIE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the service of my friend 
and district office staffer Greg Burkot. 
A proud Bardstown resident, Greg 
served the Second District as a field 
representative from 2009 to 2021. He 
represented my office in Edmonson, 
Hart, LaRue, Meade, and Nelson Coun-
ties and was a key liaison to constitu-
ents in those communities. 
Greg and his wife, Paula, have two 
daughters, the apple of his eyes, Re-
becca and Allyson, with their hus-
bands, and their three grandchildren. 
They are also active in their commu-
nity and church. 
I will miss Greg’s welcoming person-
ality, and I thank him for his service 
to the Second District and the Com-
monwealth. 
I wish Greg the best on his retire-
ment, and I hope he and Paula enjoy 
this next chapter of their lives as par-
ents and grandparents and as retirees.

CONGRATULATING BRUBAKER 
FARMS 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratu-
late the Brubaker family from Lan-
caster County, Pennsylvania, owners 
and operators of Brubaker Farms, as 
they celebrate the notable Pennsyl-
vania Leopold Conservation Award. 
This award is given in honor of the 
world-renowned conservationist Aldo 
Leopold, who many consider being the 
father of wildlife ecology and a devout 
conservationist. 
The Pennsylvania Leopold Conserva-
tion Award recognizes Pennsylvania 
farmers, ranchers, and foresters who 
inspire others with their dedication to 
land, water, and wildlife habitat re-
sources in their care. 
America’s farmers, ranchers, and for-
esters are the original conservation-
ists, and the Brubaker family is no ex-
ception. 
The Brubaker Farm is a 1,200-cow 
dairy run by Luke Brubaker and his 
sons, Mike and Tony. They use an as-
sortment of conservation practices to 
farm the acres, to feed their herd, in-
cluding 
no-till 
farming 
and 
cover 
crops. 
Additionally, the Brubakers fenced 
cattle away from streams and planted 
trees in 15 acres of riparian buffers, al-
lowing deer, turtles, and waterfowl in 
the area to thrive. 
Mr. Speaker, the Brubaker family 
has a longstanding history of being 
true stewards of the earth, and their 
continual commitment and dedication 
to conservation while remaining com-
petitive in the dairy industry is a note-
worthy feat. 
Once again, I want to congratulate 
the Brubaker family on this well-de-
served accomplishment, and I look for-
ward to seeing what the future holds 
for this family-owned farm.

REMEMBERING JONES WEBB 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to honor the life of a 
great man, Mr. Jones Webb. Jones was 
a fellow Young Harris College graduate 
with an innate love and passion for the 
college. 
Young Harris ran in Jones’ blood, as 
his grandfather owned a store and 
rooming house for male students at the 
college. His father attended Young 
Harris Academy and Young Harris Col-
lege, where he graduated in 1916 and 
was the editor of the college’s first 
yearbook. 
Jones was a dedicated servant to the 
college and served his many years on 
the Academic Affairs Committee, Exec-
utive Committee, Planned Giving Com-
mittee, and the Properties Committee. 
He spent 35 years on the Young Har-
ris College Board of Trustees before 
being elevated to emeritus trustee sta-
tus in 2013. Additionally, Jones spent 
time as the secretary of the board for 
17 years, from 1991–2008, and served as 
college counsel for several years. 
He wore many hats and provided his 
keen insight, legal acumen, and wise 
counsel to ensure the college that he 
loved so dearly was even better for the 
next generation of students. His pas-
sion and dedication will always be re-
membered. 
My thoughts and prayers will remain 
with his family and friends during this 
most difficult time.

CELEBRATING THE RETIREMENT 
OF JANE WHEATLEY 
(Mr. COMER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
honor Jane Wheatley, CEO of the Tay-
lor Regional Hospital in Campbells-
ville, Kentucky, who retired after 20 
years in this critically important posi-
tion. 
While Jane has led this institution 
for two decades, her service to the hos-
pital spans much longer. She began 
working in the business office in 1978 at 
what was then known as the Taylor 
County Hospital before climbing the 
ranks to become chief financial officer 
and later chief executive officer. 
Under Jane’s leadership, Taylor Re-
gional Hospital has undergone dra-
matic growth to become a regional hub 
for 
quality 
healthcare. 
Without 
a 
doubt, her vision for growth contrib-
uted mightily to the hospital’s success. 
She also has a love for Campbellsville 
that drove her to do all she could to en-
sure her fellow citizens did not have to 
travel far for vital healthcare needs. 
Jane’s professional success is a testa-
ment to her hard work, leadership, and 
desire to improve the community she 
loves. She leaves a proud legacy in 
Taylor County, and I wish her nothing 
but the best in a well-earned retire-
ment.

CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL 
EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO 
ZIMBABWE—MESSAGE FROM THE 
PRESIDENT 
OF 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES (H. DOC. NO. 117–97) 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
MRVAN) laid before the House the fol-
lowing message from the President of 
the United States; which was read and, 
together with the accompanying pa-
pers, referred to the Committee on For-
eign Affairs and ordered to be printed: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides 
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90 
days prior to the anniversary date of 
its declaration, the President publishes 
in the Federal Register and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to 
the Federal Register for publication the 
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency declared in Executive 
Order 13288 of March 6, 2003, with re-
spect to the actions and policies of cer-
tain members of the Government of 
Zimbabwe and other persons to under-
mine Zimbabwe’s democratic processes 
or institutions is to continue in effect 
beyond March 6, 2022. 
President Emmerson Mnangagwa has 
not made the necessary political and 
economic reforms that would warrant 
terminating the existing targeted sanc-
tions program. Throughout the last 
year, 
government 
security 
services 
routinely intimidated and violently re-
pressed citizens, including members of 
opposition 
political 
parties, 
union 
members, and journalists. The absence 
of progress on the most fundamental 
reforms needed to ensure the rule of 
law, democratic governance, and the 
protection of human rights leaves 
Zimbabweans vulnerable to ongoing re-
pression and presents a continuing 
threat to peace and security in the re-
gion.

The actions and policies of certain 
members 
of 
the 
Government 
of 
Zimbabwe and other persons to under-
mine Zimbabwe’s democratic processes 
or institutions continue to pose an un-
usual and extraordinary threat to the 
foreign policy of the United States. 
Therefore, I have determined that it is 
necessary to continue the national 
emergency declared in Executive Order 
13288, as amended, with respect to 
Zimbabwe and to maintain in force the 
sanctions to respond to this threat.

AN ECONOMIC WALK THROUGH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. SCHWEIKERT) is recognized 
for 60 minutes as the designee of the 
minority leader. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, this 
is going to be one of those moments 
where you sort of walk through. We ob-
viously had the State of the Union a 
couple nights ago. Instead of just sort 
of walking through my frustrations 
with it, I want to dice up a couple of 
things that I considered the most out-
rageous, but also a continuation of a 
theme, and that is something has hap-
pened here. 
My brothers and sisters on the left 
over here, somehow, somewhere in the 
last year or two have moved into try-
ing to make public policy by virtue sig-
naling. And I think I will prove this. 
And I am open, if anyone out there 
from my Democratic colleagues can 
give me something you did in the last 
year of absolute power and control here 
in Washington, D.C., that actually 
made the lives and the country better 
or that over the next decade will make 
their lives better. It is almost like we 
are in this clown show of you get re-
warded for saying pretty words and be 
damned the actual outcomes. 
So let’s walk through some of the re-
ality. 
Now, you remember at one point we 
were talking about energy, and the fact 
of the matter is, the world is financing 
Putin’s war machine. Remember, it 
was last October that natural gas 
prices exploded, and it was obvious. 
You set up policy sets as soon as the 
administration took power, canceling 
the Keystone Pipeline, trying to do all 
sorts of restrictions, which the courts 
had to roll back, so now the adminis-
tration threw up new restrictions. 
What did you think would happen? 
And you can actually, though, look at 
the lunacy that are policies from the 
United States; and I will also blame 
Western Europe. 
These are the pipelines. This is how 
you finance functionally a gas station 
with nuclear weapons, which is func-
tionally what Russia is today. And you 
start to understand—and a couple 
weeks ago we came here and even on a 
YouTube channel we tried to explain 
policies that have happened in places 
like Germany. 
Go back a decade ago. Do you all re-
member when the green left movement 
in Germany—now that we know it was 
backdoor financed by Russia—was out 
there protesting we need to get rid of 
the nuclear power plants, the baseload 
nuclear? I think they got rid of 20- 
something plants. There are only one 
or two still functioning, and they are 
scheduled for decommissioning. 
Germany actually got dirtier, you 
know, so the very people that used to 
preach to us about global warming, 
about greenhouse gases got dirtier. 
They are burning more coal. And, also, 
they don’t just take natural gas from 
Russia and oil from Russia, now they 
even take coal from Russia, and you 
actually see the pipelines. So at the 
same time, a sort of Malthusian left 
here has been trying to strangle Amer-
ican hydrocarbons—and understand, I 
am a huge fan of natural gas. 
The last 15 years, the remarkable re-
duction in greenhouse gasses coming 
from North America is because of nat-
ural gas. Remember, the decommis-
sioning of North American nuclear 
power, baseload power, pretty much 
equals all the clean energy, the photo-
voltaic, the wind, that has gone in. 
So you can say, Oh, look at all these 
new solar panels, but the fact of the 
matter is the amount of nuclear we 
have removed—so how do we get so 
clean? 
Remember, a year or two ago, we 
were within a margin of even hitting 
the Paris accord, something we didn’t 
sign on to because of the use of natural 
gas. So as we are starting to restrict 
ours, you see the pipelines coming out 
of Russia moving into Europe, instead 
of us expanding ours and saying we are 
going to liquify natural gas and get it 
out of here, sell it to the world, balance 
the payments, grow the economy. 
So there’s great irony, think of the 
virtue signaling here over and over. 
Even a couple days ago, when we 
were getting a briefing, and there was 
the discussion of how we get more en-
ergy exports to Europe as they are en-
gaging in the sanctions. And someone 
from the left screams out, But what 
about the environment? You do realize 
the Democrats and Biden policy had us 
burn 23 percent more coal this last 
year. The policy so jacked up the price 
of natural gas here in the United 
States that power is regulated. Power 
facility after power facility converted 
back to coal because the brain trust on 
the left and in the White House so re-
stricted access to natural gas, prices 
went up dramatically. 
Remember we went from, what, $2 on 
the futures market to at one point we 
hit $6? And it didn’t just happen be-
cause of the invasion of Ukraine. Those 
numbers were hitting last October. 
If you care about the environment 
will someone on the left hire an econo-
mist that owns a calculator? We 
burned 23 percent more coal last year. 
This is a direct result of crappy policy. 
And then you think about being from 
Arizona. I did a ride along about a 
month ago with a police officer that is 
a friend of mine. And he was taking me 
through an area that he has patrolled 
for 28 years. And he was saying, I am 
seeing neighborhoods here that have 
doubled the homelessness, the number 
of overdose deaths that are happening 
in these neighborhoods has exploded 
this last year. 
Do you not think when you let the 
borders open up that you are not screw-
ing over America? 
Look, we have come here over and 
over and said, What are the two most 
economically violent things you can do 
to the working middle class? Inflation 
and opening the borders, where you 
flood the society with people with simi-
lar skill sets. 
And these weren’t conservative eco-
nomic models, these were done by left-
ist professors a decade ago that said, 
when you take the working poor and 
flood the market with people with 
similar skill sets, you inhibit their eco-
nomic growth, their wages. One of 
them said this population will be poor-
er for a decade. 
The fact of the matter is when the 
left allows the open borders—because 
remember, that was going to be com-
passionate except for Americans. 
I am now being told that drug prices 
in the Phoenix market have crashed. 
Now, in this area I am no expert. My 
mother was a substance abuse coun-
selor for many years, heard many 
heartbreaking stories. 
But when you have the patrol officer 
telling you that a year ago it may take 
$70, $100 for someone to get high that 
day, and today it can be less than $10, 
the basic rule of economics tells you 
something. And it is fentanyl which 
kills people. 
So now, all the sudden, I am seeing 
more drugs, I am seeing more home-
lessness, a dramatic increase in home-
lessness. I am actually seeing a huge 
spike of crime. And then the deaths. 
If you are playing economist, we all 
talk about second-degree effects and 
third-degree effects but does anyone 
here actually have any love and com-
passion in their heart to understand 
the misery, just the misery that the 
Democrat policies have been virtue sig-
naling. We are going to be compas-
sionate. We are a loving country. We 
are going to open up our borders. But 
what about the misery that has been 
foisted on so many people? 
And the tricky part is, if you look at 
the economic model, even if we went 
back to normality tomorrow, because 
of the populations that are here that 
are going to compete for those mod-
erate-skill jobs, you will have sup-
pressed income opportunity for a whole 
segment of our country for a decade. 
And then the President gets up and 
goes, Well, you know, the tax cuts for 
the rich. Come on. Look, I know Demo-
crats love to use fact-checking, except 
when it is actual fact-checking. Tax re-
form that was done in December 2017

H1293 
March 3, 2022 
made the tax code more progressive. 
Once again, the top 10 percent of in-
come earners pay a higher percentage 
of the Federal income tax today than 
they did before tax reform. The left 
knows this, but God forbid, they tell 
the truth. And look, once again, 2015 
had a timing anomaly on tax receipts. 
For those of us in Ways and Means 
they are tax receipts. 2018, 2019, two of 
the highest receipts revenue in history. 
So number two and three, and if you 
do the timing effects, it is number one 
and number two. The fact of the mat-
ter is there was tax reform, and more 
money came in. If you and I did a sur-
vey of Democrats, how many of them 
would actually know that, or actually 
if they knew it would be willing to say 
it in front of a camera? 
The fact of the matter is corporate 
tax revenues, receipts, rose by 75 per-
cent, the repatriation of money the 
companies had been leaving. Do you re-
member 
the 
complaints 
from 
the 
Obama 
administration 
about 
how 
many companies were leaving the 
United States? They stopped leaving. 
They started coming back. But we also 
saw individual income taxes went up, 
what, 271⁄2 percent according to CBO, 
and that 80 percent increase was paid 
by the top 10 percent of income earn-
ers. 
You know, I understand things that 
grow the economy, supply side, that 
create a more egalitarian society, that 
make the poor less poor, that crushed 
food insecurity, that actually, for mi-
nority populations, had the fastest 
wage growth in U.S. history is really 
uncomfortable for folks on the left be-
cause they have to admit that they are 
sort of—and it is not even Keynesian, 
it is like a bastardized Keynesian 
model of throw lots of money and pre-
tend everything is okay model because 
that is what the left’s economics are 
these days. It is just bizarre, the fact 
that some people like to call it supply 
side, it is just the incentives to make 
more stuff, the incentives to hire more 
people, the incentives to have a grow-
ing economy. Because I am one of 
those people—and I actually believe 
most Republicans are—that growth is 
moral because that growth provides a 
chance. 
Look at the math. You know, after 
what we called the Tax Cuts and Jobs 
Act, do you see the curve? Do you see 
the growth in wages? And the yellow 
line here is female wages. They ex-
ploded. Their growth dramatically out-
paced males. It was the best income 
growth ever for women of color, the 
best income growth ever for the very 
minority populations that we hear the 
virtue signaling pandering to, but the 
difference is the Republicans actually 
delivered it. 
b 1230 
Yet, the left’s model is: Hey, we will 
just send out checks, and we will send 
out some more checks, and then we 
won’t ask anyone to go get job training 
or actually work for the checks. 
Then you wonder why America today 
is poorer than it was a year ago. I 
mean, it is the math. I know it is un-
comfortable, but it is the math. Work-
ing men and women, the working poor, 
are poorer today than the day Joe 
Biden, the day the Democrats, took ab-
solute control of this government. 
You see it on the charts. The fact of 
the matter is, when you see the 
spread—we are here. That spread, that 
is substantially income inequality, and 
it is blowing apart. It is becoming like 
an alligator mouth driven by the left’s 
policies. 
Do you accept you are hurting peo-
ple? 
It is economics. It is math. You can 
virtue signal all you want, but eventu-
ally, the math always wins. 
Then you take what the left has done 
in inflation. You are making Ameri-
cans poorer. I know this is hard to see, 
but you are making people poorer. I 
mean, the other day, there was a New 
York Times Noble Prize economist say-
ing: Well, the poor aren’t getting that 
poor because of the data. 
Well, no. He forgot to also—and he 
knows this, that inflation has moved 
up the price of housing. Inflation, you 
will see what’s happening in fuel and in 
food, but the housing index, the way 
they do the calculations in CPI has a— 
think of it as a shock absorber. Your 
rent goes up a couple of hundred bucks 
per month for the rest of the year; that 
doesn’t actually enter into the CPI. It 
is slowly baked in because you have 
just signed a contract for a year, right? 
The willingness to rationalize and lie 
so you can continue the virtue sig-
naling of fantasy, the math is the math 
is the math. And the terrifying thing 
is, okay, yes, you are at a 7-plus per-
cent inflation last year. In areas like 
mine, in the Phoenix area, it was 9 per-
cent, substantially because of housing. 
Then you go back to the homelessness 
and you understand why people of very 
modest income can’t even afford a 
basic place to live. 
We are looking at data in the Joint 
Economic Committee. We could hit 10 
percent this year. You understand how 
kicking people in the head with poli-
cies that make them poorer screw up 
their retirements, their ability to feed 
their family and have any savings. 
What was the President’s solution? 
Well, we are going to look at busi-
nesses and ask them to function with 
less profits, and we are going to just 
pay less. Huh? Did anyone listen to the 
speech? The Ukraine portion, great. 
Yay. We all cheered. But as the Presi-
dent walked through the economic por-
tion of his speech, it was, A, not truth-
ful, and economically delusional. 
So we want to come here with a cou-
ple of ideas, and we would be elated if 
the majority actually takes them and 
runs away with them. 
So, back to our elementary school ec-
onomics class. What is inflation? Clas-
sic definition of inflation: too much 
cash chasing too few goods and serv-
ices. Will we agree to that? 
Look, I know this is uncomfortable, 
but the reality of it—Democrat policies 
are actually hurting people. Maybe we 
can actually turn the ship around. So if 
I came to you and said it is too many 
dollars chasing too few goods, you have 
what the Federal Reserve will do, 
which is start to pull liquidity out of 
the market—you know, the extraor-
dinary measures, buying U.S. sovereign 
debt, which has functionally enabled 
Congress to spend like crazy because 
the Federal Reserve is buying our bots, 
raising interest rates to pull liquidity 
out of society. 
But that is going to hurt people, too, 
right? Your interest rates are going to 
go up. Your credit cards are going to go 
up, and everything else. 
How about a President that comes 
behind 
the 
microphone, 
Democrats 
come behind the microphone, and actu-
ally offer real, big-boy solutions that 
actually, A, are founded in economics 
but, second, would actually be good for 
society, would actually work. 
We want to propose a couple of 
quirky ideas. Just think of it as an 
idea box. If I came to you tomorrow 
and said one of the reasons you have 
inflation is the Democrats last year 
shoveled out so much cash, there is so 
much cash out there moving around, 
that there is too much money facing 
too few goods—great. 
What would happen if you turned to 
Americans and said: Hey, instead of 
going and buying that new big-screen 
television, we are going to encourage 
you to take a few hundred bucks and 
we are going to give you the spiff to go 
put it in your retirement account. Hell, 
we will let you use pre-tax money, and 
we will call it a Roth IRA. 
It would help retirement security. It 
also would be a way to pull—function-
ally, the same thing the Federal Re-
serve is trying to do—pull liquidity out 
of the markets. Republicans and Demo-
crats both would probably stand up and 
say: Hey. 
So let’s see. We could pull a whole 
bunch of the dollars out of the econ-
omy that are chasing too few goods and 
put them into people’s retirement so 
they have retirement security. Hey, 
this should be a win-win. 
Did you hear anything creative like 
that? Instead, you hear the virtue sig-
naling. Or how about one of my per-
sonal fixations, productivity? Remem-
ber what was the most powerful thing 
we did in tax reform? We built an in-
centive for businesses to take their 
money and build better plants and in-
vest in more fishing equipment so they 
could pay people more. 
The President goes, well, the cor-
porations made billions of dollars and 
didn’t pay any taxes. 
We built a tax code saying: Take 
your cash and make your company 
more efficient so you can pay people 
more so the economy grows. 
Once again, remember, we are bor-
rowing. Last year, we were borrowing 
$47,000 a second. If this economy does 
not grow like crazy because that debt

March 3, 2022 
curve, as that becomes more and more 
of an alligator mouth of here is our 
debt, here is the size of the economy, 
that gap is what wipes us out. 
If we can grow and keep that ratio of 
debt to the size of our economy— 
growth, growth, growth. Well, the idea 
is if you are trying to take on infla-
tion, you know you need a society that 
becomes more productive because, long 
term, that means people will be paid 
more. We become wealthier as a coun-
try and the ability to deal with the de-
mographic curve, that is the primary 
driver of our debt—do things like, hey, 
instead of just doing expensing on your 
capital goods, we will give you a little 
bit of like a bonus-type of depreciation 
to do it. 
These are economic ideas that would 
both help inflation but also make us 
more robust as an economy, as a coun-
try, if we have to take on the chal-
lenges of the world. 
So I beg of our brothers and sisters 
on the left, I don’t know how to get 
you to stop hurting people. You use 
very pretty words, brilliant virtue sig-
naling. For those who aren’t thinking, 
it sounds great until you sort of sit 
there and say, hold it, how does that 
work? 
There are ideas out there both the 
left and the right should be able to em-
brace to take on inflation, to stop 
hurting people in the country. But in-
stead, this place seems to reward itself 
by flowery language. We are judged on 
our intentions, not our successes. 
Look, this is what I am begging for: 
There are ideas at work, but the first 
thing we need to do is stop doing the 
crazy stuff that is hurting people. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
f 
TOPICS OF INTEREST 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Wis-
consin (Mr. GROTHMAN) is recognized 
for the remainder of the hour as the 
designee of the minority leader. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to discuss a few topics 
which should be of interest to all 
Americans. 
Obviously, many Americans have 
been glued to their TVs this week to 
see what is happening in Ukraine and 
what is going on with the Russians and 
the way they are treating the Ukrain-
ian people. 
I would like to emphasize one more 
time that it amazes me the journalists 
of this country and the politicians of 
this country can talk about the two 
countries, Russia and Ukraine, without 
talking about the Holodomor. 
I have asked children, college stu-
dents, law enforcement officers, jour-
nalists. Amazingly, they have gone 
through 8 or 12 or 16 years of schooling 
and don’t know what it is. 
The Holodomor took place in 1932 to 
1933 when communism had in the last 
few years taken over Russia and taken 
over Ukraine. Of course, communists, 
above all, hate freedom. I don’t know if 
you 
could 
describe 
Russia’s 
com-
munists today—maybe a little more 
fascist than communist. But at the 
time, there was no question it was 
communist, and they didn’t like the 
fact that the farmers, called the ku-
laks, were, to a degree, free and inde-
pendent. They were going to crack 
down on them by taking away their 
grain and making sure they would 
starve to death. 
Now, perhaps because it has not been 
adequately studied, we don’t know how 
many people were killed by the Com-
munist Party in Ukraine during the 
years 1932 to 1933, but if you peruse the 
internet, it is somewhere between 3 and 
17 million. 
Interestingly, at the same time these 
people were starving, the person The 
New York Times put on the case was a 
guy by the name of Walter Duranty, 
who they have since admitted they rec-
ognized he had some significant flaws 
in his study, but he managed not to re-
port the starvation. The readers of The 
New York Times at that time thought 
that things were going great in the So-
viet Union and that this might well be 
the wave of the future. 
This is what happens when we have 
people, 
progressives, 
whatever 
you 
want to call them, who are blind to the 
inevitable, horrible things that happen 
when you let the hardcore left, or what 
I would call the atheistic totalitarian 
left, take over a country. 
I would hope, as we talk about 
Ukraine and Russia, that our media 
outlets, be it newspaper or otherwise, 
use this as an opportunity to educate 
the American public as to how many 
millions of people starved to death dur-
ing this time. 
Every New York Times employee 
should have to listen to this show upon 
employment about what happened and 
about what the readers of The New 
York Times were not told about during 
these years. Every journalism major 
should spend a few classes when they 
begin journalism school on this topic. 
No American schoolchild should grad-
uate eighth grade without hearing 
about the Holodomor. 
Not only is it a warning for what 
happens when we let the hardcore left 
take over, but I don’t know how you 
can understand American history, the 
last 80 years, unless you know a little 
bit more about communism. 
How can American children know 
why we fought in Korea? How could 
American 
children 
know 
why 
we 
fought in Vietnam? How will American 
children know what we had a Cold War 
over? 
I don’t understand how you can talk 
about Ukraine and Russia without 
hearing about the first Ukrainian expe-
riences with communism. It is the rea-
son why some people like me are so be-
fuddled why Senator BLUMENTHAL is 
given kind of a free pass when he shows 
up at a communist anniversary. It is 
why people like me find it so offensive 
that two of the cofounders of Black 
Lives Matter were Marxists and that 
organization is treated with respect. 
This is why I am so concerned when 
we have owners of high-tech quasi-mo-
nopolies try to suppress information 
hostile to their progressive ideology. 
Just like in a hardcore leftist state, 
they would oppress the ability of the 
local people to find out views on all 
sorts of opinions. By the way, that is 
going on in the Soviet Union today. 
b 1245 
We turn on the TV and we get all 
sorts of information about what is 
going on in the Ukraine. The average 
Russian citizen, whose children are 
dying in the Ukraine, they don’t get to 
find out what is really going on. Some 
people call it Communist; some people 
call it Marxist. I don’t think Progres-
sive is exactly the same thing, but 
clearly Progressive is meant to be fur-
ther left than Liberal. 
I would hope that by the time this 
Ukrainian/Russian situation wraps up 
that American journalists make sure 
that 
everybody 
knows 
about 
the 
Holodomor. 
Mr. Speaker, the next thing I would 
like to talk about in President Biden’s 
annual speech, I think he got away— 
because of what happened in the 
Ukraine—without addressing some of 
the other problems that are, I think, 
unaddressed. 
I am going to talk a little bit about 
inflation. I am not like my good buddy 
from Arizona with huge graphs, but I 
want people to look at this little graph 
that is on a topic that is normally con-
sidered boring: the money supply. 
Here we have a graph showing the de-
gree to which the money supply goes 
up year over year. You will notice the 
money supply, compared to historic 
levels, went up rather dramatically, 
sometimes over 6 percent in the 1970s. 
People like me are old enough to re-
member that that is when mortgages 
were 20 percent and inflation was so 
high. 
If we look at this graph, we see that 
recently the money supply went up 
around 7 percent, then dropped down to 
almost nothing in the 1990s. It recently 
has hit a year over year increase of 40 
percent. I would hope that President 
Biden realizes that one of the reasons 
costs have gone so far up might have 
something to do with this dramatic in-
crease in the money supply. This is an 
amazing graph. 
President Biden—understanding so 
much about business—has simply ad-
vised us the way to deal with inflation 
is to tell businessmen to cut costs. 
Well, I will tell you, my district has 
more manufacturing jobs than any 
other district in the country and it is 
also a big agriculture district. 
When I had a couple weeks off in the 
past, I toured a lot of factories around 
my district. One of the things I heard, 
in addition to the huge labor shortage,

H1295 
March 3, 2022 
is the huge increase in the costs of pro-
duction, particularly in metals. Alu-
minum is going through the roof. Met-
als are up 300, 400, 500 percent com-
pared to a couple years ago. 
Mr. Speaker, I would ask President 
Biden: How do you lower costs if the 
cost of metals that are going into your 
product are up 300 to 400 percent? 
I mentioned I also have a big agri-
culture district, a lot of dairy, some 
corn, some potatoes. What do I get 
from the farmers? They are actually 
very concerned also about their costs 
of production: feed, fertilizer, chemi-
cals. Again, it is all skyrocketing. It is 
not a matter of just telling businesses 
to cut their costs. 
These are the reasons why inflation 
is so high and why our young people— 
who I worry about so much because 
they should be able to get on with their 
life, they should be able to build a new 
house, they should begin to be able to 
have children. I look at the costs that 
are necessary to live the American 
Dream. 
Housing. Did you ever look at how 
much the price of a house has gone up 
the last 18 months? Apartments. Now, I 
realize the cost of apartments varies 
dramatically, but in my area you used 
to be able to get an apartment for $600, 
$700, $800 a month. Now apartments are 
being rented for $1,500 a month. 
I don’t know how the young people 
are going to be able to afford the Amer-
ican Dream unless politicians begin to 
realize that when you have these big 
spending programs and the Fed has to 
print dollars to pay for them, you are 
inevitably going to get inflation. 
I beg President Biden and I beg the 
members of the Budget Committee and 
the Appropriations Committee that as 
we work towards the next budget, we 
try to hold down the level of spending. 
It wouldn’t be too much to ask if we 
had year over year no increase in 
spending at all. 
I beg President Biden and other 
members of his party not to push 
through another massive spending bill. 
They talk about a $3 trillion bill, and 
he still dreams of getting it through. If 
it is not a $3 trillion bill or if they get 
a $2 trillion or $1 trillion bill, it will 
further put the price of housing beyond 
reach of the young people in the coun-
try. 
One of the reasons it is so tempting 
for politicians to just print more 
money is because then they can say: I 
don’t know how this increase in prices 
got here. It is not my fault. Just tell 
the businessmen to cut costs. It is not 
a coincidence that we had a lot of infla-
tion in the 1970s when M2 was going up 
significantly. 
It is not going to be a coincidence 
when inflation continues to go up year 
after year as the business community 
and the agriculture community tells 
me it will. If politicians in Washington, 
in their path to reelection, decide that 
it means having the Federal Reserve 
print more money, let the costs go up, 
and then turn around and tell the 
American public: I don’t know how this 
happened, tell the businessmen to cut 
costs. Please address inflation like the 
great concern it is. 
Mr. Speaker, the next thing I would 
like to address that I don’t feel was 
adequately addressed the other night is 
the way we treat police in the country. 
President Biden tried to address 
spending on police. It is true that par-
ticularly in big cities with strong Dem-
ocrat city councils, strong Democrat 
mayors, they have not treated the po-
lice well the last few years. I don’t 
think President Biden addressed what I 
believe is the big reason why police 
have not been as effective in holding 
down the homicide rates compared to a 
few years ago. 
I think the major reason is that 
cheap politicians are out there lying 
and telling the public that they are 
racist. They are saying we ought to sue 
them, they are saying that we ought to 
pass legislation here in which it will 
make it easy to sue them. You wind up 
in a situation where the police become 
passive. 
As bad as the reduction in the num-
ber of police is, I think this constant 
harping on racism and the police and 
let’s make it easier to sue them makes 
matters even worse. I want to com-
mend President Biden, he didn’t talk 
about racism on Tuesday night, and 
that was a great improvement from his 
inaugural speech where it was kind of 
like all racism, white supremacy, blah, 
blah, blah. 
It would be nice if he would use the 
forum of the annual State of the Union 
address to apologize to the police of the 
country and educate the American pub-
lic that the police, by and large in this 
Nation, are not racist. When you look 
at studies, and there are a variety of 
studies we can pull up here, a Justice 
Department analysis of the Philadel-
phia Police Department found that 
White police officers were less likely 
than police officers of color to shoot 
unarmed Black suspects, for example. 
When you adjust, sadly, for violent 
crimes committed, again, you don’t 
find this racism. In an effort to win the 
next election—and they had success in 
the last election—again and again poli-
ticians are tearing down police depart-
ments and threatening to have the po-
lice sued. It is not surprising when the 
police become very passive, knowing 
that if you arrest somebody you could 
get a complaint filed against you; 
knowing that if you have to handcuff 
somebody or tackle somebody that 
there are politicians out there that 
want you to be sued. It is not sur-
prising if the police become passive. 
In the big, urban city closest to my 
heart, Milwaukee, where I was born 
and where my district is right up 
against, 2 years ago we hit the all-time 
record by a mile in murders. I didn’t 
think it could get any higher, but they 
broke the record again last year. 
I know if you talk to the police—they 
won’t say it publicly—but they aren’t 
policing the way they could 10 years 
ago because they are afraid they might 
get in trouble, they might get com-
plaints, they might get sued or what-
ever. They back off and a lot of people 
have paid for that backing off with 
their lives. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly wish Presi-
dent Biden would change his tune, stop 
pushing bills that make it easy to sue 
police, and above all, change the tone 
of discussion about policing in this 
country by admitting how un-racist 
the police are in this Nation and bring 
out more respect for them and allow 
police to not be afraid to do their job. 
Mr. Speaker, the next issue that I 
would like to address—and I wish 
President Biden would have used his 
opportunity on Tuesday night to ad-
dress—he mentioned COVID and COVID 
deaths go up and COVID deaths go 
down. We still have about 1,500 people a 
day dying of COVID. I have known four 
people, who I think were relatively 
healthy, who passed away in the last 4 
months of COVID. We shouldn’t forget 
about it. 
There are some things I have talked 
about COVID, and for whatever reason 
the public health establishment—and I 
think to a degree the President does 
control the public health establish-
ment—have not addressed vitamin D. 
There were studies that came out of 
Israel this week that they should have 
advertisements on all over this coun-
try. Israel found that patients with a 
vitamin D deficiency—and I think a vi-
tamin D deficiency was described under 
30-nanograms per milliliter—were 14 
times more likely to have a severe or 
critical case of COVID–19 than those 
people with sufficient vitamin D in 
their system. 
The mortality rate for those who had 
insufficient vitamin D levels was over 
25 percent compared to 2.3 percent. In 
other words, you were more than 12 
times as likely to die of COVID if you 
didn’t have adequate vitamin D in your 
system. 
I don’t know why the public health 
establishment won’t talk about this 
more. I have been talking about it for 
almost 2 years now. I realize that you 
can get nice bottles of vitamin D for 
$15 or $20 at Walgreens or wherever, so 
nobody is going a make a lot of money 
on it. And certainly, there are a lot of 
ways people made a lot of money with 
COVID so far. 
I do believe that if they pushed vita-
min D—not everybody would believe 
the commercials and not everybody 
would follow through—but I think it is 
entirely possible that you would reduce 
the number of fatalities by one-half. 
I asked President Biden to weigh in 
with his agencies and weigh in with the 
CDD or NIH, and have them educate 
the public on the huge potential sav-
ings in lives if Americans would have 
an adequate amount of vitamin D. 
I don’t like breaking out people of 
different ethnic backgrounds, but right 
now people of color are much more 
likely to be vitamin D deficient than 
people of European descent. So by not

trumpeting from the rooftops that vi-
tamin D can save your lives, you are 
unquestionably 
disproportionately 
causing people of color to die of this 
horrible disease. I realize there are 
other things that could be done. 
b 1300 
Mr. Speaker, I will repeat here: insuf-
ficient vitamin D levels, 25.6 mortality 
rate compared to 2.3 percent with ade-
quate levels. People with vitamin D de-
ficiency are 14 times more likely to 
have a severe or critical case of COVID. 
Why does the average person not 
know this? 
I tell them when I run into them, but 
I can’t talk to everybody. It would be 
nice if the public health establishment 
would talk a little bit more about that. 
One other thing, by the way, I was 
hoping on COVID he would do, the pro-
tocol of a lot of hospitals is to deter-
mine the drugs they prescribe by what 
is recommended out of the big agencies 
in the government. And there are a lot 
of very intelligent people who feel that 
we would have saved a lot of people if 
we could have used off-label drugs rath-
er than the $3,000-a-day remdesivir. In 
other words, they felt there were better 
drugs that would probably cost one- 
hundredth of the amount of the drug 
that was being pushed out of CDC. It 
would be nice in America, the land of 
the free, if we would allow doctors in 
hospitals to use these other drugs. I 
think, again, Mr. Speaker, you would 
have significant savings compared to 
where we stand right now. 
These are some of topics that I think 
were not addressed and should have 
been addressed and would save lives if 
appropriately addressed in the State of 
the Union. 
We will mention one more because 
we have a little bit of time here. Presi-
dent Biden, to his credit, pointed out 
that a lot of people are dying from ille-
gal drugs. He didn’t exactly have any 
concrete proposals as to what to do. 
When I got this job 7 years ago, 47,000 
Americans were dying every year from 
illegal 
drug 
overdoses. 
Fifty-seven 
thousand people died in 12 years in the 
Vietnam war. And they made a big deal 
about that when I was a child. Now you 
have 47,000 in 1 year, Mr. Speaker, 
when I got elected. 
Do you know what it is now, Mr. 
Speaker? 
One hundred thousand. It is as if we 
are having two Vietnam wars every 
year, and the politicians hardly talk 
about it. 
Now, I think one of the reasons 
President Biden wouldn’t come up with 
anything concrete is that almost all 
the fentanyl—a drug which he wouldn’t 
even mention by name which is respon-
sible for most of these deaths—almost 
all of the fentanyl is coming across the 
southern border, and, of course, our 
President doesn’t like to talk about 
the southern border because we have a 
largely open southern border in which 
90 to 100,000 people every month are 
coming across. 
It also may mean a little bit more of 
an aggressive law enforcement going 
after the people who sell the fentanyl. 
But, of course, we can’t say we should 
have more aggressive law enforcement, 
and we can’t say that more drug deal-
ers should wind up in prison because 
then we would have more in prison. 
So rather than doing these things, 
why don’t we just let 100,000 people a 
year die? 
Some people can say drug possession 
and sale of drugs is a victimless crime. 
I say if you think about the parents or 
the spouses or the children or the sib-
lings of the 100,000 people who die, I 
don’t know how we cannot do more to 
address this problem. 
I would hope that next year in the 
State of the Union speech President 
Biden does a little more to address the 
100,000 people who are dying of drug 
overdoses and does a little more to ad-
dress the perhaps hundreds of thou-
sands of people whose lives could be 
saved if we freed up doctors to pre-
scribe whatever drugs they wanted to 
and if we would have pushed a little bit 
more vitamin D. 
I think we would have a much more 
well-informed electorate if the edu-
cational system and the journalist es-
tablishment did a little more to edu-
cate the public about the Holodomor. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
f 
ISSUES OF THE DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) is recognized 
for 60 minutes as the designee of the 
majority leader. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, 
certainly this is a moment in history 
for many, many ways. I have heard of 
the—really the constant—how do we 
say 
in 
the 
country—ranging 
and 
tanging, the constant refrain of our 
friends on the other side of the aisle, 
and I am going to take somewhat of 
the approach of the President of the 
United States who gave really one of 
the most historic, dynamic, and point-
ed speeches to the American people 
that I have ever heard. 
Mr. Speaker, let me thank President 
Biden on the floor of the House for 
speaking straight to the American pub-
lic. All those who were willing to hear 
their President who recognized that we 
are a nation of the United States of 
America, that we are truly, truly a na-
tion that rises to the occasion of de-
fending democracy together as the 
United States of America. 
That speech covered the pain and the 
joy that we face today. And I want to 
start with his concluding remarks, and 
I can almost hear his resonating voice, 
his passion, and his true reach to the 
American people. This was the State of 
the Union, the first, and so when the 
question was asked, President Biden 
said my report is this: ‘‘The state of 
the Union is strong because you, the 
American people, are strong.’’ 
Who could not fall under the strength 
of that statement? 
The mothers of soldiers who are in 
faraway places; fathers who go out and 
work every day who look to hope from 
their country to make sure they can 
provide for their family; the senior 
citizens; the students who fight against 
tuition increases; and the vulnerable 
people seeking homes and houses; they 
heard him. 
‘‘We are stronger today than we were 
a year ago, and we will be stronger a 
year from now than we are today. Now 
is our moment to meet and overcome 
the challenges of our time, and we will 
as one people, one America—the United 
States of America. May God bless you 
all. May God protect our troops.’’ 
From the beginning he spoke to the 
American people without divisiveness 
and certainly with an understanding 
that we have gone through as a people 
a most historic and devastating mo-
ment in our lives. I know that because 
more than once I have visited the area 
on the Mall that showed the little 
white flags. If you have visited Arling-
ton National Cemetery, then you know 
the sacrifice of our soldiers, you know 
the rows and rows and rows and rows 
and rows of tombstones from wars be-
yond our historical time. 
But when you went to that exhibit, if 
it was that commemoration, that trib-
ute, that acknowledgment, that place 
of mourning to know of the hundreds of 
thousands of Americans who died be-
cause of COVID 19, and some dying in 
the early stages, some families having 
six, seven, and nine people their fam-
ily. So you know this was an enormous 
time. 
Let me thank the Congressional Pro-
gressive Caucus who just yesterday 
Congresswoman 
LEGER
FERNANDEZ 
spoke of our next steps in the work 
ahead. 
I didn’t want this time to end with-
out responding to day after day refrain 
from our Republican friends with no 
plans, no solutions, no next steps, just 
criticism over and over again just so 
their voices could be heard. 
There is no doubt of the magnificence 
of the work that has been done by the 
President of the United States. Let me 
read, if I might, again, into the RECORD 
from the Wall Street Journal. And let 
me acknowledge that in my district 
where there are persistent or even per-
manent economic problems such as 
long-term unemployment, weak labor 
markets, inexperienced workers, evic-
tions and foreclosures, these are what 
come about through a catastrophe like 
the pandemic. And, also, as the Wall 
Street Journal referred to: ‘‘The pain-
ful truth about economic recoveries is 
not that everyone bounces back finan-
cially after a downturn.’’ 
There are always going to be Ameri-
cans, as I said, in long-term unemploy-
ment, weak labor markets, inexperi-
enced workers, evictions and fore-
closures, and people trapped in difficult 
economic 
conditions 
because 
there 
needs to be a reimagining of their job.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1297 
March 3, 2022 
There are always going to be those peo-
ple. But there are policies that can 
limit this scarring, as economists 
sometimes refer to it. 
Our President Biden, the President of 
the United States, his American Res-
cue Plan has led to less of it than any 
recovery in the last 50 years. If there 
were good-thinking people on this 
floor, they would rise to a standing 
ovation as we did on Tuesday night. 
Long-term 
unemployment, 
While 
most jobs will return after an economic 
downturn, the number of people strug-
gling with long-term unemployment— 
without work for at least 6 months— 
often 
remains 
relatively 
high 
for 
months after general unemployment 
peaks. 
While the American Recovery and 
Reinvestment Act of 2009 helped avert 
an economic depression, the persist-
ence of high long-term unemployment 
2 years later led President Obama to 
press a Republican House for a second 
stimulus. 
But in this instance, we can assure 
that the American Rescue Plan of 
President Biden—and, by the way, 
through no fault of President Obama 
who did not have a cooperative Repub-
lican Congress—this has been the least 
impact and the greater recovery in at 
least 50 years. 
Mr. Speaker, don’t you think that is 
worthy of celebration? 
But no. There is a whining and whin-
ing and whining as if the President 
does not recognize the importance of 
pressing forward on behalf of the Amer-
ican people. 
So let me, first of all, indicate that 
in a few days we will be honoring and 
recognizing those foot soldiers who 
marched across the Edmund Pettus 
Bridge, not once but twice, led by John 
Robert Lewis, our late colleague, and 
Martin Luther King, Jr., because the 
ultimate gift of democracy comes out 
of the voices of the people who vote. 
Isn’t it a shame that 100 years post 
the Emancipation Proclamation for 
the second time in 1865 after the Eman-
cipation Proclamation of 1863 that 1965 
had to be the year that President Lyn-
don Baines Johnson that again we rein-
forced the 15th Amendment of the right 
to vote. 
And here we are today in a primary 
that was held in Texas, the first pri-
mary in the Nation, and it was a dis-
aster because of SB 1 led by Repub-
licans to take the vote right out of the 
mouths of seniors, African Americans, 
Hispanics, veterans, soldiers, and stu-
dents, gleefully so that they would 
have an upper hand rejecting 30 to 40 
percent mailed blots. 
This is a picture of John Lewis on 
that bridge. We will commemorate that 
march this weekend because we believe 
in democracy. We believe in the forth-
rightness of the democratic Republic 
being held up, being held up by the 
shoulders and the strength of those 
foot soldiers of 1965, un-named, as there 
were those who fought for the 1964 Civil 
Rights Act, held up the very Constitu-
tion and the very Nation that we have 
because of the vote. And we will march 
to commemorate. 
But, sadly, as we march, the destruc-
tion of democracy in this country is, I 
believe, the ultimate results of these 
radical right bills that are trying to de-
stroy the right to vote after the false 
statement of the big lie and 2020 when 
the most amount of Americans voted 
for the Presidential candidate and our 
President, the President of the United 
States of all the people was elected, 
Joe Biden, and KAMALA HARRIS as Vice 
President. 
Can we not just accept that and be 
happy about that? 
And can we not join in the words of 
John Lewis of the beloved community? 
That is why I stand here today and 
salute him and acknowledge the be-
loved community. 
b 1315 
Then I want to proceed, as a member 
of the beloved community, to thank 
our soldiers, some of whom I saw, if 
you will, when I was in the Ukraine 
area, meaning, I was in the area of 
Lithuania, Belarus, on the border. 
Now, acknowledging the strength of 
the President to have upwards of 
100,000 troops around in the NATO ally 
countries, making sure that those 
countries that are NATO allies are 
well-protected while providing, as the 
President has indicated, substantial 
support, if you will, to our friends, the 
Ukrainians, to give them strength even 
in the face of brutality and terrorism 
by Vladimir Putin, whose war this is— 
no vote has been taken in Russia. This 
is his attack. 
Even though, as I was in the region, 
we continue to work with the OSCE to 
push for diplomacy and peace, asking 
Putin to come to the peace table and to 
not destroy the Ukrainian people and 
the democratic republic that it is, or 
nation, and to sit with President 
Zelensky, as he reminded us this week 
that light will win over darkness. 
Putin would not have it. Even though 
his soldiers have surrendered, and they 
are without food, they are still a major 
threat. They are without knowledge, as 
one dead Russian soldier had texted he 
did not know why he was there. 
Isn’t that a shame to take young kids 
and destroy their lives because of your 
own power hungriness and the lack of 
understanding of what the world order 
is and to kill recklessly human beings? 
But the President of the United 
States held together this wonderful al-
liance of NATO countries around peace. 
I want to be very clear: I want peace. 
I am not an offender; I am a defender. 
I want us to use diplomacy. I want us 
to embrace the migrants or the immi-
grants, African immigrants and others 
that are coming out of Ukraine, treat-
ing everyone to the opportunity of 
being able to escape as a refugee, if you 
will, from the violence, now a million 
displaced persons. But I want diplo-
macy and peace. 
Yet, as the President spent months 
building a coalition of freedom-loving 
nations from Europe, the Americas, to 
Asia and Africa, to confront Putin, he 
wanted peace. He spent countless hours 
dealing with the allies. 
His backdrop was another world war, 
and World War III, for this is the great-
est threat to Europe since World War 
II. 
The 
geography 
lends 
itself 
to 
Putin’s violence. He remembered those 
who fell in Normandy and elsewhere so 
that Europe might be free, and the 
Marshall Plan, and a strong Europe 
today, our allies, correcting the mishap 
of the past 4 years when Europe was 
put to the side and the President that 
had this job gave accolades and flowers 
to Vladimir Putin and, even today, has 
called our President dumb and Putin 
smart. How shameful. 
But I am glad I am being led in this 
country by President Biden because he 
knows how we fought for freedom, ex-
panded 
liberty, 
defeated 
totali-
tarianism and terror, and built a 
strong and the freest and most pros-
perous nation. 
I just repeat these words because I 
think it is important to realize how we 
have helped and how he has worked to 
ensure that help is coming through our 
ability. Though our forces are not 
going to Europe, he made it crystal 
clear that we will stand with our NATO 
countries and that we remain strong 
for Ukraine as they fight back. 
As has been said, light comes after 
darkness. As we provide them with the 
resources that are to be heard around 
the world, and that we, as well, forge 
with Ukrainian Americans and work to 
be able to help their relatives through 
the State Department. 
Even as Putin circles Kyiv with 
tanks, he will never gain, as the Presi-
dent said, the hearts of the Ukrainian 
people. 
We want to make sure that it is 
known that we are providing the nec-
essary support with weapons that are 
able to be sent with intensity to 
Ukraine. 
But the human cost is evident, and I 
will just take you down memory lane, 
that you have seen. This is the violence 
of Putin, the violence of Russia. Amer-
ica has been a defender in all the crises 
that we have faced, the violence. This 
is the Putin who said this is an oper-
ation but is not attempting to hurt the 
Ukrainian people. 
Look at this person who is harmed. 
Look at them praying, their hands up. 
The despair of destruction, but that de-
struction is not going to weaken the 
Ukrainian people—the despair, but not 
defeat; the violence, but not defeat. 
In the course of the work that we 
have been doing, I recommended last 
week that America’s efforts to stop 
Russia should be in the financial pock-
ets. The ruble is down. It is in the 
midst of rubble, by the way, but the 
ruble is down. 
People are suffering. It is shameful 
because the American people care 
about people, and it is shameful that 
the currency is impacting Russians 
who have not voted for this war.

But it is important, as well, that, as 
I called for in my district, the need for 
Putin to be charged as a war criminal. 
That is an imperative, and now an in-
vestigation has been opened. 
This is not a family that has—this is 
an example of mothers with newborn 
babies fleeing. Just think of you hold-
ing a newborn baby safely in the 
United States. But mothers are fleeing 
with 1-week-old babies. It is a tragedy. 
A surrogate had twins, and that fam-
ily in the United States is struggling 
to get those newborn twins to safety. 
This is what Vladimir Putin has ren-
dered. I would say to you, we are not 
going to let him win, and the Ukrain-
ians will not let him win. The United 
States will not let him win. 
Thank you, President Biden, for 
bringing our allies together as we con-
tinue to try and stand strong. 
But we are not unmindful of what has 
to be done for the American people. We 
are not unmindful for inflation. And so 
I hope that his announcement of Make 
It In America, of the 65,000 highways 
and infrastructure that is going to be 
fixed because of the enormity and the 
importance of the bipartisan infra-
structure bill, along with the final pas-
sage of the COMPETES Act, that we 
will see Americans getting back to 
work and that we will work extensively 
to bring down the cost of living. 
And I, frankly, believe that that can 
be brought down with the passage of 
Build Back Better, where we will guar-
antee that you spend no more than 7 
percent for childcare. That is why 
women are not in the workforce during 
this pandemic—which is still existing; 
we are at the end of it, we hope and 
pray—because they could not pay for, 
with not having a job, childcare. 
Why can’t we move on childcare? We 
will. That is the work ahead. That is 
what I know the Congressional Pro-
gressive Caucus wants to see. That will 
help bring down costs, along with the 
continuation of the child tax credit. 
The work to be done is to respond to 
your needs, dealing with inflation, 
which includes the 11,000 jobs that will 
come about through implementing—as 
the President said, we have announced 
and now are going to work on the bi-
partisan infrastructure bill. 
You will see no more collapsed 
bridges in America’s cities. It is the 
first and most historic infrastructure 
bill, I think, in the last 50 years or 
more. 
We must make that child tax credit 
permanent because that is going to 
help our families. 
We must recognize the importance of 
the COMPETES Act because, in fact, 
we must overcome that import of the 
semiconductor industry and the tools 
needed. We cannot rely on China. We 
must bring it home. The COMPETES 
Act will help us bring it home. 
We must recognize that social justice 
is imperative, as well. We just finished 
Black History Month to reemphasize 
the importance of the history of Afri-
can Americans in this country who 
first came in the bottomless belly of a 
slave boat. 
It is important that we acknowledge 
with dignity. Race is not toxic and so 
toxic that we cannot discuss it with be-
nevolence and through the beloved 
community. 
How dare someone get on the floor: 
Oh, he didn’t talk about that racism 
thing. 
You walk a mile in our shoes. Walk a 
mile in our shoes. We don’t carry rac-
ism as an anger tool. We don’t walk 
around and dislike people. We embrace 
our brothers and sisters. 
I am on the floor with colleagues 
from many different places. I relish the 
interaction. I know they are with me, 
as I am with them. 
But when someone comes and con-
tinues, as Republicans have done, to 
take this, as led by their leader, their 
guide, their god, which is what Presi-
dent Trump has become, and he has de-
cided that the critical race theory is a 
fake argument—it has a basis in ana-
lyzing law, as it has impacted groups 
like African Americans and promoted 
racism. 
It should not be where we are raising 
our children on it. I agree. It is not a 
lesson for pre-K, elementary school, 
maybe even middle school. But under-
standing that there have been dif-
ferences and that we seek to heal them 
is crucial. 
I take great umbrage to the demean-
ing of Black Lives Matter, which fate-
fully brought to our attention the hei-
nous killing of Trayvon Martin and 
have stood alongside families time 
after time after time because no one, 
including America’s best law enforce-
ment agencies across America, wants 
to have the treatment of their neigh-
bors unfairly. 
Those who have done so, they stand 
with us for accountability. They see 
the value in the George Floyd Justice 
in Policing Act. They see the value in 
the original George Floyd bill that I in-
troduced that was about police train-
ing and investing in the 18,000 police 
departments. 
We have an array of positions, but 
the President indicated that he was 
looking to work with communities to 
bring down crime—good for him—even 
to the extent of being a champion for 
provisions that came from the Judici-
ary Committee, along with other com-
mittees, about bringing down commu-
nity violence. 
We are not afraid of going right after 
it because we know our families are 
suffering. 
b 1330 
Is there any attention to gun vio-
lence? 
The 
rampant, 
unbelievable, 
reckless laws of Republican Governors, 
like permitless carry in the State of 
Texas, that have simply brought us 
down to our knees because guns are ev-
erywhere, stolen out of cars, people 
buying guns like they don’t have any 
conscience, buying them off of streets. 
Where do they get them? They can 
originally start in a legal system, but 
then you add, really, salt to the wound 
and talk about the poisonous and real-
ly difficult manner of trying to ensure 
that there is no restraint on guns. 
I introduced the Kimberly Vaughan 
storage bill that I hope to see pass and 
to work with other Members who, like-
wise, are working hard to get Ameri-
cans to understand the necessity of 
storing their guns. 
I continue to work on the healing 
legislation that deals with H.R. 40, the 
Commission to Study and Develop Rep-
aration Proposals, supported by the 
NAACP, the National Urban League, 
the National Action Network, and the 
Congressional Black Caucus, not out of 
anger but out of a sense of under-
standing and restoration and repair, 
humbly saying: Let’s take a look. Let’s 
make sure that we have a pathway to 
do better, as we have a pathway for 
economic development, as we have a 
pathway for childcare, as we have a 
pathway for creating the care economy 
that was proposed by the President and 
in Build Back Better, as we have a 
pathway for getting our voting rights, 
as we have a pathway for helping with 
police-community relationships, as we 
have a pathway for bringing down 
crime and helping our families and pro-
tecting victims, as the almost $1 mil-
lion that I was able to get for the Hous-
ton Police Department to restore their 
crime victims’ office. What a celebra-
tion we had. We are waiting for those 
resources so they can get to work and 
make sure victims are not left alone, 
as we know that they are. 
I simply want to conclude my re-
marks by saying we are strong and also 
to indicate we have solutions like in 
the Build Back Better, not one of you 
will be left out of having healthcare. 
Work needs to be done. For the 12 
States, we have expanded Medicaid to a 
Federal program, and that must be 
where we ensure and assure that we 
can make it work. Wouldn’t that be a 
relief for young families, single Ameri-
cans, students, to be able to access a 
Federal Medicaid program, health for 
everyone. 
Let me remind my hometown: We are 
in the Gulf region and, yes, we flood. 
We are still fighting from Hurricane 
Harvey, the looks of this, and the kind 
of loss of homes, the largest cata-
strophic loss of homes in the history of 
the State of Texas, from flooding, from 
the hurricane. Our citizens, this is 
what they face. 
But guess what? Between the Army 
Corps of Engineers, Harris County 
Flood District, 18th Congressional Dis-
trict, the infrastructure bill, and the 
funding that we hope will come from 
the omnibus that has been so carefully 
negotiated, we will be confronting 
these as the President signs the omni-
bus, but more importantly, as the in-
frastructure bill is implemented. 
We are going to address the crises of 
disasters in America all over, the fires 
to the hurricanes because the Presi-
dent is leading, and the Congress, 
under the leadership of Speaker PELOSI

and CHUCK SCHUMER, is answering the 
call of the American people. 
Remember what I said. The President 
has announced that the State of the 
Union is strong, that America is 
strong, that we are united, and that we 
will not fail. He will lead by example. 
Social justice is not off the table. 
And the respect for people’s advocacy, 
as young people, like Black Lives Mat-
ter, NAACP, Urban League, National 
Action Network, Congressional Black 
Caucus, 
American 
Civil 
Liberties 
Union, 
League 
of 
Women 
Voters, 
LULAC, and an array of others, Asian- 
Pacific friends, and everyone around, 
southeast Asians, I have named them 
all, and, of course, our Native Amer-
ican friends. And all those whose 
names may not be called, we are united 
with all of America. And if you came 
over or Pilgrim’s Pride and were part 
of the founding 13 Colonies, you are 
part with all of us as the beloved com-
munity. Strong we are and strong we 
will be. 
I am delighted to say the work ahead 
is in good hands. Together, with this 
Congress and the President, America is 
in good hands. 
God bless you and this Congress, God 
bless the United States of America, and 
God bless our troops. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my col-
leagues in the Congressional Progressive 
Caucus to participate in tonight’s special order 
on ‘‘The Work Ahead’’ following President 
Biden’s powerful State of the Union address 
from last night. 
I thank Rep. TERESA LEGER FERNANDEZ for 
anchoring tonight’s Congressional Progressive 
Caucus special order. 
Last night’s State of the Union Address by 
President Biden provided an encouraging ac-
count of what all this Administration and Con-
gress have achieved for the American people. 
Democrats have many legislative achieve-
ments to be proud of, beginning with the Bi-
partisan Infrastructure Law. 
Since the dawn of his campaign, improving 
American infrastructure has been at the center 
of the President’s agenda. 
As the President recalled, before this act 
became law our infrastructure was ranked 
13th in the world. 
Worn down infrastructure also greatly im-
pacts the lives of working-class Americans try-
ing to complete simple tasks; like going to and 
from work, picking up their kids from school, 
or going across town to care for an elderly 
family member. 
Not committing to infrastructure significantly 
decreases our ability to fight climate change; 
without friendly EV infrastructure or access to 
mass public transit, our emissions will only in-
crease, failing to meet our goal of helping de-
crease global temperatures by 1.5 degrees 
Celsius. 
During my tenure in Congress, I have 
watched many infrastructure weeks pass by 
without results despite what I believed was an 
ardent commitment, but this administration has 
finally broken the trend. 
As the President said, because we have 
passed this legislation into law, we’re done 
talking about infrastructure weeks. 
We’re going to have an infrastructure dec-
ade. 
Because of the Bipartisan Infrastructure 
Law, we will build a national network of 
500,000 electric vehicle charging stations, 
begin to replace poisonous lead pipes so 
every child and every American has clean / 
water to drink at home and at school, and pro-
vide affordable high-speed internet for every 
American in urban, suburban, rural, and tribal 
communities. 
4,000 projects have already been an-
nounced. 
We will also begin to improve over 65,000 
miles of highway and 1,500 bridges in dis-
repair. 
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is a once- 
in-a-generation investment in our Nation’s in-
frastructure and competitiveness, and when its 
full scope is realized and implemented, all 
Americans will benefit regardless of socio-
economic status. 
Another landmark piece of legislation from 
this administration is the American Rescue 
Plan. 
COVID–19 brought about sweeping change 
at an unprecedented rate, much of this 
change had drastic impacts for Americans. 
People were laid off from their jobs, evicted 
from their homes, and in the worst cases 
passed on despite the heroic efforts of our 
medical professionals. 
But the American Rescue Plan provided a 
plan our country so desperately needed. 
It fueled our efforts to vaccinate the Nation 
and combat COVID–19. 
It delivered immediate economic relief for 
tens of millions of Americans. 
It helped put food on their table, keep a roof 
over their heads, and cut the cost of health in-
surance. 
And unlike the $2 Trillion tax cut passed in 
the previous administration that benefitted the 
top 1 percent of Americans, the American 
Rescue Plan helped working people—and left 
no one behind. 
Our economy created over 6.5 million new 
jobs just last year, more jobs created in one 
year than ever before in the history of Amer-
ica. 
Our economy grew at a rate of 5.7% last 
year, the strongest growth in nearly 40 years, 
the first step in bringing fundamental change 
to an economy that hasn’t worked for the 
working people of this Nation for too long. 
American children also greatly benefitted 
from the American Rescue Plan, considering 
the great impacts of the newly revamped Child 
Tax Credit. 
The American Rescue Plan increased the 
Child Tax Credit from $2,000 per child to 
$3,000 per child for children over the age of 
6 and from $2,000 to $3,600 for children 
under the age of 6, and raised the age limit 
from 16 to 17. 
It is the largest Child Tax Credit in the his-
tory of our Nation, pulling an estimated 3 mil-
lion children out of poverty. 
Despite the momentous impact the Child 
Tax Credit has, it will expire in the next fiscal 
year. 
It is therefore of the utmost importance to 
make these changes to the Child Tax Credit 
permanent. 
The CPC is determined to make this hap-
pen in this legislative session. 
We cannot delay this critical action by being 
privy to political dog whistles blown by Repub-
lican members of Congress, claiming this pol-
icy is socialist, communist, or whatever the 
outlandish claim of the day is. 
We must make the Child Tax Credit perma-
nent to ensure the prosperity of America and 
its children. 
What should also pique the interests and 
spark the hopes of Americans is the House’s 
recent passage of the COMPETES Act. 
This remarkable piece of legislation will take 
on inflation and rebuild U.S. supply chains that 
have been eroded by monopolies that stopped 
investing in America, bringing down costs for 
working people. 
Because of this bill, the American semicon-
ductor industry will take our reliance off the 
likes of China and allow us to chart a new 
course forward with economic self-sufficiency 
being the centerpiece. 
The America COMPETES Act will spur 
greater 
American 
production 
of 
chips, 
strengthen U.S. supply chains and strengthen 
American manufacturing, and advance U.S. 
scientific excellence and research. 
Thanks to CPC members’ amendments, the 
bill will also include policies to track carbon 
emissions and increase green climate funding, 
ensure women and workers of color are not 
left out of job creation in manufacturing, pre-
vent U.S. funding to countries with histories of 
human rights abuses, and insert guardrails 
against corporate self-enrichment. 
Through the amendment process, the Cau-
cus also secured the first vote in Congress on 
U.S. sanctions policy in Afghanistan and its 
humanitarian effects on civilian mortality and 
refugee outflows. 
The House has also in the past week over-
whelmingly passed the Emmitt Till Anti-Lynch-
ing Act. 
Though long overdue, the Act is sweeping 
in the respect that it makes lynching a hate 
crime, subjecting violators to criminal penalties 
like a prison term, a fine, or both. 
This legislation is critical in realizing a crimi-
nal justice system that prioritizes racial justice 
so no American so unjustly sees their end like 
Emmitt Till. 
Although it just concluded, Black History 
Month was established to teach the history 
that too often has not been taught: the history 
of Black excellence and leadership in America 
and also the history of resistance and resil-
ience in America. 
And let me be clear: Black history is Amer-
ican history. It is living, breathing history—his-
tory we create every day, across this Nation 
and on this Floor. 
And today, of course, our Nation faces 
many great challenges. 
Among the greatest is the assault on the 
freedom to vote—the freedom from which all 
others flow. 
It will take an all-hands-on-deck approach to 
safeguard and strengthen the freedom to vote. 
A hero in strengthening this right was my 
dear friend and colleague John Lewis. 
His passion was unending, symbolized by 
his leading of that Bloody Sunday march 
across the Edmund Pettus Bridge to Selma in 
March of 1965. 
Despite knowing he and others would be 
beaten, bloodied, bruised, and even arrested, 
he nonetheless marched onward. 
To highlight that pivotal moment history and 
pay homage to John Lewis, I and other mem-
bers of Congress will be making that same 
march later this week. 
Again, furthering his honor, the House 
passed the John Lewis Voting Rights Ad-
vancement Act.

This act would bolster voting rights by en-
larging the government’s capability to respond 
to voting discrimination. 
This piece of legislation is absolutely nec-
essary to ensure the right to vote is had by all 
Americans, a right our Founding Fathers envi-
sioned from the inception of this great Nation. 
The legacy of Congressman Lewis, a dear 
friend and colleague, and with us in spirit, 
must be dutifully honored. 
The Senate must immediately take up this 
legislation and pass it to truly fulfill Congress’ 
mandate of serving the people of this Nation. 
Despite the immense progress made so far 
in this administration, there is still work yet to 
be done. 
As the President emphasized last night, we 
must pass legislation to lower the costs of 
Pre-K, health care, home-based care, and 
housing, and to ensure that childcare doesn’t 
cost families more than 7 percent of their in-
come—all by finally making the wealthy and 
corporations pay their fair share. 
He underscored the need to take meaning-
ful action to address the climate crisis and de-
liver a roadmap to citizenship for immigrant 
communities. 
And as he said, ‘‘capitalism without competi-
tion is exploitation’’—and the Progressive Cau-
cus is similarly committed to taking on cor-
porate profiteering and monopolistic abuse. 
President Biden has significant power to ef-
fect immediate, meaningful change for people 
across America, and we urge him to use it ag-
gressively. 
The President can use his executive author-
ity to bring down the costs of prescription 
drugs and stop Big Pharma’s price gouging; 
decrease carbon emissions to fight the climate 
crisis; cancel student debt and bolster our 
economy; protect workers’ rights and raise 
their wages; and provide immigration relief 
and rebuild our refugee system. 
In the coming weeks, the Progressive Cau-
cus will release our executive action agenda 
for the President that details these steps, and 
more. 
‘‘Democrats in the White House and Con-
gress have shown how much we can accom-
plish in a year. 
If we remain steadfast to our commitment to 
providing relief our communities need, low-
ering costs, and making life easier for working 
people, we can deliver.’’ 
One step that must be taken to again seek 
racial justice is the passage of H.R. 40. 
H.R. 40 was initially introduced by the late 
Michigan Representative John Conyers, and I 
have introduced it in this Congress. 
This bill establishes the Commission to 
Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for 
African Americans. 
The commission shall examine slavery and 
discrimination in the colonies and the United 
States from 1619 to the present and rec-
ommend appropriate remedies. 
The commission shall identify the role of the 
federal and state governments in supporting 
the institution of slavery, forms of discrimina-
tion in the public and private sectors against 
freed slaves and their descendants, and lin-
gering negative effects of slavery on living Af-
rican Americans and society. 
This bill is the first step in righting the histor-
ical wrong that was slavery. 
The United States have given reparations to 
Japanese Americans who were wrongfully in-
terned, The Ottawas of Michigan, the Chip-
pewas of Wisconsin, the Seminoles of Florida, 
the Sioux of South Dakota, the Klamaths of 
Oregon, and the Alaska Natives all received 
some form of reparations from America be-
cause of the genocide they underwent. 
It is therefore only right that Black people 
receive reparations because of the history and 
oppression we have weathered and continue 
to. 
Who are also not strangers to oppression 
are the Ukrainian people at the bloodied 
hands of the autocrat Vladimir Putin. 
Black Americans underwent violence in the 
name of fully realizing their democracy, and 
now Ukrainians are doing the same. 
We fought in our own way, and though re-
grettable, now Ukrainians must as well. 
They will persevere, and President Putin will 
learn that democracy will never faulter in the 
face of cowardice and senseless aggression. 
In summation, while much has been done 
by this Congress, the CPC, and the adminis-
tration, we must continue to fight and secure 
a just, equitable, and prosperous future for the 
American people. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL 
EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO 
IRAN—MESSAGE 
FROM 
THE 
PRESIDENT 
OF 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES (H. DOC. NO. 117–98) 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following message 
from the President of the United 
States; which was read and, together 
with the accompanying papers, referred 
to the Committee on Foreign Affairs 
and ordered to be printed: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides 
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90 
days prior to the anniversary date of 
its declaration, the President publishes 
in the Federal Register and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to 
the Federal Register for publication the 
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency with respect to Iran 
that was declared on March 15, 1995, is 
to continue in effect beyond March 15, 
2022. 
The actions and policies of the Gov-
ernment of Iran continue to pose an 
unusual and extraordinary threat to 
the national security, foreign policy, 
and economy of the United States. 
For these reasons, I have determined 
that it is necessary to continue the na-
tional emergency declared in Executive 
Order 12957 with respect to Iran and to 
maintain in force comprehensive sanc-
tions against Iran to respond to this 
threat.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, we have enemies. Many 
strive to stop the march of freedom. 
Use our lawmakers to accomplish Your 
will on Earth. Give them the wisdom to 
trust Your precepts and depend upon 
Your guidance. Lord, judge our desires 
and thoughts, as You strengthen us 
with Your constant love. Thank You 
for the way You have helped us 
throughout our history. Spare us from 
the fate of those who do evil and sus-
tain us with Your prevailing mercies. 
Guard those who place their hope in 
You and keep them safe, enabling them 
to tell of Your wonderful deeds to fu-
ture generations. 
We pray in Your great Name. Amen.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest 
the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The majority leader is recognized. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, as 
spring begins, daily new cases of 
COVID–19 have dramatically decreased 
since the height of Omicron. Hos-
pitalizations, thank God, have steadily 
declined. Across the country, Ameri-
cans are able to remove their masks as 
the spread of disease seems to be less-
ening. Crucially, schools are open, and 
we need to do everything we can in our 
power to make sure they stay open. 
All of these signs point in a positive 
direction. The country is turning the 
corner on the COVID pandemic. We are 
in a new moment of the fight. 
But we also are at a crossroads. Ei-
ther we act now to secure the progress 
we have made, or we risk backsliding if 
another contagious variant emerges in 
the fall and winter. Just as we cannot 
allow COVID to rule our lives, neither 
can we fall into a false sense of compla-
cency. 
That is why the White House has re-
quested that Congress include $22.5 bil-
lion in additional COVID relief funding 
in the upcoming spending bill, and Con-
gress should follow through with this 
request over the coming days. If not, 
we risk sliding back if another variant 
occurs. 
This morning on CNBC, former FDA 
Commissioner Scott Gottlieb reminded 
viewers of the key aspect of this dis-
ease. To paraphrase him loosely, cases 
can drop in the spring and summer, but 
the risk still exists for another wave to 
surge in the fall or winter. He is right. 
We all know this from sad experience. 
We also know what we must do to be 
ready. We know a lot more now what 
to do to be ready than we knew a year 
ago. If we want to keep our schools 
open, if we want to keep life as close to 
normal as possible, if we want to be 
ready for the possibilities of future 
variants, Congress must provide the re-
sources needed before a new variant ar-
rives. That is the surest way to mini-
mize 
cases, 
hospitalizations, 
and 
deaths in the future. 
Let me repeat. To keep schools open, 
to keep life as normal as it can be, we 
need additional COVID investments 
now, not after a possible new variant 
arrives. 
Remember, by now, all public health 
funding provided by the American Res-
cue Plan has run out. If Congress waits 
until a new variant arises to pass new 
funding, it will be too late. 
And we are happy to make clear with 
our Republican colleagues about how 
this money is dedicated. The White 
House has already provided an expla-
nation about how COVID money has 
been spent over time. Some Repub-
licans may think it should have been 
spent differently, but the point is that

March 3, 2022 
it has been spent. We can’t pull those 
dollars back, and we need to provide 
new funding for possible variants. 
Where has the COVID money been 
spent thus far? It has gone to vaccinate 
215 million Americans. It has been used 
to keep schools open, to expand treat-
ment, and to provide 1.2 billion vac-
cines to other countries. 
Last night, Acting OMB Director 
Shalanda Young sent Congress a 12- 
page letter detailing what the new 
funding would do: more vaccines for 
children, bolstering our testing supply 
chain, therapeutics, and more. 
If there is one thing both parties 
should be able to agree on it is that we 
should not shortchange the American 
people on vaccines, on testing, or on 
therapeutic medicines that greatly re-
duce the severity of the illness if you 
are able to take them and if we have 
the supply. 
Again, Congress must include new 
funding for COVID relief to ensure our 
schools and our communities face 
minimal disruption in case another 
variant comes, and we should do it 
ASAP. The most logical place imme-
diately to do it is in the upcoming om-
nibus bill. 
INFLATION 
Mr. President, on another matter, on 
costs to the American people, in the 
coming months and beyond, Senate 
Democrats will maintain a focus on 
one of the most vexing issues facing 
American 
families: 
lowering 
costs 
while building on the wage and job 
growth we have seen over the past 
year. 
The American economy is booming 
compared to a year ago. The number of 
new jobs added to the economy is stag-
gering. We have added more than 6 mil-
lion new jobs in a single year, includ-
ing the most—the most—new manufac-
turing jobs in decades, but at the same 
time, we must fiercely confront the 
wave of rising costs resulting from 
COVID’s worldwide disruptions. This is 
the biggest economic challenge that 
our country must focus on right now. 
Later today, at our DPCC lunch, at 
the request of Chair STABENOW, FTC 
Commissioner Lina Khan will join us 
to shine a light on the troubling pat-
tern of corporate price hikes in the 
areas of oil and gas, prescription drugs, 
and other goods. 
This dimension of inflation cannot be 
ignored. Americans are being asked to 
pay more at the grocery store, at the 
pump, and for basic goods even as they 
watch incredulously as some of the Na-
tion’s biggest corporations post their 
most massive profits. 
In many instances, these profits re-
soundingly exceed prepandemic figures. 
Last fall, Bloomberg noted that U.S. 
corporations outside of the financial 
industry reported the biggest margins 
since 1950—since 1950—711⁄2 years ago. It 
appears corporate profits are far out-
pacing inflation, and they are spending 
much of the profits on things like cor-
porate buybacks, which are hitting 
record levels. So Americans are being 
asked to pay more, but many mega cor-
porations are making a killing. That is 
a twisted thing to see as we recover 
from COVID. 
Democrats are working right now on 
a number of proposals and ideas that 
would ease the pressure Americans are 
feeling from rising costs. We must 
lower the cost of insulin to $35 a 
month. We must make all prescription 
drugs cheaper. We need to help make 
groceries more affordable. We need to 
look at fixing ocean shipping bottle-
necks. 
I will also add that one of the best 
things we can do to fight inflation is to 
confirm President Biden’s nominees to 
the Federal Reserve. I urge in the 
strongest terms possible for Repub-
licans to drop their holds on these 
members. The Federal Reserve is so 
crucial for our economy right now, and 
to intentionally delay their confirma-
tions is irresponsible. 
Most importantly, we must boost 
manufacturing, 
American 
manufac-
turing, and decrease our reliance on 
overseas producers. The war provoked 
by Putin is an illustration as to why 
this example is important. 
President Biden’s State of the Union 
made clear that the United States re-
mains strong and ready to face the im-
mense challenges of our time, but to 
maintain that edge, we must focus like 
a laser on addressing costs. That is 
what Democrats will keep doing. 
Another thing we are doing today, 
that is happening today, is a hearing in 
the Commerce Committee on shipping 
costs and a bipartisan bill by Senators 
KLOBUCHAR and THUNE that will help 
reduce those costs. Shipping costs af-
fect every American. Any good that 
comes from overseas has to be shipped 
here. 
H.R. 3076 
Mr. President, on the post office, 
Democrats have been working all week 
with Republicans to push the biggest 
postal reform bill in years over the fin-
ish line, and, today, we are close. 
Today, we continue negotiations with 
the other side on their proposed list of 
amendments to the bill. 
As we continue to work on a deal, I 
filed cloture last night on the postal 
bill in order to keep the momentum 
going. At the end of the day, the vast 
majority of Democrats and Repub-
licans wants to see this bill sent to the 
President’s desk quickly, so I hope we 
can arrive at an agreement to finish 
before the weekend. 
I want to thank my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle for their contin-
ued work, especially Chairman PETERS 
and Ranking Member PORTMAN. 
This postal reform bill has been a 
long time coming, and when passed, it 
will ensure that tens of millions of 
Americans who rely on the post office 
every single day for medicines, Social 
Security checks, and other goods can 
make sure that the post office remains 
in good hands and is strengthened. 
ENDING FORCED ARBITRATION OF SEXUAL 
ASSAULT AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT ACT OF 2021 
Mr. President, finally, I want to close 
by noting, this afternoon, President 
Biden will sign into law bipartisan leg-
islation ending forced arbitration for 
sexual assault and sexual harassment. 
All of us have heard the searing testi-
monies—searing—of those who have 
faced harassment or abuse at work, 
only to discover their jobs offered pre-
cious little in accountability. Count-
less careers have been derailed or un-
done. Worse still, countless lives have 
been forever damaged. For decades, 
workplace practices like mandatory ar-
bitration have perpetuated cultures of 
abuse and unaccountability. 
We can’t ignore a basic reality of 
these clauses: They deprive victims of 
sexual harassment and assault of their 
basic rights by mandating that they 
seek remedy only behind the closed 
doors of private arbitration, with no 
other alternative. With the President’s 
signature today, that will come to an 
end. 
I want to thank Senator GILLIBRAND 
for leading the fight for years, and I am 
glad I was able to work with Senators 
GRAHAM and ERNST to push this bill 
over the finish line. 
By the end of today, we will be able 
to say: The Senate acted; the House 
acted; the President acted; and now 
forced arbitration reform is law. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Republican leader is recognized. 
NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, yes-
terday morning, I hosted Judge Ketanji 
Brown Jackson, the President’s nomi-
nee to replace Justice Breyer on the 
Supreme Court, in my office. I was glad 
to meet with Judge Jackson. We en-
joyed a cordial discussion. 
Like I have been saying, Republicans 
fundamentally believe the nominee, 
the Court, and the country all deserve 
better than the disgraceful displays 
that Senate Democrats have routinely 
visited on nominees of Republican 
Presidents. 
The 
Senate’s 
process 
should be dignified, but it also must be 
vigorous, exhaustive, and painstaking. 
We are talking about a lifetime ap-
pointment to our Nation’s highest 
Court. 
This is a moment when issues relat-
ing to the law and the judiciary are di-
rectly hitting American families, from 
skyrocketing murders and carjackings, 
to 
soft-on-crime 
prosecutors’ 
effec-
tively repealing laws, to open borders. 
This is also a moment when the far left 
has declared open season on the very 
concept of judicial independence itself.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S963 
March 3, 2022 
President Biden even bowed to the 
radicals and set up a Court-packing 
Commission. 
Now, 
Justice 
Breyer 
has 
distin-
guished himself by loudly and proudly 
putting those radicals in their place. 
He has consistently denounced the con-
cept of partisan Court packing and de-
fended the Court’s legitimacy. 
One would hope his successor would 
follow suit, but curiously the same 
radicals who want to turn Democrats 
into the party of Court packing also 
badly wanted Judge Jackson for this 
vacancy. It is a matter of record that 
this nominee was the anointed favorite 
of these fringe groups. At this time last 
year, they were already spending dark 
money to raise her profile. 
So I intend to explore why groups 
that are waging political war against 
the Court as an institution decided 
Judge Jackson was their special favor-
ite. 
Like I said, I enjoyed meeting the 
judge. She is clearly a sharp lawyer 
with an impressive resume, but when it 
comes to the Supreme Court, a core 
qualification is judicial philosophy. 
Our citizens need Justices who treat all 
parties fairly, apply our laws and Con-
stitution as written, and leave legis-
lating to us here in Congress. 
I raised all these matters yesterday. 
I look forward to gaining more clarity 
about Judge Jackson’s positions during 
the vigorous and thorough Senate proc-
ess to come. 
(Ms. ROSEN assumed the Chair.) 
VACCINES 
Madam President, now on another 
matter, our Nation faces serious chal-
lenges to our citizens’ health and 
wellness. COVID–19 has been one of 
them. Abuse of illegal drugs and pre-
scription pills is another. Heart dis-
ease, cancer, and diabetes are ever 
present. Many of these health crises hit 
Middle America especially hard and 
specifically rural America. 
Data show that rural Americans are 
disproportionately likelier to die from 
a number of potentially preventable 
causes. That is why I have been focused 
on expanding local treatment centers 
and telehealth and fighting the drug 
epidemic tooth and nail. 
Last week, I hosted Dr. Rahul Gupta, 
the administration’s drug czar, in Ken-
tucky. Opioid abuse is a staggering 
problem in our State and throughout 
the country. Last year, even during 
COVID, fentanyl abuse alone was the 
biggest cause of death among Ameri-
cans aged 18 to 45. That is not even all 
drugs, just fentanyl alone. 
In short, this may literally be the 
worst time in American history to de-
liberately cut healthcare access in 
rural America, but that is just what 
the Biden administration has done. 
President 
Biden 
told 
every 
thinly 
stretched doctor’s office and hospital 
that accepts Medicare that they had to 
fire workers who didn’t want the 
COVID vaccine. 
Now, I have been a consistent advo-
cate for getting vaccinated. They offer 
powerful personal protection against 
hospitalization and death, but they do 
not prevent people catching or trans-
mitting the current variant. There is 
no moral justification for sweeping 
mandates. The benefits accrue to the 
person who gets the shot. 
What is more, the CDC’s own re-
search says that prior infection pro-
vides protection that is at least as 
strong as the vaccines. But the Presi-
dent’s overreaching mandate ignores 
that. His policy unscientifically dis-
criminated against people who have 
immunity from prior infection. They 
had to comply anyway or lose their 
job. 
The President tried to force such a 
mandate on all kinds of workers across 
America. The courts slapped that down 
easily. But his mandate targeting 
healthcare workers remains in effect. 
It is unfair on a personal level, but 
even just looking at public health, it is 
terrible policy for rural America. We 
cannot have President Biden mass fir-
ing doctors and nurses when hospitals 
are already short-staffed. 
One 
hospital 
leader 
in 
Marshall 
County, KY, told me that ‘‘this is an 
absolute disaster. We are a small crit-
ical access hospital with 250 employees. 
. . . We have begun assessing areas 
that may have to be [literally] shut 
down.’’ 
A head of a hospital in Calloway 
County told me that ‘‘I can afford to 
lose not one more nurse.’’ He said the 
Biden mandate ‘‘makes no sense’’—no 
sense—‘‘for rural healthcare.’’ 
The head of a critical access hospital 
in Hardinsburg says that ‘‘the mandate 
is devastating for Kentucky hospitals.’’ 
Clearly, many of my colleagues are 
hearing similar things. Yesterday, over 
the objections of every Senate Demo-
crat who voted, Republicans stood up 
for Americans’ right and Americans’ 
healthcare access. We passed a resolu-
tion to overturn President Biden’s 
mandate that would drain doctors and 
nurses out of middle America. 
If Washington Democrats could safe-
ly hobnob in the Capitol all Tuesday 
evening with no masks, then they 
ought to stop pushing mass firings on 
essential health workers. 
Unfortunately, if we know anything 
about this Democratic House, this 
commonsense measure may well die on 
Speaker PELOSI’s desk. 
I sincerely hope our colleagues across 
the Capitol will see reason and pass 
this bill. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD NOMINATIONS 
Mr. COONS. Madam President, since 
President Biden took office, we have 
seen historic job growth and a dynamic 
economy. Wages are rising, and they 
are rising fastest for working-class 
Americans. 
But despite this significant economic 
progress, today, too many American 
families are still facing pressing eco-
nomic challenges: a global pandemic 
now entering its third year, ongoing 
disruptions to international supply 
chains that result in rising prices, and 
now the economic shocks caused by 
Putin’s aggression, his invasion of 
Ukraine and the response by the 
West—a united effort to impose sanc-
tions on Russia, which will also have 
consequences for the global economy. 
The Federal Reserve exists, in part, 
to address issues just like these. The 
Fed doesn’t just set interest rates and 
control our money supply; it oversees 
banks, ensures efficient and reliable 
payments, promotes consumer protec-
tion and community development. 
When our economy is facing such 
foundational challenges like the ones 
we are up against right now, it is cru-
cial 
our 
institutions 
are 
at 
full 
strength. 
The Fed is at its strongest with a full 
Board of Governors, and President 
Biden has nominated five of the finest 
economic and legal minds our country 
has to fill its vacancies: Jerome Pow-
ell, 
to 
serve 
as 
chair; 
and 
Lael 
Brainard, to serve as Vice Chair—both 
folks who have ably guided our econ-
omy in the years they have served at 
the Fed; Sarah Bloom Raskin, whom I 
know from college, has been nominated 
to serve as Vice Chair for Supervision 
and has demonstrated through a long 
career in public service at both the 
State and Federal level to be a highly 
competent regulator who has advanced 
the financial system that would work 
for all Americans; Philip Jefferson, 
nominated to serve as a Board Gov-
ernor, has deep expertise in how mone-
tary policy impacts employment and 
economic growth and an important un-
derstanding of inequality and poverty 
in America today; last, my good friend, 
Lisa Cook, whom I have known for dec-
ades. We knew each other as young 
Truman Scholars, folks who were vol-
unteering a week of our time to help 
mentor and encourage younger Truman 
Scholars—a federally funded memorial 
to President Harry Truman. 
I have known her since a stage in her 
life where neither one of us might have 
guessed that someday I would be on 
this floor speaking as a Senator, and I 
would be speaking in support of her 
nomination to the Federal Reserve. 
She would bring a valuable new per-
spective to the Fed Board. Lisa, from 
her time growing up in a small rural 
town in Georgia, going on to earn ad-
vanced degrees from our Nation’s finest 
institutions, and now as a teacher at 
one of our great public universities, she 
has built world-class expertise in eco-
nomics, innovation, and banking. She 
understands not just abstract economic 
theory but how those theories impact 
Americans and their families in all 
walks of life. 
Lisa served under President Obama 
at the White House Council of Eco-
nomic Advisers, where she dealt with 
financial crises both here in the United 
States and abroad, and she has studied 
the macroeconomics of foreign mar-
kets in Europe and in Africa, including 
the way central banks have dealt with

high inflation—one of the issues right 
before us. 
She has expertise in an emerging 
area of the economy that is increas-
ingly important for our central bank 
regulators to understand: digital cur-
rencies and financial technology. She 
has supported sensible regulation of 
cryptocurrencies that enables innova-
tion and allows more people to access 
secure and low-cost financial services. 
Her data-driven approach would help 
the Fed navigate our continued eco-
nomic recovery, and her focus on finan-
cial inclusion will be a critical perspec-
tive on the Fed Board that would help 
ensure all Americans can see the ben-
efit of continued economic growth and 
job gains. 
Overall, these are five nominees to 
the Fed Board with sterling credentials 
and strong character. All of them, on 
their merits, deserve the seats to which 
they have been nominated. 
I respect the desire on the part of my 
Republican colleagues to conduct a full 
evaluation of these nominees, and all 
five of them have responded repeat-
edly, fully, and with transparency to 
the hundreds of questions that have 
been pressed to them. They have an-
swered all the questions put to them. 
The time has come to advance and 
confirm these nominees, and I call 
upon my Republican colleagues to 
allow a vote to proceed. To block a 
vote in the Banking Committee of this 
Senate by simply denying a quorum is 
no way for this allegedly greatest de-
liberative body in the world to conduct 
itself. If we are, in fact, facing the cri-
sis of inflation and rising prices, the 
Federal Reserve Board must have its 
full membership. 
So my colleagues, please, stop block-
ing these capable and qualified nomi-
nees and allow them to proceed. 
NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON 
Madam President, I serve on the Sen-
ate Judiciary Committee. And in my 
dozen years here, I have had the honor 
of participating in, and even presiding 
over, confirmation hearings for Federal 
District Courts, Circuit Courts, and the 
Supreme Court. 
We have before us now President 
Biden’s first nominee to our Nation’s 
highest Court. Judge Ketanji Brown 
Jackson is an exceptionally well-quali-
fied jurist whose experience, whose cre-
dentials, and whose evenhanded ap-
proach to the administration of justice 
make her an outstanding nominee for 
the U.S. Supreme Court. 
This is an important step forward to-
ward making our Supreme Court look 
more like and reflect more the diver-
sity of people in our Nation and the di-
versity of experience of those who 
serve in the bar. 
Last year, Judge Jackson was con-
firmed by this Senate on a bipartisan 
basis to serve on the DC Circuit Court, 
one of the most complex and signifi-
cant of the circuit courts of the United 
States. Before that, she was unani-
mously confirmed to the U.S. District 
Court for the District of Columbia 
where she has honorably served for 8 
years. She has issued over 500 opinions, 
so we have a very clear idea of her ap-
proach to judging and her interpreta-
tion of the law; and she brings great 
professional diversity of experience to 
the Bench as well. 
If confirmed, she will be the only Su-
preme Court Justice to have served as 
a Federal public defender. That kind of 
perspective on our highest Court is 
critical. Her work as a public defender 
is just one example of the breadth of 
experience Judge Jackson will bring to 
the U.S. Supreme Court. 
She has also served as Vice Chair and 
Commissioner on the Sentencing Com-
mission that interprets and applies 
criminal law and as a lawyer in private 
legal practice for some of our Nation’s 
leading law firms. And, most impor-
tantly, she clerked for the Justice for 
whom she has been nominated as the 
successor, Justice Stephen Breyer. 
Our President has promised to nomi-
nate someone in the mold of Justice 
Breyer; and Judge Jackson—in tem-
perament, in ability, and approach— 
certainly fits that bill. It is my hope, it 
is my expectation, that this Senate and 
the Senate Judiciary Committee will 
meet this historic moment by swiftly, 
appropriately, and respectfully ques-
tioning this nominee in front of the 
Senate Judiciary Committee, bringing 
her to a vote on the committee, and 
then voting to confirm her nomination 
here on the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR NOMINATIONS 
Madam President, if I might, the last 
topic I come to speak to on this floor 
today is the critical need for us to be 
as attentive to the advice and consent 
role for nominees as ambassadors, as 
senior members of the State Depart-
ment, and USAID positions. 
There are so many positions that 
have been held for months and months; 
and many of them are being held by my 
colleague from the State of Texas be-
cause of a disagreement over sanc-
tioning the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. 
Today, finally, we stand in a place 
where the policy of this administra-
tion, the policy of our close and valued 
ally in Europe, Germany, and the posi-
tions of folks in the Senate are all 
aligned. There are now sanctions on 
Nord Stream 2. It has been stopped. 
Thankfully, my colleague has lifted 
his holds. Yet there still remain holds 
from other Members of this body on 
other nominees, all of them well-quali-
fied. Eight of them would serve under 
the jurisdiction of my Foreign Rela-
tions Committee subcommittee on eco-
nomic and energy policy multilateral 
organizations. 
So while I respect the right of my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to 
hold a nominee for a specific, relevant 
policy issue, we have to provide advice 
and consent in a timely and respectful 
manner of the President’s nominees. 
President Biden has been President 
more than a year now. We have crises 
all over the world—whether it is in 
Ukraine, the violence and the aggres-
sion carried out by Putin’s Russia or 
its competition with China or its deal-
ing with North Korea or its advancing 
our interest with respect to Iran and 
their proliferation—we have places all 
over the world for which we need quali-
fied nominees. 
That is why, in a few moments, I 
hope to take action on the floor; but I 
am not yet going to take that action 
unless it is clear we are all prepared. 
Let me briefly, in conclusion, if I 
might, speak to some of the folks who 
should be confirmed. 
The Ambassador to Botswana, How-
ard Van Vranken, career foreign serv-
ice officer in a country I have visited, 
a country that is an important partner 
to allies in Southern Africa, and where 
the absence of an ambassador means an 
absence of American leadership. 
Eric Garcetti, mayor of Los Angeles, 
ready to serve as our Ambassador to 
India, a country that is a continent- 
wide, multifaith, multilingual, multi-
ethnic democracy—a vital partner and 
ally to the United States where we cur-
rently have no ambassador. 
Marcia Bernicat to be Director Gen-
eral of the Foreign Service. If we are to 
recruit, retain, motivate, and place the 
greatest diplomats possible in the 
world, we need a Director General—a 
DG—who leads the Foreign Service 
from a human resources perspective. 
Julieta Noyes to be Assistant Sec-
retary for Population, Refugees, and 
Migration. A million refugees have fled 
the violence in Ukraine; and yet PRM 
has no Senate-confirmed Assistant Sec-
retary. Think about that as a derelic-
tion of duty by this body. 
Oren Whyche-Shaw to be Ambassador 
to the African Development Bank. If 
we want to see inclusive development 
on the continent of Africa, how can we 
have no ambassador for this multilat-
eral development bank? 
Enoh Ebong to be Director of the 
United States Trade and Development 
Agency, the USTDA. TDA plays a crit-
ical role in bringing into the United 
States opportunities for trade and de-
velopment—again, a critical vacant 
seat. 
Christopher Hill to serve as Ambas-
sador to Serbia. There are develop-
ments in the Balkans too complex and 
concerning for me to take this body’s 
time with right now. But let me simply 
say, any seat, any ambassadorial post 
in the Balkans vacant is a missed op-
portunity for American leadership. 
Laura Holgate to be Ambassador to 
the Vienna Office of the United Nations 
and Representative to the IAEA. We 
are engaged in critical final-stage ne-
gotiations, I am told, in Vienna about 
whether or not we will be able to fur-
ther constrain and better understand 
Iran’s dangerous conduct with regards 
to enrichment. We have no ambassador 
to the IAEA. Think about how irre-
sponsible that is. 
If I might, we cannot confront our 
global challenges alone, and we need 
these diplomats in place so we can suc-
cessfully address these threats from

It is my hope that my colleagues who 
have holds reportedly on many of these 
nominees will relent, and I look for-
ward to continuing to press that case 
today. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask

RELATING TO A NATIONAL EMER-
GENCY 
DECLARED 
BY 
THE 
PRESIDENT ON MARCH 13, 2020 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Committee on 
Finance is discharged from further con-
sideration of S.J. Res. 38, and the Sen-
ate will proceed to the consideration of 
the joint resolution, which the clerk 
will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A joint resolution (S.J. Res. 38) relating to 
a national emergency declared by the Presi-
dent on March 13, 2020. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, there will be 3 
hours for debate only, with time equal-
ly divided between the two leaders or 
their designees. 
The Republican whip. 
ENERGY 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, as of Jan-
uary, energy prices were up 27 percent 
across the board. Gas prices were up 40 
percent from a year ago. Natural gas 
was up 24 percent. Fuel oil was up 46 
percent. 
High energy prices have a huge im-
pact on our economy. Obviously, they 
represent a significant, direct burden 
on Americans trying to fill up their 
cars or pay the utility bills, but they 
also contribute to price hikes across 
our economy. High gas prices and other 
energy costs contribute to price in-
creases on a whole host of other goods. 
Manufacturers facing higher transpor-
tation costs thanks to high gas prices, 
for example, are often forced to pass on 
at least some of those increased costs 
to consumers in the form of price 
hikes. 
Now, while Democrats helped create 
our current inflation crisis with their 
so-called American Rescue Plan spend-
ing spree last March, President Biden 
is not solely responsible for high en-
ergy prices. He is responsible, however, 
for the fact that he is pursuing an en-
ergy agenda that is almost guaranteed 
not only to increase American energy 
prices long term but also to increase 
our reliance on foreign sources of en-
ergy. 
Since the day he took office, Presi-
dent Biden has pursued an agenda that 
is hostile to conventional sources of 
energy; namely, oil and natural gas. 
When it comes to energy, he is focused 
almost exclusively on alternative en-
ergy technology—specifically on elec-
tric vehicles, which his administration 
has clearly picked as its preferred win-
ner in the clean energy stakes. 
Now, I should say I am a longtime 
supporter of clean energy. In South Da-
kota, we derive a significant amount of 
our energy from hydropower and wind. 
In fact, in 2020, 80 percent of our util-
ity-scale 
generation 
was 
renewal, 
about half of that from hydro. I have 
long championed cleaner burning re-
newable fuels like ethanol and bio-
diesel. 
But the fact of the matter is, our Na-
tion 
is 
not 
going 
to 
be 
fully 
transitioning to 100 percent zero-emis-
sion energy anytime soon no matter 
how much the administration would 
like it to. There are a lot of hurdles to 
be crossed before we can rely solely on 
clean energy. Consumers, first and 
foremost, need affordable and reliable 
energy supplies, especially consistent 
baseload energy. 
Clean energy technology has simply 
not advanced to the point where it 
needs to be in order for us to rely on 
clean energy exclusively. We are going 
to need an ‘‘all of the above’’ energy 
portfolio for a while yet, including oil 
and natural gas, and it is a disservice 
to the American people to pretend oth-
erwise. 
We should absolutely continue to in-
vest in clean energy and pursue clean 
energy technologies in a fiscally re-
sponsible manner, but we also have to 
ensure that our Nation has the oil and 
natural gas that it needs for our econ-
omy to run and for Americans to be 
able to afford to heat their homes and 
to get where they need to go. 
As I said, since taking office, Presi-
dent Biden has pursued an agenda hos-
tile—hostile—to conventional energy 
production. He set the tone on his first 
day in office when he canceled the Key-
stone XL Pipeline—an environmentally 
responsible pipeline project that was 
already underway and that was to be 
paired with $1.7 billion in private in-
vestment in renewable energy to fully 
offset its operating emissions. He also 
almost immediately froze new oil and 
gas leases on Federal lands, sending a 
clear signal to oil and gas producers 
that his administration would be reluc-
tant to work with them to increase 
American energy production. 
He has continued along the same 
lines ever since. He seems to think that 
he can hurry along the clean energy fu-
ture he dreams of by discouraging oil 
and natural gas production here at 
home, but he can’t. As I said, clean en-
ergy sources are simply not at the 
point where they can solely power 
American homes or our economy. 
The only effect of curbing conven-
tional energy production would be to 
force Americans to rely more on for-
eign sources of oil and natural gas, and 
that is a big problem. It is a big prob-
lem. It is a problem because the more 
we rely on foreign sources of energy, 
the more vulnerable Americans are to 
energy price spikes and to global short-
ages. It is a problem because relying on 
foreign sources of energy often means 
relying on energy from tyrannical gov-
ernments in volatile areas of the world. 
U.S. imports of Russian energy have 
spiked during the Biden administra-
tion, 
and 
the 
current 
conflict 
in 
Ukraine is a reminder of just how big 
of a problem that is. In the first place, 
the dollars we or other nations spend 
importing energy from Russia are dol-
lars Russia is free to use to prosecute 
its unjustified invasion of Ukraine and 
any other country that it decides to at-
tack. In the second place, when you 
rely on another country for your en-
ergy needs, you end up beholden to 
that country. 
Now, while we have imposed heavy 
sanctions on Russia, we have yet to di-
rectly sanction Russia’s energy sector, 
and other countries have also held 
back on sanctioning Russian energy. 
There is little question that this reluc-
tance stems from both fears of price 
hikes as a result of sanctions and from 
fears of lessening the availability of 
Russian energy supplies. 
The truth is, we should be sanc-
tioning Russia’s energy sector. Energy 
production is the lifeblood of the Rus-
sian economy, and sanctioning Russian 
energy would be one of the most effec-
tive ways of halting Putin’s imperial 
ambitions. 
It is unfortunate that the President 
has not put our Nation on stronger 
footing energy-wise so that we could 
more easily weather these challenging 
times. The only acceptable American 
energy policy is an ‘‘all of the above’’ 
energy policy that invests in both 
clean energy technologies and conven-
tional energy sources. That is the only 
way—the only way—to keep energy 
prices down and ensure America’s en-
ergy needs are met no matter what is 
going on in energy-producing countries 
around the globe. 
Now, if the President really wants to 
lower energy prices for American fami-
lies, as he indicated in his State of the 
Union Address on Tuesday, he could re-
verse his rejection of the Keystone XL 
Pipeline, which would be a much wel-
come recognition that liquid fuels will 
be part of our energy composition well 
into the future. 
He could fast-track environmentally 
responsible domestic oil and gas pro-
duction on Federal lands. 
He could work to overturn the Fed-
eral Energy Regulatory Commission 
decision that will make it more dif-
ficult to get approval for natural gas 
pipelines. 
He could ensure that the Department 
of the Interior releases new land for re-
sponsible oil and gas development— 
something the Department is required 
to do quarterly by law. 
He could encourage financial institu-
tions to invest in conventional energy 
production and reinstate the January

2021 proposed rule that would prevent 
large American financial institutions 
from blacklisting the conventional en-
ergy sector. 
Finally, he could also get serious 
about leveraging American agriculture 
as an energy solution, specifically re-
storing integrity to the renewable fuel 
standard. This means not only setting 
robust blending targets and rejecting 
specious small refinery exemptions but 
approving advanced fuels from corn 
kernel fiber and restoring the year- 
round sale of E15. 
These 
measures 
and 
others 
like 
them, combined with clean energy in-
vestment, would help lower energy 
prices now and in the future and help 
put our Nation on a path to long-term, 
full energy independence. It is the best 
decision President Biden could make 
for American families struggling with 
high energy prices, and it is the best 
decision he could make for the long- 
term security of our country. 
I hope he will rethink his hostility to 
conventional energy production and 
spend the next year of his administra-
tion embracing the kind of ‘‘all of the 
above’’ energy strategy that this Na-
tion so desperately needs. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I re-
serve the right to object. I will say to 
Senator THUNE while he is still on the 
floor, he knows I have great respect for 
him and his views on all kinds of 
issues. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator, 
there is nothing to object to. 
Mr. CARPER. All right. Then I will 
just wing it. When I do have the oppor-
tunity to object, I want to explain why. 
Having said that, Senator THUNE 
knows we look for opportunities to 
work together. This is just one of those 
instances where we don’t see entirely 
eye to eye. 
Mr. President, right now, the Amer-
ican people face two existential threats 
to our way of life. One is the threat 
really to the world order posed not so 
much by Russia but by Putin, the 
President of that country. The other is 
the threat of climate change. 
The legislation we are discussing 
today assumes that we must ignore the 
threats of climate change in order to 
wean our Nation off of foreign oil from 
countries like Russia, but this is a 
false choice. 
Since the Arab oil embargo of 1973, 
some have argued that if we simply 
drill more oil, we can be free of the 
price whiplash caused by international 
disruptions in the global oil market. 
This wasn’t true during the Arab oil 
embargo. It wasn’t true during the Ira-
nian revolution. It wasn’t true during 
the 1990 Gulf war or, more recently, 
during the Iraq war. And it is not true 
today. Yet the legislation before us 
clings to a false understanding of oil 
markets. We have drilled more, but the 
oil prices that we pay are still im-
pacted by global events. 
Instead, we need policies that help 
our economy smoothly transition off of 
oil, while at the same time give con-
sumers more choices to fuel their cars, 
their trucks, and their vans. We need 
to give consumers real fuel choices 
that are domestically produced, better 
for the climate, and that aren’t tied to 
global oil markets. The choices could 
include electricity from nuclear en-
ergy, an issue on which the Presiding 
Officer and I strongly agree; biofuels 
made by our farmers, which Senator 
THUNE strongly agrees and has alluded 
to; and fuel cells running on clean hy-
drogen produced in many cases by our 
refineries. All of these options are 
things that we should be pursuing— 
that we should be pursuing—and on 
which there is wide consensus. In doing 
so, we buffer our economy against the 
threat of Russia and the threat of cli-
mate change. 
With that, when it is appropriate for 
me to object, I am ready to object. 
I am yielding the floor to our col-
league from Missouri, Senator HAWLEY. 
And let me say to him, I don’t object 
lightly, and my hope is that we will— 
we haven’t had a chance to talk about 
this before today, but I look forward to 
that conversation in the days ahead. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 3741 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, I rise 
today in opposition to this administra-
tion’s dangerous policy of American 
weakness and in support of the strong 
men and women of the United States’ 
energy sector, who are ready to step 
forward to return this Nation to energy 
independence, to burnish this Nation’s 
strength, and to show the Russians 
what the United States is capable of. 
It will be lost on no one that we are 
approximately a week into the largest 
conventional military attack in Europe 
since 1945. Vladimir Putin’s brutal war 
of choice against the Ukrainians con-
tinues as we speak. It grows worse, 
more devastating, and more brutal by 
the hour, and it is time that, in the 
midst of this war, we confronted a 
basic fact: that Russia isn’t so much a 
country as it is a gas station, and 
Vladimir Putin’s gas station is open for 
business and pumping away, and this 
administration—this administration— 
has made the decision to make this 
country more dependent on Russian 
oil, to make the world more dependent 
on Russian oil, to embolden and em-
power Vladimir Putin at a time when 
the world can ill afford it, and it is 
time to change course. 
And we can change course. We can 
change our energy production policy. 
We can open up our energy sector to 
make us once again the dominant en-
ergy producer in the world, to make us 
truly energy independent, to make us 
energy strong, to put Russia in its 
place, and to put the United States at 
the head of the energy sector world-
wide. 
But that is not where we stand right 
now. Today, the United States is im-
porting—in the midst of this conflict, 
in the midst of Russian aggression, the 
United States is importing—buying 
from Russia to the tune of 670,000 bar-
rels of oil every single day. It has near-
ly doubled just in the past year. 
Now, I would submit to you that 
whatever you think about this admin-
istration’s geostrategic policies—this 
is, after all, an administration that has 
managed to lose two sovereign nations 
in the space of 6 months—whatever you 
think of that record, this is not sus-
tainable. This is not good for the 
world. This makes America weaker, 
not stronger, and this is a time for 
American strength. 
What did Joe Biden do when he came 
to the Office of the President of the 
United States just over a year ago? 
Well, among his first actions was to 
cancel the Keystone Pipeline, to halt a 
leasing program in Alaska, to issue a 
halt on all new oil and gas leases, as 
well as drilling permits on Federal 
lands and Federal waters. By the way, 
that accounts for about 25 percent of 
U.S. energy production. 
He directed Federal Agencies to get 
rid of all support for fossil fuels. He im-
posed new regulations on oil and gas 
and methane emissions. He hired new 
SEC regulators to propose new climate 
regulations, and the list goes on and 
on. 
And these policies have had their ef-
fect. I will give the President credit 
where credit is due. His policies to 
throttle down our energy production 
have been successful. He has succeeded 
in making this Nation energy depend-
ent. 
In 2019, in 2020—for the first time, 
certainly, in my lifetime—the United 
States actually exported more energy 
than it imported. We were energy inde-
pendent, and, even better, we were be-
coming the energy supplier for the 
world. 
Who is the energy supplier for the 
world now? It is Vladimir Putin, and 
that is because, at least in part, of the 
policies that this administration and 
President 
Biden 
have 
deliberately 
sought to pursue. 
Look, the statistics don’t lie. Why is 
Russia able to pursue this war of ag-
gression in Ukraine? 
Well, at least in part because of this: 
They supply 20 percent of Europe’s 
oil—Russia alone, 20 percent of Eu-
rope’s oil—40 percent of its gas, 20 per-
cent of its coal. Russia supplies to the 
tune of 55 percent of Germany’s nat-
ural gas alone—just Germany’s, 55 per-
cent. Now, can we wonder why our Ger-
man partners were slow to want to 
sanction Russia, to provide lethal aid 
to Ukraine when they needed it before 
the invasion occurred? It is because 
Russia has Europe in a stranglehold. 
And that should be no excuse. I am 
not saying that the Europeans deserve 
an out—not at all. But I am saying 
that Vladimir Putin has used his 
power, his energy production, to try 
and project new power in Europe, and, 
unfortunately, he is having success.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S967 
March 3, 2022 
It ought to be our policy to reverse 
his power projection, to shut down his 
gas stations—his gas station of a coun-
try—by returning this country to en-
ergy independence and energy domi-
nance, and we can do it. 
This is not a pie-in-the-sky pipe 
dream. We have been there before. We 
were just energy independent, just a 
few years ago. We know what to do. It 
is actually pretty simple. All we have 
to do is roll back the disastrous poli-
cies that this administration imposed 
just a year ago, roll those back and 
allow the American worker to get back 
to work on our pipelines, on our rigs, 
drilling and pumping natural gas and 
producing biofuels like the ones that 
we produce, the kind that we produce 
in my State. Put American energy 
back to work. It is actually pretty sim-
ple. 
Sometimes, 
Ronald 
Reagan 
once 
said, there actually are simple solu-
tions, not easy ones but simple ones. 
This one is simple, it is direct, and it is 
time that we took it. 
And that is why I have introduced 
legislation, along with Senator GRASS-
LEY and Senator HAGERTY and Senator 
TUBERVILLE, that would do just this. It 
would reverse the disastrous energy 
policies of this administration, the 
policies that have emboldened and en-
abled and empowered Vladimir Putin 
and the Russian military, and return 
this country to energy strength, return 
this country to energy dominance. 
I can’t put it any better than this: If 
you will give—if the President of the 
United States would give—the Amer-
ican worker a chance—give the folks 
who man those pipelines, give the folks 
who work the oil rigs—give them a 
chance to show what they can do, and 
I will tell you what they will show you: 
They will show you that they are the 
best in the world. They will show you 
that they are the strongest in the 
world. They will show you that this 
country is the strongest in the world, 
and they will put the Russian energy 
sector to shame. 
And, by the way, Joe Biden’s policy 
was to green-light the Russian pipe-
line, Putin’s pipeline, Nord Stream 2. 
He lifted sanctions on it when he came 
to office; imposed limits on our own en-
ergy production but lifted them on the 
Russians. 
Here is a suggestion: Shut down 
Putin’s pipelines. Shut down Putin’s 
energy sector. Open ours up. Do just 
the opposite of what President Biden 
did a year ago. Shut down the Russian 
energy production, open up American 
energy protection, and show the world 
what the American people can do. 
And that is what the bill that I have 
introduced, along with my cosponsors, 
who I am proud to have with me—that 
is what it would do. It is very simple, 
Mr. President, and I would suggest to 
you that the time is of the essence. 
I ask unanimous consent that the 
Committee on Energy and Natural Re-
sources be discharged from further con-
sideration of S. 3714 and the Senate 
proceed to its immediate consider-
ation. I further ask unanimous consent 
that the bill be considered read a third 
time and passed and that the motion to 
reconsider be considered made and laid 
upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. CARPER. Reserving the right to 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, our col-
league from Missouri was not on the 
floor when I spoke earlier. I want him 
to have the opportunity to hear some 
of the concerns that I and a lot of other 
people in this Chamber and this coun-
try have with respect to the request 
that he is making. 
So I reserve the right to object, and 
let me just take a minute or two to 
again state why that is. 
Today, the American people face two 
existential threats to our way of life. 
No. 1 is the threat to the world order 
posed not by the Russian people but by 
Vladimir Putin, their leader. And the 
other is the threat of climate change to 
us. 
We just received from the National 
Oceanographic and Atmospheric Ad-
ministration an update 2 weeks ago 
about what it is going to look like in 
this country in the years to come. 
We have already seen the sea level 
rise roughly a foot in the last several 
decades, and what we are going to see 
in the years to come is more of the 
same, only faster. 
If you add up the GDP of every coast-
al county in this country—from the 
east coast, the gulf coast, the west 
coast, the Great Lakes—it adds up to a 
GDP that would be making the third 
largest country in the world. And what 
we are going to see is a great assault— 
a continued assault—on those coastal 
counties, whether it is New Jersey or 
whether it is Delaware, whether it is 
Louisiana, California—whatever. 
In Louisiana, they lose to the sea 
every 100 minutes a piece of land the 
size of a football field. The Presiding 
Officer spent some time on a football 
field. And every 100 minutes—think 
about that—the size of land in Lou-
isiana, the size of a football field goes 
back to the sea. 
Our State of Delaware is the lowest 
lying State in the country. The seas 
around us are rising. My State is sink-
ing. We have seen, gosh, five storms on 
the west coast bigger than my State. 
We have seen winds—hurricane-force 
winds—in Iowa destroying like half the 
crops. We have seen temperatures—90- 
degree temperatures—in the Arctic 
Circle, the hottest summers on record 
year after year after year. Something 
is happening here. 
And with apologies to Stephen Stills, 
it is exactly clear. And what the prob-
lem is—it is way too much carbon in 
our air, and it is increasing. We need to 
address that. We need to address that 
in ways that will actually create jobs, 
a lot of good-paying jobs. I think we 
can agree on that, and that is what we 
ought to be doing. 
So having said that, the legislation 
we are discussing assumes that we 
must ignore the threats of climate 
change in order to wean our Nation off 
of foreign oil from countries like Rus-
sia. This is a false choice. This is a 
false choice. 
Since the Arab oil embargo of 1973, 
some have argued that if we simply 
drill for more oil, we can be free of the 
price whiplash caused by international 
disruptions in the global oil market. 
This was not true during the Arab oil 
embargo. This was not true during the 
Ukrainian revolution. It was not true 
during the 1990 Gulf war or, more re-
cently, during the Iraq war, and it is 
not true today. 
Yet the legislation before us today 
clings to false understanding of oil 
markets. We have drilled more, but the 
oil prices we pay are still impacted by 
global events. 
Instead, we need policies that help 
our economy smoothly transition off of 
oil, providing good-paying jobs for a lot 
of Americans, while at the same time 
giving consumers more choices in the 
way that we fuel our vehicles—our 
trucks, our cars, our vans. 
We need to give consumers real fuel 
choices that are domestically pro-
duced, better for the climate, and that 
are not tied to the global oil market. 
The choices could include electricity 
from nuclear energy, something the 
Presiding Officer and I and others 
agree on. The choices could include the 
biofuels made by our farmers, some-
thing that Senator THUNE was speak-
ing about earlier. The choices could in-
clude fuel cells running on clean hydro-
gen produced by our refineries. All 
these options are things we should be 
pursuing. As it turns out, if we do—and 
there is a lot of bipartisan support for 
doing what I have just outlined—we 
will actually address this climate crisis 
that we face on this planet, and we will 
produce one heck of a lot of jobs for 
people throughout this Nation. In 
doing so, we buffer our economy 
against the threat of Russia and the 
very real threat of climate change. 
And with that, reluctantly, I must 
object to the gentleman’s unanimous 
consent request. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from Missouri. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, I want 
to thank the Senator from Delaware 
for his remarks, which I appreciate. It 
is a privilege to serve with him, as we 
do, on the Homeland Security Com-
mittee, and work with him as we do— 
as I have—and I look forward to work-
ing together, hopefully on this issue, 
and others in the future. 
We do disagree on this issue. We have 
an honest and, I think, principled dis-
agreement. It is one that we ought to 
talk about. I am glad we are talking 
about it here today, and I suspect it is 
one, ultimately, that the American 
people are going to have to weigh in on

because the differences are pretty sig-
nificant. And that is fine. That is de-
mocracy. 
But I just want to highlight two 
things where I think we have a prin-
cipled disagreement. The first is the 
idea that, if we produce more energy in 
this country, it won’t have any effect 
on prices, energy prices, or make us en-
ergy independent. 
I would just ask the American peo-
ple, I mean: Does gas cost more today 
than it did before Joe Biden became 
President? Yes, it does. Are you paying 
more for groceries? Are you paying 
more, if you are a farmer, for fertilizer? 
Are you paying more for every input 
that is associated with energy today 
than before Joe Biden was President? 
Unfortunately, yes, you are. 
Inflation is out of control in this 
country. Inflation associated with the 
fuel that Americans use to fill up their 
trucks and their vans and that they use 
to heat their homes is out of control, 
and there is a reason for that. This is 
the reason for that. We are not pro-
ducing energy in this country like we 
were. We were energy independent in 
2019 and 2020. It is not as if it can’t be 
done. It has been done. Prices were 
lower. It is basic supply and demand. 
But there is also a national security 
aspect to this. Why would we want to 
be dependent on a totalitarian state 
that is invading its neighbors and is 
seeking to establish energy control of 
Europe and beyond? 
Why wouldn’t we seek to thwart it? 
And why would we ask the American 
people to pay more, day in and day out, 
to heat their homes, for fuel for their 
cars? Why would we put them through 
that? Why would we ask them to do 
that? 
I just submit to you that there is a 
real tradeoff here, and the administra-
tion has chosen the wrong side of the 
tradeoff. Put the American energy sec-
tor back to work. 
One other comment. I know that the 
Special Presidential Envoy for Cli-
mate, former Senator Kerry, has ex-
pressed similar concerns about climate 
change and has said recently that he 
fears that the crisis in Ukraine will 
distract from the urgency of climate 
change. 
Well, I submit to you that the crisis 
in Ukraine—the existential threat to 
that proud and sovereign nation which 
is now in danger of being extinguished, 
the threat to stability in Europe that 
Russia now exerts, and the threat that 
China will exert to the world—yes, in-
deed, that may distract from climate 
change, but that is just reality. It is 
time we face the most pressing secu-
rity threats that we have. And putting 
Americans back to work and lowering 
their gas prices and their fuel prices, 
making American families safer and 
more secure and making our enemies 
less secure, that is a good policy, and it 
is one that I hope we can have. 
So, again, I thank my colleague and 
my friend, the Senator from Delaware, 
and I suspect it won’t be the last time 
we talk about this. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from Iowa. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, 2 
years ago this month, things started 
shutting down due to COVID. We shut 
down the American economy; basi-
cally, 22 million people, all of a sudden, 
were unemployed. I think we learned a 
lot in the last 2 years, and if we have 
another pandemic, I don’t think we 
would do it that way again. I think we 
have learned a lot from mistakes, and 
a lot of bad mistakes resulted from 
that decision. 
So, in March 2020, employees were 
furloughed or sent home to work from 
home; schools were closed; events were 
canceled. Everyone was told to stay 
home. 
Now, 2 years later, a lot has changed 
in the fight against COVID. Tests and 
treatments have been developed. Any-
one who wants a vaccine can get one. 
High-quality masks are available free 
for anyone who chooses to wear a 
mask. Those masks protect the one 
wearing it, regardless of the choices of 
others around them, whether they 
make a choice to wear a mask or not. 
Restaurants, 
theaters, 
and 
sports 
venues are filling back up again. De-
mand 
for 
air 
travel 
is 
above 
prepandemic levels. 
Yet our Federal Government remains 
frozen in time, operating as if it were 
still the spring of 2020. Federal Agen-
cies remain shuttered to the taxpayers 
who fund it. Expensive office buildings 
in downtown DC are sitting deserted. 
Fifty percent of the executive branch 
workforce is still working remotely, 
and most have no plans to return to 
the office. 
Some Agencies, such as the Veterans’ 
Administration, had previously an-
nounced efforts to return to in-person 
work. Those plans have been indefi-
nitely postponed. The U.S. Capitol 
Building, where we are right now, is 
closed to the public, despite nearly 
every State capitol building in the 
country finding a way to reopen. 
Federal employees are here, as we all 
know, to serve the taxpayers. Agencies 
like the Veterans’ Administration, the 
Internal Revenue Service, and Social 
Security Administration that are re-
sponsible for processing benefits and 
tax refunds need to be fully oper-
ational. It is pretty plain and simple. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture 
Farm Service offices, located in every 
Iowa county and most counties in most 
States, are responsible for signing up 
farmers for the Conservation Reserve 
Program and for crop insurance. Right 
now, those county offices are the busi-
est as farmers prepare for the upcom-
ing crop year. These county offices still 
require employees to work from home. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture 
employees have to meet with farmers 
to go over detailed maps of their land, 
making it nearly impossible even with 
video calls. I have received letters from 
farmers and USDA employees alike 
who are frustrated that they can’t have 
in-person meetings. 
We all know that backlogs persist 
across the Federal Government and 
show no signs of abating. The National 
Personnel Records Center, responsible 
for providing service records to vet-
erans seeking their benefits, has not 
been fully staffed since March of 2020. 
They have a backlog of records. Those 
requests are so massive that it would 
take years to correct. For 2 years now, 
the Agency has been processing emer-
gency requests only while the other re-
quests just pile up. This Agency needs 
employees in the office to function. 
They are currently staffed at just 25 
percent capacity. They have announced 
that they will not return to full oper-
ational status until ‘‘the public health 
emergency has ended.’’ 
Now, who knows when that will hap-
pen? 
I guess veterans waiting to finish 
their application for benefits will just 
have to wait as well. 
Now, we know the abysmal record of 
the IRS. It only answered 9 percent of 
its calls, and those are called customer 
support calls. They are already warn-
ing that this tax filing season is going 
to be a mess for those filing, and there 
is still a backlog of unprocessed re-
turns from last year. Yet thousands of 
IRS employees remain out of the of-
fice. 
Those trying to become U.S. citizens 
have been stuck in limbo for years. 
Records that the USCIS needs to proc-
ess their applications are locked in the 
Federal records centers which are only 
open 25 percent of capacity. 
Even a few Agencies that have an-
nounced a plan to return to in-person 
work are not acting with any sense of 
urgency. The Social Security Adminis-
tration announced the reopening of 
field offices in April. So I guess they 
figure those who have already been 
waiting for 2 years can wait another 2 
months. 
My staff who help Iowans with their 
casework told me that the average 
number of days to get assistance from 
a Federal Agency has doubled now to 
335 days. It takes almost a year to get 
an issue with a Federal Agency re-
solved. This is completely unaccept-
able. 
In the spring of 2020, it seemed as if 
there was no choice. Caution at that 
time was warranted. But I might re-
mind the heads of Federal Agencies 
that even at that time, millions of 
Americans did not work from home. We 
saw it on television all the time, and it 
is still a problem in a lot of places—not 
enough nurses, doctors. But regardless, 
they didn’t work from home. Nurses, 
doctors, and first responders still went 
to work in person. Employees at gro-
cery stores, delivery drivers, and ware-
house workers still showed up to work 
in person at the height of this pan-
demic, when nobody really knew what 
was all involved. For millions of Amer-
icans, working from home was never an 
option. Their jobs were essential and

they continued to work to keep our so-
ciety and economy functioning. 
While some Federal employees may 
be able to do their job effectively from 
home, the persistent lack of respon-
siveness from Federal Agencies make 
it clear that not all can work from 
home. 
It is certainly not acceptable to tell 
taxpayers that they must wait for serv-
ices that they need because those in 
charge are too skittish to make a re-
turn-to-work plan. It is past time for 
Agencies and their heads to set a date 
for employees to return to serving the 
people in person. 
That is why I was very glad to join 
Senator WICKER in an introduction of a 
bill that he calls, by the acronym, the 
RETURN Act, which would require 
Agencies to share their plans to bring 
back the workforce within 30 days. I 
would urge my colleagues to support 
this bill and get the government back 
to work. 
I also urge President Biden—and 
when I bring up the name ‘‘President 
Biden,’’ don’t forget that some of this 
stuff started under the Trump adminis-
tration and continues today, so this is 
not just a Democratic problem when I 
say President Biden. But I also urge 
President Biden, now in charge, to fol-
low the example of Iowa’s Governor 
Reynolds and show leadership on this 
matter. Iowa schools have been fully 
open in Iowa for more than a year. 
Governor 
Reynolds 
has 
ended 
the 
State’s public health disaster emer-
gency proclamation. This doesn’t mean 
ignoring the spread of COVID–19 going 
forward. Of course, there should be ac-
commodation for those at high risk, 
but there is absolutely no justification 
for maintaining a state of emergency 
as if it were still March of 2020. 
Taxpayers have a right to have their 
government be responsive. Americans 
are back to work. It is time for the 
Federal Government to catch up. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic whip. 
STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, on Tues-
day evening, President Biden delivered 
his first State of the Union Message to 
Congress and to the American people. 
His remarks were timely, strong, and 
statesmanlike. 
He touched on many topics. I think 
his message really boiled down to two 
profound questions: How do we protect 
democracy in other nations, particu-
larly in Ukraine, which is now entering 
the second week of a horrific and 
unprovoked invasion by Russian forces; 
and then he asked, how can we protect 
and preserve democracy here in Amer-
ica? 
Dictators like Vladimir Putin and Xi 
Jinping want the world to believe that 
democracy is nothing more than chaos 
and gridlock. The people of Ukraine are 
showing the world just how wrong 
these despots are. 
I speak to you today from the com-
fort and safety of the Senate Chamber 
in the United States of America, in 
Washington, DC, on a beautiful spring-
like day. But I have to reflect for a mo-
ment on what life must be like at this 
very moment in Kyiv, in Ukraine, and 
what it must be like in Lviv; two cities 
in Ukraine that I visited where bombs 
are raining down on innocent people— 
children, women, and men who are los-
ing their lives because Vladimir Putin 
believes that he can restore the Soviet 
Union to its borders. 
We have all seen the video of the 
Ukrainian grandmother, armed with 
nothing more than sunflower seeds and 
courage, confronting Russian soldiers. 
We have seen ordinary Ukrainian 
men and women and teenagers taking 
up arms, making Molotov cocktails, 
building barricades, taking down high-
way and road signs to confuse the in-
vading Russians—even laying down 
their lives to stop Russian tanks and 
convoys. 
In the back of my mind, I am sure I 
am thinking what many Americans are 
thinking: Could I do the same thing? 
Could I bring together the courage at 
this moment to stand up and fight if 
my home is at stake, if my family is at 
stake, if my country is at stake? 
The Ukrainians are answering that 
message every minute of every day. 
Their courage and unity in the face of 
this Russian barbarity is inspiring the 
world. 
For months, President Biden, Sec-
retary of State Tony Blinken, and oth-
ers in the Biden administration have 
worked behind the scenes to revitalize 
the NATO alliance. That critical alli-
ance emerged after the last great land 
war in Europe in 1945 from the allies 
who came out of it and said: Never 
again. We will stand together to stop 
any invader against the NATO coali-
tion, the NATO alliance. 
The Biden administration has worked 
behind the scenes to remind this alli-
ance that there comes a moment when 
you have to bring to this alliance the 
courage and direction to stand for the 
kind of democracy which we are all 
committed to. 
Two years ago, we had a President 
who took Putin’s word over the assess-
ment of America’s own intelligence 
Agencies and said he threatened to pull 
the United States participation out of 
NATO. Today, we have a President who 
actually shared U.S. intelligence with 
our allies to show Putin for the liar 
that he was from the very start. 
NATO is more unified today—thank 
you, Vladimir Putin, for that—than it 
has ever been since the Cold War or the 
end of World War II. In fact, nations 
that are not formally part of NATO— 
Sweden and Finland, for example—have 
stepped up, in concert with the NATO 
alliance, to stand our ground and pro-
test what is happening in Ukraine and 
to protect Europe—even Switzerland. 
Switzerland, which is famously neutral 
in all major conflicts, has come out of 
its neutrality and made it clear that 
they, too, stand against the Putin in-
vasion. 
In his State of the Union Address, 
President Biden urged Congress to ap-
prove billions of dollars in emergency 
military and humanitarian assistance 
for Ukraine. Sign me up. I will vote for 
that in a second, and I hope it comes 
soon. We need to agree on an aid pack-
age without delay and get it to the 
President as quickly as possible, not 
just for the humanitarian purpose but 
for the purpose of showing American 
unity with the resistance in Ukraine. 
Ukrainian 
ordinary 
citizens 
are 
dying today because of Vladimir Putin 
and the bombs and missiles he is 
launching. As in every war, innocent 
Ukrainians will soon be facing greater 
suffering, greater hunger—even starva-
tion. In the year 2022, is it imaginable 
that this is happening in Europe? We 
must rally the world to support those 
still in the Ukraine, assist our allies in 
neighboring nations who are housing 
and feeding neighboring Ukrainians 
who have fled their homeland. They es-
timate 800,000 to a million Ukrainians 
have left the country to find safety 
nearby. 
Once again, let me thank the people 
of Poland. They have been opening 
their doors to the people of Ukraine for 
many years, and now, they are being 
called on in an extraordinary way to 
harbor these refugees and to take care 
of them at this moment of need. They 
are fleeing Putin’s war, and their num-
bers are growing dramatically. Some 
have suggested that a humanitarian 
airlift is a possibility. I don’t want to 
rule that out. Let’s explore that and 
see whether that is the best way to pro-
vide relief to those still in Ukraine fac-
ing Putin’s attack. 
President Biden also promised to 
form a high-level task force to enforce 
U.S. sanctions against Putin, sanctions 
against Russia’s political elites, and 
sanctions 
against 
the 
corrupt 
oligarchs. That always brings a cheer 
here in America because people think 
that those who have been engaged in a 
kleptocracy in the name of personal 
greed should be held accountable. The 
thought that they are shopping in New 
York City or buying luxury condos and 
apartments in London or are harboring 
their yachts in any country is dis-
gusting. 
They need to pay a price. We 
shouldn’t just freeze their assets; we 
ought to seize their assets and hold 
them to rebuild Ukraine amid the dev-
astation that the Russians are causing. 
Putin wants to be a czar. He and his 
cronies have become a pariah. 
We will support Ukraine, but we also 
have work to do to strengthen our own 
democracy. We also have to remember 
that the bordering nations, the Baltic 
States of Lithuania, Latvia, and Esto-
nia, are especially vulnerable to Rus-
sian aggression. They, as members of 
the NATO alliance, know that they 
have friends at their back, but we have 
got to reinforce that to the people of 
those small countries who worry about 
their very survival. 
Let’s take a look at home. As the 
President said, we have finally moved

March 3, 2022 
to a safer direction with the pandemic. 
What a relief it was to go to the State 
of the Union Address and not wear a 
mask. Following doctors’ orders, I 
might add, we listened to the medical 
experts who told us it is safe now not 
to be wearing a mask unless you are in 
a particular category of people. So 
most of us enjoyed one of the first pub-
lic gatherings of a political nature 
where we were without masks and re-
lieved to be so. We need to get back to 
our normal routines. We need to get 
our kids back in school—all of them— 
as quickly as possible. 
We added 6 million new jobs last 
year, an alltime record. Things are 
good and positive, but inflation still is 
haunting this Nation. Wages are up; in-
flation is up. But it is not just our Na-
tion. Inflation is a global problem. 
COVID–19 constricted the economy of 
the world. We are now emerging from 
it with new jobs, new businesses, new 
appetites, and new consumption. It is 
all good. But the cost of it is inflation. 
I trust that we can bring this under 
control soon. Inflation is real. It is eat-
ing away at families’ wages and sav-
ings and their faith in the future. When 
people work hard and can’t get ahead, 
that is not just an economic problem; 
that can be a threat to our democratic 
spirit because it can open the door for 
anti-democratic demagogues. 
In his State of the Union Address, 
President Biden laid out a plan to help 
American families afford big-ticket 
items that are essential; restore the 
enhanced child tax credit; help parents 
raise their kids and themselves out of 
poverty; help families with quality af-
fordable daycare, childcare; expand 
family and medical leave so workers 
don’t have to choose between caring for 
an ailing member of their family or a 
terminally ill parent and keeping their 
jobs; make healthcare more affordable 
and accessible; expand veterans’ health 
benefits to cover more cancers and 
other service-related health conditions; 
and make prescription drugs more af-
fordable by letting Medicare negotiate 
the price for medication. 
Just one simple thing seems to be so 
popular across this country, cap the 
monthly cost of insulin at $35—$35. 
There are some 34 million people who 
are suffering from diabetes in this 
country, and of course their families 
are pulling for them every day. Think 
of all of the lives that could be im-
proved if insulin were affordable. If a 
fourth or half of those who are diabetic 
have to now ration their insulin and 
risk their health, that is just wrong in 
a great nation. We should have insulin 
at affordable prices, and $35 a month is 
that. It is an outrage that the price of 
insulin has been raised countless times 
to more than $300 a vial. 
As we support the Ukrainian people 
and their immense courage, I hope we 
will also find the courage to protect 
America’s future. 
TRIBUTE TO TOM BALANOFF 
Mr. President, when it comes to the 
American labor movement, I selfishly 
say all roads lead to Chicago. At the 
turn of the 20th century, workers from 
all walks of life and from every corner 
of the globe joined together in support 
of a simple but profound belief: An in-
jury to one is an injury to all. 
Few leaders have embodied that phi-
losophy of solidarity and mutuality 
more than Tom Balanoff, president of 
the Service Employees International 
Union—SEIU—Local 1 in Chicago and 
the union’s State council. If you are a 
worker in Illinois or a worker any-
where in America, there is a good 
chance you know Tom. He has devoted 
his life not only to building a strong 
labor movement but a more inclusive 
one. 
Now, he is retiring from his post as 
president of Local 1. Though his leader-
ship will be missed, he leaves behind a 
formidable legacy. 
He helped build a global labor move-
ment, led by essential workers. I am 
talking about janitors, security offi-
cers, airport staff, and nursing home 
and home healthcare workers who are 
reclaiming their power in the work-
place. 
As president of Local 1, Tom Balanoff 
transformed the chapter into one of the 
most influential forces in the Amer-
ican labor movement, and every step of 
the way, he held true to the chapter’s 
progressive roots. Formed in Chicago 
in 1921, Local 1 was the first racially 
integrated union in America, bringing 
together 
immigrant 
janitors 
from 
across the globe who were fighting for 
better working conditions. 
From that moment on, SEIU has 
been synonymous with merging the 
fight for workers’ rights with the fight 
for social equality, and Tom has car-
ried that legacy to new heights. He has 
been a steadfast champion of racial 
equality, gender equality, and pro-
tecting the rights of immigrant work-
ers, and he has assembled the most di-
verse leadership team in SEIU’s his-
tory. 
Importantly, Tom’s commitment to 
leading 
a 
socially 
conscious 
labor 
movement is steeped in a proud family 
tradition. It began when Tom’s grand-
father, James Balanoff, immigrated to 
America from Bulgaria and found work 
in a live chicken shop on Commercial 
Avenue in Chicago. Since then, each 
generation of the ‘‘Battling Balanoffs’’ 
has been grounded in a commitment to 
defending the rights of working people 
in and outside of the workplace. 
The Balanoff family notes with pride 
that both Tom’s father and grandfather 
attended the 1937 Memorial Day Mas-
sacre, where police opened fire on un-
armed protesters at the gate of the Re-
public Steel Company in South Chi-
cago, killing 10 men and injuring scores 
of others. If the police had hoped to 
fracture union solidarity, the massacre 
had the exact opposite effect on the 
Balanoff family and many others. 
The Balanoff family has stood by 
workers. Tom’s father, James Jr., orga-
nized steelworkers at a time when 
manufacturing was the dominant in-
dustry in America, and he eventually 
rose to be president of the largest 
steelworkers union in America, Local 
1010, in East Chicago, IN. Tom has been 
helping lead the charge for justice for 
all since he was in middle school—mid-
dle school—when he and his siblings 
were the only White kids in class to 
protest racial segregation in American 
schools. 
By the time Tom was ready to follow 
in his family’s tradition of union activ-
ism, America’s economy was going 
through a dramatic shift. Factories 
were shuttering and good-paying union 
jobs disappearing, shipped overseas. As 
more and more Americans left the fac-
tories and found new opportunities in 
airports, hospitals, nursing homes, of-
fices, and coffee shops, Tom discovered 
his life’s mission: defending the rights 
of the service workers who make our 
economy tick. To complement the 
commitment to economic and labor 
justice that runs in the Balanoff fam-
ily’s veins, Tom earned a master’s de-
gree in labor and industrial relations 
from the University of Illinois. 
For decades, whenever and wherever 
his skills were needed to protect the 
rights of workers, you could count on 
Tom Balanoff to be there. He worked 
for the International Association of 
Firefighters here in Washington, for 
the Allied Industrial Workers in Chi-
cago, and the Cement, Lime and Gyp-
sum Workers in Kansas City before 
then-SEIU president, John Sweeney, 
spotted Tom’s exception abilities and 
brought him to work for SEIU in Wash-
ington, DC. 
Tom would go on to serve as trustee 
of John Sweeney’s old SEIU local, 
Local 32BJ, in New York City. After a 
successful tenure there, he returned to 
Chicago, first as SEIU Local 46 trustee 
and eventually as president of both 
SEIU Local 1 and president of the Illi-
nois State Council. 
Tom always has seized opportunities 
to uplift disempowered workers. In 
2005, he traveled down to Houston to 
help unionize janitors who were being 
paid as little as $20 a day. In the heart 
of one of the most anti-union States in 
the country, Tom secured a contract 
for more than 5,000 janitors that dou-
bled their pay. 
Never content to settle, Tom kept 
the 
victories 
coming. 
Just 
a 
few 
months later, he helped thousands of 
janitors in Cincinnati, Columbus, and 
Indianapolis win a similar contract. It 
was a testament to his lifelong belief 
that, when working people of all identi-
ties come together, they win. 
In the world of politics, my friend 
Tom has been a champion of the down-
trodden. Several years ago, he helped 
launch the progressive caucus in the 
Chicago City Council, despite facing 
significant political headwinds. Today, 
more than a third of the city council 
members belong to that caucus. 
Perhaps the most consequential deci-
sion Tom ever made as a political 
changemaker was in the year 2003, 
when he became an early endorser of a

community organizer running for the 
U.S. Senate by the name of Barack 
Obama. That endorsement helped pave 
the way for former President Obama’s 
stratospheric rise in the world of poli-
tics. 
And a few years later, Tom became 
the first labor leader in America to en-
dorse Barack Obama’s campaign for 
President. At the time, Tom and I were 
part of the same lonely club. I was the 
first U.S. Senator to endorse President 
Obama’s candidacy in 2007, and for 
more than a year, I was the only Sen-
ator to do so. But Tom and I knew that 
Barack Obama was the leader this 
country needed. 
We had seen firsthand the amazing 
work he had done in Chicago, helping 
displaced workers rebuild their lives 
and partnering with churches to launch 
job training. We knew that President 
Obama had what it took to unite our 
country. And without Tom’s support, 
his candidacy may never have gotten 
off the ground. 
Tom has said one of the leaders who 
inspired him most during his career 
was Nelson Mandela. A few years after 
the end of apartheid, Nelson Mandela 
wrote: ‘‘To be free is not merely to cast 
off one’s chains, but to live in a way 
that respects and enhances the freedom 
of others.’’ 
Tom has dedicated his life to enhanc-
ing the freedom of others. He has stood 
for immigrant workers so that they 
could find a voice in the workplace. He 
has stood in solidarity with Black 
workers protesting against racial in-
justice. And he has worked to protect 
our communities and our children by 
demanding climate justice as well. 
In one of his final acts as president of 
Local 1, Tom helped make history 
again. He handed the reins of leader-
ship of that storied local to the first 
Black president of the SEIU’s State 
council. Greg Kelley is a proven cham-
pion of working people in Illinois and 
across the country. And I might add 
that when I sat down for breakfast to 
congratulate Greg on this new oppor-
tunity, he reminded me that he had 
once been an intern in my Senate of-
fice—something I am very proud of. 
Tom Balanoff is leaving his post at a 
promising moment for the working 
people of America. Since the beginning 
of the pandemic, service workers have 
come together to demand safer work-
ing conditions, higher wages, and bet-
ter benefits. 
For instance, in December, workers 
in Starbucks in Buffalo, NY, voted to 
unionize. It will be the company’s first- 
ever union. And those workers will 
soon 
be 
represented 
by 
Starbucks 
Workers United, an affiliate of SEIU. 
This moment is a culmination of Tom’s 
decades of service to the labor move-
ment. 
I want to thank Tom Balanoff for ev-
erything he has achieved for working 
families in Chicago, throughout Amer-
ica, and literally around the world. He 
has cultivated progressive political 
power and helped build a fairer econ-
omy that rewards hard work, not just 
wealth. 
Loretta and I wish him a long, joyous 
retirement with his wife Hetty and 
their two kids. 
Tom, I am looking forward to seeing 
you some day soon in Highland Park— 
watermelon juice on me. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
SCHATZ). The Senator from Illinois. 
Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. President, I 
join the senior Senator from Illinois’ 
affection for Tom Balanoff. He truly is 
an icon for labor, not just in Illinois 
but across the country. 
UKRAINE 
Mr. President, I rise today to speak 
on Ukraine. 
With Russian troops firing outside, 
one Ukrainian woman was rushed out-
side and down out of the hospital by 
hospital staff. She was reportedly 
forced to give birth in a makeshift ICU 
in the hospital’s basement with the 
sound of shelling surrounding her and 
with more than 100,000 Russian troops 
closing in on the area. 
Elsewhere in Eastern Ukraine, moth-
ers and their newborns are being hur-
ried from neonatal intensive care units 
to makeshift bomb shelters, with the 
blankets swaddling their babies the 
only armor they have protecting them 
from the explosions and missiles criss-
crossing the skies above them. 
And all across Ukraine, little boys 
and girls are being born in subway car 
shelters, where some of the first words 
they hear are the cries of older chil-
dren 
asking 
their 
own 
parents: 
‘‘Mommy, will we die here?’’ 
This is the everyday, every-moment 
waking nightmare for those who call 
Ukraine home right now. This is the 
new normal for new moms struggling 
to 
learn 
how 
to 
breastfeed 
their 
newborns; the new reality for new par-
ents who, just last week, were trying to 
figure out how to afford both diapers 
and next month’s rent, yet who are 
now just desperate to get their 1-week- 
old to the 2-week-old mark. 
Why is this their new reality? For 
what? For a brutal and senseless war, a 
war as unjust as it is unjustifiable, as 
needless as it was unprovoked; a war 
whose violence has already torn fami-
lies apart, yet whose cruelty has failed 
to fracture the unity of Ukraine itself. 
Three decades ago, with the collapse 
of the Soviet Union, the United States 
and Russia asked Ukraine to give up 
their nuclear weapons in exchange for 
security guarantees under the Buda-
pest Memorandum. Ukraine did so vol-
untarily, handing them over instead of 
keeping them for their own defense be-
cause the Ukrainians so desperately 
sought peace and a democratic rule- 
based order. 
Now, Russia has unilaterally broken 
that agreement, shattering that peace, 
and Ukrainians are once more laying 
down their lives for those same demo-
cratic principles. 
The contrast is stark. Vladimir Putin 
is fighting for autocracy, using aggres-
sion and irresponsible, unprovoked es-
calation. Ukraine meanwhile is fight-
ing for freedom. 
Vladimir Putin believes himself to be 
some sort of neoimperialist, actively 
attacking neighboring democracies in 
an attempt to restore the Russian Em-
pire. 
Well, today, I want to speak to all 
the Ukrainians who found a home in Il-
linois and all of them who are strewn 
across Europe who have been forced to 
flee their nation in the wake of this vi-
olence and to all who are still in 
Ukraine praying that they will be able 
to wake up again tomorrow. Let me 
say this clearly: We are with you. The 
free world has not been fooled by Vladi-
mir Putin’s schemes and lies. We know 
that he is no hero for Russians or any-
one else. He is a violent mobster and a 
bully, an egomaniac who uses his own 
power to abuse those with less power, a 
tyrant who uses the levers in his con-
trol to level those who are in his way, 
someone who uses weapons of war to 
murder children from afar, who turns 
toddlers into orphans from hundreds of 
miles away from the safety of his hal-
lowed halls and heavily fortified man-
sions. 
And yet, even with less power and 
less money, despite being outnumbered 
and outgunned, Ukraine has shown an 
incredible will to fight, putting up the 
fiercest of resistance against Putin and 
all that he stands for. That is because 
cowardice will always falter in the face 
of courage. 
Ukrainians are redefining that word 
‘‘courage’’ every day that they repel 
Putin’s unprovoked aggression. That is 
because those fighting for reasons of 
ego and greed will always stumble in 
the face of those fighting so that their 
children can climb out of bomb shel-
ters, so that their third graders can go 
back to school, so that their families 
don’t need to live every hour, breathe 
every breath with the kind of fear that 
Putin thrives on. 
And while I wish more than anything 
that Putin had never started this war 
and that those tanks had never rolled 
through their nation’s streets, now the 
world will know the strength that typi-
fies the Ukrainian people. They will 
know that Kyiv is synonymous with 
courage. They will know that though 
buildings in Odessa may crumble, the 
heart of the Ukrainian people will 
never waiver. 
I am in awe of those men, women, 
and children. I am in awe of the troops 
doing everything in their power to pro-
tect them. And I am honored that the 
Illinois National Guard helped train 
some of those Ukrainian soldiers, with 
our Guard members advising Ukrainian 
forces just last year on how to improve 
their defense capabilities. 
They are our brothers and sisters in 
arms; and their bravery, their resil-
ience, and their determination over 
this past week has reminded the world 
that, as a certain retired U.S. Army 
lieutenant colonel and son of Ukraine 
once said in this very Chamber: Right 
matters.

S972 
March 3, 2022 
They have shown us once more that a 
tyrant’s lies will never blot out the 
courage and the goodness of a people 
determined to fight with and for one 
another. 
That is just one reason why I support 
President Biden’s request to dedicate 
at least $6.4 billion in humanitarian 
and military aid to help those under 
siege in Ukraine, and it is why I am 
doing everything in my power to help 
keep Ukrainians in the United States 
safe by granting them temporary pro-
tected status. 
Look, this is no 21st-century Cold 
War; it is Putin’s war. It is a coward’s 
war. Vladimir Putin is no savior. He 
will bring no glory to the Russian peo-
ple. All he will bring them is travesty 
and economic ruin. He is no champion. 
He is an embarrassment, and the his-
tory books will reflect as much. 
Twenty-eight years ago, when we 
asked Ukraine to give up those nuclear 
weapons, they did so, choosing peace, 
choosing to end the threat of bloodshed 
and destruction, choosing democracy. 
So now, we must stand with them as 
they so desperately seek peace once 
more. 
They have chosen democracy time 
and again. Today and all the days that 
this terrible war wages on, it is time 
for this democracy to choose them. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from Texas. 
ENERGY 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, 15 years 
ago, an environmental group called the 
Clean Sky Coalition launched an ad 
campaign targeting coal. The ads fea-
tured faces covered in soot, with the 
headline: ‘‘Face it, Coal is Filthy.’’ 
Of the many controversial ad cam-
paigns we have seen over the years, 
this doesn’t seem particularly note-
worthy, but these ads at the time 
sparked so much outrage that they 
were eventually pulled. 
You might wonder why. An environ-
mental group attacking coal is hardly 
front-page news. Why was this ad cam-
paign different? This wasn’t a matter 
of what was being said; it was a matter 
of who was saying it and why. 
It quickly came to life that the group 
behind the ad was only about 2 weeks 
old, and the entire ‘‘pro-environment’’ 
effort was sponsored by a natural gas 
company seeking market share over 
coal. 
As they say, politics makes for 
strange bedfellows—in this case, envi-
ronmentalists and natural gas compa-
nies were both anti-coal, though, for 
very different reasons. 
Knowing that the American people 
wouldn’t respond to the argument that 
coal is bad because it means less busi-
ness for the gas companies, this par-
ticular company found a deceptive and 
manipulative way to help shape public 
opinion. 
Today, we are seeing a similar push 
but with much greater reach and far 
higher stakes. Just as one company 
used the guise of environmentalism to 
attack its competition, Russia today is 
using the same tactic to boost its own 
profits and enhance its power. 
The Office of Director of National In-
telligence released a report in 2017 out-
lining some of Russia’s disinformation 
campaign, on everything from U.S. 
elections to U.S. energy policy. 
Of course, one of the Kremlin’s favor-
ite tools is its intentional propaganda 
outlet known as RT, formally known 
as Russia Today. 
According to the report, RT ran anti- 
fracking programming in the United 
States that highlighted environmental 
and public health concerns. That is 
right. The propaganda arm of the Rus-
sian Federation, RT, was running anti- 
fracking programming in the United 
States. And you might ask yourself: 
For what purpose? 
Well, the Director of National Intel-
ligence report in 2017 said: This is like-
ly reflective of the Russian Govern-
ment’s concern about the impact of 
fracking, which is a device to release 
natural gas from shale. The report said 
this is likely reflective of the Russian 
Government’s concern about the im-
pact of fracking in U.S. natural gas 
production on the global energy mar-
ket and the potential challenges to 
Gazprom’s profitability—Gazprom, of 
course, being the Russian Federation’s 
energy company. 
In short, all of this propaganda on 
Russia today and the opposition to 
fracking that they were encouraging 
would be good for the sale of Russian 
gas as opposed to natural gas produced 
here in the United States. 
Russia can’t seem to dominate the 
global energy market on its own, so it 
tries to take down the competition. It 
is not just a matter of dollars and 
cents; it is a matter of geopolitical 
power. This isn’t a farfetched con-
spiracy theory that was crafted to 
combat the Green New Deal. As I said, 
it comes from an unclassified report 
from the Director of National Intel-
ligence Office 5 years ago—2017. 
Knowledge of this practice likely pre-
dates that report by a number of years. 
Reporting indicates that even Hillary 
Clinton spoke about those malign ac-
tivities in a 2014 speech. She warned 
about what she called ‘‘phony environ-
mental groups’’ that were funded by 
the Russians. 
Russia is no stranger—in fact, they 
are expert at disinformation cam-
paigns, and it doesn’t abide by the 
same moral and ethical codes as the 
rest of the world. 
The past several days have shone a 
light on how far Putin is willing to go 
to increase his own power. I am not 
suggesting 
that 
all 
environmental 
groups are funded by the Russian Gov-
ernment—not in the slightest—but we 
need to be clear-eyed about Russia’s ef-
forts to shape U.S. policies and Euro-
pean policies for their own benefit. We 
need to be hyperaware of the ways de-
cisions made in Washington could ben-
efit Moscow and empower Putin to the 
detriment of our allies in NATO and in 
Europe. 
Unfortunately, the energy cards in 
Europe are currently stacked in Rus-
sia’s favor. From day one, the Biden 
administration has taken hostile ac-
tions toward American energy sup-
pliers and sent even more business to 
Russia. 
Only hours after the President was 
sworn in on January 20, 2021, he can-
celed the permit for the Keystone XL 
Pipeline and halted all new energy 
leasing and permitting on public lands 
and waters. His administration effec-
tively discouraged investments in new 
production, and now the United States 
is producing less oil and less natural 
gas. Production is, in fact, down about 
1.2 million barrels a day in the United 
States, and that has to be made up 
somewhere because the world con-
tinues to consume energy. It needs en-
ergy in order to survive and to thrive. 
Where does it get that energy when the 
United States does not produce it? 
Well, you guessed it—it gets it from 
Russia, and it gets it from OPEC, in-
cluding the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. 
Sadly, the buck doesn’t stop there. In 
light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, 
the Biden administration hasn’t taken 
any effective action against Putin’s en-
ergy weapon. Even though the adminis-
tration has imposed sanctions on Rus-
sian banks and oligarchs, the country’s 
lucrative oil and gas industry remains 
untouched. This is their primary finan-
cial asset. 
I remember our friend John McCain, 
when he was still alive, used to joke 
that 
Russia 
is 
a 
gas 
station 
masquerading as a country, making 
the obvious point in a humorous way. 
Russia continues to use these oil 
sales and natural gas sales and the cap-
tive markets that it has in Europe and 
in other places around the world in 
order to finance its war against inno-
cent Ukrainians. There is no question 
but that the revenue from these ex-
ports—and we have seen the price of oil 
since Putin invaded Ukraine again— 
the price of a barrel of oil go up to $115 
a barrel. And there is no question that 
he is using the revenue derived from 
the sale of that $115 barrel oil to kill 
innocent Ukrainians and to violate 
their sovereignty and to commit war 
crimes. We simply cannot continue to 
supply Russia with the blood money it 
needs to carry out its nefarious ac-
tions. 
I am proud to cosponsor legislation 
that was introduced by our friend from 
Kansas, Senator MARSHALL, to ban the 
purchase of Russian oil in the United 
States. We have the great fortune of 
living in a resource-rich country, and 
there is no reason we should be import-
ing Russian oil, now more than ever. 
The President said he does not want 
to target Russian oil and gas because 
of the impact it will have on prices 
here at home. Well, we already know 
that because of inflation—because of 
shoveling money out of Washington, 
DC, out into the great American econ-
omy, inflation has already caused 
prices at the pump and prices in the

grocery stores to rise. Given the fact 
that gas prices have already risen 40 
percent since President Biden took of-
fice, I understand his concerns, but 
that doesn’t mean Russia should get a 
free pass. 
Rather than identify ways to offset 
global demand for Russian energy, 
President Biden is inadvertently play-
ing into Putin’s hand. He is not calling 
for any more American-made oil and 
gas; he is calling for less. 
Tuesday evening, President Biden 
said he wants to double America’s 
clean 
energy 
production, 
including 
sources like wind and solar. I want to 
be clear, I support an ‘‘all of the 
above’’ energy policy. As I have said 
time and time again, Texas produces 
more energy from wind than any other 
State in the country, and it is an im-
portant part of our energy mix. 
Every day, though, Texas is also 
making serious strides in energy inno-
vation. This is the way to solve the 
problem; it is to innovate—not to regu-
late, not to tax, not to punish, but to 
innovate. We need to continue to find 
ways to innovate cleaner sorts of en-
ergy as we eventually transition, as we 
must at some point in the future— 
maybe decades from now—from petro-
leum-based products to some other 
source of energy. 
I believe we need to continue to en-
courage innovation and diversification 
of our energy sources, but the fact re-
mains today that renewables are not 
close to being able to supply the energy 
needs that our country demands. As it 
stands 
today, 
renewables—solar, 
wind—comprise less than 20 percent of 
our electricity generation. We know 
the Sun doesn’t always shine and the 
wind doesn’t always blow, and when 
Mother Nature fails to deliver an ade-
quate supply of energy, we need some 
other source of that energy, which 
means American-produced natural gas 
and oil. 
If the President continues to wage a 
war on American oil and gas compa-
nies, we won’t be able to protect our-
selves or our allies. 
One of the great things about the 
shale gas revolution is our ability to 
ship energy overseas to our friends and 
allies around the world. Unfortunately, 
the infrastructure has not kept up with 
the demand, leaving our friends and al-
lies dependent on Vladimir Putin and 
the Russian Federation for their only 
choice. We need to provide them more 
choices, and that means produce more 
here in America of clean-burning nat-
ural gas and then exporting that LNG 
to our friends and allies around the 
world so they aren’t subject to Putin’s 
extortion and demands. 
Our top priority needs to be, when it 
comes to energy, to pursue independ-
ence. If we are able to bolster renew-
ables, invest in carbon capture tech-
nologies, and take other steps along 
the way to reduce emissions, that is a 
great goal for us to pursue. But our No. 
1 priority here, today, and now should 
be for the United States and our allies 
to be energy secure. Right now, Europe 
is not energy secure; it is energy inse-
cure because of the intentional acts of 
Vladimir Putin to make Russia the 
sole source of energy needs for coun-
tries in Europe and the policies re-
stricting the development of our Amer-
ican-made energy here in the United 
States. 
Just a few years ago, we were almost 
there when it came to energy security. 
In 2019, the United States became a net 
total energy exporter for the first time 
since 1952—a net total energy exporter. 
The last time we did that, it was 1952, 
and we maintained that status through 
the year 2020. But President Biden has, 
for reasons that are inscrutable to me, 
turned back the clock, taking us from 
an era of energy independence back to 
the oil crisis of the 1970s. 
For decades, leaders in our country 
fought to reduce our reliance on for-
eign oil in anticipation of a global cri-
sis exactly like the one we are facing 
now. We can’t erase all of this progress 
we have made at the exact moment 
when we need that progress and that 
production the most. 
Russia will always use energy as a 
weapon to tear down and intimidate its 
adversaries. The United States, con-
versely, must use it as a tool to lift up 
our allies and improve global energy 
security. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Massachusetts. 
Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I rise 
today to decry yet again Putin’s hor-
rific actions against Ukraine and the 
Ukrainian people. 
As we bear witness to this deadly war 
and the consequences of this fossil fuel- 
funded invasion, I stand here again to 
denounce our own addiction to fossil 
fuels, along with Big Oil’s relentless at-
tempts to sabotage clean and renew-
able energy with the support of the Re-
publican Party. 
We can see in the coverage on tele-
vision that the corporate profiteering 
by Big Oil and the American Petroleum 
Institute—the American Prevarication 
Institute—has once again played a part 
in war and destruction. And all are en-
abled by the GOP’s fealty to oil, gas, 
and the fallacy of American energy 
independence. It is a tale of Republican 
hypocrisy, all funded by the fossil fuel 
industry. It would be absurdly comic if 
it weren’t so horribly tragic. 
Oil profits are the engine of Russia’s 
economy, and natural gas is the geo-
political weapon it wields to threaten 
Europe’s energy security. Nearly 40 
percent of Russia’s entire revenue is 
derived from oil and gas exports. Rus-
sia’s tanks, armored vehicles, and ar-
tillery are funded by dirty fossil fuels 
purchased by other countries, includ-
ing the United States of America. We 
are part of the funding of Vladimir 
Putin’s 
war 
of 
aggression 
against 
Ukraine. We import oil from Russia. 
That oil goes to Putin and his cronies. 
We have a moral moment here to pro-
vide all possible humanitarian aid to 
the Ukrainian people. We have a moral 
moment here to cut off the money 
pipeline that is funding the missiles 
and the tanks that are destroying the 
homes of the Ukrainian people. And we 
have a moral moment here to reject 
the bad-faith arguments that are using 
this horrifying invasion to push for 
more drilling and money to fossil fuel 
companies, more lands and waters lost 
to the extraction of oil and gas, and 
more profit for Big Oil at the expense 
of American pocketbooks as our con-
sumers are tipped upside down at the 
gasoline pumps all across our country, 
shaking money out of those pockets 
and sending it to Big Oil and sending it 
to Russia. 
During 2021, Russia supplanted Mex-
ico as the second largest exporter of 
crude oil and petroleum in the United 
States. On average, we bought more 
than 600,000 barrels of oil from Russia 
every single day of 2021. That is more 
than $17 billion in American money 
going to Putin and his oil-soaked 
oligarchs. 
We need to shut that money pipeline 
to Putin off before it does any more 
damage. That is why I announced my 
Severing Putin’s Immense Gains from 
Oil Transfers, or the SPIGOT, Act this 
week. This bill would conclusively lift 
the veil on the Russian fossil fuel in-
dustry’s corrupt dealings, while requir-
ing the United States to eliminate car-
bon-polluting imports from Russia, 
moving the United States toward a fu-
ture that is no longer dependent upon 
Russian oil but dependent upon our 
own renewable resources. 
Global oil markets will adjust in the 
short term and long term to our import 
ban on oil. In the short term, we can 
actually supplant any supply disrup-
tions with an additional release from 
the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. A 10- 
percent release of the Strategic Petro-
leum Reserve would backfill all of our 
Russian imports for 100 days or, to put 
it another way, we have a Strategic Pe-
troleum Reserve of 600 million barrels. 
If we deploy 600,000 barrels a day, we 
can do it for 1,000 days in a row in order 
to make sure the Russians understand 
that we are dead serious about this. 
Putin’s $630 billion central bank re-
serve that he thinks is going to protect 
him and his economy—well, that chest 
is filled with the spoils of oil and nat-
ural gas. A lot of it is money from 
American consumers. It is not just the 
sales to the United States or Europe 
but the interconnected dirty energy 
markets that feed off this fuel-soaked 
firestorm. 
If we want to truly dial-up the pres-
sure on Putin and his oligarchs, we 
need to end our deadly addiction to 
Russian fossil fuels and help our allies 
to do the very same thing. If we want 
to truly say no more to fossil-fueled 
war, we need to pursue the pathway to 
peace that is powered by domestic 
clean energy—international clean en-
ergy revolution led by the United 
States. 
But instead what I hear from Repub-
licans and on FOX News and from the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S974 
March 3, 2022 
American Petroleum Institute is the 
same classic refrain of: ‘‘Drill, baby, 
drill.’’ Their insidious answer to war, 
to rising prices, to any crisis that they 
can use for their own purpose is more 
drilling and more leases. 
Well, where has the ‘‘American Pre-
varication Institute’’ argument gotten 
us so far? One, skyrocketing exports, 
which hike up our prices to American 
consumers and feed into the global fos-
sil fuel addiction; public lands and 
waters the size of Indiana that are 
locked down by unused fossil fuel 
leases, which companies squat upon to 
pad their own asset base and prevent 
renewable development; wars and na-
tional security threats, driven and paid 
for by Big Oil’s craving for more prof-
its; climate chaos with more than $700 
billion worth of damages caused by ex-
treme weather disasters in the United 
States over the last 5 years alone—$700 
billion worth of damage to us, to the 
United States, from climate in the last 
5 years. 
In 2015, Congress repealed the crude 
oil and gas export ban that had been in 
place for 40 years in our country so 
that we would keep our oil here. It was 
repealed with unanimous support of 
the Republican Party, on the other side 
of the aisle, and it allowed for the sale 
of U.S. crude and natural gas on the 
global markets. 
I warned at that time it would be a 
huge mistake for our country to take 
that action. It was the worst of all 
worlds. 
It 
led 
to 
recordbreaking 
amounts of U.S. oil going to foreign na-
tions without benefiting U.S. con-
sumers. Pain at the pump was not 
eased and neither was our dangerous 
dependence on illicit foreign oil. And 
every time—every time—the Repub-
licans call for more leasing, for more 
pipelines, for deepening our addiction 
to fossil fuels, they cry crocodile tears. 
They said we need to plunder our own 
lands and waters in order to lower 
prices for Americans, in order to en-
sure national independence from for-
eign oil sources, and then they ex-
ported that oil overseas. That was 
their plan all along. It wasn’t so secret. 
It was obvious because that is how the 
American 
Petroleum 
Institute—the 
American 
Prevarication 
Institute— 
works. 
But that argument is now leakier 
than an old oil tanker, and it has been 
proven again and again. Every bill that 
came up approving the Keystone XL 
Pipeline—drilling for oil off our coast, 
selling off our public lands to whatever 
bidder showed up—I just asked the 
same thing every single time. In 2011, 
in 2012, in 2015, every time, I asked Re-
publicans if they would agree to ban 
any exports from these projects and 
keep Americans from bearing the envi-
ronmental and health burden from 
projects that provide no benefit to 
their own families, to their own States. 
And 
every 
time, 
the 
Republicans 
blocked or rejected my amendments— 
every time. That proved their argu-
ments won’t hold water. 
The Big Oil-backed push to extract 
more and more from American lands 
and waters was never about helping 
Americans at the pump. It was about 
pumping up the profits of Big Oil by 
getting a higher price out on the inter-
national marketplace for American oil, 
for American natural gas. That was 
their plan. 
I am sick of the hypocrisy. I am sick 
of letting the American Petroleum In-
stitute’s prevarication triumph over 
the truth. I am sick of watching Amer-
icans deal with the climate crisis with 
dirty air, with dirty water, with high 
gas prices just to help the oil compa-
nies make a buck by getting the high-
est price they can on the international 
market exporting American oil. 
The Republicans’ push to use the cri-
sis in Ukraine to line Big Oil’s pockets 
isn’t about addressing inflation at 
home. It is about inflating fossil fuel 
profits for Big Oil and big gas. In 2021, 
as gasoline prices increased by over 50 
percent, ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell, 
BP and Total Energies recorded their 
biggest profits that they had seen in 8 
years. 
In 2015, before the Republicans lifted 
the export ban—before the American 
Petroleum Institute got the Congress 
to vote to lift the ban on the export of 
American oil—China imported 191,000 
barrels of oil from the United States. 
Now we send four times as much oil to 
China as we did back in the beginning 
of 2016 after the ban was lifted. To put 
it another way, we now import from 
Russia 600,000 barrels of oil a day, and 
we export to China 600,000 barrels of oil 
a day. What is wrong with that pic-
ture? 
Our natural resources go to China, 
which they then use to fabricate prod-
ucts, which then they sell back to us 
undermining our own industries. And 
meanwhile, to make up for it, we im-
port 600,000 barrels of oil from Russia 
and line the pockets of Putin, which al-
lows him to buy the tanks, the planes, 
the infantry to assault and destroy a 
democracy in Ukraine. 
This is a formula for failure of his-
toric magnitude. And it was all so clear 
in that debate in 2015 when the Repub-
licans led the effort to lift the ban on 
the export of our oil. It was oh-so clear 
what was going to happen, which is 
why I led the fight here on the Senate 
floor to block the lifting of that ban. 
But I don’t want to hear from the Re-
publicans with their crocodile tears 
how much they care about importation 
of oil from Russia because the bottom 
line is, we now import 8.6 million bar-
rels of oil a day into the United States. 
We now have a crisis on our hands that 
we have to ultimately deal with. We 
export 8.6 million barrels of oil a day. 
We export out of our country 8.6 mil-
lion barrels of oil a day. 
So I hear from Republicans, ‘‘Oh, we 
need energy independence.’’ Well, what 
are we doing exporting 8.6 million bar-
rels of oil a day? What is that all 
about? We know what it is all about. It 
is about the American Petroleum Insti-
tute. It is about Big Oil and Big Gas 
getting a higher price on the inter-
national market than they get on the 
domestic market. That is what it was 
all about from the very beginning. We 
have an opportunity here to stop, fi-
nally, Big Oil’s relentless quest for 
profit, which is funding Putin’s war at 
the same time it undermines our com-
petitiveness with China. 
More leases are not going to help our 
allies in Europe. We are already send-
ing our oil to the highest bidder. Oil 
and gas companies already have leases 
the size of Indiana. Let me say that 
again. The oil and gas industry has bid 
for, over the last two decades, leases to 
drill on the property owned by the 
American people. And 53 percent of 
those leases have yet to be drilled 
upon. That is the truth. If they are se-
rious—which they are not—they should 
start drilling. If their crocodile tears 
are real, in fact, they should just start 
drilling. 
But, of course, they are not going to 
because they—by squatting on those 
lands—keep the price of oil high. They 
keep the price of natural gas high. And 
Japan and South Korea and China right 
now get more of our imports than any 
other country. If oil companies really 
wanted to help Europe get off Russian 
gas, they could do that right now with 
the resources they have. Let me say 
that again. Oil companies could help 
Europe get off Russian natural gas 
right now with the resources they 
have, but that is not what they want. 
They want unfettered profit, more pub-
lic lands, and more power on the global 
market. And that profit—that oil- 
soaked 
power—has 
directly 
fueled 
Putin’s war on Ukraine. 
So there is a different pathway, and 
we have to commit to destroying de-
mand for Putin’s dirty energy business 
model by powering our country with 
clean, American-made renewable en-
ergy. And we can power our way to 
peace. An additional 16 million electric 
vehicles on the road in the United 
States would replace all of the oil that 
we import from Russia on a daily basis. 
By passing the $555 billion invest-
ment in clean energy and climate jus-
tice, we can build a ‘‘made in America’’ 
clean energy economy that delivers 
real 
energy 
independence. 
We 
can 
unlock a safe, healthy future and 
untether ourselves from Putin’s dirty 
profits. With tax credits and rebates in 
wind and solar, offshore wind, trans-
mission, electric vehicles, heat pumps, 
and advanced domestic manufacturing, 
we can cut costs at home while cutting 
off Putin’s money pipeline. These in-
vestments would reduce our depend-
ence on global oil markets and instead 
power our country through localized 
clean energy. 
Our Federal climate policies, our 
Federal energy policies are exactly 
what we need in this moment—this na-
tional security, moral, and economic 
moment. We don’t need to power our 
Nation on Russian oil and sell off our 
forest and seas for an unnecessary Big

Oil land grab when they already have 
an area the size of Indiana that they 
are not drilling on because that in-
creases their profits right now. We 
don’t need to pay for Russia’s invasion 
of Ukraine through Russian imports 
while paying higher prices at the pump 
to support profiteering and exports. 
Let’s wake up and win the renewable 
race to the future. Let’s reject fossil- 
fueled greed for what that is—just 
greed. Let’s protect our allies by de-
stroying Putin’s business model and 
delivering a future powered by domes-
tic clean energy. That is the promise of 
peace. That is the promise to the whole 
world, to live on a safe planet. This is 
the promise we must make to the next 
generation of American young people 
and young people of the world, that we 
are going to power a clean energy revo-
lution of wind and solar and all-electric 
vehicles and battery storage tech-
nologies, and we are going to destroy 
the business model of Russia and de-
stroy the business models of other 
petrostates around the world with 
American innovation. 
That is what the young people of our 
country and the world should expect 
from this generation and this Senate in 
2022 on the floor of the United States 
Senate. That is the debate which we 
should have this year on behalf of a 
safer, more peaceful, more healthy, and 
more moral world. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
UKRAINE 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, I call on 
this body to support the people of 
Ukraine fighting for their lives right 
now, today. Our mandate to act is 
clear. 
Here is a little bit of history for this 
body. In 1994, in the months following 
the end of the Cold War, Ukraine was 
very fragile, working through the chal-
lenges of establishing and sustaining 
democratic government, while sitting 
atop the world’s third largest stockpile 
of nuclear weapons, arms abandoned in 
the final days of the Soviet Union. 
The United States intervened. In ex-
change for protection by the greatest 
superpower in the history of the world, 
Ukraine dismantled and surrendered 
their nuclear armament entirely. That 
agreement made the world a safer 
place, but Vladimir Putin called the 
United States to the carpet on our 
agreement last week. He gambled that 
America would again abandon our part-
ners, as we did in Afghanistan. Putin 
gambled that U.S. treaties and agree-
ments are no more valuable than the 
paper they are written on. He didn’t 
bet against the Ukrainians, where he 
has every military advantage in a 
head-to-head conflict. His criminal in-
vasion—now a bloody war of aggression 
against Ukraine—was a bet against 
American supremacy. 
We cannot allow Putin to get away 
with it. The American people don’t 
want us to either. Over 80 percent of 
Americans want us to do more to bring 
down 
Vladimir 
Putin, 
stand 
with 
Ukraine, and end this conflict. They 
are not just feeling the impacts of the 
invasion at the gas pump, the grocery 
store, and in their retirement ac-
counts; they feel it in their hearts. 
We are the greatest Nation on the 
face of the planet. We stand for free-
dom. But our greatness and our stand-
ing are only as strong as our world. 
The American people know it, and they 
are looking for us to act. 
Unfortunately, the U.S. response to 
this point is at best incomplete. It is 
tepid. It is halfhearted and impassive 
to the Russian bear that is looking to 
clamp down on the free world. This 
President and his administration are 
allowing the Germans, the Canadians, 
the Latvians, the Dutch, and the Swiss 
to lead in arming Ukraine. 
This body, my colleagues, I implore 
you, we can do more, and we can do it 
better. We have seen the classified re-
ports. We all understand, all 100 of us, 
that the Ukrainians are in dire need of 
our aid right now—not tomorrow, not 
next week, now. We also know the vol-
ume of not just combat capability but 
logistics supplies, secure communica-
tions equipment, and medical kits that 
we have purchased and staged all 
around the world to secure our part-
ners. 
My amendment does not spend an-
other dime of taxpayer money; it calls 
on the Secretary of Defense to mobilize 
existing equipment, including provi-
sions meant for Afghanistan, to arm 
Ukraine. This equipment will never be 
used by U.S. forces, but it is simply sit-
ting in warehouses across the world. It 
belongs at the Polish border and in the 
hands of Ukrainians, who are fighting 
for their lives as I am speaking here on 
the floor today. 
We know we have capabilities that 
we bought for the Afghans that could 
be loaded and flown to Poland to help 
our counterparts. That is open source. 
That information is out there. We have 
other capabilities as well that you all 
know belong in the hands of our 
Ukrainian friends. This administra-
tion’s doctrine of appeasement has pro-
vided more arms for the Taliban than 
for the sovereign nation of Ukraine, 
and it is not even close. 
The administration’s abandonment of 
Afghanistan drew deserved condemna-
tion from Democrats and Republicans 
in this body, but today and every day 
we don’t act to arm our partners in 
Ukraine, we will be held to account. If 
we don’t act now, this body’s lack of 
immediate attention and action on this 
matter will be recorded in history. 
We took an oath to ‘‘support and de-
fend the Constitution of the United 
States against all enemies, foreign and 
domestic.’’ That obligates us to secure 
the homefront but also to stand with 
our allies and partners. Our oath de-
mands Congress—just as it demands 
our men and women in uniform—pro-
tect the American people. That vow 
compels us to honor our commitments 
abroad, stand with freedom, and do 
what the American people sent us here 
to do. 
The fight for Ukraine doesn’t end 
today. I will continue to advocate for 
already procured equipment and capa-
bilities that are programmed, budg-
eted, contracted, purchased, and sit-
ting in containers unused to go to 
those who need it the most. 
Let’s execute our oath today. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana. 
S.J. RES. 38 
Mr. BRAUN. Mr. President, I rise 
here today—we are going to be voting 
here later on. In a recent Monmouth 
poll in January, respondents were 
asked if they agreed with this state-
ment: ‘‘COVID is here to stay and we 
just need to get on with our lives [and 
live with it].’’ Seventy percent said 
they did agree with this, including half 
of all Democrats. 
We have been through 2 years where 
we have been from here to there on it— 
if an early believer, take it seriously. 
We didn’t know what it was going to 
have in store for us, but I think we do 
now. 
So often you hear: Listen to the data; 
look at the science. Too often, it has 
kind of been the political science of it. 
Vaccinations and natural immunity 
mean that a large majority of our 
country is already protected. Hos-
pitalizations, serious illness, and even 
death from COVID we can see are real-
ly going in the right direction, thank 
goodness. 
As therapeutics continue to improve, 
it is clear that most Americans are 
right—COVID is here to stay. It is en-
demic. We can’t marinate in fear. We 
can’t have lockdowns. We can’t have 
one-size-fits-all for across the country. 
We have got to get on with our lives. 
President Biden recently extended 
the Federal state of emergency under 
the National Emergencies Act indefi-
nitely. I would like to point out, he is 
not alone there in the sense that most 
of our Governors have done the same. I 
only think in Florida and in Iowa—I 
would say that I am guessing most citi-
zens living in a lot of these places 
would like their Governors to do like-
wise. This state of emergency makes 
robust powers available to the Presi-
dent during a crisis. It includes for-
giving student loans, imposing travel 
restrictions, capital investments in 
neighborhoods deemed to be dispropor-
tionately affected by COVID. 
When this emergency was first de-
clared 2 years ago this week, it was 
needed. It was uncertain. It was grati-
fying to see that, in a bipartisan way, 
in March of 2020, we came together. 
But we have learned so much since 
then. Now, I think it has become a bur-
den. 
I cite 3 weeks ago—it was in a class-
room in Las Vegas. You ought to look 
it up. It was announced there—this is 
different, but it was a mandate. It was 
that you had to wear a mask in the 
classroom. The kids, I think, embodied

what this whole process has been about 
and that we are at a different place. It 
looked like they won the State cham-
pionship in something. 
We are there. Congress has a respon-
sibility to vote on whether to approve 
these emergency declarations, as we 
will today. 
Every State and community is easing 
COVID restrictions, and many of them 
have eliminated them entirely. Ideally, 
you fight something like this with 
maybe general guidance from here, but 
you let government where it is closest 
to the people dictate how this stuff 
should happen and how long it should 
be there. 
It is past time for the President and 
Governors across the country to give 
up the extra powers granted to them 
under the COVID emergency declara-
tions. If we are going to live with this 
virus and move forward as a country, 
we must end the national emergency 
authorization, and other Governors 
across the country should follow suit. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
Mr. MARSHALL. I rise today in sup-
port of S.J. Res. 38, a resolution to ter-
minate the COVID–19 national emer-
gency declaration. 
After nearly 2 years of living under 
this state of emergency, the American 
people are worn out and yearning to 
breathe free. They long for their God- 
given freedoms and for leaders to take 
their side. 
We as a nation must begin to learn to 
live with COVID. The robust powers 
this emergency declaration provides 
the Federal Government are no longer 
necessary, and Congress must debate 
and ultimately repeal them in order to 
begin the process of unwinding the 
powers the government took hold of 
during the peak of the crisis. 
As we contemplate what returning to 
normal means, most Americans accept 
that COVID will likely never be en-
tirely behind us, and setting zero 
COVID cases as a victory condition is 
more harmful than good. 
That being said, of course, we have to 
respect the virus and protect the vul-
nerable, but we also must accept that 
personal responsibility, not govern-
ment mandates and restrictions, must 
govern our approach to the virus going 
forward. 
We must repeal this emergency dec-
laration today to deliver a symbolic 
victory to our citizens that normalcy 
is around the corner and that limited 
government 
and 
our 
constitutional 
rights still reign supreme. It is high 
time to stop talking about restrictions 
and the unknown. We must chart a new 
course to victory today that respects 
the virus and our freedoms. 
Let’s look back on the recent history 
of this national emergency declaration. 
On March 13, 2020, President Trump 
first declared the national emergency 
concerning the novel coronavirus dis-
ease outbreak. 
Two days prior, following an alarm-
ing rate of transmission, the World 
Health 
Organization 
had 
declared 
COVID–19 as a global pandemic. Little 
was known about the rapidly spreading 
virus 
at 
the 
time, 
but 
President 
Trump’s declaration was intended to 
grant himself, as Chief Executive, addi-
tional authorities to bolster the Fed-
eral Government’s efforts to control 
the virus and ease the burden on our 
healthcare system. 
Less than a week later, California be-
came the first State to issue a state-
wide 
stay-at-home 
order, 
and 
lockdowns, mask mandates, school clo-
sures, and capacity limits commenced 
all across the Nation. 
These were the earliest and most 
frightening days of the pandemic, when 
our understanding of the virus was 
minimal and all measures were needed 
to react to a globe contagion unlike 
anything seen in nearly a century. 
Almost a year later, and just over a 
month after his inauguration, in Feb-
ruary 2021, President Biden justifiably 
went on to extend the COVID–19 na-
tional emergency declaration for an-
other year, a requirement under the 
National Emergencies Act that had it 
not been acted on, would have resulted 
in the automatic termination of the 
declaration. 
At the time of President Biden’s ini-
tial extension, only 50 million doses of 
the vaccine had been administered, and 
eligibility 
was 
largely 
limited 
to 
healthcare workers, first responders, 
and the most vulnerable populations. It 
would still be weeks or months before 
all adults would be eligible in all 50 
States. Viral treatments and thera-
peutics were scarcely available to the 
public. All the while, the potentially 
more severe and contagious Delta vari-
ant was brewing in other regions of the 
world before it was detected and be-
came the dominant variant here at 
home. 
The situation on the ground in the 
United States has changed drastically 
since those early stages of the pan-
demic. Thanks to American innovation 
and Operation Warp Speed, the United 
States 
has 
now 
multiple 
vaccines 
available to all Americans over the age 
of 5. Everyone ages 12 and older is eligi-
ble for a booster shot if they want that 
inoculation. 
In fact, more than 550 million shots 
have been administered in the United 
States, with 215 million people fully 
vaccinated, including 89 percent of in-
dividuals 65 and older. Additionally, 
the FDA has authorized two oral 
antivirals, and monoclonal antibody 
treatments are available for those at 
high risk of becoming seriously ill. 
Well done. Well done. 
Omicron is now the dominant variant 
in the United States, accounting for 97 
percent of the cases. While more con-
tagious, Omicron tends to result in 
more mild symptoms in infected indi-
viduals. In Kansas, the daily case aver-
age in recent weeks has decreased 99 
percent. Let me say that again. The 
daily case average has decreased 99 per-
cent. Hospitalizations are down about 
80 percent, and deaths are down 98 per-
cent. Nationally, we are seeing drastic 
decreases in these same three cat-
egories as well. But perhaps even more 
importantly, today, at least 94 percent 
of Americans have some level of immu-
nization. 
Accordingly, States in every corner 
of the Nation are repealing indoor 
mask mandates, including blue States 
that have most adamantly enforced 
them. 
Yes, 
indeed, 
freedom-loving 
Americans who are worn out by the 
draconian lockdowns and mandates are 
giving a sigh of relief. 
Despite all these advances in our po-
sition of a much greater understanding 
of the virus, President Biden stealthily 
extended the national emergency dec-
laration once again on a late Friday 
afternoon 2 weeks ago. 
Next, let us lay out some of the ef-
fects these policies have had on the 
American people and why we must 
abandon this approach, shrink the Fed-
eral response, and move toward a more 
nimble and effectively locally based 
community strategy that allows indi-
vidual citizens and local health offi-
cials to exercise and promote old-fash-
ioned self-responsibility and individual 
choice. 
The first COVID–19 wave in the 
spring of 2020 took the world by sur-
prise. The spread of the cases globally 
and in the United States was met with 
government-ordered lockdowns abroad 
and here at home. In just a few weeks, 
lockdowns put more than 10 million 
Americans out of work, with 6.6 mil-
lion people applying for unemployment 
benefits in the last week of March 
alone. 
These lockdowns, some of which ex-
tended for months in certain States, 
and the subsequent mandates and re-
quirements that still remain in place 
have had dramatically negative im-
pacts on our quality of life and had 
been minimally beneficial. 
A recent study from Johns Hopkins 
University found lockdowns only re-
duced the COVID–19 death rate by 0.2 
percent—0.2 percent—2 out of 1,000. 
These researchers noted that while 
‘‘lockdowns have had little to no public 
health effects, they have imposed enor-
mous economic and social costs where 
they have been adopted.’’ 
These costs have been felt at an 
alarming rate in a number of aspects of 
American life. Drug overdose deaths 
rose by 30 percent in 2020, hitting the 
highest number ever recorded. Symp-
toms of anxiety or depressive disorder 
and the use of mental health care 
among adults increased by 36 percent 
from August 2020 to February of 2021. 
The numbers for our children are 
even more troubling—our children, our 
grandchildren. The CDC found between 
March and October 2020, emergency de-
partment visits for mental health 
emergencies rose by 24 percent for chil-
dren ages 5 through 11 and 31 percent 
for children ages 12 to 17 years. 
In addition, emergency department 
visits for suspected suicide attempts

March 3, 2022 
increased nearly 51 percent among girls 
ages 12 through 17—51 percent—in early 
2021 compared to the same period in 
2019. 
School closures in the 2020–2021 aca-
demic year left students, on average, 5 
months behind in mathematics and 4 
months behind in reading. Disadvan-
taged and low-income schools dis-
proportionately, of course, felt that 
impact. 
These societal ills have been com-
pounded by mask mandates, vaccine 
mandates, and isolation orders. Keep-
ing this emergency declaration in place 
will cause—will cause—public health 
officials and governments at all levels 
to maintain the possibility of allowing 
them to remain or resurrecting them. 
And much like America’s alcohol 
prohibition a century ago, these man-
dates will make criminals out of all of 
us, as we all are guilty of disregarding 
them at one time or another. This only 
creates more disrespect for law and 
order. We can’t allow this to happen. 
And I have to add this: The mortality 
rate from COVID for the United States 
is 75 percent higher than Sweden’s—75 
percent higher than Sweden’s—despite 
Sweden issuing no shutdowns or mask 
mandates. Not surprisingly, Sweden’s 
economy is humming ahead of ours at 
a 5-percent rate above prepandemic 
levels. 
All this being said, once again, I beg 
this administration and the national 
media to stop fearmongering, to share 
all the science, and, please, let our peo-
ple go. 
The Democrats’ COVID obsession has 
also resulted in out-of-control spending 
and massive debt. Congress has appro-
priated $6 trillion. That is 6 times 10 to 
the 12th—6 with 12 zeroes after it—$6 
trillion to respond to this crisis. This 
means Federal spending to combat the 
pandemic has well surpassed the $4.1 
trillion the United States spent waging 
World War II. Throw in the roughly $1.5 
trillion on World War I, the Korean 
war, Vietnam, and the Gulf war com-
bined, and it still would not exceed 
what has been spent on COVID relief. 
Let me say that another way. We 
borrowed from my children, my grand-
children, your children and grand-
children. We borrowed and spent more 
money on COVID than all the major 
wars combined form the 20th century. 
While the $2.2 trillion CARES Act 
passed with nearly unanimous consent 
in both this body and the House, Presi-
dent Biden and the Democrats in Con-
gress insisted more was needed. 
Despite warnings from economists on 
all ends of the political spectrum that 
it would harm our economy, Democrats 
rammed through a highly partisan $1.9 
trillion more of a spending package 
that has overheated our economy. This 
bill was in response to a problem that 
was already fixing itself. 
Shockingly, I have to point out, only 
9 percent of this funding was related to 
healthcare, and less than 1 percent was 
dedicated to vaccines. Instead, the 
funding, like the drawnout, unneces-
sary, heavy-handed health restrictions, 
was 
meant 
to 
implement 
drastic 
changes in our way of life and system 
of governance and expand Big Govern-
ment socialism, not to mention it has 
resulted in the highest level of infla-
tion we have seen in this country in 40 
years. As one economist put it, the 
U.S. stimulus has been in a ‘‘category 
of its own’’ and has resulted in more 
inflation than almost any other ad-
vanced economy in the world. 
With hundreds of billions of dollars of 
funds for schools and State govern-
ments 
unspent, 
the 
President 
an-
nounced during his State of the Union 
that he plans to send a supplemental 
COVID relief funding request to Con-
gress. Our Nation’s emergency posture 
to this virus is driving out-of-control 
spending, fueling inflation, and strap-
ping our children and, again, our 
grandchildren, with more than $30 tril-
lion in debt. 
Indeed, at this time, our national 
debt is a greater threat to our Nation 
than COVID. This alone is another rea-
son to end this declaration. 
Now let me turn to the executive’s 
emergency 
authority—the 
executive 
branch’s 
emergency 
authority 
and 
Congress’s role in delegating those 
powers. Since article II of the Constitu-
tion does not grant the President emer-
gency powers, all such authority is 
granted by Congress. Many of these au-
thorities are provided through three 
laws: the National Emergencies Act, 
which is what we are focused on today; 
the Stafford Act; and the Public Health 
Service Act. 
All three have been applied by this 
administration to the COVID response, 
but the National Emergencies Act 
grants congressional oversight over a 
declaration by the President. Before I 
get into the need to exercise that con-
gressional authority, let me quickly 
discuss what repealing this emergency 
declaration will not do. Let’s talk 
about what it won’t do. 
First, terminating this emergency 
declaration will not impact the title 42 
order currently in place and being exer-
cised at our southern border that al-
lows border officials to expel illegal 
aliens. Again, this will not impact title 
42. The crisis at the United States-Mex-
ico border has been fueled by this ad-
ministration’s 
decision 
to 
resume 
catch-and-release, halt construction of 
the border wall, and promise half a mil-
lion dollars to immigrant families who 
broke our laws. 
As a result, the number of illegal 
aliens crossing our southern border is 
at the highest level in more than 20 
years under President Biden. 
I can assure you, Republicans’ inten-
tion is not to take away the only tool 
being utilized at our southern border to 
stem the tide of illegal immigrants 
pouring in. The authority for this order 
lies within the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services’ public health emer-
gency declaration made on January 31, 
2020, under the Public Health Service 
Act. 
The most recent internal review of 
title 42 submitted by CDC Director 
Walensky on February 2 found that the 
order needed to remain in place. Re-
publicans agree—we agree—that the 
external 
threat 
of 
COVID 
coming 
across the border unchecked from 
other nations preserves the need for 
this order to remain in place and for us 
to pass legislation outside of these 
emergency declarations to further se-
cure our porous border. 
Second, terminating the emergency 
declaration would not impact the waiv-
ers issued by the HHS Secretary. Let 
me say that again. Terminating the 
emergency declaration would not im-
pact the waivers issued by the HHS 
Secretary. These critical flexibilities— 
including increased access to care via 
telehealth—have been crucial to our 
ability to combat the virus. The tele-
health waivers will not be impacted by 
removing the NEA. 
And, in fact, I am a cosponsor of leg-
islation to make many of these suc-
cessful telehealth waivers permanent, 
and we must do so after the public 
health emergency expires, and we re-
turn to normal. 
Until today, Congress has failed to 
fulfill our duty and oversight respon-
sibilities laid out in the National 
Emergencies Act, ceding immense, un-
checked power to the executive branch. 
We must, as the Democratic Represent-
ative from the great State of Ken-
tucky, Romano Mazzoli, stated when 
this bill was being debated in 1975. I 
will quote Representative Mazzoli, the 
Democrat from Kentucky. 
Consciously and deliberately [we must] 
force ourselves to come to grips periodi-
cally—and ultimately—[deal] with the vex-
ing problems of national emergencies. The 
blame as well as the glory will be on the 
shoulders of the Congress. . . . But that is as 
it is supposed to be—that is the responsible 
course. 
The blame and the glory should re-
main on the shoulders of Congress, and 
that is why we are here today. We are 
here today to debate this responsible 
course moving forward. 
While the COVID–19 emergency dec-
laration has not utilized all powers 
provided to the President, major ac-
tions have been taken as a direct result 
of the declaration. Our Ready Reserve 
remains active, our Coast Guard is 
stretched, and the staggeringly expen-
sive student loan relief remains in 
place. 
More importantly, though, this dec-
laration drives our Federal Govern-
ment to maintain its massive emer-
gency 
response 
infrastructure 
and 
drives leftwing politicians in Congress 
to push harmful mandates and unre-
strained spending. 
These powers are no longer needed. 
We have tools to minimize the impact 
of this virus and truly live with it. 
This idea of living with COVID is not 
a fringe position held by Republicans. 
Democratic New Jersey Governor Phil 
Murphy recently said it was time to, 
and I will quote him, ‘‘learn how to 
live’’ with it. Democratic Governors in

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S978 
March 3, 2022 
Nevada, Rhode Island, New York, Cali-
fornia—I will say California again— 
Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, and 
Oregon have announced they are lifting 
certain mask mandates and easing 
other restrictions. 
Internationally, the United Kingdom, 
Australia, and New Zealand are work-
ing 
towards 
‘‘living 
with 
COVID’’ 
phases. Just last week, the British 
Prime Minister announced that part of 
his ‘‘living with COVID’’ plan would 
even include the repeal of legislation 
and legal requirements for those who 
test positive for COVID to self-isolate. 
While President Biden claimed dur-
ing his State of the Union Address 
that—and I will quote him—‘‘we are 
moving forward safely, back to . . . 
normal routines,’’ his actions don’t 
match his words. His call for a ‘‘reset’’ 
and claims to be loosening government 
intrusion into our lives by way of 
COVID 
restrictions 
are 
only 
half- 
truths. We know this because all these 
next items are true: 
Despite being presented with the dev-
astating effects of lockdowns, school 
and indoor mask mandates, and other 
restrictions, the President renewed the 
Federal Government’s national emer-
gency declaration again. In fact, the 
President just hours ago issued a veto 
threat of this resolution should it 
make it to his desk—the President 
promising a veto before we even have 
this vote on the Senate floor. 
The CDC continues to hide data 
points they believe would be ‘‘misinter-
preted’’ by those outside of the swamp 
they view as ignorant. The people—the 
people—are so much smarter than they 
are given credit for. This data gives in-
formation on who is receiving booster 
shots, the effectiveness of vaccines for 
certain age groups, and figures related 
to reinfections. This allows the Federal 
Government to suppress information 
that contradicts their one-size-fits-all 
policy and approach and preserves in-
trusive government policies. 
Next, despite the President patting 
himself on the back for relaxing mask 
mandates, we still have in place the 
CDC order that requires masks on air-
planes, in Ubers, and on your children’s 
schoolbuses. 
The administration has only with-
drawn one of their vaccine mandates, 
the OSHA mandate on employers with 
more than 100 employees, after—only 
after—the Supreme Court struck it 
down. Three mandates are thankfully 
enjoined by the courts, but deadlines 
for the CMS mandate on healthcare 
workers are beginning to be enforced. 
Just yesterday, on this floor, 44 Sen-
ate Democrats voted to keep the man-
date in place despite its constitutional 
violation of State police powers, harm 
to an already weak healthcare work-
force, and outdated science that guided 
the promulgation of the rule. 
Next, 
the 
President’s 
National 
COVID–19 Preparedness Plan asks Con-
gress to approve funding that would ex-
pand the production of vaccines to 1 
billion doses a year. That equates to 
three doses for every person—three 
doses per American. Do they plan to 
mandate these? Dr. Fauci recently led 
us to believe that indeed might be the 
case, and I will quote Dr. Fauci: ‘‘The 
potential future requirement for an ad-
ditional boost . . . is being carefully 
monitored in real time.’’ 
While we prevented separated mem-
bers of the military from receiving dis-
honorable discharges for choosing not 
to get the vaccine, the Defense Depart-
ment has kicked out hundreds of our 
bravest service men and women. 
How can the President downplay the 
progress we have made in our ability to 
combat the virus? And, more impor-
tantly, how can he continue to pursue 
an invasive and coercive Federal re-
sponse that has eroded our freedoms 
and spread misery throughout this Na-
tion? Does he not hear the cry of the 
people who have given him the power 
to be President? 
As the United States enters the third 
year of COVID–19, 70 percent of Ameri-
cans agree that it is time we accepted 
that COVID is here to stay and that we 
just need to get on with our lives—70 
percent of Americans. We can’t get 
Americans to decide where to go to 
lunch together, let alone on an issue 
this big, and 70 percent of Americans 
maintain these policies are no longer 
about science or about public health or 
the will of the people. That is all a 
guise. 
This is about power and using a glob-
al pandemic to grow government and 
lurch our Nation toward socialism. The 
suffering caused by the government’s 
actions has had an immense impact on 
the daily lives of Americans in ways 
that will take years to correct, if ever. 
We now know that these actions were 
wrong. The same people who argued to 
keep this emergency declaration in 
place are the same people who were 
wrong in their advocacy for these gov-
ernment actions. 
They were wrong when they told you 
not to be afraid to go to Chinese New 
Year celebrations when the first cases 
were detected in the United States. 
They were wrong when they said it 
was racist to suspend inbound travel 
from China. 
They were wrong when they called 
you a conspiracy theorist for believing 
it was possible for this virus to have 
developed in nature or to have leaked 
from a laboratory. 
They were wrong when they told you 
lockdowns must remain in place. 
They were wrong when they told you 
masking your children was the only 
way they could attend in-person class-
es safely. 
They were wrong when they told you 
massive stimulus spending was nec-
essary and would not lead to inflation. 
They were wrong when they told you 
that inflation would be transitory. 
And they were wrong when they de-
nied that natural immunity provided a 
strong defense against COVID infection 
and severe symptoms. They were wrong 
when they denied that natural immu-
nity provided a strong defense against 
COVID infection and severe symptoms. 
They have been wrong nearly every 
step of the way during the response to 
this pandemic—always a day late and a 
dollar spent in the wrong direction. 
Yet here they are, these same individ-
uals who now reside in the White House 
and hold majorities in Congress, telling 
us it would be detrimental to our own 
health to repeal the President’s na-
tional emergency declaration. Their 
motivation is not genuine. It is a bla-
tant effort to further extend the mas-
sive accumulation of power that the 
Federal 
Government 
has 
extended 
across America for the last 2 years. 
Today, the Senate has an oppor-
tunity to act to rein in this control and 
reassert our article I authorities. The 
Constitution demands it. The authors 
of the National Emergencies Act de-
mand it. The protection of American 
liberties demands it. 
We have the tools to protect the vul-
nerable and our populous is near full 
herd immunity, with 94 percent of 
Americans having some level of immu-
nity now. Let’s not listen to those who 
have wronged us and have been proven 
incorrect 
countless 
times 
before 
throughout this pandemic. Let’s listen 
to common sense and reason. Let’s lis-
ten to science, and let’s listen to the 
people. 
Let’s abandon the COVID obsession 
and groupthink that has infiltrated the 
highest ranks of government, and let’s 
return the ability to make decisions re-
lated to the virus back to the Amer-
ican people. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
KING). The Senator from Montana. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 3214 
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, all in 1 
year, President Biden killed the Key-
stone XL Pipeline; he banned new oil 
and gas leases on Federal lands; then, 
of course, he ended up begging OPEC 
and Russia to produce more abroad and 
then gave the green light to Russia’s 
Nord Stream 2 Pipeline. These actions 
diminished American energy security. 
It hurt our allies and empowered our 
adversaries. 
They 
put 
the 
United 
States and our partners in the cross-
hairs of Russia and Vladimir Putin. 
At the State of the Union Address, I 
heard the President say we need more 
‘‘made in America,’’ ‘‘made in Amer-
ica,’’ ‘‘made in America.’’ What I didn’t 
hear him say was that we needed more 
‘‘made in America’’ energy or more 
‘‘made in America’’ oil and natural gas. 
My bill, the Supporting Made in 
America Renewable and Traditional 
Energy Act, or the SMART Energy 
Act, will help get the United States 
back on track and ensure that our 
country will remain not only energy 
independent and energy secure but that 
it will become a global energy domi-
nant player. 
My bill supports an ‘‘all of the 
above’’ American energy portfolio. I 
want to emphasize that. It is an ‘‘all of 
the above’’ American energy portfolio.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S979 
March 3, 2022 
It doesn’t exclude renewables; it in-
cludes renewables by requiring the 
Biden administration to restart oil and 
gas leasing and kick-start renewable 
energy development on Federal land 
and waters because now, more than 
ever, we need to be supporting Amer-
ican energy development to help lower 
energy costs for American families and 
support our allies. 
Take a look at what is happening in 
Europe and Russia as it relates to en-
ergy prices and national security, all of 
which, of course, are interconnected. 
We should examine what Germany has 
done over the course of the last 10 to 15 
years as an example of what not to do. 
By the way, it takes, I guess, a war on 
Germany’s doorstep to suddenly pro-
vide clarity for the Germans to see, 
yes, they need to be increasing their 
investment in NATO. Now, they just in 
the last 2 weeks decided they are going 
to permit two new LNG ports. While 
looking in the rearview mirror, they 
shut down 11 nuclear plants, and they 
shut down coal plants. They were not 
moving forward with LNG plants. In-
stead, they wanted that Nord Stream 2 
Pipeline built to Russia. Well, they 
have changed their thinking on it. 
We can’t let America get to that 
same point of following this path of the 
very dangerous ideology of shutting 
down ‘‘made in America’’ energy be-
cause, as Europe has continued to stop 
investing in traditional energy, they 
have become more dependent on adver-
saries like Russia for energy, and now, 
the cost of energy is skyrocketing. 
Sadly, this, indeed, is a sneak peek 
into the path that America is headed 
down if the Biden administration con-
tinues to stonewall traditional Amer-
ican energy development. We can’t let 
this happen. 
Listen, I support an ‘‘all of the 
above’’ energy portfolio. I am grateful 
I represent a State that has ‘‘all of the 
above energy.’’ We have bright skies; 
we have solar potential; we are a head-
water State; we have amazing hydro 
resources; we have got winds that come 
off of our mountains for wind energy. 
Yet an ‘‘all of the above’’ approach in-
cludes not just renewables but oil, gas, 
nuclear, and coal. 
That is why it is critical that we pass 
my bill today to promote renewable 
and traditional energy here in the 
United States. It is good for growing 
jobs, strengthening our energy secu-
rity, supporting our allies, and keeping 
a reliable and cost-effective source of 
energy for the American people. 
The question we should all be asking 
ourselves is, Do we want the world to 
be looking to Russia for energy or to 
the United States for energy? 
My bill supports the latter, and I 
urge my colleagues to pass it. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Committee on Energy 
and Natural Resources be discharged 
from further consideration of S. 3214 
and that the Senate proceed to its im-
mediate consideration. Further, I ask 
unanimous consent that the bill be 
considered read a third time and passed 
and that the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Massachusetts. 
Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, in re-
serving the right to object, I rise today 
to object to the motion from the Sen-
ator from Montana to pass this bill 
through unanimous consent. 
This push to put every square inch of 
Federal land up for sale is not a new 
one. It has been the plan of the Amer-
ican Petroleum Institute from the be-
ginning of recorded time. It is not help-
ing the Ukrainians in their fight, and 
it is not helping our European allies. It 
is helping inflate the profits of big oil 
and big gas companies. 
In 2021 and 2020, we exported more 
crude oil and petroleum than we im-
ported. Since 2015, when every Repub-
lican on their side lifted the ban on the 
exportation of American oil—that is 
what they wanted is their plan, that of 
the American Petroleum Institute—we 
now export 8.6 million barrels of oil out 
of our country every single day. With-
out question, whenever I have heard 
anything about energy independence, 
well, that was the natural consequence 
of lifting the ban on the exportation of 
our oil, and now, it is up to 8.6 million 
barrels a day. 
As a matter of fact, in 2021, we actu-
ally exported 650,000 barrels of oil a day 
to China as we were importing 600,000 
barrels of oil a day from Russia be-
cause that is what the American Petro-
leum Institute wanted—a globalization 
of this oil market—with the American 
consumer and the American economy 
just caught, ultimately, in an eco-
nomic crossfire, which is where we are 
right now. We give China our natural 
resources so that they can produce a 
finished product. Meanwhile, we have 
to import 600,000 barrels of oil from 
Russia to make up for that, which they 
then use to pay for the planes for the 
navy and for the infantry, right now, 
working to destroy the democracy of 
Ukraine. 
So the answer is for the United 
States to chart a new course. In 2021, 
2020, 2019, and 2018, we exported more 
natural gas than we imported. We don’t 
have a fossil fuel supply problem in the 
United States at all. We are supplying 
fossil fuels all around the world right 
now. We are sending our fuel to Japan, 
to China, to South Korea. Fossil fuel 
companies are sending their products 
anywhere they can get the highest 
price—raising costs for all of us at 
home. 
By the way, again, understand that 
that is the key. Once they get it out of 
the United States and put it on a ship— 
natural gas or oil—they then get the 
highest price in the world for it, but 
they leave behind less oil and natural 
gas in the United States. With that di-
minished supply, that leads to an in-
crease in prices for consumers for home 
heating oil, for gasoline, and for the 
natural gas to heat their homes. That 
has been their plan since 2015, to lift 
the ban on the exportation of American 
oil and natural gas. 
Still, they are unfinished, and they 
want to be able to drill and frack every 
single inch of our national forests, our 
public lands, our coastlines. They want 
to add to their stockpiles of leases that 
they are squatting on already. Here are 
the numbers. It is absolutely astound-
ing. Again, it is all part of the Amer-
ican Petroleum Institute’s control of 
our domestic and foreign policy. 
Right now, onshore, in our forests 
and fields and plains, 53 percent of all 
of the leases that the American Petro-
leum Institute—Exxon, Chevron, you 
name it—already has one. By the way, 
it is 2 bucks an acre—2 bucks an acre. 
They are not drilling on them, and 
they have had their leases for 5 years, 
for 10 years, for 15 years, for 20 years. 
Then we hear from the American Pe-
troleum Institute that we need more 
land that you will lease to us on public 
lands that we can buy for a couple of 
bucks, and we promise—we promise— 
we will start drilling on it, but just 
give us more land—even though they 
already have an area the size of Indi-
ana that they have bid for and now, 
from the American people, on public 
lands, have the right to drill. But they 
are not doing it. 
Offshore is even worse. On our pris-
tine coasts from Maine to Florida, 77 
percent of the existing leases which the 
American 
Petroleum 
Institute 
has, 
they haven’t even drilled on them yet. 
They are sitting there. Yet they are 
coming here and saying: We need even 
more that we can get at this bargain 
basement price of a couple of bucks an 
acre. 
That is their business plan, and it is 
just so disingenuous for the American 
Petroleum Institute to just continue to 
try to exploit crises while they, them-
selves, are not doing their own job, be-
cause it is inconsistent with the huge 
profit-making goals which they have. 
Using the crisis in Ukraine and rising 
oil prices to push for more pro-oil poli-
cies doesn’t make sense. Our oil addic-
tion is what added more than $17 bil-
lion to Putin’s pockets last year. Let 
me just say that again. We in the 
United States, at the gas pump, sent 
$17 billion to Putin for his war machine 
just in 2021. 
So let’s just not pretend that we need 
to plunder every inch of our country in 
order to protect our allies or to lower 
gas prices. Oil and gas companies want 
to frack and extract so they can con-
tinue to send American fuel abroad 
while they plead energy independence 
and send that to China as the highest 
bidder. 
That is not our plan. It can’t be our 
plan. We have to have a true, clean en-
ergy independence that helps rid the 
world of Putin’s business model and 
leads the way to an American-led, 
international clean energy revolution. 
The Republicans right now are block-
ing the clean energy package that we 
have in the U.S. Senate.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S980 
March 3, 2022 
For every 16 million all-electric vehi-
cles we deploy, we back out the equiva-
lent of all the oil we import from Rus-
sia. With the next 16 million, we back 
out all of the oil we import from Saudi 
Arabia. That is the plan for young peo-
ple in our country and for young people 
around the world. If we do that in co-
ordination with our allies, that de-
stroys, in the long term, the business 
model of Russia and of the Middle 
Eastern nations that have us addicted 
to their oil. 
I just think that we are at a critical 
time, and we need big plans; but one of 
them cannot be that we are saying to 
the oil industry that you can exploit 
this crisis, because if they are serious— 
and I will just finish on this note. 
When we debated in January of 2015 
the Keystone Pipeline, I made the 
amendment here on the Senate floor, 
saying, if we build this Keystone Pipe-
line, that we have to keep all of the oil 
here in the United States—it is the 
dirtiest oil in the world, the tar sands 
of Canada. In a straw that they wanted 
to build right through the United 
States, with all the environmental 
risks taken by the American people, 
they would then export it. So my 
amendment said, if we build this pipe-
line and take all of the environmental 
risks, that the oil should stay here. 
Every single Republican voted not to 
keep it here. They all said that that oil 
can be exported to any country in the 
world. 
Secondly, back when I was in the 
House of Representatives, I would 
make the amendment each year. If you 
want to drill off the coastlines of the 
United States, then any oil which is 
found has to stay here in America; oth-
erwise, the beaches and the fishing in-
dustries of the United States take all 
the risks, and the oil companies reap 
all of the profits by putting that oil 
and natural gas on the international 
markets. 
Every Republican voted no. We are 
not going to have a ban on the expor-
tation of that oil and gas even though 
it endangers the drilling and would en-
danger the beaches and the fishing in-
dustries of the United States. 
So it has always been about an ex-
port strategy, and that is all this is as 
well. It is an attempt to get more 
leases that they would then hoard— 
squat on—wait for the price to go high-
er, and then in their own good time, 
they would begin to drill, but it would 
only be in their interests, not our na-
tional interests. 
As a result, because of the long, un-
fortunate history of the relationship 
between the American people and the 
American Petroleum Institute, I ob-
ject. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana. 
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, clearly, 
we have two different philosophies and 
strategies moving forward as we deal 
with the crisis that is unfolding in Eu-
rope and Ukraine. 
We need more ‘‘made in America’’ en-
ergy. It is the Green New Deal, purely 
clean energy and not including an ‘‘all 
of the above’’ energy portfolio that I 
believe is a very dangerous direction to 
head, as we have seen exactly what 
Germany has encountered over the 
course of the last 10 years. 
They marched down that path, and 
now, they find themselves in a very, 
very dangerous position. And they have 
had to reverse the course because they 
had the same kind of ideals that the 
Senator from Massachusetts was talk-
ing about. Now, they have had to wake 
up and look at the reality of the situa-
tion and change course. 
By the way, it is not every inch. This 
bill simply says we need four lease 
sales. We are asking for a minimum of 
four lease sales. That is what we are 
asking for. 
And when the President shuts down 
the Keystone Pipeline, shuts down oil 
and gas leasing in this country, com-
bined with what we see going on with 
FERC being major impediments to 
building more pipelines, combined with 
nominees and those who have been ap-
pointed in the Biden administration 
and who are very anti-oil and gas, it 
chills the capital markets. This is a 
long-term direction we have got to con-
tinue to go down. 
Again, this bill also includes wind, 
solar, and geothermal priorities as part 
of it. So it is all of the above. 
I just think it is very dangerous to 
say we are going to bet the Nation’s fu-
ture on only one segment of the energy 
economy and not also ensure we have 
oil and gas and coal as part of our 
broader portfolio. 
Just ask the Germans if they thought 
that was a good idea when they went 
down this path 10 to 15 years ago. 
Thank you. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Massachusetts. 
Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, just in 
response to the Senator, we have never 
had an ‘‘all of the above’’ strategy, 
truly. We have had an ‘‘oil above all’’ 
strategy. That is the problem that we 
have. That is the hole that we have dug 
for ourselves. 
It is time for the United States to fi-
nally put a plan in place that backs out 
the imported oil from Russia, backs 
out the imported oil from the Middle 
East, and the only way we can do it is 
if we pass the climate provisions in 
President Biden’s plan. 
By 2030, the goal is to have 40 percent 
of all of our vehicles being all elec-
tric—no oil, no gasoline. Do you know 
what that does? It destroys the busi-
ness model of Russia. It destroys the 
business model of the countries in the 
Middle East that need that petrol dol-
lar from the American consumer in 
order to fund all of their nefarious ac-
tivities. 
Germany is going 65 percent all-elec-
tric vehicles by the year 2030—9 years 
from now, 65 percent all electric. 
So if we put this together and we are 
serious about it right now, we will de-
stroy the long-term threat fueled by 
our own addiction to energy, Europe’s 
addiction to fossil fuels, and it will just 
send us on a clean energy future. 
But in order to do it, we need a true 
‘‘all of the above’’ strategy, not ‘‘oil 
above all.’’ That is how we got here. 
And if we are going to do it, we have to 
pass that comprehensive clean energy 
package out of the Senate this year 
and put it on President Biden’s desk. 
That will scare Putin and his cronies 
vacationing in Sochi. That will put a 
fear into the hearts of the oil monarchs 
of the Middle East because they will 
know once and for all that we are seri-
ous about not allowing our American 
consumer 
dollars 
to 
fuel 
conflicts 
around the world. 
Again, I appreciate the time. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the following 
Senators be permitted to speak prior to 
the scheduled vote: Senator LANKFORD, 
myself, up to 5 minutes; Senator MAR-
SHALL for 2 minutes; Senator SCHUMER, 
up to 5 minutes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
S.J. RES. 38 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, we 
are about to vote on an issue dealing 
with the national emergency here in 
the United States dealing with the pan-
demic. 
There has been no great shock that 
we have functioned under a lot of addi-
tional authorities that are happening, 
but I want to provide a bit of clarity 
into this conversation as well. 
The measure that we are dealing 
with right now dealing with COVID and 
the pandemic that is here, we also 
know there is a global pandemic; and 
improving the medical situation here 
doesn’t necessarily mean improving 
the medical situation everywhere, nor 
should it change what is called title 42. 
A quick explanation on this. The 
Surgeon General, the CDC, and HHS all 
work together with the President to be 
able to recommend that, based on the 
public health crisis that we are cur-
rently under, title 42 states this: 
Whenever the Surgeon General determines 
that by reason of the existence of any com-
municable disease in a foreign country there 
is a serious danger of the introduction of 
such disease in the United States, and that 
this danger is so increased by the introduc-
tion of persons or property from such coun-
try that a suspension of the right to intro-
duce such persons and property is required in 
the interest of the public health, the Sur-
geon General, in accordance with the regula-
tions approved by the President, shall have 
the power to prohibit . . . the introduction

S981 
March 3, 2022 
of persons and property from such countries 
or places [they] shall designate. 
That is title 42. 
Why that does matter to us? Because 
in the last 2 years, our country along 
our border has been managing much of 
the border based on title 42. Now, it is 
no secret to anyone in this room—I 
would assume everyone in this room 
knows—we had the highest number of 
border encounters—that is people ille-
gally crossing our borders—last year in 
the history of our country. Over 2 mil-
lion people illegally crossed our bor-
ders. What some may not know is, last 
year, 900,000 of those were brought into 
the system in the United States; 1.1 
million of those were turned around at 
the border with title 42 authority; 
meaning, because of the pandemic, be-
cause of the risk and the crisis, the in-
troduction of additional individuals 
who are likely to have COVID, they 
were turned around at the border. 
The concern is—and I have raised 
this concern over and over with CBP— 
what is your plan postpandemic for the 
title 42 authority? 
Now, I want everyone to think about 
last summer—last summer what was 
happening in Donna, TX, last summer 
what was happening in multiple places 
along the border where our facilities 
were overrun with people and not man-
ageable. That was when we were intro-
ducing 900,000 people into the country. 
What does that look like this summer 
if there are 2 million people in that 
group coming across? 
That is why I want to make it very 
clear that what we are voting on now 
has no effect on title 42 authority. We 
continue to have serious health con-
cerns, as title 42 states, in many other 
countries; and I have continued to en-
courage DHS to have a plan in place. 
Currently, they do not. It appears that 
their plan is, once title 42 goes away, 
all 2 million will get into the country. 
I think that is a serious problem, and I 
think it is something we should ad-
dress. 
In the meantime, we should not re-
lieve title 42, and this vote does not 
change anything with the Surgeon 
General’s decision on title 42. By the 
way, it is a Surgeon General position 
that has been in two administrations 
in a row to be able to be maintained on 
this. 
So just to clarify, for this body, this 
vote has nothing to do with title 42; 
that is a Surgeon General responsi-
bility; but this body needs to do addi-
tional oversight to make sure DHS is 
paying attention to what is happening 
at our southern border because we 
could very well have 1.1 million addi-
tional people illegally cross into the 
country, not just across the border and 
be returned but actually into the coun-
try in the days ahead. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, one 
of my favorite tasks up here is to give 
folks from back home a tour of this 
Capitol. We meet them in the Crypt, 
and we go through the Old Supreme 
Court, and we walk up the back steps 
into the Capitol’s Rotunda. And I love 
to say nothing. I love to just watch the 
folks look up at the walls and gaze at 
all the famous statues—statues of Ei-
senhower and Reagan. 
There are portraits in that Rotunda, 
each with a story to tell. Perhaps my 
favorite portrait is one by John Trum-
bull; it is a painting of General George 
Washington, depicting in 1783 his re-
signing his commission as Commander 
of the Continental Army. Everyone 
looks at that painting, and they see in 
the President—at that time General— 
George Washington’s hands his com-
mission, that piece of paper that he is 
handing off to the Continental Army. 
Behind him, there is a throne; and 
importantly, it is an empty throne 
with King’s robes on it, seemingly to 
say that George Washington said: I will 
not be a King; I will throw my robes 
off, and we will have a Republic, a de-
mocracy. 
I would ask our President to throw 
off his robes. I would ask him to listen 
to the people and end this declaration 
of emergency. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I will be brief as I 
conclude. 
Mr. President, as our country turns 
the corner on the COVID–19 pandemic, 
we stand at a crossroads. We can either 
take steps to keep America ready in 
case new variants arise—and the odds 
are high they will arise—or we can 
backslide and undo everything we have 
done, at great cost, to get our country 
closer to normal. 
Today, the Senator from Kansas is 
advancing a proposal that would pre-
cisely handicap the Biden administra-
tion’s ability to fight the pandemic and 
heighten the danger that all our 
progress is suddenly unraveled in the 
future. We have learned how to fight 
the pandemic; we are better at it; this 
undoes it for some kind of ideological 
reason. 
This proposal to hinder our COVID 
preparedness is as damaging and risky 
as it is unnecessary, and it should be 
voted down. It is going nowhere if it 
passes. 
The national emergency declaration, 
which this proposal would immediately 
terminate, has been one of the most 
powerful and best tools for mobilizing 
the Federal Government to combat the 
pandemic. It has made it easier to ac-
quire medical supplies, to provide re-
sources for healthcare works, and has 
helped cut redtape under the Defense 
Production Act. It has also offered stu-
dent loan borrowers critical relief by 
clearing the path for suspending stu-
dent loan payments—a lifeline for tens 
of millions. Do we want that undone? 
Just as it looks like we are turning 
the corner, why on Earth would Repub-
licans risk bungling it all by crippling 
America’s ability to remain prepared 
for the future? The best way to ensure 
that we keep schools open and cases 
low is by staying at the ready, and that 
is what these emergency powers enable 
us to do. We don’t know if new variants 
will come or not, but if they do, they 
can appear with frightening speed, and 
we need to be prepared. 
By prematurely terminating the na-
tional 
emergency 
declaration 
on 
COVID, it will be harder to ensure we 
have enough supplies, enough support 
for 
healthcare 
workers, 
and 
risks 
throwing tens of millions of student 
loan borrowers into needless uncer-
tainty and anxiety. It is a wrong move. 
I will vote against it today. 
And I ask for the yeas and nays.

S.J. RES. 38 
Resolved by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, That, pursuant to section 
202 of the National Emergencies Act (50 
U.S.C. 1622), the national emergency declared 
by the finding of the President on March 13, 
2020, in Proclamation 9994 (85 Fed. Reg. 15337) 
is hereby terminated. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
ENERGY 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, in 
Ukrainian 
President 
Volodymyr 
Zelenskyy’s speech to the European 
Parliament this week, he made it clear 
that the time for long-winded negotia-
tions is over. He said that in Ukraine, 
‘‘We’re dealing with reality . . . we’re 
dealing with real life.’’ 
The footage coming out of Ukraine is 
absolutely 
horrifying. 
Putin 
has 
shocked the world with the level of 
brutality he is inflicting on civilians— 
men, women and precious children. But 
remember that none of this happened 
overnight. These last 3 months of blus-
ter and buildup from Moscow were 
more than just idle threats. We saw it 
coming. And still, it is abundantly 
clear that Joe Biden and his advisers 
have not accepted this reality. 
I have come to the floor more times 
than I can count to remind my col-
leagues how dangerous it is to remain 
entangled with governments controlled 
by dictators and mad men. 
I am encouraged by the growing level 
of bipartisan awareness of this danger 
but discouraged by how long it has 
taken us to get there. It took the bet-
ter part of 2 years for this body to rally 
around supply chain security. 
I am sorry to say my Democratic col-
leagues’ priorities were out of order 
during the height of the pandemic, 
even when it came to something as 
simple as holding Beijing accountable 
for unleashing COVID and destroying 
the global economy. 
Too many people had fooled them-
selves into believing that diplomacy 
with China required dependence on 
China. And just like that, we found 
ourselves at the mercy of Xi Jinping. 
It has taken all-out war in Ukraine 
for many of my colleagues to learn the 
same hard lesson about Vladimir Putin 
and our entanglement with Russia’s 
state-controlled energy sector. 
It is the same old story. What started 
out as interdependence has turned into 
a serious vulnerability. It is especially 
true for our European counterparts 
who bet everything on their gamble 
with Moscow and played right into 
Putin’s hands. 
Now, here we are. Russia is the 
world’s largest gas depot; Europe is on 
the brink of an energy crisis; and the 
world is dipping into strategic petro-
leum reserves to avert chaos. Yes, we 
are all in this mess together, but we 
ought not to be. It did not have to be 
this way. 
It is hard to believe that before Joe 
Biden took his oath of office, the 
United States of America was energy 
independent. That is correct. Go back 
and look at the numbers, 2019, 2020—en-
ergy independent. It took a lot of hard 
work, but, yes, we got there. 
President Trump opened up all Fed-
eral lands for new oil and gas explo-
ration. He also approved the Keystone 
XL Pipeline, which created thousands 
of jobs and would have brought energy 
production closer to home. 
Trump also used sanctions against 
Russian energy companies when he 
needed to. He used them against 
Gazprom and the Nord Stream 2 Pipe-
line, and also against Rosneft for help-
ing Venezuela evade oil sanctions. It 
worked. The proof was right there in 
front of us. You could see it. 
Then, along comes President Biden, 
and what did he choose to do? He had a 
choice. He made a decision. Yes, it was 
intentional. It was to satisfy the left-
ists who are running the Democratic 
Party. 
So what did Joe Biden do? He crushed 
American energy. That is right. He sus-
pended all of those oil and gas leases on 
Federal land. On the very first day of 
his administration, he took great pride 
in saying one of his first actions, one of 
the very first things that he did, was to 
kill the Keystone Pipeline, and then he 
blocked new energy infrastructure. 
And then, for good measure, he made 
those pesky Nord Stream 2 sanctions 
go away. 
What had Vladimir Putin asked for? 
He wanted Nord Stream 2, no sanc-
tions. Joe Biden gave it to him. He did 
not even put any conditions on it. 
None. Zip. Old buddy, old pal, this is 
what you wanted? I am going to give it 
to you. I will give you Nord Stream 2— 
at the same time locking down U.S. en-
ergy production. 
For the Members of this Chamber 
who 
come 
from 
energy-producing 
States, if you are supporting President 
Biden in this endeavor, then you are 
supporting actions that disadvantage 
your State. Think about that—jobs, 
Keystone, having energy independence, 
which, as we are seeing, this has quite 
an impact on our Nation’s security and 
on our global security. 
Well, for all of those actions that 
stopped energy production, the Demo-
cratic Party loved him for it, of course. 
As I said, they are being run by the far- 
left wing. The environmental lobby? 
Oh, they loved and praised Joe Biden 
for this, and at first the Europeans 
kind of liked it also. 
But then look where it got us. We fell 
out of energy independence and into a 
rat’s nest of entanglements with one of 
the world’s most belligerent dictators. 
Russia is now our third largest sup-
plier of crude oil. The EU gets around 
40 percent of its gas imports and more 
than a quarter of its oil from Russia. 
Instead of using Keystone to send 
830,000 barrels of crude oil per day to 
refiners in Nebraska and Texas, we de-
pend on Russia to give us over 600,000 
barrels per day. 
Our German friends have finally 
questioned the wisdom of their failed 
energy scheme with Moscow, but they 
are still vulnerable. Everyone is vul-
nerable. 
Putin is using energy as a weapon. 
This is not up for debate. 
There was an interesting article in 
Tuesday’s Wall Street Journal, reveal-
ing that Russia is still exporting its oil 
and natural gas throughout the world. 
Gazprom and Rosneft pull in around 30 
percent of Russia’s budget revenues. 
That is right—two companies. As I 
said, Russia, is a big oil depot, and 
they have an army. Thirty percent of 
the country’s oil revenues are from 
Gazprom and Rosneft. And as of right 
now, they have been able to completely 
avoid major Western sanctions. Shame-
ful. 
They have managed to do this even 
though we know this gives Moscow 
some level of control over the rest of 
the global economy. These companies 
are Putin’s economic lifeline and his 
best leverage against the West, his best 
leverage against Ukraine. 
I am quoting from the Wall Street 
Journal article: 
In recent months, Mr. Putin deployed 
Gazprom, the largest exporter of natural gas 
to the European market, as a geopolitical 
tool by throttling deliveries to the con-
tinent, European officials and analysts have 
said. That exacerbated an already-growing 
gas deficit and led to a surge in prices. 
Both companies have always denied having 
a political agenda and insisted they are pur-
suing legitimate business interests, but in 
recent years European officials and foreign- 
policy experts have said Gazprom in par-
ticular has been acting as a foreign-policy 
instrument for the Russian government. 
The article goes on to detail how 
Putin is financing his war against 
Ukraine with the help of these puppet 
corporations. Energy is his most pow-
erful economic weapon, and the only 
way to neutralize it is to cut off the 
revenue stream. 
Sanctions related to the SWIFT 
banking system and other financial 
punishments are important, but they 
are not going to be a silver bullet. 
The Biden administration has repeat-
edly said that sanctions against the 
Russian energy sector would be too 
radical, but I would suggest that per-
haps the Biden administration is not 
the best judge of what is too radical 
when it comes to regaining energy 
independence. 
I would remind my Democratic col-
leagues that it was the Biden adminis-
tration that decided that oil and gas 
leases on Federal lands were too rad-
ical; that the Keystone Pipeline was 
too radical; and that sanctions on 
Putin’s pipeline to Western Europe, 
that was too radical.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S983 
March 3, 2022 
Joe Biden didn’t let energy independ-
ence slip away. He was and is the archi-
tect of its destruction. 
When you go fill up your car, every 
time, $20, $25 more, Joe Biden did that. 
When you look at logistics costs and 
delivery fees that are coming to you 
because of the price of gas, you can 
thank Joe Biden that you are paying 
these higher delivery fees. When you 
look at the cost of packaging and prod-
ucts and it is costing you more, be-
cause energy affects inflation, this is 
what Joe Biden has done in 1 year—in 
1 year. 
We were energy independent. We 
were a net exporter of oil and gas—an 
energy exporter. And now look at 
where we are. 
In this week’s State of the Union Ad-
dress, the President made no indication 
he intends to clean up the mess he has 
made. Why is that? It was intentional. 
This is what they intended to do to 
you, the American citizen. This is what 
they have done: Keystone, new pipeline 
infrastructure, returning us to having 
to ask OPEC—who, by the way, the 
OPEC nations, they are the third larg-
est holder of U.S. debt. 
You know, colleagues, this makes no 
sense. When you could be exporting en-
ergy, but you are importing it from 
people who do not wish us well, from 
Russia—from 
Russia—who 
is 
using 
those proceeds to carry out this war in 
Ukraine, this makes no sense. It is why 
the President does not intend to clean 
up this mess. 
No, the climate-obsessed Biden ad-
ministration is going to drag the coun-
try into a future defined by many of 
the same unsustainable green energy 
policies that threw Europe into chaos. 
They would rather buy Russian oil and 
fund a war in Ukraine than produce oil 
here in the USA. 
This is a policy that defies logic. 
The time for passing the buck is at 
an end. Sanctions on the Russian en-
ergy sector aren’t radical; they are a 
means of survival, and we need to use 
them now. 
This week, we saw some truly stun-
ning demonstrations of solidarity with 
Ukraine. And on behalf of our common 
cause for freedom and liberty, the free 
world has said no to Putin’s war. But if 
we don’t back up those declarations, 
we are inviting more chaos. 
This week, Ukraine’s Ambassador to 
the U.N. reminded us of the cost of this 
willful blindness—and, yes, it is willful 
blindness. He said: 
If we fail to respond now we will face much 
more than criticism. We will face oblivion. 
It must not happen. Now it is time to 
act, time to help Ukraine, which is now 
paying the ultimate price for the free-
dom and security of itself and of the 
world. 
Joe Biden won’t be able to soft-talk 
his way out of this impending disaster 
that is unfolding right before our eyes. 
I would implore all of my colleagues, 
each and every one who claims to be 
inspired by President Zelenskyy and 
the Ukrainian freedom fighters, to fol-
low their example. Do your duty and 
put yourselves between the American 
people and the evil that Putin will 
surely inflict on us if we don’t use 
every option available at our disposal 
to stop him. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arkansas. 
STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS 
Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, 
while we gathered in the House Cham-
ber for the State of the Union Address, 
the whole world was watching for 
President Biden’s comments on Putin’s 
rapidly escalating invasion of Ukraine. 
I thought the President did a good job 
expressing our steadfast support to 
Ukraine. That strong message was con-
veyed to the international community 
during his address, and the apprecia-
tion from both sides of the aisle was re-
flected in our collective response. It 
was a moment when we felt complete 
unity in the Chamber. 
Unfortunately, it was the only mo-
ment of unity in the entire address. 
The overwhelming majority of the 
President’s speech was geared toward a 
specific audience—his liberal base. 
Over the course of an hour, the Presi-
dent boasted about spending billions on 
unnecessary wish list items, pushed his 
‘‘climate first’’ agenda, and laid out his 
Big Government social justice plat-
form. 
It was a message tailored for resi-
dents of the Hamptons rather than 
those who live in Hampton, AR. The 
voters in Austin, TX, but not Austin, 
AR. 
Arkansans are worried about paying 
their bills, putting food on the table, 
and the price of gasoline. The cost of 
almost everything is on the rise, and 
every American is feeling the pinch. 
And we are not talking about luxury 
items here; we are talking about neces-
sities. A gallon of gas costs almost a 
dollar more than last year. Electricity 
bills are skyrocketing, and food infla-
tion is at its highest rate since the Car-
ter administration. 
The main thing my constituents and, 
quite frankly, most Americans outside 
of the beltway needed to hear was a 
plan to bring down inflation, end the 
supply chain bottlenecks, and restore 
our workforce to full strength. Presi-
dent Biden barely touched on these 
issues. When he did, it was to cast 
blame for inflation on businesses and 
industries that are doing their very 
best to maintain operations in the face 
of historic supply chain and labor chal-
lenges. 
The President claimed that busi-
nesses should simply lower costs to re-
duce inflation, as if lowering costs in 
the face of increasing government 
mandates, increasing input costs, labor 
shortages, and overregulation was pos-
sible. There is a major disconnect be-
tween the struggles Americans experi-
ence every day and the image the 
President and his team are desperately 
trying to project. 
This is most apparent in rural Amer-
ica. The President and his team often 
boast about record high farm income 
but never acknowledge the fact that 
the financial gains family farmers, 
ranchers, and foresters will see will 
soon be reduced by record high produc-
tion costs. Land, machinery, labor, 
fuel, seed, and livestock feed prices are 
all increasing dramatically. Fertilizer 
prices have spiked as much as 300 per-
cent in some parts of the country, and 
at the same time the administration is 
levying tariffs on our fertilizer im-
ports. Every portion of the food chain 
remains strained as labor shortages 
and supply chain issues continue to 
hinder our ability to get food from 
farms to tables. 
For many, the increased costs of 
farming are deterring them from con-
tinuing in the industry. It is pushing 
the next generation of farmers down a 
different career path instead of car-
rying on the family business. The fam-
ily farm operations that once popu-
lated my home State of Arkansas in 
large numbers will be eroded away if 
we don’t make rural America and farm-
ing more economically stable. 
This is bad news for rural America. 
In most of our rural communities, agri-
culture is all that is left. Agriculture is 
Arkansas’ 
largest 
industry, 
adding 
around $21 billion to our economy 
every year and accounting for approxi-
mately one in six jobs. 
But rural Arkansas is hurting. My 
home State has 75 counties, and 55 of 
them lost population in the last cen-
sus. I suspect the same trend is likely 
happening in each of our colleagues’ 
States. The exodus is fueled by the de-
sire to leave rural America to pursue 
economic 
opportunities 
outside 
of 
farming. And that is so unfortunate, as 
the family farms that color the land-
scape of rural America are the true 
building block for a better future. 
Reversing this trend should be at the 
top of our to-do list. Our agenda needs 
to benefit more than urban and subur-
ban America. It needs to reach and 
help the 60 million Americans living in 
our rural communities. When people 
leave our small rural towns, we run the 
risk of losing schools, hospitals, and 
other vital infrastructure needed to 
sustain these communities. We must 
find solutions to rebuild economies and 
secure livelihoods in rural America. 
President Biden only mentioned the 
word ‘‘rural’’ once in his entire State 
of the Union Address. He continued to 
push his Build Back Better agenda, 
which favors big city liberals at the ex-
pense of rural America and pledged to 
resurrect this doomed package. 
My advice to President Biden: It is 
time to stop pushing that boulder up 
the hill. Instead, make good on your 
pledge to unite the fractured country. 
That starts by abandoning these mis-
placed priorities and focusing on the 
needs of all Americans. 
With that, I yield the floor.

ator from South Carolina.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S984 
March 3, 2022 
Biden’s State of the Union speech ad-
dressed an issue I have long worked on. 
It is the issue of police reform. After 
years—and I do mean years—of Demo-
crats’ touting unpopular ‘‘defund the 
police’’ policies, they have finally seen 
the light—maybe it is the light on 
their sinking polling numbers—and are 
now voicing support for funding our 
men and women in uniform. 
Crime is one of the top issues people 
across this country are facing. Homi-
cides are up 44 percent in major cities 
since 2019, and minority communities 
that have been impacted the most are 
crying out for help. 
Eighty-five percent—85 percent—is 
the number of the increase from 2019 to 
2020 in the murders and the violent 
crimes in Black and Hispanic commu-
nities. In addition, last year was one of 
the most dangerous, deadliest years for 
law enforcement on record, with the 
most officers being shot in the line of 
duty since they began tracking the 
numbers. That is nearly a 70-percent 
increase in officers being shot while 
simply trying to do their duty, take 
care of the community, and return to 
their families. 
So this is not an issue between law 
enforcement or the minority commu-
nity; this is an issue of both. Today, 80 
percent of African Americans all over 
the country want the same level of po-
licing or higher levels of policing. They 
want their neighborhoods safe because 
they understand more than anyone 
else—with the 85-percent increase, they 
understand the importance of the pres-
ence of character-driven law enforce-
ment officers patrolling our commu-
nities. 
The numbers simply do not lie. 
That is why we must increase fund-
ing for police departments so they can 
have the training and the equipment, 
the resources necessary to do their 
jobs, keeping themselves safe and the 
neighborhoods that they patrol safe at 
the exact same time. 
In his speech this week, President 
Biden named things I have been work-
ing on and supporting for years along 
with my Republican colleagues. We 
have literally been supporting the 
issues he raised for the last 2 or 3 
years. 
My legislation, the JUSTICE Act, 
was filibustered on this very floor by 
Senate Democrats in 2020. It contained 
hundreds of millions of dollars for the 
very things President Biden, under du-
ress and in an election year for so 
many Democrats, is now advocating 
for. 
In my bill, as an example, we funded 
training; we funded storage; and we 
funded the purchase of more body-worn 
cameras for our officers because the 
polling and the stats are undeniable. 
When violent crime against our officers 
goes down, violent crime against the 
community goes down. 
We funded training on alternatives 
for the use of force. We funded deesca-
lation 
training. 
We 
addressed 
the 
issues of behavioral health. We funded 
efforts to ensure law enforcement offi-
cers come from diverse backgrounds 
that reflect the communities that they 
serve, but Democrats refused to sup-
port those efforts. 
Fast-forward to 2021. The legislation 
that I was negotiating over the last 
year would ban choke holds, with the 
only exception being the life of the of-
ficer. We took a strong stance on no- 
knock warrants. We worked to provide 
support for officers who were experi-
encing PTSD, and we supported pro-
viding co-responders to scenes where 
there was a mental health episode hap-
pening. 
The truth is, we were almost there— 
getting a bill done—when my negoti-
ating partners left the table. 
In this election year, I am glad to 
hear that President Biden and Demo-
crats are now, suddenly, talking posi-
tively about an issue that every com-
munity around the country has been 
talking about for the last 2 years. 
I want more than talk. I want to see 
action. I am still at the table. I am 
still waiting for anyone, from any-
where, at any time, to show up at this 
table and take care of our police offi-
cers so they can continue to take care 
of our communities. I look forward to 
reintroducing legislation very quickly 
to refund the police after so many ef-
forts to defund the police have suc-
ceeded in cities across our great Na-
tion. 
I urge my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle to come back to the 
negotiating table, which I never left, so 
that we can ensure the proper level of 
funding for our officers, who provide 
great levels of safety for our commu-
nities. 
Also, for the last 3 years, I have 
worked really hard with my friends 
across the aisle on lynching legisla-
tion—lynching 
legislation 
that 
has 
failed in this body 200 times—and we 
passed it. We passed it twice under Re-
publican leadership, in this Senate, 
only for it to fall apart in the House. 
Well, the House has taken up that leg-
islation, and they have renamed it. 
That is a good thing if they will pass 
it. If it takes a new name and minor 
tweaks to get this legislation signed 
into law—legislation that has failed 200 
times—I welcome a new name; I wel-
come some technical changes. I think 
we are almost there on this, too. 
This is the year, and now is the time 
that we do the right thing, not for Re-
publicans or Democrats but for Ameri-
cans, who have watched with bewil-
dered eyes and confused hearts the gov-
ernment fall short on issues of impor-
tance to them again and again and 
again. Let this year be the year we put 
politics to the side, and we get it done. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I 
want to start by commending my col-
league from South Carolina. He just 
spoke about his police modernization 
efforts over the years and of his pas-
sionate commitment to this issue, 
which comes from his heart. 
I hope that the other side is hearing 
that because I think there is an oppor-
tunity now to come together, particu-
larly in light of the speech the other 
night by the President, to say, let’s do 
two things. One, let’s help these com-
munities to be able to be safer and help 
the people who live there, but, also, 
let’s increase the amount of respect 
and gratitude for our police officers. 
Those two are not inconsistent. In fact, 
they are complementary. That is why I 
appreciate the work that he has done 
and will do. 
UKRAINE 
Madam 
President, 
tonight, 
in 
Ukraine, the bombs are already raining 
down on the cities of Kharkiv, of Kyiv, 
and other towns and cities throughout 
Ukraine. Indiscriminate bombings—ar-
tillery, missiles—are killing innocent 
civilians. Already, thousands of civil-
ians have been killed. 
This was a totally unwarranted, un-
justified, atrocious invasion of a free 
country, of an independent sovereign 
country. Here on the floor of the Sen-
ate we have an opportunity to do some-
thing about it, which is to act on legis-
lation called the supplemental appro-
priations bill, which provides more 
funding and help for two things: one, 
the military response. 
We need to do everything we can—we 
need to flood the zone—to help the 
Ukrainians be able to defend them-
selves. They want more help, and they 
need more help, and I think the Amer-
ican taxpayer, from what we have al-
ready done, should be proud of that, 
but we need to do more and do it quick-
ly. We can’t wait for the redtape and 
the bureaucracy to finish up before we 
send small arms, before we send more 
Stingers to be able to shoot down air-
planes, or more Javelins to stop these 
tanks that are coming into Kyiv. You 
saw that long column. 
We should do more. We should pro-
vide more funding for the kind of air-
planes that we don’t have but that 
other countries do that they might be 
willing to provide, we are told, if we 
provide compensation to them—MiG 
fighters that they can use—because 
airpower is so important. 
We should provide more in terms of 
the drones that countries like Turkey 
can provide, and we can help finance, 
to be able to give them the ability to 
do things like stop that murderous col-
umn that is on its way to kill civilians 
in Kyiv tonight. 
So my hope is that, on both sides of 
the aisle, we put aside whatever dif-
ferences we have and focus on this im-
mediately. The funding is needed to be 
able to ensure that we have a sustained 
effort here—because this is not going 
to be a matter of hours or days; it is 
going to be a matter of weeks and 
months—and we need to do everything 
we can do to help the freedom-loving 
people of Ukraine defend their liberty, 
their 
freedom, 
their 
independence, 
their sovereignty.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S985 
March 3, 2022 
about Postal Service reform. This is 
about saving the post office. It is in big 
trouble. 
In my view, if we don’t put some re-
forms in place in the post office and do 
it quickly, we are going to have a situ-
ation where, in the next few years, the 
post office will become insolvent. What 
will we do then? A huge taxpayer bail-
out. 
We have an alternative, which is to 
put in place reforms now, both through 
congressional action—passing a law 
that I will talk about in a second—but 
also through internal reforms at the 
post office itself. With the current 
Postmaster 
General 
committed 
to 
those reforms, I am confident that 
those can move as well. The combina-
tion of those two things means saving 
the post office, and it is really impor-
tant. 
Think of the veterans you represent, 
if you are a Member here in the Senate, 
who get their medication prescriptions 
from the mail. I am sure you have 
heard from them, because I have. They 
don’t like it when their drugs are a day 
late, much less 2 or 3 days late or a 
week late, because of the post office’s 
not being able to perform. 
How about the people who get their 
Social Security checks in the mail? I 
have heard from them, too, and I am 
sure the Presiding Officer has. They 
want a strong post office. They know 
that that universal service obligation— 
meaning the post office—goes to every 
mailbox. It is critical to them and 
their ability to get those lifesaving So-
cial Security checks. 
What about the voters who vote ab-
sentee? In Ohio, we have no-fault ab-
sentee. It works very well. It is a sys-
tem that is fair, and it is a system that 
is secure, but it is a system that relies 
on the post office’s doing its job— 
right?—to be sure those ballots are de-
livered properly both to the voter but 
also back to the boards of elections. 
So the post office is critical. Again, 
no one else is going to pick up this 
function. That last mile is not going to 
be done by somebody else. The post of-
fice is absolutely critical to save be-
cause it is absolutely critical to the 
American people. 
So what does our legislation do? Ba-
sically, it just does a few things. 
First, it eliminates a burdensome 
prefunding 
requirement 
for 
retiree 
health benefits that the post office has 
to make that nobody else does. 
Congress mandated this back in 2006. 
I am not quite sure why. They man-
dated it for all current employees re-
gardless of age. This has crippled the 
post office financially. No other Fed-
eral Agency or Department does that, 
by the way. The Federal Government 
does not require the prefunding of re-
tiree health benefits nor does the pri-
vate sector, frankly. In the private sec-
tor, it is basically Medicare. So we 
take away that onerous burden, which, 
again, is crippling the post office finan-
cially. 
Second, we require the post office re-
tirees who are retiring and who have 
been paying into Medicare their entire 
careers to actually enroll in Medicare 
Part B and Part D. 
These are the hospital visits or pre-
scription drugs. That saves the post of-
fice money, but it also saves the tax-
payer a bunch of money because, right 
now, those employees—about 25 per-
cent of them, of the postal employees— 
do not go into Medicare; they stay in 
the Federal Employees Health Benefits 
Program, soon to be the Postal Health 
Benefit Plan, which is a more generous 
plan that will still be there to back it 
up. But these employees going into 
Medicare will help to save the post of-
fice. 
Third, we require the Postal Service 
to maintain its current standard of 6- 
day delivery. 
Now, this is very important because 
a lot of Members in this caucus, on my 
side—the 
Republicans—feel 
very 
strongly about this, but so do Members 
of the Democratic side, particularly if 
they represent rural areas. The 6-day 
delivery, as I said, is so important for 
things like the Social Security checks, 
the rent checks, paying your utility 
bills, ensuring that you have the abil-
ity to get your prescriptions through 
the mail. So that is in this legisla-
tion—but also doing it through an inte-
grated delivery network of mail and 
packages. Think about first-class mail 
and other mail and packages. To have 
those in this integrated service is far 
more efficient for the post office, obvi-
ously. That is what they are doing now. 
So this legislation simply says the sta-
tus quo should continue there. Other-
wise, it would be terribly inefficient for 
us to have a separate system for pack-
ages and a separate system for mail. 
The combination of all of these 
things, by the way, means that the 
Congressional Budget Office estimates 
that this legislation will save the tax-
payer $1.5 billion. So it doesn’t cost 
anything—this is not an appropria-
tion—but over 10 years, it does save 
$1.5 billion. 
In response to legitimate concerns 
that I have heard from the shipping 
and the banking communities, let me 
also note what this bill does not do. 
No. 1, it does not appropriate any 
new funds to the U.S. Postal Service— 
period. 
No. 2, it does not change the account-
ing or costing structure for packages 
and letters. So it does not disadvantage 
private sector carriers. That is very 
important. 
No. 3, it does not allow the Postal 
Service to enter into new commercial 
services like postal banking—period. 
Those are important things that have 
sometimes been misrepresented as I 
have heard people talking about this 
legislation. 
Finally and very importantly, de-
spite the claims of some of the oppo-
nents of this legislation, this bill does 
not impact the solvency of the Medi-
care Part A trust fund—period. For the 
people who keep saying that, you are 
wrong, and you know it because the 
CBO has now made that very clear. I 
have made it clear on the floor, and so 
have others. If that is the reason you 
are not supportive of this legislation, 
you ought to look twice at it because it 
does not affect the solvency. 
This bill also, as we have found out 
from the CBO, does not impact or in-
crease the Part B or the Part D pre-
miums. Again, some people have said 
that. It is just not true. We know this 
because one of my colleagues asked the 
CBO these questions in a letter. Some 
of us were already saying this because, 
as an example, with regard to Part A, 
people have been paying in their whole 
lives, but they are also already eligible 
for Part A. So they are not going to 
add to Part A. 
This colleague of mine wanted to be 
sure and get the answer from the CBO. 
So he asked the CBO this question: 
What is the effect of the legislation on the 
Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund? 
Here was the answer from the CBO: 
Most people aged 65 or older are entitled to 
benefits under Medicare Part A (Hospital In-
surance) if they have worked and paid Medi-
care taxes for an adequate number of quar-
ters; nearly all Medicare-eligible USPS— 
That is the Postal Service— 
annuitants are already covered. Because en-
titlement to Part A is related primarily to a 
person’s age and employment history, CBO 
estimates that the legislation’s Medicare re-
quirements would not increase the number of 
people receiving benefits under Part A; 
therefore, the agency estimates that H.R. 
3076 would not result in additional spending 
from the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. 
No impact. 
My colleague also asked the CBO: 
So what is the effect upon Medicare pre-
miums in Part B and Part D? 
The trust funds there, as you know, 
are funded by people paying premiums. 
But the question is, Are the premiums 
going to go up in Part B and Part D? 
The question really is, What is the ef-
fect on everybody? 
Here is CBO’s reply: 
Our preliminary analysis suggests that the 
legislation is unlikely to have an effect. 
CBO does not expect that Part D (Drug 
Coverage) premiums would change under 
H.R. 3076. Monthly premiums from Part B 
are set by the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services to finance one-quarter of 
the expected annual monthly Part B spend-
ing for all enrollees age 65 or over, rounded 
to the nearest multiple of 10 cents. To cause 
a change under H.R. 3076, the group of new 
enrollees would need to be large enough and 
their healthcare costs would need to be suffi-
ciently different from the current averages 
to affect [the] average. CBO projects that 
under current law, Part B enrollment will in-
crease from 64 million people in 2025—the 
year that 3076 would begin requiring certain 
UPS annuitants to enroll in Part B—to 73 
million [people by] 2031. CBO estimates that 
under the legislation enrollment in Part B 
would increase by between 13,000 and 40,000 
people over that period of time, or less than 
0.1 percent of the program’s total enroll-
ment. It is unlikely that an increase of that 
magnitude would affect the monthly Part B 
premiums.

March 3, 2022 
In other words, what they are saying 
is it won’t affect the premiums because 
it is a drop in the bucket. We are talk-
ing about 60 or 70 million people, and 
we are talking about 13,000 to 40,000 
people coming into Part B and Part D. 
By the way, again, these people paid 
their HI taxes all throughout their ca-
reers. 
CBO then continued, relative to part 
D—this is the drug benefit: 
H.R. 3076 would require PSHB— 
That is the Postal Health Benefit 
Plan— 
to deliver prescription drug benefits using an 
Employer Group Waiver Plan under Medi-
care Part D. Part D premiums are based on 
the national average monthly bid amount, as 
calculated by the Centers for Medicare & 
Medicaid Services using information from 
applicable plan bids. Because Employer 
Group Waiver Plans are excluded from that 
calculation, CBO estimates that the legisla-
tion’s requirements would not affect Part D 
premiums. 
So let me, again, put it clearly. The 
bill does not impact the solvency of the 
hospital trust fund—the Part A trust 
fund—which is the trust fund we all 
talk about here—period. And the bill 
does not increase Medicare Part B and 
Part D premiums. 
By the way, because of this and be-
cause this saves the post office, this 
legislation 
passed 
the 
House 
with 
strong bipartisan support. Just a cou-
ple of weeks ago, it passed by a vote of 
342 to 92. Not much gets passed in the 
House with those kinds of big bipar-
tisan numbers these days, but saving 
the post office is pretty popular, par-
ticularly when it is done the way this 
is done. 
This was worked out between Mem-
bers on both sides of the aisle and be-
tween both sides of the Capitol. We did 
it carefully. We did it in a way that, 
yes, will save the post office, along 
with the other reforms internally we 
talked about, but in a way that is actu-
ally a money-saver for the taxpayer. 
It is also pretty popular with con-
stituents. It is popular with postal 
workers because they want to have a 
post office that continues to survive. It 
is supported by the Citizens Against 
Government Waste, which wrote a let-
ter acknowledging the importance of 
this bill for ensuring the solvency of 
the post office. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent to have that letter printed in 
the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
COUNCIL FOR CITIZENS 
AGAINST GOVERNMENT WASTE, 
February 7, 2022. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: You will soon be 
voting on H.R. 3076, the Postal Service Re-
form Act of 2021. On behalf of the more than 
one million members and supporters of the 
Council for Citizens Against Government 
Waste (CCAGW), I urge you to support this 
legislation. 
The United States Postal Service (USPS) 
has been the subject of a significant amount 
of justifiable criticism for many years. The 
agency has been on the Government Ac-
countability Office’s High-Risk List since 
2009 due to its unsustainable business model 
and financial condition. There have been 15 
consecutive years of net losses since 2007, to-
taling $91.2 billion. 
H.R. 3076 does not address all of the agen-
cy’s problems, including closing excess fa-
cilities, high labor costs, and greater work 
sharing. But Section 202 of the bill codifies 
an integrated delivery network of packages 
and mail together six days a week. This pro-
vision is supported by the USPS, the Postal 
Regulatory 
Commission 
(PRC), 
mailers, 
shippers, and pro-taxpayer organizations. 
Requiring the USPS to create separate deliv-
ery systems for packages and mail would in-
crease costs, slow down delivery, and raise 
prices for customers. 
According to the PRC, separate networks 
would cost more than $15 billion annually for 
a new fleet of vehicles and tens of thousands 
of new employees. That would make it high-
ly unlikely that the USPS would ever be 
profitable, and very likely that taxpayers 
would be paying for a significant bailout, 
along with a large annual subsidy. 
H.R. 3076 also prevents the USPS from get-
ting into financial services and other non- 
postal 
commercial 
businesses. 
There 
is 
ample evidence that such activities are 
doomed to fail. In the fall of 2021, USPS 
began providing Visa cards of up to $500 to 
customers who used business checks for the 
transactions. They sold six cards between 
September 13, 2021 and January 12, 2022, 
bringing in $37.50 in fees, which is equal to 
the pay for about two hours of work for one 
USPS clerk. As the USPS said in 2014 in re-
sponse to the suggestion by the USPS in-
spector general that the agency should pro-
vide financial services, its ‘‘core function is 
delivery, not banking.’’ 
The bill also increases financial trans-
parency and strengthens inspector general 
oversight. 
While H.R. 3076 does not solve all the 
issues currently facing the USPS, the legis-
lation sets the agency on the path to a more 
sustainable future. For these reasons, I urge 
you to support H.R. 3076. Any votes related 
to H.R. 3076 may be among those considered 
for CCAGW’s 2022 Congressional Ratings. 
Sincerely, 
TOM SCHATZ, 
President. 
Mr. PORTMAN. So I encourage my 
colleagues to join us in support of this 
legislation. Let’s put the Postal Serv-
ice in a position to succeed, and let’s 
provide those essential services to the 
small businesses, veterans, the elderly, 
rural constituents, who rely on it so 
much—the 
prescription 
drugs 
we 
talked 
about, 
the 
Social 
Security 
checks, the rent checks, the utility 
checks, and the ballots. 
I appreciate working with my col-
league Senator GARY PETERS on this, 
over time, to try to find a consensus, 
to try to find a way forward that was 
bipartisan, bicameral, where we could 
actually do something after years and 
years of talking about what bad shape 
the post office is in financially, to do 
something to right the ship, to ensure 
it will be there for the future. 
Let’s pass this bill, and let’s do en-
sure that the post office is healthy for 
all the folks we represent going for-
ward. 
I yield the floor.

CALLOWAY COUNTY 
BICENTENNIAL 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, in 
1822, pioneer settlers founded Calloway 
County in Kentucky’s Jackson Pur-
chase. Two hundred years later, in No-
vember, the residents of this commu-
nity are celebrating their bicentennial 
and paying tribute to the adventurous 
forefathers 
who 
made 
it 
possible. 
Today, I ask my colleagues to join me 
in honoring Calloway County for reach-
ing this impressive milestone. 
Like the rest of the Jackson Pur-
chase, Calloway County was bought by 
the Federal Government from the 
Chickasaw Indians in 1818. This fertile 
land, bordered by the Tennessee, Ohio, 
and Mississippi Rivers, was prime terri-
tory for American farmers seeking to 
move westward from the young Na-
tion’s eastern core. Those early set-
tlers poured into Calloway County, on 
the Purchase’s eastern edge, and incor-
porated the county in 1822, with the 
early settlement of Wadesboro serving 
as their county seat. 
Calloway 
County 
developed 
like 
much of the rest of the Purchase, with 
large farms bolstered by easy access to 
Kentucky’s inland waterways and the 
urban 
markets 
that 
lay 
beyond. 
Calloway’s early residents built a one- 
room, log courthouse in 1823—the first 
public building constructed in the 
Jackson Purchase—and founded several 
towns, including Murray, the current 
county seat. Calloway quickly grew 
into a prosperous community with 
thousands of residents. 
By the end of the 19th century, 
Calloway County formed an integral 
part of Western Kentucky’s commerce, 
culture, and governance. In recognition 
of the county’s significance, Calloway 
native Rainey T. Wells started the 
Calloway Normal College in the 1890s 
to train teachers. Though that school 
closed in 1913, Wells secured State 
funds to construct Murray State Nor-
mal School in 1923, now known as Mur-
ray State University. Wells became 
Murray State’s second president in 1926 
and would go on to practice law in 
front of the Supreme Court in 1937, be-
fore returning to his Calloway County 
home until his death. 
Another 
important 
moment 
in 
Calloway’s history came when the Ten-
nessee Valley Authority dammed the 
Tennessee River and created Kentucky 
Lake, a vast reservoir on the county’s 
eastern edge. In addition to supplying 
hydroelectric power to Calloway Coun-
ty residents, the lake created new rec-
reational attractions for the local com-
munity. Today, Kentucky Lake—and 
the Land Between the Lakes National 
Recreation 
Area 
that 
governs 
its 
neighboring forest areas—is one of the 
largest natural attractions in the Com-
monwealth, bringing millions of tour-
ists to the region every year. 
Today, Calloway County is a unique 
Kentucky community, navigating new 
pathways in education and recreation 
while still remaining firmly rooted in 
its agricultural and historical tradi-
tions. Murray is a burgeoning town 
with nearly 20,000 residents, serving as 
both a host to thousands of Murray 
State University students and a gate-
way to the Land Between the Lakes 
National Recreation Area. The coun-
ty’s 
attractions 
include 
museums, 
parks, Civil War forts, and miles of 
beautiful rolling hills. It is no surprise 
that, every year, more and more fami-
lies decide to call Calloway County 
home. 
Calloway County residents will have 
much to celebrate in their upcoming 
bicentennial. They and their pioneer 
ancestors have built a thriving commu-
nity, complete with everything pro-
spective newcomers could desire in a 
new home. Their upcoming celebration 
will include local civic groups, non-
profits, churches, sports teams, and 
businesses—a colorful tapestry of every 
organization 
that 
makes 
Calloway 
County great. 
I want to give special thanks to the 
Calloway County civic leaders who are 
working so hard to make this year’s bi-
centennial 
celebration 
possible. 
Through their hard work, their com-
munity continues to prosper, even 200 
years after its founding. On behalf of 
the Senate, I share our congratulations 
with every Calloway Countian and join 
them in honoring 200 years of proud 
Kentucky traditions.

REMEMBERING DR. JAMES 
CAMERON 
Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of 
Dr. James Cameron on what would 
have been his 108th birthday. James 
Cameron was born in La Crosse, WI, on 
February 25, 1914. A civil rights pio-
neer, Dr. Cameron fought his entire life 
to create an accountable and equitable 
world. Dr. Cameron left an indelible 
mark on our country as the only 
known person in the United States to 
survive a lynching, an event in 1930 at 
the age of 16 which would inevitably 
change his life. 
Dr. Cameron was an early activist for 
the Civil Rights movement, deseg-
regating the movie theater in the Indi-
ana town where he and his wife, Vir-
ginia, 
lived. 
He 
worked 
with 
the 
NAACP, founding branches in Madison, 
WI, as well as Muncie and South Bend, 
IN. He also served as Indiana’s director 
of civil liberties. 
In 1952, the Cameron family came to 
Milwaukee. Over the years, he acquired 
pieces like Ku Klux Klan robes, as well 
as a piece of rope that had been used 
during his own lynching. After visiting 
Yad Vashem, the World Holocaust Re-
membrance Center in Israel, he set out 
to create a museum with these pieces 
to educate the public about the injus-
tices Black people faced in America. At 
age 74, he founded America’s Black 
Holocaust Museum in the historic 
Bronzeville 
neighborhood 
of 
Mil-
waukee. Three years later, in 1991, In-
diana Governor Evan Bayh gave him 
the key to the city of Marion where he 
had miraculously survived the lynch-

Dr. Cameron so rightly believed that 
only by sharing the hard truths about 
our Nation’s history, could we move 
forward together to promote racial re-
pair, reconciliation, and healing. The 
best word to describe Dr. Cameron was 
‘‘survivor’’ and his life’s work and leg-
acy will now live on with the Grand 
Reemergence of America’s Black Holo-
caust Museum in Milwaukee on Feb-
ruary 25, 2022. With a mission to build 
public awareness of the harmful leg-
acies of slavery, lynching, and Jim 
Crow, America’s Black Holocaust Mu-
seum is guided by a vision of a society 
that remembers its past in order to 
shape a better future, a nation undi-
vided by race where every person mat-
ters equally. This will be a home for 
others to take the lesson that, in order 
to create an equitable world, we must 
first create a world willing to grow.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING NEELEY FAMILY 
DISTILLERY 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, as ranking 
member of the Senate Committee on 
Small Business and Entrepreneurship, 
each week I recognize an outstanding 
Kentucky small business that exempli-
fies the American entrepreneurial spir-
it. This week, it is my privilege to rec-
ognize the small business, Neeley Fam-
ily Distillery of Sparta, KY as the Sen-
ate Small Business of the Week. 
Today, I honor a business deeply 
rooted in Kentucky history. Founded 
in 2015, the Neeley Family Distillery 
bares a history far older than their 
date 
of 
official 
registration. 
The 
Neeley family has been distilling and 
bootlegging illegally in the mountains 
of Eastern Kentucky for 11 genera-
tions, with James Neeley distilling the 
first batch of Neeley family whiskey on 
American soil in 1740. James Neeley 
came to the New World with a mastery 
passed down to him by his Irish fore-
fathers. Ten generations later, James’ 
descendant and lead distiller Royce 
Neeley uses many of these same skills 
to craft fine Kentucky Bourbon. 
Though 
his 
single-barrel 
bourbon 
earned him a gold medal from the 2020 
World Spirits Competition, Royce is 
just as famous for his moonshine. 
Royce’s 
great 
grandfather 
Leonard 
Neeley developed the moonshine over 
100 years ago, by adding sugar to the 
original family recipe for rye whiskey. 
This concoction was so popular in the 
days of underground bootlegging that 
it led a vicious and at times violent ri-
valry with another local bootlegging 
family. Artifacts from this trialing era 
are all on display at the Neeley Family 
Distillery in Sparta, including the pis-
tol Royce’s great-grandfather used to 
shoot another moonshiner. Though the 
Neeley family business is no longer 
under threat of the law or mob rivals, 
Royce proudly bears that history in 
the creation of all of the distillery’s 
products. 
Carrying the torch that his fore-
father lit long ago, Royce brought the 
Neeley family name to the legal pro-
duction of bourbon for the first time in 
2015. Starting out as a young entre-
preneur with a wealth of expertise, he 
steadily grew his business in the years 
to come. However it was not until 5 
years later that Royce switched gears 
and entered into a new kind of produc-
tion. Faced with gross shortages of es-
sential products during the early days 
of the COVID–19 pandemic, the Neeley 
Family Distillery joined forces with 
other Kentucky distillers to produce 
nearly 125,000 gallons of hand sanitizer. 
Together, the distilleries donated the 
much 
needed 
product 
to 
frontline 
workers across the Commonwealth. 
Fulfilling this desperate need required 
immediate retooling of their facilities, 
sourcing of necessary products, and to-
tally shutting down their production of 
bourbon. The COVID–19 pandemic illus-
trated that an industry, once spurned 
by authorities during the days of Pro-
hibition, could rise to be great stew-
ards of their community during times 
of hardship and duress. 
The Neeley Family Distillery has 
since returned to their regular produc-
tion 
of 
Kentucky’s 
iconic 
spirit, 
though they remain ready to answer 
the call of their community. Realizing 
the extent of destruction their western 
neighbors sustained in the 2021 tor-
nados, the Neeley Family Distillery 
again joined forces with the Kentucky 
Distillers Association, as well as the 
Bourbon Crusader, to organize a ben-
efit auction in support of relief efforts. 
This once-in-a-lifetime bourbon auc-
tion led to a $3.4 million check bene-
fiting the State’s Western Kentucky 
Tornado Relief Fund. In their 7 years 
of operation, this small business has 
not only earned top ranking awards on 
the quality of their product, they have 
earned themselves a record for serving 
their community during times of ad-
versity. 
Small businesses like the Neeley 
Family Distillery are the lifeblood of 
towns across Kentucky, and the rich 
history of bourbon and its times of 
legal and illegal production is an intri-
cate detail in the fabric of our State. 
The Neeley family proudly honors that 
history by continuing the tradition of 
fine Kentucky craftsmanship and look-
ing out for one’s neighbor. Congratula-
tions to the Neeley family and the en-
tire distillery team. I wish them the 
best of luck and look forward to watch-
ing their continued growth and success 
in Kentucky.∑

The PRESIDING OFFICER laid be-
fore the Senate the following message 
from the President of the United 
States, together with an accompanying 
report; which was referred to the Com-
mittee 
on 
Banking, 
Housing, 
and 
Urban Affairs: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides 
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90 
days prior to the anniversary date of 
its declaration, the President publishes 
in the Federa1 Register and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to 
the Federal Register for publication the 
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency declared in Executive 
Order 13288 of March 6, 2003, with re-
spect to the actions and policies of cer-
tain members of the Government of 
Zimbabwe and other persons to under-
mine Zimbabwe’s democratic processes 
or institutions is to continue in effect 
beyond March 6, 2022. 
President Emmerson Mnangagwa has 
not made the necessary political and 
economic reforms that would warrant 
terminating the existing targeted sanc-
tions program. Throughout the last 
year, 
government 
security 
services 
routinely intimidated and violently re-
pressed citizens, including members of 
opposition 
political 
parties, 
union 
members, and journalists. The absence 
of progress on the most fundamental 
reforms needed to ensure the rule of 
law, democratic governance, and the 
protection of human rights leaves 
Zimbabweans vulnerable to ongoing re-
pression and presents a continuing 
threat to peace and security in the re-
gion. 
The actions and policies of certain 
members 
of 
the 
Government 
of 
Zimbabwe and other persons to under-
mine Zimbabwe’s democratic processes 
or institutions continue to pose an un-
usual and extraordinary threat to the 
foreign policy of the United States. 
Therefore, I have determined that it is 
necessary to continue the national 
emergency declared in Executive Order 
13288, as amended, with respect to 
Zimbabwe and to maintain in force the 
sanctions to respond to this threat.

12957 OF MARCH 15, 1995, WITH

from the President of the United 
States, together with an accompanying 
report; which was referred to the Com-
mittee 
on 
Banking,

To the Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-

the Federal Register for publication the 
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency with respect to Iran 
that was declared on March 15, 1995, is 
to continue in effect beyond March 15, 
2022. 
The actions and policies of the Gov-
ernment of Iran continue to pose an 
unusual and extraordinary threat to 
the national security, foreign policy, 
and economy of the United States. 
For these reasons, I have determined 
that it is necessary to continue the na-
tional emergency declared in Executive 
Order 12957 with respect to Iran and to 
maintain in force comprehensive sanc-
tions against Iran to respond to this

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. CARPER (for himself, Mr. 
BOOZMAN, and Mrs. CAPITO): 
S. 3743. A bill to require the Adminis-
trator of the Environmental Protection 
Agency to carry out certain activities 
to improve recycling and composting 
programs in the United States, and for 
other purposes; to the Committee on 
Environment and Public Works. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, today I 
am pleased to introduce, alongside the 
Senator from Arkansas, Mr. BOOZMAN, 
and the Senator from West Virginia, 
Mrs. 
CAPITO, 
the 
Recycling 
and 
Composting Accountability Act. 
This bill is the result of true collabo-
ration 
and 
reflects 
a 
substantial 
amount of bipartisan effort to address 
our Nation’s recycling and composting 
challenges. This bill aims to improve 
the Environmental Protection Agen-
cy’s ability to gather data on our Na-
tion’s recycling systems and explore 
opportunities for implementing a na-
tional composting strategy. 
The availability of good data is one 
of the major challenges facing the pub-
lic and private sector as they work 
make investments to improve our recy-
cling systems. Upgrading recycling in-
frastructure, expanding recycling serv-
ices, and increasing recycling edu-
cation will all benefit from the avail-
ability of better data. 
Specifically, this bill will create a 
comprehensive database of all curbside 
recycling and composting programs na-
tionwide. It will also assess the mate-
rials those programs collect and their 
rates of contamination. The bill will 
also look at barriers communities and 
individuals face when trying to access 
recycling and composting services. 
In addition to that, the bill will ask 
the EPA to study the end market sale 
of recyclable and compostable mate-
rials. It also directs the EPA to develop 
a way to measure how otherwise recy-
clable materials are being lost from 
the circular market. The reports from 
both of these studies will be immeas-
urably helpful to stakeholders, commu-
nities, and local and State govern-
ments. 
As part of the Infrastructure Invest-
ment and Jobs Act, Congress provided 
unprecedented levels of funding for re-
cycling infrastructure and educational 
programs. The bill I am introducing 
today represents our next step in build-
ing on these efforts—to turn the chal-
lenges of recycling and composting 
into opportunities to reduce planet- 
warming emissions and create good- 
paying jobs. 
I look forward to working with my 
colleagues to enact this legislation this 
Congress. I ask unanimous consent 
that a copy of the legislation be print-
ed in the RECORD following my state-
ment. 
There being no objection, the text of 
the bill was ordered to be printed in 
the RECORD, as follows: 
S. 3743

SHALL, and Mr. WICKER) submitted the 
following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Foreign 
Relations: 
S. RES. 531 
Whereas the United States of America has 
a responsibility to uphold the values of free-
dom, democracy, and human rights across 
the globe; 
Whereas there are several universal dec-
larations promoting human rights, laws of 
war, and upholding the dignity of individ-
uals; 
Whereas the United Nations Charter Pre-
amble states that member nations ‘‘reaffirm 
faith in fundamental human rights [and] in 
the dignity and worth of the human person’’; 
Whereas the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights Preamble states that ‘‘Mem-
ber States have pledged themselves to 
achieve, in cooperation with the United Na-
tions, the promotion of universal respect for 
and observance of human rights and funda-
mental freedoms’’; 
Whereas the Russian Federation joined as 
an original member of the United Nations as 
the former Union of Soviet Socialists Repub-
lics on October 24, 1945, and as such has a 
duty to abide by the conditions of the United 
Nations Charter; 
Whereas the International Criminal Court 
(ICC) is an international tribunal that seeks 
to uphold the rule of law, especially in areas 
where no rule of law exists, by investigating 
and trying individuals charged ‘‘with the 
gravest crimes of concern to the inter-
national community: genocide, war crimes, 
crimes against humanity and the crime of 
aggression’’; 
Whereas the ICC recognizes the grave 
breaches of the 1949 Geneva Conventions as 
constituting a war crime, including ‘‘wilful 
killing, torture or inhuman treatment, in-
cluding 
biological 
experiments, 
wilfully 
causing great suffering or serious injury to 
body or health, and extensive destruction 
and appropriation of property, not justified 
by military necessity and carried out unlaw-
fully and wantonly’’; 
Whereas the ICC also recognizes other seri-
ous violations of the laws and customs appli-
cable in international armed conflict as war 
crimes, including ‘‘[i]ntentionally directing 
attacks against the civilian population as 
such or against individual civilians not tak-
ing 
direct 
part 
in 
hostilities’’ 
and 
‘‘[i]ntentionally directing attacks against ci-
vilian objects, that is, objects which are not 
military objectives’’; 
Whereas President Vladimir Putin, mem-
bers of the Russian Security Council, and 
President Putin’s military commanders have 
severely undermined the international rule 
of law through their various actions; 
Whereas, prior to the invasion of Ukraine 
in 2022, President Vladimir Putin and the 
Russian Federation has a long history of 
committing acts of aggression, human rights 
violations, and acts that constitute war 
crimes within the Russian Federation and 
around the globe, including in Chechnya, 
Georgia, Ukraine, and Syria; 
Whereas, beginning in 1999, the Russian 
Federation engaged in the indiscriminate 
use of force against the people of Chechnya, 
including the use of cluster munitions 
against 
civilians, 
resulting 
in 
50,000 
Chechens, mostly civilians, dead or missing; 
Whereas, during the Russian Federation’s 
invasion of Georgia in 2008, Russian Armed 
Forces engaged with cluster munitions in in-
discriminate and disproportionate attacks 
that resulted in the death of civilians; 
Whereas President Vladimir Putin violated 
the sovereignty of Ukraine and used military 
force to seize control and unlawfully occupy 
Crimea and eastern Ukraine, indiscrimi-
nately targeting and killing thousands of in-
nocent civilians since 2014; 
Whereas the Russian military was deemed 
responsible for shooting down Malaysia Air-
lines Flight 17 over eastern Ukraine on July 
17, 2014, which resulted in the death of 298 ci-
vilians; 
Whereas rebel forces supported by the Rus-
sian Federation were deemed responsible for 
a missile attack on January 24, 2015, in 
Mariupol, Ukraine that indiscriminately tar-
geted civilians, resulting in the death of at 
least 30 and injuring many more; 
Whereas, in 2016 and 2017, Russian aircraft 
deployed ‘‘bunker-busting’’ and incendiary 
bombs capable of destroying military instal-
lations on civilian structures in Aleppo, 
Syria, resulting in the death of hundreds of 
civilians; 
Whereas 
President 
Vladimir 
Putin 
is 
complicit in war crimes and human rights 
violations in Syria through his continuing 
political, financial, and military support for 
President Bashar al-Assad; 
Whereas 
intelligence 
assessments 
have 
concluded Vladimir Putin and his regime 
have destroyed the rule of law in Russia and 
engaged in countless crimes against human-
ity, including ordering the poisoning of Alexi 
Navalny, the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia 
Skripal, and the false imprisonment and tor-
ture ultimately leading to the death of 
Sergei Magnitsky; 
Whereas President Vladimir Putin, in Feb-
ruary 
2022, 
initiated 
a 
premeditated, 
unprovoked, unjustified, and unlawful war 
against the sovereign nation of Ukraine; 
Whereas, 
in 
February 
2022, 
President 
Vladimir Putin and Russian Federation 
forces targeted and reportedly killed more 
than 300 civilians, to include children, while 
engaging in Ukrainian urban centers, caus-
ing chaos and fear among Ukrainian citizens; 
Whereas, on February 28, 2022, the Ukrain-
ian 
Ambassador 
to 
the 
United 
States, 
Oksana Markarova, claimed President Vladi-
mir 
Putin 
ordered 
the 
deployment 
of 
thermobaric weapons and cluster munitions 
to be used in the northeastern towns of 
Okhtyrka and Karkhiv; 
Whereas Ukraine has twice submitted to 
the jurisdiction of the ICC for the purposes 
of prosecuting war crimes committed within 
its territory due to the Russian occupation 
of Ukraine; 
Whereas Lithuania and Canada, members 
to the authorizing treaty of the ICC, have 
called on the ICC to open an investigation 
into possible war crimes committed by Rus-
sia; 
Whereas, on February 28, 2022, the Pros-
ecutor of the ICC, Karim A.A. Khan QC stat-
ed that the ICC would open a third investiga-
tion against Russia for alleged war crimes 
and crimes against humanity committed 
during the Russian invasion into Ukraine, 
which began on February 24, 2022; 
Whereas Ukraine has also filed a claim in 
the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in-
stituting proceedings against the Russian 
Federation for genocide; and 
Whereas the United States Government 
should use its voice, vote, and influence to 
pursue war crimes allegations against Vladi-
mir Putin and his military commanders in 
international institutions of which it is a 
member and encourage other allies and part-
ners to express the same: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) strongly condemns the ongoing vio-
lence, war crimes, crimes against humanity, 
and systematic human rights abuses contin-
ually being carried out by the Russian 
Armed Forces and their proxies and Presi-
dent Putin’s military commanders, at the di-
rection of President Vladimir Putin; 
(2) encourages member states to petition 
the ICC and the ICJ to authorize any and all 
pending investigations into war crimes and 
crimes against humanity committed by the 
Russian Armed Forces and their proxies and

SURGEONS 
COMMITTEE 
ON 
TRAUMA AND THE IMPORTANCE 
OF 
PREVENTING 
INJURY 
AND 
SAVING MORE LIVES FROM IN-
JURY AROUND THE GLOBE 
Mr. BOOZMAN (for himself and Mr. 
MENENDEZ) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 532 
Whereas traumatic injury is the most com-
mon cause of death for individuals aged 1–45 
years and the cause of nearly 200,000 deaths 
per year in the United States; 
Whereas 45,000,000 Americans live more 
than one hour away from a Level I or Level 
II trauma center; 
Whereas trauma systems are designed to 
deliver optimal trauma care for injured pa-
tients, informed by best evidence and acces-
sible to all injured patients, regardless of 
circumstance; 
Whereas the Committee on Trauma was es-
tablished by the American College of Sur-
geons (ACS) in 1922 to develop and imple-
ment programs that support injury preven-
tion and ensure optimal patient outcomes 
across the continuum of care; 
Whereas the ACS Committee on Trauma 
works to improve the care of injured pa-
tients through activities in trauma system 
evaluation, trauma center verification, trau-
ma quality improvement, and education; 
Whereas the ACS Committee on Trauma 
endeavors to improve care for injured pa-
tients by setting standards of care, meas-
uring risk-adjusted patient outcomes, pro-
moting best practices, and driving perform-
ance improvement; 
Whereas the ACS Committee on Trauma 
has focused continuously and collaboratively 
through a public health approach to prevent 
injuries, with major reductions in the risk of 
injury, particularly from motor vehicle colli-
sions; 
Whereas the ACS Committee on Trauma 
created the Consultation/Verification Pro-
gram in 1987 to assist hospitals in the eval-
uation and improvement of trauma care and 
provide objective, external review of institu-
tional capabilities and performance; 
Whereas the ACS Committee on Trauma 
created the National Trauma Data Bank, the 
largest aggregation of United States trauma 
registries ever assembled, in 1989, to gen-
erate data sets for expanding knowledge in 
trauma through research; 
Whereas the ACS Committee on Trauma 
created the Trauma Systems Consultation 
Program in 1996 to review State and regional 
trauma systems and provide recommenda-
tions for system improvement and enhance-
ment; 
Whereas the ACS Committee on Trauma 
created the Trauma Quality Improvement 
Program in 2008 to elevate the quality of 
care for trauma patients by collecting data 
from trauma centers, providing feedback on 
performance compared to national bench-
marks, and identifying institutional charac-
teristics for optimal patient outcomes; 
Whereas the ACS Committee on Trauma 
established the STOP THE BLEED campaign 
in 2015 to prepare the public to save lives by 
teaching people three quick actions to con-
trol serious bleeding and save lives; and 
Whereas the ACS Committee on Trauma is 
committed to developing a National Trauma 
and Emergency Preparedness System that 
saves more lives from daily injury and mass 
casualty events by connecting local, State, 
and regional trauma systems and informing 
best practice through standards and re-
search: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate recognizes the 
100th anniversary of the American College of 
Surgeons Committee on Trauma and its sig-
nificant contributions to preventing injury 
and saving lives from injury in the United 
States and around the globe.

RESOLUTION 
533—CELE-
BRATING THE CENTENNIAL OF 
NAVY AIRCRAFT CARRIERS 
Mr. KAINE (for himself and Mr. WAR-
NER) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Armed Services: 
S. RES. 533 
Whereas 100 years ago, on March 20, 1922, 
following a 2-year conversion at Norfolk 
Naval Shipyard, the former USS Jupiter (Col-
lier #3) was recommissioned as USS Langley 
(CV–1), the first aircraft carrier of the Navy; 
Whereas USS Langley began as an experi-
mental platform, laying the foundation for 
the future shipboard operations of aircraft; 
Whereas, in fleet exercises beginning in 
1924, the USS Langley, appropriately nick-
named the ‘‘Covered Wagon’’, demonstrated 
the potential of the aircraft carrier as an in-
valuable weapons system that would trans-
form how the Navy fought at sea; 
Whereas, for the past 100 years, aircraft 
carriers have been the preeminent power pro-
jection platform for the Navy and have 
furthered United States interest in times of 
war and peace; 
Whereas, from the great naval battles in 
the Pacific Ocean during World War II to 
strike and close air support missions in the 
battlegrounds of the Korean Peninsula and 
Vietnam, the execution of joint force oper-
ations over the sands of the Middle East, and 
present-day deterrence in numerous loca-
tions around the world, aircraft carriers 
have proven time and again that they in-
valuable in supporting the strategic goals of 
the United States; 
Whereas, with an unequaled ability to pro-
vide warfighting capabilities across the full 
spectrum of conflict and to adapt in the face 
of ever-changing threats, aircraft carriers 
and their embarked air wings and associated 
strike groups are the foundation of United 
States maritime strategy; 
Whereas aircraft carriers enable the Armed 
Forces to carry out operations from inter-
national waters, often obviating the need to 
obtain flyover and land-based rights from 
other countries; 
Whereas Nimitz and Gerald R. Ford-class 
aircraft carriers are modern, mobile military 
bases each complete with an airfield, a hos-
pital, and a hardened communications sys-
tem from which the United States can strike 
at enemies, wherever and whenever it choos-
es; 
Whereas there are more than 2,450 compa-
nies in 48 States and more than 364 congres-
sional districts and more than 13,100 individ-
uals, who proudly contribute to the con-
struction and maintenance of these complex 
and technologically advanced ships; and 
Whereas countless members of the Armed 
Forces have served the United States aboard 
aircraft carriers in war, peace, and times of 
crisis: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes that aircraft carriers con-
tinue to be a cornerstone of the Navy and 
play a vital role in the defense of the United 
States; 
(2) acknowledges that, in a time of great 
power competition that the world has not 
seen for over 30 years, aircraft carriers will 
continue to be an absolutely vital strategic 
platform that the United States can wield to 
ensure security and stability throughout the 
world, now and well into the future; 
(3) in this 100th year since USS Langley 
(CV–1) was commissioned at Norfolk Naval 
Shipyard, recognizes the role aircraft car-
riers have played in securing peace for the 
United States and the continuing role air-
craft carriers will play in maintaining peace 
and security for the United States; and 
(4) celebrates the centennial of Navy air-
craft carriers.

RICH, Mr. SCOTT of Florida, and Mr. 
PADILLA) submitted the following reso-
lution; 
which 
was 
considered 
and 
agreed to: 
S. RES. 535 
Whereas, since 1898, after the Spanish- 
American War and following the ratification 
of the Treaty of Paris, Puerto Rico has been 
a territory of the United States; 
Whereas Puerto Rico is located approxi-
mately 1,000 miles southeast of Florida;

dent Woodrow Wilson recognized and wel-
comed the people of Puerto Rico into the 
United States as citizens by signing into law

Whereas, since that time, Puerto Ricans 
have worked diligently to make countless

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S997 
March 3, 2022 
for other purposes; which was ordered 
to lie on the table; as follows: 
At the end, add the following: 
TITLE IV—EASE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH 
SERVICES ACT 
SEC. 401. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds as follows: 
(1) Nearly 18 percent of adults in the 
United States reported a mental, behavioral, 
or emotional disorder in 2015. 
(2) Children are also significantly im-
pacted. According to the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, 1 in 6 children ages 
2 years through 8 years have a diagnosed 
mental, behavioral, or developmental dis-
order, indicating that disorders begin in 
early childhood and affect lifelong health. 
(3) Moreover, 1 in 7 children and adoles-
cents have at least one treatable mental 
health disorder. 
(4) There is a critical link between mental 
health and substance use disorders. Accord-
ing to the Substance Abuse and Mental 
Health Services Administration, 1 in 4 adults 
with severe mental illness had a substance 
use disorder in 2017. 
(5) Moreover, children who have had a 
major depressive episode are more than 
twice as likely to use illicit drugs. 
(6) In 2017, approximately 19.7 million peo-
ple aged 12 years or older had a substance 
use disorder related to their use of alcohol or 
illicit drugs in the past year. 
(7) Despite this overwhelming need, access 
to behavioral health services remains among 
the most pressing health care challenges in 
our country. 
(8) An estimated 56 percent of Americans 
with a mental health disorder did not receive 
treatment in 2017. 
(9) Similarly, half of children and adoles-
cents did not receive treatment for their 
mental health disorder in 2016. 
(10) Further complicating access to care, as 
demand for behavioral health services in-
creases in communities across the United 
States, the number of psychiatrists available 
to treat them continues to decline. 
(11) The population of practicing psychia-
trists declined by more than 10 percent be-
tween the period of 2003 through 2013, while 
the population of primary care physicians 
and neurologists grew during the same pe-
riod. 
(12) Technology has evolved to connect in-
dividuals to health care services in new 
ways, including via telehealth. 
(13) Moreover, studies show that video vis-
its are an effective strategy to provide men-
tal health treatment to children and, in fact, 
may be preferable in some cases. 
(14) During the 115th Congress, Congress 
recognized the potential of telehealth to en-
sure that those in urgent need of substance 
use disorder treatment receive the care they 
require. 
(15) As passed and signed into law, sections 
2001 and 1009 of the SUPPORT for Patients 
and Communities Act (Public Law 115–271) 
expands the use of telehealth services for the 
treatment of opioid use disorder and other 
substance use disorders. 
(16) It is widely recognized that there is a 
close relationship between mental health 
and substance use disorders. 
SEC. 402. MEDICARE TREATMENT OF BEHAV-
IORAL

FUR-
NISHED THROUGH TELEHEALTH.

dignity. 
(2) Colonel Powell served as the base com-
mander of Goodfellow Air Force Base from 
1980 to 1984. 
(3) When the Powells moved to San Angelo, 
Charles was ordered to help Goodfellow avoid 
closure and the displacement of many mem-
bers of the Armed Forces from the commu-
nity they had grown to love. 
(4) The impact of Charles’ career can still 
be felt today at Goodfellow Air Force Base, 
as it serves as a training school for thou-
sands of members from every Armed Force 
to train in cryptology, intelligence, and fire-
fighting. 
(5) JoAnne assisted thousands of constitu-
ents in the district offices of Representatives 
Tom Loeffler, Lamar Smith, K. Michael Con-
away, and August Pfluger.

headed was the annual process of nomina-
tions to the military service academies, 
which was always a year-round process for 
her. 
(7) With JoAnne’s assistance, many of the 
young men and women of the 11th congres-
sional district of Texas went on to serve the 
United States and attend one of the military 
service academies. 
(8) In addition, JoAnne was a fierce advo-
cate of veterans and helped thousands of in-
dividuals gain access to the veterans benefits 
they rightfully earned. 
(9) JoAnne’s compassion and dedication 
helped make the Concho Valley a better 
place.

Thursday, March 3, 2022 
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the life of a pioneer of global 
health and the dear friend of many in the Con-
gress. Dr. Paul Farmer sadly passed away 
last week in Rwanda at a hospital and univer-
sity that he helped establish, while doing what 
he loved most: working to improve the lives of 
those in need. 
Dr. Farmer saw a world in need and worked 
to heal it. A true revolutionary in the field of 
medicine, he forever altered our understanding 
of the fight against global poverty and how to 
care for those in need. Driven by an 
unyielding belief in the dignity of every person, 
he devoted his life to realizing this essential 
truth: health care is a human right, not a privi-
lege. 
As the Co-Founder of Partners In Health, 
Dr. Farmer brought his brilliant medical acu-
men, tireless work ethic and deep compassion 
to deliver his unique and innovative brand of 
compassionate care around the world. Along-
side his dedicated colleagues Dr. Jim Yong 
Kim and Ophelia Dahl, he helped to fight HIV 
in Haiti, tuberculosis in Peru, Ebola in Sierra 
Leone—to name just a few. 
With his life-changing work in Rwanda, he 
helped the government rebuild the nation’s en-
tire public health system and drastically im-
prove outcomes for the Rwandan people. Per-
sonally, it was a privilege to see his saintly 
work first-hand on our Congressional delega-
tion to Haiti in 2015, when we visited one of 
his initiatives to address the needs of orphan 
children. 
Beyond his heroic work abroad, Dr. Farmer 
was also deeply committed to shaping the 
next generation of doctors and public health 
leaders. At Harvard Medical School, he served 
as the Kolokotrones University Professor and 
Chair of the Department of Global Health and 
Social Medicine, where he inspired so many 
students to carry on his lifelong mission, as ar-
ticulated by the title of one of his books: To 
Repair the World. 
The world was in awe of Dr. Farmer’s im-
mense love for others—even those who lived 
half a world away and whom he had never 
met. Often, he would live in the communities 
he served, relocating his family for extended 
periods of time so they could be closer to 
those in need. It is a testament to his leg-
endary ability to connect with others that he 
was godfather to more than 100 children, most 
of whom he met during his service in Haiti. 
And the partnership in public health and beau-
tiful love he shared with his wife, Didi, was a 
joy to behold for all fortunate enough to know 
them. 
While Dr. Farmer’s passing is an enormous 
loss for the world, his powerful vision lives on 
in the institutions he built, the students he 
mentored, the hearts he touched and the lives 
he saved. 
May it be a comfort to Didi and their three 
children that so many in Congress, our Coun-
try and in the world join them in mourning this 
extraordinary hero. May he rest in peace.

SUPPORTING THE PEOPLE OF 
UKRAINE 
SPEECH OF 
HON. NANCY PELOSI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 2, 2022 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, since Russia 
launched its unprovoked, premediated war, 
the world has been awed by the extraordinary 
courage and resolve of the Ukrainian people, 
who—as we speak—are fighting against great 
odds to defend their sovereignty, their coun-
try’s territorial integrity and their lives. 
Their resilience is an inspiration. Their iron 
will is nothing short of heroic. And their deter-
mination to save their democracy is a beacon 
to which the world has rallied. 
But as they fight, Ukrainians face a situation 
of severe violence and chaos unleashed by 
Putin. Congress remains extremely concerned 
about reports of potentially thousands of 
Ukrainian civilian casualties, including children. 
And we are concerned about the humanitarian 
situation facing the nearly 1 million Ukrainians 
who have been forced to flee their country. 
During this time of suffering for the Ukrain-
ian people, America and the world must be 
there for them: without delay or reservation. 
Led by President Biden and our allies, the 
international community has come together 
with historic strength and coordination to hold 
Russia accountable and to support Ukraine. 
President Biden prepared or this moment: 
for months, calling out Putin and countering 
his lies, building a coalition of freedom-loving 
countries, and making clear that we stand with 
Ukraine. 
Indeed, instead of dividing the U.S. from its 
partners, Putin’s actions have united the 
world, further isolated Russia and strength-
ened NATO. 
Now, with our partners, we are imposing 
costs on Russia for its lethal aggression that 
will leave it diminished on the world stage and 
weakened in every way: economically, dip-
lomatically, and strategically. 
Our actions include powerful economic 
sanctions, 
cutting 
off 
Russia’s 
banks, 
hamstringing its Central Bank, choking off its 
access to technology, going after the oligarchs 
that fund war, and much more. 
And we are continuing to fully support the 
people of Ukraine—with America delivering 
over $1 billion in direct security assistance 
over the last year alone. With our allies, we 
will continue to provide security assistance, 
humanitarian and economic assistance, and 
bolster NATO. 
Today, with this resolution, Congress is 
sending a further message to Ukraine and the 
world of our unwavering support for Ukraine, 
as we: 
Demand an immediate withdrawal of Rus-
sian forces and end to their violence; 
Support, 
unequivocally, 
Ukraine’s 
sov-
ereignty and territorial integrity; and 
Reaffirm our commitment to further action to 
support Ukraine and to isolate Russia, to-
gether with our partners and NATO allies. 
As the resolution states, Congress ‘‘stands 
steadfastly, staunchly, proudly, and fervently 
behind the Ukrainian people in their fight 
against the authoritarian Putin regime.’’ 
I thank Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman 
GREGORY
MEEKS, and the Congressional 
Ukraine Caucus, particularly Congresswoman 
MARCY KAPTUR, who has been a champion for 
Ukraine in the Congress for decades. I also 
thank Congresswoman VICTORIA SPARTZ (born 
and raised in Ukraine). 
As President Biden said in his State of the 
Union Address yesterday evening: ‘‘When the 
history of this era is written, Putin’s war on 
Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the 
rest of the world stronger. 
‘‘In the battle between democracy and au-
tocracy, democracies are rising to the mo-
ment, and the world is clearly choosing the 
side of peace and security. 
‘‘Putin may circle Kyiv with tanks, but he will 
never gain the hearts and souls of the Ukrain-
ian people. He will never extinguish their love 
of freedom. He will never weaken the resolve 
of the free world.’’ 
As we pray for the people of Ukraine, we re-
main resolute in our commitment to action to 
hold Putin accountable and to supporting de-
mocracy, peace, and security in the region 
and around the world. 
I urge a strong bipartisan vote for this reso-
lution to support Ukraine as its people fight for 
peace, freedom and the future of their nation.

Network, LLC (CCPN) to create business and 
medical connections between more than 3,600 
North Carolinian clinicians. He also helped 
found and served as the President and Execu-
tive Officer of Community Care of North Caro-
lina (CCNC) which currently offers primary 
care medical home services to over 1.5 million 
people across the state. His medical and man-
agement expertise is nationally renowned, and 
he serves as a steady consultant to the Na-
tional 
Governor’s 
Association, 
the 
White 
House, Congress, and the National Institutes 
of Medicine on account of the innovative suc-
cess of the CCNC model. 
In addition to his accomplishments in the 
medical field, Dr. Dobson’s leadership has 
brought much economic growth and develop-
ment to Cabarrus County. He founded 73 & 
Main in Mount Pleasant which remains one of 
the most popular restaurants in Cabarrus 
County. He also played a paramount role in 
establishing Southern Grace Distilleries at old 
Mount Pleasant Prison. These ventures af-
fected great economic progress in the region 
by encouraging the development of many new 
small businesses. 
Dr. Dobson’s unmeasurable contributions to 
his community make him truly deserving of 
this award. His hard work and dedication to 
supporting those in need will serve as a model 
for all healthcare providers and entrepreneurs 
to emulate. I know I speak for our entire com-
munity in wishing him continued success and 
happiness as he continues to affect positive 
change through excellent leadership and serv-
ice. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in 
congratulating Dr. L. Allen Dobson, Jr. on re-
ceiving the 2021 Cabarrus Regional Chamber

IN MEMORY OF BISHOP LEONARD 
N. SMITH 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 3, 2022 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, it 
is with a heavy heart and solemn remem-
brance that I rise today to pay homage to an 
outstanding man of God, published author, 
distinguished educator, life coach, and mentor, 
Bishop Leonard N. Smith. Bishop Smith 
transitioned from labor to reward on Sunday, 
February 20, 2022. His homegoing service will 
be held on Saturday, March 5, 2022, at 11 
a.m. at the Mount Zion Baptist Church located 
at 18410 Chapel Drive in Triangle, Virginia. He 
leaves behind a loving family, his dedicated 
church congregation at the Mount Zion Baptist 
Church (MZBC), and an appreciative commu-
nity for his extraordinary life of service to God 
and humankind. 
Bishop Leonard N. Smith was born in Balti-
more, Maryland, and raised in Washington, 
D.C. He was a man of God, truly devoted to 
his calling—a calling from God, passed to him 
through his grandmother, whose powerful 
Christian teachings would later become the 
base for his powerful sermons. 
Looking to further knowledge of the Word 
for himself and others, throughout his life, 
Bishop Smith pursued a bachelor’s degree 
from Richmond Virginia Seminary, a master’s 
degree in Divinity, and a Doctor of Ministry 
from the Virginia University of Lynchburg in 
addition to receiving nine honorary degrees. 
He also taught online classes at two sem-
inaries as he furthered his own education. 
His commitment to pastoral ministry excel-
lence began in 1985 when Union Baptist 
Church in Gordonsville, Virginia called on him 
to serve as their Pastor and spiritual leader. 
After four and half years at Union Baptist, 
Bishop Smith was chosen to shepherd the 
congregation at Rivermont Baptist Church in 
Lynchburg, Virginia. In 1991, Mount Zion Bap-
tist Church called him to become the suc-
cessor to their then leader, Dr. Oswald G. 
Smith. Through Bishop Smith’s dedicated 
leadership, Mount Zion grew both spiritually 
and numerically as it exemplified the teachings 
of Christ by provided tutoring, food assistance, 
financial and missions support to the sur-
rounding community, and its residents as well 
as people and organizations throughout the 
state, nation, and world. Bishop Smith would 
go on to serve as the Senior Minister of Mount 
Zion Baptist Church for 30 years until his re-
tirement from the ministry of God on Decem-
ber 31, 2021. 
Bishop Smith believed strongly that involve-
ment in his communities was an integral part 
of his calling as a Minister of the Gospel of 
Jesus Christ. Accordingly, he served in numer-
ous roles that had as their purpose the uplift 
of humankind. In addition to being the beloved 
Pastor of MZBC, he served proudly as the 
President of the Richmond, Virginia Seminary 
(2005 to 2008) and the President of the Vir-
ginia Baptist State Convention (2009 to 2012), 
where he served with integrity, innovation, and 
impassioned leadership. Bishop Smith was 
also involved with numerous county, denomi-
national, educational, non-profit, and state 
boards & commissions including the Arlington 
County Fire and Police Departments (where 
he served as the Chaplain); the Richmond Vir-
ginia Seminary (where he was the Chan-
cellor); Virginia University (where he served as 
the Assistant to the President); the Progres-
sive National Baptist Convention, Inc. (where 
he was an active member who served in sev-
eral capacities); the Global United Fellowship 
(where he was the Vice Presiding Bishop and 
the Global Leader of Pastors); and the Gospel 
Heritage Foundation (where he was an advi-
sory board member). 
Bishop Smith was also a sought-after lec-
turer, teacher, and with the release of his book 
entitled, ‘‘We Need to Talk: Saying What We 
Need to Say Without Hurting Each Other’’, he 
was also an author. 
Bishop Smith accomplished much in his life, 
but none of it would have been possible with-
out the Grace of God and the love and sup-
port of his family including his wife, Yalonda; 
his children, Tiffany and Phillip; and all those 
in his congregation and community. 
Mother Teresa once said that ‘‘At the end of 
life we will not be judged by how many diplo-
mas we have received, how much money we 
have made, how many great things we have 
done. We will be judged by whether ‘‘. . . 
when I was hungry, you gave me something 
to eat, when I was naked, you clothed me, 
and whether, when I was homeless, you took 
me in.’’ Bishop Leonard N. Smith, in his life 
and ministry, did just that, for the ‘‘least of 
these’’, and the world is better because he 
did. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
U.S. House of Representatives to join my wife, 
Vivian, and me, along with countless others 
throughout the nation in honoring Bishop 
Leonard N. Smith for his service to God, his 
ministry, to his country, and to humankind; 
and in extending our deepest condolences to 
Dr. Smith’s family, friends, loved ones, and all 
those who mourn his loss. We pray that they 
will be consoled and comforted by an abiding 
faith and the Holy Spirit in the days, weeks, 
and months ahead.

IN HONOR OF MARKET STREET

FOR 
RECEIVING 
THE 
2021 CABARRUS REGIONAL CHAM-
BER OF COMMERCE COMMUNITY 
IMPACT AWARD 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 3, 2022 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and congratulate Market Street Stu-
dios for receiving the Cabarrus Regional 
Chamber of Commerce Community Impact 
Award. 
Market Street Studios has worked diligently 
to document many of Cabarrus County’s im-
portant and historical events and milestones. 
In doing so, they have exerted sincere efforts 
to positively portray our community in order to 
uplift all those who experience their work. 
Market Street Studios has captured some of 
the most significant moments in Cabarrus 
County’s recent history. They organized the 
reveal of the local minor-league baseball 
team’s new identity and documented the gath-
ering in support of frontline healthcare workers 
at Atrium Health Cabarrus at the beginning of 
the COVID–19 pandemic. Market Street Stu-
dios’ work has also provided integral support 
to nonprofit organizations in our community. In 
response to much adversity brought on by the 
pandemic, 
they 
implemented 
video 
and 
livestream services that nonprofits could em-
ploy for fundraising efforts. Market Street Stu-
dios also took initiative to create a documen-
tary series to showcase the good work of local 
and small business, create public awareness 
for the many issues brought on by the pan-
demic, and reveal how businesses are adapt-
ing to cope with such issues. Through these 
initiatives, Market Street Studios has sup-
ported 
the 
Cabarrus 
Arts 
Council, 
the 
Cabarrus Regional Chamber of Commerce, 
the Mental Health Alliance, the Three Rivers 
Land Trust and many other local organiza-
tions. 
Market Street Studios exemplifies the high-
est level of commitment to our community and 
serves as a model for all other businesses to 
follow. I speak for all in our community in 
wishing Market Street Studios success and 
prosperity as they continue to affect positive 
change through excellent leadership and serv-
ice. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in 
congratulating Market Street Studios on re-
ceiving the 2021 Cabarrus Regional Chamber 
of Commerce Community Impact Award.

HONORING MARY CHAPMAN AS 
IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 3, 2022 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Mary Chapman, a tireless advocate 
for economic, social, and racial justice who is 
working to close the opportunity gap for youth 
between the ages of 16 to 24. 
Dr. Chapman serves on various community 
and civic boards including Bankers Trust Advi-
sory Board, Iowa Corrections Board, Des 
Moines Branch NAACP Executive Committee 
(Women in NAACP Chair), Des Moines Public 
Arts Foundation, Des Moines Art Festival, 
Hoyt Sherman Foundation, and Urban Dreams 
Board. She also is a member of Des Moines 
Chapter of The Links, Inc. and a life member 
of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc. 
Among the many awards she has received, 
Dr. Chapman is an Iowa African American Hall 
of Fame inductee, a 2013 inductee in the Iowa 
Women’s Hall of Fame, and a Des Moines 
Business Record Woman of Influence award-
ee. The Iowa Department of Corrections has 
also named the Mary Chapman Computer Lab 
in the education center at the Iowa Correc-
tional Institution for Women in honor of her. 
Community leaders like Dr. Chapman make 
Iowa a great place to live, and I share her 
goal of making Iowa a more equitable and just 
place to live. I will continue that fight in Con-
gress and always support advocates like Dr. 
Chapman and organizations like the NAACP. 
It is my pleasure to name Dr. Mary Chapman 
as Iowan of the Week.

RECOGNIZING JOSH RICHMAN 
HON. ERIC SWALWELL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 3, 2022 
Mr. SWALWELL. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize the public service of Josh Richman, 
an invaluable member of my district team for 
the past six years, as he moves on to his next 
professional endeavor. Josh joined my office 
in January 2016 after working nearly 24 years 
as a reporter in Pennsylvania and the San 
Francisco Bay Area. Immediately prior to join-
ing our office, he was the senior political re-
porter for the Bay Area News Group, which in-
cludes the Oakland Tribune and the East Bay 
Times. Josh began his work with our office as 
Communications Director and was promoted 
to Deputy Chief of Staff and Senior Advisor. 
I first met Josh when he covered local Tri- 
Valley politics and I served as a Dublin city 
councilmember. In September 2012, I an-
nounced a long-shot run for Congress against 
a 40-year incumbent from my own party. 
About 30 people (including family members) 
showed up for the announcement, and only 
one reporter, Josh. Though Josh told me 
throughout the campaign that I didn’t have a 
chance, I admired how he fairly covered the 
race. And I personally resolved that if I could 
ever hire him, I would. 
Josh made an impact on my office imme-
diately. He brought a fresh perspective to 
issues and cultivated strong relationships with 
constituents and the media alike. His history in 
journalism helped tremendously when it came 
to working with the media and developing rela-
tionships with reporters, bills we introduced, or 
events we were holding back home. It is un-
usual for a communications director to be 
based in the district, but in our case, he was 
essential. Josh had an inherent understanding 
of the local media landscape, was a keen pho-
tographer, and could provide vital feedback. 
I could always count on Josh for an honest, 
unfiltered, and well-reasoned opinion. Each 
one of us needs at least one trusted person 
that won’t always say, ‘‘yes.’’ Those people 
make us grow and become better. Josh was 
one of those people and he’s made it clear he 
will still play that role, even while outside the 
office. 
Josh was also an invaluable mentor to 
many on our staff, particularly the many com-
munications aides who worked under him. 
Many of those aides have gone on, with the 
benefit of Josh’s experience, to become com-
munications directors themselves. Josh also 
had an intimate understanding of the work his 
colleagues did and could recognize the mo-
ments that they felt overwhelmed. At those 
times he took it upon himself to infuse levity, 
joy, and acts of genuine appreciation for his 
colleagues into the work day. He saw the 
value in maintaining a workplace that was as 
happy as it was productive, and he did all he 
could to create that environment. 
I’d like to thank Josh’s wife, Natalie, and 
son, Jack, for allowing me to borrow so much 
time that they may have otherwise spent to-
gether. I also thank Josh for his time, his ex-
pertise, his counsel, and his friendship. I wish 
him good luck in this next endeavor and know 
that this isn’t the last he’ll hear from me.

THE 2021 CABARRUS REGIONAL 
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE NEW 
BUSINESS OF THE YEAR AWARD

OF NORTH CAROLINA

Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and congratulate Tastebuds Popcorn 
Concord for receiving the Cabarrus Regional 
Chamber of Commerce New Business of the 
Year Award. 
Tastebuds Popcorn Concord has quickly be-
come a local favorite. In just over a year, they 
have established themselves as a popular 
vendor of over 200 flavors of popcorn and 
gone above and beyond to provide invaluable 
support to our community. 
Tastebuds Popcorn Concord is a veteran- 
owned, minority-owned, and woman-owned 
business that has already made significant 
partnerships and connections to spur eco-
nomic growth in Cabarrus County. Their col-
laboration with other businesses seeks to rec-
ognize and address many public needs in our 
community. Among many other partnerships 
and initiatives, Tastebuds Popcorn Concord 
worked with the Cabarrus County Convention 
and Visitor’s Bureau to assist with NASCAR’s 
2021 Drive for the Cure 250 and partnered 
with law enforcement to advance safety initia-
tives and community relations. Tastebuds 
Popcorn Concord has also sponsored multiple 
public high school sports teams and the 
Teacher’s Resource, a nonprofit that provides 
support to teachers in multiple cities nation-
wide. I join the rest of our community in thank-
ing Tastebuds Popcorn Concord for their con-
tributions to our local economy and dedicated 
charitable services. 
Tastebuds Popcorn Concord has achieved 
swift and impactful success and is truly de-
serving of this award. I wish its management 
and employees success as they continue to 
provide excellent service to our community. I 
personally look forward to my next visit when 
I’m back home in Concord. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in 
congratulating Tastebuds Popcorn Concord on 
receiving the 2021 Cabarrus Regional Cham-
ber of Commerce New Business of the Year 
Award.

INTRODUCTION OF THE FEDERAL 
EMPLOYEE 
SHORT-TERM 
DIS-
ABILITY INSURANCE ACT OF 2022 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 3, 2022 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the Federal Employee Short-Term 
Disability Insurance Act of 2022, which would 
help provide financial relief for federal employ-
ees who have a short-term injury or disability, 
become pregnant or develop a pregnancy-re-
lated illness. This bill would offer federal em-
ployees short-term disability insurance at no 
cost to the federal government. Employees 
would be responsible for 100 percent of the 
premiums and be able to receive disability in-
surance benefits for up to one year, which 
would replace a portion of their lost income 
due to a non-work-related injury or illness or 
pregnancy. This bill is more important now 
than ever with the prevalence of so-called 
‘‘Long COVID.’’ 
I decided to investigate how we could pro-
vide short-term disability insurance for federal 
employees after learning that many of them al-
ready buy short-term disability insurance as in-
dividuals in the private market at high indi-
vidual rates. Although federal employees have 
good health insurance, federal health benefits 
do not replace lost income if employees are 
unable to work. Moreover, while federal em-
ployees may have available sick or annual 
leave days, they may not have enough such 
days to pay the bills if they have to be out of 
work for an extended period, such as following 
surgery. Although there are long-term disability 
options for federal employees who become 
permanently disabled, federal employees do 
not qualify for such benefits until they have 
worked for the federal government for at least 
18 months. My bill does no more than put fed-
eral employees in the same position as many 
of their private-sector counterparts, who often 
have access to disability insurance through an 
employer at group rates, an option unavailable 
to federal employees. This bill would not allow 
participating insurance companies to exclude 
persons based on preexisting conditions. Be-
cause of the federal government’s purchasing 
power, this bill would provide these benefits at 
a more competitive rate than is available for 
employees purchasing as individuals, as many

do. Under this bill, the Director of the Office of 
Personnel Management would contract with 
private carriers to provide this coverage, es-
sentially providing the equivalent of group cov-
erage available to workers in the private sec-
tor. 
According to the Social Security Administra-
tion, a 20-year-old worker has a one-in-four 
chance of becoming disabled by retirement 
age. The majority of disabilities are not caused 
by major accidents, but by injuries or illnesses, 
such as back injuries or cancer, according to 
the Council for Disability Awareness. There is 
every reason to allow our federal employees 
to take advantage of the federal government’s 
purchasing power to obtain the most reason-
able price if they choose to purchase short- 
term disability coverage on their own, at no 
cost to the federal government. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to support this 
bill.

INTRODUCTION OF H.R. 6774, THE 
BOXING THERAPHY FOR PARKIN-

HON. BRIAN HIGGINS

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 3, 2022 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speak-

cess to effective therapies for Parkinson’s dis-
ease for our veterans. The Department of Vet-
erans Affairs estimates that 110,000 veterans 
have been diagnosed with Parkinson’s dis-
ease. While the exact causes of Parkinson’s 
are unknown, many veterans developed the 
disease after exposure to Agent Orange and 
other chemicals while serving our Nation. 
PD is a lifelong and progressive disease for 
which there is no cure, and frustratingly little 
progress has been made in recent decades in 
the race to find new effective treatments for 
Parkinson’s. The most powerful and common 
drug for Parkinson’s, levodopa, was developed 
in the 1960s. 
But one of the strongest tools we have to 
fight Parkinson’s isn’t a drug, it’s exercise. Ex-
ercise can help manage, slow, or even pre-
vent the progression of Parkinson’s symptoms, 
and help PD patients stay active and avoid 
isolation in their communities. While many 
types of exercise have shown to be beneficial 
for PD patients, boxing has become an in-
creasingly popular exercise for improving the 
physical, mental, and emotional health of 
those with PD, and more and more gyms are 
offering boxing programs specifically for those 
diagnosed with it. One such gym in my district, 
Parkinson’s Boxing in Kenmore, New York, is 
dedicated solely to helping those with PD and 
similar disorders. 
But for many veterans with PD, these kinds 
of programs remain financially out ofreach. We 
owe it to our veterans and active-duty service 
members to provide resources for them when 
dealing with the detrimental effects of toxic 
substances and degenerative diseases like 
PD. That is why I have introduced a bill, H.R. 
6774, the Boxing Therapy for Parkinson’s Ac-
cess Act, ’that would require the VA to cover 
boxing exercise classes for veterans who have 
been diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease or 
similar movement disorders. Madam Speaker, 
I am grateful for the opportunity to highlight 
this issue and how we can better help our vet-
erans access the therapies that we know can 
make a difference in their fight against Parkin-
son’s disease.

Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today

Chamber of Commerce Small Business of the 
Year Award.

regions, CK Select Real Estate has since ex-
panded to cover much of the Piedmont-Triad

CK Select Real Estate has thoroughly prov-
en to be a trusted source for real estate en-
deavors. They provide exemplary customer 
service by employing collaborative and inclu-
sive negotiating practices to benefit their cli-
ents. Although strained by the COVID–19 pan-
demic, CK Select Real Estate’s staunch dedi-
cation to their clients did not waver as they 
adapted to the challenging circumstances by 
adopting new safety protocols to accommo-
date in-person services. Additionally, CK Se-
lect 
Real

has 
pursued 
multiple 
serviceoriented projects to address public 
needs in our community. To list just a few ex-
amples, they funded the construction of a 
blessing box in Kannapolis to provide food to 
needy families and raised funds for Purple 
Heart Homes, a nonprofit that assists service- 
connected disabled and aging veterans find 
adequate housing. 
CK Select Real Estate is truly deserving of 
this award on account of their impactful con-
tributions to our local economy and dedicated

community in thanking CK Select Real Estate 
for their committed service and wishing them 
continued success going forward.

IN RECOGNITION OF PASTOR JOHN 
WOODEN 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 3, 2022 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, it 
is my honor and pleasure to extend my per-
sonal congratulations and best wishes to an 
exceptional community leader, an outstanding 
educator, and a devoted man of God, Pastor 
John Wooden, on the occasion of his retire-
ment. A retirement service will be held on 
Sunday, March 6, 2022, at 11 a.m. 
Pastor John Wooden was born in Bain-
bridge, Georgia on May 7, 1966, to the union 
of Mr. Arthur Dean Wooden and Mrs. Willie 
Mae Wooden. After receiving his Associate 
degree from Bainbridge Junior College, Pastor 
Wooden went on to receive dual Bachelor’s 
degrees in Marketing and Management from 
Valdosta State College; an educational certifi-
cate from Albany State University; a Master of 
Science degree in Leadership and an Edu-
cational Specialist degree from Nova South-
eastern University; and completed religious 
training from New Orleans Baptist Theological 
Seminary. 
As a staunch advocate for educating the 
next generation, Pastor Wooden served as an 
educator and school administrator for thirty 
years, serving as a Business Education teach-
er, Career Counselor, Assistant Principal at 
the Elementary, Middle, and High School lev-
els, Middle School Principal, and as an Assist-
ant Superintendent for schools in Decatur 
County, Georgia. 
In addition to a three-decade career in pub-
lic education, Pastor Wooden has also spent 
almost four decades teaching the word of the 
Lord. Pastor Wooden has been preaching for 
38 years and pastoring for 35 years, first at 
First Mt. Pilgrim Missionary Baptist Church 
from 1987 to 1990, and then at St. Paul Mis-
sionary Baptist Church from March 1987 until 
his retirement this year. 
Pastor Wooden’s distinguished pastoral ca-
reer has been mirrored by his extensive in-
volvement in his community. In conjunction 
with his professional accomplishments, Pastor 
Wooden has served his community as a board 
member of the United Way, Salvation Army, 
and the YMCA as well as a member of 
Kiwanis Club (Bainbridge) and the Rotary Club 
(Bainbridge). 
In addition to being a stellar educator, a dis-
tinguished spiritual leader, and dedicated com-
munity advocate, Pastor Wooden is also a 
published author. His literary works include 
‘‘Uncensored Conversations’’, ‘‘Leading While 
Bleeding’’, ‘‘Don’t Judge Me Unless You Have 
Walked In My Shoes’’, ‘‘Scarred, But Not Per-
manently Broken’’, and ‘‘Don’t Live A Life Of 
Regrets’’. 
He has accomplished much throughout his 
life, but none of this would be possible without 
the grace of God and the inspiration, love, and 
support of his wife, Deborah; and his children, 
LaShannon and Chelsea. 
Dr. Benjamin E. Mays often said: ‘‘You 
make your living by what you get; you make 
your life by what you give.’’ Bainbridge and 
Decatur County, Georgia are better because 
of Pastor John Wooden and his tireless com-
mitment to making his community stronger. As 
a man of great faith and integrity, his efforts, 
his dedication, and his expertise are unparal-
leled. But his heart for teaching and helping 
others, utilizing these qualities, has made his 
life’s work truly special. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
House of Representatives to join my wife, Viv-
ian, and me and the more than 730,000 peo-
ple in Georgia’s Second Congressional Dis-
trict, in extending our sincerest appreciation 
and best wishes to Pastor John Wooden upon 
the occasion of his retirement from an out-
standing career in the Ministry of Jesus Christ.

HONORING OUR PROMISE TO AD-
DRESS COMPREHENSIVE TOXICS 
ACT OF 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 2, 2022 
Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, as the proud 
Representative of more than 20,000 veterans 
in California’s 18th Congressional District, I 
rise in support of H.R. 3967, the Honoring Our 
PACT 
Act. 
This 
long-overdue 
legislation 
makes good on our promise to care for those 
who have risked their lives to defend our 
country. 
Today, most veterans who seek care and 
compensation from the VA for medical condi-
tions resulting from service-connected expo-
sure to toxic substances are denied because 
the VA maintains highly restrictive standards 
for what constitutes toxic exposure. For years, 
I’ve heard from veterans in my District who 
have described the great frustration of being 
denied the care and compensation they need. 
The Honoring Our PACT Act addresses this 
issue by acknowledging that toxic exposure is 
a cost of war. The bill recognizes many new 
categories of veterans as eligible for care and 
compensation for toxic exposure, including 
veterans exposed to burn pits, atomic radi-
ation, PFAS, and other dangerous substances. 
If enacted, the CBO estimates this legislation 
will increase the number of veterans receiving 
VA healthcare by 15 percent over the next 
decade. 
Importantly, H.R. 3967 finally puts into place 
a legal recourse for veterans and their families 
who were exposed to toxic chemicals in drink-
ing water at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. 
Many of these veterans suffer from cancer, 
Parkinson’s disease, and ALS as a result of 
their exposure, but they’ve been denied com-
pensation because of an anomaly in North 
Carolina state law. I’ve consistently advocated 
for remedying this injustice, and I’m pleased 
that the Honoring Our PACT Act does so by 
establishing a federal cause of action related 
to contaminated water at Camp Lejeune. 
When our country sends our brave women 
and men of the U.S. Armed Forces into 
harm’s way, it is our collective responsibility to 
provide them with the health services, oppor-
tunities, and care they’ve earned. Passing the 
Honoring Our PACT Act strengthens this sa-
cred promise, and I urge all my colleagues to 
support this bill and vote yes.

IN HONOR OF PRESENT AGE MIN-
ISTRIES 
FOR 
RECEIVING 
THE 
2021 CABARRUS REGIONAL CHAM-
BER OF COMMERCE NONPROFIT 
OF THE YEAR AWARD 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 3, 2022 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and congratulate Present Age Min-
istries for receiving the Cabarrus Regional 
Chamber of Commerce Nonprofit of the Year 
Award. 
Since 2009, Present Age Ministries has 
worked hard to fight back against and elimi-
nate sex trafficking and abuse. They have 
served as a vital resource for teen victims of 
these crimes and have undertaken many ini-
tiatives to further prepare all in our community 
to successfully assist those impacted. 
Present Age Ministries’ services have pro-
vided resources to over 50 survivors and edu-
cation and training initiatives to over 20,000 
students and adults in Cabarrus County. Both 
the City of Concord and the City of Kannapolis 
employ their services to identify and assist all 
possible teen victims of sex trafficking and 
abuse, and Cabarrus County Schools partners 
with Present Age Ministries to maintain high 
quality and up to date sex trafficking education 
programs. Present Age Ministries has thor-
oughly demonstrated their ability to adapt to 
meet victims’ needs under new and chal-
lenging circumstances. They introduced tutor-
ing resources for victims after it became ap-
parent that those seeking resources were also 
struggling to keep up with schoolwork. Sur-
vivors can now study with other survivors and 
receive aid from volunteer tutors. Furthermore, 
after being tasked with very unusual and dif-
ficult obstacles during the pandemic, Present 
Age Ministries shifted strategies by developing 
a virtual program through which teens re-
ceived activities and resources to review and 
complete prior to connecting with case work-
ers or mentors on the internet or over the 
phone. They also introduced an online portal 
to ease access to educational resources. 
Present Age Ministries is truly deserving of 
this award on account of the invaluable re-
sources they provide and their unwavering 
commitment to vulnerable members of our 
community. I join the rest of our community in 
gratitude as we acknowledge Present Age 
Ministries for such excellent service. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in 
congratulating Present Age Ministries on re-
ceiving the 2021 Cabarrus Regional Chamber 
of Commerce Nonprofit of the Year Award.
