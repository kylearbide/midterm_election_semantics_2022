Vol. 168 
WASHINGTON, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 7, 2022 
No. 24 
House of Representatives 
The House met at noon and was 
called to order by the Speaker pro tem-
pore (Mr. BROWN of Maryland). 
f 
DESIGNATION OF SPEAKER PRO 
TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC, 
February 7, 2022. 
I hereby appoint the Honorable ANTHONY 
G. BROWN to act as Speaker pro tempore on 
this day. 
NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House of Representatives. 
f 
MORNING-HOUR DEBATE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the order of the House of Janu-
ary 10, 2022, the Chair will now recog-
nize Members from lists submitted by 
the majority and minority leaders for 
morning-hour debate. 
The Chair will alternate recognition 
between the parties, with time equally 
allocated between the parties and each 
Member other than the majority and 
minority leaders and the minority 
whip limited to 5 minutes, but in no 
event shall debate continue beyond 1:50 
p.m. 
f 
CONGRESS MUST END THE 
FENTANYL CRISIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Wisconsin (Mr. STEIL) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. STEIL. Mr. Speaker, 64,000 Amer-
icans 
died 
from 
fentanyl 
and 
its 
analogs in a recent 12-month period. It 
is the leading cause of death in the 
United States for individuals aged 18 to 
45. Fentanyl has killed more people 
aged 18 to 45 than car accidents, than 
suicide, than COVID. Again, it killed 
64,000 Americans in a 12-month period. 
I recently spoke to two parents who 
lost a child to fentanyl. 
Congress must act. 
What 
is 
fentanyl? 
Fentanyl 
and 
fentanyl analogs are synthetic opioids 
that have a real risk of abuse and de-
pendence. It is an unusually dangerous 
and an unusually deadly drug, and 
many of the victims are not even aware 
they are taking it. 
Where are the drugs coming from? 
This drug is often manufactured in 
high quantities in China and is pouring 
across our southern border. And it is 
getting worse. 
Last year, fentanyl seizures across 
our southern border increased by over 
1,000 percent. Border agents captured 
588 pounds of this drug. To concep-
tualize that, that is enough to kill 133 
million Americans. 
I have been to the southern border, 
and I have spoken firsthand to the men 
and women of Border Protection about 
the increased drugs coming across our 
southern border. 
We must secure our border. We can-
not stand by and watch as Americans 
are killed by fentanyl and its analogs. 
We should continue to be focused on 
limiting the flow of fentanyl coming 
into our country. We should be raising 
awareness of the lethal effects of 
fentanyl. We should be helping local 
law enforcement and our first respond-
ers work to address this crisis. 
In 11 days, fentanyl analogs and re-
lated substances will no longer be a 
schedule I drug. The fentanyl analogs 
schedule I status expires on February 
18, in 11 days. 
Congress previously kicked the can 
down the road and temporarily ex-
tended fentanyl analogs as a schedule I 
drug last May, but that expires in 11 
days. 
If fentanyl analogs are not extended 
or made permanent soon, law enforce-
ment officers will have a hand tied be-
hind their back from stopping fentanyl 
from killing Americans. 
Yet Speaker PELOSI
continues to 
refuse to bring the HALT Act, critical 
legislation, to this floor to make sched-
uling permanent. We need to make 
scheduling fentanyl analogs perma-
nent. 
I call upon my fellow Members of 
Congress to help us end the fentanyl 
crisis. 
f 
RUNAWAY INFLATION IS HURTING 
EVERY HOUSEHOLD IN AMERICA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Minnesota (Mr. EMMER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to once again address the crisis 
hurting every household in America: 
runaway inflation. 
The 
January 
12 
Consumer 
Price 
Index report showed inflation has in-
creased 7 percent over the last 12 
months, the fastest increase since 1982. 
Rural communities are being hit 
harder than anyone else. In my dis-
trict, inflation has increased 8 percent 
over the past year. Americans are pay-
ing more for essentials everywhere, 
from the grocery store to the gas sta-
tion, and working families are being 
hit the hardest. 
Like many of my colleagues, I be-
lieve the primary driver of this infla-
tion is unchecked government spend-
ing. Unfortunately, even though infla-
tion has reached historic highs, this 
issue continues to be ignored by many 
of my Democrat colleagues. 
Whether you agree with me or not, 
we owe it to the American people to 
identify the root cause and begin to ad-
dress the problem. I have introduced 
legislation to do just that, and I hope 
all of my colleagues will join me in 
supporting efforts that put an end to 
this ongoing problem that harms every 
single American, especially those liv-
ing paycheck to paycheck and trying 
to raise a family.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H980 
February 7, 2022 
Dan Szykulski. In January, Dan re-
tired as deputy chief of the Blaine Po-
lice Department. 
Dan served with the Blaine Police 
Department for 38 years. During that 
time, he saw many changes in the city 
and his department. 
Deputy Chief Szykulski had the re-
spect and admiration of his fellow offi-
cers. Often described as a hard worker 
and team player, Dan was always there 
to lend a hand on emergency calls or 
bring in home-cooked meals for officers 
working on holidays. 
Dan earned numerous awards during 
his career, including the Chief’s Com-
passion Award and a Certificate of Rec-
ognition from the city of Blaine. I 
should note, however, that possibly my 
favorite thing about Dan was his rep-
utation as the best hockey player in 
the station. He will certainly be missed 
at the annual Guns and Hoses hockey 
game. Maybe he will be able to return 
with an alumni exception. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Dan thank for 
his service, and I congratulate him on 
his retirement. 
RECOGNIZING DR. RICHARD LEE 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the career of Dr. 
Richard Lee. Dr. Lee is retiring as ex-
ecutive director of the Central Min-
nesota Mental Health Center. 
Dr. Lee has led the center for the 
past 6 years. In that time, Dr. Lee has 
been a champion for expanding mental 
health resources in central Minnesota. 
I have had the privilege to work with 
Dr. Lee and have been fortunate to 
visit the Central Minnesota Mental 
Health Center to see the great work 
they do. 
Under Dr. Lee’s leadership, the Cen-
tral Minnesota Mental Health Center 
cultivated and expanded strong com-
munity partnerships with local coun-
ties, law enforcement, and healthcare 
agencies. Dr. Lee also helped develop 
and expand the Co-Responder Program 
that partners mental health profes-
sionals with law enforcement officers 
to respond to behavioral health calls. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. Lee for the 
incredible impact he has had on ex-
panding access and availability of men-
tal health care in central Minnesota 
and wish him an enjoyable and well-de-
served retirement. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF GREGORY ‘‘BUTCH’’ 
BAKEBERG 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Gregory 
‘‘Butch’’ Bakeberg, a constituent, a 
friend, and a leader in Minnesota’s ag-
riculture community. 
Butch passed away last month at the 
age of 74, but his legacy and work for 
the Sixth District and the city of Wa-
verly, Minnesota, will continue to have 
an impact. 
Butch was born in Minneapolis, Min-
nesota, but moved to Waverly where 
his 
family 
owned 
and 
operated 
Goldview Farm. Butch and his wife, 
Faye, were active in their community 
for decades, getting involved with the 
Wright County American Dairy Asso-
ciation and helping start the Wright 
County Breakfast on the Farm Com-
mittee. Butch and Faye were known to 
host 
countless 
agricultural-related 
events on their farm with the goal of 
educating fellow Minnesotans on dairy 
farming. They also host the occasional 
Sunday mass on the family farm as 
well. 
Last year, I had an opportunity to 
visit Butch on his family’s farm, and I 
am glad I did. Butch and Faye truly 
represent the best of Minnesota, and 
while we mourn the loss of a leader in 
our community, Butch’s contribution 
to our community will live on for years 
to come. 
REMEMBERING LORAL I. DELANEY 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Loral I. 
Delaney. Loral I passed away on Sep-
tember 19, 2021, after battling breast 
cancer. 
Loral I was a shooting-sports legend. 
In 1957, at the age of 19, Loral I com-
peted in her first event, the Minnesota 
State Trap Shoot, which she won with 
a near-perfect score. Loral I would go 
on to win seven Grand American World 
Trapshooting Championships, five of 
them consecutively. Loral I remains 
the only woman to win more than two 
championships in a row and more than 
four in total. 
Loral I not only loved to compete, 
but she had an incredible passion for 
animals, as well. She and her husband, 
Chuck, ran Armstrong Ranch Kennels 
in 
Ramsey, 
Minnesota, 
providing 
grooming and training for some of Min-
nesota’s premier hunting dogs. Loral I 
also founded an event known as Game 
Fair, an annual event known and be-
loved by sportsmen and -women and 
hunting enthusiasts throughout Min-
nesota and beyond. 
Loral I leaves a tremendous legacy 
behind her; she will be missed dearly. 
To Chuck and her family, we offer our 
sincere condolences. 
f 
HONORING PRESIDENT ABRAHAM 
LINCOLN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Indiana (Mr. BUCSHON) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Speaker, I grew 
up about 20 miles from Springfield, Illi-
nois, and President Lincoln’s boyhood 
home is in my congressional district in 
Spencer County, Indiana. President 
Lincoln’s birthday is this Saturday, 
February 12, so I want to highlight 
some of his speeches and recognize the 
enduring importance of his words. 
First is his farewell speech to Spring-
field delivered February 11, 1861: ‘‘My 
friends, no one, not in my situation, 
can appreciate my feeling of sadness at 
this parting. To this place, and the 
kindness of these people, I owe every-
thing. 
‘‘Here I have lived a quarter of a cen-
tury and have passed from a young to 
an old man. Here my children have 
been born and one is buried. 
‘‘I now leave, not knowing when, or 
whether ever, I may return, with a task 
before me greater than that which rest-
ed upon Washington. 
‘‘Without the assistance of the Di-
vine Being, who ever attended him, I 
cannot succeed. 
‘‘With that assistance, I cannot fail. 
Trusting in Him who can go with me, 
and remain with you, and be every-
where for good, let us confidently hope 
that all will yet be well. 
‘‘To His care commending you, as I 
hope in your prayers you will commend 
me, I bid you an affectionate farewell.’’ 
Notice the importance of faith to 
President 
Lincoln 
in 
his 
farewell 
speech to Springfield. I do believe the 
loss of faith amongst elected officials 
has been detrimental to our country. It 
seems that we go out of our way to 
eliminate any mention of faith in pub-
lic life. This is a mistake. 
Next, Mr. Speaker, President Lin-
coln’s address at Independence Hall 
February 22, 1861, on George Washing-
ton’s birthday: ‘‘I am filled with deep 
emotion at finding myself standing 
here, in this place, where were col-
lected together the wisdom, the patri-
otism, the devotion to principle from 
which sprang the institutions under 
which we live. 
‘‘You have kindly suggested to me 
that in my hands is the task of restor-
ing peace to the present distracted con-
dition of the country. I can say in re-
turn, Sir, that all the political senti-
ments I entertain have been drawn, so 
far as I have been able to draw them, 
from the sentiments which originated 
and were given to the world from this 
hall. 
‘‘I have never had a feeling politi-
cally that did not spring from the sen-
timents embodied in the Declaration of 
Independence. I have often pondered 
over the dangers which were incurred 
by the men who assembled here and 
framed and adopted that Declaration of 
Independence. 
‘‘I have pondered over the toils that 
were endured by the officers and sol-
diers of the army who achieved that 
Independence. 
‘‘I have often inquired of myself, 
what great principle or idea it was that 
kept this Confederacy so long together. 
‘‘It was not the mere matter of the 
separation of the Colonies from the 
motherland; but that sentiment in the 
Declaration 
of 
Independence 
which 
gave liberty, not alone to the people of 
this country, but, I hope, to the world 
for all future time. 
‘‘It was that which gave promise that 
in due time the weight would be lifted 
from the shoulders of all men. This is a 
sentiment embodied in that Declara-
tion of Independence. 
‘‘Now, my friends, can this country 
be saved upon that basis? If it can, I 
will 
consider 
myself 
one 
of 
the 
happiest men in the world, if I can help 
to save it. If it cannot be saved upon 
that principle, it will be truly awful. 
‘‘But, if this country cannot be saved 
without giving up that principle, I was 
about to say I would rather be assas-
sinated on this spot than to surrender 
it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H981 
February 7, 2022 
‘‘Now, in my view of the present as-
pect of affairs, there need be no blood-
shed and war. There is no necessity for 
it. I am not in favor of such a course, 
and I may say, in advance, that there 
will be no bloodshed unless it be forced 
upon the Government, and then it will 
be compelled to act in self-defense. 
‘‘My friends, this is wholly an unex-
pected speech, and I did not expect to 
be called upon to say a word when I 
came here. I supposed it was merely to 
do something toward raising the flag. I 
may, therefore, have said something 
indiscreet. I have said nothing but 
what I am willing to live by, and, if it 
be the pleasure of Almighty God, die 
by.’’ 
It is impossible to compare any situ-
ation we, as a Nation, are in today with 
a battle between families, brothers, sis-
ters, and Americans that was the 
American Civil War. I am not attempt-
ing today in any way to do so. With 
that being said, the words of President 
Lincoln in his second inaugural ad-
dress, which I am about ready to read, 
is an inspiration, I think, and should be 
to all of us. 
‘‘With malice toward none with char-
ity for all with firmness in the right as 
God gives us to see the right let us 
strive on to finish the work we are in 
to bind up the Nation’s wounds, to care 
for him who shall have borne the battle 
and for his widow and his orphan, to do 
all which may achieve and cherish just 
and lasting peace amongst ourselves 
and all nations.’’

b 1215 
TRIBUTE TO DR. EILEEN LANGDON 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. ROUZER) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of Dr. Eileen 
Langdon of Johnston County, North 
Carolina. Following more than 30 years 
working as a distinguished veteri-
narian at Willowrun Veterinary Hos-
pital in Smithfield, Dr. Langdon is re-
tiring. 
In the words of Dr. Langdon, she 
‘‘felt called to serve the ones in our 
world who seemingly have no voice. 
The ones who need an advocate.’’ As a 
devoted Christian, God’s plan led her to 
Auburn University where she received 
her degree in veterinary medicine in 
1986. 
She joined the Willowrun Veterinary 
family and healthcare team as an asso-
ciate veterinarian in 1990 and became a 
partner at the practice in 2007. Dr. 
Langdon is cherished by her colleagues. 
Her many years of hard work and ex-
pertise, without a doubt, have built a 
lasting legacy of exceptional service, 
as well as mentorship to other women 
in the profession that will provide a 
lasting influence. 
Though she will be retiring from 
Willowrun with a tremendous record of 
achievement, she will be moving on to 
do what she loves, working full-time on 
the family farm with her husband and 
three children. The Langdon family 
farm is a third generation farm in the 
McGees Crossroads community—a fam-
ily I know quite well—not all that far 
from my own family’s farm. Like all of 
our 
wonderful 
farm 
families, 
pre-
serving natural resources is always 
their top priority as they grow crops 
and livestock. 
In addition to her veterinarian career 
and working on the family farm, Dr. 
Langdon served for 10 years as a mem-
ber of the Johnston County Board of 
Health. She has been an active church 
member, and she has received recogni-
tion as a Paul Harris Fellow through 
the Rotary Club of Central Johnston 
County for her years of service to the 
community. Dr. Langdon and her hus-
band are also inducted members of the 
Johnston County Agricultural Hall of 
Fame. 
I commend and thank Dr. Langdon 
for her many years of service to our 
community, State, and country. May 
God continue to bless her path and that 
of the Langdon family. 
TRIBUTE TO THE HONORABLE CRAIG OLIVE 
Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to pay special tribute to my 
friend, Craig Olive, who has served as 
Johnston County Register of Deeds 
since December 2002. 
Craig found a love for politics at an 
early age, and he assisted many local 
and statewide candidates by putting up 
signs as a young boy. During his in-
volvement as a volunteer for the John-
ston County Republican Party, he 
helped bring rise to the Republican 
Party in Johnston County in eastern 
North Carolina. 
Beyond politics and his own service 
as register of deeds, he has served his 
community in a variety of ways and he 
continues to do so. He is a past member 
of the Board of Advisors for the Paul A. 
Johnston Auditorium and Johnston 
Community College, a past member of 
the Capital Campaign for the Johnston 
County Heritage Center Community, 
and a past member of the Johnston 
County Tourism Board—just to name a 
few. 
He also helped spearhead an annual 
ceremony remembering those who have 
lost their lives to dementia and hon-
oring those currently living with de-
mentia as well as their caregivers. 
Even long before these contributions 
and his election to office, Craig was 
awarded the Long Leaf Pine, an award 
that is bestowed on North Carolinians, 
the highest civilian honor the State 
bestows. 
During his tenure as Johnston Coun-
ty Register of Deeds, Craig has had tre-
mendous 
accomplishments 
imple-
menting major improvements in auto-
mation, 
technology, 
and 
customer 
service. His office was the first Reg-
ister of Deeds office in North Carolina 
to electronically record documents, 
and the first office in the Nation to 
electronically record a survey map. 
He has worked tirelessly to ensure 
that the county’s history is preserved 
and secure within his office while per-
forming the duties of his office under 
budget. He has returned $4.1 million to 
the county, which is a tremendous sav-
ings to Johnston County taxpayers. 
Mr. Olive also worked with me during 
my time in the North Carolina Senate 
to introduce a bill to improve identity 
theft protection. This bill became law 
in 2009 and was a direct result of his 
great efforts. 
In 2016, Craig implemented a Thank 
A Vet program to assist veterans by 
providing them with an ID. An added 
benefit of this program is that it allows 
for better safekeeping of veterans’ 
military discharge papers. 
Since the beginning of the COVID–19 
pandemic, his office has faced many 
challenges, yet he has been determined 
to remain open to assist our citizens. 
He continues to lead the way in pro-
viding the highest level of efficiency, 
productivity, innovation, and service 
to the people of Johnston County in 
North Carolina. 
Thank you, Craig, for your commit-
ment to your family, your neighbors, 
and to the citizens of Johnston County 
and beyond.

Give us this day a spirit of wisdom 
and understanding. May the eyes of our 
hearts be enlightened to the hope to 
which You call us. May our wills be

tasks You would have us do. May our 
spirits be keen to share Your love with 
all those we encounter. 
Lord, You have blessed us richly with 
a remarkable legacy. May we acknowl-
edge that glorious inheritance of faith 
with lives worthy of the mantle of re-
sponsibility You have laid upon us. 
Give us the courage to live into Your 
grace plan for us this day. We pray this 
in the strength of Your holy name.

ANOTHER HISTORIC INVESTMENT 
IN AMERICA 
(Ms. UNDERWOOD asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, last 
week, House Democrats advanced yet 
another historic investment in the 
American people, the America COM-
PETES Act. Not only will the America 
COMPETES Act strengthen our eco-
nomic and national security, it sup-
ports the production of U.S. semi-
conductors, which play a role in nearly 
every sector of our economy. 
This critical $52 billion investment in 
semiconductors will address chip short-
ages and supply chain disruptions, low-
ering car costs for consumers while 
creating good-paying jobs. I have heard 
from my neighbors how much they 
have been feeling the recent spike in 
new and used car prices and wait times, 
and this bill will help. 
The America COMPETES Act also 
makes transformational investments 
in research, authorizing a new program 
to advance accelerator technology and 
build on the work of scientists at 
Fermilab National Accelerator Facil-
ity in my district. 
I am proud to support this com-
prehensive legislation to boost Amer-
ican competitiveness and broaden eco-
nomic opportunity, and I urge my col-
leagues in the Senate to act swiftly to 
send it to President Biden’s desk. 
f 
IOWA’S INDEPENDENT BEEF 
PRODUCERS 
(Mr. FEENSTRA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. FEENSTRA. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of Iowa’s inde-
pendent beef producers amid the ongo-
ing 
DOJ 
investigations 
into 
anti-
competitive behavior by the Big Four 
Meat Packers. 
On 
Wednesday, 
JBS 
Foods, 
the 
world’s largest meat supplier, paid $52 
million to sweep their price-fixing she-
nanigans under the rug. But they can’t 
hide what we have known all along. 
These big meat packers are illegally 
distorting the market to increase their 
profits and at the expense on Iowa fam-
ily farmers. It is shameful and it is 
wrong. 
That is why we need to pass the Cat-
tle Price Discovery and Transparency 
Act to finally hold big packers ac-
countable and help Iowa’s small, inde-
pendent producers compete on a level 
playing field. That is what a free and 
fair market is all about. It is time that 
DOJ do its job and take real steps to 
hold Big Four Meat Packers account-
able. 
We have waited long enough. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF ESTEBAN 
TORRES 
(Mr. TAKANO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to pay my respects to the late, 
former Congressman Esteban Torres, a 
devoted and beloved Chicano civil 
rights champion. I knew Mr. Torres in 
the 1990s during my first campaigns for 
Congress. I was honored by his support 
of my early campaigns and benefitted 
greatly from his counsel and his good-
will. We should all find inspiration in 
his rise from very humble beginnings 
to becoming a highly respected and in-
fluential Member of Congress. Indis-
putably, Mr. Torres was a trailblazing 
Latino leader and immigration advo-
cate, who opened the space of greater 
diversity and representation in Cali-
fornia politics for all people. 
Mr. Speaker, I salute the life of a Ko-
rean war veteran, labor leader, commu-
nity development executive, diplomat, 
and Member of Congress who continued 
to make a difference in his retirement. 
To the Torres family and all those 
who have been inspired by him, I offer 
my deepest condolences.

RECOGNIZING KOLE KING 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize a young man 
from my district who is dominating 
motorcycle racing. Kole King of Bur-
lington, Iowa, recently won the Grand 
National Hooligan Championship in 
Pensacola, Florida. 
At just 25, Kole has already reached 
the top of flat-track motorcycle rac-
ing. Through 13 races during last sea-
son, he won 8 times, blowing past his 
competition. Kole has been racing 
since he was a young child and is a 
great example that if you work hard 
and do what you love, your dreams can 
come true. 
Good luck, Kole King, the now-de-
fending champion. Iowa is cheering for 
you. 
f 
STAND WITH POLICE 
(Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, right now crime throughout 
America is on the rise. One year ago, 
Democrats across our country began 
their calls to defund the police. And 
now, today, we are seeing the sad re-
ality that their words and actions have 
had deadly consequences throughout 
American communities. 
Last year, over a dozen U.S. cities set 
dismal new records for the number of 
murders that have occurred in their 
streets. What we are seeing right now 
is more drugs, more carjackings, more 
violence, and more crime. And through 
all of it, our police officers have been 
forced not only to battle this new wave 
of lawlessness, but also they have been 
fighting to keep the funding that pro-
vides the training and the equipment 
that they need to keep us safe. 
It is actually very simple to see, we 
cannot afford to defund the police. We 
cannot afford to leave our communities 
vulnerable to crime. It is time for lib-
erals to take public safety seriously. It 
is time to back the men and women in 
blue. And it is time to stand up for law 
enforcement. 
f 
FENTANYL DRUG OVERDOSES 
(Mr. WALBERG asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, each 
year, too many lives are cut short be-
cause of drug overdoses. And fentanyl 
and its analogs, most of which origi-
nate from China, are making this crisis 
even worse. 
Sadly, under the Biden administra-
tion’s porous border policies, many of 
these deadly drugs are flooding across 
the southern border and devastating 
communities across the country. We 
need to use every available resource to 
fight back, including giving law en-
forcement the flexibility to go after 
drug traffickers who flout the law. Un-
less we take action, an important 
tool—the DEA’s emergency scheduling 
order for fentanyl-related substances— 
will expire this very month. 
It is past time to make this sched-
uling classification permanent, and I 
am proud to cosponsor the HALT 
Fentanyl Act to do just that. 
Mr. Speaker, let’s pass this bill, se-
cure the border, and stem the tide of 
the growing fentanyl crisis.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF DR. PAUL BROWN 
(Mr. BALDERSON asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. BALDERSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to the life and leg-
acy of my dear friend, Dr. Paul Brown, 
past President of Zane State College, 
and a respected voice for higher edu-
cation in Ohio. I was heartbroken to 
learn of his sudden passing last week. 
Among the many accomplishments 
over his 30-year career was his work to 
modernize Zane State for better pre-
paring students for success in their ca-
reers and in life. Under his leadership, 
Zane State had over 70 percent growth 
in enrollment and record-setting job 
placement. 
It was an honor to work alongside 
Paul for so many years. I extend my 
heartfelt 
condolences 
to 
his 
wife, 
Linda, and the entire Brown family.

HONORING 
CLARENCE 
‘‘TAFFY’’ 
ABEL AND 100TH ANNIVERSARY 
OF FIRST NATIVE AMERICAN IN 
WINTER OLYMPICS 
(Mr. BERGMAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the 100th anniversary of 
the first Native American in the Win-
ter Olympics and fellow Yooper, Clar-
ence ‘‘Taffy’’ Abel. 
Taffy was born in Sault Ste. Marie, 
Michigan, on May 28, 1900, and was a 
member of the Sault Tribe of the Chip-
pewa Indians. Following his childhood 
years, he joined the U.S. National 
Hockey Team in the first Winter Olym-
pics in 1924. From there, he was se-
lected by his fellow athletes to carry 
the American flag during the opening 
ceremonies and helped the U.S. win a 
Silver Medal. 
Taffy went on to lead a successful 
professional career in the NHL with 
the New York Rangers and Chicago 
Blackhawks, resulting in two Stanley 
Cups, and was greatly respected by 
many of his peers. His accomplish-
ments significantly advanced inter-
national hockey as an institution by 
tearing down many sport and cultural 
barriers. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to join me in recognizing this 
historic anniversary and the legacy of 
Clarence ‘‘Taffy’’ Abel. 
f 
ARGENTINA’S ONE BELT, ONE 
ROAD INITIATIVE 
(Mr. GAETZ asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Speaker, while the 
Biden administration, the media, and 
many in Congress beat the drums of 
war for Ukraine, there is a far more 
significant threat to our Nation accel-
erating rapidly close to home. 
Argentina, a critical nation and 
economy in the Americas, has just 
lashed itself to the Chinese Communist 
Party by signing on to the One Belt, 
One Road Initiative. 
The cost to China was $23.7 billion, a 
mere fraction of a rounding error when 
compared to the trillions of dollars our 
country has spent trying to build de-
mocracies out of sand and blood in the 
Middle East. 
China buying influence and infra-
structure in Argentina to collaborate 
on space and nuclear energy is a direct 
challenge to the Monroe Doctrine, and 
far more significant to American secu-
rity than our latest NATO flirtation in 
the plains of Eastern Europe. 
China is a rising power. Russia is a 
declining power. Let us sharpen our 
focus so that we do not join them in 
that eventual fate.

RECOGNIZING ORION JEAN 
(Mr. ELLZEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. ELLZEY. Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to address the floor today and 
bring attention to an extraordinary 
young man from Mansfield, Texas, 
named Orion Jean. 
In 2020, Orion was selected as the Na-
tional Kindness Speech Contest Win-
ner. With the cash prize that Orion re-
ceived from the speech contest, he cre-
ated his own initiative focused on com-
munity and kindness, called Race to 
Kindness. 
His first project was Race to 500 
Toys. Orion collected and personally 
donated over 600 books to the Chil-
dren’s Medical Center of Dallas, but 
Orion did not stop there. He continued 
on with his next Race to Kindness 
project, Race to 100,000 Meals. With the 
support of local communities and non-
profit organizations, Orion fed over 
100,000 
people 
during 
Thanksgiving 
2020. 
Orion’s efforts not only reached the 
people of District 6, but with his most 
recent endeavor, Race to 500,000 Books, 
he has collected 500,000 books and is 
distributing them to Mansfield Inde-
pendent School District, Fort Worth 
Independent School District, and Dal-
las Independent School District, along 
with several literacy organizations. 
Just when you think this young man 
could not get any more impressive, he 
is also a published author with his 
debut book, ‘‘A Kids Book About Lead-
ership,’’ which encourages children to 
discover the power of leadership that 
resides within themselves. 
He has appeared on Good Morning 
America and The Ellen Show, where he 
received a $10,000 donation for Race to 
Kindness. And right now, Orion is a 
Top 5 finalist for Time’s Kid of the 
Year 2021. 
Orion’s goal is to pull kindness to the 
forefront and show the true power of 
community and how those two quali-
ties can change people’s lives. We 
should all strive to be more like Orion 
Jean.

MASKING CHILDREN IS CHILD 
ABUSE 
(Mrs. GREENE of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I would like to talk about how chil-
dren feel about masks. 
You see, while they are watching tel-
evision, 
seeing 
Super 
Bowl 
games 
where adults are filling stadiums with-
out masks and enjoying themselves, 
and while they see concerts happen, 
they see people go to work, they see 
adults going many places all over this 
country 
without 
masks, 
they 
are 
forced to wear a mask every single day 
at school, and it is wrong. Actually, it 
is child abuse. 
Now, I know that sounds like strong 
words, but it really is because children 
are not at risk of COVID–19. As a mat-
ter of fact, children are at the lowest 
risk. 
Do you know what is harmful to chil-
dren? Having their faces covered all 
day long at school, not being able to 
see each other’s faces; not being able to 
see their teachers’ faces; and not being 
able to learn properly speech, emo-
tions, having that connection, seeing 
each other’s faces, and learning from 
adults seeing each other’s faces. 
Now, while Democrats are going on 
with the mask for thee and not for me, 
kids have had enough. And they are 
going to be future voters. They are sick 
and tired of being forced to wear a 
mask. It needs to end. Masking chil-
dren is child abuse.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
sert extraneous material on H.R. 4445. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself 3 minutes. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 4445, the End-
ing Forced Arbitration of Sexual As-
sault and Sexual Harassment Act, 
would restore access to justice for sur-
vivors of sexual assault or sexual har-
assment who are forced to settle their 
disputes against their harassers and 
abusers in a private system of arbitra-
tion that is often stacked against 
them. 
Arbitration was originally developed 
as an alternative to the court system 
for parties of relatively equal bar-
gaining power to enter into volun-
tarily. In recent decades, however, 
forced arbitration clauses have become 
ubiquitous in our lives, largely in the 
form of take-it-or-leave-it contracts 
between very large companies and indi-
vidual consumers. As a result, these 
clauses have rendered our court sys-
tem, in which plaintiffs have far 
stronger protections, inaccessible to 
far too many. 
Nowhere is that trend more apparent 
or problematic than in the workplace. 
It is projected that, by 2024, 80 percent 
of private-sector workers will be forced 
to sign an arbitration clause when ac-
cepting 
employment. 
And 
consider 
that, over the past 5 years, employers 
prevailed over their employees in 98 
percent of these arbitration cases. But 
these numbers cannot capture the true 
human toll of forced arbitration. 
Last November, the Judiciary Com-
mittee heard powerful testimony from 
four survivors of sexual assault and 
sexual 
harassment 
about 
their 
harrowing experiences and the deep 
wounds they continue to carry with 
them to this day. It was a hearing none 
of us will forget, and we appreciate 
these brave women coming forward and 
sharing their stories. 
Each of these women was subject to 
horrific treatment by a person with 
power over their lives. Then, when they 
sought to hold their assailants ac-
countable in court, they were forced to 
relive the trauma of their harassment 
and assault to find that their only re-
course was a secretive arbitration proc-
ess that was stacked against them. 
Forced arbitration clauses, buried 
deep in the fine print of the paperwork 
required as a condition of employment, 
have bound workers to a system in 
which they are nearly guaranteed to 
fail, foreclosed the possibility of ever 
having their day in court, and in al-
most every case taken away their right 
even to discuss their experience. 
The company gets to pick the judge 
and the jury, truncate the discovery 
process, choose the law applied, and

prevent all appeals. When the company 
wins, it can request that the victim 
pay its attorney’s fees, and it can en-
sure that misconduct never sees the 
light of day. 
H.R. 4445 removes these barriers to 
justice for survivors of sexual assault 
or sexual harassment by giving them a 
real choice of whether to go to court or 
to arbitrate their claim. 
In doing so, this legislation ends this 
unjust and, frankly, repulsive system 
in which American companies are bet-
ter off retaliating against victims of 
sexual assault than taking responsi-
bility and holding perpetrators respon-
sible for their horrific actions. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD a letter to Members of Con-
gress dated February 4, 2022, and a let-
ter to House leadership dated February 
7, 2022, both from organizations in sup-
port of H.R. 4445. 
FEBRUARY 4, 2022. 
Re Pass the Ending Forced Arbitration of 
Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment 
Act of 2021 (HR. 4445). 
DEAR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS: On behalf of 
the undersigned organizations, we write in 
support of the Ending Forced Arbitration of 
Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act 
of 2021 (H.R. 4445), a bill that would provide 
important new opportunities for individuals 
who experience sexual harassment and as-
sault to seek justice without being forced 
into closed-door and secretive forced arbitra-
tion proceedings, where the deck is too often 
stacked against them. 
Today, individuals are routinely forced to 
sign an arbitration clause to resolve disputes 
as a condition of obtaining a job or pur-
chasing a good or service, often through lan-
guage buried in fine print. Many individuals 
who sign such documents have no idea they 
have waived the ability to enforce their 
rights in court. Arbitrators are often chosen 
and paid by companies. There is no public 
record of the proceedings or the outcome, 
and rarely an opportunity to appeal the arbi-
trator’s decision. Many who come forward 
with reports of sexual harassment or sexual 
assault, cannot afford legal counsel. The ar-
bitration clause may force them to bear 
some of the significant costs of the arbitra-
tion. The resolution of their disputes may 
fail to make them whole for the harm they 
have suffered. 
The lack of public accountability enabled 
by forced arbitration has played a harmful 
role in allowing sexual harassment and as-
sault to persist in the shadows. In the four 
years since #MeToo went viral, thousands of 
individuals, disproportionately women, have 
come forward to share their experiences— 
many several years after the fact—and to de-
mand justice. When women and all those who 
have experienced assault and harassment 
share their stories, it gives others the cour-
age to come forward as well. But when 
women who report such conduct are forced 
into arbitration, that secretive process with 
no public accountability further silences sur-
vivors, and employers and companies can 
continue to employ and protect serial sexual 
harassers. 
The Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual 
Assault and Sexual Harassment Act is an im-
portant step towards restoring power to sur-
vivors of sexual assault and sexual harass-
ment by ensuring they will not be forced 
into arbitration. It is admittedly a partial 
solution, as no individual should be forced to 
waive their ability to fully enforce their 
rights to be free from other forms of unlaw-
ful harassment, discrimination, and exploi-
tation, whether as workers, as consumers, as 
patients, or as students. We are therefore 
hopeful that as a complement to this bill, 
Congress will quickly take up and pass the 
FAIR Act (H.R. 963) and Restoring Justice 
for Workers Act (H.R. 4841), which would en-
sure that companies can no longer cir-
cumvent the legal system by forcing individ-
uals into arbitration. But the Ending Forced 
Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual 
Harassment Act represents an important 
partial restoration of individuals’ rights to 
seek accountability and justice. Accord-
ingly, we urge you to support this legisla-
tion. If you have any questions, please con-
tact Emily Martin (emartin@nwlc.org) at 
the National Women’s Law Center. 
Sincerely, 
National Women’s Law Center, National 
Employment Law Project, National Employ-
ment Lawyers Association.

DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI AND MINORITY LEAD-
ER MCCARTHY: We, the undersigned groups, 
support passage of H.R. 4445, the Ending 
Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and 
Sexual Harassment Act of 2021. This bipar-
tisan bill would empower survivors of sexual 
assault and sexual harassment by allowing 
survivors of sexual harassment and sexual 
assault to file a case in court rather than be 
forced into arbitration. Survivors of sexual 
assault and sexual harassment would be able 
to hold perpetrators and institutions ac-
countable outside of closed-door arbitration 
proceedings and shine light on systemic 
issues of wrongdoing. According to actor 
Eliza Dushku, one of several witnesses who 
testified under the protection of congres-
sional subpoenas, at a powerful hearing last 
November on H.R. 4445, forced arbitration 
‘‘protects the harassers, the abusers, the cor-
porations, and it isolates the victims . . . [it] 
creates a culture of silencing.’’ 
Many of the undersigned groups oppose the 
use of forced arbitration against all con-
sumers and workers. Predispute binding ar-
bitration clauses and class action waivers, 
together 
known 
as 
forced 
arbitration 
clauses, are typically buried in ‘‘take-it-or- 
leave it’’ agreements that waive an individ-
ual’s fundamental rights to seek account-
ability in court when they are hurt or when 
their rights are violated. These clauses de-
prive people of the opportunity to hold 
wrongdoers accountable, no matter how 
widespread or egregious the misconduct may 
be; and they also allow all types of abuse, 
discrimination, and fraud to go unchecked. 
In the privatized system of forced arbitra-
tion, there is no judge or jury, and the right 
to appeal is severely limited. Arbitrators do 
not have to follow the law or precedent. And 
proceedings take place behind a veil of se-
crecy that insulates perpetrators from public 
accountability. That is why thousands of 
Google workers around the world walked off 
the job in late 2018 to protest, among other 
things, Google’s use of forced arbitration 
clauses to hide mistreatment of workers who 
alleged 
harassment 
and 
discrimination 
against high-level executives. Also in 2018, in 
a rare gesture of bipartisanship, all 56 attor-
neys general (in every state, the District of 
Columbia, and territories) urged Congress to 
immediately enact legislation that would 
ban forced arbitration for sexual harassment 
claims. The letter said, ‘‘Victims of such se-
rious misconduct should not be constrained 
to pursue relief from decision makers who 
are not trained as judges, are not qualified to 
act as courts of law and are not positioned to 
ensure that such victims are accorded both 
procedural and substantive due process.’’ 
The Senate companion bill, which passed 
the Senate Judiciary Committee on a voice 
vote, has ten Republican co-sponsors, and 
support continues to grow. Conservative 
commentator and women’s rights advocate 
Gretchen Carlson, who has been a vocal op-
ponent of the way forced arbitration clauses 
are used to silence victims of sexual harass-
ment, recently said that passing H.R. 4445 
‘‘will be a victory for American workers and 
I am incredibly optimistic this is going to be 
the law of the land.’’ 
H.R. 4445 has widespread, bipartisan sup-
port inside and outside the walls of Congress. 
We urge all Members of the House to vote for 
this important legislation. Your staff should 
feel free to reach out to Remington A. Gregg 
should you have any questions.

Mr. NADLER. I thank my colleagues, 
Representatives 
BUSTOS, 
GRIFFITH, 
JAYAPAL, and BUCK, for their leader-
ship on this issue. I urge my colleagues 
to support this bipartisan legislation, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume, and I thank my colleague from 
New York for yielding me the cus-
tomary 30 minutes. 
We are here today to discuss H.R. 
4445. Sexual harassment and sexual as-
sault are despicable actions. Victims of 
sexual harassment and assault must 
have their claims heard, and they 
should not be silenced or intimidated 
into silence. 
The Judiciary Committee heard im-
portant testimony from victims of sex-
ual harassment and assault. It took 
real courage for those victims to tell 
their stories to us. What those women, 
and many more women around the 
country, have had to face is terrible, 
and sexual harassment should not be 
tolerated. 
H.R. 4445 would not make victims 
better off. And no matter how well-in-
tentioned the bill may be, it raises real 
policy concerns. 
The committee received testimony 
from 
experts 
explaining

bill’s

flaws. For example, this bill’s sup-
porters seem to assume that all arbi-
tration is secret, that arbitration auto-
matically keeps victims from going to 
the authorities or publicizing their ex-
periences. 
That is not accurate. Arbitration is 
not intrinsically secret or otherwise 
confidential. Put simply, agreeing to 
resolve a case outside of court is dif-
ferent than agreeing to silence. 
That distinction matters today be-
cause much of the argument for this 
bill comes from concerns about secrecy 
rather than whether justice can be 
served in the arbitration context. 
Despite that emphasis, H.R. 4445 does 
not actually address confidentiality or 
nondisclosure agreements. Even if this 
bill is enacted, it is still possible that 
separate contract provisions could be 
used to impose confidentiality or keep 
details about an employer under wraps. 
But in all likelihood, this bill would 
effectively end most arbitration in 
these contexts, even when arbitration 
would benefit a victim, because the bill 
fundamentally changes an arbitration 
clause from a mutual commitment to 
use an alternative dispute resolution 
into a one-sided election for an injured 
party. 
If H.R. 4445 becomes law, contracts 
will be far less likely to include the op-
tion to arbitrate. If parties cannot 
agree in advance to arbitrate, the 
plaintiffs may never have access to ar-
bitration. 
These 
unintended 
con-
sequences will have real-world implica-
tions, especially for victims who lack 
deep pockets or do not have the possi-
bility for a high-dollar settlement that 
some high-profile cases can obtain. 
Lawsuits are often long and expen-
sive, and big corporations have more 
resources to litigate than most vic-
tims. Litigation can be harrowing for 
victims who, in traditional litigation, 
must submit to rigorous discovery, 
depositions, or perhaps even the chal-
lenges of a public trial. And it may 
even be harder for victims to tell their 
stories in litigation and get justice, 
given the rules of evidence that may 
apply. 
Democrats cast aside these concerns, 
and they ignore how arbitration is gen-
erally a good way to resolve disputes. 
Why are some in Congress so intent 
on taking this legislation forward 
today? For years, Democrats have tried 
to gut arbitration agreements for all 
kinds of different claims and plaintiffs. 
If Democrats had their way, everyone— 
from consumers to civil rights plain-
tiffs, to those with antitrust claims, to 
individuals 
using 
financial 
service 
products, and others—would not be 
able to contract in advance to resolve 
disputes through arbitration. Instead, 
they would be forced into the courts. 
Congress should stand ready to im-
prove the legal system, but we must 
make sure that whatever Congress does 
will actually be an improvement. What 
we have before us today is Congress 
changing existing and agreed-to con-
tracts. 
I have real concerns about govern-
ment retroactively nullifying existing 
contractual 
agreements, 
no 
matter 
how well-intentioned it is. 
I urge you all to carefully consider 
the ramifications of H.R. 4445. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Illinois (Mrs. BUSTOS), the spon-
sor of this bill. 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to speak enthusiastically in support of 
my bill, the Ending Forced Arbitration 
of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harass-
ment Act. 
Five years ago, The Washington Post 
published a story that shocked me to 
my core. Madam Speaker, 69,000 women 
were suing Sterling, Inc., for sexual 
harassment, sexual assault, and sexual 
discrimination. Sterling is the parent 
company of Kay and Jared Jewelers. 
And, yes, I did say 69,000. I had to 
double-check that over and over—not 
69, not 6,900—69,000 women. 
‘‘If you didn’t do what he wanted 
with him, you wouldn’t get your’’—pre-
ferred—‘‘store or raise.’’ That is what 
Sanya Douglas, a former employee, tes-
tified. 
‘‘A boozy, no-spouses-allowed ‘sex 
fest,’ where attendance was mandatory 
and women were aggressively pursued, 
groped, and harassed.’’ That is how 
meetings at the company were de-
scribed. 
‘‘You were meat, being shopped.’’ 
That is how a former employee de-
scribed her workplace. 
Each story was more disturbing than 
the story before it: managers demand-
ing sexual acts in exchange for employ-
ment benefits; company events where 
women were expected to undress pub-
licly. In one story, a former employee 
attended an overnight meeting where 
she woke up with her underwear 
pushed down to her ankles, a manager 
raping her. 
This type of sexual perverseness in 
the workplace went on for years, and it 
all stayed secret. And the reason for 
that secrecy? Because of one single 
legal clause hidden deep down in these 
women’s employment paperwork, a 
clause that says if a claim arises be-
tween an employer and an employee, it 
must go to arbitration, and taking a 
case like this to court is prohibited. 
My bill would make it illegal to en-
force agreements that mandate third- 
party arbitration, which is a type of 
legal dispute resolution that is con-
ducted behind closed doors and often 
favors the employer. 
Seems simple, right? Well, that one 
tiny clause protected a company of 
abusers 
and 
silenced 
those 
69,000 
women just at Sterling, Inc. That is 
just one single company we are talking 
about. 
But the stories go on, and the bad ac-
tors aren’t just at workplaces. While 60 
million—that is 60 million—Americans 
are working under these forced arbitra-
tion clauses through their employers, 
the real number of people impacted by 
this incredibly common pitfall is huge. 
Many more millions of Americans have 
signed away their rights through prop-
erty leases, ride-share applications, 
moving companies, nursing homes, gro-
cery deliveries. 
That terms and conditions box that 
we have all simply checked off after 
downloading an app or hiring a service 
might just have an arbitration clause 
hiding in it, ready to strip away your 
right to go to court if you have been 
sexually harassed or sexually assaulted 
and you choose to go to court. 
b 1715 
While some companies have already 
eliminated 
this 
abusive 
practice— 
thank you to them—it is time to do 
away with these legal traps for good. 
The Ending Forced Arbitration of 
Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment 
Act will invalidate any forced arbitra-
tion clause in any contract or agree-
ment in the case of sexual assault or 
harassment. 
And I am proud to say that my bill 
has widespread support among Repub-
licans and Democrats over at the Sen-
ate and here at the House. 
I thank those that have helped us get 
here today. I thank PRAMILA JAYAPAL, 
MORGAN
GRIFFITH, KEN
BUCK, DAVID 
CICILLINE, Chairman NADLER, Senators 
GILLIBRAND, LINDSEY GRAHAM and DICK 
DURBIN, and our fearless champion on 
this, Gretchen Carlson. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill, and I look forward to the day 
when our sexual assault survivors can 
have their day in court. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. GRIFFITH). 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of H.R. 4445, the 
Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual 
Assault and Sexual Harassment Act. 
I 
believe 
pre-dispute 
arbitration 
agreements are useful in some cir-
cumstances. They can allow common, 
foreseeable disagreements to be re-
solved quickly and efficiently, but we 
must acknowledge in the case of sexual 
assault and sexual harassment, nobody 
signs on to an employment agreement 
thinking that oh, I am going to be sex-
ually harassed or I am going to risk 
sexual abuse. They don’t sign up for 
that. And most of these contracts, 
Madam Speaker, are what we call ad-
hesion contracts. You have to accept 
it. 
And what often happens is there will 
be a couple of pages that have all the 
big items: Terms of the employment, 
salary, promotion, vacation. And then 
they will incorporate a handbook. The 
handbook will then have buried in it 
language that says all disputes must go 
to mandatory arbitration. And often-
times the people who are doing the ar-
bitrating aren’t lawyers. The rules of 
evidence aren’t applied. The rules of 
law are not applied. It is just how they 
feel after they hear everything. 
This has created a situation that, re-
lated to sexual assault and sexual har-
assment, is unconscionable. It shocks

the conscience. And in fairness, it is a 
violation of public policy, in my opin-
ion, and should be eliminated as part of 
a contract. 
I am surprised courts haven’t already 
come to that conclusion, but instead of 
having each court in each of the States 
and territories make that decision, this 
act will do it once and for all, and we 
will have done our jobs to make sure 
that in these egregious situations the 
individual who is making the claim 
and who has probably been assaulted or 
has been harassed or has some kind of 
a valid claim will have an opportunity 
to go to court or have an opportunity 
to go to binding arbitration, if that is 
what they choose, but they will have a 
choice instead of having to go in front 
of company-picked arbiters who will 
make a decision for them that will af-
fect them the rest of their lives. 
Now, I will tell you that it is impor-
tant that we move forward with this 
bill, and it looks like things are going 
well, but you never know. But I will 
also tell you that there has been an al-
legation that it is retroactive—and 
that is not accurate—as to cases cur-
rently pending. It is accurate as to con-
tracts currently signed. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Washington (Ms. JAYAPAL). 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Madam Speaker, this 
is a landmark day. H.R. 4445, the End-
ing Forced Arbitration of Sexual As-
sault and Sexual Harassment Act, will 
ensure that tens of millions of people 
are no longer silenced in instances 
where there is sexual harassment and 
sexual assault. 
These forced arbitration agreements 
require 
that 
people 
with 
disputes 
against a company use a secretive, one- 
sided mediation process instead of the 
judicial system. Sexual assault and 
sexual 
harassment 
survivors 
with 
claims against a company are stripped 
of the right to decide how to pursue ac-
countability for their perpetrator. It is 
a lose-lose scenario. People are left 
with little alternative but to sign these 
agreements, and yet, they often face 
retaliation and backlash when they are 
pursuing their claims. 
This bipartisan bill is essential for 
survivors like Tatiana Spottiswoode, 
who bravely testified under the protec-
tion of a friendly subpoena at a House 
Judiciary Committee hearing. Tatiana 
needed that protection because forced 
arbitration took away all of her rights 
to speak publicly about the severe har-
assment that she had endured from her 
boss and her abuser, former CEO of 
Afiniti, Zia Chishti. At the hearing, 
Tatiana testified that ‘‘the person who 
changed my life forever continues to 
abuse me because forced arbitration 
gives him the power to do it in secret.’’ 
Tatiana’s freedom to discuss her ex-
periences publicly had real impact. Mr. 
Chishti was finally fired, and the 
former Prime Minister of the U.K. re-
signed from the advisory board of her 
abuser’s 
company. 
Her 
story, 
and 
countless others like hers, show why 
this bill is so critical. 
I am so proud to colead this bill with 
the incredible Representative CHERI 
BUSTOS. And I thank Representative 
BUSTOS
and Representative MORGAN 
GRIFFITH and Representative KEN BUCK 
for their leadership, as well. No one 
should have to endure what happened 
to Tatiana and so many others like 
her. We have an opportunity in the 
House of Representatives to set this 
right for millions of brave survivors. 
Vote ‘‘yes’’ to pass H.R. 4445. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
New 
York 
(Mr. 
JEFFRIES). 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the distinguished chair of the 
House Judiciary Committee for yield-
ing and for his leadership. I thank my 
good friend and colleague Representa-
tive CHERI BUSTOS for her leadership. 
The people of America, the women of 
America have a right to be free of sex-
ual harassment. The women of America 
have a right to be free of sexual as-
sault. The women of America have a 
right to be free of a hostile work envi-
ronment. They deserve their day in 
court. 
The process and practice of forced ar-
bitration 
undermines 
these 
rights 
without providing an adequate remedy. 
The American people are being hood-
winked. The American people are being 
bamboozled. The American people are 
being led astray by forced arbitration. 
This practice of forced arbitration is 
unfair, unjust, unacceptable, uncon-
scionable, and un-American. 
H.R. 4445 will make it unlawful. 
I urge strong support for this legisla-
tion so that liberty and justice for all 
can prevail. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. JOHNSON). 
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the chairman for al-
lowing me to speak, and I want to com-
mend my colleague, Representative 
CHERI
BUSTOS, for introducing this 
very important legislation. 
It is a travesty of justice for a 
woman to be subjected to sexual har-
assment and even sexual assault on the 
job. Oftentimes, it takes place in a job 
setting where there is a culture of sex-
ual harassment and sexual assault. 
And when these women find after 
they have been assaulted that they are 
barred from going to court because 
somehow they have been hoodwinked 
into a forced arbitration agreement 
with their employer, they are surprised 
because at that point they have been 
assaulted for a second time because 
when they go into arbitration you 
often find that the deck is stacked 
against the victim in favor of the per-
petrator. 
This legislation gets at that problem 
by making those kinds of agreements 
unenforceable. I fully support this leg-
islation. I would ask all of my col-
leagues to support it. It is good, com-
monsense legislation. 
Justice is all that is asked for. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. GAETZ). 
Mr. GAETZ. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding. 
For the fourth consecutive year I rise 
as one of the few but faithful Repub-
licans in strong support of this good 
legislation. 
Here 
is 
the 
question 
presented: 
Should sexual harassers who work for 
big businesses get to pick their juries 
in advance? I think that the populist, 
nationalist, right approach is to be-
lieve that the Article III courts that we 
have set up for any and all function as 
the proper venue. 
But for tens of millions of American 
workers, 
that 
courthouse 
door 
is 
locked. It is closed. It is inaccessible. 
The result is that a system exists for 
concierge justice, private-sector jus-
tice. 
The evidence before the Judiciary 
Committee undeniably is that big busi-
ness wins more cases, shuts down more 
awards, and is able to reduce awards in 
the arbitration setting as opposed to 
the setting that anybody else would be 
able to enter in a taxpayer-funded 
court. That is wrong. 
We have all heard about the fine 
print in this country. No one reads the 
fine print. But the fine print shouldn’t 
be a reason that someone is more like-
ly to have to endure sexual harassment 
in the workplace or more likely to 
evade consequence as the result of 
predatory behavior. 
I especially thank the majority for 
incorporating a number of the minori-
ty’s views to make this bill stronger 
and more likely to become law, and I 
sincerely hope that I am not here for a 
fifth year advocating for its passage 
again. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE), a dis-
tinguished member of the Judiciary 
Committee. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the distinguished chairman for 
his leadership, and I thank my distin-
guished friend from Illinois, Congress-
woman BUSTOS for her constant deter-
mination. 
It is wonderful that H.R. 4445 is re-
storing freedom and justice to women. 
It is a bipartisan piece of legislation 
that will not allow any pre-dispute ar-
bitration 
agreement 
or 
pre-dispute 
joint action waiver to be valid or en-
forceable with respect to a case which 
is filed under Federal, Tribal, or State 
law and relates to a sexual assault dis-
pute or sexual harassment dispute. 
I am glad to hear friends on the other 
side, as this is a bipartisan bill, ac-
knowledge the fact that this is an abso-
lute injustice; an injustice that befalls 
a certain segment of the population, 
and that is women. 
One of the cases that is most stark is 
the one of Stefani Bambace. Many wit-
nesses came before us in the Judiciary

Committee. Witness after witness gave 
us horror stories of isolation and fear 
and the absolute inability, because of 
the fine print, to do anything about it. 
Stefani Bambace alleged that she 
worked in a sexually charged and hos-
tile work environment, including being 
subjected to sexually explicit language 
from her employer, sexual advances 
and groping. Let me say that again. 
Touching in her space from her em-
ployer, sexual advances and groping 
and explicit images. How can you work 
as a professional or anyone? Think of 
the levels of work that women are in; 
from domestic to as high a level as sci-
entists and CEOs. But yet, they are 
subjected to this kind of behavior. 
According to Ms. Bambace’s petition, 
she complained to human resources to 
no avail about the harassment. And 
guess what her relief was? Guess what 
empathy was shown? Guess what com-
fort and reforming the system was? It 
was her being fired. That is right. She 
was fired. How many stories of women 
are there, that are yet not told, who 
were fired? 
And so this agreement of which my 
colleague has worked on, and we are 
pleased in the Judiciary Committee to 
be part of moving this legislation, this 
will end these arbitration agreements 
that are snuck into a packet of mate-
rials that you sign. 
It is imperative we pass it, but more 
importantly Madam Speaker, it is im-
perative that it is passed in the Senate 
because it is bipartisan, but it is signed 
by the President and becomes law. 
I thank Ms. Bambace and all of the 
witnesses that came before us. They 
sacrifice, they suffered, but yet today, 
hopefully, will be an announcement, a 
pronouncement of freedom and justice 
for women who have struggled with 
this all of the time. 
H.R. 4445 is a relief that is a long 
time in coming, and it should move 
away from blind, silent, quiet agree-
ments that no one knows what it is. 
Freedom and justice for women in the 
workforce today. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to speak in strong 
support of H.R. 4445, the Ending Forced Arbi-
tration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harass-
ment Act. 
This bill will amend Title 9 of the United 
States Code, empowering survivors of sexual 
assault and harassment by restoring their ac-
cess to justice and public accountability under 
the law. 
By ending forced arbitration in lawsuits in-
volving these claims, survivors of sexual as-
sault or sexual harassment are empowered 
with making the decision on whether they wish 
to pursue legal action against their assailants 
which often includes going to court to arbitrate 
their claims. 
It is estimated that 60 million Americans 
have signed away their right to seek real jus-
tice and most don’t realize it until they try to 
get help. 
H.R. 4445 will not allow any pre-dispute ar-
bitration agreement or predispute joint-action 
waiver to be valid or enforceable with respect 
to a case which is filed under Federal, Tribal, 
or State law and relates to a sexual assault 
dispute or a sexual harassment dispute. 
In the Judiciary markup which brought this 
bill to the floor, survivors of sexual harassment 
and sexual assault shared their stories with 
the committee about their devastating experi-
ences and the subsequent arbitration process 
they were forced to endure as a condition of 
their employment. 
The #MeToo movement chipped away at 
the culture of secrecy that protects predators 
and silences survivors. 
Ending mandatory arbitration has the power 
to ensure that survivors of sexual harassment 
and discrimination in the workplace have their 
voices heard. 
For example, in Bambace v. Berry Y&V 
Fabricators, LLC, Stefani Bambace alleged 
that she worked in a sexually charged and 
hostile work environment, including ‘‘being 
subjected to sexually explicit images from her 
employer, sexual advances, and groping.’’ 
According to her petition, she complained to 
Human Resources about the harassment and 
was fired three weeks later. 
She filed a lawsuit alleging violations of 
Chapter 21 of the Texas Labor Code. 
Like more than half of non-unionized Amer-
ican workers, Bambace was subject to an em-
ployer promulgated arbitration agreement. 
These arbitration agreements are often 
snuck into a packet of materials employers 
give employees on their first day of employ-
ment to sign and they are rarely negotiated or 
even discussed. 
In a well-reasoned opinion in Bambace, the 
Court held that the arbitration agreement, 
which required the Plaintiff to litigate sexual 
harassment claims in confidential and binding 
arbitration, violated public policy, injured the 
public good, and was therefore void and unen-
forceable. 
Critically, the Court further rejected Defend-
ant’s argument that the arbitrator, not the 
Court, should determine whether the sexual 
harassment claims were subject to arbitration. 
Fortunately, in the Bambace case Harris 
County Judge Lauren Reeder understood that 
cases such as these should be determined by 
a court, rather than an arbitrator irrespective of 
whether the agreement purports to delegate 
such determinations to an arbitrator. 
This is just one story out of millions where 
forced arbitration agreements attempt, and 
usually succeed, to silence sexual assault and 
sexual harassment victims. 
These forced ‘‘agreements’’ strip survivors 
of the right to decide how to pursue account-
ability of their predators. 
Instead, these survivors’ stories are heard in 
secret, behind closed doors, and do little to 
nothing to stop the systematic abuse from oc-
curring again. 
The Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual As-
sault and Sexual Harassment Act of 2021 will 
ensure that these survivors will have their 
voices heard in a court of law if they choose 
to do so. 
No survivor of sexual harassment or sexual 
assault should be forced into silence, espe-
cially by a piece of paper buried within their 
employment agreement. 
Forced arbitration allows companies to hide 
and shield sexual predators and keep employ-
ees from knowing that their other colleagues 
could be victims of the same person. 
Voiding these clauses in sexual harassment 
and discrimination cases would aid victims by 
pulling back the veil of secrecy on bad behav-
ior in the workplace. 
More than 56% of Americans are subject to 
these mandatory arbitration agreements. 
These victims deserve the right to choose to 
go to court, it should not be in the hands of 
their employer. 
A 2011 Cornell University study found that 
employees are less likely to win arbitration 
cases. 
These corporations embrace arbitration be-
cause it is a cheaper and faster way to settle 
disputes and can cut down frivolous lawsuits. 
Corporations do not want to face juries be-
cause they know citizens will punish them for 
their wrongdoing, so they sneak arbitration 
language into their take-it-or-leave-it contracts. 
Forced arbitration is a sexual harasser’s 
best friend, it is an issue of fundamental 
human rights. 
Eliza Dushku, an actress, testified that she 
had been fired from the CBS prime-time 
drama ‘‘Bull’’ after she asked her co-star, Mi-
chael Weatherly, a producer on the show, to 
stop harassing her. 
She said he had made rape jokes about her 
and had told her in front of dozens of cast and 
crew members that he wanted to be in a 
threesome with her. 
She said she had later learned that the con-
tract she signed with CBS included a forced 
arbitration clause. 
After a mediation, the company agreed to a 
confidential settlement that would pay Ms. 
Dushku $9.5 million. 
Situations such as Ms. Dushku’s aim to 
sweep sexual harassment and assault cases 
under the rug. 
Silencing these victims is exactly what 
forced arbitration agreements are meant to do 
and I believe we should no longer tolerate this 
behavior. 
This is an excellent and common-sense bill 
that will ensure victims are not silenced by 
forced arbitration agreements any longer. 
Although we cannot bring justice and a 
voice for those who have already settled their 
cases to their arbitration agreements, we can 
ensure that future victims will be heard and 
not suppressed in their truth.

Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE), a distin-

the Judiciary. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I

Madam Speaker, I heard some of my 
friends on the other side of the aisle 
say no one wants this legislation. 
Nothing could be further from the 
truth. The survivors of sexual assault 
and harassment want this, and we 
should listen to them. 
H.R. 4445 would restore access to jus-
tice for victims of sexual assault or 
harassment who are currently locked 
out of the court system due to forced 
arbitration clauses. These clauses are 
everywhere. They block survivors from 
making their stories known, having 
their day in court, and prevents them 
from holding their abusers account-
able. 
Some of the stories we heard during 
this hearing were horrific of the kind

of abuse and assault and demeaning be-
havior, and those predators knew that 
they were protected from being held 
accountable because there were forced 
arbitration clauses often accompanied 
with provisions that kept those pro-
ceedings private. 
So this private system forces sur-
vivors into a process, this forced arbi-
tration, that is not like a court sys-
tem. There is no discovery. There is no 
judge or jury. There are no require-
ments that they follow laws passed by 
the Congress or the State. And when 
you, as I said, combine that with non-
disclosure agreements, it silences the 
survivors of sexual harassment and as-
sault. Plain and simple. This bill will 
end it. 
Predators rely on that silence. As 
long as their actions are hidden, they 
are free to act with impunity, and we 
heard evidence that is in fact what 
they do, over and over and over again. 
This bill will end that. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the sponsor 
of 
this 
legislation, 
Congresswoman 
CHERI BUSTOS, who has made this her 
life’s work since she got to Congress. 
This bill will help millions of survivors 
who have had the conduct that they 
have complained about unaddressed 
and unanswered and kept quiet, and it 
will end that practice. 
We heard testimony about the found-
er of Invisalign and the CEO of Afiniti, 
who actually started an arbitration, in-
voked the clause, because he knew that 
would keep the proceedings secret and 
his abuse would go unaccounted for. 
This is disgraceful. 
Madam Speaker, this should be a 
unanimous vote. Everyone should want 
to put an end to this practice. I urge 
you to vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 4445. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Pennsylvania (Ms. SCANLON), an-
other distinguished member of the 
Committee on the Judiciary. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, sexual harassment 
and violence in the workplace are a 
corrosive and pervasive threat to the 
success and dignity of all workers, but 
particularly women. And forced or 
mandatory arbitration clauses in em-
ployment contracts have played an im-
portant role in thwarting efforts to 
hold accountable the predators who en-
gage in such conduct and the compa-
nies that allow it to continue. 
The widespread use of these clauses 
in employment contracts forces many 
Americans to agree to a form of dis-
pute resolution that silences victims of 
sexual harassment and assault and al-
lows the harassers and employers to es-
cape accountability. These arbitration 
proceedings 
overwhelmingly 
benefit 
the employer, which drafts the non-
negotiable clauses dictating the venue, 
the terms of mediation, even the arbi-
trators themselves, as well as creating 
a perverse incentive for the allegedly 
neutral arbiters to rule in favor of em-
ployers, lest they not be hired again. 
In addition to denying survivors a 
public forum to expose sexual abuse, 
which can deter future misconduct, 
these arbitration clauses also preclude 
class actions, which is often the only 
way that employees can afford to bring 
successful claims. 
H.R. 4445 would ban the use of forced 
arbitration in employment contracts in 
cases of sexual assault and harassment. 
In addition to protecting survivors of 
such harassment, that is just good pub-
lic policy. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman 
from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN), another 
distinguished member of the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary. 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairman for yielding. I sa-
lute our colleague, Congresswoman 
BUSTOS, for introducing what will cer-
tainly be the most important piece of 
pro-labor legislation to pass out of the 
117th Congress. Our Constitution guar-
antees our people the right to a jury 
trial, but forced arbitration in the 
workplace brutally cheats victims of 
sexual harassment and assault in the 
workplace out of their right to a trial 
before a jury of their peers. And by 
stripping women of this right, forced 
arbitration is creating corporate cul-
tures of pervasive and severe sexual 
harassment all across the country, like 
the one Eliza Dushku faced in Holly-
wood where she got fired for objecting 
to constant sexually degrading and 
humiliating treatment in the work-
place. 
We heard testimony from women sex-
ually harassed and raped by repeat of-
fenders who have been made proud and 
contemptuous because their conduct is 
consistently buried and hidden in re-
gimes of coerced, closed-door arbitra-
tion. We have created monsters out of 
repeat-offender sexual harassers across 
the country. 
Let’s throw the doors open and let’s 
let the sun shine in. Let’s restore the 
full constitutional rights of women in 
the workplace. Let’s pass this legisla-
tion. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Colorado (Mr. BUCK). 
Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman from Minnesota for 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 4445. This is the way the legisla-
tive process should work. This started 
with a victim of sexual harassment, 
Gretchen Carlson, who stepped forward 
and brought a cancer within an organi-
zation to light, and did it in a coura-
geous manner. Then my colleague, 
Congresswoman CHERI BUSTOS, took on 
this cause and wrote a good piece of 
legislation. 
But what she did was even more im-
portant. She was open to suggestions 
and often adopted suggestions to make 
this the very best legislation that it 
could be. And my friends, Congressman 
MATT
GAETZ
and MORGAN
GRIFFITH, 
worked alongside her and worked on 
our side of the aisle to make folks 
aware of the need for this legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 4445 because, 
one, it empowers rape victims to make 
a choice between arbitration and going 
to court. It also makes sure that sexual 
predators are held accountable. And fi-
nally, it puts corporations on notice 
that if they don’t clean up their act, 
they are going to have a big problem. 
There is no more sweeping an issue like 
this under the carpet. This is some-
thing that corporations are going to 
take seriously, and they are going to 
change their conduct as a result of a 
possible change to their bottom line. 
This bill gives Members a choice to 
support rape victims or rapists. I 
choose to support the rape victims, the 
survivors of a terrible ordeal, and I 
urge my colleagues to do the same. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. GARCIA), another dis-
tinguished member of the Committee 
on the Judiciary. 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I thank Chairman NADLER for yield-
ing, and I thank the sponsor of this 
bill, CHERI BUSTOS, for her hard work. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to ex-
press my strong support for this bill, 
H.R. 4445. As a former judge, I have a 
very deeply held belief that everybody 
should have their day in court. It is a 
simple principle: Everybody should 
have their day in court. That is the es-
sence of ‘‘justice for all’’ in our coun-
try. Every time we say the pledge and 
we end with ‘‘justice for all,’’ we have 
to demonstrate that we mean it. 
Survivors of sexual harassment and 
discrimination in the workplace de-
serve to have their voices heard. By 
ending forced arbitration in lawsuits 
involving sexual assault or sexual har-
assment claims, we ensure survivors 
are given a real choice of whether to go 
to court or to arbitrate their claim. 
Abusers will no longer be able to mis-
use arbitration law with dubious agree-
ments and fine-print clauses to hide 
their violence and silence their vic-
tims. 
I am proud that we are taking firm, 
bipartisan action to ensure justice for 
sexual harassment and sexual assault 
victims. I am proud that we are mak-
ing sure that when little kids across 
America say ‘‘justice for all,’’ that it 
truly means for ‘‘all.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 4445. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from North Carolina (Ms. ROSS), an-
other distinguished member of the 
Committee on the Judiciary. 
Ms. ROSS. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the chairman for yielding, and espe-
cially 
thank 
our 
colleague,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H990 
February 7, 2022 
BUSTOS, for bringing this important 
legislation to us. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 4445, the Ending Forced 
Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sex-
ual Harassment Act. 
In 2017, our country experienced a 
dramatic and needed shift. Women in a 
variety of industries responded to news 
of allegations against powerful men 
with the hashtag #MeToo, banding to-
gether in solidarity to expose preda-
tory behavior that has been overlooked 
and excused for generations. But some 
women are still not able to speak out 
against their abusers because forced ar-
bitration agreements prevent them 
from doing so. 
Last year, the House Committee on 
the Judiciary heard testimony from 
women from a variety of backgrounds 
and political parties, who have suffered 
the dual injustices of sexual abuse and 
forced 
silence 
through 
arbitration. 
Their stories illuminate how forced ar-
bitration agreements are too often 
used to protect assailants and their 
companies at the expense of working 
women. It is past time for Congress to 
enable these women to reclaim their 
voices and take control over their own 
lives. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 4445. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. 
DELAURO). 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, the 
Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual 
Assault and Sexual Harassment Act is 
bipartisan. It is legislation that pro-
vides survivors with the resources they 
need to seek the justice that they de-
serve and empower them by giving 
them a choice to go to court instead of 
being forced into arbitration. 
Survivors like Susan Fowler who, in 
2015, was working with Uber when her 
manager started sexually harassing 
her. She immediately reported this to 
human resources, but when she did, her 
manager threatened to fire her. And 
since Uber employees are forced to sign 
arbitration agreements when they are 
hired, preventing them from bringing 
sexual harassment claims to court, 
Susan was forced into a confidential 
dispute forum without the right to ap-
peal. 
Three years later, Susan had had 
enough and she spoke out, writing in 
an op-ed for the New York Times: 
‘‘From the systemic culture of harass-
ment and discrimination at Uber . . . 
to the ubiquitous stories of women 
taken advantage of in industries rang-
ing from professional football to res-
taurants, we have seen one company 
after 
another 
publicly 
outed 
and 
shamed for illegal treatment of em-
ployees.’’ 
And Susan rightly asks, ‘‘The ques-
tion is no longer whether mistreatment 
actually occurs . . . but what can we do 
to ensure that it never happens again.’’ 
The answer is simple. We can pass 
this bipartisan legislation, end the 
practice of forced arbitration, and I 
urge my colleagues to vote in favor of 
this bill. 
b 1745 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from 
Ohio. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
want to thank the gentlewoman from 
Minnesota for her great work here in 
the Congress and for yielding time. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition 
to this legislation. We all know that 
sexual assault and harassment are as 
wrong as wrong can be. Victims of sex-
ual harassment and sexual assault 
must have their claims heard. They 
must never be silenced or intimidated 
into silence. But the outrage we right-
ly feel on behalf of these victims does 
not mean we should rush to pass a bill 
that could leave many of them worse 
off. 
In the Judiciary Committee, we 
heard from experts about why this 
bill’s approach is misguided. For exam-
ple, some of the bill’s supporters re-
peatedly claim that arbitration is what 
keeps victims from publicizing their 
experiences or going to authorities and 
law enforcement. But arbitration is not 
automatically secret or otherwise con-
fidential. 
Agreeing to resolve a case outside of 
court is different from agreeing to si-
lence. Arbitration does not prevent 
anyone from speaking out. Anyone who 
has agreed to arbitrate may still go to 
authorities and law enforcement to re-
port the wrongdoing, and well they 
should. 
There is an important distinction be-
tween agreeing to arbitrate and agree-
ing to silence. This distinction matters 
because much of the push for this legis-
lation comes from concerns about se-
crecy rather than from an honest as-
sessment of whether arbitration ad-
vances justice. Yet despite the focus on 
secrecy, the text of this bill never actu-
ally addresses confidentiality or non-
disclosure agreements. 
Another key talking point for sup-
porters of this legislation is that it 
gives plaintiffs more choice over how 
to resolve disputes, but that is not how 
arbitration works. 
Giving one party the unilateral abil-
ity to cancel a two-way agreement to 
arbitrate will functionally take the op-
tion to arbitrate completely off the 
table. For one thing, contracts will be 
far less likely to include an option to 
arbitrate in the first place now. For an-
other, we know that if parties can’t 
agree in advance to arbitrate, then 
they are unlikely to agree to arbitrate 
after there has been a dispute. As a re-
sult, the plaintiff may never get to ar-
bitration. 
More often than not, victims do not 
have deep pockets or the potential for 
large-sum litigation settlements like 
those that are available to high-profile 
figures. This bill will cause these 
women to lose the potential benefits of 
arbitration. 
Lawsuits are normally long and cost-
ly, and companies often have enough 
money 
to 
vigorously 
defend 
these 
claims. These lawsuits are an ordeal 
for victims who, in a normal case, must 
undergo discovery, give depositions, 
and may even need to give public testi-
mony. The rules of litigation may 
make it much harder for victims to tell 
their stories in their own words and get 
the relief they deserve. 
Arbitration can be a welcomed alter-
native to the rigors and trauma of liti-
gation, but Democrats want to pretend 
that this bill won’t limit access to ar-
bitration for victims of assault. 
In reality, the bill is more about em-
powering the trial bar than actual vic-
tims. As drafted, the text gives trial 
lawyers every incentive to craft com-
plaints and allege sexual harassment or 
assault to get whole cases out of arbi-
tration and into court. 
Ultimately, this bill will empower 
the plaintiffs’ bar in ways that some of 
its supporters may not intend but that 
Democrats and trial lawyers certainly 
do. 
For years, Democrats have pursued 
plaintiffs’ lawyers’ wish to gut arbitra-
tion agreements for all kinds of dif-
ferent claims. If Democrats and the 
trial bar had their way, everyone from 
consumers of financial services, to civil 
rights plaintiffs, to those with anti-
trust claims and others would be forced 
into court even if they would rather 
agree to arbitrate at the outset. 
Don’t be fooled. What is best for 
plaintiffs’ lawyers is not always what 
is best for plaintiffs. 
Let’s ensure whatever legislative ve-
hicle we use actually makes things bet-
ter. I am very concerned about this leg-
islation and how it will actually play 
out for victims in practice and for the 
adverse consequences it could have. 
Madam Speaker, for those reasons, I 
would urge that we oppose the bill. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, we must consider 
the unintended consequences of H.R. 
4445. This bill has good intentions. We 
all want to help victims of sexual har-
assment, but this bill is not going to 
accomplish that. There are many pol-
icy concerns in this piece of legisla-
tion. 
I want to say again: What we have 
before us today is that Congress is 
changing existing and agreed-to con-
tracts. I have real concerns about gov-
ernment retroactively nullifying exist-
ing contractual agreements. 
If H.R. 4445 becomes law, contracts 
will be far less likely to include any 
option to arbitrate. This is a concern 
for victims who do not have the re-
sources to pursue high-dollar settle-
ments. We must also keep in mind that 
sometimes arbitration is the best way 
to solve disputes.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H991 
February 7, 2022 
Arbitration does not void an individ-
ual’s constitutional rights under the 
Seventh Amendment. This is just one 
of the many, many aspects of this bill 
that needs to be reconsidered before we 
can confidently move forward. 
Madam Speaker, I oppose this bill, 
and I encourage my colleagues to do 
the same until we address the concerns 
surrounding this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 4445, the End-
ing Forced Arbitration of Sexual As-
sault and Sexual Harassment Act, re-
moves barriers to justice for survivors 
of sexual assault or sexual harassment 
by giving them a real choice of whether 
to go to court or to arbitrate their 
claim after the dispute has arisen. 
Mr. JORDAN is right. Many such vic-
tims, if given the choice, will choose to 
go to court. Why shouldn’t they? In ar-
bitration, they lose 98 percent of the 
cases. The employer wins 98 percent of 
the cases in arbitration. Why? Well, for 
one thing, the employer picks the arbi-
trator, and the arbitrator is paid. So, 
naturally, the arbitrator wants to rule 
in such a way that he or she is likely 
to get hired again. 
But 98 percent of the cases brought 
by women who have been sexually har-
assed who are in forced arbitration are 
lost by them. That is why this bill is 
necessary. 
If we want to give women who have 
been sexually harassed a fair chance at 
justice, we must pass this bill. If we 
want to give women who have been sex-
ually harassed a fair chance at winning 
against their employer who did the sex-
ual harassment or allowed the sexual 
harassment, we must pass this bill. 
That is why this critical measure is 
supported by a broad coalition of pub-
lic interest organizations, including 
the National Alliance to End Sexual 
Violence, the National Center on Do-
mestic and Sexual Violence, the Na-
tional Coalition Against Domestic Vio-
lence, the National Partnership for 
Women and Families, RAINN, and 
many others. 
Not one single group that deals with 
sexual violence opposes this bill. Only 
employer organizations oppose this bill 
because it stacks the deck in their 
favor. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank my 
colleagues, 
Representatives 
BUSTOS, 
GRIFFITH, JAYAPAL, and BUCK, for their 
leadership on this issue, and I urge my 
colleagues to support this bipartisan 
legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I 
will vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 4445, Ending Forced 
Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Har-
assment Act of 2021. However, l have res-
ervations that certain provisions in the bill lack 
clarity regarding key issues. 
Employers have increasingly relied on 
forced arbitration clauses to circumvent work-
ers’ right to due process. Currently, over 60 
million American workers are locked out of the 
courtroom due to these coercive arrangements 
that compel them to go through a process that 
is rigged against them. Forced arbitration un-
dermines workers’ recourse for a wide array of 
employment law violations—not just sexual 
harassment and sexual assault; this includes 
wage theft and other employment discrimina-
tion issues. With Chairman NADLER, I intro-
duced the Restoring Justice for Workers Act, 
H.R. 4841, a more comprehensive approach 
to protect workers’ access to the courts and 
their right to collective action no matter their 
workplace claim. 
Although H.R. 4445 is an important step for-
ward by ensuring that certain individuals who 
experience ‘‘sexual assault’’ and ‘‘sexual har-
assment’’ are not forced to arbitrate their 
cases based on a pre-dispute arbitration 
agreement, I have concerns that the legisla-
tion does not go far enough to offer such pro-
tections to other vulnerable individuals who 
need fair access to the courts to vindicate 
their rights. In the employment context, for ex-
ample, the bill’s singular focus on sexual har-
assment involving unwelcome sexual ad-
vances, propositions, and sexual attention, 
fails to account for the other, harmful, and 
common, forms of sex-based harassment that 
occurs in the workplace. This kind of harass-
ment is not sexual in nature but is motivated 
by a sex-based animus or hostility. It can in-
volve offensive and derogatory comments 
about women working in male-dominated in-
dustries, physically intimidating conduct di-
rected at men who fail to conform to 
stereotypical gender norms, as well as posting 
demeaning and graphic texts and images to 
make women or men feel uncomfortable in the 
workplace. These are just a few examples of 
the non-sexual, sex-based harassment that 
have been recognized by the Supreme Court 
and the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission (EEOC), the federal agency that 
enforces employment civil rights laws. Thus, 
given the breadth and complexity of sex-based 
harassment, and the negative impact it can 
have on individuals who experience it, I have 
concerns about limiting this bill to a certain 
type of sexual harassment. 
I have similar concerns about the narrow 
scope of individuals who are included under 
the bill’s definition of ‘‘sexual harassment dis-
pute.’’ The bill states that ‘‘the term ‘sexual 
harassment dispute’ means a dispute relating 
to . . . conduct directed at an individual or 
group of individuals.’’ The phrase ‘‘directed at’’ 
suggests that the individual or group of individ-
uals must be the target of the harassing con-
duct to be included in the bill’s jurisdiction. In 
the employment context, however, the EEOC 
and federal courts have recognized that a har-
assment victim does not have to be the target 
of the harassment to have a viable harass-
ment case. A salient example of this scenario 
is a female employee who works in an envi-
ronment where male co-workers frequently 
use gender-derogatory language to describe 
or insult women, even though the language is 
not ‘‘directed at’’ the female employee. In such 
a scenario, the female employee could assert 
that she experienced sexual harassment be-
cause even though she was not the direct tar-
get of her male co-workers’ gender-derogatory 
language, she worked in a sexually offensive 
and hostile environment. Therefore, using lan-
guage in H.R. 4445 that seems to narrow the 
scope of harassment victims to only those 
who are the direct target of harassing conduct 
undercuts this important principle. 
I am encouraged that a group of bipartisan 
Members have introduced an amendment that 
recognizes some of the limitations of H.R. 
4445’s definition of ‘‘sexual harassment dis-
pute.’’ This amendment ‘‘[c]larifies that, for the 
purposes of the bill, sexual harassment dis-
pute is defined as a dispute relating to con-
duct that allegedly constitutes sexual harass-
ment under applicable Federal, Tribal, or State 
sexual harassment laws.’’ By embracing sex-
ual harassment jurisprudence, which encom-
passes a broader array of harassing conduct 
than is currently included in the text of the bill, 
the amendment would allow more sexual har-
assment victims to avoid forced arbitration of 
their cases based on a pre-dispute arbitration 
agreement. 
Unfortunately, this bipartisan amendment 
does not address one of the most problematic 
issues with H.R. 4445—the lack of clarity re-
garding the coverage of intersectional and re-
lated issues that arise in sexual harassment 
cases. For example, in the workplace, minority 
women frequently experience sexual harass-
ment concurrent with harassment based on 
their race or national origin. Additionally, a 
harassment victim may experience other neg-
ative employment actions related to the sexual 
harassment such as a demotion, unfavorable 
job transfer, reduction in pay, or other retalia-
tory conduct. The language in H.R. 4445 fails 
to specifically state whether there is coverage 
of these cases, i.e., whether intersectional 
cases and negative employment action cases 
related to the sexual harassment would go to 
court as one case or whether these cases 
would have to be bifurcated such that the sex-
ual harassment case would go to court, but 
the intersectional and related case would be 
forced into arbitration. Given that bifurcation of 
these cases will only lead to unnecessary ex-
pense and an administrative burden for both 
parties, the best reading of the language in 
the bill that refers to ‘‘a case . . . [that] relates 
to a sexual harassment dispute’’ is that it was 
meant to encompass these scenarios. Any 
other reading of the text regarding these 
issues would lead to an impractical result, but 
regrettably the bill, as drafted, does not fore-
close that possibility. 
The final issue I want to address is the leg-
islation’s failure to include a notice require-
ment directing entities, such as employers, to 
inform the recipients of their pre-dispute 
agreements that they have certain protections 
related to forced arbitration. Typically, employ-
ers include language about an arbitration 
agreement in employment applications, con-
tracts, and/or handbooks that is inconspicuous 
and difficult for a lay person to understand. 
For workers to know their rights, employers 
should be required to provide written, con-
spicuous notice of the protections in this bill, 
drafted in plain language the workers can un-
derstand, wherever the employer mentions a 
pre-dispute agreement to arbitrate, and prior 
to the employer’s commencement of arbitra-
tion proceedings. Had these simple notice re-
quirements been included in this legislation, it 
would have helped to ensure that ‘‘sexual as-
sault’’ and ‘‘sexual harassment’’ victims re-
ceived the full measure of protections under 
this bill.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H992 
February 7, 2022 
the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Ter-
rorism, and Homeland Security, I rise in strong 
support of H.R. 4445, the Ending Forced Arbi-
tration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harass-
ment Act of 2021. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 4445, the Ending 
Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sex-
ual Harassment Act of 2021, is bipartisan and 
bicameral legislation that empowers survivors 
of sexual assault and sexual harassment by 
giving them a choice to go to court instead of 
being forced into arbitration. 
This legislation would amend the Federal 
Arbitration Act for disputes involving sexual 
assault and sexual harassment in order to 
stop employers and businesses from forcing 
employees and customers out of the court 
system and into arbitration. 
It would ensure that predispute arbitration 
clauses and waivers of the right to bring joint 
actions in cases of sexual assault or sexual 
harassment would not be valid or enforceable 
for cases that are filed under Federal, Tribal, 
or State law. 
Under current law, many employment and 
other contracts require binding arbitration for a 
wide range of matters before a dispute arises, 
which denies survivors the ability to decide 
whether to pursue their claim with the proce-
dural protections provided by courts, and si-
lences victims of abuse by forcing them into a 
confidential dispute forum without the right to 
appeal. 
Madam Speaker, more than 60 million 
Americans are subject to mandatory arbitration 
clauses in the workplace, often without real-
izing it until they come forward to bring a claim 
against their employer. 
The Report of the Co-Chairs of the U.S. 
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s 
Select Task Force on the Study of Harass-
ment in the Workplace notes that between 50– 
75 percent of women have faced some form 
of unwanted or unwelcome sexual harassment 
in the workplace. 
Additionally, contracts for services may in-
clude mandatory arbitration clauses in the fine 
print that shield companies and businesses 
from being held publicly accountable for the 
harm caused. 
I support this necessary legislation because 
it advances efforts to prevent and address 
sexual 
harassment 
and 
sexual 
assault, 
strengthen rights, protect victims, and promote 
access to justice. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly support this leg-
islation and urge all Members to join me in 
voting for H.R. 4445, the Ending Forced Arbi-
tration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harass-
ment Act of 2021. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate on the bill has expired. 
AMENDMENT NO. 1 OFFERED BY MR. BUCK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 1 
printed in part B of House Report 117– 
241. 
Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, I have 
an amendment at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Beginning on page 2, strike line 21 and all 
that follows through line 10 on page 3, and 
insert the following: 
(4) 
SEXUAL
HARASSMENT
DISPUTE.—The 
term ‘‘sexual harassment dispute’’ means a 
dispute relating to conduct that is alleged to 
constitute sexual harassment under applica-
ble Federal, Tribal, or State law. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 900, the gen-
tleman from Colorado (Mr. BUCK) and a 
Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Colorado. 
Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, this 
amendment is really very simple. It 
changes a somewhat convoluted defini-
tion of sexual harassment to the fol-
lowing: ‘‘The term ‘sexual harassment 
dispute’ means a dispute relating to 
conduct that is alleged to constitute 
sexual harassment under applicable 
Federal, Tribal, or State law.’’ 
Simple, straightforward, understand-
able. The issue arose here because 
there was a question of whether the 
definition that was contained in this 
law would supersede Federal, State, or 
Tribal law; it doesn’t. However, this 
clarifies that, and I would ask my col-
leagues to support this. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
claim the time in opposition to the 
amendment, although I am not op-
posed. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the gentleman from New 
York is recognized for 5 minutes. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself 45 seconds. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
the amendment offered by the distin-
guished gentleman from Colorado (Mr. 
BUCK), the ranking member of the Sub-
committee on Antitrust, Commercial, 
and Administrative Law. 
This 
amendment 
simply 
clarifies 
that H.R. 4445 does not amend current 
law outside of the Federal Arbitration 
Act. It reflects the bipartisan input of 
several of my colleagues in the House 
and Senate, including the bill’s spon-
sor, Congresswoman BUSTOS. 
Importantly, this amendment would 
protect the rights of survivors of sex-
ual harassment by ensuring that they 
have a choice of litigating or arbi-
trating any case relating to the con-
duct that is alleged to constitute sex-
ual harassment under applicable law. It 
does so by making clear that anything 
related to sexual harassment or assault 
as currently defined by law is covered 
by this bill. 
This would include retaliation or any 
other misconduct that gives rise to the 
underlying claim alleging a violation 
of these laws and reflects an important 
compromise struck to protect these 
cases. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this amendment, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from North 
Carolina (Mr. BISHOP). 
Mr. 
BISHOP 
of 
North 
Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased with this 
amendment by the gentleman from 
Colorado. It has my full support in the 
Judiciary Committee. 
I also appreciate the chairman’s non- 
opposition to the amendment. I believe 
it makes the bill better, and it makes 
the bill one that I am going to be eager 
and pleased to support. 
The problem before was that the bill 
possibly made unenforceable arbitra-
tion agreements going well beyond sex-
ual harassment disputes. But for sexual 
harassment disputes, I am in full 
agreement that the victim in every 
case should have the opportunity not 
to arbitrate, notwithstanding an arbi-
tration agreement. 
Therefore, this amendment succeeds. 
I am going to be glad to support the 
bill in full, and I am sure many others 
will as well. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Illinois (Mrs. BUSTOS), the spon-
sor of the bill. 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I am 
a proud co-lead of the amendment with 
Ranking Member KEN BUCK of Colo-
rado. 
This amendment is the result of good 
faith negotiations on an issue raised by 
Republicans on the House Judiciary 
Committee during debate on my bill, 
the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sex-
ual Assault and Sexual Harassment 
Act. 
We promised them that we would 
work to address those issues, and we 
did. I am glad we could reach an agree-
ment to address their concerns about 
State and local laws. 
This amendment and the underlying 
bill are a testament to what we can ac-
complish when we listen to each other 
and trust that we are working toward a 
common goal. In this case, that goal is 
protecting survivors of sexual assault 
and harassment and giving them a 
choice on how to pursue justice. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Congress-
man BUCK for offering this amendment 
and working with us to address the 
concerns of his colleagues. I urge my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to 
support this amendment. 
Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from Virginia (Mr. GRIFFITH), a cospon-
sor of this bill. 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of the amendment. 
As we just heard, this was the major-
ity party taking into account the views 
of the minority party, which is why we 
have support on both sides of the aisle 
for this amendment. 
This amendment will bring more 
Members of the minority party onto 
the bill. As one of the cosponsors of the 
bill, I think that is a good thing. 
I think this is an appropriate amend-
ment. I think it does clarify. 
I commend Mrs. BUSTOS
and Mr. 
BUCK
for their hard work on this 
amendment. I ask that everyone vote 
for the amendment. 
b 1800 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. CORREA).

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H993 
February 7, 2022 
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of the bill and the 
amendment. 
Sex crimes, including sexual harass-
ment, are some of the most brutal and 
heinous crimes, causing irreparable 
damage to their victims. Beyond the 
physical pain, the psychological trau-
ma usually scars the victim for life. 
And let us not forget that the vast ma-
jority of victims bear this pain silently 
since these crimes usually go unre-
ported. 
I want to thank Mrs. BUSTOS for the 
bill and the amendments to prohibit 
forced arbitration when it comes to 
sexual assault. But I say to you, 
Madam Speaker, this is not enough. We 
must also address secret settlements 
and nondisclosure agreements. These 
agreements allow sexual predators to 
continue to victimize other victims for 
a long, long time. 
To remedy this loophole, I will be in-
troducing legislation to prohibit secret 
settlements when it comes to sexual 
crimes. 
Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, I am pre-
pared to close, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the distinguished 
gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
SPEIER). 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairman for the oppor-
tunity. 
This is nothing short of profound; the 
impact it is going to have on 60 million 
Americans who don’t even know that 
they have agreed to forced arbitration 
and the fact that in 98 percent of the 
cases of sexual assault and sexual har-
assment in the workplace, the em-
ployer wins. 
We had a hearing last week in which 
the NFL staffers at the Washington 
Commanders talked about the sexual 
harassment and sexual assault that 
they endured. One of them said in the 
year and a half that she worked there, 
she was sexually harassed every single 
day. 
Let me speak about Loretta Lee of 
California who was fired from Google 
after complaining about male cowork-
ers making lewd remarks, sending her 
disturbing messages, hiding under her 
desk, and showing up at her apartment. 
In addition to losing her right to file 
suit, she was also forced to meet with 
her perpetrators, resulting in retalia-
tion. 
Representative BUSTOS
has done a 
great service to men and women who 
are sexually harassed and sexually as-
saulted in the workplace. I commend 
her, and I applaud her. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all my col-
leagues to vote for this amendment and 
for the legislation. 
Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, in 
closing, I thank Mr. BUCK for offering 
this helpful amendment. 
I thank Ms. SPEIER, and I thank all 
the people who have been so helpful on 
this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for his leadership, and I 
appreciate Mrs. BUSTOS and her will-
ingness to consider this language. I 
don’t know that there was a problem 
beforehand, but whatever there was, it 
has been cleared up, and I very much 
think that this is a stronger bill as a 
result of this amendment. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote for it, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the previous question 
is ordered on the bill and on the 
amendment offered by the gentleman 
from Colorado (Mr. BUCK). 
The question is on the amendment 
offered by the gentleman from Colo-
rado (Mr. BUCK). 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that

Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are 
postponed. 
Pursuant to clause 1(c) of rule XIX, 
further consideration of H.R. 4445 is

THE 
BIPARTISAN 
INFRASTRUC-
TURE BILL AND THE ECONOMY 
(Ms. BROWN of Ohio asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. BROWN of Ohio. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to highlight how the bi-
partisan infrastructure law will accel-
erate last year’s record job growth. 
In Cleveland and Akron, more than 50 
percent of roads have pavement in poor 
condition. The infrastructure law will 
help to repave these roads and reduce 
commute times. The law allows public 
transit agencies like the RTA and 
Akron Metro in my district to replace 
outdated vehicles, build new garages, 
and expand services. 
Ohio has more lead pipes than almost 
every other State in the country. The 
infrastructure law will help to ensure 
every child and family in our region 
has access to safe drinking water. The 
law will expand access to safe drinking 
water, and the law will expand access 
to high-speed internet to the roughly 
30 percent of Cleveland households that 
currently lack it. 
These projects will create thousands 
of jobs across our State, jobs that come 
on the heels of last year’s record eco-
nomic job growth. In 2021, we had the 
greatest year of job creation in history. 
Unemployment is down, and wages are 
rising. 
Make no mistake, the Biden agenda 
is creating jobs and delivering results, 
real results, for the people. 
f 
HONORING MS. IRENE ROBINSON 
(Ms. LETLOW asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. LETLOW. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor a truly outstanding in-
dividual from Louisiana’s Fifth Dis-
trict. For almost 50 years, Irene Robin-
son, known to so many of us as Ms. 
Irene, has been the radio voice of West 
Carroll Parish, using the airwaves to 
keep our rural communities informed 
about the latest news, weather, and 
events around town. In addition, she is 
a diehard football fan and spent her 
Friday nights as the beloved announcer 
for the Oak Grove Tigers. 
Throughout her career, Ms. Irene en-
sured that her station, KWCL, was a 
community 
gathering 
place, 
high-
lighting some of the best in our region. 
Her love for family and for Louisiana, 
particularly her native West Carroll 
Parish, was always evident on the air. 
Ms. Irene’s late husband, Ivy, also 
served as her engineer, ensuring that 
her broadcasts were always a family af-
fair. I can tell you that the sense of 
family also extended to her guests as 
well. 
Madam Speaker, we are honored to 
celebrate Ms. Irene Robinson for her 
many contributions in northeast Lou-
isiana, we recognize the incredible leg-
acy she leaves behind, and wish her

RECOGNIZING SEWA DIWALI 
(Ms. SHERRILL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize Sewa Diwali for 
their work supporting communities in 
need in NJ–11 and across the country. 
Their mission is to bring people to-
gether, foster commitment to selfless 
giving, 
and 
embody 
the 
spirit 
of 
Diwali. They do this through orga-
nizing food collections and other dona-
tion drives. 
In my district, New Jersey–11, I have 
joined Sewa for multiple food drives 
and community events. Sewa donated 
1,700 pounds of food to the Morris 
Plains food pantry and 2,400 pounds to 
Parsippany food pantry in 2021 alone. 
The enthusiasm toward doing good and 
giving back to the community Sewa 
brings to our towns is truly heart-
warming. 
Nationally in 2021, they collected 
590,000 pounds of food which provided 
an estimated 491,000 meals throughout 
31 States and 200 townships. 
I want to thank every volunteer who 
has aided Sewa in helping so many of 
our neighbors, friends, and families. I 
look forward to seeing and being a part 
of the good they will do in 2022. 
f 
LIBERTY COUNTY KIWANIS CLUB 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
establishment of a new Kiwanis Club in 
the First District’s Liberty County. 
Kiwanis Clubs across the country are 
known for making it their mission to 
improve their respective communities 
through engagement of our youth. Lib-
erty County’s chapter is no exception. 
It is through their incredible dedica-
tion 
to 
our 
community 
that 
the 
Kiwanis Club of Liberty County aims 
to improve the lives of every citizen 
around them. 
Our youth are our future, and the 
drive already exhibited by this chapter 
has blessed us with a bright one 
through strong youth engagement. We 
are incredibly grateful for all that they 
have planned, and we know that they 
will be an asset to Georgia’s First Dis-
trict. 
It is moments like these that make 
me extraordinarily proud to represent 
a district that is so motivated to im-
prove the lives of their neighbors. 
I thank the Liberty County Kiwanis 
Club leadership, Mayor Allen Brown of 
Hinesville, Chairman Donald Lovett of 
Liberty County, and others for joining 
me in recognizing these fantastic peo-
ple. 
Every day we work to ensure a better 
future, and the Kiwanis Club of Liberty 
County is helping us to guarantee just 
that. 
f 
RACISM IS UNACCEPTABLE 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
the head of the NFL said that racism of 
any kind is unacceptable. 
Having worked on these issues since 
the very beginning of my tenure in the 
United 
States 
Congress, 
including 
hearings in Houston on brain injuries 
that were undiagnosed, I take a special 
interest in the Brian Flores lawsuit for 
the reality that it means something is 
wrong and it must be changed. 
Yesterday, 
I 
honored 
a 
Houston 
Texan who had a great history. Today, 
as I tweeted early this morning, the va-
cancy should be filled by Lovie Smith, 
an African American, a coach for the 
Houston Texans. Later today they an-
nounced that Lovie Smith will be the 
new coach. With experience having 
taken the Chicago team to the Super 
Bowl, could it be anyone else? 
Now, we need to begin to assess how 
we can act on the words ‘‘racism is un-
acceptable’’ in any sport in any part of 
America’s life. 
I am excited. Congratulations to 
Coach Smith and to the Houston Tex-
ans. But let us acknowledge David 
Culley and go forward so that the ex-
ample can be across the landscape of 
sports wherever it is and across the Na-
tion. 
f 
REMEMBERING SERGEANT CHRIS 
JENKINS 
(Mr. BURCHETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, I 
rise tonight with a heavy heart as the 
citizens of my district and, especially, 
Loudon County mourn the loss of Ser-
geant Chris Jenkins, a military vet-
eran and long-time member of the 
Loudon County Sheriff’s Office. 
Sergeant Jenkins was killed last 
week. He was hit by an intoxicated 
driver behind the wheel of a semitruck. 
His life was cut way too short, but the 
impact he had on his community will 
live on long into the future. 
Sergeant Jenkins served with honor, 
proudly going to work every day in 
service to others and knowing that any 
day he could be asked to make the ulti-
mate sacrifice. 
Today, I had the privilege of speak-
ing on the phone with Sergeant Jen-
kins’ sweet mother, Faye, and his son 
Clay, who is also a Loudon County 
Sheriff’s deputy. Many of my friends in 
the Chamber know that those are the 
hardest calls to make. 
To me, our servicemembers and first 
responders are all heroes. But talking 
to mothers like Faye, Madam Speaker, 
you are reminded that these heroes are 
so much more: they are mothers and 
fathers, sons and daughters, brothers 
and sisters. 
So, Madam Speaker, I ask that my 
colleagues join me in honoring the life 
and service of Sergeant Chris Jenkins 
and offer up a prayer tonight that his 
family find some comfort in their loss.

BUTLER COUNTY COMMUNITY 
COLLEGE AT ARMSTRONG CAMPUS 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, earlier this month I 
visited Butler County Community Col-
lege at Armstrong campus. This com-
munity college is one of the six cam-
puses in the BC3 community. 
BC3 at Armstrong is the newest 
branch and opened to students in 2015. 
The college is currently preparing for 
an expansion which will spur economic 
growth and expand education access to 
underrepresented communities. 
This 15,000-square-foot state-of-the- 
art facility will provide current and fu-
ture students additional educational 
opportunities. 
Students currently enrolled can take 
classes leading to an associate’s degree 
in 
business 
administration, 
psy-
chology, and general studies. With this 
expansion, BC3 at Armstrong plans to 
introduce noncredit workforce develop-
ment opportunities as well as associate 
degree career programs in technical 
fields. 
The educational paths provided by 
BC3 at Armstrong focus on learning to 
earn, ultimately equipping their stu-
dents with the skills needed to enter 
the workforce immediately upon grad-
uation. 
It is the efforts of educational insti-
tutions like Butler County Community 
College that provide high-quality, af-
fordable education, giving our next 
generation of learners more opportuni-
ties to succeed. 
f 
PUTIN AGGRESSION 
CATASTROPHIC TO RUSSIA 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
Putin 
continues 
threatening 
military 
aggression 
against 
Ukraine, 
now 
over 
100,000 
troops, which would only enrich Putin 
cronies and oligarchs, and which would 
be catastrophic for the people of Rus-
sia. A Putin invasion would result in 
needless and horrific loss of both 
Ukrainian and Russian lives. 
Having returned from a recent dele-
gation to Kyiv, I saw firsthand the 
courage of the people of Ukraine for 
independence. 
Putin should know that both parties 
in America are united in support of the 
Ukrainian people. NATO is also unified 
as Chancellor Olaf Scholz promised 
today.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H998 
February 7, 2022 
I am grateful that Biden has changed 
course to reinforce the Trump policies 
of 
sending 
defensive 
weapons 
to 
Ukraine. 
Putin aggression against Ukraine 
must be deterred for the benefit of the 
people of Russia and the people of 
Ukraine. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
who successfully protected America for 
20 years, as the global war on terrorism 
continues moving from a safe haven in 
Afghanistan to America.

ANALYZE TREATMENT PROTOCOLS 
FOR COVID–19 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
would like to address the COVID pan-
demic. A lot of people are kind of bored 
and tired of hearing about it, but with 
2,000 lives lost a day, we shouldn’t keep 
our eye off the ball. 
It seems to be most of the focus or 
time spent is on masks, government 
shutdowns, and vaccines. But some 
doctors in my district feel that the 
treatment, once people get to the hos-
pital, is to blame. I hope our special 
committee looks at the treatment peo-
ple get in the hospital, analyzing 
remdesivir and its cost of well over 
$3,000 
a 
day, 
to 
ivermectin 
and 
hydroxychloroquine, together with the 
shortage of monoclonal antibodies. 
Doctors in my district feel tens of 
thousands, if not hundreds of thou-
sands, of lives could be saved if people 
were given something else once they 
got in the hospital. And just because 
that may not be as sexy or interesting, 
I think it is something our special sub-
committee ought to take up and see if 
they can save some lives. It might take 
some standing up to the pharma-
ceutical industry. 
f 
BIDEN’S ENERGY CRISIS 
(Mr. ROSE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, we are in 
the middle of the coldest season of the 
year, which means Tennesseans and 
Americans across the country are turn-
ing up their thermostats. Unfortu-
nately, the price of staying warm has 
skyrocketed after 1 year under the 
Biden administration. Americans are 
paying an average of 32 percent more 
for their heating costs compared to 
last year. 
Most households are paying between 
$700 and $1,700 more this year to heat 
their homes. This drastic rise in prices 
is not a shock to the Biden administra-
tion. Back in October, the U.S. Energy 
Information Administration predicted 
that this winter Americans would pay 
approximately 30 percent more for nat-
ural gas, which is the most common re-
source for heating our homes. 
That prediction did not stop Presi-
dent Biden and far-left Democrats from 
pushing radical energy policies, such as 
pausing new oil and natural gas leases 
on public lands for several months, and 
implementing senseless restrictions on 
the oil and gas industry that decreased 
our Nation’s overall supply. 
President Biden needs to change his 
energy policies before we are plunged 
into an even deeper crisis. 
f 
THIN BLUE LINE MASK 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, this 
last week, a 13-year-old young man was 
verbally berated in his school class-
room in Grass Valley, California, in my 
district, by a substitute math teacher, 
all because he was wearing a mask that 
had the thin blue line on it, which is 
known all over the country and inter-
nationally as being the one symbol 
that supports law enforcement. 
The flag—it is an American flag 
adapted to that—is a sign that just 
shows support for our law enforcement, 
who we know protect us from chaos 
and anarchy, and they help uphold 
ideals of justice, freedom, bravery, and 
solidarity. 
The boy’s father and stepmother are 
members of law enforcement, so it is 
natural that he would be wearing that 
mask, not only in general for law en-
forcement but for his parents. Then we 
have a grown adult in a classroom set-
ting who attacks this boy because he 
says he wants to compare this to the 
new Confederate flag. It is ridiculous. 
He berated a child. 
We are all raised to respect law en-
forcement, and this is what is going on 
in the classroom. I commend the school 
district for not bringing that sub-
stitute teacher back anymore. 
Hang in there young man and your 
parents.

HONORING CONGRESSWOMAN 
SHIRLEY CHISHOLM 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
BUSH). Under the Speaker’s announced 
policy of January 4, 2021, the gentle-
woman from California (Ms. LEE) is 
recognized for 60 minutes as the des-
ignee of the majority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members have 5 legislative days to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
include any extraneous material on the 
subject of the Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, first of all, I would like to 
thank our Congressional Black Caucus 
chair, Congresswoman JOYCE BEATTY, 
for her tremendous leadership and for 
giving us this Special Order hour on be-
half of the Congressional Black Caucus 
to honor my mentor, one of the found-
ing members of the Congressional 
Black Caucus, the late Congresswoman 
Shirley Anita St. Hill Chisholm. And 
to Congresswoman BEATTY, I just want 
to say how proud we are, and how bold 
she has led this caucus by demanding 
that everyone really understand our 
power, and our message. Tonight is no 
exception. 
And, 
in 
fact, 
Congress-
woman Chisholm, I am sure, is very 
proud of the leadership of Congress-
woman BEATTY. 
As the first African-American woman 
elected to Congress in 1968—I want you 
to listen to this—the first Congress 
convened in 1789 and the first Black 
woman elected to Congress was in 1968. 
That was Congresswoman Shirley Chis-
holm. She was also the first African 
American and woman to seek the Pres-
idency. 
Shirley Chisholm has truly cemented 
her place in history as a trailblazer. I 
first met Congresswoman Chisholm be-
cause of a college assignment at Mills 
College in Oakland, California. My gov-
ernment professor assigned us to do 
field work on a Presidential campaign. 
At the time, several men were vying 
for the Democratic nomination, but 
they didn’t speak to the issues that I 
cared about. I was a young, single mom 
on public assistance, and their plat-
forms did not include issues that re-
lated to me or my community, like 
childcare, public education, universal 
healthcare, and ending poverty. 
So, of course, even though I had 
never flunked a class in my life, I de-
cided to get an F in this class because 
I could not bring myself to work for 
these candidates. 
Now, I didn’t believe these candidates 
could see me or had seen my commu-
nity in terms of our needs. So I invited 
Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm to 
Mills College. I did not know she was 
running for the Presidency, but I in-
vited her to address the Black Student 
Union because I was president of the 
Black Student Union. I had no idea she 
was running for President. 
In her speech, she stood up for chil-
dren and struggling working families. 
She spoke out against racism and 
sexism. She was against the Vietnam 
war. She advocated for what she knew 
was right, undeterred by criticism and 
without fear of the consequences. 
As soon as she finished her speech, I 
went up to talk to her to tell her about 
this class I was about to flunk, and she 
took me to task. She asked me if I was 
registered to vote. And I said: No. I ad-
mitted that I wasn’t going to do much 
in politics because I didn’t believe in 
the two-party system and its relation-
ship to my needs and my community. 
She said: Little girl, you can’t 
change the system if you are on the 
outside looking in. Register to vote. 
And from that moment on, I ended up 
working in her northern California

We organized her northern California 
campaign out of my class at Mills Col-
lege, and the rest is history. I went on

power and our message, and then I will 
return and yield to my colleagues after

and yielding tonight to let Congress-
woman BARBARA LEE open up this spe-
cial session on Shirley Chisholm. 
Before I make just a few brief re-
marks, let me just say, as we just 
heard Congresswoman BARBARA
LEE 
say, as Shirley Chisholm referred to 
her as ‘‘that little girl,’’ oh, how proud 
she would be today knowing that little 
girl is now the woman that we say, 
‘‘BARBARA LEE speaks for me.’’ 
She is the woman that spearheaded 
putting Shirley Chisholm’s face on a 
stamp. And every day Congresswoman 
BARBARA LEE, through her stellar and 
magnificent leadership, guides us in 
the footsteps of Shirley Chisholm. Cer-
tainly, she is unbought and unbossed. 
So to you, Congresswoman BARBARA 
LEE, I say thank you for allowing us to 
stand on your shoulders. Thank you for 
when you walk in the room, whether it 
is steering in policy, whether it is Ap-
propriations or any of the other com-
mittees, you always carry members 
with you. And that is what Shirley 
Chisholm has done for this Nation. 
And so now, let me say what you will 
hear repeatedly tonight: The first 
Black woman elected to the United 
States Congress, you will hear that she 
is the first Black woman to seek nomi-
nation as President of these United 
States from one of the two major polit-
ical powers. Certainly, she left us a leg-
acy that lives on; a legacy that we are 
so proud of. 
What I would like to say to everyone 
watching, Madam Speaker, especially 
for mothers and daughters, think of 
what it must have been like to stand in 
the Halls of justice where we are stand-
ing today, where she was standing 
alone. Think what it must have been 
like for her when she stood on that 
Democratic national floor at that con-
vention, giving such a powerful speech, 
far ahead of her time when she held up 
those two fingers that we see so often, 
and that we today stand on her shoul-
ders. 
Lastly, Madam Speaker, it gives me 
a great privilege to walk these Halls of 
Congress and to be the chair of the 
Congressional Black Caucus. When I 
walk down the Halls of justice, I say to 
Congresswoman SHEILA JACKSON LEE, 
that I think about standing on the 
shoulders of Barbara Jordan. I think 
about what it was like to have a Shir-
ley Chisholm and a Barbara Jordan. 
But then, Madam Speaker, I know 
what it is like, it is having a BARBARA 
LEE and a SHEILA JACKSON LEE, and 
that is what tonight is about. 
When I walk by that life-sized por-
trait of Congresswoman Shirley Chis-
holm, I think about her courage. I 
think about her leadership. I think 
about what we will tell every little 
Black girl in America. You too can be 
a Shirley Chisholm. You too can stand 
up for justice. You too can be in the 
fight representing the people who need 
us the most. 
In conclusion, I say the two most 
powerful words that I was taught to 
say, and that is thank you. Thank you 
to these Halls of Congress for letting us 
have a Shirley Chisholm. Thank you 
members of the Congressional Black 
Caucus for coming out tonight to 
honor her great legacy because it is not 
just about this Special Order hour to-
night. It is about our future. It is about 
how we continue to live the legacy of 
Shirley Chisholm. 
Ms. LEE of California. Let me first 
say to our chair that our power and our 
message is exactly what the gentle-
woman has delivered tonight. And I 
just want to thank her for her very 
gracious remarks and just know that I 
know Congresswoman Shirley Chis-
holm is proud of her leadership and 
proud of the fact that although she was 
one in 1968, I believe we have—what—25 
bold, brilliant Black women in the 
Congressional Black Caucus. 
Thank you again for giving us a 
chance to honor her tonight and for 
your leadership. 
I now yield to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JOHNSON), the chair of the 
Committee on Science, Space, and 
Technology. I have been here since 
1998, and she took to me and explained 
to me why, and I was on the Com-
mittee on Science, Space, and Tech-
nology when I first came to Congress, 
and I learned so much from her and 
have really just honored her for help-
ing us navigate as Black women in this 
institution. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman so 
very much for her comments. I am 
truly proud to stand tonight with our 
leader of this hour, as well as the lead-
er of our Caucus to pay tribute to Shir-
ley Chisholm. 
Just a little over 50 years ago today, 
in a 1972 speech announcing her can-
didacy for President, Congresswoman 
Shirley Chisholm said: 
I am not the candidate of Black America, 
although I am Black and proud. 
I am not the candidate of the women’s 
movement of this country, although I am a 
woman, and I am equally proud of that. 
I am the candidate of the people of Amer-
ica and my presence before you now symbol-
izes a new era in American political history. 
b 2015 
Here was a Black woman from Brook-
lyn, New York, of Guyanese and Bajan 
descent, born to a burlap worker and a 
seamstress, boldly declaring a new era 
in American politics. 
But despite her best efforts, Con-
gresswoman Chisholm knew that the 
outcome of her candidacy was pre-
ordained. 
At the time, our country was still 
learning to accept Black people and 
women as equal citizens—that is the 
year I was first elected to my first 
elected office—much less electing them 
as President of the United States. 
Nevertheless, she persisted. 
She held an unwavering faith in our 
common humanity, even when our 
common humanity did not hold the 
same faith in her. It was that same 
faith that drove her campaign. 
She transcended political norms by 
bringing the issues of gender and racial 
equity to the national stage. 
She highlighted and reinforced the 
importance of diversity at the table of 
public discourse. 
And she shattered any preconceived 
notions about Black women in public 
service, particularly in politics. 
Building on her work as the first 
Black woman elected to Congress, she 
blazed the trail and the torch of 
progress for many of us who have fol-
lowed. 
Today, the Congressional Black Cau-
cus, which she helped establish, has 27 
women from districts across the coun-
try. I think I speak on behalf of all of 
us when I say that we would not be 
here today if not for her life and leg-
acy. 
So as we celebrate Black History 
Month and the 50th anniversary of her 
Presidential campaign and the 51st an-
niversary of the Congressional Black 
Caucus, let Congresswoman Chisholm’s 
story serve as a reminder that equality 
and justice are the responsibility of 
every generation, and it is our turn. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to 
thank the Congressional Black Caucus 
and our distinguished leader, BARBARA 
LEE, for offering us this opportunity. 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank very much Congress-
woman EDDIE
BERNICE
JOHNSON
for 
that powerful statement and also re-
minding us of her humble beginnings. 
She also, when she came to Congress, 
championed the rights of domestic 
workers and of low-income people. It 
was in her soul and in her spirit. She 
turned her vision into legislation here 
and was an excellent legislator who 
never lost touch with who she was. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE), the co-chair of our Special Order, 
another greater leader from the State 
of Texas, and, as Chairwoman BEATTY 
said, a fighter for justice on a lot of 
fronts.

February 7, 2022 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia, as always, for reminding us in 
almost every moment of her tenure 
here in the United States Congress of 
the spirit and the investment that 
Shirley Chisholm made in her person-
ally and the investment that she made 
as a young college student, saying that 
I am going to find Shirley Chisholm or 
accept the call and be in her Presi-
dential election. What a historic mo-
ment for her. 
Also, the very pathway that she has 
taken in the United States Congress is 
evidence that she is definitely a living 
example of the fighting spirit of Shir-
ley Chisholm. 
It is great to be here to acknowledge 
this 50th commemoration of this his-
toric moment. I thank our chair, the 
Honorable JOYCE BEATTY, for remind-
ing us of Our Power, Our Message. I 
would like to say our message, our 
power, and to recognize that the Con-
gressional Black Caucus is the pace-
setter for justice and equality and the 
elimination of racism, which still lifts 
its head today. 
To my other colleagues that are here 
today, I am grateful for their presence 
on the floor, for Shirley Chisholm de-
serves the recognition and the ac-
knowledgment of who she was but also 
what she did and what she invested in 
America. 
Let it be known that even as she was 
an African-American woman, she was a 
great American that made differences 
that can be seen today. 
I want to honor and acknowledge the 
shoulders upon which I stand. That in-
cludes, in our Congress, Shirley Chis-
holm, John Conyers, John Lewis, Ron 
Dellums, and Barbara Jordan. 
I also want to acknowledge my par-
ents, Ivalita ‘‘Ivy’’ Jackson, a voca-
tional nurse, and Ezra C. Jackson, one 
of the first African Americans to suc-
ceed in the aftermath of being dis-
criminated against in the comic book 
industry. 
All of that pours into the work of 
Shirley Chisholm and her campaign 
slogan in this, her congressional dis-
trict race in 1968: ‘‘Fighting Shirley 
Chisholm: Unbought and Unbossed.’’ 
That continued throughout her life. 
She remarked that women in this 
country must become revolutionaries, 
that we must refuse to accept the old, 
traditional roles and stereotypes. 
This is a sentiment that I take to 
heart myself and that the women of 
the Congressional Black Caucus have 
taken to heart. We have told the Na-
tion that we must have self-determina-
tion. We want to lead. Shirley Chis-
holm was at the core of the movement 
of women leading. That is why, on Jan-
uary 25, 1972, Shirley announced her 
candidacy. 
She stood before the cameras, and in 
the beginning of her speech, she said— 
before I say these words, let me be very 
clear. There weren’t thousands of peo-
ple. There may not have been hundreds 
and hundreds of people. I can tell you 
there was a bounty of skeptics, people 
standing back and saying: This is un-
imaginable. Why would she do this? We 
don’t need her to do this. She is getting 
in the way. 
I am grateful that Shirley Chisholm, 
fighting Shirley Chisholm, unbought 
and unbossed, maintained the dignity 
of the right of a Black woman, an 
American, to run for the Presidency of 
the United States. 
So, she said: ‘‘I stand before you 
today as a candidate for the Demo-
cratic nomination for the Presidency of 
the United States.’’ 
How sweet those words are. 
‘‘I am not the candidate of Black 
America, although I am Black and 
proud. I am not the candidate of the 
women’s movement of this country, al-
though I am a woman and I am equally 
proud of that. I am not the candidate 
of any political’’—bosses—‘‘or special 
interests. . . . I am the candidate of 
the people.’’ 
We keep that in mind, this Congress, 
the Democratic Members of Congress. 
The Congressional Black Caucus must 
keep in mind that we are the can-
didates, the spokespersons of the peo-
ple, that it is their truth that we must 
tell. Shirley Chisholm always told 
their truth. 
She did not win the nomination, but 
she went on to the Democratic Conven-
tion in Miami and received 151 votes. 
We know that the Vice President of 
the United States, KAMALA
HARRIS, 
stands on the shoulders of Shirley 
Chisholm. The women today that are 
elected across America, in all different 
positions, stand on the shoulders of 
Shirley Chisholm. 
We 
recognize 
that 
barriers 
still 
stand. One that we hope will be cor-
rected in this month, Black History 
Month, in Shirley Chisholm’s fighting 
spirit, is that an African-American 
woman, a Black woman, will be nomi-
nated to the United States Supreme 
Court. 
We want more than that as well. We 
want an age-old bill that has been lan-
guishing for so long, H.R. 40, the Com-
mission to Study and Develop Repara-
tion Proposals for African Americans 
Act, that Congresswoman Chisholm 
would have been on. We want it to be 
pronounced and announced this month. 
As we honor her tonight, fighting 
Shirley Chisholm, let me acknowledge 
the different poses, the different lead-
ership, as she has stood for the people 
of Brooklyn, but the people of America. 
That is the face of a fighting woman, 
and that is the face of the person we 
honor tonight. 
I am delighted to be here with my 
colleague, who has always put Shirley 
Chisholm in the forefront of our think-
ing, of how progressive and innovative 
and powerful and strong and empow-
ering—I want to leave you with that. 
She believed in empowering others and 
understood the words of Martin Luther 
King: Injustice anywhere is injustice 
everywhere. 
Shirley 
Chisholm 
was 
ahead of her time. 
Shirley Chisholm is to be honored 
every day, as my colleague said, as we 
walk through these Halls. I look up and 
see Barbara Jordan, and then I look up 
and see Shirley Chisholm, unbought 
and unbossed. Honor her tonight and 
always. 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank very much Congress-
woman SHEILA JACKSON LEE for that 
very comprehensive statement about 
our 
shero, 
Congresswoman 
Shirley 
Chisholm. 
Congresswoman 
JACKSON 
LEE certainly is the epitome of who she 
was. 
I am so happy that she raised some of 
the issues and some of her quotes be-
cause she told me personally: BARBARA, 
these rules and policies weren’t made 
for you and I. 
She said: Don’t go along to get along. 
She said: If you get behind these 
closed doors in any capacity, you have 
to fight to change the rules of the 
game. You have to fight the systemic 
issues. Don’t tinker around the edges. 
I say that because, once again, when 
I started, I mentioned the fact that the 
first Congress was held in 1789, right? 
Shirley Chisholm was elected in 1968. 
Our country lost so much during that 
period because there were no Black 
women right here in this House of Rep-
resentatives. 
We have to always remember the 
power of the moment when Shirley was 
elected to Congress and then running 
for President. 
Congresswoman LUCY
MCBATH, an-
other trailblazer who has shattered a 
heck of a lot of glass ceilings, first of 
all, and who has been bold and deter-
mined and persistent in making her 
community and this country a better 
place, I am so glad that she is with us 
tonight. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Georgia (Mrs. MCBATH). 
Mrs. MCBATH. Madam Speaker, I 
want to thank so much my esteemed 
colleague BARBARA LEE, who speaks for 
me tonight, and also SHEILA JACKSON 
LEE. I thank them both so much for 
leading us in this commemoration to-
night of our shero Shirley Chisholm. I 
am also grateful for the words that 
were spoken earlier by our leader, our 
shero of the Congressional Black Cau-
cus, JOYCE BEATTY. 
Black History Month is a time for us 
to commemorate all of those who came 
before us and to celebrate those who 
helped pave the path of progress that 
we find ourselves on today. 
Shirley Chisholm is truly one of 
those trailblazers. She was a woman 
who lived her truth and told her story 
boldly time and time again. She was a 
trailblazer ahead of her time who had a 
deep and lasting impact on our commu-
nities, on our country, and, most spe-
cifically, on communities of color. 
It is not hard today to see that very 
impact. We now have a new generation 
of leaders who are shaping the policy of 
this Nation’s future, who looked to the 
past and continue to look to leaders 
like Shirley Chisholm to see all the

places we still need to go. Yes, we have 
a long way to go. 
Young women around the world, and 
especially young women of color, have 
been forever inspired by her example, 
with all the barriers that she broke 
down. It can be easy to forget all that 
she did, all that she helped to build. 
Shirley 
was 
instrumental 
in 
strengthening voting rights; she was a 
force in demanding women’s rights; 
and she was a leader in the fight for 
civil rights. 
It was the way that she worked all 
those years ago that has shown time 
and time again why we must continue 
these very same fights today. 
In my home State of Georgia, we are 
at the forefront of the fight for voting 
rights once again. We are, again, fight-
ing against attempts at the worst voter 
suppression we have seen since Jim 
Crow. At a time when our voting rights 
are under attack, we must once again 
lead in the efforts to protect these very 
sacred rights. 
b 2030 
So, to all the women of color who 
have followed in Shirley’s footsteps, 
the work you do has never been more 
important. The times have found us, 
and it is in these moments that we 
must continue to rise to this occasion. 
We have been prepared for this mo-
ment, a moment that beckons us to 
fight for equality and strive for justice, 
the equality and the justice that every 
one of us deserves. 
That preparation is because of lead-
ers like Shirley Chisholm, and now be-
cause the leaders of tomorrow grew up 
watching the leaders of yesterday, we 
will continue to make indelible marks 
on the world. 
Because of women like Shirley Chis-
holm, women of color have found their 
own power to stand up and to speak out 
and to advocate for the change that we 
know is possible, but more so the 
change that we know is necessary. 
So, as we continue to follow in the 
footsteps of the giants who came before 
us, as we honor and celebrate the ti-
tans of the movement, I want to thank 
each and every person who wakes up 
every day in this country and does this 
work. Because this work is not easy, 
but changes only ever come from those 
who have brought their lived experi-
ences into these Halls of power. 
For all of you in this Chamber, for 
the brave Black women who have car-
ried this country forward, I want to say 
to each of you, I want to say that the 
work that you are doing as women and 
as women of color has never been more 
important. I want to thank you from 
the bottom of my heart because I 
would not be here had it not been for 
you. 
I want to say how proud I am of each 
of your accomplishments, of your tri-
umphs, and your successes, and I want 
you to remember that we are all doing 
the best that we can and that each day 
God continues to give us new grace. 
As we move forward, we must be cou-
rageous in the fight for justice, human 
rights, and a future that celebrates the 
diversity and the power of who we are 
as a people. 
We should all strive to extend the 
path that Shirley helped build for us to 
follow. We should all strive to be like 
Shirley and be our best. 
Ms. LEE of California. Congress-
woman LUCY MCBATH, I would like to 
share a story with you which reminds 
me of you that happened during Shir-
ley’s campaign because I know your 
district, and I know how you fight each 
and every day to bring people together, 
and how you care about all people, hu-
manity. 
You care about people regardless of 
party affiliation, regardless of back-
ground, and I know that is how you do 
your work, and that is how you are so 
effective as a Black woman. 
During Shirley Chisholm’s campaign, 
George Wallace was running for Presi-
dent also. He was shot and he was hos-
pitalized. He was paralyzed. This is in 
the middle of the campaign. Congress-
woman Chisholm suspended her cam-
paign for a few days, and she went to 
visit that segregationist George Wal-
lace. 
I mean, I was ready to leave. I said 
no, there is no way that my first cam-
paign, this hero—shero of mine is going 
down to see this man who has blocked 
African 
Americans 
from 
going 
to 
school, who has sicced dogs on them, 
who is a horrible human being. 
And so I talked to her and said, ‘‘I 
can’t deal with this, Mrs. Chisholm.’’ I 
was so angry for that decision. And I 
am 
thinking 
of 
Congresswoman 
MCBATH now, I am thinking of the con-
text in which we live in terms of so 
much hate out there because she said 
to me, she said, ‘‘Little girl,’’ even 
though I was a grown woman with two 
little kids, ‘‘Remember, we are all 
human beings. Maybe I can teach him 
something and help him regain his hu-
manity.’’ 
I said, ‘‘Well, he never had any. He 
was a bad man.’’ 
And she went on to say, ‘‘I know you 
are angry. I know people are really 
angry who support me, but you have to 
rise to the occasion if you are a leader, 
and you have to try to break down 
some of these barriers. You have to 
break through and try to enlighten 
other people who may hate you.’’ 
I said, ‘‘No, that is not good enough. 
He will never, ever come around, and I 
am really angry.’’ But she asked me to 
stay on with her campaign, so I be-
grudgingly did. 
But what happened was she was 
able—and I am a good friend with 
George Wallace’s daughter, Peggy Wal-
lace Kennedy, who is a fighter for ra-
cial justice, who is a phenomenal 
woman in Alabama, and she is a good 
friend of mine, and she told me just re-
cently, she said, ‘‘Honey, you know, I 
was at that bedside when Shirley Chis-
holm visited my daddy, and she talked 
to him, and she told him what terrible 
things he had done, and she asked him 
to please, please, please understand 
that Black people deserved justice and 
equality.’’ 
And she didn’t know whether she was 
making an impact on him or not, but 
later—I still say too little, too late—he 
went to Dexter Avenue Baptist Church 
in his wheelchair and rolled down the 
aisle and apologized for all of his mis-
deeds. 
They became friends from afar, and 
he got a lot of the Southern Members 
to sign onto her legislation for domes-
tic workers and for all of her bills that 
she was working on that she needed 
Southern Dixiecrats to support. 
I share that story now because that 
seems like something that we forgot 
how to do. I mean, I know I have. It is 
something that she taught me because 
not only was she responsible for this 
apology—again, too little too late—but 
it showed me that you have got to step 
out of your comfort zone, like you do, 
and hopefully, hopefully see some good 
in people who are your adversaries. 
You were talking, and I wanted to 
share that because I was personally in-
volved with that story. I want to salute 
Peggy Wallace Kennedy tonight be-
cause she has really led a life that has 
been a life of making sure that every 
barrier against African Americans and 
people of color is dismantled in this 
country. Thank you again. 
Mrs. MCBATH. Thank you for shar-
ing that. 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, we will go to another fighter 
who has just come here from the great 
State of Ohio, who has a remarkable 
record fighting for voting rights and 
justice and is a woman who serves her 
community in ways that every Member 
of Congress should serve their commu-
nity, Congresswoman SHONTEL BROWN, 
who I think has been here for years 
now, but she has really hit the ground 
running in her presence on this floor. 
Ms. BROWN of Ohio. Thank you to 
the co-leaders, BARBARA LEE and SHEI-
LA JACKSON LEE, my sisters and col-
leagues. 
Madam Speaker, as we celebrate 
Black History Month, I rise today to 
join my CBC colleagues and my CBC 
sisters in honoring the life and trail-
blazing legacy of Congresswoman Shir-
ley Chisholm. 
Before me, it was her. Before my 
predecessor, HUD Secretary Marcia 
Fudge, it was her. Before the record- 
setting number of 27 Black women in 
Congress today, it was her. 
My career in public service rests on 
the shoulders and the contributions of 
the iconic Shirley Chisholm. In 1969 she 
became a political pioneer and shat-
tered racial and gender barriers by be-
coming the first Black woman elected 
to Congress. 
Her signature slogan, ‘‘unbought and 
unbossed,’’ spoke to her audacity, her 
sheer sense of will, and her fearlessness 
in the face of established norms and in-
stitutions. And it spoke to her rise as 
the people’s politician, someone willing 
to speak up and speak out for those 
embattled by poverty, discrimination, 
and injustice.

H1002 
February 7, 2022 
In Congress, she fought for low-in-
come 
families, 
for 
hungry 
school-
children, and for single moms. She was 
critical to the creation of the national 
school lunch program. She was critical 
to the growth of the Supplemental Nu-
trition Assistance Program, known as 
SNAP, and she was critical to the cre-
ation of the Women, Infants, and Chil-
dren’s program, known as WIC. Then, 
as now, these programs reduce the hun-
ger facing American children and fami-
lies. Today I am proud to carry forth 
her legacy by fighting for their expan-
sion. 
Fifty years ago, Shirley Chisholm 
made history once again by becoming 
the first African American and the 
first woman to run for President. But 
more than being a mere political first, 
Shirley Chisholm is best remembered 
for her grit, her willingness to push on 
the pedal of progress, and her ability to 
not just see America for what it is, but 
for what it could be. 
Chisholm understood the challenges 
women, 
particularly 
Black 
women, 
were facing in America, and she cre-
ated a path for women like me. She 
passed the baton, and now it is up to us 
to continue the race. 
Ms. LEE of California. Let me thank 
you, Congresswoman BROWN, for that 
statement and for your presentation 
and laying out many of Shirley Chis-
holm’s accomplishments. I mean, she 
was a great legislator. She passed the 
1974 minimum wage law, which ex-
panded minimum wage standards to do-
mestic workers and a broader swath of 
government employees, so I am glad 
that you laid that out because so many 
of us and so many especially younger 
African-American women and women 
of color see her as this icon who ran for 
President, first Black woman elected, 
but she was an excellent legislator. 
She used her contacts and leverage, 
and she knew how to leverage the 
folks, as I mentioned George Wallace’s 
people. She understood her power. You 
understand your power, and I am so 
glad that you are here tonight for this 
presentation. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE) for some additional words. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Congresswoman, 
thank you so very much. I wanted to 
offer my appreciation first to you be-
cause I want you to be the last word on 
this floor tonight because I truly mean 
what I said earlier, and in almost every 
moment there has been an anecdotal 
story, a very important one that you 
have reminded us of the strength of 
Shirley Chisholm. 
I do want to go back to Shirley’s Car-
ibbean roots, but her strong roots in 
Brooklyn. I know that you said this, or 
I am sure it has been referred to or you 
will, is that when she came to the 
United States Congress, being the first 
African-American woman and being 
dismissed not by her constituents, but 
by the hierarchy that was here, and I 
am sure someone with a little chuckle 
thought: Brooklyn, urban, guess where 
we will put her? On the Agriculture 
Committee. And that will get her pack-
ing up and running out. 
But Shirley Chisholm, again, fighting 
Shirley 
Chisholm 
was 
her 
theme, 
showed them. I remember those words 
either said by her or describe her, a 
tree grows in Brooklyn. Don’t sell us 
short. A tree grows in Queens, a tree 
grows in Manhattan, a tree grows in 
New York. 
She did take to the leadership of the 
Agriculture Committee, particularly 
becoming an expert on SNAP and many 
other aspects of agriculture that really 
dealt with the vulnerable and starving 
people in America. That was Shirley 
Chisholm. 
And then as I intertwine the question 
of the selection and nomination of an 
African-American woman to the United 
States Supreme Court, I want to put in 
the RECORD the words, if you are al-
ways ruled but denied the opportunity 
to rule, in turn, you are simply a sub-
ject and not fully a citizen. And so 
Congresswoman Chisholm’s presence 
was to deny being only ruled and sim-
ply being a subject. 
The cases that spoke to that are the 
Supreme Court decisions like Dred 
Scott v. Sandford, Plessy v. Ferguson, 
Korematsu 
v. 
United 
States, 
civil 
rights cases in 1883, Bowers v. Hard-
wick, Lochner v. New York, and Buck 
v. Bell. These cases from 1857 to 1927 all 
showed where America was in terms of 
this cancer called racism. 
I want to refer us tonight in my final 
words on the floor in tribute to Shirley 
Chisholm to the words she said about 
do women dare. As I do so, with a little 
bit of sense of great honor is to show a 
picture of myself and Shirley Chisholm 
that I now found and relocated and will 
actually get framed, my presenting her 
with an award after a speech that she 
gave in front of the Black women law-
yers. When we were few, unknown, and 
unlisted and probably unappreciated, 
she actually came to speak before the 
Black women lawyers in Houston, 
Texas, having some years before that 
worked as an intern in her district at 
one of the State representatives’ of-
fices, Representative Bellamy. 
b 2045 
And I might say, as I talk about 
Shirley, I have to put on the record 
that she was selected for the Agri-
culture Committee, but I am told by 
my former colleague, Pat Schroeder, 
that when she and Ron Dellums went 
to the Armed Services Committee, 
they were given one chair. And they 
had to sit in one chair because they 
were trying to diminish them and dis-
miss them. They could not do that. 
And though this is not about Ron Del-
lums, he became the chair of the 
Armed Services Committee. 
But let me give these words in con-
clusion on the fighting Shirley Chis-
holm. This is her speech ‘‘Do Women 
Dare,’’ and it just has been discovered. 
‘‘The topic this morning of course is, 
‘do women dare?’ ’’ 
These are her words. 
‘‘And I have said, of course women 
dare. Do women dare? I assume that 
the question implies do women dare 
take an active part in society, and, in 
particular, do they dare to take a part 
in the present social revolution?’’ 
We need this now more than ever. 
And I would say, Do Americans dare? 
Do men and women dare? Do African 
Americans dare? Do vulnerable people 
dare? 
‘‘And I find the question as much of 
an insult as I would the question, ‘Are 
you, as a Black person, willing to fight 
for your rights?’ America has been suf-
ficiently sensitized to the answer, 
whether or not Black people are willing 
to both fight and die for their rights. 
To make the question itself is asinine 
and superfluous. America is not yet 
sufficiently aware, but such a question 
applied to women is equally asinine 
and superfluous.’’ 
And so she goes on to say: ‘‘I am, as 
is obvious, both Black and a woman. 
And that is a good vantage point from 
which to view at least two elements of 
what is becoming a social revolution. 
The American Black revolution and 
the women’s liberation movement. But 
it is also a horrible disadvantage. It is 
a disadvantage, my friends, because 
America as a Nation, is both racist and 
antifeminist. Racism and antifeminism 
are two of the prime traditions of this 
country that we have to face objec-
tively. For any individual, therefore, 
challenging social traditions is a giant 
step. A giant step, because there are no 
social traditions which do not have 
corresponding social sanctions, the sole 
purpose of which are to protect the 
sanctity of the traditions.’’ 
And so she goes on to talk about do 
women dare. I cannot think of more 
important words in 2022 as we fight 
against racism and sexism, as we fight 
to give a sense of reality and honesty 
and equality to the idea of a Black 
woman going to the Supreme Court. 
And as we raise up the issue of the 
study of slavery and the development 
of reparation proposals under H.R. 40, 
can that be a simple, obvious reality? 
Can that be something that is just ac-
cepted because it is right? 
Shirley Chisholm has taught us to 
keep fighting and to dare. I thank the 
gentlewoman for bringing us to this 
place and also to this understanding. 
Madam Speaker, this February we recog-
nize and celebrate the 44th commemoration of 
Black History Month and the Jubilee anniver-
sary of Shirley Chisolm’s historic run for the 
presidency in 1972. 
I am honored to co-anchor this Congres-
sional Black Caucus Special Order with my 
dear friend and colleague, Congresswoman 
BARBARA LEE of California. 
This month we celebrate the contributions of 
African Americans to the history of our great 
Nation, and pay tribute to trailblazers, pio-
neers, heroes, and leaders like KAMALA D. 
HARRIS, the 49th Vice-President of the United 
States and the first woman and person of 
color to be elected to the office; 44th Presi-
dent of the United States and First Lady,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1003 
February 7, 2022 
Barack Obama and Michelle Obama, respec-
tively; Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.; Su-
preme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall; U.S. 
Senator Blanche Kelso Bruce; U.S. Congress-
woman Barbara Jordan; U.S. Congressman 
Mickey Leland; Astronauts Dr. Guion Stewart 
Bluford, Jr. and Mae C. Jemison; activists, in-
tellectuals, authors, artists, and entrepreneurs 
like Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Wash-
ington, James Baldwin, Harriet Tubman, Rosa 
Parks, Maya Angelou, Toni Morrison, Gwen-
dolyn Brooks, Shonda Rhimes, Ava Duvernay, 
Oprah Winfrey, and Super Bowl LIV winning 
quarterback Patrick Mahomes and National 
Football League Most Valuable Player Lamar 
Jackson, just to name a few of the countless 
number of well-known and unsung heroes 
whose contributions have helped our Nation 
become a more perfect union. 
The history of the United States has been 
marked by the great contributions of African 
American activists, leaders, writers, and art-
ists. 
As a member of Congress, I know that I 
stand on the shoulders of giants like Shirley 
Chisolm, John Conyers, John Lewis, Ronald 
Dellums, and Barbara Jordan whose struggles 
and triumphs made it possible for me to stand 
here today and continue the fight for equality, 
justice, and progress for all, regardless of 
race, religion, gender, or sexual orientation. 
The greatest of these giants to me are Mrs. 
Ivalita ‘‘Ivy’’ Jackson, a vocational nurse, and 
Mr. Ezra C. Jackson, one of the first African 
Americans to succeed in the comic book pub-
lishing business. 
They were my beloved parents, and they 
taught me the value of education, hard work, 
discipline, perseverance, and caring for others. 
And I am continually inspired by Dr. Elwyn 
Lee, my husband and the first tenured African 
American law professor at the University of 
Houston. 
Madam Speaker, I particularly wish to ac-
knowledge the contributions of African Amer-
ican veterans in defending from foreign ag-
gressors and who by their courageous exam-
ples helped transform our Nation from a seg-
regated society to a nation committed to the 
never-ending challenge of perfecting our 
union. 
Several years ago about this time, I was 
honored to join my then colleagues Congress-
men John Lewis and former Congressman 
Charles Rangel, a Korean War veteran, in 
paying tribute to surviving members of the 
Tuskegee Airmen and the 555th Parachute In-
fantry, the famed ‘‘Triple Nickels’’ at a moving 
ceremony sponsored by the U.S. Army com-
memorating the 50th anniversary of the 1964 
Civil Rights Act. 
The success of the Tuskegee Airmen in es-
corting bombers during World War II—achiev-
ing one of the lowest loss records of all the 
escort fighter groups and being in constant de-
mand for their services by the allied bomber 
units—is a record unmatched by any other 
fighter group. 
So impressive and astounding were the 
feats of the Tuskegee Airmen that in 1948, it 
helped persuade President Harry Truman to 
issue his famous Executive Order No. 9981, 
which directed equality of treatment and op-
portunity in all of the United States Armed 
Forces and led to the end of racial segrega-
tion in the U.S. military forces. 
They proved that ‘‘the antidote to racism is 
excellence in performance,’’ as retired Lt. Col. 
Herbert Carter once remarked. 
It is a source of enormous and enduring 
pride that my father-in-law, Phillip Ferguson 
Lee, was one of the Tuskegee Airmen. 
Madam Speaker, Black History Month is 
also a time to remember many pioneering 
women like activists Harriet Tubman and Rosa 
Parks; astronaut Mae C. Jemison; mathemati-
cians like Katherine G. Johnson, Dorothy 
Vaughan, and Mary Jackson; authors Maya 
Angelou, Toni Morrison, and Gwendolyn 
Brooks; all of whom have each in their own 
way, whether through courageous activism, 
cultural or intellectual contributions, or artistic 
creativity, forged social and political change, 
and forever changed our great Nation for the 
better. 
Madam Speaker, it is particularly fitting and 
proper this evening to remember and cele-
brate the 50th anniversary of the historic and 
audacious campaign for President of the late 
U.S. Congresswoman Shirley Anita St. Hill 
Chisholm. 
Shirley Chisholm became the first African 
American woman elected to Congress, when 
she was elected to represent the New York’s 
Twelfth Congressional District in 1968 running 
on the slogan, ‘‘Fightinq Shirley Chisholm: 
Unbought and Unbossed.’’ 
She reflected that spirit well during her 14 
years in Congress. 
During her first term she spoke out for civil 
rights, women’s rights, the poor and against 
the Vietnam War. 
Her first term in Congress was set against 
the backdrop of the Civil Rights Movement 
and the women’s movement for equal rights. 
Shirley Chisolm had an understanding that 
during those turbulent times the Nation re-
quired a determined leader to represent the 
voice of so many Americans who felt dismay 
at their treatment. 
She took an extremely active role in chang-
ing the way women were to be judged from 
that point on. 
She remarked that ‘‘Women in this country 
must become revolutionaries. We must refuse 
to accept the old, the traditional roles and 
stereotypes.’’ 
This is a sentiment that I myself take to 
heart, women in this Nation are now told they 
have a right to determine the kind of life they 
want to lead; Shirley Chisholm was at the core 
of this movement. 
On January 25, 1972, Chisholm announced 
her candidacy for President. 
She stood before the cameras and in the 
beginning of her speech she said: 
‘‘I stand before you today as a candidate for 
the Democratic nomination for the Presidency 
of the United States. 
‘‘I am not the candidate of black America, 
although I am black and proud. 
‘‘I am not the candidate of the women’s 
movement of this country, although I am a 
woman, and I am equally proud of that. I am 
not the candidate of any political bosses or 
special interests. 
‘‘I am the candidate of the people.’’ 
Shirley Chisholm did not win the nomination; 
but she went on to the Democratic Convention 
in Miami and received 151 delegates’ votes. 
More than that, she demonstrated the will 
and determination of so many Americans, par-
ticularly black women, who had previously felt 
forgotten, and she lit the fire inspiring so many 
who had felt disenfranchised. 
I am glad to walk in their footsteps and will 
continue to encourage women to uphold the 
principles they taught us to fight for and cher-
ish. 
Madam Speaker, because Shirley Chisolm 
dared to reach for the brass ring 50 years 
ago, she ushered in the era where women 
could aspire, seek, and win leadership roles in 
this country’s local, State, and national gov-
ernments. 
Before Shirley Chisolm, no black woman 
had ever served in the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives or the U.S. Senate, but following 
in her footsteps are 51 black women Members 
of Congress, two black women U.S. Senators, 
including the President of that body and Vice- 
President of the United States; 23 Hispanic 
members; and 15 Asian-Pacific Members, 
along with the first woman Speaker of the 
House, and mayors of several of the largest 
cities in the Nation, including the District of 
Columbia, Chicago, San Francisco, Atlanta, 
New 
Orleans, 
Baltimore, 
Hartford, 
Min-
neapolis, San Antonio, and St. Louis. 
One barrier left to fall, however, is one of 
the most important, and that is membership on 
the Supreme Court of the United States. 
For most of our national history, Presidents 
and Senators have turned a deaf ear to Abi-
gail Adams’ plea to her husband ‘‘to remem-
ber the ladies and be more generous and 
favourable to them than your ancestors.’’ 
Since Justice O’Connor’s 1981 appointment, 
only four women have been nominated to the 
High Court for the 18 vacancies occurring dur-
ing this time despite the fact that women con-
stitute a majority of the general population, 37 
percent of all attorneys in America, a number 
that will soon exceed the majority since a sub-
stantial majority (54 percent) of all law stu-
dents in America are women. 
With the announcement of his retirement by 
Associate Justice Stephen Breyer, President 
Biden and the U.S. Senate, now have been 
presented and should move quickly to cap-
italize on this opportunity to begin to rectify the 
High Court’s gender imbalance and to diver-
sify its composition by nominating and con-
firming a member of the most underrep-
resented, disadvantaged, marginalized, long-
est suffering, and most patient demographic in 
America: black woman. 
Longer than any other racial or ethnic 
group, black women have been subjected to 
the coercive powers of the law while being ex-
cluded from the opportunities to make the 
laws citizens are to live under. 
If you are always ruled but denied the op-
portunity to rule in turn, you are simply a sub-
ject, and not fully a citizen. And that is how 
you get Supreme Court decisions like Dred 
Scott v. Sanford (1857), Plessy v. Ferguson 
(1896), Korematsu v. United States (1944), 
Civil Rights Cases (1883), Bowers v. Hardwick 
(1986), Lochner v. New York (1905), and Buck 
v. Bell (1927). 
Simply stated, the purpose of pursuing di-
versity in the composition of a political sys-
tem’s decision-making institutions is not to ele-
vate any particular man or woman, but to en-
hance, as Condorcet’s Theorem posits, the 
quality and accuracy of institutional decision 
making and to bolster institutional legitimacy 
by increasing its diffuse support from marginal 
members of the political community. 
Researchers have shown that people are 
more likely to trust those with whom they 
share physical characteristics and thus as 
documented by the Center for American 
Progress, ‘‘in the interests of both equality and

the perception of fairness, it is important that 
judges reflect the parties and populations they 
serve.’’ 
Or as described by scholars Jason Iuliano 
and Avery Stewart, ‘‘In dispensing justice to all 
citizens, the legal system cannot allow one de-
mographically homogenous group to hand 
down decisions while other racial and ethnic 
groups bear the brunt of those decisions.’’ 
The federal judiciary, particularly the Su-
preme Court, does not resemble the public at 
large. Glaring disparities exist for women, Afri-
can Americans, Hispanics, Asian Americans, 
American Indians, and LGBTQ individuals. 
Consider for example that of all the judges 
currently sitting on federal Article III courts, 
only about 10 percent are African American 
and 2.6 percent are Asian American. 
In contrast, Blacks and African Americans 
comprise 12.5 percent of the U.S. population, 
while Asians make up 5.7 percent of the popu-
lation. 
Hispanics are woefully underrepresented on 
the courts compared with their share of the 
population with only 6.6 percent of sitting fed-
eral judges of Hispanic origin despite the fact 
that this group comprises 18.3 percent of the 
U.S. population. 
It is neither improper nor erroneous to say 
that President Biden owes black women be-
cause without their overwhelming support, his 
reeling campaign would not have cruised to 
victory in the 2020 South Carolina presidential 
primary, which led to his resounding wins on 
Super Tuesday, which put him on the glide 
path to the Democratic nomination and victory 
in the general election. 
So, if anybody is ever due to fulfill a key 
campaign promise, it is President Biden vow-
ing to make ‘‘sure there’s a Black woman on 
the Supreme Court, to make sure we in fact 
get every representation.’’ 
And when President Biden acts to keep his 
sacred promise, Shirley Chisolm will be smil-
ing down at us from Heaven. 
It is also fitting, Madam Speaker, that in ad-
dition to those national leaders whose con-
tributions have made our Nation better, we 
also honor those who have and are making a 
difference in their local communities. 
In my home city of Houston, there are nu-
merous men and women who are great be-
cause they have heeded the counsel of Dr. 
King who said: 
‘‘Everybody can be great because anybody 
can serve. You only need a heart full of grace. 
A soul generated by love.’’ 
By that measure, I wish to pay tribute to 
some of the great men and women who help 
to make Houston the wonderful, dynamic, vi-
brant, inclusive, and progressive city that it is. 
As we celebrate Black History Month, let us 
pay tribute to those who have come before us, 
and pay forward to future generations by ad-
dressing what is the number one issue for Af-
rican American families, and all American fam-
ilies today: preserving the American promise 
of economic opportunity for all. 
Our immediate focus must be to work ‘For 
The People’ to crush the pandemic, continue 
this Administration’s and this Congress’s 
record setting pace for job creation (6.5 million 
in the first year), and enacting legislation that 
will foster and lay the foundation for today’s 
and tomorrow’s generation of groundbreaking 
activists, leaders, scientists, writers and artists 
to continue contributing to the greatness of 
America. 
We must continue to preserve the American 
Dream for all. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to stand here 
in celebration of the heroic and historic acts of 
African Americans and their indispensable 
contributions to this great Nation. 
It is through our work in creating possibilities 
for today and future generations that we best 
honor the accomplishments and legacy of our 
predecessors. 
[From Rolling Stone, February 3, 2022] 
SHIRLEY CHISHOLM’S NEWLY UNEARTHED ‘DO 
WOMEN DARE?’ SPEECH IS JUST
AS REL-
EVANT TODAY 
In July 1971, Shirley Chisholm began to 
talk about it. Chisholm, who in 1968 had be-
come the first African American woman 
elected to Congress, would run for president. 
The congresswoman from New York an-
nounced her intentions to secure the Demo-
cratic nomination in September, and for-
mally announced on Jan. 25, 1972. The Demo-
cratic candidates who sought to oppose 
President Nixon’s bid for a second term 
counted ‘‘Fighting Shirley’’ and nine white 
men, all of whom had higher degrees, like 
Chisholm. Of the 10, all but Chisholm, Wilbur 
Mills, and Hubert Humphrey had served in 
the military. Chisholm was the first African 
American to contend for the presidential 
nomination of a major party. 
On the 50th anniversary of Chisholm’s pro-
test-era run, America is again reassessing 
itself and its history; the lesson of historical 
re-evaluation is seemingly how well we for-
get, and how fallible we are in remembering. 
Chisholm taught at the New School from 
1971–75. ‘‘Black Power and White Politics,’’ 
her inaugural course (eight sessions for $40) 
posed the question: ‘‘Can the political sys-
tem be made responsive to the needs of mi-
norities?’’ 
The issues are familiar, as is the broil of 
her audience and a citizenship that feels un-
heard. Chisholm, in 1972, is already a celeb-
rity—simultaneously a voice of the people 
and a spokesperson for a lying, thieving po-
litical system manipulated by Ivy League 
elites. The Chisholm audience, as well as the 
camera crew, chuckles uncomfortably as one 
questioner takes the soapbox, picking up 
‘‘the hot coal’’ and imploring listeners to 
consider: ‘‘Why do we fail as a country to ad-
dress these urgent needs . . . what is basi-
cally wrong with America that we can keep 
talking and everything gets worse?’’ 
‘‘The American public as a whole is too 
complacent,’’ Chisholm answers. ‘‘Not only 
is it complacent but it’s also gullible. . . . 
We don’t question enough. We don’t concern 
ourselves about things until they hit us on 
our front doorstep. . . . For a long time we 
had been taught in America about the need 
to bring about ’social justice’ that nobody 
worried about before in this society. But all 
of a sudden, middle-class America woke up 
about six years ago, when we began to have 
riots and conflagrations in the big cities of 
this country. Prior to that, nobody wondered 
what was happening to the Indian, the Afri-
can American, or even the Puerto Rican, or 
even the Black because we were getting 
along as a whole and it didn’t touch us on 
our front doorstep.’’ 
Tracking back to 1969, we find Chisholm 
empaneled at the New School with Gloria 
Steinem, author, feminist, and activist, and 
Jacqueline Grenenwexler, the former presi-
dent of Webster College. The three women, 
inaugurating the Human Relations Center at 
the New School, considered the provocation 
‘‘Do Women Dare?’’ 
In the wake of the social upheavals of re-
cent years, the speech, which is not known 
to have been published or broadcast since the 
event 50 years ago, feels as vital today as it 
did half a century ago. Through the discus-
sion, Chisholm pointed to what we would 
now call intersectionality; the term was 
coined by Kimberle´ Crenshaw in 1989 to de-
scribe the ways in which identity is nuanced 
and individual experience is not based on 
skin color or class alone. Intersectionality 
makes 
the 
invisible 
visible. 
It 
adds 
dimensionality to a type of racism that can 
be one-dimensional. What is diversity with-
out diverse socioeconomic backgrounds? 
Recorded via a WBAI broadcast, and newly 
digitized and transcribed here, Chisholm’s 
opening remarks for the 1969 panel are ex-
pansive, yet immediate. She’s radical in one 
moment, citing the divisive author Eldridge 
Cleaver, and pronouncedly centrist in the 
next, pointing back to personal responsi-
bility: ‘‘The law cannot do it for us. We must 
do it for ourselves.’’ Chisholm’s words are 
charged and nuanced and controversial, she 
is hearing the unheard, endeavoring to listen 
and to keep listening and vowing to fight. 
Here are her remarks. 
Shirley Chisholm: 
The topic this morning of course is, ‘‘do 
women dare?’’ And I have said, of course 
women dare. Do women dare? I assume that 
the question implies do women dare take an 
active part in society and, in particular, do 
they dare to take a part in the present social 
revolution? And I find the question as much 
of an insult as I would the question, ’’Are 
you, as a Black person, willing to fight for 
your rights?’’ America has been sufficiently 
sensitized to the answer, whether or not 
Black people are willing to both fight and die 
for their rights. To make the question itself 
is asinine and superfluous. America is not 
yet sufficiently aware, but such a question 
applied to women is equally asinine and su-
perfluous. 
I am, as is obvious, both Black and a 
woman. And that is a good vantage point 
from which to view at least two elements of 
what is becoming a social revolution. The 
American Black revolution and the women’s 
liberation movement. But it is also a hor-
rible disadvantage. It is a disadvantage, my 
friends, because America as a nation, is both 
racist 
and 
antifeminist. 
Racism 
and 
antifeminism are two of the prime traditions 
of this country that we have to face objec-
tively. For any individual, therefore, chal-
lenging social traditions is a giant step. A 
giant step, because there are no social tradi-
tions which do not have corresponding social 
sanctions, the sole purpose of which are to 
protect the sanctity of the traditions. 
Then when we ask the question, ‘‘do 
women dare?’’ we are not asking are women 
capable of a break with tradition so much as 
we are asking, are they capable of bearing 
with the sanctions that will be placed upon 
them? Coupling this with the hypothesis pre-
sented by some social thinkers and philoso-
phers that in any given society the most ac-
tive group are those who are nearest to the 
particular freedom that they desire, it does 
not surprise me that those women, most ac-
tive and vocal on the issue of freedom for 
women, are those who are young, white, and 
middle class. Nor is it also too surprising 
that there are not more from that group in-
volved in the women’s liberation movement. 
There certainly are reasons why more 
women are not involved, and this country, as 
I said, is antifeminist. Few, if any Ameri-
cans, are free of the psychological wounds 
imposed by racism and antifeminism. 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank Congresswoman JACK-
SON LEE for reminding us of Shirley 
Chisholm’s history here in the Capitol 
as a member of the Agriculture Com-
mittee.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1005 
February 7, 2022 
Now, you know I worked for the late 
Ron Dellums starting in 1975, and I 
worked for him for 11 years. I got a 
chance to be with Congresswoman 
Chisholm many times, also with Con-
gresswoman Barbara Jordan, so I got a 
chance to know her and her brilliance 
and her stately demeanor and her huge 
intellect. 
And I remember very clearly that 
Congresswoman Chisholm also was on 
the Rules Committee. And I know she 
was only the second woman to ever be 
appointed to the Rules Committee. 
Again, I have to go back to 1789 be-
cause I want the public to understand 
the centuries that took place during 
the interim. 
First, Congresswoman Chisholm was 
the second woman on the Rules Com-
mittee since 1789, and I believe—and we 
are checking—I think that she may 
have been the first member of the CBC 
on the Rules Committee also. But also, 
in terms of Congresswoman Chisholm’s 
history and bringing it current, she 
was an original board member, first 
honorary copresident in 1969 of the Na-
tional Abortion Rights Action League, 
better known as NARAL, and she was a 
fierce advocate for women’s reproduc-
tive rights and justice. And she was 
also only one of 16 Black women who 
courageously led a movement for re-
productive freedom that began with 
the publishing of the very seminal bro-
chure ‘‘We Remember: African Amer-
ican Women Are For Reproductive 
Freedom.’’ And that was in 1989. 
And so Congresswoman Chisholm has 
been honored in so many different ways 
throughout the years, but we need to 
do more. We are going to start with our 
Chisholm Trail. For those who want to 
join us this year we are going to com-
memorate the Chisholm Trail. 
I was so pleased that Chairwoman 
BEATTY mentioned the Shirley Chis-
holm stamp. It took us a long time to 
do this, but it was a bipartisan effort. 
We finally have a Forever Congress-
woman Shirley Chisholm’s historical 
stamp from the Postal Service. 
Also, she posthumously was awarded 
the Presidential Medal of Freedom 
from President Barack Obama. For her 
official 
portrait, 
I 
thank 
Speaker 
NANCY PELOSI because that was one of 
her first efforts working with us. And 
you remember Congresswoman Juanita 
Millender-McDonald, another African- 
American woman, brilliant woman, 
from Southern California who passed 
away. She was chairing the House Ad-
ministration Committee, and we got 
together. And this wasn’t easy. And I 
thank Speaker PELOSI for helping us 
because it was a heavy lift to get this 
beautiful portrait painted by a young 
brother down in Southern California 
into this temple of democracy. 
And at first, there were those who 
wanted the portrait to be hidden in 
some 
little 
corner. 
Well, 
Speaker 
PELOSI and Lorraine Miller, Clerk of 
the House, made sure that she was 
placed in a prominent place so that 
people, especially young people, could 
get a chance to know her and to love 
her because what she did for this coun-
try was so amazing for everyone, for 
the voiceless, and she was a person, a 
woman, a Black woman who loved to 
bring people together from all back-
grounds. 
So there are so many other memo-
rials across the country to remember 
her fortitude and to honor her grit and 
tenacity. And she taught me once 
again, and I know Congresswoman 
JACKSON LEE knows this, that Black 
women can’t go along to get along. 
Again, 1789. 
These rules weren’t made for us. So 
we must change these rules of the 
game, so that we must address gender 
and racial equity at its core. 
Before 
Congresswoman 
Chisholm 
passed away, she was asked how she 
wanted to be remembered. And I re-
member she said: I want history to re-
member me not just as the first Black 
woman to be elected to Congress, not 
as the first Black woman to have made 
a bid for the Presidency of the United 
States, but as a Black woman who 
lived in the 20th century and dared to 
be herself. I want to be remembered as 
a catalyst for change in America. 
And so I can confidently say that 
that is her legacy. Well done, Mrs. C, 
well done. Her staff and many of us 
called her ‘‘Mrs. C.’’ She had a phe-
nomenal staff, Carolyn Smith. She had 
an African-American woman as her 
chief of staff. She was one of the few, 
like Ron Dellums, who had senior staff 
members 
who 
were 
Black, 
Black 
women, three of us on the Hill at that 
point. So she lived a life that we can 
all be proud of and how she paved the 
way for so many of us to be here as 
Members of Congress, but also through-
out the country as members of elected 
bodies and corporate boardrooms. Con-
gresswoman Chisholm made sure that 
she left her legacy so that, yes, as 
someone said earlier, we finally have 
the first African-American Vice Presi-
dent in the country. Because of Shirley 
Chisholm, I am. Because of Shirley 
Chisholm, Kamala Harris is. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my staff 
Rico Doss and Kayla Williams on my 
staff for really pulling this all together 
and helping us with all of this. And, 
Sheila, your staff and the Congres-
sional Black Caucus members’ staff be-
cause without our staff—as I know be-
cause I was a staffer for many years— 
none of this would have happened to-
night. So I thank you guys very much. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Madam Speak-
er, I often say that I am operating in an institu-
tion and system that was not designed by or 
for people who look like me. Today, however, 
I celebrate a pioneer who wanted to change 
the system so that it would work for all the 
people—Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm. 
I stand proudly on the shoulders of the first 
Black woman in Congress. She entered Con-
gress ‘‘unbossed and unbought’’ and brought 
this energy to each of her seven terms. She 
paved the way for me to be here as the first 
Black woman to represent the people of Geor-
gia’s Fifth District in Congress. 
We are the next generation of Black excel-
lence because of Shirley Chisholm. As we 
face trying times, we must remember that we 
stand on the brink of progress. The courage of 
Shirley Chisholm paved the way for Black 
women in Congress to fight for a future that 
our children can believe in: 
Voting rights regardless of our ZIP code. 
Lasting investments in our HBCUs. 
The Black Maternal Health Momnibus to 
end the Black maternal mortality crisis. 
The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act to 
end police brutality. 
My Abolition Amendment legislation that will 
close a loophole in the Thirteenth Amendment 
and truly end slavery in America. 
As we reflect on how far we have come this 
Black History Month, I am looking forward to 
the future we are building together because of 
the path set by Congresswoman Chisholm. 
However, we have a long way to go. The 
halls of Congress are full of portraits and stat-
ues of mostly men, while depictions of women 
are scattered here and there. Images of trail-
blazers like Shirley Chisholm and Rosa Parks 
remind me of the imbalance of women lining 
the halls, and I am determined to change that. 
May we always remember Congresswoman 
Chisholm for her tenacity, her boldness, and 
her guts. That is what we will need to ensure 
that our story continues. 
Mrs. 
CHERFILUS-MCCORMICK. 
Madam 
Speaker, today I rise in honor of the first Afri-
can American woman to serve in the United 
States Congress and the first woman to run 
for President of the United States, the Honor-
able Shirley Chisholm. As we celebrate Black 
history month, we must also commemorate 
our sheroes for their contribution to protecting 
and preserving our precious democracy. 
I, including many of my colleagues here in 
Congress, stand on the shoulders of this cou-
rageous woman who was a champion for pro-
gressive policy that sought to improve the 
lives of society’s most vulnerable both inter-
nationally and domestically. In particular, she 
fought against the oppressive Apartheid Re-
gime in South Africa and the Vietnam War. In 
addition, she was instrumental in the move-
ment for women’s rights and the poor. 
The Honorable Shirley Chisholm understood 
the plight of the poor and working-class in this 
country. The reality is that there is no Amer-
ican Dream without economic equity. I am 
committed to continuing her activism in ad-
dressing the wealth gap. The average Black 
household has $24k in wealth, whereas the 
average White family has $188K in wealth. 
Approximately 30 percent of my District’s resi-
dents live on under $75K a year, while 21% 
live under $30K. 
To address these systemic challenges, it is 
vital to ensure that Congress resembles the 
diversity that exists in this nation. However, in 
states like mine, the Governor of Florida, Ron 
DeSantis, is committed to disfranchising voters 
through gerrymandering in violation of the Vot-
ing Rights Act and the Constitution. Ron 
DeSantis took the unprecedented and anti- 
democratic step of proposing his own Con-
gressional map for the state of Florida. Under 
DeSantis’ proposed plan, two Congressional 
seats currently held by African-American rep-
resentatives elected overwhelmingly by work-
ing Floridians would lose their seats. 
This is yet another attack on Floridians’ sa-
cred right to vote and a blatantly undemocratic

power grab. We believe that voters should 
choose their representatives, not the other 
way around. By injecting partisanship into the 
redistricting process, DeSantis is attempting to 
dilute minority representation and undermine 
the true will of Florida voters. He is a threat to 
our democracy. My colleagues and I will con-
tinue to fight against his racist and discrimina-
tory proposal. 
The Honorable Shirley Chisholm once said, 
‘‘I want to be remembered as a woman . . . 
who dared to be a catalyst of change.’’ I hope 
that her legacy and commitment to service will 
inspire us all to continue defending the United 
States Constitution and fight tirelessly to im-
prove the lives of our constituents through pro-
gressive policy. 
f 
BACK THE BLUE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Mrs. CAMMACK) is recognized 
for 60 minutes as the designee of the 
minority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and include 
extraneous material on the subject of 
this Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Florida? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to show an army of congres-
sional leaders who back the blue. I rise 
to show our colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle and Americans across 
the country that we won’t back down 
when it comes to supporting our men 
and women in uniform. 
Since my time in Congress began just 
over 1 year ago, I have made it my mis-
sion to show not just in words but also 
in action that our LEOs across the 
country have a thin blue line army 
that won’t back down, that won’t quit, 
and that will always have their six. 
Today, we rise to honor the heroes in 
our midst, the everyday public serv-
ants who get up daily to don the badge, 
run into harm’s way, moving towards 
danger and working hard to keep us all 
safe. 
Amid efforts to defund our police, 
leading to a rise in crime with no re-
sponse from elected officials nation-
wide or from this administration; amid 
phony bail reform efforts that do noth-
ing to keep dangerous criminals behind 
bars; amid an opioid crisis with record 
levels of drugs pouring into our com-
munities, perpetuated by the crisis at 
our southern border—because we all 
know that you cannot defend your 
hometowns if you cannot protect the 
homeland—amid 
dangerous 
rhetoric 
spread by the ill-informed; amid in-
creasing levels of vitriol for this pro-
fession, these real heroes, well, they 
show up. 
b 2100 
Madam Speaker, I stood on this floor 
in March of last year as my Democrat 
colleagues passed a bill to defund po-
lice. They defunded police. Now, that 
night, 
I 
challenged 
my 
colleagues 
across the aisle to a ride-along. Not a 
single one—not one—took me up on my 
offer. 
Instead, my team and I set out to do 
the ride-alongs that my colleagues 
would not. And wow, did we learn a lot. 
Whether it was domestic violence, rob-
bery, battery, violent brawls, drunk 
drivers, drug busts—everything in be-
tween—these 
ride-alongs 
proved 
it. 
These men and women who wear the 
badge, they are amazing. They are im-
perfect beings doing the toughest of 
jobs with the best of intentions. They 
are criticized, demonized, and vilified, 
and yet, they continue to answer the 
call in the face of it all. 
Madam Speaker, 2021 was the dead-
liest year on record for members of the 
law 
enforcement 
community—the 
deadliest. Next to me, you see the 
names of all those that we lost. You 
probably can’t see the names very well 
or even care to read them. There is 458 
of them—the poster isn’t even big 
enough to accommodate all of the 
names. That is 458 families shattered 
forever. That is 458 departments for-
ever changed. That is 458 lives lost. 
As the wife of a first responder, I 
know all too well that feeling of twists 
and turns and pain that comes when a 
SWAT callout has come out. I know 
what it is like to sit at the kitchen 
table and wait for the call, the text let-
ting me know that the callout is over 
and that my husband is on his way 
back to the department or to the sta-
tion. 
I know what it is like, and that is 
perhaps why I stand here today more 
resolved than ever to stand in defense 
and in support of those who protect and 
serve every day. To the spouses of our 
men and women in law enforcement, 
know that you have a friend and sister 
in this fight. Know that your service 
alongside your partner is just as valu-
able and important to all those across 
the country. Whether you call yourself 
a deputy or an officer, an LEO spouse 
or family member, the message is sim-
ple: My colleagues and I, we see you, 
we hear you, we support you, and we 
will always have your six. 
To those who seek to divide, defund, 
and disparage, know that every at-
tempt that you make to hurt our LEOs 
and defund our departments, it will 
only be in vain. Your efforts to make 
our communities less safe will fail. 
Your efforts to hurt our families will 
falter. My colleagues and I, we will 
make sure of it. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Minnesota (Mr. STAUBER). 
Mr. STAUBER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize and honor the 
brave men and women who are serving 
in law enforcement, who protect our 
communities, and keep our streets 
safe. 
As a former law enforcement for 23 
years, I know the sacrifices made by 
them and their families. Every day, 
law enforcement officers walk out of 
their homes leaving their loved ones 
behind, and put their own lives on the 
line for the safety and security of oth-
ers. They don’t get to choose which 
call for service they go on. The dangers 
they face every day while keeping us 
safe are all too real. 
Instead of showing gratitude for their 
service, dedication, and sacrifice, far 
too many people are using defund and 
disrespect the police rhetoric that is 
leading to violence against the men 
and women in blue and brown. In fact, 
more police officers have been killed in 
the 
line 
of 
duty 
under 
President 
Biden’s leadership than in previous 
years. It is no secret that morale in the 
law enforcement community is low, 
and many dedicated officers are leav-
ing the force. 
Police departments across the coun-
try are struggling to fill vacancies and 
crime rates, which have risen. This is a 
direct result of the demonization and 
vilification of the profession by some 
political leaders to score political 
points. The men and women serving in 
local law enforcement deserve our re-
spect and support. They are the last 
line of defense and the protectors of 
our communities. I am so honored to 
have served alongside some of these 
brave men and women. 
We must be vocal in expressing our 
support for our local law enforcement 
during these times. We must make the 
same commitment to them as they 
have committed to our friends, our 
families, and our communities. It is 
the least that we can do for them and 
their families. I am happy to stand 
here today, along with so many of my 
colleagues, to show support. 
Unlike my Democrat colleagues, Re-
publicans don’t need election year poll-
ing to stand with law enforcement who 
keep our communities safe. Minneso-
tans and all Americans deserve to live 
in safe communities, and I will con-
tinue to work to ensure this is our 
shared reality. We all owe them our 
thanks. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman and my friend 
and colleague from the great State of 
Minnesota. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. BABIN), my 
friend and colleague. 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my friend from Florida, Mrs. CAMMACK, 
for having this and honoring law en-
forcement in this Special Order. 
Madam Speaker, the surge and vio-
lence across the country and the tar-
geted attacks on our brave law enforce-
ment officers are happening thanks to 
the Democrats’ relentless calls to 
defund the police. 
The left has brazenly stripped the po-
lice departments of necessary funding 
and enacted new laws that actually en-
sure that violent criminals have the 
freedom to inflict more harm. To be 
clear, violent criminals are being re-
leased on little to no bail only to kill 
again.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1007 
February 7, 2022 
This is the Democrats’ America. 
These shameful and purely political 
policies put criminals above law-abid-
ing citizens. Our law enforcement offi-
cials should be respected and honored 
for their role in keeping us safe. 
Tonight, I want to highlight one such 
individual, Tyler County native, grow-
ing up in Spurger, Texas, Texas Rang-
er, Joe Haralson, from my county, 
Tyler County, Texas. 
Joe was an Army infantryman during 
the Vietnam war and earned the 
Bronze Star and Air Medal, with Oak 
Leaf Clusters for both, for his heroic 
service. Less than a year after return-
ing home in Vietnam from 1971, Joe en-
rolled himself in the Department of 
Public Safety’s 18-week training acad-
emy in Austin, Texas. After a decade of 
hard work as a DPS officer, Joe finally 
received his Texas Ranger badge. 
This year marks Joe’s 41st year with 
the Texas Rangers. He is the longest 
serving Texas Ranger in Texas’ illus-
trious history, and what a hero he is. 
He has served his fellow Texans for 
more than half a century, and his time 
in law enforcement is nothing short of 
amazing and inspiring. 
Over the decades, Joe has worked on 
cases involving murders, robberies, 
kidnappings, rapes, and much more. He 
has seen the face of evil countless 
times, yet is one of the humblest and 
kindness men that you will ever meet. 
It is a privilege to have this Amer-
ican patriot as a friend, share his 
story, express my sincerest gratitude 
for his devotion to our community and 
to our State of Texas. These are the he-
roes that radical Democrats have aban-
doned, but I never will. 
God bless you, Joe. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from the great 
State of Texas. I am proud to call him 
friend. Thank you for honoring this in-
credible patriot. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. GIMENEZ), my 
friend and colleague from the Sunshine 
State. 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, the woke left have 
stood idly by as rabid criminals have 
embarked on an all-out assault on our 
police officers. Rather than standing 
up for the brave men and women of law 
enforcement—the very ones who put 
their lives on the line every day to 
keep our families and communities 
safe—they have bent over backwards to 
the most radical fringes of the progres-
sive movement that actively works to 
defund, disarm, and disband our police 
departments. 
The result? Under Joe Biden’s first 
year as President, police officers have 
seen a historic spike in violent crime 
against them. 
In 2021 alone, there were 346 officers 
shot in the line of duty resulting in 63 
deaths. 
Police officers were victims to 103 
ambush-style attacks, which increased 
115 percent over the prior year. 
The FBI reported a 48.7 increase in 
2021 of officers’ killings, both on-duty 
and off-duty, totaling 73 deaths from 
firearms, vehicles, knives, and other 
personal weapons. Believe it or not, 
those numbers represent the highest 
number of law enforcement officers 
who were intentionally killed since the 
terror attacks of September 11. 
Last week, House Homeland Security 
Committee Republicans stood up to de-
mand the Department of Justice open a 
Federal investigation into these egre-
gious spikes in crime against our po-
lice officers. 
b 2110 
President Biden, his administration, 
and the Democrats who maintain a 
stranglehold on Congress must find the 
courage to break with the radical lib-
erals who want to defund, disarm, and 
disband our police and show up with 
unprecedented support for our officers 
in blue. 
I, for one, am proud to back the blue. 
Thank you to our officers for all the 
work and your sacrifices. Know that 
the Republicans in this Chamber stand 
with you and have your back. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend and colleague from 
the Sunshine State. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. KATKO), 
my friend and colleague. 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I want 
to thank my friend and colleague on 
the Homeland Security Committee for 
holding this important Special Order 
to let law enforcement officers all over 
the United States know this simple 
truth: We support you, and we have 
your back. 
For over 20 years, I served as an orga-
nized crime prosecutor on the Federal 
level, focusing on narcotics, gang, and 
corruption prosecutions, among many 
others, in central New York, along the 
southwest border, the Commonwealth 
of Puerto Rico, all over the United 
States, and all over the world. 
I worked alongside incredible men 
and women in law enforcement every 
day. They are some of the most coura-
geous and selfless people I know, and 
they put their lives on the line to pro-
tect our communities. 
The officers I have worked with were 
assaulted. They were shot. Some were 
killed. Yet, time and time again, the 
officers showed up every day to do 
their jobs and dispatch their duties 
with honor and dignity, despite not 
being paid anywhere near what they 
should. 
Unfortunately, our brothers and sis-
ters in law enforcement are hurting 
right now. Violence against law en-
forcement officers has become a trou-
bling pattern across the United States, 
culminating most recently in violent 
shooting deaths of officers in New York 
City and Houston. Sadly, this violence 
is part of an upward national trend. 
According to the National Fraternal 
Order of Police, in 2021, there were 346 
officers shot in the line of duty, and 103 
were ambush-style attacks, which in-
creased 115 percent over the prior year. 
Tragically, 73 officers were killed. Ac-
cording to the data from the FBI, this 
accounts for a 50 percent increase. 
These grim statistics represent the 
highest number of law enforcement 
who were intentionally killed since the 
terror attacks of September 11, 2001. 
As ranking member of the Homeland 
Security Committee and chair of the 
American Security Task Force, I have 
heard directly from law enforcement 
officers about the challenges police de-
partments face as crimes continue to 
rise. I have traveled across the country 
where the effects of the defund the po-
lice and go against the police move-
ments are at their worst. 
In New York City, for example, the 
department was cut by close to $1 bil-
lion in 2020. In 2021, it broke the State 
record for annual homicides. They cut 
cops. They cut shifts. They passed laws 
in New York State that made it very 
difficult for officers to do their jobs 
and made it very easy for violent 
criminals to get back on the streets. 
In Portland, Oregon, a center for the 
defund the police movement, homicides 
are up 530 percent. That was because 
they cut their police department by 10 
percent and eliminated the violent 
crime unit. Of course, that is going to 
happen. The increase in crime, coupled 
with recruitment and retention prob-
lems, will only compound the crime 
problems this country is currently fac-
ing. 
Instead of vilifying police, let’s fig-
ure out how to make police depart-
ments better by investing in them. 
How can you possibly retrain police 
when you defund them? How can you 
implement new policies and get officers 
ready for those new policies when you 
cut their funding? It doesn’t work. 
Today, we are facing troubling new 
challenges. Our law enforcement offi-
cers are being asked to do more with 
less, and it is putting their lives at 
risk. In addition to their crime-fight-
ing responsibilities, our officers are on 
the front lines, facing the threat of ter-
rorism and an unprecedented opioid 
epidemic. 
Homeland security is being degraded 
because defunded police and vilified po-
lice departments do not have sufficient 
resources for counterterrorism oper-
ations. 
It takes courage to wear a badge. It 
takes even more courage to respond to 
an emergency, to engage a suspect, to 
walk down a dark alley, or to confront 
a terrorist. For law enforcement, that 
is part of their job every single day. 
My committee and the task force are 
proud to stand with law enforcement as 
they continue to do this honorable 
work. I will always have their backs, 
and they will always have my thanks 
and admiration. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend and colleague, the 
ranking member of the Homeland Se-
curity Committee. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. RUTHER-
FORD), my friend and colleague.

February 7, 2022 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentlewoman from Florida. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of the men and women in law en-
forcement who risk their lives every 
day to keep us safe. In return, Congress 
owes it to them to do everything in our 
power to keep them safe. 
As many of you know, I spent over 40 
years in law enforcement, including 12 
years as sheriff of Duval County, Flor-
ida. Sadly, some of my friends and col-
leagues paid the ultimate price in the 
line of duty. In fact, our memorial wall 
is filled with the names of too many 
good police officers who laid down 
their lives in service to their commu-
nity. 
When you are called to policing, you 
know the undertaking that you are 
taking is a dangerous job. This growing 
antipolice rhetoric and widespread ef-
forts to defund police departments are 
leaving officers increasingly at risk to 
attacks, and communities are less safe. 
In 2022, 89 officers around the country 
lost their lives to gunfire, beatings, 
stabbing, or vehicular assault, officers 
like Nassau County Deputy Joshua 
Moyers, who was killed last year in an 
attack while conducting a traffic stop 
in northeast Florida. 
So, what are we doing in Congress to 
help stop these attacks? I have intro-
duced a bipartisan bill called the Pro-
tect and Serve Act, which would in-
crease penalties for individuals who de-
liberately target law enforcement offi-
cers with violence. In 2018, the Protect 
and Serve Act overwhelmingly passed 
the House 382–35. 
I urge my Democrat colleagues to 
come back to the table and support 
this important legislation. Police offi-
cers’ lives depend on it. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend and colleague, Sheriff 
RUTHERFORD. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS), a 
champion for our law enforcement. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend from Florida for the 
recognition. She does a great job for 
the Congress, and we are all so grateful 
to have her here. 
Madam Speaker, this is such an im-
portant topic tonight. Ranking Mem-
ber KATKO delineated the number of 
law 
enforcement 
jurisdictions 
who 
have seen funding cut and the unfortu-
nate consequences that occurred on the 
populations that they serve. Did you 
ever stop to think of what would hap-
pen if there were just an absolute 
defunding of the police department? 
Well, unfortunately, we only need to 
look about a hundred years past to see 
such an example. It happened in Bos-
ton, Massachusetts, in September 1919. 
The police force was unfunded, and the 
city was unprotected. This was docu-
mented in a book by a gentleman 
named Francis Russell. The book is 
called ‘‘A City in Terror.’’ 
What was startling to me when I read 
the book was not that there was a 
gradual descent into lawlessness, but it 
happened like turning a switch. Police 
were not on the job. The city sunk into 
chaos—robberies, 
beatings, 
assaults, 
looting. And it went on for several days 
until the Governor of that State called 
up the National Guard and reasserted 
authority. 
Who was that Governor? It is kind of 
a rarity to stop and think about it now, 
but it was a Republican Governor of 
Massachusetts named Calvin Coolidge. 
It was that activity of restoring order 
in the city that catapulted him to fame 
and caused him to receive the Vice 
Presidential nomination in the Repub-
lican Convention of 1920. And as they 
say, the rest is history. 
Please, let us not forget our history. 
Defunding the police does not lead us 
to a better place. It does not lead us to 
a more just and civil society. It invites 
chaos. 
b 2120 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Dr. BURGESS for his steadfast 
support for law enforcement. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Virginia (Mr. CLINE), who 
is my friend and a supporter of law en-
forcement. 
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding to me 
and for hosting this Special Order. I 
would be here to speak in support of 
the men and women in law enforce-
ment regardless. 
Tonight, I come to the House floor to 
honor two local heroes: Officers John 
Painter and J.J. Jefferson, who were 
killed in the line of duty last week 
while responding to reports of a sus-
picious individual at nearby Bridge-
water College. Their funerals this week 
will be overflowing with members of 
the community, the campus, law en-
forcement, and members of govern-
ment and civil officials, all of whom 
loved these two heroes. 
Officer John Painter dedicated his 
life to public service. Prior to becom-
ing a campus police officer at Bridge-
water, Painter served in the United 
States Air Force and the Army Na-
tional Guard. He spent time as a dep-
uty sheriff in King George County, and 
he was a member of the Grottoes Po-
lice Department for 18 years before re-
tiring as chief in 2018. 
Painter was known as a loving family 
man with a great loyalty to his friends 
and community. Those who knew him 
say that his devotion to others could 
not go unnoticed. 
Like Officer Painter, Officer J.J. Jef-
ferson committed his life to protecting 
and serving others before coming to 
Bridgewater College in 2018. Jefferson 
began his law enforcement career in 
1997 as a patrol officer with the Fairfax 
County Sheriff’s Office prior to spend-
ing 12 years as national reconnaissance 
officer in Chantilly, Virginia. Jefferson 
then served as a sergeant with the 
Shenandoah University Department of 
Public Safety during which time he 
was awarded the James B. Wilkins 
Award for his proactive security initia-
tives. A veteran of the United States 
Marine Corps, Jefferson is remembered 
for his boisterous laugh and endearing 
smile. 
Known as the dynamic duo, the two 
officers were the closest of friends with 
Officer Painter even serving as the best 
man at Jefferson’s wedding. 
Students describe the officers as fam-
ily and said the pair ‘‘really cared 
about all of us—all of us.’’ 
Painter and Jefferson made it a point 
to connect with those they were tasked 
with protecting, embedding themselves 
into the community by eating lunch 
with students, hanging out with them 
at campus gathering spots, and offering 
words 
of 
wisdom 
to 
those 
they 
interacted with. 
Officers Jefferson and Painter gave 
their lives to protect students on cam-
pus, and our community is forever 
grateful for their sacrifice. Their ef-
forts surely prevented even greater loss 
of life, and the dynamic duo’s actions 
will never be forgotten. 
The Bridgewater community mourns 
their tragic passing, and our prayers 
remain with their families in this dif-
ficult time. 
Tonight, we remember the words in 
John 15:13: No one has greater love 
than this, to lay down one’s life for 
one’s friends. 
Rest in peace, Officers Painter and 
Jefferson. 
God bless. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to my friend and colleague from 
the Sunshine State of Florida (Mr. 
BILIRAKIS), who is a champion for law 
enforcement. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the brave men 
and women who serve in law enforce-
ment throughout our great Nation. 
New statistics indicate that inten-
tional killings of law enforcement offi-
cers in 2021 reached a 20-year high— 
this is tragic—excluding 9/11. 
Tragically, two of those officers 
killed in the line of duty during 2021 
have been my constituents: Deputy Mi-
chael Magli of the Pinellas County 
Sheriff’s Office and Master Patrol Offi-
cer Jesse Madsen of Tampa Police De-
partment. I went to the funeral serv-
ices of those two heroes and shared the 
anguish of their grieving families and 
colleagues. 
Additionally, in 2014, Officer Charlie 
K. Kondek from my hometown of Tar-
pon Springs, Florida, who was part of 
the Tarpon Springs Police Department, 
was killed in the line of duty. 
These fallen heroes leave behind a 
distinguished legacy of service and sac-
rifice that deserves to be honored. 
I am proud to cosponsor, along with 
my great friend, KAT CAMMACK, from 
Gainesville, Florida—so we are Florid-
ians and Florida Gators—the Back the 
Blue Act and the Protect and Serve 
Act of 2021. Both of those bills will in-
crease the Federal penalties for crimes 
targeting members of the law enforce-
ment community and strengthen fund-
ing for programs to improve relations

between law enforcement and the com-
munities they serve. 
Law enforcement agencies around 
the country have faced undeserved po-
litical attacks by the defund the police 
movement. This is unacceptable as far 
as I am concerned. This is a dangerous 
and destructive proposition and has 
only increased violence. 
We should, in fact, be increasing sup-
port and funding for our law enforce-
ment. I respect the service and sac-
rifice of our first responders and their 
families, and I will continue to do ev-
erything I can to support them. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman for having this Special Order 
which is so very important. I appre-
ciate it. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend from the freedom 
State, Florida, for his remarks. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST), who is 
the ranking member of the Veterans’ 
Affairs Committee and a fellow patriot 
and ardent supporter of law enforce-
ment. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to thank my friend, Congress-
woman KAT CAMMACK from Florida, for 
her organization of this Special Order 
tonight. 
Madam Speaker, I know that these 
Special Orders go long, and I know 
quite often the person who is sitting in 
the Speaker’s chair quite often focuses 
on whatever is going on on their cell 
phones, but I really hope that you are 
paying attention tonight because my 
district is right across from yours. 
Last year, two families in my district 
received the call that every law en-
forcement family just dreads—a call 
informing them that their loved ones 
will not be returning home. 
On August 4, Brooklyn, Illinois, Po-
lice Officer Brian Pierce Jr. was de-
ploying spike strips on a bridge during 
a car chase. He was hit and fatally in-
jured by the fleeing vehicle. Brian was 
only 24 years old. 
On October 26, we lost Pontoon 
Beach, Illinois, Police Officer Tyler 
Timmins. He was tragically killed 
while investigating a stolen vehicle at 
a gas station. Tyler was only 36 years 
old, Madam Speaker, and a 14-year vet-
eran of the force. He left behind his 
wife, Linsey, whom he had just married 
1 month before as well as his daughter, 
Chloe. 
Sadly, their families are not alone in 
their pain. In 2021, 73 officers were 
killed in the line of duty—the highest 
number in 26 years. The liberals at the 
Federal law level, at the State level, 
and at the local level push to defund 
police, Madam Speaker. I want you to 
understand that that agenda has made 
our communities less safe. 
Even in the State of Illinois on a 
lame-duck session in the middle of the 
night they passed the bill that made it 
to where we defunded police and endan-
gered our police officers. Their rhetoric 
has emboldened criminals, putting our 
brave officers’ lives in danger. 
Despite it all, our police officers con-
tinue to show up and run towards the 
danger to protect our communities 
every day, even if they are being shot 
at. 
Madam Speaker, do you know why 
this is so personal to me? 
My son-in-law is a deputy sheriff in 
Jackson County, Illinois. 
This issue is personal to me and my 
family. 
Why? 
Because I see the crap he sees every 
day. But I know that he is doing it be-
cause he cares about those who need 
help. 
I will always stand for our men and 
women of law enforcement and will do 
all that I can to ensure they get the 
support that they deserve. I only wish 
that all of my colleagues would join in 
with me to do that and stop spreading 
the rhetoric of defunding police. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleague from the great 
State of Illinois for his impassioned 
and accurate remarks. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from the great State of Mis-
souri (Mrs. HARTZLER), who is my good 
friend. 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Kat for holding this very Special 
Order tonight. 
I rise today to honor our police offi-
cers and to condemn those who shame-
fully unleash defund the police rhetoric 
into our communities. Next to me are 
the images of nearly 90 police officers 
who were killed in the line of duty just 
last year. 
b 2130 
There are so many lives lost that I 
had to make three separate posters. 
These courageous men and women lost 
their lives by being shot, assaulted, 
stabbed, or hit by cars. 
Sadly, America has seen a 115 percent 
increase in ambush attacks on our po-
lice officers. There is no doubt in my 
mind that liberal hatred and vitriol 
against law enforcement played a role 
in the uptick of the attacks on our offi-
cers. It is clear: Rhetoric has con-
sequences. 
The faces on these pages are fathers 
and mothers, loved ones. One of them 
was a fellow Missourian. Last year, Po-
lice Officer Blaize Madrid-Evans of 
Independence, Missouri, lost his life 
while responding to a call when a 
criminal opened fire and killed him. 
Blaize was only 22 years old, and he 
was engaged to be married. He had his 
whole life ahead of him. This is tragic. 
This is unacceptable. Things must 
change. 
Our law enforcement officers deserve 
our respect, support, and thanks. Noth-
ing else. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Wash-
ington (Mr. NEWHOUSE), my friend and 
colleague, a champion for our law en-
forcement officers. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Mrs. CAMMACK very much for 
yielding. I am proud to join my col-
leagues and rise today in honor of the 
brave men and women in blue who 
serve and protect us each and every 
day. 
According to new statistics released 
by the FBI, intentional killings of law 
enforcement in 2021 were the highest in 
20 years. Every day police officers 
across central Washington, as well as 
the United States, put on a badge and 
go to work knowing that they may face 
extremely dangerous situations, exac-
erbated by significant economic uncer-
tainties, open border policies, and the 
raging opioid crisis. 
We owe a debt of gratitude to these 
individuals who risk their lives to en-
force the law and protect our commu-
nities. Law enforcement officers take 
time away from their families and 
their loved ones, often without the 
thanks that they deserve and often 
putting themselves in harm’s way. 
Before I highlight some of our offi-
cers who are currently serving the 
great State of Washington, I would like 
to ask for a moment of silence for the 
victims of today’s tragic shooting in 
Richland, Washington, and the officers 
who are currently investigating that 
incident. 
Trooper David Brandt of the Tri-Cit-
ies was selected as the 2020 Washington 
State Trooper of the Year. Trooper 
Brandt not only demonstrates a strong 
commitment to law enforcement, but 
takes the time to personally connect 
with his community; from reading 
books to schoolchildren to conducting 
safety classes for women to delivering 
meals to families in need. 
King County Trooper Patoc also goes 
beyond above and beyond the line of 
duty and just last year saved the life of 
a man on the brink of committing sui-
cide, who is now receiving the critical 
help that he requires. 
These officers are the kinds of heroes 
that we need, and they deserve our ut-
most support and recognition. I also 
want to recognize some officers whose 
lives were recently lost. 
In just January of this year, we lost 
Trooper Robert LaMay of Yakima, who 
served honorably for over two decades. 
In October of last year, we lost Trooper 
Detective Eric Gunderson of Tacoma in 
the line of duty. These and all of our 
fallen officers will not be forgotten. 
I want to personally thank the police 
and sheriff’s departments of Wash-
ington State Patrol, and all of the offi-
cers who keep central Washington’s 
communities safe. Today and every day 
we offer our appreciation and respect 
for law enforcement officers across the 
Nation. 
Madam Speaker, I also want to thank 
Mrs. CAMMACK, my friend, for putting 
together this Special Order. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Representative NEWHOUSE for his 
comments. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from the great State of Penn-
sylvania (Mr. KELLER), a friend and 
colleague, and a champion for our law 
enforcement.

February 7, 2022 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman from Florida 
for organizing this Special Order, the 
important things for which we should 
all be very passionate about. 
Defunding the police is not just a 
Democrat slogan, it is a dangerous pol-
icy that has been advocated by some 
Washington Democrats and is having 
devastating consequences for the mo-
rale and safety of America’s law en-
forcement officers. 
In 2021, 346 officers were shot, and 
ambush-style attacks increased by 115 
percent from 2020. Last month, we all 
watched as NYPD officers lined the 
streets of Manhattan to honor two of 
their fallen brothers who were shot and 
killed in the line of duty. 
Criminal acts of violence against law 
enforcement are becoming all too com-
mon. Despite this fact, Washington 
Democrats 
continue 
to 
call 
for 
defunding the police, and stoke divi-
sion between the public and the heroes 
who keep us safe every day and sac-
rifice to do so. 
Painting law enforcement out to be 
the bad guy doesn’t make America 
safer. It does exactly the opposite, and 
it only serves to embolden more crimi-
nal behavior and lawlessness. Our offi-
cers protect us every day and they need 
our support now more than ever. 
I stand with law enforcement, and I 
stand for law and order. I thank the 
gentlewoman from Florida for having 
this important Special Order. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Representative KELLER for his 
comments. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Wisconsin 
(Mr. 
GROTHMAN), my friend and colleague. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Much of the police hatred that we get 
stems from horribly divisive politi-
cians like President Biden, who claim 
that Black children must be taught to 
tolerate racist abuse from police just 
to make it home. 
President Obama also had quotes en-
couraging police hatred by screaming 
racism. Let’s look at the facts as point-
ed out by Heather Mac Donald in an ex-
cellent article in The Wall Street Jour-
nal. Sadly, groups who are involved in 
crime are more likely to get in con-
frontations with police. Fifty-three 
percent of homicide offenders in Amer-
ica and 60 percent of robberies are com-
mitted by the same demographic that 
Black Lives Matter purports to help. 
Study after study after study ana-
lyzing the statistics shows no racism. 
Other studies show that Black and 
Brown policemen are more likely to 
shoot suspects than White officers, also 
inconsistent with the racial narrative. 
You might say why discuss this 
issue? Who cares if we lie and tear 
down the police? I suggest that the 
Congressmen around here all make an 
effort to do a ride-along with the po-
lice. See what great, selfless human 
beings they are before you scream rac-
ism without cause. 
Furthermore, police are human, and 
when you keep calling police racists, I 
think sometimes police have a tend-
ency to back off and become less asser-
tive. And that is one of the major rea-
sons a big city near me, the city of Mil-
waukee, for 2 years in a row we have 
had massive, record numbers of homi-
cides in the city. That is what happens 
when the police become cowed and less 
effective. 
It has resulted, I think, in dozens of 
murders in Milwaukee that would not 
have 
happened 
without 
the 
racist 
antipolice groups. And by groups, I 
point out, not only politicians, but the 
NFL has encouraged police dislike with 
their Black Lives Matter support in 
the stadiums. Stand up to the cheap 
politicians tearing down the police. 
Stand up to the billionaires who own 
the NFL and fan the flames of anti- 
race feelings, and stand with the police 
of America who are doing a tremendous 
job. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend and colleague from 
the great State of Wisconsin for his 
comments. 
It is my pleasure to yield to the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. CLYDE), my 
friend and a champion for law enforce-
ment. 
Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, I thank 
Congresswoman CAMMACK for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, our great Nation is 
blessed with dedicated law enforcement 
officers who wake up every morning to 
maintain law and order, keep commu-
nities safe, and answer the call when 
criminals strike. Yet, their sacrifice 
has been met with radical calls from 
the left to defund the police, and also 
horrific attacks from those people who 
believe in defunding the police. 
In 2021 alone, there were 346 officers 
shot in the line of duty, including 63 
tragic deaths. Additionally, there was 
almost a 50 percent increase in police 
officer murders last year, totaling 73 
deaths from violent criminals who have 
no respect for law and order. 
These startling statistics represent 
the highest number of law enforcement 
officers who were murdered since the 
terror attacks of September 11, 2001. 
b 2140 
This violence isn’t just sequestered 
to major cities either. It is happening 
all across the United States. Unfortu-
nately, my home district, Georgia’s 
Ninth, a district that is primarily 
rural, knows this harsh reality all too 
well. 
Back in November of last year, Jack-
son County, my home county, lost both 
a mother and a heroic police officer, 
Deputy Lena Marshall. After respond-
ing to a domestic call that escalated to 
a violent shootout, Deputy Marshall’s 
life was taken while serving to keep 
Georgians safe. 
Any act of criminal violence is an as-
sault on justice, which is why we must 
provide our brave men and women in 
blue with the community support, the 
resources, and especially the political 
backing needed to adequately respond 
to surging crime across our Nation. 
Those in political office show both ig-
norance and cowardice when they side 
with criminals and, thereby, under-
mine those who serve and protect. 
May God protect our courageous law 
enforcement officers who put their 
lives on the line each and every day, 
and God bless the fallen heroes, like 
Deputy Marshall, who made the ulti-
mate sacrifice while protecting the 
communities they serve. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend and colleague from 
the great State of Georgia for those 
words. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from North Carolina (Mr. MUR-
PHY), my friend and colleague. 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, over the last year, our 
law enforcement officers have been 
faced 
with 
targeted 
attacks, 
sky-
rocketing crime rates, and decimated 
budgets. 
Madam Speaker, despite these chal-
lenges, our law enforcement officers 
continue to protect and serve our com-
munities with unwavering bravery, 
sacrifice, and selflessness. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to rep-
resent so many incredible law enforce-
ment officers in eastern North Caro-
lina, all of whom put themselves at 
risk each day so that the rest of us can 
live in safe, secure communities. 
Madam Speaker, Deputy Zachary 
Bellingham, a former U.S. Marine and 
deputy for the Craven County Sheriff’s 
Office, in my district, is no exception. 
On October 21, 2021, Deputy Bel-
lingham sustained life-threatening in-
juries while performing a wellness 
check in New Bern, North Carolina, 
when he was shot in the line of duty. 
Following his injuries, he was taken to 
Carolina East Medical Center, airlifted 
to Greenville, and received emergency 
surgery. He was then transferred to 
Shepherd’s Rehabilitation Center in 
Atlanta, where he has shown strong 
perseverance in his rehabilitation. 
The conduct and actions of Deputy 
Bellingham embody the values of a 
true American hero. Madam Speaker, 
his brave actions on that fateful day 
highlight the very best of our law en-
forcement and all they do to protect 
our communities. I am so relieved to 
know that Deputy Bellingham is in 
good care and continuing his road to 
recovery. 
After his injury, members of our 
community 
quickly 
rallied 
around 
Deputy Bellingham, offering him well- 
wishes in support of his recovery. 
His service, Madam Speaker, is one 
we all honor and appreciate, and I am 
grateful to represent such a compas-
sionate and caring community in east-
ern North Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, please join us in ex-
pressing our sincere gratitude to not 
only this deputy but all law enforce-
ment officers for their commitment to 
keeping us and our families safe each 
and every day.

putting together this Special Order 
this evening to honor our local law en-
forcement officers. I can think of few 
people more deserving of this honor 
than the men and women in local law 
enforcement, as their daily acts of her-
oism, bravery, and courage keep our 
communities safe. 
Tonight, we have heard numerous ex-
amples of officers displaying acts of 
heroism while in the line of duty. I 
would like to include a few more from 
my district back in Cincinnati, Ohio. 
Officers Tiffany Mountjoy and Chris 
Keene of the Franklin, Ohio, Police De-
partment, ran into a house engulfed in 
flames, without protective gear, to 
save the life of an 82-year-old woman 
who was trapped inside. 
Cincinnati Police Officer Sonny Kim 
was shot and killed in the line of duty 
by an individual whose apparent mo-
tive was to lure and murder as many 
police officers as possible. 
Colerain 
Township 
Police 
Officer 
Dale Woods was responding to a traffic 
accident when he was hit by a truck. 
Officer Woods, a father of three chil-
dren, who had served the community 
with distinction for 15 years, died 3 
days later. 
Finally, one of most heroic occur-
rences by police officers in my congres-
sional district in recent memory took 
place a couple of years back when Cin-
cinnati police officers responded to an 
active shooter situation in downtown 
Cincinnati at the Fifth Third Bank on 
Fountain Square. Their quick actions 
saved the lives of countless civilians 
who were in the building that day, 
whose lives probably would have been 
lost but for their heroism. 
According to the FBI, there were 73 
law enforcement officers killed in the 
line of duty last year by felonious 
homicide, meaning they were killed 
with firearms, vehicles, knives, or as-
saults. That is nearly twice as many as 
were killed in the line of duty the year 
before. Of those, 32 officers were killed 
last year by ambush attack, which is 
twice as many as the previous 2 years 
combined. 
These numbers are quite disturbing, 
particularly when you consider that 
many Democrat elected officials across 
the country, and in this very House, 
support policies which are antipolice, 
like defunding the police or disman-
tling police departments or elimi-
nating 
qualified 
immunity, 
which 
means they could be sued personally as 
police officers. 
We need to be supporting our police 
officers all across the country, not im-
plementing policies that put them at 
risk. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend and colleague for 
being a continual champion for our law 
enforcement officers. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
OBERNOLTE), my friend and colleague 
and a champion for law enforcement. 
Mr. OBERNOLTE. Madam Speaker, 
this last year has seen an unprece-
dented wave of violence against law en-
forcement officers across our country. 
In particular, in my home State of 
California, 23 law enforcement agents 
were shot in the line of duty last year. 
In my own district, the Eighth District 
of California, one was unfortunately 
shot and killed by gunfire. That was 
Sergeant Dominic Vaca of the San 
Bernardino County Sheriff’s Depart-
ment. 
Congress needs to work to support 
and improve our law enforcement agen-
cies, not to defund or dismantle them. 
I am committed to protecting our 
law enforcement agencies and to de-
fending the rule of law across our coun-
try and their efforts to keep our com-
munity safe. 
Madam Speaker, last year, I was 
proud to host a dinner in honor of 15 of 
California’s Eighth’s first responder 
community who went above and be-
yond the call of duty last year to serve 
and protect our community. 
Amongst our honorees were San 
Bernardino 
County 
Deputy 
Sheriff 
Dustin Whitson, who was shot in the 
line of duty while responding to a call 
at a storage facility in Hesperia; Cali-
fornia Highway Patrol Inland Division 
Officer Garret Morris, who helps run an 
after-school racing team to provide 
community support and a safe alter-
native to illegal street racing for kids 
in our community; San Bernardino 
County Deputy Sheriff Tiffany Kautz, 
who was instrumental in obtaining the 
arrest and conviction of a man who was 
sexually abusing his own stepchildren; 
San Bernardino County Probation Cor-
rections 
Supervisor 
Gina 
Martinez, 
who passed away last September after 
21 years of ensuring that each youth in 
her care obtained a diploma, employ-
ment, and a place that they could call 
home and feel safe. 
Madam Speaker, these law enforce-
ment officers are examples of the dedi-
cation our first responders show to our 
community every day, and their stories 
are echoed by countless law enforce-
ment personnel across our country. 
Madam Speaker, it is time that this 
Congress stands behind our law en-
forcement officers and the rule of law. 
Madam Speaker, I thank each of our 
law enforcement officers for their dedi-
cation to our community. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend and colleague from 
the great State of California for con-
tinuing to be a champion for our police 
departments and law enforcement offi-
cers. 
Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to 
the time remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Florida has 7 minutes 
remaining. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, it 
is pretty challenging to be standing in 
a room that, from the view of C–SPAN, 
is filled. But I can tell you right now 
that it is just you and me, Madam 
Speaker, as well as my colleague from 
the Sunshine State, Representative 
RUTHERFORD, behind me, as well as 
some of our fantastic staff here on the 
House floor. 
b 2150 
I think it is time that we stop play-
ing these partisan games and really 
come together because this truly is a 
bipartisan issue. This is an issue that 
affects our communities as a whole, 
and I think if we are going to call for 
responsibility, actions, and words, we 
should start in this Chamber. 
I have a quote here that I wanted to 
read from one of our colleagues. It 
says: ‘‘I am going to make sure that I 
have security because I know I have 
had attempts on my life, and I have too 
much work to do. There are too many 
people that need help right now. So, if 
I end up spending $200,000, if I spend $10 
more on it, you know what? I get to be 
here to do the work. So suck it up, and 
defunding the police has to happen. We 
need to defund the police and put that 
money into social safety nets because 
we are trying to save lives.’’ Madam 
Speaker, those are your words. 
See, when I was homeless about a 
decade ago, I wasn’t privileged enough 
to have $200,000 to spend on private se-
curity. In fact, it was a comfort know-
ing that at any moment, in some of the 
toughest situations that were hap-
pening around us—violence, abuse— 
that a quick call to 911 would result in 
someone coming to help. We had noth-
ing but the reassurance that on the 
other end of that line, someone was 
coming to help, someone was willing to 
answer the call. 
I know that there is far more in this 
country that unites us than divides us, 
but I cannot tell you how disappointed 
I am as we have stood here for the last 
hour reciting stories of heroism, of 
selflessness—if I had time, I would re-
cite the names of our fallen officers, 
but I simply haven’t enough time. And, 
quite frankly, Madam Speaker, you 
haven’t even looked up off your phone. 
To Americans who are watching this, 
know that there are people in this Con-
gress who do give a damn, who will 
look up off their phone, who are not 
too bothered to listen. We will not stop 
fighting. We will continue to back the 
blue. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

f 
ECONOMIC GROWTH 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, on 
Friday, our country received another 
extraordinary bit of news about the 
state of our economic recovery. Last 
month, the economy created 467,000 
new jobs, far exceeding all expecta-
tions. This comes on the heels of news 
that our economy grew at its fastest 
rate in decades last year. 
With last week’s jobs numbers, the 
U.S. economy now has added a total of 
6.6 million jobs in President Biden’s 
first year in office. Let me say that 
again. In 1 year alone, the economy has 
added a whopping 6.6 million jobs back 
to the economy—the most ever re-
corded for a President’s first year. This 
includes the creation of 367,000 manu-
facturing jobs—the most in 30 years. 
For all the difficulties of the past 2 
years and for the real challenges our 
economy faces today, this jobs number 
is a remarkable milestone. It is a re-
minder that who gets elected to office 
makes a big difference. 
A year ago, Democrats promised to 
fix the mess our country was in after 
President Trump botched our pandemic 
response. We promised to lift our econ-
omy out of the abyss, to get people 
back to work, back to the classroom, 
and to do it safely by following the 
science. It is why Democrats worked 
furiously last year to pass the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan. It is why the Senate 
came together to pass USICA, which 
we will work to enact into law in the 
near future. It is why we came together 
to pass a historic, bipartisan infra-
structure package that is now putting 
people back to work fixing our roads, 
bridges, internet, lead piping, and so 
much more. 
With 6.6 million jobs gained and 
record economic growth in our first 
year, Democrats are delivering on our 
promise. And it is not just that job cre-
ation exceeded expectations; wages for 
American workers grew in 2021, and in-
dications from top forecasters are that 
wages will continue to grow in 2022. 
A year into executing our Demo-
cratic agenda, the American economy 
is in the midst of a historic turn-
around, but the job is not over. Even as 
wages are up, Democrats are taking ac-
tion to lower costs. We need to help ev-
eryday families afford the daily essen-
tials, just as we need to relieve our 
supply chains and rebuild American 
manufacturing, including by focusing 
on critical technologies like semi-
conductors.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S530 
February 7, 2022 
We took an important step in the 
right direction last week after the 
House passed the companion legisla-
tion to USICA. I applaud the House for 
passing this legislation, and I join my 
Senate colleagues from both sides of 
the aisle in saying we were pleased to 
have gotten the ball rolling when we 
passed the USICA bill—formally known 
as Endless Frontiers—last summer. 
There is a lot of work to do to enact 
USICA into law, so I look forward to 
moving quickly to a conference so the 
House and Senate can bridge the dif-
ferences between our proposals. 
Once again, I want to thank my col-
leagues from both sides of the aisle for 
leadership on this very important leg-
islation. 
This will continue to be Democrats’ 
focus: lowering costs, increasing wages, 
and bringing jobs back from overseas, 
while creating more jobs right here at 
home. It is what Democrats have 
worked on for the past 12 months as we 
have helped Americans get back to nor-
mal, and it is what we will continue to 
focus on as we enter year 2 of the Biden 
administration. 
f 
FORCED ARBITRATION 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
now on forced arbitration. 
On a different matter, later today, 
the House is expected to pass bipar-
tisan legislation to end forced arbitra-
tion for sexual assault and sexual har-
assment. Once this important bill 
passes the House, the Senate will move 
as soon as this week to quickly take up 
this bill and send it to President 
Biden’s desk. Congress can finally act 
to empower victims of sexual assault 
and sexual harassment to speak openly 
by nullifying forced arbitration clauses 
that push survivors into an often secret 
and biased process. We will not waste 
this historic opportunity. 
There are numerous good proposals 
that we can address here in the Senate 
on a bipartisan basis, and this is one 
good example. We hope to do more. The 
Senate’s forced arbitration proposal, 
the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sex-
ual Assault and Sexual Harassment 
Act of 2021, passed unanimously out of 
the Judiciary Committee. Every Demo-
crat and every Republican voted for it. 
I expect there will be strong, bipartisan 
support for it on the Senate floor. I 
want to thank my colleagues Senator 
KIRSTEN
GILLIBRAND
and 
Senator 
LINDSEY GRAHAM for their leadership 
on this important legislation. 
f 
BOMB THREATS AT HISTORICALLY 
BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVER-
SITIES 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
next, bomb threats at HCBUs. 
All of us in the Senate are disturbed, 
sickened, and outraged, frankly, at the 
wave of anonymous bomb threats that 
have recently arisen across dozens of 
historically Black colleges and univer-
sities. Since the start of this year, at 
least 26 HBCUs in a dozen States and 
the District of Columbia have received 
such threats, including a dozen schools 
last week. These bomb threats are 
clearly racially motivated, and I join 
my colleagues in condemning these 
acts of hatred in the strongest possible 
terms. 
Bomb threats against HBCUs have an 
especially malevolent place in our 
country’s history. Black Americans 
don’t need to think that far back to 
when bombs were set off in the middle 
of the campus at Florida A&M Univer-
sity in 1999. To see these threats today 
is a reminder of the hatred we have yet 
to overcome. 
Nothing can be more sickening than 
efforts to use fear, violence, and White 
supremacy in hopes of stealing the 
promise of a good education for mil-
lions of Black Americans. HBCUs are a 
vital part of our economy and edu-
cation system, educating some of our 
Nation’s greatest leaders, innovators, 
and activists. 
I want to commend all the presi-
dents, faculty, and staff across the 
country’s HBCUs for responding to 
these acts of hatred with resolve and 
strength. And to all the students who 
attend HBCUs, this should never hap-
pen. Those responsible must—must—be 
prosecuted to the fullest extent of law. 
My colleagues and I have been in 
communication with the FBI, Home-
land Security, the Department of Jus-
tice, and the Department of Education 
on steps the Agencies and the Senate 
can take to address these violent 
threats. We are confident those respon-
sible will be held accountable.

JANUARY 6 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, on 
an entirely different matter, normally 
I don’t make a point of remarking upon 
actions and statements of the Repub-
lican National Committee, which by 
now has completely fallen under the 
control of former President Donald 
Trump and his inner circle, but last 
week, they crossed a line, issuing a 
statement that censured two Repub-
licans who stood up to the Big Lie, 
while also describing the insurrection 
of January 6 as ‘‘legitimate political 
discourse.’’ 
Their 
statement 
didn’t 
even make mention of the violence 
that day. 
There is no debate to be had here. 
January 6 was an armed insurrection. 
It was an attempt to reverse through 
violent means the outcome of a free 
and fair election, and it was fundamen-
tally rooted in Donald Trump’s Big Lie 
that the election of 2020 was illegit-
imate, which now the RNC seems to be 
giving its blessing officially. 
For the national committee of one of 
America’s two major political parties 
to officially sign on to the Big Lie—and 
more than that, to excuse the attack 
itself by attributing even a shred of le-
gitimacy to it—is chilling and plainly 
dangerous. It puts us on a road where 
our democracy is at risk. 
It is a sad commentary on how far 
the political arm of the GOP has gone 
that the RNC will go out of its way to 
punish its own Members who spoke out 
against the former President’s lies, 
while defending the rioters who tried 
to undo an election with mob rule. 
Theirs will be nothing less than ever-
lasting shame. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER

nized.

CHINA 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
this year’s Winter Olympics are offi-
cially underway on the home turf of 
the Chinese Communist Party. Of 
course, Americans are rooting hard for 
our outstanding Team USA athletes, 
but this year’s setting has also trained 
spotlights worldwide on the abuse and 
repression the CCP inflicts on its own 
people and aspires to inflict on much of 
the world. Unfortunately, this has also 
occasioned some instances of jaw-drop-
ping tone-deafness and gullibility from 
American voices. 
I noted on this floor several years 
ago that as China has modernized its 
economy, too many wealthy and pow-
erful American actors have seemed 
willing to help whitewash the CCP’s 
many abuses or at least turn a blind 
eye. Hollywood self-censoring our own 
American films to satisfy President Xi 
and his cronies is just one example. 
Well, last week, one American broad-
caster seemed to uncritically amplify 
the CCP’s propaganda goal when they 
included a member of the oppressed 
Uighur minority in the opening cere-
monies. 
This broadcaster called the CCP’s ob-
vious propaganda stunt ‘‘an in-your- 
face response to those Western nations, 
including the U.S., who have called 
this Chinese treatment of that group 
‘genocide.’ ’’ President Xi couldn’t have 
scripted it better. 
Also, last week, a faculty member at 
a Big Ten university went on TV and 
compared 
China’s 
secret 
police 
to 
American police officers and China’s 
tyranny to America’s voting laws. Here 
was the quote: 
Who are we to criticize China’s human 
rights record when we have ongoing attacks 
by the agents of the State against unarmed 
citizens, and we’ve got assaults on the voting 
rights of people of color in various States in 
this country? 
Really? Beyond absurd. 
The truth is, the CCP has turned 
Xinjiang Province into a giant oppres-
sion factory, where they enslave, steri-
lize, and commit genocide against the 
Muslim minority.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S531 
February 7, 2022 
The truth is, the CCP has systemati-
cally worn down human rights and de-
mocracy in Hong Kong and jailed 
Hongkongers for speaking up. 
The truth is, the CCP is an aggres-
sive, irresponsible presence in the Pa-
cific region and well beyond. 
America’s national security and eco-
nomic competition with the CCP is a 
defining challenge for our country— 
and not just us but for all our friends 
and partners around the world, anyone 
who values an international order built 
on freedom and self-determination in-
stead of their opposites. 
Last year, the Senate took some bi-
partisan steps to strengthen America’s 
hand in that competition. The bipar-
tisan U.S. Innovation and Competition 
Act was not any Senator’s or any com-
mittee’s or either party’s idea of a per-
fect bill, but this delicate compromise 
product made headway on issues from 
critical 
supply 
chains 
to 
counter-
espionage, to intellectual property. 
And the Senate passed the bill last 
June, and the House has done nothing 
for 8 months—nothing from House 
Democrats from last June until just 
last week. 
So a few days ago, instead of passing 
the 
Senate’s 
careful 
compromise, 
House Democrats slapped together a 
partisan bill stuffed with poison pills 
and the kinds of things they tried to 
put in their reckless tax-and-spending 
spree that failed at the end of last 
year. They didn’t even bother to try 
working with House Republicans. The 
whole 
exercise 
was 
completely 
unserious. 
House Democrats’ version mentions 
the word ‘‘climate’’ nearly as many 
times as it mentions the word ‘‘China.’’ 
It pours billions into the U.N. Green 
Climate Fund so the United States can 
borrow money from China to give it to 
an international body, which can then 
give it to China. 
Their bill even goes out of its way to 
include provisions on—listen to this— 
marijuana banking. 
China has been steadily building up 
its military and economic might, and 
the Democrats’ answer is to help Amer-
icans get high? 
Drug overdoses on fentanyl just be-
came the leading cause of death for 
Americans aged 18 to 45 across our en-
tire country. Much of this poison pours 
into our country from, of course, 
China. And Democrats’ plan to combat 
this is some more marijuana on the 
side? 
Needless to say, this is not a winning 
strategy for a global competition be-
tween great powers. 
So here is the bottom line. The bipar-
tisan Senate USICA bill was itself a 
delicate 
compromise 
product. 
Any 
Democrats hoping to yank the bill to 
the far left or insert poison pills are 
badly, badly mistaken. 
f 
GERMAN CHANCELLOR OLAF 
SCHOLZ VISIT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
on another matter, today President 
Biden will welcome Olaf Scholz, the 
new German Chancellor, to his first 
visit to Washington since taking office. 
Germany is a crucial ally of the 
United States. Tens of thousands of 
U.S. servicemembers reside in Ger-
many, contributing to the collective 
security of the NATO alliance. Accord-
ing to the State Department, bilateral 
trade between our countries totaled 
more than $260 billion in 2019. 
Many in Washington on both sides of 
the aisle appreciated the increasing 
leadership 
role 
that 
Chancellor 
Scholz’s predecessor, Angela Merkel, 
played in international affairs. Ger-
many’s overseas contributions in Af-
ghanistan, 
Iraq, 
and 
Africa 
dem-
onstrated a growing willingness to con-
tribute to international missions that 
advance our collective security inter-
ests. 
The German people have built the 
largest economy in Europe and the 
fourth largest in the entire world. They 
are indeed a major player, but there is 
no question Germany could do more 
given its influential role, including 
within the EU and NATO, to advance 
our shared foreign policy and security 
interests. 
Back during the Cold War, the West 
German military was truly a capable 
fighting force, but Germany’s military 
has been allowed to atrophy in the dec-
ades since. Today, it lags behind the 
state of the art and suffers from short-
falls in readiness and regular mainte-
nance. 
Germany endorsed the 2014 NATO 
pledge to commit 2 percent of its GDP 
to defense and 20 percent of that de-
fense spending toward modernization 
by 2024. But it has taken very few cred-
ible steps to meet that pledge. 
Meanwhile, threats to the alliance 
have only grown since 2014. Russia’s 
and China’s decades-long moderniza-
tion efforts made it clear that 2 per-
cent will not suffice for NATO to meet 
these growing challenges. 
Here in Congress, we have dem-
onstrated our commitment to NATO 
and to Europe’s security. We hosted 
Jens Stoltenberg for a joint address to 
Congress 3 years ago. We have included 
measures supporting America’s pres-
ence in Europe in our annual Defense 
bills, including significant investments 
in our European Deterrence Initiative. 
So I hope that Chancellor Scholz will 
reciprocate and take this opportunity 
to reassure us about Germany’s com-
mitment to NATO and our collective 
defense. Our friends are too powerful 
and too prosperous not to contribute 
more militarily to our alliance. 
Of course, building military capabili-
ties takes time. But the urgent issue of 
Russian aggression in Europe also de-
mands courage and firmness, and it de-
mands it right now. We know how such 
resolve works. The United States and 
our allies displayed such firmness 
again and again in standing up to So-
viet pressure, and West Berlin re-
mained a free city because of it. 
Chancellor Scholz has plenty of tools 
at his disposal to join his allies in send-
ing a strong signal to Putin that ag-
gression against Ukraine would carry a 
tremendous—tremendous—cost. 
So let’s take one example. A bipar-
tisan chorus in Congress has opposed 
the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline for years. 
We have viewed it as a new geopolitical 
tool for Putin to undermine Ukraine 
and divide Europe. Germany acknowl-
edges the international community’s 
concerns, hence German delays in mov-
ing the project forward. 
It would be a powerful demonstration 
of German leadership for Chancellor 
Scholz to declare firmly and simply 
that Russian escalation in Europe will 
result in the termination—the termi-
nation—of Nord Stream 2—not another 
pause, the end of the pipeline, period. 
Likewise, it would send an important 
message if Chancellor Scholz commits, 
like other NATO allies have done and 
like his own predecessor’s national se-
curity advisor just recommended, that 
Germany will help Ukraine with legiti-
mate military capabilities so that it 
can better defend itself against aggres-
sion. 
So, in conclusion, Germany has been 
an important pillar in NATO and a 
strong ally of the United States lit-
erally for decades. We welcome the new 
Chancellor to American soil. The time 
is now—now—for Germany to stand up 
and protect the peace and defend the 
stable Europe that modern Germany 
itself has helped construct and from 
which it has greatly benefited.

JANUARY 6 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, if 
you have any memory of the Soviet 
Union, you can remember that when 
Moscow was in its ascendancy in that 
region of the world, their plan included 
a revision of history. They rewrote 
chapters of history to make themselves 
look stronger and better and smarter 
and more powerful than they ever 
were. 
And we used to mock that in the 
West and say: Don’t they know that 
history speaks for itself? The facts 
speak for themselves. They did it time 
and again. 
It was usually the product of authori-
tarian 
rule, 
where 
one 
man— 
strongman—would want his version of 
history to be written in the books and 
taught to the children. 
Last week, we saw an exercise in So-
viet revisionism in, of all places, Salt 
Lake City, UT. The Republican Na-
tional Committee met in Salt Lake 
City, UT, for a national conference, 
and representatives came from all over 
the United States. 
What they did to start that con-
ference off was to censure two Repub-
lican House Members, LIZ CHENEY and 
ADAM KINZINGER from Illinois. To me, 
it was the lowest of low tactics to at-
tack these two individuals who are 
making a bipartisan effort with the 
January 6, 2021, House committee to

February 7, 2022 
get to the bottom of what happened 
that day and who was responsible for 
it. 
You might remember that there was 
a proposal from Speaker PELOSI that 
we create a bipartisan Commission 
wherein the House and Senate Demo-
crats and Republicans would turn this 
matter over, as we have before to a 
group, to determine what happened 
that day and what was behind it to 
avoid its ever happening again and to 
get one clear definition for history 
from this bipartisan Commission. 
The Commission idea was stopped by 
Senator MCCONNELL, the Republican 
leader in the Senate. He refused to 
agree on this bipartisan approach. So 
Speaker PELOSI, realizing she had a 
scant majority in the House, said that 
she was going to still try to put such 
an investigation together. She invited 
Republican participation, which didn’t 
work out well. Eventually, two stepped 
forward—Congresswoman CHENEY
and 
Congressman KINZINGER—and said they 
would participate. 
I know ADAM KINZINGER. He is from 
my State. We have worked on a few 
things together. I respect him for his 
political courage time and again to 
speak out as he has. I am sorry that he 
was the subject of that censure. 
Sadly, that was not the only mistake 
made in the Salt Lake City Republican 
revisionary meeting. What was even 
worse, if anything could be worse, was 
the declaration by the Republican Na-
tional Committee that what happened 
in this building—in this room—on Jan-
uary 6, 2021, was somehow character-
ized by a unanimous vote as legitimate 
political discourse. 
The Acting President pro tempore re-
members that day, and I do, too. I 
can’t forget it. It was when Vice Presi-
dent Pence was sitting where you are 
today, and a few minutes after 2 
o’clock, the Secret Service came in and 
whisked him off the platform. We were 
told there was an attack on the Capitol 
taking place. 
Earlier, there had been a rally, spon-
sored by President Trump, and he had 
incited this insurrectionist mob to 
come up to the Capitol to be heard and 
seen. They knew why that day was cho-
sen. January 6 was the day we were 
counting the electoral college vote— 
the official vote on the selection of Jo-
seph Biden as President of the United 
States. It was the intention of Presi-
dent Trump and those who came here 
to interrupt that constitutional proc-
ess. 
It is interesting as well that last 
week, Vice President Pence, at a Fed-
eralist Society meeting, spoke out on 
the subject and said for the first time 
that I can recall since he was chosen as 
Vice President that, in fact, President 
Trump was wrong—wrong in believing 
that he had the power as Vice Presi-
dent to change the electoral college 
vote. Pence made it clear that he did 
not have that authority. 
Well, the Republican National Com-
mittee went further in trying to pro-
mote the Big Lie and called what hap-
pened on January 6 in this Capitol 
Building legitimate political discourse. 
Do they honestly believe that break-
ing down the windows and doors of this 
building to enter as an unruly mob is 
legitimate political discourse? 
Do they believe that spraying toxic 
bear spray in the faces of our police-
men is legitimate political discourse? 
Do they believe that 140 injured po-
licemen and 5 people who are deceased 
as a result of that mob action was 
somehow legitimate political discourse 
and that, as they came into the Cham-
ber—these demonstrators who were 
aping themselves in front of cameras 
for their friends to take pictures—sit-
ting in the chair where the Acting 
President pro tempore is sitting today 
and going through my desk and other 
desks here to see if there was anything 
they could take a picture of or steal— 
that that was legitimate political dis-
course? 
Do they believe that incitement to 
violence by President Trump to send 
this mob up here was legitimate polit-
ical discourse? 
Shame on the Grand Old Party. 
Shame on Mr. Lincoln’s party. They 
should know better. I am glad that a 
handful have stood up and spoken up. I 
wish more would. 
If we are ever going to put an end to 
Trumpism in this country and in the 
Republican Party, only the Repub-
licans can get it done. They have to de-
cide that enough is enough and step 
forward. 
It is interesting to me that, when 
Senator MCCONNELL came to the floor 
a few minutes ago, he talked about the 
statement of some Big Ten professor— 
he didn’t name his name—who was not 
respectful of our police. Of all of the 
things that happened in the last week 
that were not respectful of the police, I 
would certainly add the Salt Lake City 
Republican national meeting, where 
the attack on our police was character-
ized as legitimate political discourse. 
An incitement to violence was legiti-
mate political discourse. 
America is better than that. I sin-
cerely hope that real leaders within the 
Republican Party will reclaim their 
party and put an end to this madness 
that Trumpism has brought them.

CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, on 
an entirely different subject, on March 
26, 2020, America passed a grim mile-
stone when 1,000 Americans died that 
day of COVID—front page news. Two 
months later, after Memorial Day, we 
passed another terrible milestone when 
100,000 had died of COVID. As many 
Americans had died from COVID as 
from the Korean, Vietnam, Iraq, and 
Afghanistan wars combined. By this 
past September, the number of Ameri-
cans who had been lost to COVID hit 
695,000—memorialized 
in 
a 
heart-
breaking sea of small, white flags that 
covered our National Mall. This week-
end, the United States hit another 
staggering milestone—900,000 Ameri-
cans dead from COVID. In Illinois, 
there have been 31,000 lives lost. 
COVID–19 is now the third leading 
cause of death in the United States, be-
hind only heart disease and cancer. At 
the rate we are going, experts say it is 
likely the United States will reach 1 
million COVID deaths in just a few 
weeks. 
What makes these numbers even 
more tragic is that so many of the 
deaths could have been prevented. 
COVID vaccines are safe and free and 
highly effective at preventing COVID 
hospitalization and death. Think about 
this: According to new data from the 
CDC, unvaccinated individuals are 97 
times more likely to die of COVID 
compared to those who have been vac-
cinated and boosted—97 times more 
likely to die if you are unvaccinated. 
Just last night, I watched ‘‘60 Min-
utes.’’ There was a presentation by 
nurses in Louisville, KY, the home 
State of the Republican leader. They 
talked about the devastating toll on 
their emotions and even their physical 
bodies when it comes to the deaths 
that they have to witness every day. 
They are beaten down, these nurses. 
They say that some 25 percent, if I re-
member correctly, have already re-
signed and have said they can’t take it 
anymore. And to think how many of 
those hospitalizations could have been 
avoided if vaccinations had become 
universal across this country as they 
should be. 
Well, this evening, Members of Con-
gress will gather on the steps of the 
Capitol for a moment of silence to re-
member the 900,000 souls we have lost 
to this virus. May their families and 
loved ones find peace. 
We have the tools and knowledge to 
bring this pandemic under control if 
only we would use them. 
f 
THE ECONOMY 
Mr. 
DURBIN. 
Madam 
President, 
there was another set of numbers that 
was released last Friday that testifies 
to good news, and America needs it. It 
testifies to the resilience of the Amer-
ican people and the American spirit. 
Many economists had braced for a 
disastrous January jobs report. The 
most optimistic among them predicted 
that the U.S. economy might grow by 
150,000 or maybe 250,000 jobs last 
month. Some warned that it could 
show massive job losses. Here is what 
we learned: 
Despite the Omicron surge and the 
global supply chain shortages, U.S. em-
ployers added 467,000 new jobs last 
month—467,000. On top of that, the Bu-
reau of Labor Statistics shows us the 
economy added 700,000 more jobs in No-
vember and December than we initially 
calculated. All told, the U.S. economy 
has added 6.6 million jobs in the last 
year—the strongest first-year job gain 
of any President in history. 
When Joe Biden took over the office 
a little over a year ago, he inherited

S533 
February 7, 2022 
one of the weakest and fraught econo-
mies in generations. 
At the start of the pandemic, the 
U.S. unemployment rate spiked to 14.7 
percent. Last February, the Congres-
sional Budget Office forecasted that 
the United States would not see 3.9 per-
cent 
unemployment 
for 
another 
5 
years. The unemployment rate now is 
actually 4 percent. America’s economic 
recovery 
is 
breaking 
records. 
The 
United States was the first country in 
the G7 to recover all of its GDP lost by 
the pandemic. Average wages were up 
5.7 percent last month from a year ago. 
The increases were not all at the top; 
workers in the middle and lower rungs 
of the economy earned more too. 
I have to say, as important as that is, 
we all know that people working in 
this economy are also facing inflation 
and higher prices. Whether it is for gas-
oline or groceries, they are finding it 
more expensive to meet the basic ne-
cessities of life. Although this is good 
news, that is bad news that we have to 
address and should address on a bipar-
tisan basis. 
The progress that we have made was 
not inevitable; it was a product of good 
old-fashioned American ingenuity. It is 
also the result of bold and decisive eco-
nomic decisions by the Biden adminis-
tration. 
The American Rescue Plan, which 
Congress passed without the support of 
a single Republican Member of Con-
gress—all Democrats all the way— 
broke the grip of the pandemic on our 
economy. We were able to get shots in 
arms, help small businesses stay afloat, 
and rush emergency assistance to peo-
ple who had lost jobs or had seen their 
hours cut drastically. That emergency 
help worked in Illinois, and it worked 
all over this country. 
We also passed the bipartisan Infra-
structure Investment and Jobs Act. 
Let me remind those who follow, if you 
are wondering about the infrastructure 
bill passed by the Trump administra-
tion, let me put your concern to rest. 
There was no bill. There was no legisla-
tion. There was no infrastructure plan 
despite President Trump’s repeated 
promises to deliver one. He walked 
away from the table, and I was in the 
room when he did. He wouldn’t even 
negotiate. 
We have not fixed all of the weak-
nesses in our economy. The jobless rate 
among Black workers is still twice 
that of White workers. Unemployment 
among teens and young adults is still 
too high. Research from the National 
Women’s Law Center shows that, while 
men have recouped all job losses since 
the pandemic started, there are nearly 
1.1 million fewer women in the work-
force. Daycare is part of that calcula-
tion, I might add. If we want to reach 
our full economic potential, we need to 
help families find affordable, quality 
daycare, and we have to address the 
issue of inflation nonstop. 
UNITED STATES INNOVATION AND 
COMPETITION ACT 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, last 
year, for the first time in more than 
two decades, America’s economy grew 
faster than China’s. That is incredible. 
Let’s keep that streak going by passing 
USICA, the bipartisan U.S. Innovation 
and Competition Act. We need to pro-
mote products made in the United 
States by Americans and purchased in 
the United States. We passed it in the 
Senate last June by a vote of 2 to 1. 
The House passed its version last Fri-
day. Let’s go to conference and get this 
bill into law. If we negotiate in good 
faith, I believe we can do that. 
I want to thank Leader SCHUMER and 
Senator YOUNG, a Republican from In-
diana, for their leadership. 
This will boost competitiveness with 
China 
and 
help 
to 
reindustrialize 
America, make investments in manu-
facturing and research, and provide 
seed money to create good new jobs. 
Importantly, it includes $52 billion for 
research and designing and manufac-
turing semiconductor chips—what Sen-
ator CANTWELL, chair of the Commerce 
Committee, calls the ‘‘oil of the 21st 
century.’’ Let’s agree to make those 
chips here in America and not be de-
pendent 
on 
importing 
them 
from 
China. 
USICA also allows for new sanctions 
against China for human rights viola-
tions. We can stand up for American 
workers and American values. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
DUCKWORTH). Without objection, it is 
so ordered. 
f 
OFFICE OF NET ASSESSMENT 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
on November 18 of last year, I came 
here to speak about the Office of Net 
Assessment. That is an office within 
the Pentagon. That office’s purpose, 
under law, is to produce an annual net 
assessment, which is supposed to be a 
long-term look at our military’s capa-
bility and those of our greatest adver-
saries. I don’t think it lives up to its 
mission. 
In 2018, according to the Director of 
the Office of Net Assessment, that of-
fice had not produced a net assessment 
since 2007. Not doing its job for those 11 
years and—who knows—possibly longer 
calls into question whether this office 
should even exist. Yet a recent inspec-
tor general report states that the office 
‘‘produces . . . highly classified net as-
sessments.’’ I question the IG’s conclu-
sion based upon available evidence that 
I know about, and I will give some of 
that evidence. 
In last year’s speech here in the Sen-
ate and others that I have given over 
the years on this subject, I discussed 
my oversight of this office dating back 
to 2019. I also discussed my amendment 
to the national defense bill. That 
amendment would have done one very 
simple thing: required the Government 
Accountability 
Office 
to 
determine 
how much taxpayer money the Office 
of Net Assessment actually uses for net 
assessment—its purpose for existing. I 
want to know how much we can cut 
from their budget to save the tax-
payers money. 
Apparently, this type of pro-taxpayer 
legislation was too much to ask for. 
Accordingly, it appears that the Office 
of Net Assessment in the Department 
of Defense gets to keep operating like a 
Pentagon slush fund for irrelevant and 
political research projects. 
On February 5, 2020, the Director of 
the Office of Net Assessment told me: 
We review all deliverables to ensure 
they’re consistent with the statement of 
work. We evaluate each deliverable to assess 
whether we should seek additional informa-
tion or require a resubmission of commis-
sioned work. 
Now, I am going to return to that 
statement in a little bit, but I want to 
give you some evidence of why what he 
said doesn’t work out in reality. 
In December 2020, I asked the inspec-
tor general to take a deeper dive into 
the Office of Net Assessment’s con-
tracting practices. That means con-
necting all the dots in the contract 
transactions to ensure that everything 
matches up. The inspector general re-
viewed 20 contracts. On January 25 of 
this year, the inspector general issued 
its results and found these three or 
four points: 
Office of Net Assessment acquisition 
personnel inappropriately 
performed 
contracting officer representative du-
ties for 20 contracts. 
Next point. Office of Net Assessment 
acquisition personnel and an office pro-
viding contract support did not main-
tain complete contract files, including 
preawards and contract administration 
documentation. That also included the 
failure to maintain signed contracts 
and modifications. Since 2019, I have 
repeatedly asked for a full accounting 
of Stefan Halper’s contracts. Either 
they never had one or they have de-
cided to obstruct Congress. 
Next point. Office of Net Assessment 
acquisition personnel and an office pro-
viding contract support inappropri-
ately approved invoices for payments 
totaling $9.8 million dollars due to the 
lack of oversight. And that is just for 
the 20 contracts the inspector general 
sampled. So without required sup-
porting documentation for payment, 
the door is, obviously, wide open to 
fraud, theft, and improper payments. 
Next point. Without established and 
documented surveillance measures for 
Office of Net Assessment service con-
tracts, the Office of Net Assessment 
may not have received all services out-
lined in a contractor’s statement of 
work.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S534 
February 7, 2022 
Next point—and last point. At this 
point, the next finding ought to be no 
surprise from the inspector general. 
The Office of Net Assessment did not 
administer contracts in accordance 
with the Federal Defense Department 
and Washington Headquarters Services 
internal regulations and policies. 
Further, the audit states the ‘‘[Office 
of Net Assessment] acquisition per-
sonnel cannot verify whether they re-
ceived services, valued at $4.1 million, 
in accordance with the statement of 
work.’’ 
Now, let’s return back to that first 
quote I gave you from the Director of 
Net Assessment. 
We review all deliverables to ensure [that] 
they’re consistent with the statement of 
work. We evaluate each deliverable to assess 
whether we should seek additional informa-
tion or require a resubmission of commis-
sioned work. 
Based upon all of the available evi-
dence from these 20 contracts that 
were inspected by the inspector gen-
eral—and that is not all the contracts 
that the office negotiated—this Direc-
tor’s statement is absolutely false. 
So here is the bottom line: The Office 
of Net Assessment has no clue what 
they are paying for and whether they 
even received a complete work product. 
And whatever they are actually doing, 
it is not in compliance with Federal 
regulations, policy, and law. 
This is a complete embarrassment 
and a slap in the face of American tax-
payers. While the Office of Net Assess-
ment wasted millions of dollars in tax-
payer money every year, the com-
munist Chinese Government developed 
hypersonic missiles that can travel the 
globe. 
If this unit isn’t doing the job that 
they are supposed to, to assess our na-
tional security capabilities and the ca-
pabilities of our enemies, why are we 
still funding it? It would be better to 
take the $20 million budget and give it 
to our servicemembers. At least we 
know that those servicemembers have 
earned it. 
A government slush fund will always 
be a government slush fund unless Con-
gress, with our power of oversight and 
appropriations, steps up and fixes the 
problem. So I encourage my colleagues, 
especially those on the Senate Armed 
Services Committee, to take a stand 
against 
this 
blatant 
waste, 
fraud, 
abuse, and gross mismanagement. 
f 
FREE SPEECH 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
on another subject, I have come to this 
floor several times in recent months— 
maybe over the course of a couple of 
years—on 
my 
concerns about free 
speech on campus. There has been a lot 
said in opposition to reports of crack-
down on speech on campuses, but today 
I come to the floor to give one shining 
example of a university upholding ex-
pressions of free speech and making it 
still happen. 
This all started with former Univer-
sity of Chicago President Robert Zim-
mer. The institution, starting with him 
and 
continuing, 
has 
consistently 
pushed back on the trends of safe 
spaces, trigger warnings, and the can-
cellation of invited speakers. 
Instead, in a letter to all incoming 
freshmen, the University of Chicago 
lays 
out 
its 
philosophy 
in 
plain 
English. In the letter to the 2020 fresh-
man class, it said that one of the uni-
versity’s ‘‘defining characteristics is 
our commitment to freedom of inquiry 
and expression.’’ 
Now, this is more than just words; 
the university has consistently fol-
lowed through on this policy. Even 
today, the university is still open to 
dissenting points of view. It even goes 
so far as to tell freshmen ‘‘at times 
this may challenge you and even cause 
discomfort.’’ 
They are absolutely right. The point 
of college is not to be coddled. The 
point of college or university is to 
learn. How can students do that if they 
don’t step out of their comfort zone? 
I often say that my definition of a 
university is a place where controversy 
should run rampant. At the University 
of Chicago, that means noting that ‘‘di-
versity of opinion and background is a 
fundamental strength of our commu-
nity.’’ 
Both opinion and background are 
very important, and it defeats the 
point to just have the one. Our univer-
sities cannot just have just a veneer of 
diversity; the whole point of bringing 
in students of different backgrounds is 
to get different points of view. That 
aim is meaningless if all students who 
go to the college believe the same 
things. 
I have introduced several bills to pro-
vide transparency for prospective stu-
dents. My bills focus on transparency 
of cost, but in many ways openness 
about a university’s values are just as 
important. 
So I congratulate former President 
Zimmer, who is doing just that and 
putting his university’s values on his 
sleeve. If some schools keep cracking 
down on free speech and invited speak-
ers, then the free market will send 
their students elsewhere. That is be-
cause I don’t think all kids want to go 
to a school where they will never be 
challenged and where their ideals will 
always be reaffirmed. 
I am happy to see projects like the 
University of Austin, a newly founded 
college dedicated to free speech prin-
ciples. 
So, in conclusion, it takes time to 
start new institutions. Instead, we 
need people to stand up in the colleges 
that we already have. And I hope oth-
ers will join me in doing just that. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

OPEN APP MARKETS ACT 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, here in the United States, the 
mobile app market represents a reli-
able multibillion-dollar payday for Big 
Tech. In 2020, Americans downloaded 
13.4 billion apps onto their mobile de-
vices. 
Needless to say, mobile apps are a 
key component of our digital economy, 
so it may be surprising to learn that 
this market is largely unregulated, un-
less you count the influence of the two 
mega corporations that created it. 
Apple and Google have abused their 
power and used their status as gate-
keepers to stifle innovation and penal-
ize developers who want to work along-
side them rather than ceding control 
over their products. This is bad for the 
industry. It is bad for consumers. It is 
bad for the country. 
These gatekeeping tendencies aren’t 
just a bump in the road for developers; 
they are a roadblock that completely 
closes off avenues of competition. 
Apple, for example, forces developers 
to use their exorbitantly expensive App 
Store payment system, which funnels 
profits away from the creators, and it 
raises prices for consumers. It is a 
take-it-or-leave-it 
arrangement. 
Of 
course, when developers do take the 
deal, they leave their relationship with 
their customers behind because the 
terms prohibit them from dealing di-
rectly with the people who use their 
products. They also have to accept that 
Apple 
and 
Google 
will 
not 
only 
prioritize native applications, but they 
will take their competitors’ confiden-
tial business information and use it 
against them. 
Last week, the Senate Judiciary 
Committee passed my Open App Mar-
kets Act, which is a bill we have 
worked some very long hours on. Fi-
nally, we are addressing the strangle-
hold Big Tech has on the digital app 
market. I really do thank Senator 
BLUMENTHAL and his staff, as well as 
our cosponsors, Senators KLOBUCHAR, 
RUBIO, LUMMIS, BOOKER, GRAHAM, KEN-
NEDY, HIRONO, HAWLEY, and Chairman 
DURBIN, for putting in so much time 
and effort to create this bipartisan 
piece of legislation. 
This bill will reset the rules of the 
road to protect competition and con-
sumers by allowing consumers to ac-
cess third-party apps and app stores, by 
prohibiting app store owners from 
locking developers into in-app payment 
arrangements, by ensuring that app de-
velopers are allowed to offer competi-
tive pricing, and by preventing app 
stores from misusing confidential busi-
ness information or app store rankings 
to disadvantage developers. If app store 
gatekeepers violate these rules of the 
road, the bill allows for developer law-
suits. It also includes safeguards to 
allow app stores to protect the privacy, 
security, and safety of consumers, as 
well as their own intellectual property 
rights. 
It is bipartisan, and it is a good, 
solid, strong first step. But, remember, 
our tradition of maintaining competi-
tive marketplaces isn’t the only thing 
at stake here. 
This weekend, the opening cere-
monies of the Olympic Games in Bei-
jing drew in 16 million viewers. That is 
down from the last Winter Games in 
2018, so hopefully, this means that the 
various campaigns exposing the crimes 
and manipulation of the Chinese Com-
munist Party are making a difference. 
But, still, those 16 million people and 
their families are taking in Chinese 
propaganda. 
The 
Games’ 
corporate 
sponsors weren’t worried about that; 
they were happy to take advantage of 
all those eyeballs. And we know NBC 
hopes to surpass the nearly $2 billion in 
revenue they pulled in during the 
Tokyo Games. 
Protecting that competitiveness is 
important, but I would argue that pro-
tecting the human rights of people 
those sponsors and broadcasters are 
happy to sweep under the rug is even 
more important. And right at this very 
moment, 
Big 
Tech 
is 
facilitating 
crimes against humanity in China. 
Beijing is notorious for censoring 
speech critical of the communist gov-
ernment, but part of their grand strat-
egy to silence dissent involves strong- 
arming corporations seeking access to 
the very lucrative Chinese market. It 
is not enough to offer an exciting prod-
uct; you have to play nice with the 
CCP or else you are out. You can’t be 
in their market. That means staying 
quiet about genocide in Xinjiang or 
violent repression in Hong Kong and 
doing everything in your power to 
make sure your customers stay silent 
too. 
The Open App Markets Act has re-
ceived an outpouring of support from 
human rights activists who see first-
hand how corporate gatekeeping ac-
tively endangers the lives of dissidents, 
activists, Uighur Muslims, Mongols, 
Tibetans, Hong Kong freedom fighters, 
and other innocent people the CCP has 
chosen to brutalize. We received a let-
ter of support for the Open App Mar-
kets Act signed by many of these indi-
viduals that I would like to share. 
They wrote, in part: 
China suppresses nearly all dissent using 
its notorious ‘‘Great Firewall’’ internet fil-
tering system and through the cooperation 
of domestic and foreign companies that are 
willing to block and remove accounts, con-
tent, and applications at the unchallenged 
request of Chinese authorities. 
Few American companies are as subser-
vient to the Chinese government as Apple. 
Apple willingly censors dissenting voices and 
independent media for all in China and Hong 
Kong using its control over the App Store. 
We received another letter from the 
human rights organization GreatFire 
that details specific examples of Apple 
doing the bidding of the Chinese Com-
munist Party. They wrote in part: 
GreatFire, an organization dedicated to 
fighting internet censorship, started moni-
toring Apple’s censorship in November 2013, 
when Apple decided to remove our ‘‘Free 
Weibo’’ application from the Chinese App 
Store. Apple did not even wait for the inter-
vention of any Chinese judicial authority to 
determine if our app had actually broken 
any Chinese law. It collaborated with the 
Chinese authorities and dealt with our app 
the same way it has continued to deal with 
many more apps: by enforcing arbitrary and 
politically motivated censorship to ensure 
its financial interest. 
I ask unanimous consent to have 
these 
two 
letters 
printed 
in 
the 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

the abuses of tech firms, we encourage it to

privacy and security tools in China through 
protecting the right to sideload, as included 
in the Open App Markets Act.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S536 
February 7, 2022 
The Chinese Communist Party maintains 
its grip on power and its regional expan-
sionism through operating the most sophisti-
cated censorship and surveillance apparatus 
in history. China suppresses nearly all dis-
sent using its notorious ‘Great Firewall’ 
internet filtering system and through the co-
operation of domestic and foreign companies 
that are willing to block and remove ac-
counts, content, and applications at the un-
challenged request of Chinese authorities. 
Few American companies are as subser-
vient to the Chinese government as Apple. 
Apple willingly censors dissenting voices and 
independent media for all in China and Hong 
Kong using its control over App Store. As 
the New York Times, human rights organiza-
tions, and members of this Committee have 
thoroughly documented, Apple has blocked 
thousands of applications for iOS users in 
China and Hong Kong at the request of Chi-
nese censors. Apple’s decade-long track 
record cooperation with Chinese censorship 
is sweeping and stunning, including through 
its blocking of: 
HKmap.live, a coordination tool used by 
protestors bravely standing up to China’s at-
tempts to destroy Hong Kong’s independence 
and democracy; 
Bible and Quranic apps, including the Olive 
Tree Bible study guide; 
Radio Free Asia and Voice of America, 
Congressionally-funded independent media 
organizations that provides news in Chinese, 
Uyghur, and Tibetan languages; and, 
Anti-censorship services, including apps 
funded by Congress, designed to bypass the 
Great Firewall to provide unfiltered and se-
cure access to information, social media, and 
news. 
While Apple claims to be a defender of 
human rights in the West, Apple has delib-
erately placed Chinese citizen’s lives in the 
hands of the Chinese government for profit, 
knowing the grave consequences. As the Con-
gressional-Executive Commission on China 
and others have warned, Apple hosts the pri-
vate data of its Chinese users in data centers 
controlled by the Chinese government with-
out the safeguards that would prevent spy-
ing, including weakening its access controls 
and encryption. As a result, Chinese citizens 
are unable to access independent news, prac-
tice their faith, or express themselves freely 
without real fear of the brutal repression of 
the state. 
While our organizations have decades of 
expertise fight back against China’s repres-
sion, Apple’s complete dominance over iOS 
blocks us from offering tools to bypass cen-
sorship, prevent spying, and promote democ-
racy. Our pleas and campaigns for Apple to 
do the right thing have been ignored by Ap-
ple’s leadership. If we were allowed to pro-
vide apps outside of the censored App Store, 
also known as sideloading, we would be able 
finally offer Chinese communities with tools 
to defeat the Great Firewall, such as 
Ultrasurf, Psiphon, and FreeGate. The Open 
App 
Markets 
Act’s 
protections 
for 
sideloading would help us open up the world 
to hundreds of millions more Chinese people 
living under repression aided by Apple. 
As the Senate Judiciary Committee con-
siders the Open App Markets Act, we encour-
age it stand firm on behalf of freedom of ex-
pression and human rights in China through 
protecting our right to offer a lifeline to dis-
sidents, religious communities, and all those 
banned by the Chinese Communist Party.

GREATFIRE, 
January 28, 2022. 
Subject: Censorship by Apple. 
DEAR
CHAIR
DURBIN, RANKING
MEMBER 
GRASSLEY, AND MEMBERS OF THE SENATE JU-
DICIARY COMMITTEE: As the Committee con-
siders legislation to address the power of Big 
Tech, we write to share our research and 
longstanding concerns regarding Apple’s cen-
sorship on behalf of the People’s Republic of 
China and other repressive regimes. 
GreatFire, an organization dedicated to 
fighting internet censorship, started moni-
toring Apple’s censorship in November 2013, 
when 
Apple 
decided 
to 
remove 
our 
‘‘FreeWeibo’’ application from the Chinese 
App Store. Apple did not even wait for the 
intervention of any Chinese judicial author-
ity to determine if our app had actually bro-
ken any Chinese law. It collaborated with 
the Chinese authorities and dealt with our 
app the same way it has continued to deal 
with many more apps: by enforcing arbitrary 
and politically motivated censorship to en-
sure its financial interests. 
In 2019, we launched AppleCensorship.com, 
a website monitoring Apple’s removal of 
apps on its App Stores around the world. 
Over the last three years, we have uncovered 
numerous cases of app removals, particularly 
in China, where Apple collaborates with the 
Chinese authorities by enforcing arbitrary 
and politically motivated censorship to pro-
tect its financial interests. 
Our research has produced the following 
key findings: 
Apple proactively removes apps that allow 
Chinese citizens to circumvent censorship, 
all without the need for the authorities to 
intervene. None of the top 100 ‘‘virtual pri-
vate network services’’ (VPNs) in the United 
States App Store are available in China. 
In October 2019, during the Hong Kong pro-
tests violently suppressed by the police, 
Apple removed HKmap.live, an app used by 
protesters to report aggressive police move-
ments and the use of tear gas. 
AppleCensorship.com counts 191 ‘‘News’’ 
apps currently unavailable in China’s App 
Store. The New York Times app was removed 
in January 2017. Quartz was removed during 
the Hong Kong protests in 2019. 
More than 26% of all apps tested were 
found to be unavailable in China, when the 
average for other countries is around 11% 
and when less than 5% of all apps that we 
tested in the U.S. App Store were unavail-
able. 
A study that we conducted with Tibetan 
human rights groups and released in June 
2019 revealed that at least 29 Tibetan-themed 
apps dealing with news, religious study, 
tourism and even games are being censored 
by Apple. 
In September 2021, we detected the removal 
of Bible and Quran apps in China. 
In June 2020, Apple removed two podcast 
apps, Pocket Casts and Castro, after the de-
velopers refused to censor content on their 
platforms. 
Two RSS reader apps, Reeder and Fiery 
Feeds, were removed in September 2020 for 
content deemed ‘‘illegal in China’’. 
Apple’s censorship is not limited to China 
and affects all countries where Apple oper-
ates: 
In November 2021, Apple’s removed the 
‘‘Smart Voting’’ app developed by the team 
associated with Russian political opposition 
leader Alexei Navalny. The app, which in-
formed its users about candidates for the 
Parliamentary elections and their political 
affiliation, was removed just as polls opened. 
Apple went further by contacting private 
messaging app Telegram to request the re-
moval of content (i.e. a chat bot) related to 
Navalny’s campaign. Telegram published a 
statement condemning the move but stating 
it had to comply with Apple in order to avoid 
being removed from the App Store. 
In June 2021, our research on LGBTQ+ re-
lated apps revealed that, out of approxi-
mately 150 LGBTQ+ apps identified, 61 apps 
were partially unavailable. China came sec-
ond in terms of unavailability, with 27 
LGBTQ+ apps unavailable in the country, 
just behind Saudi Arabia (28 apps unavail-
able) and before United Arab Emirates (25 
apps unavailable). In total, 1377 instances of 
LGBTQ+ app’s unavailability were found in 
152 countries (only Australia’s, Canada’s and 
US’ App Store contained all the tested apps). 
In addition to targeted removal, that is to 
say removals of apps in the App Store of the 
requesting country, which result from al-
leged ‘‘legal violations’’, Apple also responds 
to governments’ requests made on the basis 
of alleged violations of Apple’s own ‘‘Plat-
form 
Policy’’. 
Such 
takedown 
requests, 
mostly originating from authoritarian re-
gimes like China and Russia, led to approxi-
mately 30,000 removals in 175 countries be-
tween January 2019 and December 2020. 
The list of compromises by Apple over the 
last five years is not limited to censorship on

the App Store. For example, Apple’s own 
podcasting app remains available in China, 
as Apple proactively removes ‘‘sensitive’’ 
podcasts. Although there are too many com-
promises that threaten human rights to be 
fully listed here, in 2021 only, Apple: 
facilitated access by the Chinese authori-
ties to iCloud data for Chinese users; 
decided not to release its new ‘‘Private 
Relay’’ feature in China and other countries; 
and 
censored Chinese consumers by preventing 
them from engraving ‘‘sensitive’’ content on 
their Apple products (iPads or Airtags). 
Apple discloses almost no information on 
app removals, hiding the full scope of com-
pliance with Chinese censorship. In some 
cases, apps’ developers or publishers were 
not aware of their app’s unavailability until 
we contacted them. In October, 2017, Sen-
ators Cruz and Leahy wrote to Apple asking 
questions about censorship in its China App 
Store. In Apple’s response, the company ad-
mitted to having removed 674 VPNs from the 
China App Store at the request of the Chi-
nese government. These VPNs would have al-
lowed Chinese citizens to skirt censorship re-
strictions. 
Apple was widely condemned after this rev-
elation—yet five years later Apple has only 
increased its censorship efforts in China and 
has continued to proactively work to restrict 
freedom of expression for its Chinese cus-
tomers. 
Apple has even hosted apps on its App 
Store run by a China Paramilitary Group 
(the Xinjiang Production and Construction 
Corps) accused of participating in forced 
labor of Uyghurs and under U.S. Magnitsky 
sanctions. 
Apple’s so-called Transparency Reports do 
not reveal which apps have been censored, 
and remain questionably vague on the rea-
sons, legal or not, behind this censorship. 
The resulting opacity has become Apple’s 
true trademark: from how it curates content 
on the App Store; to how it implements its 
arbitrary ‘‘App Store Guidelines’’; to what 
data it communicates to governments; to the 
deals the company makes with even the 
most repressive regimes in the world. Apple 
conceals almost everything about its oper-
ations. 
Apple’s record-high financial results are 
the result of a strategy that has relied sig-
nificantly on Apple’s alliance with the Chi-
nese authoritarian government. This alli-
ance comes with a cost. In order to do busi-
ness in China, Apple has abandoned its val-
ues, ethical standards, and principles. Apple 
has actively worked to suppress the rights 
and freedoms of their customers, even when 
the company was not pressured to do so by 
Beijing. We believe that the time is overdue 
for Apple to put a halt to such unethical and 
immoral behavior. 
We remain at your disposal should you 
have any additional questions.

Mrs. BLACKBURN. It makes no sense 
to make a name for yourself creating 
secure devices for Western users but to 
then turn around and go out of your 
way to make the devices in the hands 
of the world’s most vulnerable people 
less secure. 
The time has come for us as a coun-
try to decide what matters more: pre-
serving this toxic entanglement with 
China or preserving life and liberty and 
the democratic ideals that make us so 
fortunate to begin with. 
I ask my colleagues to consider join-
ing me and Senator BLUMENTHAL in 
support of the Open App Markets Act 
to protect competition, to protect con-
sumers, and to protect those basic 
human rights that the world’s most 
powerful corporations have decided 
should take a backseat to access and 
profit. 
I yield the floor.

60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE EMBARGO AGAINST 
CUBA 
Mr. 
LEAHY. 
Madam 
President, 
today, February 7th, 2022, marks the 
60th anniversary of the day the U.S. 
economic embargo against Cuba first 
went into effect. Just think of that—60 
years. It is three generations, 12 Presi-
dents, 60 sessions of Congress, six 
transformational decades ago, and dat-
ing all the way back to the middle of 
the Cold War. 
The goal of the embargo, which has 
been expanded multiple times, was un-
mistakable. It was to depose the Cuban 
Government by imposing a vast web of 
punitive sanctions designed to crush 
the Cuban economy and incite a pop-
ular uprising. In fact, to be precise, in 
a declassified April 1960 State Depart-
ment memo confidently entitled ‘‘The 
Decline and Fall of Castro,’’ they said 
the purpose was ‘‘denying money and 
supplies to Cuba, to decrease monetary 
and real wages, to bring about hunger, 
desperation, and the overthrow of [the] 
government.’’ What a remarkable, hu-
manitarian attitude on the part of peo-
ple who had absolutely no idea of what 
history is or what might happen. 
Sixty years later, hunger and des-
peration are pervasive in Cuba, but the 
Cuban Government remains under the 
firm grip of the Communist Party. No 
opposition party has been allowed to 
function or to challenge it. Free and 
fair elections are as elusive as they 
were 60 years ago. Political dissent is 
not tolerated. 
But the U.S. embargo, which we 
proudly and consistently have kept, is 
opposed by every other nation in this 
hemisphere. In fact, it is opposed by 
every other nation in the world except 
Israel. In other words, after 60 years, 
we have convinced only one other gov-
ernment—just one—to join us and not a 
single government in our own hemi-
sphere. This failed attempt to isolate 
Cuba succeeded only in isolating our-
selves. 
Those responsible for this adminis-
tration’s policy toward Cuba have ap-
parently decided that, despite Can-
didate Biden’s pledge to the contrary; 
despite the failure of the embargo to 
achieve any of its objectives, which the 
CIA acknowledged in a declassified re-
port back in 1982; despite a worsening 
human rights situation; and despite 
contributing to the misery of the 
Cuban people, whom the White House 
insists it wants to help, there is no rea-
son to change course. 
Today, hard hit by COVID and the 
administration’s cutoff of remittances 
and restrictions on travel by Ameri-
cans to Cuba, life for most Cubans is an 
increasingly desperate struggle. Pop-
ular protests against the government’s 
mishandling of the pandemic, mis-
handling of the economy, and auto-
cratic rule have been met with a fierce 
crackdown, 
summary 
trials, 
and 
lengthy prison sentences, including for 
young people. 
I have spoken many times about the 
stark disconnect between the adminis-
tration’s policy toward Cuba and the 
reality in Cuba, so I am not going to 
repeat what I said before. I am as out-
raged by the crackdown on protesters 
in Cuba as anyone. Unlike many oth-
ers, I have actually said that to Cuban 
authorities. No one condones acts of 
vandalism 
or 
violence, 
but 
provo-
cations and abuse of peaceful pro-
testers are inexcusable. 
I also know that trying to bludgeon 
the Cuban authorities into submission 
does not work. What is the proof of 
that? We tried it for 60 years, and it 
hasn’t worked. It has only made things 
worse. It emboldens the hardliners in 
the government who can then blame 
the United States for their own failed 
policies. 
They are determined to hold on to 
power, and if they fail at something, 
they just blame it on the United 
States. 
But it hurts the Cuban people, imped-
ing their ability to obtain medical sup-
plies as basic as syringes and masks to 
fight COVID and preventing small busi-
nesses from accessing U.S. products. 
I visited a lot of those small busi-
nesses. They actually want to deal 
with America, and we are cutting them 
off. It flies in the face of our belief in 
the power of diplomacy through en-
gagement with countries whose govern-
ments we disagree with, especially a 
country 90 miles away whose people we 
share so much in common with. 
Sooner or later—and I hope it is 
sooner—the administration needs to 
face the fact that continuing Donald 
Trump’s policy of punitive sanctions 
and vitriol has backfired. The longer 
they delay that day of reckoning, the 
worse it will be. And we can do better 
than this. We can defend human rights, 
as we should. We can stand up for the 
right of people to choose their leaders 
in free and fair elections, as we should. 
We could also do what we do with vir-
tually every other government in the 
world with which we disagree: find 
areas of common purpose for the ben-
efit of the people in both countries. 
So on this 60th anniversary of a Cold 
War policy of sanctions and isolation 
that has failed in every conceivable 
way, let’s dedicate ourselves to a new 
way forward that our allies and part-
ners in this hemisphere will support, 
that the American people support, that 
supports the Cuban people, and most 
importantly, that we can show the rest 
of the world it is worthy of the United 
States, worthy of us. What we are

TRIBUTE TO SECRETARY OF THE 
SENATE SONCERIA ANN BERRY 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, serving 
in the U.S. Senate for as long as I have, 
I have seen dedicated, talented staffers 
come and go from my team. Some 
come to my office fresh out of college, 
spend some time, and move on to other 
opportunities or to further their edu-
cation. Some have come to stay for 
years. And others join my team, al-
ready seasoned veterans of the Sen-
ate—and leave for higher office. 
So is the story of my dear friend, 
Sonceria Ann Berry, the 34th Secretary 
of the Senate, and my former deputy 
chief of staff. It was with great pride 
when, on March 1, 2021, I administered 
the oath to Ann as she became our own 
Madam Secretary. And it should come 
as no surprise that Ann brought to the 
esteemed position decades of experi-
ence in the Senate. A seasoned profes-
sional who has seen changes in leader-
ship through the Congresses, Ann has 
counseled and mentored, quite lit-
erally, hundreds of staffers young and 
old. Her appointment as the Secretary 
of Senate was a source of great pride 
for me, and I am sure the other Mem-
bers for whom she worked, including 
Senator CARPER and former Senator 
John Edwards, as well as the late Sen-
ators Daniel Patrick Moynihan and 
Howell Heflin, share that pride. 
Secretary Berry is a 1978 graduate of 
the University of North Alabama, 
where she earned her bachelor degree 
in education. She recently returned to 
the University of North Alabama to de-
liver the fall commencement address. I 
found her words inspiring to the new 
graduates she addressed and instruc-
tional for those embarking in post-
graduate life. 
I would like to ask unanimous con-
sent that Secretary Berry’s commence-
ment 
remarks 
be 
printed 
in 
the 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
COMMENCEMENT ADDRESS—SONCERIA ANN 
BERRY, SECRETARY OF THE SENATE 
FALL 2021 COMMENCEMENT, UNIVERSITY OF 
NORTH ALABAMA 
Thank you for that wonderful introduc-
tion, and let me begin by congratulating the 
Class of 2021 for sticking with it, overcoming 
unprecedented challenges, and graduating 
with a well-earned degree in resilience, in 
addition to what you majored in. 
College graduation is always a remarkable 
achievement, but nobody has ever been 
through what you’ve been through to get 
here, and you can wear this experience and 
this hard-won success like a badge of honor 
for the rest of your life. 
Congratulations also to your families and 
friends who have helped you get to this day. 
They are heroes, just like you, and they 
have made their own sacrifices to support 
your ambitions. And I think they deserve 
their own round of applause. 
I graduated from the University of North 
Alabama, with a degree in secondary edu-
cation, in 1978. 
As it happened, I didn’t spend a minute of 
my career in secondary education. 
Life had other things in store for me, and 
because of those completely unexpected 
things, earlier this year, this fine university 
honored me with its Lifetime Achievement 
Award. 
They said it was because I was the first Af-
rican American ever to serve as Secretary of 
the Senate—the chief administrative, legis-
lative and financial officer of the world’s 
greatest deliberative body. 
Or they may have just been looking for 
someone who graduated a really long time 
ago. 
Either way, it was very special to me, be-
cause it was this university that set me on a 
path of life I would never have dreamed of 
before coming here. 
Before UNA, my ambition was to get a 
good office job. 
I was a pretty good typist and I was hoping 
for a career in an office as a secretary. 
I was poor. I wanted to work and make 
money and have some security for myself 
and my family. 
But after high school, I found work at the 
Home Insurance Company in Homewood, 
Alabama. 
They call it a ‘‘gap year’’ now when you 
take a year between high school and college 
to figure yourself out. 
But, for me, it wasn’t anything so fancy. It 
was a year of making a living. 
But it was also when I first learned about 
the University of North Alabama. 
And the more I learned about it, the better 
I knew that it was the place for me. 
UNA was not only the State’s oldest public 
university, with a heritage of training some 
of Alabama’s finest teachers. 
In an era when it was still quite unusual 
for women to go to college, UNA had already 
opened its doors to women for a hundred 
years. 
And this year, UNA proudly celebrates its 
150th anniversary of co-education with the 
Year of the UNA Woman. 
I was also impressed by the academic rigor 
built into the tradition of UNA. 
In its days as Florence Wesleyan Univer-
sity, prospective students had to dem-
onstrate an ability to translate four books of 
Caesar’s Gallic Wars from the original Latin, 
and six books of Virgil from the original 
Greek, into English. 
I think all of us feel fortunate that those 
particular skills are no longer required for 
admission to the University of North Ala-
bama. 
I know I did, and yet I quickly discovered 
that this university’s academic standards re-
mained commendably high, and so were its 
standards of conduct and ethics. 
It was also a community, where people 
cared about each other, helped each other, 
encouraged each other, nurtured each other. 
The course of my life was changed in just 
this way. 
After graduation, when I couldn’t find 
work as a teacher, I took a job as a secretary 
in the engineering department of South Cen-
tral Bell. 
But a year later, in 1979, I was contacted 
by the office of Alabama’s newly-elected 
United States Senator Howell Heflin about a 
position in the Senator’s Washington office. 
I didn’t know Senator Heflin, or how his 
office had found me. 
But I learned later that Dr. Robert Guillot, 
the president of UNA for whom I had served 
as a student aide in the Admissions Office, 
had recommended me to the Senator. 
And I was off to Washington, DC—a city I 
had never seen—for what Dr. Guillot cor-
rectly called ‘‘the opportunity of a lifetime.’’ 
That was forty-two years ago, and in the 
decades since, I have been proud to work not 
only for Senator Heflin but later for five 
other United States Senators in positions of 
increasing responsibility. 
I was thinking seriously of retiring earlier 
this year when I was offered the position of 
Secretary of the Senate—a position for 
which I was nominated by the Majority 
Leader, Chuck Schumer of New York, and to 
which I was elected by the full membership 
of the United States Senate. 
Today I manage the Senate as an institu-
tion, supervising 26 departments, nearly 240 
employees and a $25 million budget. 
My team and I are responsible for every-
thing from recording each day’s Senate de-
bates to running the Senate gift shop. 
The Parliamentarian of the Senate, the 
Senate 
Historian, 
the 
office 
of 
inter-
parliamentary services, and the people who 
pay 100 Senators and thousands of staff peo-
ple report to me. 
And I am proud to be the first African 
American, 
and 
the 
eighth 
woman,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S540 
February 7, 2022 
in the 232-year history of the Senate to hold 
this office. 
But what I found most compelling about 
being called to this assignment was another 
historic opportunity that had nothing to do 
with being Black or being a woman or being 
a pioneer of any kind. 
It was the opportunity to support, lead and 
nurture a remarkable group of people who 
protected our democracy during the January 
6 attack on the United States Capitol. 
When the rioters tried to disrupt the ratifi-
cation of Electoral College ballots, the peo-
ple I work with secured those ballots until 
the crisis had passed. 
When the rioters roamed through the Cap-
itol building threatening harm to anyone 
they encountered, the people I work with 
barricaded themselves in their offices and 
kept working. 
When the rioters put democracy itself in 
danger on that infamous day, the people I 
work with waited them out and certified the 
same peaceful transfer of power that has 
been the hallmark of our government for 
more than two hundred years. 
The people I work with are the ultimate 
public servants. 
They are the unsung heroes of our Repub-
lic, drawn not to fame and glory but to the 
quiet, professional, essential mission of sup-
porting our institutions of government—on 
good days and really bad days alike. 
And being their leader—not the fancy title, 
or the big office in the Capitol building, or 
the pioneering path I took—is the greatest 
honor of my life. 
I would never have dreamed, when I was a 
student here, that my life’s journey would 
lead me to this calling. 
The fact that it came after four decades on 
Capitol Hill, when retirement was beckoning 
me, only makes it more remarkable, more 
deeply personal and satisfying. 
As you sit here, contemplating your own 
futures, I would simply encourage you to 
focus not so much on a specific destination 
as on the journey itself. 
I didn’t become an educator, though that 
was the dream of my youth. 
I did things I never dared to dream. I saved 
the best for last. 
And I have learned that the journey—with 
all its twists and turns, peaks and valleys, 
sunshine and shadow—is what life is really 
about. 
The journey is the choices you make, large 
and small. So make good ones. 
It’s the people you encounter, famous and 
familiar, heroes and villains alike. So be 
kind to people, and be the kind of person you 
want others to be. 
It’s the preparations you make, not least 
those you have made these past four years 
right here at the University of North Ala-
bama. 
It’s the risks you take, like leaving the se-
curity of my family for an adventure in the 
nation’s capital. 
And it’s the understanding you gain, slow-
ly over the years, of what’s important and 
what’s not, what’s lasting and what’s fleet-
ing, who you are and what you’re supposed 
to do in your time on earth. 
Philosophers tell us that ‘‘life must be 
lived forwards, but can only be understood 
backwards.’’ 
That’s exactly the way I look at my life 
now and understand my purpose, improbable 
as it was when I sat where you sit so many 
years ago. 
As you begin your own adventure in the 
wide world, I urge you to heed these simple, 
but profound, words of Ernest Hemingway: 
‘‘It is good to have an end to journey to-
ward; but it is the journey that matters, in 
the end.’’ 
Congratulations, good luck, and enjoy your 
journey.

ance in the region. The principal contractor 
will be Lockheed Martin, Greenville, South 
Carolina. There are no known offset agree-
ments proposed in connection with this po-
tential sale. 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
require the assignment of fewer than twenty 
(20) U.S. contractor representatives to Jor-
dan for a duration of thirty-six (36) months 
to support secure storage requirements of 
critically controlled assets and provide on- 
site contractor logistics support. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale. 
TRANSMITTAL NO. 22–06 
Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of 
Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the 
Arms Export Control Act 
Annex Item No. vii 
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The F–16 Block 70 weapon system is a 
fourth generation single-engine supersonic 
all-weather multirole fighter aircraft and 
features advanced avionics and systems. It 
contains the General Electric F110–129D en-
gine, AN/APG–83 radar, digital flight control 
system, embedded internal global navigation 
system, Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing Sys-
tems (JHMCS) II or Scorpion Hybrid Optical- 
based Inertial Tracker (HObIT) with Night 
Vision Device (NVD) capability, internal and 
external Electronic Warfare (EW) equipment, 
Advanced IFF, Link–16 datalink, operational 
flight trainer, and software computer pro-
grams. 
2. The General Electric F110–129 engine is 
an afterburning turbofan jet engine that 
powers the F–16. 
3. The Improved Programmable Display 
Generator (iPDG) and color multifunction 
displays utilize ruggedized commercial liquid 
crystal display technology that is designed 
to withstand the harsh environment found in 
modem fighter cockpits. The display gener-
ator is the fifth generation graphics proc-
essor for the F–16. Through the use of state- 
of-the-art microprocessors and graphics en-
gines, it provided orders of magnitude in-
creases in throughput, memory, and graphics 
capabilities. 
4. The Scalable Agile Beam Radar (SABR) 
APG–83 is an Active Electronically Scanned 
Array (AESA) radar upgrade for the F–16. It 
includes higher processor power, higher 
transmission power, more sensitive receiver 
electronics, and Synthetic Aperture Radar 
(SAR), 
which 
creates 
higher-resolution 
ground maps from a greater distance than 
existing mechanically scanned array radars 
(e.g., APG–68). The upgrade features an in-
crease in detection range of air targets, in-
creases in processing speed and memory, as 
well as significant improvements in all 
modes. 
5. The Modular Mission Computer (MMC) 
7000AH is the central aircraft computer of 
the F–16. It serves as the hub for all aircraft 
subsystems and avionics data transfer. 
6. The Embedded GPS-INS (EGI) with Se-
lective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module 
(SAASM) is a selfcontained navigation sys-
tem that provides the following: accelera-
tion, velocity, position, attitude, platform 
azimuth, magnetic and true heading, alti-
tude, body angular rates, time tags, and co-
ordinated universal time (UTC) synchronized 
time. SAASM enables the GPS receiver ac-
cess to the encrypted P(Y) signal providing 
protection against active spoofing attacks. 
7. The AN/ALQ–254 Viper Shield or equiva-
lent Integrated Electronic Warfare (EW) 
Suite provides passive radar warning, wide 
spectrum Radio Frequency (RF) jamming, 
and control and management of the entire 
EW system. This system is anticipated to be 
internal to the aircraft although mounted 
pod 
variants 
are 
used 
in 
certain 
cir-
cumstances. 
8. The AN/AAQ–33 Sniper Advanced Tar-
geting Pods (ATP) is a single, lightweight 
targeting pod for military aircraft that pro-
vides positive target identification, autono-
mous tracking, Global Positioning System 
(GPS) coordinate generation, and precise 
weapons guidance from extended standoff 
ranges. It incorporates a high definition mid- 
wave forward-looking infrared (FLIR), dual- 
mode laser, visible-light high definition tele-
vision (HDTV), laser spot tracker, video data 
link (VDL), and a digital data recorder. 
9. The Link–16 is an advanced command, 
control, communications, and intelligence 
(C3I) system incorporating high capacity, 
jam-resistant, digital communication links 
for exchange of near real-time tactical infor-
mation, including both data and voice, 
among air, ground, and sea elements. It pro-
vides the warfighter key theater functions 
such as surveillance, identification, air con-
trol, weapons engagement coordination, and 
direction for all services and allied forces. 
With modernized cryptography, Link–16 will

February 7, 2022 
11. The AN/APX–126 or equivalent Ad-
vanced Identification Friend or Foe (AIFF) 
Combined Interrogator Transponder (CIT) is 
a system capable of transmitting and inter-
rogating Mode 5. Mode 4 and Mode 5 anti-jam 
performance 
specifications/data, 
software 
source code, algorithms, and tempest plans 
or reports will not be offered, released dis-
cussed, or demonstrated. 
12. The Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing Sys-
tem II (JHMCS II) or Scorpion Hybrid Opti-
cal-based Inertial Tracker (HObIT) is a de-
vice used in aircraft to project information 
to the pilot’s eyes and aids in tasks such as 
cueing weapons and aircraft sensors to air 
and ground targets. This system projects vis-
ual targeting and aircraft performance infor-
mation on the back of the helmet’s visor, en-
abling the pilot to monitor this information 
without interrupting his/her field ofview 
through the cockpit canopy. This provides 
improvement for close combat targeting and 
engagement. 
13. The AN/ALE–47 Countermeasure Dis-
penser Set (CMOS) provides an integrated 
threat adaptive, computer controlled capa-
bility for dispensing chaff, flares, and active 
radio frequency expendables. The system is 
internally mounted and may be operated as 
a stand-alone system or may be integrated 
with other on-board Electronic Warfare (EW) 
and avionics systems. The AN/ALE–47 uses 
threat data received over the aircraft inter-
faces to assess the threat situation and de-
termine a response. Expendable routines tai-
lored to the immediate aircraft and threat 
environment may be dispensed using one of 
our operational modes. 
14. The KY–58M is a lightweight terminal 
for secure voice and data communications. 
The KY–58M provides wideband/narrowband 
half duplex communication. 
15. The KIV–78 is a crypto applique for IFF. 
It can be loaded with Mode 5 classified ele-
ments. 
16. The Simple Key Loader (SKL) is a 
ruggedized, portable, hand-held device, for 
securely receiving, storing, and transferring 
data between compatible cryptographic and 
communications equipment. 
17. Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS) 
is a multi-platform PC-based mission plan-
ning system. 
18. The LAU–129 Guided Missile Launcher 
is capable of launching a single AIM–9 (Side-
winder) family of missiles or AIM–120 Ad-
vanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile 
(AMRAAM). The LAU–129 launcher provides 
mechanical and electrical interface between 
missile and aircraft. 
19. The M61Al Vulcan Cannon is a six-bar-
reled 
automatic 
cannon 
chambered 
in 
20×l20mm with a cyclic rate offire from 2,500– 
6,000 shots per minute. This weapon is a hy-
draulically powered air cooled Gatling gun 
used to damage/destroy aerial targets, sup-
press/incapacitate 
personnel 
targets 
and 
damage or destroy moving and stationary 
light material targets. 
20. The Joint Programmable Fuze FMU–152 
or FMU–139 fuzes are multi-delay sensors 
compatible with weapon guidance kits, tail 
kits, high-explosive bombs, and reduced col-
lateral damage weapons which provide all 
arming and detonation event functions com-
bined in a single fuze system. 
21. The Joint Direct Attack Munitions 
(JDAM) is a guidance set that converts exist-
ing unguided bomb into an accurate, adverse 
weather ‘‘smart’’ munition. The Guidance 
Set consists of a Tail Kit, which contains the 
Inertial Navigation System (INS) and a 
Global Positioning System (OPS), a set of 
Aerosurfaces and an umbilical cover, which 
allows the JDAM to improve the accuracy of 
unguided, 
General 
Purpose 
bombs. 
The 
JDAM weapon can be delivered from modest 
standoff ranges at high or low altitudes 
against a variety of land and surface targets 
during the day or night. JDAM is capable of 
receiving target coordinates via preplanned 
mission data from the delivery aircraft, by 
onboard aircraft sensors (i.e., FLIR, Radar, 
etc.) during captive carry, or from a third- 
party source via manual or automated air-
crew cockpit entry. The Guidance Set, when 
combined with a warhead and appropriate 
fuze, forms a JDAM Guided Bomb Unit 
(GBU). 
The KMU–556 is the tail kit for a GBU–31, 
2,000 pound JDAM. 
22. Laser JDAM (Joint Direct Attack Mu-
nitions) (GBU–54) converts existing unguided 
free-fall bombs into precision guided smart 
munitions by adding a new tail section con-
taining Inertial Navigation System (INS) 
guidance/Global Positioning System (GPS) 
guidance and adds a semi-active laser seeker. 
This allows the weapon to strike targets 
moving at up to 70 mph. The LJDAM weapon 
consists of a DSU–38 sensor, a JDAM guid-
ance set installed on bomb body and a fuze. 
The DSU–38 consists of a laser spot tracker 
(same size and shape as a DSU–33 proximity 
fuze), a cable connecting the DSU–38 to the 
basic JDAM guidance set, a cable cover, 
cable cover tie down straps, modified tail kit 
door and wiring harness, and associated 
modified JDAM software that incorporates 
navigation and guidance flight software to 
support both LJDAM and standard JDAM 
missions. 
The KMU–572 is the tail kit for a GBU–54, 500 
pound Laser JDAM. 
23. The Paveway II (PWII) is a maneuver-
able, free-fall Laser Guided Bomb (LGB) that 
guides to a spot of laser energy reflected off 
the target. The LGB is delivered like a nor-
mal general purpose (GP) warhead and the 
semi-active guidance corrects for many of 
the normal errors inherent in any delivery 
system. Laser designation for the LGB can 
be provided by a variety of laser target 
markers or designators. An LGB consists of 
a MAU–209 or MAU–169 Computer Control 
Group (CCG), that is not warhead specific, 
and a warhead specific Air Foil Group (AFG) 
that attaches to the nose and tail of the GP 
bomb body. 
The GBU–10 is a 2,000 lb GP bomb body fitted 
with the MXU–651 AFG to guide to its 
laser designated target. The inert GBU– 
12 uses a BDU–50 inert bomb body and 
MAU–169 CCG trainer for training pur-
poses. 
24. The Enhanced Paveway II (EP II) Laser 
Guided Bomb (LGB) is a maneuverable, all- 
weather, free-fall weapon that guides to a 
spot of laser energy reflected off the target. 
The ‘‘enhanced’’ component is the addition 
of GPS-aided Inertial Navigation Systems 
(GAINS) guidance to the laser seeker. Laser 
designation for the LGB can be provided by 
a variety of laser target markers or designa-
tors. The EP II consists of an MAU–210 En-
hanced Computer Control Group (ECCG) that 
is not warhead specific and a warhead-spe-
cific Air Foil Group (AFG) that attaches to 
the nose and tail of a GP bomb body. 
The EGBU–49 is a 500 pound GP bomb body 
fitted with the MXU–650 AFG to guide to 
its laser-designated target. 
25. The Mk–84 General Purpose (GP) bomb 
body is a 2,000 pound, free-fall, unguided, 
lowdrag weapon. 
26. The Mk–82 GP bomb body is a 500 
pound, free-fall, unguided, low-drag weapon. 
27. Mk–82 inert GP bomb body is a 500 
pound, free-fall, unguided, low-drag weapon 
without the explosive fill. 
28. The highest level of classification of de-
fense articles, components, and services in-
cluded in this potential sale is SECRET. 
29. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the specific 
hardware and software elements, the infor-
mation could be used to develop counter-
measures that might reduce weapon system 
effectiveness or be used in the development 
of a system with similar or advanced capa-
bilities. 
30. A determination has been made that 
Jordan can provide substantially the same 
degree of protection for the sensitive tech-
nology being released as the U.S. Govern-
ment. This sale is necessary in furtherance 
of the U.S. foreign policy and national secu-
rity objectives outlined in the Policy Jus-
tification. 
31. All defense articles and services listed 
in this transmittal have been authorized for 
release and export to the Government of Jor-
dan.

nals (MIDS–LVT) 
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has re-
quested to buy thirty-one (31) Multifunc-
tional Information Distribution System-Low 
Volume Terminals (MIDS–LVT) Block Up-
grade 2 (BU2), that will be added to a pre-
viously implemented case. The original FMS 
case, valued at $3.0 million, included eleven 
(11) Multifunctional Information Distribu-
tion System-Low Volume Terminals (MIDS– 
LVT) Block Upgrade 1 (BUI). Therefore, this 
notification is for a total or eleven (11) 
Multifunctional 
Information 
Distribution 
System-Low Volume Terminals (MIDS–LVT) 
Block Upgrade 1 (BUI) and thirty-one (31)

ance; training; and other related elements of 
logistics and program support. The total es-
timated cost is $23.7 million. 
This proposed sale will support U.S. for-
eign policy and national security objectives 
by helping to improve the security of a 
friendly country that continues to be an im-
portant force for political stability and eco-
nomic growth in the Middle East. 
The proposed sale will provide the Saudi 
armed forces with the equipment, training, 
and follow-on support necessary to protect 
Saudi Arabia, and the region, from the desta-
bilizing effects of terrorism, countering Ira-
nian influence, and other threats. The pro-
posed MIDS–LVT (BU2) terminals will be in-
stalled on Terminal High Altitude Air De-
fense (THAAD) platforms, while the pre-
viously provided MIDS–LVT (BUI) terminals 
were installed on PATRIOT. Saudi Arabia 
will have no difficulty absorbing this equip-
ment into its armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The principal contractor is undetermined 
as there will a competitive contractual 
award process after LOA implementation. 
There are no known offset agreements pro-
posed in connection with this potential sale. 
Implementation of this sale will not re-
quire the assignment of any U.S. Govern-
ment or contractor representatives to Saudi 
Arabia. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION 
United Arab Emirates—Foreign Military 
Sales Order (FMSO) II Case 
The Government of the United Arab Emir-
ates (UAE) has requested to buy a Foreign 
Military Sales Order (FMSO) II to provide 
funds for blanket order requisitions under a 
Cooperative Logistics Supply Support Agree-
ment (CLSSA) for common spares/repair 
parts to support the United Arab Emirates’ 
Homing All the Way Killer (HAWK), Phased 
Array Tracking Radar to Intercept on Tar-
get (PATRIOT), and Terminal High Altitude 
Area Defense (THAAD) weapon systems, ad-
ditional support; and other related elements 
of logistics and program support. An earlier 
FMS case, valued at $30 million, provided 
this requirement. The amended FMS case 
would extend the funding to cover an addi-
tional three years. The estimated total case 
value is $65 million. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy and national security of the United 
States by helping to improve the security of 
an important regional partner. The UAE is a 
vital U.S. partner for political stability and 
economic progress in the Middle East. 
The UAE intends to utilize this follow-on 
support to maintain its air defense weapon 
systems in accordance with U.S. mainte-
nance requirements and standards. This sale 
supports the UAE’s existing ability to deter 
and defend against hostile threats by main-
taining the operational readiness of critical 
air defense systems. The proposed sale will 
contribute to the UAE’s ability to effectively 
integrate with U.S.-led coalitions and oper-
ate independently in support of U.S. inter-
ests and the security of U.S. forces in the-
ater, and is consistent with U.S. bilateral 
and 
multilateral 
defense 
plans 
in 
the 
CENTCOM region. The UAE will have no dif-
ficulty absorbing this equipment and serv-
ices into its armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
There are no principal contractors in-
volved with this potential sale. There are no 
known offset agreements associated with 
this sale. 
Implementation of this sale will not re-
quire the assignment of any additional U.S.

port, and other related elements of program 
support. Participation in the shared IESP 
and FSP for the life of the Patriot system is 
a requirement of the U.S. Government. The 
total estimated program cost is $100.0 mil-
lion. 
This proposed sale is consistent with U.S. 
law and policy as expressed in Public Law 96– 
8. 
This proposed sale serves U.S. national, 
economic, and security interests by sup-
porting the recipient’s continuing efforts to 
modernize its armed forces and to maintain 
a credible defensive capability. The proposed 
sale will help improve the security of the re-
cipient and assist in maintaining political 
stability, military balance, economic and 
progress in the region. 
The proposed sale will help to sustain the 
recipient’s missile density and ensure readi-
ness for air operations. The recipient will use 
this capability as a deterrent to regional 
threats and to strengthen homeland defense. 
The recipient will have no difficulty absorb-
ing this equipment and services into its 
armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The prime contractors will be Raytheon 
Technologies in Andover, MA; and Lockheed 
Martin in Camden, AK. There are no known 
offset agreements proposed in connection 
with this potential sale. 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
not require the permanent assignment of any 
additional U.S. Government or contractor 
representatives to recipient. Support teams 
will travel to recipient on a temporary basis. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

REMEMBERING MICHAEL L. DUFFY 
Mr. 
GRASSLEY. 
Mr. 
President, 
today I pay tribute to a very dear 
friend who was welcomed home to the 
Lord last month in Davenport, IA, sur-
rounded by his loving family. 
Mike Duffy was a pillar in his com-
munity, church, and profession. A born 
leader, Mike never met a stranger. He 
leaves the world a better place, and he 
will be greatly missed by his family 
and friends, including this U.S. Sen-
ator. He graced his community and 
congregation with a larger than life 
presence. Mike wasn’t born with a sil-
ver spoon in his mouth; he was born 
with a heart of gold. 
Mike grew up across the street from 
Sacred Heart Cathedral in Davenport. 
A soldier of Christ, he lived the sacra-
ments and his Catholic faith in word 
and 
deed, 
practicing 
the 
Corporal 
Works of Mercy with humility and pur-
pose. He was steeped in Catholic edu-
cation, graduating from Sacred Heart 
Grade 
School, 
Assumption 
High 
School, and St. Ambrose University. 
When Mike was around age 11, I am 
guessing he went to confession to ask 
forgiveness for a little white lie. That 
is around the time Mike fibbed about 
his age to land a job as a paperboy for 
the Quad-City Times. From there, 
Mike’s tireless work ethic grew from 
one year to the next. He soon joined 
the family business and never looked 
back. 
His 
parents, 
John 
and 
Eleanor, 
moved to the Quad Cities to pursue the 
American Dream. Here, they started a 
security business from scratch. These 
risk-taking entrepreneurs were among 
my earliest supporters in Scott Coun-
ty. Thanks to their support, they 
helped me gain a foothold among local 
Republicans. Ever since, I have worked 
hard to earn and grow grassroots sup-
port for my Senate campaigns in Scott 
County. I am grateful that support 
continued through the branches of the 
family tree with their son Mike. 
As I mentioned, Mike was a go-getter 
from the get-go. He worked his way up 
the ladder from the bottom rung, 
cleaning dog kennels. In high school 
and through college, he continued 
climbing the work ladder at the family 
business. He studied hard in school and 
learned as much from the School of 
Hard Knocks. He enjoyed people from 
all walks of life and treated everyone 
he encountered with respect and dig-
nity. 
Mike was frugal with his hard-earned 
money and generous with those who 
needed it most. He was devout in his 
Catholic faith and devoted to his bride 
Linda, with whom he enjoyed 48-1⁄2 
years of marital bliss. Their marriage 
was 
blessed 
with 
seven 
children: 
Brendon, Bridget, Brianna, Bradley, 
Brian, Bethany, and son Ben, who 
passed away a year to the day prior to 
his father’s death. 
Through the decades, Mike and Linda 
grew the family business together. 
Mike wore many hats at the business, 
from dispatch supervisor, to alarm 
manager, vice president of operations, 
executive vice president, chief oper-
ating officer, president, and CEO. They 
grew the business into the largest fam-
ily-owned, full-service security pro-
vider in the Midwest. 
His professional life also included 
work as a licensed private detective, 
holding U.S. Government Secret clear-
ance. And still, Mike had more to give 
beyond the workplace. An indefatigable 
civic leader, Mike served on a slew of 
boards 
and 
committees, 
including 
alumni president of St. Ambrose Uni-
versity, the Davenport Chamber of 
Commerce, the Handicapped Develop-
ment Center, and more. 
His civic engagement made room for 
politics, as well. Throughout his life, 
he 
supported 
conservative 
causes, 
championing pro-life and Catholic edu-
cation. 
Our paths crossed countless times 
through the years. Barbara and I very 
much enjoyed our decades-long friend-
ship. Mike and Linda’s hospitality was 
second to none. Some years ago, the 
Duffys opened up their home to me for 
an overnight visit. As it happens, I 
spend a lot of nights on the road over 
the years for my 99 county meetings. It 
is a treat to skip the hotel and be in-
vited to stay in someone’s home. It was 
an even bigger treat to spend time dis-
cussing current events and politics 
with Mike Duffy. On this particular 
visit, there was a bit of excitement 
underfoot at the bustling Duffy house-
hold. The family was making room for 
another addition, a duckling hatched 
the night of my sleepover. So, natu-
rally, Mike and the kids named the 
duck ‘‘Chuck.’’ 
Suffice it to say, I am going to miss 
his sense of humor. 
Barbara and I send our heartfelt con-
dolences to the entire Duffy family, in-
cluding 31 grandchildren. May his leg-
acy of service and citizenship continue 
to live on his community and through 
the growing branches of the Duffy fam-
ily tree. And may my brother in Christ 
rest in eternal Happiness, joyfully in 
the arms of our Lord in everlasting 
life. 
REMEMBERING DEWEY DEWITT 
Ms. 
COLLINS. 
Mr. 
President, 
through a legendary broadcasting ca-
reer spanning more than seven decades, 
Maine’s Dewey DeWitt was the ‘‘Voice 
of Aroostook County.’’ Dewey passed 
away on January 5 at 99 years of age, 
but his voice and his contributions will 
never be forgotten. 
As a native of the county, a longtime 
fan, and a friend, I offer my deepest 
condolences to his family. In this time 
of sorrow, I am sure they will find com-
fort in knowing how much Dewey 
meant to so many. 
Dewey first went on the air in 1950, 
the year a radio station began oper-
ations in Houlton, the Shiretown of 
Aroostook County. When a television 
station 
began 
broadcasting 
from 
Presque Isle a few years later, Dewey 
was the first person seen by viewers. 
Like many others in Northern Maine, 
I grew up listening to Dewey. From 
interviews with public officials to the 
daily news to high school basketball, 
he kept us informed. 
Indeed, the hallmark of Dewey’s ca-
reer was his devotion to local sports, 
especially high school basketball. It is 
estimated that Dewey called the play- 
by-play of more than 3,000 games over 
the years. 
Every sportscaster has that one in-
delible memory that stands alone. For 
Dewey and me, it was a memory we 
shared with people throughout the re-
gion. In 1969, when I was a student at 
Caribou High School, our boys’ basket-
ball team won its first-ever State 
championship on a last-second shot by 
Mike Thurston from beyond midcourt. 
I was at that exciting game, but it was 
Dewey’s voice that brought that thrill-
ing moment to listeners across Maine. 
More than a half-century later, Dewey 
could still recall that game and that 
shot in vivid detail. 
Although Dewey retired from daily 
broadcasting some years ago, he re-
mained active with a frequent show on 
WHOU radio called, ‘‘Talk of the 
Town.’’ Whenever I visited Houlton, I 
loved stopping to see Dewey for a chat. 
Dewey’s interviews were a shining 
example of how it should be done. He 
was always informed and insightful, 
with a keen understanding of how na-
tional issues affected the people in his 
audience. In our most recent interview, 
in October of 2021, he asked probing 
questions about border security, the 
appropriations process, our national 
debt, and pandemic recovery, among 
other important topics. 
Dewey DeWitt’s work was recognized 
by the Maine Sports Hall of Fame, the 
Maine Basketball Hall of Fame’s Leg-
ends of the Game, and the Maine Asso-
ciation of Broadcasters Hall of Fame. 
But I know that the tribute that meant 
the most to him was the affection peo-
ple throughout Aroostook County will 
always have for him. I join them in 
celebrating his remarkable life and in 
recognizing 
him 
for 
a 
voice 
that 
brought us together as a community.

PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE 
REPORT OF THE CONTINUATION 
OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY 
THAT 
WAS 
ORIGINALLY 
DE-
CLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 
14014 OF FEBRUARY 10, 2021, WITH 
RESPECT TO BURMA—PM 20 
The PRESIDING OFFICER laid be-
fore the Senate the following message 
from the President of the United 
States, together with an accompanying 
report; which was referred to the Com-
mittee 
on 
Banking, 
Housing, 
and 
Urban Affairs: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides 
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90 
days prior to the anniversary date of 
it’s declaration, the President pub-
lishes in the Federal Register and trans-
mits to the Congress a notice stating 
that the emergency is to continue in 
effect beyond the anniversary date. In 
accordance with this provision, I have 
sent to the Federal Register for publica-
tion the enclosed notice stating that 
the national emergency with respect to 
the situation in and in relation to 
Burma declared in Executive Order 
14014 of February 10, 2021, is to con-
tinue in effect beyond February 10, 
2022. 
The situation in and in relation to 
Burma, and in particular the February 
1, 2021 coup, in which the military 
overthrew the democratically elected 
civilian government of Burma and un-
justly arrested and detained govern-
ment leaders, politicians, human rights 
defenders, journalists, and religious 
leaders, thereby rejecting the will of 
the people of Burma as expressed in 
elections held in November 2020 and un-
dermining the country’s democratic 
transition and rule of law, continues to 
pose an unusual and extraordinary 
threat to the national security and for-
eign policy of the United States. There-
fore, I have determined that it is nec-
essary to continue the national emer-
gency declared in Executive Order 14014 
with respect to Burma.

ROBERT SHAFER 
HON. BETH VAN DUYNE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 7, 2022 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, on be-
half of a grateful nation and the citizens of the 
Twenty-Fourth District of Texas, the 2021 
Congressional 
Veteran 
Commendation 
is 
hereby presented to Robert Shafer, Second 
Lieutenant, United States Army, of Dallas, 
Texas, for his honorable service in the Armed 
Forces of the United States of America and for 
his continued dedication to his community. 
Mr. Shafer enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1943 
and served until 1950 as an engineering and 
construction officer. Shafer was deployed to 
New Guinea, the Ryuku Islands, and Okinawa 
during World War II, helping build infrastruc-
ture and airfields in support of the war effort. 
Shafer and his men were routinely subject to 
Japanese bombing runs and sniper fire. He 
later served during the Korean War as an op-
erations officer and platoon training officer. His 
decorations include the World War II Victory 
Medal, the Good Conduct Medal, the Asiatic- 
Pacific Campaign Medal and the American 
Theater Medal. 
After leaving the Army, Mr. Shafer has 
brought the same love he had for his country 
and poured it into making his community a 
better place. Shafer worked as a Boy Scouts 
of America leader, a leader within his church, 
and has helped organize and assist with his 
church’s food pantry. 
Mr. Shafer’s career is marked with heroism 
and is consistent with the finest traditions of 
the United States Army and reflects great 
credit upon himself, the State of Texas, and 
the United States of America.

IN RECOGNITION OF DR. EPHRAIM 
WILLIAMS’S RETIREMENT 
HON. DORIS O. MATSUI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 7, 2022 
Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate Dr. Ephraim Williams on his 
retirement as the Senior Pastor of St. Paul 
Baptist Church. Dr. Williams has served as 
Senior Pastor for 49 years and his congrega-
tion is eternally grateful. 
Dr. Ephraim Williams was born in Summit, 
Mississippi. He pursued his education in Mis-
sissippi, Illinois, and California. He was called 
to ministry in 1964 and was ordained in 1966 
by his Pastor and mentor, Pastor Joseph Wil-
liams. After, he enrolled in seminary and 
trained at several pristine institutions. He re-
ceived his Doctor of Divinity from Conroe Nor-
mal and Industrial College in 1979 and an 
honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from Cali-
fornia State University, Sacramento in 2017. 
Dr. Williams leads one of the largest con-
gregations in Sacramento and has been in-
strumental in the church’s growth in members, 
in programs and in facilities. His leadership 
and impact are not limited to the church, but 
also are to be found in the greater community. 
He has provided pivotal leadership in revital-
izing Oak Park, establishing supportive pro-
grams, and feeding hundreds of people each 
year. Additionally, Dr. Williams has served on 
the boards of numerous programs dedicated 
to the wellbeing of Sacramento residents and 
has been a leader with various religious orga-
nizations. 
All of Dr. Williams efforts have not gone un-
noticed. He has received numerous awards 
and accolades from national and local leaders. 
He has been invited to the White House by 
two former presidents, President William Clin-
ton and President Barack Obama. 
Dr. Williams’ wife of 55 years, Carrie Sue 
Martin-Williams, passed on May 6, 2009. They 
are the parents of two children, Gwen and 
Ephraim ‘‘Butch,’’ Jr.; four grandchildren, 
Nikiya, Tairena, Tenaya (deceased) and Mar-
shall; and ten great-grandchildren. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing the legacy of we Dr. Wil-
liams for his service on behalf of his con-
gregation and the Sacramento region.

ORIGINAL TUSKEGEE AIRMAN, AIR 
FORCE 
BRIGADIER 
GENERAL 
CHARLES E. MCGEE 
HON. ANTHONY G. BROWN 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 7, 2022 
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor and pay final tribute to re-
tired Air Force Brigadier General Charles E. 
McGee, who died peacefully in his sleep Janu-
ary 16, 2022 at his Bethesda, Maryland home 
at the age of 102 years old. 
McGee was born in Cleveland, Ohio on De-
cember 7, 1919. He was among eight remain-
ing Tuskegee Airmen combat pilots out of the 
355 that were assigned to the 332nd Fighter 
Group during WWII in Europe. In addition, he 
flew combat missions in Korea and Vietnam 
accumulating a total of 6,308 flying hours and 
409 fighter combat missions during his 30– 
year active-duty military career. 
He enlisted in the U.S. Army October 26, 
1942, while studying engineering at the Uni-
versity of Illinois, and earned his pilot’s wings 
June 30, 1943. By February 1944, he was sta-
tioned in Italy with the 302nd Fighter Squad-
ron of the 332nd Fighter Group, flying his first 
mission on February 14. He flew the Bell P– 
39Q Airacobra, Republic P–47D Thunderbolt 
and the North American P–51 Mustang fighter 
aircraft, escorting Consolidated B–24 Liberator 
and Boeing B–17 Flying Fortress bombers 
over Germany. Austria, and the Balkans. 
During missions, he also engaged in low 
level attacks over enemy airfields and rail 
yards. On August 24, 1944, McGee, while es-
corting B–17s over Czechoslovakia, engaged 
a formation of Luftwaffe fighters and shot 
down a Focke Wulf 190. McGee flew a total 
of 137 combat missions. He was promoted to 
Captain and returned to the United States on 
December 1, 1944. He became an instructor 
pilot on the North American B–25 Mitchell 
bombers at Tuskegee Army Air Field that an-
other unit of the Tuskegee Airmen was ready-
ing to deploy to the Pacific Theater. He re-
mained there until 1946, when the base was 
closed. 
After World War II, McGee was sent to 
Lockbourne Air Field, Columbus, Ohio, to be-
come the base operation and training officer. 
Later in 1948, he was posted to an Aircraft 
Maintenance Technical Course and was as-
signed to an air refueling unit. When the Ko-
rean War broke out, he flew North American 
P–51 Mustangs, later redesignated by the Air 
Force as F–51s, again in the 67th Fighter 
Bomber Squadron, completing 100 missions, 
and being promoted to Major. McGee contin-
ued to serve with the United States Air Force 
as it was reconstituted as a fighter pilot, flying 
the Lockheed F–80 Shooting Star and the 
Northrop F–89 Scorpion aircraft. 
During the Vietnam War, as a Lieutenant 
Colonel, McGee flew 172 combat missions in 
a McDonnell RF–4 photo reconnaissance air-
craft. His plane was hit by enemy fire twice— 
during the Korean conflict and again years 
later near Laos, both times on his right wing. 
After a series of other assignments, both in 
the United States as well as in Italy and Ger-
many, and promotion to colonel, McGee re-
tired on January 31, 1973. He ended his mili-
tary career with 6,308 flying hours. 
McGee was recognized for his combat and 
military service with a number of awards in-
cluding: Distinguished Flying Cross with two 
Oak Leaf Clusters, Legion of Merit with one 
Oak Leaf Cluster, Bronze Star, Air Medal with 
25 Oak Leaf Clusters, Army Commendation 
Medal, Presidential Unit Citation, Korean Pres-
idential Unit Citation, Hellenic Republic World 
War II Commemorative Medal, along with re-
lated campaign and service ribbons. 
After his military service, McGee held many 
prestigious functional and honorary positions 
in the field of aviation. In 1978, at the age of 
58, he completed the college degree at Co-
lumbia College in Kansas City, over thirty 
years after his initial enrollment at the Univer-
sity of lllinois. Though interrupted by World 
War II, attaining a college degree had been a 
lifelong goal. McGee served as the Director of 
the Kansas City airport and as a member of 
the Aviation Advisory Commission. 
For over 30 years, he was an ambassador 
of the Tuskegee Airmen Incorporated (TAI), a 
nonprofit, giving numerous public addresses. 
He received numerous accolades, including 
the National Aeronautical Association’s ‘‘Elder 
Statesman of Aviation.’’ McGee served two 
terms as National President of Tuskegee Air-
men, Incorporated. 
In 2011, he was inducted into the National 
Aviation Hall of Fame in Dayton, Ohio. The 
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 
Year 2020 approved the honorary promotion

of documented original Tuskegee Airman, 
United States Air Force Colonel (Retired) 
Charles E. McGee, to Brigadier General. 
McGee was a torchbearer, consistently em-
phasizing the significance and lasting legacy 
of the Tuskegee Airmen on the U.S. military 
and American society. It was the Tuskegee 
Airmen he said that ‘‘right the wrong those 
that believed Blacks were not able to master 
sophisticated equipment, that Blacks lacked 
courage, and that Blacks did not have the 
wherewithal to fight a determined enemy. It 
was the Tuskegee Airmen that ended up with 
a stellar WWII aviation war record and thereby 
edged the military toward integration and 
America away from segregation.’’ 
Brigadier General McGee and his late wife, 
the former Frances E. Nelson of Champaign, 
Illinois, raised three children, became grand-
parents of ten and great grandparents of many 
more. He will be greatly missed; however, his 
legacy will live on as a source of inspiration 
for generations to come. I wish retired Air 
Force Brigadier General Charles E. McGee 
‘high flight.’

HONORING KYLA CLAUSSEN AS 
IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 7, 2022 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
ask the House of Representatives to join me 
in recognizing Kyla Claussen, disability rights 
advocate and caregiver, as Iowan of the 
Week. 
Kyla is a tireless advocate and clear voice 
not just for herself, but for the thousands of 
Iowans who find themselves waiting for assist-
ance through a Medicaid HCBS waiver. Al-
though Kyla lives with an unknown progres-
sive neuromuscular disease that has impacted 
her lung capacity, mobility, and speech, that 
has not sapped an ounce of her compassion 
and dedication. 
Kyla is one of over 17,000 Iowans waiting 
for a waiver to receive home and community- 
based care through Medicaid. She brings a 
unique perspective to an all-too-common prob-
lem for Iowans living with a disability. Before 
requiring assistance herself, Kyla had in fact 
been a caregiver for over a decade. While 
Kyla is no longer able to work as a caregiver, 
I know this hasn’t taken away her compassion 
and drive to make sure everyone—no matter 
who—can live in their home, their community, 
and achieve their fullest. Her unending com-
mitment to others and service to her commu-
nity, whether as a caregiver or fighter for dis-
ability rights, embody the values that make me 
proud to be an Iowan. 
You can find evidence of Kyla’s commitment 
wherever you look. If you ask her friends and 
fellow advocates at Iowa Upgrade Medicaid, 
she’s been called ‘‘the researcher’’ for her 
ability to dig into and digest disability laws in 
Iowa and around the Midwest. And just this 
past fall, Kyla was able to use her story to call 
attention to the need for better home and 
community-based services as part of a round-
table discussion with the White House. I am 
incredibly proud to see Iowa so well-rep-
resented in Kyla, and I am glad that more 
folks had a chance to hear her story. 
But Kyla’s story doesn’t stop there. Kyla 
lives in Avoca, Iowa with the kittens she’s fos-
tering—she has four right now, but it’s been 
more in the past—and her service dog in train-
ing, Ed. Whenever Ed notices that Kyla’s 
breathing has flagged, he’s trained to start 
barking. Then, according to Kyla, her mission 
becomes getting him to stop. That’s a good 
boy. 
I know that our laws have failed in pro-
tecting and providing for our disability commu-
nity. I have heard so many personal stories of 
how our existing programs are woefully inad-
equate, unable to address the most basic 
needs for those who are not able-bodied. 
Gaps in our local, state, and federal system 
have mired the disability community with red 
tape and bureaucracy to receive the most 
basic level of assistance. The issues facing 
our friends, family, and neighbors with a dis-
ability are profound, and the current systems 
are antiquated. I am proud to have supported 
legislation to address these problems, how-
ever much of this legislation remains stalled. I 
will not stop supporting and advocating to en-
sure we treat those with a disability with re-
spect, humanity, and kindness. 
I am humbled by Kyla’s ability to use her di-
agnosis as a springboard for change and her 
genuine concern for her friends, community, 
and fellow Iowans always shines through. I am 
grateful to be able to share her story here in 
Washington, and I am privileged to be able to 
celebrate her as Iowan of the Week.

HONORING ALABAMA’S LAW 
ENFORCEMENT 
HON. MIKE ROGERS 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 7, 2022 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in strong support of our local law 
enforcement. 
Across our country, police officers are under 
fire. They are being killed, attacked and tar-
geted. 
These brave men and women who serve 
their local communities help keep us safe, but 
the liberals continue to push to defund the po-
lice. 
I am sick of it. 
President Biden and the left’s anti-police 
policies have led to a crimewave across our 
nation. Last October; three Alabama police of-
ficers were shot in less than 24 hours. Last 
May, Alabama officers were injured in a shoot-
ing. And last week, an Opelika Police officer 
was hit by a fleeing suspect. 
We are a country of law and order and I im-
plore my colleagues to stand up for those who 
protect us and back the blue.

THOMAS TERRELL 
HON. BETH VAN DUYNE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 7, 2022 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, on be-
half of a grateful nation and the citizens of the 
Texas-Twenty-Fourth Congressional District, 
the 2021 Congressional Veteran Commenda-
tion is hereby presented to Thomas Terrell, 
Captain, United States Marine Corps, of 
Southlake, Texas for his honorable service in 
the Armed Forces of the United States of 
America and for his continued dedication to 
his community. 
Mr. Terrell was commissioned as an officer 
in the U.S. Marine Corps in 1961 and served 
until 1967. Terrell served several tours in Viet-
nam, to include at Chu Lai, Dong Ha, Phu Bai, 
and Quang. At Dong Ha Combat Base in 
1967, Terrell and his fellow Marines came 
under an intense enemy artillery attack, during 
which Terrell moved three wounded Marines 
to safety and maneuvered under enemy fire to 
assess and check upon the welfare of his Ma-
rines during the attack. Terrell was awarded 
the Bronze Star with ‘‘V’’ device denoting val-
orous actions as well as the Purple Heart. 
After leaving the Marine Corps, Mr. Terrell 
has brought the same love he had for his 
country and poured it into making his commu-
nity a better place. Mr. Terrell holds several 
ministerial roles in local churches, taught for 
several years at the Happy Hill Christian 
Academy, and is a member of the Texas Real 
Estate Commission’s Broker-Lawyer Com-
mittee. 
Mr. Terrell’s career is marked with heroism 
and is consistent with the finest traditions of 
the United States Marine Corps and reflects 
great credit upon himself, the State of Texas, 
and the United States of America.

1991 she embraced the opportunity to become 
their Executive Director. 
Barrio Action was established to empower

Mr. LOWENTHAL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to reflect on and honor the life of Mel 
Mermelstein, a survivor of Auschwitz and Bu-
chenwald, later a U.S. immigrant who served 
our country in the Korean War, a pioneering 
voice in the legal fight against Holocaust 
denialism, and a proud champion and teacher 
of Holocaust education and remembrance. 
Mermelstein died January 28, 2022, at his 
home in Long Beach, California. He was 95. 
Mermelstein 
was 
born 
in 
Mukachevo, 
Czechoslovakia on September 25, 1926. His 
hometown was later occupied by the Hungar-
ians and is currently part of the Ukraine. 
Mermelstein was 17 years old in 1944 when 
the Nazis rounded him up along with other 
Jews who had been stripped of their homes, 
denied education and were relegated to ghet-
tos. They were transported by cattle car to the 
infamous Nazi camp, Auschwitz, in German- 
occupied Poland. 
Mermelstein later recounted in numerous 
interviews, that upon arrival, his mother who 
was helping a woman with three or four small 
children, was immediately ushered to the gas 
chamber line. His two sisters who had been 
selected for slave labor, ran to be at their 
mother’s side. They all perished that day in 
the Nazi death factory. Thereafter, his father 
and brother were also senselessly murdered 
by the Nazis, leaving Mel the sole survivor of 
his immediate family. 
During 
his 
internment 
at 
Auschwitz, 
Mermelstein was forced by the Nazis to work 
as slave labor. In January 1945, as Soviet 
Troops advanced, the Nazis began mass exe-
cutions and evacuations of prisoners from 
Auschwitz. Mermelstein was forced to march 
on foot for three weeks in the bitter snow in 
what has come to be known as the death 
marches. After surviving the 155-mile forced 
march to Gross-Rosen concentration camp, he 
was packed onto a train and sent to Buchen-
wald, another Nazi concentration camp. 
On April 11, 1945, U.S. forces liberated 
Mermelstein and the other surviving Jews from 
Buchenwald. Upon liberation, Mermelstein was 
18 years old and weighed 68 pounds. He re-
mained in the camp while the Red Cross of-
fered medical care and aid. After approxi-
mately 
three 
months, 
he 
returned 
to 
Mukachevo. With his entire family murdered 
and his family home occupied, Mermelstein 
made a decision to begin a new life in the 
country that had liberated him from hell. 
Mermelstein knew he had an uncle and aunt 
in New York. Although he did not speak 
English at the time, Mermelstein immigrated to 
the U.S. through Ellis Island in 1946, where he 
eventually became a naturalized citizen. In 
1950, Mermelstein was drafted into the U.S. 
Army. Although he was given the ability to 
forgo service, he proudly served in the Amer-
ican armed forces. After his initial training, and 
because of his extensive linguistic abilities in-
cluding seven languages, he was selected to 
work Army intelligence during the Korean War. 
He later worked as a translator at the United 
Nations. 
After his service to this country, Mermelstein 
began to pen his experiences in the Nazi 
camps in his memoir, ‘‘By Bread Alone.’’ In 
1960, Mermelstein met his wife, Emma Jane 
Nance, then a schoolteacher in New York. 
The couple moved to Los Angeles in 1961 to 
start their family. Mermelstein set-up and ran 
a successful manufacturing company that 
made wooden pallets. He went on to employ 
generations of workers, including his yard 
manager that Mermelstein employed for 55 
years. 
While 
running 
a 
successful 
business, 
Mermelstein, deeply scarred and traumatized 
by his experiences in the Nazi death camps, 
began traveling back to Auschwitz and other 
surrounding concentration camps. In 1967, 
with the advent of the Six-Day War, the con-
flict between Israel and seven Arab states, 
Mermelstein was compelled to make sure evi-
dence of what happened to his family and to 
the millions of other Jews at the hands of the 
Nazis was not buried or destroyed. 
Hearing the rising number of threats being 
made against Jews and committed to the 
promise he made to his father, Mermelstein 
life’s work became to ensure that the world 
would never forget. He spoke to classrooms 
and school assemblies educating students and 
teachers of the atrocities he experienced as a 
teen, warning against man’s inhumanity to 
man. He accompanied students to Auschwitz 
and spread a message of hope, peace, resil-
ience and reconciliation. His focus was on in-
tellectual curiosity and what can be learned 
from such a dark period in history. He lives on 
as an inspiration to many. 
In the late 70’s Mermelstein actively de-
bated Holocaust deniers on the radio and tele-
vision. In 1980, a Holocaust denier organiza-
tion claimed the planned extermination of 
Jews by the Nazis was a myth and offered a 
reward publicizing it in Jewish newspapers. 
Mermelstein was incensed and wrote a letter 
to the editors of various newspapers who pub-
lished the advertisement expressing his dis-
gust. 
The 
Holocaust 
denier 
organization 
turned its focus to Mermelstein and challenged 
Mermelstein to prove that Jews were gassed 
in gas chambers at Auschwitz. The Institute 
for Historical Review, a known hate group ‘‘of-
fered a $50,000 award to prove Jews were 
gassed at Auschwitz,’’ recounted William Cox, 
a Long Beach attorney. Cox was so moved 
after reading Mermelstein’s memoir, ‘‘By 
Bread 
Alone,’’ 
he 
offered 
to 
represent 
Mermelstein to take on the so-called revision-
ists pro bono. 
In 1981, in the Mermelstein v. IHR case, 
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Thomas T. 
Johnson took judicial notice of the fact that 
Jews were gassed in gas chambers at Ausch-
witz. The ruling was a ‘‘personal vindication’’ 
for Mermelstein, his attorney Cox recounted. 
In 1985, the IHR and Mermelstein reached a 
settlement agreement, and Mermelstein re-
ceived a damage award and a letter of apol-
ogy from the organization. This became the 
subject of the movie ‘‘Never Forget,’’ starring 
Leonard Nimoy. 
Over five decades, Mermelstein returned to 
Auschwitz and surrounding death camps ob-
taining artifacts and other items. Mermelstein 
processed his trauma and pain creating pieces 
for display in an exhibit which was formerly 
housed on his business property. Tens of 
thousands of students toured his exhibit for 
free 
over 
the 
decades. 
Currently, 
Mermelstein’s extensive collection of artifacts 
is being curated for permanent display. Among 
the physical reminders of the Holocaust he 
collected are uniforms worn by inmates, 
pieces of barbed-wire fence and even parts of 
a Jewish prayer book found buried near an in-
cinerator. 
In a collaboration between the Auschwitz 
Study Foundation (a non-profit founded by 
Mermelstein in 1978) and the Chabad Jewish 
Center in Newport Beach—the Orange County 
Holocaust 
Education 
Center 
will 
house 
Mermelstein’s collection for access by stu-
dents, teachers and the public. A documentary 
based on his life, ‘‘Live to Tell’’ is slated for re-
lease later this year. 
Mermelstein is survived by his wife, Jane 
Mermelstein; his children, Bernie, Edie, Ken 
and David; five grandchildren and one great- 
grandchild.

HONORING THE LIFE OF DIXIE 
CLEM 
HON. VAN TAYLOR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 7, 2022 
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, today, I rise 
to honor and celebrate the life of Dixie Carolyn 
Clem. 
The youngest of four children, Dixie was 
born on October 30, 1930, in Booneville, Ar-
kansas. In 1948, she would many Emmitt 
Mason Clem, and they would remain firmly 
united in marriage for 53 years until his pass-
ing in 2001. 
In 1955, Dixie relocated to Plano, Texas 
after her husband was appointed the Band Di-
rector for Plano High School. Upon settling in 
the area, Dixie began a lifelong involvement in 
her beloved Plano community including her 
membership at First United Methodist Church 
in Plano, the Plano Chapter Order of Easter 
Star, Mother Advisor of Plano Rainbow Cham-
ber, Plano Good Sam Travel Club, Past Presi-
dent of Plano Business and Professional 
Women, and as the first woman to serve on 
the Plano Planning and Zoning Commission. 
Dixie also maintained employment with the 
Plano Star Courier. 
Always invested in her community, Mrs. 
Clem maintained a deep commitment to the 
Girl Scouts and could oftentimes be seen sup-
porting her husband from the stands at band 
marching contests and football games. Dixie 
and Emmitt maintained a passion for travel 
and were known to spend summers journeying

in their RV to Colorado. A beloved fixture in 
her family, Dixie was particularly known for 
creating treasured memories with her grand-
children and great grandchildren. 
Dixie is often considered a pioneer in help-
ing to establish the Collin County Republican 
Party. For 55 years she focused her efforts on 
mentoring others to work towards bettering 
their communities and to become politically 
active at all levels of government. Greatly ad-
mired by those around her and as a testament 
to her efforts to train up the next generation of 
leaders, she received several notable recogni-
tions including the Texas Federation of Re-
publican Women’s ‘‘Ten Outstanding Women 
Award’’ and ‘‘The Legacy Leadership Award.’’ 
While we mourn the loss of this respected 
matriarch of Collin County conservatism, we 
celebrate her many contributions to shaping 
the political landscape. Likewise, we rest in 
the knowledge her legacy will continue on as 
the award that bears her name—the highest 
honor bestowed upon a member of the Collin 
County GOP—will continue to be presented to 
those who embody next generation ideals of 
servant leadership. 
While many in Collin County will miss her 
gumption and steadfast presence, together we 
recognize a life well lived. Now as we honor 
the life of Mrs. Dixie Clem, I ask my col-
leagues in the House of Representatives to 
join me in celebrating her rich legacy.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 1300 
CAMPAIGN 
HON. DORIS O. MATSUI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 7, 2022 
Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, it is with de-
light that I rise to honor the 1300 Campaign 
for their outstanding efforts to close the col-
lege achievement gap in the Sacramento re-
gion. The 1300 Campaign, a community-led 
and systems change initiative, is dedicated to 
permanently transforming the historical sys-
tematic barriers that have limited opportunities 
for young men of color. 
In 2013, Improve Your Tomorrow was 
founded with the mission to increase the num-
ber of young men of color to attend and grad-
uate from colleges with the vision of a world 
where men of color are overrepresented in 
higher education and underrepresented in the 
criminal justice system. The 1300 Campaign is 
an initiative of the Sierra Health Foundation, 
My Brother’s Keeper Sacramento, and the 
Chan Zuckerberg Initiative with backbone sup-
port provided by Improve Your Tomorrow, a 
homegrown organization within my district. 
Working together with local leaders and orga-
nizations, the 1300 Campaign strives to in-
crease the number of young men of color from 
Sacramento who attend and graduate from the 
Los Rios Community College District, Cali-
fornia State University, Sacramento and the 
University of California, Davis. 
The 1300 Campaign partners with school 
districts to incorporate the A-G requirements 
as a default curriculum for all students. This 
will help ensure that all graduates, particularly 
young men of color, are eligible for post-sec-
ondary options. A-G eligibility for all students 
addresses a systematic barrier to college that 
contributes to the divergence in educational 
outcomes, particularly for young men of color. 
Additionally, the 1300 Campaign works with 
school districts to incorporate ethnic studies as 
a graduation requirement, to establish a place- 
based mentorship model, hire additional coun-
selors that represent the diversity of the stu-
dent population, develop an organizational ra-
cial equity assessment tool, design and imple-
ment an ongoing countywide professional de-
velopment training centered around culturally 
responsive pedagogy, to incorporate required 
implicit bias training for K–12 educators, and 
districts to implement a moratorium on school 
suspensions related to willful defiance for all 
schools in Sacramento County for no less 
than one year. 
Madam Speaker, today we honor the 1300 
Campaign for their outstanding efforts to close 
the college achievement gap and I thank their 
partners for their dedication and successful ef-
forts.

RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE AND 
ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF VICE AD-
MIRAL ROBERT D. SHARP 
HON. JASON CROW 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 7, 2022 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the service and accomplishments or 
Vice Admiral Robert D. Sharp and congratu-
late him on his upcoming retirement. 
A Veteran of the war in Afghanistan and the 
Gulf War, Vice Admiral Sharp bravely served 
our country during a highly decorated 34-year 
career with the United States Navy—receiving 
two bronze stars, the Legion of Merit award, 
two Defense Superior Service medals, and the 
Navy Distinguished Service Medal. Addition-
ally, Vice Admiral Sharp’s incredible leader-
ship earned him the Vice Admiral Rufus L. 
Taylor award for excellence in instruction, the 
U.S. Army’s Knowlton Award for Military Intel-
ligence, the Rear Admiral Edwin T. Layton 
leadership award, and the Naval Intelligence 
Foundation award for excellence in operational 
intelligence support to the Fleet. 
Beyond his many personal, unit, and cam-
paign awards, Vice Admiral Sharp’s service in-
cluded operational deployments with USS 
Ranger (CV61). Carrier Air Wing 2 embarked 
on USS Constellation (CV 64) and Carrier 
Group 2 embarked on USS Harry S. Truman 
(CVN 75). Additionally, in April 2016, Vice Ad-
miral Sharp was tasked with serving as Com-
mander, Office of Naval Intelligence and Di-
rector, National Maritime Intelligence-Integra-
tion Office. 
In February 2019, Vice Admiral Sharp 
began serving as the seventh director of the 
National GeospatialIntelligence Agency (NGA). 
Under his leadership, the department worked 
diligently to collect, analyze, and distribute 
geospatial intelligence that decision makers, 
military service members, and first responders 
needed to stay safe and get the job done. 
I think Vice Admiral Sharp would agree 
that—even beyond his own incredible service 
and personal achievements—he is most proud 
of the relationships he built and the future 
leaders he guided and shaped during his dec-
ades of service. In my role on the House Per-
manent Select Committee on Intelligence and 
the House Armed Services Committee, I was 
lucky enough to work closely with Vice Admi-
ral Sharp, where it was clear he not only 
worked incredibly hard and with the utmost 
honor but left a lasting impression on every 
person he met. 
Vice Admiral Sharp’s many years serving 
our country in combat zones, keeping Amer-
ican servicemembers safe, and responding to 
national security threats before they strike 
epitomizes what it means to go above and be-
yond the call of duty. I congratulate Vice Ad-
miral Sharp on his retirement and thank him 
for his service to our country.

HON. BETH VAN DUYNE 
OF TEXAS

Monday, February 7, 2022 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, on be-
half of a grateful nation and the citizens of the 
Texas Twenty-Fourth Congressional District, 
the 2021 Congressional Veteran Commenda-
tion is hereby presented to Stephen LeClaire, 
Airman 1st Class, United States Air Force of 
Bedford, Texas for his honorable service in 
the Armed Forces of the United States of 
America and for his continued dedication to

boards, commissions, and committees. Among 
these are as a member of the commission for 
Boy Scouts of America Troop 499, a volunteer 
for Boy Scouts of America Troop 387 for 7 
years, a soccer coach for the YMCA, an orga-
nizer for the Ronald McDonald House charity, 
and a member of the HEB Community Emer-
gency Response Team. 
Mr. LeClaire’s career is marked with her-
oism and is consistent with the finest traditions 
of the United States Air Force and reflects 
great credit upon himself, the State of Texas, 
and the United States of America.

HONORING ROBBIE HUNTER 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 7, 2022 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the contributions of Robbie Hunter 
upon his retirement as President of the Cali-
fornia Building and Construction Trades Coun-
cil. 
Robbie grew up in Sailertown, Belfast, the 
son, nephew, grandson and great-grandson of 
the mariners, steeplejacks and dock workers 
that built Belfast’s historic shipyards and ships, 
including the Titanic. Although Robbie has 
lived in America for decades, he has never 
lost either his Belfast brogue or his love for 
the families and Irish culture that made him 
who he is today and empowered him to lift up 
workers throughout California and across the 
country.

Robbie initially came to the United States in 
the late 70s as an ironworker, where he con-
tributed to the construction of the American 
Skyline, from New York City to Las Vegas and 
Los Angeles. Continuing the family legacy of 
championing the rights of unions, Robbie be-
came the president of the largest Ironworker 
local in the United States and Canada, Local 
433. Robbie went on to become a renowned 
labor leader in California and United States, 
taking over the leadership of the Los Angeles/ 
Orange Counties Building and Construction 
Trades 
Council. 
As 
executive 
secretary, 
Robbie used his previous experience in the 
public sector to negotiate agreements and 
contracts with public and private companies, 
including the Los Angeles Unified School Dis-
trict, the Los Angeles Community College Dis-
trict, Los Angeles Airport, and Port of Los An-
geles. 
Shortly after, Robbie was elected as the 
President of the California State Building and 
Construction Trades Council (SBCTC), which 
oversees over 180 local unions representing 
over 68,000 apprentices and 450,000 skilled 
construction workers. As President, Robbie 
worked diligently to pass landmark legislation 
that promoted better working conditions, more 
comprehensive educational programs, and 
reasonable wages and benefits. 
I have had the personal pleasure of getting 
to know and working with Robbie over the 
years and extend my utmost appreciation for 
his work on behalf of the half a million hard-
working construction workers he represented 
as President of SBCTC of California. After 
dedicating his life to ensuring the safety and 
security of apprentices and skilled workers 
through union work, Robbie is opening the 
door for the continual betterment of union 
members across California and the United 
States. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in celebrating this accomplished, well-re-
spected man, Robbie Hunter, in honor of his 
retirement.
