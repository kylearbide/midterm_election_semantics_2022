WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 10, 2020

TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 10, 2020 
The Senate met at 12 noon and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY).

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, by Your grace, give au-
thority to the godly that this Nation 
can thrive. Continue to raise up people 
who have reverence for You and desire 
to do Your will. 
Lord, give our Senators the wisdom 
to live blameless lives that please You. 
May they find joy in Your presence as 
they trust the unfolding of Your loving 
providence. Lord, empower them to use 
their integrity to bring stability to our 
Nation and world. 
And Lord, thank You for the oppor-
tunity tomorrow to honor our veterans 
and celebrate their bravery and sac-
rifice. 
We pray in Your strong Name. Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
CRUZ). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute in morning business, please. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
VETERANS DAY 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Tomorrow is Vet-
erans Day. Since the end of World War 
I, Americans have taken this day to 
recognize the sacrifices made by our 
veterans, and they did that in service 
to our country. 
For the third consecutive year, my 
office recorded the oral histories of 
Iowa’s veterans for the Library of 
Congress’s Veterans History Project. I 
would urge some of my colleagues to 
take a look at that and see if they can 
help add a lot of their veterans from 
their respective States to the history 
project at the Library of Congress. 
We owe our veterans a debt of grati-
tude for their patriotism, and it is vi-
tally important to record the stories of 
veterans so that future generations 
will always remember their service and 
the sacrifice that it takes to preserve 
our freedom. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE MARK 
ESPER 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, yes-
terday, the President informed us that 
Secretary Mark Esper’s tenure leading 
the Department of Defense has con-
cluded. 
When the Senate considered Sec-
retary Esper’s nomination, I said you 
could hardly invent better qualifica-
tions to run the Pentagon than his re-
sume. From West Point and the 101st 
Airborne to his time as Secretary of 
the Army, this leader had stepped up 
when his country needed him. The Sec-
retary brought integrity, expertise, 
and steady leadership to the Penta-
gon’s top job. 
I am grateful for his work to keep 
our country safe, modernize our mili-
tary, and implement the Trump admin-
istration’s new national defense strat-
egy to address the challenges of our 
time. A decorated combat veteran him-
self, he won the respect of the men and 
women of our Armed Forces. 
The country is grateful for his career 
of service. 
During this time of transition, I am 
confident in the professionalism of the 
men and women of the Department of 
Defense, not to mention our uniformed 
services. We are lucky to have such ca-
pable and duty-focused men and women 
on the watch, defending the Constitu-
tion, deterring our adversaries, and 
protecting the peace. 
I expect to speak with Acting Sec-
retary Miller soon to discuss the seri-
ous threats facing our country, wheth-
er from foreign terrorists or great pow-
ers like China and Russia that may

tainty. All of this highlights the need 
for continued sober and steady leader-
ship at the Department. 
f 
BURMA 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, now 
on an entirely different matter, as we 
continue to complete the process of our 
own election here at home, there is 
also news on the continued growth of 
democracy half a world away. 
My colleagues know that I have had 
a special interest in the democratic as-
pirations of the people of Burma for 
decades, dating back to my days lead-
ing the Appropriations Subcommittee 
for State and Foreign Operations. 
Burma held elections on Sunday, 
which we hope will represent another 
step toward a more democratic and 
prosperous future. For too long, the 
people of Burma were denied democ-
racy by a brutal military junta. To this 
day, its influence remains a significant 
impediment to progress. And as with 
many new democracies, the elections 
faced many challenges, ranging from 
continued conflict to the coronavirus 
pandemic. 
But when the votes are counted and 
Burma’s next government is seated, 
more hard work will await. The gov-
ernment will need to continue advanc-
ing Burma’s democratic development. 
Its 
sovereignty 
must 
be 
defended 
against the corrupting foreign influ-
ence of the People’s Republic of China. 
The nation needs true national rec-
onciliation among Burma’s various 
ethnic groups and further economic re-
forms to benefit all of its people. 
Further progress will take real com-
promise and real sacrifice from parties 
and interests within Burma, and it will 
need continued support from the inter-
national community, particularly the 
United States. 
I have known Daw Suu for many 
years and know she remains committed 
to democracy. So I hope and expect 
that if she and her party are the vic-
tors, her government will seek much 
needed constitutional, economic, and 
security sector reforms to further limit 
the corrosive influence of the military 
and the crony networks over so much 
of the life in Burma. 
We are talking about a nation that 
still reserves 25 percent of the seats in 
the Parliament for the military itself. 
It would be an understatement to call 
that an obstacle toward an ongoing 
democratic transition. 
Further progress toward democracy 
and prosperity in Burma will require 
the inclusion of Burma’s ethnic minori-
ties and making compromises with 
them. It will require national rec-
onciliation to end the disparate civil 
conflicts that rage across that country. 
And it will require accountability for 
atrocities that have been committed by 
the military—and not just in Rakhine 
State. 
If Burma’s Government meaningfully 
pursues these kinds of efforts, I expect 
the United States and like-minded 
countries will continue to stand by 
them. The free nations of the world 
have much to gain from Burma’s de-
mocratization, and we have much to 
lose 
if 
it 
slides 
back 
into 
authoritarianism or further into the 
grasp and orbit of China. 
So, as Americans, our political con-
tests here at home can feel intense. We 
think our elections are charged and 
contentious. But when you look at de-
mocracies that are just getting off the 
ground around the world, you remem-
ber how blessed we are to live in a re-
public that has for centuries inspired 
the forces of democracy and freedom 
all around the world. 
We get to live in a country where our 
institutions of self-government have 
held up for more than 230 years, where 
the rule of law and our Constitution 
are paramount. 
May we never take it for granted, 
and may we continue to support those 
around the world who seek to emulate 
our example. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY

The 
PRESIDING

CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, on 
January 20, the Biden-Harris adminis-
tration will begin its work with a man-
date secured by the largest number of 
votes ever received by a Presidential 
ticket in American history. Its task, of 
course, will be daunting. The darkest 
days of the COVID–19 pandemic are, 
unfortunately, ahead of us. More than 
100,000 Americans are being diagnosed 
with COVID–19 a day, and more than 
1,000 Americans are dying. 
Soon, thankfully, we will have an ad-
ministration that actually acknowl-
edges this healthcare crisis—an admin-
istration that takes its job seriously 
and that will listen to the counsel of 
scientists and doctors and work to im-
prove the lives of all Americans, re-
gardless of whom they voted for. 
Already, the incoming administra-
tion is preparing to hit the ground run-
ning. Yesterday, the President-elect 
announced his COVID–19 task force, a 
group of the Nation’s top public health 
experts and scientists who will advise 
the incoming administration on policy. 
Today, Senate Democrats will re-
ceive a briefing from one of President- 
Elect 
Biden’s 
scientific 
advisers, 
former Surgeon General Dr. Vivek 
Murthy. I expect it will be the first of 
many conversations about how the 
Senate and the incoming administra-
tion can work together to get COVID– 
19 under control and on the retreat, be-
cause the truth is, the executive and 
legislative branches are going to have 
to work together in the coming months 
to crush this virus and put our econ-
omy back on the right track. 
Nearly 15 million Americans have 
now lost their jobs, and, by extension, 
many 
of 
them 
have 
lost 
their 
healthcare coverage. Medicaid enroll-
ment has spiked across much of the 
country, adding new stress to State 
programs already beleaguered by the 
demands of COVID–19. Democrats have 
a plan, through the Heroes Act, to 
strengthen and secure Medicaid for the 
duration of the crisis. 
Congress should pursue a strong, 
comprehensive COVID-relief bill that 
actually meets the needs of the Amer-
ican people. Yesterday, however, the 
Republican leader suggested the Re-
publican majority will continue to pur-
sue its policy of targeted relief—in 
other words, inadequate relief. He 
seemed to suggest that the develop-
ment of a possible vaccine was actually 
a reason to pare back on aid to the 
American people. 
Let’s be very clear. Getting this 
country vaccinated will be a massive 
undertaking, and while I share in the 
hope that yesterday’s news brings, we 
cannot pretend this pandemic is nearly 
over. Regardless of this news, it is like-
ly the coming winter months will be 
the worst yet. 
The Nation is suffering from the un-
controlled spread of the virus now. 
With hospitalizations and fatalities on 
the rise all across the country, hos-
pitals and healthcare providers are 
again 
overwhelmed. 
Temporary 
morgues are, once again, sadly, being 
pressed into service. 
We all look forward to the day when 
vaccination is widely available, but we 
do not have the luxury of waiting to 
grapple with the current effects of this 
crisis until then. We have to act now to 
prevent the immediate crisis that is 
coming this winter. 
So while the incoming administra-
tion prepares to take on a resurgent 
COVID–19, 
Congress 
must 
as 
well. 
Leader MCCONNELL and Senate Repub-
licans must come to the table in good 
faith and work with us on a bipartisan 
bill that meets the needs of all our 
country. The House, of course, is 
Democratic, and the Senate needs a bi-
partisan bill to pass something. We 
have to work in a bipartisan way, and 
we owe it to the American people.

PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, on an-
other matter, I don’t think many of us 
expected President Trump to leave the 
Office of the Presidency with grace—a 
quality he has not once demonstrated 
during his long career in business or 
his very short career in public life. But 
the extent to which the Republican

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6629 
November 10, 2020 
Party is legitimizing the President’s 
assault on our democracy is infuriating 
and deeply, deeply wrong. 
The President is not merely bringing 
forward well-founded legal challenges. 
He is not simply taking advantage of 
the ability to request a recount in 
States where one is possible. He is de-
claring himself to be the winner of an 
election that he lost. He is claiming to 
win States that he lost. His legal team 
is filing scores of frivolous, unsubstan-
tiated lawsuits. He is undermining 
faith in our elections and poisoning our 
democracy during one of the most deli-
cate moments in our constitutional 
system, something we treasure: the 
peaceful transfer of power. 
The President has fired the Secretary 
of Defense, threatening the continuity 
of our national security policy because 
he is having a temper tantrum. Not 
only does this put at risk a smooth 
transition in one of the most sensitive 
and critical areas of our government, it 
creates an opening for our adversaries 
to take advantage of instability and in-
experience. 
The current Attorney General of the 
United States has made a show of au-
thorizing Federal probes into supposed 
election fraud, lending a veneer of false 
credence to the President’s delusions. 
It violates the longstanding tradition 
of avoiding even the appearance of law 
enforcement interference in our elec-
tions. Almost immediately, Attorney 
General Barr’s decision prompted the 
Chief of the Justice Department’s elec-
tions branch to resign in protest. 
The Government Services Adminis-
trator, GSA, has still not signed the 
paperwork necessary for the Biden 
transition team to begin its work. And 
here in the Senate, the Republican 
leader and several Republican Members 
are trying to give their President air 
cover. 
Yesterday, in the same breath that 
Leader MCCONNELL celebrated the re-
election of certain Republican Sen-
ators, he declined to congratulate the 
winner of the Presidential election be-
cause the election results have not 
been officially certified. The political 
right seems eager to celebrate the re-
sults it approves of while delaying 
judgment and casting doubt on the re-
sults it doesn’t. Indeed, the Republican 
leader could not even mention two 
words, ‘‘Joe Biden,’’ who, regardless of 
what Republican Senators may think, 
will be the next President of the United 
States. 
Two Republican Members of this 
Chamber have called on their own sec-
retary of state—a fellow Republican— 
to resign for no other apparent reason 
than the fact that President Trump did 
not win their State. They allege the 
secretary of state did not deliver hon-
est and transparent elections. That is 
really a stunning charge in the United 
States of America. That is the kind of 
thing you hear about in banana repub-
lics and dishonest elections. Surely, 
U.S. Senators would have some evi-
dence that in the world’s premier—pre-
mier—democracy 
an 
entire 
State’s 
election was not conducted ‘‘honestly,’’ 
as they say. Surely, you must think 
that those Senators have incredible, 
substantial, and weighty proof of such 
a scandalous and alarming allegation, 
but you would wrong. Those two Sen-
ators provided no evidence—not even a 
shred—to back up their claims. 
Three lonely Republican Senators— 
three in total—have congratulated the 
next President and Vice President of 
the United States on their victory and 
called on the Nation to come together. 
The rest have been silent or outright 
sympathetic toward the President’s 
completely unsubstantiated claims of 
election fraud. 
So look, here is where we are. Every 
major media outlet, including FOX 
News, has projected that Joe Biden will 
be the next President of the United 
States, and KAMALA HARRIS will be the 
next Vice President of the United 
States—not because the media declared 
them to be but because more than 76 
million Americans voted them into of-
fice. There has been no evidence of 
widespread voter fraud or any indica-
tion that results might flip in not one 
but several States. 
The country is ready to move on 
from 4 years of tumultuous and incom-
petent administration. The institu-
tions of our government will ensure it 
on January 20, no matter what the cur-
rent President claims. But they cannot 
ensure faith in our democracy in the 
hearts and minds of the American peo-
ple. That is a project for both parties 
to confer legitimacy on an election in 
which, yes, half the country will be dis-
appointed but after which the entire 
country must pull together. 
Every day that goes by without the 
Republican Party acknowledging and 
accepting the results of the election is 
another day Americans’ faith in our de-
mocracy declines. 
f 
VETERANS DAY 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, fi-
nally, on Veterans Day, tomorrow, we 
will all proudly observe Veterans Day, 
a chance to honor our veterans—heroes 
who come from every walk of life, 
every color and creed, joined by a com-
mon love of country and an uncommon 
love for their fellow Americans. This 
week, we say again thank you, thank 
you, thank you to every veteran for 
their service. 
Like so many things this year, Vet-
erans Day will be different. We cannot 
come together as we would normally 
do. We hold in our thoughts and pray-
ers the veterans across the United 
States whose lives have been touched 
by this awful disease, and we give spe-
cial thanks to many veterans who 
work as teachers, healthcare workers, 
doctors, nurses, and community lead-
ers—the very heroes, in a different 
sense, who are keeping our commu-
nities going during these tough times. 
We in the Senate have a solemn respon-
sibility to make sure they continue to 
get the help they need. 
Finally, it is always a little different 
when we observe a Veterans Day in the 
aftermath of an election. We must 
never forget our freedoms—to speak 
freely, 
to 
assemble 
peaceably, 
to 
choose our leaders, and forge our des-
tiny—have been secured, time and time 
again, by the sacrifice of Americans 
who have worn the uniform.

CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, be-
fore I begin, I want to acknowledge the 
tremendous news released yesterday 
that early results of a COVID vaccine 
are showing a greater than 90 percent 
rate of effectiveness. This is great news 
and a testament to the innovative 
power of the private sector and the ef-
forts of Congress and the Trump ad-
ministration to expedite the develop-
ment of COVID vaccines. 
The trial for this vaccine will con-
tinue, and FDA approval will be re-
quired, but these early results are very, 
very encouraging. It has been a tough 
year for Americans and people all over 
the world, but hopefully this is a sign 
that the light at the end of the tunnel 
is coming. 
f 
2020 ELECTIONS 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, we 
are now a week on from the election, 
but there are still a lot of outstanding 
races to determine. Votes are still 
being counted or will soon be recounted 
in many States. The Presidential race 
has yet to be certified, and it is impor-
tant to remember that while media 
outlets can predict a winner, official 
results do come later, and there are 
still House and Senate races that have 
yet to be decided. 
One thing is clear, though: The blue 
wave that Democrat pollsters and the 
media predicted was coming did not ar-
rive. Americans emphatically did not 
endorse the socialist aims of the far 
left. Instead, they sent a much more 
moderate message. And I hope that 
when all the votes are counted and the 
outcomes of all the races are deter-
mined, Democrats will be able to over-
come the virulent partisanship that 
has characterized their behavior over 
the past 4 years and work with Repub-
licans to deliver results for the Amer-
ican people. 
f 
VETERANS DAY 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, to-
morrow we celebrate Veterans Day, the 
day set aside to honor all those who 
have served in the U.S. Armed Forces. 
This year, we observed the 75th anni-
versary of the end of World War II, and 
our Nation’s World War II veterans, the 
veterans of the ‘‘greatest generation,’’ 
have been on my mind a lot. 
Sixteen million Americans served in 
World War II—16 million. These vet-
erans were a fixture in our lives. So 
many Americans grew up with a dad or 
a grandfather or a grandmother who 
had served in World War II. I was one 
of them. 
My favorite veteran, my dad, was a 
World War II pilot who flew Hellcats 
off the deck of the USS Intrepid in the 
Pacific. I came to know the values of 
the ‘‘greatest generation’’ through my 
dad—humility, patriotism, quiet serv-
ice. 
These warriors who helped save the 
world didn’t brag about their achieve-
ments. They deflected praise. If they 
hailed any exploits, it was those of 
their comrades. My dad won the Distin-
guished Flying Cross—or, I should say, 
received 
the 
Distinguished 
Flying 
Cross, but that is not what he talked 
about. He did, however, talk about 
Cecil Harris, one of South Dakota’s 
aces, whose advice for a deft maneuver 
saved my dad’s life during a dogfight. 
It was a move straight out of ‘‘Top 
Gun,’’ only decades before the movie. 
My dad always talked about how 
South Dakota is the only State with 
two aces with more than 20 shootdowns 
during World War II. And he talked 
about the other pilots in his squadron 
and praised their character and their 
service. 
As I said, these veterans of the 
‘‘greatest generation’’ have been a fix-
ture in our lives for a long time. But 75 
years on from the war, their numbers 
are dwindling and dwindling quickly. 
My dad died in August of this year at 
the age of 100. We lose more and more 
of these veterans every day, and they 
will be sorely missed, but their legacy 
lives on in the generations of veterans 
that have followed them. 
In every age and every era, men and 
women have stepped forward to answer 
the same call that the ‘‘greatest gen-
eration’’ answered. And in every era, 
those men and women, the men and 
women of the U.S. military, have em-
bodied the values that characterized 
men like my dad—humility, courage, 
love of country, self-sacrifice, a love of 
freedom and for their fellow man. 
Service in the military was once 
commonplace. But in an age when only 
a small percentage of the population 
serves, we need to ensure that we don’t 
forget the vital role of our Armed 
Forces and the price our men and 
women in uniform pay to ensure that 
all of us can live in freedom. It has 
been said 10,000 times—but it is no less 
true the ten thousandth and first 
time—that we live in freedom every 
day because of the men and women of 
the U.S. military. We owe them a debt 
we cannot hope to repay. But on Vet-
erans Day and every day, we can re-
member to say thank you. 
I cannot close without mentioning 
the men and women I have met who 
have served and are serving—in par-
ticular, the members of the South Da-
kota National Guard and the airmen at 
Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Da-
kota. 
Right now, members of the South Da-
kota National Guard are deployed in 
support 
of 
Combined 
Joint 
Task 
Force—Horn of Africa. The South Da-
kota Guard also recently served a rota-
tion of deployments to Europe in sup-
port of Operation Atlantic Resolve and 
to the Middle East to support coalition 
forces. Like many of their counterparts 
across the country, they have also been 
a part of the domestic coronavirus re-
sponse. 
At Ellsworth, the B–1 bombers of the 
28th Bomb Wing continue to dem-
onstrate their flexible, global reach 
through Bomber Task Force deploy-
ments. The Bomber Task Force mis-
sions strengthen our continued coordi-
nation with NATO allies in Europe and 
assert America’s commitment to secu-
rity and stability in the Indo-Pacific. 
From the Baltics to the South China 
Sea to the Middle East, the airmen at 
Ellsworth Air Force Base continue to

ready to respond to threats anywhere 
in the world at a moment’s notice. 
As I said, we owe our men and women 
in uniform a debt we cannot hope to 
repay, but we can resolve to live our 
lives in such a way as to be worthy of 
their sacrifices. Today and every day, 
may we remember the gratitude that 
we owe our military men and women 
and imitate their love of freedom and 
their devotion to our country. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
BLACKBURN). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
f 
2020 ELECTIONS 
Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, a 
Republican candidate in California by 
the name of Errol Webber lost his race 
for Congress by 72 points, and yet he is 
not conceding that he has lost. He says: 
I’m going to the Los Angeles County Reg-
istrar’s Office to audit the vote counting pro-
cedures. I will NOT concede. Every LEGAL 
vote needs to be counted! 
Just up the road in Maryland, a Re-
publican candidate by the name of Kim 
Klacik lost by 40 points, and she is re-
fusing to concede. She retweeted a post 
from President Trump in which she 
claimed that the election was stolen, 
and she wrote: 
I beat my opponent on day of & in-person 
early voting, along with absentee. However, 
97k mail in ballots were found in his favor? 
My colleagues, there is an epidemic 
of delusion that is spreading out from 
the White House and infecting the en-
tire Republican Party in the wake of 
this election, and it presents a real 
threat to this country. 
President Trump didn’t win the elec-
tion. Every single one of my colleagues 
knows this. And he didn’t just lose. He 
lost by a pretty substantial margin. He 
lost by 4.3 percent of the popular vote, 
likely around 70 electoral votes when 
all the counting is done. 
And while the results haven’t been 
certified yet, this isn’t the election in 
2000. There aren’t any hanging chads. 
We are not arguing about 500 votes 
here or there. In Michigan, the margin 
today is 148,000. In Nevada, the margin 
is 36,000. In Pennsylvania, it is 47,000. 
In Wisconsin, it is 20,000. In Georgia, it 
is 12,000. In Arizona, it is 14,000. Thou-
sands and thousands of votes are these 
margins. 
Hillary Clinton, in 2016, lost by less 
than the President did in Pennsylvania 
and Michigan and by about the same 
amount in Wisconsin, and she conceded 
the day after the election. Now, this is 
important, and I think we need to talk 
about it here because it has real con-
sequences for democracy and for na-
tional security. 
Why hasn’t the President conceded? 
Now, it is not because there was voter 
fraud or because the election was sto-
len from him. We are a week out, and 
the 
President 
is 
still 
desperately 
searching for evidence of fraud. He 
won’t find it because it doesn’t exist. It 
doesn’t exist in Pennsylvania or Michi-
gan or Wisconsin or Georgia. 
The President has empowered the De-
partment of Justice to now go out and 
launch investigations of voter fraud de-
spite a longstanding precedent for the 
DOJ to stay out of elections if their ac-
tions could be determinative. But the 
President is so desperate now to fill in 
his mythology, his narrative, with 
facts that he doesn’t have, that he is 
sending the DOJ on this massive na-
tional fishing expedition. 
He 
hasn’t 
conceded—not 
because 
there is fraud. There hasn’t been. He is 
not conceding because he believes that 
there is a chance he could remain as 
President without having won the elec-
tion, so long as congressional Repub-
licans are willing to stick with him 
step by step by step, and, so far, there 
is no evidence that congressional Re-
publicans are ever going to step away 
from President Trump’s delusional as-
sault on democracy. 
Senator MCCONNELL said this week 
that the President is ‘‘within his 
rights’’ to fight the election. That is of 
course true. The President can keep fil-
ing frivolous legal challenges if he 
wants. We are not going to stop him 
from doing that. But just because he 
has the right to mount these legal 
challenges, that doesn’t mean that Re-
publicans here have to support him in 
those efforts if they contravene the in-
terests of democracy and the interests 
of a smooth transition of power. 
Today, 
Republicans 
support 
the 
President’s refusal to concede. They 
support his lawsuits. They call on elec-
tion officials—most recently, in Geor-
gia—who refuse to bend their knee to 
Trump to resign, and they endorsed the 
President’s decision to refuse to begin 
the transition. 
This may sort of seem like a side-
show now to the inevitability of a 
transfer of power, but what is next? 
What if President Trump asks Repub-
licans here to contest the selection of 
electors? What if he gets the message 
from Republicans in Congress that if 
you are willing to support all the steps 
he has taken since Tuesday, that you 
will continue to support his efforts to 
try to remain in office despite losing 
both the popular vote and the electoral 
college? That is within his rights, to 
ask you to support a contest of elec-
tors. But will you do it? What so far 
have we seen to suggest that there is 
an end to your decision to put your al-
legiance to this President above an al-
legiance to the country? 
The Secretary of State was asked 
today if he thought there would be a 
smooth transition of power from Presi-
dent Trump to the winner of the elec-
tion, Vice President and President- 
Elect Biden. And Secretary Pompeo 
said: ‘‘There will be a smooth transi-
tion to a second Trump administra-
tion.’’ 
Listen, these guys aren’t playing. 
This isn’t just for show. They are going 
to keep pushing the bounds of democ-
racy until somebody stops them. It is 
logical to ask: If Republicans have 
been willing to support every con-
spiracy that the President has engaged 
in over the last week, then why 
wouldn’t they support the next set of 
attacks on democracy that this Presi-
dent engages in? 
How far are Republicans willing to go 
in their attacks against the decision of 
voters? 
Now, for the President, there is real-
ly no downside to what he is doing 
right now. Either he steals the election 
or he grows his political power, because 
we have learned in the last 24 hours 
that the President is raising money 
today online from his supporters, not 
for a fund that is designed to strictly 
finance a recount effort but for a new 
political action committee that he has 
established that will fund his political 
efforts over the next 4 years. The but-
ton you click may give you the idea 
that you are supporting the President’s 
recount but, in fact, you are helping 
him to amass resources that will allow 
him to be a major political presence for 
the next 4 years. So either the Presi-
dent is successful in continuing this as-
sault on the transition of power or he 
is able to amass resources that help 
him into the future. 
There is no downside for the Presi-
dent. There is a big downside for the 
rest of us. There is a big downside for 
this country. 
In the short run, the country’s na-
tional security is threatened by a 
messy transition. This has been cov-
ered, I think, well today, but, tradi-
tionally, the President-elect would be 
able to start getting briefings on na-
tional security threats, would start to 
get access to classified information, 
and would begin to be able to do back-
ground checks on individuals that he 
would like to be part of his national se-
curity cabinet. Traditionally, those are 
among the first confirmations that 
move through this body, the Presi-
dent’s national security team. All of 
that is being delayed by a President 
who refuses to begin a transition and a 
Republican Senate that refuses to put 
pressure on the President to change his 
mind. 
But, also, and in some ways more in-
sidious, is the attack on the rule of law 
and the idea of peaceful transition of 
power itself. The narrative that Presi-
dent Trump is spreading and that con-
gressional Republicans are facilitating 
right now that the election was stolen 
or rigged, it isn’t being written on a 
white board that is going to be neatly 
and tidily erased as soon as 2021 shows 
up. No, the work that is being done 
right now by the Republican Party to 
undermine faith in our elections will 
have a very long, very long tale. And 
when the American people or a large

percentage of them lose faith in elec-
tions, when they are told by leaders 
they trust that elections that were ac-
tually held legitimately are illegit-
imate, 
then, 
those 
individuals, 
of 
course, will naturally lose faith in pub-
lic institutions themselves. If all the 
people who got elected were illegit-
imately chosen, then, so must be the 
actions they take once they are in of-
fice. 
Now, maybe that is consistent with 
the general Republican project over the 
last several decades. I have watched as 
Republicans have engaged in a with-
ering assault on the public sector. The 
whole idea from Republicans has been 
that government is illegitimate by its 
very nature and can’t do anything to 
help you or to solve your problems. But 
that idea, if it is, in fact, the goal of 
my 
Republican 
colleagues 
to 
delegitimize 
public 
institutions 
by 
delegitimizing elections, is really dan-
gerous for two reasons. One, don’t as-
sume that democracy can survive this. 
If the 45 percent of the country that 
supports Donald Trump doesn’t really 
believe that elections are legitimate, I 
am not sure that democracy hangs 
around for another 100 years. But, sec-
ond, we are living in a moment where 
it is really important for people to 
have faith in public institutions. There 
is no way for us to turn the corner on 
this pandemic unless people believe 
what leaders are telling them about 
how to conduct themselves or about 
how we are going to administer a vac-
cine or about why the business around 
the corner from you is limiting the 
number of people who can enter it. In 
the middle of a pandemic that has 
killed going on 250,000 Americans, los-
ing faith in public institutions is dead-
ly. 
The President is delusional. There 
was no voter fraud. He lost. The Amer-
ican people, by a large margin, chose 
Joe Biden as President of the United 
States, and this delusion is not a 
quaint sideshow. It is an assault on our 
democracy that will have consequences 
for the future viability of democracy 
but also for the viability of public in-
stitutions to meet crises like the one 
that we stand in the middle of today. 
The President’s behavior and the be-
havior of Republicans in Congress who 
support him is dangerously unpatri-
otic. When we arrive in the Senate we 
swear an oath to our country, not to 
our party, and right now our President 
and congressional Republicans are not 
living up to that oath. 
I yield the floor.

VETERANS DAY 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, 
today in Oklahoma, people are going to 
work, people are going to school, peo-
ple are on their job, people are in their 
yard, people are on bikes, people are 
going for a quiet run in beautiful 
weather because tomorrow is Veterans 
Day. We enjoy freedom and peace today 
because of what those veterans have 
done for a very long time. 
Whatever community you are in in 
Oklahoma, whether you are in Okla-
homa City or in Tulsa, or in Lawton, 
whether you are in Guymon, or Idabel, 
Altus, or Waukomis—it doesn’t mat-
ter—you are going to find drawings; 
you are going to find displays; you are 
going to find military hardware; you 
are going to find memorials and monu-
ments to veterans who have served be-
cause across our State we remember 
extremely well the sacrifice that has 
been made for the quietness of this 
day, the ability to have an election, 
the ability to send our kids to school, 
the ability to work hard, to fight off a 
virus, the ability to invent and inno-
vate because 1 percent of our Nation 
has set aside their life to be able to 
guard the rest of the 99 percent of us. 
We in Oklahoma could not be more 
grateful for the service of those women 
and men over the years and currently. 
As a nation, we pause on Veterans 
Day and remember, but I think about 
veterans who don’t just pause once a 
year to do it. It is part of who they are. 
They served our Nation in the mili-
tary, and they find ways to continue to 
serve veterans and to serve the people 
around them in their community every 
single day. 
There are people who work at the 
veterans centers in Oklahoma who are 
remarkable people who help veterans 
literally every week to be able to work 
through and navigate the bureaucracy. 
Our office works with them to try to 
get solutions and answers if they have 
issues with the VA or they have issues 
with trying to get their medals or 
whatever it may be. But these volun-
teers are scattered all across our State. 
We have staff members today who are 
working in veterans facilities scattered 
all over the State who are taking care 
of veterans who are basically in an as-
sisted living-type environment or in a 
nursing long-term care environment. 
Those individuals get up every single 
day and love on veterans. They look 
them in the eye, when they are now at 
their weakest moment of their life 
since their infancy, and say: Our Na-
tion still cares about you. 
There are people today in Oklahoma 
who work on Federal housing programs 
designed to help veterans who are 
homeless on the street to get care, to 
find a place to live, and to get estab-
lished. There are people in Oklahoma 
today who are working with Federal 
programs to help veterans who have 
struggled with addiction, some who 
didn’t reacclimate well. They are help-
ing them right now because our Nation 
has not forgotten about them. 
While we grieve with those who 
grieve—because 
Veterans 
Day 
also 
brings back the memory, for some fam-
ilies who are Gold Star families, of the 
ones they have lost—we remind them 
again that we have not forgotten, and 
we say thank you to those folks who 
are serving our veterans every single 
day. 
I also think about folks like Bob 
Ford, who lives in Okeene, OK. He is 
working at Shawnee Milling Company 
and does a remarkable job just pro-
viding for the people in the commu-
nity, but he has also kept alive the 
memory of fellow Vietnam veterans. In 
so many ways, he helps not only the 
park and other places to remember, but 
he also makes sure on Veterans Day 
that there are speakers in local schools 
and that someone is retelling the mes-
sage. He is the one in the community 
who is always making sure there is a 
patriotic display at some point. You 
see, he is a Vietnam veteran himself 
who is serving and working in the com-
munity but who has also turned around 
said, though his uniform is not on any-
more, he wants to make sure the next 
generation knows what honorable serv-
ice really looks like. 
There are folks like Terry Hill from 
Kellyville, OK, who enlisted in the 
Army in 2013 as an engineer and was 
commissioned as an officer in 2008. He 
became a Black Hawk aeromedical re-
search and maintenance test pilot. He 
flew 750 combat missions in Afghani-
stan over multiple deployments before 
he came down really, really hard one 
time and had a medical discharge. 
You see, for Terry, Veterans Day is 
not a once-a-year thing. He founded 
Rapid Application Group in his home. 
It is an additive manufacturing com-
pany. In fact, his is the only additive 
manufacturing company that has a dis-
abled veteran running it in the entire 
country. 
Every 
Friday, 
he 
has 
a 
hashtag ‘‘RAG Friday.’’ Many of those 
who work in his company are also fel-
low veterans. But every Friday, he re-
minds everyone to watch out for fellow 
veterans, to watch out for issues like 
possible suicide senses, to engage with 
those folks who have made great sac-
rifices to serve our Nation, and to con-
tinue to check on them because some 
of the things they have experienced 
and some of the challenges they have 
faced leave lasting memories for them. 
As they stood for our freedom and our 
country forgets those moments, they 
never do because they have lived them 
firsthand. So his simple way to do RAG 
Fridays every Friday and to challenge 
folks to not forget veterans in your 
community is his way of being able to 
serve folks. 
Again, as a nation, we have not for-
gotten, but we are exceptionally grate-
ful for those who remind us as a nation 
not just to remember once a year but 
to stay engaged with those veterans 
who have given so much and continue 
to give so much. 
Honestly, I don’t know a veteran who 
is not still serving. They find ways to

serve each other. They find ways to 
serve their community because it is in 
their heart, and it is deep within their 
soul. They have served our Nation, and 
they will continue to serve our Nation. 
And while some need our help, I most 
often hear from veterans: How can I 
help? 
So let me just say from my heart and 
from my State: Thank you, again, for 
serving the way that you serve. Allow 
us to say thank you to you face-to-face 
today and to tell you once again, we 
have not forgotten, and we are grateful 
for the sacrifice you and your family 
have made. 
For those Gold Star families, we can-
not thank you enough because every 
day you remember, and you need to 
hear from us that so do we. 
When the Israelites crossed over the 
Jordan, they went back into that dry 
area and gathered stones. And they set 
those stones on the embankment for 
one specific purpose. 
The purpose was simple. They said: 
When your children walk past these 
stones in the days ahead and they say 
‘‘What are those stones for?’’ you are 
to remind them of the faithfulness of 
God. They were to be a permanent re-
minder. 
Allow Veterans Day and the military 
memorials all over the State today to 
be a good teaching moment for our 
children so that when they say ‘‘Why is 
that there?’’ we remind them of the 
freedom that we have and the cost of 
that freedom and express our gratitude 
again to the veterans who have served 
us. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
f 
CLIMATE CHANGE 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, as I begin my remarks, let me 
thank my friend Senator LANKFORD for 
his eloquent comments about our vet-
erans and those who have served and 
given their lives for us. 
I am here with my trusty and bat-
tered ‘‘Time to Wake up’’ graphic be-
cause, after 4 dark years on climate, 
there is at last a glimmer of light on 
the horizon. 
President-Elect Biden has promised 
to redirect the executive branch to ad-
dress climate change in the clear light 
of real science, out of the dark swamp 
of fossil fuel denial and obstruction, 
trying—trying—to head off a climate 
catastrophe while there is still time, if 
there is still time. 
There is a lot the executive branch 
can do. The President can lead diplo-
matic and international trade initia-
tives. The environmental regulatory 
agencies of government can be freed 
from corrupting influence to do their 
duty with vigor based on science and 
the law. Securities regulators can put 
climate risk to the economy at the 
forefront, as the Commodity Futures 
Trading Commission has just done. 
Purchasing decisions can be directed 
toward a clean energy future. Permit-
ting decisions can be made with the so-
cial cost of carbon pollution in mind, 
as courts have already begun to de-
mand even in the corrupt Trump era. 
On the investigative side, the admin-
istration can begin a hard look at the 
forces of corruption that have block-
aded action on climate change: Who 
did this and how? Did their political 
spending violate campaign finance, 
conflict of interest, or other laws? Did 
their toxic propaganda violate laws 
against fraud, as the tobacco industry’s 
did? Was their occupation of regulatory 
agencies a rolling conspiracy to violate 
the Administrative Procedures Act, 
and if so, how and for whom was it or-
ganized? Has their interference in the 
judiciary compromised the rights of 
parties or the integrity of courts? 
American citizens deserve a full and 
fearless exposition of why Congress has 
thwarted the public will to do some-
thing—anything—meaningful 
to 
ad-
dress this climate crisis and at whose 
behest. 
What were the forces of corruption, 
and how did they accomplish their ne-
farious purpose? There is a lesson in 
democracy here for the citizens of this 
great Republic—a lesson that is now 
hidden behind phony front groups and 
subterranean 
rivers 
of 
anonymous 
money. There is every reason to believe 
that the biggest covert op in history 
has been run in and against our own 
government. That is no way for a ‘‘city 
on a hill’’ to be governed. 
But with all the executive branch 
policy work and all the investigations 
that are due and overdue, there is no 
pathway to climate safety that does 
not go through Congress. Action by 
Congress is a necessity, not a luxury. I 
have seen no study showing any path-
way to safety without action by Con-
gress. 
To make that pathway to safety pos-
sible, we will have to change a few 
things. One is, as I said, to investigate 
the denial and obstruction campaign 
run by the fossil fuel industry, how it 
used its dark weaponry of political 
spending—much of it anonymous—and 
political propaganda. The executive 
branch can do this, but so can the 
House. Sadly, here in the Senate, the 
power 
of 
the 
fossil 
fuel 
industry 
assures no such investigation will hap-
pen in our committees if Republicans 
keep control of the Senate. But the 
House or a high-level Presidential com-
mission or our Department of Justice 
all have tools to bring the light of 
transparency into these dark and slimy 
corners. 
Separately, we can display to the 
American people what corporate Amer-
ica says about climate change versus 
what it does in Congress. It may even 
surprise some CEOs what their cor-
porate lobbying posture actually is. If 
you are a CEO who is sincere about 
this, you ought to commission an audit 
of your corporate lobbying and elec-
tioneering on climate. Here is what 
you will find, unless you are maybe 
Patagonia or Ben & Jerry’s: Most every 
major American corporation does noth-
ing in Congress on climate—zip, zero, 
nada. 
TechNet lobbies for the supposedly 
climate-friendly Silicon Valley giants 
like Apple, Google, Facebook, and 
Microsoft. It even represents green en-
ergy companies. Yet this year its 
glossy, 13-page menu of priorities for 
Congress never even mentioned climate 
change or green energy. 
Coke 
and 
Pepsi 
lobby 
Congress 
through an American Beverage Asso-
ciation that doesn’t lift a finger on cli-
mate. That corporate behemoth, the 
U.S. 
Chamber 
of 
Commerce—three 
times the lobbying muscle of its next 
nearest rival, sometimes the biggest 
dark-money spender in elections, a per-
sistent voice in our courts and regu-
latory agencies—that chamber is in a 
statistical tie for America’s worst cli-
mate obstructer—worst. 
Representing Ford and GM, Abbott 
Labs and Johnson & Johnson, Citibank 
and 
Bank 
of 
America, 
Delta 
and 
United, Target and Home Depot, Intel 
and AT&T, and dozens of other big 
businesses 
is 
a 
worst 
climate 
obstructer in America. That deserves 
some explaining. 
Don’t just blame Congress. By doing 
nothing, Congress is exactly following 
what corporate America actually asks 
of Congress: Do nothing. Do nothing. 
We don’t care. 
Want to open a pathway for a safe 
climate through Congress? Republicans 
in Congress are going to have to hear 
that their corporate benefactors de-
mand climate action. They aren’t hear-
ing that now. They are hearing the op-
posite. They are hearing: We don’t 
care. 
Democrats are ready. We have been 
ready for a decade. Republicans, at 
least since Citizens United—it was 
quite bipartisan before that decision— 
won’t touch the issue, and by an amaz-
ing coincidence, that party is almost 
entirely funded by the unlimited and 
often anonymous donations of the fos-
sil fuel industry. The money is often 
hidden, of course, behind donor trusts 
and shell corporations and 501(c)(4) tax 
organizations, but it is there, and it is 
billions. 
The rest of corporate America has 
not pushed back. They have their own 
tax breaks to protect and their own in-
dustry priorities to pursue, and climate 
change just doesn’t make it into their 
corporate political agenda. Getting the 
so-called good guys off the bench and 
onto the field could make a big dif-
ference, but they are not there now— 
not yet. 
If corporations are going to fail this 
moral test so catastrophically, it is 
fair to ask what good it does to give 
corporations any role in our politics, 
let alone the commanding role they 
now assert in the U.S. Congress. The 
Founding Fathers, for one, would be as-
tonished to see these monsters loose in 
our politics at all, let alone so large 
and in charge.

But that is for another day. Right 
now, there is a lot President-Elect 
Biden can do to break the political log-
jam fossil fuel money has built: Inves-
tigate it, expose it, and then over-
whelm it. Recruit allies to help push 
back hard. Give no audience or corner 
to corporations funding climate ob-
struction. Make lobbying groups dis-
close who their big donors are so the 
American citizen isn’t played for a 
chump—the mark in a giant con game. 
If you don’t think big American in-
dustries are capable of committing 
massive fraud, read the decision of the 
Federal judge in the fraud case the 
United States won against Big Tobacco 
for that scheme of lies or read the deci-
sion of the U.S. Circuit Court of Ap-
peals upholding her verdict. It took in-
vestigation to get to the truth, not pol-
itics. Indeed, investigation had to 
pierce through a fog of industry poli-
tics and lies. But at the end of the day 
and, more specifically, at the end of 
the investigation, the truth was out, 
and the truth was massive industry 
fraud.

f 
WESTERN SAHARA 
Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, last 
week, while most of the world was fo-
cused on our elections—myself in-
cluded—and the pending results, a very 
significant action was taking place 
halfway around the world in Western 
Sahara. Simply put, Morocco chose 
that time—likely purposely, when ev-
eryone 
was 
occupied 
doing 
other 
things—to threaten to push back on 
protests by Western Saharans on their 
own land. 
There they are. These are the pro-
testers. These are people who owned 
the land, have been there for genera-
tions, and are protesting the problems 
they have with Morocco trying to eject 
them from their land. 
It seems simple, but you have to re-
member how we got here. While the 
status of the Sahrawi people is still in 
question, what we need to do to is cre-
ate a lasting solution. How we got 
here, 
as 
West 
Africa 
was 
being 
decolonized, Western Sahara was clear 
and declared itself an independent na-
tion a long time ago. That was despite 
Morocco’s attempt to claim it as a ter-
ritory. 
In 1966, the United Nations General 
Assembly resolution agreed that a ref-
erendum of self-determination should 
be held. That is a referendum of self- 
determination of the people of Western 
Sahara. Everyone agreed and planned 
to hold that in 1975. 
Self-determination—merely 
letting 
the Sahrawi people decide for them-
selves the imperative principle of ac-
tion—the right to judge for themselves 
to be independent or to be a part of Mo-
rocco. 
This was just the first promise of a 
referendum. That was 1975. To date, 
none have been kept. An International 
Court of Justice opinion from 1975 also 
agreed that Morocco did not have sov-
ereignty over the land and that a ref-
erendum of self-determination should 
be held. Everyone agreed. That was the 
second promise. 
Morocco 
maintained 
its 
unlawful 
claim 
to 
their 
land 
and 
after 
decolonization, attempted to annex the 
territory with force. That was actually 
in 1975. 
Western Sahara—officially called the 
Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, 
through the Polisario, defended their 
rights to land. 
We are talking about this area right 
here. Morocco is up to the north, in 
Western 
Sahara. 
The 
independent 
Western Sahara land that Morocco is 
trying to claim as their own is to the 
south of that. 
After a decade of violence from Mo-
rocco, the United Nations finally came 
in, in 1991, and both sides agreed to a 
cease-fire and a path forward. Everyone 
agreed. It was called the Settlement 
Plan. It solidified that Morocco and 
Western Sahara agreed to hold a ref-
erendum and created the United Na-
tions Mission for the referendum in 
Western 
Sahara. 
That 
is 
called 
MINURSO. 
For those keeping track, that was 
the third promise. It is worth noting 
that the United Nations regularly reaf-
firms the 1991 commitment to a ref-
erendum for self-determination. This is 
something that happens on a regular 
basis. 
The planned referendum in 1992 never 
took place, and the process stalled 
through a cease-fire that was held. Mo-
rocco just wouldn’t hold up its end of 
the bargain. 
Former Secretary of State James 
Baker—it is kind of interesting because 
back in 1997, he tried to do this again. 
I can remember talking to him—this 
was several years ago now, about 15 
years ago—saying that sometime we 
have to get this problem resolved. It 
has been hanging out there for genera-
tions and decades. He said: Well, good 
luck. We have tried to do everything 
we could do. Back at that time, he was 
Secretary of State under President 
Bush. 
He named a special envoy to Western 
Sahara. Baker worked the multiple 
plans with Morocco and Western Sa-
hara. He thought he could get it done. 
He was a special envoy way back in 
1992. 
The former Secretary of State tried 
again in 1997. He named a special envoy 
to Western Sahara. Baker worked mul-
tiple plans with Morocco and Western 
Sahara again. 
The 
most 
notable—the 
Houston 
Agreement—was signed by Morocco 
and Western Sahara and recommitted 
to the referendum of self-determina-
tion, planned for 1998. To keep track, 
that is the fourth time that was prom-
ised. That was promised also by Mo-
rocco. 
Morocco, 
recognizing 
they 
would 
likely lose the vote, quickly tanked all 
negotiations the next year by declaring 
they would never accept a referendum 
that included independence as an out-
come, despite years of promises. 
It has been called a frozen conflict— 
where no outcome exists. Yet there is 
no perceived active conflict. It makes 
it easy for the rest of the world to for-
get about it. But to call this a frozen 
conflict makes it seem harmless, when 
in reality it is anything but that. 
Tens of thousands of Sahrawi people 
live in refugee camps, primarily in 
Tindouf, 
Algeria. 
They 
have 
been 
forced from their homes, waiting for a 
resolution for decades. Allowing this 
process to stall has cost them a genera-
tion of freedom. I have been to those 
camps many times. I have been there. I 
have seen it. I have talked to the peo-
ple. 
We are talking about these people 
here—the ones who are protesting. 
That is where we have been and talked 
to the individuals. And they don’t give 
up. They continue generation after 
generation with the hope that they 
would get their land back. 
Beyond denying the Sahrawi people 
the right to freedom and self-deter-
mination, the Government of Morocco 
is trying to steal and pillage as much 
as possible from the land they have un-
lawfully claimed. They are stealing 
their 
natural 
resources, 
unlawfully 
mining and selling valuable, critical 
minerals—specifically phosphate. They 
are illegally fishing in the Western Sa-
hara’s waters. 
And what does Morocco do with these 
riches? They pay millions of dollars 
each year to lobbyists in Washington. 
Their goal? To convince the world they 
are innocent and demonize the Sahrawi 
people. 
The Moroccans believe that they can 
wait out the rest of the world. They 
want us to forget about the human 
rights of these people, in this picture, 
who are peacefully protesting today— 
right now—as we are speaking on the 
floor. 
They know a frozen conflict benefits 
them and hurts the cause of independ-
ence. They know that they can push 
the boundaries of what is acceptable. 
That is how we got to this point. That 
is why we are here at this point now— 
where just a few weeks ago, while the 
people of Western Sahara were peace-
fully protesting in Guerguerat—that is 
the region. The Guerguerat region is 
down there. It is not even close to Mo-
rocco. It is down to the south end of 
Western Sahara. It actually comes into 
Mauritania down there.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6635 
November 10, 2020 
That is the area that has the red 
square around it. That is what we are 
talking about. That is where they are 
now. That is where these people are 
right now. 
Morocco has repeatedly attempted to 
use a road in this region to transport 
the goods in violation of the U.N. 
cease-fire agreement. Let’s keep in 
mind, it is the U.N. cease-fire agree-
ment. They are the ones who are sup-
posed to be promoting—not just pro-
tecting a cease-fire on both sides but 
promoting a referendum. It was this il-
legal use of the territory that Western 
Saharans were peacefully protesting. 
Rather than recognizing their rights 
to protest, Morocco has once again 
raised a call to arms and is threatening 
to crush these legitimate protesters. 
In fact, I heard just the other day—3 
days ago—that they have some 200 
trucks coming down from Morocco 
down to Guerguerat—that area down 
there where the peaceful protests are 
taking place. 
Rather than recognize their right to 
protest, Morocco has once again raised 
a called to arms and is threatening to 
crush these protests that are going on. 
King Mohammed of Morocco this 
past weekend said: ‘‘Morocco will not 
waiver in its position.’’ That is in spite 
of what the—all the agreements that 
have taken place, including the United 
Nations. 
We are also hearing concerned re-
ports that he is sending military forces 
to the region as well as in a clear esca-
lation. This isn’t a new problem. Mo-
rocco has been trying to illegally use 
the Guerguerat issue for a long period 
of time. 
That is the bridge that goes across 
from Western Sahara to Mauritania. 
The problem has been there for a long 
period of time. It is a concern for a 
couple of reasons. The first is simple. 
Morocco is escalating this situation 
again to claim more and more land, re-
sources, and rights that they have no 
law behind them to claim. And they 
know it. They are fully aware of this. 
In 2017, the United States was en-
couraging the United Nations to send a 
technical team to Guerguerat. Western 
Sahara 
welcomed 
this. 
Morocco 
blocked it because they didn’t want to 
be exposed. 
The second is that no one else—no 
one around the world—is raising the 
cause for alarm. Where is the United 
Nations now? They are charged with 
enforcing the 1991 cease-fire agree-
ment. Yet they are nowhere to be 
found. They have been very silent, tol-
erating Morocco’s abuse for years and 
Morocco’s violations of the U.N. orders. 
That is why the time is now to move 
from this frozen conflict and force Mo-
rocco to live up to their agreement of 
nearly 30 years and hold a referendum, 
not in a year and not in 3 years—they 
are always talking about what they are 
going to do out in the future—but now. 
Now is the time that we can do that. 
We need to take steps to hold the ref-
erendum for self-determination now. 
Morocco is escalating and, left un-
checked, they are going to keep their 
escalation going. The result would be 
inevitable. We would risk turning back 
to the times of open conflict. The U.N. 
needs to step up now and enforce their 
agreement, and the world needs to 
prove we all stand for our values of 
freedom and democracy by extending 
those values to the Sahrawis. They 
have waited too long. 
Everyone is for this agreement—ev-
eryone is. I mean, we have the African 
Union, which is comprised of some 55 
member states, and they are strongly 
in support of this independence for the 
Sahrawis. We have most of the Euro-
pean Community that supports the 
U.N. efforts. The European Court of 
Justice also ruled that Western Sahara 
is not a part of Morocco and that no 
EU economic agreements can cover 
Western Sahara. 
In 2004, the United States and Mo-
rocco had a free-trade agreement where 
they did reaffirm—and that is the 
United States reaffirming—the inde-
pendence of Western Sahara. 
That is what is happening right now. 
The rest of the world is on our side on 
this issue. Who does Morocco have? 
They have paid lobbyists. Some of the 
lobbyists Morocco has employed: JPC 
Strategies, Third Circle, Neale Creek— 
averaging over $1 million each year. In 
total, they have had some 10 lobbyists 
since 2016. And they have actually put 
in $11 million—$11 million in the Sa-
hara. In Western Sahara, they have 
nothing. They have no resources. They 
are the giant with all of their lobby-
ists. 
I made it clear earlier when I testi-
fied—and by the way, I did something I 
don’t think has been done before since 
then: As a Member of the U.S. Senate, 
I testified at a House hearing that they 
had on this issue way back 15 years 
ago. This has stalled because there is 
just no money on our side. Morocco has 
it all. 
Here is what we need to do. The time 
is right, and we have waited long 
enough. While we were to schedule a 
referendum, we need the United Na-
tions to send a team to the Guerguerat 
area and confirm that Morocco is in 
violation of the agreement. Everyone 
knows they are in violation of the 
agreement. The agreement is very spe-
cific. It says that they are there to en-
force this—the United Nations. This is 
the key part. They need to enforce the 
1991 cease-fire agreement. This will re-
store faith with all parties and make 
real progress in reaching a referendum. 
The reason we are concerned today is 
that we know Morocco, right now, is 
sending military equipment down to 
the area—some 200 trucks full of equip-
ment. That is why this time is right, 
and it is going to have to happen. 
Here they are. These are the people 
we are talking about. These are the 
people who are peacefully protesting to 
keep and use the land that is theirs and 
that has been theirs and that the whole 
world knows is theirs. They are the 
victims. They deserve a referendum for 
separate termination, and the U.N. is 
going to have to make this happen. I 
don’t know any other way this can hap-
pen. 
First of all, they have agreed to it, 
and the U.N. is a party that can put 
that together. We are calling on them 
now to go ahead and do what they have 
agreed to do and end this conflict that 
has endured generation after genera-
tion. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

SIDY). The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk

the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
2020 ELECTIONS 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I had to 
look at my watch today to remind my-
self it has been a week since the No-
vember 3 general election. I must say, 
it seems it has been much longer than 
that. 
Just as we have every 4 years 
throughout our Nation’s history, the 
American people voted for our next 
Commander in Chief. In the months 
leading up to election day, we know 
the atmosphere was tense. The days of 
counting that followed it have been, as 
well, but I have full faith that our con-
stitutional Republic is working just ex-
actly the way it should. 
A record-setting 150 million people 
and counting cast a ballot this elec-
tion. In my State, there were 10.9 mil-
lion voters—almost 11 million. The last 
time I was on the ballot, there were 4.7 
million. So we have seen a huge influx 
of people and increased participation in 
the electoral process, and I think both 
of those are good things. 
The reason people come to Texas is 
that we are still a land of opportunity, 
where people can come and work hard, 
start out with little, build something 
for themselves and their families, pro-
vide value to others so they can come 
find a job and provide for their fami-
lies, which is, to me, the definition of 
the American dream. 
We know that election workers and 
poll workers have worked across our 
country to ensure that every legal 
vote—whether it was in person or by 
mail—will be counted, and that is as it 
should be. I know major media outlets 
have projected that former Vice Presi-
dent Biden has secured enough elec-
toral votes to be our next President, 
but there are still votes to be counted. 
As my friend the majority leader noted 
yesterday, the Constitution gives no 
role in this process to wealthy media 
companies. 
Between recounts and legal chal-
lenges, it is tough to say exactly when 
the election will be certified. But if 
there are irregularities, if there are

questionable practices or wrongdoing, 
President Trump and his campaign— 
like every other candidate and their 
campaign—are entitled to seek legal 
remedies in court. Of course, if they do, 
they will be obligated to present evi-
dence, which I understand is in the 
process of being marshaled, and to do 
so, obviously, with dispatch. 
But while this process may seem 
drawn out to us living in the moment, 
legal challenges are not unprecedented. 
For example, back in 2000, we remem-
ber—some of us remember, most of us 
remember—the example of Al Gore, the 
Democratic nominee for President who 
didn’t concede the election until De-
cember 13. During the weeks following 
the election, the American people wait-
ed patiently as the courts weighed in, 
and once they did, we all accepted the 
result. Acceptance of the result is key. 
I had faith in the process that led to 
that result just as I have faith in the 
process and institutions that are work-
ing now. 
When the Electoral College meets on 
January 6, 2021, every American should 
have confidence in the free and fair 
elections that led to that result. Let 
me say that again. When the Electoral 
College meets on January 6, 2021, every 
American—win or lose—every Amer-
ican, every candidate should have con-
fidence in the free and fair elections 
that led to the result. I think this is 
perhaps the single most important rea-
son to let the process that is currently 
underway run its course. If one side or 
the other or, more importantly, the 
voters who, ultimately, voted for the 
candidate who loses feel the process is 
unfair or has been jammed through un-
reasonably, are they likely to accept 
the result of the election or will they 
feel cheated? Well, acceptance of that 
result is perhaps the single most im-
portant goal we ought to strive to 
achieve. 
The peaceful transition of power is 
perhaps the single greatest feature of 
our constitutional system. Every 4 or 8 
years, the most powerful person in the 
world steps aside to allow their suc-
cessor, chosen by the people, to take 
charge. Of course, many wars have 
been fought, blood has been shed, and 
lives have been lost to secure this right 
to us as Americans and to ensure that 
peaceful transition of power after all 
the votes are counted. 
Yet in America, dating back to 1797, 
when Washington willingly passed the 
torch to Adams, the peaceful transition 
of power has defined the office of Presi-
dent. It is a legacy that our forefathers 
established and one that generations of 
Americans have fought hard to protect. 
So in 2 months’ time, we will see this 
American constitutional process play 
out once again. I have complete con-
fidence in that conclusion. 
While the Presidential race has domi-
nated headlines over the last week, it 
was only one of the many races on the 
ballot, as the Presiding Officer knows 
from personal experience. From city 
halls to courthouses, to State houses, 
to Congress, Americans cast their 
votes for leaders at every level of gov-
ernment. I was honored—as I am sure 
my colleague from Louisiana, the Pre-
siding Officer, was—to be reelected by 
the people of our State for another 
term in the U.S. Senate. 
During the campaign, I had a chance 
to present my record of service, and I 
was happy to do that to demonstrate 
that I have consistently fought to pro-
tect the rights of Texans and create 
more opportunities for every family to 
achieve their American dream. 
Collectively, here in Washington, we 
have brought down taxes for American 
families. We have empowered job cre-
ators. We have strengthened our crimi-
nal background check system for gun 
purchases, and we have reformed our 
criminal justice system, just to name a 
few things. 
But we have also worked hard to 
make healthcare more affordable by 
presenting more choices for consumers. 
We have supported quality education, 
and we have tried to make sure that 
safe communities are a reality for 
folks across the country and across the 
economic spectrum. 
In Texas, we have provided funding 
to rebuild following hurricanes and tor-
nados and other natural disasters, like 
many other States. 
And throughout the COVID–19 crisis, 
we have provided unprecedented fund-
ing to help our frontline healthcare he-
roes, our small businesses, and our 
families stay afloat amid so much un-
certainty. 
I am grateful for the opportunity to 
continue to fight for a bright future for 
every family in Texas and to work with 
my colleagues to make sure that same 
promise is a reality for all Americans, 
and that is true regardless of who they 
voted for. That is exactly what I plan 
to do. I don’t just represent the people 
who voted for me in this election; I rep-
resent all 29 million—and growing— 
Texans. I am honored to do it. 
We have added a few new faces to the 
Texas delegation in the House, and I 
am eager to work with these men and 
women and my friend Senator CRUZ as 
Team Texas as we continue our record 
of delivering for our State. This is per-
haps one of the most important lessons 
of Senator Hutchinson, whom I served 
with here in the Senate and who is now 
our Ambassador to NATO. She would 
always make this point to Republicans 
and Democrats in the Texas delegation. 
She said: We may be Members of the 
House or Members of the Senate. We 
may be Republicans or Democrats. But 
we are Team Texas. 
I have been proud to continue that 
spirit and that effort. I am proud of the 
fact that in this election we increased 
the number of women elected to Con-
gress. At least 134 women will serve in 
the next Congress, with a record num-
ber of Republican women in the House 
of Representatives. For young women 
like my own daughters and younger 
girls, in particular, this representation 
is long overdue—just like Amy Coney 
Barrett, who was recently confirmed to 
the U.S. Supreme Court. What a won-
derful example and role model for 
young women and maybe not so young 
women—for all women—and for all of 
us. It is something we should celebrate. 
While we are still waiting to know 
which party will hold the majority 
here in the Senate—that will be deter-
mined on January 5 of 2021—it is clear 
that there was no blue wave that swept 
the country. 
My Republican colleagues and I in 
the Senate will continue to fight 
against ideological policies from the 
left, or so-called progressives, that 
were resoundingly rejected in this elec-
tion. We are not going to allow the 
Federal Government to tax Texas en-
ergy workers out of a job by imposing 
a carbon tax. We are not going to let 
them hamstring our police with unreal-
istic funding cuts or one-size-fits-all 
policies. And we are not going to allow 
them to pack the U.S. Supreme Court 
with political Justices intent on deliv-
ering results that couldn’t be achieved 
through the legislative process. And we 
are not going to let them reverse the 
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, increase taxes, 
which will only make it harder for 
working families to put food on their 
tables. 
Now, the Presiding Officer and I both 
participated in an organization called 
No Labels, and I am proud of the work 
I have done, regardless of the fact I am 
a Republican and he is a Republican. 
We both know—we all know—that you 
can’t get things done here in Congress 
by just working with people in your 
own political party. You have to work 
together. Indeed, I think that is the ge-
nius of our system. It forces us to work 
together if we want to get things done. 
I am proud of being consistently 
ranked as one of the most bipartisan 
Members of the Senate because I lit-
erally am willing to work with anyone, 
Republican or Democrat, who wants to 
make progress on the challenges that 
confront our Nation. 
This came up in a recent conversa-
tion we had during a hearing just a few 
minutes ago, talking about the lessons 
we have learned from the coronavirus 
in terms of the vulnerability of our 
supply chains, whether it is personal 
protective equipment that was over-
whelmingly made in China, which was 
threatened by the delay in reporting 
from China and the hoarding and, lit-
erally, the global rush to hoard PPE 
for their own countries and their own 
people. 
But another example of that that we 
have worked on in a bipartisan way— 
most recently, in the National Defense 
Authorization bill—was to build more 
high-end semiconductors here in the 
United States. In 2019, only 1 foundry 
was being built in the United States 
and 16 of them in China, and you can 
imagine, if we are dependent for our 
economy, for our national defense on a 
sophisticated semiconductor manufac-
tured in Taiwan, for example, that sup-
ply chain could be easily disrupted. So

S6637 
November 10, 2020 
I am proud of the fact that we did pass, 
in the Defense Authorization bill, an 
amendment 96 to 4 to begin the effort 
to reduce the vulnerability in our sup-
ply chain. That is an example of the 
kind of thing that I think we need to 
do more of and which I am proud to be 
a part of. 
Well, I know Republicans have a long 
list of priorities, just as our Demo-
cratic colleagues do, but we still have a 
couple of months before the end of this 
Congress, and we need to find a way to 
work together in the best interest of 
the American people. The lights don’t 
go out on the 116th Congress until Jan-
uary 3, which means we still have some 
time. 
I believe that over the last 2 years— 
notwithstanding what you hear in the 
media, which tends to focus on those 
narrow areas where we disagree the 
most and does not focus on the areas 
where we worked cooperatively to-
gether because they, by definition, 
don’t make news—we have actually ac-
complished a lot for the country, and I 
will have more to say about that in the 
coming days. 
For now, I want to talk about the 
biggest remaining item on our to-do 
list 
and, 
that 
is 
an 
additional 
coronavirus relief package. 
Texas has just hit the unenviable 
milestone 
of 
1 
million 
confirmed 
COVID–19 tests. More than 19,000 Tex-
ans have lost their lives due to this 
virus, and our healthcare providers in 
some parts of the State are still strug-
gling to keep up with the cases that 
end up going into the hospital. As we 
head into the winter months, experts 
are telling us that things will get 
worse before they get better. It is part 
of the seasonal impact of a virus like 
this. 
While we will continue to do our duty 
as individuals—wash our hands, mask 
when we can’t socially distance, and 
the things we have learned to do, such 
as to stay home if you are sick—it is 
clear we are not through with this 
virus yet, even though we were de-
lighted to hear some of the prospects 
for a vaccine in the not-too-distant fu-
ture. 
In the meantime, we still need to 
make sure that the assistance that we 
started in the first four bipartisan bills 
we passed, that we continue that as-
sistance both on the healthcare front 
and on the economic front until we 
fully recover. 
The researchers and scientists who 
have been developing a vaccine over 
the last months have been making tre-
mendous progress, and we need to in-
vest in their continued success. Once 
the vaccine is actually approved as safe 
and effective by the FDA, the logistics 
of getting it distributed across the 
country, prioritizing, I hope, the most 
vulnerable Americans—those in nurs-
ing homes and assisted living facilities 
and those with underlying chronic ill-
nesses—that is an enormous logistical 
challenge, and it is going to cost 
money. 
At the same time, we need to make 
sure that our economic recovery con-
tinues and that means we need to con-
tinue to safely reopen our economy, 
just as our school children and our col-
lege students have transitioned from a 
virtual educational experience back 
into the classroom slowly but surely. 
The unemployment rate in October 
dipped at 6.9 percent. Now, that is still 
a far cry from the 3.5 percent unem-
ployment we had before the virus hit, 
but it is the lowest we have seen since 
the pandemic began, and we need to 
make sure we don’t backslide into the 
double digits. 
Well, we know with the pendency of 
the election, after we passed the 
CARES Act in late March, we tried, I 
think it was, four times to pass a more 
targeted bill. We spent roughly $3.8 
trillion in the first four pieces of legis-
lation, and many of us—me included— 
felt like we needed to do more but on a 
targeted basis. The Speaker said, well, 
$3 trillion was her pricetag. We offered 
a half a trillion dollars in additional 
targeted relief, to which she replied, 
‘‘Nothing is better than something,’’ 
which made me do a double take. I al-
ways thought that something was bet-
ter than nothing, not ‘‘nothing was 
better than something.’’ 
Regardless of that, now that the elec-
tion, by and large—at least, certainly, 
for Congress—is behind us, we need to 
address those people who still need 
help. I hope our Democratic colleagues 
will join us and not force the country 
to wait 2 more months. There is too 
much on the line. 
So I want to conclude by thanking 
the people of my State for the oppor-
tunity to continue to fight for them 
here in the U.S. Senate, and now I am 
happy to get back to work with all of 
my colleagues to deal with this unfin-
ished business. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.

objection, it is so ordered.

REMEMBERING

AND

MICHAEL 
RUSH, 
JR., 
PASTOR 
LOTTIE 
MAE 
LEE-DAVIS, 
AND 
GLORIA IGNUDO CORROZI 
Mr. COONS. Mr. President, 2020 has 
been a difficult year for so many. We 
have lost far too many mothers and fa-
thers, sons and daughters, sisters and 
brothers, neighbors and friends. 
My own heart and the hearts of many 
in Delaware grew heavier this week as 
we said goodbye in Delaware to a whole 
series of friends, folks who had long 
been champions of our community, 
folks who were exactly the sort of peo-
ple who helped build and sustain com-
munity. 
I am grateful for the privilege of the 
floor to speak for a few minutes about 
the legacy of these lions of Delaware, 
these folks who were giants of service 
and who gave their hearts to us. 
On Monday, we said goodbye to 
Elaine and Wayne Manlove, who were 
loved by so many, and I rise first to 
pay tribute to them—some of the most 
special people I have ever known. 
They were killed in a tragic accident 
literally the day before last Tuesday’s 
election. On that day, we lost two of 
Delaware’s greatest diamonds, Mary 
‘‘Elaine’’ 
Manlove 
and 
Lambert 
‘‘Wayne’’ Manlove from Hockessin and 
Ocean View. It was always striking 
they went not by their first names but 
by their middle names. They were 
known as Elaine and Wayne Manlove. 
These are proud patriots, people dedi-
cated to our State and community who 
spent decades giving to others. 
Elaine I knew best in her role as 
State elections commissioner and as 
someone who fought hard here for 
funding for election security and elec-
tion systems. The very last time I saw 
her, she was proudly showing off the 
brandnew statewide election system in 
Delaware. She didn’t, tragically, get to 
see the fruits of her labor—the deploy-
ment of these new, state-of-the-art dig-
ital voting machines. Her many profes-
sional achievements in that role: in-
creasing our voter rolls, modernizing 
machines, bringing elections to the 
classrooms, carrying off just this last 
Tuesday a near flawless statewide elec-
tion. While impressive, it was just a 
very small part of who Elaine was. 
Deeply proud of her Irish heritage, 
known for her kindness and her gen-
erosity, her Irish Catholic faith that 
she and Wayne shared was a foundation 
for them and for their family and their 
lives. 
St. Patrick’s Day in Wilmington was 
often the highlight. Elaine was one of 
the folks who helped organize the an-
nual St. Patrick’s Day mass and break-
fast—a breakfast that raised money for 
the St. Patrick Center that serves 
some 
of 
the 
neediest 
and 
most 
marginalized in Wilmington but a 
breakfast that was a celebration of the 
intersection of faith, politics, service, 
hope, and community. 
My own wife Annie worked with 
Elaine for years in New Castle County 
government long before her time as the 
State elections commissioner, and they 
remained close for years afterward. 
Annie knew her as the best mom and 
grandmother and friend to so many 
people. 
Margaret Aitkin, one of Elaine’s clos-
est friends, who also served with her 
and my wife in county government, 
said: 
Elaine never sought the spotlight, and she 
never tried to be the center of attention—she 
was like a warm fire that you just gravitated 
towards. She wasn’t the life of the party; she 
was the reason for the party. 
Elaine had a special and giving spirit 
that had a lasting and transformative

difference 
on 
thousands 
of 
Dela-
wareans, from Kirkwood Soccer, to the 
county, to her work for elections, to 
her deep commitment to her faith, her 
family, and her community. 
Wayne, her husband of 51 years, was 
a union electrician, a proud member of 
IBEW Local 313 for 53 years. Wayne 
loved hosting neighborhood dinners, 
annual crab feasts, watching his be-
loved Eagles with family and friends, 
and confounding his son because he 
could never get his players straight. He 
loved sharing the Eagles with all three 
of his sons. 
For Wayne and Elaine, their sons, 
Matthew, Joe, and Michael, were the 
beginning, middle, and end. The Sun 
rose and set on their boys. They took 
huge delight in sharing stories about 
them with everyone who would sit still 
and listen. They did everything it took 
to put them through college and 
through parochial education. They sac-
rificed hugely for their children, and it 
made a lasting difference in their lives. 
Once Elaine and Wayne were your 
friends, they were always your friends. 
They brought together people from 
grade school, high school, from work, 
and from all different walks of life. 
They were strongly rooted in and con-
nected to St. Elizabeth’s parish, where 
Elaine was baptized, where they were 
married, and where they just last year 
renewed their vows for their 50th wed-
ding anniversary. On Monday, hun-
dreds of us gathered to wish them fare-
well. 
So my condolences, my deep and 
heartfelt condolences go out to Mat-
thew and Meghan, to Joe, to Michael 
and Mary, to Elaine’s brother Grant 
and wife Ruth, and their four grand-
children who gave them such joy: Cath-
erine, Elizabeth, Margaret, and Finn. 
I am turning now to consider another 
Delawarean and friend, someone I knew 
for decades who exemplified character, 
bravery, and integrity. Mike Rush—Ed-
ward Michael Rush, Jr., who passed 
away late last month in Bear, was 
someone who always rose to the tasks 
and challenges at hand—a Marine 
Corps veteran, a small business owner, 
a firefighter, a member of the Amer-
ican Legion, a stalwart of his parish, 
and a great friend. 
He 
was 
a 
proud 
graduate 
of 
Salesianum High School and Goldey- 
Beacom College and a proprietor and 
leader of a family-owned business, 
Rush Uniform. He started working 
there in 1963, and he helped build and 
lead his family-owned business for dec-
ades. 
I first really got to know Mike 
through the Better Business Bureau, 
where he and his family sponsored an 
award for ethical behavior by a family- 
owned business. He sponsored the Ed-
ward M. Rush, Sr. Memorial Award. 
Mike was also someone whose whole 
heart was in the fire service. The vol-
unteer fire service in Delaware is one 
of the backbones of communities up 
and down our State, and he was a life 
member of two volunteer fire compa-
nies. He was 50 years with Wilmington 
Manor, 33 years with Christiana, presi-
dent of the New Castle County Volun-
teer Fire Chiefs Association, president 
of the Delaware Valley Fire Chief’s As-
sociation, and then, ultimately, while I 
was county executive, president of the 
Delaware State Fire Chiefs Associa-
tion. 
Mike was also someone who did the 
hard work of being a fire school in-
structor for our State for 30 years. 
Mike did so much for so many others 
through his parish, through his fire 
company, through his training service, 
and through his service to our Nation 
in the military. He has earned acco-
lades for his decades of bravery and his 
commitment to our community. 
But more than anything, because I 
was not able to make it to his service, 
I wanted to share my condolences and 
the gratitude of our State and Nation 
for Mike’s wife of 45 years, Winnie; his 
sisters Barbara and Catherine; his chil-
dren Megan and Barbara; and his be-
loved grandson Seamus. 
Let me now turn to another anchor 
of another community in our State and 
offer greetings and condolences to the 
family and the beloved of Pastor Lottie 
Lee-Davis. She was an ordained min-
ister from the east side of Wilmington 
and a hallmark of resiliency and faith. 
She was a preacher’s daughter, a voice 
for the voiceless, and a beacon of hope 
for many. 
A friend, Alethea Smith-Tucker, told 
our Delaware News Journal that it was 
unending how many people Pastor 
Davis had touched and encouraged 
without judgment and without regard. 
She was the devoted pastor at Be 
Ready Jesus is Coming Church. She an-
swered the call to serve beyond the 
confines of the pulpit. She provided 
housing for single mothers and their 
children. She led efforts to renovate 
parks for the community, and she re-
cently garnered funding to build a 
mixed-use property just a block from 
her church to provide housing for those 
in need. 
Sadly, that which she launched, she 
will not get to see come to fruition in 
this life, but I am confident that Pas-
tor Davis will continue to inspire and 
engage and move the community of 
Wilmington, 
the 
congregation 
she 
helped lead, and the families who will 
benefit for years to come from her vi-
sion and her leadership of this project 
she just launched. Her legacy will con-
tinue to live through her work. 
I wanted to give my condolences to 
her husband Flalandas; to her daughter 
Amira; and to members of the con-
gregation, family, and friends. 
Last, but certainly not least, this 
past week we lost someone beloved to 
me and to so many in the Hockessin 
community, 
Gloria 
Ignudo 
Corrozi. 
Gloria was a mainstay of one of the 
landmark couples of our State for dec-
ades. 
Gloria spent 30 years working at Du-
Pont, and like so many of her genera-
tion who had a successful career at Du-
Pont, she also was engaged in lots and 
lots of other community activities, en-
gagements, and services. She spent a 
lot of her life also helping the Delaware 
Chapter of the American Diabetes As-
sociation. She served as cochair and 
raised tens of thousands of dollars year 
after year after year for this important 
cause. 
But, frankly, her great joy was her 
family. Her beloved husband of 55 
years, Philip Corrozi, was someone who 
was an incredible mentor and friend to 
me at work, at home, and in public 
service. Phil was an elected Repub-
lican, chairman of the Budget Com-
mittee, leader in our State general as-
sembly, and someone who, with Glo-
ria’s tireless affection and support, 
crafted lasting solutions for our State. 
Gloria was a blessing to an incredible 
network of friends and family, nieces 
and nephews, all of whom knew her as 
Aunt Gloria. I had the opportunity to 
get to know her best in the decade I 
spent working with Phil at a global 
manufacturing firm in Delaware. But 
Phil Corrozi, frankly, was someone 
who, when he gave his heart to a cause, 
Gloria was right alongside him and 
often pushing him. For a woman who 
never had children of her own, Gloria 
had so many people who knew her and 
thought of her as a second mother. 
My heart goes out to Gloria’s family 
and friends who, today, gathered at St. 
Anthony of Padua Church in Wil-
mington to say their final goodbyes to 
this gracious, kind, funny, giving, lov-
ing, powerful woman, whose witness 
was an important influence on my life, 
as well as so many others. 
These are just some of the individ-
uals our community has lost this year. 
Delaware is a State of neighbors, and 
we all feel these losses profoundly. 
There was a strong, common thread 
amongst those I have just honored and 
those who have been a gift to our 
State. I want to return to a powerful 
message that Joe, Wayne and Elaine 
Manlove’s son, gave in a eulogy just 
Monday at St. Elizabeth Church. It was 
funny; it was memorable; it was wide- 
ranging; it was personal; and it was 
touching. But at the conclusion, Joe 
said this. While today is sad and pain-
ful and so unexpected for all of us, I 
want to leave you with this thought: 
When you leave here today thinking of 
my parents and feeling the void in your 
life, do the following—join a civic com-
mittee, help organize your kids’ Little 
League, volunteer for something you 
care about, help a neighbor with a 
home project, and when some email 
comes out saying ‘‘We need people to 
help,’’ respond that you are in. Do all 
of it without a thought of compensa-
tion. Do it because it is the right thing 
to do. Do it because you want to im-
prove the world around you. Do it be-
cause there is nothing more powerful 
than the heart of a volunteer. 
That was them, Wayne and Elaine, 
but that was also Mike and Lottie and 
Gloria and so many other friends and 
neighbors who helped weave together

across different backgrounds, different 
political parties, and different places of 
origin and different communities—they 
weaved together a State of neighbors 
and left a lasting legacy. That legacy is 
that we love one another as we have 
been called to do. May we continue to 
be grateful for their legacies of service 
and live lives that would make them 
and their families proud. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. CASSIDY. Madam President, I

PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
MCSALLY). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
f 
HONORING OFFICER MARSHALL 
WATERS 
Mr. CASSIDY. Madam President, I 
am here today to pay tribute to three 
brave law enforcement officers in Lou-
isiana who were recently shot in the 
line of duty, and, sadly, one died. I 
begin with the man who died. 
While on duty, Mangham Police Offi-
cer Marshall Waters pulled over a sto-
len vehicle on October 17. He was shot 
by the person in the car, who fled the 
scene and eventually crashed the car. 
Officer Waters later died from that in-
jury on November 5. 
Mangham Police Chief Perry Flem-
ing says that Officer Waters was born a 
servant. He was a paramedic and pre-
viously served as a firefighter in near-
by Franklin Parish. 
Officer Waters’ death will be felt 
throughout 
Northeast 
Louisiana. 
Throughout his lifetime of service, he 
truly touched the hearts of many. His 
community honored him last night 
with a candlelight vigil. He will be laid 
to rest later this week. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO OFFICER TREVOR 
ABNEY 
Mr. CASSIDY. Madam President, I 
would also like to recognize New Orle-
ans Police Officer Trevor Abney, who 
was shot in the face and fortunately 
has survived. 
Officer Abney and Officer Brooke 
Duncan were on patrol in New Orleans 
on October 30. Without warning and for 
no reason, somebody walked by and 
shot through the window, striking Offi-
cer Abney in the face. He was taken to 
the hospital. He is said to be in good 
spirits, but, let’s face it, you get shot 
in the face, you have a road of recovery 
ahead of you. Officer Duncan received a 
graze wound during the encounter. For-
tunately, both officers are expected to 
do well. Again, the motive for the at-
tack remains unknown, and the sus-
pects are in custody. 
These attacks are tragic reminders of 
the danger that law enforcement offi-
cers face every day when they report 
for duty. They know it. They accept 
the risk. Their family accepts the risk. 
Their children accept the risk. Their 
spouse accepts the risk. They accept 
this risk because it serves our greater 
good. 
We owe a debt of gratitude to our law 
enforcement officers for their willing-
ness to put their lives on the line—even 
sacrificing it, as Officer Waters did—to 
keep us safe. 
I ask that all join in praying for Offi-
cer Waters’ family as they grieve his 
loss, and I ask you to join me in prayer 
for Officer Abney’s recovery. The road 
ahead will be difficult, but knowing 
that our country supports them during 
these partisan times can make the dif-
ference. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to

TRIBUTE TO ANDREA GHEZ, AND 
WOMEN IN SCIENCE 
Mr. 
DURBIN. 
Madam 
President, 
more, perhaps, than any event in our 
lifetimes, the COVID–19 pandemic has 
focused our minds on the life-and-death 
value of scientific research and dis-
covery. 
As the entire world waits anxiously 
for safe, effective, affordable vaccines 
and medical treatments that can pro-
tect us against this deadly virus, the 
recent 
announcements 
of 
the 
2020 
Nobel Prizes in science gives us reasons 
for hope. 
While the new Nobel science laure-
ates are not themselves involved in 
COVID–19 research, collectively, they 
have found answers to some of the 
most fundamental questions in science, 
they have made medical discoveries 
that have already saved millions of 
lives worldwide and may one day soon 
enable us to cure cancer and other 
deadly diseases. 
There is another reason to be hopeful 
about the 2020 Nobel science laureates. 
For only the second time in history, 
women scientists received two of the 
three Nobel science prizes, for physics 
and for chemistry. And for the first 
time ever, two women won a Nobel 
science award for research they pio-
neered on their own, without the help 
of male colleagues. Their achievements 
underscore why we need to continue 
clearing hurdles for women and girls as 
they navigate careers in science, tech-
nology, engineering, and math. We 
can’t afford to ignore the scientific po-
tential of half of our society. We need 
all hands on deck. 
Let me tell you about these new 
Nobel science laureates. 
The 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry 
goes 
to 
Jennifer 
Doudna 
and 
Emmanuelle 
Charpentier 
for 
their 
work on CRISPR-Cas9, a revolutionary 
advancement in biomedical science 
that enables scientists to edit and 
change DNA with high precision. 
Jennifer Doudna is an American bio-
chemist at the University of California, 
Berkeley, and Emmanuelle Charpentier 
is a French microchemist and director 
of the Max Planck Institute for Infec-
tion Biology in Berlin. They are the 
sixth and seventh women in history to 
receive the chemistry prize and the 
first all-women team to receive a Nobel 
in any science. 
In less than a decade since the pair 
wrote a paper demonstrating the power 
of CRISPR-Cas9, the technique has

transformed how basic science is done. 
Scientists are using CRISPR to ask 
fundamental questions about life, such 
as which genes are essential to a cell’s 
survival. Doctors are testing it as a 
cure for genetic conditions such as 
sickle 
cell 
disease 
and 
hereditary 
blindness, and plant scientists are 
using it to create new crops. 
People in my home State of Illinois 
are especially proud of Andrea Ghez, a 
2020 Nobel physics laureate who grew 
up in Chicago and was encouraged to 
pursue a career in science by a gifted 
teacher at the University of Chicago 
Laboratory School. 
Dr. Ghez, director of the UCLA Ga-
lactic Center Group, received the Nobel 
for her pioneering research on the 
supermassive black hole at the center 
of our galaxy. She describes her re-
search as ‘‘extreme astrophysics.’’ Her 
discoveries have enabled scientists to 
explore black holes and their funda-
mental role in the evolution of the uni-
verse. 
Dr. Ghez and her team conduct their 
research at the W.M. Keck Observatory 
in Hawaii. She is only the fourth 
woman to receive the physics prize. 
She shares half of the prize with 
Reinhard Genzel of UC Berkeley and 
the Max Planck Institute for Extra-
terrestrial Physics in Berlin. The other 
half of the prize was awarded to Roger 
Penrose of the University of Oxford. 
Dr. Ghez has earned numerous honors 
for her research, including election to 
the National Academy of Sciences and 
the American Academy of Arts and 
Sciences. In 2019, she was awarded an 
honorary degree by Oxford University. 
When she was a girl, she wanted to be 
the first woman to walk on the moon. 
She attributes her love of science part-
ly to a woman who taught her nearly 40 
years ago at the University of Chicago 
Laboratory School. Judith Keane was 
the only woman in the Lab School’s 
physical sciences department. Dr. Ghez 
has said how important it was for her 
to see a woman in that role. 
For much of history, women’s in-
volvement in science has been discour-
aged and their achievements have been 
ignored. Nevertheless, they have per-
sisted. A few examples: 
In 1903, Marie Curie became the first 
woman to win the Nobel Prize for 
Physics, for her discovery of radioac-
tivity. She won the Nobel Prize in 
Chemistry 8 years later for her work in 
isolating pure radium. She remains the 
only woman in history to ever win the 
Nobel twice and the only human to 
ever win a Nobel Prize in two different 
sciences. 
Rachel Carson was a marine biologist 
and 
environmentalist 
whose 
groundbreaking book, ‘‘Silent Spring,’’ 
helped launch the modern environ-
mental movement. 
Rosalind Franklin, a British chemist 
and molecular biologist, was one of the 
key figures behind unlocking the struc-
ture of human DNA, although her con-
tributions went largely unrecognized. 
Barbara McClintock was an Amer-
ican geneticist and the only woman 
ever to have been awarded the Nobel 
Prize for Medicine by herself. In 1993 
she won the the Nobel Prize for her dis-
covery of the ‘‘jumping gene’’ or the 
ability of genes to change position on 
the chromosome. 
Ruth Rogan Benerito was a chemist 
and pioneer in bioproducts who spent 
most of her career at the U.S. Depart-
ment of Agriculture. She is credited 
with saving the cotton industry in 
post-WWII America through her dis-
covery of a process to produce wrinkle- 
free, stain-free, and flame-resistant 
cotton fabrics. 
Navy Rear Admiral Grace Hopper 
first developed computer languages and 
a compiler to translate them into ma-
chine code. She developed computer 
languages written in English, rather 
than mathematical notation, including 
COBOL, which is still in use today. 
Katherine Johnson was an African- 
American mathematician and NASA 
space scientist who made enormous 
contributions to America’s space pro-
grams by her incorporation of com-
puting tools. She calculated key tra-
jectories for America’s first manned 
space flight and for the 1969 Apollo 11 
flight to the moon. 
Mae Jemison is a physician, chemist, 
biologist, and a former NASA astro-
naut. As a girl growing up on the South 
Side of Chicago, she was inspired to be-
come an astronaut after watching Star 
Trek’s Lt. Uhuru, the only Black 
woman aboard the Starship Enterprise. 
In 1992, she became the first Black 
woman to travel into space. 
Despite the achievements of these 
and other women, the tradition in 
science of excluding women and other 
underrepresented groups at prestigious 
scientific meetings and conferences is 
so pervasive that some scientists some-
times refer wryly to such panels as 
‘‘manels.’’ 
Dr. Francis Collins is director of the 
National Institutes of Health and a 
brilliant scientist. In June 2019, he an-
nounced that he would no longer speak 
at any science conference where women 
and other minority scientists were not 
included. He challenged other leaders 
in bioscience to do the same. Fortu-
nately, some are. More should. As I 
said, we need all hands on deck. 
I will close with this. About a week 
after the 2020 Nobel Prizes announce-
ments, the winner of the 2020 3M Young 
Scientist Challenge was announced. 
That is the Nation’s top science prize 
for middle schoolers. It carries a $25,000 
award. 
The winner this year is a 14-year-old 
Indian-American girl from Frisco, TX, 
Anika Chebrolu. Two years ago, she 
began studying the Spanish Influenza 
of 1918 that killed at least 50 million 
people worldwide. Last year, she came 
with a bad case of the seasonal flu her-
self and threw herself into finding a 
cure. She discovered a molecule that 
may lead to the development of a new 
antiviral drug to treat COVID. The 
molecule binds to the spiky protein of 
the novel coronavirus and inhibits the 
spread of the virus into human cells. 
Supporting the achievements of girls 
and women in STEM fields can help 
solve some of the greatest afflictions of 
our time and solve some of the deepest 
mysteries of our universe. It is a pro-
foundly wise investment. Congratula-
tions to the new women Nobel science 
laureates of 2020. May there be many 
more who follow in their footsteps.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION 
Australia—Javelin Missiles 
The Government of Australia has re-
quested to buy two hundred (200) Javelin 
FGM–148E missiles with U.S. Government 
technical assistance and other related ele-
ments of logistics and program support. The 
total estimated cost is not to exceed $46 mil-
lion. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy and national security objectives of 
the United States. Australia is one of our 
most important allies in the Western Pa-
cific. The strategic location of this political 
and economic power contributes signifi-
cantly to ensuring peace and economic sta-
bility in the region. 
The Australian Defence Force (ADF) is 
seeking to fill a short-term shortfall in its 
Javelin missile inventory in order to main-
tain the appropriate level of readiness. Aus-
tralia will not have any difficulty absorbing 
these missiles into its armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
These missiles will be provided from U.S. 
Army stocks. There are no known offsets as-
sociated with this sale. 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
not require the assignment of U.S. Govern-
ment or contractor representatives to Aus-
tralia. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale. 
TRANSMITTAL NO. 20–73 
Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of 
Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b) of the 
Arms Export Control Act 
Annex Item No. vii 
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The Javelin Weapon System is a me-
dium-range, 
man 
portable, 
shoulder- 
launched, fire-and-forget, anti-tank system 
for infantry, scouts, and combat engineers. 
It may also be mounted on a variety of plat-
forms 
including 
vehicles, 
aircraft 
and 
watercraft. The system weighs 49.5 pounds 
and has a maximum range in excess of 2,500 
meters. The system is highly lethal against 
tanks and other systems with conventional 
and reactive armors. The system possesses a 
secondary capability against bunkers. 
2. Javelin’s key technical feature is the use 
of fire-and-forget technology, which allows 
the gunner to fire and immediately relocate 
or take cover. Additional special features are 
the top attack and/or direct fire modes, an 
advanced tandem warhead and imaging in-
frared seeker, target lock-on before launch, 
and soft launch from enclosures or covered 
fighting positions. The Javelin missile also 
has a minimum smoke motor thus decreas-
ing its detection on the battlefield. 
3. The Javelin Weapon System is com-
prised of two major tactical components, 
which are a reusable Command Launch Unit 
(CLU) and a round contained in a disposable 
launch tube assembly. The CLU incorporates 
an integrated day-night sight that provides a 
target engagement capability in adverse 
weather and countermeasure environments. 
The CLU may also be used in a stand-alone 
mode for battlefield surveillance and target 
detection. The CLU’s thermal sight is a sec-
ond generation Forward Looking Infrared 
(FLIR) sensor. 
4. The missile is autonomously guided to 
the target using an imaging infrared seeker 
and adaptive correlation tracking algo-
rithms. This allows the gunner to take cover 
or reload and engage another target after fir-
ing a missile. The missile has an advanced 
tandem warhead and can be used in either 
the top attack or direct fire modes (for tar-
get undercover). An onboard flight computer 
guides the missile to the selected target. 
5. The Javelin Missile System hardware 
and the documentation are UNCLASSIFIED. 
6. If a technologically advanced adversary 
obtains knowledge of the specific hardware 
and software elements, the information 
could be used to develop countermeasures or 
equivalent systems that might reduce weap-
on system effectiveness or be used in the de-
velopment of a system with similar or ad-
vanced capabilities. 
7. A determination has been made that 
Australia can provide substantially the same 
degree of protection for the sensitive tech-
nology being released as the U.S. Govern-
ment. This proposed sale is necessary to fur-
ther the U.S. foreign policy and national se-
curity objectives outlined in the Policy Jus-
tification. 
8. All defense articles and services listed on 
this transmittal are authorized for release 
and export to the Government of Australia.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION 
Guyana—Bell 412EPi and 429 Helicopters 
The Government of Guyana has requested 
to buy two (2) Bell 412EPi Light Utility Heli-
copters with customer-unique modifications; 
two (2) Bell 429 Light Utility Helicopters 
with customer-unique modifications; two (2)

equipment; spares; publications; integrated 
product support; technical assistance; trans-
portation; Repair and Return; and other re-
lated elements of logistics and program sup-
port. The total estimated program cost is 
$256 million. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy and national security of the United 
States by helping to improve security of 
Guyana, which is expected to grow to be an 
important force for political stability and 
economic progress in South America. 
The proposed sale of the Bell 412EPi and 
429 helicopters will improve Guyana’s capa-
bility to meet current and future threats. 
Guyana will use the enhanced capability to 
strengthen its homeland defense; conduct 
maritime surveillance, patrol, and interdic-
tion; 
counter 
narcotic 
trafficking 
and 
transnational criminal organizations; deter 
regional threats; and support coalition part-
ners overseas. Guyana will have no difficulty 
absorbing this equipment into its armed 
forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region.

Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of 
Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(I) of the 
Arms Export Control Act 
Annex Item No. vii 
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The MQ–9B Remotely Piloted Aircraft 
(RPA) is a weapons-ready aircraft designed 
for 
Medium-Altitude 
Long-Endurance 
(MALE) Intelligence, Surveillance and Re-
connaissance (ISR), Target Acquisition, and 
Strike Missions. The MQ–9B RPA is not a 
USAF program of record but has close ties 
to, and builds upon, the proven success of the 
MQ–9A Reaper. The MQ–9B is a highly mod-
ular, easily configurable aircraft that con-
tains the necessary hard points, power, and 
data connections to accommodate a variety 
of payloads and munitions to meet multiple 
missions—including counter-land, counter- 
sea, and anti-submarine strike operations. 
The system is designed to be controlled by 
two operators within a Certifiable Ground 
Control Station (CGCS). The CGCS is de-
signed to emulate a reconnaissance aircraft 
cockpit, giving users extensive means to op-
erate both the aircraft and sensors. The MQ– 
9B is able to operate using a direct Line-of- 
Sight (LOS) datalink or Beyond Line-of- 
Sight (BLOS) through satellite communica-
tions (SA TCOM). The MQ–9B system can be 
deployed from a single site that supports 
launch/recovery, mission control, and main-
tenance. The system also supports remote- 
split operations where launch/recovery and 
maintenance occur at a Forward Operating 
Base and mission control is conducted from 
another location or Main Operating Base 
(MOB). 
2. The Ground Control Station (GCS) can 
be either fixed or mobile. The fixed GCS is 
enclosed in a customer-specified shelter. It 
incorporates workstations that allow opera-
tors to control and monitor the aircraft, as 
well as record and exploit downlinked pay-
load data. The mobile GCS allows operators 
to perform the same functions and is con-
tained on a mobile trailer. Workstations in 
either GCS can be tailored to meet customer 
requirements. 
3. The Embedded GPS-INS (EGI) with Se-
lective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module 
(SAASM) is a self-contained navigation sys-
tem that provides the following: accelera-
tion, velocity, position, attitude, platform 
azimuth, magnetic and true heading, alti-
tude, body angular rates, time tags and co-
ordinated universal time (UTC) synchronized 
time. SAASM enables the GPS receiver ac-
cess to the encrypted P(Y) signal providing 
protection against active spoofing attacks. 
4. The AN/DPX–7 is an Identification 
Friend or Foe (IFF) Transponder used to 
identify and track aircraft, ships, and some 
ground forces to reduce friendly fire inci-
dents. 
5. The MX–20 Multi-Spectral Targeting 
System is a multi-use highly advanced EO/IR 
sensor that provides long-range surveillance, 
high altitude, target acquisition, tracking, 
range finding, and laser designation for all 
NATO and tri-service laser guided muni-
tions, enabling precision-strike against a va-
riety of land and maritime targets. 
6. Sea Vue Maritime Multi-Role Patrol 
Radar is a synthetic aperture X-band radar 
that provides small-target maritime detec-
tion in high seas, maritime search (including 
submarine 
periscopes 
and 
semi- 
submersibles), radar imaging of ocean tar-
gets, and weather detection and avoidance. 
7. The SAGE 750 Electronic Surveillance 
Measures (ESM) System is a UK-produced 
digital electronic intelligence (ELINT) sen-
sor which analyzes the electromagnetic spec-
trum to map the source of active emissions. 
Using highly accurate Direction Finding 
(DF) antennas, SAGE builds target locations 
and provides situational awareness, advance 
warning of threats and the ability to cue 
other sensors. 
8. The C-Band Line-of-Sight (LOS) Ground 
Data Terminals and Ku-Band SA TCOM GA- 
ASI Transportable Earth Stations (GA TES) 
provide command, control, and data acquisi-
tion for the MQ–98. 
9. The Honeywell TPE–331–10–GD Turbo-
prop Engine is used in a variety of airborne 
platforms including the MQ–98. 
10. The M6000 UHF/VHF Radio is a multi- 
band, 
portable, 
two-way 
communication 
radio. 
11. The KIV–77 Mode 5 crypto applique 
computer for IFF is Type I certified by the 
National Security Agency and provides in-
formation assurance for Mode 5 IFF equip-
ment. The KIV- 77 is used to store the classi-
fied keys. 
12. The AN/APQ-IOC Simple Key Loader is 
a handheld fill device for securely receiving, 
storing, and transferring data between cryp-
tographic and communications equipment. 
13. The highest level of classification of in-
formation included in this potential sale is 
SECRET. 
14. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the hardware 
and software elements, the information 
could be used to develop countermeasures or 
equivalent systems, which might reduce sys-
tem effectiveness or be used in the develop-
ment of a system with similar or advanced 
capabilities. 
15. A determination has been made that 
the recipient can provide substantially the 
same degree of protection for the sensitive 
technology being released as the U.S. Gov-
ernment. This sale is necessary in further-
ance of the U.S. foreign policy and national 
security objectives outlined in the Policy 
Justification. 
16. All defense articles and services listed 
in this transmittal have been authorized for 
release and export to the recipient.

Bethesda, 
MD; 
Raytheon, Waltham, MA; L3Harris, Inc., 
Melbourne, FL; and Leonardo SpA, Rome, 
Italy. There are no known offset agreements 
proposed in connection with this potential 
sale. However, the purchaser typically re-
quests offsets. Any offset agreements will be 
defined in negotiations between the pur-
chaser and the contractor(s). 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
not require the assignment of any additional 
U.S. Government or contractor representa-
tives outside the United States. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale. 
TRANSMITTAL NO. 21–05 
Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of 
Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the 
Arms Export Control Act 
Annex Item No. vii 
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The MQ–9B Remotely Piloted Aircraft 
(RPA) is a weapons-ready aircraft designed 
for 
Medium-Altitude 
Long-Endurance 
(MALE) Intelligence, Surveillance and Re-
connaissance (ISR), Target Acquisition, and 
Strike Missions. The MQ–9B RPA is not a 
U.S. Air Force program of record but has 
close ties to, and builds upon, the proven 
success of the MQ–9A Reaper. The MQ–9B is 
a highly modular, easily configurable air-
craft that contains the necessary hard 
points, power, and data connections to ac-
commodate a variety of payloads and muni-
tions to meet multiple missions, including 
counter-land, 
counter-sea, 
and 
antisub-
marine strike operations. The system is de-
signed to be controlled by two operators 
within a Certifiable Ground Control Station 
(CGCS). The CGCS is designed to emulate a 
reconnaissance aircraft cockpit, giving users 
extensive means to operate both the aircraft 
and sensors. The MQ–9B is able to operate 
using a direct Line-of-Sight (LOS) datalink 
or Beyond Line-of-Sight (BLOS) through sat-
ellite communications (SATCOM). The MQ– 
9B system can be deployed from a single site 
that supports launch/recovery, mission con-
trol, and maintenance. The system also sup-
ports remote-split operations where launch/ 
recovery and maintenance occur at a For-
ward Operating Base (FOB) and mission con-
trol is conducted from another location or 
Main Operating Base (MOB). 
2. The Ground Control Station (GCS) can 
be either fixed or mobile. The fixed GCS is 
enclosed in a customer-specified shelter. It 
incorporates workstations that allow opera-
tors to control and monitor the aircraft, as 
well as record and exploit downlinked pay-
load data. The mobile GCS allows operators 
to perform the same functions and is con-
tained on a mobile trailer. Workstations in 
either GCS can be tailored to meet customer 
requirements. 
3. The SAGE 750 Electronic Surveillance 
Measures (ESM) System is a United King-
dom-produced digital electronic intelligence 
(ELINT) sensor that analyzes the electro-
magnetic spectrum to map the source of ac-
tive emissions. Using highly accurate Direc-
tion Finding (DF) antennas, SAGE builds 
target locations and provides situational 
awareness, advance warning of threats, and 
the ability to cue other sensors. 
4. The Raytheon Multi-Spectral Targeting 
Systems-D (MTS–D) EO/IR sensors is a 
multispectral Targeting System with Laser 
Target 
Designator 
(LTD). 
A 
multi-use 
Electro Optical (EO)/Infrared (IR) sensor pro-
vides long-range surveillance, high-altitude 
target acquisition, tracking, range-finding, 
and laser designation for all tri-service and 
NATO laser-guided munitions, with capabili-
ties up to and including high definition color 
TV, high definition short-wave IR, medium- 
wave IR, and long-wave IR sensors. The AN/ 
DAS–4 is an evolutionary upgrade to the cur-
rent AN/DAS–1 system. 
5. The Lynx AN/APY–8 Synthetic Aperture 
Radars (SAR) with Ground Moving Target 
Indicator (GTMI) System provides all-weath-
er surveillance, tracking, and targeting for 
military and commercial customers from 
manned and unmanned vehicles. 
6. The KOR–24A Small Tactical Terminal 
Link–16 is a command, control communica-
tions, and intelligence (C3I) system incor-
porating high-capacity, jam-resistant, dig-
ital communication links for exchange of 
near real-time tactical information, includ-
ing both data and voice, among air, ground, 
and sea elements. 
7. The L3 Harris RIOTM Communications 
Intelligence System incorporates radio re-
ceivers and flexible digital processing to cre-
ate the ability to intercept, location, and 
copy adversary communications. The system 
is flexible enough that it can detect a wide 
variety of types of communications. The 
open design allows the system to be up-
graded with new software features as adver-
sary communications change. 
8. The Embedded GPS–INS (EGI) with Se-
lective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module 
(SAASM) is a self-contained navigation sys-
tem that provides the following: accelera-
tion, velocity, position, attitude, platform 
azimuth, magnetic and true heading, alti-
tude, body angular rates, time tags, and co-
ordinated universal time (UTC) synchronized 
time. SAASM enables the GPS receiver ac-
cess to the encrypted P(Y) signal providing 
protection against active spoofing attacks. 
9. The AN/DPX–7 is an Identification 
Friend or Foe (IFF) Transponder used to

identify and track aircraft, ships, and some 
ground forces to reduce friendly fire inci-
dents. 
10. Leonardo SeaSpray Maritime Multi- 
Role Patrol Radar is a synthetic aperture X- 
band radar that provides small-target mari-
time detection in high seas, maritime search 
(including submarine periscopes and semi- 
submersibles), radar imaging of ocean tar-
gets, and weather detection and avoidance. 
11. The C-Band Line-of-Sight (LOS) Ground 
Data Terminals and Ku-Band SATCOM GA– 
ASI Transportable Earth Stations (GATES) 
provide command, control, and data acquisi-
tion for the MQ–9B. 
12. The KY–1OOM is a lightweight terminal 
for secure voice and data communications. 
The 
KY–1OOM 
provides 
wideband/ 
narrowband half-duplex communication. Op-
erating in tactical ground, marine and air-
borne applications, the KY–1OOM enables se-
cure communication with a broad range of 
radio and satellite equipment. 
13. The Honeywell TPE–331–10–GD Turbo-
prop Engine is used in a variety of airborne 
platforms, including the MQ–9B. 
14. The Rohde & Schwartz UHF/VHF Radio 
is a multi-band, portable, two-way commu-
nication radio. 
15. The KIV–77 Mode 5 crypto applique 
computer for IFF is Type 1 certified by the 
National Security Agency and provides in-
formation assurance for both legacy Mode 4 
and new Mode 5 IFF equipment. The KIV–77 
is used to store the classified keys. 
16. The AN/APQ–1OC Simple Key Loader is 
a handheld fill device for securely receiving, 
storing, and transferring data between cryp-
tographic and communications equipment. 
17. The Joint Direct Attack Munitions 
(JDAM) is a guidance set that converts exist-
ing unguided bombs (MK–82, MK–83, MK–84, 
BLU–109, BLU–110, BLU–111, BLU–117, BLU– 
126 (Navy) or BLU–129 warhead) into an accu-
rate, adverse weather ‘‘smart’’ munition. 
The Guidance Set consists of a Tail Kit, 
which contains the Inertial Navigation Sys-
tem (INS) and a Global Positioning System 
(GPS), and a set of Aerosurfaces and an um-
bilical Cover, which allows the JDAM to im-
prove the accuracy of unguided, general pur-
pose bombs. The Guidance Set, when com-
bined with a warhead and appropriate fuze, 
forms a JDAM Guided Bomb Unit (GBU). The 
JDAM Guidance Set gives these bombs ad-
verse weather capability with improved ac-
curacy. The JDAM weapon can be delivered 
from modest standoff ranges at high or low 
altitudes against a variety of land and sur-
face targets during the day or night. After 
release, JDAM autonomously guides to a tar-
get, using the resident GPS-aided INS guid-
ance system. The JDAM is capable of receiv-
ing target coordinates via preplanned mis-
sion data from the delivery aircraft, by on-
board aircraft sensors (i.e., FLIR, Radar, 
etc.) during captive carry, or from a third- 
party source via manual or automated air-
crew cockpit entry. 
a. The KMU–572 is the guidance set for a 
GBU–38 (500-pound) JDAM. 
18. The Laser JDAM (GBU–54) converts ex-
isting unguided free-fall bombs into preci-
sion guided ‘‘smart’’ munitions by adding a 
new tail section containing Inertial Naviga-
tion System (INS) guidance/Global Posi-
tioning System (GPS) guidance, as well as 
adds a semi-active laser seeker. This allows 
the weapon to strike targets moving at up to 
70 mph. The LJDAM weapon consists of a 
DSU–38 sensor, a warhead-specific JDAM 
guidance set installed on the bomb body, and 
a fuze. 
19. MK–82 Inert General Purpose (GP) bomb 
is a 500-pound, free-fall, unguided, low-drag 
inert weapon used for integration testing. 
There is no explosive fill. 
20. GBU–12/58 Paveway II (PW–II) 500-pound 
(GBU–12) and 250-pound (GBU–58) are maneu-
verable, free-fall, laser-guided bombs (LGBs) 
that guides to reflected laser energy from 
the desired target. Employment of the LGB 
is the same as a normal general purpose (GP) 
warhead, except the semi-active guidance 
corrects for employment errors inherent in 
any delivery system. Laser designation for 
the weapon can be provided by a variety of 
laser target markers or designators from the 
air or ground. The Paveway system consists 
of a laser guidance kit, a computer control 
group (CCG), a warhead-specific Air Foil 
Group (AFG) that attach to the nose and tail 
of MK–81 and MK–82 General Purpose (GP) 
bombs, and a fuze. The weapon is primarily 
used for precision bombing against non-hard-
ened targets. 
a. The MAU–169 or the MAU–209 are the 
CCG for the GBU–12 and GBU–58. 
b. The MXU–650 is the AFG for the 500- 
pound GBU–12. 
c. MXU–1006/B is the AFG for the 250-pound 
GBU–58. 
21. AGM–114–R2 Hellfire II Semi-Active 
Laser (SAL) Missiles are rail-launched guid-
ed missiles developed and produced by Lock-
heed Martin. The guidance system employs a 
SAL seeker. The SAL missile homes in on 
the laser energy reflected off a target that 
has been illuminated by a laser designator. 
The laser can be on either the launch plat-
form or another platform that can be sepa-
rated from it by several kilometers. The tar-
get sets are armor, bunkers, caves, enclo-
sures, boats, and enemy personnel. The 
AGM–114–R2 Hellfire II missiles use pulse- 
coded laser illumination. The R2 variant in-
cludes a Height-of-Burst (HOB)/proximity 
sensor. The AGM–114 R2 missiles each have a 
multi-purpose selectable warhead and iner-
tial measurement unit (IMU)-Aided Trajec-
tories. 
22. The GBU–39 Small Diameter Bomb In-
crement 1 (SDB–1) is a 250-pound, GPS-aided 
inertial navigation system, small autono-
mous, day or night, adverse weather, conven-
tional, air-to-ground precision glide weapon 
able to strike fixed and stationary re- 
locatable non-hardened targets from standoff 
ranges. It is intended to provide aircraft 
with an ability to carry a high number of 
bombs. Aircraft are able to carry four SDBs 
in place of one 2,000-pound bomb. 
a. SDB I Guided Test Vehicle (GTV) is an 
SDB II configuration used for land or sea 
range-based testing of the SDB I weapon sys-
tem. The GTV has common flight character-
istics of an SDB I All Up Round (AUR), but 
in place of the multi-effects warhead is a 
Flight Termination, Tracking, and Telem-
etry (FTTT) subassembly that mirrors the 
AUR multi-effects warhead’s size and mass 
properties, yet provides safe flight termi-
nation, free flight tracking, and telemetry of 
encrypted data from the GTV to the data re-
ceivers. The SDB I GTV can have either 
inert or live fuses. All other flight control, 
guidance, data-link, and seeker functions are 
representative of the SDB I AUR. 
23. The Joint Programmable Fuze (JPF) 
FMU–139 is a multi-delay, multi-arm and 
proximity sensor compatible with general 
purpose blast, frag, and hardened-target pen-
etrator weapons. The JPF settings are cock-
pit selectable in flight when used numerous 
precision-guided weapons. It can interface 
with numerous weapons including GBU–12, 
GBU–58, GBU–54, and GBU–38. 
24. The highest level of classification of de-
fense articles, components, and services in-
cluded in this potential sale is SECRET. 
25. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the specific 
hardware and software elements, the infor-
mation could be used to develop counter-
measures that might reduce weapon system 
effectiveness or be used in the development 
of a system with similar or advanced capa-
bilities. 
26. A determination has been made that 
the United Arab Emirates can provide sub-
stantially the same degree of protection for 
the sensitive technology being released as 
the U.S. Government. This sale is necessary 
in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and 
national security objectives outlined in the 
Policy Justification. 
27. All defense articles and services listed 
in this transmittal are authorized for release 
and export to the Government of the United 
Arab Emirates.

Annex Item No. vii 
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The AIM–120C–7/C–8 Advanced Medium 
Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) is a su-
personic, air launched, aerial intercept, guid-
ed missile featuring digital technology and 
micro-miniature solid-state electronics. The 
potential sale will include AMRAAM Guid-
ance Sections. AMRAAM capabilities include 
look-down/shoot-down, 
multiple 
launches 
against multiple targets, resistance to elec-
tronic countermeasures, and interception of 
high- and low-flying and maneuvering tar-
gets. The AIM–120C–8 is a form, fit, function 
refresh of the AIM–120C–7 and is the next 
generation to be produced. 
2. The AMRAAM NDI–Airborne Instru-
mented Unit (AIU) telemetry set replaces 
the missile’s warhead, thus allowing for se-
cured telemetered test shots. The NDI-AIU 
telemetry set is non-exportable and will re-
main under the control of the U.S. Govern-
ment or U.S. Defense Contractor. 
3. The MK–82 General Purpose (GP) bomb 
is a 500 pound, free-fall, unguided, low-drag 
weapon. The MK–82 is designed for soft, frag-
ment-sensitive targets and is not intended 
for hard targets or penetrations. The explo-
sive filling is usually tritonal, though other 
compositions have sometimes been used. 
4. MK–82 Inert General Purpose (GP) bomb 
is a 500 pound, free-fall, unguided, low-drag 
inert weapon used for integration testing. 
There is no explosive fill. 
5. The MK–83 General Purpose (GP) bomb 
is a 1,000 pound, free-fall, unguided, low-drag 
weapon. The MK–83 is designed for soft, frag-
ment-sensitive targets and is not intended 
for hard targets or penetrations. The explo-
sive filling is usually tritonal, though other 
compositions have sometimes been used. 
6. The MK–84 General Purpose (GP) bomb 
is a 2,000 pound, free-fall, unguided, low-drag 
weapon. The MK–84 is designed for soft, frag-
ment sensitive targets and is not intended 
for hard targets or penetrations. The explo-
sive filling is usually tritonal, though other 
compositions have sometimes been used. 
7. The GBU–39 Small Diameter Bomb In-
crement 1 (SDB–1) is a 250-pound, GPS-aided 
inertial navigation system, small autono-
mous, day or night, adverse weather, conven-
tional, air-to-ground precision glide weapon 
able to strike fixed and stationary re- 
locatable non-hardened targets from standoff 
ranges. It is intended to provide aircraft 
with an ability to carry a high number of 
bombs. Aircraft are able to carry four SDBs 
in place of one 2,000-pound bomb. 
8. The Joint Direct Attack Munitions 
(JDAM) is a guidance set which converts ex-
isting unguided bombs (MK–82, MK–83, MK– 
84, BLU–109, BLU–110, BLU–111, BLU–117, 
BLU–126 (Navy) or BLU–129 warhead) into an 
accurate, adverse weather ‘‘smart’’ muni-
tion. The Guidance Set consists of a Tail Kit,

which contains the Inertial Navigation Sys-
tem (INS) and a Global Positioning System 
(GPS), a set of Aerosurfaces and an umbilical 
cover, which allows the JDAM to improve 
the accuracy of unguided, General Purpose 
bombs. The JDAM weapon can be delivered 
from modest standoff ranges at high or low 
altitudes against a variety of land and sur-
face targets during the day or night. JDAM 
is capable of receiving target coordinates via 
preplanned mission data from the delivery 
aircraft, by onboard aircraft sensors (i.e., 
FLIR, Radar, etc.) during captive carry, or 
from a third-party source via manual or 
automated aircrew cockpit entry. The Guid-
ance Set, when combined with a warhead and 
appropriate fuze, forms a JDAM Guided 
Bomb Unit (GBU). 
a. (U) The KMU–572F/B is the tailkit for a 
GBU–38 500LB JDAM. 
b. (U) The KMU–559B/B is the tailkit for a 
GBU–32 1000LB JDAM. 
c. (U) The KMU–556B/B is the tailkit for a 
GBU–31 2000LB JDAM. 
9. The Laser JDAM (GBU–54) converts ex-
isting unguided free-fall bombs into preci-
sion-guided ‘‘smart’’ munitions by adding a 
new tail section containing Inertial Naviga-
tion System (INS) guidance/Global Posi-
tioning System (GPS) guidance and adds a 
semi-active laser seeker. This allows the 
weapon to strike targets moving at up to 70 
mph. The LJDAM weapon consists of a DSU– 
38 sensor, a JDAM guidance set installed on 
the bomb body, and a fuze. The DSU–38 con-
sists of a laser spot tracker (same size and 
shape as a DSU–33 proximity fuze), a cable 
connecting the DSU–38 to the basic JDAM 
guidance set, a cable cover, cable cover tie- 
down straps, modified tail kit door and wir-
ing harness, and associated modified JDAM 
software that incorporates navigation and 
guidance flight software to support both 
LJDAM and standard JDAM missions. 
10. The Joint Programmable Fuze (JPF) 
FMU–139 is a multi-delay, multi-arm and 
proximity sensor compatible with general 
purpose blast, frag and hardened-target pene-
trator weapons. The JPF settings are cock-
pit selectable in flight when used numerous 
precision-guided weapons. It can interface 
with the following weapons: GBU–31, GBU–32, 
GBU–38, and GBU–54. 
11. The AGM–154 JSOW is used by the U.S. 
Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S. Air Force, 
and allows aircraft to attack well-defended 
targets in day, night, and adverse weather 
conditions. The AGM–154C carries a BROACH 
warhead. The BROACH warhead incorporates 
an advanced multi stage warhead. The JSOW 
uses the GPS Precise Positioning System 
(PPS), which provides for a more accurate 
capability than the commercial version of 
GPS. 
12. The JSOW–C utilizes GPS/INS guidance 
and an uncooled imaging infrared seeker for 
terminal guidance, Autonomous Acquisition, 
and provides a precision targeting, 500- 
pound-class tandem warhead that is the U.S. 
Navy’s primary standoff weapon against 
hardened targets. 
13. The AGM–154E JSOW–ER adds an en-
gine, and supporting components, to the 
JSOW C Airframe. The JSOW–ER uses the 
300-pound Maverick Warhead due to its 
smaller size, thereby creating room for fuel, 
but maintains the same penetration capa-
bility as the JSOW C. 
14. The AGM–88E Advanced Anti-Radiation 
Guided Missile (AARGM) weapon system is 
an air-to-ground missile intended for Sup-
pression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) and 
Destruction of Enemy Air Defenses (DEAD) 
missions. The AARGM provides suppression 
or destruction of enemy RADAR and denies 
the enemy the use of air defense systems, 
thereby improving the survivability of tac-
tical aircraft. 
15. The highest level of classification of de-
fense articles, components, and services in-
cluded in this potential sale is SECRET. 
16. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the specific 
hardware and software elements, the infor-
mation could be used to develop counter-
measures that might reduce weapon system 
effectiveness or be used in the development 
of a system with similar or advanced capa-
bilities. 
17. A determination has been made that 
the UAE can provide substantially the same 
degree of protection for the sensitive tech-
nology being released as the U.S. Govern-
ment. This sale is necessary in furtherance 
of the U.S. foreign policy and national secu-
rity objectives outlined in the Policy Jus-
tification. 
18. All defense articles and services listed 
in this transmittal have been authorized for 
release and export to the Government of the 
United Arab Emirates.

Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of 
Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the 
Arms Export Control Act 
Annex Item No. vii 
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The F–35A Conventional Take Off and 
Landing {CTOL) aircraft is a single-seat, sin-
gle engine, all-weather, stealth, fifth-genera-
tion, multirole aircraft. The F–35A contain 
sensitive technology, including the low ob-
servable airframe/outer mold line, the Pratt 
& Whitney F135 engine, AN/APG–81 radar, an 
integrated core processor central computer, 
a mission systems/electronic warfare suite, a 
multiple sensor suite, technical data/docu-
mentation, and associated software. Sen-
sitive elements of the F35A are also included 
in operational flight and maintenance train-
ers. Sensitive elements of the F–35A CTOL 
aircraft include hardware, accessories, com-
ponents, and associated software for the fol-
lowing major subsystems: 
a. The Pratt and Whitney F 135 engine is a 
single 40,000-pound thrust class engine de-
signed for the F–35 and assures highly reli-
able, affordable performance. The engine is 
designed to be utilized in all F–35 variants, 
providing 
unmatched 
commonality 
and 
supportability throughout the worldwide 
base of F–35 users. 
b. The AN/APG–81 Active Electronically 
Scanned Array (AESA) is a high processing 
power/high transmission power electronic 
array capable of detecting air and ground 
targets from a greater distance than me-
chanically scanned array radars. It also con-
tains a synthetic aperture radar (SAR), 
which creates high-resolution ground maps 
and provides weather data to the pilot, and 
provides air and ground tracks to the mis-
sion system, which uses it as a component to 
fuse sensor data. 
c. The Electro-Optical Targeting System 
(EOTS) provides long-range detection and 
tracking, as well as an infrared search and 
track (IRST) and forward-looking infrared 
(FLIR) capability for precision tracking, 
weapons delivery, and bomb damage assess-
ment (BOA). The EOTS replaces multiple 
separate internal or podded systems typi-
cally found on legacy aircraft. 
d. The Electro-Optical Distributed Aper-
ture System (EODAS) provides the pilot with 
full spherical coverage for air-to-air and air- 
to-ground threat awareness, day/night vision 
enhancements, a fire control capability, and 
precision tracking of wingmen/friendly air-
craft. The EODAS provides data directly to 
the pilot’s helmet as well as the mission sys-
tem. 
e. The Electronic Warfare (EW) system is a 
reprogrammable, integrated system that 
provides radar warning and electronic sup-
port measures (ESM), along with a fully in-
tegrated countermeasures (CM) system. The 
EW system is the primary subsystem used to 
enhance situational awareness, targeting 
support and self-defense through the search, 
intercept, location and identification of in- 
band emitters and to automatically counter 
infrared (IR) and radio frequency (RF) 
threats. 
f. The Command, Control, Communica-
tions, Computers and Intelligence/Commu-
nications, Navigation, and Identification 
(C4I/CNI) system provides the pilot with un-
matched connectivity to flight members, co-
alition forces, and the battlefield. It is an in-
tegrated subsystem designed to provide a 
broad spectrum of secure, anti-jam voice and 
data communications, precision radio navi-
gation and landing capability, self-identi-
fication, beyond visual range target identi-
fication, 
and 
connectivity 
to 
off-board 
sources of information. It also includes an 
inertial navigation and global positioning 
system (GPS) for precise location informa-
tion. The functionality is tightly integrated 
within the mission system to enhance effi-
ciency. 
g. The aircraft C4I/CNI system includes 
two data links, the Multi-Function Advanced 
Data Link (MADL) and Link 16. The MADL 
is designed specifically for the F–35 and al-
lows for stealthy communications between 
F–35s. Link 16 data link equipment allows 
the F–35 to communicate with legacy air-
craft using widely-distributed J-series mes-
sage protocols. 
h. The F–35 Autonomic Logistics Global 
Sustainment (ALGS) provides a fully inte-
grated logistics management solution. ALGS 
integrates a number of functional areas, in-
cluding supply chain management, repair, 
support equipment, engine support, and 
training. The ALGS infrastructure employs 
a state-of-the-art information system that 
provides real-time, decision-worthy informa-
tion for sustainment decisions by flight line 
personnel. 
Prognostic 
health 
monitoring 
technology is integrated with the air system 
and is crucial to predictive maintenance of 
vital components. 
i. The F–35 Operational Data Integrated 
Network (ODIN) provides an intelligent in-
formation infrastructure that binds all the 
key concepts of ALGS into an effective sup-
port system. ODIN establishes the appro-
priate interfaces among the F–35 Air Vehicle, 
the warfighter, the training system, govern-
ment information technology (IT) systems, 
and supporting commercial enterprise sys-
tems. Additionally, ODIN provides a com-
prehensive tool for data collection and anal-
ysis, decision support and action tracking. 
j. The F–35 Training System includes sev-
eral training devices to provide integrated 
training for pilots and maintainers. The 
pilot training devices include a Full Mission 
Simulator (FMS) and Mission Rehearsal 
Trainer (MRT). The maintainer training de-
vices include an Aircraft Systems Mainte-
nance Trainer (ASMT), Ejection System 
Maintenance Trainer (ESMT), Outer Mold 
Line (OML) Lab, Flexible Linear Shaped 
Charge (FLSC) Trainer, F135 Engine Module 
Trainer, Weapons Loading Trainer (WLT), 
and other training devices. The F–35 Train-
ing System can be integrated, where both pi-
lots and maintainers learn in the same Inte-
grated Training Center (ITC). 
k. Other subsystems, features, and capa-
bilities include the F–35’s low observable air 
frame, Integrated Core Processor (ICP) Cen-
tral Computer, Helmet Mounted Display Sys-
tem (HMDS), Pilot Life Support System 
(PLSS), Mission Planning System Environ-
ment (MPSE), and publications/maintenance 
manuals. The HMDS provides a fully sun-
light readable, bi-ocular display presentation 
of aircraft information projected onto the pi-
lot’s helmet visor. The use of a night vision 
camera integrated into the helmet elimi-
nates the need for separate Night Vision 
Goggles. The PLSS provides a measure of 
Pilot Chemical, Biological, and Radiological 
Protection through use of an On-Board Oxy-
gen Generating System (OBOGS) and an es-
cape system that provides additional protec-
tion to the pilot. OBOGS takes the Power 
and Thermal Management System (PTMS) 
air and enriches it by removing gases (main-
ly nitrogen) by adsorption, thereby increas-
ing the concentration of oxygen in the prod-
uct gas and supplying breathable air to the 
pilot. The MPSE provides a mission plan-
ning, mission briefing, and a maintenance/in-
telligence/tactical debriefing platform for 
the F–35. 
2. The Reprogramming Center is located in 
the United States and provides F–35 cus-
tomers a means to update F–35 electronic 
warfare databases. 
3. The highest level of classification of de-
fense articles, components, and services in-
cluded in this potential sale is SECRET. 
4. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the specific 
hardware and software elements, the infor-
mation could be used to develop counter-
measures that might reduce weapon system 
effectiveness or be used in the development 
of a system with similar or advanced capa-
bilities. 
5. A determination has been made that the 
United Arab Emirates can provide substan-
tially the same degree of protection for the 
sensitive technology being released as the 
U.S. Government. This sale is necessary in 
furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and 
national security objectives outlined in the 
Policy Justification. 
6. All defense articles and services listed in 
this transmittal are authorized for release 
and export to the Government of the United 
Arab Emirates.

Hon. JAMES E. RISCH, 
Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations, 
U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. 
DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: Pursuant to the re-
porting requirements of Section 36(b)(5)(C) of 
the Arms Export Control Act (AECA), as 
amended, we are forwarding Transmittal No. 
21–0A. This notification relates to enhance-
ments or upgrades from the level of sensi-
tivity of technology or capability described 
in the Section 36(b)(l) AECA certification 17– 
20 of March 7, 2018. 
Sincerely, 
HEIDI H. GRANT, 
Director. 
Enclosures. 
TRANSMITTAL NO. 21–0A 
Report of Enhancement or Upgrade of Sensi-
tivity of Technology or Capability (Sec. 
36(b)(5)(C), AECA) 
(i) Purchaser: Government of the United 
Arab Emirates. 
(ii) Sec. 36(b)(l), AECA Transmittal No.: 17– 
20. 
Date: March 7, 2018. 
Military Department: Navy. 
(iii) Description: On March 7, 2018, Con-
gress was notified by Congressional certifi-
cation transmittal number 17–20 of the pos-
sible sale under Section 36(b)(l) of the Arms 
Export Control Act of three hundred (300) 
AIM–9X–2 Sidewinder Block II All-Up-Round 
Missiles; forty (40) AIM–9X–2 Sidewinder 
Captive Air Training Missiles (CATMs); thir-
ty (30) AIM–9X–2 Block II Tactical Guidance 
Units; fifteen (15) AIM–9X–2 CATM Units; 
containers; spares; support equipment and 
missile support; U.S. Government and con-
tractor technical assistance and other re-
lated logistics support; and other associated 
support equipment and services. The esti-
mated cost was $270.4 million. Major Defense 
Equipment (MDE) constituted $240 million of 
this total. 
This transmittal reports the addition of 
five hundred (500) Sidewinder AIM 9X Block 
II+ (Plus) Tactical Missiles; forty (40) Side-
winder AIM 9X Block II Captive Air Training 
Missiles (CATMs); three (3) Sidewinder AIM 
9X Block II Special Air Training Missiles 
(NATMS); fifty (50) Sidewinder AIM 9X 
Block II+ (Plus) Tactical Guidance Units; 
twenty-five (25) Sidewinder AIM 9X Block II 
CATM Guidance Units; containers; spares; 
support equipment and missile support; U.S. 
Government and contractor technical assist-
ance and other related logistics support; and 
other associated support equipment and 
services with a value of $490 million. The 
total notified cost of MDE will increase to 
$730 million, and the total notified case value 
will increase to $840.5 million. 
(iv) Significance: This notification is being 
provided to report the inclusion of MDE 
items not previously notified. This potential 
sale will improve the UAE’s capability to 
meet current and future threats and provide 
greater security for its critical infrastruc-
ture. The addition of the Sidewinder AIM 9X 
Block II+ (Plus) Tactical Missiles represents 
an increase in capability over what was pre-
viously notified. The UAE will use the en-
hanced capability to strengthen its home-
land defense. 
(v) Justification: This proposed sale of the 
Sidewinder AIM 9X Block II+ (Plus) Tactical 
Missile will support the foreign policy and 
national security of the United States by 
helping to improve the security of an impor-
tant regional partner. The UAE has been, 
and continues to be, a vital U.S. partner for 
political stability and economic progress in 
the Middle East. 
(vi) Sensitivity of Technology: The Side-
winder AIM 9X Block II+ (Plus) Tactical Mis-
sile represents a substantial increase in mis-
sile acquisition and kinematics performance 
over the AIM–9M and replaces the AIM 9X 
Block I Missile configuration. The missile 
includes a high off-boresight seeker, en-
hanced countermeasure rejection capability, 
low drag/high angle of attack airframe and 
the ability to integrate the Helmet Mounted 
Cueing System. The software algorithms are 
the most sensitive portions of the Side-
winder AIM 9X Block II+ (Plus) Tactical Mis-
sile. The software continues to be modified 
via a Pre-Planned Product Improvement 
(P3I) program in order to improve its 
counter-countermeasure 
capabilities. 
No 
software source code or algorithms will be 
released. The highest level of classification 
of information included in this potential sale 
is SECRET. 
(vii) Date Report Delivered to Congress: 
November 9, 2020.

CONFIRMATION OF AMY CONEY 
BARRETT 
Mr. BURR. Madam President, last 
month the Senate confirmed the new-
est Justice to the Supreme Court, Amy 
Coney Barrett. As members of this 
body, one of our great privileges and 
weightiest responsibilities is to fulfill 
the role of ‘‘advice and consent’’ pro-
vided in the Constitution to examine 
and, if merited, confirm the President’s 
nominees. In the case of the Federal ju-
diciary, not only will these nominees 
out serve many of us in the Senate, 
their rulings will shape the fabric of 
our Nation the way that affects genera-
tions. 
It is with a great understanding of 
this that I consider judicial nominees 
and also why I am proud to have been 
able to vote in support of Justice 
Barrett’s confirmation. Much has been 
said about her legal abilities and cre-
dentials and how she has consistently 
distinguished herself as a student, a 
law clerk and practitioner, academic, 
and judge on the Seventh Circuit Court 
of Appeals. Yet two characteristics be-
yond her stellar resume enabled me to 
decisively cast my vote for her to serve 
on the Supreme Court of the United 
States: her respect for the Constitution 
and her character. 
Throughout her career, Justice Bar-
rett has shown she will uphold the Con-
stitution and that she understand the 
checks and balances that are a part of 
our democracy. She has stated mul-
tiple times that ‘‘It is never appro-
priate for a judge to impose that 
judge’s personal convictions,’’ and her 
writing and her statements and her 
opinions for the Seventh Circuit dem-
onstrate her respect for the rule of law; 
for the responsibilities of the legisla-
tive, executive, and judicial branches; 
and for interpreting the law in accord-
ance with the ‘‘the meaning it had at 
the time people ratified it.’’ This un-
derstanding is crucial for judges to en-
sure that the legislature has its proper 
role, that the Constitution is followed 
as written and amended when changes 
are necessary, and that our system has 
the proper checks and balances. 
With regards to her character, Judge 
Barrett’s career and life demonstrate 
the kind of person she is. She has re-
ceived public awards, including the 
Notre 
Dame 
Law 
School’s 
Distin-
guished Teaching Award three times, 
being selected by graduating law stu-
dents as a professor ‘‘who exhibits ex-
cellence in leadership, friendship, legal 
knowledge, legal teaching, and profes-
sional ability.’’ She has received the 
accolade of her fellow clerks on the Su-
preme Court, including the clerks of 
the late Justice Ginsburg, who called 
her ‘‘smart, honorable, and fair-mind-
ed.’’ She was lauded by fellow profes-
sors at Notre Dame as someone who 
has ‘‘in abundance all of the other 
qualities that shape extraordinary ju-
rists: discipline, intellect, wisdom, im-
peccable temperament, and above all, 
fundamental decency and humanity.’’ 
It goes without saying that these are 
the qualities of an individual who we 
want serving on the highest court of 
our land. 
For a lifetime appointment to the 
Supreme Court, an individual must be 
the entire package. I am confident that 
Justice Barrett’s credentials, judicial 
philosophy, and character will serve 
our Nation well for decades to come, 
and I am honored to have supported 
her nomination.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING ANNA MARIA 
OYSTER BAR 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, as 
chairman of the Senate Committee on 
Small Business and Entrepreneurship, 
each week I recognize a small business 
that exemplifies the American entre-
preneurial spirit at the heart of our 
country. It is an honor to recognize a 
family-owned small business known for 
its industry leadership and local phi-
lanthropy. Today, it is my pleasure to 
name Anna Maria Oyster Bar of Bra-
denton, FL, as the Senate Small Busi-
ness of the Week. 
As a student at Clemson University, 
John Horne spent his summers working 
at a restaurant on the Florida shore. 
Drawn to the hospitality industry, 
John chose to pursue a business degree 
and establish his own restaurant. After 
earning his degree, he worked in sev-
eral hospitality roles, gaining both 
managerial and front-line experience. 
John achieved his goal in 1997, opening 
the original Anna Maria Oyster Bar— 
AMOB—on the Anna Maria City Pier. 
Its family-oriented atmosphere and de-
licious food proved a hit, leading to a 
second location in 2002. 
Twenty years later, Anna Maria Oys-
ter Bar has expanded to four locations 
in the Bradenton area and has become 
a local favorite. The business remains 
family-owned, with John’s wife, Aman-
da, directing marketing and commu-
nity involvement. Their strong sense of 
family has built a tight-knit and sup-
portive team that still includes some of 
their first employees.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6651 
November 10, 2020 
John is a champion of Manatee Coun-
ty’s hospitality industry, a strong ad-
vocate of his trade and his work on 
philanthropic projects. AMOB has been 
recognized as Small Business of the 
Year by the Manatee, Sarasota, and 
Longboat Key Chambers of Commerce. 
John was also named the 2018 Anna 
Maria Island Rotary Club Small Busi-
nessperson of the Year. AMOB also re-
ceived the Champion of Tourism Award 
from the Bradenton Area Convention & 
Visitors Bureau and the 2020 Travelers’ 
Choice Best of the Best Award from 
TripAdvisor. 
In 2017, John and Amanda founded 
Dive Into Reading, a summer reading 
and mentorship program. Collaborating 
with local elementary schools, AMOB 
has provided more than 500 underprivi-
leged schoolchildren free meals, one- 
one-mentorship, and free books. For its 
impact, Dive Into Reading earned the 
National 
Restaurant 
Educational 
Foundation 2018 Restaurant Neighbor 
Award and the 2019 Leadership Florida 
Impact Award. 
Like many Florida small businesses, 
Anna Maria Oyster Bar temporarily 
closed its doors due to the coronavirus 
pandemic. In April 2020, the U.S. Small 
Business Administration launched the 
Paycheck Protection Program, a small 
business relief program that I was 
proud to author. The PPP provides for-
givable loans to impacted small busi-
nesses and nonprofits who maintain 
their payroll during the COVID–19 pan-
demic. John and Amanda used their 
PPP loan to keep their more than 320 
employees on the payroll until their 
restaurants reopened in May. 
Anna Maria Oyster Bar is a notable 
example of the critical role of relation-
ship-driven small businesses in build-
ing community. Through their philan-
thropy and industry leadership, AMOB 
has provided dignified work and in-
vested in the next generation. Con-
gratulations to John, Amanda, and the 
entire team at Anna Maria Oyster Bar. 
I look forward to watching your con-
tinued growth and leadership.∑
