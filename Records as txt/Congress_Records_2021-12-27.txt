December 27, 2021 
REMEMBRANCE OF ROSEMARY 
HOLLEY 
HON. GWEN MOORE 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 27, 2021 
Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today in remembrance of Rosemary 
Holley, a lifelong advocate for the poor and 
needy, a community leader, a trailblazer, and 
a multiple tenure Chairperson of the Board of 
Commissioners for Milwaukee’s Social Devel-
opment Commission (SDC). It saddens me to 
say that Mrs. Holley passed away on Decem-
ber 7, 2021, at the age of 95. 
The Social Development Commission is a 
community action agency with the sole pur-
pose of advocating for and assisting Mil-
waukee County residents living in poverty. 
SDC is a citizen led coalition designed to give 
people in poverty the organizing power to in-
fluence policies that will directly affect them. 
The members of SDC are not politicians or 
bureaucrats—they are everyday citizens that 
care deeply about their communities and want 
to have their voices heard. One-third of the 
governing board members live in poverty. The 
SDC equips its members to affect meaningful 
change in their own lives. 
None of this would have been possible with-
out the hard work and self-sacrifice of Mrs. 
Rosemary Holley. 
Mrs. Holley has been with SDC since its 
creation. She first served on the Head Start 
Parent Council and was elected to the SDC’s 
Board of Commissioners. Her passion and 
leadership were soon recognized by all and in 
1996, she was elected as the Chairperson of 
the SDC’s Board of Commissioners. She was 
reelected as the Chairperson in 1998 and 
served until 1999. 
Mrs. Holley stepped away from SDC in 
1999 while in her mid-70s. Most people would 
have then retired, but Mrs. Holley continued to 
serve the Fourth Congressional District on a 
volunteer basis. She coached young leaders 
with her wisdom and experience, all while con-
tinuing to serve the very neighbors who in-
spired her in the first place. In 2013, she re-
joined SDC’s Board to serve as Governance 
Technical 
Assistance 
Resource 
Provider, 
using her knowledge and experience on the 
SDC Board to provide advice on matters re-
lated to Board Governance. SDC and the Mil-
waukee Community are indebted to Mrs. 
Holley for her lifelong, tireless service. 
Mrs. Holley was a lifelong advocate for the 
poor and needy. She had multiple opportuni-
ties to work in more financially rewarding posi-
tions but found her purpose in helping those 
who were not able to help themselves. Mrs. 
Holley was the epitome of public service and 
altruism—to say Rosemary Holley has been a 
beacon of light to this community is not an ex-
aggeration. Her altruistic spirit and love for 
others are an inspiration of what we all should 
strive for in our service to the public. 
The citizens of the Fourth Congressional 
District, the State of Wisconsin and the Nation 
have benefited tremendously from her expan-
sive service. As a former employee of the 
SDC and as both a Congresswoman and a 
mentee of Mrs. Rosemary Holley, I am deeply 
grateful for her service and impact on our 
community. I am honored for these reasons to 
pay tribute to Rosemary Holley. May she Rest 
in Peace.
