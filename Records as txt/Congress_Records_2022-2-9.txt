Amen.

f 
RESTORING POWER TO WOMEN 
(Ms. DEAN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, in an impor-
tant moment of bipartisanship on Mon-
day, this Chamber passed the Ending 
Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault 
and Sexual Harassment Act of 2021. 
Over 75 percent of Members voted to 
restore power to women, who far too 
often have been at the mercy of power-
ful men and even more powerful com-
panies. 
This bill is not simply about arbitra-
tion, but about ending forced arbitra-
tion. 
According to the EEOC, one in four 
women have been sexually harassed at 
work. 
For many, the fear of retaliation and 
being blackballed stops them from 
coming forward. 
And the women who do find the cour-
age to come forward can be challenged 
by the confidentiality clause so often 
tied to forced arbitration clauses in 
employment contracts. 
This legislation will give sexual har-
assment and assault survivors the free-
dom to decide legal action. 
This bill goes beyond recourse for the 
victim. It is about redress in a court of 
law, not in a closed arbitration room. 
Because that is justice. I look for-
ward to Senate passage. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF PATRICIA 
ANN LEMAY HOCKING 
(Mr. WEBER of Texas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the life of the 
First Lady of Bee Cave, Texas, and 
former First Lady of La Marque, 
Texas, Patricia Ann LeMay Hocking. 
Patti, 
as 
she 
was 
affectionately 
known, was a fascinating woman with 
a colorful background. From an early 
age, Patti loved ballet. Patti took bal-
let lessons with the Houston Ballet 
Foundation. Patti worked hard in pur-
suit of that goal, and eventually, she 
danced professionally with the Houston 
Ballet Company. 
Patti graduated from Incarnate Word 
Academy in downtown Houston, mar-
ried Mr. Robert Ellis Hocking—Bobby 
Hocking—and they settled in Bee Cave, 
Texas, where she built, owned, and ran 
her first of two dance studios. 
After Bee Cave was incorporated in 
1987, Bobby Hocking was elected the 
town’s very first mayor. Patti was al-
ways by his side as his biggest fan and 
supporter. 
They 
traveled 
together 
internationally when Bobby was lead 
singer in many bands, then as a gospel 
singer and evangelist. It was Patti’s 
prayers and influence that brought 
Bobby back to his roots, and they spent 
many 
years 
in 
the 
ministry,

copastoring churches in Oklahoma and 
Texas. 
Most recently, the city of La Marque 
was the beneficiary of her generous 
spirit and gift of public service. Patti 
was devoted to and passionate about 
her faith, her family, and her commu-
nity. A gracious, giving, and loving 
woman, Patti was adored by all who 
met her. 
Mr. Speaker, First Lady Hocking will 
be sorely missed, and I send Bobby our 
love.

CONGRESS MUST ACT TO IMPROVE 
AMERICA’S SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES 
(Ms. GARCIA of Texas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to discuss the critical need 
for Congress to act to improve our Na-
tion’s supply chain issues. 
Last week, the House took a big step 
to make sure that the products we rely 
on are available for all Americans by 
passing the America COMPETES Act. 
The pandemic turned all of our lives 
upside down. What that disruption re-
vealed are longstanding problems in 
how much we rely on foreign manufac-
turing and foreign ingenuity. 
House Democrats have taken bold, 
decisive action to authorize $45 billion 
to fix these issues. 
We will build more critical compo-
nents right here in America. 
We will strengthen our national secu-
rity by cultivating domestic sources 
and investing in American workers. 
And we will never again face short-
ages of goods needed for the safety and 
health 
of 
our 
communities 
across 
America. 
f 
RECOGNIZING VINCENT J. 
DELMONTE 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize and honor 
the CEO of the Frank Callen Boys & 
Girls Club, Vincent DelMonte. 
Vincent has been a leader for the 
Boys & Girls Clubs for nearly 20 years 
and, with his retirement, leaves behind 
a legacy of selflessness and service. 
The Boys & Girls Club’s mission is to 
enable all young people to reach their 
full potential. Vincent certainly did 
that, and more. 
Vincent assumed his role during a 
time of severe financial turmoil. 
Vincent was able to navigate these 
troubles 
carefully 
and 
eloquently, 
making the Frank Callen Boys & Girls 
Club one of the Nation’s top clubs. 
With renewed finances and a height-
ened status, the club went on to im-
prove the lives of not only its many 
members but the communities they 
serve under Vincent’s guidance. 
We hope Vincent truly enjoys his re-
tirement. After what Vincent has done 
for the Frank Callen Boys & Girls Club, 
he has certainly done more than his 
fair share for our community. 
Vincent is the type of man many 
should strive to be, someone who 
leaves the community he loved better 
than he found it. 
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Vincent 
on his well-deserved retirement. 
f 
CONDEMNING 
THE 
FORCED 
RE-
MOVAL 
OF 
SUDAN’S 
TRANSI-
TIONAL GOVERNMENT 
(Mr. KILDEE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
strongly condemn the recent forced re-
moval of Sudan’s transitional govern-
ment by Sudan’s military forces. 
Before the October coup by military 
leaders, Sudan’s civilian-led govern-
ment was positively reengaging with 
the United States and the rest of the 
world, including being removed from 
the State Sponsors of Terrorism list 
and opening up the Sudanese economy 
for foreign investment. 
The Sudanese people have bravely 
stood up to demand the right to demo-
cratically choose their own future after 
decades of oppression under a previous 
regime. The Sudanese military must 
respect the rights of the Sudanese peo-
ple. 
America must stand with those who 
want democracy, including the people 
of Sudan. The U.S. and our allies must 
use every diplomatic tool available to 
restore stability and civilian-led con-
trol of Sudan’s government. 
Thousands of Sudanese civilians are 
risking their lives every day for democ-
racy, and the United States must align 
its policies to support their democratic 
aspirations. 
f 
RECOGNIZING 
FORT 
MOSE 
IN 
HONOR 
OF 
BLACK 
HISTORY 
MONTH 
(Mr. RUTHERFORD asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, in 
honor of Black History Month, I would 
like to recognize a special place in my 
district, Fort Mose. 
Near St. Augustine, Florida, it was 
the first legally sanctioned, free Black 
settlement in what is now the United 
States. 
As early as the late 1600s, freedom 
seekers escaped enslavement in the 
English colonies and made their way to 
St. Augustine, then under Spanish rule. 
An estimated 100 Africans were then 
given freedom in exchange for adopting 
Catholicism and declaring allegiance 
to Spain. 
In 1994, the Fort Mose site was des-
ignated as a historic national land-
mark. 
Fort Mose embodies the fight for 
freedom by Black Americans in the 
early days of our country, and it high-
lights a piece of Black history that is 
dramatically different from the more 
familiar story of slavery and oppres-
sion. 
f 
CONGRESS MUST FIGHT WHITE 
SUPREMACY 
(Ms. BOURDEAUX asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. BOURDEAUX. Mr. Speaker, in 
the fall of 1912, Forsyth County, in my 
district was the site of an appalling ra-
cial cleansing. 
Following the death of a White 
woman named Mae Crow, three Black 
men, Rob Edwards, Ernest Knox, and 
Oscar Daniel, were accused of her mur-
der and lynched without due process. 
Following this, White men on horse-
back 
dubbed 
‘‘night 
riders’’ 
rode 
throughout Forsyth County terrorizing 
families and burning Black churches, 
homes, and businesses, ultimately driv-
ing out over 1,100 Black residents. 
Forsyth County continued to have 
little to no Black residents for almost 
a century. 
Today, I am introducing a resolution 
condemning 
the 
lynchings 
of 
Rob 
Edwards, Oscar Daniel, and Ernest 
Knox in 1912 and condemning the ac-
tions of the white supremacist mobs 
which forced out nearly the entire 
Black population of Forsyth County. 
It is particularly important during 
Black History Month that we as a Na-
tion acknowledge horrific events such 
as this one and honor the memory of 
the victims of these tragedies. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
resolution and reaffirm this body’s 
commitment to fighting white suprem-
acy and seeking justice to right the 
wrongs of our past. 
f 
RECOGNIZING CAREER AND 
TECHNICAL EDUCATION MONTH 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
February as Career and Technical Edu-
cation Month. 
During this month, we celebrate and 
highlight the value career and tech-
nical education, or CTE, which restores 
the rungs on the ladder of opportunity 
for many individuals and gives them 
the tools to succeed. 
As the co-chair of the Bipartisan Ca-
reer and Technical Education Caucus 
and a senior member of the House Com-
mittee on Education and Labor, I have 
always supported, and will continue to 
support, CTE programs that provide 
learners of all ages with career-ready 
skills. 
Our students should be aware of their 
educational options and understand a 
bachelor’s degree is not the only path 
to a meaningful, family-sustaining ca-
reer. 
A highly skilled workforce is impor-
tant to the success of America’s eco-
nomic growth and competitiveness.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1079 
February 9, 2022 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Con-
gressman JIM LANGEVIN from Rhode Is-
land, for joining me and introducing 
this resolution to recognize the impor-
tance of career and technical edu-
cation. 
We will continue to work hard to 
close the Nation’s skills gap. 
f 
IN SUPPORT OF THE UNITED 
STATES POSTAL SERVICE 
(Mr. KILMER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the Postal Service 
Reform Act of 2022, bipartisan legisla-
tion to help the U.S. Postal Service re-
main financially viable and ensure it 
provides the high quality of service 
that Americans expect and deserve. 
Even before this pandemic began, the 
post office and our postal workers 
played a critical role in our country, 
ensuring that folks across our Nation 
received essential packages and letters, 
including medication, food, supplies, 
ballots, and notes from loved ones. 
And this importance only grew dur-
ing the pandemic. 
Now, unfortunately the Postal Serv-
ice has faced serious financial chal-
lenges in recent years, even as postal 
workers serviced more locations. It has 
been burdened by, among other things, 
a requirement that no employer in pri-
vate industry has, to prefund benefits 
for workers who, frankly, haven’t even 
been born yet. 
That is why this week I voted for the 
bipartisan Postal Service Reform Act. 
This bill makes some commonsense re-
forms to save the Postal Service bil-
lions of dollars, to have the backs of 
the terrific professionals who work for 
the Postal Service, to improve the 
service’s performance, and to ensure 
that folks in my region and around our 
country can rely on the delivery of 
paychecks, prescriptions, tax returns, 
and more. 
We have got to get this bill signed 
into law.

COMMEMORATING THE LIFE OF 
JOEL ‘‘JOE’’ STEVENSON 
(Mrs. BOEBERT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to commemorate the life of Montezuma 
County commissioner, Joel ‘‘Joe’’ Ste-
venson. He will be remembered as a 
larger-than-life champion of rural Col-
orado who never wavered in his belief 
that the world needs more cowboys. 
He was a rancher, a caring husband, a 
loving father, and a friend. Joe was a 
happy warrior, and his passion with a 
smile will continue to inspire me as I 
serve in Congress and generations to 
come. Joe devoted his life to the agri-
culture community where he served his 
neighbors as a brand inspector for the 
Colorado Department of Agriculture 
for 20 years. 
Mr. Speaker, Joe’s life of service has 
come to an end but his legacy will live 
on in Montezuma County and the Colo-
rado agriculture community; and in his 
wife, Sheree; and his children, Colette, 
Chelsi, Mary Jo, Jodie, and Sam; and 
in his 7 grandchildren who affection-
ately called him ‘‘Papa.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I take comfort knowing 
God’s wraparound presence is sur-
rounding Joe’s family today and he has 
entered into the joy of his Lord. Amer-
ica needs more cowboys like my friend, 
Joe Stevenson, but I know that heaven 
just gained one. 
f 
GLOBAL RESPECT ACT 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, pursuant 
to House Resolution 900, I call up the 
bill (H.R. 3485) to impose sanctions on 
foreign persons responsible for viola-
tions 
of 
internationally 
recognized 
human rights against lesbian, gay, bi-
sexual, transgender, queer and intersex 
(LGBTQI) individuals, and for other 
purposes, and ask for its immediate 
consideration in the House. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 900, in lieu of 
the amendment in the nature of a sub-
stitute recommended by the Com-
mittee on Foreign Affairs printed in 
the bill, an amendment in the nature of 
a substitute consisting of the text of 
Rules Committee Print 117–30 is adopt-
ed, and the bill, as amended, is consid-
ered read. 
The text of the bill, as amended, is as 
follows: 
H.R. 3485 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Global Respect 
Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) The dignity, freedom, and equality of all 
human beings are fundamental to a thriving 
global community. 
(2) The rights to life, liberty, and security of 
the person, the right to privacy, and the right to 
freedom of expression and association are fun-
damental human rights. 
(3) An alarming trend of violence directed at 
LGBTQI individuals around the world con-
tinues. 
(4) Approximately one-third of all countries 
have laws criminalizing consensual same-sex re-
lations, and many have enacted policies or laws 
that would further target LGBTQI individuals. 
(5) Every year thousands of individuals 
around the world are targeted for harassment, 
attack, arrest, and murder on the basis of their 
sexual orientation or gender identity. 
(6) Those who commit crimes against LGBTQI 
individuals often do so with impunity, and are 
not held accountable for their crimes. 
(7) In many instances police, prison, military, 
and civilian government authorities have been 
directly complicit in abuses aimed at LGBTQI 
citizens, including arbitrary arrest, torture, and 
sexual abuse. 
(8) Celebrations of LGBTQI individuals and 
communities, such as film festivals, Pride 
events, and demonstrations are often forced un-
derground due to inaction on the part of, or 
harassment by, local law enforcement and gov-
ernment officials, in violation of freedoms of as-
sembly and expression. 
(9) Laws criminalizing consensual same-sex 
relations severely hinder access to HIV/AIDS 
treatment, information, and preventive measures 
for LGBTQI individuals and families. 
(10) Many countries are making positive de-
velopments in the protection of the basic human 
rights of LGBTQI individuals.

SIBLE FOR VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN 
RIGHTS AGAINST LGBTQI PEOPLE.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 3485. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a very important 
day with a very important bill, and I 
rise today in strong support of H.R. 
3485, the Global Respect Act, as amend-
ed, and introduced by my friend and 
great American, Congressman DAVID 
CICILLINE. 
Mr. Speaker, we live in a country 
that espouses that all human beings 
are created equal, endowed with equal 
rights, no matter what we look like, 
how we pray, or where we come from. 
The Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights tells us, ‘‘all human beings are 
born free and equal in dignity and 
rights.’’ The International Covenant of 
Civil and Political Rights states that, 
‘‘All persons are equal before the law 
and are entitled without any discrimi-
nation to the equal protection of the 
law.’’ 
And our own Declaration of Inde-
pendence famously says, ‘‘We hold 
these truths to be self-evident, that all 
men are created equal, that they are 
endowed by their creator with certain 
unalienable rights, that among these 
are life, liberty and the pursuit of hap-
piness.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, the Global Respect Act 
brings us closer to realizing these 
treasured ideals. 
Today, unfortunately, shamelessly, 
millions of people are living in fear. In 
countless countries, LGBTQI-plus peo-
ple face punishment simply for being 
who they are. They are subject to bru-
tal beatings, imprisoned for lifetimes,

February 9, 2022 
tortured, hanged, and stoned. When 
human rights abuses are being com-
mitted, the United States of America 
must do its part to hold the perpetra-
tors accountable. And that is why Con-
gressman CICILLINE
introduced H.R. 
3485, the Global Respect Act. 
This legislation is critical, straight-
forward, and overdue. It requires the 
President to identify foreign individ-
uals responsible for these human rights 
violations against LGBTQI-plus people 
and to prevent them from entering the 
United States of America. 
In addition, the Global Respect Act 
requires the State Department to des-
ignate at least one senior officer re-
sponsible for tracking violence, crim-
inalization, and restrictions on the 
freedoms 
of 
LGBTQI-plus 
people 
abroad. This legislation also requires 
the Department of State to include in-
formation relating to violence or dis-
crimination against LGBTQI-plus com-
munities in its annual human rights 
reports. 
Now, unfortunately, several of my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
say they oppose the bill because they 
claim it is duplicative of Magnitsky 
sanctions. While Global Magnitsky is a 
landmark tool in the fight against 
human rights abuses, rarely has it been 
used by administrations to sanction 
those who persecute LGBTQI-plus per-
sons. This bill simply builds on exist-
ing human rights-related authorities to 
ensure that human rights abusers are 
held accountable everywhere on this 
planet. 
They also argue the language of the 
bill is overly broad when, in fact, the 
words they quibble with come directly 
from what has already been enacted in 
the United States Code, drawing word- 
from-word the definition of ‘‘gross vio-
lation of human rights.’’ 
There are critics out there who say 
this bill infringes on religious beliefs. I 
wholeheartedly, 1,000 percent, reject 
this notion. The Global Respect Act is 
about holding accountable individuals 
responsible 
for 
committing 
human 
rights 
abuses 
against 
LGBTQI-plus 
people; Individuals who commit the ab-
solute worst crimes, such as murder, 
forced detentions, and disappearances 
of persons. This bill is clear in that it 
targets heinous acts, and does not au-
thorize any action against an indi-
vidual based solely upon religious be-
lief. 
Mr. Speaker, I can’t thank Congress-
man DAVID CICILLINE enough for his 
work, for his commitment, for his dedi-
cation on presenting this legislation so 
that equality and human rights are 
protected. I also recognize the coura-
geous LGBTQI-plus activists who are 
out there and who dared to stand up 
and claim their basic human rights in 
the face of violence, discrimination, 
persecution, simply for whom they 
love. 
Mr. Speaker, I have a brother who 
had to stand up for who he is. He is a 
human being. And we should not allow 
any violations of human rights here in 
the United States or anyplace we know 
as planet Earth. 
So when LGBTQI-plus people are 
murdered 
simply 
for 
existing, 
the 
world is watching. And the world is 
watching what we do. And the world is 
watching how we react to it. And the 
world is watching what we say, and 
what we stand for when we say we have 
value for human beings. That is what is 
at stake here. 
This should not be a partisan issue. It 
has never been a partisan issue. This 
should be an issue about all human 
beings, protecting human beings, the 
human race, because when you break it 
down, we are all the same. And that is 
why I am heartened that this legisla-
tion is in fact bipartisan. And I am 
heartened and proud that this legisla-
tion passed out of the House Com-
mittee on Foreign Affairs by a voice 
vote. One of the proudest moments I 
have is introducing and being on this 
floor today as chair of the House Com-
mittee on Foreign Affairs to strongly 
support this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, we all believe that all 
people have inherent dignity and pos-
sess equal human rights. We all reject 
violence directed at individuals on the 
basis of their race, religion, biological 
sex, or sexual orientation. The problem 
with this bill, however, is that it bor-
rows language from two existing laws: 
the Global Magnitsky Act and the so- 
called Section 7031(c) sanctions, and 
then creates a new reporting mecha-
nism that is not focused on the human 
rights of all, but rather the human 
rights of particular groups. 
I don’t see why we should focus on 
some human rights violations more 
than any others. Every person’s human 
rights are of equal value and certain 
violations of those rights should not be 
subordinate to others. 
Furthermore, the bill’s broad lan-
guage has the potential to sweep in 
nonviolent conduct and impose visa re-
strictions on individuals engaged in 
that conduct. 
For example, it speaks about ‘‘com-
plicity’’ and ‘‘cruel treatment,’’ vague 
terms. Is a parent overseas who rejects 
her minor child’s wish for a sex change 
operation complicit in cruelty? Is the 
Pope engaged in ‘‘degrading treat-
ment’’ when he expresses opposition to 
same-sex marriage based on the tenets 
of his religious faith? 
Mr. Speaker, there are no safeguards 
in the bill that address these situa-
tions. When free speech, religious free-
dom, and parental rights’ protections 
were proposed to be added to the bill, 
the 
Democrats 
balked 
and 
voted 
against it. They preach tolerance until 
they are asked to vote on it. 
Regardless of the author’s intent, 
which I think is good, there are people 
that will use the bill to target their po-
litical and ideological opponents in the 
culture wars. The bill’s author will say 
that there should be no problem since 
it just uses the very same language as 
other human rights statutes, but those 
existing provisions already address and 
punish the conduct this bill targets. 
b 0930 
So, the real question is, why is this 
bill so necessary? In the committee re-
port, Democrats acknowledge the bill 
is redundant. But in search of some— 
any, perhaps—rationale, they claim 
that not enough sanctions have been 
rolled out that cover crimes committed 
against LGBT-identifying individuals. 
That is simply not true. 
We know, for example, under the 
Trump administration, groups and in-
dividuals from Chechnya were sanc-
tioned under Global Magnitsky for 
human 
rights 
abuses, 
including 
extrajudicial killings and the torture 
of LGBT-identifying individuals. 
The former Gambian President was 
also sanctioned after having rounded 
up people based on sexual orientation 
and after making shocking statements 
against LGBT-identifying individuals. 
These sanctions, as I said, were im-
posed under the Trump administration, 
but even more have been imposed, 
using the Global Magnitsky Act, under 
President Biden. 
We know, based on a recent Global 
Magnitsky report to Congress that 
came out a few weeks ago, individuals 
last year in places like Cuba, Uganda, 
and even Bangladesh have been sanc-
tioned, and all are associated with 
groups or conduct targeting LGBT- 
identifying individuals. 
So, this bill is clearly unnecessary. It 
reflects and represents the administra-
tion’s aggressive attempts to push the 
envelope regarding culture war issues 
at every possible juncture, not only do-
mestically but abroad. 
That is distracting and requires dip-
lomats to devote time and resources to 
culture war issues at the expense of at-
tention paid to China, Russia, Iran, the 
quagmire in Afghanistan, and the crisis 
at our southern border. 
It is disappointing that as Ukraine is 
on the verge of being invaded by Rus-
sia, as North Korea continues to con-
duct ballistic missile tests, as illegal 
aliens stream through our southern 
border—some on our terror watch list— 
the majority has decided now is the 
time to bring this bill forward. 
The State Department agrees. It has 
reviewed the Global Respect Act and 
recommended extensive changes, sig-
naling it, too, sees this bill as super-
fluous, potentially misguided, and defi-
nitely duplicative. Other groups have 
said much the same, including The 
Heritage Foundation, the Center for 
Family and Human Rights, Concerned 
Women for America, and the Family 
Research Council. 
Although I agree with the sentiment 
that human rights violations of any 
kind are deplorable and despicable, the 
devil is really in the details on this 
bill. We oppose this bill for the reasons 
I have stated.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1082 
February 9, 2022 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I just want 
to state that the notion that this bill is 
not supported by the administration is 
just blatantly false. 
Just last week, the Biden administra-
tion released a Statement of Adminis-
tration Policy in full support of the bill 
and noted the urgent need to address 
threats 
to 
the 
human 
rights 
of 
LGBTQI-plus, not just abroad but right 
here in the United States of America. 
Mr. Speaker, I am honored to yield 4 
minutes to the gentleman from Rhode 
Island (Mr. CICILLINE), the author of 
this bill. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding, and I rise 
in support of H.R. 3485. I want to begin 
by expressing my profound gratitude to 
Chairman MEEKS
for his consistent, 
passionate, and powerful support of 
this bill and of the LGBTQI community 
broadly. He has been such a champion 
for our community. We would not be 
here today on this floor without his 
support, and we are grateful for that. 
Mr. Speaker, I also want to recognize 
Congressman BRIAN FITZPATRICK, Sen-
ator SHAHEEN, and Senator PORTMAN 
for their partnership and leadership in 
making this legislation bipartisan and 
bicameral. 
Of course, I want to recognize and 
thank President Biden for his incred-
ible commitment to LGBTQI equality 
here at home and around the world. 
With today’s vote, the U.S. House 
will send a strong message across the 
world 
that 
every 
member 
of 
the 
LGBTQI community deserves to live 
with dignity and free from violence, 
unlawful detention, torture, and other 
forms of brutality. 
H.R. 3485, the Global Respect Act, 
builds on existing sanction authorities 
by requiring the President to deny 
visas to foreign nationals who commit 
gross human rights violations against 
members of the LGBTQI community. 
Let me be clear. This bill protects 
LGBTQI people from murder, torture, 
and other forms of violence. 
If you reject this proposal, you are 
saying people like me can be murdered 
and tortured with no consequence. 
Whether that is your intention or not, 
that is the impact of your vote. 
In past years, we have seen a dan-
gerous increase in violence against les-
bian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and 
intersex people and their families. 
So, when my colleague on the other 
side of the aisle says, ‘‘What is the 
need for this?’’ tell that to the victims 
who are being tortured, detained, and 
murdered because of who they are. 
In too many places, violence against 
this community is pervasive and even 
sanctioned or directed by government 
officials. 
The Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights states that ‘‘all human beings 
are born free and equal in dignity and 
rights.’’ As with any form of social or 
legal marginalization, whether based 
on sex, race, religion, ethnicity, or 
other status, the denial of human 
rights of LGBTQI people is not only 
wrong but negatively affects health 
outcomes, social stability, the rule of 
law, and economic potential. 
This bill sends a signal to not just 
the abusers but also signals to the vic-
tims and survivors that the United 
States stands with them, as we have 
throughout the course of human his-
tory, in standing up for human rights. 
Victims like Camila Diaz Cordova, a 
29-year-old transgender woman from El 
Salvador who was arrested, beaten, and 
thrown from a moving vehicle after 
being 
deported 
from 
the 
United 
States—she died several days later; or 
the young gay man who fled from 
Sudan to Egypt after threats of public 
outing and violence, only to experience 
kidnapping and further stigmatization 
and violence in his new home; or I.J., a 
victim of Ramzan Kadyrov’s system-
atic rounding up and torture of men 
and women thought to be gay in 
Chechnya. 
In recounting the attack, I.J. said: 
‘‘They threw me to the floor and beat 
me. They beat my chest and my face 
with their feet, and they hit my head 
against the floor. One of them said: ‘Do 
not beat him until the shock stage. At 
that point, he will stop feeling pain. We 
don’t need that.’ They addressed me 
with female pronouns and demanded 
that I tell them the names of other gay 
people I knew. They threatened to kill 
me if I didn’t.’’ 
In public reports, we heard of ISIS of-
ficials throwing gay men off rooftops 
and then stoning them to death. 
These are just some examples of the 
many, many stories. 
The Global Respect Act is simple. It 
is straightforward. It gives the execu-
tive branch greater tools to punish 
those who murder and torture members 
of the LGBTQI community. 
I want to take a quick moment to 
tell you what this bill does not do. It 
doesn’t duplicate existing rights legis-
lation such as the Global Magnitsky 
Act because Global Magnitsky is obvi-
ously a very important tool for human 
rights, but it is voluntary. It has only 
been used once for LGBTQI human 
rights violations, despite many docu-
mented cases. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Rhode Island. 
Mr. CICILLINE. The Global Respect 
Act is different because it requires 
sanctions if a foreign national commits 
gross human rights violations against 
LGBTQI people. 
It doesn’t have overly broad lan-
guage. As the chairman said, it has 
language that comes from 22 U.S.C. 
2304. It doesn’t create any new defini-
tions. It has the definition in existing 
law of what gross human rights viola-
tion is. 
It doesn’t prevent speech or religious 
beliefs. This bill targets conduct and 
actions. The Global Magnitsky has 
never, nor will this bill ever, be used to 
impede anyone’s right to say or believe 
anything. It is their actions, the gross 
human rights violations, that are at 
issue. 
My friend on the other side of the 
aisle said it is cancel culture. When did 
preventing murder, torture, and vio-
lence, and standing up for human 
rights, become cancel culture? 
We have a long tradition in this 
country of doing this all around the 
world. The Global Respect Act honors 
that history, that responsibility that 
we have as a world superpower to con-
tinue to protect and stand up for 
human rights in the face of unspeak-
able human violence. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I end 
where I began, with enormous grati-
tude to our extraordinary chairman for 
his leadership on this issue. 
Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentle-
man’s passion, and I support his sup-
port of condemning and sanctioning 
these terrible acts against the LGBT 
community. 
I just wanted to let the Speaker 
know, in the newest Global Magnitsky 
Act report, which was just released a 
few weeks ago and covers 2021, sanc-
tions were imposed on Cuban police; in 
Uganda, the Chief of the Military Intel-
ligence; also in Bangladesh, the Rapid 
Action Battalion. 
All of these were associated with 
LGBT causes, which means this act is 
being used to sanction those who com-
mit acts of violence of any kind 
against people of the LGBT commu-
nity. I just wanted to make sure that 
the gentleman is aware of that. The 
State Department is already reporting 
and already doing this, and it is being 
done. 
Though I support everything that he 
is stating here, it is already being 
done. In the interest of good legisla-
tion, we don’t want to overburden our 
bureaucrats and people that are work-
ing on these issues. Also, reporting, 
they have indicated that additional re-
porting requirements only take more 
time out of the organization. 
I do appreciate the messaging from 
the gentleman from Rhode Island. It is 
very important that we signal to the 
world that we condemn acts against 
the LGBT community. The problem is, 
we already have this, and we already 
have the ability and two tools that are 
very effective and used internationally 
to condemn these acts. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, let me just 
say this real quick. I don’t mind bur-
dening anyone if it is going to save 
somebody’s life. There are certain bur-
dens that we have to carry, and this is 
one of them. 
Mr. Speaker, I, with pride, yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Ne-
vada (Ms. TITUS), a strong fighter for 
human rights.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1083 
February 9, 2022 
Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of the Global Respect Act that 
is 
being 
led 
by 
my 
friend, 
Mr. 
CICILLINE. I thank him for his passion 
and his leadership in the committee on 
this issue. 
Since the Supreme Court’s landmark 
decision legalizing same-sex marriage 
in 2015, we have sought out domestic 
opportunities to ensure that individ-
uals’ basic rights are not infringed 
upon simply because of their sexual 
orientation. We have to make more 
progress not just here at home but 
around the world, where we take lead-
ership on this issue. 
Throughout the last century, we have 
stood for human rights, and in 2016, I 
was 
proud 
to 
support 
the 
Global 
Magnitsky Act, which imposed certain 
restrictions, as you have heard men-
tioned already. Magnitsky, however, 
did not go far enough to protect the 
LGBTQ-plus community. 
In at least 42 countries, there remain 
legal barriers to freedom of expression 
on sexual orientation and gender iden-
tity. In at least 51 countries, there are 
specific laws and policies against the 
formation, establishment, or registra-
tion of NGOs working on sexual ori-
entation issues. Nor has Magnitsky dis-
suaded the persecution of LGBTQI 
communities whose rights continue to 
be violated. 
That is why I was grateful to have a 
part in working on this Global Respect 
Act legislation because it will impose 
needed visa sanctions on foreign people 
responsible for such actions. 
My own legislation, the GLOBE Act, 
I think would take a step further to as-
sert U.S. global leadership in this area 
and provide the administration with 
additional tools to carry out those 
things established in this landmark 
legislation. Some of those would be: en-
suring that foreign assistance and glob-
al health programs don’t discriminate 
against LGBTQ-plus populations, and 
also ensuring fair access to asylum for 
LGBTQ people. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman 
and the sponsor, and I urge everyone to 
vote for this much-needed and very im-
portant bill. 
Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. MANNING). 
Ms. MANNING. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of the Global 
Respect Act, including my amendment 
to ensure accountability for torture. 
As a member of the Foreign Affairs 
Committee, I am proud to work with 
my colleagues, Chairman MEEKS and 
Congressman CICILLINE, to protect and 
defend human rights and uphold our 
values around the world. 
Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan bill 
would require the President to identify 
and impose visa sanctions on foreign 
individuals 
responsible 
for 
human 
rights violations against LGBTQ-plus 
people. 
My amendment would direct sanc-
tions against those responsible for one 
of the most horrific acts of violence: 
torture. No one should face violence be-
cause of who they are or who they love. 
b 0945 
We must hold those responsible for 
gross violations of human rights ac-
countable no matter what. This impor-
tant 
legislation 
ensures 
that 
the 
United States continues to protect the 
human rights of all people, including 
LGBTQ people targeted by some of the 
world’s worst and most oppressive re-
gimes. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in supporting the Global Re-
spect Act. 
Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. MEEKS. I am prepared to close, 
Mr. Speaker. 
Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, again, I support the un-
derlying idea behind the bill, and I 
really appreciate the passion of the 
sponsor and those speaking out on be-
half of it and protecting the human 
rights of all individuals living abroad 
and holding violators accountable. But 
as I have said, we have a strong dif-
ference of opinion about whether a bill 
that is duplicative of current law is 
necessary. 
I think the Global Respect Act, at 
the moment, the way it is drafted is 
counterproductive insofar as it would 
create a separate regime aimed at pro-
tecting human rights of some rather 
than human rights of all. And I fear it 
could be used to target the left’s polit-
ical opponents in the culture wars. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
oppose this bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, let me start by com-
mending and thanking the Biden ad-
ministration for its strong support in 
moving this legislation. 
What is noted in his support is that 
legislation like this is needed at a time 
especially when countries are under-
taking steps to further marginalize or 
harm LGBTQ-plus community mem-
bers and that the administration looks 
forward to working with Congress on 
what I know will be a bipartisan vote. 
I also happen to agree with President 
Biden and echo his statement that in a 
time 
when 
a 
global 
rise 
in 
authoritarianism 
and 
hate 
persists 
that it is critical that we send a strong 
message to the world that the United 
States of America, the world’s greatest 
democracy—that the United States of 
America, who leads with its values— 
that the United States of America can 
speak up and speak out striving to be a 
more perfect Union, and that the 
United States of America can lead the 
world to say that we are going to stop 
the persecution of human beings sim-
ply for who they are. 
This is the year 2022, Mr. Speaker. I 
would think by now we would have 
learned that our voices should never be 
shut when we see violations of human 
rights. One of the things that I pledged 
when I became chair of this committee 
was that human rights would be on the 
front burner because if we can’t come 
together no matter what party we are 
in, no matter what religion we have, no 
matter what ethnicity we have, and no 
matter where we come from on this 
planet, if we can’t come together and 
say that we are going to stand up, 
speak out, and stop where individuals 
are being persecuted and prosecuted— 
murdered—that is the least that we 
can do. 
I don’t care how difficult it is. I don’t 
care if it puts a burden on the adminis-
tration to do it because those are our 
values, that is what should take prece-
dence. 
I have seen too much right here in 
the United States—individuals just 
walking down the street holding hands 
with whom they love, and someone 
walks up and does something horrific 
to them. 
We have had to pass these bills and 
laws in our country so that they can 
live their life. If we see it happening to 
anyone else, then we have got to make 
sure that voice is heard and stop indi-
viduals who are persecuting and pros-
ecuting people from anyplace else on 
this planet from coming to this coun-
try. 
Send a message. Don’t send it once, 
send it twice. If it takes three or four 
times, then so be it. That is what this 
is all about. The camera of history is 
recording this, looking to see what we 
do and what we say. 
How do we react to a human tragedy? 
Generations yet unborn will be say-
ing: What did the United States Con-
gress do when they knew? 
No one denies what is taking place 
all over the world when it comes to 
LGBTQI-plus individuals. Nobody de-
nies that they are being killed. No one 
denies that they are being tortured. 
Nobody denies that they are treated in 
an inhumane way. That is not being de-
nied. 
So as long as it exists, we should use 
every tool available to make sure that 
we wipe it off the planet Earth, and 
that is what DAVID
CICILLINE, this 
great Congressman, intended when he 
offered this bill. 
This should be an historic moment 
and a proud moment for the United 
States Congress to say: We have stood 
up and led the world to stop human 
rights violations to people just like us, 
human beings. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a sen-
ior member of the House and the Committee 
on Homeland Security, and as Chair of the Ju-
diciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, 
and Homeland Security, and a member of the 
Equality Caucus, I rise in strong support of 
H.R. 3485, the Global Respect Act of 2021. 
I strongly support H.R. 3485 the Global Re-
spect Act, which would mandate the listing of, 
and visa restrictions on foreign persons re-
sponsible for or complicit in human rights vio-
lations 
against 
lesbian, 
gay, 
bisexual,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1084 
February 9, 2022 
transgender, queer, and intersex (LGBTQI+) 
persons. 
Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and 
queer (LGBTQ+) people around the world 
continue to face discrimination, violence, and 
bigotry. 
Sixty-eight countries criminalize same-sex 
sexual relations, which means that more than 
one-third of United Nations Member States 
criminalize consenting, adult, same-sex sexual 
relations. 
In up to nine countries, same-sex sexual re-
lations may be punishable by death, and so- 
called anti-LGBTQ+ ‘‘propaganda’’ laws inhibit 
LGBTQ+ advocacy in at least three countries. 
While many countries have made tremen-
dous 
strides 
in 
embracing 
equality 
for 
LGBTQI+ community members, other coun-
tries remain stagnant or, worse, are under-
taking steps to further marginalize or harm 
LGBTQI+ community members. 
That is why I support H.R. 3485, a bi-par-
tisan bill, which requires the Administration to 
provide Congress with a list of foreign individ-
uals found responsible for human rights viola-
tions against LGBTQI+ persons abroad, and 
equally important, mandates that individuals 
included on this list are ineligible for visas to, 
or entry into, the United States. 
The U.S. Department of State’s annual 
Country Reports on Human Rights Practices 
has documented hostility toward LGBTQ+ citi-
zens in every region of the world. 
These violations include murder, rape, tor-
ture, death threats, extortion, imprisonment, 
and loss of employment and access to health 
care, as well as restrictions on freedoms of 
assembly, press, and speech. 
The Global Respect Act would provide a 
means to prevent individuals who violate the 
human rights of LGBTQ+ people from entry 
into the United States. 
The Global Respect Act also would require 
the Executive Branch to biannually send Con-
gress a list of foreign persons responsible for, 
complicit in, or who have incited extrajudicial 
killing, torture, or other gross violations of 
human rights based on actual or perceived 
sexual orientation or gender identity. 
As I stated, there is teeth in the legislation 
because it requires the denial or revocation of 
visas to individuals placed on the list, with 
waivers only for national security or to allow 
attendance at the United Nations; 
Finally, the legislation requires the annual 
State Department Report on Human Rights to 
include a section on LGBTQ+ international 
human rights, as well as an annual report to 
Congress on the status of the law’s effective-
ness; and requires the Assistant Secretary of 
State for Democracy, Human Rights, and 
Labor to designate a staffer responsible for 
tracking violence, criminalization, and restric-
tions on the enjoyment of fundamental free-
doms in foreign countries based on actual or 
perceived sexual orientation or gender identity. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this legisla-
tion and urge all Members to join me in voting 
for H.R. 3485, the Global Respect Act.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 900, the gen-
tleman 
from 
Rhode 
Island 
(Mr. 
CICILLINE) and the gentlewoman from 
New York (Ms. TENNEY) each will con-
trol 10 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Rhode Island. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Before I address the en bloc amend-
ments, I just want to respond quickly 
to a claim that has been made again on 
this floor that was made in the Rules 
Committee by my friend on the other 
side of the aisle that the Magnitsky 
Act has already adequately covered 
LGBTQI human rights violations. I am 
going to say it one more time: That is 
simply, factually incorrect. 
All of the cases that my friend cited, 
Mr. Speaker, do not involve LGBTQI 
people, save one. There is one specific 
LGBTQI case in which sanctions were 
imposed in 2019 against the Chechen 
leader for kidnapping, torturing, and 
killing members of the LGBTQI com-
munity. 
The cases she makes reference to in 
Bangladesh, in Cuba, and in Uganda in-
volve judicial corruption, and they in-
volve a government crackdown on de-
mocracy, but they don’t involve indi-
viduals who were targeted or brutalized 
because they were members of the 
LGBTQI community. 
So there is, in fact, not sufficient use 
of Magnitsky. That is what the Global 
Respect Act will fix. It will make visa 
sanctions against such individuals a 
mandatory requirement. 
So this idea of pulling other human 
rights cases and saying, Isn’t this 
enough? 
It is not. This is a growing, serious, 
and deadly problem. 
Mr. Speaker, I move these amend-
ments which, taken together, both

H1085 
February 9, 2022 
strengthen the bill and make a strong 
statement 
that 
the 
United 
States 
stands with the LGBTQI community 
around the world. 
This package of amendments clari-
fies that torture is a part of the defini-
tion of a human rights violation. This 
definition, which we have used since 
the passage of the Foreign Assistance 
Act of 1961, makes it clear that it is ac-
tions—torture, cruel, inhuman, or de-
grading treatment or punishment— 
that lead to sanctions. 
These amendments firmly state that 
the value of religious freedom is pro-
tected. The United States has long 
been a leader of protecting freedom of 
religion, and our foreign policy must 
uphold that tradition. The Harder 
amendment within the en bloc makes 
it clear that no one—I repeat, no one— 
will be sanctioned due to their reli-
gious beliefs; instead, only those who 
commit egregious acts of violence— 
torture, enforced disappearances, or 
extrajudicial killings—will be denied 
entry to the United States. 
Despite what some of my colleagues 
may say, religious freedom is not in 
conflict with the promotion of global 
LGBTQI rights. This amendment ac-
knowledges this truth and upholds the 
rights of all people regardless of their 
religion, sexual orientation, gender 
identity, or sex characteristics to be 
protected from violence and brutality. 
These amendments will also provide 
the Biden-Harris administration with 
additional tools to continue its historic 
work to build the international coali-
tion of countries protecting LGBTQI 
people. It is important that we stand 
with countries around the world, in-
cluding those like Botswana, which le-
galized same-sex relationships in 2019, 
to strengthen equality around the 
globe. 
With today’s vote, the U.S. House 
will send a strong message around the 
world 
that 
every 
member 
of 
the 
LGBTQI community deserves to live 
with dignity and free from violence, 
unlawful detention, torture, and other 
forms of brutality. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, just to respond a little 
bit to the sponsor, and, again, I can’t 
say enough that we support and echo 
the sentiments of protecting the rights 
of the LGBT community around the 
world and at home. 
But this bill actually mirrors the 
Global Magnitsky Act, and the lan-
guage is the same. So it is kind of hard 
to argue we should just have another 
set of standards and require even more 
reporting from a State Department 
that is overwhelmed by issues around 
the world when we already have this. 
Mr. Speaker, if you look at these in-
stances, the State Department doesn’t 
disclose necessarily what the nature of 
it is because of the confidentiality, but 
if you actually go into a Google search 
and look at the reporting in each of 
these countries, they are all based on 
conduct against people with LGBT 
leanings, and that is why the act was 
used. The State Department preserves 
confidentiality. 
b 1000 
So in the end, yes, we are using this 
act right now, today, to condemn and 
to sanction this activity against the 
LGBTQ communities around the world. 
So I oppose the en bloc of amendments. 
While some of the amendments are 
well-intentioned, they are ultimately 
duplicative and unnecessary, again, 
just like the underlying act. They re-
quire the Department of State to do 
what it is already doing in practice. 
For example, the Gottheimer amend-
ment No. 2 requires a study examining 
risks to LGBTQI individuals. The State 
Department publishes its annual Coun-
try Reports on Human Rights Practices 
each year, including this data, and 
they just provided another report re-
cently. 
Human rights officers who are sta-
tioned at our embassies and consulates 
around the world meet routinely with 
local activists and local officials to 
gain this information. They talk to in-
dividuals on the ground to compile 
these reports, which are detailed and 
comprehensive. Each regional bureau 
in the Department is involved in this 
process. This amendment, therefore, 
calls for the Department to do what it 
is already doing, and is burdensome on 
the Foreign Service officers and career 
officials. 
Other amendments, like the Harder 
amendment No. 7, also very well-inten-
tioned and also messaging in a very 
positive way, show that the Democrats 
know they have overreached on the 
bill. The Harder amendment prevents 
sanctions against any individual based 
solely upon religious belief. 
I agree with this sentiment, but at 
markup, Democrats rejected a very 
similar religious freedom and free 
speech amendment offered by Rep-
resentative SCOTT PERRY. The ration-
ale was: Well, this bill just isn’t about 
that. Well, it seems one of their col-
leagues disagrees. 
While I appreciate the Democrats are 
willing to acknowledge some of the 
flaws in the bill, the Harder amend-
ment is also insufficient. The amend-
ment speaks only of religious belief. It 
does not speak to situations in which 
religious adherents manifest or express 
their beliefs in daily life. 
So under Representative HARDER’s 
amendment, a person who expresses be-
lief in the traditional family, or in con-
ventional human biology, could still be 
sanctioned because sanctions would 
not be based on beliefs but, rather, on 
actions. 
This amendment is not as robust as 
the 
measure 
that 
Representative 
PERRY put forward at markup, and we 
have no choice but to oppose it. 
This en bloc does not contain amend-
ments that would enhance the legisla-
tion, in our opinion. Instead, these 
amendments seek to add safeguards to 
a bill that, as I have explained, is du-
plicative, unnecessary, and even dan-
gerous insofar as it can be used by the 
left to target political opponents in the 
international culture wars. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from Georgia (Ms. WIL-
LIAMS). 
Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in support of my 
amendment 
to 
proactively 
prevent 
human rights abuses against LGBTQI 
individuals. 
As the Congresswoman representing 
the LGBTQI capital of the South, this 
amendment is just another way that 
my district is leading the way to 
achieve human rights and equity for 
all. Decades of advocacy, from Atlan-
ta’s first gay pride march in 1971, to an-
nual events like Black Pride and 
Southern Fried Queer Pride have made 
Atlanta the city ‘‘too busy to hate.’’ 
Atlanta gets a perfect score from the 
Human Rights Campaign, and the com-
munity that the Black and LGBTQ- 
plus activists have created in Atlanta 
is the kind of world that we want ev-
erywhere. At home, we have a saying, 
‘‘Atlanta influences everything,’’ and 
my amendment is designed to do just 
that by extending human rights protec-
tions beyond my city and our Nation’s 
borders. 
With my amendment, the State De-
partment will study how it can better 
coordinate internationally to prevent 
international 
human 
rights 
abuses 
based on sexual orientation, gender 
identity, and sex characteristics before 
those abuses occur. This will create a 
better world for everyone no matter 
where they live, who they love, or how 
they identify. 
Ms. TENNEY. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
am prepared to close. 
Ms. TENNEY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back balance of my time. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
just want to respond quickly to two 
things before I close. The first is, 
again, the Global Respect Act, like 
Magnitsky, does not punish and cannot 
be invoked for speech. It is very clear. 
It has never been used in that way, and 
it specifically targets conduct. But out 
of an abundance of caution, to reassure 
our colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle, Mr. HARDER offers an amendment 
that makes that explicit, that says 
that no one will be sanctioned due to 
their religious beliefs. Instead, only 
those who commit egregious acts of vi-
olence, including: torture, enforced dis-
appearance, or extrajudicial killings 
will be denied entry into the United 
States. 
This notion of like, well, we were 
concerned about this religion issue, but 
when it is explicitly addressed because 
it is offered by a Democrat through the

amendment process and not a Repub-
lican, it doesn’t satisfy my friends on 
the other side of the aisle. It is very 
disappointing; very disappointing. 
This Global Respect Act legislation 
is designed to address a real problem, 
and I will just say one last time, in sec-
tion 3 of the bill, the language in the 
bill includes gross violations of inter-
nationally recognized human rights as 
codified in 22 U.S.C. 2304. What is that? 
Not your view on marriage, not wheth-
er you like someone. It is defined as: 
‘‘. . . torture or cruel, inhuman, or de-
grading treatment or punishment, pro-
longed detention without charges and 
trial, causing the disappearance of per-
sons by the abduction and clandestine 
detention of those persons, and other 
flagrant denial of the right to life, lib-
erty, or the security of person.’’ 
This is a well-established definition 
for gross human rights violations. This 
bill simply says, if you engage in that 
kind of behavior, you do not have a 
right to enter the United States of 
America. We will deny you a visa be-
cause we stand for human rights. 
So I urge my colleagues to support 
the en bloc amendment, support this 
bill, be proud today that the United 
States is standing again for the protec-
tion of human rights of all people here 
in the United States, and around the 
world. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

REMOVAL OF NAME OF MEMBER 
AS COSPONSOR OF H.R. 1440 
Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I here-
by remove my name as cosponsor of 
H.R. 1440. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
CARTER
of Louisiana). The gentle-
woman’s request is accepted. 
f 
SUPPORT AMERICAN ECONOMIC 
COMPETITIVENESS 
(Ms. UNDERWOOD asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, in-
vesting 
in 
innovation 
is 
vital 
to 
strengthening America’s economic and 
national security. That is why I sup-
ported the America COMPETES Act of 
2022, which makes a historic invest-
ment in American technology and in-
novation. 
This bipartisan bill addresses 21st 
century challenges by turbocharging 
the 
domestic 
production 
of 
semi-
conductors, increasing the manufac-
turing workforce, and investing in 
STEM education. I am proud that my 
amendment, which creates partner-
ships with local industries to tailor 
STEM education to local economic 
needs, was included in the House 
version of the bill. 
This amendment will broaden the 
scope of STEM education and offer new 
opportunities in rural communities 
like much of my district. With trans-
formative investments in some of Illi-
nois’ biggest industries, like manufac-
turing, education, energy, and bio-
technology, the America COMPETES 
Act will strengthen the STEM pipeline 
in my district and across the country. 
I am proud of this bipartisan effort to 
support American economic competi-
tiveness and urge my Senate colleagues 
to act quickly to send this legislation 
to the President’s desk. 
f 
FENTANYL CRISIS 
(Mr. HARRIS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Speaker, we sur-
passed 100,000 overdose deaths this 
year, 
a 
28 
percent 
increase. 
The 
amount of fentanyl seized at our south-
ern border—seized—is over 100 million 
pills and 11,000 pounds. Now, as a physi-
cian who has administered fentanyl, 
this is enough to kill hundreds of mil-
lions of Americans. The price of heroin 
is now down to $20 a dose; the price of 
fentanyl down to $2. 
One stunning supply chain success 
this administration has under its belt 
is the fentanyl supply chain across our 
southern border. One place this admin-
istration has successfully fought infla-
tion is in lowering the price of illegal 
opioids on our streets. 
The latest effort by this administra-
tion to promote drug use is now to 
spend $30 million to supply clean 
crack-smoking pipes to addicts. 
Mr. Speaker, just say no.

b 1200 
ACTING ON HUMANITARIAN CRISIS 
IN SYRIA 
(Ms. NEWMAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. NEWMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today because there is a humanitarian 
crisis in Syria right now. For the past 
2 years, there have been tens of thou-
sands of Syrians in the Rukban settle-
ment suffering from not only starva-
tion but a lack of medical care. 
The last remaining UNICEF clinic in 
this encampment closed in March 2020, 
right at the onset of the global pan-
demic. Since then, thousands in the 
camp have tested positive but have no-
where to quarantine. They don’t have 
access to vaccines. They don’t have ac-
cess to medical care. They do not have 
access to clean water. 
With Russia and the Assad regimes 
preventing aid from reaching the camp, 
I am calling on the U.S. to implore im-
mediate action to intervene and help. 
We have a fundamental obligation to 
save thousands of Syrian lives. 
f 
CONGRATULATING 
SHARON 
HUGHES FOR 20 YEARS OF SERV-
ICE 
(Mr. DAVIDSON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate and thank Shar-
on Hughes for her 20 years of service to 
the Eighth District of Ohio. 
Sharon was born in Marion, Ohio, and 
attended Bowling Green State Univer-
sity. She worked for Congressman John 
Boehner from 2002 to 2016, and she has 
been a dedicated staff member in my 
office since 2016. She served as a case-
worker and office manager, and also di-
rected the military academy nomina-
tion process with excellence, and the 
Congressional Art Competition with 
excellence as well. 
Outside of her congressional work, 
she also served in several leadership 
roles for the Butler Philharmonic Or-
chestra. 
During her 20 years of service to the 
Eighth District of Ohio, Sharon has 
made a difference in the lives of count-
less constituents, including assisting in

well-earned retirement.

REMEMBERING BRIGADIER 
GENERAL CHARLES MCGEE 
(Ms. PRESSLEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in honor and remembrance of 
legendary retired Air Force Brigadier 
General Charles McGee, who peacefully 
departed on the morning of January 16, 
2022. He was 102 years young and one of 
the last surviving Tuskegee Airmen. 
Charles McGee lived a full and beau-
tiful life of bravery and perseverance. 
He was the embodiment of hope and 
service. 
As a Tuskegee Airman, he made his-
tory as one of the first Black military 
aviators, breaking the color barrier in 
the armed services during World War II 
and flying 409 fighter combat missions 
in three wars. 
In addition to his life of service, Mr. 
McGee created an enduring legacy 
through the family that he grew. He 
married the love of his life, Ms. 
Frances Nelson, in April 1942. The two 
would go on to be married for more 
than 50 years. 
He is survived by his 3 children, 
Charlene, 
Ronald, 
and 
Yvonne; 
10 
grandchildren; 14 great-grandchildren; 
and 1 great-great-grandchild. 
Black history is American history, 
and Charles McGee is an American 
hero. General McGee’s legacy will live 
on through the pages of our history, 
the incredible family he created, and 
the lives he touched, including my 
own. 
Mr. Speaker, to our General, our be-
loved Papa Gee, I pray that he rests in 
peace and power, reunited with his 
love, Frances, with the wind forever at 
his back and the clearest blue skies 
ahead.

REMEMBERING DWIGHT L. 
CLEMENTS 
(Mr. FORTENBERRY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. FORTENBERRY. Mr. Speaker, 
today, I would like to speak about a 
great Nebraskan and a great American. 
His name is Dwight L. Clements. He 
died last week at 102 years old. 
Dwight Clements was born in Elm-
wood, Nebraska, and he went on to 
study at the University of Nebraska 
and got a degree in business. 
But this is the interesting part, Mr. 
Speaker: His education was disrupted 
by World War II, where he served as an 
Army combat engineer in France until 
the war ended in 1945. 
After the war, Dwight earned his law 
degree at the University of Nebraska 
and then returned to small-town Elm-
wood to work at the family-owned 
American Exchange Bank and to join 
the law firm with his father, Clements 
Law Firm. He continued in banking 
and law until he retired in 1985. 
But this is the point, Mr. Speaker: 
Dwight Clements was a humble, duti-
ful, small-town Nebraskan. But as a 
member of the Greatest Generation, he 
served something far larger than him-
self. Through his sense of duty, self-
lessness, sacrifice, and patriotism, he 
represented the kind of person that not 
only holds Nebraska together but holds 
America together. 
May he rest in peace.

RECOGNIZING THORNTON FIRE 
DEPARTMENT 
(Mr. PERLMUTTER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize and honor the 
Thornton Fire Department in Thorn-
ton, Colorado, for earning the 2021 Con-
gressional Fire Services Institute’s 
Masimo Excellence in Fire Service- 
Based EMS Award, which is given an-
nually to the top fire department in 
the country. 
Throughout the COVID–19 pandemic, 
the Thornton Fire Department has 
gone above and beyond to serve their 
community. As part of their efforts, 
they created a Pandemic Response 
Team that has conducted over 20,000 
COVID tests for public employees, sen-
ior citizens, first responders, and other 
community members. When vaccines 
became available, the Pandemic Re-
sponse Team expanded their services to 
administer over 80,000 vaccinations at 
drive-through sites for city employees 
and other community members. 
The Pandemic Response Team’s suc-
cess led other fire agencies around the 
country to look to Thornton as a 
model for how to effectively respond to 
the challenges of COVID–19. 
In a very difficult year for fire and 
emergency services, the Thornton Fire 
Department’s innovative approach to a 
rapidly changing public health crisis is 
something we should all thank them 
for and model. 
f 
FACING FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC 
WEAKNESS 
(Mr. CAREY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CAREY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today as our Nation faces major for-
eign and domestic challenges brought 
on by the weakness of the Biden ad-
ministration. 
The border crisis, the botched with-
drawal from Afghanistan, the failure to 
hold China accountable, the green- 
lighting of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, 
and ‘‘minor incursion’’ remarks have 
sent signals of weakness to our global 
adversaries. That weakness is now 
being tested as Russian aggression 
threatens the sovereignty of our stra-
tegic partners in Ukraine. 
This threat to Ukraine is also a 
threat to democracy. Ukraine needs 
our support to defend itself. That 
means sending a strong signal by sup-
porting more military and security 
equipment, as well as immediate finan-
cial, economic, and energy sanctions 
against the Russians. 
At this time, our national sov-
ereignty has been betrayed by the ad-
ministration. Illegal immigrants and 
drugs are flowing across the southern 
border at a record pace. 
We must act to secure our borders 
and support Ukraine. Failure to do so 
will weaken our national security for 
years to come. 
f 
ADDRESSING AMERICA’S 
FENTANYL CRISIS 
(Mr. DEUTCH asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, last year, 
more than 100,000 Americans died from 
drug overdoses, 60 percent of them 
from fentanyl. These were mothers and 
fathers. They were relatives, neighbors, 
friends. One was my nephew Eli. 
Eli 
died 
from 
an 
unintentional 
fentanyl overdose, using a legal herbal 
supplement that had been laced with 
fentanyl. He would have turned 21 to-
morrow. 
What happened to Eli is not unique. 
Young people on social media who 
think that they are buying Adderall or 
Xanax are being sold fentanyl-contami-
nated counterfeits. 
It is the responsibility of every Mem-
ber of Congress to acknowledge that 
fentanyl is killing our constituents ev-
erywhere in America. 
We know that the chemicals to de-
velop these drugs originate in China. 
They are shipped to Mexico and flood 
our country. 
We know that social platforms are 
capable of changing their algorithms to 
cut dealers’ access to buyers, and we 
know that fentanyl test strips save 
lives but remain illegal in too many 
States. 
Mr. Speaker, we can address these 
challenges. It is how we ensure that 
our kids, other kids like Eli, aren’t lost 
and don’t miss the opportunity to cele-
brate their 21st birthday.

RECOGNIZING TURNER SYNDROME 
AWARENESS MONTH 
(Mr. FEENSTRA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. FEENSTRA. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Turner Syndrome 
Awareness Month and my constituent, 
Nicole Cleveland, for bringing atten-
tion to this little-known disease. 
At birth, Nicole was diagnosed with 
TS and was told she may never walk.

She did. Nicole was told that she would 
never go to college. She did. She grad-
uated from Morningside University 
with a degree in political science and 
journalism. 
But Nicole did not stop there. She 
went on to be the youngest woman ever 
elected to the Sergeant Bluff City 
Council and will be releasing her first 
book this spring called ‘‘The Butterfly 
Chronicles.’’ 
Now, she commits her time and tal-
ent to advocating for the more than 
70,000 American women and girls who 
have TS. 
In conjunction with her advocacy, I 
will soon be introducing a bill, the Pro-
tecting Girls with Turner Syndrome 
Act, to criminalize the abortion of any 
baby diagnosed with TS because my 
faith teaches me that every person is 
created for a purpose, and Nicole was 
certainly created as a special one. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Nicole for 
bringing awareness of TS and sharing 
her message of optimism and hope with 
so many people. 
f 
EXTENDING THE CHILD TAX 
CREDIT 
(Ms. BROWN of Ohio asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to call for an extension of 
the critical child tax credit. 
Here is the truth: Before expiring at 
the end of 2021, the expanded child tax 
credit was working. Payments lowered 
hunger. They kept nearly 4 million 
children out of poverty. And they 
helped countless people make ends 
meet. 
The child tax credit was a critical 
lifeline for more than 35 million Amer-
ican families. This includes more than 
70,000 in my district, which has some of 
the highest poverty in America. 
Shaneice, a mother of three from 
Cleveland, used the payments to pay 
rent and afford basic necessities. But 
now, 2 months after the payments 
stopped, Shaneice says she is just get-
ting by, and she is looking for side jobs 
to support her family. 
It is time to extend the child tax 
credit. We cannot—we must not—let 
families down. 
f 
CATCHING BENGALS FEVER 
(Mr. CHABOT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, greater 
Cincinnati is in the grips of Bengals 
fever. 
From pep rallies at Paul Brown Sta-
dium, to celebrations at bars and res-
taurants, and at home, to wall-to-wall 
coverage on the nightly news, everyone 
is celebrating the Bengals’ third trip to 
the Super Bowl. 
In that spirit, the city of Cheviot, on 
Cincinnati’s west side, just renamed a 
number of streets after Bengals play-
ers. Cheviot residents will be driving 
down Joe Burrow Way rather than Har-
rison Avenue and Chase Drive instead 
of Glenmore Avenue. 
It reminds me of the last time the 
Bengals went to the Super Bowl, back 
in 1989. Yes, it has been a while. We 
faced legendary 49ers quarterback Joe 
Montana for the second time at the 
Super Bowl. I was on the Cincinnati 
City Council at the time, and Montana 
Avenue became Esiason Street—that is 
Boomer Esiason, the Bengals quarter-
back—all in good fun, of course. 
Well done, Cheviot. And I will just 
close with this: Who Dey. 
f 
CELEBRATING MINNESOTA 
WINTERS 
(Mr. PHILLIPS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, Min-
nesota is known for our winters. Most 
think we endure them, but the truth is, 
we celebrate them. From ice fishing to 
pond hockey to skiing, we love our 
snow and ice. 
That is why I rise today to honor the 
23 
Minnesotans 
representing 
Team 
USA at this year’s winter games. 
Despite a population of under 6 mil-
lion people, Minnesota sent more ath-
letes to the Olympics than 49 of our 50 
States and 61 of the 91 nations at the 
Olympics. 
Five of those athletes hail from the 
district I represent, Minnesota’s Fro-
zen 
Third, 
including 
Jake 
Brown, 
Brock Faber, Dani Cameranesi, Grace 
Zumwinkle, and Kelly Pannek. 
This is the first winter games in his-
tory to rely on almost 100 percent arti-
ficial snow, and if climate change con-
tinues to accelerate, few cities in the 
world will have enough snow to host 
future Winter Olympic Games. 
Countless jobs in my district rely on 
snow and winter, like those at Strata 
Systems, which helped design the sleds 
for our luge team, and Polaris, the 
iconic snowmobile maker. We need to 
keep the North cold all around the 
world, and I invite my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to help us do so.

CALIFORNIA’S HIGH-SPEED RAIL 
COSTS HAVE SKYROCKETED 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, Califor-
nia’s high-speed rail has issued a new 
draft business plan for the year 2022 
that was released yesterday. It shows 
now a new price tag of $105 billion, 
which is an increase of $5 billion over 
the last plan we just received not too 
long ago. 
Now, the original price that voters 
agreed to back in 2008 when it was 
placed on the ballot in front of them 
was a $33 billion, not $105 billion, plan. 
Notably, it will now install a second 
rail between the towns of Merced and 
Bakersfield. Two tracks; two tracks 
that won’t actually travel at high 
speeds because they can’t get up to 
speed in that amount of distance. Two 
tracks that will be calling, I guess, 
ghost passengers for people that aren’t 
going to be using this project anyway 
between Bakersfield and Merced. 
Every transit agency in the country 
ought to be looking at this plan to see 
how it works. We need to be building 
water storage; we need to be spending 
money on forestry, because our forests 
burn every year, instead of this boon-
doggle, which continues to be a rat 
hole of good money for a project that 
isn’t helping anybody.

REMEMBERING CAROLYN 
COLEMAN 
(Ms. MANNING asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. MANNING. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in honor of the late Commis-
sioner 
Carolyn 
Coleman, 
a 
loving 
mother, grandmother, and a remark-
able trailblazer for civil rights. 
She had a lifelong commitment to 
activism, from her first heroic actions 
at the Savannah sit-in, to her years of 
advising Governor Hunt on legislation 
to benefit minorities. She made history 
as Guilford County’s first African- 
American chairwoman in 2005, where 
she continued to serve her community 
for the next two decades. 
Commissioner 
Coleman 
recently 
earned the North Carolina Association 
of Black County Officials Frederick 
Douglass award for her work feeding 
the community during the pandemic, a 
testament to her unwavering commit-
ment to service. 
She was never the center of atten-
tion, but when she spoke, all eyes im-
mediately went to her. Her thoughtful 
words had the power to change minds 
and encourage others to join her calls 
to action. Her influence made a con-
sistent and admirable impact on the 
community. 
Carolyn Coleman paved the way for 
progress, with a kind heart and a re-
lentless spirit. She will be deeply 
missed by the Triad community, but 
she leaves behind an incredible legacy 
and a loving family. May her memory 
be a blessing for all who knew her.

PRESSURE TO USE CERTAIN 
COVID DRUGS 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, as we 
break here for a recess, it is important 
to remember that COVID is still a very 
serious threat, and a little under 2,000 
people a day are dying of it. 
I have been contacted by medical 
professionals in my district who feel 
there is too much pressure to use

remdesivir and not enough opportunity 
to 
use 
ivermectin 
or 
hydroxychloroquine to treat this hor-
rific disease. This is unprecedented 
that people would step in. 
As I understand it, hospitals are bill-

but they may be getting under $50 or 
$60

The combination of doctors being

be looking into, and it is something I 
think our Oversight and Reform Com-
mittee should be looking into. 
I hope if anybody is paying attention, 
you pick up on this story and see what 
the real background is. I am not an ex-
pert on the topic, but experts on the 
topic do believe that people are dying 
unnecessarily.

AMERICA MUST STAND WITH 
KOSOVO 
(Mr. TORRES of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, I proudly stand before you to 
celebrate the 14th independence of 
Kosovo, one of the world’s youngest na-
tions. 
Rising from the ruins of ethnic 
cleansing at the murderous hands of 
one of the worst dictators in the 20th 
century, Kosovo has built a burgeoning 
democracy in whose heart the United 
States holds a special place. 
Indeed, the U.S. has no greater friend 
in southeast Europe than Kosovo, and 
Kosovo should have no greater friend 
in the world than the U.S. We owe it to 
that friendship, as well as to the great-
er cause of democracy, to stand firmly 
with Kosovo as it seeks universal rec-
ognition from the international com-
munity and membership in both the 
EU and NATO. 
The time has come for Kosovo to be 
given the full respect and recognition 
that an independent country deserves. 
The United States must stand with 
those that not only stand with America 
but also stand for America. Kosovo 
stands for the American vision of a 
more democratic world. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF HAVEN J. 
BARLOW 
(Mr. MOORE of Utah asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MOORE of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the life and legacy 
of Haven J. Barlow. Utah lost a com-
munity giant who lived to be 100 years 
old. It is hard to believe, but Haven’s 
life was nearly cut short when at just 9 
months old, a train struck the Model T 
Ford he was riding in, killing his moth-
er and three other passengers. 
Fortunately, he survived, and he 
lived a life full of service to others. 
Haven served our country as a Navy en-
sign in World War II and was the long-
est-serving State legislator in Utah 
history, first elected in 1953 and served 
until 1995. 
Haven’s service to Utah and Davis 
County is immeasurable, where he 
spent much of his time focused on mat-
ters pertaining to education. He led the 
fight to establish and fund the first 
State vocational institution in Davis 
County, now Davis Technical College, 
the establishment of Weber State/Davis 
campus, and Utah’s creation of the 
weighted pupil index (WPU), ensuring a 
child can get the same level of edu-
cation regardless of where they lived. 
In addition, Haven helped establish 
the Hill Aerospace Museum, the Free-
port Center, the restoration of Utah’s 
Governor’s mansion, and was behind 
the original Utah Symphony Endow-
ment Fund. 
Haven was married to Bonnie Rae 
Ellison for 58 years before her passing, 
and raised six children. He is a Utah 
legend, and we honor him in his pass-
ing.

HUMAN DIGNITY IS A BASIC 
HUMAN RIGHT 
(Ms. LEE of California asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to celebrate the passage of 
the Global Respect Act. I thank Con-
gressman CICILLINE for sponsoring this 
legislation and also Chairman MEEKS 
and the Speaker for bringing it to the 
floor. 
Human dignity is a basic human 
right, yet LGBTQ individuals are often 
targets for harassment, violence, and 
even death, simply based on their sex-
ual orientation or gender identity. 
As chair of the State, Foreign Oper-
ations Appropriations Subcommittee, I 
am committed to protecting and pro-
moting the human rights and dignity 
of all people, especially those who are 
marginalized 
and 
most 
vulnerable, 
such as LGBTQ individuals. 
I am so proud that in the House FY22 
SFOPS bill we provided $15 million for 
the Global Equality Fund at the State 
Department and $10 million for the pro-
tection of LGBTQ persons at USAID. 
The Global Respect Act will ensure 
that the administration has the tools 
it needs to advance the rights of all 
human beings, regardless of who they 
are or who they love. This bill upholds 
our core values of tolerance and com-
passion for our fellow human beings. I 
want to congratulate this body for vot-
ing for this bill today.

HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I, 
too, rise in strong support of H.R. 3485, 
the Global Respect Act of 2021, which 
mandates a listing of and visa restric-
tions on foreign persons responsible for 
or complicit in human rights violations 
against 
lesbian, 
gay, 
bisexual, 
transgender, 
queer, 
and 
intersex 
(LGBTQI) persons. 
It is very difficult for these individ-
uals to suffer what they suffer. This 
community, of course, faces discrimi-
nation, violence, and bigotry all over 
the world. Sixty-eight countries crim-
inalize 
same-sex 
sexual 
relations, 
which means that more than one-third 
of the United Nations’ member states 
criminalize consenting adult and same- 
sex sexual relations. It includes nation- 
states in Africa. In up to nine coun-
tries, same-sex sexual relations may be 
punishable by death, and so-called 
anti-LGBTQ-plus propaganda laws in-
hibit LGBTQ-plus advocacy in at least 
three countries. 
Let me thank Mr. CICILLINE and the 
leadership for putting this bill forward. 
This is a bipartisan bill with a list of 
foreign individuals found responsible 
for human rights violations against 
this community. 
I am supporting this bill because it 
has teeth because it requires denial of 
and limitations on visas. Let me ask 
the Senate to pass Global Respect Act, 
H.R. 3485.

BLACK HISTORY MONTH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from South 
Carolina (Mr. CLYBURN) is recognized 
for 60 minutes as the designee of the 
majority leader. 
Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 
minutes to the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN.) 
JANUARY 6 WOUNDS MUST HEAL 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the distinguished majority whip 
for yielding me the time and for his 
commitment to justice and all nec-
essary to make this country a better 
place for everybody. 
Mr. Speaker, some say that time 
heals all wounds. In the hours right 
after the January 6 attack, I was hope-
ful that with time America might 
begin to heal, too; that in the wake of 
such a dastardly attack on our democ-
racy, Republicans would recoil in dis-
gust at what they had created; that 
after the President of the United 
States whipped a violent mob into a 
frenzy and sent them here to attack 
Congress, 
they 
might 
finally 
say 
enough is enough. 
That didn’t happen, and it is not 
going to. The Republican National 
Committee just called January 6 ‘‘le-
gitimate political discourse.’’ Legiti-
mate political discourse? They had 
lead pipes and guns. They destroyed 
property and beat cops. Give me a 
break. 
Sadly, this is just their latest at-
tempt to rewrite history. Last year 
they called January 6, ‘‘a normal tour-
ist visit.’’ They continue obstructing 
the January 6th Select Committee.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1093 
February 9, 2022 
They continue spreading the big lie 
that the election was stolen despite 
overwhelming, 
incontrovertible 
evi-
dence that it wasn’t. 
The former President again promised 
to pardon those who engaged in vio-
lence if he assumes office again. This 
week we learned that he considered 
using the military to seize ballot 
boxes. Now, there is a sentence that 
sends a chill down my spine. 
I credit Leader MCCONNELL, who re-
buked his party this week. He said Jan-
uary 6 was ‘‘a violent insurrection for 
the purpose of trying to prevent the 
peaceful transfer of power.’’ But he is 
the exception. 
For a majority of Republicans, things 
have not changed. They have stayed 
the same, stuck in a QAnon fever 
dream, waiting at the beck and call of 
a twice-impeached ex-President who 
has spent his retirement shredding evi-
dence at Mar-a-Lago. Time has not 
stiffened their spines. It hasn’t jolted 
them into reality or brought us to-
gether like we were in the aftermath of 
the 9/11 attacks. 
January 6 hasn’t become a turning 
point. Instead, it has become a talking 
point. This is the new Republican re-
ality. To gain support from the ex- 
President, you have to repeat a lie that 
the election was stolen, and to main-
tain the support of the Republican 
Party, you have to repeat another lie, 
that January 6 wasn’t a violent upris-
ing against America. 
There is a word for that, Mr. Speak-
er. It is called fascism, and it is a jar-
ring word, one I don’t use lightly. So 
let me be clear exactly how I mean it. 
Fascism isn’t about a particular set of 
beliefs or political ideology. It is about 
power and the lengths to which some 
people will go to acquire and retain it. 
For decades, America fought against 
fascism, but today a growing move-
ment here at home seeks to upend 
norms, settle disagreement with vio-
lence, and silence the truth. 
‘‘Free societies,’’ American philoso-
pher Jason Stanley says, ‘‘require 
truth, and so to smash freedom, you 
must smash truth.’’ 
So let me say this plainly: The elec-
tion was not stolen. Trump-appointed 
judges say it was not stolen. Repub-
lican-led investigations say it was not 
stolen. Republican officials responsible 
for counting votes say it wasn’t stolen. 
If you are an elected official and you 
continue smashing the truth, even 
after all that we have learned about 
what happened on January 6, you are 
supporting fascism. 
What is happening is not new. Even 
the earliest philosopher saw that de-
mocracies are particularly susceptible 
to tyranny. There is no reason to be-
lieve it can’t happen here. 
What is special about America isn’t 
the strength of our institutions alone, 
it is the strength and courage of the 
people willing to stand up and fight for 
them. And that is why I am glad the 
January 6th Select Committee is doing 
its work. I am grateful President Biden 
isn’t falling for false claims of execu-
tive privilege by the ex-President de-
signed to cover up what went on. And I 
am proud of the people who keep show-
ing up day in and day out despite going 
through hell that day, from congres-
sional staff to the administrative staff, 
to cafeteria workers, to the cleaning 
crews, to the Capitol Police. Each of 
you is playing a vital role in defending 
our democracy. 
b 1230 
But make no mistake, we are stand-
ing on the precipice. 
When we spend hours and hours de-
bating 
whether 
State 
legislatures 
should be allowed to nullify ballots; 
when politicians call an attempt to 
violently overthrow the United States 
Government ‘‘legitimate political dis-
course,’’ we are in a dangerous spot. 
The insurrection, conspiracy theo-
ries, the big lie, voter suppression, they 
are all branches on the same tree. 
And at the root of all of it is power. 
Now, I don’t have a magic wand to 
make it better, I have a warning: Time 
won’t heal our wounds or reign in fas-
cism in America. That is why we must 
demand the truth. 
If we don’t, the people who are trying 
to normalize what happened on Janu-
ary 6 won’t be dismissed. They will be 
empowered. 
God help us all, and God help the 
United States of America if that hap-
pens. 
Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for his comments. 
Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor 
today to discuss some other theories 
and to honor this month, Black History 
Month, with first an announcement. 
Last year, the Governor of Kentucky 
wrote President Biden asking him to 
promote Colonel Charles Young to 
brigadier general. 
Charles Young is not a name that 
most people in the country probably 
recognize. Charles was a ‘‘buffalo sol-
dier.’’ He was the third African Amer-
ican to graduate from West Point. And 
stories 
are 
legendary 
as 
to 
what 
Charles went through. 
Charles was born a son of slaves back 
in 1864 in Kentucky, but he rose and 
went into the military at the urging of 
his father and performed heroically. 
However, for obvious reasons, he was 
stuck at lieutenant colonel and never 
got the promotion which he deserved. 
So, posthumously, last week, the De-
fense Department, upon the request of 
the Governor of Kentucky—and I was 
pleased to write a letter to the Presi-
dent in support of that request— 
Charles was promoted to general. I 
thank the Defense Department for re-
pairing that fault. 
Now, Mr. Speaker, Black History 
Month started out back in 1926. It was 
started by Dr. Carter G. Woodson and 
the Association for the Study of Negro 
Life and History. 
Now, Dr. Woodson is known by most 
of us as the father of Black history. Dr. 
Woodson had some strong feelings 
about the contributions that African 
Americans were making to this great 
country that were going untold and in-
tentionally ignored. So Dr. Woodson 
and the association lobbied for a week 
to focus the country’s attention on the 
contributions of Black Americans. He 
was successful, and as I said, in 1926, 
the week was established. 
Now, back in the sixties, many col-
lege campuses had a lot of activity 
going on on those campuses, and I am 
very familiar with some of them, but 
one of the things that came up was this 
focus on the contributions of African 
Americans. And so a movement started 
on these campuses. They decided—in 
fact, quite frankly, I believe Kent Uni-
versity was the first university that 
decided—that it would just celebrate 
and focus on African-American history 
for the entire month of February, that 
a week was not enough. 
Now, we hear a lot of stories about 
February being the shortest month of 
the year and why that was set aside for 
the study of Black history. Well, the 
fact of the matter is, the number of 
days in the month had nothing to do 
with it. It was all about 2 days in the 
month of February. 
When the agreement was made to cel-
ebrate Black History Month, Carter G. 
Woodson and the association picked 
February because February 12 was the 
birthday of Abraham Lincoln, and Feb-
ruary 14 was the birthday of Frederick 
Douglass. So to embrace both of those 
birthdays, they picked a week in Feb-
ruary that encompassed the two days. 
That is how it got to be February. 
And then, of course, with the agita-
tion on the college campuses, they 
started a tradition of celebrating the 
whole month. And, of course, in 1969 
the activity took place up at Kent, and 
in 1976 President Gerald Ford decided 
to officially recognize the month of 
February as Black History Month. 
That is how we got to this point. And 
every President since has followed suit. 
Now, today, the teaching of Black 
history has taken on a new meaning in 
this polarized country that we are cur-
rently experiencing. The publication, 
Education Week, reports that since 
January 2021—so 13 months—14 States 
led by Republican Governors, Florida, 
Georgia, Alabama, South Carolina, Vir-
ginia, 
Tennessee, 
Utah, 
Oklahoma, 
Texas, Iowa, New Hampshire, North 
Dakota, Montana, and Idaho have all 
imposed restrictions or bans on teach-
ing about racial issues. And legislation 
is currently pending in another 23 
States. 
Black History Month, as I just indi-
cated, was established officially by a 
Republican President, Gerald Ford, but 
we have become so polarized and this 
has become so politicized that in the 
last 13 months, 14 States led by Repub-
lican Governors have imposed restric-
tions or bans on teaching about racial 
issues. 
These States claim to be protecting 
the K–12 students from being taught 
critical race theory, or as we have seen

in some publications, things that make 
White children uncomfortable. 
I would like to remind all of us, espe-
cially my friends on the other side of 
the aisle, that theory is part of the 
higher education experience and is not 
part of any curriculum in K–12. In-
stead, these students are being taught 
facts, what I call critical race facts. 
Now, all of us are aware of the con-
tributions of people like Rosa Parks, 
Martin Luther King, Jr., Harriet Tub-
man, and none of us seem to be uncom-
fortable with knowing about these peo-
ple. But, Mr. Speaker, there are a lot of 
other people of color who have made 
significant contributions to the growth 
and development of this great country 
that have been intentionally left out of 
our history books. And for some 
strange reason, people seem to feel 
that students will be uncomfortable 
learning about those contributions. It 
is important to the full development of 
all children to be taught exactly what 
this country is all about. 
Let me offer a few examples of what 
I am talking about here. In fact, I 
opened up Black History Month this 
year speaking to students over at Gon-
zaga High School. And in that speech, 
as I have done on this floor, I looked up 
at the lights, and I talked to those stu-
dents a little bit about the person that 
history records as responsible for the 
light bulb: Thomas Edison. Nobody ar-
gues with that. We are very com-
fortable with knowing that, reading 
about that in the history books, and 
studying about Thomas Edison that 
many of us call ‘‘the greatest inventor 
of all times.’’ 
But the fact of the matter is that 
Thomas Edison did invent the light 
bulb, but a very critical, unknown fact 
to most people is that he could not get 
the light bulb to work. He could get it 
to come on, but he couldn’t get it to 
stay on. And it was not until someone 
told Thomas Edison about an African 
American, a young man, the son of 
former slaves—his parents had escaped 
from slavery, and they were living up 
in Massachusetts—this young man was 
totally different from Thomas Edison; 
his name was Lewis Latimer. 
Thomas Edison was informed that 
this light bulb that he couldn’t get to 
stay on, this guy up in Massachusetts 
might be able to solve his problem, if 
he could just step outside of his com-
fort zone. Oh, it may be uncomfortable, 
but if you can step outside of your 
comfort zone and sit down with Lewis 
Latimer, this man has invented a fila-
ment that might make your light bulb 
work. 
Thomas Edison decided to do that. 
He wanted to light the world. He was 
having problems. For some reason he 
could not get it done. 
b 1245 
So he went up to Massachusetts and 
he sat down with Lewis Latimer. And 
sure enough, Lewis Latimer’s filament, 
when put inside of Thomas Edison’s 
light bulb, it worked. And together, 
they lit the world. 
It should not be uncomfortable for 
people to know about Lewis Latimer. 
That is not critical race theory. That 
is a critical racial fact that ought to be 
known by all children and adults. And 
what is wrong with teaching that in 
the classrooms? For some strange rea-
son, a lot of people feel that would be 
uncomfortable for children to learn. 
There are plenty other examples like 
that. I think today of another one, the 
steam engine. Nobody will argue about 
how important the steam engine was 
and still is to the industrial revolution. 
And if you ask people, most people 
from the books they have learned, who 
invented the steam engine, they will 
tell you Thomas Savery. And they 
would be correct. 
But when Thomas Savery invented 
the steam engine, it would overheat 
and they would have to cut the engine 
off. And sometimes in order to keep 
from cutting it off, they would employ 
a person they called an oiler. And that 
person’s job was to pour oil on this en-
gine so it would keep running. They 
would not have to shut it down. And it 
was a very dangerous job; some lost 
their limbs carrying out their duties. 
But there was a guy working in a 
similar situation who came up with an 
automatic oil pan. He designed a way 
for the engine to self-lubricate so he 
would not have to turn it off and lose 
production, so he would not have to 
employ a person who could lose a limb. 
That man’s name was Elijah McCoy, 
who also—according to my research— 
was the son of slaves. He was a prolific 
inventor. This was just one of the 
things that he invented. In fact, Elijah 
McCoy’s genius was so well-thought of 
and highly respected, and he had in-
vented so many things to make life 
better, to make production more prof-
itable, to make this country a better 
place. And out of respect for his genius, 
the stories are told that whenever any-
body came up with some gadget or 
something to make life easier, the 
question was asked often, ‘‘Is this a 
real McCoy?’’ It is very comfortable for 
people, even today, to use that phrase, 
ask that question: 
Is that the real McCoy? Are you the 
real McCoy? 
Why would it be so uncomfortable for 
children in the classroom to know that 
that iconic phrase came about as a re-
sult of the significant contribution to 
the human spirt, to the greatness of 
America 
by 
an 
African 
American 
named Elijah McCoy. Why is that to be 
uncomfortable? There is nothing that 
should be uncomfortable about that. 
I also think today about another Af-
rican American, Garrett A. Morgan. 
Now, all of us marvel at the gas mask. 
I remember as a child, the first time I 
saw one and experimented with how it 
worked, I had no idea of the origin of it 
at the time. In fact, if I were to read 
the books that were published, I still 
would not have known the real origin, 
because in the books, they would tell 
you that John Haldane, a Scottish in-
ventor who came to this country, and 
supposedly during World War I, in-
vented the first gas mask. 
But the critical fact is World War I 
started in 1914; ended in 1918. But in 
1911 or thereabouts, a man named Gar-
rett Morgan, also from Kentucky, he 
was born to a mother who was Native 
American and a father who was African 
American, who was also a former slave. 
Morgan, in 1914, at the beginning of 
World War I, invented the gas mask. 
And that gas mask was used in 1916 in 
New York City to save the lives of over 
500 people caught in some kind of an 
accident. Now, if you look at the cal-
endar, this was done before John Hal-
dane, whatever contraption he may 
have developed. 
Now the story of Garrett Morgan is 
kind of interesting and a little bit— 
maybe to some, I know to me—uncom-
fortable to think about. Because Gar-
rett Morgan experienced a lot of dif-
ficulty trying to sell his gas mask. And 
people wanted to use it for a big event 
in Cleveland, Ohio, people wanted the 
gas mask, but they wouldn’t buy it 
from him because of his color. 
So Garrett Morgan hired a White 
actor to pose as the inventor. And he 
went along with the inventor and he 
put the gas mask, the hood, on to dem-
onstrate it and, of course, to hide who 
he really was. That is how he was able 
to sell his gas mask. As effective as it 
was, as good of an invention that it 
was, they would not buy it from him 
simply because of his skin color. 
Now, that might have disappointed 
him, and it certainly should have, but 
he didn’t let that deter him. He went 
on with other inventions. And some 
know that it is Garrett A. Morgan that 
is credited with being the inventor of 
the traffic light. So these inventions 
that made life easier for people, made 
industrial 
plants 
more 
productive, 
made our streets safer, made our exist-
ence much more pleasant and much 
more conducive to reading, to getting 
around, all by African Americans. 
What is uncomfortable about teach-
ing this in our classrooms? What is so 
bad about children knowing this? Why 
shouldn’t the descendants of all three 
of these people, why shouldn’t their de-
scendants be made to feel proud of the 
contributions of their great, great, 
great—maybe 
more 
greats—grand-
father or great uncle or aunt. Why 
would anybody be uncomfortable with 
that? 
Mr. Speaker, that is not the only 
field this is in. I often talk about 
Charles Drew. When I was growing up, 
polio visited my neighborhood twice, 
leaving one of my playmates dead and 
another one crippled for life. And along 
came Jonas Salk and Albert Sabin, two 
men who happen to have been born 
white, two men who had a certain ge-
nius, who did significant research. Be-
cause of their genius and because of 
their great research, they were able to 
unlock some secrets. And together, 
they virtually eliminated polio from 
the face of the Earth. 
There 
is 
nothing 
uncomfortable 
about talking about that and people

learning about that. So why would it 
be uncomfortable for the guy who was 
able to unlock some secrets of the 
blood cells, Charles Drew, an African 
American, born right here in Wash-
ington, D.C., who because of his re-
search, he was able to figure out how 
to store blood, save it until it was 
needed. 
Blood spoils once it leaves the human 
body, but Charles Drew opened up the 
secrets and figured out how to store 
blood and save it until it was needed. 
Now, he has a pretty interesting his-
tory, also. 
b 1300 
Charles Drew headed up the blood 
bank. He went off to Europe to head up 
the blood bank, and his genius was rec-
ognized. 
It is kind of interesting because he 
resigned from the job. Why? Because 
they insisted that the blood coming 
from Black people had to be stored sep-
arately from the blood coming from 
White people. It sounds a little bit silly 
today, but that is what they did. 
Soldiers were dying on the battlefield 
because of the loss of blood. You have 
to take the time to figure out: Wait a 
minute. This is a Black soldier, so we 
have to find some blood from a Black 
person. 
Scientifically, it has been proven for-
ever that there ain’t no difference in 
the blood. 
Today, we don’t separate the blood 
anymore because we learned better. We 
have a little saying in the neighbor-
hood I grew up in: When a person 
learns better, a person will do better. 
Well, I am hoping that we will take a 
little time to learn better about the 
history of African Americans. Maybe if 
we did, we will do better. 
Now, I don’t want to leave here with-
out bringing up another incident be-
cause this is one that bugs me a little 
bit. I keep some busts around my 
home, and of course, I have one of 
Charles Drew and Matthew Henson, but 
I also have one of Daniel Hale Wil-
liams, who few people know. Daniel 
Hale Williams was an African Amer-
ican. 
If you look in the books and they ask 
the question: Who is the father of open- 
heart surgery? You will get the name 
of Dr. C. Walton Lillehei, who was 
White. He is credited in all the books 
with performing the first open-heart 
surgery. He just passed away in 1999. 
His surgery was performed in 1952. But 
that is not the real history. 
Why would it be uncomfortable for 
you to know that Daniel Hale Wil-
liams, who was a doctor and who 
founded the Provident Hospital up in 
Chicago, one day, back in 1893, had 
someone come to that hospital with a 
stab wound in the chest? The guy hap-
pened to have been White, but Daniel 
Hale Williams, the Black guy, per-
formed open-heart surgery and saved 
the man’s life, and he lived 20 years 
afterward. 
The textbooks don’t record that. 
They decided to wait almost 100 years 
to give somebody else credit. That is 
what happened, and that is why we 
look at this week. 
Now, I think that Carter Woodson 
was very concerned about what seemed 
to be going on today, people leaving 
out facts, ignoring facts, lowering their 
level of respect for people. I can’t tell 
you how many times I have been en-
gaged in conversation with people who, 
out of their ignorance, say things that 
they really believe that indicate there 
can be found no significant contribu-
tions to this great country from people 
of color. I have had it said to me. 
It is not their fault. They believe 
that because that is what they have 
seen in the books or have not seen. 
If we teach these facts, then I think 
Black history will take on a new mean-
ing, and Black History Month would 
not be so uncomfortable for anybody to 
celebrate. 
Next month, we will celebrate Wom-
en’s History Month simply because so 
many of the contributions of women 
have been left out and ignored. So, we 
take the month of March to focus on 
those things, and that is why it is so 
important for us. 
Mr. Speaker, I did not look at the 
clock. How much time do I have left? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from South Carolina has 23 
minutes remaining. 
Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I have a 
lot of time. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE), 
who wanted to participate in this hour. 
I assure you, Mr. Speaker, 23 minutes 
may not be enough for Ms. JACKSON 
LEE, but that is all we have left. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, 
first of all, let me acknowledge just a 
stunning and very pivotal and impor-
tant Black history message that our 
whip has given. He really is our histo-
rian, and I certainly want to pay trib-
ute and give credence to the great 
work that he has established here for 
us. 
Mr. Speaker, it was so powerful to be 
able to reorder critical race theory to 
critical race fact. I just want to rein-
force that everyone knows, and it has 
been for decades, that critical race the-
ory is an aspect of graduate teaching, 
master’s, Ph.D.s, and in law schools. 
The basis of it is the seeming infusion 
of racism in society by way of laws and 
other actions. 
Black history has always been, and 
the founder of Black history always 
wanted it to be, an opportunity for 
healing and bringing us together by un-
derstanding. I think the whip has laid 
out a stupendous story, a better under-
standing of Charles Drew and a better 
understanding of the light bulb. 
Why wouldn’t boys and girls from all 
walks of life want to understand how 
we are better together than we are sep-
arate? 
I just want to take a moment to take 
up a different theme that speaks to the 
issue of Black history. I want to talk 
about the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amend-
ments. As well, I want to make sure 
that we highlight some aspects of 
Black history. 
Mr. Speaker, let me, first of all, indi-
cate that Black history is an impor-
tant element of who we are. I am just 
going to call off the kinds of names 
that I hope will be welcomed in any 
classroom: President Barack Obama, 
44th President of the United States, 
the first African-American President; 
Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.; 
Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Mar-
shall; U.S. Senator Blanche Kelso 
Bruce; U.S. Congresswoman Barbara 
Jordan; U.S. Congressman Mickey Le-
land; Dr. Guion Stewart Bluford; Mae 
C. Jemison—people that I knew be-
cause, living in Houston, they were as-
tronauts that went out of Johnson 
Space Center—Dr. McNair, whose life 
was lost in the service of this Nation as 
an astronaut. 
Why wouldn’t we want to talk about 
such beloved personalities who over-
came obstacles to do great things? Ac-
tivists and intellectual authors and 
artists like Frederick Douglass, Booker 
T. Washington, these were individuals 
in the era of post-slavery and post-Re-
construction, in many instances, who 
still laid the groundwork for us. 
James 
Baldwin, 
Harriet 
Tubman, 
Rosa Parks, Maya Angelou, Toni Mor-
rison, and Gwendolyn Brooks, just to 
name a few of the countless number of 
well-known and unsung heroes. 
James Baldwin, of course, an author; 
Toni Morrison, an author; and Gwen-
dolyn Brooks. Obviously, Toni being 
maligned because of not being under-
stood. Harriet Tubman, an unbeliev-
able story with the Underground Rail-
road. Rosa Parks, who sat down along 
with others. Maya Angelou, poet lau-
reate. 
I also want to put into the RECORD 
names of historical figures, some of 
whom have passed, from my own com-
munity: Reverend F.N. Williams, Sr.; 
Dr. 
S.J. 
Gilbert, 
Sr.; 
Reverend 
Crawford W. Kimble; Reverend E. Stan-
ley 
Branch; 
Reverend 
William 
A. 
Lawson, emeritus; Reverend Johnnie 
Jeffery ‘‘J.J.’’ Roberson; Mr. John 
Bland; Ms. Ruby Moseley; Ms. Dorothy 
Hubbard; Ms. Doris Hubbard—all of 
them infused liberty and liberation 
into our community—Acres Homes; 
Third Ward; Fifth Ward; South Park; 
Sunnyside; Willie Bell Boone; Ms. 
Holly Hogrobrooks, one of the first stu-
dent protesters at Weingarten’s; Mr. 
Deloyd Parker, who founded SHAPE, a 
pivotal agency in our community; Ms. 
Lenora ‘‘Doll’’ Carter; and Mr. Gerald 
Womack. At 16 years old, Gerald 
Womack opened his own real estate 
company, and he is one of the most 
generous humanitarians and business-
men living in our community today. 
I only call these names out to align 
myself with the issue of facts. Why 
wouldn’t we want to know the facts of 
each 
of 
our 
communities? 
Why 
wouldn’t we want to know those who 
descended from those who came on Pil-
grims’ pride? Why wouldn’t we want to

know those who are the legacies of the 
indigenous people, Native Americans, 
and many different Tribes, many of 
whom, 
of 
course, 
married 
African 
Americans as slaves or in the post- 
slave era? 
Why wouldn’t we want to know that 
history? I am stunned that we would 
not want to do so. 
I believe it is important to not only 
know history that is pleasant but that 
we can call off wonderful people in our 
community who, in spite of the chal-
lenges and tribulations, became great 
leaders. But I also want to bring to the 
attention—because I have such an af-
fection and love for this book taught to 
me by not only the whip, who appre-
ciates this book called the Constitu-
tion, but Barbara Jordan reminded me 
to always carry it, for ladies, in their 
purses. 
George Washington called the Con-
stitution ‘‘the guide, which I will never 
abandon.’’ He is absolutely right. 
‘‘The Declaration of Independence 
was the promise; the Constitution was 
the fulfillment.’’ A Republican judge, 
Warren Burger, said that. It couldn’t 
be more true. 
b 1315 
That seems to be taken sideways 
today because you can wrap the Con-
stitution in the history of Black Amer-
ica, Mr. Speaker. So I rise for us to dis-
cuss today both the 13th, 14th, and 15th 
Amendments. As I cherish the Con-
stitution, I can assure you that I cher-
ish those amendments. 
I think we should remind America 
that we are the only population—we 
don’t do it angrily—that were held in 
bondage for a period of time, longer 
than two centuries, 246 years longer 
than the Nation is old—we will meet 
that timeframe probably this July— 
but for a long time, longer than the 
Nation was old. 
We know that President Lincoln had 
many reasons. He frankly thought he 
could bring the Union together if he 
could crush the rebellion in the South 
by freeing the slaves. In 1862, President 
Lincoln came to believe—and by the 
way, I and my friends, all of us call 
ourselves Lincolnesque. We look to the 
other party as the party of Lincoln, 
those wonderful stories that we learned 
in school, and we just knew this tall 
man called Abe Lincoln. 
He was humble, not rich, but rich in 
spirit and courage. He believed firmly 
that emancipating the enslaved people 
in the South would help the Union 
crush the Confederate rebellion in the 
Civil War and win the Civil War. 
Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclama-
tion which took effect in 1863 an-
nounced that all persons held as slaves 
within any State shall be then, thence-
forward, and forever free. 
Wouldn’t that be a good lesson to un-
derstand, whether you are in first 
grade or whether you are in fourth 
grade or whether you are in middle 
school? 
The largesse and the values embed-
ded in the Constitution to create a 
more perfect Union, here we are in the 
1800s trying to proclaim that value. 
That is a value. That is a fact. But as 
we know, the Emancipation Proclama-
tion itself did not end slavery in the 
United States, as it only applied to the 
11 Confederate States then at war 
against the Union and only to the por-
tion of those States not already under 
Union control. 
To make it permanent, it would have 
to be a constitutional amendment. So 
in 1864, the U.S. Senate passed a pro-
posed amendment banning slavery with 
the necessary two-thirds majority, but 
it faltered in the House of Representa-
tives. So when Congress reconvened in 
1864, the emboldened Republicans put 
the proposed amendment up for a vote 
again, and Lincoln threw himself into 
the legislative process, inviting indi-
vidual Representatives to his office to 
discuss the amendment and putting it 
forward. 
Isn’t that like sweet music? 
The Republicans, the Lincoln Repub-
licans, got going. Lincoln was com-
mitted to the passage of the 13th 
Amendment, telling his allies to see 
what is before you to focus on the most 
important thing, that this amendment 
protects the slaves now born and in the 
United States but settles the question 
for all time for the millions yet to be 
born. 
What an emotional and moving set of 
words. How emotional for the world to 
see how small it was at that time of 
this new experiment that left the 
shores of Europe. 
What is this thing called the United 
States of America? 
Can they actually govern? Can they 
lead? 
Can they live? Is democracy real? 
It is a democratic republic wrapped 
up in the history of slaves, Black his-
tory, the history of African Americans. 
The allies got busy and got working, 
and he reportedly told them: I leave it 
to you to determine how it shall be 
done but remember that I am President 
of the United States, clothed with im-
mense power, and I expect you to pro-
cure these votes. 
That gives a sense of democracy that 
he didn’t go in and drag people out. He 
actually told his allies: Let’s try to get 
it done. I have got the power, but let’s 
try to get votes. 
We have seen that happen with some 
sadness to lack of success, but we stand 
on this floor in tribute to a man who 
wanted to see voting rights continue 
and continue and continue. 
So on January 31st, 1865, the House of 
Representatives passed the proposed 
amendment with a vote of 119–56, just 
over the required two-thirds, and the 
following day Lincoln approved a joint 
resolution of Congress submitting it to 
the States for ratification. 
That is a beautiful story. That is a 
fact. That is Black history. This is 
American history. I think that is the 
point that I want to make, that Black 
history is American history. It is no 
less and no more. 
There should be no doubt in trying to 
teach American history that has the 
wonderful tinge of Black history. 
Yesterday, February 8, 2022, honored 
the 15th Amendment—which I will 
speak somewhat about—to the United 
States Constitution which outlaws dis-
crimination in voting on the basis of 
race, color, and previous conditions of 
servitude, therefore, advancing suf-
frage for African Americans. 
This was the last and most difficult 
and hard-fought of all the Reconstruc-
tion 
congressional 
constitutional 
amendments to confer citizenship upon 
the formerly enslaved. The intention of 
this amendment was to codify perma-
nently the right to vote for all freed 
men. Immediately the impact of this 
amendment proved transformative as 
freed men—women still were not al-
lowed to vote—exercised the right to 
vote and in coalition elected several 
hundred African Americans to office. 
How powerful this history is. How 
factual this history is. How coming to-
gether this history was, that you had, 
by birthright citizenship, the right to 
vote no matter whether or not you 
were previously enslaved or the color 
of your skin or previous condition. 
That is history. 
So why do we talk about history 
today? 
I said it was in the name of our dear, 
late friend and the many people who 
Whip CLYBURN spoke to, but we do it 
because—although the 13th and 14th 
Amendments, the 14th giving due proc-
ess rights—1921, this is a picture that 
we saw: captured Negroes on the way 
to the convention hall during the Tulsa 
race riot. 
The freed slaves actually did every-
thing that America said they shall do. 
They built this community on land 
given to them. They had hotels and 
hospitals. They had schools, and they 
had marching bands. Yet, unfortu-
nately, it triggered a dislike. 
Maybe this should be a continuation 
of an understanding and grades that 
would appreciate the fact that there 
were those who stood, had economic 
development and did all that citizens 
were expected to do, integrated into so-
ciety but happened to be some freed 
slaves and some the descendants of 
enslaved Africans. 
The Tulsa race riots were 1921. So the 
question of race continues. It started 
in the origins of slavery and slaves 
coming to the United States, but it 
continued. 
But true history, Mr. Speaker, is a 
recognition that the facts won’t hurt 
you, that they give you strength and 
allow you to continue to grow. But I 
think that is what I think this little 
book represents. 
Quickly, I want to show a more po-
tent picture, for that is what happened 
in America for 246 years. 
Again, the anguish and anger are not 
the approach that we want to leave 
with our fellow Americans. It is the ap-
preciation of the significance of Black 
history and the significance of a pres-
ence of a people in this country. And

February 9, 2022 
the fact that this Constitution wanted 
to get rid of that, that is a good thing. 
That is the goodness of America. That 
story should be told. 
So when we talk about the many 
Members of Congress who have come to 
accept the healing powers of a bill that 
studies slavery and establishes a com-
mission to deal with its repair and res-
toration and results like H.R. 40, 33 
years filed in this Congress, what hap-
pens is that we have the facts, we have 
the approach, and the approach is heal-
ing. 
So as I close my remarks, let me say 
that we are a continuing work in 
progress. I am so grateful to the whip 
for allowing me this moment to remind 
us that our special history is this book. 
So when we hear a Brian Flores law-
suit about our friends in the NFL and 
the numbers that are so awkward—I 
won’t pursue that now. 
But what I will say is: Can we work 
together? Because issues still exist. 
Can we teach our children the goodness 
of the history of a people? And then, 
can we take the next step to work with 
institutions who have not yet fulfilled 
the beginning of this book that says we 
organize to create a more perfect 
Union, and the 13th and 14th Amend-
ment which rids of us of all discrimina-
tion? 
Mr. Speaker, I hope we can do that 
for this month, and I hope we can do 
that forever. 
Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of this 
body and the Committee on the Judiciary, I 
am pleased to join my colleagues in this Spe-
cial Order marking the anniversary of the pas-
sage on December 6, 1865 of the 13th 
Amendment to the Constitution and cele-
brating the passage of the 14th and 15th 
Amendments, known as the Civil Rights 
Amendments. 
I 
thank 
my 
colleague, 
Congressman 
BUTTERFIELD, for anchoring this important Spe-
cial Order and am remembering our late col-
league, John Lewis, a great and beloved man, 
who risked and gave his life to make real the 
promise of those amendments. 
The 13th Amendment, the first of the three 
great Civil War Amendments, was passed in 
1865 and abolished slavery. 
The 14th Amendment conferred citizenship 
on the newly emancipated slaves, and the 
15th Amendment prohibited abridging the right 
to vote on account of race, color, or previous 
condition of servitude. 
Taken together, these amendments were in-
tended and have the effect of making former 
slaves, and their descendants, full and equal 
members of the political community known as 
the United States of America. 
By 1861, when the Civil War broke out, 
more than 4 million people (nearly all of them 
of African descent) were enslaved in 15 south-
ern and border states. 
By 1862, President Abraham Lincoln came 
to believe firmly that emancipating enslaved 
people in the South would help the Union 
crush the Confederate rebellion and win the 
Civil War. 
Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation, which 
took effect in 1863, announced that all 
enslaved people held in the states ‘‘then in re-
bellion against the United States, shall be 
then, thenceforward, and forever free.’’ 
But the Emancipation Proclamation in itself 
did not end slavery in the United States, as it 
only applied to the 11 Confederate states then 
at war against the Union, and only to the por-
tion of those states not already under Union 
control. 
To make emancipation permanent would 
take a constitutional amendment abolishing 
the institution of slavery itself. 
In April 1864, the U.S. Senate passed a 
proposed amendment banning slavery with the 
necessary two-thirds majority but it faltered in 
the House of Representatives, as more and 
more Democrats refused to support it. 
When Congress reconvened in December 
1864, the emboldened Republicans put the 
proposed amendment up for vote again and 
Lincoln threw himself in the legislative proc-
ess, inviting individual representatives to his 
office to discuss the amendment and putting 
pressure on border-state Unionists (who had 
previously opposed it) to change their position. 
Lincoln was committed to the passage of 
the 13th Amendment, telling his allies to ‘‘see 
what is before you, to focus on the most im-
portant thing; that this Amendment protects 
the slaves now born and in the United States, 
but settles the question for all time for the mil-
lions yet to be born.’’ 
He authorized his allies to entice House 
members with plum positions and other in-
ducements, reportedly telling them: ‘‘I leave it 
to you to determine how it shall be done; but 
remember that I am President of the United 
States, clothed with immense power, and I ex-
pect you to procure those votes.’’ 
On January 31, 1865, the House of Rep-
resentatives passed the proposed amendment 
with a vote of 119–56, just over the required 
two-thirds majority, and the following day, Lin-
coln approved a joint resolution of Congress 
submitting it to the state legislatures for ratifi-
cation. 
Mr. Speaker, the United States is the 
world’s only superpower and boasts the larg-
est economy in the history of the world and for 
many years was the world’s indispensable na-
tion and the example that all aspiring democ-
racies wished to emulate. 
But at the same time, this nation has also 
been home to many searing instances of so-
cial unrest resulting from racial injustices, as 
we witnessed this year on the streets of big 
cities and small towns in urban and rural com-
munities. 
We saw Americans, by the millions across 
the country, coming from all races and ages, 
engaging in what the late John Lewis called 
‘‘good trouble’’ by protesting and demanding 
an end to the systemic racial inequality in our 
criminal justice system that too often victim-
izes and disproportionately treats black Ameri-
cans worse, ceteris paribus, when it comes to 
suspicion, apprehension, arrest, detention, 
trial, sentencing, and incarceration. 
While the brutal deaths of George Floyd in 
Minneapolis and Breonna Taylor in Louisville 
shocked the conscience of the nation, most 
black Americans will tell you what they experi-
enced is not new, but has been occurring for 
generations, if not centuries. 
What is critically important to understand is 
that the instances of brutal and unfair treat-
ment the nation has witnessed this year can-
not be attributed to the proverbial few ‘‘bad 
apples in the bushel’’ but is instead the fore-
seeable consequence of systemic racism and 
racial inequality in the system. 
Not just the criminal justice system, but the 
health care system, the economic system, and 
the educational system to name the most glar-
ing examples. 
To find our way out of this dark time, we 
need to understand how it came to be. 
That is why in January 2019, I introduced 
H.R. 40, which establishes a commission to 
examine slavery and discrimination in the 
colonies and the United States from 1619 to 
the present and recommend appropriate rem-
edies. 
Among other requirements, the commission 
shall identify the role of federal and state gov-
ernments in supporting the institution of slav-
ery; forms of discrimination in the public and 
private sectors against freed slaves and their 
descendants; and lingering negative effects of 
slavery on living African-Americans and soci-
ety. 
Official slavery ended with the Civil War and 
ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment. 
But unofficial slavery was continued with the 
new institution of sharecrop farming, a criminal 
justice system that would press convicts into 
work once done by slaves, and labor policies 
that dictated income for work done based 
upon skin color. 
And, of course, all of this was reinforced by 
the systematic disenfranchisement of black 
Americans, the ‘‘discrete and insular minority’’ 
excluded from ‘‘those political processes ordi-
narily to be relied upon to protect’’ them, to 
quote Chief Justice Hughes’ famous Carolene 
Products Footnote 4. 
For these reasons, the history of the United 
States is intertwined with the history of 
enslaved Africans in the Americas. 
There is blood and there are tears, but there 
is also redemption and reconciliation. 
But to get there, we must have the complete 
truth and lay our history bare. 
It is the light that sheds the way to the more 
perfect union all Americans want. 
The Commission created and empowered 
by H.R. 40 is a necessary first step in that ef-
fort to get to truth and reconciliation about the 
Original Sin of American Slavery that is nec-
essary to light the way to the beloved commu-
nity we all seek. 
Finally, I join all my colleagues in pointing 
out that the most fitting and proper means of 
paying tribute to the beloved John Lewis’s ex-
traordinary life is for the Senate to immediately 
take up and pass the John Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act, landmark legislation 
to protect the precious right to vote for all per-
sons and to ensure that our democracy has 
the tools needed to remain strong. 
Mr. Speaker, this February we recognize 
and celebrate the 40th commemoration of 
Black History Month. 
This month we celebrate the contributions of 
African Americans to the history of our great 
nation, and pay tribute to trailblazers, pio-
neers, heroes, and leaders like the 44th Presi-
dent of the United States, Barack Obama; 
Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.; Supreme 
Court Justice Thurgood Marshall; U.S. Senator 
Blanche Kelso Bruce; U.S. Congresswoman 
Barbara Jordan; U.S. Congressman Mickey 
Leland; Astronauts Dr. Guion Stewart Bluford, 
Jr., and Mae C. Jemison; activists, intellec-
tuals, authors, and artists like Frederick Doug-
lass, Booker T. Washington, James Baldwin, 
Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks, Maya Angelou, 
Toni Morrison, and Gwendolyn Brooks just to 
name a few of the countless number of well-

known and unsung heroes whose contribu-
tions have helped our nation become a more 
perfect union. 
The history of the United States has been 
marked by the great contributions of African 
American activists, leaders, writers, and art-
ists. 
As a member of Congress, I know that I 
stand on the shoulders of giants whose strug-
gles and triumphs made it possible for me to 
stand here today and continue the fight for 
equality, justice, and progress for all, regard-
less of race, religion, gender or sexual orienta-
tion. 
The greatest of these giants to me are Mrs. 
Ivalita ‘‘Ivy’’ Jackson, a vocational nurse, and 
Mr. Ezra A. Jackson, one of the first African- 
Americans to succeed in the comic book pub-
lishing business. 
They were my beloved parents and they 
taught me the value of education, hard work, 
discipline, perseverance, and caring for others. 
And I am continually inspired by Dr. Elwyn 
Lee, my husband and the first tenured African 
American law professor at the University of 
Houston. 
Mr. Speaker, I particularly wish to acknowl-
edge the contributions of African American 
veterans in defending from foreign aggressors 
and who by their courageous examples helped 
transform our nation from a segregated soci-
ety to a nation committed to the never ending 
challenge of perfecting our union. 
A few years ago about this time, I was hon-
ored to join my colleagues, the late Congress-
man John Lewis and former Congressman 
Charles Rangel, a Korean War veteran, in 
paying tribute to surviving members of the 
Tuskegee Airmen and the 555th Parachute In-
fantry, the famed ‘‘Triple Nickels’’ at a moving 
ceremony sponsored by the U.S. Army com-
memorating the 50th Anniversary of the 1964 
Civil Rights Act. 
The success of the Tuskegee Airmen in es-
corting bombers during World War II—achiev-
ing one of the lowest loss records of all the 
escort fighter groups, and being in constant 
demand for their services by the allied bomber 
units—is a record unmatched by any other 
fighter group. 
So impressive and astounding were the 
feats of the Tuskegee Airmen that in 1948, it 
helped persuade President Harry Truman to 
issue his famous Executive Order No. 9981, 
which directed equality of treatment and op-
portunity in all of the United States Armed 
Forces and led to the end of racial segrega-
tion in the U.S. military forces. 
It is a source of enormous and enduring 
pride that my father-in-law, Phillip Ferguson 
Lee, was one of the Tuskegee Airmen. 
Clearly, what began as an experiment to de-
termine whether ‘‘colored’’ soldiers’ were ca-
pable of operating expensive and complex 
combat aircraft ended as an unqualified suc-
cess 
based 
on 
the 
experience 
of 
the 
Tuskegee Airmen, whose record included 261 
aircraft destroyed, 148 aircraft damaged, 
15,553 combat sorties and 1,578 missions 
over Italy and North Africa. 
They also destroyed or damaged over 950 
units of ground transportation and escorted 
more than 200 bombing missions. They 
proved that ‘‘the antidote to racism is excel-
lence in performance,’’ as retired Lt. Col. Her-
bert Carter once remarked. 
Mr. Speaker, Black History Month is also a 
time to remember many pioneering women 
like U.S. Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm; 
activists Harriet Tubman and Rosa Parks; as-
tronaut Mae C. Jemison; mathematicians like 
Katherine G. Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan and 
Mary Jackson; authors Maya Angelou, Toni 
Morrison, and Gwendolyn Brooks; all of whom 
have each in their own way, whether through 
courageous activism, cultural or intellectual 
contributions, or artistic creativity, forged social 
and political change, and forever changed our 
great Nation for the better. 
It is also fitting, Mr. Speaker, that in addition 
to those national leaders whose contributions 
have made our nation better, we honor also 
those who have and are making a difference 
in their local communities. 
In my home city of Houston, there are nu-
merous great men and women. They are great 
because they have heeded the counsel of Dr. 
King who said: ‘‘Everybody can be great be-
cause anybody can serve. You only need a 
heart full of grace. A soul generated by love.’’ 
By that measure, I wish to pay tribute to 
some of the great men and women of Houston 
some of whom who have passed: 
Rev. F.N. Williams, Sr. 
Rev. Dr. S.J. Gilbert, Sr. 
Rev. Crawford W. Kimble 
Rev. Eldridge Stanley Branch 
Rev. William A. Lawson 
Rev. Johnnie Jeffery ‘‘J.J.’’ Robeson 
Mr. John Bland 
Ms. Ruby Moseley 
Ms. Dorothy Hubbard 
Ms. Doris Hubbard 
Ms. Willie Bell Boone 
Ms. Holly HogoBrooks 
Mr. Deloyd Parker 
Ms. Lenora ‘‘Doll’’ Carter 
Mr. Gerald Womack 
As we celebrate Black History Month, let us 
pay tribute to those who have come before us, 
and pay forward to future generations by ad-
dressing what is the number one issue for Af-
rican American families, and all American fam-
ilies today: preserving the American promise 
of economic opportunity for all. 
Our immediate focus must be job creation, 
and enacting legislation that will foster and lay 
the foundation for today’s and tomorrow’s gen-
eration of groundbreaking activists, leaders, 
scientists, writers and artists to continue con-
tributing to the greatness of America. 
We must continue to preserve the American 
Dream for all. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand here in 
celebration of the heroic and historic acts of 
African Americans and their indispensable 
contributions to this great Nation. 
It is through our work in creating possibilities 
for today and future generations that we best 
honor the accomplishments and legacy of our 
predecessors. 
Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time.

BLACK HISTORY MONTH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Utah 
(Mr. OWENS) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the minority 
leader. 
Mr. OWENS. Before I get started, Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to yield to the 
gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. 
FOXX), who serves on the Education 
and Labor Committee. 
FREE SPEECH AT GEORGE WASHINGTON 
UNIVERSITY 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman from Utah for yielding to 
me today. 
Mr. Speaker, I was encouraged to see 
George Washington University, GW, re-
verse its decision to censor posters 
highlighting the human rights abuses 
of the Chinese Communist Party, CCP. 
The Olympic-themed posters bring 
attention to the CCP for its oppression 
of Tibetans and Uyghurs. They also de-
nounce China for undermining democ-
racy in Hong Kong, implementing an 
authoritarian surveillance system over 
its own people, and for its dishonesty 
in the handling of COVID–19. 
Calling these posters racist is absurd 
and a dishonest attempt to pander to 
an authoritarian regime housing ethnic 
minorities in modern-day concentra-
tion camps. They aren’t promoting rac-
ism but decrying it. 
Allowing students to stand up for 
human rights and democratic values on 
college campuses should not be a point 
of controversy. 
Condemning ethnic cleansing and 
genocide is not controversial. Con-
demning the erosion of privacy is not 
controversial. Condemning the destruc-
tion of democratic values is not con-
troversial. In fact, condemning these 
crimes should be something that unites 
all Americans. 
The individuals who hung these post-
ers are braver than many pundits and 
politicians who are turning a blind eye 
to the CCP’s atrocities. We should cele-
brate their courage, not punish it. 
Too many universities tout free 
speech policies but punish those with 
different viewpoints for simply speak-
ing their mind. We must allow our col-
leges and university campuses to be 
places that welcome free speech and an 
open exchange of ideas. 
Speech meant to incite violence is 
never acceptable, and I condemn rac-
ism in all its forms. Yet, we must en-
sure that we aren’t letting politically 
motivated groups cry wolf whenever 
someone says something they may not 
want to hear or speaks up for the mil-
lions who cannot do so themselves. 
If cries of racism can be weaponized 
to silence political opponents, then our 
country will be ruled by the diktats of 
political correctness and a fear of cen-
sorship 
instead 
of 
rational 
free 
thought. If we want to stay a self-gov-
erned and free country, then we must 
protect our most fundamental rights, 
and 
this 
includes 
the 
freedom 
of 
speech. 
Colleges and universities must pro-
tect the free and open exchange of 
ideas. Silencing students or professors 
for challenging the status quo makes 
university officials no better than the 
Chinese Communist Party. 
In the end, GW made the right deci-
sion and should be commended for it. I 
hope other schools will learn from this 
and support free speech from the start. 
Mr. OWENS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Dr. FOXX again for her great leader-
ship.

February 9, 2022 
Next, I yield to the gentleman from 
South Carolina (Mr. DUNCAN). 
b 1330 
HONORING THE LIFE OF RAYMOND G. ‘‘JERRY’’ 
STRAWBRIDGE 
Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Utah for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor 
the life of a model American and South 
Carolinian, and let me add, a very good 
friend of mine, Raymond G. ‘‘Jerry’’ 
Strawbridge, who passed away Monday. 
Jerry was chairman of the Saluda 
County Council, and epitomized what 
it meant to be a public servant and a 
true patriot, as he did so much to serve 
his church, his country, Saluda Coun-
ty, South Carolina’s Third District, the 
State of South Carolina, and our great 
Nation. 
Jerry was a family man, a business 
owner, a veteran, chairman of Saluda 
County Republican Party for 8 years, 
chairman of Saluda County Water and 
Sewer Authority, a 32nd degree Mason, 
and very involved in his lodge. He was 
also a sergeant major for the South 
Carolina National Guard where he 
served for 40 years, and that is quite a 
feat. 
His accolades include: National De-
fense Service Medal, Army Reserve 
Component Achievement Medal, the 
Army Achievement Medal, the Army 
Commendation Medal, NCO Profes-
sional 
Development 
Ribbon, 
Army 
Service Ribbon, Armed Forces Reserve 
Medal, U.S. Meritorious Service Medal, 
and the South Carolina Guardsman Re-
tirement Medal. 
My heart goes out to Jerry’s wife, 
Denise, and his children and grand-
children. I am praying for them as they 
mourn the loss of a truly incredible 
person who served so well. He will sure-
ly be missed by his community and his 
legacy will continue to have an impact 
on Saluda County and South Carolina 
for many years to come. 
Mr. Speaker, during these times we 
are comforted by Scripture and the 
words of Jesus. ‘‘Blessed are those who 
mourn, for they will be comforted.’’ 
May God bless the Strawbridge fam-
ily, and may God continue to bless the 
United States of America. 
Mr. OWENS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Representative DUNCAN
for his com-
ments. I appreciate that very much. 
Today I rise in honor of Black His-
tory Month and the everlasting resil-
iency of patriots in the Black commu-
nity 
who 
have 
risen 
above 
cir-
cumstance 
to 
live 
the 
American 
Dream. 
As we get started, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
New 
York 
(Ms. 
TENNEY), my really good friend. 
Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman so much for yielding. It 
is just an honor to serve with you and 
also to serve with our great colleague, 
BYRON DONALDS from Florida. I thank 
the gentleman for hosting this very im-
portant Special Order to celebrate and 
recognize Black History Month. 
Upstate New York has a strong aboli-
tionist history, and I am honored to 
highlight the stories of our region’s ab-
olitionist heroes today. These individ-
uals played a pivotal role in bringing 
our Nation’s founding ideals to fruition 
following the brutal failure of slavery 
in our early days. 
Not many people outside New York 
realize just how rich our history is 
within the abolitionist movement. For-
tunately, I had the opportunity to visit 
a few of these sites with Congressman 
OWENS back in October which we later 
recalled 
and 
memorialized 
on 
the 
House floor in January in another Spe-
cial Order. Many of these sites, such as 
the Gerrit Smith Estate National His-
toric Landmark and the National Abo-
lition Hall of Fame and Museum, are 
located in the heart of my district in 
Peterboro, Madison County, New York. 
The Gerrit Smith Estate is named for 
Gerrit Smith, a wealthy New York 
landowner and one-term Member of the 
House of Representatives, who, coinci-
dentally, represented the 26th District, 
as I do now. Smith put his wealth to 
good use by fervently supporting the 
abolitionist movement. He truly put 
his wealth behind his beliefs and pro-
moted the rights of individuals to have 
life, liberty, and the pursuit of happi-
ness. 
For nearly 40 years, Smith dedicated 
his whole heart to the abolitionist 
cause. Other notable abolitionist he-
roes such as Harriet Tubman, Fred-
erick Douglass, William Lloyd Garri-
son, and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, all 
made their way to the Smith Estate at 
one point or another to participate in 
Smith’s good work. 
Peterboro, 
New 
York, 
became 
a 
haven for fugitive slaves because of 
Gerrit Smith’s courage and undying vi-
sion for a better, more equal America. 
Gerrit donated much of his farmland to 
escaped slaves so they could become 
self-sufficient and avoid slave hunters. 
Gerrit Smith also supported Frederick 
Douglass’ newspaper, The North Star, 
and gave him what would be the equiv-
alent of about $7,000 a month in today’s 
dollars, and kept that newspaper going 
to inform the public about what was 
happening in the abolitionist move-
ment. 
His home became a stop along the fa-
mous underground railroad where peo-
ple would come for shelter, food, and 
support. Hundreds of enslaved people 
found their way to freedom because of 
Gerrit Smith’s valor and generosity. 
Down the road in Peterboro you will 
find the National Abolition Hall of 
Fame and Museum. This fixture of the 
community is located in the same 
building where the first-ever meeting 
of the New York State Anti-Slavery 
Society was held in 1835. 
Because of their importance to the 
movement, both the Gerrit Smith Es-
tate National Historic Landmark and 
the National Abolition Hall of Fame 
and Museum now are listed as 2 of the 
22 sites on the New York State Under-
ground Railroad Heritage Trail. 
The 
abolitionist 
Reverend 
Henry 
Highland Garnet once told an old 
friend by the name of Frederick Doug-
lass: There are two places where 
slaveholders cannot come. There is 
Heaven, and there is Peterboro. We are 
so proud to have Peterboro in our dis-
trict. 
I am so honored that I got to stand 
there below that sign with my great 
colleague, BURGESS OWENS from Utah. 
Gerrit Smith and the New York State 
Anti-Slavery Society surely are to 
thank for that. We also want to cele-
brate Black History Month and recog-
nize the many accomplishments of so 
many Black Americans. 
Another one of them just outside my 
district is Harriet Tubman, where she 
spent a lot of her later years, a woman 
who lived to be 92; and you have heard 
Congressman OWENS talk about her and 
me as well in Special Orders, but truly 
a remarkable person. We stood in awe 
of Harriet Tubman’s accomplishments, 
her tenacity. She was strong, she was 
compassionate, she was courageous, 
she was kind. And not only did she 
serve as a conductor of the under-
ground railroad, among so many ac-
complishments, she also freed count-
less slaves. She worked as a scout, a 
spy, and a nurse in the Union Army. At 
her core, Harriet Tubman was a woman 
of such deep compassion and care for 
everyone around her. 
In her later years, she helped so 
many who came through her home in 
Auburn, New York, providing them 
shelter, medical attention, and just un-
dying love. Despite the obstacles she 
faced, Harriet Tubman never gave up 
nor was she ever consumed by anger or 
cynicism. She led with integrity and 
was incredibly resilient. She is a tre-
mendous role model for all of us today. 
As I have said before, the way to im-
prove our Nation is not to cynically 
tear down our institutions or erase and 
rewrite our history, but rather to take 
inspiration from the ideals of our 
Founding, and those who persevered 
with great courage to fight for a better 
future against so much that was 
against them. 
People like Frederick Douglass and 
Harriet Tubman are just great Ameri-
cans, tremendous Americans and part 
of our history, and so many contrib-
uted to their ability to achieve the 
goals to finally eradicating slavery and 
bringing us where we are today in cele-
brating Black History Month for such a 
long period of time in our country, as 
Congressman CLYBURN mentioned ear-
lier. 
I just want to thank Congressman 
DONALDS and also Congressman OWENS 
for their great leadership on behalf of 
our side of the aisle, and also just on 
representing and protecting our insti-
tutions of freedom, human rights, indi-
vidual rights, and all that they do as 
great Americans. I am honored to be 
able to be here with them today. I 
thank you so much again for your 
great generosity. 
Mr. OWENS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman. I really appreciate 
it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1100 
February 9, 2022 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Florida (Mr. DONALDS), my great 
friend. 
Mr. DONALDS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today alongside my good friend, Con-
gressman BURGESS
OWENS, from the 
great State of Utah in celebration of 
Black History Month. 
I, like Mr. OWENS, stand on the shoul-
ders of Black Americans who came be-
fore us despite hurdles and glass ceil-
ings, but still rose to the Halls of Con-
gress, or to the highest echelon of our 
American history. 
You see, there are so many pioneers 
who came before us, some of us who are 
still 
contemporary 
pioneers, 
Mr. 
Speaker. People like Majority Whip 
CLYBURN of South Carolina, Senator 
TIM
SCOTT, the late Congresswoman 
Shirley Chisholm, Justice Clarence 
Thomas and Justice Thurgood Mar-
shall, Frederick Douglass, Madam C.J. 
Walker, Booker T. Washington, Rosa 
Parks, Martin Luther King, Jr., Dr. 
Ben Carson. I could go on and on. 
You see, I stand here today as the 
first Black person elected as a Rep-
resentative of Florida’s 19th Congres-
sional District. I am the third-ever 
Black Republican ever elected in the 
great State of Florida. 
During Black History Month, we pay 
homage to all of those who came before 
us and those who continue to empower 
the lives throughout the Black commu-
nity in America. You see, Black his-
tory is American history, and even 
though today we might have a lot of 
issues about the plight of Black people 
in our great country, it is without 
question that the advances, many of 
which have come in America, have 
been through the hands, the intellect, 
the ingenuity, the innovation of Black 
Americans who have contributed to the 
great fabric of our country. 
It really makes the contributions of 
Black Americans more than just for 
the Black community. It makes it for 
all of America. It is what helps the red, 
white, and blue that we all revere, ac-
tually be meaningful because of all of 
the different stains and pains, blood 
that was shed throughout the pathway 
of Black Americans to still be able to 
add and to still be counted for great 
contributions to our Nation. 
In 2022, Mr. OWENS and I stand here 
today as free men, both reaching the 
American Dream and dedicated to en-
suring that future generations of Black 
Americans can achieve the same suc-
cess that we have, and to add to that, 
to achieve even more success that we 
could even dream was possible even in 
2022. 
Regardless of what anybody says, 
America is not a racist Nation. I mean, 
look around. While we may have so 
many differences, and we might not al-
ways agree on a lot of things when it 
comes to politics or economics, obvi-
ously, sports, religion, et cetera, we all 
stand here together, all colors, all 
creeds, and all convictions here in the 
people’s House, proving that we are a 
nation that has achieved life, liberty, 
and the pursuit of happiness for all 
people in this great Nation. 
The last comment I will make, Mr. 
Speaker, is that, obviously, the month 
of February is when we celebrate Black 
History Month, but we are at a time in 
America where Black history in our 
schools should not just be confined to 
the month of February. We are at a 
time in the United States where all of 
the contributions of Black Americans 
and all of the pain that has been felt by 
Black Americans should be taught and 
conveyed throughout all of our halls of 
academia, whether you are talking 
about middle schools, high schools, or 
even higher education. 
This month is exceptionally special 
to me because I do understand that the 
sacrifices that my mother and my fam-
ily made for me throughout the years 
and all of the things that they believed 
that I could possibly achieve have cul-
minated in me standing here on this 
floor even making these comments 
about the rich history of Black Ameri-
cans to the United States. 
So it is with great humility, and it is 
with great appreciation for all of those 
who have come before me and, Mr. 
Speaker, to all the Black Americans 
who served with me today, that I just 
want to wish everybody a wonderful 
Black History Month, and also for ev-
erybody to reflect on how much we 
have gained here as a people in these 
United States. 
Mr. OWENS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my friend for his comments. 
Mr. Speaker, on that note, I would 
like to highlight something that I want 
those who are listening to be aware of. 
As you listen to those of the Repub-
lican Party, those who believe in these 
conservative values of love of God, 
country, family, that as we talk about 
our history, as we talk about things we 
are doing and have overcome and 
achieved, notice the sense of hope that 
we bring to the message. Notice the 
sense of unity. 
Yes, we look back on the past be-
cause we have a lot to learn from the 
past. But we look at the past in the 
way of what we have achieved and how 
far we have come, not where we are 
today. And I want Americans to think 
through the last couple of years. Are 
we tired of being afraid? Are we tired of 
being angry? Are we tired of fear? Lis-
ten to the messages of our great his-
tory and you will see that this country 
is a country of second chances. This 
country is a place where you come here 
no matter what language you speak, 
how poor you are, you have the oppor-
tunity to live your own American 
Dream. 
It was the Marxist, Karl Marx, who 
said it very simply. ‘‘The first battle-
field is to rewrite history.’’ Why would 
the Marxists—why would the hard left 
want to steal our history, change our 
history? Because within our great 
American history we have pride in our 
past, appreciation for our present, and 
a vision for our future. 
We are American people and it is 
within our DNA that we are hopeful. 
And only through the nuances of 
changing history which, by the way, 
has been done since the 1940s by the 
Progressive, 
‘‘father 
of 
the 
public 
school system,’’ John Dewey, that this 
change has been happening. 
b 1345 
We have talked about the success of 
Tulsa, a remarkable success. Just a few 
decades after the Civil War ended, you 
have this environment of success where 
people could live the American Dream, 
a little town where 600 businesses were 
established with over 50 millionaires, 
and six of them had their own private 
planes. It was started back in the early 
1900s. 
In 1921, that little community was 
destroyed within 12 hours, not by the 
American people, but by Southern 
Democratic KKK members. That is the 
nuance. 
We have been fighting against evil 
for a long time, and we will continue 
to. But let’s just make sure that we, 
the American people, know who the 
fight is against. It is not against those 
of us who believe in God, country, and 
family, a free market, the belief in 
looking at each other from the inside 
out versus the outside in. 
We are friends, no matter what side 
of the aisle we sit on, those of us who 
believe in our American way, those of 
us who see our future as coming closer 
together, not dividing us. We are on 
the same team, my friends. Let’s re-
member that. 
I am going to read the introduction 
that I have from one of the books I 
wrote earlier: For those who grew up in 
the Deep South, in the days of the KKK 
and Jim Crow segregation, pride in 
community was not founded on the em-
bellishment of opportunities lost due 
to racism. Instead, it was built on the 
highlighting of the great accomplish-
ments achieved, in spite of the obsta-
cles. 
The can-do outlook that prevailed in 
the past generations cleared the path-
way to prosperity and celebrated cre-
ative, courageous, and self-respecting 
community determined not to be held 
back. That community succeeded in 
their quest. That community was my 
dad’s generation and the ones before 
that who believed in this great coun-
try, who went to war to fight for this 
great country. 
I am going to talk about a couple of 
my heroes. I have had a chance, thank 
goodness, growing up in the Deep 
South in the days of KKK, Jim Crow, 
and segregation, in Tallahassee, Flor-
ida, to be raised by a community who 
was proud of who they were, a commu-
nity whose parents and teachers col-
laborated, talked, and respected each 
other, because the goal at the end of 
the day was their children would go 
out and give their community a good 
name, give their family a good name, 
and represent the race that could 
achieve anything by overcoming obsta-
cles. 
My hero is not an NFL player, a bas-
ketball player, or some person on TV,

who I had no idea who they were, what 
their character was. My hero was 
someone who I saw the mistakes that 
he made. He was not a perfect person, 
but he was a great father. That is my 
dad, Clarence Burgess Owens, Sr. 
Dad 
represented 
that 
generation 
very, very well. By the way, for those 
who don’t know, which I am sure most 
don’t because of the history that has 
been changed, my race has never been 
a race of hopeless, hapless people wait-
ing for White people to show up and 
give us freedom. We got freedom 
through the fight in which we partici-
pated in, the Civil War. There was no 
race that appreciated that freedom 
more than my race. 
For generations from that point on, 
we have had within our DNA a desire 
for freedom, the conservative values of 
home, family, free market, and faith. I 
grew up in a home that taught that. It 
was a good experience. 
My dad was raised by parents who did 
not finish high school. Well, my grand-
mother did finish high school when she 
was 50 years old. My grandfather 
dropped out when he was in the third 
grade. They were businessowners. 
But let me tell you how it works out 
in America, because every generation 
looks to help the next generation stand 
on their shoulders. In my community, 
that was the goal. In my family, that is 
exactly what happened. 
From those humble beginnings, those 
parents of four children that did not 
have an education, a formal education, 
that next generation were kids that 
had nothing but good education. My 
dad got his Ph.D. at Ohio State in 
agronomy. My uncle got his Ph.D. in 
economics at Ohio State in 1950 to 1951, 
the days of the KKK, Jim Crow, and 
segregation. 
I had an uncle who was an engineer. 
He was part time and decided he want-
ed to fly planes. In the early 1960s, this 
was something that no one ever did, 
and that is he purchased his own pri-
vate plane, a single prop. He would 
take mail from Wichita Falls, Texas, 
to Chicago. Who did that in 1960–61? 
Well, as a 12-year-old, I had a chance 
to experience and understand the op-
portunity to dream past my limita-
tions or perceived limitations. One 
time, he flew out to Tallahassee, where 
I had a chance to fly, for the first time, 
in this private plane. 
I learned something through that 
process. That is what that generation 
did. They wanted to make sure that 
every generation was getting more edu-
cated, more critical thinking skills. 
We went up. For those who don’t un-
derstand what a stall is, it is important 
to know what a stall is before you 
stall. He took us up and stalled the air-
plane. He saw that I was panicking. He 
grabbed the control and explained air-
plane lift. To this day, I can explain to 
you exactly what airplane lift looks 
like and how it feels. 
That was a generation that over-
came. 
Now, my dad grew up in Texas and 
went to war. He was in the Philippines, 
and this is in Japan, where he finished 
up. Again, he received some docu-
mentation because he ended up coming 
back from war to Texas. In those days, 
in Texas, because of Jim Crow laws, he 
could not get his postgraduate degree. 
I ran across a box of letters after dad 
passed 
away, 
something 
he 
never 
talked about, a box of rejection letters 
from colleges across our country, par-
ticularly the Northeast, that had re-
jected his application to get his post-
graduate degree. I knew it was because 
of race. I could see it in the applica-
tions, in the amount of letters I saw in 
this particular box. 
What is interesting about that gen-
eration, about dad, is he never com-
plained about it. He never pulled it out. 
He never said: ‘‘Well, this is what they 
did to me.’’ That was a generation that 
took rejection and took obstacles as 
motivation. That was a generation 
that said: If you don’t believe me, sit 
back and watch. I am going to run 
harder, study harder, work harder. I 
will prove that I will command your re-
spect 
because 
I 
do 
believe 
in 
meritocracy—which they did. 
He continued that process and got 
into Ohio State. Five years after grad-
uating from Ohio State with his Ph.D., 
we were living in Liberia, Africa. He 
was doing research there. 
Dad went on to teach for 40 years at 
Florida A&M. He was a researcher. He 
was a farmer for 35 of those years. He 
was a remarkable mentor, and he be-
lieved that our race, if given the oppor-
tunity of education, could achieve and 
move forward. 
Because he understood his past, be-
cause he was taught at that time the 
greatness of people like Booker T. 
Washington and the many people I am 
going to talk about in the next few 
minutes, he appreciated the progress 
that he had made and his family had 
made at that point, and he saw such a 
great future for those that were com-
ing behind him. 
I have a granddad who was a third 
grade dropout, a dad who was a college 
professor, and his son, who now stands 
before you in Congress. 
This country, there is nothing like it. 
It is time for us to understand: If you 
want a second chance, if you want to 
dream big, if you want to overcome, 
this is the place. And guess what? You 
will have help from every corner of this 
United States. Every culture, every re-
ligion, every color, it does not matter. 
Because in this country, we teach our-
selves to look at each other from the 
inside out, not the outside in. 
I refuse, as long as I stand in Con-
gress, to allow the left to demean my 
race’s past. I refuse to allow the left to 
narrate that my race was one that was 
hopeless, hapless, could not achieve, 
and sit back and look at nothing but 
the negative that happened. By the 
way, negative happens to every race, 
every culture, every person. It is life. It 
is what you do with it that makes us 
Americans. 
Americans never give up on our 
dream. We believe in something called 
meritocracy. We do not believe we 
should give this power over to any gov-
ernment power. We believe we should 
live our lives and move forward. 
If you think about the person who 
would appreciate, more than anyone 
else in this room, a full glass of water, 
that person would be the one who has 
not had a drop in days. That first drop 
would be like heaven. 
That was the Black community when 
freedom was given to us, a race that for 
generations never thought freedom was 
a possibility, a race that sent their 
sons to war, that volunteered because 
they understood the power of freedom. 
They understood the power of having 
their faith, that they could worship 
without someone beating them up or 
hanging them, one that believed in 
family because there was no guarantee 
in those days that a family would ever 
stay united. 
They believed in an idea called own-
ership of property, free market, to be 
creative, to get paid for your own 
work, your own effort, your own risk, 
and the benefit of education. 
There was no race in our country 
that understood and believed and ap-
preciated this more than mine did. 
There is a reason why, in the 1940s, 
1950s, and 1960s, it was the Black com-
munity that led our country in the 
growth of the middle class. Many grad-
uated from college. Many committed 
to 
marriage. 
Many 
became 
entre-
preneurs. 
There is a reason why, growing up in 
Tallahassee, I could look around in 
that community, not seeing a Black 
America, not associating with White 
America until I was 16 years old, and 
seeing nothing but business ownership 
everywhere, whether it be Baker’s 
Pharmacy, Perkins Service Station, 
Speed’s Grocery Store, FAMU Hospital 
with Black nurses and Black doctors. 
There were engineers, lawyers, and 
teachers. And the message was very 
simple: You live in America, young 
man. You can achieve anything you 
want to if you commit to those tenets 
that make our country great: faith, 
family, the free market, and education. 
We have had our representation of 
brave warriors throughout history, as 
we do today, frontline warriors who 
serve in the military, that go out every 
single day, that thin blue line to pro-
tect us from evil. 
Why is their contribution so impor-
tant? They believe in something very 
simple, and it is something from Book-
er T. Washington: You do not have to 
beg or ask for respect when you can 
command respect. You do not have to 
beg or demand somebody else’s prop-
erty in a free country when you can 
earn it yourself. 
How 
do 
we 
do 
that? 
Through 
meritocracy. How do we do that? By 
showing courage when others might 
feel fear.

Army Regiment from Massachusetts,

race. Or ask the 1869 Buffalo Soldiers 
or the World War II unit that went to 
Germany called the Black Rattlers, 
who 
the 
German 
called 
the 
Hellfighters, because they had so much 
respect for the way they fought and 
what they did. 
My race has stood on the shoulders of 
the great men and women I am going 
to talk about the next few minutes. 
One of the greatest, I realized, after my 
dad had passed and after I did my 
homework, that that entire generation 
listened to and built their lives around 
was Booker T. Washington. He was a 
former slave who started Tuskegee 
University in 1881. 
By 1905, it was creating more self- 
made millionaires than Harvard, Yale, 
and Princeton combined. Why? Because 
he was teaching those young people 
coming through not just to master one 
trade but two. Yes, work harder than 
the next guy. Yes, don’t complain 
about the work. Don’t complain about 
what is asked of you. Don’t do what is 
being taught to our kids today where 
kids say: Well, I have to work harder 
than the other guy because of my 
color. 
No, you have to work harder than the 
other guy because that is what Amer-
ica is about. You outrun, you outwork, 
you out-study. You find your greatest 
potential by what you put into your ef-
forts. You don’t lower your standards 
because somebody else has lowered 
theirs. We don’t do that. That is not 
America. 
b 1400 
Black History Month is dedicated to 
the heroes who rose above slavery, seg-
regation, and racism to champion life, 
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness 
for future generations. Because of their 
courage, Black Americans have made 
enormous strides to shape the soul of 
our Nation. 
From a childhood in the segregated 
South to serving in Congress, I am in-
spired by the tenacity of giants like 
Charles R. Drew, Robert Smalls, J. 
Mayo Williams, Bessie Coleman, Dr. 
Mildred Jefferson, Elizabeth Freeman, 
Sergeant William Carney, and so many 
others who fought for the founding 
ideals of liberty and equality. 
I would like to share with you a few 
of my heroes who have had a tremen-
dous impact on my life and the lives of 
countless, countless Americans. These, 
by the way, are Americans who were 
proud to be Americans. These are 
Americans proud of their race. These 
are Americans who saw their kids liv-
ing a much better dream, and the last 
thing they would do is tell them to 
stop dreaming. The last thing they 
would do is tell them the obstacles are 
too great for them. The last thing they 
would do is say these White people are 
going to keep you from achieving your 
dreams. No, we were taught it didn’t 
matter who it was or what it was, that 
we had within us the ability to over-
come all obstacles. 
Dr. Charles R. Drew was born in 1904 
here in D.C., breaking the barriers 
throughout his life of a racially divided 
America to become the most influen-
tial scientist of the 20th century. It 
was during his research into banked 
blood at Columbia University that his 
ultimate destiny in serving mankind 
was shaped. 
As World War II created an impor-
tant need for procedures to preserve 
blood, and injuries seen by physicians 
became more severe, the need for blood 
plasma intensified. As he was the lead-
ing authority in the field, Dr. Charles 
Drew was selected as a full-time med-
ical director of the Blood for Britain 
project, where he supervised the suc-
cessful collection of thousands of pints 
of vital plasma for the British, saving 
countless lives. 
In February 1941, Drew was appointed 
the director of the first American Red 
Cross Blood Bank and was put in 
charge of blood for the use of the U.S. 
Army and Navy. Dr. Drew returned to 
Freedmen’s Hospital and Howard Uni-
versity, where he served as a surgeon 
and professor of medicine from 1942 
until he passed away in 1950. 
Robert Smalls was born into slavery 
in Beaumont, South Carolina, and 
gained his freedom daringly and coura-
geously. He commandeered a Confed-
erate cargo ship and sailed the vessel 
into Union waters before being cap-
tured, freeing himself, his crew, and 
their families. 
His action that day helped persuade 
Lincoln to accept Black soldiers in the 
Union Army. He went on to serve in 
the Union’s Navy and was eventually 
elected to Congress. 
Elijah Abel was one of the early lead-
ers in the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day 
Saints, 
a 
popular 
mis-
sionary who, as a Black man, lived the 
restored gospel that was intended for 
Black and White, bond and free. 
Born in Texas in 1892, Bessie Cole-
man, also known as Queen Bess or 
Brave Bessie, was the first Black fe-
male pilot. Her mother, Susan, was a 
maid; her father, George, was a share-
cropper of Native American and Afri-
can-American descent. Bessie grew up 
helping her mother pick cotton and 
wash laundry to earn extra money. 
By the time she was 18, she had saved 
money to attend the Colored Agricul-
tural and Normal University, now 
Langston 
University, 
in 
Langston, 
Oklahoma. She dropped out of college 
after only one semester because she 
could not afford to attend. 
Bessie’s brothers, who both served in 
the military in World War I, came 
home with stories of their time in 
France, often teasing her that French 
women could learn how to fly air-
planes, but Bessie couldn’t. Because of 
this, she applied to many flight schools 
across the country, but no school 
would take her because she was a 
Black woman. 
With no opportunities in America, 
Bessie saved and saved, and finally ob-
tained scholarships to travel to France 
to flight school. She even had to take 
a French class at night to complete her 
flight school application. 
After finishing flight school, she 
toured the country, giving speeches, 
showing videos of her air tricks to earn 
money, refusing to speak anywhere 
that was segregated or that discrimi-
nated against Black Americans. 
In 1922, she performed the first public 
flight by an African-American woman. 
I want you to keep in mind these dates; 
these are the dates the other side of 
the aisle would like to tell you we were 
hopeless, hapless, and doing nothing. 
No, we were doing just like every other 
race in this country has, every other 
culture that has overcome obstacles. 
We had great vision, and we had great 
courage, and we succeeded big time. 
She became more popular both in the 
United States and Europe. She toured 
the country giving flight lessons, per-
forming in-flight shows, and she en-
couraged women to learn how to fly, 
becoming famous in America and Eu-
rope as a star pilot. 
On April 30, 1926, Bessie passed away 
in a tragic plane crash. She remains an 
inspiration to untold millions around 
the world. 
Madam C. J. Walker was born in 1867 
on a Delta, Louisiana, plantation, 
where her parents had been enslaved 
before the end of the Civil War. 
She and her sister grew cotton in 
Delta and Vicksburg, Mississippi, and 
survived by working in the fields. To 
escape abuse from her brother-in-law, 
she married Moses McWilliams at the 
age of 14. 
Following the death of her husband, 
she moved to St. Louis to join her four 
brothers, who had become barbers. 
With just $1.50 a day, she managed to 
save enough money to send her daugh-
ter to public school. 
As a talented entrepreneur with a 
skill for self-promotion, she often said, 
‘‘I got my start by giving myself a 
start.’’ How about that one? ‘‘I got my 
start by giving myself a start.’’ 
She was the first self-made woman 
millionaire in America, earning her 
fortune through her business empire, a 
line of hair care products especially for 
Black women she created after experi-
encing hair loss. The self-made million-
aire used her fortune to fund scholar-
ships for women and donated large 
parts of her wealth to charity. 
Elizabeth Freeman, better known as 
Mum Bett, was born into slavery but 
became the first slave to be freed under 
the Massachusetts Constitution. Less 
than 1 year after the adoption of the 
Massachusetts State Constitution, she 
filed a lawsuit for freedom, marking 
the beginning of a group of freedom 
suits that would ultimately lead the 
Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court 
to outlaw slavery in their State. De-
spite not knowing how to read or write, 
she 
was 
clever 
enough, 
strategic 
enough, determined enough to secure 
her freedom. 
She sought out the help of a local 
lawyer after being inspired by the con-
stitutional provision that all men were 
created free and equal. They won the 
case, implicitly ending slavery in the 
State of Massachusetts.

After securing her freedom, she be-
came a paid domestic worker and also 
made a living as a prominent healer, 
midwife, and nurse. After 20 years, she 
was able to buy her own house, where 
she lived with her children. She passed 
away December 28, 1829, at the age of 
85. 
It is amazing, these remarkable men 
and women who figured out the Amer-
ican Dream could work for them if 
they never gave up on it. 
J. Mayo Williams was one of the first 
Black professional football players in 
the 1920s and went on to become one of 
the most successful record producers in 
the 1930s and 1940s. He was the only 
man to be inducted into both the Na-
tional Football Hall of Fame and the 
Blues Hall of Fame. 
Senator Hiram Revels of Mississippi 
in 1870 became the first African Amer-
ican to serve in the U.S. Senate. As a 
member of the Republican Party, he 
challenged the social order and was an 
outspoken opponent against segrega-
tion, fighting for equality across racial 
lines. 
Sergeant William Carney was the 
first Black Medal of Honor recipient. 
He kept the American flag held high. 
He was born in Norfolk, Virginia, in 
1840 to a family of enslaved people. His 
parents 
bought 
their 
freedom 
and 
moved to Massachusetts. He enlisted in 
March 1863, and his unit, the 54th, 
which included two sons of abolitionist 
Frederick Douglass, headed down to 
South Carolina. 
By the way, the South Carolina Con-
federate President had made note that 
any Black soldier caught would be in-
stantly hung. This is what these men 
knew 
and 
understood, 
yet 
they 
marched south to fight for the freedom 
of their race and their country. 
Carney’s unit headed down to South 
Carolina. Their first combat mission 
was leading the charge on Fort Wagner 
in Charleston. Carney saw his unit’s 
flag bearer was shot and killed and ran 
to catch the American flag he was 
holding. Carney, too, was shot during 
the battle, but he held that flag high 
and crawled up the hill toward the fort. 
He planted the flag in the sand and 
kept holding on even after he was res-
cued. He was the first to receive the 
Medal of Honor. 
Let me tell you how acts like that of 
courage and knowing our history add 
up. As a seventh grader, I had the op-
portunity—I was chosen in my seg-
regated high school, junior high school 
to raise the flag in the morning and to 
bring it down in the afternoon—an 
honor. 
I remember walking to school every 
morning, early in the morning, and my 
friend, Spencer Williams, and I, we un-
derstood the nature of that flag, what 
it meant. My dad had come back from 
war, and how he felt about the flag, we 
were sure never to let that flag touch 
the ground. 
That reverence for our flag allowed 
me to feel proud as an NFL player to 
hear the national anthem, to see that 
flag flying on the sideline, getting 
teary-eyed. I was living my dream in a 
country that allowed for the American 
Dream to be alive and well. To see how 
far we had come in the 1970s, from my 
upbringing in the 1960s, to see my 
teammates of all colors, backgrounds, 
and creeds, that we could care less 
about our background, color, or creed. 
We cared about the fact that we want-
ed to win. We looked inside for those 
who had the character, tenacity, dis-
cipline, courage to play hard so we 
could win. That is America. That is 
what we do. 
Dr. Mildred Jefferson was the first 
Black woman to graduate from Har-
vard. She dedicated her life to pro-
tecting life at all stages. In 1951, Mil-
dred became the first Black woman to 
graduate from Harvard Medical School. 
By the way, she was a pro-life advo-
cate, just like my parents’ generation 
was across the board. We believe in our 
children, believe in our history and 
their future, and believe they are a gift 
from God. My race would not stand for 
what has happened today as we watch 
my race being targeted for abortion. 
She also was the first woman employed 
as a general surgeon at the Boston Uni-
versity Medical Center. 
Phillis Wheatley was born in West 
Africa and sold into slavery at the age 
of 
7. 
Despite 
being 
enslaved, 
she 
learned to read and write. Her Massa-
chusetts owners saw talent in her po-
etry skills and encouraged her. Phillis 
was brought by her owners to London, 
seeking to publish her work. She 
quickly rose to prominence when she 
published her book, ‘‘Poems on Various 
Subjects, Religious and Moral.’’ 
She became a talented poet. Her 
poems became popular and even drew 
the praise of George Washington and 
poet Jupiter Hammon. 
As I close this out, I can’t say enough 
how proud I am to have been raised in 
the time I was raised, in the commu-
nity I was raised in, in the race I was 
raised in, in a country that gave us all 
hope for a great future. 
Because we lived so close to Florida 
A&M and had all these college kids get-
ting engaged with civil rights, at the 
age of 12, I had the opportunity and de-
cided to join them for a demonstration 
in front of Florida’s State Theater. I 
was the youngest, but I witnessed what 
it was for young men and women to be 
disciplined, to be articulate, to be 
dressed well, to represent our race be-
cause it wasn’t just in front of Flor-
ida’s State Theater that we were mak-
ing an impact; it was those watching 
across our country. 
I want those who watch Martin Lu-
ther King’s demonstrations again to 
notice something about that remark-
able group of people. Notice the white 
shirts, the dark ties, the dress shoes. 
Notice the articulation of those who 
represented these great warriors, these 
leaders in freedom. Notice their dis-
cipline as they were attacked by dogs, 
fire hoses, people calling them names. 
Notice they did not retaliate. They did 
not go down and burn down buildings. 
They believed in the American people. 
They believed in this country, that 
they could command respect from 
around our country by being the best 
examples of what it was to be an Amer-
ican. 
b 1415 
They were Christians, and it was 
Martin Luther King’s view that by 
fighting in the way Christians could 
fight, nonviolently, they could earn the 
hearts of Americans across the coun-
try, and that is exactly what they did. 
See, what Martin Luther King was 
doing in our Nation at that time was 
not just fighting against the Jim Crow 
laws that we talk about all the time, 
the evil that we saw in the south per-
petrated on Black Americans by Demo-
crats, by the way, at that time. It was 
more than just Jim Crow that we were 
fighting against. It was a narrative 
that Black Americans couldn’t think, 
we weren’t leaders, we weren’t intel-
ligent, we were unkempt, we were un-
disciplined, we were cowards. That was 
the narrative that we fought against. 
That was the narrative that I faced 
when I left Tallahassee, Florida, with 
the goal of being a marine biology 
major and hearing through the grape-
vine from someone, a White person who 
had gone to Florida State, that I 
couldn’t do it because Blacks could not 
think in those days. That was the 
thought. 
Unlike today—I didn’t say I’m going 
to give up, I am going to quit, I am 
going to sue. I was taught that when 
somebody tells you you can’t, you 
prove them wrong. I spent the next 4 
years at the University of Miami living 
in a library when I wasn’t playing foot-
ball. I wanted to prove that guy wrong. 
That was the generation I was raised 
by, thank goodness. That guy probably 
never knew probably that I succeeded, 
but I knew. My parents knew. And now 
I can tell you the story that that is the 
way our race was. 
We have to fight this soft bigotry of 
low expectations, my friends. It is the 
worst of all evils. For people to wrap 
their arms around us, tell us how much 
they love us, and then tell us we can’t. 
To wake up to news reports that we 
have an administration that, for the 
sake of equity, is going to give Black 
people access to crack pipes. That is 
equity? We now have the opportunity 
to get free crack pipes. 
Equity is not lowering the standards. 
Equity, equality is raising the stand-
ards so high and telling every single 
child that can hear your voice that you 
can do it. That is equality. That is 
meritocracy. That is how we get re-
spect. You don’t beg for respect. You 
command respect. 
In closing, I often say that Black 
American history is so rich because of 
the heroes who came before us. 
These proud Black Americans broke 
countless barriers and have been life-
long inspirations for untold millions 
right here in America but also around 
the world.

February 9, 2022 
Black History Month is an important 
celebration and recognition of Amer-
ican history, and I am humbled to 
stand on the shoulders of the great 
men and women who came before me. 
I encourage all of you to read up on 
the true history of our Nation. The 
true history of our Nation is that we 
the people have done it. We the people 
with our good hearts established the 
Underground Railroad. I would not be 
here without their courage, their sac-
rifice, their vision. 
I am so thankful to have been taught 
to love our great Nation, to love the 
people before us, that are with us, and 
those in the future that we will fight 
for. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
f 
IF NOT NOW, WHEN? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. GREEN) for 
30 minutes. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
and still I rise, Mr. Speaker, and still I 
rise, proud to be an American, proud to 
be a Member of this august body, proud 
to say that I am a free man, unbought, 
unbossed, and unafraid, proud to speak 
truth to power and to speak truth 
about power, proud that my family 
who loved me dearly instilled in me a 
belief that I could do anything that 
anyone else could do. 
But they also taught me that there 
were obstacles in life, and that you will 
do some things, Alexander—that is my 
first name—because of, and you will do 
a good many things in spite of. And 
that has been the history of African 
Americans in this country. We have 
done a good many things because of 
people of good will who have befriended 
us, but we have also done a good many 
things in spite of people of ill will who 
have done all that they could to defeat 
us. But still we rise. Still we rise. 
And today, I would like to discuss 
the topic: If not now, when? If not now, 
when? And this topic I embrace be-
cause of the Supreme Court of the 
United States of America and the pos-
sibility of a person of African ancestry 
who happens to be a female being ap-
pointed. If not now, when? 
Let’s examine the facts. This is 
Black History Month. This is Black 
history. And there are facts that are 
undeniable, indisputable, incorruptible. 
Here are the facts, and here is why 
we find ourselves giving this speech 
today, making these statements today. 
Here are the facts. We have had a total 
number of Presidents of 45. Forty-five 
Presidents of the United States, one of 
color. One of color. Forty-five, one of 
color. Number of women, zero, of any 
color, any persuasion. 
The Presidency of the United States 
has been an all-male institution, and 
for the most part, overwhelmingly so, 
it has been a White male institution. 
Just the facts. That is all. 
Forty-five, one of color, zero women. 
Now, there are some people who find 
it offensive to hear facts. They find 
these facts to somehow cause them 
some degree of consternation. My dear 
friends, can you imagine how these 
facts impact people of color? How they 
feel, knowing that we have had 45 
Presidents, but only one of color? How 
these facts impact women? Forty-five 
Presidents, not one woman? 
So if it causes you some degree of 
consternation, just imagine what it 
does to people who happen to be 
women. Forty-five men, zero women. 
Now, let’s take a look at the Senate. 
If not now, when? Let’s look at the 
Senate. Total number of Senators in 
the United States of America. The 
total number is 1,944. 1,944 persons have 
had the honor, privilege, and pleasure 
of serving in the United States Senate. 
And it is a preeminent privilege, a su-
perlative pleasure, and a splendiferous 
honor to serve in the United States 
Senate. 1,944 have had this great, sin-
gular honor. 
Number of men: 1,886. 1,944 total Sen-
ators. Total men: 1,886. 
Let’s look at the number of men of 
color: 27. Number of women: 58. Num-
ber of White men: 1,857. The Senate has 
been around for over 200 years. For 
over 200 years—in fact, more than 230 
years—we can say that the Senate has 
been overwhelmingly White and over-
whelmingly White men. 
There are some people who find it un-
comfortable to hear these things said. 
Can you imagine how it must make 
these persons who have been excluded 
from the Senate, can you imagine how 
they feel? Can you imagine what they 
think when they would want to know 
that their children could have served in 
the Senate or had the opportunities 
that others have had? Yes, these are 
opportunities that have been denied 
some people. 
I love my country. It means some-
thing to me to be an American. I be-
lieve that we ought to have liberty and 
justice for all. That is why I do all that 
I can to make it real. I want to make 
real the great and noble American 
ideals, government of the people, by 
the people, and for the people. That has 
got to include all of the people. All per-
sons are created equal. That has got to 
include all persons. 
Number of men: 1,886. 
Now, the Senate of the United States 
of America is the institution that con-
firms persons who will be on the Su-
preme Court. So for over 200 years, we 
have had White men making the nomi-
nations—Presidents, 
remember 
45, 
White men for the most part; one, 
Barack Obama, a recent addition to the 
august club—White men have been 
nominating. And White men have been 
nominating other White men. White 
men nominating other White men. 1,886 
White men confirming other White 
men. 
This is Black History Month. If not 
now, when will we tell the truth about 
what is going on? 
Let’s now look at the Supreme Court 
itself. The Supreme Court, the highest 
court in the land. First assembled in 
1790, more than 200 years ago, more 
than 230 years ago, more than 232 years 
ago, 233-plus some months to be exact. 
Since this date when the Court was 
first assembled, we have had a total 
number of 115 justices. On the first 
court there were 6. Total number of 115 
justices. The number of men: 110. 110 
men. Number of women: 5. Number of 
Black women: Zero. 230-plus years, 115 
persons nominated and approved to the 
Supreme Court, 110 of them men. Num-
ber of women: 5. Number of Black 
women: Zero. 
If not now, when? When? We have had 
200-plus years to appoint an African- 
American female to the Court. If not 
now, when? 
Well, 
Congressman 
GREEN, 
Black 
women haven’t been qualified. Really? 
If you believe that, there is nothing 
wrong with Congressman GREEN, there 
is something wrong with you. 
b 1430 
Over this period of time, we have had 
40 persons to serve on the Supreme 
Court who haven’t been lawyers; 40 
nonlawyers. Over this period of time, 
we have had justices who had no under-
graduate degree; 5 no undergraduate 
degree; 40 not lawyers. 
The rules apply as they are applied, 
and the rules have been flexible. By the 
way, there is no requirement that you 
be a lawyer to serve on the Supreme 
Court of the United States of America. 
Mr. Speaker, 40 nonlawyers, 5 persons 
with no degree at all; yet, not one 
Black woman on the Supreme Court. 
There are people who don’t want this 
subject embraced. They don’t want it 
discussed because they would like to 
kind of see this happen, somehow it 
just occurs and everybody lives happily 
ever after. 
A lot of suffering has taken place to 
get to this point, and we ought not 
allow the truth about the consequences 
of being Black to escape us. It is just 
true that color has been a barrier to 
some people being on the Supreme 
Court—zero Black women, 115 Justices. 
If not now, when? When will we have 
a President who has the courage to do 
what should have been done many 
years ago. I thank God for President 
Biden, a man of his word and a man of 
courage. Courage makes the difference. 
There were great orators when Dr. 
King lived. There were persons who un-
derstood the issues as well as, and 
some who understood the issues better 
than Dr. King. What separated Dr. King 
from his contemporaries was his cour-
age. He had the courage to do what 
others were afraid to do. They wouldn’t 
speak up. They wouldn’t speak out. Be-
cause they knew there were con-
sequences for speaking up and speaking 
out. But Dr. King had the courage to 
look faith in the eye and say, I will do 
that which others could do, and some 
might even do better, but I will do it. 
He had the courage. So did John Lewis.

It was courage. This separates those 
who can do yet don’t do from those who 
get things done. 
President Biden made a commit-
ment. President Biden is honoring his 
commitment. Others have appointed 
persons to the Court because of who 
they were. This woman who will be ap-
pointed is not going to be a person 
without credentials. She will be a per-
son who is prepared. She will be a per-
son who is going to serve us well, and 
she will be a person who will make a 
difference on a court that over 200 
years has had 115 Justices, not one of 
them a Black woman; 115 Justices and 
not one a Black woman over some 230- 
plus years. If not now, when? 
Now is the time. President Biden is 
the person, and we are the people who 
ought to want to see it happen. I don’t 
have a candidate that I am pushing. I 
refuse to push a candidate, but I don’t 
refuse to tell the truth about the cir-
cumstances that exists. 
Mr. Speaker, just to make things per-
spicuously clear: 
First 
assembled, 
1790, 
Supreme 
Court. 
Number of Justices on the first 
court, 6. 
Total number of Justices since 1790, 
115. 
Total number of men, 110. 
Five women, not one Black woman. 
And let us not forget that the Senate 
of the United States of America has 
had a total of 1,944 persons, and 1,886 of 
them have been men; 45 Presidents, not 
one woman. 
What we have here is the definition 
of the good old boys club. The good old 
boys. White men who took care of 
other White men in the sense that they 
were supporting each other. White men 
were nominating, White men were ap-
proving, and White men got the job. 
This is the good old boys club. But we 
are breaking up the good old boys club. 
Diversity is breaking up the good old 
boys club. And many of the good old 
boys are not happy. They like things 
the way they were when their club was 
exclusively White and male. 
I don’t support the good old boys 
club. I am a free man, unbought, 
unbossed, and unafraid. Speak truth to 
power and about power. This is about 
power. This is about the good old boys 
club that has had its own form of af-
firmative action, exclusionary affirma-
tive action. Over 200 years of excluding, 
and you want to now complain that 
there is a possibility that one Black 
woman may be on the Court? And it 
upsets a good many persons to know 
that a Black woman may be on the 
Court. 
Mr. Speaker, 230-plus years. If not 
now, when? And if not this President, 
which President? I love my country. I 
believe that change is that which we 
bring about. Yes, the arc of the moral 
universe bends toward justice, as Dr. 
King put it, but it bends toward justice 
because we put our hand on the arc of 
the moral universe and we use our 
strength and our might and our will-
power to bend it toward justice. Not 
just for some, but for all. We, the peo-
ple, includes all of the people. 
Mr. Speaker, I look forward to seeing 
this great day when there will be the 
first African-American female on the 
Court, and I assure you that I will 
never forget the President who made it 
happen. If not now, when? 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
f 
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS 
SHOT IN 2021 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. ROY) for 30 
minutes. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I heard my 
colleague on the other side of the aisle 
and I certainly appreciate his friend-
ship and service. 
I would take some disagreement with 
my celebrating the extent to which the 
President of the United States has an-
nounced beforehand the race and sex of 
the next Supreme Court Justice. And I 
would remind my friend, my colleagues 
on the other side of the aisle, in gen-
eral, the extent to which the current 
President 
rejected, 
filibustered, 
blocked Janice Rogers Brown—notably 
both Black and female—he did so be-
cause she wasn’t the right kind of 
Black and female. You see, she was a 
conservative. She was not a leftist, a 
liberal. 
So the current President blocked, 
when he was in the United States Sen-
ate, filibustered, fought, broke the 
rules and the traditions of the Senate 
to do it. By the way, Janice Rogers 
Brown, a Black female, qualified but 
conservative, judge. So he refused to 
let her advance. Why? 
Now, the President of the United 
States is going out and lauding, prais-
ing his predetermination that the next 
Justice must be Black or female, un-
dermining the nominee before even 
making the nomination. 
I would note also that the President 
blocked, 
attacked, 
voted 
against 
Miguel Estrada. And did so, we know, 
for one reason. He was a Hispanic con-
servative. Now, how do we know that? 
We have a memo. Yes, indeed, a memo 
in black and white, spelled out among 
Democrat Senators and staffers back in 
2003. I happen to know this because I 
was a lawyer on the Senate Committee 
on the Judiciary. But my, how this 
town loves to sweep aside little details, 
like the current Democrat President of 
the United States working in coordina-
tion with Democrat Members of the 
United States Senate when he was a 
Senator to stop, to block, to filibuster 
Miguel Estrada because he is a His-
panic conservative. 
And we can’t have that, can we? Be-
cause it breaks the narrative. It de-
stroys the narrative. Republicans are 
anti-Hispanic. Republicans are anti- 
Black. We can’t have a Black conserv-
ative woman advance under a Repub-
lican President, George W. Bush. We 
can’t have Hispanic Miguel Estrada ad-
vance under a Republican, George W. 
Bush. 
But, no, no, will you hear Jen Psaki 
talking about that at the podium at 
the White House? Or will you hear 
more lies, lies about the whipping of 
migrants at our border? Will you hear 
her talk about the fact that no report 
has been generated by the Department 
of Justice or the Department of Home-
land Security or anybody else about 
the 
alleged 
whipping 
of 
migrants, 
which did not occur, which we know 
didn’t occur. By fact, we know it didn’t 
occur. 
But yet, the President of the United 
States and his own White House Sec-
retary sat at the podium and accused 
them, ‘‘them’’ being our Border Patrol 
agents, standing on the front lines, 
being ignored, underfunded, chastised, 
refused to say any apology since that 
day. They refused to look at the Border 
Patrol agents and say, You know, we 
are sorry. We got that wrong. No report 
forthcoming. 
Anybody sensing a theme that my 
Democrat friends and colleagues in the 
White House on the other side of the 
aisle love to make race an issue? But 
they are going to sweep aside the kill-
ing of Miguel Estrada’s nomination be-
cause he is a Hispanic male, Hispanic 
conservative; sweep aside the blocking 
of Janice Rogers Brown; sweep aside 
running to cry racism and whipping of 
the Rio Grande when it is the policies 
of the Secretary of Homeland Security 
that is specifically and intentionally 
endangering 
the 
American 
people; 
causing our young children across this 
country to die from poisonings and 
overdoses; causing bullets to be fired 
upon our law enforcement officers in 
Texas; ranchers to get overrun, live-
stock to get out, cartels to get empow-
ered. And the Secretary of Homeland 
Security literally refuses to enforce 
any of the laws to stop that from hap-
pening. 
But, oh, no, he can’t bring himself, 
and Jen Psaki can’t bring herself, and 
the President can’t bring himself to 
look in the eyes of the Border Patrol 
and say they apologize for saying that 
they were whipping human beings. 
b 1445 
That is the state of the Democrat 
Party’s commitment to race. It is all a 
fraud. It is all a fiction. It is all a 
front. It is all about continuing to fo-
ment racial division for partisan polit-
ical gain. It has nothing to do about 
judging people by the content of their 
character and not the color of their 
skin because if it were, Janice Rogers 
Brown would not have been blocked 
and Miguel Estrada would not have 
been blocked. The President of the 
United States wouldn’t be standing up 
at a lectern today predetermining the 
race and the sex of the next Justice of 
the United States Supreme Court. 
Mr. Speaker, I came down here today 
to talk about our law enforcement

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1106 
February 9, 2022 
community. A year and a half ago, I 
sat here on the floor of the House— 
maybe in the same spot—with the 
number 43 similarly positioned on a 
board. That 43 represented the number 
of law enforcement police officers 
killed in the line of duty at that time. 
Well, saying to the Speaker and to 
my colleagues—who, of course, nota-
bly, as I like to observe, are not here. 
This is our idea of debate, you know, in 
the United States House of Representa-
tives. On fly-out day, everybody is get-
ting home. Nobody is here. 
We never have actual debate. We 
never offer amendments. We never 
have a back and forth. We come back 
and have showboats and give speeches 
on the Capitol steps about how Repub-
licans are better than Democrats or 
Democrats are better than Repub-
licans. We never sit down here and ac-
tually debate. If we did, then we could 
have honest debate about policies that 
will protect this country and protect 
law enforcement officers from the con-
stant barrage and attack levied against 
them across this country. 
I am sick and tired of seeing nonstop 
attacks on our law enforcement com-
munity for being the ones on the front 
lines every day dealing with crime and 
figuring out how to protect our com-
munities yet getting tossed under the 
bus, cast aside as being the ones that 
we should be targeting. 
Eighty-four dead law enforcement of-
ficers across this country last year; 346 
officers were shot in the line of duty; 
103 ambush-style attacks on law en-
forcement officers, up 115 percent from 
the year before; 4 police officers were 
beaten to death; 3 were stabbed to 
death. 
Sergeant Joshua Bartlett, Lubbock 
County Sheriff’s Office in Texas, shot 
and killed during a barricade at a home 
on July 15 of last year. Earlier in the 
morning, the subject had been stopped 
by a Texas Highway Patrol trooper for 
reckless driving and attempted to bait 
the officer into a confrontation. He re-
turned home after the encounter and 
began walking around the neighbor-
hood with a firearm at 1:15. 
When officers of the Levelland Police 
Department arrived, the man opened 
fire and barricaded himself inside. The 
regional SWAT team was requested as 
the man randomly fired shots from the 
home. 
Sergeant 
Bartlett 
was 
a 
United 
States Army veteran. He is survived by 
his wife, four sons, parents, and a 
brother. 
Police 
Officer 
Mitchell 
Aaron 
Penton, Dallas, Texas, was struck and 
killed by a vehicle operated by an in-
toxicated driver on February 13, 2021. 
At the time of his death, he had a step-
son, and his wife was expecting. 
Police Officer Brandon M. Stalker, 
Toledo Police Department, Ohio, was 
shot and killed during a barricade in-
volving an arson suspect. Officer Stalk-
er was on a perimeter position and was 
struck in the head and fatally wound-
ed. He is survived by his two children 
and fiance. 
Police Officer Jimmy Inn was shot 
and killed while responding to a do-
mestic violence call on May 11, 2021. He 
had served with the Stockton Police 
Department for 6 years. He is survived 
by his wife, 7-month-old son, and two 
stepchildren. 
Sergeant James Smith, Iowa State 
Patrol, Iowa, was shot and killed while 
attempting to arrest a subject who had 
assaulted and disarmed another law en-
forcement officer during a traffic stop 
on April 2, 2021. He is survived by his 
wife, two children, mother, brother, 
and sister. 
Lieutenant Michael Boutte was shot 
and killed after responding to a call in-
volving a subject attempting suicide. 
He was a United States Air Force vet-
eran and served with the Hancock 
County Sheriff’s office for 8 years. He 
is survived by his wife and two chil-
dren. 
Police Officer Chris Oberheim, Cham-
paign Police Department, Illinois, was 
shot and killed at about 3:20 a.m. while 
responding to a domestic disturbance 
call. He had been on the job 20 years. 
He was 44 with a wife and four children. 
Trooper Chad Michael Walker, Texas 
Department of Public Safety, March 28, 
2021, succumbed to gunshot wounds 
sustained 5 days earlier when he was 
ambushed while stopping to assist 
what he believed was a disabled vehicle 
near Mexia, Texas. He served with the 
Texas Highway Patrol for 6 years. He 
had 18 years in law enforcement. He is 
survived by his wife, 15-year-old son, 
twin 7-year-older daughters, and a 2- 
month-old daughter. 
Here are some of the quotes from my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
and at the other end of Pennsylvania 
Avenue about police officers. 
Jen Psaki, White House press sec-
retary, while criticizing FOX News cov-
erage of soft-on-crime policies, stated, 
while laughing, ‘‘What does that even 
mean?’’ and referred to the coverage as 
an alternative universe. 
President Biden famously expressed 
support for the defund the police move-
ment in 2020 and then had to walk that 
back after backlash. 
Vice President KAMALA HARRIS ap-
plauded 
Los 
Angeles 
Mayor 
Eric 
Garcetti for defunding the police. 
Representative OCASIO-CORTEZ
said, 
‘‘Defunding police means defunding po-
lice,’’ arguing the cuts to the New 
York 
Police 
Department 
weren’t 
enough. 
Representative 
AYANNA
PRESSLEY 
said she supports efforts to defund po-
lice departments. 
Representative RASHIDA TLAIB called 
for ‘‘no more’’ police. TLAIB’s campaign 
has paid over $150,000 to defund the po-
lice activist Rasha Mubarak. 
Representative ILHAN OMAR said: 
Not only do we need to defund, we need to 
dismantle police departments. 
Representative CORI BUSH said that 
she would ‘‘make sure’’ she has private 
security for her protection while simul-
taneously promising to defund the po-
lice. 
This 
weekend, 
Representative 
BUSH doubled down in her support for 
defunding our police departments on 
Twitter. 
President Biden’s Assistant Attorney 
General, Kristen Clarke, supported ef-
forts to defund the police. 
President Biden’s Associate Attorney 
General, Vanita Gupta, said officials 
must heed calls to ‘‘decrease police 
budgets and the scope, role, and re-
sponsibility of police in our lives.’’ 
President Biden’s Secretary of Labor, 
Marty Walsh, proposed a budget to di-
vert funding from law enforcement. 
We see now what is happening in 
Minnesota, where you have one of the 
individuals who was a part of the mob 
violence riots in the summer of 2020, 
who burned down a store, a commercial 
property, and did so with video footage 
indicating the glee of doing so—this 
being an individual with a very long 
criminal record. 
The man who owned or worked at the 
establishment, I think, had five kids 
and died as a result of the fire set by 
this 
individual 
in 
Minnesota. 
The 
United States Attorney’s Office in Min-
nesota filed a sentencing brief that 
read exactly like the defense lawyer’s 
brief, citing all the events of the sum-
mer, completely offsetting the dead fa-
ther of five with a store burned to the 
ground during mob violence rule in the 
summer of 2020. 
This United States Department of 
Justice, this United States Attorney’s 
Office in Minnesota, downward de-
parted from the sentencing guidelines 
of 20 years down to 10 years, purpose-
fully citing the political interest of the 
summer of 2020, the political cause of 
the summer of 2020, in recommending 
that downward departure despite the 
criminal record of the perpetrator of 
the crime, despite the destroyed and 
burned down building, despite the 
death of the owner of the store and the 
fact that he had multiple children. All 
of that was cast aside in the political 
judgment, not even of the judge, but of 
the United States Attorney’s Office. 
Lo and behold, that acting United 
States attorney a few months later is 
now working at Main Justice. I would 
sure like to know why. I would sure 
like to know who was involved. I would 
sure like to know who made the calls. 
I would sure like to know from the cur-
rent acting United States attorney if 
that acting United States attorney 
agrees 
with 
the 
sentencing 
rec-
ommendations of the so-called prosecu-
tors in the Minnesota U.S. Attorney’s 
Office who turned a blind eye to their 
duty to keep the streets safe, to pros-
ecute them under their oath to the 
Constitution and defense of the laws of 
the United States to protect the people 
of Minnesota, and chose to choose a po-
litical path, and chose to follow poli-
tics rather than do their job. 
We want to know. We are going to 
ask questions in the House Judiciary 
Committee. I can assure you that if the 
good people of the United States were 
to give the majority to the Republicans 
in January 2023, there are going to be

some questions asked and some an-
swers delivered by this administration 
for their failure to enforce the laws of 
the United States while American peo-
ple die, lose property, are harmed, are 
killed. At the border of Texas or in 
Minnesota—it doesn’t matter—the laws 
of the United States are supposed to be 
enforced, and we should be standing up 
for the rule of law. 
We are going to demand answers to 
questions. I want answers from the 
United States Attorney General for 
targeting parents for daring to stand 
up to school boards. I want answers 
from the Secretary of Homeland Secu-
rity for his clearly impeachable con-
duct for recklessly ignoring the laws of 
the United States, endangering my 
people and constituents in Texas, en-
dangering the people of this country 
while empowering cartels and allowing 
fentanyl to pour into our schools. I 
want answers. We are going to demand 
answers. 
We are going to want answers and de-
mand answers from Anthony Fauci and 
all the bureaucrats at NIH and CDC for 
shutting down our schools, shutting 
down our economy, lying about what 
we were seeing in terms of gain of func-
tion research in China. 
We are going to want answers, and we 
are going to get those answers. While 
this body fiddles, we will demand an-
swers if the American people will give 
us the ability to get them. 
I mentioned our situation at our bor-
der. We are in the midst of a fentanyl, 
opioid, and drug crisis in this country, 
the likes we have not seen before. 
b 1500 
Those of us who grew up in the 
eighties know what we saw with the 
cocaine epidemic. I was a 14-year-old 
when Len Bias notoriously died from 
an overdose within a week of being 
drafted by the Boston Celtics after his 
career at the University of Maryland. 
We know the horrors of the cocaine 
epidemic that led, by the way, to the 
crime bills of the 1990s supported by 
this President, supported by Black 
Americans across this country and lob-
bied for by Black pastors and Black 
leaders across this country because of 
the violence and the epidemic of drugs 
across our cities and across our towns 
in the 1980s and 1990s. We responded, 
and as a result, the crime rate went 
down. 
And now what are we seeing? 
Massive spikes in crime, massive 
spikes in drug use, carjackings in our 
Nation’s Capital where it is easier to 
get carjacked than to order a ham-
burger while we are under lockdowns, 
and vaccine mandates and vaccine 
passports in the Nation’s Capital. 
Side note: Yet another reason why we 
should never let the District of Colum-
bia be a State. It is not supposed to 
have the political interest of a State. It 
is supposed to be our National Capital 
where people can come and go, where 
they can petition their government, 
and where they can come and do the 
business of the people. So we will ad-
dress that issue as well in the next 
Congress. 
I am proud to represent Texas, but 
Texas is under assault. Texas is under 
assault every day by cartel-driven vio-
lence fueled by China and driven by the 
profit motive of pouring fentanyl into 
our communities, destroying our chil-
dren’s lives, causing addiction, causing 
death, and causing destruction. And 
this administration not only does noth-
ing, it is worse than that, this adminis-
tration purposefully—purposefully—ig-
nores the laws of the United States to 
the detriment and the endangerment of 
the American people. 
There is no other way to put it when 
our laws require operational control of 
the border and we do not have it. 
There is no other way to put it when 
our ranches are overrun, fences are cut, 
and livestock gets out. 
There is no other way to put it when 
there are stash houses in Houston, in 
San Antonio, in Laredo, in Del Rio, in 
McAllen, in Arizona, and in California. 
In every big city across this country 
there are stash houses where human 
beings are being moved for profit. 
There is no other way to put it when 
the current administration is releasing 
people into the United States. They are 
knowingly, in violation of law, releas-
ing people into the United States under 
the guise of so-called asylum. They 
know it is not asylum, and they know 
it is not credible fear. They know they 
are releasing single, adult males. They 
are lying about it because we see them 
talking about the lies on tape. 
And the American people are the 
ones holding the bag. The American 
people are the ones who have their kids 
dying because they take a Xanax that 
is laced with fentanyl. And this admin-
istration doesn’t care. 
This administration ignores the rule 
of law, ignores the Secure Fence Act, 
lets fencing rust in the field, and fails 
to require the fence to continue to be 
constructed which would help support 
Border Patrol and the communities in 
south Texas. 
But let me send a very clear warning 
signal to my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle: My colleagues take 
for granted the people of south Texas, 
as a political matter. And I can tell 
you, the people of south Texas are tired 
of it. The people of south Texas are 
tired of being on the front lines of a 
cartel-driven 
drug-and-human-traf-
ficking war with bullets flying, people 
dying, morgues filled, and rape trees 
being used. 
And this body, the people’s House, 
not only sits silent, they facilitate it, 
and they facilitate the Department of 
Justice and the Department of Home-
land Security who does nothing but 
fuel the crisis even more. 
Mr. Speaker, 100,306 Americans are 
dead as a result of drug overdoses or 
poisonings. 
Mr. Speaker, how many minutes are 
remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Texas has 4 minutes re-
maining. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I do want to 
finish by saying, it is our duty to se-
cure the border of the United States. It 
is the duty of the Secretary to secure 
the border of the United States. There 
are 100,000 dead Americans as a result 
of wide-open borders, and it is im-
peachable conduct by the Secretary of 
Homeland Security. We are going to 
address that issue if the American peo-
ple will give us the ability to be in the 
majority. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Arkansas (Mr. HILL). 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
friend from Texas for yielding. I want 
to say, first and foremost, I thank him 
for his consistent, loud, smart, and 
well-reasoned comments on our open 
border and the impact on our citizens. 
Mr. Speaker, I too want to bring at-
tention to this criminal issue. 
I have this Sweet-N-Low packet that 
so many of us put in our coffee in the 
morning, and that illustrates, Mr. 
Speaker, that that one amount of 
sweetener, if it were fentanyl, would 
kill 500 Americans. 
In Arkansas, fentanyl deaths are up 
441 percent since 2015. Over 600 Arkan-
sans have lost their lives. Every 5 min-
utes we lose a neighbor to an acci-
dental drug overdose. Just last year, as 
my friend from Texas said, we lost over 
100,000 
Americans 
to 
accidental 
overdoses, which is now the leading 
cause of death between the ages of 18 
and 45. We were here on this floor 3 
years ago lamenting 55,000 Americans 
dying in 1 year—the same we lost in 
the entire Vietnam war—and now it is 
100,000. 
Fentanyl is directly responsible for 
64 percent of those deaths, Mr. Speak-
er, and a majority of that fentanyl 
within the United States comes from 
our porous Southwest border—the bor-
der that the Biden administration has 
continuously failed to secure—as it 
flows directly into our communities. 
Last year, enough fentanyl was inter-
dicted—that is what we caught—by our 
overworked Border Patrol to kill every 
American seven times over. It isn’t 
enough to confiscate it at the border. 
We need strong leadership to discour-
age it from arriving in the first place, 
and we can do that by permanently 
scheduling fentanyl as a schedule I sub-
stance and increase the criminal pen-
alties. 
We need strong leadership and strong 
policies to secure our border and re-
spond to the illicit fentanyl that has 
been found in every street drug. Until 
then, sadly, as noted by my friend from 
Texas, Americans will continue to die 
at the hand of fentanyl. 
CHEERING ON TEAM USA 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, as we cheer 
on Team USA this week and celebrate 
our athletes participating in the 2022 
winter games, it is important we do 
not overlook the sins of the host na-
tion, China. 
China has carefully crafted their 
image to distract the world from their 
blatant human rights abuses and their 
totalitarianism.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1108 
February 9, 2022 
The 
International 
Olympic 
Com-
mittee has worked to portray China in 
a positive light. The truth is, China is 
an authoritarian state set on the de-
struction of anyone and anything that 
doesn’t adhere to its world view. 
The Chinese Communist Party be-
lieves that its administrative control 
over its people is the most effective 
form of governance. The Uyghurs con-
tinue to face genocide and crimes 
against humanity. The people of Hong 
Kong have seen the destruction of their 
liberal state. China seeks to expand its 
influence in the world through its pred-
atory lending and its failed Belt and 
Road Initiative. 
We can do better. We need American 
leadership to counter this. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I agree with 
the gentleman’s remarks about China, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time.

UKRAINE: THE SCRIMMAGE LINE 
FOR LIBERTY IN EUROPE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR) 
for 30 minutes. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on the subject of my 
Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Ohio? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today as co-chair of the 50-member bi-
partisan Congressional Ukraine Caucus 
to voice our strong support for Ukraine 
and her people. 
Ukraine is the scrimmage line for 
liberty on the European continent—our 
very closest allies. Right now, the 
world is watching with growing alarm 
as Russia again beats the Kremlin’s 
drums of war. 
Vladimir Putin, with his thirst for 
force over reason and the rule of law, is 
severely isolated from the norms of 
human decency and the global commu-
nity. Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014. 
Fourteen thousand people have been 
killed. While Ukraine is Putin’s most 
immediate target, it certainly is not 
the only one he has his eyes on. As we 
have watched, Russia has taken pieces 
of Armenia, Georgia, Moldova, and the 
message is clear. 
Thirty years ago, the people of 
Ukraine voted by more than 90 percent 
to 
establish 
their 
independence. 
Ukraine was a signatory to the Buda-
pest Memorandum in which the West 
guaranteed Ukraine’s security in re-
turn for all nuclear weapons staged on 
its territory be removed. 
Will the West keep its promise? 
For decades, the Soviet Union held 
Ukraine, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, 
Moldova, and so many others under its 
iron fist suppressing any notion of free-
dom. We have a map here that clearly 
shows how small Ukraine is compared 
to the vast Russian Empire. We are not 
talking about equal partners here. 
In 1991 the world rejoiced when, at 
long last, the Communist Iron Curtain 
fell—a moment the free world did not 
expect to see in modern time. Upon its 
fall, liberty and opportunity, which 
once had only been dreams, now be-
came new possibilities in Ukraine. 
Over these last 30 years, Ukraine has 
struggled to cast off Russian inter-
ference and grow into a strong, proud, 
and vibrant nation. It has been a strug-
gle every day of every year. 
Having visited Ukraine more than 
any other Member of Congress, I know 
her people, her communities, her cul-
ture, and her struggle. In 2014 I joined 
then-Vice President Joe Biden and Sen-
ator John McCain to attend the inau-
guration of a new President of Ukraine. 
As our delegation walked down the 
streets of the capital city, I can guar-
antee you, Mr. Speaker, the applause 
and cheers that rang forth from the 
crowd as America walked down the 
street was absolutely unforgettable 
and astounding. Ukraine’s freedom-lov-
ing people were exclaiming their love 
and friendship with the United States, 
but, most of all, with the idea of lib-
erty. Liberty. It is a memory that I 
cherish and will never forget. 
The people of Ukraine, yes, they have 
hopes and dreams, and they want to 
live with safety, stability, and endur-
ing prosperity, but, most of all, with 
liberty. Those hopes and dreams face 
constant threat by Russia. It seems to 
never stop. Ukraine has no desire to 
have its back broken under Russia’s re-
pressive command. 
In 2014 Russia illegally invaded, as I 
mentioned, and now over 14,000 of her 
people have been killed in Ukraine. 
Over 1 million more have been dis-
placed, and the country probably has 
under 40 million people now. 
Russia’s physical territory represents 
Goliath in his battle against David. 
The maps clearly show how vast Russia 
is—over 13 time zones compared to 
Ukraine. 
We see the Russian military amass-
ing at all the borders of Ukraine. If 
Russia again invades Ukraine, the in-
ternal opposition would be fierce and 
bloody, and that country suffered more 
than any other people in the world dur-
ing World War II, that infamous period 
of time when so many Americans died 
on the European continent for the very 
idea of liberty in Europe. 
The response that is needed from 
global leaders is clear. When freedom 
and liberty fall under attack, the free 
world has an obligation to rise up in its 
defense. 
The United States is doing its part. I 
support President Biden and his admin-
istration having committed to end the 
Nord Stream 2 project if Russia invades 
Ukraine further. We must continue to 
stiffen sanctions and work to establish 
European 
energy 
independence 
and 
forge a global defensive shield for the 
protection of Ukraine. 
b 1515 
The United Nations, NATO, and the 
Organization for Security and Co-Oper-
ation in Europe have the ability to 
rally a global coalition to ward off 
Putin and his thirst for domination 
over countries that do not welcome 
him. 
Russia cannot be allowed to operate 
as the outlaw on the European Con-
tinent. So let us seek to build, not de-
stroy. The time has come for the free 
world to soundly reject Putin’s ugly 
schemes and work together to safe-
guard Ukraine now and forever. 
There are several Members who are 
joining us here today on the floor to 
participate in this Special Order. I 
would like to especially recognize 
BRIAN
FITZPATRICK, the co-chair of 
Ukraine Caucus from Pennsylvania. 
We also have, I believe, Congressman 
KWEISI MFUME of Maryland, Congress-
man ANDY LEVIN of Michigan, and Con-
gresswoman VICTORIA SPARTZ of Indi-
ana, thus far. I thank them all for 
being here. 
I yield to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK). 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank Representative KAPTUR for all 
she does for Ukraine. 
Mr. Speaker, I stand here not only as 
the co-chair of Ukraine Caucus, but 
also the ranking member of the House 
Subcommittee on Europe, Energy, the 
Environment, and Cyber; and a com-
mission on the Helsinki Commission, 
having previously served and lived in 
Ukraine, in Kiev, standing side by side 
with the Ukranian people, and growing 
to love them for their heart, their pas-
sion, their desire for independence, 
their desire for closer ties to the West, 
and their craving for freedom, some-
thing that they are striving for more 
and more every single day. 
With all of those things in context, 
Mr. Speaker, this moment before us, 
unfortunately, has not come as a sur-
prise. Over the last 8 years, the amaz-
ing people of Ukraine have endured 
Russia’s illegal and violent occupation. 
To date, some 14,000 innocent Ukrain-
ians have perished, many of whom were 
civilians with more than a million dis-
placed. 
The autocratic regime of Vladimir 
Putin has engaged in countless human-
itarian violations and challenged inter-
national norms of sovereignty over the 
last 30 years, and it is imperative that 
the United States and our NATO allies 
meet this moment with deterrence and 
diplomacy and strength in unity. 
America must, as we have in the 
past, 
stand 
up 
against 
Russian 
authoritarianism. 
The 
people 
of 
Ukraine share our Western values and 
deserve freedom from Russian oppres-
sion. The people of Ukraine share a 
steadfast commitment to regional co-
operation resisting polarization and 
shining a light on corruption. The 
United States has moved to supply

February 9, 2022 
Ukraine with lethal aid to maintain its 
borders in the wake of increased Rus-
sian aggression. 
The United States has committed 
just recently an additional $200 million 
in security assistance, and we must en-
courage our NATO allies to act in a 
similar fashion. We applaud those 
NATO allies who have stepped up to 
the plate and encourage those who 
have not that they must do so now to 
maintain the NATO alliance. We have 
already stepped up to defend democ-
racy in so many other areas of the 
world and this must be no exception. 
It is my hope, Mr. Speaker, that 
more of our ally countries will take 
this charge seriously and realize what 
is at stake. It is also my hope that our 
allies can look to decouple with the 
Russian economy, recognizing the larg-
er threat Putin’s destabilizing regime 
poses throughout Europe and through-
out the world. Taking decisive action 
in implementing economic sanctions to 
the harshest degree is necessary, and 
we must weigh all of our options given 
the severity of this moment, along 
with a wide, bipartisan coalition in 
both Chambers of Congress. 
My 
colleagues 
in 
Congress 
have 
called for sweeping sanctions on the 
kleptocrats that keep Putin’s regime 
operable. As it has before with other 
rogue powers, the international com-
munity must send a clear and un-
equivocal message. If Russia insists on 
threatening the sovereignty of another 
state and jeopardizing global security, 
there will be the harshest of con-
sequences. 
I would like to thank my co-chairs 
for being here today as well as Rep-
resentative VICTORIA SPARTZ, the first- 
ever Ukrainian born Member of Con-
gress, an immense source of pride for 
the people of Ukraine. We are here to 
send a bipartisan, bicameral message 
to Vladimir Putin and his corrupt re-
gime that these consequences will far 
outweigh any benefit he may perceive 
of further aggression in Ukraine. 
If the Euromaidan Revolution should 
have sent any message to Russia, it is 
that you never underestimate the 
heart and the passion of the soul of 
Ukrainian people to defend their own 
independence. 
The 
overwhelming 
majority 
of 
Ukrainians were born after 1991, after 
their independence. They do not want 
any part of Russia regardless of what 
Vladimir Putin thinks. And we will 
stand behind them unequivocally and 
unapologetically 
to 
call 
for 
the 
harshest of consequence should Vladi-
mir Putin take one step across the 
Ukrainian border. 
I personally will make it my mission 
here in this body to see that they re-
ceive the harshest consequences, the 
least of which will be ending Nord 
Stream 2 and removing Russia from 
the Swiss banking system, cutting off 
their economy, targeting sanctions to 
Vladimir Putin himself and his sur-
rounding oligarchs. 
I say to Mr. Putin that that will be 
just the beginning of what he will face. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank Congressman FITZPATRICK
for 
his strong support of Ukraine and for 
the substance he has given from his 
own life prior to his service here in the 
Congress of putting that life at risk 
many times on behalf of liberty around 
the world. I thank him so very, very 
much. 
I yield to the gentleman from Michi-
gan (Mr. LEVIN), who is a very fervent 
supporter of Ukraine, and thank him 
for adjusting his schedule to be here 
with us this evening. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to join my colleagues in 
the House Ukraine Caucus in this 
strong show of resolve to keep our 
focus on what is happening in Ukraine 
and on its borders. And I especially 
want to thank my dear friend, Chair 
MARCY KAPTUR, for her leadership in 
organizing this timely event, and the 
co-chair, BRIAN
FITZPATRICK, for his 
strong leadership on this issue and all 
of the other Members who are joining 
today. 
I represent one of the most vibrant 
Ukrainian-American communities in 
the United States. And I have spent 
time with my constituents in Michigan 
at memorials and commemorations of 
the Holodomor, and even just last 
weekend at a peace vigil in a Ukrain-
ian church to pray for peace and for no 
more war in Ukraine. 
The Ukrainian-American community 
in Metro Detroit and around this Na-
tion is deeply worried about their fam-
ily, about their friends in Ukraine, and 
what might happen if Russia were to 
newly invade their country because we 
know Russia has already invaded their 
country. 
It is 8 years of Russia invasion and 
occupation of Crimea and their inter-
ference in the Donbas and eastern parts 
of Ukraine, and it has been a really 
traumatizing time for Ukrainians, ob-
viously, but also for Ukrainian-Ameri-
cans. 
I have been supportive of the efforts 
here in the House and by the Biden ad-
ministration to focus on both deter-
rence and diplomacy. I am proud to co-
sponsor the Defending Ukraine Sov-
ereignty Act which seeks to deter Rus-
sia by imposing tougher sanctions by 
providing more defensive equipment 
and weapons, and expanding program-
ming 
to 
counter 
Russian 
disinformation and cyber activity. 
I also want to commend President 
Biden emphasizing diplomacy to dees-
calate tension. Above all, we must 
avoid a war between the two largest 
nuclear powers. I appreciate how much 
he has worked to unify all of our Euro-
pean allies behind this effort, and I ap-
preciate the leadership of those Euro-
pean allies in pushing for a peaceful 
resolution to this situation. 
Mr. Speaker, I am glad to join with 
my colleagues today and to share this 
commitment to helping the Ukrainian 
people, and I am hopeful that our work 
in the Congress, coupled with measures 
taken by the Biden administration, 
will ultimately prevent more conflict 
from breaking out. But we have got to 
make it very, very clear to Vladimir 
Putin that he will get exactly what he 
doesn’t want if he insists on attacking 
Ukraine further. 
He has said he wants less NATO in-
volvement in the eastern reaches of the 
alliance, and his aggression and his 
provocation is causing just what he 
says he doesn’t want. So I am hopeful 
that diplomacy can carry the day, but 
we have to be ready with all measures 
of deterrence to prevent an attack, and 
we have to be—even though it doesn’t 
make sense to implement sanctions in 
advance, it definitely makes sense that 
we be very clear with Putin and the 
oligarchs and the people around him 
just as Representative FITZPATRICK 
said, that we will implement a broad 
array of sanctions, by far, the harshest 
array of sanctions that we have ever 
arrayed against them. 
Before I yield back, Congresswoman 
KAPTUR, I just wanted to share that 
when I was at my most recent event in 
the community in Michigan, I said— 
and Congresswoman SPARTZ, I want to 
say this to you because I haven’t had a 
chance to talk to you about this idea— 
let’s organize a vigil at the Holodomor 
Memorial here near Union Station 
when we are back to stand in solidarity 
with the people of Ukraine. 
Let’s get as many Members of Con-
gress there as we can. That idea seems 
to be taking off with the Ukrainian- 
American community. So I hope we 
will soon have a date when we can an-
nounce an event there where we can 
show our solidarity with the people of 
Ukraine. 
Lord knows, we love Ukraine. It is an 
independent country that deserves to 
have its own borders respected and 
where the people deserve to democrat-
ically determine their own future and, 
Congresswoman KAPTUR, we are never 
going to give up on our commitment to 
those principles. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Congressman LEVIN for his leadership 
on this, and we will work with him on 
the vigil at the Holodomor Memorial 
here in Washington, D.C. 
I thank the gentleman for taking the 
time to delay his flight back home, I 
am sure, to be with us. The gentleman 
reminds me when we look at the map 
of Russia in red and Ukraine in yellow, 
we think about David and Goliath—at 
least I do—and David deserves atten-
tion and respect. 
We thank you for your time this 
evening. And also I wanted to say to 
Congresswoman VICTORIA SPARTZ from 
the State of Indiana who is joining us 
this evening, sometimes the heavens 
produce someone in the Congress at a 
moment in history that becomes piv-
otal. 
As I introduce her, I thank her ex-
tremely for her excellent participation 
in the Ukrainian Caucus, her leader-
ship, and her ability to change her 
schedule at any point in order to be a 
strong voice for liberty. No one knows

better than she what it is like to live 
under a tyrannical, repressive regime. 
I yield to the gentlewoman from Indi-
ana (Mrs. SPARTZ). 
Mrs. SPARTZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Congresswoman KAPTUR and Congress-
man BRIAN FITZPATRICK for their bipar-
tisan leadership. 
I know that this Special Order is 
about the situation in Ukraine, but the 
situation 
in 
Ukraine 
goes 
beyond 
Ukraine. It is a threat to the stability 
of the world order, the largest threat 
since World War II, and a threat to any 
democracy. 
I would also like to remind us that 
millions of our predecessors died for 
freedom, 
peace, 
and 
democracy. 
I 
would like to read some excerpts from 
the recent joint statement of the Rus-
sian Federation and the Peoples Repub-
lic of China dated February 4, 2022. 
‘‘Today, the world is going through 
momentous changes, and humanity is 
entering a new era of . . . profound 
transformation. It sees . . . trans-
formation of the global governance ar-
chitecture and world order . . . a trend 
has emerged towards redistribution of 
power in the world. The sides note that 
Russia and China as world powers . . . 
have longstanding traditions of democ-
racy which rely on thousand-years of 
experience. They stand ready to work 
together with all the interested part-
ners to promote genuine democracy.’’ 
I know that President Putin is not 
going to listen to me, and I am not 
sure to anyone else, but I hope he still 
has to listen to the Russian people at 
least a little bit. I am not naive on his 
personal ambitions although I would 
still offer him an olive branch if he 
really cares about his people in his 
country. Therefore, I am going to di-
rect my message to over 3 million Rus-
sian Americans. I am talking to you as 
a 
Congresswoman 
representing 
the 
great State of Indiana, who grew up 
under Communists in the Ukrainian 
Soviet Socialist Republic. I was born in 
a country that doesn’t exist anymore, 
and for good reason, as many of you, 
too. 
I know that many of you have rel-
atives in Russia and dual citizenship. I 
know that Putin has powerful anti- 
American propaganda on his TV. I was 
somewhat surprised over its extant. 
It’s worse than during the Soviet 
Union times. 
b 1530 
I want you to let the Russian people 
know that neither the United States 
nor the West are a threat to Russia’s 
national security. 
I would argue that Russia has a much 
bigger threat coming from the east. 
There is a very aggressive economic ex-
pansion of China in the Far East and 
Siberia. 
I would also like to make it very 
clear that the American people do not 
want another war in Europe. 
I also want to remind you of the 
human cost of any war. If Russia starts 
a war in Ukraine, which looks more 
and more likely, a lot of young people 
will have to die from both sides. No one 
will benefit from it. Maybe the Chinese 
Communist Party, but not the Russian 
people. 
I just do not believe that the Russian 
people would want to go in history as a 
puppet to the imperialistic ambitions 
of China and would want to promote a 
so-called genuine democracy of the 
Chinese Communist Party. 
The ball is in your court, President 
Putin and Russian people. I hope you 
will be on the right side of history. 
I also would like to share a message 
with my fellow Americans: Do not get 
distracted, and do not get reluctant. A 
threat to our freedoms from outside 
and within is real. Protect and cherish 
our freedoms so our children do not 
have to fight to get them back. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Congresswoman SPARTZ very much for 
being here and for being such a strong 
voice for liberty, having known the 
other side of that. I thank her for her 
time today, for her heartfelt remarks. 
We continue to be benefited by her ex-
traordinary leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, our final speaker today 
is the very distinguished gentleman 
from the State of Maryland who knows 
a whole lot about the rule of law and 
human rights. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Maryland (Mr. MFUME), who we 
are fortunate has returned to Congress 
after serving in so many national posi-
tions. We are so grateful for his life and 
his presence here today. 
Mr. MFUME. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Ms. KAPTUR for her overly gracious re-
marks. I appreciate them. I also appre-
ciate the opportunity to join her and 
the others in our discussion about 
Ukraine. 
Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how 
much time is remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Ohio has 6 minutes re-
maining. 
Mr. MFUME. Mr. Speaker, I am real-
ly happy to join with Congresswoman 
KAPTUR, who has served for some time 
now as chair of the Ukrainian Caucus, 
who has driven us and gotten us to this 
point, but who has also kept together a 
bipartisan group of legislators. So, to 
her 
and 
to 
Ranking 
Member 
FITZPATRICK, my thanks to both of 
them. 
We are all here, obviously, because of 
the situation in Ukraine. This comes at 
us from different ways. I initially got 
involved when I came back to Congress 
because of a gentleman by the name of 
Roman Goy in my district who has 
watched these situations with Ukraine 
going back to 2014 and beyond and who 
felt sort of helpless. 
On behalf of Mr. Goy in Catonsville 
and all the other ones that I have 
heard from—and I am particularly 
heartened to also hear, as we did ear-
lier, 
from 
the 
gentlewoman, 
Mrs. 
SPARTZ, who is the only native Ukrain-
ian to serve here in the United States 
Congress. Her comments are compel-
ling, and her witness is one that we 
should always keep in front of us as 
something to be reminded of. 
Mr. Speaker, I go back a long, long 
way in terms of the aggression that we 
now see in Ukraine. I go so far back as 
to remember the Cold War days that a 
lot of us grew up under, the days of a 
very, very aggressive Soviet Union 
hellbent on domination, spanning 13 
time zones, with a growing nuclear ar-
senal in those days and with the twist-
ed belief that they somehow or another 
could, in fact, be a part of this hemi-
sphere and pose an issue to us. It was a 
different Soviet Union. It is Russia 
now, but that same sort of thinking 
pervades. 
Back then, I am talking about the 
missile crisis in Cuba, where Soviet 
President Khrushchev, Nikita Khru-
shchev, was putting missiles 90 miles 
off our coast, believing that he and the 
Soviet Union had a right to that sort of 
expansionism, that sort of aggression. 
Thank God that President John Fitz-
gerald Kennedy, having reached a very 
tight ultimatum with the reality, de-
cided that the United States would not 
accept that. 
We were on the brink of war then, 
but the Soviet Union blinked. They re-
moved their missiles from Cuba, and 
we have sort of coexisted in a sort of 
Cold War for some time now. 
Then, with the fall of Berlin and the 
ending of the Soviet Union as we knew 
it, and now the singular emergence of 
Russia, all of us concerned here are 
concerned about what is happening in 
Ukraine. 
When you look at the troop move-
ments that are taking place, when you 
look at the propaganda being spun by 
the Kremlin, it is all so familiar to 
what happened in 1914 when the Soviet 
Union went off in its own direction and 
when it began to build up its war ma-
chine. 
In 2014, the Russian Government, fol-
lowing the same script, has decided—or 
did decide then—to have similar troop 
movements, similar weapons buildup, 
and a similar effort to invade. Even 
though the talk then was ‘‘we are not 
invading,’’ we know what happened 
then. They invaded Ukraine. They took 
and annexed Crimea. 
People in Kiev and elsewhere have 
been watching the situation with great 
trepidation, and now we are at a point 
with a massive Russian buildup all 
along the Ukrainian border, well over 
100,000 troops, all sorts of armaments, 
and the ability to have airpower to 
strike and to take, if they want to, 
that country. 
So, the fact that President Biden and 
others have stood up—we want to also 
thank all of our European allies for 
banding together. The North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization was formed just to 
be able to prevent things such as this. 
Although Ukraine is not a signatory 
under Article 5, its sovereignty and its 
independence is so very, very impor-
tant. 
I want to join with Congresswoman 
KAPTUR,

H1111 
February 9, 2022 
FITZPATRICK, Mrs. SPARTZ with her tes-
timony, and all the others who have 
continued to raise this issue. 
In the old, old days, we never knew 
when the then-Soviet Union was going 
to strike. We don’t know now. I re-
member air drills at 1 o’clock in the 
afternoon. In schools, we were so close 
to the end of the last war, kids had to 
stop what they were doing and practice 
drills, hiding under their desks. In 
every school, there was a bomb shelter. 
We have come a long way since then, 
but that threat is still there. 
A lot of people say: Well, why is this 
important? It is important because his-
tory can repeat itself. It is important 
because 
history 
often 
does 
repeat 
itself. It is important because it is a 
lesson that we have learned and must 
never get away from. 
Terrorism anywhere is a threat to de-
mocracies everywhere. I join and am 
happy in this bipartisan effort, Mr. 
Speaker, to lend my voice. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Congressman MFUME for his sterling 
remarks. His presence here adds enor-
mous value to what we are attempting 
to do, to stop war, to promote diplo-
macy and peace, and to help protect a 
David against a Goliath. This is a very 
noble calling. 
As we close today, I want to say for 
the record, for teachers who may be lis-
tening, for scholars, for other Members 
of Congress, there is a book by Dr. 
Timothy Snyder of Yale University ti-
tled ‘‘Bloodlands.’’ If you want to un-
derstand the struggle for liberty, that 
is a book that is a must-read. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, who teaches us obedi-

and make us more than victorious be-
cause of Your great love, wisdom, and 
power. 
Today, keep our lawmakers true and 
sincere as they strive to please You in 
all they think, say, and do. 
Inspire them to claim Your great and 
precious promises. May they embrace 
Your promise in the 84th Psalm, verse

any good thing from those who walk 
with integrity. 
Continue to sustain our Senators

consideration of the following nomina-
tion, which the clerk will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read the nomination of Douglas R.

Secretary of the Army. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. I suggest the absence of 
a quorum. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BROWN). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The majority leader is recognized. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, before 
I get into my remarks, just some brief 
housekeeping. 
f 
MEASURES PLACED ON THE 
CALENDAR EN BLOC 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, as if 
in legislative session, I understand that 
there are three bills at the desk due for 
a second reading en bloc. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The lead-
er is correct. 
The clerk will read the bills by title 
for the second time. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (S. 3600) to improve the cybersecu-
rity of the Federal Government, and for 
other purposes. 
A bill (H.R. 3076) to provide stability to 
and enhance the services of the United 
States Postal Service, and for other pur-
poses. 
A bill (H.R. 6617) making further con-
tinuing appropriations for the fiscal year 
ending September 30, 2022, and for other pur-
poses. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, in 
order to place the bills on the calendar 
under the provisions of rule XIV, I 
would object to further proceedings en 
bloc. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion having been heard, the bills will be 
placed on the calendar. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, those 
are all bills that we hope to move for-
ward, and so that is why I have rule 
XIV’d them. 
f 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR—Continued 
POSTAL REFORM 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, yes-
terday, by a margin—a large margin— 
of 342 to 92, Congress took the first 
steps toward creating the most impor-
tant upgrade to our post office in dec-
ades by passing a bipartisan reform 
package that has been years in the 
making. 
With an overwhelmingly bipartisan 
vote in the House, it is my intention 
for the Senate to quickly take up and 
pass this bipartisan, bicameral Postal 
reform bill. We hope to take action 
here on the floor and pass the bill be-
fore we go to the Presidents Day re-
cess. 
The post office is, quite simply, one 
of the most important institutions of 
American life. Every day, tens of mil-
lions of Americans, veterans, small 
businesses, people living in rural com-
munities, seniors rely on the Postal 
Service for their medicines and pre-
scriptions, for getting essential goods, 
for voting, for correspondence, for their 
livelihoods, and to get close to one an-
other on special occasions like birth-
days and anniversaries and things like 
that. 
But, nevertheless, our Postal Service 
has needed reform for over a decade. Its 
budgets are severely strained, its deliv-
ery services are overwhelmed, and the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S582 
February 9, 2022 
disruptions unleashed by the internet 
have made it harder for it to meet its 
obligations to the American people and 
to its own employees. 
Every one of us has heard objections 
about letters arriving far too late. In 
many 
instances, 
whether 
they 
be 
checks that people depend on for their 
livelihoods or prescription drugs or 
whatever, these complaints are grow-
ing and growing and growing. 
The bipartisan Postal reform bill of-
fers a much needed reset. It will guar-
antee delivery services continue 6 days 
a week; it will put the post office on a 
path back towards solvency; and it will 
ensure that we take care of our dedi-
cated Postal workers while also saving 
the post office over $50 billion. 
Let me summarize again. If this leg-
islation is passed, it would ensure con-
tinued 6-day delivery service, make de-
liveries more efficient and timely, and 
will put the post office on a path to 
stability. 
I want to recognize my colleagues 
who have made it possible for this leg-
islation to move forward. First, I 
thank my friend and colleague Senator 
PETERS, chairman of the Homeland Se-
curity and Government Affairs Com-
mittee, for his leadership in bringing 
this bill together. 
I also want to thank Ranking Mem-
ber PORTMAN for working across the 
aisle on this commonsense reform bill. 
And I want to thank all my House 
colleagues who worked assiduously for 
a long, long time pushing for portal re-
form. Both the chair and the ranking 
member of the relevant committees 
supported the bill on the floor of the 
House yesterday. 
I have always said Democrats will 
work on a bipartisan basis whenever we 
can pass commonsense legislation that 
will improve the lives of the American 
people. 
Last year, bipartisan cooperation 
helped clear the way for such things as 
the historic Anti-Asian Hate Crimes 
bill, a much needed competition bill, 
and our bipartisan infrastructure pack-
age. 
This work period alone, we have al-
ready made great progress on bipar-
tisan priorities, like ending forced ar-
bitration for sexual harassment and as-
sault. As I have mentioned, we will 
soon act on the post office. 
And I expect both sides will support 
passage of the short-term CR that will 
keep the Federal Government open be-
fore next week’s deadline. 
I want to thank the appropriators 
from both sides of the aisle for working 
in good faith, and I am optimistic that 
soon they will arrive at an agreement 
for an omnibus package, which is far 
more preferable to the alternative of a 
yearlong CR. 
We are getting very, very close to 
coming to an agreement on top-line 
numbers, and as I said, I am more opti-
mistic than I have been in a very long 
time that we will get an omnibus bill 
done for government spending for the 
rest of the year. 
So all these priorities—forced arbi-
tration, Postal reform, and government 
funding—are bipartisan items that I 
expect the Senate will act on before 
the recess. 
As I have always said from my first 
day as majority leader, we will work in 
a bipartisan way whenever we can. We 
did it in our first year with things like 
the Anti-Asian hate crimes legislation, 
the competition bill, and the bipartisan 
infrastructure package. And these 2 
weeks now represent a productive con-
tinuation of that commitment. 
So on this issue, I am optimistic that 
very soon we will see the first major 
reform of America’s Postal system in 
decades. It will be a win for our dedi-
cated Postal workers and for the Amer-
ican people who rely on the post office 
every single day. 
FORCED ARBITRATION 
Mr. President, on forced arbitration, 
before the end of the week, it is my in-
tention to have the Senate take action 
on one of the most important work-
place reforms that we have seen in dec-
ades—eliminating 
forced 
arbitration 
for sexual harassment and assault. 
Yesterday, I sat down with my Re-
publican colleagues, Senators LINDSEY 
GRAHAM
and JONI
ERNST, and we 
worked out an agreement on a few out-
standing issues that will clear the path 
for the Senate, we believe, to hold a 
vote very soon on this issue. I want to 
thank them for their good faith and co-
operation. And I especially want to 
thank my friend and colleague from 
New York, Senator GILLIBRAND, for 
being the leader on this important 
issue for so, so long. 
For decades, it has been common 
practice for employers to tuck arbitra-
tion clauses into the fine print of em-
ployment 
contracts. 
Today, 
these 
clauses effectively function as pre-
conditions for getting hired to a new 
job. Most workers may not even realize 
what they have signed on to until it is 
too late, after the fact. 
Today, we can no longer ignore that 
forced 
arbitration 
has 
proven 
im-
mensely harmful when it comes to sex-
ual harassment and sexual assault. 
When 
workers—almost 
always 
women—face abuse or harassment at 
the hands of their employers, forced ar-
bitration immediately limits their op-
tions for remedy. The deck is stacked 
against them from the start, and thus 
abusers rarely face true accountability. 
That is awful and must change. 
And all of it is going to change very 
soon. By passing bipartisan legislation 
to end forced arbitration for sexual 
harassment and assault, we will ensure 
that those who face abuse will have the 
freedom to exercise their basic right to 
pursue action against harmful employ-
ers in court. This is long, long overdue, 
and I want to commend both sides for 
working together to getting us close to 
the finish line. I expect we will hold a 
vote on this to pass this legislation in 
the very near future, and the benefits 
of the legislation will be felt across the 
country and last for a very, very long 
time. 
Bottom line, ending forced arbitra-
tion for sexual harassment and assault 
is about making our workplaces safer, 
holding abusive employers account-
able, and making sure that every 
American can exercise their right to 
seek justice in a court of law. 
SENATE BUSINESS 
Mr. President, finally, on Senate 
business, concerning the activity on 
the floor today, the Senate is going to 
have another busy workday as we con-
tinue confirming Presidential nomina-
tions to the administration and onto 
the Federal bench. 
Today, three rollcall votes are sched-
uled on the nominations of both the 
head of the U.S. International Develop-
ment Finance Corp and the President’s 
pick for Assistant Secretary of the 
Army. 
But tonight we are very likely to add 
additional rollcall votes to complete 
the confirmation of several pending 
nominations. These votes will likely 
take us into the early evening, but 
they are necessary in order to confirm 
nominees. 
I will add that until this past year, 
these nominees almost always have 
been approved through unanimous con-
sent. Unfortunately, a few people on 
the other side are holding it up and 
making us vote on each of these, but 
vote we must. 
Once again, though, to move things 
along, I ask my colleagues to cast their 
votes quickly tonight, to remain in 
their seats or near the floor as much as 
possible, and to be flexible in order to 
help move things along as quickly as 
possible on the Senate floor, as we did 
last week. 
We did a good job voting efficiently 
last week despite the large number of 
votes. So I ask everyone to continue at 
that pace tonight as needed. 
STOCK TRADING 
Mr. President, finally, off the floor, I 
want to reiterate a brief point I made 
yesterday regarding stock trading and 
Members of Congress. I believe this is 
an 
important 
issue 
that 
Congress 
should address, and it is something 
that has clearly raised interest from 
both sides of the aisle over the past few 
weeks. 
As I said yesterday, there are a num-
ber of Senators with various proposals, 
and I have asked my Democratic col-
leagues to come together and come up 
with a single bill this Chamber can 
work on. I hope we can pass something. 
I want to encourage my colleagues on 
the Democratic side to reach out 
across the aisle. Some of the pro-
posals—we have a whole bunch—have 
bipartisan support. 
This is something the Senate should 
address. Hopefully, we can act on it 
soon, and hopefully it can be done in a 
bipartisan way, like many of the bills 
we are looking at this week. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S583 
February 9, 2022 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I ask unanimous 
consent that the order for the quorum 
call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Republican leader is recognized. 
CRIME 
Mr. MCCONNELL. While Washington 
Democrats spent 2021 distracted by 
their 
reckless 
taxing-and-spending 
spree, violent criminals were preying 
on the American people. Millions of 
Americans’ neighborhoods descended 
into chaos and violence around them. 
After the nationwide murder rate 
saw its biggest jump in more than 100 
years in 2020, at least 12 major cities 
set their own alltime homicide records 
in 2021. Rates of carjackings have dou-
bled, tripled, and even quadrupled in 
major metro areas. 
My hometown of Louisville set a new 
alltime murder record last year of 188 
homicides. Twenty-four of the victims 
were children. At one point last year, a 
staggering 65 percent of our homicides 
were going unsolved. Louisville is now 
averaging one carjacking every 42 
hours. Yesterday, I hosted the FBI spe-
cial agent in charge of the Louisville 
field office for a meeting here in the 
Capitol. We discussed these issues at 
length. 
One survey last year found that 
Americans believe violent crime is the 
No. 1 major crisis facing our country. 
More citizens called violent crime a 
major crisis than COVID. When Ameri-
cans 
were 
asked 
about 
President 
Biden’s handling of law enforcement 
and criminal justice, the President 
polls almost 20 points underwater. 
The 
American 
people 
know 
this 
crime wave is not some spontaneous 
event. It has been fed and fueled in 
multiple ways by the Democratic Par-
ty’s far-left turn. For example, liberal 
activists and many elected Democrats 
have spent almost 2 years trying to 
smear—smear—the entire profession of 
policing with the actions of a few bad 
actors. 
We know that anti-police culture 
wars invite more crime. It is a fact. A 
prominent scholar—who, incidentally, 
was the youngest African-American 
professor to ever get tenure at Har-
vard—has proven that anti-police out-
cry directly results in more crime, in-
cluding homicides. 
Many jurisdictions have entertained 
financial attacks on police depart-
ments to match the rhetorical attacks. 
Literally just yesterday, a prominent 
House Democrat insisted to the press 
that the far left will not be dropping or 
diluting their message of ‘‘defund the 
police.’’ 
Meanwhile, 
our 
brave 
men 
and 
women in law enforcement are lit-
erally—literally—under attack. While 
too many politicians take aim at our 
brave police officers in a political 
sense, violent criminals are taking aim 
at them in a literal sense. The number 
of cop killings shot up nearly 60 per-
cent last year to a two-decade high. 
In Louisville, Jefferson County Sher-
iff’s Deputy Brandon Shirley was shot 
and killed last summer. It is believed 
he was ambushed while wearing his 
uniform. 
The streets of New York City were 
packed full with heroes a few days ago 
as fellow officers mourned two of their 
colleagues who had been shot and 
killed. 
It is not just regular citizens going 
about their normal days who need this 
violent crime epidemic to stop; our 
brave men and women in blue also need 
very badly for it to stop. But, within 
the justice system, leftwing activists 
have insinuated themselves into pros-
ecutorial roles throughout America 
and are making ‘‘soft on crime’’ actu-
ally their official policy. 
The State’s attorney in Baltimore 
announced last year she intended to 
stop prosecuting minor drug and pros-
titution cases. 
New York City’s new district attor-
ney said last month he would not pur-
sue 
charges 
for 
marijuana 
mis-
demeanors, trespassing, and resisting 
arrest, among others. After a huge 
backlash, he tried to walk some of this 
back. 
Chain stores like Walgreens have had 
to close locations in San Francisco be-
cause constant, unpunished theft and 
shoplifting have become a fact of life in 
that city. 
Another example is almost too sad 
and ironic for words. In Wisconsin last 
November, a repeat offender who was 
out on bond drove his car into a Christ-
mas parade and murdered six people. 
His victims included an 8-year-old 
child and a group of grandmothers. 
Well, one jurisdiction over in Mil-
waukee County has one of the most 
prominent soft-on-crime liberal pros-
ecutors in the entire country. He has 
spent years waging a national cam-
paign urging prosecutors to actually go 
easy on repeat criminals like this kill-
er. A few years back, he even admitted 
soft-on-crime policies would cost inno-
cent lives but said he was willing to 
make the trade. 
Here is what he had to say: 
Is there going to be an individual I divert, 
or I put into [a] treatment program, who’s 
going to go out and kill somebody? You bet. 
Guaranteed. It’s guaranteed to happen. It 
does not invalidate the overall approach. 
These backward, pro-crime attitudes 
aren’t just infecting local DAs’ offices; 
they also seem to be largely defining 
the 
Biden 
Department 
of 
Justice. 
Rachael Rollins is the former Massa-
chusetts DA who spent her last job try-
ing to wipe entire categories of crimes 
off the enforcement rolls. This earned 
her a promotion to U.S. attorney from 
President Biden, which every Senate 
Democrat supported. There is Vanita 
Gupta, now an Associate Attorney Gen-
eral, who had previously advocated for 
sweeping drug decriminalization and 
expressed her support for efforts to 
‘‘decrease police budgets.’’ There is 
Kristen Clarke, also confirmed by Sen-
ate Democrats to work at DOJ, who 
echoed calls to ‘‘invest less in police.’’ 
These are President Biden’s picks to 
top jobs at Main Justice. 
I just had to place a hold on the 
nominee to be U.S. attorney for Min-
nesota because the person recently act-
ing in that job recommended an unusu-
ally soft sentence below the minimum 
guideline to a convicted fatal arsonist 
because the arsonist was taking part in 
a far-left political riot at the time. I 
will need written assurance the nomi-
nee to succeed this person will not con-
tinue this jaw-dropping practice and 
lessen criminals’ sentences so long as 
the political violence they commit 
happens to be leftwing. 
The modern Democratic Party has 
convinced itself that order—order—is 
actually oppression and anarchy is ac-
tually compassion. This is totally 
wrong. Tolerating lawlessness and an-
archy is not compassionate. It doesn’t 
help vulnerable communities for politi-
cians to passively watch them devolve 
into literal war zones. The actual resi-
dents of these communities know this 
best of all. 
Last summer, even after months of 
anti-police rhetoric from the left, when 
a poll asked the residents of Detroit 
about their concerns, almost five times 
more people said public safety than po-
lice reform. It was even more lopsided 
among 
African-American 
residents. 
They named public safety eight times 
more than police reform. 
Last summer, NPR interviewed a 
man 
who 
had 
committed 
terrible 
crimes as a young adult, served time, 
turned his life around, and now works 
with young men in prison. The reporter 
asked how he had gotten caught up in 
criminal violence. Where did his child-
hood veer off course? 
Here was the man’s explanation—a 
direct quote. Here is what he said: 
It was my environment. . . . When I go 
outside every day, as soon as I walk out my 
front door, I’m entering a war zone . . . from 
sun-up to sundown, robberies and murders 
and carjacking and extortion . . . [I] became 
a product of my environment. 
So this man’s problem was not an 
evil justice system that was out to get 
him; it wasn’t that his neighborhood 
had an excess of law and order; the 
problem was a lack of—a lack of—law 
and order. 
It is not compassionate to let vulner-
able kids grow up in war zones because 
Democrats feel bad putting violent 
criminals in prison, where they belong. 
Let me say that again. It is not com-
passionate to let vulnerable kids grow 
up in war zones because Democrats feel 
guilty putting violent criminals behind 
bars, where they belong. 
Neither is it compassionate to make 
innocent, law-abiding citizens across 
America live in fear because liberal 
public servants won’t do their jobs. 
The answer to this crimewave isn’t 
slashing law enforcement budgets, it 
isn’t replacing cops with social work-
ers, and it isn’t far-left gun grabbers 
coming after the constitutional rights 
of law-abiding citizens. Here is the an-
swer: Elected officials need to drop the

RECOGNIZING THE COFFEYVILLE COMMUNITY 
COLLEGE RED RAVENS MEN’S BASKETBALL TEAM 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I rise 
this morning to recognize and con-
gratulate the Coffeyville Community 
College Red Ravens men’s basketball 
team on winning the 2021 National Jun-
ior College Athletic Association Divi-
sion 1 men’s basketball championship. 
Kansas has an unparalleled history of 
college athletes, and I am proud to rec-
ognize the Coffeyville Red Ravens’ con-
tribution to our State’s many accom-
plishments. 
On April 24, 2021, the Coffeyville Red 
Ravens brought home their first na-
tional championship trophy in nearly 
six decades. As an underdog in the na-
tional tournament with a No. 10 rank-
ing, this accomplishment is a result of 
hard work, determination, and grit. 
During the championship game, fresh-
man center Blaise Keita had a career 
high of 27 points, and Tylor Perry 
scored 18 points. Additionally, Blaise, 
Tylor, and Love Bettis were named to 
the All-Tournament team. 
The honorable achievements of these 
players have earned rightful recogni-
tion for their commitment to excel-
lence in college athletics. Athletics 
teach young men and women many val-
uable skills that serve them through-
out their lives. 
These lessons and this team’s accom-
plishment were not possible without 
the leadership of Head Coach Jay 
Herkelman, who has been an instru-
mental member of the Red Ravens 
men’s basketball program for nearly 
three decades. As a coach who has 
shown dedication to his players and his 
team, he has earned the title of the 
Kansas Basketball Coaches Associa-
tion’s ‘‘Coach of the Year’’ five times. 
Furthermore, congratulations to Coach 
Herkelman, who is only 1 win away 
from reaching the remarkable mile-
stone of 700 wins with the Red Ravens. 
I am pleased to have introduced a 
resolution 
with 
Congressman 
LATURNER and Senator MARSHALL on 
behalf of these dedicated student ath-
letes, coaches, team, and school, and to 
have had it unanimously pass the U.S. 
Senate last week. 
Thank you to the players, the coach-
es, and the staff of the Coffeyville Com-
munity College Red Ravens men’s bas-
ketball team for bringing this win 
home. 
Congratulations to all in Southeast 
Kansas, South Central Kansas, those 
who are students, those who are fac-
ulty, and those who lead this college. 
We are proud of their success. 
The Coffeyville community has much 
to take pride in this strong program, 
and I look forward to their continued 
success. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HEINRICH). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
SUPPLY CHAIN 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, one of 
the big drivers of our inflation crisis 
was Democrats’ decision to flood the 
economy with unnecessary government 
money last March with their $1.9 tril-
lion spending bill. 
Another contributor to the problem 
has been supply chain bottlenecks. 
Americans are getting pretty used to 
long delays in receiving the goods they 
have ordered, to big holes on grocery 
store shelves, and to being unable to 
rely on a store to keep a product in 
stock consistently. 
Since the start of the pandemic, 
keeping goods in stock has been a chal-
lenge, but, as with the larger inflation 
crisis, the White House has seemed 
largely uninterested in addressing the 
problem. ‘‘The tragedy of the treadmill 
that’s delayed’’—that was a quote of 
the White House Press Secretary, jok-
ing in October, a typically tone-deaf 
comment from an administration often 
oblivious to the difficulties facing ordi-
nary Americans. 
In fact, supply chain issues are not a 
minor inconvenience; they are a real 
problem. It is not easy for an already 
overstretched mom or dad to have to 
run around town trying to find essen-
tial items—items they could previously 
rely on one store, at least, to have in 
stock. Businesses are struggling to 
maintain their profit margins and meet 
the demands of their customers, par-
ticularly small businesses, which have 
fewer resources to work around supply 
chain problems. Of course, supply chain 
problems are helping to fuel the price 
hikes Americans have been facing on 
everything from food and clothing to 
furniture, to used cars and trucks. 
These are facts that seem lost on the 
administration, which has largely ig-
nored supply chain issues and the infla-
tion crisis in favor of focusing on pet 
projects: a massive tax-and-spending 
spree and election legislation that it 
thinks will boost Democrat chances in 
the fall. 
On top of this, the administration 
has taken more than one action that is 
making or seems likely to make our 
supply chain problems even worse. 
Earlier this week, for example, the 
Federal Motor Carrier Safety Adminis-
tration implemented its entry-level 
driver training rule, which substan-
tially expands training requirements 
for drivers seeking to obtain a com-
mercial driver’s license. The new rule 
is likely to make it significantly more 
challenging for trucking companies to 
train new drivers, particularly for 
smaller trucking companies, which 
may struggle to afford the enhanced 
training costs. 
The trucking industry has been hit 
hard by the supply chain crisis, with 
drivers working longer hours with 
fewer resources to keep goods moving 
across the country. They have been he-
roes. This makes it a very bad time to 
impose new burdens on truckers and 
tie up trucking companies with addi-
tional redtape. 
The administration should have de-
layed the implementation of this rule 
until the worst of the supply chain cri-
sis eases. Unfortunately, the adminis-
tration decided to push ahead anyway, 
and now truckdrivers and trucking 
companies will face additional chal-
lenges, which will likely exacerbate 
supply chain problems. 
The Canada-U.S. cross-border truck-
driver vaccine mandate is another ad-
ministration action that has created 
new pressures on a trucking industry 
already stretched thin thanks to the 
supply chain crisis. I am a strong sup-
porter of vaccines, but mandating vac-
cines for cross-border truckdrivers has 
only served to worsen supply chain bot-
tlenecks. You just need to look at the 
current situation in Canada to see the 
evidence of that. Truckdrivers do not 
pose a high risk of COVID transmission 
since they spend most of their workday 
alone. This mandate’s main legacy 
looks likely to be increasing the supply 
chain problems we are facing. 
Then, of course, there is the adminis-
tration’s hostile attitude toward con-
ventional energy production. The ad-
ministration might not like it, but the 
fact of the matter is that our economy 
will continue to rely on conventional 
energy like gasoline for a while yet. 
Discouraging conventional energy pro-
duction, as the administration has 
done, is doing nothing but worsening 
our inflation and supply chain crisis 
and driving up energy bills for Amer-
ican families. 
Energy prices have a substantial ef-
fect on prices in the store and on the 
availability of goods. The higher en-
ergy prices are, the more expensive it 
will be to produce and transport goods. 
The more it costs to produce and trans-
port goods, the higher the final price of 
the goods is likely to be. 
The administration’s hostility to tra-
ditional energy production has helped 
drive energy prices up, which is aggra-
vating, making worse, our supply chain 
and inflation crises. 
Instead of imposing unhelpful new 
regulations, it would be nice to see the 
administration turn its focus to mean-
ingful measures to address the supply 
chain crisis, like those in the bipar-
tisan legislation I introduced last week 
with Senator AMY KLOBUCHAR. 
For some time now, I have heard re-
ports of ocean carriers refusing to

transport certain goods—often Amer-
ican agricultural products, which im-
pacts my State of South Dakota—in 
favor of more lucrative cargoes. Our 
legislation is designed to address this 
problem and create a more level play-
ing field for American producers. 
Our bill gives the Federal Maritime 
Commission greater authority to re-
spond to discriminatory ocean carrier 
practices, and it provides the FMC with 
tools to more quickly resolve detention 
and demurrage disputes. 
This legislation will bring greater ef-
ficiency and transparency to a process 
that leaves many shippers frustrated— 
especially small businesses—and bring 
long-term, positive changes to the mar-
itime supply chain, which I hope will 
benefit exporters, importers, and con-
sumers alike. 
These are the kinds of measures the 
White House should be focusing on, 
measures that open up the supply 
chain instead of weighing it down with 
government mandates and regulations. 
Given the administration’s general 
lack of concern with the supply chain 
and inflation crises facing the Amer-
ican people, I don’t have a lot of hope 
that the White House is going to do 
much to address either of these prob-
lems, but I will continue to work with 
my colleagues in Congress from both 
parties wherever possible to advance 
measures that will ease our supply 
chain problems and help to get back to 
a situation where goods move smoothly 
around our country and around the 
world. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The

The legislative clerk proceeded to

Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I ask

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF RETA JO LEWIS 
Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise 
today to discuss the nomination of 
Reta Jo Lewis to serve as the President 
and Chair of the Ex-Im Bank of the 
United States. It is my understanding 
that we are likely to have a vote later 
today on her confirmation, and I want 
to address this. 
And let me start by underscoring 
why, frankly, I don’t think we should 
have an Ex-Im Bank, and let me ex-
plain why. First of all, let’s start with 
the Ex-Im’s claim about how it does 
business. The Ex-Im Bank maintains 
that, when it provides financing for 
these transactions that it engages in, 
it only takes risks that private lenders 
are either unable or unwilling to take. 
Now, we ought to stop ourselves right 
there and say: Well, wait a minute. If 
the private sector is not willing to take 
these risks, why should we force tax-
payers to take these risks—because the 
Ex-Im Bank is, of course, backed by 
American taxpayers. So that is ques-
tion No. 1. 
But it actually gets worse than that. 
The Ex-Im Bank also insists that it 
only makes safe bets; it only engages 
in very low-risk, safe transactions. 
But, of course, it is impossible to do 
both, right? Ex-Im can’t only take 
transactions so risky that no one else 
will do them but at the same time only 
do safe transactions. That is an obvi-
ous contradiction, and that is a con-
tradiction that is at the heart of Ex- 
Im’s business model. 
So how do they do business? The rea-
son they do business is they systemati-
cally underprice the risk. That is why 
Ex-Im gets the transaction instead of 
the private sector. That is why bor-
rowers go to Ex-Im instead of any num-
ber of private financial institutions 
that are happy to offer the deal but 
only under terms that generate an ade-
quate return on the risk. 
This is why, for instance, the largest, 
most successful, most profitable banks 
in America go to Ex-Im for loan guar-
antees—because Ex-Im’s terms are too 
good to be true, at least too good to be 
true in the private sector. 
Let me just give a very recent exam-
ple of just how egregious this is. In 
2021, the Ex-Im Bank financed a deal in 
which they guaranteed an $82 million 
loan made by JPMorgan, the bank, to 
Qantas, the Australian airline, for the 
purpose of buying jet engines from 
General Electric. Now, let’s think 
about this. We have JPMorgan, the 
largest bank in America—extremely 
profitable, enormously successful, all 
the capital in the world. We have 
Qantas, which is one of the most suc-
cessful and profitable airlines in the 
world. They are the largest airline in 
Australia. And, of course, General 
Electric is one of the largest industrial 
companies in the world. 
Can 
anybody 
actually, 
with 
a 
straight face, suggest that any of these 
companies can’t borrow money pri-
vately? Seriously? All three of them 
access the capital markets every day. 
They have access to all the financing 
in the world. Yet taxpayers guaranteed 
this transaction because it was avail-
able. They don’t need any subsidy from 
American taxpayers, none whatsoever. 
Yet this is what Ex-Im does. 
Now, one of the claims that we hear 
from Ex-Im and from some supporters 
of Ex-Im is that Ex-Im plays an essen-
tial 
role; 
without 
them, 
we 
just 
wouldn’t have the exports that we 
have; we depend on Ex-Im to export 
products. 
Well, the problem with that argu-
ment is the vast, overwhelming major-
ity of American exports are done with-
out Ex-Im. Now, we went back and 
looked at the annual export data from 
2007 through 2020. In that period of 
time, the highest percentage of U.S. ex-
ports that were financed with Ex-Im fi-
nancing happened to be in 2012. Do you 
know what that percentage was? It was 
2.3 percent. That is the value of the ex-
ports that were financed by Ex-Im 
Bank. 
And that was, by the way, when Ex- 
Im had everything going for it. It was 
fully operational. It had a quorum on 
the Board. It had not reached its lend-
ing limit. So it was doing business 
without constraints. Yet it does this 
little, tiny sliver of American exports. 
The fact is, we are the second biggest 
exporting economy in the world behind 
China. The United States is No. 2 in 
total exports of goods. We are No. 1 in 
the world in terms of value added, and 
we do it almost entirely without Ex-Im 
financing—at least 97.7 percent in Ex- 
Im’s best year. So the argument that 
somehow American exporters need Ex- 
Im to survive is patently false. 
It gets worse, though. Now Ex-Im 
wants to expand into domestic financ-
ing. Ex-Im has been tasked by the 
Biden administration with developing a 
new domestic financing program to ex-
pand the reach of the Bank. The pro-
posed 
domestic 
financing 
program 
would support creating or expanding 
domestic manufacturing businesses and 
infrastructure projects as long as there 
is the expectation that some arbitrary 
portion of the goods will ultimately be 
exported. 
Can you imagine? So now the Ex-Im 
Bank is going to provide domestic fi-
nancing. Gee, if only we had banks in 
America. If only we had capital mar-
kets in America so that we could pro-
vide financing for these transactions. 
No, we need the Ex-Im Bank to do it. 
We need taxpayers to go into the do-
mestic banking business, on top of ev-
erything else. 
It is unbelievable. This isn’t just mis-
sion creep. This is like mission sprint. 
Of course, it completely subverts the 
congressional intent. The intent was to 
match financing that is provided for 
exports around the world. This has 
nothing to do with that. There is no 
reason in the world that Ex-Im should 
be providing domestic financing—none. 
We live in the most developed capital 
markets of the world. We have a huge, 
enormously successful banking system. 
There is absolutely no need for this. 
And the only way they will get busi-
ness is to, once again, underprice the 
risk so that taxpayers do not get prop-
erly compensated for the risks that 
they take. 
Now, let me get to the specifics of 
our nominee. I am concerned that Ms. 
Lewis is not going to protect the U.S. 
taxpayers from this inherently risky 
construct. For one example, the Biden 
administration has suggested doubling 
Ex-Im’s statutory default cap from 2 
percent to 4 percent. So what does this 
mean? So under current statute, Ex-Im 
has got a limit of how much of its bal-
ance sheet can be in default. It is 2 per-
cent. 
Well, lately, the default rate has been 
creeping up. In fact, it has tripled, and 
it is very close to 2 percent. So the ob-
vious solution is to do something about 
the credit quality of the balance sheet, 
but that is not the Biden administra-
tion’s solution. They just want to dou-
ble the permissible amount of losses. 
Well, I have no reason to believe that 
Ms. Lewis would object to that at all.

In fact, I suspect she would embrace 
that. 
I am also concerned about the back-
ground she brings to this job. Ms. 
Lewis does have some experience in 
international policy, but she does not 
have the financial background that 
should be a prerequisite for serving as 
the President of a big bank. And with-
out such a background, she is going to 
inevitably rely heavily on Ex-Im’s 
staff. As I said, I am very concerned 
that she is going to support this do-
mestic financing program of the ad-
ministration. 
So for these reasons and others, I am 
urging my colleagues to vote against 
the confirmation of Ms. Lewis as Presi-
dent of the Ex-Im Bank. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arkansas. 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that Senator MUR-
RAY and I be allowed to complete our 
remarks before the scheduled rollcall 
votes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 3604 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, for the 
past 2 years, our Nation’s kids have 
suffered. They have suffered socially, 
academically, and psychologically at 
the hands of Democratic politicians, 
the Biden administration, and their po-
litical bosses in the teachers unions. 
Although kids are at the lowest risk 
of hospitalization and death from the 
Wuhan coronavirus, they have endured 
and they continue to endure some of 
the most excessive, extreme, and suffo-
cating COVID restrictions of any popu-
lation in our country. This treatment 
has been nothing short of cruel. The 
politicians and the neurotic public 
health obsessives who enforce these 
policies should all hang their heads in 
shame. 
There are few things in a kid’s life, 
outside of family and church, that are 
more important to them than their 
school. For them, open and happy 
schools are precious. But for teachers 
union bosses like Randi Weingarten, 
they are just useful hostages. 
For the better part of a year, teach-
ers unions shut down our schools while 
they shook down politicians for more 
funding and benefits that they prom-
ised would allow them to reopen safely. 
Yet they kept schools closed. They 
kept kids masked. 
Desperate parents watched their so-
cially isolated kids fall behind while 
they engaged in Zoom schools, but the 
unions still dragged their feet. 
When schools finally reopened, our 
kids faced insane coronavirus proto-
cols. They weren’t allowed to sit with 
friends at lunch. They weren’t allowed 
to play at recess. They had to eat out-
side on freezing-cold days. And every 
moment of every day at every school, 
they were forced to wear a mask. 
Confused and hyper kids naturally 
often rebelled, and they have been rep-
rimanded and they have been punished 
for simply trying to play, trying to 
make friends, trying to breathe a little 
easier. 
Some parents may think that masks 
work for their kids, and that is fine. If 
they want to, they can put their kids 
in a mask. They should be able to 
choose. But under Democratic-forced 
masking policies, parents have no 
choice at all. Tragically, but predict-
ably—not just predictably—predicted— 
these absurd policies have had severe 
psychological effects on our kids. Sui-
cide and mental health problems have 
skyrocketed in the past 2 years. Grades 
have plummeted, while depression has 
surged. And as is so often the case, 
those with the least have suffered the 
most. 
But when parents dared to complain 
on behalf of their kids, they were con-
demned by teachers union bosses and 
by Democratic politicians as anti- 
science and extremists. They were in-
vestigated 
when 
Attorney 
General 
Merrick Garland sicced the Feds on 
parents who were simply going to 
school boards to protest these stupid 
policies. The Secretary of Education 
threatened to withdraw Federal fund-
ing from States and schools who did 
not have mask mandates. 
Thankfully, the tide has begun to 
turn. Sometimes I hear the phrase ‘‘the 
science changed.’’ The science hasn’t 
changed. What has changed is that 
there is an election coming and Demo-
crats have seen the polling on this 
question. Now they are running scared, 
and they want to pretend that they 
didn’t force your kid to wear a mask 
for 2 years. 
You see it in States that are run en-
tirely by Democrats: California, New 
Jersey, New York, the President’s own 
Delaware. Just yesterday, across the 
river in Virginia, the State senate, to 
include many Democrats, voted not 
just to allow parents a choice but to 
prohibit 
mask 
mandates 
by 
local 
schools. 
Yet, in many places, forced masking 
remains. Kids as young as 2, 3, 4 are 
still being forced to wear hot, restric-
tive, and ineffective masks for hours on 
end. Yes, ineffective because almost all 
those kids are wearing cloth masks, 
which don’t even work. And that is not 
me speaking; that is the CDC speaking. 
These masks don’t even work. Yet the 
kids are forced to wear them all day 
long. 
I can tell you that most Democratic 
politicians don’t think they work ei-
ther. How do we know that? Look at 
the candidate for Governor in Georgia, 
Stacey Abrams—or maybe I should say 
the Governor of Georgia, since she still 
refuses to concede the 2018 election and 
many of my Democratic colleagues 
have endorsed her view that she is 
somehow the shadow Governor of Geor-
gia. Just last week, photos emerged of 
her sitting in classrooms with masked 
kids grinning ear to ear, the only per-
son not wearing a mask in the class-
room. 
Also, Gavin Newsom, the Governor of 
California, was yucking it up at SoFi 
Stadium when the Rams played the 
49ers, 
taking 
pictures—without 
a 
mask—with 
Magic 
Johnson 
and 
a 
bunch of other celebrities, while he en-
forced one of the most onerous mask 
mandates in the country. 
What about Eric Garcetti, whose 
nomination to be the Ambassador to 
India is in front of the Senate right 
now, who said that pictures of him 
without a mask on are fine because he 
was holding his breath—I guess like 
Bill Clinton, who didn’t inhale. 
Barack 
Obama, 
pictures 
recently 
emerged of him standing outside—out-
side—on the beach, without a mask, 
while all the peons who are building his 
multimillion-dollar beach compound 
were forced to wear a mask in front of 
him. 
And I will let you in on something. 
The same goes for Democratic Sen-
ators. I was in a hearing this week. It 
was in a small, closed room. Not a sin-
gle Democratic Senator wore a mask in 
that hearing in that room. The catch 
is, the TV cameras weren’t on, so there 
wouldn’t be video of them sitting in 
that closed room without a mask on. 
But masks in school have become 
symbols of control and fear. They are 
not instruments of public health. It is 
past time for the mask mandates to 
end and for parents across this country 
to have a choice. That is why I am ask-
ing the Senate to pass my legislation 
today to require schools that receive 
Federal funding to give parents a sim-
ple choice on whether their kids should 
wear a mask. 
If my Democratic colleagues will join 
me, we can get this done now, today. 
That is why I urge them to support this 
bill. And I ask, as if in legislative ses-
sion, unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of S. 3604, which is at the desk; 
further, I ask unanimous consent that 
the bill be considered read a third time 
and passed and that the motion to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, re-
serving the right to object, I have said 
before that we all want to make sure 
our schools can stay safely open for in- 
person learning. But based on this leg-
islation, it is not clear that is true for 
all of my Republican colleagues. 
Look, this is straightforward. If you 
want education decisions to happen at 
the local level, you do not tie the 
hands of State and local officials when 
they are trying to keep their students 
and educators safe. And if you want 
schools to be able to stay safely open 
and bring some stability and certainty 
back to our classrooms, you don’t cut 
schools off from the resources they 
need just because you think you know 
better than the parents and local offi-
cials about how this pandemic is pro-
gressing in their community or how 
they should use tools like masks.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S587 
February 9, 2022 
I am a former preschool teacher, par-
ent advocate, and school board mem-
ber. But let’s be honest, you don’t need 
classroom experience to see that right 
now the very last thing we should be 
doing is denying schools the tools and 
resources to help kids learn safely. The 
data is clear. We have real work to do 
to help our students make up for an in-
credibly tough 2 years. 
Now, Democrats actually passed leg-
islation—the American Rescue Plan— 
which invests specifically in helping 
our students recover academically and 
mentally. The proposal from the Sen-
ator from Arkansas would put our stu-
dents’ recovery and safe in-person 
learning in jeopardy. It would take 
those important public health deci-
sions, which should be based on local 
conditions, away from those commu-
nities and slash funding for students 
and schools right when they need us 
the most. 
Now is not the time to pull the rug 
out from under students in schools. 
Parents, educators, and, most of all, 
kids have been through enough. I ob-
ject. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Arkansas. 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I would 
simply reply to the remarks of the Sen-
ator from Washington, she asserted 
that I or others who oppose these mask 
mandates think that we know better. 
That is the whole point, though. It is 
not that we think we know better; I 
think that you, as a parent, know bet-
ter. You know what is best for your 
child—not some Democratic politician, 
not some liberal superintendent, not 
some neurotic public health obsessive. 
And, apparently, the Democrats have 
no problem using these Federal funds 
when it suits their neurotic policies. 
After all, the Department of Education 
last year threatened Federal funding 
for States and schools that did not per-
mit mask mandates. The whole point 
of this exercise is this: the Democrats 
who think they know better than par-
ents to make the choices for the par-
ents’ kids. 
I am disappointed today that my 
Democratic colleagues want to con-
tinue to see kids forced to wear masks 
in schools across America, but, trust 
me, change is coming one way or an-
other. It will be because Democratic 
politicians, like Gavin Newsom, run for 
the hills or because the American peo-
ple repudiate them all in November. 
I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S588 
February 9, 2022 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
U.S. SUPREME COURT 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I 
am here again today to discuss the 
scheme by big Republican donor inter-
ests to capture and control our Su-
preme Court. Today, I am going to put 
a little spotlight on ongoing scheme 
operations. 
As we all know, Justice Stephen 
Breyer will retire at the end of this Su-
preme Court term. As the Biden admin-
istration selects a nominee, the scheme 
is shifting gears to attack her even be-
fore she has been named. 
A dark money front group called the 
Judicial Crisis Network has already an-
nounced a multimillion-dollar ad blitz 
against Justice Breyer’s unnamed re-
placement, and its first ad is already 
up. The ad’s premise is that leftwing 
dark money is poised to capture our 
Supreme Court. I am not making that 
up. Think of a squid. When a squid 
senses danger, it squirts a jet of ink 
into the water. The squid ink creates 
confusion and distracts predators, and 
the squid sneaks off. This new ad from 
the Judicial Crisis Network is squid 
ink. 
Let’s start with just a quick review 
of the facts. Rightwing donor interests 
captured our Supreme Court under 
Donald Trump. They did it with dark 
money. They used the front group Ju-
dicial Crisis Network to launder off 
identities of big rightwing contribu-
tors. The deidentified contributions 
funded political campaign ads against 
Merrick Garland and for Gorsuch, 
Kavanaugh, and Barrett. Those are the 
facts. The road onto the Supreme 
Court for those three Justices was 
paved with dark money. 
By the way, the checks were big. 
Four of the checks to Judicial Crisis 
Network were for $15 million or more. 
That is a big check. Because we don’t 
know who those donors are or who that 
donor is—it could all be one donor—we 
don’t know what business they had be-
fore the Court or why it was so worth 
it to them or him to spend $60 million 
to influence the makeup of the Court. 
This new Judicial Crisis Network 
ad—the squid ink ad—is designed to 
confuse those rather conspicuous facts. 
They can hide who funded them, but 
they can’t hide what they did; so, squid 
ink—distraction, misdirection. Their 
accusations of dark money corruption 
are a projection of the very scheme 
they themselves hatched and executed. 
As I have discussed previously in these 
speeches, this is a classic propaganda 
technique: You accuse your adversary 
of what you yourself have been doing. 
Yes, it is maddening to have a phony 
front group use dark money to capture 
and corrupt our Supreme Court and 
turn it into the Court that dark money 
built. It is devilish, Vladimir Putin- 
style propaganda for that phony front 
group to then accuse others of exactly 
what it did—a false mirror of its own 
behavior. 
By the way, that Judicial Crisis Net-
work ad accusing a not-yet-chosen Su-
preme Court nominee of being a dark 
money stooge? Paid for with dark 
money. You can’t make this stuff up. 
Let’s look at the Judicial Crisis Net-
work. Start with the fact that ‘‘Judi-
cial Crisis Network’’ does not exist. It 
is, legally speaking, a fiction. Who 
knew, right—an entity selling fiction 
that is itself a fiction. ‘‘Judicial Crisis 
Network’’ is actually a ‘‘fictitious 
name’’—that is a term under Virginia 
incorporation law—a fictitious name, 
one of several filed by an organization, 
a completely different organization, 
called the Concord Fund. 
It gets even more tangled, as dark 
money schemes tend to be—they are a 
lot like a covert operation—so let’s 
keep digging. 
The Judicial Crisis Network actually 
used to exist. It was once the 501(c)(4) 
twin of a 501(c)(3) called the Judicial 
Education Project. That is the state of 
the art these days for dark money po-
litical mischief, a twinned 501(c)(3) and 
501(c)(4). Tax records list the same ad-
dress for both entities—conveniently 
an address which happens to be just 
right down the hall, on the same floor, 
in the same building, as the Federalist 
Society. 
This twinned organization trick al-
lows donors to shift money in and out 
of different shady operations with zero 
disclosure, and it even gives donors a 
tax deduction to the 501(c)(3). You 
could pierce that corporate veil pretty 
easily. 
All this schemery hides the donors 
behind the operation. It fools members 
of the press who don’t bother to figure 
it out, and it helps dark money 
operatives like Leonard Leo, the cen-
tral organizer of the scheme—the oper-
ative for the big dark money donors— 
to hide their hands and shuffle money 
secretly around. 
Leonard Leo, you will recall, ran the 
donor turnstile at the Federalist Soci-
ety that picked Justices Gorsuch, 
Kavanaugh, and Barrett. Then, at the 
tail end of the Trump administration, 
with no more Supreme Court appoint-
ments likely, Leo scuttled off to a new 
venture: CRC Advisors. 
CRC Advisors was designed, as Axios 
reported, to ‘‘funnel big money and ex-
pertise across the conservative move-
ment.’’ 
As an aside, CRC Advisors has an af-
filiate called CRC Strategies, which, 
among other things, brought us the in-
famous swift boat campaign against 
John Kerry—classy bunch. 
Along with the inception of CRC Ad-
visors, Judicial Crisis Network was 
quietly renamed the ‘‘Concord Fund,’’ 
and the Judicial Education Project was 
quietly renamed the ‘‘85 Fund.’’ 
These 
became 
twin 
501(c)(4) 
and 
501(c)(3) political mischief operations. 
Concord, as a 501(c)(4), would handle at-
tack ads and PR. The 85 Fund, the 
501(c)(3), would help mask Concord’s 
operations and donors and provide tax 
deductibility. 
So that was the original setup, the 
renaming. Then these newly named 
groups loaded up with all these ficti-
tious names. They filed under Virginia 
law for permission to operate under fic-
titious names, and these are the ficti-
tious names they registered to use. 
First, Concord took its old name—its 
old name—and reregistered it as this 
new fictitious name. And so did 85 
Fund, taking its old name, Judicial 
Education Project, and registering it 
as a fictitious name. Go figure why 
that was necessary. 
Then they stood up new voter sup-
pression projects under other fictitious 
names: Honest Elections Project Ac-
tion and Honest Elections Project. 
Those 
two 
front 
groups—fictitious 
name front groups—are part of the 
dark money armada, along with Herit-
age Action and others, through which 
big rightwing donors orchestrated the 
anti-voting laws that have spread like 
a virus through Republican State legis-
latures. That didn’t just happen. That 
was done. And as a Heritage Action 
employee admitted in a leaked video, 
they did it, quietly, through sentinels. 
Concord also added another fictitious 
name, Free to Learn Action, and 85 
Fund created the twin Free to Learn. 
These fronts are presumably to whip up 
the rightwing about so-called critical 
race theory when the big donors want. 
Gobs of money pours into this propa-
ganda machine. The 85 Fund’s last tax 
filing shows $65 million in revenues, in-
cluding one $48.5 million donation from 
a single, anonymous donor. If it is the 
same single, anonymous donor that 
contributed the over $15 million con-
tributions to the Judicial Crisis Net-
work before, that would put one donor 
over $100 million into this Court-cap-
ture scheme—and all that money for an 
organization with only one employee 
who draws a salary of over $100,000 per 
year. 
So no surprise, then, that the 85 Fund 
channels lots of money back to the 
CRC mother ship. Its last tax filing 
shows over $12 million paid to Leo’s 
CRC Advisors for so-called consulting/ 
advertising services, and it distributed 
over $34 million to other unnamed 
groups, presumably in other areas of 
the scheme, in a big dark money shuf-
fle. 
We are still waiting for Concord Fund 
records for the most recent tax year, 
but the previous year’s filing proves 
the Axios reporting is spot on. Con-
cord’s top independent contractor is 
CRC Advisors, paid over $4.2 million for 
consulting services. It is out of this 
pea-and-shell game switcheroo that the 
dark money Judicial Crisis Network ad 
emerges. 
I have noticed recently—in fact, as 
recently as our last Judiciary Com-
mittee markup—that Republicans are 
currently reverting, often, to the same 
dark money line of attack as the Judi-
cial Crisis Network. As we watch Re-
publican Senators attack Democrat 
dark money, let’s remember a few 
things. First, Republicans created, pro-
tected, and defended—and defend to 
this day—dark money. Republicans

block our efforts to get rid of dark 
money. 
Republicans came first to the dark 
money game with billions of dark 
money dollars. Then, when we began to 
play by their rules—the rules they 
made, the rules they defend—they com-
plained. I guess they hope that we will 
unilaterally disarm so they can pound 
us with dark money just as they did for 
years after their Republican Justices 
in Citizens United let the big money 
flow. 
Well, unilateral disarmament isn’t 
going to happen, but that is not the 
only reason for the squid ink. The 
falsehood of this ad serves to damn us 
all in the eyes of the public. The right-
wing scheme reckons that Americans, 
frustrated and cynical about a slimy, 
dark money battle purportedly involv-
ing both sides, will tune out and turn 
away from what Justice Sotomayor 
has called the ‘‘stench’’ of partisanship 
emerging at the Supreme Court. 
All this misdirection—squid ink—can 
then 
distract 
from 
their 
captured 
Court’s record for the big scheme’s do-
nors. The ‘‘Roberts Five’’ have a pat-
tern now, a pattern of 80—80—partisan 
5-to-4 decisions, all benefiting easily 
identified Republican donor interests— 
an 80-to-0 record. It is a heck of a pat-
tern. 
And now they have a new rightwing, 
dark money supermajority to amp it 
up even further. It is no wonder polling 
shows that Americans believe the six- 
Justice Republican majority is moti-
vated mainly by politics and that the 
Court’s approval rating just hit an all-
time low. 
So a little distraction is in order. Cue 
the squid ink. Meanwhile, the Senate 
minority leader is reportedly urging 
his caucus to keep a low profile on 
Biden’s nominee. I get it. When you 
have got your burglars inside merrily 
ransacking a house, the last thing you 
want is a noisy ruckus out on the front 
lawn. One liberal Justice exchanged for 
another isn’t worth a fuss when the 
loot is being shoveled out the window 
to your gang. 
If there was any honest concern 
about dark money on the Republican 
side, there is a really, really easy way 
to show it: support legislation to clean 
it up; put an end to it. 
I have a bill, the DISCLOSE Act. It 
will end dark money in our politics and 
in our judiciary. Every single Senate 
Democrat has voted in favor of this 
DISCLOSE 
Act. 
Even 
the 
liberal 
groups that Judicial Crisis Network 
complains about are backing that bill. 
So, my Republican friends, support 
it, pass the law, end the slimy, polit-
ical, dark money era we now live in. 
They could do that, but I will make 
you a bet that they won’t. Dark money 
power is too important a weapon for 
rightwing donors to abandon. 
So, 
instead, 
Republicans 
in 
this 
Chamber filibuster that legislation— 
filibuster it—and dark money con-
tinues to corrupt our politics. 
Brace yourselves, folks. Squid ink 
will flow in the weeks and months 
ahead. For the dark money forces 
squirting out the squid ink, the aim is 
defense, defense of their mighty prize: 
the Court that dark money built and 
that dances to their dark money tune. 
To be continued. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I 
commend my colleague for talking 
about dark money. I was so curious 
this week when I saw—I think it was— 
a New York Times article about the 
amount of dark money that came from 
the Democratic side of the aisle this 
year far outpacing anything that Re-
publicans had spent. So I hope he is 
going to be successful in dealing with 
some of his supporters on that side of 
the aisle. 
CRIME AND BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. President, what I want to focus 
on today is a meeting that I had the 
opportunity to have last week with the 
Tennessee Association of Chiefs of Po-
lice and yesterday with Tennessee 
sheriffs who had come up. 
And one of the things that they 
talked about repeatedly in these meet-
ings is the recent crime spike. This is 
something on everybody’s mind, and 
for good reason. The majority of Amer-
ica’s 40 most populous cities saw an in-
crease in homicides last year—40 most 
populous, increase, homicides. More of-
ficers were intentionally killed on the 
job than in any other year since the 
September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. 
This is why morale is low. 
Shoplifting 
is 
surging, 
and 
the 
thieves are getting creative. Instead of 
stuffing merchandise in their clothing 
and smuggling it out the door, gangs of 
thieves are executing smash-and-grab 
raids. We are also seeing a spike in 
drug use. Overdose deaths were up 30 
percent in 2020. 
This is not trivial; it is not frivolous; 
it is not a laughing matter; and it is 
something you cannot just overlook. It 
is life. 
And I am sorry to say that Tennessee 
hasn’t escaped this terrible trend. In 
2021, the homicide spike in Memphis 
set a new record. We lost more than 
3,000 Tennesseans to drug overdoses in 
2020. 
Law enforcement officers take this 
personally because they see how quick-
ly crime can destroy a community. Are 
they worried? Yes. Do they have reason 
to be worried? Absolutely. As I said, 
morale is low. Recruiting is hard. 
But here is what struck me about my 
conversation with the police chiefs and 
the sheriffs. They don’t only consider 
the local effects. They really see the 
big picture and the issue writ large for 
what it truly is. 
You won’t be surprised to know that 
the lack of security along our southern 
border came up more than once in 
these conversations. The chiefs, the of-
ficers see the ripple effects of the Biden 
administration’s 
absolutely 
demor-
alizing failure to enforce the law. 
On his first day in the White House, 
President Biden endorsed lawlessness 
when he made it harder for Border Pa-
trol to secure the country. That stroke 
of a pen caused absolute chaos on our 
southern border. 
Border Patrol detained more than 1.7 
million migrants between January and 
September of 2021, and 1.1 million of 
those people were single adults. They 
were not families. 
Those 1.7 million were just the ones 
we were able to catch. We will never 
know how many hundreds of thousands 
of ‘‘got-aways’’ made it into the inte-
rior of the country, nor do we know 
what they were bringing in with them 
that they were trying to evade the Bor-
der Patrol. 
People and drugs are flowing across 
the border. Just last week, I came here 
to the floor and told the story of the 
Border Patrol’s $7 million week. Be-
tween January 21 and January 28, 1 
week, they seized 47 pounds of meth, 
3,800 pounds of marijuana, and almost 
20 pounds of cocaine—1 week. 
Hopefully, those drug mules are be-
hind bars, but, remember, those are 
just the drug mules we caught. We do 
not know what the ‘‘got-aways’’ were 
bringing in with them or how many 
drug mules there were or how many 
hundreds of women they were traf-
ficking in for sex trafficking, for 
human trafficking, for gangs, for labor 
crews. We don’t know. 
My Democratic colleagues continue 
to spin the border crisis as a purely hu-
manitarian issue, but what we are see-
ing along our southern border is 
lawbreaking. In many cases, it is dan-
gerous criminal behavior. And the 
Biden administration is ignoring every 
bit of it. Don’t believe what you see. 
Don’t believe the Border Patrol. Don’t 
believe the people who are down there 
running videos. Oh, no. Everything is 
fine. Just listen to them. 
But do you know who does not be-
lieve this? Our law enforcement offi-
cers. They don’t believe what this ad-
ministration is saying because they see 
something different. Every town is a 
border town, every State is a border 
State because of that open southern 
border. 
Our law enforcement officers can’t 
ignore this. They can’t ignore the rip-
ple effects because they live it every 
single day. They put on the belt, the 
badge. They go out, and they do their 
job. They see how the Democrats’ de-
sire to ignore lawless behavior when it 
benefits their narrative has created a 
perfect storm of violence, of fear, and 
has empowered criminals—not quite 
the message you want to send if you 
believe in the rule of law. 
Just yesterday, I had to send a letter 
to Health and Human Services demand-
ing to know why taxpayer dollars are 
funding fresh crack pipes for drug ad-
dicts. That is right. A HHS spokesman 
has confirmed that the Agency is push-
ing a grant program that would fund 
so-called smoking kits with pipes for 
users to smoke crystal meth, crack co-
caine, and ‘‘any illicit substances’’— 
government-funded drug paraphernalia.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S590 
February 9, 2022 
Every once in a while, you think you 
have heard it all. Meanwhile, the bor-
der sits wide open, crime is on the rise, 
and we are asking police departments 
to do more with less. 
A recent survey showed that between 
April 2020 and April 2021, police force 
retirements were up 45 percent, and 
resignations were up 18 percent com-
pared to the previous year. There is no 
coincidence there. 
It is time for the administration to 
decide whose side they are on. Are they 
on the side of the American people? 
Are they on the side of law enforce-
ment? Are they on the side of criminals 
and monsters who really are respon-
sible for this terrible crime spike? 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, when the 
Biden administration ordered the evac-
uation of families of U.S. diplomats 
from Ukraine last month due to the in-
creased threats of Russian military ac-
tion and crime, a Ukrainian official 
clapped back: ‘‘Quite frankly these 
Americans are safer in Kyiv than they 
are in [Los Angeles] . . . or any other 
crime-ridden city in the U.S.’’ 
Yes, that is what a Ukrainian official 
said. The comment really struck a 
nerve because it may not be so far from 
the truth. In fact, an L.A. Police De-
partment detective says the out-of-con-
trol crime in the city is ‘‘so violent, 
we’re telling people ‘don’t visit,’ be-
cause we don’t think we can keep you 
safe right now.’’ The city was surren-
dered to criminals by the L.A. district 
attorney on his first day on the job in 
2020 when he banned bail and prohib-
ited prosecuting even the most serious 
crimes, like murder and rape, to the 
fullest extent of the law. 
The consequences of giving ‘‘get out 
of 
jail 
free’’ 
cards 
to 
criminals 
shouldn’t surprise anyone. Flash mobs 
of thieves breaking into local busi-
nesses are giving new meaning to ‘‘door 
busters’’ as they ransack city stores 
like bargain shoppers on Black Friday. 
Looters are robbing trains like it is 
the Wild West, making off with mil-
lions of dollars’ worth of merchandise, 
including 
pistols 
and 
shotguns. 
A 
Union Pacific Railroad official says 
that even when apprehended, criminals 
boast that they will face no serious 
charges, and within hours, they are let 
back out on the streets. 
But most troubling, over the past 2 
years, Los Angeles has experienced a 
shocking 94-percent increase in homi-
cides. The L.A. sheriff says it is prob-
ably one of the biggest jumps ever, and 
he lays the blame on the woke policies 
of both the district attorney and the 
county board. 
These 
senseless 
acts 
of 
violence 
aren’t confined to liberal Los Angeles, 
and neither is the revolving-prison- 
door approach that is allowing career 
criminals to roam our streets. The U.S. 
murder rate hit its highest point in a 
quarter of a century last year. More 
and more felons are being released 
across the country as a result of per-
missive policies being pushed by pro-
gressive politicians and lenient district 
attorneys who view punishment as the 
real crime. 
Democrats in New York, for example, 
recently pushed through a State law 
requiring the release of suspects ar-
rested for stalking, arson, robbery, and 
other misdemeanors without bail. They 
require the release without bail. And 
despite the dramatic increases in crime 
in New York City, a Democrat district 
attorney released a list of crimes—I am 
serious about this, folks—released a 
list of crimes on his first day in office 
that would no longer be prosecuted, in-
cluding resisting arrest. The DA claims 
longer sentences don’t deter crime or 
result in greater community safety. 
But a former New York City police 
commissioner points out the obvious— 
that when you say you are not going to 
prosecute certain crimes, you are send-
ing a strong message to criminals. And 
it is the wrong message to criminals. 
He notes that since the penalty was 
taken away, stealing a car has become 
a game. As a result, vehicle theft is 
driving up the city’s crime rate, and 
the New York Post reported just last 
week that the Big Apple is becoming a 
live action version of the game Grand 
Theft Auto. 
But the wave of crime that has been 
unleashed is far more deadly than just 
stolen property. New York City’s mur-
der rate spiked an astounding 47 per-
cent last year, and the killing spree is 
continuing into 2022. The latest victims 
include a teenager who was working at 
Burger King and two young police offi-
cers. 
Refusing to keep dangerous, repeat 
criminals with a history of violence be-
hind bars allows anyone, at any time, 
to become the victim of an entirely 
preventable crime. 
For example, the low bail set by a 
Wisconsin District Attorney’s Office 
last November resulted in the release 
of a violent criminal with a very long 
list of charges going back 15 years, in-
cluding running over a woman with a 
Ford Escape. Within days of being re-
leased, he drove that same SUV into a 
crowded Christmas parade, injuring 
more than 60 people and killing 6, in-
cluding a 5-year-old child and several 
members of the Dancing Grannies, who 
were entertaining the crowds at that 
Christmas parade. In a split second, the 
joy of the season was turned into a 
gruesome crime scene because a vio-
lent, repeat offender was set free. The 
Democrat district attorney has since 
admitted the release was ‘‘a mistake.’’ 
Folks, we cannot afford any more of 
these mistakes by public officials who 
are putting their personal political 
agenda ahead of protecting our public. 
If letting criminals out of jail with-
out bail isn’t bad enough, progressive 
politicians are even—get this—pro-
viding perks for perpetrators. The 
Biden administration, for instance, is 
allowing illegal immigrants to use ar-
rest warrants as alternate forms of ID 
at airports to clear security check-
points and board airplanes—arrest war-
rants. Seriously, folks. 
Some liberal cities, like New York 
and San Francisco, have cash for crimi-
nals, programs that actually pay prior 
offenders in the hopes that they won’t 
shoot anyone. Great plan. That is 
right—the same gang calling to defund 
the police wants to fund felons. 
A California cash for criminals pro-
gram may have allowed some individ-
uals to get away with murder. As long 
as the participants pledge to improve, 
they are still paid. Even when caught 
with a gun or, worse, suspected of mur-
der, they get paid. 
Folks, it is one thing to give first- 
time, nonviolent offenders a second 
chance, but rewarding career criminals 
by letting them loose and paying them 
an allowance is itself criminal. 
Democrats’ approach to criminal jus-
tice can be summed up as ‘‘take no 
prisoners’’ literally. 
Instead of admitting their approach 
has backfired, liberals keep looking for 
excuses, and they play the blame game. 
To address the rise in carjackings in 
Chicago, for example, progressive poli-
ticians proposed banning the video 
game Grand Theft Auto. Perhaps the 
real problem is making crime all fun 
and games, with no real-world pen-
alties and only rewards, just like the 
video game. 
A retired police officer who was 
carjacked in his own driveway south of 
the city says the carjackers know that 
even if they are caught, ‘‘they are 
going to get right back out.’’ That is 
because the area’s State 
attorney 
promised to reduce the prison popu-
lation, and by golly, she is keeping 
that promise by dismissing tens of 
thousands of criminal cases. As a re-
sult, about 100 people charged with 
murder in Cook County have been let 
out on the city streets. 
The Chicago police superintendent is 
even warning that the Cook County 
court is ‘‘making us all less safe by re-
leasing violent offenders.’’ The horri-
fying numbers speak for themselves. 
Chicago had more murders last year 
than any other city in the United 
States with nearly 800 homicides. That 
is more people than in the small com-
munity I grew up near—800 homicides. 
Shootings in the city are up a shock-
ing 63 percent since 2019. One of the 
fatal victims was a 7-year-old girl who 
was gunned down at a McDonald’s by a 
gang member who was allowed out of 
prison despite being charged with other 
crimes. The suspects in another recent 
shootout, which left one dead and two 
others wounded, were released without 
charges. 
Public officials charged with enforc-
ing the law who signal that it is OK to 
commit crime by reducing or elimi-
nating penalties are engaging in crimi-
nal negligence. It is time to put an end 
to prosecutors being partners in crime. 
I took the first step towards making 
our streets safer by introducing legisla-
tion to increase the penalties for some

violent offenders and child predators, 
including life imprisonment for repeat 
offenders. 
Folks, progressive prosecutors need 
to stop playing politics and start doing 
their job, which is enforcing the law. 
Criminal penalties are not just sugges-
tions; they are put in place to protect 
the public. Parents shouldn’t have to 
worry about the safety of their chil-
dren, and no one should feel unsafe, es-
pecially in their own neighborhood. 
Let’s get serious about crime so that 
the only people in America who are 
afraid to walk the streets are the 
criminals. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, I 
have two words for you today: ‘‘crack 
pipes’’—crack pipes, not crackpots. 
Many of us went to bed last night, 
others waking up this morning, and 
heads are exploding across this Nation 
as we learn that this administration is 
giving crack pipes to crackheads. I 
think when the history books are writ-
ten about this President and 2020 
through 2024, that will be the picture 
right next to the President’s name—a 
picture of crack pipes being given out 
by this administration. 
I want to come back to that in a sec-
ond, though. 
I have a picture of my dad today and 
our dog Rennie. My dad and our fam-
ily—my mom, an older brother, young-
er sister—moved off the family farm 
when I was 5. My dad was a proud, 
proud police officer. I remember the 
day in kindergarten when my dad and 
our family dog Rennie came to visit 
and what a proud moment it was for 
me. In 3 years, my dad was head of the 
fire department, and 2 years after that, 
he became the chief of police. My dad 
was the chief of police in El Dorado, 
KS, for some 25 years. 
My dad represented law in the com-
munity. He represented right from 
wrong, and he applied that law equally. 
There was never a gray area for my 
dad. I remember having dinner at my 
grandma’s house one Sunday evening 
and the phone ringing. We didn’t have 
pagers. We didn’t have cell phones. 
All I remember, my dad was saying: 
Stand down. 
My grandma looked at us and said: 
You guys better hug your dad goodbye. 
I said: Grandma, what do you mean? 
She said: He may not come back. 
It was a familiar story of a domestic 
violence, of a drunk husband with his 
wife on the front porch. There was al-
ways a 12-gauge shotgun. It was never 
a 16-gauge or a 20; it was always a 12- 
gauge shotgun. My dad was the person 
who would go and disarm that person. 
It happened way too often. 
But I just tell that story as we remi-
nisce because we know how important 
law enforcement officers are to all of 
us. 
I remember, you know, you sit 
around and you listen while you are 
making homemade ice cream, and peo-
ple asked my dad questions about 
crime. I think of those crack pipes and 
my dad always saying that drugs and 
crime go hand in hand like peanut but-
ter and jelly—the more drug abuse 
there is, the more crimes there were in 
the community. 
I remember somebody asking him 
why would the police officers be so 
strict about petty crimes. Maybe it was 
a little vandalism. Maybe it was a bro-
ken window. Maybe it was graffiti. I re-
member my dad talking about, you 
have to set an example, that if you 
allow people to vandalize, if you allow 
people to do graffiti, if you allow peo-
ple to break windows, it is just a cas-
cade of bigger crimes. 
I finished up some townhalls this 
past weekend—15 townhalls in the past 
2 weeks—and what Americans are con-
cerned about are inflation and crime. 
This is what Americans—Kansans—are 
telling me that they are seeing every 
night on their television sets. They are 
seeing 2 million people—maybe 6 mil-
lion people—cross our border illegally, 
and they see this administration re-
ward them with an all-expenses-paid 
vacation trip to any city in America. 
America has seen riots and van-
dalism on television, and this adminis-
tration and this party applaud them. 
Every night, we see looting and shop-
lifting, but this administration says: 
Don’t prosecute. 
Last year, America saw 5 tons of 
fentanyl cross the border illegally, 
cross our southern border—five tons. 
Think of five big semitrucks loaded 
with a ton—that is 2,000 pounds—of 
fentanyl. I remind everybody that 1 
teaspoon of fentanyl can kill 2,000 to 
3,000 Americans. 
We are seeing our law enforcement 
officers being told to turn their backs 
on violent crimes, to not chase the bad 
guys. America sees this White House 
and their party turn their backs on law 
enforcement officers. 
Again, I go back to my dad. I remem-
ber it was probably around 2014, and 
my dad and I were fishing, as we often 
do together, probably crappie fishing 
on a farm pond in the Flint Hills of 
Kansas, my favorite place to be. My 
dad said to me: You know, Son, I don’t 
think this President has the back of 
our law enforcement officers any more. 
As I visit with those law enforcement 
officers every time I am back—and I 
appreciate them coming to my town-
halls and having my back—I can tell 
you, 
the 
law 
enforcement 
officers 
across this country do not feel like 
they are being supported by this White 
House. 
As I think about an America of today 
versus growing up, I do think there has 
been a decay in our culture, and this 
‘‘defund the police’’ movement from 
the radical left made that culture even 
weaker. We have members of this squad 
wanting to close Federal prisons. They 
encourage open borders. They want 
illegals to use arrest warrants to get 
through the TSA. Of course, they want 
criminals to get off the hook. There is 
this culture of lawlessness. 
Again, I go back to my generation of 
‘‘If it feels good, do it.’’ I remember 
that saying for the first time from 
some song, I believe, from the early 
1970s, ‘‘If it feels good, do it,’’ and that 
is the way this country is acting right 
now. What is the result? We see crowds 
chanting ‘‘Pigs in a blanket, fry ‘em 
[up] like bacon.’’ 
‘‘Pigs in a blanket, fry ‘em [up] like 
bacon.’’ 
The next time one of those houses is 
burning down that one of those people 
lives in, I wonder who they are going to 
call. If they are stranded in a motor ve-
hicle accident, who is going to be the 
first one on the scene? Again, I go back 
to thinking about my dad and him car-
rying out one of my classmates in sec-
ond grade from a fire. Unfortunately, 
my classmate didn’t make it. 
Three hundred forty-six law enforce-
ment officers were shot in 2021. Sev-
enty-three were intentional. Twenty- 
four were shot last month—a 40-per-
cent increase. Ambush-style attacks 
increased 115 percent. We have never 
seen a crimewave like this across our 
Nation—not since the early 1990s, any-
way. The United States recently saw 
the fastest increase in murder rates 
ever recorded. Violent crimes spiked. 
Fourteen major, Democratic-run cities 
are setting alltime highs for homicide 
records. The numbers continue to go 
up. 
As I think about advice for this ad-
ministration, I know if they had the 
will, they could fix this problem. I 
know exactly what my dad would tell 
them. He would say: Treat criminals 
like criminals. Treat police officers, 
law enforcement officers, like heroes. 
Tell them thanks. Reward them. Re-
spect them. 
It is time to re-fund the police, folks. 
It is time to secure the border. Let’s 
hold criminals accountable. 
It was a rare day, but I do remember 
my dad talking at the supper table 
about someone they worked so hard to 
convict, and a judge or DA let them off 
easy. We need to prosecute the small-
est of crimes. 
We need an Attorney General. Where 
is our Attorney General? Where is he? 
In the middle of this crime spree, 
where is our Attorney General? He 
needs to be tough on crime instead of 
labeling parents as ‘‘domestic terror-
ists.’’ 
Simply, America, it is time to get 
back to our values—the same values 
my dad raised us on. It is time to, like 
my dad did, apply the law equally. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ROSEN). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
last week, a member of the Biden ad-
ministration was confused—very con-
fused—why FOX News is talking all the 
time about crime. That person is the 
Press Secretary to President Biden, 
Ms. Psaki. She said Americans care 
more about what is happening in their 
daily lives than what the news says 
about crime.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S592 
February 9, 2022 
How much more out of touch could 
the Biden administration be? Crime is 
happening in Americans’ daily lives all 
across America. Thousands more peo-
ple a year are being murdered. 
Violent crime has increased for 2 
years, and there is no sign of it slowing 
down. 
The administration’s plan to fix the 
violent crime spike is merely another 
partisan gun control plan. That is what 
they think about, doing something 
about crime: control the guns of people 
who abide by the law. 
They won’t seriously reduce violent 
crime. If you do that, it focuses on 
issues that make up a tiny fraction of 
violent crimes or maybe it doesn’t con-
tribute to the problem at all. 
For 
example, 
the 
administration 
wants to crack down on ghost guns, but 
ghost guns are involved in only a frac-
tion of 1 percent of the crimes—par-
ticularly of the murders. 
The Biden administration also wants 
to focus on the so-called ‘‘Iron Pipe-
line,’’ and that is blaming red States 
for guns in crime-ridden blue States. 
But on that issue, the Bureau of Alco-
hol, Tobacco, and Firearms, their data 
shows that guns used in blue-city 
crimes usually come from that very 
same blue State. 
Finally, the Biden administration 
wants to focus on lawful gun sellers, 
but we have a Department of Justice 
study finding most crimes are com-
mitted with stolen guns from the black 
market. 
So I worry about the Department of 
Justice could use efforts to reduce vio-
lent crime as a pretext to harass lawful 
gun dealers and owners. Gun sales have 
increased nationwide because Ameri-
cans don’t feel safe anymore. They feel 
the police are not proactively policing, 
so they get a gun to protect them-
selves. 
Honest people who don’t break the 
law want to feel safe, and that makes 
them feel safe. I don’t blame them for 
taking protection of their life and 
property into their hands. 
I related recently about the increases 
in crime that have nothing to do with 
guns, and yet all we hear from this ad-
ministration is about controlling guns. 
But what does that have to do—gun 
control is not going to stop criminals 
from pushing people in front of subway 
trains. Gun control won’t stop flash 
mobs from stealing goods from stores. 
It isn’t going to stop the thieves from 
looting train yards, and you see evi-
dence of this all the time on tele-
vision—almost daily—people going into 
stores with bags, filling it up, and just 
think in San Francisco some pros-
ecutor said if you steal less than $950, 
you won’t be prosecuted. 
So you wonder why people commit 
crime. If you aren’t going to pay a pen-
alty for it, why not do it? So the Biden 
administration is wasting precious re-
sources and taxpayer dollars on par-
tisan pet projects of gun control. 
The Biden administration has or-
dered the Department of Justice to 
look like it is doing something without 
really doing anything at all. 
You know what Americans actually 
need to reduce violent crime? They 
need police forces empowered to do 
their jobs with the right resources and 
protections. 
Now, we hear the Biden administra-
tion just last week in New York saying 
it supports police. The President him-
self was up there. But a leaked Execu-
tive order shows it wants to take away 
their nonlethal, lifesaving tools, and 
make it more difficult for police to get 
grants for funding. 
Americans also need responsible bail 
policies—these policies that, if they 
were responsible, wouldn’t let dan-
gerous criminals back out onto the 
streets to kill people. 
They need prosecutors who will actu-
ally do their job to keep violent crimi-
nals away from the vulnerable. The 
Biden administration has a chance to 
make a real difference in reducing vio-
lent crime. It is a shame that they are 
wasting their time and resources on a 
misleading message. 
When you see the prosecutors in Los 
Angeles and San Francisco listing a 
whole bunch of crimes that they are 
not going to prosecute, it just invites 
lawbreaking. We need to stop this 
‘‘defund the police’’ crusade. We need 
to step up prosecution. We need to 
eliminate progressive prosecutors. We 
need to make sure that people don’t 
get bail if they are repeat criminals or 
a threat to society. 
In the final analysis, taxpayers are 
paying for public safety, but in some 
places in the United States, they aren’t 
getting their money’s worth for public 
safety they pay for. Government is set 
up to maintain public safety, and that 
is what we are all about with this War 
on Crime, protecting the taxpayers, 
protecting every citizen taxpayer or 
not. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wisconsin. 
Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, of-
tentimes when we talk rising crime, we 
talk about statistics. For example, last 
year in Milwaukee, there were 194 mur-
ders. 
As I prepared to give remarks yester-
day, I got the stat that there were 26 
murders already this year. That is an 
86-percent increase. Unfortunately, last 
night there were two more murders, 
and now it is up to 28. 
Seventy-three law enforcement offi-
cers were intentionally killed in the 
line of duty last year. That is the high-
est it has been since 1995. 
We had three police officers shot in a 
2-week period at the end of January. 
Those are just some of the statistics, 
and I am sure you have heard a lot 
more on the floor here today. But one 
thing I don’t think we talk about 
enough are the victims. 
I heard President Biden’s Press Sec-
retary, Jen Psaki, last week. I guess 
she was monitoring different TV sta-
tions, and she remarked that one com-
mentator was talking about soft-on- 
crime consequences, and she giggled 
and said what does that even mean? 
Well, I will talk about what it means. 
An excellent article in the Just the 
News a couple days ago had some 
heartbreaking examples of those con-
sequences. 
Last week, we held an event about 
the open border, about the catch-and- 
release policies of this administration, 
record levels of people coming into this 
country illegally and what that rep-
resents from a standpoint of national 
security and homeland security and 
crime. 
In Alabama’s Chilton County, two il-
legal immigrants, ages 27 and 28, have 
been charged in the murders of three 
adults found shot and burned in an 
SUV. 
In another recent case, a Florida fa-
ther who believed he was taking in a 
16-year-old migrant minor from Hon-
duras, a Good Samaritan, was killed by 
that migrant who turned out to be 
much older and involved in crime. 
In Florida, a 5-year-old girl riding in 
her mother’s car was crushed to death 
when an illegal immigrant from Hon-
duras crashed into the car. The driver 
admitted he got into the car after 
drinking six cans of 32-ounce beers. 
In Harris County, TX, an illegal im-
migrant from El Salvador is charged 
with exiting his vehicle during a rou-
tine traffic stop and fatally shooting 
the sheriff’s deputy in the face. 
Those are just a few examples of the 
consequences of soft-on-crime policies. 
Those are crimes that were committed 
by illegal immigrants that take advan-
tage of the catch-and-release policies 
on the border. 
But we are not only just experiencing 
catch-and-release on the southern bor-
der, we also have catch-and-release in 
our criminal justice system—these no- 
bail, low-bail policies promoted by gen-
erally Democrat district attorneys in 
cities governed for decades by Demo-
crats. 
We had a tragedy in Waukesha, WI. It 
never should have happened. This was 
during the Waukesha Christmas pa-
rade, when children lined up on the 
street, on the curb, waiting to see 
Santa 
Claus—instead 
they 
saw 
a 
slaughter. Six innocent people lost 
their lives. Sixty-two people were in-
jured—their lives forever altered. 
And it didn’t have to happen because 
the murderer had been let out on a 
thousand-dollar bail after having run 
over the mother of his child with that 
same SUV. That is the result—that 
crime, those 6 innocent victims, those 
62 innocent victims who were injured, 
their family members, their loved ones 
are the consequences of soft-on-crime 
policies of Democratic governance. 
So as horrific as those 6 murders 
were, as horrific as the 62 injuries were, 
what I can’t get out of my mind are 
those little children sitting on the curb 
waiting to see Santa and instead wit-
nessing the slaughter. How do they 
ever recover from that? Is that some-
thing that Jen Psaki ever thinks

about? Is that something that Presi-
dent Biden ever thinks about? 
As 
Jen 
giggles 
about 
the 
con-
sequences, 
these 
are 
serious 
con-
sequences. We need to get tough on 
crime. We need to put violent crimi-
nals in jail and leave them in jail so 
they don’t create more victims. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority whip. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I 
think Senator BLUNT from Missouri is 
going to ask for recognition, and I do 
not object to that. But I was scheduled 
for earlier, and I would like to ask 
unanimous consent that when the up-
coming rollcall is completed, I be the 
first Senator recognized. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. DURBIN. Sorry, after the second 
rollcall, that I be the first Senator. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak for up to 5 
minutes before the scheduled rollcall 
vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, there 
are really few jobs in the country as 
difficult, as dangerous, and as demand-
ing as the sacrifice of being a law en-
forcement officer. I would suggest the 
one job that may possibly be harder— 
and certainly in my view is as hard—is 
to be the family member of a law en-
forcement officer, wondering all during 
that working shift what might be hap-
pening to the person you care so much 
about. 
You know the challenges to these of-
ficers and their families—the chal-
lenges they face today are intensified 
as local departments struggle with the 
staffing shortages caused by record 
high departures and difficulty filling 
the open positions they have got. 
The Eastern Missouri Police Acad-
emy had around half as many recruits 
join in 2021 as they had in 2020. In my 
hometown of Springfield, MO, they 
have 40 vacancies right now they are 
trying to fill in the department. 
In January, the Columbia, MO, Po-
lice Department had around 20 vacan-
cies in a force that its maximum size 
would be 187 or so people. 
According to the St. Louis Post Dis-
patch in September, officer departures 
in St. Louis City and St. Louis County 
spiked in 2021 and were at a pace to be 
up to 60 percent higher in each of those 
departments than they had been in the 
average year. 
In the police force here, I was with 
Chief Manger yesterday, and he pointed 
out that retirements and resignations 
were 50 percent higher than they have 
been in recent years in 2021. 
The new chief of police at the St. 
Louis County Police Force said: My 
biggest priority is hiring and finding 
people who will do these jobs. 
These staff shortages are unfortu-
nate, but they are in so many ways pre-
dictable of a movement that villainized 
enforcement for, I think, political gain 
in many cases. Officers have been de-
moralized by the ‘‘defund the police’’ 
crusade. They have been discouraged 
by prosecutors who put dangerous 
criminals back on the street or even 
put out a list of crimes that people will 
not be prosecuted for. 
That is well beyond the standard of 
belief that most people would have had, 
actually, until they heard it, my guess 
would be, that, no, these are crimes 
that we are just not going to prosecute 
people for. 
Police saw themselves, in many 
cases, forced out of the force because of 
a vaccine mandate they didn’t agree 
with, often going to smaller forces that 
had less than 100 people. 
All this is happening, really, against 
a backdrop of a crime wave that is 
harming communities of all sizes all 
across the country. 
When I talk to police chiefs, I hear 
concerns that a lot of good candidates 
are deciding maybe law enforcement 
won’t be the career that they want to 
have. When I talk to the sworn officers 
that I see here every day and I see at 
home, I hear many of them feel they 
just simply have a job where they face 
danger but they don’t get enough sup-
port that they need to do the job that 
they need to do. 
Police work has always been dan-
gerous. We have always lost officers. 
They have always been courageous in 
their willingness to stand up, but last 
year was the deadliest year ever for 
law enforcement officers. Four hundred 
fifty-eight officers died in the line of 
duty in 2021, 128 of them from gunshot 
wounds or fatalities from traffic. 
You don’t have to travel very far 
away from here, just down Pennsyl-
vania Avenue from the Capitol to the 
National Law Enforcement Officers 
Memorial, to understand what it means 
to lose officers and what it means to 
lose them in protection of the country. 
The marble walls there bear the names 
of thousands of officers who have been 
killed in the line of duty. Each corner 
of that memorial shows a lion pro-
tecting its cubs. 
We have always seen law enforce-
ment as our protectors, not as those we 
should somehow fear. It eats away at 
our society to say that we appreciate 
law enforcement but we really don’t 
want to do what is necessary to sup-
port law enforcement. 
I think there is no data that says one 
or more tweets that say ‘‘defund the 
police’’ leads to two crimes or two 
muggings, but it simply makes com-
mon sense that when police depart-
ments are understaffed and under-
trained, it increases the risk of violent 
crime on the officers themselves and 
the communities they serve. 
As the cochair of the Senate Law En-
forcement Caucus, one of my priorities 
has been to ensure that law enforce-
ment officers have the support and re-
sources they need to do the job they 
are asked to do and do it as safely and 
effectively as they possibly can. 
We certainty all can and I think 
would agree—I certainly would—that 
there really should be zero tolerance 
for police misconduct. Taking the oath 
to support and defend and then some-
how not conducting yourself in the 
right way, if you cross that line, you 
ought to be held accountable. 
We need to view people on the line as 
people who are there to defend us, to 
serve us. We need to make this a pro-
fession that people want to be part of, 
and if they are willing to be part of it, 
we have provided them everything they 
need to be safely doing the hard work 
that they are asked to do. 
I yield the floor.

The Senator from Texas. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. 
CORNYN. 
Madam 
President, 
folks in Texas and across the country 
are looking to their elected officials for 
sound leadership. Family budgets are 
being clobbered by the worst inflation 
in 40 years. From gas stations to gro-
cery stores and everywhere in between, 
people are spending significantly more 
money on their basic expenses. Infla-
tion has outpaced wage growth, giving 
the average worker a pay cut. That is 
what inflation does. It erodes and un-
dermines your standard of living by 
charging more for basic goods and serv-
ices. 
Families aren’t just stressing about 
their finances; they are also worried 
about their safety. The shocking surge 
in violent crime that began in 2020 
hasn’t just continued. In many places, 
it has accelerated, and last year sev-
eral major cities had their deadliest 
year on record. 
With the safety and well-being of 
their families at the forefront, our con-
stituents want to know what is being 
done to address these problems. They 
are pretty basic. 
What types of solutions do their rep-
resentatives have in the Senate and the 
House? What actions are the White 
House contemplating and how long will 
it be before they can experience some 
relief? Unfortunately, when the voters 
gave Democrats the leadership of the 
White House and both Houses of Con-
gress, the responsibility has largely 
been up to them to provide that leader-
ship when it comes to the agenda. 
Unfortunately, 
the 
real 
problems 
that my constituents in Texas are ex-
periencing, like inflation and crime, 
those were the last things for our lead-
ers here in Washington to consider. 
Forget real problems and real families; 
Democrats’ governing strategy was dic-
tated by partisan ambitions. 
Our colleagues tried to give the In-
ternal Revenue Service the unprece-
dented authority and manpower to 
snoop on the finances of virtually 
every single American. Now, we are ac-
customed to the fact that the IRS 
knows how much you make; that is 
how you calculate your taxes. But our 
Democratic colleagues went so far as 
to inquire for every family: How much 
money do you spend and what do you 
spend it on? That sort of invasion of 
privacy is unprecedented. 
Then our colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle tried to get involved in the 
childcare business and dictate what 
sort of childcare and where you would 
be able to get that childcare and how 
much it would cost. Basically, saying 
to those who are motivated to help 
support families when it comes to 
childcare, that if you are a faith-based 
organization, you are not going to 
qualify. And because of the huge influx 
of money that the Democrats were 
planning to put into childcare, exclud-
ing a huge segment of the childcare 
providers was going to result in scarce 
supply and run up the price, further ex-
acerbating inflation. 
Then we saw when it comes to the 
wealthy—our 
Democratic 
colleagues 
like to be the party of the average 
working person and complain about 
Big Business and millionaires and bil-
lionaires. But what do they do when it 
comes to tax proposals? They propose 
to give millionaires and billionaires a 
tax cut by eliminating the cap on de-
ductibility of State and local taxes in 
high-tax jurisdictions like New York 
and California. Who would have to pick 
up the responsibility or deficit? Well, 
you guessed it; it would be the middle 
class. 
Then we saw our colleagues on the 
left use the last year to attempt a Fed-
eral takeover of State-run elections. 
Some even proposed to blow up the 
rules of the Senate and eliminate the 
filibuster, the one thing that forces us 
to do what doesn’t come naturally, 
which is to work together and build bi-
partisan consensus. 
There were proposals from the major-
ity leader himself and others saying we 
are going to blow up the Senate be-
cause we cannot get our way, and the 
main reason we can’t get our way is be-
cause we are unwilling to work with 
the other side of the aisle. Thank good-
ness two of our colleagues, the Senator 
from West Virginia and the Senator 
from Arizona, tapped the brakes, and 
we have not yet found ourselves in that 
situation. 
So every one of these examples I 
mentioned has been tried and failed in 
this last year. But there is, of course, 
what 
economists 
call 
opportunity 
costs. We can’t take back the last year 
that we wasted on these partisan ef-
forts. A lot of the damage has been 
done. Invaluable time has been wasted 
on partisan legislation that was sure to 
go nowhere, while the most basic re-
sponsibilities of governing had been 
tossed aside. 
Last year, our Democratic colleagues 
nearly dropped a debt bomb on our 
economy. We had to spend a lot of 
money during the COVID pandemic. 
And during the last year of the Trump 
administration, we did that on a bipar-
tisan basis. But even after the immi-
nent need for that help was subsiding, 
our colleagues decided to spend an-
other $2 trillion in the first months of 
the Biden administration. Only 10 per-
cent of that was COVID–19 related and

February 9, 2022 
less than 1 percent had to do with peo-
ple getting access to therapeutics and 
vaccine. 
Our colleagues allowed the National 
Defense Authorization Act to sit on the 
shelf, to linger on the calendar for 
months, leaving it until the very last 
minute. And then we find ourselves 
just 9 days away from a shutdown of 
the Federal Government. Our col-
leagues in the majority have yet to 
pass a single appropriations bill on a 
regular basis. And unless Congress 
takes action here in the next week and 
a half, the American people can add a 
government shutdown to the list of cri-
ses that we are facing. 
Unfortunately, this is a familiar 
story. We found ourselves in this posi-
tion on more than one occasion over 
the last several months. Congress’s 
deadline to pass funding bills doesn’t 
just pop up out of nowhere. It hits at 
the same time every year, September 
30. Back in September, it was clear 
that a yearlong funding bill was no-
where in sight, and so our colleagues in 
the majority kicked the can down the 
road for 2 months. Rather than use 
that time to try to pass annual appro-
priations bills, they wasted week after 
week on unserious, partisan bills. 
By the time the new deadline rolled 
around, nothing had changed, and so 
our colleagues had to punt again, set-
ting up a new deadline of February 18. 
And based on the way things look right 
now, it doesn’t appear that we are any 
closer to an annual funding agreement 
than we were last September or last 
December. There is some rumor of a 
top-line funding level agreement but 
no real progress on the underlying sub-
stance of these appropriations bills. 
So you can’t help but wonder, how 
has it taken so long to accomplish so 
little? Our colleagues are steering the 
ship of state, both Chambers of Con-
gress, and the White House, and still 
we can’t seem to come up with a way 
to do the basic function of governing, 
which is to fund the government. We 
managed to avoid government shut-
downs, to be sure, but that is a pretty 
low bar to clear. 
The Democratic majority has intro-
duced yet another short-term funding 
bill that would carry us through March 
11. I sincerely hope that progress can 
be made before then. I am just not sure 
how long the conversation should con-
tinue when we know what the job is 
that remains to be done and what the 
sticking points are. 
But that is where we are. Our col-
leagues haven’t just punted critical re-
sponsibilities. In some cases, they have 
ignored them completely. 
In 2021, for the first time on record, 
there were more than 2 million people 
who attempted to enter the United 
States without a visa, a passport, or 
legal immigration papers—2 million 
people—and those are just the ones 
that the Border Patrol encountered. It 
doesn’t 
count 
the 
so-called 
‘‘got- 
aways,’’ which is what the Border Pa-
trol calls the drug smugglers and other 
criminals who come across the border 
at the same time. 
Two million people is larger than the 
population 
of 
a 
dozen 
individual 
States. That is how many new people 
have come into the United States dur-
ing a pandemic, without being vac-
cinated, without proof of a negative 
COVID test, and at a time when people 
are concerned about their jobs. 
The Biden administration has al-
lowed this crisis to grow and grow and 
grow without any substantial action. 
As a matter of fact, the Secretary of 
Homeland Security and other members 
of the President’s Cabinet have actu-
ally made it worse. Border Patrol will 
tell you there are two main things that 
they look for when it comes to illegal 
immigration. They look for the push 
factors, which are things like violence 
and poverty in some of the states and 
places people are coming from. We all 
get that. We understand those being 
the push factors, but they also talk 
about the pull factors, which puts a big 
sign out that you are free to come to 
the United States without any real 
consequence. You don’t need to get in 
line. You don’t need to comply with 
our immigration laws. You can just 
come as fast as you can get here. 
One of the biggest pull factors is the 
misguided guidance from the Secretary 
of Homeland Security himself. I call it 
nonenforcement guidance. Basically, 
Secretary Mayorkas has said Border 
Patrol will not detain anyone whose 
only offense is entering the country il-
legally. 
That sends a big welcome sign to 
anybody who wants to come to the 
United States without going through 
our legal immigration system. And the 
transnational criminal organizations 
that benefit from this financially make 
millions and millions—including bil-
lions—of dollars by smuggling people 
and drugs into the United States. 
And while an open border’s message 
may appeal to some elements on the 
left, it is creating serious burdens for 
law enforcement in border commu-
nities. 
Over the last year, I have spent a lot 
of time listening to my constituents 
and the professionals in the Border Pa-
trol about the many challenges that 
this crisis has created. Border Patrol 
agents are pulling double duty as 
childcare providers because our laws 
incentivize unaccompanied minors to 
come to the United States. 
Now, nobody actually believes they 
get here on their own, but once they 
are here, under our current laws, they 
have to be placed with the State, with 
a sponsor, and told to show up for a 
hearing—for your asylum hearing— 
months, maybe years, in the future. 
And nobody is surprised when as many 
as half of those individuals don’t show 
up for their asylum hearing—same 
thing for the adults in the family 
units. 
But while you may think that this is 
primarily a problem for border States 
like Texas and Arizona, California and 
New Mexico, and others, it actually ex-
tends throughout the country. One of 
our colleagues from Montana tells me 
that his sheriff in one of his major cit-
ies said that one of the biggest prob-
lems they have is methamphetamine 
that is smuggled across the U.S.-Mex-
ico border. 
You can’t get much farther north, 
and you can’t get much farther away 
from the southwestern border than the 
State of Montana, but that is what the 
ripple effect of this uncontrolled illegal 
immigration, along with the drugs 
being smuggled across the border— 
those are the consequences of those 
failures by the administration. 
Leaders in my State have constantly 
sought for the administration to take 
some action. This is a Federal responsi-
bility, not a State responsibility. They 
have asked for more staff, better re-
sources, and better policies to put an 
end to some of these pull factors. 
But the Biden administration has 
done nothing to make it better. I would 
argue that they have actually made it 
worse with policies like the non-
enforcement 
policy 
that 
Secretary 
Mayorkas issued months ago. 
Senator SINEMA—a Senator from an-
other border State and a Democrat— 
and I offered the Bipartisan Border So-
lutions Act, along with a Democrat and 
a Republican House Member, with the 
idea that if maybe we came up with a 
bipartisan, 
bicameral 
proposal, 
the 
Biden administration would say: Well, 
why don’t we start there? Why don’t we 
start the discussions there? 
Well, the Biden administration re-
fused to take any action, and the chair-
man of the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee here in the Senate has refused 
to even hold a hearing on that bill. 
Now, our Democratic colleagues may 
control all levers of government, but, 
for sure, that is a far cry from actually 
governing. Our colleagues can’t seem 
to accomplish the bare minimum, let 
alone craft policies that address the 
needs of families. 
Our colleagues seem to think that 
these partisan victories are the only 
way they can prove to voters that they 
know how to govern, but they got it 
backward, and they don’t have much to 
show for it. The reality is, our col-
leagues’ burning focus on partisan leg-
islation has kept them from achieving 
much of anything at all. 
Our colleagues have been so dis-
tracted by their own partisan ambi-
tions that they have allowed the Sen-
ate to skate from crisis to crisis with-
out meaningful action. 
I can only hope that our colleagues 
will recognize that what they have 
been doing is not working and engage 
in some sort of midcourse correction in 
the coming months. 
The truth is, our country deserves a 
government that works for the Amer-
ican people, not for just one political 
party or for any constituency within 
that political party, like the progres-
sive left. 
I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S596 
February 9, 2022 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from New Hampshire. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I 
would ask unanimous consent that the 
Senate resume consideration of the 
MacBride nomination until 6 p.m. and 
that at 6 p.m. the Senate vote on con-
firmation of the Baker and Lewis 
nominations. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the nomination. 
The bill clerk read the nomination of 
Neil Harvey MacBride, of Virginia, to 
be General Counsel for the Department 
of the Treasury. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. For the information 
of the Senate, we expect to line up to 
three additional votes this evening. 
Therefore, Senators should expect a se-
ries of up to five rollcall votes begin-
ning at 6 p.m. Senators are asked to 
vote from their desks after the first 
vote so we can move these along and 
not spend all night here. 
CONTINUING RESOLUTION 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I 
am actually on the floor to speak to a 
different issue, even though I think ex-
pediting votes is an important one, and 
I support that. 
But I am really here to highlight the 
negative consequences for our country 
of continuing to fund our government 
through continuing resolutions. 
One of the most basic constitutional 
duties of Congress is the appropriations 
process. The Nation relies on this body 
to provide Federal funds for programs 
that support national defense, small 
businesses, our border defenses, con-
servation of public lands, food assist-
ance for low-income families, and so 
much, much more. 
And as a long-serving Member of the 
Senate Appropriations Committee, I 
am extremely disappointed that Con-
gress is about to pass yet another CR 
that is going to take us to March 11, 
nearly 5 months past the start of the 
fiscal year. 
Now, on a positive note, I understand 
that there is a tentative agreement on 
top-line funding, so that we should 
have budget numbers for an omnibus 
that would fund the remainder of the 
fiscal year. And that is good news. But 
the 
fundamental 
problem 
remains; 
long-term CRs create uncertainty and 
inefficiencies inside and outside of the 
Federal Government. 
CRs prevent Agencies from issuing 
new grants or expanding programs. 
They curtail hiring and recruitment. 
And moreover, those who rely on gov-
ernment programs and Federal re-
sources—and 
that 
could 
be 
either 
SNAP recipients or defense contrac-
tors, but everyone is forced into a 
budgetary limbo. 
And simply put, when Congress re-
fuses to act, people can’t do their jobs, 
and this is especially true for our mili-
tary men and women who are serving. 
From Russia’s efforts to undermine 
democracies in Europe to China’s rap-
idly expanding sphere of influence, to 
the unpredictable threat of rogue ac-
tors like North Korea and Iran, the 
threats we face today are varied and 
numerous. And nothing hinders our na-
tional security more than funding our 
national priorities in piecemeal fash-
ion. 
Make no mistake, as we are engaged 
in this crisis right now in Europe, 
where Russia is on the borders of 
Ukraine, threatening to invade, we can 
bet that Vladimir Putin is watching 
our Congress to see if we can actually 
get an agreement to get a budget fund-
ed for the rest of this year. 
Recently, several of my colleagues 
from the Appropriations Subcommittee 
on Defense and the Armed Services 
Committee met with Marine Corps 
Commandant General Berger to discuss 
the challenges that are facing the Ma-
rines. 
The 
message 
from 
General 
Berger was clear: If we continue to 
fund our government through CRs, it 
will erode our military readiness, and 
it will cut training time and impede 
the maintenance processes we rely on 
to keep our soldiers safe. 
The impact of continued CRs on our 
military would be wide-ranging, and 
the negative effects would continue to 
ripple for years. And we had this expe-
rience since I have been here. In 2012 
and 2013, when we had the budget cliff, 
we saw what happened to our military. 
We saw readiness of our men and 
women in uniform erode. 
Thousands of pilot flight hours would 
be lost. Critical exercises within our 
national allies would be canceled. Our 
overall global presence diminished at a 
time in which our adversaries are seek-
ing to outcompete us in multiple thea-
ters. 
Aircraft like the brandnew KC–46 
tankers that we are so proud to have 
stationed at Pease Air National Guard 
Base in New Hampshire, they are such 
a point of pride. They are an invaluable 
strategic 
national 
asset, 
but 
they 
would spend more time on the ground 
rather than flying the missions that 
they were designed for. 
And submarines, the backbone of our 
nuclear deterrence and technological 
overmatch against our adversaries and, 
by the way, the ships that China is 
most concerned about, are an instantly 
recognizable symbol of American mili-
tary might and the values of our coun-
try, they would be sidelined due to 
maintenance disruptions. 
That would have significant impact 
not just for our readiness but also for 
places like the Portsmouth Naval Ship-
yard, which has as its responsibility 
the maintenance and repair of our at-
tack submarines. 
So what kind of a signal does it send 
to adversaries like Russia, as they con-
tinue amassing troops on the Ukrain-
ian border and threaten the stability of 
Europe, when we can’t get a budget? 
Long-term efforts to recruit and re-
tain the best and brightest to serve in 
our military would be undone as bonus 
and incentive pays are cut and overall 
end-strength 
numbers 
decrease 
by 
thousands. 
Military families would be forced to 
bear the burden of greater financial un-
certainty on top of the many sacrifices 
that they already make for our coun-
try. We would be left with a smaller, 
less capable force that is demoralized 
from pay cuts and forced to shoulder 
greater risks for their safety. 
Now, in addition to the harm to our 
servicemembers and military families, 
we would also be undermining the crit-
ical modernization efforts that we need 
to keep pace at a time when competi-
tors like China are experiencing tech-
nological breakthroughs. 
Just 8 months ago, I am sure we all 
remember that China tested an ad-
vanced hypersonic missile that was 
launched into space before reentering 
the atmosphere and nearly hitting its 
target. 
This test should serve as a wake-up 
call about the urgent threat that Chi-
na’s military breakthroughs pose. And 
if the U.S. research and development 
efforts are slowed down due to the con-
straints of operating under a con-
tinuing resolution, we will not be able 
to drive the innovation needed to keep 
pace with China, let alone regain a con-
vincing advantage. 
And make no mistake, Putin isn’t 
the only one watching to see if we can 
get a budget agreement in this Con-
gress. Xi is also watching from China. 
The development of our next-genera-
tion fighter to ensure we maintain air 
superiority in the air will be slowed. 
Our efforts to defend against cyber 
attacks that could cripple critical in-
frastructure or expose national secu-
rity secrets would be hamstrung. 
Simply put, for all the might and 
selfless service of our service men and 
women, we would be asking them to de-
fend us while tying their hands behind 
their backs simply because we in Con-
gress can’t find the courage of com-
promise. 
I would say to my colleague Senator 
CORNYN from Texas, who talked about 
the narrow focus of Democrats—who 
are in the majority in this body right 
now, 
very 
slim 
majority—worrying 
only about our own parochial interests, 
that this is an opportunity for us to 
work together. Let’s work across the 
aisle and see if we can’t find some 
agreement on budget that will get this 
done not just for the remaining months 
of this fiscal year but next year and 
the next year and the next year. 
China doesn’t just compete with us 
on military technology; China and our 
other economic competitors are pour-
ing resources into scientific and tech-
nological innovation. And if we want to 
sustain our global prosperity, global 
leadership, and national security, we 
cannot afford to be caught flatfooted. 
That is why last week the House of 
Representatives passed the America

February 9, 2022 
COMPETES Act, which is a companion 
to the Senate-passed U.S. Innovation 
and Competition Act, which passed the 
Senate months ago with a very strong 
bipartisan vote. 
These bills will soon be in con-
ference, and, if passed, they will bolster 
innovation and international trade, but 
the investments to meet the authoriza-
tions that are contained in these bills 
can’t be made under a continuing reso-
lution. 
I chair the Commerce, Justice, and 
Science and Related Agencies Appro-
priations Subcommittee, the CJS Sub-
committee. Our bipartisan CJS bill in-
cluded a $1 billion increase for the Na-
tional Science Foundation to keep pace 
with scientific discoveries that can 
power the economy in fields like artifi-
cial intelligence, quantum computing, 
microelectronics, and advanced com-
munications. 
Under a CR, we would forfeit the 
chance to fund 2,300 additional research 
and education grants that will support 
27,500 
more 
scientists, 
technicians, 
teachers, and students compared to fis-
cal year 2021. 
That means a lot of innovative re-
search projects, and therefore poten-
tially new discoveries, technology, and 
industries would never get started. It 
also would diminish our ability to 
train 
the 
next 
generation 
of 
innovators. 
It isn’t just the National Science 
Foundation; 
under 
a 
CR, 
NASA 
wouldn’t have the needed increases 
that will help us return humans to the 
Moon—the high ground that China is 
also eyeing. We will lose out on the op-
portunity to provide the Department of 
Commerce additional funding to build 
next-generation climate and weather 
satellites, help small- and medium- 
sized manufacturers, enforce export 
and trade laws, and invest in economic 
development. 
Furthermore, a CR would delay im-
plementation of the bipartisan infra-
structure bill. 
Last year, along with nine of our col-
leagues, we drafted the Infrastructure 
Investment and Jobs Act, which is bi-
partisan legislation to make historic 
investments in our Nation’s infrastruc-
ture. The legislation provides $550 bil-
lion in new Federal investment to re-
spond to the needs of the country, from 
rebuilding crumbling roads and bridges 
to providing clean drinking water and 
addressing harmful contaminants, to 
expanding broadband coverage to even 
the most rural parts of our country. 
The Senate passed that infrastructure 
bill by an overwhelmingly bipartisan 
vote of 69 to 30. 
When President Biden signed the In-
frastructure Investment and Jobs Act 
into law, it became the single biggest 
infrastructure investment in U.S. his-
tory. It is a once-in-a-lifetime oppor-
tunity for us to invest in this country. 
But if we continue with CRs, the imple-
mentation of this bipartisan infra-
structure law could be delayed. 
In addition, as a result of its flat ob-
ligation limitations, a CR would pre-
vent State departments of transpor-
tation from accessing higher amounts 
of formula funding provided by the 
highway trust fund. 
The CR would also prohibit new 
starts for new formula programs au-
thorized by the bipartisan infrastruc-
ture law, including the fiscal year 2022 
portion of the carbon reduction pro-
gram that supports emission-reducing 
transportation projects and the PRO-
TECT formula funding to States to 
support transportation infrastructure 
resiliency. 
Now, in addition to slowing meaning-
ful infrastructure investments, a CR 
also fails to address urgent needs in 
our communities. 
Americans want to be safe from 
international threats to our national 
and economic security, but more im-
portant, they want to be safe in their 
communities. Yet, in 2020, murders 
rose by 30 percent. 
The 
Senate 
Commerce-Justice- 
Science bill includes significant fund-
ing to help local police departments 
fight crime and put officers on the 
street. It also includes a new Commu-
nity Violence Intervention Initiative 
to implement strategies to reduce 
homicides and gun violence. But with a 
CR, we wouldn’t have funding for this 
promising strategy. 
We would also lose the chance to pro-
vide historic levels of funding for the 
Office on Violence Against Women. 
Today, it is particularly important be-
cause a bipartisan group of Senators 
will introduce a reauthorization of the 
Violence Against Women Act. But 
without a CJS appropriations bill, we 
can’t provide additional funding for the 
Sexual 
Assault 
Services 
Program, 
which is a formula grant released to 
States, Tribes, and other coalitions in 
order to provide support services like 
medical services, counseling, and crisis 
intervention for victims of sexual as-
sault, and we cannot start new pro-
grams like Restorative Justice, a grow-
ing area in criminal justice to repair 
and address the harm experienced by 
victims. 
Continuing to rely on last year’s 
funding levels and last year’s programs 
undermines our chances to improve our 
military readiness, to invest in our 
economy, and to address emerging 
challenges. 
This week, instead of enacting fund-
ing bills for the fiscal year that began 
on October 1, 2021, Congress will in-
stead extend the deadline again, pass-
ing another CR through March 11. Now, 
don’t get me wrong, I am glad we are 
continuing to keep the government 
open, and I understand that Senate 
leadership—Chairman LEAHY and Vice 
Chairman SHELBY, along with their 
House counterparts—has reached a ten-
tative agreement on total spending lev-
els to allow us to use the next month 
to finish our work and enact a remain-
ing year appropriations bill, but it is 
way past time to have made that hap-
pen. The American people deserve no 
less, and we need to do better next 
year. 
I yield the floor.

RUARY 14, 2018 
Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, it is 
hard to forget the 14th of February in 
the year 2018, when I was actually here 
in the U.S. Senate when news reports 
began to emerge that there had been a 
shooting at a school in South Florida, 
where I live. 
I was at the time—or I am still now, 
but at the time, all four of my kids 
were in school in South Florida, and as 
a parent, the first thing that flashes in 
your mind is, Where? Which schools 
was it? 
Fortunately, we were blessed by 
God’s grace that it was not any of the 
schools that my children were in, but, 
sadly, there were other Floridians on 
that day who were impacted in ways 
that I think will clearly forever change 
their lives, but I think it has also im-
pacted the Nation. 
It is now well known what happened 
on that terrible day, a day of complete 
horror that shocked the Nation, and 
today, we stop and remember those 
who lost their lives on that day and 
those whose bravery saved lives on 
that day. 
We have learned much since that day 
about the things that went wrong with 
law enforcement, with the FBI, with 
local authorities, and with the school 
district, and that work continues. The 
monster who committed this act is now 
facing the justice of the Florida court 
system and will soon be sentenced. 
But I wanted to spend the brief time 
we have to talk about it here today fo-
cusing on what has happened since that 
day and, in particular, the extraor-
dinary work of some of the parents of 
those children who lost their lives on 
that tragic day, because they have 
turned their pain into activism in ways 
that have had concrete and meaningful 
impact. 
One in particular is Max Schachter 
and his family, who, as they dove into 
this, realized that there was no place 
where school districts could go and 
learn about the best practices for how 
to safeguard a school or any facility, 
for that matter. Everyone was off 
doing their own thing, being pitched 
contracts and ideas by different compa-
nies that said: We can add this, and we 
can give you that. But there didn’t 
seem to be a single place where you 
could go and learn the best practices to 
ensure the safety of our students. 
That began to change because of his 
work. He lost a son, Alex, on that day, 
but from that pain, he has become a 
national leader on the issue of a Fed-
eral clearinghouse, which now exists. 
The 
previous 
administration, 
the 
Trump administration, took executive 
action on it. Today, there exists a

clearinghouse that I hope we can put 
into statute through the Luke and 
Alex School Safety Act to make it per-
manent. It has become a resource 
where schools across the country are 
now able to, on an ongoing, real-time 
basis, see whether what they have in 
place is the highest standard and the 
most effective. Every time there are 
improvements, it is updated. It has had 
a meaningful impact. There are schools 
across this country that had vulnera-
bilities they didn’t recognize. Those 
vulnerabilities aren’t just about phys-
ical hardening of buildings and so 
forth; it is about identifying and get-
ting ahead of these problems. 
Sadly, what we learned from many of 
these tragedies is that, well before that 
day, there are clear signs that some-
thing is about to happen. 
I think one of the things that most 
struck me is that multiple families 
told me that as soon as the news came 
out that this had happened, everyone 
knew who it was. Without even having 
heard the name, everyone knew who 
did it because the signs had been there 
and they had been missed. 
The ability of school districts to now 
recognize that and get ahead of it is 
just one of the many innovations that 
are now in place because of the work of 
Max and his family in honor of their 
son Alex and of all those who suffered 
greatly on that day. 
So I think it is important not just to 
obviously remember the extraordinary 
pain and horrific events of that mo-
ment but also to remember how these 
brave American families have since 
that day taken their pain and turned it 
into action and that today, across this 
country, many of our schools are bet-
ter positioned to prevent this from ever 
happening to anyone else because of 
what they have done with this tragedy. 
I wanted to take this moment today 
to commemorate and recognize their 
hard work and the work they and other 
families are doing not simply to raise 
awareness but to spur real, concrete 
action that makes a meaningful dif-
ference. 
I now want to turn it over to my col-
league from Florida, who was Governor 
on that terrible day and dealt with this 
all firsthand. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
SHAHEEN). The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, almost 4 years ago, on February 
14, 2018, the world witnessed a senseless 
attack at Marjory Stoneman Douglas 
High School in Parkland, FL. 
I am proud to join my colleague Sen-
ator RUBIO to introduce this resolution 
which honors the 17 victims of the 
tragic shooting: Alyssa Alhadeff, Scott 
Beigel, Martin Duque Anguiano, Nich-
olas 
Dworet, 
Aaron 
Feis, 
Jaime 
Guttenberg, Chris Hixon, Luke Hoyer, 
Cara Loughran, Gina Montalto, Joa-
quin Oliver, Alaina Petty, Meadow Pol-
lack, Helena Ramsay, Alex Schachter, 
Carmen Schentrup, and Peter Wang. 
I often think of these innocent lives 
who were lost way too early. They were 
sons, daughters, parents, and partners. 
Some were educators, athletes, musi-
cians; many of them, just kids with a 
life full of promise ahead of them. My 
heart breaks knowing that they will 
never get to pursue their dreams and 
that their families will always have a 
piece of their heart missing. 
Since that horrific day, I have 
worked closely with many of the vic-
tims’ families to ensure no family has 
to experience that again. 
While I was Governor, we passed the 
Marjory 
Stoneman 
Douglas 
High 
School Public Safety Act to make sure 
our State does everything possible to 
ensure this does not happen again. 
Now as a U.S. Senator, I am fighting 
for improvements on the Federal level, 
including the Luke and Alex School 
Safety Act, named after Luke Hoyer 
and Alex Schachter, which builds on 
our work to keep schools safe. 
I am also working with my col-
leagues to pass the bipartisan EAGLES 
Act, which improves school safety for 
our students and teachers and provides 
more resources to law enforcement to 
prevent future tragedies from hap-
pening. 
While, 
unfortunately, 
we 
cannot 
bring back the lives lost on that tragic 
day nearly 4 years ago, I will always 
work to honor them and do everything 
in my power to protect our students 
and educators and ensure they have a 
safe environment to learn and succeed. 
Madam President, as if in legislative 
session, I ask unanimous consent the 
Senate proceed to the consideration of 
S. Res. 508, which is at the desk. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The clerk will report the resolution 
by title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 508) honoring the 
memories of the victims of the senseless at-
tack at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High 
School on February 14, 2018. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolution. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent the res-
olution be agreed to, the preamble be 
agreed to, and that the motions to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table with no intervening ac-
tion or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The resolution (S. Res. 508) was 
agreed to. 
The preamble was agreed to. 
(The resolution, with its preamble, is 
printed in today’s RECORD under ‘‘Sub-
mitted Resolutions.’’) 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, I yield the floor.

FLOOR VOTES 
Mr. TILLIS. Madam President, I 
want to start by thanking my friend 
from the great State of New Hampshire 
for signing on to a letter I just want to 
briefly describe and send the letter to 
the desk. 
I send a letter to the desk which has 
been signed by seven Members of this 
body, and we expect several more to be 
added over the next day, if not this 
evening. 
Ladies and gentlemen, it is pretty 
simple. I was thinking that my mom is 
one of the few people who probably 
watches C–SPAN a lot when her son is 
on the floor. We have so many in-
stances where we have 90 or so Mem-
bers standing on the floor, looking at a 
door to the left or the right or the rear, 
wondering where that last Senator is 
who is holding the vote open. 
So, Mom, when I am on the floor and 
looking that way, it is because we have 
a Member who may be coming to vote 
or maybe not. 
What we have here is a situation 
where any one Member is able to hold 
the vote open. Out of respect for that 
Member—technically, the vote could be 
called after the time is called, but it is 
not out of respect for our Members. 
So what I have simply done is cir-
culate with my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle and say: How about 
this as a proposition: If you are the 
last Member to vote and your vote will 
not change the outcome, then instruct 
the desk and the Presiding Officer to 
simply call the vote. 
We had nearly 80 Members already 
agree that is a reasonable proposition, 
and every one of those Members has an 
opportunity on an exception basis to 
say: No, this vote is important to me; 
you have to hold it open. 
They could be caught in traffic. They 
could be coming from the airport—any 
number of valid reasons. 
There was a vote on this this after-
noon, and the reason I missed that vote 
was I am a ranking member of a sub-
committee, and the witnesses were just 
about to testify. I could have held the 
vote open or I could have been rude to 
the witnesses and left when they pre-
pared the testimony. I felt like it was 
more important to hear their testi-
mony. That vote, by the way, passed by 
a huge margin. That is an example 
where I am perfectly happy to show re-
spect to my colleagues, not hold the 
vote open, and move on. 
Tonight, we are going to have several 
votes stacked up, and invariably, we 
may have someone come in—I don’t 
think it is malicious, but they are un-
intentionally 
holding 
up 
the 
pro-
ceedings of this body. I think if we sim-
ply have them, their scheduler, their 
chief of staff, or anyone in their office 
simply say ‘‘The boss has to vote on 
this bill,’’ then they could call the 
cloakroom, and the vote could be held 
open, which is a tradition here. 
I want to thank Senator SHAHEEN, 
the Presiding Officer. I want to thank 
the 77 people who have signed on to 
this letter just to show that we want to 
do the work of the people, we want to 
do it in a timely manner, and we want

to show the utmost respect to the 
Members and to the staff who are also 
held up for sometimes no good reason. 
So this is a good step forward. It is a 
baby step. It is not a sea change. But I 
think we can change the behavior of 
the Senate by being mindful of how our 
actions can affect the proceedings on 
the floor and every one of our cal-
endars. 
So, again, Madam President, I send 
that letter to the desk. I have shared a 
copy of the letter with both cloak-
rooms. I will be sending a letter to Sen-
ator SCHUMER, who I understand will 
gladly accept it. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent to have the letter printed in 
the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
U.S. SENATE, 
Washington, DC, February 2, 2022. 
Hon. CHARLES E. SCHUMER, 
Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. MITCH MCCONNELL, 
Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MAJORITY LEADER SCHUMER AND MI-
NORITY LEADER MCCONNELL: As you know, 
despite our collective efforts to encourage 
Members to vote on the Senate floor in a 
timely manner, votes are often left open well 
beyond the allotted time, frustrating a ma-
jority of Members from both sides of the 
aisle. Often, the outcome of the vote is not 
in doubt. 
With this in mind and in order to expedite 
floor votes, we are instructing the Presiding 
Officer to close any vote in which: (a) one of 
the signatories below is the last remaining 
vote; and (b) the Member’s vote would not 
change the outcome. However, on any par-
ticular vote, if a signatory requests that the 
vote be held open, they may do so by pro-
viding notice to their Cloakroom.

TRIBUTE TO ANTHONY FAUCI 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, our 
history books are filled with the names 
of great men and women who devoted 
their lives to others. One who may not 
be as recognizable as others is Norman 
Borlaug. He was an American biologist. 
He successfully developed a strain of 
wheat that grew more quickly and was 
disease-resistant. His work to feed the 
hungry has been credited with saving a 
billion lives worldwide. 
Madame Marie Curie was a Polish 
chemist who is remembered for her dis-
covery of radium and polonium and her 
huge contribution toward finding a 
treatment for cancer. 
Of course, there are all the scientists 
throughout history who developed life-
saving vaccines: Edward Jenner, small-
pox vaccine; Louis Pasteur, rabies; Al-
bert Calmette, TB; Leila Denmark, 
whooping cough; Jonas Salk, polio. I 
might add Albert Sabin, too, because I 
was a kid and remember he came up 
with the oral version, which meant we 
didn’t have to get a shot. Kids remem-
ber that. 
These men and women will be re-
membered for improving and saving 
lives with their breakthroughs in medi-
cine, agriculture, and science. 
I want to nominate another person to 
be remembered in that same light. His 
name is Anthony Fauci. Born in 1940, 
Tony Fauci, the grandson of Italian 
immigrants, grew up a Yankees fan in 
Brooklyn. He was the captain of his 
high 
school 
basketball 
team. 
He 
worked construction jobs over breaks 
in the summer from school. 
He ultimately decided he wanted to 
pursue a career in medicine. Thank 
goodness he did. In 1972, Anthony Fauci 
accepted a senior researcher position 
at the National Institutes of Allergy 
and Infectious Diseases at the National 
Institutes of Health, and for the past 38 
years, Dr. Fauci has been the leader of 
that Institute. He has advised seven 
Presidents of both political parties. He 
has guided our Nation and the world 
through countless public health cri-
ses—SARS, avian influenza, swine flu, 
Zika, Ebola. 
Aside from his work against COVID– 
19, he is best known for his work on 
HIV/AIDS. Anthony Fauci’s tireless ef-
forts on HIV/AIDS, both domestically 
and worldwide, through the creation of 
PEPFAR, the President’s Emergency 
Plan for AIDS Relief, is the main rea-
son why HIV/AIDS is no longer a death 
sentence. 
Some of us can remember when HIV/ 
AIDS was first discovered. I can recall 
coming to vote in the House and some-
body stopping me on the sidewalk and 
saying: Did you hear Magic Johnson 
has AIDS? I can remember hearings in 
the House Budget Committee as a 
young Congressman when we thought 
it was a death sentence that we were 
all going to face eventually. There was 
ultimate panic in the air, but thank 
goodness there were talented people 
like Tony Fauci with the nerves of 
steel needed to confront that. 
Harold Varmus, a former NIH Direc-
tor, once said: 
PEPFAR has turned around declining life 
expectancies in many countries and likely 
saved some countries—even an entire con-
tinent—from economic ruin. 
Larry Kramer, a prominent and well- 
known AIDS activist who recently 
passed away, called Dr. Fauci ‘‘the 
only true and great hero’’ among gov-
ernment officials of the AIDS crisis. 
For his work on HIV/AIDS, Dr. Fauci 
was awarded the Presidential Medal of 
Freedom in 2008—our Nation’s highest 
civilian 
honor—from 
then-President 
George W. Bush, who called Dr. Fauci 
‘‘my hero.’’ 
Dr. Fauci has devoted his career and 
his life to improving public health. He 
has saved countless lives here and 
around the world. These days, he is 
working 18 hours a day, 7 days a week, 
shuttling from the NIH to the White 
House and back home. 
He is a classic example of American 
excellence, a brilliant scientific mind. 
Yet, despite all this, despite all that I 
have told you about this man, some 
Members of today’s Republican Party 
have chosen to make him a political 
target. They think attacking Dr. Fauci 
will cause us to forget the real history 
of COVID–19. 
You see, the Republican Party has 
consistently failed the American peo-
ple when it has come to COVID—from 
President Trump’s refusing to take it 
seriously, to the discouragement of 
mask-wearing and vaccines, to pro-
moting horse tranquilizers and bleach 
and bizarre theories as a cure. They 
have too little courage to face their 
communities and to do the hard work 
of governing during this public health 
crisis, so they have invented a political 
target, a convenient target, on which 
to focus their blame. 
Instead of addressing this public 
health crisis head on, they are trying 
to deflect and distract from it in at-
tacking Dr. Tony Fauci. They are, 
without evidence, suggesting the false 
narrative that Dr. Fauci secretly and 
purposely funded illicit research that 
caused this virus. They are even criti-
cizing his government salary, for good-
ness’ sakes. 
He accrued that salary, I might re-
mind them, over four decades of public 
service, as though he wouldn’t make 
twice or three times that amount in 
the private sector today. They are 
questioning his financials and ties to 
the drug industry, even though he has 
made every requested document avail-
able, and no malfeasance or conflicts 
have been found. 
So why do they do this? Why are they 
determined to run this man down? Why 
would they attack this public servant 
who is working around the clock to 
keep us safe?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S600 
February 9, 2022 
It is because it is much easier to ma-
lign a person than it is to do the hard 
work of enacting policies to tackle this 
virus and keep America healthy. Their 
distractions have sunk so low that they 
are using these attacks to raise money 
for their political campaigns. 
We have Republican candidates, from 
Ohio to Florida, who are running ads 
entitled, ‘‘Fire Fauci,’’ who are prom-
ising to subpoena him and reduce his 
salary to zero if it is within their 
power, who are selling ‘‘Freedom over 
Fauci Flip-Flops,’’ which comes from 
none other than the Governor of Flor-
ida. A few of my Senate Republican 
colleagues 
have 
loaded 
up 
their 
websites with anti-Fauci fervor, con-
veniently located next to a ‘‘donate 
here’’ option. 
We have FOX News’ anchors and 
podcast comedians giving air time to 
anti-vaxxers who are hoping to get 
their 15 minutes of fame by leveling 
baseless claims against Dr. Fauci, base-
less claims that have resulted in death 
threats and harassment against Dr. 
Fauci, his wife, and his children. 
Let me ask you this: What have Dr. 
Fauci’s most vocal critics done to ad-
vance the cause of public health? 
Nothing. They have done nothing. 
Worse than that, their lies about Dr. 
Fauci and about COVID are creating a 
toxic political environment that is lit-
erally killing people, as 900,000 Ameri-
cans have now died from COVID. Some 
of these deaths could have been pre-
vented with vaccinations. 
Americans who are unvaccinated— 
listen to this; the Presiding Officer 
knows it—are 97 times more likely to 
die from COVID than their vaccinated 
and boosted counterparts—97 times 
more likely to die. Yet, instead of 
spending their time encouraging vac-
cinations and promoting other proven, 
legitimate public health measures that 
would end this pandemic, many in the 
Republican Party want to get their 5 or 
10 minutes of Sun on FOX TV, and they 
spend their time attacking Dr. Fauci. 
These attacks are a shameful fraud, 
and for what—to fundraise? to win an-
other guest appearance on FOX? 
Working in politics, you get used to a 
lot of things—grandstanding, dema-
goguery, hypocrisy—but what some of 
my Republican colleagues are doing to 
Dr. Fauci is the lowest form of polit-
ical life. They are lying about someone 
who has devoted his life to saving peo-
ple—saving AIDS patients, containing 
and eradicating Ebola, preventing the 
spread of Zika and the avian flu. He is 
someone who has worked harder than 
anyone to end this COVID pandemic. 
David Relman, a microbiologist who 
has advised the U.S. Government for 
years on biological threats, said this of 
Dr. Fauci: 
Nobody is a more tireless champion of the 
truth and the facts . . . I am not entirely 
sure what we would do without him. 
Dr. Fauci’s name is—and deserves to 
be—listed alongside our world’s great-
est scientific minds. History will re-
serve another place for those who lied 
about him for their own gain—inciting 
hatred, prolonging this pandemic, and 
contributing to needless pain and suf-
fering. 
America is blessed to have the talent, 
dedication, and compassion of Anthony 
Fauci in the midst of this deadly pan-
demic. 
I ask unanimous consent to have 
printed in the RECORD an article from 
The Washington Post, entitled, ‘‘An-
thony Fauci is up against more than a 
virus,’’ after these remarks. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[Jan. 27, 2022] 
ANTHONY FAUCI IS UP AGAINST MORE THAN A 
VIRUS 
(By Dan Zak and Roxanne Roberts) 
Two years into the pandemic, the threats 
and vitriol have not stopped. And the many 
Americans who still trust him are exhausted. 
The doctor opens the front door. Never 
mind introductions. ‘‘I know who you are. Do 
you think these guys would let you get this 
close to me, if we didn’t know who you are?’’ 
Across the street is a security agent in 
Nikes, a badge on his belt. He’s not the only 
one watching. 
‘‘I mean, isn’t it amazing?’’ the doctor 
says. ‘‘Here I am, with cameras around my 
house.’’ 
The house is modest for Washington: stuc-
co and brick, cozy and cramped. No obvious 
tokens of celebrity or esteem. Icicles on the 
dormant hot tub out back. Bottles of red 
wine and olive oil on the kitchen counter. 
‘‘It’s messy because, as you know, in covid 
times, nobody comes over. So nobody cares.’’ 
People are coming by outside, though. 
They are snapping photos. Two years into 
the pandemic Anthony Fauci remains the 
face of America’s covid response, and on this 
cold Saturday in January thousands of 
marchers are descending on the capital to 
rally against vaccine mandates. Are some of 
them staking out his home? 
The security agents ‘‘usually leave at a 
certain time,’’ the doctor says. ‘‘But tonight 
they’re going to sleep in our guest room.’’ 
Year 3 of covid times. Nearly 900,000 Amer-
icans are dead. An average of 2,000 (mostly 
unvaccinated) Americans are dying every 
day now, even though there is a simple meas-
ure to limit such suffering—made possible in 
large part by the Vaccine Research Center 
founded under Fauci. And yet many Ameri-
cans would rather take their chances with a 
virus than a vaccine, because there’s more 
than just a virus going around. There’s 
something else in the air. Symptoms include 
rage, delusion, opportunism and extreme be-
havior—like comparing Fauci to Nazi doctor 
Josef Mengele (as Lara Logan did on Fox 
News in November), or setting out for Wash-
ington with an AR–15 and a kill list of ‘‘evil’’ 
targets that included Fauci (as a California 
man did last month). 
‘‘Surrealistic,’’ the doctor says. 
He has not had a day off since the begin-
ning. ‘‘I would say I’m in a state of chronic 
exhaustion.’’ He quickly adds: ‘‘But it’s not 
exhaustion that’s interfering with my func-
tion.’’ He is a precise man whose tour in the 
information war has made him extra-vigi-
lant about his words. ‘‘I can just see, you 
know, Laura Ingraham: ‘He’s exhausted! Get 
rid of him!’ ’’ 
Fauci has been a doctor and public servant 
for more than 50 years. He’s been the coun-
try’s top expert on infectious diseases under 
seven U.S. presidents. George H.W. Bush 
once called him his personal hero. Under 
George W. Bush, Fauci became an architect 
of an AIDS-relief program that has, accord-
ing to the U.S. government, saved 21 million 
lives around the world. 
He knows how a virus works. He knows 
how Washington works. He thought he knew 
how people worked, too—even ones who 
called him a murderer, as AIDS activists did 
decades ago because they felt left for dead by 
a neglectful government. Back then the 
angry people were motivated by truth and 
science. Fauci had something to learn from 
them, and they had something to learn from 
him. The shared mission was pursuing facts 
and saving lives. Fear and uncertainty could 
be eased by data and collaboration. Combat-
ants, however scared or passionate, shared a 
reality. 
Now? 
‘‘There is no truth,’’ Fauci says, for effect. 
‘‘There 
is 
no 
fact.’’ 
People 
believe 
hydroxychloroquine works because an Inter-
net charlatan claims it does. People believe 
the 2020 election was stolen because a former 
president says so. People believe that Fauci 
killed millions of people for the good of his 
stock portfolio because it’s implied by TV 
pundits, Internet trolls and even elected 
leaders. Fauci is unnerved by ‘‘the almost in-
comprehensible culture of lies’’ that has 
spread among the populace, infected major 
organs of the government, manifested as 
ghastly threats against him and his family. 
His office staff, normally focused on commu-
nicating science to the public, has been con-
scripted into skirmishes over conspiracy 
theories and misinformation. 
‘‘It is very, very upending to live through 
this,’’ Fauci says, seated at his kitchen table 
in the midwinter light. He pauses. ‘‘I’m try-
ing to get the right word for it.’’ He is exam-
ining himself now, at 81, in the shadow of the 
past two years. ‘‘It has shaken me a bit.’’ 
The way he can comprehend the situation 
is in the context of the Jan. 6, 2021, siege of 
the Capitol. There it was, on live TV, an ex-
periment as clear as day: The abandonment 
of truth has seismic consequences. 
Something has been replicating in the 
American mind. It is not microbial. It can-
not be detected by nasal swab. To treat an 
affliction, you must first identify it. But you 
can’t slide a whole country into an MRI ma-
chine. 
‘‘There’s no diagnosis for this,’’ Fauci says. 
‘‘I don’t know what is going on.’’ 
A virus is a terrifying force that hijacks 
civilization. A bureaucracy, intricate yet im-
perfect, is what we have to take back con-
trol. For better and worse, Fauci became the 
personification of both. He has been sainted 
and satanized over the past two years, since 
he 
first 
fact-checked 
President 
Donald 
Trump. His inbox is a cascade of hosannas 
and go-to-hells. His days often start at 5 a.m. 
His nights are fitful. What more could he 
have done today? What fresh horror awaits 
tomorrow? He is fighting for a best-case sce-
nario, urging preparation for the worst, and 
fretting that nothing will ever be good 
enough. 
‘‘I do worry about him,’’ says Francis Col-
lins, until recently the director of the Na-
tional Institutes of Health. ‘‘He’s incredibly 
frustrated’’ by the attacks ‘‘because it’s a 
distraction. But there is no part of Tony 
Fauci that’s ready to give up on a problem 
just because it’s hard.’’ 
‘‘Being two years into this, and being at 
the tip of the spear—it takes a certain per-
son to be able to persevere through that,’’ 
says Michael T. Osterholm, director of the 
Center for Infectious Disease Research and 
Policy at the University of Minnesota. ‘‘It’s 
almost like asking someone to run a mara-
thon every day of their life.’’ 
‘‘He’s always had complete bipartisan sup-
port, up until covid,’’ says AIDS activist

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S601 
February 9, 2022 
Peter Staley, who once picketed NIH and is 
now a dear friend of Fauci’s. ‘‘It’s flat-Earth 
time. Nothing makes sense. This is a guy 
who tries to let science dictate what he says 
and does. Now they’re turning what is a pris-
tine record into something evil. They lie, 
and repeat the lie 100 times until people 
think it’s true.’’ 
Staley calls Fauci multiple times a week 
to check in, ask him how he’s doing, discuss 
the covid response and the resistance to it. 
‘‘What do I tell him?’’ Staley says. ‘‘What 
kind of advice do I give him to win that war? 
It’s 
very 
frustrating. 
It’s 
almost 
unwinnable.’’ 
Look at Fauci’s Jan. 11 appearance before 
the Senate Health Committee. Sen. Richard 
Burr (R–N.C.) chided Fauci and other offi-
cials for spreading ‘‘skepticism and mass 
confusion’’ with mixed messaging on covid 
guidelines. A harsh but fair criticism. Then 
two senators—who each happen to have med-
ical degrees—got personal. 
‘‘You are the lead architect for the re-
sponse from the government, and now 800,000 
people have died,’’ said Sen. Rand Paul (R– 
Ky.). 
Fauci scolded Paul that such an ‘‘irrespon-
sible’’ statement ‘‘kindles the crazies.’’ ‘‘I 
have threats upon my life, harassments of 
my family,’’ Fauci said, suggesting that the 
California man targeted him because he 
‘‘thinks that maybe I’m killing people.’’ 
For years, Fauci had joked that his per-
sonal philosophy comes from ‘‘The God-
father’’: ‘‘It’s not personal; it’s strictly busi-
ness.’’ The business is science. Science 
helped him cure vasculitis. Science helped 
him and others transform HIV from a death 
sentence to a condition managed by a pill. 
What he was facing now felt like it had 
nothing to do with science. 
Later in the hearing, Sen. Roger Marshall 
(R–Kan.) displayed a giant prop paycheck de-
picting Fauci’s $400,000-plus salary. Marshall 
accused Fauci and ‘‘Big Tech’’ of hiding his 
financial investments, which created an ‘‘ap-
pearance that maybe some shenanigans are 
going on.’’ 
Fauci, bewildered and incensed, replied 
that his assets, which he had disclosed for 
decades, were available to the public. (While 
this statement was technically true, his dis-
closures were not just a Google search away; 
after the hearing, Marshall’s office requested 
and received the documents from NIH, then 
declared that Fauci ‘‘lied’’ about the ease of 
their availability.) 
When Marshall finished his questioning, 
Fauci let his frustration get the better of 
him. ‘‘What a moron,’’ he muttered to him-
self, not intending it for the microphone. 
What was going on here? Senators were 
‘‘trying to troll Fauci, and they’re trying to 
bring him down to their level,’’ says Mat-
thew Sheffield, a former conservative activ-
ist who now runs a political commentary 
website called Flux.community. ‘‘They know 
if they can get him to call people a moron, 
or engage in pettiness the way that they en-
gage in pettiness constantly—if he does it 
even once, then it’s a victory for them.’’ 
Paul disputes this characterization and 
claims that Fauci deserves ‘‘some culpa-
bility’’ for the pandemic because a grant 
from his agency funded research in a lab in 
Wuhan, the Chinese city where the novel 
coronavirus was first detected. (The exact 
origins of the virus remain unknown. Sci-
entific consensus points to an animal-to- 
human transfer, but the debate is ongoing.) 
Marshall’s office did not have comment on 
Sheffield’s theory. After the hearing, the 
senator’s campaign website did start selling 
$29 T-shirts, featuring the doctor’s likeness, 
to commemorate the moment: ‘‘Send Fauci a 
message by getting your own ‘MORON’ t- 
shirt!’’ 
The way in which the United States funds 
and manages science provides a solid founda-
tion for skepticism and conspiracy, says Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania professor Kathleen 
Hall Jamieson, who studies science commu-
nication and misinformation. 
Yes, scientific recommendations change 
based on available data, a truth that can be 
exploited to make responsible leaders appear 
inconsistent or incompetent. 
Yes, Fauci has a high salary by govern-
ment standards, has been in the same 
unelected position for 38 years and oversees 
a budget of $6 billion that flows into grants; 
those are truths on which a distrusting per-
son could build a theory about corruption, 
unaccountable elites and a nefarious flow of 
money from this or that institution to this 
or that lab. 
Yes, the virus seems unaccountable to our 
best efforts and fueled by our worst in-
stincts. Yes, the ways it has ended and up-
ended people’s lives have been undeserved, 
tragic, crazy-making. These are scary truths 
that you can neutralize with a fantasy about 
how a single human villain is to blame. 
The attacks and misinformation seem to 
be having an effect. Confidence in Fauci is 
softening, according to polling conducted 
since April by the Annenberg Public Policy 
Center. After holding steady last summer 
and autumn, the percentage of Americans 
who are confident that Fauci provides trust-
worthy information about COVID–19 is down 
six points since April, from 71 to 65 percent. 
‘‘For the first time in my lifetime—and I 
am an elderly woman—the voice that speaks 
on behalf of the best available knowledge in 
science has weathered sustained attack,’’ 
says Jamieson, director of the policy center. 
‘‘Confidence [in Fauci] remains high despite 
that attack, but the erosion is worrisome.’’ 
With Trump long gone from the White 
House and public exhaustion with pre-
cautions surging alongside the omicron vari-
ant, Fauci may now be more useful to the 
pundits who need a villain than those who 
need a hero. ‘‘Fauci must go,’’ the editors of 
the conservative National Review demanded 
this month. ‘‘I’m over COVID,’’ talk-show 
host Bill Maher told Deadline before his 
show last week. His guest, author Bari 
Weiss, echoed the frustration of millions: We 
were told ‘‘you get the vaccine and you get 
back to normal. And we haven’t gotten back 
to normal.’’ 
‘‘The stalwart Fauci was the wise Oracle of 
Delphi to then-President Donald Trump’s 
babbling brook about household bleach as an 
injectable, anti-viral agent,’’ Washington 
Post columnist Kathleen Parker wrote this 
week. 
‘‘Maybe it’s my imagination,’’ she contin-
ued, ‘‘but Fauci appears less confident of 
late, perhaps weary of his own voice and ex-
hausted by two years of on-camera appear-
ances.’’ 
Sen. Marshall exaggerated this erosion 
during the Jan. 11 hearing. ‘‘You’ve lost your 
reputation,’’ he told Fauci, adding: ‘‘The 
American people don’t trust the words com-
ing out of your mouth.’’ 
‘‘That’s a real distortion of the reality,’’ 
Fauci answered. 
Marshall replied with a truth from the 
world outside of medical science: ‘‘Percep-
tion is reality.’’ 
Fauci is not naive. He gets that a third of 
the country won’t hear him. He still under-
stands Washington enough to see how it is 
deteriorating in new and disturbing ways, as 
fringe thinking spreads to the central or-
gans. As Peter Staley puts it: ‘‘Because one 
party has turned so anti-science, Tony’s 
power is no longer stable.’’ 
Yet Fauci still thinks he is an effective 
messenger. And he still hasn’t totally given 
up on the people who are making his life 
miserable. After the exchange with Marshall, 
and a news cycle dominated by ‘‘moron’’ in-
stead of ‘‘omicron,’’ Fauci told his own in-
credulous staff: Maybe the senator has a 
point. Maybe my financial investments, 
though disclosed and available, should be 
much easier to see. 
As for the citizens who wish him harm, he 
can’t help but search for some signal, some 
symptom, that could help him understand. 
‘‘I’m always looking for the good in people, 
that kernel of something that’s positive,’’ 
Fauci says. ‘‘And it’s tough to imagine that 
that many people are bad people. And, I 
mean, it’s just—has something been smol-
dering in their lives? Something that’s socio-
logically evasive to me?’’ 
He wonders: Does their resentment indi-
cate an underlying issue that needs—for lack 
of a better term—healing? 
‘‘Maybe it’s pain that they’re feeling, 
that’s driving it?’’ he says, as if bedside with 
a patient. ‘‘And we’re focusing on the aber-
rancy of their actions, but we really are not 
fully appreciating that maybe they’re suf-
fering. And they’re rebelling against a fail-
ing of society, maybe, to address some of 
their needs. Maybe we need, as a nation, to 
address the fundamental issues that are get-
ting, you know, tens of millions of people to 
feel a certain way.’’ 
On Sunday, in front of the Lincoln Memo-
rial, thousands of people rallied against vac-
cine mandates. Fauci’s name was scrawled 
on many signs. The rhetoric was familiar. 
‘‘Dr. Fauci is the new Jeff Mengele from 
World War II,’’ said a Long Island construc-
tion worker named Gio Nicolson, who de-
scribed Fauci as both ‘‘puppet’’ and ‘‘dic-
tator.’’ A 57-year-old woman named Robin 
Field drove three hours from Yorktown, Va., 
to hold up a homemade sign that depicted 
Fauci’s decapitated head in a noose, under 
the words ‘‘HANG EM HIGH.’’ 
Fauci is guilty of treason, according to 
Field. She’s done her own research, she says, 
and it’s clear that his recommendations have 
both ‘‘killed people’’ and made him money. 
The violence of her sign, though—where is 
that coming from? At a primal level, it 
seems to convey pain or fear. 
‘‘Of co—’’ Field starts, then stops. ‘‘Well 
. . .’’ 
How would she put it? 
‘‘I feel so bad that so many people have 
lost their lives. That hurts, because we all 
have loved ones that have touched our hearts 
and passed away.’’ 
Almost no one alive has experienced this 
kind of sudden mass death, this level of wide-
spread illness, this freezing and fracturing of 
all life. It hurts. For much of the 1980s, every 
single one of Fauci’s AIDS patients died. 
Ugly deaths that he was powerless to pre-
vent. He had to suppress the pain and bury 
the emotion to get through each day. When 
he recalls that era, his eyes water and his 
throat constricts. His self-diagnosis is a 
quick aside (‘‘post-traumatic stress’’) as he 
bridges the past and the present. In the mid-
dle of a cataclysm, it’s hard to see the end. 
But it does end. 
‘‘As a society, when we get out of this, you 
know, we’re going to look up and say, ‘Oh, 
my goodness, what we’ve been through,’ ’’ he 
says. ‘‘We’ve had an outbreak where we’ve 
lost close to 900,000 people in the last two 
years. That’s going to have a long-lasting ef-
fect.’’ 
In the early ’70s, when he was chief resi-
dent in a Manhattan hospital, Fauci remem-
bers glancing out over the East River in the 
middle of the night, ‘‘Saying, you know, I’m 
tired, but I can’t stop until at least this pa-
tient is stabilized.’’ When he was the main 
attending physician at NIH during the AIDS 
crisis, he wouldn’t leave the ward until he 
addressed every patient need. Now he views

the entire country as his patient—a patient 
afflicted by both a virus and an undiagnosed 
condition that hampers its ability to fight it. 
He could spare himself further pain and ex-
haustion and allow America to see another 
doctor. He could tag out. 
‘‘That’s not my character,’’ he says. ‘‘I 
don’t do that.’’ 
The patient, you see, is not stabilized yet. 
Fauci stares out the kitchen window into 
his small backyard. Right now he sees a 
crossroads for America. The best-case sce-
nario: increased vaccination, more immu-
nity, antiviral drugs, a virus under control. 
If we work together. The worst: a new vari-
ant, as transmissible as omicron but more 
deadly, exacerbated by that comorbidity— 
the deterioration of our minds and politics. 
‘‘It’s like it’s 2 o’clock in the morning, and 
I’m looking out the window at the East 
River,’’ Fauci says, ‘‘and I got a patient 
who’s bleeding, and another patient has a 
myocardial infarction, and another patient 
who has septicemia—’’ 
The sense memory prompts a sort of pep 
talk for the present. 
‘‘There’s no time to be exhausted, folks. 
You got a job to do.’’ 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I 
yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that the 
order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
TITLE IX 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Madam Presi-
dent, in my 40 years as a coach and 
mentor, I have witnessed the immeas-
urable value that sports plays in the 
lives of young adults. 
The lessons learned on the field con-
tribute to an athlete’s success off the 
field. For example, there is the value of 
discipline and hard work, how to deal 
with success and failure, how to be a 
leader, and the importance of putting 
the interests of the team ahead of the 
individual’s. But many of these lessons 
are only realized when there is a fair 
and level playing field, and that is why 
title IX protections have been so trans-
formational for women’s and girls’ 
sports. 
I began my career as a high school 
coach, coaching boys’ basketball and 
football, as well as girls’ basketball. 
This was just a few years after Con-
gress expanded title IX, ushering in a 
new era of opportunities for women and 
girls in sports. 
Title IX provided women and girls 
the long-denied platform that had al-
ways been afforded to men and boys. It 
ensured female athletes had the same 
access to funding, facilities, and ath-
letic scholarships. Before title IX, fe-
male athletics received less than 2 per-
cent of the college athletic budgets, 
and athletic scholarships for women 
were virtually nonexistent. Since it 
was enacted, I have witnessed firsthand 
how the expanded provisions in title IX 
have changed the game for female ath-
letes at every level. 
Today, 43 percent of high school girls 
participate 
in 
competitive 
sports. 
Since the 1970s, when I first started 
coaching, female participation at the 
college level has risen by more than 600 
percent. Additionally, America’s fe-
male athletes are routinely the best- 
performing on the world stage in both 
team and individual sports. 
In the 2016 Olympics, we saw the 
largest number of U.S. female Olym-
pians in history. It is clear we have 
made important strides. Yet, recently, 
the adoption of policies for transgender 
athletes has negatively impacted the 
rights, privacy, safety, and achieve-
ments of women and girls in sports. 
That is why we need to continue to 
fight to uphold and preserve title IX 
protections 
in 
women’s 
and 
girls’ 
sports. 
This is a cause I have championed in 
my role on the Senate Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions Com-
mittee. When then-nominee for Under 
Secretary of the U.S. Department of 
Education, James Kvaal, testified be-
fore the committee, I pressed on the 
administration’s commitment to up-
holding title IX and protecting the 
rights of women. As expected, he failed 
to articulate how title IX would be pro-
tected under the Biden administration. 
In March of last year, when Senate 
Democrats were pushing through their 
so-called COVID relief package, I led 
the charge here on this floor to pro-
hibit education institutions from re-
ceiving Federal stimulus money if they 
failed to uphold title IX. Not surpris-
ingly, it was rejected. 
But this is not just a debate we are 
having here in Congress; we are seeing 
it all across the country. To appease 
the demands of the left, sports organi-
zations—from grade school to profes-
sional leagues—are focusing on the 
concept of being inclusive at the ex-
pense of being fair, but by including bi-
ological males in women’s athletics, 
fairness is not possible. I can’t believe 
we are even talking about this. 
Just last week, I heard from female 
Olympic gold medalists who reiterated 
this, and study after study continues to 
confirm what we already know: Male 
and female bodies have inherent bio-
logical differences that no amount of 
testosterone 
suppression 
can 
level. 
Male bodies have larger hearts, bigger 
bone structure, leaner muscles, and ex-
panded lung capacity. 
One study concludes: ‘‘On average, 
males have 40–50 percent greater upper 
limb strength, 20–40 percent greater 
lower limb strength, and an average of 
12 pounds more skeletal muscle mass 
than age-matched females at any given 
body weight.’’ 
The latest study published by clinical 
researchers in Europe finds that ‘‘cur-
rent evidence shows the biological ad-
vantage is only minimally reduced 
when testosterone is suppressed as per 
current 
sporting 
guidelines 
for 
transgender athletes.’’ 
You can’t make a level playing field. 
It is unquestionably the truth that bio-
logical males have a physiological ad-
vantage over females, and sports asso-
ciations across the world are starting, 
finally, to pay attention. 
In 2019, USA Powerlifting prohibited 
transgender women from competing in 
female powerlifting. In 2020, World 
Rugby became the first international 
sports 
governing 
body 
to 
ban 
transgender women in global competi-
tions. Just last September, the UK 
Sports Councils—the national funding 
bodies for sports across the United 
Kingdom—issued a report concluding 
that allowing transgender athletes to 
compete in women’s sports does not 
allow for a balanced and even playing 
field—forbidden. These organizations 
are doing the research and making rec-
ommendations in the best interests of 
their athletes while also maintaining 
fairness in sports. 
But then there is the NCAA, better 
known as the National Collegiate Ath-
letic Association. After a transgender 
collegiate swimmer began shattering— 
and I am talking about shattering— 
records in swimming just in the last 
few weeks, the public outcry was so 
loud that the NCAA said: Well, we will 
review this policy. 
The NCAA met, and the board voted 
in support of a sport-by-sport policy 
that they say ‘‘preserve opportunity 
for transgender student-athletes while 
balancing fairness, inclusion and safety 
for all who compete.’’ 
In effect, this means they will defer 
the policy to individual national gov-
erning bodies and kick the can down 
the road. These governing bodies, in 
turn, generally adhere to the standards 
of the International Olympic Com-
mittee, which permits transgender ath-
letes to compete in women’s sports. 
The Independent Women’s Law Cen-
ter and Independent Women’s Forum 
both have condemned the NCAA for 
adopting this approach. The NCAA had 
the perfect opportunity to stand up for 
women and girls in sports, and they 
blew it. 
The NCAA’s lack of true action is 
disappointing and invites more ques-
tions than it provides answers. By 
punting the responsibility, the NCAA 
leaves the door open for continued ero-
sion of title IX protections at the ex-
pense of women’s athletics and con-
tinues to chip away at the great unifier 
that Americans know and love. We 
need to do better for women athletes 
all across this country. 
So let me be clear. The question here 
is not should we be inclusive and sup-
portive of all athletes; it is how. There 
is no pregame speech you can give a 
woman or a girl who feels like they 
aren’t competing on a fair playing 
field. No pep talk can touch title IX’s 
37 words that changed everything for 
women’s sports over 50 years ago. It 
rightfully afforded women and girls the 
same athletic opportunities that their 
male counterparts have always had, 
and we should continue to fight for all 
the young girls and the future of this 
country. 
I yield the floor.

ator from Maryland.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S603 
February 9, 2022 
SUPREME COURT NOMINATION 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, arti-
cle II, section 2, clause 2 of the Con-
stitution provides that the President 
‘‘shall nominate, and by and with the 
Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall 
appoint . . . judges of the Supreme 
Court.’’ 
One of the most important constitu-
tional responsibilities I have as a Sen-
ator is to provide advice and consent 
on a President’s Supreme Court nomi-
nee. A new Justice is someone who 
could serve for a generation or more 
and have a profound impact on the 
lives of all Americans for decades to 
come. 
Recently, 
Supreme 
Court 
Justice 
Stephen Breyer announced that he 
would step down once the Senate con-
firms his successor. In his remarks, 
while reflecting on what he learned 
during his nearly three decades on the 
High Court, he said: 
This is a complicated country. There are 
more than 330 million people, and my mother 
used to say it’s every race, it’s every reli-
gion—and she would emphasize this—and it’s 
every point of view possible. 
Justice Breyer has built a reputation 
and cemented a legacy as a champion 
of civil rights and fought to protect 
American consumers and our very 
democratic system of government from 
the attempts to undermine our cam-
paign finance system and weaken the 
sacred franchise of the right to vote. 
His thoughtful scholarship on the im-
portance of safeguarding human rights 
and respecting international law will 
continue to influence democratic gov-
ernments around the world for years to 
come. 
When I think about a successor to 
Justice Breyer, I want to see someone 
who can serve as a strong and thought-
ful presence on a Court that is tasked 
with some of the most complicated 
legal problems and questions in our Na-
tion. Each new Justice is someone who 
could serve for a generation or more 
and have a profound impact on the 
lives of all Americans for decades to 
come. 
The Supreme Court will make deci-
sions on a broad range of issues, such 
as voting rights, healthcare, women’s 
reproductive freedoms, equal rights for 
women, climate change policy, gun 
safety, campaign finance, civil rights 
issues, and so much more. A nominee 
should represent the values of our Con-
stitution in such a way that allows us 
to expand, not restrict, the civil rights 
of all Americans and keep powerful 
special interests and corporations in 
check. 
The U.S. Constitution is not a perfect 
document, but its authors designed a 
system of government around the rule 
of law and protection from abuses of 
power. Abuses could come from special 
interests or the government itself. Our 
Constitution 
created 
the 
Supreme 
Court of the United States as the pro-
tector of our constitutional rights. 
A Justice should have a healthy re-
spect for the separation of powers and 
checks and balances in our constitu-
tional system. A nominee should strive 
to safeguard the independence of the 
judiciary and protect the prerogatives 
of each branch of government, includ-
ing Congress and its duly-enacted laws. 
A strong nominee must be respectful of 
the diversity of the American experi-
ence and live up to his or her constitu-
tional oath to uphold the Constitution 
and laws of the United States, as well 
as their judicial oath to ‘‘administer 
justice without respect to persons, and 
do equal right to the poor and to the 
rich.’’ 
Thus far, 115 Justices have served in 
our Nation’s history, including Balti-
more’s own Thurgood Marshall, who 
was the first Black Supreme Court Jus-
tice. It is long past time to improve di-
versity on our Nation’s Court, which 
promises ‘‘equal justice under the law’’ 
to all those who enter its hollowed 
chambers. The Supreme Court and its 
Justices should look more like the 
America it serves in both its demo-
graphic and professional diversity. 
Madam President, I know you are 
aware that of the 115 Justices who have 
served throughout the history of the 
United States on the Supreme Court, 
108 of those 115 are White males. We 
need greater diversity in our courts, 
and we need greater diversity on the 
Supreme Court of the United States. 
In Maryland, for years, I have worked 
diligently when vacancies arise to rec-
ommend highly qualified lawyers to 
the President who will better diversify 
our Federal bench. Our Federal district 
court in Maryland consists of 10 active 
district court judges who sit in Balti-
more and Greenbelt. I am proud that 
our court reflects the breadth and 
depth of the demographic and profes-
sional diversity in Maryland, including 
the first Black woman to serve as a 
Federal judge in Maryland and the first 
Asian-American 
Federal 
judge 
in 
Maryland. 
Half of the active district judges in 
our State are now women. I chuckle 
when I recall the late Supreme Court 
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s com-
ment on how many women should be 
on the Supreme Court, as she was only 
the second female Justice in the 
Court’s history. This is her quote: 
When I’m sometimes asked ‘When will 
there be enough [women on the Supreme 
Court]?’ and I say ‘When there are nine,’ peo-
ple are shocked. But there’d been nine men, 
and nobody’s [even] raised a question about 
that. 
Our Federal judges in Maryland come 
from a wide variety of legal back-
grounds, including having served as 
prosecutors, public defenders, private 
law firm attorneys, and judges in other 
courts. Maryland now has its first 
Black U.S. attorney in our State’s his-
tory, whom I was pleased, along with 
Senator VAN HOLLEN, to recommend to 
President Biden and who was unani-
mously confirmed by the Senate. 
I believe that a more diverse court 
and justice system inspires the con-
fidence of Marylanders who seek their 
day in court and want to be treated 
fairly, with dignity and respect. 
I am confident that the Senate, 
under the leadership of Majority Lead-
er SCHUMER and Judiciary Chair DUR-
BIN, will conduct a fair hearing, vet-
ting, and confirmation process for 
President Biden’s eventual pick to re-
place Justice Breyer. 
I look forward to working with my 
colleagues in the Senate over the com-
ing months to give full and fair consid-
eration to President Biden’s nominee 
to replace Justice Breyer in order to 
fill the upcoming vacancy on the Su-
preme Court. I am hopeful the Amer-
ican people will be proud of the process 
that unfolds in the Senate as they 
watch and learn more about the Con-
stitution and the three branches of 
government 
that 
interact 
in 
this 
unique process to select the next Jus-
tice who will dispense justice on the 
highest Court in our land. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
HOUSING 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, be-
fore last year, the committee I chair 
and one of the committees on which 
the Presiding Officer sits—the Bank-
ing, Housing, and Urban Affairs Com-
mittee—was far too much about Wall 
Street and far too little about issues 
that matter to people’s lives. 
We have changed that. Instead of al-
ways listening to the biggest banks and 
their corporate lobbyists, we listen to 
workers and we listen to their families 
from all kinds of communities all over 
the country. 
Last year, we held the committee’s 
first-ever 
worker 
listening 
session 
where, as hard as it was for all of us, no 
Senator asked questions. We just heard 
from witnesses. We heard from work-
ers—about a half-dozen workers—who 
just told us their story. 
We know that workers power our 
economy. We heard from workers from 
all kinds of backgrounds, working all 
kinds of jobs. Some worked for banks, 
others worked for large tech compa-
nies, and some for other corporations. 
They talked about wage theft. They 
talked about being laid off during a 
pandemic with no severance pay. They 
talked about the danger in their work-
places. They talked about how, in some 
cases, their companies busted their 
unions. 
Their stories make it clear that the 
real harm the Wall Street business 
model does is to workers’ lives. 
Yesterday, we held our second listen-
ing session, this time with renters from 
around the country whose homes are 
owned by deep-pocketed investors like 
corporate landlords and private equity 
funds.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S604 
February 9, 2022 
One of those renters—some lived in 
the Presiding Officer’s home State, I 
believe in North Minneapolis—told her 
story. It is an increasing problem in 
every region, from big cities to rural 
towns. Deep-pocketed investors come 
into a community they have no con-
nection to, and they buy up homes; 
they raise rents; they cut services; and 
they don’t deliver on their promises to 
their tenants. 
These out-of-town and sometimes 
out-of-country investors are raising 
rents often by as much as 50 percent, 
issuing eviction notices, and leaving 
toxic mold and pest infestations to 
grow worse, all to pad their bottom 
line. 
We heard from renters in apartment 
buildings and single-family homes and 
manufactured housing. We heard from 
renters in Las Vegas, NV; Great Falls, 
MT; and Hyattsville, MD—all sharing 
those stories. 
One renter was told, when she asked 
why her rent suddenly increased by 
hundreds of dollars a month, ‘‘We have 
to please the investors.’’ Think about 
that. ‘‘We have to please the inves-
tors.’’ 
Renters in Nevada, in Maryland, in 
Texas, and in California had their 
homes repeatedly flooded with waste-
water, lived with rodent infestations, 
and went long periods without working 
showers or hot water. 
Listen to Juan Cuellar from Mary-
land. He said: 
The ceiling in the hallways is falling in. 
The wood floor is buckling. We don’t have 
heat. There are cockroaches and mice. The 
air conditioning units don’t work. There is a 
lot of mold. The refrigerator doesn’t work. 
They don’t want to fix anything, including 
the stove and the refrigerator and the heat-
er. 
They don’t even have heat. These in-
vestors claim they are just running a 
business. OK. The business is supposed 
to be providing a decent place to live— 
that is part of the deal—in exchange 
for 
collecting 
people’s 
hard-earned 
money in rent each month. If your 
building is full of mold and mice and 
doesn’t have working heat or doesn’t 
have a working stove, you are not hold-
ing up your end of the deal. You are 
not running a real business; you are 
running a scam. Families pay a very 
high price for it. 
Rachel Jones is a working mother in 
North Minneapolis. She said her per-
sistent complaints about her home’s 
leaking sewage and dangerous garage 
went unanswered. The city itself was 
forced to step in because of code viola-
tions. This single mother said the com-
pany that owns her home bought it as 
‘‘essentially a money-grabbing tool. 
That’s all they are doing.’’ 
Ms. Nguyen, who lives in Brooklyn, 
talked about the firm that bought her 
building, Greenbrook. She said: 
They and their business model do not care 
if I or my neighbors become homeless—in 
fact, their business model makes that possi-
bility [much more] likely. 
Cindy Newman, from Great Falls, 
MT, talked about her manufactured 
home community. She worked hard to 
buy her home, but she rents the land it 
sits on. That is how manufactured 
homes work, how mobile home parks 
work. She rents the land it sits on. She 
said they used to have ‘‘a fair land 
owner who kept our community safe 
and affordable,’’ until the private eq-
uity firm Havenpark Capital took over. 
I would just add that Senator SAND-
ERS just walked in, and Senator SAND-
ERS and I have talked about when these 
private equity firms come in and buy 
mobile home parks and the damage 
that so often does. 
She said her new owners in Montana 
have ‘‘cut back on all amenities and 
strip value out of our communities. 
They are brutal, absentee landlords.’’ 
Her line, her quote. 
The group raised rents and added fees 
for water and sewer and trash removal. 
Ms. Newman said this company bought 
a number of these homes—Havenpark— 
all over Montana and Iowa and other 
places around the country. 
She said it amounted to about an 86- 
percent increase—her words—for the 
dirt that her home sits on. But they 
just can’t pick up and move. Moving 
her home to a different community 
would cost $10,000 or $20,000. 
Just 
picture 
these 
mobile 
home 
parks. These mobile homes they buy— 
maybe $30-, $40-, $50,000 in some cases— 
they set them and then they build 
around them, and they aren’t really 
mobile at that point. It costs, as this 
woman said, $10- to $20,000 to move 
them. 
Most of her neighbors are seniors. 
They are on fixed incomes. 
She continues: 
It’s hard to believe we could lose our 
homes and our life savings to such uncaring, 
greedy people. 
Remember, they moved into these 
places 5 years, 10 years, 20 years ago. A 
family owned it. The family rented the 
land out for $200 or $300 a month. Then 
a private equity firm came in and dou-
bled their rent. I mean, think about 
what that does, just upending the lives 
of people who are not all that affluent. 
They are kind of living paycheck to 
paycheck or Social Security check to 
Social Security check anyway. 
As apartments and houses and manu-
factured home communities that peo-
ple can afford become harder and hard-
er to find, families are left with an im-
possible choice: pay money they don’t 
have for a home that may put their 
kids at risk or gamble and look for a 
new place to live with a fear they will 
end up with no place to sleep. 
That is what these seven renters, who 
represent millions of renters across the 
country—that is what they told us yes-
terday. These renters and homeowners 
shared their stories. They have shone a 
light on this problem. 
Tomorrow in our hearing—we will 
hold a hearing in our committee look-
ing at how we ended up here, how this 
exploitive business model has exploded 
around the country. For Wall Street 
investors, rent increases are distilled 
down as returns to shareholders. Code 
violations and eviction violations are 
just the cost of doing business. But for 
Mr. Cuellar and Ms. Jones and Ms. 
Newman and millions of Americans, 
these are their homes. These are their 
neighborhoods. It is up to us to look 
out for them, not to look out for pri-
vate equity firms’ bottom lines. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 3615 
Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, let 
us be as clear as we can be, and that is, 
there is significant discontent through-
out our country today, from Vermont 
to California and in all 50 States. The 
American people are worried about 
COVID. We are all worried about 
COVID. We are all tired of COVID. But 
the American people are worried about 
much more. They are worried about in-
flation, the price of food and gas, and 
other products going up. They are wor-
ried about climate change and whether 
or not the planet they will be leaving 
to their kids and grandchildren will be 
healthy and habitable. They are wor-
ried about a middle class whose real, 
inflation-accounted-for wages have not 
risen in almost 50 years, have been 
stagnant, and the reality that today, 
half of our workforce is living pay-
check to paycheck. 
The American people are worried 
about the massive level of income and 
wealth inequality which we are experi-
encing in which, during this pandemic 
alone, just the last few years, the bil-
lionaire class saw an increase in their 
wealth by some $2 trillion while at the 
same time, thousands of workers died 
as they went to their jobs. They didn’t 
have a choice about it; they went to 
work, and they died. 
The American people are worried 
that their kids are not getting the 
quality childcare that they need or 
that the family can afford. They are 
worried about the outrageous levels of 
student debt that their kids acquired 
because they chose to get a higher edu-
cation. 
Above all else, the American people, 
in my view, are outraged that in the 
midst of all of these crises and more, 
their elected officials are simply not 
responding. 
In my view, now is the time to tell 
the American people that we in Con-
gress do understand their pain, that we 
do know what they are going through, 
and that we are prepared to stand up 
for the working families of this coun-
try and take on the greed of powerful 
special interests who wield so much in-
fluence over the economic and political 
life of our Nation. 
Today, Senator KLOBUCHAR and I are 
going to focus on one—just one—of the 
many issues that this Congress must 
address. The American people want ac-
tion, and that is what we have to give 
them. We have to respond to the crises. 
Today, we are going to be talking 
about prescription drugs. For decades, 
literally decades—20, 30, 40 years—

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S605 
February 9, 2022 
Members of both political parties have 
come to the floor of the Senate, come 
to the floor of the House, and they 
have bemoaned the high cost of pre-
scription drugs in this country. They 
promised the American people they 
would lower those outrageous prices. 
Republicans have come to the floor, 
Democrats have come to the floor, and 
speech after speech has been made. And 
not only speeches—Members of both 
political parties put 30-second ads on 
television when they ran for office: 
Hey, vote for me. I am going to lower 
the cost of prescription drugs. 
For decades now, Members of Con-
gress have been talking about lowering 
the cost of prescription drugs, and for 
decades, they have failed to deliver. 
Talk, talk, talk—nothing happens. The 
cost of prescription drugs goes up. 
Congress has failed to deliver under 
Democratic leadership. It has failed to 
deliver under Republican leadership. It 
failed to deliver under Democratic 
Presidents and failed to deliver under 
Republican Presidents. We have failed 
to deliver because of the greed of the 
pharmaceutical industry, which today 
is likely the most powerful corporate 
interest in America and is certainly 
the dominant political force here in 
Washington, DC. 
So I ask my fellow Americans today: 
Do you want to know why you are pay-
ing the highest prices in the world for 
prescription drugs? Simple question. 
Why is it that we are paying in some 
cases 10 times more for the same exact 
prescription drugs that are sold in Can-
ada or in Europe? 
Do you want to know why one out of 
four Americans—this is really quite 
crazy, that in the midst of a dysfunc-
tional healthcare system, we have one 
out of four Americans who cannot af-
ford to fill the prescriptions that their 
doctor writes. Think about that for 
one-half a second. People are sick. 
They go to the doctor. The doctor 
writes out a prescription. People can’t 
afford to fill it. They end up in the 
emergency room. They end up in the 
hospital. They get sicker because they 
simply cannot afford the outrageous 
cost of medicine. 
Do you know why millions of dia-
betic Americans actually ration their 
insulin? I have talked to diabetics and 
parents of diabetics. Their kids get 
sick because they cannot afford the 
cost of insulin. Obviously, diabetes 
today is a terrible, terrible illness im-
pacting many millions of Americans. 
Let me tell you why we pay the high-
est prices in the world, why people in 
America die because they can’t afford 
prescription drugs. The answer has ev-
erything to do with the corrupt polit-
ical system in which over the past 20 
years the pharmaceutical industry has 
spent over $4.5 billion—not million; $4.5 
billion—on lobbying and hundreds of 
millions of dollars on campaign con-
tributions. Yes, you heard that cor-
rectly—$4.5 billion over 20 years on lob-
bying and God knows how many hun-
dreds of millions of dollars on cam-
paign contributions. These are cam-
paign contributions that go to Repub-
licans. These are campaign contribu-
tions that go to Democrats. And I am 
talking about many hundreds of Mem-
bers of the House and Senate who re-
ceive funding from the pharmaceutical 
industry. 
Further, the pharmaceutical indus-
try has over the years mounted an un-
precedented lobbying effort in Wash-
ington, here in the Nation’s Capital, 
and in States all over the country. I 
hope everybody hears this because this 
is what power is about. This is why you 
pay the highest prices in the world for 
prescription drugs. 
Last year alone, the pharmaceutical 
industry hired more than 1,700 well- 
paid lobbyists to come to Capitol Hill 
to protect their interests, including the 
former congressional leaders of both 
major political parties. Got that? Sev-
enteen hundred well-paid lobbyists pro-
tecting the interests of the pharma-
ceutical industry—get out your calcu-
lator because what that amounts to is 
three pharmaceutical industry lobby-
ists for every Member of Congress. 
There are 435 Members in the House 
and 100 in the Senate and 1,700 well- 
paid lobbyists making sure that you 
pay the highest prices in the world for 
prescription drugs. 
What is the result of all of that lob-
bying and all of those campaign con-
tributions? Well, I think the American 
people know it every time they walk 
into a drugstore. The pharmaceutical 
industry, uniquely in the entire world, 
is able to raise their prices anytime 
they want, to any level they want. 
How many people out there walked 
into a drugstore, refilled their prescrip-
tion, and the pharmacist said: Well, I 
am sorry to tell you the cost of your 
medicine has gone up 20 percent. 
Why? Because they can. They can do 
anything they want. If they want to 
double prices, triple prices, there is no 
law stopping them. That is what you 
get when you spend billions of dollars 
on lobbyists and campaign contribu-
tions. You get what you pay for, and 
they have gotten what they paid for. 
Not only do we pay the highest prices 
in the world for prescription drugs, but 
the result of that is that the pharma-
ceutical industry, year after year, 
makes huge profits. Eight of the larg-
est drug companies in America in 2020 
made nearly $50 billion in profits, while 
the CEOs of those pharmaceutical com-
panies took home over $350 million in 
total compensation. Eight companies; 
$350 million in compensation for the 
CEOs of those companies; $50 billion in 
profits in the last year we have infor-
mation. 
Let’s be very clear. The overriding 
motivation of the pharmaceutical in-
dustry is greed. Their overriding goal 
is to make as much money as they can 
by squeezing as much as they can get 
from the sick, from the elderly, and 
from the desperate. 
I could give you many, many exam-
ples of the outrageous greed of the 
pharmaceutical industry, and I am not 
even going to talk about the opiate cri-
sis, which has killed hundreds of thou-
sands of Americans. I am not even 
going to go there today. 
Let me just mention, a couple of 
years ago, the former CEO of a drug 
company called Gilead became a bil-
lionaire by charging $1,000 for the hepa-
titis drug Sovaldi. He became a billion-
aire. Interestingly enough, that drug 
was developed by taxpayer dollars 
through the Veterans’ Administration. 
While they charge $1,000 a treatment 
here in the United States, it turns out 
that it costs $1 to manufacture and can 
be purchased in India for all of $4— 
$1,000 here; $4 there. 
In 2016, the chairman of Mylan re-
ceived a $164 million compensation 
package after his company jacked up 
the price of EpiPen—you all remember 
EpiPen—by 550 percent over a 9-year 
period. 
All over this country, the American 
people are asking a simple question: 
How many people in our country need 
to die? How many people need to get 
unnecessarily sicker before Congress is 
prepared to take on the greed and 
power of the pharmaceutical industry? 
Enough is enough. A lifesaving pre-
scription drug does not mean anything 
if you cannot afford that drug. We have 
great drugs out there. What does it 
mean if you can’t afford that drug or if 
you are going to go bankrupt because 
you have to buy it for a family mem-
ber? 
We cannot allow the pharmaceutical 
industry to charge the American peo-
ple, by far, the highest prices in the 
world for prescription drugs. And that 
is why I have introduced today, along 
with Senator KLOBUCHAR, legislation 
that would cut the cost of prescription 
drugs under Medicare in half—not by 10 
percent, not 30 percent—cut the cost of 
prescription drugs under Medicare in 
half. It would do that by making sure 
that Medicare pays the same low prices 
for prescription drugs as the Veterans’ 
Administration does. 
Why is it that the VA pays so much 
less for prescription drugs than Medi-
care? The answer is pretty simple. 
While the VA has been able to nego-
tiate with the pharmaceutical industry 
for the past 30 years, Congress banned 
Medicare by law from doing anything 
to lower prescription drug prices. And 
the result is that, according to the 
nonpartisan 
Government 
Account-
ability Office, Medicare pays twice as 
much for the exact same prescription 
drugs as the VA. 
All 
right. 
You 
talk 
about 
dysfunctionality. 
You 
talk 
about 
crazy. You have two branches of gov-
ernment. VA pays X, Medicare pays 2X. 
How in God’s name does that make 
sense to anybody other than the phar-
maceutical industry? This is totally 
absurd. And if the VA can negotiate 
with the drug companies, so can Medi-
care. 
By the way, for all of the great def-
icit hawks here staying up nights wor-
rying about the deficit, let me tell you,

February 9, 2022 
if we do that, we will save Medicare 
some $900 billion over the next decade. 
I would like to see where the deficit 
hawks are on this issue—$900 billion, 10 
years. That is real money. 
The VA, obviously, is not the only 
Agency that negotiates for lower drug 
prices. That is something that takes 
place in every other major country on 
Earth. There is no rational reason for 
the pharmaceutical industry to charge 
the American people $98.70 for a stand-
ard unit of insulin that can be pur-
chased in the UK for just $7.52, and on 
and on it goes. 
The 
American 
people 
are 
being 
played for suckers. They have bought 
the U.S. Congress, and it is time now 
for Congress to stand up to these peo-
ple. 
With that, I would mention that 
what we are talking about—what Sen-
ator KLOBUCHAR
and I are talking 
about is not some radical far-left idea. 
I get that. I don’t know if Senator KLO-
BUCHAR gets that, but it is not some 
radical, far-left idea; it is a fairly pop-
ular idea. 
According to an October 2021 poll by 
the Kaiser Family Foundation, 83 per-
cent of the American people want 
Medicare to negotiate with the phar-
maceutical industry to lower the cost 
of prescription drugs, and poll after 
poll shows the same thing. Maybe, just 
maybe—ready 
for 
a 
radical 
idea, 
Madam President? Maybe, just maybe, 
instead of doing the work of the lobby-
ists and the pharmaceutical industry, 
we might just want to represent the 
American people. 
I yield the floor. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, 
I think you know Senator SANDERS and 
I debated a number of issues before, but 
from the beginning, we have been 
strongly united on one thing, and that 
is bringing down costs for the Amer-
ican people. And that is, as he just 
said, not one bit radical. 
We have joined together to introduce 
the 
Cutting 
Medicare 
Prescription 
Drug Prices in Half Act because that is 
what we should be doing. America pays 
more. The people of this country pay 
more for their prescription drugs than 
any other country in the world. How 
can that be, as Senator SANDERS has 
noted, when it is our country, our tax-
payers who are investing in all this re-
search? How can we come up short 
when it comes to what our people are 
paying for drugs? 
The examples: In the past 5 years, 
the cost of Lyrica—a drug that you see 
advertised on TV, millions of dollars in 
ads—a drug that treats nerve pain or 
Symbicort, an asthma medication, in-
creased almost 50 percent. What is the 
result of these kinds of increases? 
Nearly 20 percent of older adults have 
reported not taking their medicines as 
prescribed because of the cost. 
Last month alone, drug companies 
hiked the price of 742 drugs in America. 
What do we do? We sit. We sit; we talk 
about it; and we are not taking action. 
That is why Senator SANDERS and I 
are putting our bill in today. We would 
love to spend the week debating it. We 
would like to move to this bill so we 
can get this done. We know that pre-
scription drug prices in the United 
States are more than 250-percent high-
er than other industrialized nations. 
What is our simple solution? The VA, 
the U.S. Department of Veterans Af-
fairs, that we empower with the lives 
of our veterans and their healthcare— 
they negotiate the prices of the drugs 
they purchase and dispense for our Na-
tion’s veterans. One report found that 
the VA price is often half as much as 
what Medicare pays. Why? It is simple. 
The VA negotiates for prices; Medicare 
doesn’t. 
I kind of think—and Senator SAND-
ERS and I know this well—that 46 mil-
lion seniors in America could get a 
pretty good deal if you allow the gov-
ernment to negotiate on their behalf, a 
good deal for the taxpayers of this 
country, for people who care about 
deficits, for people who care about the 
bottom-line budget, and a good deal for 
customers. 
Guess what. It wouldn’t just help sen-
iors because that is such a large block 
of customers in this country that it 
would bring down the drug costs for ev-
eryone. 
The stories in my State—people like 
Claire from St. Paul. When the cost of 
the prescription drug she relied on to 
manage 
her 
rheumatoid 
arthritis 
jumped from $60 a month to $1,400 per 
month, she could no longer afford it. In 
her words, her arthritis became so bad 
that she could barely handle a fork and 
a knife or the young man who is the 
manager of a restaurant, a full-time 
job. When he aged off his parents’ in-
surance, what happened to him? You 
know this story, Madam President. He 
started to ration his insulin. He had se-
vere diabetes, and he died. His mother 
has made her life about getting better 
drug prices. 
Senator SANDERS and I believe you 
start with the biggest buying block. 
You start with seniors. You get that 
negotiation going, and it will make a 
big difference. 
For people who believe in free mar-
kets and negotiation and competition, 
I don’t know how you can say no to 
this proposal. It is time to allow this to 
be debated to move forward with this 
bill. Let’s get it on the floor and call it 
up for a vote. 
Thank you, Senator SANDERS. 
Mr. SANDERS. Senator KLOBUCHAR 
said it all. I know we are spending the 
week dealing with Assistant Secre-
taries or something or another—and 
that is all terribly important—but the 
American people want us to start act-
ing on their needs. 
At the top of the list, as Senator 
KLOBUCHAR
just said—and what she 
said about folks in Minnesota is ex-
actly the same everywhere. You hear 
the same stories in Vermont. People 
die and get sick because they can’t af-
ford prescription drugs. 
I say to my Republican friend, the 
time is now to have that debate. You 
want to vote against this bill? Hey, 
that is your right. You go home and ex-
plain it to the people. That is what de-
mocracy is. Some of us still believe in 
democracy, by the way. 
Madam President, as if in legislative 
session, I ask unanimous consent that 
at a time to be determined today by 
the majority leader, following con-
sultation of the Republican leader, the 
Senate proceed to the consideration of 
S. 3615, which was introduced earlier 
today; that there be 2 hours for debate, 
equally divided; that upon the use or 
yielding back of time, the bill be read 
a third time and the Senate vote on 
passage of the bill without intervening 
action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Idaho. 
Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, our 
Nation’s seniors deserve meaningful so-
lutions that increase prescription drug 
access and affordability. 
This bill, unfortunately, would dou-
ble down on the deepest flaws in our 
current healthcare system and usher in 
a host of new problems from fewer 
treatments to more bureaucracy. And, 
yes, it is almost certain under this leg-
islation we would see launch prices for 
new drugs actually increase. The solu-
tion is not to go and double down on a 
failed socialist theory of price-fixing 
and work to make our market better. 
Even setting aside the overwhelming 
implementation challenges and tech-
nical issues that this legislation would 
present from the outset, the provisions 
included would do far more harm than 
good, particularly for the very older 
Americans they are intended to help. 
I would note from the outset there is 
talk about wanting to have process and 
a vote. This legislation was just intro-
duced today. It just got a bill number 
today. There has been no vetting of 
this legislation in the committee, 
which is the regular order of this Sen-
ate. There has been no public analysis. 
There has been no public review. There 
has not been any hearing on this legis-
lation. There has been not any negotia-
tion on this legislation. 
I heard numbers thrown out here 
about what a savings this would be. 
CBO has not scored this legislation, 
and there are serious flaws with it. 
Under this proposal, we would see a 
staggering decline in the game-chang-
ing research and development that our 
universities, medical centers, and en-
trepreneurs conduct every day, as vital 
investments in the cures of the future 
would decline. 
As countless studies of price control 
mandates like the one before us today 
have concluded, these policies would 
slash new drug discoveries in the years 
to come, jeopardizing some of the high-
est risk projects, in particular.

February 9, 2022 
rates, like certain cancers, would like-
ly suffer the greatest impact, as Medi-
care would become increasingly stag-
nant and unable to meet the evolving 
needs of rapidly aging populations. 
After coming in under budget with 
satisfaction rates soaring and pre-
miums remaining remarkably stable, 
Medicare Part D would lose the mar-
ket-driven structure that has made it 
such a success story for so many sen-
iors. Instead, we would move closer to 
a government-run healthcare system— 
which is the ideal and the goal—where 
bureaucratic price controls like these 
would become the norm. 
The vast majority of Americans, in 
my opinion, still reject the notion of a 
government-run healthcare system and 
price controls in place of a free mar-
ket. 
Meanwhile, our frontline healthcare 
providers have weathered a truly un-
precedented 2 years of pandemic, and 
they would face a sweeping, imme-
diate, and drastic payment cut as this 
legislation aims to advance immediate 
payment reductions under Medicare 
Part B with direct implications for 
doctors and other healthcare profes-
sionals across all settings. 
In the face of widespread provider 
burnout, retirements, closures, and 
consolidation, these cuts risk accel-
erating trends that already jeopardize 
access to healthcare for far too many 
Americans from all walks of life, par-
ticularly in rural and underserved com-
munities. 
The VA, which has been referenced 
here, for its part, would inevitably see 
higher healthcare costs as any dis-
counts or other price concessions that 
lower drug costs for our Nation’s vet-
erans would disappear. 
Previous 
payment 
systems 
along 
these lines that have been suggested in 
the past have resulted in a host of un-
intended consequences, from higher 
launch prices to withheld rebates and 
discounts. 
Our veterans do not stand to gain 
from being tied to this unvetted and 
failed new proposal. 
As we confront unprecedented chal-
lenges at home and abroad, we must 
look to consensus-driven solutions that 
meet Americans’ everyday needs, in-
cluding prescription drug access and af-
fordability. We can agree on that. 
Members across the political spec-
trum have developed bipartisan drug 
pricing policies that could make a 
meaningful difference for workers and 
families. I have introduced legislation 
which is waiting in the committee for 
a vetting rather than coming to the 
floor here to try to get it brought to 
the floor without even going through 
Senate regular order. 
My legislation is called the Lower 
Cost, More Cures Act. Here is just a 
quick summary of what it contains: a 
hard 
cap 
on 
annual 
out-of-pocket 
spending for all seniors under Medicare 
Part B, with an installment-based 
monthly payment option; reforming of 
Medicare Part B benefits to reduce sen-
iors’ 
cost-sharing 
burdens 
and 
incentivize plans to negotiate the best 
possible deal for enrollees; increasing 
Part D plan choices; increasing op-
tions; and reducing prices. 
My bill does have an out-of-pocket 
monthly insulin cap at $35. That, you 
might remember, is the insulin cap 
that President Trump put into place. 
That is the kind of approach we need to 
follow. 
It also includes establishing a chief 
pharmaceutical negotiator to combat 
foreign freeloading and ensuring the 
best trade deals that achieve American 
success in dealing with these price dis-
crepancies that are driven by terrible 
behavior from our counterparts in 
other parts of the global economy; 
strengthening our consumer-oriented 
oversight through our cost-comparison 
tools and price transparency measures 
and robust reporting requirements in 
the drug supply chain; facilitating 
value-based arrangements where pri-
vate and public sector payers can pay 
based on patient outcomes, driving bet-
ter results for patients; and restruc-
turing payments for drugs adminis-
tered in the doctor’s office or hospital 
outpatient department to encourage 
physicians 
to 
deliver 
cost-effective 
treatment options where appropriate 
clinically. 
My point is, there are a lot of solu-
tions that can work within the con-
sistent free market and private sector 
solutions that we have solved here and 
are working on to make them better. 
We have an opportunity to lower pre-
scription drug costs without threat-
ening access to therapies or cures or 
the future handling of giving an advan-
tage, frankly, to our global rivals like 
the Chinese. With a bipartisan and bi-
cameral effort undertaken through reg-
ular order, we could make a major im-
pact on these issues. This legislation, 
unfortunately, does no such thing. It is 
thoroughly unvetted, showing no signs 
of technical assistance or practical fea-
sibility. It has not, as I said, received a 
CBO score or even an informal analysis 
or a committee hearing. It did not ad-
vance through regular process in the 
Senate. 
I see that our time is running out, 
and so I will end my comments at this 
point but just ask my colleagues to let 
us engage in regular order in the Fi-
nance Committee in the Senate and 
work these issues through. There are a 
lot of ideas on the table. Let’s work 
them through rather than try to cram 
through one side’s idea on the very day 
the bill was introduced in the Senate. I 
object. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
OSSOFF). The objection is heard. 
The Senator from Vermont. 
Mr. SANDERS. I say to my friend 
from 
Idaho, 
we 
have 
been 
going 
through regular order dealing with pre-
scription drugs for 40 years. It hasn’t 
quite worked. 
Your bill has gone nowhere. My bill 
has gone nowhere. If you have got ob-
jections to what Senator KLOBUCHAR 
and I are doing, let’s debate them on 
the floor of the Senate. 
We have heard all the talking points 
from you that the pharmaceutical in-
dustry wrote—I got that. They spend a 
lot of money writing these talking 
points. Let’s have that debate right 
here. The bill that Senator KLOBUCHAR 
and I are proposing is supported by 
over 80 percent of the American people 
and, I dare say, a vast majority of the 
people of Idaho. You want to oppose it. 
Go for it. 
Let’s have the damn debate right 
here on the floor, and if it takes 1 
week, great. If it takes 2 weeks, great. 
You will agree with me that this is an 
issue that the American people care 
about so I would hope that you would 
reconsider. Let’s bring it to the floor. 
Offer your amendments. Let’s have the 
debate. 
NOMINATION OF LEONARD PHILIP STARK 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this 
week, the Senate will vote to confirm 
Judge Leonard Stark to serve on the 
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal 
Circuit. 
Judge Stark is an exceptional and ex-
perienced jurist. For the past 14 years, 
he has served the District of Dela-
ware—first, as a magistrate judge and, 
since 2010, as a district court judge. 
He has presided over 6,000 civil and 
criminal cases, including 2,400 patent 
matters and 63 patent trials. 
This experience will be of particular 
importance on the Federal Circuit for 
two reasons. First, unlike the 12 other 
courts of appeals, the Federal Circuit 
has a specialized jurisdiction; it hears 
all of the Nation’s patent appeals. Sec-
ond, Judge Stark would replace the 
only active judge on the court who has 
previously served as a trial judge. This 
makes his extensive background as a 
trial judge especially valuable. 
Judge Stark brings with him consid-
erable experience serving on Federal 
appeals panels. He has sat, by designa-
tion, on the Third and Federal Circuits, 
where he heard 54 appeals and authored 
11 unanimous opinions. Before joining 
the bench, Judge Stark served as an 
Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Dis-
trict of Delaware for 4 years. He 
worked as a litigation associate at an 
international law firm. And he clerked 
on the Third Circuit. 
Judge Stark earned his bachelor of 
arts, bachelor of science, and master of 
arts simultaneously at the University 
of Delaware. He was awarded the pres-
tigious Rhodes Scholarship and re-
ceived a doctorate in philosophy from 
the University of Oxford. He also holds 
a J.D. from Yale Law School. With 
such impressive credentials, it is clear 
why the American Bar Association 
rated Judge Stark unanimously as 
‘‘Well Qualified’’ to sit on the Federal 
Circuit. 
His expertise in adjudicating patents 
combined with his experience hearing 
appeals will be an asset to the Federal 
Circuit and to our industrious, inven-
tive Nation. I will be voting for Judge 
Stark’s confirmation, and I urge my 
colleagues to join me.

REMEMBERING DR. DON GURNETT 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I 
want to take a moment to recognize 
the life and memory of Dr. Donald 
Gurnett. Dr. Gurnett recently passed 
away following a lifetime of scientific 
curiosity 
and 
achievements. 
Dr. 
Gurnett 
studied, 
taught, 
and 
re-
searched at the University of Iowa for 
more than 60 years. 
His career was rooted in his child-
hood interest in flight, where he built 
rockets and model planes, which led to 
studying electrical engineering at the 
University of Iowa. During his studies, 
he had the opportunity to work and 
learn with Dr. James Van Allen, who 
helped launch the first U.S. satellite 
into space and established the field of 
magnetospheric space research. Dr.

Gurnett’s success led to working on 
more than 30 spacecraft projects, in-
cluding Voyager 1 and 2 flights to the 
outer planets, the Galileo mission to 
Jupiter, and the Cassini mission to Sat-
urn. 
His legacy remains with the students 
he mentored by pushing them to take 
on important projects and work to-
wards their own success. In 2019, I 
wrote about the importance of STEM 
education and the accomplishments by 
Drs. Van Allen and Gurnett. I think my 
words then still encompass the curi-
osity and passion that Dr. Gurnett car-
ried with him throughout his life. 
For the students across Iowa heading to 
class in the new school year, remember to 
dream big. Don’t forget that a couple of farm 
boys from Mount Pleasant and Fairfax 
reached for the stars and wrote new chapters 
of space innovation and exploration. Their 
odyssey took them all over the world and 
their scientific quest took their research be-
yond the solar system to interstellar space.

TRIBUTE TO THERESE FRANCIS 
GILES 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, I rise 
today to pay tribute to Ms. Therese 
Giles, a devoted public servant who 
tirelessly served our Nation with dis-
tinction in the Department of the Navy 
for almost four decades. Therese re-
cently retired on December 31, 2021, 
after a successful 37-year government 
civil service career as an honored and 
distinguished senior flight controls 
computer scientist. 
Therese’s remarkable career and her 
immeasurable contributions to our na-
tional security can be categorized by so 
many unbelievable ‘‘firsts’’ and by a 
lifetime of selfless service. 
As a child, Therese was always in-
trigued with the next technological of-
fering—from watching NASA put the 
first man on the Moon, to the advances 
in next generation communications, to 
the invention of the integrated core 
processer. Inspired by these ‘‘firsts,’’ 
she pushed to be one of the firsts in her 
class, team, and field, carrying a life’s 
dream of making a difference in the 
technical field where women were very 
scarce 
and 
disappointingly 
under-
valued. 
At a time when women weren’t en-
couraged to pursue technical careers 
and weren’t thought of as computer 
scientists, Therese pushed forward and 
persevered to achieve undergraduate 
and advanced degrees in mathematics 
and computer science. 
Wanting to be part of something big-
ger than herself, Therese found her 
calling with the Navy’s aviation re-
search and development command. As 
a junior software computer scientist in 
the mid-1980s, she was instrumental in 
developing the innovative, first-ever, 
advanced digital flight controls archi-
tecture that revolutionized the way all 
Navy and Marine Corps jet aircraft op-
erated. 
Therese was also instrumental in re-
solving the catastrophic failures of the 
V–22 Osprey in the early 1990s and gen-
erating the software solutions that 
eventually returned the V–22 to flight 
and to the successful combat oper-
ations of today. 
With similar accomplishments across 
the F–14, A–6, F–18, E–2, and the F–35 
spectrum of aircraft, Therese directly 
contributed and helped develop the 
flight control and safety control sys-
tems of the majority of every naval 
aircraft from 1985 to current day. 
Throughout these many successes 
and ‘‘firsts,’’ Therese has remained 
committed to supporting and inspiring 
the next generation of young women in 
STEM fields. Serving as an avid men-
tor, teacher, and leader of the people 
around her, Therese has been a North 
Star role model for generations of up- 
and-coming young women to follow 
their dreams and become technical 
leaders in public service. 
In addition to her thirst for discovery 
and problem solving, a primary reason 
for Therese’s tenacious focus is that 
she had personal ‘‘skin in the game’’ 
when it came to our Nation’s security. 
Four of Therese’s siblings proudly 
served 
in 
our 
Nation’s 
military: 
Therese’s brothers VADM Mat Winter, 
USN; CDR Tom Winter, USN; Capt. 
Steve Winter, USMC; and sister CDR 
Elizabeth Winter Scruggs, USNR, all 
put their lives in harm’s way during 
their military careers to ensure our 
Nation’s security. Therese’s husband, 
Tim, is himself a retired member of the 
government civil service and an Army 
veteran. This is a family where duty 
and service run deep. 
Therese, as you and your family cele-
brate your well-deserved retirement, I 
congratulate you and thank you for al-
most four decades of unbelievable and 
lasting impact. I thank you for the 
many years of sacrifice you and your 
family have made in service to our Na-
tion. I join my colleagues in the Senate 
and all Americans in expressing our 
sincere appreciation and wish the very 
best for you, your husband, your son 
Eric, and daughter Meghan on your 
next exciting chapter.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO GLORIA BLICK 
∑ Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, 
today I rise to recognize Mrs. Gloria 
Miller Blick, a Connecticut resident 
who turns 100 on March 1, 2022. 
Mrs. Blick is a lifelong advocate for 
the elderly, who has worked tirelessly 
to inspire positive change. 
She was appointed to the Commis-
sion for the Aged by then-mayor of 
Stamford, Dannel Malloy. Mrs. Blick 
was also active as a member of 
Stamford’s Smith House Nursing and 
Rehabilitation Center’s board of direc-
tors and Southwest CT Agency on 
Aging’s advisory board. Later, she 
served 8 years as the chairwoman of 
Stamford’s Senior Centers board of di-
rectors. 
Mrs. Blick’s advocacy had far-reach-
ing results. Passionate about providing 
end-of-life options and other choices 
for the elderly, she spoke before the 
Connecticut State Senate. Her state-
ment took prominence in the State’s 
discussion regarding access to medical 
marijuana for elderly people with glau-
coma, a condition she has faced for 
nearly two decades. Her commitment 
to 
supporting 
those 
who 
are 
marginalized and underserved inspired 
her son, Dr. Gary Blick, to pursue a 
medical career and a lifetime of hu-
manitarian work. She even worked as 
the office manager for his practice for 
over 20 years and his billing specialist 
for over 30, commuting independently 
at age 97. 
A remarkable advocate, I applaud 
Mrs. Blick on her outstanding record of 
service. I hope my colleagues will join 
me 
in 
congratulating 
Mrs. 
Gloria 
Blick, her son Gary, and the rest of her 
family on this milestone of her 100th 
birthday.∑

REMEMBERING HENRY C. ‘‘HOPPY’’ 
SHORES 
∑ Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of a 
dedicated public servant, Army vet-
eran, proud West Virginian, and my 
very good friend, Henry C. ‘‘Hoppy’’ 
Shores. 
Put simply, Hoppy embodied what it 
means to be a true West Virginian, and 
the legacy he has left behind is an im-
portant part of our heritage. I believe 
that there is no greater accomplish-
ment than being in a position to give 
back to your community, and Hoppy’s 
work in public service truly benefited 
our home State in a profound way that 
touched countless lives. First Lady El-
eanor Roosevelt once said, ‘‘Since you 
get more joy out of giving joy to oth-
ers, you should put a good deal of 
thought into the happiness that you 
are able to give.’’ In that spirit, I am 
forever grateful to Hoppy for his com-
mitment to his community and our 
shared passion for serving the people of 
West Virginia. 
Born in Dunbar in 1930 to the late 
Henry Eugene and Mary Elizabeth 
Shores, Hoppy spent much of his life in 
the Kanawha Valley. He excelled in 
athletics as a legendary running back 
for Stonewall Jackson High School. As 
the star of his 1947 State championship 
team, Hoppy capped off his high school 
career as a Kennedy Award winner. In 
addition, he held a longstanding record 
in the 440-yard dash and was elected 
class president his senior year. Even 
then, his leadership skills were widely 
recognized. Following his glowing high 
school career, Hoppy attended West 
Virginia University on the Loyalty En-
dowment Scholarship, where his wide 
range of accomplishments continued. 
Hoppy’s life of service began in the 
U.S. Army, where he rose to the rank 
of major. I have always said that West 
Virginia is home to the most patriotic, 
hard-working people in the Nation; and 
Hoppy was no exception. Returning to 
Kanawha County after his military

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

February 9, 2022 
service to our Nation concluded, Hoppy 
continued giving back as a coach and 
supporter of one of the local Little 
League football teams. Hoppy was well- 
known as a tenacious supporter of 
youth sports in the Kanawha Valley 
and, for many years, would continue to 
support the youth of the valley in a va-
riety of initiatives. Good coaches win 
games, but great coaches, like Hoppy, 
have a lasting impact on your life. 
They are models for how to manage 
success and failure—and how to take 
the lessons you have learned in ath-
letics and apply them to your adult 
life. I can only begin to imagine how 
many leaders Hoppy forged throughout 
his time as a coach—and how many of 
his former athletes still look up to him 
to this day. 
Hoppy and his beloved wife Bronson, 
who shared his life for 68 years, raised 
their four children in Charleston. De-
spite his illustrious life filled with 
awards, accolades and achievements, 
Hoppy always considered his family his 
greatest accomplishment of all. He 
built a successful career in insurance; 
eventually, this career would cul-
minate in the Hoppy Shores Insurance 
Company. His impeccable work ethic 
was well-known, and all those he 
worked with considered him an honest, 
fair, and kind soul. 
As a successful businessman, family 
man, 
and 
youth 
sports 
supporter, 
Hoppy extended his civic engagement 
to elected positions. Hoppy dedicated 
42 years to the Kanawha County Com-
mission where he will be remembered 
for his staunch commitment to Yeager 
Airport 
and 
the 
Kanawha 
County 
Parks and Recreation board. He loved 
‘‘Hoppy’s Little Express Train’’ and his 
big smile atop the engine brought joy 
to each and every onlooker he rode 
past. As the longest serving Kanawha 
County commissioner in history, with 
an unmatched record of public service, 
the commission courtroom was named 
‘‘The Henry C. ‘Hoppy’ Shores Court-
room’’ in his honor. I believe this out-
standing tribute is a testament to his 
dedication to the citizens of Kanawha 
County. In addition to his 42 years on 
the 
Kanawha 
County 
Commission, 
Hoppy added 4 years of service in the 
West Virginia Legislature, where he 
will be remembered as a tenacious ad-
vocate for his neighbors in the Valley. 
Everything Hoppy stood for and rep-
resented lives on in the hearts and 
minds of all who had the privilege of 
knowing him, myself included. I was 
honored to call him a friend, and I 
know I join so many when I say West 
Virginia has lost a shining star. Hun-
dreds of tributes have poured in about 
our friend Hoppy since his passing, but 
there is one tribute that I think best 
shows who he was. Soccer was an 
emerging sport in the State, and 
Kanawha 
County 
was 
deliberating 
building a major soccer complex. The 
idea was hitting resistance, and it be-
came the subject of a county commis-
sion meeting. During the public meet-
ing, a young girl made a presentation 
about the importance of soccer in her 
life. Some opponents of the project 
began heckling the brave young girl. It 
is reported that the lack of decorum 
and bullying displayed by those oppo-
nents angered Hoppy so much that he 
looked 
at 
fellow 
County 
Commis-
sioners Kent Carper and Ben Salango 
and said, ‘‘Let’s just do it.’’ And that is 
how the Shawnee Sports Complex came 
to be. I know that every time I visit 
Shawnee, I will think of Hoppy siding 
with that brave little girl and smile. 
So many people have inspirational 
stories about Hoppy. It is my hope that 
his many friends and family have found 
peace, strength, and support in one an-
other and in the support of our entire 
home State for our shared loss of this 
wonderful person. He will be dearly 
missed by all who knew him. 
What is most important is that he 
lived a full life, surrounded by the peo-
ple he loved most. Gayle and I offer our 
deepest condolences to Hoppy’s wife of 
68 years, Bronson; and their children, 
Henry, Sherry, Scott, and Lynn; his 
many friends; and extended family. We 
will forever keep Hoppy and his family 
in our thoughts and prayers.∑

100TH ANNIVERSARY OF CON 
PAULOS CHEVROLET 
∑ Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, along 
with 
my 
colleagues 
Senator 
MIKE 
CRAPO and Representative MIKE SIMP-
SON, I rise to congratulate the Paulos 
Family on their 100th anniversary of 
having a Chevrolet Franchise continu-
ously in operation. 
On February 22, 1922, Con Paulos’ 
grandfather, Gus A. Paulos, opened a 
Chevrolet franchise in Magna, UT. 
After Gus was killed in an automobile 
accident, his sons carried on the family 
business for 42 years in Utah. In 1975, 
Pete G. Paulos and Ernest A. Paulos, 
along with their sons Con P. Paulos 
and Gus E. Paulos, moved the store 
from Magna to West Valley City, UT. 
In 1979, Con P. Paulos moved to Je-
rome, ID, and opened Con Paulos Chev-
rolet, which is the only Paulos family- 
owned store that continues to operate. 
With the help of his outstanding 
staff, Con has built his business reputa-
tion on providing quality automobiles 
to his loyal customers honestly and 
ethically. Con has not only created a 
successful business, he has also become 
an important part of the Magic Valley 
region and the State through his com-
munity leadership. He is committed to 
growing, improving, and developing the 
local economy, while furthering oppor-
tunities for fellow Idahoans. For years, 
Con has participated in many commu-
nity service projects and organizations: 
60 Hours to Fight Hunger, Santa’s 
Cause, Sleep in Heavenly Peace, Sub 
for Santa, Boys & Girls Club, Rising 
Stars, Valley House, Business Plus, 
Chamber of Commerce, the Greater 
Twin Falls Area Transportation Com-
mittee, and the Rotary Club, to name 
just a few. 
In our tenure serving Idaho in the 
statehouse and in Congress, we have 
had the opportunity to work with Con 
on many important State and national 
issues. He is someone we trust to pro-
vide valuable insight and advice on 
many subjects. In addition, we have 
had the pleasure of recreating with Con 
in various settings, including a duck 
blind in Hagerman and on the links of 
Blue Lakes Country Club. Con is a 
straight shooter in the field, on the 
golf course, in his business, family, 
community, and his life. 
Today, the fourth generation of the 
Paulos family, Peter ‘‘Costa’’ Paulos, 
is actively helping Con operate the 
dealership, continuing the family’s leg-
acy. Costa also recently added a new 
member to the Paulos family with the 
birth of Gus, Con’s new grandson. Fore-
shadowing the future, Baby Gus could 
possibly keep the Paulos family Chev-
rolet line intact for a remarkable fifth 
generation. 
Congratulations to Con, his family, 
and all the employees of Con Paulos 
Chevrolet on 100 years of outstanding 
service to Magic Valley, ID and the Na-
tion. You make our great State proud, 
and we look forward to your continued 
growth and success.∑

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S614 
February 9, 2022 
a National Climate Adaptation Science 
Center and Regional Climate Adapta-
tion Science Centers to respond to the 
effects of extreme weather events and 
climate trends, and for other purposes; 
to the Committee on Environment and 
Public Works. 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I rise 
today to introduce the Climate Adapta-
tion Science Center Act, or CASC Act. 
This bill authorizes the national and 
nine regional CASCs that came about 
after Congress appropriated funding for 
a National Climate Science Center in 
2008 and subsequently, in 2009, Depart-
ment of the Interior Secretary Salazar 
recognized the Department as the lead 
Agency for protecting the country’s 
cultural and natural resources via sec-
retarial order. 
The national and regional CASCs are 
housed within the U.S. Geological Sur-
vey, USGS. The national CASC is lo-
cated in Reston, VA, and the nine re-
gional CASCs are dispersed throughout 
the country from Hawaii, to Alaska to 
Massachusetts. These regional CASCs 
service stakeholders in the continental 
United States, Hawaii, Alaska, U.S.-af-
filiated Pacific Islands, USAPI, and the 
U.S. Caribbean. The purpose of these 
CASCs is to help protect cultural and 
natural resources by developing the 
science and tools that on-the-ground 
managers need to respond to the effects 
of climate change. 
One regional CASC, the Pacific Is-
land CASC, or PI-CASC, is a partner-
ship between the USGS and a univer-
sity consortium hosted by the Univer-
sity of Hawaii at Manoa, with the Uni-
versity of Hawaii at Hilo and the Uni-
versity of Guam. PI-CASC was estab-
lished in October 2011 and over the 
course of more than a decade has con-
ducted important climate research in-
formed by impacted stakeholders, de-
veloped products and tools for resource 
managers to address climate change, 
and provided programs to increase ca-
pacity and stakeholder networking. 
Over 100 research projects have been 
completed to address stakeholder needs 
across 
the 
Hawaiian 
Islands 
and 
USAPI, such as prioritization planning 
for coastal wetland restoration on 
Molokai, developing a climate and GIS 
data portal for American Samoa, and 
predicting and mitigating avian dis-
ease at Hakalau Forest National Wild-
life Refuge on Hawaii Island. Over a 
dozen different products and tools have 
been developed by PI-CASC, including 
sea level forecasting tools for commu-
nities throughout the Pacific, a data-
base on weed fire risk throughout Ha-
waii, and an agroforestry tool for 
Marshallese 
agricultural 
producers. 
Programs that have been made possible 
by the PI-CASC include a Manager Cli-
mate Corps on Hawaii Island, a Sum-
mer Undergraduate Research Fellow-
ship, and a Pacific Regional Invasive 
Species & Climate Change Management 
Program. 
These are just examples of research, 
products, and programs made possible 
by one regional CASC. The nine re-
gional CASCs are providing similar 
services all across the country. Cur-
rently, stakeholder demand for CASC 
system services outpaces available re-
sources. Additionally, in the coming 
years and decades, the challenges that 
on-the-ground resource managers face 
with climate change are only going to 
become more numerous and complex. 
As such, this bill is necessary to for-
mally establish the CASCs in law so 
that the important work that the na-
tional and nine regional CASCs con-
duct can continue assisting stake-
holders all across the country for dec-
ades to come. 
By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. 
COONS, 
Ms. 
BALDWIN, 
Mr. 
BROWN, Mr. BLUMENTHAL, Ms. 
KLOBUCHAR, Mrs. GILLIBRAND, 
and Ms. DUCKWORTH): 
S. 
3622. 
A 
bill 
to 
establish 
an 
AmeriCorps Administration to carry 
out the national and volunteer service 
programs, to expand participation in 
such programs, and for other purposes; 
to the Committee on Finance. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, service is 
at the heart of the Americans ethos. 
We take inspiration from those who 
have answered the call to serve, wheth-
er in defense of our Nation abroad or in 
strengthening 
our 
communities 
at 
home. Finding common cause through 
service is how we will overcome the 
major challenges of our time, from re-
covering from the COVID–19 pandemic 
to addressing inequality to strength-
ening civil society and democratic in-
stitutions to leaving a healthy, resil-
ient planet to future generations. That 
is why I am proud to join Congressman 
JOHN LARSON of Connecticut in intro-
ducing the America’s Call to Improving 
Opportunities Now, ACTION for Na-
tional Service Act. Our legislation 
calls for a historic expansion of the 
number of service opportunities and an 
increased investment in those who 
serve. 
The ACTION for National Service 
Act will honor our national value of 
service, while addressing the barriers 
that limit citizens’ opportunities to 
serve. Our legislation will set us on a 
path to 1 million national service posi-
tions within 10 years. It will increase 
the educational award so that an indi-
vidual completing 2 full years of serv-
ice will earn the equivalent of 4 years 
of the average in-state tuition at a 
public college or university. Indeed, 
those who are willing to serve should 
not be left to carry a heavy financial 
burden of student loan debt. The AC-
TION for National Service Act will also 
ease other financial barriers to service 
by increasing the living allowance and 
eliminating the tax liability for the 
education awards and living stipends. 
The bill calls for a robust outreach ef-
fort to ensure that all young people 
will know about the many opportuni-
ties to serve their country and their 
communities. It will mobilize a Civil-
ian Climate Corps to address the ur-
gent needs of hardest hit communities. 
Finally, the ACTION for National Serv-
ice Act calls for elevating the Corpora-
tion for National and Community Serv-
ice to a Cabinet-level Agency and es-
tablishes a National Service Founda-
tion to leverage private sector re-
sources to support national service ac-
tivities. 
Mr. President, it is time we reinvigo-
rate the social contract we have with 
each other. Americans have a deep tra-
dition of service, starting with the 
dedicated men and women of our 
Armed Forces and including all those 
who have served in AmeriCorps, Senior 
Corps, and the Peace Corps. However, 
as more Americans desire to serve, it is 
important that they be given the op-
portunity to do so. It is just as impor-
tant to invest in the education and pro-
fessional development of those who 
have sacrificed and given so much to 
our Nation. Developing the talents of 
our most committed citizens pays life-
long dividends. Our investment in the 
GI 
Bill 
not 
only 
honors 
our 
servicemembers but also enriches our 
Nation. 
Similarly, 
the 
education 
awards for those who have served 
through our national programs have 
economic impacts beyond the individ-
uals who earn them. That is the new 
deal that the ACTION for National 
Service Act offers. 
All AmeriCorps members take a 
pledge to get things done for Ameri-
cans, to make communities safer, 
smarter and healthier, and to bring us 
together. It is a pledge we all should 
commit ourselves to. 
I would like to thank Senators 
COONS, BALDWIN, BROWN, BLUMENTHAL, 
GILLIBRAND, and KLOBUCHAR for joining 
me as original cosponsors of the AC-
TION for National Service Act and to 
urge our colleagues to join us in work-
ing for its passage so we can ensure 
that all who aspire to serve have the 
opportunity to do so.

S. 3623. A bill to reauthorize the Vio-
lence Against Women Act of 1994, and 
for other purposes; read the first time. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise today to introduce the Violence 
Against Women Act Reauthorization 
Act of 2022. 
This bipartisan bill would reauthor-
ize the Violence Against Women Act 
through 2027 and provide important up-
dates to modernize the law that has 
been critical to protecting and sup-
porting the survivors of domestic vio-
lence, dating violence, sexual assault, 
and stalking. 
I was proud to support the original 
Violence Against Women Act in 1994 
and have supported each reauthoriza-
tion of the law.

Senator MURKOWSKI for working with 
me to prepare this important piece of 
legislation. 
We have also had help from a number 
of our Senate colleagues who have 
made important contributions to this 
effort. I am proud that this bill has re-
ceived strong bipartisan support in the 
Senate. 
I would also like to thank the many 
advocates who have lent their thoughts 
and support to this effort. This bill was 
written in close consultation with the 
people who are on the frontlines help-
ing survivors of domestic violence 
every day. It is not a Democratic bill 
or a Republican bill—it is a bill for sur-
vivors. 
Together, we drafted a bill that pre-
serves the good work of the last Vio-
lence Against Women Act reauthoriza-
tion and strengthens existing pro-
grams. 
For nearly 30 years, the Violence 
Against Women Act has played a vital 
role in the Federal response to domes-
tic violence, dating violence, sexual as-
sault, and stalking. I hope that this 
bill will be an effective tool to build 
upon those efforts. 
Despite the progress made over the 
last three decades, sexual, emotional, 
and physical abuse are still painful re-
alities for far too many Americans. 
More than one in three women experi-
ence rape, physical violence, or stalk-
ing by an intimate partner in their life-
time. Nationwide, an average of three 
women are killed each day by a current 
or former intimate partner. 
According to the National Network 
to End Domestic Violence, in a single 
day in 2020, 76,525 domestic violence 
survivors received the resources they 
needed thanks to programs funded and 
supported by the Violence Against 
Women Act. 
It is clear that the programs created 
by the Violence Against Women Act 
are necessary, and they need to be con-
tinually updated to meet the needs of 
survivors. The bipartisan bill that we 
are 
introducing 
today 
reauthorizes 
these important programs and provides 
the necessary updates to strengthen 
them. 
This bill enhances and expands serv-
ices for survivors of domestic violence, 
including survivors in rural commu-
nities, LGBT survivors, survivors with 
disabilities, and survivors who experi-
ence abuse later in life. 
This bill reauthorizes and strength-
ens the criminal justice response to do-
mestic violence, including by improv-
ing the Justice Department’s STOP 
grant program; expanding support pro-
vided to survivors in the legal system; 
and strengthening the ability of Tribal 
courts to address instances of domestic 
violence on Tribal lands. 
This bill also invests in prevention 
education 
efforts, 
improves 
the 
healthcare system’s response to sexual 
violence across the country, and estab-
lishes a pilot program on restorative 
practices that focuses on preventing or 
addressing domestic violence, dating 
violence, sexual assault, and stalking 
through community based, victim-ini-
tiated efforts to seek accountability. 
I am pleased that we have strong bi-
partisan support for this bill, but our 
work is not done. The survivors—who 
this bill is for—need the Senate to not 
only introduce this bill but to pass it. 
The prevention of domestic violence 
and the support for survivors of these 
heinous crimes is not a partisan issue. 
This is not a perfect bill. I regret 
that certain provisions were not able 
to be included in this bill, most nota-
bly the closure of the ‘‘boyfriend loop-
hole’’ to ensure that individuals con-
victed of domestic abuse against a dat-
ing partner could not purchase fire-
arms. Individuals convicted of domes-
tic violence against a spouse are al-
ready prevented from purchasing a fire-
arm, and it is deeply disappointing 
that there is not sufficient bipartisan 
support for this commonsense provi-
sion to close this loophole. I would 
have liked to include those additional 
provisions, as would many of my Sen-
ate colleagues. But though it is not 
perfect, it is a strong bill. 
I look forward to working with my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to 
advance this bill through the Senate 
and get it signed into law as soon as 
possible. 
The time to act is now. I urge all of 
my colleagues to support this impor-
tant bipartisan legislation, and I hope 
that it will come to the floor for a vote 
quickly.

RECOGNIZING 
NATIONAL 
COURT 
REPORTERS 
AND 
CAPTIONERS 
WEEK 
HON. RON KIND 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 9, 2022 
Mr. KIND. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize 
National 
Court 
Reporters 
and 
Captioners 
Week. 
Court 
reporters 
and 
captioners are highly trained professionals 
who have the unique ability to convert spoken 
word into text that can be read, broadcasted 
and archived. This profession provides a vital 
service to our Nation. Their work results in 
real-time translation services for people who 
are deaf and hard of hearing in addition to 
providing near instant translations in other set-
tings. Our Nation’s captioners ensure all 
Americans have equal access to news and 
other critical information. 
I would be remiss if I failed to mention my 
wife, Tawni, and her work as a court reporter. 
Tawni has been a fearless champion and ad-
vocate for real-time writers. Most notably, she 
developed a program to transcribe the Vet-
erans History Project recordings. Now the Li-
brary of Congress has a written record of 
these stories. I want to extend my sincerest 
thanks to the real-time writers who have given 
their time to do this. 
In the 117th Congress, I reintroduced the 
Training for Realtime Writers Act, which would 
reauthorize the Training for Realtime Writers 
Grant program and encourage careers in real- 
time writing and court reporting, provide schol-
arships for students, and modernize cur-
riculum to adapt to our changing world. 
The Training for Realtime Writers Grant Pro-
gram has been successful in training the cur-
rent generation of captioners and court report-
ers and has aided in the rapid growth of these 
professions. By reauthorizing the Training for 
Realtime Writers grants, students will have the 
opportunity to enter a technical, well-paid, and 
highly skilled career that will allow them to be-
come court reporters and captioners imme-
diately upon graduation. 
From maintaining the integrity of our democ-
racy to ensuring every citizen stays up to date 
on today’s 24-hour news cycle, real-time writ-
ers are vital to Americans in all communities. 
Over the past decade, this program has en-
couraged a new generation of real-time writers 
to enter this important field. I want to acknowl-
edge the court reporters and captioners in the 
House of Representatives, especially those 
who were on the House floor on January 6, 
2021, when insurrectionists breached the Cap-
itol. Their work is crucial to the sustained func-
tion of our government, and I thank them for 
their service and dedication to our country.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF MAJOR 
GENERAL GARY WAYNE JOHN-
STON 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 9, 2022 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life and service of 
Major General Gary Wayne Johnston who 
passed away on January 20, 2022. My deep-
est condolences are with his family, friends, 
and loved ones during this time of mourning. 
Gary Johnston was born on October 21, 
1964 in Russellville, Arkansas. He served in 
the U.S. Army for over 34 years. He served 
overseas in Germany, the first Gulf War and 
Afghanistan and commanded the U.S. Army 
Intelligence and Security Command at Fort 
Belvoir, Virginia. Additionally, he was a direc-
tor of intelligence of the United States Special 
Operations Command and the deputy chief of 
staff for intelligence for Resolute Support Mis-
sion. After retiring from the Army in 2021, 
Gary joined Touchstone Futures as the execu-
tive Vice President for Intelligence, Security, 
and Risk. He served on the advisory board for 
Leyden Solutions. 
Left to cherish his memory are his beloved 
wife, Brigadier General Amy Johnston; his 
mother, Bonnie; and children, Lauren, Blake, 
and Parker. 
The Johnston family, and all those who had 
the opportunity to know and serve with him, 
are in my thoughts and prayers.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF CURTIS HAYES MUHAMMAD 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 9, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and 
service of a remarkable individual, Curtis 
Hayes Muhammad. 
Curtis Hayes Muhammad spent his entire 
life participating in various struggles for human 
rights and civil rights. His activism began in 
the fall of 1961. Only 18 years old, he was 
one of five young people from McComb, Mis-
sissippi, brave enough to respond to Bob 
Moses’s call to begin direct action and com-
munity organizing there. He was a key mem-
ber of SNCC’s dangerous and groundbreaking 
efforts all over Mississippi throughout the six-
ties. Jailed many times for civil rights work, 
Curtis kept the principles of bottom up orga-
nizing learned from Moses and Ella Baker as 
the guiding foundation to subsequent efforts of 
union and community organizing and struggles 
for African Liberation. These beliefs in a coop-
erative society and bottom up organizing led 
by poor and dark-skinned people have been 
embraced by many contemporary movements 
for social justice today. 
Curtis’s early life experiences made him re-
sponsive to these movement ideals. He grew 
up in a family of sharecroppers in Chisolm 
Mission, Mississippi who had joined with 26 
other sharecropping families and purchased a 
plot of land which they worked together. 
Raised by his grandmother, a midwife, he was 
taught principles of black independence and 
strength. Learning that his father had to flee 
Mississippi after killing several Ku Klux Klans-
men in a gun fight, Curtis was determined to 
find ways to fight against Mississippi seg-
regationists. He began preaching as a child 
and was encouraged by his grandmother that 
he had an important role to play in the libera-
tion of black people. 
Curtis’s post-civil rights activism included 
helping to organize the 1963 Chicago School 
Boycott when 225,000 students walked out 
demanding an end to racial segregation and 
the disparate treatment of Black students. He 
was an organizer for the New Politics Conven-
tion that ran Dr. Benjamin Spock and Dick 
Gregory in the 1968 presidential election as 
third-party candidates. Curtis helped establish 
a radical Black bookstore in Washington, D.C. 
and helped create an early version of a Com-
munity Supported Agriculture project, bringing 
produce from Black farmers in the South to 
northern progressive communities in D.C. and 
NYC. He also worked on housing issues for 
poor people with the Harlem Reclamation 
Project which urged homeless people to take 
over abandoned brownstones and rehabilitate 
them, and thus extract ownership from the 
City. In Jersey City, NJ, following the same 
model, he assisted in the handing over of 
more than 60 brownstones to poor folks. 
Later he worked as a union organizer for 
Unite in Monroe, LA. He successfully orga-
nized several dozen locals, mostly of Black 
women garment workers, using the Ella Baker 
model of organizing. As a result, the organized 
workers sometimes made decisions inde-
pendent of and criticized by national union 
leaders such as calling for and enacting wild-
cat strikes. He went on with the now federated 
Unite-HERE to New Orleans organizing hotel 
and restaurant workers there and mentoring 
young folks in Union Summer. He also joined 
local New Orleans community members in 
Community Labor United, which worked on 
improving public education in New Orleans as 
the laboratory for a national Quality Education 
as a Civil Right Campaign.

HON. DAVID G. VALADAO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 9, 2022 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the life of Dr. Robert 
Shankerman as United Health Centers of the 
San Joaquin Valley unveils a memorial display 
in his honor. 
Dr. Shankerman began his medical career 
at Tulane Medical School where he was rec-
ognized as the ‘Most Compassionate Physi-
cian.’ He went on to complete his Internal 
Medicine residency at the Mayo Clinic in Min-
nesota. He practiced medicine in San Diego 
for eight years and served as associate clin-
ical professor of medicine at UCSD Medical 
School. He was a diplomat for the American 
Board of Internal Medicine and was certified 
as an HIV specialist. 
In 2000, Dr. Shankerman went to work at 
Clinica Sierra Vista in Bakersfield, California, 
where he served as Chief Medical Officer for 
ten years. For the last six years, he was re-
sponsible for supervising United Health Cen-
ter’s 70 primary care doctors, physician assist-
ants and nurse practitioners, and the quality of 
care for almost 125,000 patients. 
Dr. Shankerman was a valued member of 
our local health community, and it is with great 
pride that I recognize him for his service and 
dedication to the underserved communities of 
the Central Valley. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
United States House of Representatives to 
join me in honoring the life of Dr. Robert 
Shankerman.

HONORING THE LIFE OF JOHN 
NOLAN 
HON. JOHN KATKO 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 9, 2022 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
remember the life of John Nolan, a dedicated 
police investigator and beloved father and 
husband, who passed away on December 24, 
2021. 
John Nolan was a cherished member of the 
Central New York community, who attended 
Our Lady of Lourdes Elementary School as 
well as Bishop Ludden High School. John was 
a classmate of mine at Bishop Ludden and we 
remained friends. From an early age, John as-
pired to be a Syracuse Police Officer and ful-
filled his childhood dream after graduating 
from the Police Academy in 1986. 
With the Syracuse Police Department, John 
Nolan served with the Syracuse Police SWAT/ 
Hostage-Crisis Negotiation Team, the Criminal 
Investigations Division, Investigations Bureau, 
and Cold Case Investigation Unit. He also de-
voted much of his time to mentoring the next 
generation of police officers, holding positions 
at the Syracuse Police Academy and serving 
as a guest lecturer at local universities and 
colleges. Following his retirement from the 
Syracuse Police Department, John continued 
his passion for investigative work by joining 
the Onondaga County District Attorney’s office 
as a case investigator. 
As a former organized prosecutor, I had the 
pleasure of working alongside John Nolan. 
John was a consummate professional and had 
a dogged determination for justice. For his 
work, John received a number of awards in-
cluding the 1991 Syracuse Post 41 American 
Legion Police Officer of the Year, the 2001 
Post-Standard Award, the 2002 and 2003 
CNYCOP Law Enforcement Commendations, 
the 2004 PBA President’s Award, the 2007 
and 2016 Meritorious Service Awards, and the 
2018 District Attorney’s Distinguished Service 
Award. 
Outside of his career in law enforcement, 
John was an engaged member of his commu-
nity and a devoted husband to Patricia and fa-
ther to Delaney. John championed an active 
lifestyle as an avid golfer, runner, and annual 
competitor at the Syracuse Mountain Goat 
Run, missing only one in over 35 years to at-
tend his daughter’s first communion. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
House to join me in honoring the life of John 
Nolan. A beloved member of Syracuse’s law 
enforcement community, John will truly be 
missed. I ask my colleagues to keep him and 
his family in mind as we remember the con-
tributions of this public servant.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF GRADY 
WIGGINTON 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 9, 2022 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life and accom-
plishments of Grady Wigginton, as he passed 
away on January 31, 2022. 
Mr. Wigginton was born just west of 
Guntown, 
MS 
on 
June 
30, 
1937. 
Mr. 
Wigginton was proud to grow up in rural Mis-
sissippi where he was able to learn about the 
nature and creatures of God’s creation. After 
graduating from High school, Mr. Wigginton 
decided to join the USMC. In his time serving 
the country he achieved the great accomplish-
ment of being promoted to the rank of Ser-
geant (E–4) in just twenty-two months. He be-
lieved in God first, Country second, and family 
third. We thank him for his commitment to 
service. 
After Mr. Wigginton’s service to his country, 
he worked for CPI. At CPI he went on to be-
come both a district and regional manager. He 
enjoyed hiring and working with new employ-
ees as he saw it was his responsibility to moti-
vate them to do their jobs to the best of their 
ability. Due to his commitment to a hard-work-
ing staff, both his district and regional teams 
won multiple awards for sales and profit. 
Mr. Wigginton will be greatly missed, and 
we thank him for his service to his country and 
community.

HALL OF HONOR 
HON. STEVEN M. PALAZZO 
OF MISSISSIPPI

Wednesday, February 9, 2022 
Mr. PALAZZO. Madam Speaker, today, we 
celebrate the dedication and ribbon cutting 
ceremony for the Quinlan-Hammond Hall of 
Honor at the University of Southern Mis-
sissippi. 
The Quinlan-Hammond Hall of Honor is a 
state-of-the-art facility that represents the Uni-
versity of Southern Mississippi’s commitment 
to honor our nation’s heroes. The dedication 
ceremony will honor Joe Quinlan, USM alum-
nus and lead benefactor for the Hall of Honor, 
as well as U.S. Army Major General (Retired) 
Jeff Hammond, USM alumnus and former

earned this recognition for their service to the 
Golden Eagle community. 
The University’s Center for Military Vet-
erans, Service Members and Families pro-
vides guidance and support to Student-Vet-
erans in their academic and professional pur-
suits. Major General Jeff Hammond; who 
serves as the Center’s Director, has led the 
University of Southern Mississippi to earn nu-
merous prestigious recognitions, including the 
top Military Caring University across the State 
of Mississippi, designation as a Purple Heart 
Institution, and ranking No. 1 in the Southeast 
by Military Times in its ‘‘Best for Vets: Col-
leges 2021 Rankings.’’ 
The new Quinlan-Hammond Hall of Honor 
will provide more than 1,700 USM Military Stu-
dents and Student-Veterans with a home of 
their own that is commensurate with the honor 
of which they are deserving. 
Today is a special day. The dedication and 
ribbon cutting ceremony for the Quinlan-Ham-
mond Hall of Honor symbolizes the University 
of Southern Mississippi’s continued commit-
ment and gratitude to our nation’s heroes for 
their unwavering dedication to our country. As 
a veteran and USM alumnus, I want to thank 
the University’s Administration, the USM Foun-
dation, and the more than 150 USM alumni 
donors who made the construction of the new 
Quinlan-Hammond Hall of Honor possible for 
their commitment to honor those who serve.

Relations at the Sewerage and Water Board 
of New Orleans serving our great City over the 
past thirty-three years. His stellar work bene-
fitted directors Harold J. Gorman, Marcia A. 
St. Martin, Cedric Grant and Ghassan Karban, 
assuring the needs of their customers. 
Under his leadership, the Sewerage and 
Water Board’s Water Education Program for 
public and parochial schools in the City of 
New Orleans met EPA requirements for public 
information and community education, thereby 
providing compliance with Consent Decree re-
quirements for that component until recent 
years. 
During Mr. Jackson’s tenure at the Board, 
they successfully sponsored the Water Help 
Run/Walk-a-thon from 1992 to 1996 to help 
support the Water Help Program for elderly 
and handicapped in our community 
And in the days following Hurricane Katrina, 
Robert B. Jackson was instrumental in secur-
ing emergency fuel, satellite phones, supplies 
and equipment to help stabilize water oper-
ations during the emergency. Then, by the 
second week of September 2005, a temporary 
headquarters with forty-four offices was se-
cured, furnished and operational in order to 
provide continuity of service for displaced cus-
tomers and employees needing to connect 
with the Board. 
There are only a few employees who can 
credit their career to include entrusted service 
under five Mayors—Sidney J. Barthelemy, 
Marc H. Morial, C. Ray Nagin, Mitchell Lan-
drieu and LaToya Cantrell. 
The entire New Orleans community is grate-
ful to Mr. Jackson for his dedicated service, 
and I want to express my sincere congratula-
tions to him ahead of his well-deserved retire-
ment.

RECOGNIZING DR. BRENDA LEWIS 
HON. DAVID G. VALADAO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 9, 2022 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Dr. Brenda Lewis for her con-
tributions to the Kern High School District and 
congratulate her on her retirement. 
Dr. Lewis moved to Bakersfield, California, 
in August of 1988. She has spent the last 33 
years working for the Kern High School Dis-
trict. Her illustrious career consisted of serving 
her community as a teacher, coach, mentor, 
and administrator. She also serves on the 
Board of Directors for the Mediburu Magic 
Foundation and No Sister Left Behind and is 
a member of the Greater Harvest Christian 
Center Church where she serves as the presi-
dent of the Deaconess Board. 
Dr. Lewis has received several awards and 
recognitions for her excellent work. She re-
ceived the CSUB Athletic Director’s Apprecia-
tion Award, the Josephine Triplett Education & 
Leadership Award, the California Association 
of African American Superintendents & Admin-
istrators Award for Dedication & Devotion to 
Helping Students Achieve Excellence in Edu-
cation, the MLK Committee’s Sacrifices from 
the Heart Award, the Kern County Black 
Chamber of Commerce Certificate of Recogni-
tion, and was the Keynote Speaker for the 
2020 Martin Luther King Jr. Breakfast and 
Grand Marshal for the Bakersfield Black Amer-
ican History Parade. 
Dr. Lewis was the first African American and 
the first woman in the history of the Kern High 
School District to serve as Assistant/Associate 
Superintendent. These are just two of her 
many great accomplishments from her time in 
the Kern High School District. 
I ask my colleagues in the House of Rep-
resentatives to join me in recognizing Dr. 
Brenda Lewis for her contributions to the Kern 
County community and wishing her the best in 
retirement.

RECOGNIZING QUEEN ELIZABETH 
II 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 9, 2022 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I am grateful to recognize Queen 
Elizabeth’s 70th year on the British throne. 
She has been Great Britain’s head of state 
through 14 different American Presidents, 
meeting with 13 of them. I include in the 
RECORD, an article from The Washington 
Times of February 7, 2022 by Danica Kirka, 
celebrating Queen Elizabeth’s’ time on the 
throne. I appreciate Ambassador Karen Pierce 
for her service in Washington. 
I particularly appreciate the Queen’s service 
as I am a native of Charleston, South Caro-
lina, which is the most British city in North 
America founded by British settlers in 1670. 
As Co-Chairman of the U.K. Caucus, I was 
grateful to have hosted the Minister for the 
Armed Forces, James Heappey, of the U.K. 
Parliament, at the Capitol Hill Club last week 
for dinner, as we remain united in supporting 
the independence of Ukraine. 
QUEEN ELIZABETH II MARKS 70TH 
ANNIVERSARY OF HER RULE 
LONDON.—As the United Kingdom marked 
the 70th anniversary of Queen Elizabeth II’s 
rule on Sunday, the queen looked to the fu-
ture of the monarchy. 
In remarks delivered in time for Sunday 
morning’s front pages, the queen expressed a 
‘‘sincere wish’’ that Prince Charles’ wife, 
Camilla, should be known as ‘‘Queen Con-
sort’’ when her son succeeds her as expected. 
With those words the monarch sought to an-
swer once and for all questions about the 
status of Camilla, who was initially shunned 
by fans of the late Princess Diana, Charles’ 
first wife. 
‘‘The queen is such a realist and, you 
know, she’s got a business to run,’’ historian 
Robert Lacey said. ‘‘Well, they call it ‘The 
Firm,’ don’t they? And this really brings 
Camilla into the firm properly now and for 
the future.’’ 
It took years for many in Britain to for-
give Charles, whose admitted infidelity and 
long-time links to Camilla torpedoed his 
marriage to Diana. The popular, glamorous 
princess died in a Paris car crash in 1997, five 
years after the couple separated in a messy 
public split. But the public mood has soft-
ened since Charles married Camilla Parker 
Bowles in 2005. 
Now known as the Duchess of Cornwall, 
the 74–year-old Camilla has taken on roles at 
more than 100 charities, focusing on a wide 
range of issues including promoting literacy, 
supporting victims of domestic violence and 
helping the elderly. 
Her down-to-earth style and sense of 
humor eventually won over many Britons. 
Her warmth softened Charles’ stuffy image 
and made him appear more approachable, if 
not happier, as he cut ribbons, unveiled 
plaques and waited for his chance to reign. 
Charles, 73, has long made it clear that he 
wants Camilla to be known as queen when he 
ultimately succeeds his mother on the 
throne. In his own message congratulating 
the queen on her long years of service, 
Charles thanked his mother for her support. 
‘‘We are deeply conscious of the honour 
represented by my mother’s wish,’’ they 
said. ‘‘As we have sought together to serve 
and support Her Majesty and the people of 
our communities, my darling wife has been 
my own steadfast support throughout.’’ 
The queen’s comments are remarkable in 
that they brought back memories of one of 
the lowest moments of her 70 years on the 
throne. The royal family was widely criti-
cized for its initial silence in the aftermath 
of Diana’s death, with one national news-
paper proclaiming ‘‘Your People Are Suf-
fering. Speak to Us Ma’am.’’ 
In backing Charles and Camilla, the queen 
remembered the support she received from 
her husband, Prince Philip, who died last 
year after decades at her side, as well as the 
role her mother played as the wife of a king. 
‘‘I am fortunate to have had the steadfast 
and loving support of my family. I was 
blessed that, in Prince Philip, I had a part-
ner willing to carry out the role of consort 
and unselfishly make the sacrifices that go 
with it,’’ she wrote. ‘‘It is a role I saw my 
own mother perform during my father’s 
reign.’’ 
‘‘And when, in the fullness of time, my son 
Charles becomes King, I know you will give 
him and his wife Camilla the same support 
that you have given me.’’ 
But for now, the queen remains at work. 
On Sunday, Buckingham Palace released a 
photo of the monarch sitting in front of her 
official red dispatch box with government 
papers spread out before her. 
The 95–year-old monarch is expected to 
spend the day at Sandringham, the country 
estate in Norfolk where her father, King 
George VI, died suddenly on Feb. 6, 1952, 
making her queen. 
‘‘It is a sad day and one that reminds her 
of the close relationship she had with him,’’ 
said Lacey, the historical consultant to the 
Netflix series ‘‘The Crown.’’ 
‘‘(Sunday) is a day when, by tradition, she 
likes to go back to Sandringham, the coun-
try roots of the family,’’ he told The Associ-
ated Press. ‘‘He liked to consider himself the 
Squire of Sandringham, the King of Britain, 
but he’d go out and walk the fields, shoot the 
game. That’s what she remembers.’’ 
While Sunday’s anniversary is expected to 
be low-key, public celebrations of the mon-
arch’s platinum jubilee are scheduled for 
June, when the weather improves. The fes-
tivities will include a military parade, neigh-
borhood parties and a competition to create 
a new dessert—a mini extravaganza that will 
take place over a special four-day weekend 
June 2–5. 
The celebrations are meant to recognize 
the woman who became a symbol of stability 
for the U.K. as it navigated an age of uncer-
tainty. 
Britain’s 
longest-serving 
monarch, 
the 
only sovereign most Britons have ever 
known, she has been a constant presence as 
Britain navigated the end of empire, the 
swinging ’60s, the labor strife of the 1980s, 
international terrorism, Brexit and the 
COVID–19 pandemic. 
In her message, the queen promised to 
keep working for the U.K. and the Common-
wealth. 
‘‘As we mark this anniversary, it gives me 
pleasure to renew to you the pledge I gave in 
1947 that my life will always be devoted to 
your service,’’ she wrote.

REMEMBERING CONNER 
KURAHASHI 
HON. TED LIEU 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 9, 2022 
Mr. LIEU. Madam Speaker, I rise today with 
a heavy heart to honor the life of Mr. Conner 
Kurahashi, who passed away on January 22, 
2022. A beloved member of California’s 33rd 
Congressional District, he was known for his 
exemplary leadership skills, devotion to civic 
engagement, and commitment to community 
service. 
Conner was born on October 7, 1999, in 
Torrance, CA to Brian Kurahashi and Gay 
Koga. From a young age, Conner had a sense 
of compassion and supported others in their 
times of need. As an elementary and middle 
school student, he volunteered his time to help 
set up school assemblies, and he served as 
student body president in his senior year at 
West High School. As student body president, 
he ably represented his classmates at Tor-
rance City Council and Torrance Unified 
School District Board meetings. 
Always thinking of others and planning 
ahead, Conner was committed to documenting 
the activities of his high school classmates; he 
had stashed photos and videos for their 10– 
year high school reunion. Even after gradua-
tion, he continued to document his sister’s 
achievements on the girls’ basketball team 
and the school’s track and field meets. Conner 
had a hand in many campus activities: fund- 
raising, taking photos, painting signs, and vol-
unteering with the Kiwanis International orga-
nization. He was also a multi-sport athlete, 
playing volleyball and basketball, as well as 
running track and cross-country. 
As a student at California Polytechnic Uni-
versity, Pomona, Conner helped plan basket-
ball games and tournaments, dances, over-
night ski trips, leadership conferences, and 
community service events with his fraternity, 
Pi Kappa Phi. He also served as Chief Com-
munications Officer for the Nikkei Student 
Union. Conner was to graduate this spring 
with a bachelor’s degree in urban and regional 
planning. 
To friends and family, Conner will be re-
membered for his love of cooking, gardening, 
and even building a personal computer from 
scratch. Conner also loved basketball from an 
early age, playing for community youth teams 
and coaching them as he got older. 
Conner is survived by his parents, Brian and 
Gay; sister, Bailey; and grandmother, Kazuko 
Kurahashi. I ask my colleagues to join me in 
extending our thoughts and condolences to 
the Kurahashi family as they try to deal with 
this tragic loss. May Conner’s memory live on 
in all those he touched through his life.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE LATE 
NATHAN WENDEL GRAY 
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 9, 2022 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Nathan Gray, who lost his bat-
tle with childhood cancer on January 6, 2022. 
In his eight years of life, Nathan’s courage, 
positivity, and bright smile inspired many, 
raised awareness for childhood cancer, and 
banded a community together, inspiring others 
to do good. 
Nathan was born on July 16, 2013 to Jeffrey 
and Patricia Gray, and he was the beloved 
brother of ten year old Jeffrey and six year old 
Natalie. When Nathan was two years old, he 
was diagnosed with Wilms tumor, a rare form 
of kidney cancer. He fought cancer with the 
bravery of a superhero, enduring 221 doses of 
chemotherapy, 26 surgeries, 33 days of radi-
ation, an oral inhibitor, and more than 100 
blood platelet transfusions. Despite the chal-
lenges of his illness, Nathan attended St. 
Nicholas-St. Mary’s School and enjoyed swim-
ming, playing video games, and riding his 
bike. 
Nathan’s bravery and joy garnered local at-
tention in August 2016 when the Facebook 
page ‘‘Nathan the Super Hero’’ was started by 
his family lo document his battle with cancer. 
Thousands of people have followed the page, 
sharing words of encouragement. celebrating 
the joyful moments, and offering comfort and 
support during the challenging ones. Nathan 
quickly became a local celebrity, inspiring 
members of the community with his infectious 
simile and relentless courage. The community 
rallied around Nathan. cheering him on and 
making him feel special. In February 2020, the 
Wilkes-Barre Area Wolfpack named him hon-
orary team captain before they played their in-
augural home game at Wilkes-Barre Memorial 
Stadium. In August 2020, Wilkes-Barre police 
and fire department vehicles paraded past his 
home while well-wishers delivered gifts, and, 
in December 2021, carolers visited Nathan to 
spread some Christmas cheer. Just last 
month, the Wilkes-Barre council unanimously 
voted to rename the Barney Farms Park in 
Nathan’s honor. 
Nathan’s family’s willingness to be open and 
share their son’s experiences with Wilms 
tumor helped shed important light on the issue 
of childhood cancer and the need for more ag-
gressive research and increased funding for 
prevention and cures—so that children like 
Nathan do not have to suffer. 
I am honored to recognize the life and leg-
acy of this brave young man. Nathan’s mem-
ory will live on with his beloved family and 
friends and the large community that he in-
spired with his determination and positivity.

HONORING THE HONORABLE SHIR-
LEY ANITA ST. HILL CHISHOLM 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 9, 2022 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor and pay tribute to a trail-
blazer, icon, educator, and social activist, The 
Honorable Shirley Anita St. Hill Chisholm. 
The daughter of immigrants, ‘‘Fighting Shir-
ley’’ (as she became known) was the second 
African American in the New York Legislature 
(1964), the first African American woman to 
serve in the U.S. Congress (1968), and the 
first woman and African American to seek the 
nomination for the Presidency of the United 
States from one of the two major political par-
ties (1972). During her impressive tenure in 
Congress, she introduced over 50 pieces of 
legislation and was a staunch advocate for 
education, expanding minimum wage stand-
ards, racial and gender equality, combating 
poverty, and ending the Vietnam War. She 
also co-founded the National Women’s Polit-
ical Caucus (1971) and became the first Black 
woman and the second woman to ever serve 
on the House Rules Committee. After she re-
tired from Congress in 1983, she went on to 
teach at Mount Holyoke College and later lec-
ture in Palm Coast, Florida. 
Shirley Chisholm is known quite often for 
the quotes, ‘‘Service is the rent that we pay for 
the space that we occupy here on this earth.’’ 
‘‘If they don’t give you a seat at the table, 
bring a folding chair.’’ She was a formidable 
woman who fought against the odds (sexism 
and racial discrimination) during her career, in-
spired the future generation of leaders, and 
paved the way for others looking to pursue a 
career in politics and/or public service. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
House of Representatives to join my wife, Viv-
ian, and me, along with the more than 
730,000 people of the Second Congressional 
District and the distinguished members of the 
Congressional Black Caucus, in paying tribute 
to the life and legacy of The Honorable Shirley 
Anita St. Hill Chisholm.

Wednesday, February 9, 2022 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Jamie Connell of the Bu-
reau of Land Management (BLM) for her serv-
ice to our country and wish her well on her re-
tirement. 
For more than 37 years, Jamie has served 
the constituents of the State of Colorado and 
other states with her public service. With most 
of the BLM public lands concentrated in Colo-
rado’s Western Slope, Jamie oversaw more 
than 8.3 million acres of public land and 27 
million acres of federal mineral estate in Colo-
rado, ranging from alpine tundra, colorful can-
yons and sagebrush steppe to mountains ris-
ing more than 14,000 feet above sea level. 
During her time in Colorado, Montana, North 
Dakota, South Dakota, Idaho, Wyoming, Or-
egon, Washington, and the District of Colum-
bia, she tirelessly worked to improve and 
many areas of natural resource management. 
In her role, she has worked constructively with 
officials in the legislative and judicial branches 
of federal and state government as well as 
with industry and non-profit partners. 
Jamie’s hard work and dedication has been 
tremendous. I wish Jamie all the best in retire-
ment and send gratitude for her service to our 
community, the State of Colorado, and the 
United States of America.

Maggie has remained at the same station 
where she was first hired as a senior at Mis-
sissippi College. She is the 89th member of 
her extended family to attend Jackson State 
University. She is the oldest of seven children. 
Maggie was planning to go to law school; she 
wanted to be a corporate attorney. She never 
intended to be in television because every-
thing that she learned was preparing her for a 
law career. 
Maggie landed an interview with Randy Bell 
at Miss 103/WDJX. She was hired for the po-
sition as a weekend News Anchor/Radio An-
nouncer. She was also in school full time at 
Mississippi College. While working at WDJX/ 
Miss 103, a weekend weather opening be-
came available at WLBT. She was introduced 
to Woodie Assaf at WLBT and went through 
the interview process for the position. 
She received the job at WLBT, and this has 
been her employment since then. She fell in 
love with the media and the power of the 
media to bring change. Maggie gives all glory 
to God and speaks about how God had this 
planned for her. The first assignment for 
Maggie was at the University of Mississippi 
Medical Center inside the Children’s Hospital. 
She was in love with the children and the sup-
port from her colleague. 
Maggie’s favorite quote is from Maya 
Angelou, ‘‘People may forget what you did, 
they may forget what you said, but they’ll 
never forget how you made them feel.’’ She 
uses this quote because when you can do a 
story, when you can cover an event, no matter 
what that event is, and it touches the heart of 
people, you’ve done a good job. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life, legacy, and service of 
Ms. Maggie Wade.

RECOGNIZING THE BAKERSFIELD 
BLACK AMERICAN HISTORY PA-
RADE COMMITTEE 
HON. DAVID G. VALADAO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 9, 2022 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the Bakersfield Black American 
History Parade Committee on their 17th year 
organizing and facilitating this annual event. 
The Bakersfield Black American History Pa-
rade was founded in 2005 by Gloria Patterson. 
The parade boosts local awareness and high-
lights the rich heritage and valuable contribu-
tions of African Americans. It provides a cul-
turally inspired and community-wide celebra-
tion of the African American heritage. Local 
businesses and organizations interact with pa-
rade attendees and introduce them to re-
sources available throughout Kern County and 
California. The committee also works with the 
Sickle Cell Disease Foundation and Black His-
tory 365 to help familiarize the community with 
services and resources. 
In addition, the Bakersfield Black American 
History Parade Committee is committed to 
supporting educational institutions that raise 
awareness of the valuable contributions of the 
African American community. 
I ask my colleagues in the House of Rep-
resentatives to join me in honoring the Bakers-
field Black American History Parade Com-
mittee and their service to the Bakersfield 
community. 
HONORING DR. DUDLEY FLOOD 
HON. DEBORAH K. ROSS 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 9, 2022 
Ms. ROSS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the service and career of Dr. Dudley 
Flood, a recipient of North Carolina’s highest 
civilian award, The North Carolina Award for 
Public Service, for his trailblazing leadership in 
desegregating our state’s public schools. 
Born in Winton, North Carolina and a grad-
uate of North Carolina Central University, Dr. 
Flood began his career as an educator teach-
ing grade school and eventually became a 
principal. 
Following his teaching tenure, Dr. Flood 
joined the North Carolina Department of Public 
Instruction, where he made a significant im-
pact during his 21 years of dedicated service. 
In the years following the landmark 1954 
Brown v. Board of Education decision, Dr. 
Flood and the late Gene Causby were tasked 
with facilitating the desegregation of schools in 
all 100 counties of North Carolina. 
In 1969, Dr. Flood and Mr. Causby began to 
travel across the state to help desegregate 
North Carolina school systems. Beyond the 
assistance they provided in navigating this 
challenging process, it was the visual of these 
two men—one black, one white—working 
closely together that made a powerful impres-
sion on teachers and students alike. 
Through his honorable work, Dr. Flood be-
came a state hero and North Carolina became 
a model for school desegregation. 
By working to ensure that North Carolina is 
a place where all students can learn irrespec-
tive of race, Dr. Flood helped to bring together 
starkly divided communities and effectively 
ushered in a new era for public education in 
our state. 
Dr. Flood retired from public instruction in 
1990. Since then, he has served as Executive 
Director of the North Carolina Association of 
School Administrators, taught as a visiting pro-
fessor at multiple North Carolina colleges and 
universities, and continued to be an active 
community member. 
Now 90 years old, Dr. Flood has led an in-
credible career as a champion for equitable 
education. Today his achievements can be 
seen in schools statewide, as children of all 
races are able to learn and play together and 
support each other’s academic success. 
As we begin celebrating Black History 
Month, I am honored to share his extraor-
dinary legacy with this body. He enhanced the 
lives of hundreds of thousands of North Caro-
linians through his many achievements. 
The people of our state are forever grateful 
for the remarkable life and lasting legacy of 
Dr. Flood.

POST

RENAMING 
THE 
‘‘LYNN C. WOOLSEY POST OF-
FICE BUILDING’’ 
HON. BARBARA LEE 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 9, 2022 
Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, I 
am proud to support a bill to honor my friend 
and fellow Californian, former Congresswoman 
Lynn Woolsey, by designating the historic 
downtown post office in Petaluma the ‘‘Lynn 
Woolsey Post Office Building.’’ 
Congresswoman Woolsey is remembered in 
Congress as an unabashed advocate for a 
fairer, more equitable society. As the self-de-
scribed ‘‘first former welfare mom to serve in 
Congress,’’ she was part of a historic wave of 
female leadership in Congress, blazing a trail 
for women for generations to come. 
Congresswoman Woolsey served on the 
House Budget Committee, the Government 
Operations Committee, and the Education and 
Labor Committee, which helped cement her 
role as an effective leader in advancing edu-
cation and welfare reform and ending gender 
discrimination. She was also a powerful leader 
in women’s rights and equality. In fact, she 
played a critical role in the establishment of 
Women’s History Month, an important tradition 
to honor the extraordinary women who paved 
the way for many of us today. 
As co-chair of the Congressional Progres-
sive Caucus, Congresswoman Woolsey tire-
lessly fought to strengthen social safety net 
programs in an effort to elevate the voices of 
those most vulnerable. 
Furthermore, 
Congresswoman 
Woolsey 
was, and still is, a courageous advocate for 
peace who opposed the Iraq War from the be-
ginning, and who was once arrested at a dem-
onstration in Washington, D.C., along with the 
late Congressman John Lewis, to call attention 
to the genocide in Darfur. 
Congresswoman Woolsey has been, and 
continues to be, a progressive champion and 
I am incredibly pleased to honor her two-dec-
ade-long career of good public service by vot-
ing for the passage of this bill.

INTRODUCTION 
OF 
THE 
COM-
BATING IMPLICIT BIAS IN EDU-
CATION ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 9, 2022 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today I in-
troduce the Combating Implicit Bias in Edu-
cation Act. This bill would create a $30 million 
grant program for schools to train teachers, 
principals and other personnel on implicit bias 
with respect to actual or perceived race, reli-
gion, sex (including sexual orientation and 
gender identity), disability, ethnicity and socio-
economic status. 
In 2019, a report by the U.S. Commission 
on Civil Rights found that students of color 
with disabilities received far more severe and 
frequent punishment than their white counter-
parts. 
In 2017, the Georgetown Law Center on 
Poverty and Inequality released a report find-
ing that people think of Black girls as more 
adult-like and less innocent compared to their 
white peers. This bias has been linked to 
harsher treatment of Black girls in schools. 
Students experiencing implicit bias and even 
outright discrimination face far greater expul-
sion and suspension rates, fueling the school- 
to-prison pipeline and widening the student 
achievement gap. 
This bill aims to reduce the impact of implicit 
bias on school discipline and academic

HONORING THE LIFE OF DR. 
JAMYE COLEMAN WILLIAMS 
HON. SHONTEL M. BROWN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 9, 2022 
Ms. BROWN of Ohio. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the life and legacy of Dr. 
Jamye Coleman Williams, who passed away 
peacefully on January 19, 2022. I extend my 
sincerest condolences to her daughter, Donna, 
her extended family and friends, and all who 
knew and loved her. 
Born in Louisville in 1918, Dr. Williams 
made remarkable contributions to academia, 
the church, and her community across her in-
spiring 103-year life. Her trailblazing legacy is 
a testament not only to the progress of Amer-
ica but also to the ability of bold individuals— 
specifically brave Black women—to drive the 
change they wish to seek. 
Across her decades-long teaching career at 
HBCUs, including Ohio’s own Wilberforce Uni-
versity, Dr. Williams made key contributions to 
rhetorical studies, a field long dominated by 
the study of white male orators. In fact, her 
dissertation on Thurgood Marshall’s Argu-
ments before the Supreme Court in the Public 
School Segregation controversy was published 
in 1959 by the Ohio State University, where 
she was earning her Ph.D. 
In addition to her academic career, Dr. Wil-
liams was a lifelong member of the A.M.E. 
church. While remaining active in her local 
church, Dr. Williams served as a board mem-
ber of the National Council of Churches and 
later as editor of The A.M.E. Church Review, 
the oldest African American literary journal. 
She also helped to break glass ceilings by 
supporting Vashti McKenzie’s election as the 
first female A.M.E. bishop. 
A tireless community activist, Dr. Williams 
moved from early involvement in the civil 
rights movement to later serving as a member 
of the NAACP’s Executive Committee. In 
1999, she received the organization’s Presi-
dential Award for her critical contributions. 
Dr. Williams’ legacy of service, activism and 
education will live on through the students, 
colleagues and countless individuals she 
touched. Her commitment to doing her part to 
advance justice and equality for women and 
people of color serves as a shining example 
for us all. 
Today, may we honor the memory of Dr. 
Jamye Coleman Williams, a loving wife, an 
impactful educator, a committed community 
activist, and a lifelong church leader.

HONORING UNITED STATES AIR 
FORCE CAPTAIN SALEHA JABEEN 
HON. ILHAN OMAR 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 9, 2022 
Ms. OMAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the extraordinary work of U.S. Air Force 
Captain Saleha Jabeen. Captain Jabeen is the 
only woman Imam in the United States Air 
Force, and she has been working diligently as 
a cultural advisor and chaplain as part of Op-
eration Allies Welcome at Holloman Air Force 
Base in New Mexico. 
Brigadier General Dan Gabrielli of the Min-
nesota National Guard has been the com-
manding officer at Holloman since August of 
last year, and I had the enormous privilege of 
being briefed by General Gabrielli, his leader-
ship team, and Captain Jabeen on the incred-
ible effort they’ve been engaged in to ensure 
that we live up to our promise to the Afghan 
refugees under their care. 
Madam Speaker, Captain Jabeen rep-
resents the very best of the generous spirit of 
the American people. Her infectious charisma, 
boundless 
energy, 
deep 
cultural 
under-
standing, and tireless dedication to helping Af-
ghan refugees acclimate to their new home 
have made her indispensable to Operation Al-
lies Welcome. We are all fortunate to have 
had her in this position, ensuring that we have 
lived up to our cherished values of hospitality 
and providing safe haven to those in need. 
As a refugee myself, I am intensely aware 
of the importance of creating a sense of com-
munity during the disorienting process of re-
settlement. Captain Jabeen has been essen-
tial in creating that sense of community at 
Holloman. I want to express my deep admira-
tion and profound gratitude for her dedication 
to public service, for the support she has 
given to the Guardsmen and women from my 
district who have also been dedicating them-
selves to this crucial mission, and, most im-
portantly, for the many lives she has changed 
permanently for the better.

HONORING DIANE HORN AS IOWAN 
OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 9, 2022 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
ask the House of Representatives to join me 
in recognizing Diane Horn, a Volunteer In-
come Tax Assistant with Lutheran Services of 
Iowa, as our Iowan of the Week. 
As we enter a new tax filing season, I can’t 
help but to think of all the Iowans out there 
who are looking for help getting their taxes 
filed. Every day, I hear first-hand accounts of 
the challenges that taxpayers in Iowa are fac-
ing. While many of the challenges they’re fac-
ing arise after filing their returns, many Iowans 
still explain to me that their problems could 
have been avoided had they not had issues 
with filing in the first place. That is why I am 
so proud to honor Diane Horn today. 
Diane volunteers with Lutheran Services of 
Iowa (LSI) in their Volunteer Income Tax As-
sistance (VITA) program. She started volun-
teering about six years ago with another orga-
nization in Iowa, greeting folks who were com-
ing in for service appointments. Diane pre-
viously held a career as an IT Manager, but in 
her second year of volunteering, she decided 
to learn more about tax preparation. Diane 
took classes and eventually took the tests re-
quired through the IRS to earn her certifi-
cation. 
Diane then started volunteering with LSI, 
where she started helping folks file their taxes. 
She explained how rewarding this experience 
is, and how she genuinely feels the impact of 
the help she is providing to those in need. 
Diane describes everyone she works with as 
being so grateful. Many of the people who 
come to her are refugees or immigrants, and 
many of them cannot speak and/or read 
English. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has impacted 
every single industry in our nation’s economy, 
and it also had an impact on the work that LSI 
could carry out. Diane explained that working 
remotely came with its own unique challenges, 
but most of all, she missed being able to see 
and chat with everyone who made appoint-
ments with her. She loves hearing everyone’s 
story, no matter the circumstances. It makes 
the work she does that much more gratifying 
knowing that she is truly making a difference 
for those who are in need. 
The work Diane does is so incredibly vital to 
communities across Iowa’s third district. The 
tax process is one that many Americans feel 
is complicated and difficult to fully understand. 
Diane helps ease those concerns and anxi-
eties. Her dedication to helping those in need 
is commendable, and it is why I am so hon-
ored to name Diane Horn Iowan of the Week.

Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I rise

the 60th Air Mobility Wing, the 349th Air Mobil-
ity Wing, the 621st Contingency Response

of representing as part of California’s Third 
Congressional District. They exemplify the 
best of America, and their tireless efforts guar-
antee the safety of all those who call America 
home.

and stability in the Indo-Pacific region and pro-
viding support to American troops around the

thanks to the blood, sweat, and fortitude of the 
18,000 airmen and their families that maintain 
the highest levels of readiness and capability. 
Every single day this all-volunteer force pro-
vides essential aerial refueling, airlift oper-
ations, aeromedical evacuation, highly special-
ized rapid response contingency operations 
capabilities, 
and 
unmatched 
support 
to 
produce and execute rapid global mobility in 
support of our national defense. 
Last year alone the men and women of 
Travis Air Force Base met a challenge of co-
lossal scale when they played a pivotal role in 
completing the drawdown of forces from Af-
ghanistan. Team Travis aircrews evacuated 
12,962 Afghans while managing security and 
operations at the airport in Kabul. 
The valor and heroism displayed by the 
men and women of Travis was imitable and 
worthy of recognition. Last month, I spoke with 
Captain Kayleigh Migalesdi, who helped evac-
uate 117 orphan children from the region dur-
ing Operation Allies Refuge. She spoke about 
how she would have been at the Abbey Gate 
the moment a suicide bomber killed 13 Ameri-
cans had it not been for an orphaned child 
who needed her assistance elsewhere on 
base. With tears in her eyes, she told me that 
she owed her life to that child, who she later 
helped reach safety and begin a new life. 
Capt. Migalesdi’s story is just one of the many 
stories I heard that exemplify the character, 
leadership, and bravery that is cultivated at 
Travis Air Force Base. Service records only 
scratch the surface of the courageous actions 
performed by these men and women. They 
put their hearts and lives on the line to save 
so many. I am grateful every day that I have 
the opportunity to represent such an upstand-
ing community in Congress. 
This total force effort of active and reserve 
airmen directly enabled the largest non-
combatant evacuation operation in known 
world history, ultimately saving over 124,000 
lives. Simply put, Travis Air Force Base is the 
very best our Nation has to offer. Its strategic 
importance stands as a beacon of hope to our 
allies and a stern reminder of American re-
solve to our enemies. On behalf of a grateful 
Nation and all the constituents of California’s 
Third Congressional District, I would like to 
thank the men and women of Travis Air Force 
Base and express my sincere gratitude for 
their sacrifice and contributions to the defense 
of this great Nation.

CELEBRATING BLACK HISTORY 
MONTH 
HON. FRANK J. MRVAN 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 9, 2022 
Mr. MRVAN. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great respect and sincere admiration that I rise 
today to celebrate Black History Month and its 
2022 theme—Black Health and Wellness. 
This year’s theme recognizes the achieve-
ments and initiatives of African Americans in 
healthcare while simultaneously highlighting 
the disparities that still exist in our country. As 
we reflect on the past, we must examine how 
race and racism have created additional bar-
riers for African American health outcomes. 
Specific to Northwest Indiana, I would like to 
take a moment to recognize and commemo-
rate the notable achievements of Dr. Clarence 
Boone, a well-known obstetrician-gynecologist 
and leader in our region’s medical community. 
Dr. Boone was born and raised in Gary, In-
diana. He graduated from Froebel High School 
in Gary in 1949 and went on to attend Indiana 
University—where he earned a degree in 
anatomy and physiology. He then made his-
tory as one of five Black students enrolled at 
the Indiana University School of Medicine in 
1952. 
After medical school, Dr. Boone returned to 
his hometown in Gary and spent his career 
advocating for African Americans and women 
in the medical field. He served as President of 
the Medical Staff of Methodist Hospital and as 
Medical Director for Planned Parenthood of 
Northwest Indiana. Dr. Boone is remembered 
as a community mentor who was committed to 
providing medical service to individuals who 
would not otherwise have access to it. 
While we have made progress to improve 
access to affordable health care options, there 
still is a long way to go. Generations of strict 
geographical segregation have left many hos-
pitals and medical care centers that continue 
to serve African American communities under- 
resourced and under-staffed. 
Evident prior to the COVID–19 pandemic, 
and certainly emphasized by it, these short-
ages have resulted in African Americans being 
more susceptible to illness, less likely to re-
ceive adequate treatment, and placed further 
at-risk for complications. 
While I appreciate the milestones reached 
through the passage of the Affordable Care 
Act, more must be done to improve access to 
affordable health care and decrease the gap 
in health-related outcomes for African Ameri-
cans. 
With this year’s celebration of Black History 
Month, let us honor Dr. Boone from Gary and 
all African American scholars and medical pro-
fessionals who have played such a monu-
mental role with their contributions to health 
care in the state of Indiana and throughout our 
country, and let us recommit to ending health 
disparities for African Americans that still exist 
today.

RECOGNIZING THE MINTER FIELD 
AIR MUSEUM 
HON. DAVID G. VALADAO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 9, 2022 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the Minter Field Air Museum on 
the 80th anniversary of the dedication of Mint-
er Field Army Air Corps Base. 
Minter Field began operations in June of 
1941. By 1942, the base had become one of 
the largest training bases on the west coast. 
Nearly 12,000 pilots received basic training 
and over 7,000 personnel manned the field 
during its years of operation. During World 
War II, more than 11,000 Army Air Corps Ca-
dets graduated from Minter Field. These ca-
dets went on to fly around the globe and in all 
theaters of the war. 
On February 7, 1942, the base was named 
in honor of First Lieutenant Hugh C. Minter, a 
World War I veteran that lost his life in a colli-
sion over March Field in July 1932. 
Minter Field Air Museum is located in the 
base’s original fire station. The Museum has 
compiled a database of over 11,500 names of 
cadets and staff, as well as a DVD library of 
over 900 hours of military and aviation videos. 
Their preservation efforts will allow Kern 
County to continue to honor the veterans who 
trained at Minter Field Army Air Corps Base 
for many years to come. 
I ask my colleagues in the House of Rep-
resentatives to join me in recognizing Minter 
Field Air Museum for its dedication to pre-
serving the history of Minter Field and Kern 
County aviation.
