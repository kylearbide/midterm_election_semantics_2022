TAKING BIPARTISAN ACTION TO 
PROTECT CHILDREN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Massachusetts (Mrs. TRAHAN) for 5 
minutes. 
Mrs. TRAHAN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of two pieces of bipar-
tisan legislation the House will con-
sider later today. I introduced these 
bills alongside Republican colleagues 
because there is simply no question 
that they will save lives and protect 
our children. 
The first piece of legislation is crit-
ical in the fight against the opioid cri-
sis plaguing every single community 
across our country. Known as the 
MATE Act, this legislation is simple. It 
will require that doctors who prescribe 
highly addictive pain medications are 
trained to spot signs of addiction and 
intervene accordingly. 
Healthcare professionals often inter-
act with and have opportunities to pro-
vide effective treatments for individ-
uals suffering from addiction, critical 
opportunities to save lives. But far too 
often, those chances to help are missed. 
In fact, research has shown that most 
clinicians could not confidently diag-
nose and treat patients with substance 
use disorder. 
Stigma, discrimination, and lack of 
understanding about addiction have 
prevented far too many Americans 
from accessing evidence-based care for 
addiction. The MATE Act will change 
that. 
I drafted this legislation after meet-
ing with a physician in my home State 
of Massachusetts, Dr. Jim Baker, who 
shared the tragic story of his son, Max. 
Dr. Baker was visiting his primary 
care physician one day when his PCP 
asked him if there was anything he 
could do to help. Dr. Baker pleaded 
with his PCP for help with Max’s 
opioid addiction. 
To Dr. Baker’s surprise, his PCP did 
not have adequate education or under-
standing of addiction to point Dr. 
Baker in the direction of appropriate 
treatment for Max. Max Baker died 
from an overdose at just 23 years old. 
Every person in this Chamber knows 
that the Bakers’ story, a parent’s worst 
nightmare, is not unique. Each of us 
has heard similar stories from families 
who were willing to do anything and 
everything to save the life of a loved 
one battling addiction. We can get 
these families another path for help by 
passing the MATE Act. 
I am grateful to Dr. Baker for his ad-
vocacy for this legislation, as well as 
my colleagues, Representatives TRONE, 
CARTER, KUSTER, and MCKINLEY, who 
were instrumental in securing today’s 
vote. 
Madam Speaker, the second piece of 
legislation is just as essential. My bi-
partisan bill, with Ranking Member 
MCMORRIS
RODGERS, Congresswoman 
AXNE, and Congresswoman KIM, doesn’t 
need a fancy name. It just needs to be-
come law. That is because it will ex-
tend and strengthen key youth and 
young adult suicide prevention efforts. 
Many of us have talked about the 
youth mental health crisis extensively, 
and the past 2 years have only in-
creased the urgent need for solutions 
that protect our children. 
That starts by reauthorizing the Gar-
rett Lee Smith Memorial Act and the 
key programs it supports to provide 
mental health resources, bolster sui-
cide prevention efforts, and end the 
stigma associated with getting help. 
Make no mistake, these programs 
have a long track record of success. 
Study after study has proven that 
these initiatives have significantly re-
duced youth suicide rates for young 
people and saved tens of thousands of 
lives. 
We must ensure that these programs 
continue, and I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislative package so we 
can do just that. 
IBEW 1505 CELEBRATES 50 YEARS AT RAYTHEON 
Mrs. TRAHAN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the hardworking 
men and women of the International 
Brotherhood 
of 
Electrical 
Workers 
Local 1505 for their 75 years working at 
Raytheon in Massachusetts. 
The members of IBEW 1505 are some 
of the most skilled in the manufac-
turing industry in the entire world. 
They are unsung American heroes, 
rarely receiving publicity or recogni-
tion for their devoted service and inge-
nuity but continuing to provide well- 
made defense systems to American 
Armed Forces. 
The Patriot missile is built by the 
members of IBEW 1505, along with

other advanced defense systems. These 
systems are active around the world, 
including right now in Poland, where 
they are helping to protect our NATO 
allies. 
IBEW 1505 has provided many genera-
tions of families in Massachusetts with 
family-sustaining wages and benefits. 
I am proud to call so many members 
of IBEW 1505 my constituents and to 
bring recognition of their 75 years of 
service to our country here on the 
House floor of the United States Con-
gress.

CONGRATULATING CENTRAL HIGH 
SCHOOL DRAGONS AND EVERETT 
HIGH SCHOOL WARRIORS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to congratulate 
the Central High School Dragons and 
the Everett High School Warriors base-
ball teams on winning the PIAA Class 
3A and Class 2A championships, respec-
tively. 
Through practice, hard work, and de-
termination, 
these 
teams 
battled 
through difficult seasons in order to 
seize their championship victories. 
For the Central High School Drag-
ons, their championship came after an 
undefeated season. For the Everett 
Warriors, a hard-fought 1–0 victory in 
the final game of the year was needed 
in order to raise the championship tro-
phy. 
For both these teams, their refusal to 
quit when games were close is a testa-
ment to their commitment, to their 
communities, and to each other as 
players. 
I am proud of what these young men 
have accomplished, and I look forward 
to seeing their continued success as 
they embark on careers. 
END THE SOUTHERN BORDER CRISIS 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, in the past 50 years, we have 
seen such change on our southern bor-
der. In the past 10 years, we have con-
tinued to see changes on our southern 
border. 
Madam Speaker, 50 individuals on 
the FBI terrorist watch list have been 
apprehended on our southern border. 
Madam Speaker, 50 potential terror-
ists, with only the intent to harm 
American citizens, have been appre-
hended on our southern border. 
What is President Biden’s response? 
To leave our border wall unfinished and 
our citizens vulnerable to attack. 
We cannot allow these open border 
policies to continue. We cannot allow 
these terrorists to continue to enter 
the United States through a porous and 
vulnerable southern border. 
Now, with a potential surge of more 
than 18,000 migrants expected to cross 
the border if title 42 is repealed, more 
terrorists will attempt to enter our 
country. 
It is time to secure our border. It is 
time to codify title 42. It is time to put 
an end to this crisis. 
CELEBRATING THE PULP AND PA-
PERWORKERS’ RESOURCE COUN-
CIL’S 30TH ANNIVERSARY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Oregon (Mr. SCHRADER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. SCHRADER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the Pulp and 
Paperworkers’ Resource Council on its 
30th anniversary. 
The PPRC is a grassroots organiza-
tion made up of hourly employees of 
the U.S. forest products industry whose 
members work in mills and converting 
plants, 
manufacturing 
sustainable 
paper and wood products that Ameri-
cans rely on every day. 
Founded in 1991, the PPRC works to 
ensure real-world perspectives are con-
sidered in all policy and regulatory de-
cisions that impact their jobs and our 
communities. 
As co-chair of the bipartisan, bi-
cameral House Paper and Packaging 
Caucus, I am honored to meet with the 
PPRC representatives every year when 
they come to Washington, D.C., to ad-
vocate for their priorities and promote 
this important sector of our economy. 
I am pleased to congratulate the 
PPRC for 30 years of hard work on be-
half of such an essential industry. 
f 
MAKE EVERY STATE A RIGHT-TO- 
WORK STATE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, though 
what I am about to say will surely 
cause a strong case of hypertension 
among my Democrat colleagues and 
their union allies, I won’t hold back: 
Unions didn’t build the middle class in 
America. 
Entrepreneurs 
and 
hard-
working Americans did. 
Tomorrow marks the 75th anniver-
sary of the landmark legislation that 
enables States to pass right-to-work 
laws, and it is a cause for celebration. 
Since 1947, 27 States have decided to 
allow employees to choose for them-
selves whether to belong to a union or 
not. What a smart decision passing 
right-to-work laws was, Madam Speak-
er. They give workers the freedom to 
make their own choices when it comes 
to paying union dues. 
With rising inflation and gas prices, 
workers should not be forced to hand 
their hard-earned paychecks over to 
the unions in order to keep their jobs. 
Time and again, unions prove that 
worker representation plays second fid-
dle to a partisan political agenda that 
comes as no surprise to anyone. 
For example, the AFL–CIO’s finan-
cial disclosure form shows that they 
spent more than $37 million on polit-
ical activity and lobbying while spend-
ing just $16 million to represent work-
ers. Workers should never be forced to 
fund political causes they disagree 
with. 
The truth is, right-to-work laws are 
good for unions, too. Making union 
membership a choice instead of a man-
datory condition of employment im-
proves unions by making them more 
responsive to worker needs. 
It is no secret that unions in manda-
tory dues States neglect the needs of 
workers. It isn’t until unions have to 
fight to get and keep members that 
they make workers a priority. Giving 
workers a choice gives workers lever-
age, and this can lead to more trans-
parency and accountability. 
The truth is that right-to-work laws 
are good for the economy and bolster 
industries. Data shows that States 
with right-to-work laws have lower un-
employment and higher job and wage 
growth than States without such laws. 
Worker freedom leads to flourishing. 
What a concept, Madam Speaker. 
One study shows that right-to-work 
States attract more manufacturing and 
construction jobs than States with 
compulsory union membership. States 
which have enacted right-to-work laws 
in the past 22 years have a 20.7 percent 
higher manufacturing share than they 
would have if they did not protect 
worker freedom. According to the Na-
tional Right to Work Committee, fac-
tory employment rose by 150,000 in 
right-to-work States in 2021 alone. 
These numbers speak for themselves. 
Being pro-right-to-work means being 
progrowth. 
In the face of such overwhelming 
positive figures, I find it mind-boggling 
that Democrats want to push the rad-
ical Protecting the Right to Organize 
Act, the PRO Act. The PRO Act would 
overturn 
right-to-work 
laws 
in 
27 
States and force workers to line the 
wallets of union bosses. 
PRO Act policies will undermine 
worker choice, burden employers, and 
harm our economy for years to come. 
That is why I have been working in 
Congress to oppose this legislation and 
to hold the Biden administration ac-
countable when it tries to push PRO 
Act policies by executive fiat. 
Madam Speaker, it is time to em-
brace worker freedom, a quintessential 
American value, and it is time to pro-
tect worker rights. I am proud to cele-
brate the 75th anniversary of the right 
to work. 
Let’s make every State a right-to- 
work State. I guarantee the country 
would be much better off.

KEEP GOVERNMENT OUT OF YOUR DOCTOR’S 
OFFICE 
Mr. LIEU. Madam Speaker, abortion 
is a highly and deeply personal deci-
sion. 
It is very complicated. You have dra-
matic effects for the family, for the 
woman. It can have health effects. 
Some pregnancies are fine in the first 
month, and then they are not fine in 
the fourth month for medical reasons. 
Some pregnancies are the result of 
rape or incest. 
Some 
religions 
support 
abortion. 
Some religions oppose abortion. 
This is a very complicated issue, very 
personal, and it is exactly the wrong 
issue for government. 
Republicans 
want 
to 
criminalize 
abortion. Keep government out of your 
doctor’s office. 
Democrats support Roe v. Wade. I 
urge the American people that if they 
want to have Roe v. Wade upheld, they 
cast their vote at the ballot box this 
November. 
DEMOCRATS’ ACCOMPLISHMENTS 
Mr. LIEU. Madam Speaker, under the 
American Rescue Plan, we created 
jobs, we got vaccines into people’s 
arms, we reopened schools, and we 
helped get the economy back on track. 
In the first 15 months of the Biden 
Presidency, over 8.5 million jobs were 
created, the most in American history. 
Democrats are for the people, and we 
put people over politics. 
We also passed an infrastructure law 
that is going to rebuild roads, bridges, 
and highways, get lead out of water, 
and put broadband everywhere, from 
rural areas to inner cities to every-
where in between. 
What are Republicans doing? I don’t 
know, but I know a number of Repub-
lican Members of Congress sought a 
pardon from the White House for incit-
ing an insurrection. 
NATIONAL FOSTER YOUTH SHADOW DAY 
Mr. LIEU. Madam Speaker, today is 
one of my favorite days in Congress be-
cause it is National Foster Youth 
Shadow Day. 
I have a foster youth shadowing me. 
His name is Joseph Mariscal. He just 
graduated from community college, 
and now he is going to go to Cal State 
LA. He is watching how Congress 
works. 
He has overcome so many obstacles, 
and because of the amazing things he 
has done to overcome his obstacles, I 
am confident he can do anything he 
wants in his future. 
I thank KAREN BASS and other mem-
bers of the National Foster Youth In-
stitute for all they do for our foster 
youth and for having this shadow day 
today.

SHOCKING REMARKS ON GAS 
PRICES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. ROSE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, recently, 
Cecilia Rouse, the chair of the White 
House Council of Economic Advisers, 
was trying to explain away the chal-
lenges that runaway inflation presents 
to most American households, and she 
said, ‘‘Most American household bal-
ance sheets are strong and can provide 
some cushion for rising prices.’’ 
I was shocked to hear these remarks 
coming from one of the President’s top 
economic 
policy 
advisers. 
Madam 
Speaker, most Americans, in fact, do 
not have a cushion for rising prices. A 
recent survey found that 56 percent of 
Americans cannot cover a $1,000 emer-
gency expense from their savings. 
That is why I led a letter demanding 
that Chair Rouse apologizes to the mil-
lions of Americans struggling with 
skyrocketing prices due to the failed 
economic policies of the Biden admin-
istration. I include this letter for the 
RECORD. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, June 15, 2022. 
Dr. CECILIA ROUSE, 
Chair, White House Council of Economic Advis-
ers, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIR ROUSE: We write today to ex-
press our outrage toward your recent com-
ments during an online event hosted by the 
Center for American Progress. At the event, 
you stated, in part ‘‘. . . most household bal-
ance sheets are strong and can provide some 
cushion for rising prices . . .’’ As Chair of 
the White House Council of Economic Advis-
ers, we are astounded at your failure to rec-
ognize that most Americans actually lack 
any sort of cushion for the hardships they 
must endure as a result of the Biden Admin-
istration’s failed economic policies. 
A recent survey found that 56 percent of 
Americans cannot cover a $1,000 emergency 
expense with their savings. We would not ex-
pect this to come as a surprise to you, one of 
the most senior economic officials in the 
Biden Administration. It is offensive to the 
millions of Americans fighting to fill their 
gas tanks, having to remove items from 
their shopping carts at the grocery store 
check-out line, and struggling to pay their 
rising rents to pretend that households have 
an imaginary cushion to deal with these his-
toric price increases caused in no small part 
by runaway deficit spending. 
Considering President Biden’s approval 
ratings have dipped below 40 percent, per-
haps it is comments like these that lead 
Americans to believe that his administration 
is completely out of touch with the everyday 
struggles of millions of American families. 
We encourage you to travel to gas stations 
and grocery stores across the country to ask 
hard-working Americans whether they have 
enough ‘‘cushion’’ to offset this record infla-
tion. In fact, each of us invites you to visit 
our respective districts to speak with our 
constituents, where you will find most of 
them do not have such a cushion. 
Alarmingly, you followed your comment 
by stating ‘‘. . . I understand rising prices 
are painful, I understand that . . .’’ Despite 
these claims, you clearly do not understand 
the full impact of rising prices because of 
your mistaken belief that most Americans 
have the ability to absorb the pain from rap-
idly increasing prices for goods and services 
they need each day with essentially incon-
sequential negative effects to their quality 
of life due to some mythical financial ‘‘cush-
ion’’ you think most Americans enjoy. We 
ask you to publicly apologize to the millions 
of Americans struggling with skyrocketing 
prices and record inflation for these insensi-
tive and inaccurate remarks. 
Thank you for your prompt attention to 
this matter. 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, if re-
marks like these are reflective of the 
advice being given to the President of 
the United States, it is no wonder that 
they continue to enact policies com-
pletely out of touch with the American 
people. 
GAS TAX HOLIDAY 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, if you 
were on a drive through middle Ten-
nessee right now and needed to fill up, 
let’s say, a 2015 Ford F–150, you would 
pay about $120. A gas tax holiday would 
take fewer than $5 off that bill. 
Yet, this is the latest Band-Aid solu-
tion being tossed around by the Biden 
administration. President Biden has al-
ready depleted our Strategic Petro-
leum Reserve to its lowest point in 35 
years, weakening national security 
while doing little or nothing to lower 
gas prices. 
While every dollar certainly counts, 
saving only $5 out of every $120 from a 
gas tax holiday will not make much of 
a difference in our personal budgets, 
but it will have a crushing effect on 
our ability to pay for the Federal high-
way system. 
Instead of kneecapping our Nation’s 
infrastructure, the President should 
immediately approve the more than 
4,000 pending applications for drilling 
and end the freeze on oil and gas leases, 
yet President Biden refuses. 
The key to getting prices down is 
simple: reestablish the energy inde-
pendence President Trump created. 
President Biden simply must do bet-
ter. 
f 
DEMOCRATS’ ENERGY POLICY 
HURTING AMERICANS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. LAMALFA) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, on 
President Biden’s first day in office, he 
canceled the permit for the Keystone 
XL pipeline. It was a campaign prom-
ise. 
This would have brought 700,000 bar-
rels of oil per day into the United 
States. Instead, this move has cost 
thousands of Americans their jobs as 
well as much of their income. 
Continuing his attack on our energy 
industries, he halted all oil and natural 
gas leases on Federal lands, despite a 
judge’s ruling against this illegal ban.

June 22, 2022 
His administration has also shut 
down the congressionally authorized 
oil and gas program in the 1002 Area of 
the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in 
Alaska and has threatened industry 
with regulation and increased royal-
ties, which will significantly impact 
investment in new energy production. 
Indeed, the large financiers are already 
backing away due to their ESG ideal-
ism and the intimidation by the gov-
ernment to do so. 
ANWR is actually 19.6 million acres. 
The 1002 Area is a small fraction of 
that total area, and the actual drilling 
itself will take place on an even small-
er fraction of that, as well. 
Most recently, the Biden administra-
tion has scrapped a court-ordered off-
shore 5-year lease in the Gulf of Mex-
ico. This could likely spell a complete 
ban on offshore leases until the end of 
his whole term. 
What does he expect is going to hap-
pen? Well, we are seeing it, and the 
people are feeling it: $5 gas nationally; 
$6, $6.50 in California, where everything 
is more expensive; $7 for diesel. 
How do they expect that trucks are 
going to deliver items to the store or 
trucks are going to bring things from 
manufacturing facilities to distribu-
tion centers or from the field to the 
dryer, 
to 
the 
mill, 
the 
fertilizer 
brought to the field, the seed brought 
to the field? All these things, how do 
they expect they are going to happen 
with $7 fuel and higher? 
The expectations are it is not going 
to get better anytime soon. We have 
seen proposals by the Biden adminis-
tration to relieve the gas tax and diesel 
tax, which is about 18.4 cents per gal-
lon on gas and 24.4 on diesel. I think we 
would always be happy to take a reduc-
tion in taxes, whether it is temporary 
or not, but it is not going to make but 
a tiny impact on $5, $6, $7 fuel. 
What we need is production. Produc-
tion will alter the market. When they 
are hesitant or reluctant or just flat 
saying no to increasing production, es-
pecially in a worldwide market where 
we had been relying on Russia for some 
reason for about 8 percent of our oil 
consumption, yes, we need to replace 
that. 
We shouldn’t buy anything from Rus-
sia. We shouldn’t really be buying any-
thing from China. Why do we want to 
be dependent on them for anything? 
Solar panels? Our energy policy in this 
country needs to be turned on its ear 
and put back to something that favors 
Americans. 
They are blaming everything under 
the Sun for these rising costs except 
for the policies they are putting in 
place. The President is blaming MAGA 
Republicans. What does that even 
mean? How does that make sense? 
Washington, D.C., has been under 
one-party rule for the last couple of 
years. It is clear: The price hikes we 
are seeing at the gas pump are caused 
directly by the Biden administration’s 
anti-American, 
anti-energy 
policies. 
His exact words while campaigning 
were: ‘‘No more drilling on Federal 
lands. No more drilling, including off-
shore. No ability for the oil industry to 
continue to drill, period. It ends.’’ 
Well, you are seeing the effects, and 
it is unaffordable for people. Normal 
folks don’t have discretionary income 
to even get through an emergency, in a 
lot of cases, within their family, and 
we keep heaping this upon their backs, 
for their energy needs, driving their ve-
hicles, and heating their homes. 
We are taking away natural gas. 
There are areas moving to do that. Cit-
ies and certain other jurisdictions want 
to say no more natural gas for your 
stoves, heaters, and such. They want it 
to be all electric. 
These hostile actions are, indeed, cre-
ating long-term uncertainty. We are 
seeing the futures contracts for energy 
are staying high. 
How much longer can we do this? 
How long will they be in place that 
way? Less drilling results in higher oil 
prices, which means higher gas prices 
for consumers. It is that simple. It is 
not rocket science. 
Instead, the President is traveling to 
Saudi Arabia to beg for them to send 
more of their oil to us. We have the re-
serves in many States in our own coun-
try that we can be tapping into and 
doing it more ecologically soundly and 
certainly more economically soundly. 
He would rather, I guess, lie in the 
pockets of OPEC oligarchs than create 
the high-paying jobs we have right here 
and do it well. 
We know that American energy is 
the cleanest and safest in the world. It 
is much cleaner than natural gas that 
Russia was sending to Western Europe 
and now is cutting off from them. Well, 
that is a surprise, isn’t it? Germany 
gets rid of their nuclear power plants 
and cuts back on other forms of en-
ergy, and now instead, because they 
cannot rely on Russian gas coming in 
through the big pipe, they are having 
to restoke their coal-fired plants. 
Isn’t that amazing? You actually go 
backward 
on 
environmental 
issues 
when you don’t plan, when you can’t 
foresee what might happen with what 
Russia would do. 
We could be a major exporter, and we 
should be a major exporter, helping our 
European allies and helping Americans 
have jobs and decently priced energy 
that comes from our own country.

CHANGING THE CHILD WELFARE 
SYSTEM FROM INSIDE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. BASS) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. BASS. Madam Speaker, today, I 
rise to talk about the nearly half a mil-
lion young people in our Nation’s child 
welfare system. 
Last month was National Foster Care 
Month, a time for our country to come 
together to acknowledge the half mil-
lion people in our system, the hundreds 
of thousands who work within the sys-
tem day in and day out, and the mil-
lions of adults who have exited the sys-
tem and are no longer in care. 
No one knows the child welfare sys-
tem like the foster youth who have 
grown up in the system. Today, the 
Congressional Caucus on Foster Youth 
and the National Foster Youth Insti-
tute have brought more than 35 young 
people from all over the country to 
shadow their Members of Congress. I 
would like to take a second to thank 
the Members of Congress who are 
spending this morning learning from a 
constituent and delegate of the pro-
gram about their personal experiences 
and ideas to make impactful change in 
the child welfare system. 
Each year, our participants have a 
real hand in making change. From the 
Chafee Grant extensions to the passage 
of the Families First Prevention Serv-
ices Act to securing COVID relief for 
foster youth, this group’s voices have 
changed our child welfare system for-
ever. 
As a matter of fact, when COVID 
first struck and none of us in the coun-
try knew what to do, the young people 
who were members of the National Fos-
ter Youth Institute contacted Members 
of Congress and said: While you are 
passing legislation to address the pan-
demic, don’t forget us because we have 
very specific needs. And Members of 
Congress responded. 
When we put together the emergency 
packages, we took their input. We took 
specifically what they requested, such 
as the Chafee Grant extensions and 
other extensions of programs, and put 
it into law and made sure that they 
had resources. 
b 1030 
The reality is this: When the govern-
ment removes children from their par-
ents, the government becomes that 
child’s parent. Too often, the govern-
ment forgets this commitment, and life 
goes on for those not in the child wel-
fare system; but for those in it, they 
come to feel trapped and forgotten. 
These young people here today have 
traveled thousands of miles to share 
their stories of their challenges with 
abuse, trafficking, overmedication, and 
homelessness. In addition, they are 
sharing 
their 
successes 
with 
mentorship, adoption, family reunifica-
tion, community activism, and inde-
pendent living. They are resilient and 
have the ability to navigate challenges 
in their life and succeed, even in spite 
of their hardships. Their goal is to 
leave Congress with a better under-
standing of the reality faced today by 
our Nation’s youth in care. 
I will share some words from Xandra 
Ruby Vaughn, who is shadowing me 
this morning. She told me just yester-
day that her time in care helped shape 
the person she is today. While in care, 
she saw that resources for foster youth, 
especially when it came to education, 
were hard to find and hard to access. 
She manages a Facebook page of re-
sources for foster youth of all ages, as-
sisting them with finding and assessing

housing support, educational funds, 
and mental health services. 
While in college, she experienced 
firsthand the impact of age require-
ments for former foster youth to re-
ceive assistance, a problem she would 
like lawmakers to pay attention to, to 
better help the former foster youth in 
our district. 
There are several other young people 
that are here with me today. Jennifer 
Martinez is a former foster youth from 
Los Angeles who is now a foster youth 
advocate. 
Amber Rosado-Esteves entered the 
child welfare system when she was 14 
and aged out when she was 18, and now 
she is very successful in college. 
Anthony Vizcarrondo spent 10 years 
in foster care, from the ages of 6 to 16, 
in California’s Central Valley. His 
placements included foster homes and 
juvenile hall. Anthony is a strong fos-
ter youth advocate who is focused on 
expanding 
educational 
opportunities 
and child welfare reform. 
Between her placements in foster 
care and being behind by 19 credits, Lu-
cinda ‘‘Lucy’’ Langley thought she had 
no chance of graduating high school. 
But after years of hard work, that is 
exactly what she did. 
Sapphire Murphy Powell also joined 
us all the way from New Zealand. 
We need to understand, as a country, 
and as a Congress, that when we ad-
dress the child welfare system, this is a 
way of preventing these children from 
becoming homeless. In the city of Los 
Angeles alone, we have 50,000 people 
who sleep on the street every night. We 
have tents all over our city, and in 
those tents, there are thousands of 
young people who aged out of the fos-
ter care system when they were 18 or 
21. Essentially, what we have done as a 
society is cut them off of resources, 
and they wind up on the streets, they 
wind up incarcerated, or they wind up 
trafficked. This is a failure of the sys-
tem, the system that we are respon-
sible for. 
Our country is the richest country in 
the history of the world, and there is 
no excuse for us not to take care of the 
half million young people in the foster 
care system. This is why we need to 
transform the system.

HONORING TERRY DICKSON 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CARTER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Terry 
Dickson for his achievement of being 
named a recipient of the American Pa-
triot Award. 
During 
the 
Vietnam 
war, 
Terry 
served as an infantry squad leader in 
the 196th Light Infantry Brigade and 
received the distinction of the Combat 
Infantryman Badge for his incredible 
service. 
After his service, he began a career 
at the Florida Times-Union where he 
became an award-winning newspaper 
photographer and wrote pieces on a 
wide variety of subjects. 
Terry has worked at The Brunswick 
News in my district since 2019, where 
he continues to work as reporter, pho-
tographer, and pens a weekly column. 
Terry has received many awards at 
the local, State, Federal, and even 
international levels for his work, both 
in columns and photography. 
Among a list of incredible past re-
cipients, Terry is adding his name onto 
an honorable group of American patri-
ots. 
The American Patriot Award is a 
given to a veteran who has served their 
country with distinction and continued 
that throughout their career. 
Terry is the epitome of this award, 
serving tremendously in the Vietnam 
war and as a journalist following his 
service. 
I congratulate Terry for receiving 
this incredible award. He deserves it. 
PAYING TRIBUTE TO THE FEDERAL LAW 
ENFORCEMENT TRAINING ACCREDITATION BOARD 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to 
the Federal Law Enforcement Training 
Accreditation Board, FLETA, as they 
celebrate their 20th anniversary on 
July 1, 2022. 
The FLETA board of directors, lo-
cated in my district, is comprised of 28 
senior officials from varying Federal 
law enforcement agencies, academia, 
and professional organizations. 
Since the FLETA Board’s inception, 
more than 75 training organizations, 
spanning from 47 agencies and 10 de-
partments across the executive and ju-
dicial branches of the Government, 
have submitted training programs for 
voluntary review and have sought ac-
creditation through FLETA, in which 
they have completed 389 of those as-
sessments. 
The FLETA Office of Accreditation is 
one of smallest entities in the Federal 
Government, with only seven Govern-
ment employees. Yet, they have an ex-
tensive impact on Federal training and 
operations. 
FLETA 
assists 
law 
enforcement 
agencies in virtually every department 
of the Federal Government, improving 
operations through the implementa-
tion of more effective and efficient 
training tactics. 
The mission of FLETA is more im-
portant now than ever before. This 
agency’s efforts are demonstrative of 
good government in action, practicing 
accountability through self-regulation, 
which exhibits the transparency that 
Americans expect of their government. 
On behalf of the citizens of Georgia 
and this distinguished body, I once 
again congratulate FLETA on their 
20th anniversary and wish them much 
continued success in the future. 
RECOGNIZING DON HOGAN 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in recognition of 
my friend, Don Hogan, a State house 
representative, a county commissioner, 
and a fellow Bulldog. 
Don received an education from both 
Georgia Southern University and the 
University of Georgia. 
He has served as a board member of 
the Golden Isles Chamber of Com-
merce, president of the Saint Simons 
Chamber of Commerce, area commis-
sioner for the Boy Scouts of America, 
and on the advisory council of the 
Coastal Area Planning and Develop-
ment Commission. 
I am honored to recognize Don as the 
42nd recipient of the Alfred W. Jones, 
Sr. award. This award is given each 
year to honor a person whose selfless 
lifetime commitment, contributions, 
and achievements have positively im-
pacted our community and its people. 
After many years of service, Don has 
decided not to run for reelection this 
November and will be going into retire-
ment after a lengthy career of service 
to others. 
I know Don is looking forward to 
spending time on his family farm, fish-
ing, and telling stories sitting on the 
porch of his 150-year-old log cabin. 
It was a pleasure and an honor to 
spend time with Don in the Georgia 
State legislature. I thank him for ev-
erything he has done for our State, and 
he should enjoy his well-deserved re-
tirement.

AMERICAN FAMILIES ARE 
SUFFERING 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. BILIRAKIS) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, 
with gas prices at or above $5 per gal-
lon, Americans are feeling significant 
pain at the pump. In a recent survey of 
my constituents, 89 percent said they 
have had to change or cancel their 
summer travel plans due to the surge 
in gas prices. What a shame. 
I have also heard stories about how 
the gas prices, coupled with crippling 
inflation, have eaten into my constitu-
ents’ savings and made it extremely 
difficult for families to make ends 
meet. These are the realities families 
throughout our country are facing. 
Yet, this administration and many of 
my colleagues in this Chamber appear 
to be out of touch with these concerns. 
Instead of taking action to relieve 
the pain at the pump, President Biden 
and Congressional Democrats continue 
to blame, deflect, and justify the irre-
sponsible decisions that have caused 
gas prices to spike. 
Earlier this week, the President said: 
‘‘Out of everything lousy, something 
good will happen if you look hard 
enough for it. 
‘‘We have a chance to make a funda-
mental turn toward renewable energy, 
electric vehicles—and not just electric 
vehicles but across the board.’’ 
No, Mr. President, record-high gas 
prices are not a good thing. It is dis-
ingenuous to act as though you are 
powerless, Mr. President, to do any-
thing to address gas prices. My con-
stituents do not want to suffer while 
this administration and Congressional 
Democrats continue to pursue a rad-
ical, green agenda.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5742 
June 22, 2022 
President Biden has already done 
enough damage. From his first day in 
office, he canceled the Keystone pipe-
line and paused all domestic leases and 
sales. He has tried to blame everyone 
from Putin to price gouging and pri-
vate industry. 
But the facts are clear. The Biden ad-
ministration is currently sitting on 
over 4,400 pending applications for per-
mits to drill which must be approved so 
American workers can produce more 
American-made energy. That makes 
sense. In addition, Biden’s regulatory 
and inflationary burdens are thwarting 
the creation of new large-scale refin-
eries which are also needed to increase 
production. The Biden climate czar, 
former Senator John Kerry, said last 
week that we don’t need any more do-
mestic drilling. My constituents and I 
beg to differ. 
Prior to President Biden assuming 
office, the United States was a net ex-
porter of energy, and the price of gas 
dipped below $2 a gallon. The greatest 
Nation on the face of the Earth should 
never have to rely on Saudi Arabia, 
Venezuela, Iran, Russia, or any other 
hostile nation to meet its energy 
needs. It is also not realistic to believe 
we can transition to a green economy 
overnight without significant cost to 
consumers. 
However, we can regain American en-
ergy independence, create American 
jobs, and lower prices at the pump by 
implementing the pro-growth, com-
monsense policies of the previous ad-
ministration, which is why I have co-
sponsored the American Energy Inde-
pendence from Russia Act. Unfortu-
nately, House Democrats have blocked 
this critical bill seven times on this 
very floor. That means they are block-
ing energy solutions for lowering gas 
prices by boosting domestic energy 
production. This includes resuming the 
Keystone XL pipeline, restarting oil 
and gas leases on Federal lands and 
waters, and requiring a plan to replace 
the Strategic Petroleum Reserve that 
has been drained by this administra-
tion. It is just not right. 
I don’t know what message my col-
leagues’ constituents on the other side 
of the aisle are sending to them. But 
back at home, the message has been 
very clear. What are their constituents 
telling them? From my constituents, 
the message is extremely clear. My 
constituents want Washington to stop 
its obsessive spending of money we 
don’t have to push a green agenda, and 
they want lower prices at the pump. 
We need to do it now. It is urgent that 
we do it. It is critical that we do it. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to join me in this fight. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair and not a perceived 
viewing audience. 
Members are reminded to refrain 
from engaging in personalities toward 
the President. 
THE INFLATION CRISIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. SMUCKER) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. SMUCKER. Madam Speaker, on 
September 1 of 1980, inflation was at al-
most 13 percent. On that day, then 
Governor Ronald Reagan said: ‘‘Reces-
sion is when your neighbor loses his 
job. Depression is when you lose yours. 
And recovery is when Jimmy Carter 
loses his.’’ Unfortunately, today is 
looking a lot like 1980, and the Carter 
and the Biden Presidencies share far 
too much in common. 
b 1045 
President Biden has unnecessarily 
spent trillions of dollars, spiking infla-
tion into a 40-year high of 8.6 percent. 
As a result of this inflation, American 
households will pay an additional $7,620 
as they buy gas, food, and other things 
over the next 12 months—$7,620 annu-
ally. 
Since Biden became President, real 
wages are down 4.2 percent while mort-
gage rates have doubled, have gone up 
2.4 points. Our economy shrank 1.4 per-
cent last quarter, and many econo-
mists now agree that these signs point 
to an imminent recession. 
The President now points to the Fed-
eral Reserve to get him out of the in-
flation mess that he created. Today, I 
will point out what that may mean and 
talk about the challenge that the Fed 
faces to rein in inflation. 
I have a chart here with me that 
compares the Federal funds rate, which 
is its benchmark interest rate, and in-
flation rates over the past 60 years. If 
you look at the chart, you will see two 
lines on the graph showing inflation 
and the Fed rate. Each time that the 
Fed looked to reduce inflation, they in-
creased the interest rate, and they 
have increased the interest rate each 
time above the current inflation rate. 
So, for example, in the early 1980s, 
which I mentioned earlier, following 
President Carter’s era of stagflation, 
the Fed raised rates to a record high of 
over 16.5 percent to reverse what was 13 
percent inflation at that time. So once 
again, this would suggest that for the 
Fed to do its job and rein in inflation, 
it will need to increase interest rates 
above our current rate of inflation. 
So far this year, the Feds have raised 
the Federal fund rate three times, most 
recently with a .75—or 3⁄4 percent—in-
crease, which is the highest increase 
since 1994, but the Federal funds rate 
still only sits between 1.5 and 13⁄4 per-
cent. 
Current rates are 13⁄4 percent, and 
again, inflation is 8.6 percent and 
climbing. This suggests that the Fed 
has a long way to go in raising interest 
rates, and has a lot of work to do 
ahead. What isn’t shown in this chart— 
and sometimes I am not sure if the 
Biden administration understands—are 
the consequences that come with rais-
ing rates. 
Our economy will slow down, and it 
will be harder for Americans to start 
small 
businesses 
and 
to 
purchase 
homes. We are already seeing that hap-
pening. The cost of living will increase, 
and Americans will see hard times. 
This did not have to happen. 
President Biden overinflated an al-
ready recovering economy by spending 
trillions on the American Rescue Plan, 
which included market-distorting poli-
cies that unnecessarily subsidized de-
mand while restricting supplies by pay-
ing people to stay home. 
Now, as I said, the President is rely-
ing on the Fed to fix it but, unfortu-
nately, it is the American people who 
will be paying the consequences. 
f 
CELEBRATING THE LIFE AND 
WORK OF MARY E. WHEELER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
New York (Ms. TENNEY) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. TENNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the life and work of 
my dear friend, Mrs. Mary E. Wheeler 
of Yorkville, New York. 
I came to know Mary in a role no one 
ever wishes to have, that of a Gold Star 
mother. Mary’s son, Private First Class 
Joseph Keith Wheeler, a United States 
marine, was killed in combat on March 
31, 1968, in Quang Tri Province in Viet-
nam, at just 18 years old. 
Mary and her family were devastated 
by the loss of Joseph. But through 
Mary’s pain, she found great purpose to 
support other Gold Star mothers and 
their families, as well as Active-Duty 
members, veterans, and their loved 
ones. 
Mary was active until the day she 
passed in the American Gold Star 
Mothers Chapter 56 in Utica, New 
York. This led to Mary being national 
president of the American Gold Star 
Mothers from 1999 through 2000, meet-
ing Gold Star mothers and families 
from across this Nation and inter-
acting with political leaders of both 
parties in Washington for common-
sense policy to support veterans and 
their families, especially those who 
paid the ultimate sacrifice, like her 
dear son, Joseph. 
Mary was heavily involved in other 
veteran service organizations, such as 
The American Legion, Veterans of For-
eign Wars, Military Order of the Purple 
Heart Auxiliary, and countless other 
organizations in our community, in-
cluding the Whitestown Senior Center 
and the Salvation Army, which she 
supported her entire life. 
Mary was also dedicated to her fam-
ily: her late husband, Charles; her chil-
dren; grandchildren; and great-grand-
children. 
Mary’s 
great-grandson, 
Shaun, and her great-granddaughter, 
Skylar, have a special place in my 
heart as Skylar’s grandmother, Felicia, 
was my longtime administrative assist-
ant for over 25 years. They all were a 
very important part of my life, and I 
considered them family. So I had an-
other connection to Mary through her 
great-grandchildren. 
Words cannot do justice to the many 
contributions by Mary throughout her

great life, the many lives she has 
touched, including the mothers and the 
families she supported. It was an honor 
and a privilege to get to know Mary, 
not only through the great work she 
has done, but to know what a genuine 
person and kind soul she was and a 
wonderful mother, grandmother, and 
great-grandmother. 
Mary will be an inspiration to all of 
us for so many years to come, and her 
hard work and dedication will be felt 
by veterans and their families for gen-
erations not just in our community, 
but throughout the Nation for her 
great work and devotion to this cause. 
My sincerest condolences to Mary’s 
family and her friends, and everyone in 
our community for this difficult time 
in losing Mary, who was a wonderful, 
honored member of our community.

PROTECTING HEARTBEATS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. KELLY) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, as the Nation awaits the Su-
preme Court’s official ruling on Dobbs 
v. Jackson, which many of us pray will 
overturn Roe v. Wade, we have wit-
nessed a despicable wave of leftwing 
threats 
and 
violence 
against 
our 
judges, our churches, pro-life groups, 
and crisis pregnancy centers. 
Let’s be very clear on this. Preg-
nancy centers are 100 percent noble and 
heroic organizations that proudly serve 
vulnerable mothers at their most crit-
ical time of need. They are an invalu-
able resource across America. Because 
these centers save lives and not end 
them, they find themselves under at-
tack. 
Since May 2, the day Justice Alito’s 
draft decision was leaked, there have 
been nearly 30 documented attacks on 
these centers, including, but not lim-
ited to: 
A pregnancy center in Madison, Wis-
consin, torched by a Molotov cocktail 
on May 8. 
Capitol Hill Crisis Pregnancy Center 
right here in Washington, D.C., vandal-
ized with blood red paint on June 2. 
Pregnancy Resource Center in Buf-
falo, New York, firebombed on June 7. 
Pregnancy 
Resource 
Center 
in 
Gersham, Oregon, firebombed on June 
10. 
And, of course, the attempted assas-
sination of Justice Kavanaugh outside 
his home. 
Since May 2020, more than 130 acts of 
vandalism, or worse, have been com-
mitted across 29 States and the Dis-
trict 
of 
Columbia 
against 
pro-life 
Catholic properties alone. The pro-
ponents of these attacks are radical 
leftwing groups that are openly vowing 
to terrify pro-life leaders and institu-
tions into backing down from defend-
ing the unborn. 
They have made threats like, ‘‘If 
abortions aren’t safe, neither are you.’’ 
They have promised ‘‘to take increas-
ingly 
drastic 
measures’’ 
and 
that 
‘‘those measures may not come in the 
form of something so easily cleaned up 
as a fire or graffiti.’’ They are cur-
rently calling for a ‘‘night of rage’’ 
after the Supreme Court announces its 
decision. 
When fear, intimidation, and vio-
lence are deployed to compel legiti-
mate government institutions to act a 
certain way, it must be called what it 
is: terrorism. 
These recent threats and attacks 
must be totally condemned, inves-
tigated, and prosecuted. This violence 
must end. 
Our Nation needs to hear from the 
leaders of our Democratic Party that 
these extremists call home: Speaker 
PELOSI, Majority Leader SCHUMER, and 
President Biden have so far refused to 
utter even a single word of disapproval 
or discouragement. To them, Ameri-
cans of goodwill plead: Your silence is 
deafening. Speak up. 
To the Supreme Court Justices, to 
their families, and to the millions and 
millions of pro-life Americans from 
coast to coast, I say this: Be not afraid. 
We are most likely on the cusp of an 
epic victory. It will be the culmination 
of 50 years of work. We must not back 
down or tire, for the end of Roe v. Wade 
will mean the beginning of a new era in 
which our voices and our passion are 
needed more than ever. 
For those of us in elected office who 
sincerely believe that human life is a 
sacred gift from God and in need of so-
ciety’s protection, our position is no 
longer theoretical. We now have a 
pressing responsibility to examine how 
public policy can best be crafted to 
adequately accomplish that goal. I be-
lieve we already have an answer. 
When an expectant mother visits a 
doctor for an ultrasound, the image of 
a beating heart is the first confirma-
tion that a child has been conceived. 
When someone is involved in a severe 
accident, a medic will check for a pulse 
to make sure the victim is alive. In 
short, a heartbeat means life. 
To legislate consistently to this 
truth, I introduced the Heartbeat Pro-
tection Act in the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives. This bill will legally pro-
hibit future abortions from being per-
formed if a pre-born child’s heartbeat 
can be detected, with the exception of 
when a mother’s life is in danger. It is 
a science-based, humanity-respecting 
solution suited to the new landscape in 
which we now find ourselves. The post- 
Roe world is here. 
As legislators in each State deter-
mine the extent in which they wish to 
defend life, pro-life Members of Con-
gress can simultaneously take action 
to make our beloved country a place 
where children waiting to be born and 
their mothers are acknowledged and 
safeguarded. As we all move forward, 
may clarity, compassion, and our con-
sciences, guide us. 
Madam Speaker, we have watched 50 
years of the pro-life movement. I have 
attended many of the pro-life marches 
here in D.C. There is nothing more 
peaceful, there is nothing more prayer-
ful than the assembly of hundreds of 
thousands of Americans from around 
the country coming together to march 
in support of the pro-life measures. 
I would hope at this point in our his-
tory, as we watch the rest of the world 
unravel and as we watch these horrible 
things happen around our country, we 
say to ourselves: It is time to stop the 
violence. It is time to look forward. It 
is time to save the lives of the unborn. 
After millions and millions of chil-
dren have been aborted, it is time to 
start saving them. They are as impor-
tant as any other life on Earth.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Lord, our God, we exalt and praise 
Your name. For You, in Your perfect 
faithfulness, 
have 
done 
wonderful 
things, things planned long ago. 
Reveal Your steadfast love to those 
who are being ravaged by senseless 
warfare—the Ukrainians whose cities 
are a heap of rubble, whose towns are 
now ruined—but not because of Your 
vengeance. The breath of the ruthless 
has been like a storm driving against a 
wall, like the heat of the desert. 
Holy God, silence the uproar. Give re-
lief from the intensity of this battle. 
Still the song of the avenger. 
Once again, prove Yourself the refuge 
for the poor in spirit, a refuge for the 
needy in distress. Provide the people of 
Ukraine shelter from the storm of war 
waged against them. Give them shade 
from the oppressor’s heat of wrath. 
Then, sovereign Lord, wipe away the 
tears from all faces, remove the dis-
grace of Your people. May they rise to 
proclaim: 
‘‘Surely, this is our God. We trusted 
in Him, and God saved us. This is the 
Lord. We trusted in God; let us rejoice 
and be glad in God’s salvation.’’ 
So may it be, according to Your 
Word, we pray. 
Amen.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER. Will the gentle-
woman 
from 
New 
Hampshire 
(Ms. 
KUSTER) come forward and lead the 
House in the Pledge of Allegiance. 
Ms. KUSTER led the Pledge of Alle-
giance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
The SPEAKER. The Chair will enter-
tain up to 15 requests for 1-minute 
speeches on each side of the aisle. 
f 
FIGHTING FOR RIGHTS OF LGBTQ+ 
PEOPLE 
(Ms. KELLY of Illinois asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. 
KELLY 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, in June, we celebrate Pride 
Month, a time to not only uplift mem-
bers of our LGBTQ+ community and 
honor those who have fought for 
LGBTQ+ rights and equality but also 
to recommit ourselves to ensuring and 
advancing those rights. 
Last week, President Biden signed an 
executive order to build on the historic 
progress his administration has made 
for LGBTQ+ people. I am thrilled that 
with this executive order, President 
Biden will address discriminatory leg-
islative attacks against LGBTQ+ peo-
ple, prevent harmful conversion ther-
apy, safeguard healthcare and mental 
health programs, support LGBTQ+ fos-
ter youth, prevent homelessness, and 
improve connections to the Federal 
programs that keep LGBTQ+ people 
safe and healthy. 
No one should face discrimination be-
cause of who they are. Rising hate and 
violence against the LGBTQ+ commu-
nity is unacceptable. I will continue 
working to ensure our LGBTQ+ Ameri-
cans are protected. 
f 
CONGRATULATING PROVIDENCE 
HIGH PANTHERS 
(Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. 
BISHOP 
of 
North 
Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to honor and 
congratulate 
the 
Providence 
High 
School baseball team for winning the 
North Carolina High School 4A State 
championship. 
Not only did Providence win the 
championship, but they also dominated 
the season, compiling a record of 34–0. 
Never before in North Carolina 4A 
baseball history has a team gone 
undefeated. 
Along 
with 
these 
extraordinary 
young men, I congratulate Head Coach 
Danny Hignight, who told his coaching 
staff on the night of their big win: ‘‘We 
. . . went 34–0. That is unreal.’’ 
Well, Coach Hignight, it is my honor 
to say on the floor of this Chamber 
that it is real and that I and all of 
Charlotte, North Carolina, are proud of 
this amazing school and team. 
Congratulations, 
Providence 
High 
Panthers, on an incredible season. 
f 
ATTACKS ON DEMOCRACY 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
we are in the midst of many elections, 
primary elections and ongoing to No-
vember 2022. 
I salute our election officials because 
what we saw yesterday in the January 
6 hearings was appalling and disgrace-
ful and an attack on democracy. From 
the speaker of the House of Arizona to 
the elections officers in Georgia, pain 
was exhibited from being violated, vio-
lently attacked by words, and threat-
ened. 
I remember the words of the election 
official from Georgia saying: I don’t 
even want to give my card out or give 
my name. 
Both she and her mother are tar-
geted. These are just people who are 
Americans who want to serve their 
country. What an outrage. 
As we continue to listen to the Janu-
ary 6 proceedings, let us take them 
very seriously. Those who engage in 
this kind of outrageous behavior, an 
attack on the flag of the United States, 
must be held accountable. 
My heart goes out to the election of-
ficials and the speaker of the Arizona 
Legislature, whose daughter was sick 
while his house was being attacked. 
We cannot do any less than to hold 
those 
accountable, 
accountable 
be-
cause this is a disgrace to the Amer-
ican flag. 
f 
UNITING FOR ALZHEIMER’S AND 
BRAIN AWARENESS MONTH 
(Mr. BURCHETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, 
June is Alzheimer’s and Brain Aware-
ness Month. There are so many things 
that are dividing our country right 
now, but this is something that should 
bring us all together. 
Alzheimer’s and dementia are fright-
ening diseases that impact millions of 
Americans every year. Six million 
Americans are affected, 120,000 Ten-
nesseans. 
I have witnessed the effects of Alz-
heimer’s, Madam Speaker, on several 
people close to me, my Aunt Jane and 
my Aunt Virginia. 
My Aunt Jane, I can remember that 
I hadn’t seen her in years, and she 
walked up to me and said, ‘‘I don’t 
know who you are, but I feel like you 
are a good little boy,’’ and I was an 
adult. 
My sweet Aunt Virginia, who is mar-
ried to my Uncle Floyd, suffers from it, 
as well. 
Pat Summitt, who coached the Lady 
Vols basketball team for 38 seasons— 
she grew up in my daddy’s hometown— 
came to my daddy’s funeral and hugged 
my mama’s neck. She lived with Alz-
heimer’s disease and worked hard to 
bring awareness to it until she passed 
away in 2016. 
Before she left us, she formed the Pat 
Summitt Foundation to promote re-
search on Alzheimer’s treatment and 
to educate the public. Also, the Pat 
Summitt Foundation supports a clinic 
at the University of Tennessee that 
cares for those with Alzheimer’s. 
We can’t forget about the folks who 
take care of those with Alzheimer’s, as 
well. They take a huge emotional and 
physical toll. We need to remember 
these folks. The Bible tells us that we 
need to remember the least amongst 
us, and surely they are in that cat-
egory. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF IGNACIO 
GONZALES 
(Mr. CORREA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, a sol-
dier takes his oath of service, swearing 
allegiance to our country and to our 
flag. When 92-year-old Korean war vet 
Ignacio Gonzales saw a young man 
take his American flag from his porch, 
he went into action. 
The 92-year-old Ignacio chased the 
man down, retrieved the American 
flag, and returned it to its proper place 
in front of his home. Later on, he 
laughingly told his wife: ‘‘They didn’t 
know I could run that fast.’’ 
After the flag incident, his son, 
Vicente, told his father: ‘‘It is not 
worth the danger, Dad, chasing down a 
hoodlum to retrieve your $20 flag.’’ 
Ignacio corrected his son and said: 
‘‘This isn’t just a flag. This American 
flag flies in memory of your uncles, 
George and Manuel Gonzales.’’ 
Both fought in World War II. George 
fought in the Battle of the Bulge, and 
Manuel fought in the Rhineland cam-
paign. Ignacio fought in the Korean 
war and was awarded many medals, in-
cluding the Combat Infantry Badge 
that is given only to soldiers who 
fought in active ground combat. 
Ignacio passed away quietly on June 
9, and I have never been more proud of 
one of my countrymen. He was also a 
graduate from Anaheim High School, 
my alma mater. He was class of 1949. 
f 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION INSISTS 
ALL IS WELL 
(Mr. MOORE of Alabama asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MOORE of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, when it comes to the econ-
omy, the Biden administration con-
tinues to insist that all is well. His 
press secretary claims the economy is 
in a better place than it has been his-
torically.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5745 
June 22, 2022 
Historically? Perhaps she needs to 
read a history book. Inflation is at a 
40-year high in this country. President 
Biden himself makes the false claim 
that inflation is worse elsewhere in the 
world than here. 
Mr. President, the United States has 
worse inflation than Germany, France, 
Japan, Canada, India, Italy, Saudi Ara-
bia, and the list goes on. What is this 
explanation? 
The Biden administration blames the 
pandemic and Putin, but each of those 
countries has also had to deal with the 
same problems we have dealt with. 
Why is their inflation not like ours? 
Mr. President, the answer is easy: 
Quit overheating the economy with 
government spending. Cut red tape and 
regulations hampering our industries. 
Let the American people keep more of 
their hard-earned money. 
Conservatives once warned against 
our economy turning into Europe. Un-
less we change course, Europe will be 
worried about becoming us. 
f 
BIG OIL EARNS RECORD PROFITS 
WHILE FAMILIES STRUGGLE 
(Ms. BROWN of Ohio asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. BROWN of Ohio. Madam Speak-
er, as President Biden pointed out last 
week, here is the cold, hard truth 
about gas prices: The last time oil was 
at its current price, the average price 
of gas at the pump was about $4.25 per 
gallon. Today, gas prices are nearly 75 
cents higher. 
That difference, across just 3 months, 
is the result of historically high profit 
margins for refining oil into gasoline. 
Oil and gas companies are announc-
ing record profits while Putin’s war in 
Ukraine is driving up prices at the 
pump. These companies are prioritizing 
stock buybacks while families are 
struggling to pay higher prices at the 
pump. 
This is exactly why the House passed 
the Consumer Fuel Price Gouging Pre-
vention Act last week. Yet not a single 
Republican voted with us to stop Big 
Oil from raking in record profits on the 
backs of hardworking Americans. Fam-
ilies are facing a crunch, and they de-
serve action. 
f 
CONGRATULATING ELI RUTH 
(Mr. STAUBER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. STAUBER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to congratulate and honor 
Eli Ruth, a fifth-grade student at Bay 
View Elementary of the Proctor School 
District who was named Minnesota’s 
AAA School Safety Patroller of the 
Year. 
Recently, I have been focused on how 
the United States is an exceptional 
country and how our people live out 
American exceptionalism every day. 
When I see a student like Eli taking an 
opportunity to be a leader among his 
peers and working to ensure their safe-
ty, I see a young man who perfectly ex-
emplifies American exceptionalism. 
During his time as a safety patroller, 
Eli has come to know the students and 
community very well, and I am so glad 
to see that he has already become such 
an effective and caring leader at such a 
young age. 
When I was his age, I was a school pa-
trol officer myself at Piedmont Ele-
mentary. It brings me great joy to see 
that, decades later, this program is 
still encouraging and developing young 
leaders with a passion to serve. 
Congratulations, again, to Eli Ruth 
on this amazing honor. I wish him 
nothing but success and happiness as 
he continues down his path of leader-
ship. 
f 
CELEBRATING 50 YEARS OF PELL 
GRANTS 
(Ms. CHU asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. CHU. Madam Speaker, today, I 
am so thrilled to join my colleagues 
around the country to celebrate the 
50th anniversary of the Pell grant. 
The Pell grant is essential to ful-
filling our Nation’s promise of higher 
education by ensuring low-income stu-
dents have the same access and oppor-
tunities as their wealthy peers. 
As a former college educator for over 
20 years, I know firsthand how life- 
changing a college degree can be for a 
student. That kind of opportunity 
should not be reserved for only the 
richest amongst us. 
During the 2021 academic year, near-
ly 850,000 students in my State of Cali-
fornia received a Pell grant to help 
them access and complete a college de-
gree. Nationwide, about 40 percent of 
all 
undergraduate 
students 
benefit 
from the Pell grant. 
With most of these students coming 
from working families, it is clear: Pell 
grants help make college more afford-
able, enabling students to focus on 
their education and complete their de-
grees faster. 
The Pell grant has spent the last 50 
years helping students across the coun-
try access higher education, and it is 
now easier than ever for eligible stu-
dents to apply.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. ROSS. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from North Carolina? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. ROSS. Madam Speaker, yester-
day, the Rules Committee met and re-
ported a rule, House Resolution 1191, 
for three measures. 
First, it provides for consideration of 
H.R. 4176 under a structured rule. The 
rule self-executes a manager’s amend-
ment, provides 1 hour of general debate 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking member of the Com-
mittee 
on 
Oversight 
and 
Reform, 
makes in order three amendments, and 
provides a motion to recommit. 
Second, the rule provides for consid-
eration of H.R. 5585 under a structured 
rule. The rule provides for 1 hour of 
general debate equally divided and con-
trolled by the chair and ranking mem-
ber of the Committee on Energy and 
Commerce, makes in order one amend-
ment, and provides a motion to recom-
mit. 
Third, the rule provides for consider-
ation of H.R. 7666 under a structured 
rule. The rule self-executes a man-
ager’s amendment, provides 1 hour of 
general debate equally controlled by 
the chair and ranking member of the 
Committee on Energy and Commerce, 
makes in order 17 amendments, and 
provides en bloc authority and a mo-
tion to recommit. 
Finally, the rule extends recess in-
structions, suspension authority, and 
same-day authority through July 13, 
and any requested roll call votes on 
suspension bills considered from June 
21 to June 24 may be postponed through 
July 15. 
Madam Speaker, I stand in support of 
the three bills in this rule: H.R. 7666, 
the Restoring Hope for Mental Health 
and Well-Being Act; H.R. 5585, the Ad-
vanced 
Research 
Projects 
Agency- 
Health 
Act; 
and 
H.R. 
4176, 
the 
LGBTQI+ Data Inclusion Act. 
I want to start by thanking Energy 
and Commerce Committee Chairman 
PALLONE and Ranking Member MCMOR-
RIS RODGERS for their work crafting a 
bipartisan package to tackle the grow-
ing mental health crisis in our coun-
try. 
During the COVID–19 pandemic, we 
have seen a dramatic rise in global 
mental health illness associated with 
anxiety, 
depression, 
and 
collective 
grief. 
In my State, almost 45 percent of 
North Carolinians reported symptoms 
of anxiety or depression in February 
2021, with more than 22 percent unable 
to get necessary care, largely because 
of prohibitive costs. 
Almost 
130,000 
children 
ages 
12 
through 17 in North Carolina suffer 
from adolescent depression. Multiply 
that nationwide. More than half of the 
children in North Carolina did not re-
ceive any care in the past year. Once 
they reach high school, these children 
are twice as likely to drop out of 
school as their peers. 
These statistics tell just part of the 
story of families disrupted, education 
delayed, and the barriers facing Ameri-
cans striving to achieve their full po-
tential and well-being. 
Congress has a duty to address this 
crisis with the same urgency with 
which we passed COVID–19 legislation. 
Today, we are doing just that with 
H.R. 7666, the Restoring Hope for Men-
tal Health and Well-Being Act, which 
will 
provide 
improved 
access 
to 
healthcare for mental illnesses and 
substance abuse disorders. 
This legislation boosts compliance 
with mental health parity laws, sup-
ports mental health care through tele-
health, and reauthorizes key programs 
that fund mental health services, all 
deeply needed by our people. 
This rule also includes H.R. 5585, the 
Advanced Research Projects Agency- 
Health Act, ARPA-H. 
For decades, the United States has 
been the leader in biomedical research 
around the world. However, our coun-
try has recently shown signs of slowing 
in this sector. 
Promising research opportunities are 
put on hold due to high cost, complex 
coordination, long wait periods, and 
many other factors. 
My State of North Carolina became 
the first State in the country to have a 
State-supported entity dedicated to 
promoting growth of the life sciences 
industry after the creation of the 
North Carolina Biotechnology Center 
in 1984. 
In my district of Wake County, the 
Research Triangle Park stands as the 
largest research park in North Amer-
ica. ARPA-H will have profound influ-
ences in North Carolina’s economy and 
the national economy and stimulate 
the development of breakthroughs in 
health research that will benefit mil-
lions of Americans. 
H.R. 5585 will authorize $500 million 
each year for the next 5 years to sup-
port ARPA-H and fund groundbreaking 
research and development to continue 
saving American lives. 
Finally, this rule includes H.R. 4176, 
the LGBTQI+ Data Inclusion Act. Most 
legislators 
agree 
that 
good 
policy 
should be evidence-based. Our Govern-
ment collects demographic data to en-
sure we can identify whether certain 
groups of Americans are facing obsta-
cles to the equal opportunities they 
need to thrive. However, Federal agen-
cies are not currently required to col-
lect demographic data on sexual ori-
entation and gender identity. We need 
this data to know how to address issues 
faced by the LGBTQI+ people and com-
bat discrimination.

in four LGBTQ adults in the South, in-
cluding in my State of North Carolina,

live in poverty, a rate higher than the 
overall poverty rate in the United 
States. 
LGBTQI+ youth, in particular, face 
high levels of homelessness and are at 
greater risk of depression and suicidal 
thoughts than their peers. With good 
data, we can implement good programs 
aimed at eliminating these disparities 
and help members of this community 
reach their full potential. 
As Cathy Renna of the National 
LGBTQ Task Force says, ‘‘If we don’t 
get counted, we don’t count.’’ This 
community is asking to be counted. 
Our Nation has already gone through 
the poor policy of Don’t Ask, Don’t 
Tell. We now have a responsibility to 
reverse the effects of this policy to help 
members of the LGBTQI+ community 
live as their authentic selves. 
We can do that by allowing individ-
uals to voluntarily disclose their sex-
ual orientation and gender identities. 
In other words, by asking and letting 
them decide to tell. 
Madam Speaker, I urge support for 
the rule and the three bills it contains, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman from North 
Carolina for yielding me the customary 
30 minutes, and I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, today’s rule pro-
vides for consideration of three bills: 
H.R. 7666, the Restoring Hope for Men-
tal Health and Well-Being Act; H.R. 
5585, the Advanced Research Projects 
Agency-Health Act; and H.R. 4176, the 
LGBTQI+ Data Inclusion Act. 
Two of these bills represent the 
progress that can be achieved when we 
work together on legislation that is 
important to the American people. It 
underscores what can happen when we 
work together, regardless of party ide-
ology. I do recognize the hard work 
that the members of the Committee on 
Energy and Commerce put into the Re-
storing Hope for Mental Health and 
Well-Being Act of 2022. 
This package is the first major effort 
put forth to address our Nation’s men-
tal health crisis since the lockdowns 
began 
for 
coronavirus. 
Following 
COVID–19 and the pandemic, we have 
seen a tremendous increase in the 
youth mental health conditions, sui-
cides, and overdose deaths exacer-
bating the mental health crisis we al-
ready faced prior to the pandemic. 
This bill maintains the flexibility for 
States to make funding decisions that 
best addresses the needs of their com-
munities. The spending in this bill— 
and this is important—the spending in 
this bill is fully offset and targets fund-
ing toward the treatment of serious 
mental health conditions instead of 
generalized wellness programs that 
may not have an impact. 
Included in this package is the Into 
the Light for Maternal Mental Health 
and Substance Use Disorders Act of 
2022. That is actually a bill that I in-
troduced with Representatives YVETTE 
CLARKE, 
JAIME
HERRERA
BEUTLER, 
YOUNG KIM, and DORIS MATSUI. Our bill 
authorizes and funds existing programs 
to help those impacted by maternal 
mental health conditions. Substance 
use disorders and mental health condi-
tions are among the top leading causes 
of death for women who are pregnant 
and recently pregnant. 
When I was a resident at Parkland 
Hospital in the 1970s, the top three 
causes of maternal mortality: hemor-
rhage, preeclampsia, or hypertension. 
Now, the preeminent causes are suicide 
and drug overdose—entirely prevent-
able causes of maternal mortality. This 
bill will help us address that. So I am 
very encouraged to see that move 
across the finish line. 
I also supported an amendment by 
Representative DREW FERGUSON to in-
clude the Behavioral Health Interven-
tions Guidelines Act—he likes to call it 
the BIG Act. Representative FERGUSON 
and I actually introduced that as a 
standalone bill, but this amendment 
was made in order during the Com-
mittee on Rules yesterday. 
The BIG Act passed the House last 
year with broad support. It requires 
the 
Substance 
Abuse 
and 
Mental 
Health Services Administration to de-
velop best practices for schools to es-
tablish behavioral health intervention 
teams. 
I heard from one of my colleges in 
Texas, Texas Tech University out in 
Lubbock. 
Texas 
Tech 
University 
Health Sciences Center brought to me 
their successful program to provide 
training for behavioral health inter-
vention and schools in West Texas. 
You know, sometimes in school, it is 
no secret who the kid is that is getting 
into trouble, the kid who is actually 
self-identified. And this is a way to 
provide the guidelines for that behav-
ioral intervention that can be life- 
changing and lifesaving. 
By 
establishing 
these 
behavioral 
intervention teams, the BIG Act helps 
to encourage prevention measures and 
interventions before youth mental con-
ditions worsen or become even more se-
rious. Unfortunately, we continue to 
see the consequences of not addressing 
mental health issues. 
This rule also contains H.R. 5585, the 
Advanced Research Project Agency- 
Health Act, or ARPA-H. ARPA-H is 
modeled after the Defense Advanced 
Research Projects Agency, DARPA, 
and the Advanced Research Projects 
Agency in Energy. 
The goal is to bring a greater focus 
on the research and development of our 
greatest healthcare challenges in areas 
where the private biopharmaceutical 
companies are unlikely to explore for 
scientific or business reasons. 
ARPA-H was initially authorized in 
fiscal year 2022 in the omnibus budget 
and placed within the National Insti-
tutes of Health. But placing ARPA-H 
within another department of the De-
partment of Health and Human Serv-
ices risks its independence, and its 
independence is its entire reason for 
being. Without its independence, I 
don’t know that ARPA-H would have 
the ability to foster innovation. But 
this bill secures ARPA-H as an agency 
independent of the influence of the rest 
of the executive branch. And that is 
important. 
With significant Republican input, 
we ensure that this legislation also is 
fiscally responsible. We also make cer-
tain that the goal and mission of this 
agency is focused on research and de-
velopment and provides accountability 
for this new research agency when sub-
mitting feedback from projects sup-
ported by the agency, as well as prohib-
iting the Federal funding to China and 
to Russia. 
The bipartisan manager’s amend-
ment also ensures that the number of 
offices is cut from 14 to 6—what I call 
bureaucratic 
streamlining—and 
at 
least two of those six offices are actu-
ally dedicated to research and develop-
ment and the administrative costs of 
the agency—and this is extremely im-
portant—the administrative costs are 
capped at 15 percent. 
ARPA-H will provide the ability to 
focus on high-risk transformative tech-
nologies to improve healthcare and 
healthcare outcomes for all Americans. 
The final bill that we are considering 
today requires federally administered 
surveys to collect information on sex-
ual orientation and gender identity. 
The list of surveys affected by this bill 
is over 130 and it does include the 
every-10-year Census. 
The information requested by this 
bill is deeply personal and involves a 
person’s internal state of being. I have 
to point out that the Federal Govern-
ment does not have a good track record 
of protecting Americans’ private infor-
mation, as evidenced by data breaches 
over the last several years. 
The final concern with this bill is it 
is asking about very personal informa-
tion without a clear statutory or regu-
latory need, but still we are prohibited 
from asking a person’s citizenship sta-
tus. I don’t think I need to say any 
more about that. 
Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to 
the rule, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. ROSS. Madam Speaker, I include 
in the RECORD a June 11, 2021, CNN 
Business 
article 
entitled 
‘‘LGBTQ+ 
Americans aren’t fully counted by the 
government. That’s a big problem.’’ 
[From CNN Business, June, 11, 2021] 
LGBTQ+ AMERICANS AREN’T FULLY COUNTED 
BY THE GOVERNMENT. THAT’S A BIG PROBLEM 
(By Anneken Tappe and Alicia Wallace) 
Government data help policymakers find 
and fix problems for people in need. But 
that’s tricky if some groups aren’t rep-
resented in the stats. 
This is the case for the LGBTQ+ commu-
nity, and it’s a huge problem. Here’s an ex-
ample: The government’s monthly jobs re-
port shows how many men and women, 
Black, White, Asian and Hispanic workers 
are unemployed. The stats lay bare a lot of 
inequities, but there are no comparable fed-
eral data on LGBTQ+ workers. 
‘‘We are invisible in federal statistics, 
when it comes to some policymakers,’’ said

Justin Nelson, co-founder and president of 
the National LGBT Chamber of Commerce 
(NGLCC). 
Put more bluntly: ‘‘If we don’t get count-
ed, we don’t count,’’ said Cathy Renna, com-
munications director at the National LGBTQ 
Task Force. 
Official stats, including the Census, are 
used to decide how federal funds are distrib-
uted—to the tune of $1.5 trillion. But data 
gaps in the jobs reports, health surveys and 
the decennial Census affect millions of peo-
ple: 5.6 percent of US adults identify as les-
bian, gay, bisexual or transgender, according 
to a Gallup survey published in February. 
Official data are needed ‘‘to ensure that 
LGBT people are included in efforts to re-
duce unemployment through increased labor 
force participation, as well as to monitor 
compliance with anti-discrimination provi-
sions,’’ researchers at the UCLA School of 
Law’s Williams Institute wrote earlier this 
year in support of adding LGBTQ+ questions 
to the Current Population Survey, which 
helps create the jobs report. 
Recent research has found higher rates of 
poverty, unemployment, health disparities, 
and 
workplace 
discrimination 
among 
LGBTQ+ adults, according to the Williams 
Institute. The negative outcomes were even 
greater among transgender individuals and 
LGBTQ+ people of color. 
Examples of how data can change out-
comes for the LGBTQ+ community include 
the establishment of the Massachusetts 
Commission on LGBTQ youth, school train-
ing services and ongoing research after 
former Governor William Weld sought to re-
spond to an increase in LGBTQ+ youth sui-
cides; the improvement of individuals’ med-
ical care following research asking patients 
about their sexual orientation and gender 
identity; and the creation of equity pro-
grams within the Los Angeles County De-
partment of Children and Family Services 
following a study that showed LGBTQ+ 
youth were overrepresented in the youth fos-
ter system and experienced harsher treat-
ment. 
Although independent research from the 
Williams Institute and established pollsters 
such Gallup have provided some data about 
the community, that research just doesn’t 
carry the same weight as government stats 
in leading to funding of direct services and 
addressing the needs of people in the queer 
community, Renna said. 
Across government agencies, academics 
and the LGTBQ+ community itself, people 
have expressed a desire to better understand 
the needs of that population. The govern-
ment is doing research to figure out how to 
best ask about sexual orientation and gender 
identity. 
But the business of big, robust data sets is 
complicated. 
Government statistics are pretty sophisti-
cated and the methodology behind surveys 
goes through a lot of prodding. But when it 
comes to the LGBTQ+ community, govern-
ment institutions haven’t done enough re-
search yet to make broader improvements to 
the data. 
The worry is that reporting errors on ques-
tions surrounding sexual orientation and 
gender identity may lead to much bigger er-
rors in the eventual data. 
‘‘Questions for relatively small populations 
must be formulated especially carefully; if 
they are not, even relatively small sampling 
or reporting errors can lead to large errors in 
estimates,’’ the US Bureau of Labor Statis-
tics told CNN Business in an email. 
The questions the Census Bureau asks also 
have to go through an established process to 
review wording and effectiveness. Ultimately 
the Office of Management and Budget ap-
proves any new questions. 
When the government surveys households, 
for example to learn about America’s em-
ployment situation, one person answers 
questions for other members of their house-
hold. That can make it harder to get accu-
rate data on members of the LGBTQ+ com-
munity, especially if a person hasn’t come 
out to their family, or if the survey respond-
ent is uncomfortable talking about another 
household member’s sexual orientation or 
gender identity. 
‘‘Not everyone’s out,’’ Renna added. ‘‘Some 
of us live in places where you can be fired if 
you come out.’’ 
The NGLCC, which leans heavily on com-
munity-driven surveys and private sector re-
search, has yet to meet with the Census and 
BLS on inclusive data-gathering efforts, Nel-
son said. But he said he is optimistic about 
the Biden-Harris Administration’s efforts to 
broaden the scope of its data collection. 
President Joe Biden last week, in officially 
recognizing June as Pride Month, urged Con-
gress to pass the Equality Act to ensure civil 
rights 
protections 
for 
members 
of 
the 
LGBTQ+ community and their families. 
‘‘We are a strong part of the economic fab-
ric . . . not just in Pride Month,’’ Nelson 
said. ‘‘We need to get inclusive on data col-
lection immediately, because the sooner we 
can normalize that data collection, the less 
opportunity there is for erasing it.’’ 
The people behind government surveys are 
doing research to move toward a world in 
which official data are more inclusive. 
Figuring out how to best ask about things 
as personal as sexual orientation and gender 
identity is at the forefront of that research. 
The willingness and ability to answer ques-
tions about sexual orientation and gender of 
other people is just as critical, the Census 
Bureau told CNN Business. 
The last BLS research paper on the topic is 
from 2017. While it’s feasible for the govern-
ment to ask these questions, the paper rec-
ommends more in-depth analysis. 
‘‘The reality is that it’s very chicken and 
egg,’’ Renna said. ‘‘If you don’t have the 
data, you can’t understand the community. 
If you don’t ask the community questions, 
you don’t have the data.’’ 
Some government surveys already collect 
information on gender identity and sexual 
orientation, including the National Health 
Interview Survey, the National Crime Vic-
timization Survey and the National Survey 
of Children’s Health. 
Last year, the 2020 Census made history by 
including same-sex marriage and same-sex 
unmarried partners as options on its survey. 
The Bureau of Labor Statistics—which uses 
surveys to compile the government’s month-
ly jobs report—began including same-sex 
married couples in its tally of married work-
ers in January last year. 
Considering that only 20 percent LGBTQ+ 
people live in same-sex married households, 
these surveys leave out the vast majority of 
the community, said Kerith Conran, the 
Blachford-Cooper research director and dis-
tinguished scholar at the Williams Institute. 
And there is a greater dearth of data espe-
cially when it comes to LGBTQ+ youth, 
transgender people and gender identity, she 
added. 
Earlier this year, Conran and her col-
leagues highlighted those and other inequi-
ties in a public comment urging the US Cen-
sus Bureau and BLS to add sexual orienta-
tion, gender identity and sex assigned at 
birth questions to the Current Population 
Survey. 
‘‘There are ongoing health and economic 
inequities that aren’t going to go away un-
less people start paying attention to them,’’ 
she said in an interview with CNN Business. 
Data on sexual orientation and gender 
identity aren’t collected consistently across 
states—for example, only 30 states included 
the SOGI module in a US Centers for Disease 
Control-backed behavioral risk survey in 
2019. This creates big gaps in the data, par-
ticularly in regions such as the South and 
Midwest, Conran added. 
‘‘Those are the places where non-discrimi-
nation protections and social acceptance are 
also lacking,’’ she said. ‘‘In the places where 
people 
probably 
have 
worse 
conditions, 
[there are] less data available to see what’s 
going on for people.’’ 
Ms. ROSS. Madam Speaker, we rely 
on all kinds of data to inform our pol-
icymaking. 
Right 
now, 
LGBTQI+ 
Americans 
aren’t represented in Federal statis-
tics, like for unemployment, poverty, 
health, and discrimination. 
This gap severely impacts our ability 
to make smart decisions that may af-
fect their community, let alone deci-
sions that will help those in their com-
munity. It is imperative that we begin 
to let these individuals count in our 
Federal data system just as we do race, 
ethnicity, gender, and age. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, Republicans will imme-
diately amend the rule to consider H.R. 
471, the PAUSE Act, introduced by 
Representative YVETTE HERRELL. This 
bill would prohibit President Biden 
from rescinding title 42 authority, the 
public health order that allows for un-
documented migrants to be imme-
diately expelled. 
This bill would provide for the strin-
gent enforcement of title 42 and pro-
hibit the Departments of Homeland Se-
curity and Health and Human Services 
from weakening its implementation. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to insert the text of this 
amendment into the RECORD
along 
with extraneous material immediately 
prior to the vote on the previous ques-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, here 
to explain the amendment is our new-
est Member of the United States House 
of Representatives, newest member of 
the 
Republican 
Conference, 
newest 
member 
of 
the 
Texas 
delegation, 
MAYRA FLORES, sworn in last night on 
June 21, after winning the special elec-
tion in the 34th District in the State of 
Texas. Our colleague Filemon Vega had 
vacated that seat. 
Important to note here, she is the 
first Mexican-born woman elected to 
Congress—the first. Her husband is a 
Customs and Border Protection officer, 
giving her a firsthand understanding of 
the crisis on our southern border. She 
began her working life in the cotton 
fields near Memphis, Texas, and is now 
representing a Texas community in 
Congress.

FLORES), our newest Member, to ex-
plain her amendment. 
Mr. FLORES. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to oppose the 
previous question so that we can imme-
diately consider H.R. 471, Representa-
tive YVETTE HERRELL’s bill, to enforce 
title 42 at the border. 
As a Mexican-born legal immigrant, 
Border Patrol wife, and a mother, I 
know firsthand how out of control our 
border crisis is. Our south Texas com-
munities are hurting because of this 
crisis, and our people feel totally ig-
nored by our government. Dangerous 
drugs are pouring across the border. 
Eighty percent of the fentanyl killing 
Americans comes into our country at 
the southern border. 
Human traffickers are taking advan-
tage of our open border to conduct 
their evil and heartbreaking trade. 
Criminal organizations are in total 
control of our southern border. 
Last month alone, 240,000 illegal im-
migrants were encountered entering 
our country, a new record. And those 
are just the people who were caught. 
The true number is undoubtedly far 
higher. And in 2022 so far, 50 people on 
the FBI’s terror watch list have been 
arrested by the Border Patrol. That is 
higher than the previous 5 years com-
bined. 
Title 42 is one of the only things 
keeping the crisis at the border from 
getting even worse, allowing Border 
Patrol the flexibility to expel some il-
legal immigrants quickly. And yet, for 
some inexplicable reason, President 
Biden and the Democrats want to end 
title 42 for good. Doing this would put 
out an even larger welcome sign to 
drug, sex, and human traffickers. It 
would send the signal across the world 
that America’s border is open, and that 
the administration has no intention of 
upholding the rule of law. 
b 1245 
As a Border Patrol wife, I also know 
that the morale of our agents is al-
ready low. Eliminating title 42 would 
discourage those brave men and women 
even further as they struggle to con-
tain the never-ending surge of illegal 
immigration that the Biden adminis-
tration is trying to make even worse. 
I came to this country legally, as did 
so many in south Texas, for the chance 
to live the American Dream. My legal 
immigration experience as a child was 
incredible. That legal process is how it 
should be done, and I want more chil-
dren to have that same positive experi-
ence. My experience should not be rare. 
We need to focus on legal immigra-
tion and how to make the process fast-
er and affordable for those good people 
who want to come to this amazing 
country. Yet, today, we have a Federal 
Government that encourages illegal 
immigration, knowing the dangers that 
they will have to go through. 
Not only does this put our country at 
risk, but it also puts thousands of 
women and children in harm’s way as 
they make this dangerous journey and 
face 
the 
possibility 
of 
horrendous 
abuse. 
My heart breaks every time Border 
Patrol agents tell me about the human 
tragedies they see unfolding before our 
eyes. Yet, the Biden administration 
seems determined to make things 
worse. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my new col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to 
stand with our border communities and 
support Representative HERRELL’s crit-
ical bill to preserve title 42. The hu-
manitarian crisis at our border de-
mands we do nothing less. 
I believe that securing our border 
shouldn’t be political. It is the right 
thing to do. 
Ms. ROSS. Madam Speaker, a group 
of 156 organizations committed to ad-
vancing equality and opportunity for 
the LGBTQI+ community, including 
the YWCA, wrote to Congress in sup-
port of H.R. 4176. 
They said in their letter: ‘‘Collecting 
this information in federally supported 
surveys, such as the Current Popu-
lation Survey and the National Health 
Interview Survey, is essential to im-
proving the well-being of LGBTQI+ 
populations across key areas of life. 
For example, although data are lim-
ited, research indicates that LGBTQI+ 
communities 
experience 
disparities 
across multiple domains of life com-
pared to non-LGBTQI+ populations.’’ 
This inclusive data ‘‘is a crucial tool 
to better identify and address these 
disparities and to promote more equi-
table outcomes and opportunities for 
LGBTQI+ communities.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD the letter signed by the 156 
organizations. 
JUNE 14, 2022. 
Hon. CAROLYN MALONEY, 
House Committee on Oversight and Government 
Reform, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. RAU´ L GRIJALVA, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR
CHAIRWOMAN
MALONEY
AND
CON-
GRESSMAN GRIJALVA: As a group of 156 orga-
nizations committed to advancing equality 
and opportunity for lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
transgender, queer, intersex, and other sex-
ual and gender diverse (LGBTQI+) people in 
the United States, we are writing to voice 
our enthusiastic support for the amendment 
in the nature of a substitute and passage of 
the LGBTQI+ Data Inclusion Act (H.R. 4176). 
The LGBTQ Data Inclusion Act, as intro-
duced, would facilitate the collection of vol-
untary, self-disclosed demographic data on 
sexual 
orientation 
and 
gender 
identity 
across federal surveys. The amendment in 
the nature of a substitute would add vari-
ations in sex characteristics (also known as 
intersex traits) to the data voluntarily col-
lected, and would accordingly change the bill 
title to the LGBTQI+ Data Inclusion Act. 
Collecting this information in federally sup-
ported surveys (such as the Current Popu-
lation Survey and National Health Interview 
Survey) is essential to improving the well- 
being of LGBTQI+ populations across key 
areas of life. For example, although data are 
limited, research indicates that LGBTQI+ 
communities experience disparities across 
multiple domains of life compared to non- 
LGBTQI+ populations. This includes evi-
dence of higher rates of poverty, unemploy-
ment, and economic instability experiences 
of homelessness and housing insecurity; 
worse mental and physical health outcomes; 
heightened 
barriers 
to 
access 
adequate 
health care, and widespread experiences of 
discrimination. Due to the intersecting 
forces 
of 
racism, 
xenophobia, 
ableism, 
ageism, and transphobia, for LGBTQI+ com-
munities of color, LGBTQI+ people with dis-
abilities, 
LGBTQI+ 
older 
adults, 
and 
transgender people, these disparities are 
often even more pronounced. LGBTQI+-in-
clusive data collection is a critical tool to 
better identify and address these disparities 
and to promote more equitable outcomes and 
opportunities for LGBTQI+ communities. 
Currently, most surveys fielded by the fed-
eral government not collect data on sexual 
orientation, gender identity, or variations in 
sex characteristics. For example, although 
some surveys, such as the decennial census 
and American Community Survey, ask ques-
tions that allow for the identification of co-
habitating same-sex couples, it is estimated 
that only 1 in 6 LGBTQ individuals are cap-
tured by those kinds of questions. Although 
progress has been made in recent years, the 
overall lack of routine data collection on 
sexual orientation, gender identity, and vari-
ations in sex characteristics poses a signifi-
cant obstacle for policymakers, researchers, 
service providers, and advocates dedicated to 
improving the wellbeing of LGBTQI+ com-
munities, especially those living at the 
intersection of multiple marginalized identi-
ties. 
The federal government collects survey 
data on a wide range of subjects and popu-
lations and is uniquely positioned to engage 
in LGBTQI+-inclusive data collection to gen-
erate accurate, consistent, and representa-
tive data at a scale that allows for the 
disaggregation necessary to describe the di-
versity of LGBTQI+ communities. As dem-
onstrated in the recent consensus report by 
the National Academies, questions about 
sexual orientation, gender identity, and vari-
ations in sex characteristics can and should 
be added to federally supported surveys. By 
doing so, federal agencies can take meaning-
ful steps to fulfill the Biden-Harris adminis-
tration’s priorities to promote equity for 
LGBTQI+ and other underserved commu-
nities through various actions, including but 
not limited to expanding data collection ef-
forts. 
Passage of this bill is essential to better 
understand the experiences of LGBTQI+ 
communities, generate policy solutions that 
are inclusive of LGBTQI+ people and their 
needs, and to evaluate the effectiveness of 
those policies to reduce disparities and ad-
vance equity. Again, we strongly support the 
amendment in the nature of a substitute for 
the LGBTQI+ Data Inclusion Act (H.R. 4176) 
and urge Congress to quickly take up and 
adopt this important proposal. 
Thank you for your consideration. Please 
do not hesitate to contact Caroline Medina 
and Madeline Shepherd with any questions.

Ms. ROSS. Madam Speaker, I ask the 
gentleman if he is prepared to close, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, we have two bills 
included in this rule that enjoy bipar-
tisan support. They have come through 
regular order in committee. They had 
legislative hearings. They had sub-
committee markups. They had full 
committee markups. All Members were 
able to participate, and all Members 
were able to be heard. This is the way 
it should be done. 
The 
Restoring 
Hope 
for 
Mental 
Health and Well-Being Act will help 
Americans 
struggling 
with 
mental 
health issues that have been exacer-
bated 
by 
the 
lockdowns 
of 
the 
coronavirus. 
Establishing ARPA–H as an inde-
pendent agency—so critical—will allow 
for innovative, transformative health 
technologies and treatments that will 
benefit all Americans. 
Unfortunately, it doesn’t stop there. 
There does not appear to be a statutory 
or regulatory justification for requir-
ing Federal surveys to collect informa-
tion on an individual’s gender and sex-
ual identity. If we are going to ask 
about gender identity, we should also 
be asking about citizenship. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote 
on the previous question and a ‘‘no’’ 
vote on the rule. I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. ROSS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, the three bills in 
this rule have the potential to trans-
form the health and opportunities of 
millions of Americans. 
The 
Restoring 
Hope 
for 
Mental 
Health and Well-Being Act reauthor-
izes and establishes 35 critical pro-
grams that provide access to mental 
health care and substance use disorder 
treatment across the country. 
Recognizing the benefits of tele-
health during the COVID–19 pandemic, 
this bill promotes behavioral health in-
tegration into primary care through 
increased access to telehealth as part 
of the pediatric mental health care ac-
cess grant program reauthorization. 
The bill also requires self-funded, 
non-Federal governmental healthcare 
plans to comply with mental health 
parity laws. Mental health care is 
healthcare, and it is time we treat it as 
such. 
The 
Advanced 
Research 
Projects 
Agency-Health Act will jump-start our 
Nation’s investment in medical re-
search and innovation. I am privileged 
to represent part of North Carolina’s 
Research Triangle Park and see the 
breakthroughs that happen there. By 
establishing and funding ARPA–H, we 
ensure that research like this will con-
tinue, that more people will be able to 
access groundbreaking treatments and 
cures, and that our Nation remains a 
leader in medical innovation. 
The LGBTQI+ Data Inclusion Act 
will equip our government agencies 
with the data they need to reduce bar-
riers and challenges facing this com-
munity. Good data helps us make good 
policy. Without data, we are forced to 
legislate blindly and guess at solutions 
to close disparities. 
Madam Speaker, I note that the 
LGBTQI+ Data Inclusion Act does not 
mandate that anyone disclose informa-
tion about their gender identity or sex-
ual orientation. Under this bill, indi-
viduals choose whether to share that 
information or not. 
This bill, which we take up during 
Pride Month, will help us ensure the 
LGBTQI+ community is represented in 
policies aimed at closing disparities 
and helping underserved groups. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote 
on the rule and the previous question. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mr. BURGESS is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 1191 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 10. Immediately upon adoption of this 
resolution, the House shall proceed to the 
consideration in the House of the bill (H.R. 
471) to prohibit the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services from lessening the strin-
gency of, and to prohibit the Secretary of 
Homeland Security from ceasing or lessening 
implementation of, the COVID–19 border 
health provisions through the end of the 
COVID–19 pandemic, and for other purposes. 
All points of order against consideration of 
the bill are waived. The bill shall be consid-
ered as read. All points of order against pro-
visions in the bill are waived. The previous 
question shall be considered as ordered on 
the bill and on any amendment thereto to 
final passage without intervening motion ex-
cept: (1) one hour of debate equally divided 
and controlled by the chair and ranking mi-
nority member of the Committee on Energy 
and Commerce; and (2) one motion to recom-
mit. 
SEC. 11. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not 
apply to the consideration of H.R. 471. 
Ms. ROSS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time, and I 
move the previous question on the res-
olution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on ordering the previous 
question on the resolution. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, on

The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and 
add extraneous material on H.R. 7666. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 7666, the Restoring Hope for 
Mental Health and Well-Being Act of 
2022, and I thank Ranking Member 
RODGERS for working with me these 
past few months to develop this com-
prehensive legislation that will help 
address the mental health and sub-
stance use disorder crisis facing mil-
lions of Americans. 
This bill is needed today more than 
ever. Americans report rising anxiety 
and depression and increased use of al-
cohol, opiates, and other substances. 
One in five adults are battling a mental 
illness. Suicide is now the second lead-
ing cause of death for children ages 10 
to 14, and earlier this year the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention re-
leased a report finding that 4 in 10 high 
school students said they felt persist-
ently 
sad 
or 
hopeless 
during 
the 
COVID–19 pandemic. The opioid crisis 
also continues to devastate families 
and communities all around the Na-
tion. 108,000 people lost their lives due 
to drug overdoses just last year alone. 
The 
Restoring 
Hope 
for 
Mental 
Health and Well-Being Act will help re-
store hope for millions of Americans. 
The bill strengthens and expands more 
than 30 critical programs that collec-
tively support mental health care and 
substance 
use 
disorder 
prevention, 
care, treatment, and recovery support 
services in communities across the Na-
tion. 
As the Nation prepares for the launch 
of the 988 National Suicide Prevention 
Lifeline dialing code next month, H.R. 
7666 provides key crisis response ef-
forts, establishing the Substance Abuse 
and Mental Health Services Behavioral 
Health Crisis Coordination Office and 
requiring the development of crisis re-
sponse best practices. The legislation 
also continues investments in critical 
mental health and substance use serv-
ices block grant funding to States, ter-
ritories, and Tribes. 
The Restoring Hope Act includes cru-
cial provisions to meet the challenges 
of the Nation’s opioid epidemic, ex-
panding and ensuring timely patient 
access to lifesaving treatment for 
opioid use disorders through the elimi-
nation of barriers to treatment. It in-
cludes Representative TONKO’s MAT 
Act, which eliminates the X-waiver, a 
burdensome registration requirement 
that establishes arbitrary caps on the 
number of patients a provider can treat 
for 
opioid 
use 
disorder 
using 
buprenorphine. 
This bill also establishes a one-time, 
8-hour training requirement on treat-
ing and identifying substance use dis-
orders that providers must complete

before their first registration or re-
newal of a license to dispense con-
trolled substances. 
H.R. 7666 also helps bolster the be-
havioral health workforce capacity and 
training. It also increases access to 
mental health and substance use dis-
order care and coverage by applying 
the mental health parity law to State 
and local government workers, such as 
teachers and frontline workers. 
The legislation also supports the 
mental health of children and young 
people. It continues investment in the 
integration of behavioral health into 
pediatric primary care through Pedi-
atric Mental Health Access Grants and 
enhances research at the National In-
stitutes of Health on the cognitive, 
physical, and socioemotional impacts 
of modern technology and multimedia 
on infants, children, and adolescents. 
I can’t stress enough that this is an 
epidemic that focuses a lot on children 
and adolescents. Older youth need help 
with suicide prevention and other men-
tal health support and substance use 
disorder services. Students in higher 
education need that help, and they get 
it through a program called the Gar-
rett Lee Smith Memorial Act. 
The bill also ensures that State Med-
icaid programs have resources to im-
plement and strengthen school-based 
mental 
health 
services 
while 
pre-
serving the continuity of coverage for 
justice-involved youth. These impor-
tant provisions will increase children’s 
access to care. 
Mr. Speaker, the scope and reach of 
this bipartisan legislation—and I stress 
that. This was reported out of the En-
ergy and Commerce Committee unani-
mously, Mr. Speaker. It is truly bipar-
tisan. It is going to help to support the 
mental health and well-being of mil-
lions of Americans, their families, and 
communities for years to come. 
I thank Members on both sides of the 
aisle, not only Ranking Member ROD-
GERS, but the subcommittee leadership 
as well, both Democrat and Repub-
lican. 
The reason that we try to do this on 
a bipartisan level and get everybody’s 
support is because we have a good 
chance of passing this in the Senate, 
which is also acting on similar legisla-
tion. We are hopeful that as a result of 
a large vote today, that will spur the 
Senate into action, and we can actu-
ally get this bill signed into law. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, 
Washington, DC, June 10, 2022. 
Hon. FRANK PALLONE, Jr., 
Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN PALLONE: This letter is to 
advise you that the Committee on the Judi-
ciary has now had an opportunity to review 
the provisions in H.R. 7666, the ‘‘Restoring 
Hope for Mental Health and Well-Being Act 
of 2022,’’ that fall within our Rule X jurisdic-
tion. I appreciate your consulting with us on 
those provisions. The Judiciary Committee 
has no objection to your including them in 
the bill for consideration on the House floor, 
and to expedite that consideration is willing 
to forgo action on H.R. 7666, with the under-
standing that we do not thereby waive any 
future jurisdictional claim over those provi-
sions or their subject matters. 
In the event a House-Senate conference on 
this or similar legislation is convened, the 
Judiciary Committee reserves the right to 
request an appropriate number of conferees 
to address any concerns with these or simi-
lar provisions that may arise in conference. 
Please place this letter into the Congres-
sional Record during consideration of the 
measure on the House floor. Thank you for 
the cooperative spirit in which you have 
worked regarding this matter and others be-
tween our committees. 
Sincerely, 
JERROLD NADLER, 
Chairman. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND COMMERCE, 
Washington, DC, June 13, 2022. 
Hon. JERROLD NADLER, 
Chairman, Committee on Judiciary, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN NADLER: Thank you for 
consulting with the Committee on Energy 
and Commerce and agreeing to be discharged 
from further consideration of H.R. 7666, the 
‘‘Restoring Hope for Mental Health and Well- 
Being Act of 2022,’’ so that the bill may pro-
ceed expeditiously to the House floor. 
I agree that your forgoing further action 
on this measure does not in any way dimin-
ish or alter the jurisdiction of your com-
mittee or prejudice its jurisdictional prerog-
atives on this measure or similar legislation 
in the future. I would support your effort to 
seek appointment of an appropriate number 
of conferees from your committee to any 
House-Senate conference on this legislation. 
I will ensure our letters on H.R. 7666 are in-
cluded in the report for this bill and entered 
into the Congressional Record during floor 
consideration of the bill. I appreciate your 
cooperation regarding this legislation and 
look forward to continuing to work together 
as this measure moves through the legisla-
tive process. 
Sincerely, 
FRANK PALLONE, Jr., 
Chairman. 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 7666, the Restoring Hope for 
Mental Health and Well-Being Act. 
We are taking urgent action to help 
States and communities provide life-
saving mental health care to people in 
need, especially for our children and 
those suffering from severe mental ill-
ness. 
I think about Austin, a 9-year-old 
boy who struggled to cope when his 
school was shut down, and his parents 
were going through a divorce. He was 
socially isolated and didn’t know where 
to turn. When he confessed suicidal 
thoughts to his mom, they faced long 
waiting lists and no beds for the care 
that he needed. 
Cases like Austin’s can’t be ignored. 
Parents, teachers, and medical profes-
sionals are talking about this every-
where I go. 
In Spokane, Washington, we are see-
ing more violence in our schools and 
rising crime. Drug overdose deaths and 
fentanyl poisoning were up 300 percent 
last year. There is an overwhelming 
sense of despair, anxiety, fear, and iso-
lation. This has been heightened by the 
horrific shootings in Uvalde and Buf-
falo. Especially for our children, we 
need to deliver hope and healing in 
every community in our country. 
This bill will help children in crisis 
and improve school safety. For exam-
ple, Congresswoman ASHLEY HINSON is 
leading with RICHARD HUDSON on a pro-
vision that will expand access to be-
havioral and mental health services to 
kids in schools. 
It also includes a solution I led on 
with Congresswoman YOUNG KIM to re-
authorize the Garrett Lee Smith Me-
morial Act, which supports commu-
nity-based youth and young adult sui-
cide prevention programs. 
Like with Representative FRENCH 
HILL’s solution in this, we are remov-
ing red tape, boosting treatment ac-
cess, and making sure communities 
have resources to combat the sub-
stance use disorder epidemic in Amer-
ica. 
More than 100,000 people are dying a 
year, and our communities are in des-
perate need of help to prevent, treat, 
and rescue people from overdoses and 
despair. 
The priorities in this bill are tar-
geted to responsibly address our most 
urgent needs so we can build stronger 
families, communities, and a brighter 
future. We are accomplishing this by 
stopping duplicative programs and cut-
ting the deficit by $200 million. The 
bulk of the programs in this bill are 
block grants that have been successful 
in providing our States and commu-
nities with the resources and flexibili-
ties to meet the specific and unique 
needs in combating mental illness and 
addiction while keeping the Federal 
Government out of the decisionmaking 
process for treatments and care. 
By protecting charitable choice, we 
are also making sure faith-based and 
religious organizations are competing 
on an equal footing. This is a victory 
for conscience protections. 
The provisions in this bill also sup-
port care for maternal mental health 
and substance use disorders, which are 
among the leading causes of death for 
pregnant and postpartum women. We 
are saving lives and caring for women 
at every stage of pregnancy and be-
yond. 
Mr. Speaker, I again urge support for 
this legislation. I thank Chairman PAL-
LONE for his leadership and for working 
with us on solutions from our col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle. 
While families and communities will 
lead the way to address the root causes 
of despair, isolation, violence, and 
overdose deaths that are tearing nearly 
every community apart and destroying 
people’s lives, this bill takes an impor-
tant step forward to help them in these 
efforts. 
We are taking action to turn this de-
spair into hope. Children like Austin in 
communities like mine in eastern 
Washington are counting on it. Let’s

deliver today and keep building on this 
work. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Illi-
nois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY), who chairs our 
Subcommittee on Consumer Protection 
and Commerce. 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I 
am so happy about this bipartisan leg-
islation and really excited about the 
changes that are going to be made, be-
cause for all 24 years that I have been 
in Congress, I have not had a townhall 
meeting or a meeting with my con-
stituents where the issue of access and 
affordability of mental health services 
has not come up. 
Right now, our country is facing a 
mental health crisis like we have not 
seen before. We are seeing that families 
are losing loved ones to COVID, to sui-
cide, and to overdoses. 
This bill will provide vital services in 
substance abuse and mental health, 
four things mainly. We will see a 
strengthening of parity. We voted for 
parity a long time ago, and now we are 
going to make sure that mental health 
and physical health are on the same 
page. 
We are going to have 30 programs 
that are going to strengthen and reau-
thorize mental health services. We are 
going to have more education for doc-
tors. We are going to have doctors be 
able to have more patients for certain 
mental assistance treatment. 
This is a great bill. We should all be 
proud to vote for it. 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Minnesota (Mr. EMMER), 
who has led on important provisions 
for children in this bill. 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the ranking member, soon to be chair, 
for yielding. 
I rise in support of H.R. 7666, the Re-
storing Hope for Mental Health and 
Well-Being Act. 
After years of lockdowns and social 
isolation, the mental health of our Na-
tion’s 
citizens, 
and 
especially 
our 
youth, is at an all-time low. But H.R. 
7666 begins to return us to a better 
path, so I thank the chairman and 
ranking member for all their hard 
work to make this a reality. 
I am especially pleased that portions 
of two bills that I had the pleasure of 
working on with my colleague from 
Maryland were included in this legisla-
tion. One such provision would amend 
the Medicaid Inmate Exclusion Policy 
to allow incarcerated juveniles who 
have been detained pending trial to 
continue to receive Medicaid coverage. 
Pretrial detainees are, by definition, 
presumed innocent. As a matter of due 
process, we should not be denying crit-
ical health benefits to anyone who has 
not been convicted of a crime. 
From a practical standpoint, reforms 
to the Medicaid Inmates Exclusion Pol-
icy will help our local law enforcement 
better manage the shockingly high per-
centage of inmates who suffer from 
mental illness. 
H.R. 7666 also includes language to 
create a behavioral health coordi-
nating office, another issue that I have 
had the pleasure of working on. Many 
Federal programs to address the men-
tal health crisis currently lack clear, 
unified 
direction 
and 
coordination, 
which is a recipe for redundancy and 
waste. 
b 1415 
The reforms in today’s bill will bring 
all the major agencies into the room, 
including the Secretary of Education, 
the Secretary of Health and Human 
Services, and the Director of National 
Drug Control Policy to develop a uni-
fied approach to addressing topics 
ranging from substance abuse care to 
delivery of better telehealth. 
There is always more work to be 
done to improve the mental health of 
our Nation, but H.R. 7666 is an impor-
tant step, and one we need now more 
than ever. 
Madam Speaker, I once again urge 
my colleagues to support this critical 
legislation. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. SARBANES), who has been in-
volved with these health and behav-
ioral issues for a long time. 
Mr. 
SARBANES. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 7666, the Restoring Hope 
for Mental Health and Well-Being Act 
of 2022. 
Our Nation, as you know, is facing a 
continuing mental health and sub-
stance use crisis that has only been ex-
acerbated by the COVID–19 pandemic. 
This crisis touches the lives of individ-
uals in each and every corner of our 
country and has a particularly acute 
impact on children and teens. 
Recognizing this, last October, the 
American Academy of Pediatrics, the 
American Academy of Child and Ado-
lescent Psychiatry, and the Children’s 
Hospital Association declared a na-
tional emergency in child and adoles-
cent mental health. 
To wrap our arms as a society around 
children facing mental and behavioral 
health challenges, I recently joined in 
introducing H.R. 7248, the Continuing 
Systems of Care for Children Act, with 
my colleagues Representatives Joyce, 
Underwood, and Gimenez, a bipartisan 
bill that I am proud is included in H.R. 
7666 today. 
This legislation would reauthorize 
for 5 years two important grant pro-
grams; one that provides comprehen-
sive community mental health services 
for children with serious emotional dis-
turbances, as well as the Youth and 
Family TREE Program. 
These programs connect children and 
teenagers to services that meet their 
individual needs and have a sustained 
positive impact on their well-being. 
As we confront the compounding 
challenges posed by our mental health 
and behavioral health crisis and our 
national gun violence crisis, Congress 
must provide our children every re-
source they need to lead safe and 
healthy lives. 
That is why it is so important that 
we pass the Restoring Hope for Mental 
Health and Well-Being Act today to 
bolster mental health services and bet-
ter support our communities now and 
into the future. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on this legislation. 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Kentucky (Mr. GUTHRIE), 
our lead on the Subcommittee on 
Health. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 7666 the Restoring 
Hope for Mental Health and Well-Being 
Act is a significant bill that will help 
support our mental health workforce, 
increase access to pediatric mental 
health 
treatment, 
and 
help 
make 
schools safer. 
This bill will bolster substance use 
disorder prevention, treatment, and re-
covery resources. The Committee on 
Energy and Commerce has worked on 
this for many months, held hearings, 
and reported it out by a voice vote in 
May. 
Recognizing children’s mental health 
has been negatively impacted by school 
closures, ineffective lockdowns, and in-
creased violence. This bill provides spe-
cific resources to help communities re-
spond to the children’s mental health 
crisis. This legislation also supports 
community mental health services for 
children with serious emotional dis-
turbances through crisis-care service 
and early intervention activities. 
The need to strengthen resources for 
children’s mental health has been fur-
ther 
heightened 
after 
the 
horrific 
school violence we have seen in Uvalde. 
This bill also works to reauthorize 
the Garrett Lee Smith Suicide Preven-
tion Program, provide funding for a 
suicide prevention lifeline, and update 
a major block grant that States use to 
provide support to those with serious 
mental illness. 
In addition to supporting those with 
mental illness, the legislation helps 
those with substance use disorders. 
Kentucky has seen a drastic rise in 
overdoses throughout the pandemic 
and, nationally, the CDC estimates 
that drug overdoses exceeded 107,000 be-
tween November 2020 and November 
2021. 
Many of these drug overdoses have 
been caused by synthetic opioids, like 
illicit fentanyl poisoning, which were 
involved in about 70 percent of all Ken-
tucky overdoses in 2021. 
Ultimately, fighting the drug over-
dose epidemic will require a two- 
pronged approach: Equipping our law 
enforcement with the tools they need 
to keep these deadly poisons off our 
streets and providing recovery and 
treatment resources. 
Through the passage of this bill, we 
are advancing the second part of this

approach by increasing access to crit-
ical treatment and recovery resources 
for people from all walks of life and 
every stage of life. This includes re-
sources for moms and pregnant women 
by supporting care for maternal health 
and substance use disorders, which are 
among the leading cause of death for 
pregnant and postpartum women. 
In addition, this legislation also has 
a 
provision 
led 
by 
Representative 
BUCSHON, 
alongside 
Representatives 
Miller-Meeks, Axne, and Pappas, to re-
move unnecessary regulatory barriers 
to help those with opioid use disorder 
seek the care that they need as quickly 
as possible. 
The Timely Treatment for Opioid Use 
Disorder Act removes a Federal re-
quirement of having to live with opioid 
disorder for more than 1 year to be ad-
mitted for in-person treatment. I am 
proud that my bill, the Substance Use 
Prevention, Treatment, and Recovery 
Services Block Grant Act of 2022, which 
I have worked together with my col-
leagues, Messrs. TONKO, MCKINLEY, and 
Ms. WILD, is also included in this bill. 
The legislation would deliver more 
coordinated 
substance 
use 
disorder 
care as well as explicitly reauthorizing 
funding for recovery support services, 
which include workforce training and 
others. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to vote for this bill. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. TONKO), who chairs our Envi-
ronment and Climate Change Sub-
committee. 
Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of the Restoring Hope 
for Mental Health and Well-Being Act. 
I offer my thanks to Chairman PAL-
LONE and Ranking Member RODGERS 
and their staffs for their tireless work 
on this bill. It is yet another example 
of the profound good our committee 
can produce when we work together in 
a collaborative and bipartisan fashion. 
This strongly bipartisan legislation 
will take several steps to improve men-
tal health and substance use care. 
Importantly, H.R. 7666 includes my 
Mainstreaming Addiction Treatment 
Act, which will eliminate outdated bar-
riers that prevent more people in need 
from having access to buprenorphine, a 
lifesaving drug. I have worked on this 
legislation for years and was pleased to 
see it advance out of committee with a 
strong bipartisan majority. 
By passing this legislation, we will 
vastly expand access to addiction med-
icine and move us toward a system of 
treatment on demand for those strug-
gling with addiction. 
It is not hyperbole to say this is one 
of the most meaningful steps that Con-
gress has taken to date to address the 
opioid epidemic. It will save countless 
lives, and I am indeed grateful for the 
bipartisan push here to get it over the 
finish line. 
H.R. 7666 also includes a bill that I 
authored to reauthorize and strengthen 
the Substance Use Prevention and 
Treatment Block Grant, which serves 
as the foundation for State’s substance 
use prevention and treatment pro-
grams. 
We made important improvements to 
the block grant, including clarifying 
that recovery support services are eli-
gible for funding through this program. 
We are going to keep working to in-
crease funding levels and hopefully im-
plement a recovery set-aside, ensuring 
that all States invest in critical recov-
ery services. 
Taken together, the pieces of the Re-
storing Hope for Mental Health and 
Well-Being Act will truly make a dif-
ference to families and communities 
struggling with mental health and sub-
stance use challenges. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues 
to support this critically important 
legislation that delivers hope to our 
communities, delivers hope to the 
doorstep of our families. 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL), a 
leader on this issue, who sponsored the 
underlying bill that is incorporated in 
this package. 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank Mr. PALLONE and Mrs. MCMOR-
RIS RODGERS for their excellent bipar-
tisan leadership in bringing these bills 
to the floor. It is the way Congress is 
supposed to work. 
Mr. Speaker, I didn’t know anyone 
who died of a drug overdose when I was 
in high school or college. But my two 
sweet kids can count five or six of their 
peers who have been lost to suicide, 
drug overdose-related. It is heart-
breaking. Everybody in this House 
knows the horrifying 107,000 losses we 
have seen from opioid deaths last year. 
So I do, in fact, rise in support of 
H.R. 7666, and to discuss my co-pre-
scribing legislation that was included 
in this mental health package. My bill 
seeks 
to 
prevent 
opioid 
overdoses 
through co-prescription. This effort 
was inspired by my home State of Ar-
kansas, which is one of 14 States that 
has co-prescribing now. 
Co-prescribing is when a doctor pre-
scribes an opioid overdose reversal 
drug like naloxone along with the pre-
scription. My legislation encourages 
co-prescribing when medically appro-
priate. It also supports existing stand-
ing orders to increase laypersons’ ac-
cess to opioid overdose reversal drugs 
like naloxone. 
Statistical modeling reported to the 
International Journal of Drug Policy 
suggests that high rates of naloxone 
distribution 
among 
laypersons 
and 
emergency personnel could avert 21 
percent of opioid overdose deaths. The 
majority of overdose death reduction 
would be as a result of that increased 
naloxone distribution to patients. 
Mr. Speaker, in 2021, 551 of our citi-
zens of Arkansas are alive today be-
cause of a co-prescription legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, the data is clear. Co- 
prescribing saves lives, and that is why 
I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 
7666. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. O’HALLERAN), a member of 
the Committee on Energy and Com-
merce. 
Mr. O’HALLERAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the chairman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
7666, the Restoring Hope for Mental 
Health and Well-Being Act, legislation 
that works to increase the accessibility 
of our mental health care system and 
breaks down the unique barriers to 
care for rural communities that are 
facing it. 
Each year, hundreds of thousands of 
Arizonians do not receive the mental 
health care they need. Without access 
to this essential care, our families and 
our communities suffer. 
In recent years, we have lost too 
many loved ones to opioid abuse, sui-
cide, and senseless violence in our com-
munities. It has gone on far too long. 
As a homicide investigator in Chicago, 
I can tell you of the hundreds and hun-
dreds of these types of cases I saw day 
in and day out. 
Affordable, accessible mental health 
care plays an important role in holis-
tically addressing each one of these 
issues. That is why I worked with my 
colleagues on the Committee on En-
ergy and Commerce, a bipartisan ef-
fort, to bring this urgently needed leg-
islation to the House floor for a vote. 
By investing in workforce education 
and training, and supporting critical 
mental health programs, the Restoring 
Hope for Mental Health and Well-Being 
Act works to address the provider 
shortage millions of Americans are ex-
periencing and expands access to the 
care our vulnerable and underserved 
communities need. 
I am pleased to see the initiative to 
reauthorize 
and 
improve 
critical 
SAMHSA programs included in this 
bill. In Arizona, more than five people 
die every day from overdoses. This cri-
sis is tearing entire families and com-
munities apart. 
Our legislation would assist in devel-
oping coordinated local opioid response 
plans, expand access to medications 
that reverse an opioid overdose, and 
improve substance use disorder and 
mental health treatment for homeless 
individuals. 
Our bill also invests in mental health 
care for our children through programs 
that serve a wide range of ages and 
mental health needs, including suicide 
prevention for students. 
Mr. Speaker, it is time we fill those 
gaps, and I urge my colleagues to vote 
for this bill. 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Texas 
(Mr. 
TONY 
GONZALES), whose community under-
stands the importance of hope and 
healing like no other right now. 
Mr. TONY GONZALES of Texas. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 
7666, the Restoring Hope for Mental 
Health and Well-Being Act of 2022.

June 22, 2022 
Texas, 38 miles from where I grew up. 
This despicable crime led to the death 
of 19 innocent children and two teach-
ers. As a father of six, I am absolutely 
heartbroken. 
As a Congressman who represents 
Uvalde, I am focusing on delivering 
change. The change starts with ad-
dressing the serious lack of mental 
health resources in our country. 
b 1430 
In a 2022 report by Mental Health 
America, Texas was ranked as the 
worst State for access to mental health 
care. In rural communities, that gap is 
felt even more intensely. 
It is in places like Uvalde that men-
tal health clinicians are few and far be-
tween, and parents have to drive more 
than 4 hours roundtrip for access to in-
patient care. Communities like Uvalde 
are desperately in need of mental 
health resources now and well into the 
future. 
That is why I am proud to support 
this bipartisan package that will com-
mit significant resources to mental 
health awareness, training, and treat-
ment. 
It is time for Congress to address the 
solution to the mental health crisis in 
America, and that starts with sup-
porting H.R. 7666. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from New 
Hampshire (Ms. KUSTER), a member of 
the Energy and Commerce Committee. 
Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 7666, the Re-
storing Hope for Mental Health and 
Well-Being Act of 2022. 
It has never been more urgent to pass 
this comprehensive legislation that 
will 
help 
deliver 
essential 
mental 
health and substance use disorder 
treatment and support to communities 
across this country. 
Americans continue to lose loved 
ones to addiction and mental health 
struggles every day. Mr. Speaker, 2021 
marked the deadliest year yet, with 
nearly 108,000 overdose deaths here in 
the United States. In Nashua, New 
Hampshire, in my district, the rate of 
fatal overdoses doubled from March to 
April just this year, and it is on track 
to reach the highest number of opioid 
deaths since the epidemic began. 
We cannot wait another day to pass 
this critical legislation. 
As founder and co-chair of the Bipar-
tisan Addiction and Mental Health 
Task Force, I am pleased to see the Re-
storing Hope for Mental Health and 
Well-Being Act include many of the 
bills from our task force agenda, bills 
like 
the 
Mainstreaming 
Addiction 
Treatment Act to remove outdated 
barriers that prevent healthcare pro-
viders from prescribing essential treat-
ment for substance use disorder. 
I am also pleased to see the Restor-
ing Hope for Mental Health and Well- 
Being Act include the KIDS CARE Act, 
legislation I introduced with Congress-
man HUDSON to improve Medicaid in 
schools and provide mental health 
screenings for justice-involved youth. 
Importantly, H.R. 7666 addresses the 
many unmet needs of communities 
that have suffered because of inad-
equate mental health resources, from 
bolstering grants for depression screen-
ing and suicide prevention to strength-
ening the behavioral health workforce. 
I support this legislation because it 
responds to the urgency of today’s cri-
sis and will improve mental health and 
addiction care all across the country. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman PAL-
LONE and his staff for his leadership on 
this bill and the Speaker for giving us 
the opportunity to discuss this legisla-
tion. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlemen from North Dakota (Mr. ARM-
STRONG), a leader on the committee. 
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in strong support of the Re-
storing Hope for Mental Health and 
Well-Being Act. 
This bipartisan mental health pack-
age includes my legislation, the Sum-
mer Barrow Prevention, Treatment, 
and Recovery Act. This bill reauthor-
izes several substance use disorder pro-
grams administered by SAMHSA that 
help local communities provide sub-
stance use disorder and mental health 
services to those most in need. 
This is particularly important for 
rural States like North Dakota, where 
individuals struggle to access all treat-
ment options that may work for them. 
The 
package 
also 
includes 
the 
Mainstreaming Addiction Treatment 
Act, or MAT Act. The MAT Act would 
remove the burdensome requirement 
that a healthcare practitioner apply 
for a separate waiver, known as the X 
waiver, through the Drug Enforcement 
Agency to prescribe certain drugs for 
substance use disorder treatment. 
The X waiver requirement limits ac-
cess to lifesaving treatment, which is 
particularly painful considering recent 
news that drug overdose deaths hit a 
record high of more than 107,000 in 2021. 
Lastly, I offer my support for an 
amendment I offered with my friend 
Congressman TRONE of Maryland that 
will come to the floor soon. Our amend-
ment would add the State Opioid Re-
sponse Grants Act to this program. 
This amendment will provide $8.75 
billion over 5 years in flexible financ-
ing for State Opioid Response grants 
and Tribal Opioid Response grants, pro-
viding States and Tribes certainty and 
stability 
to 
implement 
prevention, 
treatment, and recovery. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER), the House majority 
leader. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairman and ranking member for 
the work they have done together and 
with the committee to bring this very 
important bipartisan bill to the floor. I 
thank them both for their hard work, 
and the committee for its hard work, 
in compiling this bipartisan package to 
combat two of the most important 
issues, Mr. Speaker, facing commu-
nities today: mental health and drug 
addiction. 
The COVID–19 pandemic exacerbated 
mental health and addiction challenges 
that were already present in our com-
munities. For those already experi-
encing severe depression, anxiety, or 
even substance abuse and addiction dis-
orders, the pandemic made it harder to 
access mental health care and essential 
help and resources, and it created, of 
course, much greater anxiety. 
This bill would reauthorize key men-
tal health and addiction programs 
while helping to strengthen commu-
nities’ crisis response. 
There are many important programs 
included, but I will highlight just a 
few. 
Mr. Speaker, among them is legisla-
tion from my friend Representative 
DAVID TRONE to help States expand the 
availability of high-quality recovery 
housing for treatment from substance 
abuse. Representative TRONE has been 
a leader on this issue as co-chair of the 
Bipartisan 
Addiction 
and 
Mental 
Health Task Force. 
Mr. Speaker, also included is legisla-
tion from my friends Representatives 
CINDY AXNE and CHRIS PAPPAS to revise 
opioid treatment program criteria to 
help those in need of treatment access 
it more quickly. 
Our in-house pediatrician, Represent-
ative KIM SCHRIER, authored a provi-
sion to help children and teens who 
have had their lives upended by the 
pandemic access the mental health 
care and services that they so badly 
need. 
Mr. Speaker, I also mention a critical 
section added by Representative SUSIE 
LEE to provide important resources for 
virtual peer support programs. Rep-
resentative LEE knows how much her 
constituents have benefited from these 
types of programs and how much more 
good they can do if given the proper re-
sources. 
Representative 
TONKO
from 
New 
York, included legislation to expand 
access to prescription medications that 
help patients overcome addiction dis-
orders. 
Mr. Speaker, these are just a few of 
the very beneficial policies included in 
this legislation that will improve lives 
and, indeed, save lives. 
I am so proud of the Energy and 
Commerce Committee and 
all 
the 
Members whose legislation is included 
in this bipartisan package, which dem-
onstrates how we can join together, 
Democrats and Republicans, to pass 
important legislation and show those 
we serve they are not alone in facing 
these challenges. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope this strong vote 
today will help move these critical 
policies through the Senate and see 
them quickly enacted into law. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2

H5778 
June 22, 2022 
Washington (Ms. SCHRIER), a member 
of the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee. 
Ms. SCHRIER. Mr. Speaker, I express 
my support for H.R. 7666, the Restoring 
Hope for Mental Health and Well-Being 
Act of 2022. 
In over 20 years as a pediatrician, I 
saw steadily escalating levels of men-
tal illness in my patients. There was a 
big uptick after 2007 that many asso-
ciate with ubiquitous social media use. 
Of course, the pandemic further accel-
erated rates of depression, anxiety, eat-
ing disorders, and self-harm. We are 
seeing 9-year-olds with eating disorders 
and 10-year-olds with suicidal ideation. 
This is alarming. 
We all agree that our children need 
help, but resources are limited. There 
just aren’t enough behavioral health 
specialists out there to meet the need, 
particularly in rural areas like some of 
those I represent. 
There are ways to extend the reach of 
people who have dedicated their lives 
to supporting our mental health, to le-
verage those resources so they stretch 
a little further. One example is the 
Partnership Access Line, or PAL, that 
I was able to access as a pediatrician. If 
I was seeing a patient with a more 
complicated behavioral health concern, 
something really beyond the scope of a 
general pediatrician, I could get a psy-
chiatrist on the line and in-the-mo-
ment advice on how to treat that pa-
tient. 
Another example is integrative care, 
where a mental worker works along-
side physicians and other healthcare 
providers, providing support as needed 
throughout the day for patients who 
are struggling with mental illness. 
These programs and more are sup-
ported in the package of bills we will 
be voting on this week, including mine, 
the 
Supporting 
Children’s 
Mental 
Health Care Access Act. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this excellent 
bill. 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Mrs. DINGELL), a member of 
the committee. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of the Restoring Hope for Men-
tal Health and Well-Being Act of 2022. 
I thank all of my committee mem-
bers on both sides for months of work 
on this important bipartisan legisla-
tion, which reauthorizes and strength-
ens critical mental and behavioral 
health programs that will help address 
public health issues like the opioid epi-
demic, which claimed over 107,000 lives 
in the United States last year alone. 
The mental health package before us 
contains strong mental health parity 
provisions that my colleague Congress-
woman KATIE PORTER and I led. This 
will close a critical gap in healthcare 
coverage for mental health and sub-
stance abuse treatment for thousands 
of frontline workers across the coun-
try. 
It also includes a provision I worked 
on with my friend and colleague, Con-
gressman FRENCH HILL, that provides 
incentives for co-prescribing when a 
doctor pairs an opioid prescription 
with a prescription of an opioid over-
dose reversal drug like naloxone. This 
is a proven method to reduce overdose 
deaths. 
Finally, it is good to see consider-
ation of an amendment I coauthored 
with Congressman MCKINLEY cracking 
down on suspicious orders of opioids, 
which will help further curb abuses and 
save lives. 
Mr. Speaker, all of us have had fam-
ily members or know someone who has 
had a mental health crisis or issue or 
suffered from depression. For too long, 
people have been afraid to even ac-
knowledge it, to seek help, or to get 
help. There has been a stigma associ-
ated with it. Today, all of us on both 
sides of this aisle need to help remove 
that stigma. 
My sister died of a drug overdose, and 
my father was a drug addict. Perhaps 
we wouldn’t have suffered some of the 
traumas had people not been afraid to 
speak of it. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a strong package 
that will improve our national re-
sponse, and I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill. 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. BILIRAKIS), a 
leader on the committee and on this 
legislation. 
Mr. 
BILIRAKIS. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the ranking member and the 
chairman for this very important bill. 
I rise in strong support of H.R. 7666, 
the Restoring Hope for Mental Health 
and Well-Being Act, which reauthorizes 
and improves key SAMHSA block 
grant programs for mental health and 
substance use disorder prevention and 
treatment services. These are all tar-
geted toward helping our constituents 
who 
have 
struggled 
with 
anxiety, 
stress, and isolation. 
Sadly, our Nation is experiencing an 
unprecedented mental health crisis, 
particularly among our children and 
teens. It has only gotten worse during 
the COVID pandemic, Mr. Speaker. We 
have seen a disturbing spike in rates of 
depression, 
self-harm, 
suicide 
at-
tempts, and death among teens. Teen 
depression, in particular, has risen by 
60 percent. 
We cannot afford to wait any longer 
to address this mental health and ad-
diction crisis, and this package pre-
sents much-needed solutions that will 
enact meaningful changes to help com-
bat the trends we have seen. 
Specifically, I am very glad to see in 
the manager’s amendment a provision I 
have long advocated for that will re-
quire HHS to conduct research on 
smartphone and social media use by 
adolescents and the effects of such use 
on emotional and behavioral health. 
b 1445 
All of us agree on the need to better 
protect our children and their mental 
health from social media, and this is an 
excellent start. We are also going to 
consider an amendment I am proud to 
support with my good friend RODNEY 
DAVIS that will contain H.R. 2355, the 
Opioid Prescription Verification Act, 
to help prevent opioid abuse through e- 
prescribing. 
In closing, this is a strong, bipartisan 
package, and I urge my colleagues to 
fully support it. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Mrs. FLETCHER), who is also a 
member of the Energy and Commerce 
Committee. 
Mrs. FLETCHER. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the chairman for his leadership 
and support and making it possible for 
us to be here today to pass the Restor-
ing Hope for Mental Health and Well- 
Being Act of 2022. It is an important ef-
fort, and I am so glad that the bipar-
tisan bill that I introduced last year 
with Congresswoman JAIME HERRERA 
BEUTLER, the Collaborate in an Orderly 
and Cohesive Manner Act, H.R. 5218, is 
included in it. 
Many people first display symptoms 
of a mental health condition or sub-
stance use disorder in the primary care 
setting. Often they can’t access the 
necessary follow-up treatment, it is ei-
ther too expensive or too difficult for 
them to find the necessary mental 
health professional or overcome other 
obstacles, including stigma. 
That is why enabling patients to ac-
cess behavioral health treatment at 
their first point of care is critical, and 
that is what this bill does. 
The collaborative care model ad-
dresses obstacles including stigma, a 
shortage 
of 
mental 
health 
profes-
sionals, and cost by integrating behav-
ioral healthcare within the primary 
care setting, with their trusted family 
doctors, which allows patients to ac-
cess the care they need in a setting 
where they feel most comfortable. 
The collaborative care model is a 
measurement-based model featuring a 
primary care physician, a psychiatric 
consultant, and care manager all work-
ing together to provide mental health 
care for patients and ensuring that 
that care is delivered effectively. 
There are more than 90 published 
trials demonstrating its success in dif-
ferent settings for both adults and chil-
dren. It extends the reach of our psy-
chiatrists, which is essential as we 
work to address demand in the face of 
workforce shortages. It is covered by 
Medicare, most private insurers, and 
many State Medicaid programs, alle-
viating the huge financial burden that 
can often be associated with accessing 
mental health care. 
Despite its proven effectiveness, im-
plementation of the collaborative care 
model remains low because of the up-
front costs and lack of technical assist-
ance for providers. This bill addresses 
this roadblock by providing grant fund-
ing for States to work with primary

care physicians and practices looking 
to adopt this model. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues, 
Congresswomen HERRERA BEUTLER and 
ESHOO and Chairman PALLONE for ad-
dressing the mental health crisis in 
this country. 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. 
Speaker, may I inquire as to how much 
time is remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Washington has 141⁄2 
minutes remaining. The gentleman 
from New Jersey has 81⁄2 minutes re-
maining. 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from California (Mrs. KIM), 
who is a leader on a provision within 
the larger package. 
Mrs. KIM of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank Ranking Member RODGERS for 
yielding. I rise today in support of the 
Restoring Hope for Mental Health and 
Well-Being Act of 2022. 
The pandemic and shutdowns left 
many Americans, especially women 
and children, feeling isolated, anxious, 
and alone. Depression, self-harm, sub-
stance abuse, and suicide have reached 
crisis levels. 
I am glad we can help provide mean-
ingful, targeted hope and healing to 
communities who need it. I am proud 
that two bills that I worked on, the 
Into the Light for Maternal Mental 
Health Act and the Garrett Lee Smith 
Memorial Act, were included in this 
package to prevent student suicide and 
support women facing mental health 
and substance abuse disorders during 
pregnancy. 
We must keep working to turn de-
spair into hope. 
As a mom of four and a new grandma, 
I will always fight for the health and 
well-being of communities in southern 
California and across our Nation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
pass this commonsense, bipartisan H.R. 
7666. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Oregon 
(Mr. BLUMENAUER). 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased we are taking up this bipar-
tisan legislation today to reauthorize 
critical programs to address mental 
health. 
We cannot, however, address mental 
health without acknowledging and ad-
dressing the climate impact. Our chil-
dren are experiencing twin crises of 
mental health and climate change anx-
iety. 
Last week, the Oregon Health Au-
thority released a report raising the 
alarm of the effect of climate change 
on our youth. From the impact of cli-
mate-related disasters to climate anx-
iety, our children are facing stress and 
trauma that we need to address with 
them. 
If we want to invest in our youth and 
their mental health, we must acknowl-
edge the impact and give them hope 
that we understand and are working to 
reduce that threat. We simply cannot 
leave climate out of the conversation. 
I appreciate the work that Chairman 
PALLONE has done for both youth men-
tal health and climate, and I look for-
ward to working with him to address 
both these critical issues. 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER), 
who is a leader on the issue. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank the gentlewoman for yield-
ing. 
Mr. Speaker, we are all witnessing 
the decline in America’s mental health 
brought about by the COVID–19 pan-
demic. Between family members and 
friends, we all are either affected our-
selves or we know someone with a men-
tal health condition. I am a father and 
a grandfather, and there is nothing 
more important to me than the safety 
and well-being of my children and 
grandchildren. 
The urgency to address this mental 
health crisis has become more dire as 
we are seeing how fear, anxiety, and 
particularly 
isolation 
have 
com-
pounded these issues. We owe it to our 
constituents to turn despair into hope 
and keep our children safe at school 
and in their community. 
The 
Restoring 
Hope 
for 
Mental 
Health and Well-Being Act will help 
communities provide much-needed life-
saving care to our children. America’s 
children are our Nation’s future. It is 
time we take action and protect our 
loved ones and pass the Restoring Hope 
for Mental Health and Well-Being Act. 
Mr. Speaker, I support this bill, and 
I encourage my colleagues to do the 
same. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Virginia 
(Mr. BEYER). 
Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, the pan-
demic magnified suicide risk, anxiety, 
and depression with two out of five 
adults reporting symptoms of anxiety 
and depression. The Kaiser Family 
Foundation 
released 
a 
report 
this 
morning that found that suicide death 
rates rose by 12 percent from 2010 to 
2020—with rates rising fastest among 
people of color, younger people, and 
our good citizens in rural areas. 
Help can’t come fast enough. 
I thank the Rules Committee for al-
lowing 
the 
Katko-Napolitano-Beyer 
amendment to be included in the first 
en bloc today. This reauthorizes and 
ensures sufficient funding and provides 
oversight of the National Suicide Pre-
vention Lifeline. 
As the House and Senate finalize any 
mental health package to be signed 
into law, I want to flag my bill with 
ADAM
KINZINGER—the 
Campaign 
to 
Prevent Suicide—which was passed by 
the committee and the House last year. 
It would help educate the American 
public both on the new 988 suicide life-
line number and also change the cul-
ture from one in crisis and avoidance 
to one that connects to resources. 
SAMHSA has stated that the cam-
paign is crucial to the success of 988. 
We can save an untold number of lives. 
988 can be among the most important 
bipartisan success we have ever had. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Chair PALLONE, 
CATHY
MCMORRIS
RODGERS, and the 
committee staff for their commitment 
to tackling mental health. It is 2022, 
and we know far, far more than ever 
before in human history. It is time to 
put our healing knowledge to work. 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Iowa (Mrs. MILLER- 
MEEKS). 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank Ranking Member MCMORRIS 
RODGERS for yielding time. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 7666, the Restoring Hope for 
Mental Health and Well-Being Act. 
This bill takes serious action to ad-
dress mental health and substance use 
disorder, especially as we are coming 
out of the COVID–19 pandemic. I am 
pleased that the House was able to 
come together to create a bipartisan 
solution to deliver real results to the 
American people, both adults and chil-
dren. 
I 
also 
thank 
Ms. 
SCHRIER
for 
partnering with me as we introduced 
the 
Supporting 
Children’s 
Mental 
Health Care Access Act, which is in-
cluded in this bipartisan package. This 
bill reauthorizes two grant programs 
that support pediatric mental and be-
havioral health services and interven-
tions. Reauthorizing the pediatric men-
tal health care access grant program is 
an important step in ensuring that our 
students have equal access to quality 
mental health care. 
I would also like to thank Represent-
atives AXNE, BUCSHON, and PAPPAS for 
joining me to introduce the Timely 
Treatment for Opioid Use Disorder Act 
which is also included in H.R. 7666. This 
bill increases access to treatment for 
individuals suffering from opioid use 
disorder. Opioid addiction does not 
have a timeline and does not discrimi-
nate. Patients should be able to begin 
treatment for opioid addiction as soon 
as possible. 
I strongly encourage all of my col-
leagues to join me in supporting H.R. 
7666, the bipartisan, results driven, and 
commonsense Restoring Hope for Men-
tal Health and Well-Being Act. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the chairman for yielding. As I 
begin—I am going to ask the chairman 
to enter into a colloquy—but, first, let 
me express my strong support for H.R. 
7666 and the work that has been done in 
a bipartisan manner by both the chair-
man and the ranking member, and the 
importance of the issue of dealing with 
opioid addictions and other addictions 
that require this additional work. I am 
gratified to rise to support that. 
I thank Chairman PALLONE, and ask, 
as I said, that he engages in a colloquy 
with me on the need to support the 
mental health needs of trauma victims 
impacted by trauma and, yes, mass

shootings. I think I have been here in 
the United States Congress during Col-
umbine, Virginia Tech, Sandy Hook, 
Mother Emanuel, Santa Fe, Parkland— 
and the list goes on—and tragically 
Uvalde with 19 children, 2 adults, and 1 
individual who died of heartbreak. I 
was in Uvalde, and I saw the impact on 
our children, to see 9-year-olds—9-year- 
olds—crying and saying that because I 
spoke to them, they said you are mak-
ing me happy because you spoke to me, 
and you said you care. Out of the 
mouth of a 9-year-old. 
So we know there is a mental health 
crisis as relates to the trauma of those 
who certainly are survivors and those 
who are in the community. 
We also know that too many families 
and children in this country are hurt-
ing from the preventable epidemic of 
gun violence, shootings, and mass cas-
ualty events. These tragic events have 
lasting scars on the families, friends, 
and communities. I have seen this pain 
with my own eyes. And so I am inter-
ested in—as my amendment that I 
withdrew 
indicated—is 
there 
a 
prioritization of those children who are 
impacted by trauma? 
Madam Speaker, I would like to be 
able to work with Chairman PALLONE 
on this issue. Will the gentleman yield 
for the purpose of a colloquy? 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
just wanted to stress that H.R. 7666 in-
cludes programs focused on supporting 
youth mental health. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. 
BEATTY). The time of the gentlewoman 
has expired. 
Mr. PALLONE. I thank the gentle-
woman for her leadership on this issue. 
In fact, H.R. 7666 includes programs fo-
cused on supporting youth mental 
health including due to such traumatic 
events that were mentioned by the gen-
tlewoman. 
The SAMHSA Garrett Lee Smith 
State/Tribal Youth Suicide Prevention 
and Early Intervention Program, for 
instance, and HRSA’s Pediatric Mental 
Health Care Access program, which 
helps integrate behavioral health into 
pediatric primary care, extends re-
sources to support Project AWARE, 
building student, families, and school 
behavioral health resiliency. Further, 
the bill provides support to com-
plement SAMHSA’s launch of the new 
988 National Suicide Prevention Life-
line dialing code next month that will 
expand access to crisis care support 
through call, text, or chat functions for 
millions of Americans. 
Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 
1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank the 
chairman for answering my questions 
regarding the Restoring Hope Act that 
there will be provisions for mental 
health care and services for children, 
families, and communities who experi-
ence 
these 
traumatic 
and 
violent 
events. 
I look forward working with the 
chairman on these vital resources. 
With your partnership I would like to 
continue to work with you and the ad-
ministration to ensure that when this 
legislation is enacted, the needs of the 
vulnerable victims and those closest to 
them are in the front of our minds. 
Will the gentleman commit to work-
ing with me on this matter? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has again ex-
pired. 
Mr. PALLONE. Let me just add, I am 
pleased to work with the gentlewoman 
from Texas on this critical matter. 
I thank her for her support in ensur-
ing children and families have access 
to the mental health support and serv-
ices they need to lead healthy and 
hopeful lives. 
Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 
30 seconds to the gentlewoman from 
Texas. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the chairman for his support. I 
will support this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise as a staunch advocate 
for mental health services to speak in favor of 
the Restoring Hope for Mental Health and 
Well-Being Act of 2022. 
This bill amends the Public Health Service 
Act to reauthorize critical mental health pro-
grams for those dealing with mental health or 
substance abuse disorders. 
H.R. 7666 works to mitigate some of the 
most pressing issues of our time by desig-
nating grants, expanding the availability of 
high-quality recovery housing, reauthorizing 
treatment programs, and combatting sub-
stance abuse. 
In 2019, an estimated 10.1 million people in 
the U.S. aged 12 or older misused opioids in 
the past year. Specifically, 9.7 million people 
misused 
prescription 
pain 
relievers 
and 
745,000 people used heroin. 
The bill eliminates a key restrictive classi-
fication of opioid addiction so that access to 
treatment programs is expanded. 
These issues disproportionately impact tribal 
communities. According to the American Ad-
diction Centers, 10% of Native Americans 
have a substance use disorder. 
H.R. 7666 specifically funds the prevention 
and treatment of mental health and substance 
use disorders for tribal populations. 
This is a needed step in protecting a com-
munity with a history of being mistreated by 
the Federal government. 
This bill’s expansion of access to mental 
health care services, most importantly of all, 
would make these services much more avail-
able to children and adolescents, who must al-
ways be our top priority. 
For example, this bill increases mental 
health services for our youth by integrating be-
havioral health into public education in primary 
schools and creating a grant for pediatric men-
tal health services. 
This legislation also addresses another 
pressing issue that afflicts young Americans: 
eating disorders. As many as 10 in 100 young 
women suffer from an eating disorder. 
H.R. 7666 provides federal funding for the 
identification and treatment of eating dis-
orders. 
But, above all, Mr. Speaker, who among all 
of our children, need mental health services 
more than those who have just experienced 
the unconscionable? Senseless shootings 
leave our students, some as young as five 
years old, devastated and vulnerable. 
As adults, the thought of having our peers 
murdered in front of us is disturbing. How 
much more traumatizing would that be for pre- 
school students? 
This bill acts as a conduit for protecting chil-
dren who are victims of a mass shooting or 
mass casualty event. 
Mass shootings, especially school shoot-
ings, can leave lethal and obvious physical 
wounds on victims. 
However, the long-lasting and subtle mental 
trauma is the invisible scar left on many sur-
vivors. Friends, family, and classmates often 
suffer with extreme guilt and sadness. 
There have been 278 mass shooting in this 
year alone. Firearms are now the leading 
cause of death for children and teens. 
In addition to those tragically killed, millions 
more are left behind, coping with these 
deaths. An estimated 3 million children in the 
US are exposed to shootings per year. 
Since Columbine, there have been 337 
school shootings and 311,000 students have 
experienced gun violence at school. Even 
more disturbing, just since Uvalde, there have 
been 65 mass shootings. 
This is not a one-state issue. From the 28 
killed at Sandy Hook in Connecticut, to the 17 
killed at Marjorie Stoneman-Douglas in Flor-
ida, to the 10 killed at Red Lake in Minnesota, 
to the 22 killed at Robb Elementary in my 
home state of Texas, school shootings have 
become a disgusting norm. 
Children exposed to violence, crime, and 
abuse are more likely to abuse drugs and al-
cohol; suffer from depression, anxiety, and 
posttraumatic stress disorder; fail or have dif-
ficulties in school; and engage in criminal ac-
tivity. 
These children don’t stay children forever. 
These mental health struggles translate to a 
life of pain and suffering where crime, drug 
use, and suicide are more likely. 
This trauma has real consequences: in the 
year 
following 
the 
2018 
massacre 
at 
Stoneman-Douglas High school, two students 
took their own life after suffering with the men-
tal anguish of the events they had lived 
through. 
Passage of this bill will not solve the gun 
crisis or mass shootings in this country. Only 
common-sense gun-control will do that. 
However, this bill will set a foundation for 
the government to address the toll of gun vio-
lence on children’s mental health. 
Additionally, enactment of this legislation 
demonstrates Congress’ support of victims of 
mass casualty events by prioritizing access to 
mental health services. 
Children are the future of our country. Far 
too many of them have their hopes and 
dreams stripped away by senseless shootings.

other country. These PBMs not only 
raise patient costs but are potentially 
engaged in anticompetitive behavior. 
The legislation before us today in-
cludes language requiring PBMs to 
issue reports to employer sponsors of 
health 
plans 
outlining 
information 
that they have been unwilling to pro-
vide to their customers, including 
copays applied by insurers to drug 
manufacturer costs, rebates received 
from manufacturers, and the PBM’s ra-
tionale for choosing certain brand 
name 
drugs 
over 
more 
affordable 
biosimilars, generics, or therapeutics 
for their formularies. 
Simply providing this information to 
the participants in group health plans 
is expected to save over $2 billion over 
10 years. These biannual, employer or 
sponsor-specific reports will allow par-
ticipants in group health plans to 
make informed decisions about the 
services their PBM is providing and re-
duce patient costs for prescription 
drugs. 
We cannot have a serious conversa-
tion about lowering drug prices in 
America without examining PBMs’ 
ever-growing influence. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. LEVIN). 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, the substance use 
disorder crisis has touched almost 
every American in one way or another. 
Too many families have felt the ex-
traordinary pain of burying a son or 
daughter, a father or a mother who 
struggled with the disease of addiction. 
Tragically, many families have also 
experienced the heartbreak and deep 
frustration that comes after a loved 
one enters a residential recovery home 
that ultimately doesn’t provide them 
with adequate care to get and stay on 
the path toward recovery. 
We must ensure that residential re-
covery homes meet a high standard of 
care and provide those who are strug-
gling with the support they need to re-
cover. 
We can and must do better. That is 
why I introduced the SOBER Homes 
Act, parts of which are included in H.R. 
7666, the legislation we are voting on 
today. It includes $1.5 million for a 
Federal study of the effectiveness of re-
covery housing and to identify rec-
ommendations promoting the avail-
ability of high-quality recovery hous-
ing. 
This legislation will help us better 
understand where these facilities are 
falling short and how we can improve 
them to ensure everyone in recovery 
housing receives the help they need 
and deserve. 
Finally, I thank all the advocates 
who have been fighting so hard on this 
issue. The information from this effort 
will save lives, which is why I implore 
my colleagues to support this bill and 
vote ‘‘aye.’’ 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. 
JOYCE), a member of the Committee on 
Energy and Commerce. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
yielding. 
Right now, today, as we all are here 
in the Halls of Congress, our Nation is 
facing a mental health crisis. And this 
crisis followed 2 years of lockdowns 
and remote learning that have left so 
many Americans feeling isolated, lost, 
and, in some cases, hopeless. Particu-
larly, our young Americans feel all of 
these emotions. 
I rise today in support of this legisla-
tion that would help to address this 
crisis head-on by helping to ensure 
that those who are struggling can re-
ceive the help that they so desperately 
need, that they need, and they need our 
attention to it right now. 
The 
Restoring 
Hope 
for 
Mental 
Health and Well-Being Act of 2022 ex-
pands access to care for millions of 
Americans, 
including 
children 
and 
teenagers who are desperately in need 
of this assistance. 
As a doctor, I have treated patients 
who have later lost their lives to men-
tal illness. Just last week, we had phy-
sicians here on the Hill, pediatricians, 
family doctors, telling us that they 
have seen the shift of the pendulum; 
that they see on a daily basis more and 
more cases in their patients, specifi-
cally involving mental health. 
And there is not a single American 
who has not in some way been im-
pacted by the effects that mental ill-
ness is having today. 
In the past year, over 107,000 Ameri-
cans have lost their lives to drug 
overdoses. Far too many grandparents, 
far too many fathers, mothers, sons, 
and daughters are dying. We cannot 
wait to act any longer. We need to act 
and vote on this legislation. 
To help address the tragedy of addic-
tion, this bill increases support for 
opioid recovery programs that will help 
people who are struggling to receive 
the care that they need. 
This bill would go on to make mental 
health screenings a part of each per-
son’s annual physical exam and evalua-
tion and help to ensure that everyone 
who sees a doctor is able to have a con-
versation frankly, concisely, clearly, 
about their mental health and the 
mental health issues that they are fac-
ing. 
Most importantly, this bill would 
provide a whole-of-care approach that 
would fund prevention, treatment, and 
recovery services for the people who 
are suffering with addiction. We have 
worked as a committee, as a con-
ference addressing these important 
issues. 
I urge all of my colleagues to vote to 
pass this important piece of legisla-
tion. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE). 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, for 
too long, Americans, including chil-
dren, struggling with mental illness 
and substance abuse, have suffered in 
silence, intimidated by stigma and un-
able to access treatment. 
The 2019 Rhode Island Youth Risk Be-
havior Survey found that 15 percent of 
Rhode Island high school students re-
ported attempting suicide one or more 
times in the previous 12 months. That 
is 4 students in a class of 25. 
There is a mental health crisis in 
Rhode Island and throughout our coun-
try, and we have to address it now. 
The 
Restoring 
Hope 
for 
Mental 
Health and Well-Being Act will save 
lives by expanding access to mental 
health and substance abuse disorder 
treatment through: Establishing the 
Behavioral Health Crisis Coordination 
Office; reauthorizing critical public 
health programs to prevent suicide and 
expand access to mental health and 
substance use disorder treatment; and 
eliminating unnecessary limits on pro-
viders’ ability to prescribe treatments 
for opioid use disorder. 
I urge my colleagues to join with me 
in support of this critical legislation to 
save lives and to help us address addic-
tion all across our country. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Ohio 
(Mr. 
BALDERSON). 
Mr. BALDERSON. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Ranking Member RODGERS for 
this work. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 7666, the Restoring Hope 
for Mental Health and Well-Being Act. 
Lockdowns, isolations, economic in-
stability, disruptions to learning and 
daily routines. For well over a year, 
school closures, mask mandates, and 
online learning became the new normal 
for far too many young Americans. 
As a result, a new crisis is afoot in 
our country, one with potentially dire 
consequences for our future, a mental 
health crisis among younger Ameri-
cans. 
Today, nearly 7 in 10 parents of 
young children in Ohio are worried 
about their kids’ mental or emotional 
health. Drug overdose is now the lead-
ing cause of death of Americans ages 18 
to 45. Our kids are counting on us, and 
we are counting on them. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote 
on H.R. 7666. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
have no additional speakers. I am pre-

Mrs.

Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Indiana

Restore Hope for Mental Health and 
Well-Being Act of 2022. 
I am proud to be a member of a com-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5782 
June 22, 2022 
Though many challenges existed be-
fore the start of the COVID–19 pan-
demic, 21⁄2 years of widespread fear, so-
cial isolation, and financial uncer-
tainty has further increased Ameri-
cans’ need for mental health support 
systems. 
This bill reauthorizes many of the 
critical mental health programs Amer-
icans currently rely on, but also pro-
vides for new measures. 
Especially important to me is the in-
clusion of the TRIUMPH for New Moms 
Act, a bipartisan bill I coauthored with 
Representative BARRAGA´ N. It aims to 
establish a no-cost, interdepartmental 
task force to address the U.S. maternal 
mental health crisis by eliminating du-
plication and coordinating Federal re-
sources 
toward 
maternal 
mental 
health. 
This task force would also work 
closely with State Governors to allevi-
ate the maternal mental health chal-
lenges in their States. 
Current Federal efforts to support 
women suffering from maternal mental 
health conditions lack coordinated ac-
tion and organization toward this 
issue. And, as a result, 50 percent of 
these new moms never receive treat-
ment. 
This bill will increase mental health 
support for pregnant and new mothers 
by offering targeted solutions that 
have proven success, a fact that is par-
ticularly important to me, given Indi-
ana’s maternal mortality rate, which is 
one of the highest in the Nation. 
Passing this bill will help provide 
better support for future generations of 
mothers and children. 
Again, I thank the chair and ranking 
member of the Energy and Commerce 
Committee for their dedication to 
these issues, and I look forward to pas-
sage of H.R. 7666. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself the bal-
ance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I want to again just 
express appreciation to the chairman 
of the committee, all the Members that 
have participated in helping bring this 
package of very important mental 
health proposals to the House today. I 
urge a strong ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
As many have said, we have a mental 
health crisis. At a time when there is 
so much fear and anxiety and stress, 
we see increased suicide. We see drug 
overdoses, and it is time that we act, 
and act in a way that is really going to 
make a difference for America’s fami-
lies and our youth in particular. 
Madam Speaker, I urge support, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Let me just reiterate what the rank-
ing member said. This was really a bi-
partisan bill. I thank Mrs. RODGERS, 
Mr. GUTHRIE, Ms. ANNA ESHOO, and all 
the staff that worked so hard on this 
legislation. 
It is important that we have as big a 
vote as possible because this bill has a 
real chance of passing the Senate and 
getting to the President’s desk and will 
really address the mental health and 
substance abuse concerns that we have 
and the crisis that we have. So I urge 
everyone to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of H.R. 7666, the Re-
storing Hope for Mental Health and Well-Being 
Act. I am honored to have my bill, H.R. 721, 
the Mental Health Services for Students Act, 
included in this package. Today is a historic 
day in recognizing the need for more com-
prehensive school-based mental health re-
sources. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has upended the 
lives of our nation’s children and youth and 
added additional stressors that have signifi-
cantly strained and continues to strain their 
mental health and well-being. Children and 
youth across the nation continue to confront 
the traumatic challenges of this pandemic, in-
cluding disruptions to their lives, fear and anx-
iety about the virus, and the tragic death of 
loved ones. According to the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention (CDC), mental 
health disorders are chronic conditions that, 
without proper diagnosis and treatment, can 
lead to problems for children at home and in 
school, interfering with their health and future 
development. 
H.R. 721 acknowledges this problem by pro-
viding $130 million in competitive grants for 
school-based mental health programs nation-
wide. It expands the scope of the Project 
AWARE program by providing onsite licensed 
mental health professionals in schools across 
the country. 
H.R. 721 is based on the successful Youth 
Suicide Prevention Program that I helped es-
tablish with Pacific Clinics in Los Angeles 
County in 2001, after learning 1 in 3 Latina 
adolescents, age 9 to 11, had contemplated 
suicide. We need to secure the long-term 
availability of mental health services to ensure 
a bright future for our students, which my bill 
would help accomplish. 
I would like to thank the many advocates in 
and outside of Congress who have played an 
integral role in this legislation. H.R. 721 has 
86 bipartisan co-sponsors and has the support 
of over 50 mental health organizations, as well 
as local governments and teacher unions. I 
would also like to thank my co-lead Rep. JOHN 
KATKO, Chairman PALLONE and his staff, and 
my own staff who contributed toward today’s 
passage. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
support the underlying bill, H.R. 7666, which 
will help address our ongoing mental health 
crisis. it is now time to act on this bill and pro-
vide the necessary funding and resources to 
reach children and youth early on in life. 
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of this bill, which seeks to ad-
dress our national mental health and sub-
stance use crisis. I thank Congressman PAL-
LONE for this package of bills, which includes 
my bill, H.R. 7105, known as the STOP Act. 
The STOP Act advances a comprehensive 
and effective national effort on underage drink-
ing prevention, which includes a national 
adult-oriented media campaign and grants for 
community-based prevention coalitions. 
The legislation recognizes the importance of 
alcohol regulation and the fact that alcohol is 
different than other consumer products and is 
best regulated by states, consistent with the 
21st Amendment. 
Since the passage of the original STOP Act 
in 2006, we have witnessed a 12.7 percent 
decrease in alcohol use amongst 12-to-20- 
year-olds. Yet, alcohol continues to be the 
most widely used substance amongst youth, 
accounting for 3,900 deaths and 225,000 
years of potential life lost annually. 
We must continue to lead efforts to reduce 
underage alcohol use and ensure the safety of 
our youth. I urge my colleagues to vote YES 
on this bill. 
Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Madam Speak-
er, today, I rise in support of H.R. 7666, a bi-
partisan response to rising substance use dis-
orders and mental health needs in our com-
munities. 
The need for this bill is clear. 
We’ve heard about the growing mental 
health crisis, including about alarming rates of 
mental health hospitalizations, suicide rates 
and depression. The need for mental health 
services continues to grow, including among 
our children. In my district, the emergency de-
partment at Children’s Wisconsin saw a 60 
percent increase in young patients who at-
tempted suicide between 2020 and 2021. 
Substance misuse also remains a crisis in 
our 
communities. 
Milwaukee 
county 
has 
among the highest rates of overdose deaths in 
Wisconsin and has seen high numbers of 
emergency calls related to overdoses in the 
past few years. According to Milwaukee Coun-
ty, from 2014 to 2020, the opioid overdose fa-
tality rate in the country was 30.9 per 100,000 
persons, more than twice the rate statewide. 
This bill includes strong provisions to reau-
thorize and revitalize federal programs that 
support access to treatment and services, 
while boosting access to crisis services. The 
whole continuum of services needs to be 
strengthened to ensure that no one in need of 
help goes without. 
The bill would also reauthorize and increase 
funding for the Mental Health First Aid grant 
program. Mental Health First Aid is an evi-
denced-based program that teaches ordinary 
people how to identify, understand, and re-
spond to the signs of mental illness and sub-
stance use disorder. 
The bill would also reauthorize the Pediatric 
Mental Health Care Access Grant, a program 
that supports the ability of pediatric primary 
care providers to deliver mental health care 
with the help of rapid consultation with psychi-
atrists, social workers, and/or psychologists. 
The program also provides training and edu-
cation on early identification, diagnosis, and 
treatment of behavioral health condition, allow-
ing more families to access high-quality men-
tal health treatment in their pediatrician’s of-
fice. 
I am pleased to offer an amendment that 
will improve this bill by ensuring that state and 
local officials who administer programs serving 
pregnant and postpartum individuals are con-
sulted by those operating the new maternal 
mental health hotline. This hotline will provide 
free and confidential support before, during, 
and after pregnancy providing yet another tool 
for those in need. 
Through programs such as WIC, SNAP and 
the Maternal and Child Health Service Block 
grant, among others, the federal government 
reaches numerous pregnant and postpartum 
individuals. State and local officials are key

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1191, the gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) 
and the gentlewoman from Washington 
(Mrs. RODGERS) each will control 10 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
the eight mental health amendments 
under this en bloc consideration. Col-
lectively, these amendments further 
strengthen the bipartisan nature of the 
underlying comprehensive bill, the Re-
storing Hope for Mental Health and 
Well-Being Act of 2022. 
I thank my colleagues for their lead-
ership and contributions to furthering 
the health of the American people and 
wish to speak in strong support of their 
adoption into H.R. 7666. 
Many of these amendments, Madam 
Speaker, include provisions from bills 
that previously passed the House this 
Congress on suspension that the Senate 
has yet to act upon. 
I am pleased that we have the oppor-
tunity to, once again, emphasize their 
importance by including them in this 
crucial legislative package. 
The amendment offered by Congress-
man 
BERA
and 
Congressman 
FITZPATRICK is just such an amend-
ment. Like the bill it reflects, the 
HERO Act, which passed the House last 
year, it will improve data collection 
and services to ensure our first re-
sponders and public safety officers re-
ceive the mental health care services 
they need. 
Additionally, 
Congresswoman 
NAPOLITANO and Congressman KATKO 
submitted an amendment which ex-
tends and revises SAMHSA’s Project 
AWARE 
program 
providing 
school- 
based mental health services, including 
screening, treatment, and outreach 
programs, 
provisions 
that 
likewise 
passed the House last year in H.R. 721, 
the Mental Health Services for Stu-
dents Act of 2021. 
Representatives KATKO and NAPOLI-
TANO were also joined by Congressmen 
BEYER, 
RASKIN, 
CA´ RDENAS, 
and 
FITZPATRICK in offering an additional 
amendment that includes provisions 
from H.R. 2981, the Suicide Prevention 
Lifeline Improvement Act of 2021, 
which also passed the House last year. 
The amendment extends funding for 
SAMHSA’s Lifeline—crucial in this Na-
tion’s moment of mental health crisis, 
supporting crisis care response and 
support as we prepare for the launch of 
the new 988 dialing code next month. 
I appreciate the additional focus on 
the particular needs of certain commu-
nities in our country that several 
amendments add to the underlying bill. 
I 
thank 
Representatives 
RESCHENTHALER, MORELLE, WILD, and 
DEAN for their amendment requiring a 
study to determine the true cost of un-
treated serious mental illness on fami-
lies, healthcare systems, public hous-
ing, and law enforcement in America. 
In addition, we certainly cannot do 
enough to support the men and women 
who have valiantly served our Nation 
in the Armed Forces. 
I thank Congressman JOYCE for his 
amendment that requires the Depart-
ment of Defense to carry out a 2-year 
pilot program aimed at preventing sui-
cides amongst Active-Duty members of 
the Armed Forces. 
I also appreciate and support the 
amendment submitted by Congressman 
FEENSTRA
requiring the new Behav-
ioral Health Crisis Coordinating Office 
established within SAMHSA by H.R. 
7666, to provide technical assistance 
and support to the Veterans Crisis 
Line. 
Further, Madam Speaker, I support 
the mental health and well-being of 
those who are pregnant or postpartum. 
The amendment offered by Congress-
woman MOORE makes important im-
provements to the Maternal Mental 
Health Hotline authorization to ensure 
those implementing the hotline con-
sult with appropriate State, local, and 
Tribal public officials and those work-
ing with low-income people. 
I am particularly pleased that H.R. 
7666 would establish a new authoriza-
tion for a Maternal Mental Health Hot-
line, and I appreciate Representative 
MOORE’s amendment that will serve to 
improve the underlying legislation. 
Finally, Madam Speaker, while we 
know children in this country are fac-
ing a mental health crisis, unfortu-
nately, we know that all too many also 
experience other chronic health chal-
lenges. 
I 
am 
grateful 
to 
Representative 
PRESSLEY for her amendment requiring 
the Secretary of Health and Human 
Services conduct a study on the rates 
and risks of suicidal behaviors among 
youth with chronic illnesses and to 
provide Congress with recommenda-
tions for ways to provide early inter-
vention, best practices, and strategies 
to address disparities. 
I am pleased to support these amend-
ments and encourage my colleagues to 
do the same. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. I rise in sup-
port of the amendments offered en 
bloc. I rise today to express my strong 
support for this group of amendments. 
Included in this en bloc are important 
bills that have already overwhelmingly 
passed the House, including Represent-
ative KATKO’s Suicide Prevention Life-
line Improvement Act, which reauthor-
izes the National Suicide Prevention 
Lifeline program and ensures resources 
are available for the continued oper-
ation of the hotline, especially with 9– 
8-8 going live next month. 
Representative KATKO
also has in-
cluded in this en bloc the Mental 
Health Services for Students Act, 
which provides an authorization for the 
Substance Abuse and Mental Health 
Services 
Administration’s 
Project 
AWARE grant. 
Project AWARE is a successful pro-
gram which supports partnerships be-
tween the State and local systems in 
increasing awareness of mental health 
issues among school-aged youth; pro-
viding training for school personnel to 
detect and respond to mental health 
issues; and connecting students with 
behavioral health issues and their fam-
ilies to needed services. 
The 
en 
bloc 
also 
includes 
the 
Reschenthaler 
amendment, 
which 
would authorize a study on the cost of 
untreated serious mental illness on 
families, the health system, the justice 
system, and the economy. 
While very treatable, serious mental 
illness remains a neglected health 
issue, and I am hopeful that the data 
gleaned from this study will convince 
policymakers to do more to address 
this condition, including addressing 
the IMD exclusion. 
This group of amendments dem-
onstrates the good work Congress can 
do when both parties come together to 
find meaningful solutions to address 
mental health in America. 
Madam Speaker, I urge adoption, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Massachusetts (Ms. PRESSLEY), 
who has one of the important amend-
ments included in this en bloc. 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of my amendment 
to require the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services to study the suicide 
crises 
among 
children 
living 
with 
chronic illnesses and conditions, in-
cluding autoimmune diseases like alo-
pecia. 
Across this Nation, our children are 
carrying unprecedented amounts of 
trauma and grief in their emotional 
backpacks. 
For an entire generation of young-
sters living with chronic conditions, 
the solitude, grief, and uncertainty of 
the past 2 years have only exacerbated 
the emotional and mental health chal-
lenges that already weighed so heavily. 
Like millions of Americans, I am liv-
ing with the autoimmune disease alo-
pecia. There are several forms of alope-
cia. 
I 
am 
living 
with 
alopecia 
universalis. 
Navigating the world as a bald 
woman is disruptive to many. I am 48 
years old, I am an adult, and I have 
built up some pretty thick skin, but 
there are days that even bring me to 
my knees because of the social stig-
matization, the bullying, the taunting 
that I experience as an adult. 
Although this does not threaten my 
life, that does not mean that it does 
not impact it. I was a caregiver to my 
mother in her cancer battle, and her 
very first concern and worry—even 
though she was fighting for her life— 
was, am I going to lose my hair. 
This is something much more than 
cosmetic for all who are living with

this. Certainly, for women and girls, 
there is an added layer, in that this 
challenge defies societal norms of what 
is feminine, what is pretty, what is ac-
ceptable, and what is appropriate. 
For the millions of children—again, I 
am a 48-year-old adjusted woman, but 
for the millions of children living with 
this disease, the challenges may some-
times feel too much to bear. 
While there are public misconcep-
tions that alopecia areata is purely 
cosmetic, the fact is the National Insti-
tute of Mental Health has found that 
alopecia areata has been linked to 
higher rates of depression, sadness, 
anxiety, and other mental challenges. 
Some have offered: Why not just 
wear a wig? Well, I am working on 
that, too, because many of our children 
can’t afford a medically durable wig. 
So for children who are just beginning 
their journey, growing comfortable in 
their own skin and finding their place 
in the world, these challenges can feel 
even harder. 
Earlier this year, our alopecia com-
munity lost one of our own. She is not 
the first, but one of the most recent: 
Miss Rio Allred. May she rest in peace. 
She was 12 years old, and took her life 
by suicide because of the emotional 
turmoil and relentless bullying she 
faced every day in school due to her al-
opecia. 
I have spoken to Rio’s mother. I have 
heard her express the pain no parent 
should ever know. I asked her to tell 
me about Rio. She was a great big sis-
ter, a writer, a reader, was funny, and 
a light to the world and all around her. 
Her mother has now established Rio’s 
Rainbow, a foundation in her honor, 
and the mission of that, in Rio’s honor, 
is that kids should feel safe being who 
they are. One life lost to the emotional 
distress associated with this disease, 
and any chronic condition for that 
matter, is one too many. 
I make no appeal today for sym-
pathy, but for empathy, for support, to 
be seen. I am not here just to take up 
space. I am here to create it. I choose 
not to wear a wig because I know what 
that representation means to the mil-
lions of Americans that are living with 
alopecia. 
It is long past time that we study the 
troubling suicide crisis among children 
living with chronic illnesses and condi-
tions, including those within our alope-
cia community, and invest in the early 
interventions and best practices nec-
essary to save lives. I urge my col-
leagues to support this amendment, 
which would do just that. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. JOYCE). 
Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in support of my amend-
ment to H.R. 7666 which would add the 
text of the Military Suicide Prevention 
in the 21st Century Act to the under-
lying bill. 
The men and the women of America’s 
Armed Forces dedicate their lives in 
service to this Nation. Unfortunately, 
countless servicemembers are left with 
scars that linger long after they return 
home. 
Rates of serious mental illness expe-
rienced by those in the Armed Forces 
are on the rise, and tragically, so too is 
the number of soldiers who ultimately 
take their lives. 
According to DOD’s most recent re-
port, suicide in the military commu-
nity is at its highest rate since 1938. An 
estimated 7,000 servicemembers have 
died in combat or training exercises 
since 9/11. 
During that same time, over 30,000 
Active-Duty personnel and veterans 
who recently served died by suicide. 
Those numbers should bring pause to 
every Member in this Chamber. More 
importantly, they should spur us into 
action. 
That is why I introduced the Military 
Suicide Prevention in the 21st Century 
Act. This commonsense bill would di-
rect the DOD to utilize modern tech-
nology to prevent suicides in our mili-
tary community. 
In addition to requiring the National 
Suicide Hotline and the Veterans Crisis 
Hotline to be preprogrammed into gov-
ernment-issued smart devices such as 
phones, tablets, and laptops, the bill 
would require the DOD to proactively 
download the Virtual Hope Box app 
onto these devices. 
This app can be set up with the 
photos of friends and family, sound 
bites of loved ones, videos of special 
moments, music, relaxation exercises, 
games, and reminders of reasons for 
living. 
Nothing we do here in Washington 
will ever truly repay the sacrifices 
made by our Nation’s servicemembers, 
but by passing this legislation, we can 
help make a meaningful difference in 
the lives of countless American heroes 
and their families. 
We owe an incredible debt to the men 
and women of our Armed Forces who 
risk their lives fighting for our free-
doms and our security. It is past time 
Congress do more to fight for them 
here at home. 
I urge my colleagues to support my 
amendment so we can make real 
progress toward providing improved 
support for America’s servicemembers 
struggling with their mental health. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
have no additional speakers, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS

percent for awards to States with the high-
est age-adjusted rate of drug overdose death 
based on the ordinal ranking of States ac-
cording to the Director of the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1191, the gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) 
and the gentlewoman from Washington 
(Mrs. RODGERS) each will control 10 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
this en bloc amendment. This package 
includes bipartisan bills and policies 
that will increase access to substance 
use disorder prevention, treatment, 
and recovery support services. 
The amendment introduced by Rep-
resentatives RODNEY DAVIS, BILIRAKIS, 
O’HALLERAN, WAGNER, and KUSTER re-
flects H.R. 2355, the Opioid Prescription 
Verification Act of 2021, which has pre-
viously passed the House. The amend-
ment, like the bill it is drawn from, en-
courages the use of e-prescribing for 
opioids and incentivizes States to 
maintain and utilize prescription drug 
monitoring programs. 
Likewise, the amendment offered by 
Representatives ANDY KIM and DAVIDS 
also reflects a previously House-passed 
bill, H.R. 2364, the Synthetic Opioid 
Danger Awareness Act. Their amend-
ment 
requires 
the 
Department 
of 
Health and Human Services to conduct 
a public education campaign about 
synthetic opioids, including fentanyl 
and its analogues, and disseminate in-
formation about synthetic opioids to 
healthcare providers. 
Continuing the theme of bipartisan-
ship, Representatives MCKINLEY
and 
DINGELL
introduced 
an 
amendment 
that amends the Controlled Substances 
Act to clarify the process for reg-
istrants to exercise due diligence upon 
discovering a suspicious order. Like 
the prior amendments, this, too, is 
drawn from a prior House-passed bill, 
H.R. 768, the Block, Report, And Sus-
pend Suspicious Shipments Act of 2021. 
Further, the amendment offered by 
Representatives 
TRONE, 
ARMSTRONG, 
and SHERRILL also draws from a prior 
House-passed bill extending a critical 
authorization for the State Opioid Re-
sponse grants and Tribal Opioid Re-
sponse grants for 5 years. 
Another amendment introduced by 
Representatives DEAN, SPARTZ, SCAN-
LON, and FITZPATRICK reflects H.R. 5950, 
the Improving Patient Access to Care 
and Treatment Act. This amendment 
increases the time from 14 to 60 days 
that healthcare providers can hold 
long-acting injectable buprenorphine 
before administering it to a patient, 
giving patients and practitioners great-
er flexibility when accessing opioid use 
disorder treatment. 
Finally, this amendment package in-
cludes an amendment offered by Rep-
resentative GOTTHEIMER that would en-
sure that veterans are included within 
the crisis response continuum of best 
practices included in H.R. 7666. 
I thank the sponsors of these provi-
sions. These bipartisan amendments 
provide strong tools to address the on-
going overdose crisis and will save 
lives. I urge my colleagues to support 
this package of amendments and in-
clude them in the overall bill. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
the amendments offered en bloc and 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to ex-
press my strong support for this group 
of amendments addressing substance 
use disorder. 
Included in this en bloc are impor-
tant bills that have already passed 
with overwhelming support, including 
Representative RODNEY DAVIS’ Opioid 
Prescription Verification Act, which 
incentivizes States to use prescription 
drug monitoring programs; requires 
certain controlled substances to be pre-
scribed electronically; and directs Fed-
eral agencies to develop, disseminate, 
and periodically update training mate-
rials to help pharmacists identify and 
report potential cases of bad actors 
who attempt to illegally buy and sell 
controlled substances. 
Also 
included 
is 
Representative 
DAVID MCKINLEY’s Block, Report, And 
Suspend Suspicious Shipments Act, 
which places additional obligations on 
drug manufacturers and distributors to 
identify and stop suspicious orders of 
controlled substances. 
We have seen a devastating increase 
in overdose deaths that I think should 
be called poisonings, teens buying one 
pill via Snapchat and immediately 
overdosing because of a small amount 
of fentanyl in those pills. Just because 
it looks like a pill and someone says it 
was from a pharmacy does not make it 
so. We need to do more to stop both di-
version of legitimate medication and 
counterfeits that are devastating our 
communities. 
These amendments are a good step in 
that direction, and I urge adoption. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. 
MCKINLEY), who has been a longtime 
leader on the issues of substance abuse. 
Mr. MCKINLEY. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of en bloc No. 2, which 
includes an amendment to report, 
track, and take action on suspicious 
orders. 
While the COVID–19 pandemic raged 
through our population and dominated 
the headlines, the opioid epidemic ex-
ploded exponentially, silently claiming 
the lives of tens of thousands of Ameri-
cans every year. Recent CDC data 
shows that the overdose death rate for 
last year was over 103,000 citizens. 
In 2017, the Energy and Commerce 
Committee conducted a comprehensive 
bipartisan investigation into opioid 
dumping in West Virginia. Outrageous 
details came to light, exposing how 
drug shipments in rural West Virginia 
went unconstrained. For example, over 
2 million opioids were sent to a little 
town of 3,000 people. 
Another example: Even after a dis-
tributor found numerous red flags dur-
ing his site visit, nearly 1.5 million 
doses of opioids were still shipped to a 
single pharmacy in Kermit, West Vir-
ginia, with a population of 406. 
The report that was filed by the En-
ergy and Commerce Committee details 
failures on the part of both DEA and 
the distributors to identify and halt 
suspicious 
orders. 
Distributors 
felt 
they didn’t have the authority to halt 
suspicious orders and could have been 
subject to lawsuits. 
As recommended in the report, this 
amendment not only requires the dis-
tributors to report suspicious orders 
but also to investigate the situation 
and decline to fill the order if it is war-
ranted. 
American communities deserve to be 
treated better. This influx of illegal 
drugs must be stopped, and this amend-
ment is a step in the right direction. 
Madam Speaker, I urge Members to 
adopt this amendment. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1191, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendments en bloc offered by the 
gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PAL-
LONE). 
The question is on the amendments 
en bloc. 
The question was taken; and the

Mr. TIFFANY. Madam Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5792 
June 22, 2022 
Director of the Federal Bureau of Investiga-
tion, the Director of the National Institute 
for Justice, and the Assistant Secretary for 
Mental Health and Substance Abuse, shall 
submit to the Committee on Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions and the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary of the Senate and 
the Committee on Energy and Commerce and 
the Committee on the Judiciary of the House 
of Representatives a report on— 
(1) the types, frequency, and severity of 
mental health and stress-related responses of 
law enforcement officers to aggressive ac-
tions or other trauma-inducing incidents 
against law enforcement officers; 
(2) mental health and stress-related re-
sources or programs that are available to 
law enforcement officers at the Federal, 
State, and local level, including peer-to-peer 
programs; 
(3) the extent to which law enforcement of-
ficers use the resources or programs de-
scribed in paragraph (2); 
(4) the availability of, or need for, mental 
health screening within Federal, State, and 
local law enforcement agencies; and 
(5) recommendations for Federal, State, 
and local law enforcement agencies to im-
prove the mental health and wellness of 
their officers. 
(b) DEVELOPMENT.—In developing the re-
port required under subsection (a), the At-
torney General, the Director of the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation, the Director of the 
National Institute of Justice, and the Assist-
ant Secretary for Mental Health and Sub-
stance Abuse shall consult relevant stake-
holders, including— 
(1) Federal, State, Tribal and local law en-
forcement agencies; and 
(2) nongovernmental organizations, inter-
national organizations, academies, or other 
entities. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1191, the gen-
tlewoman from Florida (Mrs. DEMINGS) 
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Florida. 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, the underlying bill 
is a significant step forward in sup-
porting community mental health ef-
forts, which I applaud. 
As a former social worker and former 
law enforcement officer, I have seen 
the devastating impact when commu-
nities fall short of meeting the needs of 
persons struggling with mental health 
and substance addiction. 
Florida is 49th in the Nation on ac-
cess to mental health care. It is not a 
position we are proud of, but many 
States across the Nation have failed to 
adequately address these issues. 
Law enforcement officers, as we all 
know, have a tough and dangerous job, 
and I was proud to co-lead the Law En-
forcement Mental Health and Wellness 
Act, signed into law by President 
Trump, which recognizes that address-
ing mental and psychological health is 
just as important as good physical 
health. 
My amendment is a simple one. It 
will insert reporting requirements on 
available mental health and stress-re-
lated programs for law enforcement of-
ficers and recommend additional tools 
that may be helpful or necessary to 
identify, access, monitor, and improve 
the overall well-being of our law en-
forcement officers. 
I am proud to support this bill, as it 
is critical that we support our commu-
nity 
by 
boldly 
addressing 
mental 
health issues. I am proud to offer this 
amendment that will support the men 
and women in blue who support, pro-
tect, and serve us. 
Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of 
the amendment, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I claim the time in 
opposition, but I urge adoption of the 
amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the gentlewoman is recog-
nized for 5 minutes. 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to urge adoption 
of the Demings amendment, which re-
quires a report on the mental health 
issues experienced by law enforcement 
and the available resources or pro-
grams that are available to law en-
forcement officers to address mental 
health and stress. 
According to the National Alliance 
on Mental Illness, law enforcement of-
ficers report high rates of depression, 
anxiety, and post-traumatic stress dis-
orders, with nearly one in four having 
considered suicide. In fact, more offi-
cers die from suicide than do in the 
line of duty. 
The report will include recommenda-
tions to Federal, State, and local law 
enforcement agencies on how to im-
prove the mental health and well-being 
of our officers. 
It is a necessary first step in helping 
us 
understand 
what 
resources 
are 
available to improve the mental health 
and wellness of law enforcement offi-
cials. Those risking their lives to keep 
America safe deserve passage of this 
amendment. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1191, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendment offered by the gentle-
woman from Florida (Mrs. DEMINGS). 
The question is on the amendment 
offered by the gentlewoman from Flor-
ida (Mrs. DEMINGS). 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1191, the gen-
tlewoman from Washington (Mrs. ROD-
GERS) and a Member opposed each will 
control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Washington. 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
I rise to express my strong support 
for the Ferguson amendment, which 
would incorporate the language of the 
bipartisan, 
House-passed 
Behavioral 
Intervention Guidelines Act to the un-
derlying package. 
This important amendment author-
izes the Substance Abuse and Mental 
Health Services Administration to de-
velop best practices for establishing 
and 
appropriately 
using 
behavioral 
intervention teams in schools. 
Behavioral intervention teams are 
multidisciplinary teams that support 
students’ mental health and wellness 
by identifying students experiencing 
stress, anxiety, or other behavioral dis-
turbances, and conducting intervention 
and outreach to these students to help 
manage risk. 
These teams are already active in 
some educational settings, such as 
Texas Tech and the University of Cali-
fornia, Los Angeles. 
By acting in a proactive manner to 
assist students and connecting them 
with 
needed 
resources, 
behavioral 
intervention teams help schools create 
a safe environment for their students 
and improve mental health outcomes 
in young people. 
It is more important now than ever 
that schools and communities have 
guidance on how to provide behavioral 
health resources and interventions for 
their students to facilitate the early 
intervention and treatment of mental 
health conditions. 
This amendment will help children 
get help before their conditions worsen 
or reach a crisis level. I strongly urge 
a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this amendment, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
claim the time in opposition to the 
amendment, but I do not oppose the 
amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the gentleman from New 
Jersey is recognized for 5 minutes. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
this amendment. Like the bill that 
passed the House last year, H.R. 2877, 
and other House-passed provisions we 
hope to include through amendment 
into the Restoring Hope Act, this bi-
partisan amendment is part of the bi-
partisan approach Ranking Member 
RODGERS and I have taken since day 
one with this critical bill. 
This amendment requires the Sec-
retary to consult with a range of ex-
perts, including mental health and edu-
cation professionals, to develop best 
practices for schools and universities 
to establish behavioral intervention 
teams to identify concerning behaviors 
and manage risks among students. The 
guidance must determine how these 
teams can operate effectively while re-
lying on evidence-based, objective pro-
tection of the constitutional and civil 
rights of students and staff. 
Madam Speaker, I understand that 
some disability and civil rights organi-
zations have concerns about the provi-
sions of this amendment and opposed 
the original bill. I agree that we must 
be sensitive to the concerns of these or-
ganizations and not inadvertently per-
petuate a false association of psy-
chiatric disability and gun violence, 
nor promote the preemptive use of law 
enforcement to address problematic 
student behaviors, particularly among 
students with disabilities and/or stu-
dents of color, who are already dis-
proportionately excessively disciplined 
compared to their peers. 
At the same time, I think there is 
merit to the idea of teams of behav-
ioral health specialists working in con-
cert with educators to identify youth 
and college students who may be at 
risk of harming themselves or others 
and making sure they get the support 
they need. 
This bill has passed the full House 
twice, as I said, on suspension, both 
this Congress and last Congress. My 
understanding is that the bill’s spon-
sors have made changes when reintro-
ducing the bill this Congress to address 
some of the stakeholders’ concerns by 
including more robust privacy protec-
tions and inappropriate referral protec-
tions. I think these changes improve 
the bill. 
I understand the stakeholders would 
like to see additional changes, and as I 
have indicated in the past, I am com-
mitted to examining ways to address 
these concerns and add additional 
guardrails 
as 
the 
bill 
progresses 
through negotiations with our Senate 
counterparts, including this amend-
ment for consideration for adoption 
into H.R. 7666, but we need to pass the 
amendment to allow those kinds of ne-
gotiations with the Senate. 
I look forward to working closely 
with stakeholders, Congressman FER-
GUSON, and the other original leads of 
H.R. 2877, and, of course, our ranking 
member, to strike the right balance 
that protects the health, privacy, and 
rights of all students. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1191, the pre-
vious

the 
amendment offered by the gentle-
woman from Washington (Mrs. ROD-

offered

Washington (Mrs. RODGERS). 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, on

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered.

AMENDMENT NO. 8 OFFERED BY MR. GRIFFITH

printed in part E of House Report 117–

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5794 
June 22, 2022 
I 
appreciate 
the 
opportunity 
to 
present this amendment. This amend-
ment would delay the implementation 
of the MAT Act, section 262, until Jan-
uary of 2024. 
Currently, the Act would eliminate 
the patient cap on the number of pa-
tients a single healthcare provider can 
provide buprenorphine to. This cap was 
created originally in 2000 in the Drug 
Addiction Treatment Act, which ini-
tially set the cap at 30 patients. Since 
2000, the cap has been increased several 
times, and the current law is 275 pa-
tients per healthcare practitioner. 
This patient cap has never been lifted 
before or even studied as to what the 
effects would be if it was lifted. This is 
a complex treatment area. Patients 
don’t just need buprenorphine, or its 
less addictive form known by the trade 
name Suboxone. They need behavioral 
healthcare 
treatment. 
They 
need 
hands-on, detailed guidance. They need 
to do a long, step-down process, slowly 
reducing and then eliminating all of 
the opioids that they are using or have 
used. 
Buprenorphine is also an opioid. It is 
better than heroin or fentanyl, and it 
can be used as a treatment very effec-
tively. But it still can be addictive. 
There are reports of its sale on the 
street. With no cap on the number of 
patients, I fear we could see abuse. 
But if we feel this should be a matter 
for the States to define through their 
medical 
processes, 
their 
medical 
boards, or their legislatures, we need to 
give them time to take that action. 
Most State legislatures are not cur-
rently in session, so the amendment 
gives the States time to take action if 
they choose to do so. 
The overall bill is good, but I don’t 
want us to be inadvertently creating 
more problems down the road related 
to buprenorphine. 
Delaying the implementation of the 
new MAT language until 2024 will allow 
States to analyze what they think is a 
good cap for their population, if they 
choose to do so at all, but they need 
the time in order to make that deci-
sion. 
Accordingly, 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
would ask that we vote ‘‘yes’’ on this 
important amendment, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
claim the time in opposition to the 
amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New Jersey is recognized 
for 5 minutes. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself 2 minutes. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman from Virginia for expressing his 
concerns relating to the MAT Act, but 
I respectfully disagree with his pro-
posal. 
First of all, I take issue with some of 
his 
characterizations 
regarding 
buprenorphine. Buprenorphine is not 
broadly available to all Americans who 
need it. In fact, only 1 in 10 individuals 
with opioid use disorder receive medi-
cations for their condition, including 
buprenorphine. 
Over half of all rural counties in the 
United States do not have a single 
waivered buprenorphine provider, and 
40 percent of all counties in the United 
States don’t have a single waivered 
provider, according to the HHS-OIG. 
This is a huge treatment gap. A 
treatment gap for opioid use disorders 
means lives are lost every day unneces-
sarily when there is treatment avail-
able. This is tragic and not acceptable. 
Second, the gentleman has made the 
argument that buprenorphine is not ef-
fective against fentanyl, but that is 
not accurate. Buprenorphine is proven 
to reduce fentanyl use and overdose 
deaths, 
according 
to 
the 
National 
Academies of Sciences Consensus Re-
port on Medications for Opioid Use Dis-
orders and the United States Commis-
sion on Combating Synthetic Opioid 
Trafficking. 
Delaying the elimination of the X 
waiver to 2024 means extending the 
time in which a barrier to treatment is 
in place, leading to an increased risk of 
overdose and death. 
It is clear that we are experiencing 
record numbers of overdose deaths in 
America. This is a public health emer-
gency and needs to be addressed imme-
diately. 
Buprenorphine is a proven, evidence- 
based treatment for opioid use dis-
order. Buprenorphine prevents painful 
withdrawal symptoms, reduces opioid 
cravings, and cuts the risk of overdose 
in half. This is due to buprenorphine’s 
ceiling effect, which makes it nearly 
impossible to overdose on the medica-
tion. For these reasons, it is considered 
safer than commonly prescribed medi-
cations like insulin and blood thinners. 
Madam Speaker, eliminating the X 
waiver is a cornerstone of the Restor-
ing Hope Act. The MAT Act amend-
ment to this package was adopted at 
markup by a vote of 45–10. It received 
support from the majority of Repub-
licans and Democrats on the com-
mittee. 
Further, nothing in this bill limits 
the ability of States to prepare and act 
on the overdose crisis. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself an additional 30 seconds. 
To the contrary, this legislation em-
powers States to determine the appro-
priate 
training, 
licensing 
require-
ments, and tools for providers who dis-
pense controlled substances and treat 
patients with substance use disorders. 
All the MAT Act does is remove an un-
necessary and outdated Federal barrier 
to States effectively addressing the 
opioid overdose crisis. 
If we don’t act now, we risk tens of 
thousands of additional overdoses and 
unnecessary loss of life. I urge my col-
leagues to reject this amendment, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. FER-
GUSON). 
Mr. FERGUSON. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleague from Virginia for 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, while I do, in fact, 
support his amendment, I would also 
like to speak for just a minute on the 
previous amendment offered to H.R. 
7666, the BIG Act. 
We have seen over the past couple of 
years a significant rise in mental 
health issues with our students, wheth-
er it is in high school, whether it is in 
middle school, or whether it is in col-
lege. We have seen the effects of the 
pandemic, but there are a lot of other 
things that have created this mental 
health crisis for our children around 
America. 
What our children need are resources, 
and they need resources at a very early 
age. So what the BIG Act does is it ac-
cumulates best practices from different 
schools around the country, and it 
makes sure that we intervene with stu-
dents early. We want to get these 
young people the resources that they 
need. 
b 1600 
There are a couple of things about 
this that we think are very important: 
Number one, early intervention has 
been proven to show that we can pre-
vent a catastrophic event. We want 
students to be healthy and happy and 
functioning. What we would also like 
to do is limit the interaction with law 
enforcement. We want to make sure 
that the students are getting these re-
sources across the board. 
So this body passed the BIG Act last 
year, and they did it with wide bipar-
tisan support; however, the Senate did 
not take this bill up. So I say, let’s do 
it again. Let’s pass it as part of this 
important package. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the chair-
man and our ranking members for 
making such an effort to get this im-
portant piece of legislation across the 
finish line. 
Mr. 
GRIFFITH. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
may I inquire how much time is re-
maining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 1 minute remaining. 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
TONKO). 
Mr. TONKO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in strong opposition to the Griffith 
amendment. Not only does this amend-
ment needlessly delay the implementa-
tion of the MAT Act by another year, 
it does so with the intent of encour-
aging States to enact more restrictions 
on buprenorphine in the interim, run-
ning directly contrary to the intent of 
the underlying bill. 
Let’s remember the facts here. We 
are in the middle of an unprecedented 
crisis. Last year alone, 107,000 were 
taken from us too early by drug 
overdoses. One all-too-common theme 
in these deaths is a lack of access to

treatment. Despite being recognized as 
the gold standard of care that can cut 
the risk of overdose in half, only about 
1 in 10 individuals with opioid use dis-
order 
received 
medications 
like 
buprenorphine to treat their addiction. 
That is a glaring systemic failure. 
H.R. 7666 takes a strong step to ad-
dress that failure by expanding access 
to safe and effective addiction treat-
ment through eliminating the outdated 
and 
redundant 
requirement 
that 
healthcare providers obtain a special 
waiver from the DEA to prescribe 
buprenorphine for the treatment of ad-
diction. 
Despite the lifesaving potential this 
legislation can bring, this amendment 
raises concerns about the impact the 
MAT Act will have on safety, abuse, 
and diversion, and I would take a mo-
ment to directly address these con-
cerns. 
Let’s start with the basic facts on 
safety. 
Unlike heroin and fentanyl that are 
causing 
overdose 
deaths, 
buprenorphine is a safe medication 
that is highly effective at protecting 
people from overdose. 
Due 
to 
its 
ceiling 
effect, 
buprenorphine does not cause people to 
feel high and is unlikely to result in 
substance use disorder or be a cause of 
overdose deaths. 
With regard to diversion and abuse, 
the DEA, which is responsible for polic-
ing illicit diversion, has specifically 
looked at this issue and found that the 
primary reason for buprenorphine di-
version is the failure to access legiti-
mate treatment, and that increasing, 
not limiting, buprenorphine treatment 
may be an effective response to diver-
sion. 
Indeed, as buprenorphine access has 
increased over the last 5 years through 
legislation passed by this Congress, 
misuse of the medication has de-
creased. 
So I would say that it is important 
for us to be responsible here. We are in 
the midst of a pandemic, an epidemic 
that is causing great pain, great suf-
fering, great death, every day, every 
week. Every moment we circumvent 
our responsibilities, someone is paying 
the price for that. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly oppose 
this amendment. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Washington (Mrs. RODGERS). 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gen-
tleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
the Griffith amendment which provides 
additional time for implementation of 
the provisions of the Mainstreaming 
Addiction Treatment Act included in 
this bill. 
I supported the inclusion of this lan-
guage at committee, as I believe it will 
help increase access to substance use 
disorder treatment, the underlying lan-
guage. However, enacting this language 
will be a huge policy change from the 
status quo. 
Furthermore, States do regulate the 
practice of medicine, and each State 
has unique, individual regulations and 
procedures regarding the dispensing 
and the prescribing of scheduled nar-
cotics. States could use the additional 
time to update their laws with any 
changes they may want now that Fed-
eral restrictions will be removed. 
This is exactly what Mr. GRIFFITH’s 
amendment does. It sets the implemen-
tation date for removing the X waiver 
requirement to take effective on Janu-
ary 1, 2024. 
Madam Speaker, I support this com-
monsense amendment that will ensure 
that 
the 
Mainstreaming 
Addiction 
Treatment Act gets appropriately im-
plemented. 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude any extraneous material on H.R. 
5585. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in sup-
port of H.R. 5585, the Advance Research 
Projects Agency–Health Act, or ARPA– 
H Act. 
In February, the Energy and Com-
merce 
Committee’s 
Health 
Sub-
committee held a hearing to discuss 
the Biden administration’s proposal to 
establish 
the 
Advance 
Research 
Projects Agency for Health, better 
known as ARPA–H. 
The agency is modeled after the De-
fense 
Advanced 
Research 
Projects 
Agency, or DARPA. The mission of 
ARPA–H is to translate fundamental 
biomedical research into breakthrough 
platform 
technologies 
that 
would 
change healthcare as we know it. 
ARPA–H would focus on the highest- 
risk, highest-reward issues in disease 
research. It will attempt to solve the 
problems that the private and public 
sectors have not been able to conquer. 
The expectations we have for this agen-
cy are justifiably high. 
Our hope is that within 5 years of op-
erations, ARPA–H will have led to the 
development 
of 
cutting-edge 
treat-
ments and cures for cancer, diabetes, 
autoimmune 
disorders, 
and 
mental 
health conditions. 
In order to be truly successful, we 
must ensure that all Americans have 
access to these innovations. Equity and 
promoting the health of all Americans 
must also be part of ARPA–H’s mis-
sion. 
The fiscal year 2022 omnibus appro-
priations law provided the Department 
of Health and Human Services with $1 
billion to get ARPA–H off the ground. 
We must now provide the necessary 
and appropriate authorities to make 
ARPA–H successful, to clarify its mis-
sion and its organizational structure,

and ensure that the work at ARPA–H is 
not duplicative or redundant. H.R. 5585 
does just that. 
ARPA–H will be led by a director and 
cadre of program managers with the 
autonomy and authority to develop 
high-risk, high-reward portfolios. This 
will be coupled with the appropriate 
contracting, hiring, and procurement 
authorities that will pull from the best 
minds and resources in the biomedical 
research ecosystem. 
This legislation authorizes $500 mil-
lion annually for 5 fiscal years. ARPA– 
H projects will be time- and milestone- 
limited, ensuring that each project de-
livers real and measurable results. The 
ARPA–H Act includes reporting re-
quirements to ensure proper compli-
ance and avoid the redundancy. The di-
rector will be required to submit re-
ports on the actions, results, and forth-
coming strategic plans of ARPA–H to 
Congress so that we can confirm that 
the agency is meeting our intent. 
So last month, the Committee on En-
ergy and Commerce advanced H.R. 5585 
by an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 
55–3. This was a tremendous achieve-
ment and demonstrates Congress’ abil-
ity to come together and find solutions 
that will improve the health of all 
Americans. 
I thank Health Subcommittee Chair-
woman ESHOO, who is the author of 
this legislation, along with Health Sub-
committee Ranking Member GUTHRIE, 
our full committee Ranking Member 
RODGERS, 
and 
also 
Representatives 
DeGette and Upton for their work on 
this important bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 5585, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in sup-
port of the Advanced Research Projects 
Agency-Health Act, or ARPA–H Act. I 
know this has been an important pri-
ority for researchers, industry, and, 
most importantly, patients who are 
waiting for life-changing medical tech-
nology to improve or even save their 
lives. 
This legislation will authorize the es-
tablishment of ARPA–H within the 
U.S. Department of Health and Human 
Services. The agency will specifically 
be charged with helping to foster high- 
risk, high-reward treatments and cures 
for diseases with clinically unmet 
needs. 
Some of my colleagues may be con-
cerned about a new agency, and that is 
where a number of Republicans on the 
Committee on Energy and Commerce 
were early in October when this legis-
lation was introduced. 
ARPA–H was funded at $1 billion in 
the previous appropriations bill in 2021. 
To ensure that funding was used for the 
best possible result, the Committee on 
Energy and Commerce for the past sev-
eral months has worked hard to ensure 
that ARPA–H has a clear mission. As a 
result, it passed out of committee with 
a strong 55-to-3 vote. 
b 1615 
We most notably ensure this newly 
created agency remains separate from 
the NIH. We limit administration costs 
associated with setting up ARPA–H to 
maximize research investments, which 
would require a strategic plan and 
transparent reporting on projects; de-
fine the number of offices; and require 
that the majority of offices within the 
organization be exclusively devoted to 
biomedical research and development. 
In order to ensure this agency is fos-
tering the development of innovative, 
transformative 
health 
technologies 
that are not being met by Federal pro-
grams or private industry, the tech-
nologies the agency should pursue are 
very explicitly defined in the legisla-
tion before us today. 
The legislation puts guardrails in 
place to ensure that priority access is 
granted to U.S. researchers over re-
searchers abroad. There are additional 
requirements 
for 
international 
re-
searchers to work in collaboration with 
a U.S. counterpart if they receive 
ARPA–H funding. 
Importantly, the bill makes clear 
that funding is prohibited from going 
to nondomestic recipients of a malign 
foreign country, most notably Chinese 
research labs or Russian research labs. 
This is a significant step to ensure the 
United States’ intellectual property 
isn’t being stolen by our adversaries 
and to ensure we remain the world 
leader in biomedical research and inno-
vation. 
As the Republican leader on the 
Health Subcommittee, I am leading ef-
forts to strengthen oversight of NIH- 
funded research. It is unacceptable 
that some Federal grants have been 
supporting foreign researchers with 
ties to governments of adversarial na-
tions like China. We must prevent this 
from happening moving forward. 
Mr. Speaker, I emphasize the need to 
pass this bill. The funding has already 
been appropriated in a previous year. If 
we don’t pass this bill and don’t au-
thorize this agency to move forward, 
then this will erode our oversight role 
in Congress. Funding decisions made 
by ARPA–H must require diligence to 
ensure that resources are being spent 
as appropriately and as effectively as 
possible. 
The Biden administration ARPA–H 
organizational chart, without this bill, 
has 14 offices, less than half of which 
are actually dedicated to research. 
This gives us insight into how the 
Biden administration would manage 
this new agency without congressional 
guidance. It is just appropriate that 
the legislative branch sets up the way 
this money is being spent. 
That is what the bill before us today 
does. It puts ARPA–H on the right 
track, gives Congress the opportunity 
to set high standards, and promotes 
greater biomedical research and inno-
vation for patients. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the majority 
for working together. I thank our staff 
for the excellent work they have done. 
I encourage the passage of this because 
if we don’t pass it, the money is still 
going to be spent but without congres-
sional guardrails. 
Mr. Speaker, I support this bill, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. ESHOO), the Health Sub-
committee chair and the author of this 
legislation. 
Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
chairman of the full committee for his 
full support of this legislation from the 
very beginning. 
Mr. Speaker, this has been somewhat 
of a long journey. It began in March of 
last year, 2021, when a group of Mem-
bers, bipartisan and bicameral, were in-
vited to the White House to meet with 
President Biden. When we gathered 
there, he spoke about his vision for cre-
ating ARPA–H, an advanced research 
project for health. 
It is modeled after DARPA, the high-
ly innovative and successful small 
agency that was created many years 
ago. I think one of its chief assets is its 
autonomy, and its successes are ex-
traordinary because of the way it is 
shaped. They have produced the inter-
net, GPS navigation, and Moderna’s 
mRNA vaccines. 
This bill is shaped to maximize the 
promise of ARPA–H. 
All of us have a relative or someone 
in our family, extended family, and our 
communities that when receiving a di-
agnosis, it is a death sentence. That is 
what the mission of ARPA–H is di-
rected to address. I have full con-
fidence that, the way this legislation is 
shaped, it can meet that challenge. 
It will be a place where highly inno-
vative ideas are tested, and if the ap-
proaches fail because these are high- 
risk undertakings, then the agency will 
quickly move on to new ones and redi-
rect the money. It will be flat and 
small like DARPA, but it has a mighty 
mission. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank all the members 
of the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee on the majority and the minor-
ity side. We have really worked hard 
together on this to shape something 
that is worthy of the American people 
and has the ability to produce. From 
the chairman of the full committee to 
the ranking member, Mrs. McMorris 
Rodgers, to the ranking member of the 
subcommittee, Mr. GUTHRIE, ideas kept 
coming forward. We polished them, 
added them to the legislation, and, in 
some instances, dropped other parts of 
the draft. 
Mr. Speaker, I acknowledge the work 
of my staffer, Aisling McDonough, who 
has given her all on this; the staff of 
the committee; the scientists, because 
well over 100 of them leaned in and 
gave us their ideas and advice on how 
best to create a small agency that 
would be nimble but highly effective; 
and the patient advocates. So many of 
them have cheered us on and given us 
their best input, as well. 
Today is the day. The House is 
poised. I urge all of my colleagues to

June 22, 2022 
support this because when this mission 
is executed, I think even if one deadly 
disease is addressed and cured, we will 
have succeeded. I think we are going to 
do better than that. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Washington (Mrs. RODGERS), who is the 
Republican leader of the full com-
mittee. 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. 
Speaker, America is the envy of the 
world for our leadership in biomedical 
innovation. People from all over the 
world have an incredible amount of 
hope in the promise of our lifesaving, 
breakthrough research for more cures 
and treatments. 
That is why I have been a longtime 
supporter of NIH and projects like the 
BRAIN Initiative intended to speed sci-
entific research necessary to accelerate 
cures for neurologic diseases. 
When the concept of ARPA–H was 
first proposed to me, I expressed a 
healthy dose of skepticism. 
First, I was concerned about a clear 
and targeted strategic mission. I was 
concerned an unfocused agenda would 
not be a recipe for success. 
The second was the issue of duplica-
tion. The Federal Government has sev-
eral agencies that advance biomedical 
innovation. Within the National Insti-
tutes of Health alone, we already have 
the National Center for Advancing 
Translational Science, the Cures Accel-
eration Network, the Common Fund, 
and the Foundation for NIH’s Accel-
erating Medicines Partnership Pro-
gram, to name a few. 
Third, I was concerned that the cre-
ation of a new agency would lack suffi-
cient transparency and oversight. My 
questions to supporters of ARPA–H in-
cluded: 
How will projects be selected? 
How will the public be kept informed 
of projects and project funding? 
Who will be assessing for duplication 
of Federal programs, and how will it be 
managed? 
What measure will be used to define 
success? 
What are the guardrails to ensure 
that 
we 
are 
supporting 
American 
innovators? 
These concerns were validated earlier 
this year when the administration 
began implementing the $1 billion that 
was appropriated to set up ARPA–H 
with little to no congressional direc-
tion. The Biden administration pro-
posed 
14 
offices 
within 
ARPA–H. 
DARPA has six to eight. They also 
placed ARPA–H within NIH, which has 
its own issues in lacking transparency 
and accountability related to federally 
funded research and the origins of 
COVID–19. 
We needed to ensure proper oversight 
and provide guardrails through con-
gressional direction, so we plowed the 
hard ground necessary to legislate 
through the Energy and Commerce 
Committee. Chairman FRANK PALLONE 
and Health Subcommittee Chairwoman 
ANNA ESHOO listened to my concerns. 
We had very productive negotiations to 
properly define ARPA–H’s mission and 
place 
strong 
safeguards 
for 
trans-
parency and accountability. 
This bill defines ARPA–H’s mission 
so that it is laser-focused on high-risk 
breakthrough technologies in health 
and medicine that are not being ad-
dressed by the private sector or current 
Federal programs. 
This bill also prohibits Federal fund-
ing to China, Russia, and other recipi-
ents subject to malign foreign influ-
ence. 
It moves the agency back outside of 
NIH. 
We are also making sure ARPA–H 
sets the right priorities. The director 
must provide Congress with a strategic 
plan within 1 year of enactment and 
every 3 years on how ARPA–H will 
carry out projects. Projects will be 
evaluated every 18 months, and those 
not meeting milestones are expected to 
be terminated. 
We placed guardrails on ARPA–H to 
prioritize projects that provide the 
greatest return on investment to im-
prove 
human 
health 
and 
lower 
healthcare costs. 
This bill also keeps the focus on life-
saving research. The director will have 
the power to hire and make appoint-
ments based on merit and expertise, 
not based on provisions that reward 
government bureaucrats. 
We require those who receive ARPA– 
H funding to provide a public itemized 
report on indirect facilities and admin-
istrative costs. 
To further cut down on duplication 
and mission creep, we limited the num-
ber of offices to 6, not the 14 proposed 
by the administration. Of those offices, 
at least four must be exclusively fo-
cused on R&D. In addition, not more 
than 15 percent of the total agency 
funding is allowed to go to administra-
tive costs. 
Mr. Speaker, I will close by thanking 
my colleagues for working together on 
this. I especially recognize the leader-
ship of Chairman PALLONE, Health Sub-
committee Chairwoman ESHOO, Health 
Subcommittee 
Republican 
leader 
BRETT GUTHRIE, as well as the 21st Cen-
tury Cures leaders FRED UPTON and 
DIANA DEGETTE. 
I am pleased we were able to come to-
gether. We put ARPA–H on the right 
path with a targeted mission, increased 
accountability and transparency, and a 
laser focus on promoting American 
innovators. It is a strong example of 
E&C’s bipartisan record of success in 
moving legislation that will continue 
America’s global leadership in bio-
medical research. 
Mr. Speaker, before I close, I want to 
applaud and thank the members of my 
team: 
Grace 
Graham, 
Kristen 
Shatynski, Seth Gold, Kristin Flukey, 
and Kristin Ashford. 
They say that Energy and Commerce 
has the best staff on the Hill, and that 
is certainly evident through their serv-
ice to deliver hope and healing, both 
through this bill and through the pack-
age just before us with the mental 
health package. At every step of the 
way, I am grateful for their hard work 
and passion. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on 
H.R. 
5585, 
the 
Advanced 
Research 
Projects Agency-Health Act. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Col-
orado (Ms. DEGETTE), the chair of our 
Energy and Commerce Oversight and 
Investigations Subcommittee who has 
also worked on ARPA–H in the very be-
ginning. 
Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I am so 
honored to stand here today in support 
of this legislation, which will revolu-
tionize how our Nation researches and 
develops new cures and treatments for 
some of the world’s most difficult dis-
eases. 
There is not a person in this room or 
in this Capitol who hasn’t been im-
pacted in some way by a devastating 
disease—cancer, Alzheimer’s, or some-
thing else. These diseases don’t care if 
you are a Democrat or a Republican. 
They affect all of us. It needs to be our 
collective mission to cure all of them 
immediately. 
The ripple effect that they have on 
our communities is immeasurable. The 
pain and suffering that they cause, not 
just to those who become ill but to 
their families, friends, and loved ones, 
is irreparable. They place significant 
strain on our public health systems 
and significant strain on our economy. 
For years, scientists and researchers, 
both here in the U.S. and around the 
world, have been searching for ways to 
prevent and treat these devastating ill-
nesses. 
b 1630 
I see my friend and colleague FRED 
UPTON here on the floor with us today. 
Fred and I worked on the 21st Century 
Cures bill in 2016 which has revolution-
ized the way we do a lot of this dis-
covery and development. But what we 
need more of now is an all-hands-on- 
deck approach to end these illnesses, 
and that is exactly why this legislation 
was developed. 
As Ms. ESHOO, Mr. PALLONE, and oth-
ers said, it will create a new Advanced 
Research Projects Agency for Health, 
ARPA–H, which will bring together 
some of the world’s greatest minds and 
give them access to the Federal Gov-
ernment’s 
seemingly 
unlimited 
re-
sources to make the impossible pos-
sible. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
modeled 
after 
the 
DARPA program, as you heard, the 
new agency will be lean and it will be 
mean. It will be targeted at specifically 
researching and finding cures for some 
of the most intractable diseases that 
we have. 
It is going to be run by a small num-
ber of program managers, and it will be 
able to take on the high-risk, high-re-
ward projects that others simply can-
not. It will not substitute for the basic 
research at the NIH or the research at 
our great universities or in private

business. It will supplement it by tar-
geting these tough issues, and it will 
reshape the future of biomedical re-
search in this country for many, many 
years to come. 
As I said, this legislation is an oppor-
tunity. It is an opportunity to put our 
country on track to ending cancer as 
we know it. It is an opportunity to save 
millions of lives. If we cure cancer, and 
if we save lives and improve the health 
and well-being of our constituents, 
isn’t that what we came here for? 
Mr. Speaker, I urge everyone to vote 
‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, as the 
chair of this committee, Mr. UPTON 
made his signature issue the 21st Cen-
tury Cures, and not just passing that 
which has changed people’s lives al-
ready but being able to work with Ms. 
DEGETTE and all the others to say that 
this is something we all need to work 
on together in a bipartisan way and 
make a big difference. 
Now as chair emeritus, this is, I 
think, his signature piece. He may 
have other pieces of legislation, too, 
but this is the one that I have worked 
on with him in the very beginning in 
the Oval Office with the President. We 
worked together to say: Can we do 
something big that is really going to 
change the lives of people in this coun-
try? 
He has done it. He has done it his en-
tire career. He is a mentor of mine, 
and, unfortunately, at the end of this 
year he is going to do something dif-
ferent than being here in Congress. He 
will be missed for his voice and being a 
champion of this issue. 
Mr. Speaker, I am going to yield to 
him so that he can speak on this bill 
for himself. The gentleman certainly 
has left a legacy here with the previous 
legislation and this piece of legislation. 
So let’s work together to move it for-
ward. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from Michigan (Mr. UPTON). 
Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
very good friend, and I certainly appre-
ciate his kind words. The good news is 
I am not done yet. We have a lot of 
work to do, and this is yet one more 
piece that we are going to be driving 
forward. But, certainly, I rise in sup-
port of this legislation, the ARPA–H 
authorization bill. 
While I have been a longtime sup-
porter of many different versions of 
this bill, I thank, in particular, Chair-
man PALLONE, my Republican Leader 
RODGERS, certainly ANNA ESHOO—who 
is my good friend—and BRETT GUTHRIE 
for their leadership on working to-
gether on language with the goal of 
really making this issue bipartisan and 
one that is going to work. 
I am glad that we came together to 
add even more important guardrails to 
ensure that this bill, ARPA–H, works 
as it was intended as well as, hopefully, 
have a very strong bipartisan vote a 
little bit later this afternoon. 
This bill is going to establish an enti-
ty not unlike the Defense Advanced 
Research Projects entity—that was our 
goal—DARPA. It is going to be game- 
changing, 
health 
research. 
Like 
DARPA, this entity is going to be fo-
cused on producing research on things 
that, frankly, may be too risky for the 
private sector. It is going to move at a 
faster pace than the current structure. 
There may be a high failure rate, but 
its successes are going to have the po-
tential 
to 
be 
absolutely 
groundbreaking, answering the prayers 
of millions. 
It really is a follow-up to what we did 
in this body with the 21st Century 
Cures with the UPTON and DEGETTE ef-
fort that passed our committee 53–0, 
then passed here on the House floor 
392–26. 
There has been a lot of debate on 
where ARPA–H is going to be housed. 
Should it be in NIH? 
Should it be in HHS or someplace 
else? 
Wherever this entity is finally lo-
cated, we need to make sure that it is 
lean, that it is independent and nimble, 
and that there are the appropriate 
guardrails to keep other agencies from 
mission creep and siphoning that fund-
ing. The legislation that was intro-
duced did a very good job of that and I 
am pleased to see that these protec-
tions were strengthened in the final 
product that we are going to be voting 
on this afternoon. 
My partner in 21st Century Cures, 
DIANA DEGETTE, and really everybody 
on our committee were happy to in-
clude language for ARPA–H in our 
Cures 2.0 bill that we introduced more 
than a year ago. We thought that it 
was a great follow-up to the work that 
we did to enhance basic research on the 
first Cures bill which added $45 bil-
lion—paid for—in additional health re-
search. 
Funding for the NIH and the FDA in-
cluded many important things such as 
the Cancer Moonshot and the Brain 
Initiative. 
We are still in a pandemic. We have 
awful diseases that need cures, whether 
it be cancer, Alzheimer’s, lupus, or dia-
betes that strike literally every single 
family. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
the gentleman from Michigan an addi-
tional 1 minute. 
Mr. UPTON. This bill, ARPA–H, can 
provide the breakthroughs necessary to 
find cures for those diseases. The Presi-
dent has already signed $1 billion for 
this program into law. So what we need 
now is bipartisan authorization to 
complete the work. This bill certainly 
accomplishes that goal. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues, like we did before, to vote for 
this bill a little bit later this after-
noon. Again, I just want to commend 
our great staff. As our leader, Con-
gresswoman RODGERS, said: We have 
the best staff there is. 
Is there any objection to that? 
Hearing 
none—sorry, 
Ways 
and 
Means; sorry appropriators. 
We do. We are the Energy and Com-
merce Committee, and we are going to 
find a cure for these diseases. This bill 
is a step in that direction. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I must 
say that for many years we had a Con-
gressman Brown on the committee who 
contributed 
a 
lot, 
particularly 
on 
healthcare 
issues. 
He 
chaired 
the 
Health Subcommittee. So it is an 
honor to hear from Ms. BROWN of Ohio. 
We 
have 
another 
Congresswoman 
BROWN from Ohio. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. BROWN). 
Ms. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank Chairman PALLONE for yielding, 
and I thank Congresswoman ESHOO for 
her leadership on this bill. 
I applaud President Biden for having 
the foresight to propose the creation of 
an Advanced Research Projects Agency 
for Health, also known as ARPA–H, an 
agency tasked with driving break-
throughs 
in 
cancer, 
diabetes, 
Alz-
heimer’s, and other difficult diseases. 
The new science moonshot agency is 
modeled on the successes of the De-
fense 
Advanced 
Research 
Projects 
Agency, also known as DARPA. For 
decades DARPA has driven advances in 
technologies that have changed our 
lives for the better. Yet, there are so 
many things that we take for granted, 
things like the internet and flat-screen 
displays. I am confident the same will 
be true for ARPA–H as it seeks to ac-
celerate advancements in health and 
medicine. Thanks to President Biden’s 
leadership, my colleagues in Congress 
funded ARPA–H in March for the cur-
rent fiscal year. 
Yet in order to successfully carry out 
its mission, ARPA–H needs long-term 
resources and authorities. That is ex-
actly what this bill does. The ARPA–H 
legislation would authorize the agency 
for 5 years and create the structure it 
needs to successfully drive break-
throughs that would otherwise die in 
the commercial market. 
Yet ARPA–H not only needs long- 
term funding but also a long-term 
home. ARPA–H’s mission is centered 
around 
high-risk, 
high-reward 
re-
search, which is a charge that Cleve-
land has historically proven it is pre-
pared 
to 
lead. 
With 
world-class 
healthcare systems, top-tier institu-
tions of higher education, advanced 
biomedical companies, and a highly 
skilled 
manufacturing 
workforce, 
Cleveland has a long track record of 
bringing cutting-edge innovations from 
discovery all the way to production. 
This includes groundbreaking medical 
advancements like the first face trans-
plant in America as well as the region’s 
cutting-edge cancer research. 
Now, wherever the agency lands, it 
will have a meaningful impact on the 
lives of Americans nationwide for gen-
erations to come. Creating ARPA–H 
with 1 year of funding was a good first 
step, but it is time to put this new 
breakthrough agency on firm footing

and in a firm location so we can truly 
start to revolutionize how we prevent, 
treat, and cure a range of diseases. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman PAL-
LONE again for his leadership, and I 
urge my colleagues to support the bill. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts (Mr. AUCHINCLOSS), who is also 
very 
much 
involved 
in 
healthcare 
issues with regard to the pharma-
ceutical industry and so many other 
health issues. 
Mr. AUCHINCLOSS. Mr. Speaker, I 
strongly support Chairwoman ESHOO’s 
bill to create an Advanced Research 
Projects Agency. This bill will ensure 
that ARPA–H can address the limita-
tions of commercial markets and tack-
le high-risk, high-reward biomedical 
research in oncology, neuroscience, di-
abetes, artificial intelligence, mRNA 
and RNA, cell and gene therapy, and so 
much more. 
As the global epicenter of break-
through science, Massachusetts is a top 
candidate to host the headquarters of 
ARPA–H. Not only are we home to the 
highest proportion of top-ranked re-
search universities in the world, but we 
also have the best and brightest in in-
dustry, healthcare, and academia. 
We have also invested in infrastruc-
ture to support the needs of ARPA–H. 
Over the past decade, we have delivered 
21.6 million square feet of lab space, in 
addition to over 100 incubators, accel-
erators, and co-working spaces. 
This bill specifically directs ARPA–H 
to advance early disease detection, 
translational 
research, 
and 
health 
technologies. 
It 
realizes 
President 
Biden’s goal of driving breakthroughs 
in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and 
infectious disease. From pre-competi-
tive Alzheimer’s research at the Massa-
chusetts General Hospital to Vertex’s 
work to utilize stem cell therapies to 
treat diabetes, we are aligned with and 
deeply committed to ARPA–H’s goal in 
the Commonwealth. 
I am proud to represent a State that 
is deeply invested in the success of 
ARPA–H. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, it is important we are 
here today. 
I thank the chair of the other sub-
committee whom I have the privilege 
to work alongside as the Republican 
leader. She has been a champion of 
ARPA–H as it first came out and at the 
first meeting at the White House. We 
have discussed quite a bit about where 
it should be and what the guardrails 
should be. 
I know the funding got out in front of 
it. We all really wanted Congress to 
have a say in how this agency operated 
and not the executive branch the way, 
unfortunately, getting in front of au-
thorization does. 
I appreciate the hard work. I appre-
ciate the work of the colleagues who 
have spoken and everybody else who is 
working on this together on our staff. 
Mr. Speaker, I think it is important 
that we pass this bill. I urge my col-
leagues to vote for the bill tonight, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time to close. 
Mr. Speaker, I just want to say in 
closing that I think you can feel the 
real enthusiasm and the hope that is 
involved with both the sponsors of this 
bill and those who spoke on both sides 
of the aisle. 
We consider ourselves, the Energy 
and Commerce Committee, the innova-
tion committee, and I think this is a 
prime example of the type of innova-
tion that we see for the future and the 
hope in ARPA–H. 
Mr. Speaker, I would ask for every-
one on a bipartisan basis to vote for 
this, so we have a strong vote, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 
5585, the Advanced Research Projects Agen-
cy—Health Act. During my time in Congress, 
I have been a strong supporter of basic med-
ical research, and I recognize the potential 
translational medical research holds when it 
builds off this prior research. The discoveries 
made by our scientists at NIH and at NIH- 
funded universities across the nation have the 
potential to transform the delivery of health 
care and the prevention, treatment, and ulti-
mately curing of disease. 
That support for research and its potential to 
transform the delivery of health care led me to 
be an initial supporter of ARPA–H. In collabo-
ration with my colleagues on the Appropria-
tions Committee, we provided ARPA–H with 
some initial funding in the Fiscal Year 2022 
omnibus. 
However, we are appropriators, not author-
izers, and many of the basic decisions about 
the structure and functions of the agency had 
to be left unmade and instead be delegated to 
the Secretary of Health and Human Services. 
As I mentioned to him when he came before 
my subcommittee this spring, Congress still 
did not know how grants would be made or 
funded or how ARPA–H would interface with 
NIH. 
I am pleased that this bill from the House 
Energy and Commerce Committee answers 
these questions and provides Congress the 
opportunity to shape this agency in line with 
our original intent. I am especially pleased that 
the resulting bill is fiscally responsible and will 
ensure proper oversight of ARPA–H as it im-
plements this new research arm. H.R. 5585 
establishes ARPA–H as an independent agen-
cy within HHS—separate from NIH—and pro-
vides its director with independence from NIH. 
It also establishes clear agency goals and 
mission and provides a framework for coordi-
nation to ensure ARPA–H’s efforts will not du-
plicate or cannibalize the research efforts of 
other federal agencies, particularly NIH. Impor-
tantly, it also prohibits awards being made to 
foreign researchers and entities operating at 
behest of or in concert with our adversaries. 
I urge my colleagues to support this legisla-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate on the bill has expired.

the bill. I thank my Republican col-
leagues on the Health Subcommittee, 
including Ranking Member MCMORRIS 
RODGERS, Ranking Member GUTHRIE, 
and Dr. BURGESS for working closely 
with me on this bill over the last sev-
eral weeks. 
This manager’s amendment makes 
sure that the structure of ARPA–H will 
help the Agency achieve success. Spe-
cifically, 
the 
amendment 
requires: 
First, two-thirds of the ARPA–H pro-
gram offices be exclusively dedicated 
to research and development; number 
two, not more than 15 percent of the 
ARPA–H budget to be used on adminis-
trative expenses; and, thirdly, removes 
the requirement of Senate confirma-
tion of the ARPA–H director. 
I think these are commonsense provi-
sions that improve the bill and, ulti-
mately, strengthen ARPA–H and its 
mission; and it is why I urge my col-
leagues to support this amendment. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I claim 
the time in opposition, even though I 
am not opposed to the bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the gentleman from Ken-
tucky is recognized for 5 minutes. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, the 
Chair of the subcommittee kind of 
went through what the amendment 
says. Another thing that we need to 
make sure is reinforced is that the 
amendment would ensure that agency 
and precious U.S. taxpayer dollars can 
never go to nondomestic recipients or-
ganized under the laws of a covered for-
eign entity as defined by the National 
Security Act of 1947. This includes 
China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea. 
So I want to make sure we understand 
that. 
I said this on the debate on the bill 
that the Chair and I were talking back 
and forth. And I understood the mis-
sion of what we wanted to accomplish 
with ARPA–H, but I was concerned 
about the application of it and how it 
would actually be put into place. We 
had a lot of discussions based on that. 
This amendment really does define as 
best as we can define in legislation, 
without vague terms, what we want 
ARPA–H to do. This amendment en-
sures that 85 percent of the money goes 
to research and not to administration 
and growing an agency. We think that 
this really does narrow and, as we said 
earlier, put guardrails. This amend-
ment is what accomplishes that with 
the bill. I am for this amendment, and 
I encourage its adoption. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the previous question 
is ordered on the bill and the amend-
ment offered by the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. ESHOO). 
The question is on the amendment

ized to correct section numbers, punc-
tuation, spelling, and cross-references

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms.

Committee on the Budget: 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, June 22, 2022. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI: I write to respect-
fully tender my resignation as a member of 
the House Committee on the Budget. It has 
been an honor to serve in this capacity, and 
I fully endorse Congressman Blake Moore of 
Utah for this position.

PASSAGE 
OF 
THE 
RESTORING 
HOPE FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND 
WELL-BEING ACT 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to applaud the passage of the Re-
storing Hope for Mental Health and 
Well-Being Act. 
Millions of Americans live with a 
very serious mental health or sub-
stance abuse disorder. We must recog-
nize their plight as part and parcel of 
providing overall health. 
When we ignore the signs and symp-
toms of mental and substance abuse 
disorders, we are unable to attain the 
help that is available for millions, but 
help is available. 
Now, thanks to this legislation, we 
will ensure more people have access to 
quality, 
affordable 
behavioral 
healthcare. 
By increasing resources for proper di-
agnosis and recovery services, tele-
health, mental health screenings, sui-
cide prevention, we will improve lives 
and save lives all across our country. 
Let us continue working to provide 
the care that is essential to daily life. 
Help is within reach. Let us make sure 
that those who need medical diagnoses 
on the behavioral front receive it. Fi-
nally. Finally. 
As a member of the Mental Health 
Caucus and the Bipartisan Addiction 
and Mental Health Task Force, I thank 
the Committee on Energy and Com-
merce for their steadfast work to as-
sure wellness for millions of Ameri-
cans. 
f 
CONGRATULATING EAGLE SCOUT 
ANDREW RUGH 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to recog-
nize the accomplishments of Mr. An-
drew Rugh, an Eagle Scout from Troop 
28 in Rocky Grove, Venango County, as 
he celebrates completing all 138 merit 
badges offered by the Boy Scouts of 
America. 
Andrew has been a member of Troop 
28 for more than 7 years and has had 
the support of his parents, Chad and 
Christina Rugh, throughout his time in 
Scouting. 
Becoming an Eagle Scout is a great 
honor. Only 8 percent of all Scouts at-
tain the rank of Eagle Scout, and less 
than half a percent of Scouts are esti-
mated to have completed all available 
merit badges. 
On his path to earning each merit 
badge, Andrew was challenged to learn 
various skills ranging from law and 
chess to archery and welding.

June 22, 2022 
Alongside millions of young men and 
women in Scouting, Andrew embodies 
the values of patriotism, courage and 
self-reliance. 
Madam Speaker, as an Eagle Scout 
myself, and a member of the Scouting 
community for more than 50 years, I 
can attest to the significance of An-
drew’s achievement. 
Congratulations, Andrew, on your ac-
complishment in Scouting and your 
contribution to your community. Well 
done, Scout.

TODAY WE TOOK ACTION 
(Mr. TRONE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. TRONE. Madam Speaker, today, 
I rise to applaud the passage of Restor-
ing Hope for Mental Health and Well- 
Being Act of 2022, a comprehensive 
package of over 30 bills, 6 of which I 
proudly led. 
Today, over 50 million Americans 
struggle with mental illness, and over 
20 million Americans struggle with 
substance use disorder. We have lost 
nearly 1 million lives to suicide and 
over 1 million Americans to drug 
overdoses in the last 20 years. 
Today, we are on course to lose an-
other 1.2 million Americans in the next 
decade to drug overdoses. We cannot 
afford to wait until tomorrow, so 
today, we took action. This effort 
served as a first step of a continued 
journey to end these crises that have 
taken far too long and taken too many. 
We proudly cast our vote to help save 
the lives of our fellow Americans. I 
thank 
Chairman 
FRANK
PALLONE, 
Ranking Member McMorris Rodgers, 
Leader HOYER, and their teams for 
making this vision a reality. 
f 
ATTACKS ON PRO-LIFE 
ORGANIZATIONS 
(Mr. ROSE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, more 
than 7 weeks ago, we woke up to head-
lines that the Supreme Court of the 
United States would likely overturn 
Roe v. Wade. I believe the leaker broke 
Federal law in an effort to change the 
outcome of the High Court’s ruling. 
We have seen protests outside Jus-
tices’ homes. In Associate Justice 
Brett Kavanaugh’s case, we have seen 
an assassination plot. We have also 
seen more than a dozen attacks on pro- 
life organizations across the country, 
including vandalism, destruction of 
property, and even firebombing. 
This is why I joined more than 100 
House Republicans in a letter urging 
the Department of Justice to inves-
tigate these attacks. They not only de-
serve to be a top priority for the DOJ, 
but we believe they should be inves-
tigated as instances of domestic ter-
rorism. 
We must make it clear that we are a 
Nation of laws, never mob rule. 
f 
PUTTING HIGHER EDUCATION 
WITHIN REACH 
(Mr. PAPPAS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to mark the 50th anniversary of 
the Pell Grant Program. 
Programs like Pell help break down 
longstanding, often systemic barriers 
to education so that everyone has the 
chance to reach their full potential. 
In my district, over 65,000 students 
are receiving over $165 million to pur-
sue their higher education goals at our 
local colleges. The Pell grant is further 
leveraged by the University of New 
Hampshire 
Granite 
Guarantee 
pro-
gram, which allows students who are 
Pell-eligible to attend UNH, Keene 
State, or Plymouth State tuition-free 
by leveraging Pell, Federal aid, and in-
stitutional support to ensure access to 
high-quality public education in New 
Hampshire. 
Putting 
higher 
education 
within 
reach for more people has been a strong 
priority of mine since taking office, 
and we have worked to increase fund-
ing for Pell grants and provide the kind 
of resources that our students deserve. 
The education these students receive 
will help them fulfill their dreams and 
develop their greatest abilities. I look 
forward to Congress continuing to sup-
port access to college through the Pell 
grant for another 50 years. 
f 
CELEBRATING ELEANOR 
OTTOSON’S 105TH BIRTHDAY 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in honor of a be-
loved woman and an outstanding Geor-
gian, Eleanor Ottoson. 
Eleanor and her family were recently 
blessed to celebrate Eleanor’s 105th 
birthday. Born on a warm day in May 
of 1917, Eleanor spread her love across 
New Jersey and Pennsylvania before fi-
nally finding a home in McIntosh 
County, Georgia. 
Mrs. Ottoson diligently served her 
community as a registered nurse and 
now continues this service as an active 
member of Morgan’s Chapel United 
Methodist Church. 
A 
mother 
and 
a 
grandmother, 
Eleanor’s heart holds no shortage of 
love. She shares this love by helping 
around her church, knitting bags, sing-
ing songs, and sharing her life with all 
those around her. 
When asked about how she has lived 
to her outstanding age of 105, Eleanor 
spoke of her lifelong commitment to 
health. Mrs. Ottoson never smoked and 
never drank to excess. Instead, she 
made a point to eat well, sleep well, 
and treat others well. 
I smile when I hear about the great 
joy going on in the lives of my con-
stituents, 
and 
I 
am 
so 
thankful 
Eleanor’s loved ones continue to have 
her with them through these years. 
f 
PELL GRANTS OPEN DOOR TO 
OPPORTUNITY 
(Ms. MANNING asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. MANNING. Mr. Speaker, 50 years 
ago, Congress launched the Pell Grant 
Program to provide direct financial aid 
to low-income students to increase ac-
cess to higher education. This program 
has opened up the door of opportunity 
and made the dream of college a re-
ality for millions of students across the 
country. 
In North Carolina’s Sixth District, 
over 30,000 students are utilizing nearly 
$140 million in Pell grants to pursue 
their higher education goals at local 
colleges and universities. Nationwide, 
nearly 7 million students, or 40 percent 
of undergraduates, are Pell grant re-
cipients. 
As a member of the Education and 
Labor Committee, I am proud to share 
my support for Pell grants and to have 
supported a $400 increase to the max-
imum annual award. By increasing the 
Pell grant award, we are ensuring that 
more students can attend college and 
join the skilled workforce in their de-
sired career field. 
I look forward to Congress con-
tinuing the bipartisan support for ex-
panding 
student 
access 
to 
college 
through Pell grants for another 50 
years. 
f 
RANDY MARION RECEIVES 
LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD 
(Ms. FOXX asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I rise to rec-
ognize Randy Marion, the owner of 
Randy Marion Automotive Group and a 
true titan of entrepreneurship in North 
Carolina. 
Recently, Randy was selected as the 
recipient of the 2022 Lifetime Achieve-
ment Award from the North Carolina 
Automobile Dealers Association. His 
automotive group is one of the largest 
car dealerships in the Carolinas, and he 
has built a reputation that is second to 
none. 
This award is a testament to his en-
trepreneurial spirit, civic leadership, 
and commitment to furthering the 
automobile industry within the Tar 
Heel State, as well as his being a won-
derful role model and citizen. 
Congratulations, Randy, on this tre-
mendous accomplishment. Here is to 
many more years of serving the State 
of North Carolina and continuing to 
serve as the great role model that you 
are.

DEMOCRATS’ WAR ON 
AFFORDABLE ENERGY 
(Mr. SMITH of Missouri asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Missouri. 
Madam 
Speaker, families everywhere are feel-
ing the pain of Washington Democrats’ 
radical climate agenda. 
President Biden launched the war on 
American energy when he canceled the 
Keystone XL pipeline on his first day 
in office. He has also banned new lease 
sales for oil and gas, and his regulatory 
onslaught is limiting U.S. energy pro-
duction. 
As a result, Americans are paying 
the price for the far left’s costly energy 
agenda every time they flip a light 
switch, buy groceries, or drive to work. 
But that is the goal of Washington 
Democrats’ climate agenda: Drive up 
the cost of traditional energy sources 
to force our Nation’s transition to al-
ternatives that are less reliable, widely 
unavailable, and even more expensive. 
America cannot afford the left’s war 
on affordable energy. What America 
needs right now is the all-of-the-above 
energy agenda put in place by Presi-
dent Trump and Republicans in Con-
gress.

CELEBRATING CARIBBEAN 
AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH 
(Mr. BOWMAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BOWMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in honor of Caribbean American 
Heritage Month. 
New York’s 16th Congressional Dis-
trict is a rich bastion of many Carib-
bean communities and cultures. I am 
proud to represent constituents from 
the 
Dominican 
Republic, 
Jamaica, 
Puerto Rico, Grenada, Haiti, Saint 
Lucia, the Bahamas, Barbados, Guy-
ana, Trinidad and Tobago, and many 
more. 
The vibrancy and brilliance of this 
community have shaped the essence of 
our district and this Nation. The im-
pact of Caribbean heritage on the State 
of New York and our country is tre-
mendous. 
I specifically recognize the impact of 
three organizations that celebrate Car-
ibbean culture in our district. The All 
Islands Association, the Jamaican Pro-
gressive League, and the Dominican 
Cultural Association of Yonkers have 
been critical in empowering neighbors 
and delivering critical resources and 
services. 
I am proud to represent such a di-
verse community of people and honored 
to continue making New York 16 a bet-
ter place for all as we work for better 
housing, immigration, workers’ and 
care rights, and entrepreneurship op-
portunities. 
DAIRY INDUSTRY CONTRIBUTES 
TO HEALTHY CHILDREN 
(Ms. TENNEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. TENNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize National Dairy 
Month, which we celebrate each June. 
The dairy industry is a major force in 
our economy. It is the largest single 
segment of New York’s agricultural in-
dustry. There are more than 3,500 dairy 
farms across New York. This month 
and every month, we celebrate their 
contributions to communities across 
America. 
Many of the dairy farms in the 22nd 
District are family owned and oper-
ated. As they continue to recover from 
the disruptions of the pandemic, I will 
work tirelessly to support our local 
dairy farmers the same way they 
worked tirelessly to deliver for our 
communities and our Nation. 
People of all ages, especially chil-
dren, receive crucial nutrients to grow 
healthy and strong by drinking milk. 
That is why I have cosponsored bipar-
tisan legislation like the Whole Milk 
for Healthy Kids Act to ensure that 
every child will have access to nutri-
tion-rich milk in school cafeterias, just 
like the awesome chocolate milk that I 
got when I was growing up. As Elon 
Musk said, ‘‘Chocolate milk is insanely 
good.’’ 
As 
we 
celebrate 
National 
Dairy 
Month, we appreciate the dairy farmers 
who both drive our local economies and 
ensure our communities are healthy. 
Let’s put milk, whole milk, and choco-
late milk back in our schools. 
f 
BABY FORMULA SHORTAGE CRISIS 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, ac-
cording to a new whistleblower report, 
OSHA had reports of health and safety 
problems at the Michigan baby formula 
plant all the way back in February 
2021. That is a year before the plant 
was indefinitely shut down by FDA and 
well over a year before the Biden ad-
ministration even acknowledged it. 
The administration knew for at least 
months, if not well over a year, that 
this crisis would happen with the 
shortages, but they failed to act be-
cause they didn’t consider it a top-level 
crisis. Now, over 70 percent of the Na-
tion’s baby formula is out of stock. In 
what universe is that not a top-level 
crisis? 
How is it possible that our FDA is so 
incompetent that they sat idle for 14 
months, knowing full well that Amer-
ican babies and families would suffer 
shortages? 
How inept is the administration that 
they would admit to knowing about 
this looming crisis for months but ig-
nored it? 
How cruel is the Biden administra-
tion that while American parents des-
perately search for formula for their 
babies, the administration is taking it 
right off the shelves and shipping it 
down to the border? 
Even the Biden administration’s deal 
with the Abbott plant to restart pro-
duction will take 6 to 8 weeks to put 
formula back on the shelves. People 
can’t wait that long. 
The 
Biden 
administration 
should 
have addressed this worsening baby 
formula shortage when House Repub-
licans raised the alarm months ago. We 
will hold this administration account-
able for this issue.

CELEBRATING PRIDE MONTH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
MANNING). Under the Speaker’s an-
nounced policy of January 4, 2021, the 
gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. 
CICILLINE) is recognized for 60 minutes 
as the designee of the majority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on the subject of my Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Rhode Island? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, my 
colleagues and I are here today for this 
Special Order hour to celebrate Pride 
Month. 
Pride is a time of celebration of our 
community and its diversity. It is a 
time to uplift LGBTQ+ people all 
across the country and honor our iden-
tities and how these individuals have 
shaped our lives. 
Pride is also a time of action. Fifty- 
three 
years 
ago, 
LGBTQ+ 
patrons 
fought back against discrimination and 
police 
harassment 
at 
New 
York’s 
Stonewall Inn. Now, we need to harness 
that same strength and determination 
to fight back against State legisla-
tures’ attacks against our community, 
especially trans and nonbinary kids. 
For every person able to celebrate 
Pride Month, there are others who are 
struggling. There are countless people 
unable to come out because of dis-
crimination, harassment, and threats 
of violence. In too many States, this 
discrimination is being led by elected 
officials. 
Here in Congress, the Congressional 
LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus fights every 
day so that all people, regardless of 
sexual identification or gender iden-
tity, can live their lives openly and 
have every opportunity to be successful 
and to lead happy lives. 
I am proud to have introduced the 
Equality Act, along with every single 
member of the Democratic Caucus as 
cosponsors, to ensure that LGBTQ+ 
people are protected from discrimina-
tion in key areas of life. I also intro-
duced the Global Respect Act to deny

visas to those who commit gross 
human rights abuses against members 
of the LGBTQ+ community around the 
world. 
Both of these bills passed the House 
with bipartisan support, and I urge the 
Senate to quickly do the same and ad-
vance LGBTQ+ equality both at home 
and abroad. 
b 1915 
As chair of the Equality Caucus, I 
will never stop fighting so that all 
LGBTQ+ people, no matter where they 
live or how they identify, can live their 
lives openly with the full protections of 
our Federal laws. 
We have made important progress 
this Congress. In addition to passing 
several LGBTQ+ bills through the 
House, two key caucus priority bills 
have also become law: H.R. 49, to des-
ignate the Pulse nightclub as a Na-
tional Memorial, and S. 937, which in-
cluded the Jabara-Heyer NO HATE 
Act, which provides for grants to im-
prove data collection of hate crimes, 
including hate crimes motivated by 
sexual orientation or gender identity, 
and grants for States to create hotlines 
to assist victims of hate crimes. 
I am so grateful we have a devoted 
ally to the LGBTQ+ community in the 
White House who signed both of these 
bills into law. President Biden has been 
a champion for our community. Just 
last week, he signed an executive order 
advancing LGBTQI+ equality during 
Pride Month. This executive order 
aligns with the goals of numerous bills 
introduced by Equality Caucus mem-
bers. 
But we are not done fighting for 
LGBTQ+ equality. Later this week, we 
will be voting on the LGBTQI+ Data 
Inclusion Act to ensure Federal sur-
veys 
collect 
information 
on 
the 
LGBTQI+ community. We know better 
data leads to better policies, and this 
bill will ensure we have the data we 
need to draft the best solutions to ad-
dress the needs of our community. 
It has been an especially difficult 
year for our community, particularly 
for transgender and nonbinary youth 
who are under attack across the coun-
try. 
Please know that the Congressional 
LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus and I will 
never stop fighting for you. You de-
serve to live your lives openly, free 
from discrimination or harassment, 
and to have every opportunity to suc-
ceed as your non-LGBTQ+ peers. 
This Pride Month, we all have to re-
commit to fighting for true equality 
for all, every single person in our coun-
try, no matter where they live, no mat-
ter their gender identity or sexual ori-
entation. 
I am so grateful to be joined today by 
several of my colleagues who are help-
ing to lead this fight for LGBTQ+ 
equality in the Halls of Congress, and I 
look forward to hearing from them dur-
ing this Special Order hour. 
I again extend a happy Pride to ev-
eryone. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Massachusetts 
(Mr. 
MOULTON), a member of the Equality 
Caucus, a strong advocate for the 
LGBTQ+ community, who took time 
out of a markup to be sure that he 
could be a part of this Special Order. 
For that, we are incredibly grateful. 
Mr. MOULTON. Madam Speaker, I 
want to start by thanking my remark-
able colleague for his courageous lead-
ership, truly courageous leadership, on 
this and so many other issues for the 
House of Representatives. 
I rise today to celebrate and honor 
the LGBTQ+ community during Pride 
Month. 
As we uplift this diverse and resilient 
community, I would like to use my 
time to spotlight the unique challenges 
faced 
by 
two 
important 
groups: 
LGBTQ+ youth and LGBTQ+ veterans. 
Today, a growing contingent of the 
Republican 
Party 
is 
scapegoating 
LGBTQ+ youth and veterans through 
ignorant rhetoric and irresponsible 
policies. Their words and actions are 
worsening an already devastating men-
tal health crisis among these kids. 
Being a teenager is hard enough. You 
are finding your place, figuring out 
who you are and what you want to do. 
Now imagine waking up each day and 
hearing the people who are supposed to 
be 
leaders 
tearing 
you 
down, 
villainizing who you are, all for polit-
ical gain. 
This is unconscionable, and it has 
real-life consequences. 
The Trevor Project estimates that 
more than 1.8 million LGBTQ+ young 
people attempt or seriously consider 
suicide 
every 
year 
in 
the 
United 
States. 
Another group whose challenges we 
don’t talk about enough are LGBTQ+ 
veterans, who experience higher rates 
of 
depression 
and 
more 
frequent 
thoughts of suicide than others. 
I served with gay and bisexual great 
Americans in the Marines. For years 
under ‘‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,’’ one of 
my very good friends, Joe, kept the 
fact that he is gay hidden so that he 
could put his life on the line for our 
country in Iraq. 
Then when he got out of the Marines, 
he came out of the closet. But a year 
after that, in 2007, he got recalled to 
Active Duty. All he had to do to avoid 
another deployment was to pick up the 
phone and say two words to the Depart-
ment of Defense: ‘‘I’m gay.’’ But he 
didn’t. He didn’t want anyone to go in 
his place. So he went back into the 
closet so that he could go back to the 
war, putting his life on the line again 
for another tour. 
Joe, like so many others in his shoes, 
chose to serve our country. Yet, simply 
because of who they are, these patriots 
have dealt with unforgivable discrimi-
nation. For many LGBTQ+ vets, the 
mental health impacts are lifelong. 
The scope of this mental health crisis 
is broad. We have come a long way, but 
we are facing a moment where that 
progress is at risk of moving backward 
instead of forward. 
On July 16, we will take one big step 
forward when the 988 mental health 
emergencies hotline goes live. 
Just like dialing 911 during a medical 
emergency, every single American will 
now have access to another easy-to-re-
member number. 
This is just the first step. It is my 
hope that in the future, dialing 988 will 
give LGBTQ+ people the option to 
speak with someone who is specially 
trained to address the unique chal-
lenges 
faced 
by 
this 
community. 
LGBTQ+ Americans need to know that 
they can have access to the mental 
health resources they need just by 
picking up the phone. Because every 
American should know, in a time of 
crisis, you are not alone. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for his very pow-
erful words and for being here tonight. 
As Congressman MOULTON was speak-
ing, I was thinking of Congressman 
PAPPAS, because Congressman PAPPAS 
has been a great champion for vet-
erans. He serves as a distinguished 
member of the Transportation and In-
frastructure Committee and the Vet-
erans’ Affairs Committee and in that 
role has been an extraordinary na-
tional leader on veterans’ issues. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
New 
Hampshire 
(Mr. 
PAPPAS), a co-chairman of the Equality 
Caucus 
and 
a 
champion 
for 
the 
LGBTQ+ community. 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Representative CICILLINE for or-
ganizing this Special Order hour. 
I rise to mark Pride Month. Pride is 
an important opportunity for all of us, 
regardless of our orientation, to come 
together and celebrate our Nation’s di-
versity and to keep striving to perfect 
this Union, to make sure that there is 
truly freedom and equality for all. 
As a gay person growing up in New 
Hampshire, it wasn’t always easy for 
me to see a path forward and to know 
that there would be a place for me in 
my community. But I am really fortu-
nate that my family and my commu-
nity welcomed me for who I am. I 
couldn’t be more proud today to be 
able to serve them in Congress and to 
continue this fight for equality. 
All people deserve to live their lives 
as their true selves, without fear of 
harassment, discrimination, violence, 
or imprisonment. But we know many 
LGBTQ+ Americans don’t have the 
same legal protections that are guaran-
teed to others. No one should be a sec-
ond-class citizen in this country, and 
they shouldn’t be a second-class citizen 
anywhere in the world just for being 
LGBTQ+. Unfortunately, we know that 
far too many people face violence and 
persecution just for being who they 
are. 
In Afghanistan today, LGBTQ+ peo-
ple have been harassed, attacked, and 
sexually assaulted due to their sexual 
orientation and gender identity. 
I called for the State Department to 
allow LGBTQ+ Afghans to access the 
U.S. Refugee Admissions Program to

help them ensure that they could find 
safety because of Taliban rule, which 
we know now threatens LGBTQ+ indi-
viduals with the prospect of a violent 
death. 
Russia, which has banned same-sex 
marriage, recently shutdown the coun-
try’s main LGBTQ+ organization, and 
there are reports that Russia plans to 
target the LGBTQ+ community in 
Ukraine during its invasion. 
As we speak, we know Brittney 
Griner, who is an openly gay WNBA 
player, remains wrongfully detained by 
Russian authorities. 
It should concern us all that an 
American has been wrongfully detained 
abroad in any circumstance, but that is 
made even more troubling by the fact 
that Russia’s laws don’t accommodate 
and protect the community. We have 
seen a recent uptick in vigilante vio-
lence against LGBTQ+ individuals in 
that country. 
In our own country, we still haven’t 
yet banned the use of the so-called 
‘‘gay panic’’ or ‘‘trans panic’’ defenses 
in Federal court that can be used to ac-
tually blame victims of violence for 
the violence that is committed against 
them. I have introduced legislation in 
Congress to ban these so-called de-
fenses, and it is time to get it done. 
They 
legitimize 
homophobia 
and 
transphobia that leads to violence 
against LGBTQ+ people, and we must 
end their use. 
We see too much homophobia and 
transphobia that has no place in Amer-
ica today. Last year, in my home State 
of New Hampshire, a man was punched 
in the face in downtown Manchester 
just for holding hands with his boy-
friend walking downtown. His assailant 
later told investigators that he didn’t 
approve of homosexuality. This hap-
pened in my community in 2021. 
Just last year, we saw transphobic 
attacks in the neighboring town of 
Derry that caused a community event 
to have to be moved to a different 
venue for safety reasons. 
This is just not the New Hampshire 
way, it is not the American way, and it 
shows that we have work to do at all 
levels to combat this. 
I hope that people out there who fear 
for their safety know that there are 
LGBTQ+ individuals who are fighting 
for them in the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives and lots of policymakers 
who are allies working to ensure that 
you can live your lives free of harass-
ment, discrimination, and violence. 
We have got to pass the Equality Act 
to ensure that all Americans can live 
free from discrimination and to send 
the unequivocal message that every 
LGBTQ+ American and their families 
matter. Doing so will give full legal 
protection to all Americans, regardless 
of who they are or whom they love. 
This legislation is crucial, and it is 
especially crucial as we see what the 
Supreme Court is poised to do, on the 
verge of overturning landmark prece-
dent, and rolling back the fundamental 
right to privacy in this country. 
I know these challenges can seem 
daunting. We do feel that there is an 
uneven march toward progress, where 
sometimes we take a couple steps for-
ward and then we see a step backward. 
I remember my first speech on the 
floor of the New Hampshire House of 
Representatives in my early twenties. 
We were fighting against a bill that 
would have prevented New Hampshire 
from recognizing same-sex marriages 
performed in Massachusetts. We were 
fighting against that legislation. We 
lost the fight. We came up short. 
But in just a matter of a few years, 
we saw civil unions and then same-sex 
marriage approved legislatively, signed 
by our Governor into law in New 
Hampshire, because those elected offi-
cials were reflecting the will of the 
people and recognizing that the coun-
try is changing and moving forward 
and that our laws need to catch up. 
So Pride Month is a time to rededi-
cate ourselves to a fight that we still 
need to win. We move forward by pro-
moting equality because it is impor-
tant to lift each other up. It is impor-
tant to ensure that everyone can live 
openly as their true self. 
To everyone out there, no matter 
your sexual orientation, your gender 
identity, your profession, or where you 
call home, you should be proud of who 
you are. This is how we are going to 
continue to change this country for the 
better and move forward and ensure 
that everyone is included. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Congressman PAPPAS so much 
for his powerful words and for his lead-
ership and the example he has set. 
Madam Speaker, I will now call on 
another co-chairman of the Equality 
Caucus, 
an 
extraordinarily 
distin-
guished member of the Financial Serv-
ices Committee and Homeland Secu-
rity Committee and someone who, 
though he is very young, has, through-
out his entire life, been a great inspira-
tion to young LGBTQ Americans and 
continues that great tradition as a 
Member of Congress. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. TORRES). 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I am proud to be a gay man in 
Congress. I stand here as living proof 
that the long arc of history bends to-
ward LGBTQ equality. 
I am the first Latino and Black 
LGBTQ Member of Congress, and I 
proudly serve as vice chair of the 
Homeland Security Committee. 
Back in the 1950s, President Eisen-
hower issued an executive order declar-
ing people like me to be a threat to 
homeland security. Out of his execu-
tive order came the ‘‘lavender scare,’’ 
the systematic purge of gay people 
from the ranks of Federal employment. 
So the LGBTQ experience in America 
is as much about pain as it is about 
pride. We have seen the lives and liveli-
hoods of untold numbers of people rav-
aged by homophobia. 
I wish to speak about one of those 
people, Walter Jenkins, who served 
honorably during the Johnson adminis-
tration, in a time of national turmoil, 
only to have his brilliant career cut 
short by homophobia. 
On October 15, 1964, a columnist 
named William White wrote a tribute 
to Mr. Jenkins. It was so poignantly 
and eloquently written that it bears 
reading on the House floor, and so read 
it, I will. 
b 1930 
The title is, ‘‘A Graveyard Marked 
Despair.’’ 
A human tragedy of measureless pathos, a 
tragedy to tear the heart as few things have 
ever done in my 50-odd years of rather ur-
gent living is the story of Walter Jenkins. 
It is too early to say what effects there 
may be from Jenkins’ resignation, as one of 
the special White House assistants, in dread-
ful circumstances involving his arrest on dis-
orderly conduct charges. Nor does this col-
umnist now concern himself in the slightest 
way with this question. When one sees a 
friend bury a lost career, common humanity 
requires at least a brief wait at a graveside 
marked despair before reckoning up who else 
has gained or lost what. 
The present purpose has nothing to do with 
partisanship or even with politics in general. 
It is simply to stand as a human being with 
Walter Jenkins, to make one man’s testi-
mony to Walter Jenkins, in an hour for him 
and his wife and his six children of a sorrow 
and horror that has come to few even in the 
harsh profession to which he has given his 
life. 
I have just come from the hospital room of 
Walter Jenkins. It is a scene that will burn 
forever in the memory of one whose own pro-
fession as a correspondent has caused him to 
see much of human suffering—the death of so 
many in battle, the death of hope for so 
many others. 
Walter Jenkins I have known for 20 years. 
Walter Jenkins I saluted in print when he be-
came President Johnson’s assistant upon Mr. 
JOHNSON’s accession to the White House 
after another tragedy just short of 12 months 
ago. I said then of Walter Jenkins that he 
was one of the most honorable, most con-
scientious, and most truly moral men I ever 
knew. I repeat the statement today—every 
word of it. 
For the Walter Jenkins I now see in this 
time of trouble is a Walter Jenkins broken 
at last under the terrible pressures it has 
been my sad lot to observe in life. I do not 
know precisely what in this shattered state 
he may have done or not done. I have not 
asked him; and I do not intend to ask him. 
But this I do know if I have any human 
judgment at all: Here is a man long suffering 
from combat fatigue as surely as any man 
ever suffered in battle; and of that kind of 
combat fatigue I have seen plenty, too. At 
the hospital I told this to his doctor. The 
doctor replied softly, ‘‘Yes, you are right. 
Except that for this kind of combat fatigue, 
they give no medals.’’ 
When President Johnson came to power, in 
a frightened and divided Nation, suffering 
the shock of the assassination of John F. 
Kennedy, he put all his enormous heart and 
energies into reuniting the Nation and keep-
ing its ancient institution going on, levelly 
and unafraid. So did Walter Jenkins to the 
last extent of his own talents and his own 
strength. 
It was not easy for any of the Johnson peo-
ple. They had their sophisticated sniping de-
tractors—behind their backs within the 
Democratic Party as well as in front of them 
among their natural and proper Republican 
opposition. Jenkins became, next to the

President himself, the chief whipping boy. 
Totally dedicated, tolerant and forgiving be-
yond ready belief, he patiently worked his 
15-hour day, his 7-day week, while the biters 
bit—and bit and bit—at him. 
As month after month wore on, Jenkins 
developed a red and frightening flush that 
told even a layman of a dangerously high 
blood pressure. But, like the President, he 
never called for either the medic or the chap-
lain, as they used to say in the Army. There 
was work to be done—and for at least 15 
years—long before the White House days—he 
had worked far too hard. 
Finally, he reached that point of utter 
physical and nervous and emotional exhaus-
tion which will at the end, break any man of 
any size. So now he is broken. So now they 
say this and that of him. But the actions— 
actual or only alleged, true or trumped up— 
of men broken in battle are not held against 
them by civilized men. 
So, there is, at last, this to say. For 46 
years Walter Jenkins has lived a life of de-
cency, of high public service, of courage, of 
honor and devotion. If there has in fact been 
a slip, it has not been from the real, the true, 
Walter Jenkins. It has been from the shat-
tered man—the man who has known no rest 
but now must have rest to regain his true 
self. 
Let he who wishes cast the first stone. But 
any man who tries to make capital of this 
man’s tragedy will forever lessen himself in 
the eyes of a judgment that is infinitely 
more important than a mere political judg-
ment—the judgment of decent humankind. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for his words and 
for the example that he set. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Michigan (Ms. STE-
VENS), my friend, a member of the 
Equality Caucus, and an incredibly 
strong advocate for the LGBTQ+ com-
munity, a cosponsor of the Equality 
Act, and a cosponsor of every single 
piece of legislation that has come to 
the floor of consequence to our commu-
nity. 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, it is 
a profound honor to be the Congress-
woman from Oakland County standing 
here this evening with my colleagues 
from the Equality Caucus recognizing 
and celebrating Pride Month. 
Gay rights. Nonbinary rights. Les-
bian rights. Trans rights. Trans stu-
dents’ rights. Bisexual rights. 
You are seen. You are loved. And you 
belong. 
We say rights because your rights are 
indeed human rights. Gay rights are 
human rights and human rights are 
gay rights. And in the plight to end 
discrimination, the words ring out that 
were spoken in the Michigan State 
House chamber just recently by a self- 
proclaimed straight, White, married, 
Christian, 
suburban 
mom, 
Mallory 
McMorrow, who declared very loudly 
for the Nation to hear that hate won’t 
win; that we will not stand for those 
who do not seek to govern, who do not 
seek 
to 
tackle 
gun 
violence, 
to 
marginalize already marginalized peo-
ple. 
We speak the words of the only open-
ly gay State senator from Michigan, 
Jeremy Moss, who rightly pointed out 
that it was not the trans community 
that stormed the Capitol on January 6. 
Oh, no. 
We 
celebrate 
our 
milestones 
in 
Michigan. We celebrate our significant 
individuals who are making history 
today: My friend, Amanda Shelton, 
running to be the first lesbian to serve 
on the Oakland County Circuit Court, 
joining our first openly gay Oakland 
County 
Circuit 
judge, 
Jay 
Cunningham. 
We have Dana Nessel, our attorney 
general, the first openly gay State- 
wide elected individual. 
In my own office, we have John Mar-
tin as head of the LGBTQ Staff Asso-
ciation, hailing from Grosse Pointe, 
serving in my office. 
Pride Month is a proclamation. It is 
a self-affirmation. It is a bolstering of 
our friends in the LGBTQ community, 
and it is a bolstering of a movement we 
are still pushing for. 
Yes, it is joy. Yes, it is love. Yes, it 
is the declaration that love will be 
louder than your hate. We celebrate 
pride. I invite all of you to join us in 
Michigan to do so because no pride 
event is bigger or bolder than the place 
that I call home, whether we are 
marching in Detroit or marching in 
Ferndale, where people are free to be 
themselves. 
Ferndale, Michigan, the home of af-
firmations, decades and decades of 
LGBTQ rights, right here in Oakland 
County, 
Michigan. 
From 
Oakland 
County to the Halls of Congress, I 
speak these words. 
Harvey Milk reminds us: It takes no 
compromise to give people their rights. 
It takes no money to respect the indi-
vidual. It takes no money to end polit-
ical division and to give people free-
dom, and it certainly takes no survey 
to remove repression. 
It takes Pride Month to love louder. 
It takes Pride Month to remind us how 
we will overcome. It takes Pride Month 
to remind and to push to end harass-
ment and discrimination that, yes, 
have seeped into the Halls of the Con-
gress; where on the Committee on Edu-
cation and Labor, I had to take a com-
mittee vote to vote ‘‘no,’’ because a 
colleague who I serve with and vote 
with here said that if we are going to 
do mental health on college campuses, 
we should strip the protections for the 
LGBTQ community. That took place in 
the year 2022. 
But our love is louder this Pride 
Month. Our love is certainly louder and 
ringing, with my friend, Congressman 
CICILLINE, through his great leadership 
in Rhode Island to my friend, CHRIS 
PAPPAS
in New Hampshire, to my 
friend, 
RITCHIE
TORRES
from 
New 
York—history-makers in their own 
right. 
Troy Perry, the reverend: The Lord is 
my shepherd and he certainly knows I 
am gay. 
Together, we celebrate, we recognize, 
we overcome, and we continue in the 
pursuit for gay rights in this country. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for her words 
and her tremendous support of the 
LGBTQ+ community. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. GREEN), my friend, a 
member of the Equality Caucus, a 
strong and consistent advocate for the 
LGBTQ+ community, the lead sponsor 
of the House LGBTQIA+ Pride Month 
resolution for many, many years, and a 
great champion for our community. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I thank my friend and colleague, 
Mr. CICILLINE, for the opportunity. 
Madam Speaker, I am a proud ally 
and 
member 
of 
the 
Congressional 
LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus. Why? I will 
share with you a brief vignette. 
When I was a much younger person, I 
had a friend whose name was Glen. 
Glen was small in stature. He never 
bothered anybody. He was friendly, 
gregarious; very much outgoing. I 
didn’t understand Glen, but I had 
friends who thought they understood 
him. 
My friends, Mr. CICILLINE, would pick 
on Glen. They called him queer. They 
invited him to do things that were un-
acceptable. I never spoke up for Glen. I 
saw him and left. I had the opportunity 
to take a stand for justice and against 
hate. 
My friend, Glen, has gone on to 
glory, and I have allowed his memory 
to haunt me because of my failure to 
do what I could easily have done. I am 
an ally because I have seen the behav-
ior of people who disrespect the hu-
manity that every person merits by 
virtue of just being born. That is all. 
The 
Constitution 
recognizes 
my 
rights, 
recognizes 
your 
rights. 
It 
doesn’t grant us a right, and we didn’t 
recognize Glen’s rights. 
As a result, I will probably do many 
things in life to try to make up for my 
failure at a time when someone needed 
me and I could have been there, and I 
wasn’t. 
b 1945 
So to my friend Glen, I have intro-
duced the LGBTQIA+ Pride Month Res-
olution. It encourages the celebration 
of the month of June as LGBTQIA+ 
Pride Month, and it tracks the accom-
plishments and milestones in the fight 
for LGBTQIA+ equality. It has 102 
original cosponsors. 
I have done more than this. I have in-
troduced H.R. 166, the Fair Lending for 
All Act. This piece of legislation passed 
the House recently, by the way, as part 
of the Financial Services Racial Eq-
uity, Inclusion, and Economic Justice 
Act. This piece of legislation would 
clarify and extend antidiscrimination 
laws to include sexual orientation and 
gender identity. 
I 
thank 
the 
Honorable 
MAXINE 
WATERS for helping to bring this legis-
lation to the floor. In fact, but for her, 
it would not have been to the floor for 
the vote that it received. 
Here is the most significant aspect of 
the legislation. Not only does it indi-
cate that you can’t discriminate based 
upon sexual orientation or gender iden-
tity; it makes it a crime to do so—a 
crime to do so. Some things bear re-
peating. It can serve as a mnemonic de-
vice. It makes it a crime to do so.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5816 
June 22, 2022 
If the banks are defrauded, you, as a 
citizen, can be fined up to $1 million. 
Nothing comparable to this exists if a 
person happens to have a gender iden-
tity or sexual orientation that is unac-
ceptable to a loan officer, and the loan 
officer concludes that you are not wor-
thy of a loan that you are qualified for 
in all other ways. If this bill passes the 
Senate, not only will it be a crime, but 
you will do time if you are found 
guilty, and you will have to pay a fine. 
There are some things that we ought 
not tolerate in life, and that is invid-
ious discrimination against anyone. We 
ought not tolerate it because if you 
tolerate it, you perpetuate it. 
To my friend Glen, I want you to 
know that I am still in the struggle 
that you caused me to realize was more 
than just a bunch of guys having fun 
playing pranks on another person. 
Finally, I am not sure where this 
country is going because, in the State 
of Texas, the Republican platform indi-
cates that there are but two gender 
identities: You are either a biological 
male, or you are a biological female. 
This is in the Republican platform. I 
don’t know where we are going, but it 
is not in the right direction because 
you are denying, by virtue of this kind 
of platform, the identity of transgender 
people. 
Who are you to tell other people who 
they are? You tried it with me. When I 
was born, I was a Negro. It wasn’t my 
decision. It wasn’t my mother’s deci-
sion. You denied me of my cultural in-
tegrity. You are still up to your old 
tricks, demeaning others to somehow 
conclude that it is better for you. 
I don’t know where we are going, but 
we are going in the wrong direction. 
We ought not let the State of Texas do 
this without some rebuff, some indica-
tion that we won’t tolerate it because 
it is but a harbinger of things to come. 
This is the State of Texas where a lot 
of unpleasant things are born. 
The State of Texas also wants to re-
peal the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The 
State of Texas wants to secede from 
the Union. I understand these things, 
but I don’t understand denying a per-
son’s identity. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Mr. 
CICILLINE for the time. I am an ally, 
and I am a friend you can count on. I 
will not allow myself to fail to speak 
up ever again in life when it comes to 
injustice against anybody. Dr. King 
was right: ‘‘Injustice anywhere is a 
threat to justice everywhere.’’ 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Mr. GREEN, and I know Glen is 
looking down very proud of your words 
tonight and the difference it is going to 
make to those who are watching. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. 
MANNING), a very thoughtful member of 
the Foreign Affairs Committee, as well 
as someone who serves on the Edu-
cation and Labor Committee, a mem-
ber of the Equality Caucus, and a long-
time champion of equality, justice, 
women’s reproductive healthcare, and 
so many issues important to the 
LGBTQ+ community, and my friend. 
Ms. MANNING. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Mr. CICILLINE for holding this 
Special Order. I am proud to rise to cel-
ebrate Pride Month. 
This month, we honor the many con-
tributions of the LGBTQ community 
while recognizing that the fight for 
equality is ongoing. 
I recently watched a documentary on 
PBS called ‘‘The Lavender Scare.’’ I 
was amazed to learn how liberating 
military service during World War II 
was for so many members of the 
LGBTQ community. The people from 
small towns and rural areas were re-
lieved to meet so many others in the 
military who shared their feelings 
about sexuality and gender. They real-
ized that they were not alone, and they 
could be valuable members of the war 
effort. 
But then, when they returned home 
after V-E Day, they were confronted 
with the Red Scare and the nightmare 
that was Senator Joe McCarthy, who 
ruined many lives by calling on govern-
ment officials to identify homosexuals 
and remove them from their govern-
ment jobs, claiming they were vulner-
able to blackmail by Communists and 
could be induced to reveal national se-
crets. It is a shameful part of our his-
tory that I never really knew about. 
Thankfully, we have come a long way 
since the Lavender Scare and the 
Stonewall riots of 53 years ago, includ-
ing the recognition of marriage equal-
ity in 2015, the enactment of landmark 
hate crime legislation, and extending 
title IX protections to include LGBTQ 
students. We have made progress to-
ward equality, but there is much more 
work to be done. 
We must remain vigilant in our fight 
to protect freedom of expression, equal 
marriage rights, and the right to ac-
cess gender-affirming healthcare and 
healthcare free of discrimination. We 
also need to continue the fight against 
discrimination in housing, employ-
ment, 
public 
accommodations, 
and 
much more. 
To every LGBTQ person who is con-
cerned about what the future holds, I 
will tell you this: I see you; I value 
you; I support you; and I will continue 
to fight for you in Congress. 
I believe that all Americans should 
be able to live their lives free from dis-
crimination based on sexual orienta-
tion or gender identity, and I condemn 
all attempts to roll back hard-won 
progress. 
As a member of the Equality Caucus, 
I have helped pass LGBTQ-related bills, 
including two pieces of legislation that 
were recently signed into law by Presi-
dent Biden. 
The first of these new laws is the 
Jabara-Heyer NO HATE Act, which im-
proves data collection for hate crimes, 
including hate crimes motivated by 
sexual orientation or gender identity. 
This law also allows States to apply for 
grants to create hotlines to assist vic-
tims of hate crimes. 
The other law designates the Pulse 
nightclub in Orlando, Florida, as a na-
tional memorial, honoring those who 
lost their lives to the senseless vio-
lence that took place on June 12, 2016. 
I am proud to have cosponsored and 
voted in favor of H.R. 5, the Equality 
Act, which bars discrimination in the 
workplace, housing, and lending sys-
tems. I remember when we passed that 
that day, Mr. CICILLINE said to me: 
This bill will change lives. 
For far too long, LGBTQ Americans 
have lived in fear of hate and discrimi-
nation. The passage of the Equality 
Act is an important step toward guar-
anteeing that every American has the 
fundamental right to equality under 
the law. 
The House passed the Equality Act 
last year. It is time for the Senate to 
do the same. 
I thank Mr. CICILLINE for bringing us 
here tonight to recognize and celebrate 
the LGBTQ community. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for her beau-
tiful words and for her great support 
for the LGBTQ community. 
Madam Speaker, before I conclude 
tonight’s Special Order hour, I want to 
make some final comments. 
We celebrate pride as a community 
and very often people think of pride 
celebrations as joyous public events 
with lots of people gathering. We just 
had a pride celebration in Providence 
last weekend. The estimates were that 
over 100,000 people attended. 
Part of the importance of pride is 
that it is a moment of great visibility 
for our community. For too long, mem-
bers of the LGBTQ+ community were 
taught to be ashamed of who they are, 
to hide their true identity, sexual ori-
entation, or gender identity. Pride was 
not only a time to celebrate the impor-
tance of our community but to be visi-
ble—to stop being invisible people but 
to be visible in the communities where 
we live and work. 
Over the years, we have had extraor-
dinary leaders from our community in 
business, medicine, politics, the arts, 
education, and all areas of life. 
We have nine members of the LGBTQ 
community serving right here in the 
House and two in the United States 
Senate, examples of political leader-
ship all across the country so that 
young people can see themselves in 
people who are accomplishing things in 
all areas of life—in the law, politics, 
medicine, and education. 
It is a time of celebration, but we 
have to acknowledge this year that we 
are facing great challenges as a com-
munity. Particularly young trans kids 
and nonbinary kids are living in States 
where the adults are putting forth leg-
islation that will make them invisible, 
that will subject them to horrific dis-
crimination, that will not recognize 
the humanity of those young people. 
It is a time of celebration. It is a 
time to take stock of all that we have 
done. But it is also a time for action to 
remind ourselves and the rest of the

country that we demand to live in a 
country where we enjoy full legal pro-
tections and we can live our lives free 
from discrimination of any kind. 
The good news is, overwhelmingly, a 
vast majority of the American people 
support equality for LGBTQ people. 
They think discrimination is wrong. 
Equality is a founding value of this 
country. In every State in America, a 
majority of voters believe that dis-
crimination against LGBTQ people is 
wrong because a cornerstone of who we 
are as Americas is that we know dis-
crimination is wrong. 
It is only in the Republican Con-
ference that we have to convince peo-
ple that discrimination against the 
LGBTQ community is wrong. It is time 
for Congress and our Republican col-
leagues to catch up to the rest of the 
country that understands that when 
you deprive a member of the LGBTQ 
community of full equality, you not 
only hurt that individual but you hurt 
the whole community because the com-
munity is deprived of all that that per-
son can accomplish and contribute. 
That is the real harm of discrimina-
tion. It is not just to the individual. It 
is to the whole community and to our 
whole country. 
Madam Speaker, as we mark Pride 
Month, we not only celebrate, but we 
also commit ourselves to make addi-
tional progress to continue in our fight 
for full equality. The LGBTQ+ Equal-
ity Caucus here in the House will con-
tinue to lead that fight in solidarity 
with all of our colleagues. 
I am proud to be part of a political 
party 
that 
fully 
supports 
LGBTQ 
equality. When we introduced the 
Equality Act, it was cosponsored by 
every single Democrat in the Caucus. 
Everyone wanted to be a partner in 
this fight for full equality, and that is 
what the American people expect. 
Madam Speaker, I say to the young 
people out there who may be struggling 
with their own sexual orientation, 
their own gender identity, feeling 
alone, feeling like they don’t belong, 
feeling like they are not valued: I am 
standing on the floor of the House of 
Representatives as the chair of the 
Equality Caucus to tell you that you 
are valued. You are exactly how God 
created and expected you to be. You 
are loved by your community and your 
family. You will continue to be valued. 
You have people here in the Congress 
of the United States who are fighting 
every single day to make sure you can 
live in a country that will provide you 
with full protections and that you can 
live a life free from discrimination of 
any kind. 
b 2000 
I hope that will be some comfort to 
know that you have a President who 
said right from that rostrum, Madam 
Speaker, to the trans kids: I have your 
back. 
That was the President of the United 
States who is the most powerful person 
on the planet saying to young people 
from our community he has your back. 
So that has to give us a lot of hope of 
what future Pride celebrations will 
mean and the kind of country we live 
in. I thank all my colleagues who par-
ticipated in tonight’s Special Order 
hour. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
f 
NEVER-ENDING FLOOD OF PROB-
LEMS COMING OUT OF PRESI-
DENT BIDEN’S WHITE HOUSE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
MANNING). Under the Speaker’s an-
nounced policy of January 4, 2021, the 
gentleman 
from 
Tennessee 
(Mr. 
BURCHETT) is recognized for 60 minutes 
as the designee of the minority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and include 
extraneous materials on the subject of 
this Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Tennessee? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, 
there are so many issues that are fac-
ing our country right now thanks to 
the disastrous policies coming out of 
the Biden administration. 
Inflation is up 8.6 percent. Econo-
mists are predicting a recession within 
12 months or less. Our energy crisis— 
which is totally preventable—is only 
getting worse. We need to turn our 
spigots back on, Madam Speaker. We 
are relying on foreign adversaries— 
mostly enemies, I feel like most of the 
time—to produce oil instead of turning 
our spigots back on, as I stated. 
The Biden administration is still 
shoving Americans toward electric cars 
which cost on average $60,000. That is 
more than the average Tennessean 
makes in a year. I know for folks living 
in the Beltway that is nothing to them, 
but to the average working American, 
that is a whole heck of a lot of money. 
The environmental problems that these 
cars cause with their batteries and the 
slave labor to produce them in these 
foreign countries that we have no regu-
lations over is despicable, and for any-
body to wrap themselves up around 
that is part of the problem. 
Gas hit $5 per gallon last week—$5. 
People can’t even afford to go to work 
in most areas. President Biden is try-
ing to act like he is doing something 
about it by proposing a 3-month gas 
tax suspension. 
Madam Speaker, that is laughable. 
That is laughable. The way it is rising 
they will save no money. At best it is 
a short-term solution to a long-term 
problem, and at worst it is just an at-
tempt to distract Americans from the 
Biden administration’s refusal to turn 
our oil spigots back on. Also, it would 
leave a $10 billion hole in the highway 
trust fund. 
Also, the baby formula crisis is still 
looming. We have got this problem, and 
the solution that Washington offered 
was to pay more FDA bureaucrats 
more money and not solve the problem. 
The Democratic Party has accused 
the Republicans of some awful things, 
but one of them was that we were 
standing in the way of this when, in 
fact, we voted for the compromise bill, 
but the national media, which is so in 
the tank for this administration, re-
fuses to mention it. 
In closing, I thank all my colleagues 
who are here tonight to call out the 
never-ending flood of problems coming 
out of President Biden’s White House. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Wisconsin 
(Mr. 
GROTHMAN), who is Mr. Positive. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, 
every weekend we go home, and I am 
about to go back to Wisconsin for a 
couple more weeks. When we get back 
home, of course, we always talk to our 
constituents. I would like to address 
my speech tonight to the issue that is 
most on their mind. 
Now, when we go back to Wisconsin 
in June we spend a lot of time on what 
they call breakfast on the farm because 
June is Dairy Promotion Month in Wis-
consin, and with Dairy Promotion 
Month there are breakfasts on the farm 
where you have an opportunity to see 
so many of your constituents. 
When back home, I go through the 
number one and number two issues. 
The number one issue is gasoline infla-
tion. Everybody talks about it. They 
talk about how it is squeezing their 
budget and about how they are not able 
to go on trips as much as they used to. 
They have got to cut back on the type 
of food that they buy. So number one 
would be gas inflation. 
I suppose number two would be food 
inflation because they talk about hav-
ing to buy cuts of meat that aren’t as 
good or other food products that aren’t 
as good as they were before. 
I think probably number three is 
housing inflation. When you look for a 
new house now, Madam Speaker, it 
costs so much more than it did a year 
ago. 
I personally believe there are other 
issues that are as significant and per-
haps in the long term more significant 
for America: 
Are we going to wrap up Ukraine? 
What are we going to do at our bor-
der? 
What are we going to do about the 
over 110,000 people dying of drug 
overdoses every year? 
But, obviously, in my district the 
number one issue is inflation, and I 
want to talk about how we got there. 
How did we get there? 
Any middle school C student should 
know that inflation is caused by exces-
sive government spending which has to 
be covered by the Federal Reserve. 
What are President Biden’s signature 
accomplishments? 
First of all, a $1.9 trillion bill called 
the American Rescue Plan came right

out of the chute. His second biggest ac-
complishment was a $1.2 trillion infra-
structure bill. These bills were in addi-
tion to a regular appropriation bill 
with excessive spending. 
What would happen was as predict-
able as night following day. Multiple 
Republicans, including myself, warned 
last January and February against out- 
of-control inflation. Larry Summers, 
Barack Obama’s director of the Na-
tional Economic Council, called this 
bill the worst economic policy in the 
last 20 years. But whatever Larry Sum-
mers said was ignored as, sadly, the 
majority party charged again, spending 
$1.9 trillion that America did not have. 
So now we are told we have the worst 
inflation in 40 years at 8.3 percent. 
Don’t believe that 8.3 number. It is 
much worse than that. It always both-
ers me when people say that we have 
such a problem at 8.3 percent inflation. 
It is just so much more. Changes to in-
flation calculation over the years have 
grossly underestimated the real num-
ber. 
I am going to lead off with housing. 
When I look at housing, I talk to build-
ers, I talk to landlords, and I talk to 
real estate brokers. Housing is listed at 
a 5.5 percent increase in the last year. 
Ask any of these people if rents or new 
construction have gone up only 5.5 per-
cent in the last year, and they will 
laugh at you. 
Madam Speaker, 5.5 percent is what 
the government is telling people it is 
at. When I talk to builders, they tell 
me that a new house this year could 
cost 30 percent more than what that 
same house was going last year, and 
rents are clearly well over the 5.5 per-
cent figure as well. 
But government, for whatever rea-
son, does not use the cost of new con-
struction. They use what they refer to 
as the rental value of your new house, 
which is a much lower number. 
I have a graph here showing the dif-
ference between the actual rent and 
the CPI rent, and you can see here, 
Madam Speaker, that there is about a 
15 percent gap and that the actual rent 
has gone up about 15 percent more than 
the so-called CPI number which has 
gone up as well. So that is one of the 
reasons why I think Americans feel 
that they are in worse shape than only 
an 8.6 inflation. That is true. 
I also want to point out that these 
numbers are only updated once every 6 
months. That is one of the problems. 
Although another problem we have is 
when they talk about the cost of hous-
ing, which usually would mean buying 
a house. They do not take into account 
the cost of interest on a mortgage, for 
whatever reason. In the last year, in-
terest rates have gone up again prob-
ably because of the inflation, the inter-
est cost on a 30-year fixed mortgage 
has gone up 39 percent—a 39 percent in-
crease in interest payments on the 
house, assuming the cost of the house 
hasn’t gone up at all. 
But is that in the equation? 
No. When we calculate inflation we 
do not take into account the massively 
higher interest rates that you have to 
pay now compared to the past. 
By the way, as we look at things like 
housing, I beg the press corps to do a 
little bit of research. Don’t just report 
this 8.3 percent number. You have the 
ability to talk to the brokers, to talk 
to the grocers, and to talk to the car 
dealers and find out what an appro-
priate number is. Back in the good old 
days when reporters were a little bit 
harder working, they would have done 
their own research and found out what 
the real inflation rate is. 
Now, the next thing I am going to 
look at is used cars. On the official 
numbers they claim that used cars or 
the cost of having a used car has gone 
up about 16 percent. I have talked to a 
variety of car dealers from various dif-
ferent places in my diverse district. Ev-
erybody laughs at the idea that used 
cars have only gone up 16.1 percent. 
They all insist 30 percent on minimum. 
So here is another number that is 
thrown out to calculate that 8.6 num-
ber the government claims, and they 
are just way off on the cost of a new 
car. 
If you buy a new car, Madam Speak-
er, of course, interest rates are going 
up as well which further increases 
things. 
In any event, the point I am trying to 
make is that the amount of inflation is 
well over that 8.6 percent. It is cer-
tainly double digits over that when you 
talk about housing and double digits 
over that when you talk about used 
cars. 
Subjectively talking to people who 
do the grocery shopping for the family, 
they believe that when they go through 
the checkout their costs are up way 
more than a few percentage points and 
the 10 percentage points that the Fed-
eral Government claims food at home 
has gone up the last year. 
I beg the American people to demand 
action on inflation. I am trying to edu-
cate the American people that that ac-
tion will inevitably have to mean 
undoing the out-of-control spending 
that took place around here in January 
or February. As we do it, we are going 
to have to reduce the amount of gov-
ernment. But I don’t think we can go 
on with these housing prices and these 
car prices for the rest of our lives. 
Madam Speaker, we want to get back 
to the days in which a young couple 
had a chance of affording a house. We 
want to go back to the days when you 
can eat like Americans are used to eat-
ing, not where you have to deal with 
inferior foods just because you can’t af-
ford it anymore. We want to go back to 
the days in which you can buy the type 
of car that you would like to buy. 
So I encourage my colleagues this 
year, if possible, but if not then next 
year—maybe we are going to have to 
wait 3 years for some of this—we have 
got to get the spending back down 
where it was when you could live life in 
America like Americans are used to. 
I beg the other side, when it comes to 
passing the new budget and preparing 
for the appropriation bills that are 
going to pass for the calendar year be-
ginning October 1, let’s stop spending 
so much money. 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Mr. GROTHMAN for his remarks. 
As I have stated many times since I 
learned it when I first came up here, 
there are three really great things that 
come out of Wisconsin. One is Harley- 
Davidson, two is cheese, and the other 
is GLENN GROTHMAN. 
Mr. 
GROTHMAN. 
Now 
buy 
that 
cheese. Remember that June is Dairy 
Month. 
Mr. BURCHETT. Next, we have pos-
sibly the only rice farmer that I know 
in Congress and that I probably ever 
will know, and that is my good friend, 
DOUG LAMALFA, from the great State 
of California’s First District. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. LAMALFA). 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate my colleague from Ten-
nessee with that very warm introduc-
tion and allusion to the fact that we do 
produce food in California when we are 
given the water that we already own to 
do so, but that is a little different sup-
ply chain discussion that we could be 
having tonight. 
b 2015 
I want to focus this evening on the 
border situation that is unnecessarily 
wide open. It doesn’t have to be this 
way. It is just inattention to enforcing 
the laws and doing the things you 
would normally do to maintain a bor-
der. 
We have millions of dollars’ worth of 
steel fence material laying in piles 
down there next to the border that 
could be used to fill some obvious gaps 
that would make it so much easier for 
Customs and Border Patrol to do their 
jobs that they would like to do. 
Morale down there, of course, is real-
ly bad amongst our officers, just for in-
ability to do their job effectively, and 
not being supported by this Federal 
Government and this administration. 
And also, the wild accusations that 
those that are mounted on horseback 
using their reins in order to move their 
horses about and steer them where 
they want to go, somehow they have 
been accused of using those as whips 
upon illegal immigrants coming across 
the border; all part of just a bunch of 
hype and misinformation put out by 
the administration, by the media, to 
make a narrative on the border that is 
completely false and vastly unproduc-
tive for the American people, as we see 
so much fentanyl coming across, so 
much illegal activity. 
And also, since the Biden administra-
tion took over, at least 50 individuals 
that we know about on the terrorism 
watch list have been caught red-hand-
ed, trying to sneak across our border to 
do God knows what in cells inside this 
country. 
So you really do have to commend 
the Border Patrol, what they are able 
to get done on finding these 50, and

saving the countless lives they do, 
whether it is preventing terrorism, 
catching these drugs that are coming 
across and just, in general, at least try-
ing to slow the tide coming in here ille-
gally and affecting so much of our soci-
ety. 
But we have to wonder with the near-
ly 3 million illegal border crossings in 
Biden’s term, how many dangerous in-
dividuals did get away or sneaking 
through—the getaways are what we are 
talking a lot about these days because 
we have no way to put a number on 
that. They affect our whole society, 
our whole system of social programs, 
crime, everything else. They don’t 
seem to be interested in this adminis-
tration of getting a handle on that. 
They have taken away, of course, our 
demoralized border agents’ resources to 
be able to keep the border as safe as it 
could be, cutting them back and giving 
them—reassigning 
their 
mission, 
repurposing is a common word around 
here. So instead of doing that job of en-
forcing the border, they are basically 
running a welcome wagon operation, 
transporting illegal immigrants to be 
processed and turned right into the 
country. 
Hopefully, they will show up within a 
couple of years for the massive backlog 
of court hearings they would have on 
their status, whether they actually de-
serve asylum or not, which isn’t really 
the case. Probably 80 or 90 percent of 
them are here for economic relief, eco-
nomic opportunity in our great coun-
try. 
So what do we have? The Biden ad-
ministration, having halted construc-
tion, and then some of the other meth-
ods with which we can somewhat con-
trol this tide at the border. They are 
working really hard at trying to roll 
back title 42, which is one of the best 
resources 
that 
the 
Border 
Patrol 
agents have to quickly expel those who 
are coming here illegally from certain 
countries. 
Their 
soft-on-crime 
policies 
have 
incentivized millions of illegals to con-
tinue to cross into our country, know-
ing that even if they are caught, they 
can just skip their court date to stay 
here because the backlog might be too 
long, or because the cell phone they 
got handed at the border they can’t be 
reached at. That is supposed to be our 
way of keeping track of them, by hand-
ing them a cell phone. 
So, with a caravan of 15,000 waiting 
on title 42 to come across, we have got 
a giant problem that makes our core 
personnel at the border powerless to 
stop it. 
We have seen the pictures. I have 
been there myself on a trip to Yuma, 
and it is devastating. It is devastating 
for the morale of the people on the bor-
ders, the cities, the economies there, 
Border Patrol themselves. 
So instead of giving the border 
agents the tools they need, the FBI and 
Department of Homeland Security are 
making up fake, dangerous scenarios 
all over the country. 
Instead, the FBI is going after con-
cerned parents at school board meet-
ings speaking out over some of the 
filth that is being taught and put into 
our schools. They are trying to label 
them as domestic terrorists. 
Then 
they 
push 
legislation 
that 
would go after our servicemembers and 
law enforcement personnel for various 
things that they get accused of while 
doing their jobs, if they are not being 
defunded to begin with. 
So even though our data shows that 
servicemembers and law enforcement 
personnel are more likely to be a vic-
tim of terrorism, they are getting ac-
cused of being terrorists themselves. 
FBI and Department of Homeland Se-
curity must start focusing their efforts 
at the southern border instead of po-
liticizing law enforcement officers and 
concerned parents at school board 
meetings. 
Everything is backwards with the 
way this administration is handling 
the issue at our border, energy, the 
food shortages that are pending be-
cause we are not prioritizing the basic 
building blocks that make a society 
strong, the economy strong, families 
strong, and America strong. 
We have got a lot of work to do to 
educate the public. Maybe it will take 
the midterm election to turn it around. 
I wish the people that were operating 
the government would put America 
first instead of some crazy agenda on 
the Green New Deal or globalism. 
So I appreciate the time here to-
night. I thank my colleague from Ten-
nessee for running this for us and al-
lowing us to continue to speak out and 
put the truth out there in front of the 
American people. 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from my home 
State, Tennessee (Mr. ROSE). 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding tonight. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to ad-
dress another devastating record set on 
President Biden’s watch, this time 
along our southern border. Numbers re-
leased last week from U.S. Customs 
and Border Protection tell us there 
were more migrant encounters in May 
of this year than any month on record. 
May was also the fourth straight 
month of encounters reaching more 
than 200,000. 
Here are the numbers: 239,416 total 
encounters. That is up 32 percent from 
May of last year, and nearly 10 times 
the number of encounters during the 
same month in 2020. Twenty-five per-
cent of migrants were repeat offenders, 
meaning they have been deported or ar-
rested before. Agents also reported 20 
percent more unaccompanied minors 
crossing the border compared to just 
April of this year. 
This continues to be a national secu-
rity and humanitarian crisis, and it is 
only getting worse. 
And if you can believe it, the num-
bers could actually be much worse. Had 
it not been for a Federal judge delaying 
the Biden administration’s plan to end 
title 42, who knows how many people 
would have crossed into our country il-
legally? 
Title 42 is a critical tool for our al-
ready 
overwhelmed 
Border 
Patrol 
agents. Yet, the Biden Justice Depart-
ment continues to fight for the admin-
istration’s dangerous, reckless, open 
border 
policies 
by 
appealing 
that 
judge’s decision. 
Since President Biden took office, 
more than 700,000 people have avoided 
law enforcement and made their way 
into our country. We really don’t know 
who these people are. Agents stopped 
at least 50 people on the terrorist 
screening database in just a 9-month 
period. 
This begs the questions: Out of those 
who evaded law enforcement, those 
700,000, how many could potentially be 
on the terrorist watch list? 
Where are those people? 
What are their intentions? 
How will they impact the lives of 
American citizens? 
Republicans may sound like a broken 
record when it comes to the border, but 
we wouldn’t have to talk about it so 
much if it were not for the broken poli-
cies of President Biden and his DHS 
Secretary 
Mayorkas. 
They 
simply 
must do better. 
Mr. 
BURCHETT. 
They 
definitely 
need to do better. 
Madam Speaker, if it wasn’t for the 
great 
State 
of 
Tennessee 
there 
wouldn’t be a great State of Texas. I 
yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
BABIN), one of the great ones. 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for giving us this oppor-
tunity. 
We have heard a lot of hypocrisy 
from President Biden and the Demo-
crats about oil and gas, about our fossil 
fuel industry. 
We have heard them say that they 
are going to ‘‘end fossil fuels, period;’’ 
that the oil and gas industry should no 
longer have the ability to even drill to 
explore; that the only way to save the 
coral reefs and the glaciers is to end 
fossil fuels, and that millions of people 
are dying every year because of fossil 
fuels. 
And even though my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle weren’t jok-
ing, it is hard not to laugh at this ab-
surdity. 
Who is buying this baloney? 
Who is so blinded by the left and 
their climate change delusion that 
they can’t see the hypocrisy in all of 
this? 
If the Democrats got their way, if 
they really did shutdown the fossil fuel 
industry, do they actually understand 
the real-life ramifications of that dras-
tic action? 
What do you think the Democrats 
think fuels our construction equip-
ment, our trucks, our buses, tractors, 
boats, and trains? 
How would they spend their recent 
trillion-dollar infrastructure package 
without diesel fuel? 
If Joe Biden keeps his promise to end 
fossil fuels, life will certainly become

June 22, 2022 
awfully challenging for many of us in 
the 21st century since laptops, tablets, 
and credit cards, will no longer be 
available. 
Imagine how Joe Biden’s constitu-
ents would have felt in 2012 after Hurri-
cane Sandy raged up through Delaware 
if they couldn’t have gotten their 
hands 
on 
gasoline-powered 
electric 
generators? 
Yes, my friends, those generators 
provided power, thanks to none other 
than fossil fuels and their industry. 
And as if the baby formula shortage 
isn’t bad enough already, let’s take 
away their pacifiers too, yet another 
product of fossil fuels. 
The hypocrisy is astounding. Hon-
estly, Joe Biden should be thanking 
the fossil fuel industry for protecting 
him. Thanks to his helmet, brought to 
us by fossil fuels, he was shielded from 
his fall off that bicycle last week; not 
to mention the petroleum-made as-
phalt that padded his fall and, frankly, 
even the bicycle itself. 
And while this administration tells 
suffering Americans to just simply buy 
Teslas and other electric vehicles, they 
are conveniently failing to mention 
that fossil fuels make brake fluid, turn 
signals, tires. And, in fact, they supply 
the very power that charges our elec-
tric vehicles. 
Everything from pens to dog toys, 
sunglasses to the soles of our shoes, we 
still very much need the oil and gas in-
dustry. We are dependent on it, folks. 
But if my Democrat colleagues would 
like to ban leather briefcases and patio 
furniture, candles, headsets, and cell 
phones in the name of climate change, 
then good luck. You will only further 
cripple our economy and destroy many 
everyday necessities that you seem to 
take for granted. 
Oh, don’t forget that petrochemicals 
also are used to make painkillers, anti-
histamines, antibiotics, antibacterials, 
cough syrups, creams, and ointments. 
They are also used in heart valves and 
other critical lifesaving medical equip-
ment like radiological dyes and films, 
intravenous tubing, syringes and oxy-
gen masks. 
I would recommend my Democrat 
colleagues do a little more homework 
before they foolishly make enemies of 
an industry that is involved in literally 
every single aspect of our lives. 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, I 
was always amazed in my hometown, 
as a young man, I would watch people 
protesting out in front of a fur shop, 
and they had leather-soled shoes on. I 
always wondered if those cows died of 
natural causes. 
Madam Speaker, next we have the 
man from a little town down in Flor-
ida, Jacksonville, Florida, home of the 
greatest rock and roll band of all time, 
Lynyrd Skynyrd. There is no other. I 
appreciate Mr. JOHN RUTHERFORD being 
here with us today, former sheriff, all 
around good guy. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. RUTHER-
FORD). 
b 2030 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker, 
I thank my good friend from Tennessee 
for this opportunity. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to dis-
cuss the historic inflation and soaring 
gas prices that are hurting American 
families all across America. 
You know, as my good friend from 
Wisconsin was saying earlier, he talked 
about the 8.6 percent inflation rate and 
how that doesn’t seem to jive with the 
American public. It just doesn’t seem 
like it could possibly be 8.6 percent. 
My good friend talked about the in-
flation rate in the building industry. 
We are just going to talk a little bit 
about gas, for example, 106.7 percent; 
butter, margarine, 20.2 percent up; 
milk, up 15.9 percent; pork up 13.3 per-
cent. 
How in the world can the official in-
flation rate actually be 8.6 percent? It 
doesn’t make sense, Mr. BURCHETT. It 
doesn’t make sense, and every Amer-
ican out there knows it. 
I am here to tell you that the sky- 
high prices that we see at stores and at 
the pump are, in large part, thanks to 
Democrats’ planned policies to force 
the U.S. off of fossil fuels. 
On President Biden’s first day in of-
fice, he ended the XL Pipeline, the 
Keystone XL Pipeline, suspended drill-
ing permits, and froze oil and gas 
leases on public lands. The Biden ad-
ministration successfully brought do-
mestic energy production to a halt. 
Just 19 months ago, if you can re-
member, America was energy inde-
pendent: $2.30-odd cents a gallon. Since 
then, we have seen gas more than dou-
ble in price. 
Now, with the volatility in inter-
national oil markets caused by Rus-
sia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, 
it is past time for the United States to 
bolster again our energy independence. 
Yet, instead of turning to our domes-
tic suppliers of oil and gas, the Biden 
administration has turned to corrupt 
regimes like Venezuela, or they have 
gone to Saudi Arabia, or they are 
going. 
Americans across the country are 
struggling to fuel their cars and power 
their homes and businesses. Recent re-
ports show that the average household 
is going to spend $5,000 more on gas 
this year. 
That is $5,000 that won’t go into ris-
ing grocery bills and other costs of liv-
ing increases, and we will call it 8.6 
percent inflation, but we know it is 
more. 
The only way to alleviate the pres-
sure Americans feel at the gas pump is 
to refocus our efforts on rebuilding 
America’s energy independence. 
That is why I am a proud cosponsor 
of H.R. 6858, the American Energy 
Independence from Russia Act. This 
bill would restart the Keystone XL 
pipeline, expand natural gas exports to 
our allies abroad, and restart oil and 
gas production right here in the United 
States. 
Passing this bill is a crucial step in 
both reducing the price of gas and 
strengthening our economy. It is time 
for the Biden administration to take 
responsibility for this crisis, rein in 
spending, and take action to increase 
Americans’ energy independence. 
This incredible transition, as the 
President called it, has destroyed the 
very economy that had the potential to 
create the capital that was necessary 
and will be necessary, the capital that 
we could use to transition from fossil 
fuels to renewable energy in a smooth 
and seamless process. 
That would have given us the capital 
for the conservation, the innovation, 
the adaptability, but all of that is 
gone. 
I ask the President to return us to 
American energy independence and let 
loose America’s industrial might. 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman. 
Mr. RUTHERFORD, I appreciate you. I 
appreciate Jacksonville, Florida, and 
the influence it has had on this coun-
try and your influence on us and your 
service as a sheriff and a man of law 
and order and a man of conviction. I 
appreciate that. 
One thing you talked about was tak-
ing responsibility. This administration 
has refused to take responsibility. Al-
though when President Biden was de-
bating BERNIE SANDERS when he was 
running for office, he did not say any-
thing worthwhile, I thought. He didn’t 
say anything like give me liberty or 
give me death or anything like that, 
but he did say that he was going to 
raise gas prices, and he said he was 
going to do that and put the oil indus-
try out of business and get people on 
electric cars. 
Well, he is halfway there. He has just 
about put the oil industry out because 
of the rising prices and the way it is 
controllable. He refuses to take the re-
sponsibility for that. 
Now we are overseas doing business, 
trying to do business with folks that 
we have not really been on friendly 
terms with, for good reason, their in-
volvement in September 11 and other 
things. 
Yet, we still are back over with our 
hands out to the members of OPEC. 
That is very unfortunate. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to 
my good friend, MADISON CAWTHORN, 
the pride of the Carolinas. 
Thank you, sir. 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend. 
I believe that you should one day be 
Governor of the great State of Ten-
nessee, my friend, in your Carhartt 
jacket. That would be great. 
Madam Speaker, our founders were 
clear. The Second Amendment was de-
signed as the backbone upon which in-
dividual rights and liberties could be 
secured. 
Efforts by the ruling class in our gov-
ernment are aimed at crippling this 
Nation and corroding our Republic. 
It is true, red flag laws sound benign 
on paper. Flagging dangerous individ-
uals and keeping them from weaponry

June 22, 2022 
seems like a cut-and-dry issue; but a 
cursory glance at the actions of our 
overreaching 
Federal 
Government 
clearly show that these laws are ripe 
for Federal abuse of your rights and 
mine. 
Make no mistake, red flag laws will 
be used to flag those who vote for free-
dom, strip them of their right to self- 
defense, and empower faceless bureau-
crats to dole out or to not dole out the 
right of self-defense to a downtrodden 
and oppressed class of citizens. 
They will be weaponized to demonize 
and destroy political dissidents in this 
country. If you vote against the re-
gime, you may be stripped of your 
rights. If you refuse the medical deci-
sions pushed by POTUS and the re-
gime, you may be stripped of your 
rights. 
If you raise your children to adhere 
to Proverbs and push-ups instead of 
POTUS, you may be stripped of your 
rights. 
To the American people, I say this: It 
is not a right if you have to ask per-
mission to exercise it. We are very near 
this government becoming the exact 
reason our founders designed the Con-
stitution to hold back a tyrannical 
government. 
The Second Amendment was not de-
signed to hunt deer, but to defend 
against liberty and invasion. 
Again, red flag laws sound benign. We 
all want to keep weapons out of the 
hands of dangerous people, but remem-
ber that this government, the CDC, has 
labeled you a national security prob-
lem for protecting your health. 
The FBI, last September, has called 
your mothers and wives domestic ter-
rorists for protecting your children. 
Now, just days ago, a committee here 
on Capitol Hill has labeled half the 
country as coup sympathetic. 
The same faceless fact-checkers who 
sensor your speech will seize your sov-
ereignty. And trust me, they won’t 
come to your front door with a clip-
board and a smile. 
These liberal lackeys will show up 
before dawn and invade your home, 
seize your property, and smash any 
concept of individual liberty you may 
possess. Remember the actions the rul-
ing elite took against those at Waco 
and Ruby Ridge. 
We must wake up. We cannot trust 
this government. We must not give 
them more legal avenues to turn their 
national security apparatus against 
those who they swore to defend. 
Mr. BURCHETT. Thank you, Mr. 
CAWTHORN. 
Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure 
being here with you all. I know my 
wife is watching this and probably 
wants to get to the Mexican restaurant 
right now, and so I will cut this really 
short, Madam Speaker. 
Thank you for your indulgence to-
night. It has been a real pleasure. 
I say thank you to the leadership for 
whoever canceled out at the last 
minute and allowed me to be up here 
and do this. It has been very enjoyable. 
It is the first in my life and maybe a 
last. I thank all the young folks back 
there who work very hard to make our 
lives a lot easier. 
Madam Speaker, I would go on a ti-
rade right now, but I believe I will just 
let it go. You probably want to go 
home after a long day as well, so you 
can just say you owe me one. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

BIPARTISAN SAFER COMMUNITIES ACT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, on the 
issue of our actions last night, yester-
day, Democratic and Republican nego-
tiators at long last released what the 
Nation has been waiting for for a very 
long time—a gun safety bill that can be 
described with three words: common 
sense, bipartisan, lifesaving. 
As the author of the Brady back-
ground checks bill—the last major gun 
safety bill, which passed in 1994—I am 
pleased Congress is on the path to take 
meaningful action to address gun vio-
lence for the first time in nearly 30 
years. The bill is real progress. It will 
save lives. It is my intention to make 
sure the Senate passes this bill before 
the end of the week. 
Last night, the process to quickly 
pass gun safety legislation formally

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3046 
June 22, 2022 
began here on the floor after 64 Sen-
ators agreed to get on the bill. Let me 
emphasize that number again. Sixty- 
four Members came together last night 
to 
move 
forward—an 
unmistakable 
sign of the broad support and momen-
tum behind this bill. That is good news 
for American families and American 
communities that have waited for 
years to see real progress against gun 
violence. 
Once again, it is my intention now to 
keep the process moving quickly and 
secure final passage before the week’s 
end. 
A little over a month ago, our Nation 
witnessed two of the most traumatic 
mass shootings seen in years: a racially 
motivated attack in Buffalo and the 
worst school shooting in years in 
Uvalde, TX. 
After these shootings, the Senate had 
a choice: We could succumb to gridlock 
and hold a vote on a bill with many 
things we would want but that had no 
hope of getting passed or we could try 
to find a bipartisan path forward, as 
difficult as it seemed to get anything 
done. Over the past 4 weeks, we chose 
to try to get something done. 
Immediately after Uvalde, I spoke 
with Senator MURPHY, who has been 
our leader on these issues, and he 
asked me to give negotiators time and 
space to do their work. Given his long 
experience in this area, he thought 
that they could succeed. I was happy to 
agree because I knew that even if there 
was a chance to get something positive 
and tangible done on gun safety, it was 
well worth the effort. So I told Senator 
MURPHY I would give him the space he 
needed. 
That quickly became the consensus 
of our caucus and the consensus of 
many of our gun safety advocates, who 
pressed us to secure real progress. We 
were all on the same page: Get some-
thing real done even if it might not be 
everything we wanted. 
This proved to be the right decision 
because today we are only a few days 
away from passing the first major gun 
safety bill in nearly 30 years. 
I want to thank all my Democratic 
and Republican colleagues for working 
together to reach this point. I want to 
particularly thank Senators MURPHY 
and SINEMA and all my Democratic col-
leagues who were part of the bipartisan 
working group. And, of course, I also 
want 
to 
thank 
Senators 
CORNYN, 
TILLIS, and my Republican colleagues 
who made the decision to tackle this 
difficult issue. 
Most important of all, I want to 
thank all the survivors of gun violence, 
all the families and advocates who 
dedicated years of their lives to try to 
make a difference. This would not be 
possible without their years of work. 
No matter how many mass shootings 
have been met with gridlock over the 
years, these families never gave up on 
their hopes of making change happen. 
As I have told them, rather than curse 
the darkness, they lit a candle. They 
have turned their grief into action, and 
now their action has brought us to the 
brink of passing the first significant 
gun safety bill in decades. 
The negotiators have done their 
work. Now it is time for the Senate to 
complete the job and pass the bill be-
fore the end of the week. The American 
people have waited long enough. 
INSULIN ACT 
Mr. President, now on an insulin bill, 
another bit of good news, a bright 
light. Earlier this morning, my col-
leagues Senators SHAHEEN and COLLINS 
released legislation taking direct aim 
at one of the most confounding prob-
lems facing millions of Americans: the 
skyrocketing cost of insulin. 
After months of hard work and good- 
faith negotiations, the efforts of my 
colleagues Senators SHAHEEN and COL-
LINS have produced the INSULIN Act. 
This bipartisan bill will cap insulin at 
$35 a month, change the system that 
favors corporations instead of patients 
by keeping prices high, and help lower 
costs for millions of Americans with di-
abetes. It is my intention to bring the 
INSULIN Act to the floor of the Senate 
very soon, and it ought to pass this 
Chamber expeditiously. 
Reducing the price of insulin is not a 
Democratic 
issue 
or 
a 
Republican 
issue; it is something that affects mil-
lions of Americans in every city and 
every State. In fact, State legislatures 
across the country have passed bills 
capping the cost of insulin for pa-
tients—not just blue States but some 
deeply red States as well. 
Senators SHAHEEN and COLLINS ap-
proached me earlier in the year and 
said they wanted to draft a bill that 
not only capped insulin prices at $35, 
but, in addition, they said they also 
wanted to have a bill that goes deeper 
and goes to the depth of the problem, 
to change the system of high prices 
that puts profits ahead of patients and 
lower the cost for millions of Ameri-
cans with diabetes. I agreed that would 
be preferable. I encouraged them. And 
after a lot of work—hard work, diligent 
work—they have written a very fine 
bill. 
Now, it is time for Congress to get 
the job done. If we can pass this bill, it 
will be a win for everyone—most of all, 
the millions and millions of Americans 
who rely on insulin to manage their di-
abetes. 
There is no time to waste because the 
surge of insulin costs is one of the most 
infuriating trends of the past decade. 
For many people, the cost of insulin 
can climb up to hundreds of dollars a 
month, sometimes as much as $400 or 
even more. It is horrible and infuri-
ating. 
Skyrocketing insulin costs means 
that many Americans have to ask some 
soul-wrenching questions: Do I pay for 
my groceries, or do I pay for my medi-
cation? Do I have to ration my supply 
and take maybe half the dosage each 
day—which we know hastens the onset 
of diabetes and hastens the virulence of 
diabetes; or some ask: Will I have to 
skip my medication altogether? 
These are questions no American 
should have to ever ask, but this is the 
reality for far too many in this coun-
try. No American should have to go 
broke just to access the medicines they 
need to stay alive. So that is why the 
Senate should make the INSULIN Act 
a priority in the coming months. 
Again, I want to thank Senators SHA-
HEEN and COLLINS for all their hard 
work in bringing this bill together. 
This has been a passion of both of 
theirs for a very long time. It has been 
a priority for many of us in this Cham-
ber for years, and to have a bipartisan 
bill like this one is truly a break-
through. 
Very soon, I intend to have this bill 
come before the Senate so we can take 
decisive, much-needed steps toward 
lowering the cost of insulin for mil-
lions who need this drug to stay alive. 
NOMINATION OF ARIANNA J. FREEMAN 
Mr. President, finally on judicial 
nominees: As we continue moving for-
ward on the first major gun bill in dec-
ades, the Senate will also proceed with 
confirming even more of President 
Biden’s highly qualified judicial nomi-
nees. Later today, the Senate will 
move forward on the historic nomina-
tion of Arianna Freeman to serve as 
circuit judge for the Third Circuit. 
Ms. Freeman would make history as 
the first Black woman ever to preside 
as an appellate judge on the Third Cir-
cuit, which is home to more than 3 mil-
lion African Americans in the North-
east and the Virgin Islands, but which 
has had only five African-American 
judges in its entire history. 
Her confirmation would be a long 
overdue step toward a more representa-
tive bench that is vital for the health 
of democracy. 
And her qualifications—Yale Law 
School, clerkships for three Federal 
judges, and extensive experience as a 
Federal defender—should erase any 
doubt that she merits appointment to 
the bench. Normally, a nominee with 
Ms. Freeman’s resume should com-
mand strong bipartisan support, so it 
was deeply regrettable that her nomi-
nation was locked in committee with 
an 11-to-11 vote. Nevertheless, we are 
proceeding with her nomination today. 
I have just moved to discharge her 
nomination out of the Judiciary Com-
mittee so we can bring her to a vote on 
the floor. 
Again, a simple look at her resume 
shows she has the skills. We know she 
has the temperament and experience to 
make an excellent judge. And despite 
delays, the Senate is going to move her 
one step closer to confirmation today. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The

The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

RECOGNITION OF MINORITY LEADER 
The Republican leader is recognized. 
BIPARTISAN SAFER COMMUNITIES ACT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Yesterday, the 
Senate took a big step toward an im-
portant bipartisan bill to prevent mass 
murders, make schools safer, and pro-
tect the Second Amendment rights of 
law-abiding citizens. The bipartisan 
group, led by Senator CORNYN, put to-
gether a package of commonsense and 
popular solutions to make these hor-
rific incidents less likely, and it does 
not so much as touch the rights of the 
overwhelming majority of American 
gun owners who are law-abiding citi-
zens of sound mind. 
I have spent my career supporting, 
defending, and expanding law-abiding 
citizens’ Second Amendment rights. 
The right to bear arms, the right to de-
fend one’s self and one’s family is a 
core civil liberty. Among other things, 
Senate Republicans spent years con-
firming a generation of Federal judges 
who understand that the Constitution 
and the Bill of Rights actually mean 
what they say. 
The American people know that we 
don’t have to choose between safer 
schools and our constitutional rights. 
Our country can and should have both. 
But 
throughout 
recent 
years, 
our 
Democratic colleagues have indicated 
they were not interested in substantial 
legislation to create safer communities 
if they didn’t get to take massive bites 
out of the Second Amendment in the 
process. There have been attempts at 
bipartisan talks after horrible inci-
dents in the past, but they fell apart 
when Democrats did not sign on to 
anything—anything—that did not roll 
back the Bill of Rights for law-abiding 
Americans. 
Well, this time is different. This 
time, Democrats came our way and 
agreed to advance some commonsense 
solutions without rolling back rights 
to law-abiding citizens. The result is a 
product that I am proud to support. It 
will send more direct funding to com-
munity behavioral health centers and 
for mental health in schools. It will 
send money not just to States that de-
cide to implement so-called red flag 
laws, but to every State to fund crisis 
intervention programs of their own 
choosing. And States that do not use 
the money for red flag laws will have 
to build in new due-process protections 
that have never been required before. 
The bill also removes the blinders 
that have prevented the NICS back-
ground check system from considering 
young people with preexisting juvenile 
records. If a young teenager has been 
convicted of a violent crime or institu-
tionalized for mental illness, there is 
no reason why that important record 
should be magically wiped away on 
their 18th birthday for the purpose of 
buying weapons. That information is 
clearly relevant, and 87 percent of 
Americans agree. 
To be clear, this legislation has no 
new restrictions, bans, waiting periods, 
or mandates for law-abiding gun own-
ers of any age—no new restrictions, 
bans, waiting periods or mandates for 
law-abiding citizens of any age, includ-
ing those aged 18 to 21. Someone who 
has never been convicted of a violent 
crime or adjudicated as mentally ill 
will not have their rights affected one 
iota. And a whole lot of schools and 
communities will receive more mental 
health funding to prevent crisis situa-
tions before they develop. 
JUDICIAL SECURITY 
Mr. President, now on a related mat-
ter, speaking of safer communities, it 
would be nice if Attorney General Gar-
land and the Department of Justice 
could do their jobs and enforce the Fed-
eral laws that Congress actually al-
ready has on the books. 
For example, it is currently—right 
now—illegal to join a mob protesting 
outside the private family home of a 
Federal 
judge, 
including 
Supreme 
Court Justices. It is illegal right now 
to try to replace the rule of law with 
harassment and intimidation. What 
has been going on outside Justices’ 
homes for weeks now is a Federal 
crime right now. But you wouldn’t 
know it from the Justice Department’s 
inaction. 
First, the most prominent Democrats 
in America fan dangerous flames with 
intemperate rhetoric about the Court. 
Then House Democrats blockade a non-
controversial Supreme Court security 
bill for weeks—weeks—until a literal 
assassination plot came to light. And 
all the while, Attorney General Gar-
land still refuses to enforce existing 
Federal law and put a stop to these il-
legal pressure campaigns. 
As Washington Democrats continue 
to stage hearings about political vio-
lence that took place a year and a half 
ago, their own side of the aisle is en-
gaging in ongoing political violence as 
we speak. 
In recent weeks, the entire country 
has been swept with vandalism, arson, 
and attacks directed at churches, pro- 
life organizations, and crisis pregnancy 
centers that serve and help women— 
going on all across the country. By one 
count, there have been more than four 
dozen incidents of vandalism, harass-
ment, or violence committed by pro- 
abortion advocates since the shameful 
leak of a Supreme Court draft opinion. 
The Department of Justice will not 
even condemn or stop illegal intimida-
tion mobs today, leading to ask: Are 
they really prepared to protect the 
safety and civil rights of American 
citizens after the Court issues high- 
profile rulings? 
Are local authorities here in Wash-
ington and around the country ready 
for what one far-left group is promising 
will be ‘‘a night of rage’’—‘‘a night of 
rage’’? 
Well, they had better be. I under-
stand, yesterday, Attorney General 
Garland caught a flight to Ukraine. 
Now, I certainly support our efforts in 
Ukraine and was proud to meet with 
President Zelenskyy myself a month 
ago. As a U.S. Senator, I work directly 
on foreign policy, but our head of do-
mestic law enforcement ought to be a 
little more concerned with his day job. 
GAS TAX HOLIDAY 
Now, Mr. President, on one final mat-
ter, this morning, the Biden adminis-
tration announced another ineffective 
stunt to mask the effects of Demo-
crats’ war on affordable American en-
ergy: calling for a holiday on the Fed-
eral gas tax. 
This ineffective stunt will join Presi-
dent Biden’s other ineffective stunt on 
gas prices: emptying out the Strategic 
Petroleum Reserve that we need in the 
event of a true national security crisis, 
not just a Democratic-fueled inflation 
crisis. This ineffective administration’s 
big, new idea is a silly proposal that 
senior members of their own party 
have already shot down well in ad-
vance. 
Earlier this year, Speaker PELOSI 
said President Biden’s idea ‘‘[wouldn’t] 
even [be] going to the consumers.’’ She 
called it ‘‘very showbiz.’’ 
Larry Summers, a top economist to 
multiple Democratic Presidents, said 
the idea would be ‘‘shortsighted, inef-
fective, goofy, and gimmicky.’’ That is 
Larry Summers. 
Jason Furman, President Obama’s 
former head of the Council of Eco-
nomic Advisers, said just yesterday— 
yesterday: 
Whatever you thought of the merits of a 
gas tax holiday in February, it is a worse 
idea now . . . A gas tax holiday would also 
add to inflation. 
Jason Furman, yesterday. 
Back in 2008, then-Candidate Obama 
called the idea ‘‘a gimmick [that 
would] save you half a tank of gas over 
the course of the entire summer so 
that everyone in Washington can pat 
themselves on the back and say they 
did something.’’ 
Look, a recent study of past gas tax 
holidays found that less than 20 per-
cent of the amount ends up actually 
lowering prices at the pump. In other 
words, lifting an 18.4-cent gas tax 
would mean lowering Americans’ gas 
prices by just 3 or 4 cents—3 or 4 cents. 
The price of gas has risen $2.60 since 
the Biden administration took office 
and launched its holy war on affordable 
American energy. There had already 
been a substantial increase before the 
conflict in Ukraine escalated. Now the 
President wants to trim 3 cents—3 
cents—off the top and take a bow? I 
don’t think so. 
Tomorrow, Secretary Granholm will 
continue the empty theater by holding 
an ‘‘emergency meeting’’ with domes-
tic energy refiners. Presumably, this 
will involve another leftwing brow-
beating like the accusatory letter 
President Biden sent to domestic pro-
ducers just last week. The same admin-
istration—the same one—that hasn’t 
awarded a single offshore energy lease, 
that hasn’t offered an onshore lease 
sale in five straight quarters, and that 
has taken every single opportunity to 
slow-walk new energy infrastructure 
into submission appears to have found

a convenient scapegoat for the con-
sequences of its own actions. 
Actually, I have a better idea: Demo-
crats could stop setting off inflationary 
spirals, stop proposing massive tax 
hikes on the brink of a recession, stop 
waging a holy war against American 
fossil fuels, and stop applauding the 
pain that working families are feeling 
as part of some grand, leftwing ‘‘transi-
tion.’’

NATIVE AMERICAN BOARDING SCHOOLS 
Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, last 
month, the U.S. Department of the In-
terior released an investigative report 
on 
our 
country’s 
Indian 
boarding 
school system. From 1819 to 1969, more 
than 400 of these schools operated 
across what today are 37 States. The 
Indian boarding school era is one of the 
darkest periods in American history 
and one that we as a nation have not 
properly reckoned with. 
For nearly two centuries, the U.S. 
Government took Native American 
children as young as 6 from their fami-
lies and sent them to boarding schools, 
but these schools were not solely for 
the purpose of teaching the children. 
They humiliated these children, and 
they harmed them. Indian children 
were forced to change their names, to 
cut their hair, to stop speaking their 
Native languages. They did military 
drills three times a week. Every day, 
they were assigned hours of grueling 
work that violated child labor laws: 
They had to raise livestock, sew 
clothes, work on the railroads. Those 
who 
resisted 
were 
punished 
with 
whippings and solitary confinement. 
Those who resisted were punished with 
whippings and solitary confinement. 
Often, older children were forced to 
punish the younger ones. 
The conditions of these schools were 
awful: three to a bed, dirty water, no 
working 
plumbing. 
Disease 
and 
malnourishment were common. Phys-
ical and sexual abuse was rampant. We 
don’t know how many children died at 
these U.S. Government-funded and -run 
schools, but the Interior Department 
estimates that the number is in the 
tens of thousands. 
And all of this occurred for one rea-
son—to steal Native land. 
As far back as the 1700s, U.S. Govern-
ment policy was officially to dispossess 
and break Tribes so their territories 
could be taken for American expansion. 
Erasing Native culture through assimi-
lation was key to this. 
As one official said, ‘‘The love of 
home and the warm, reciprocal affec-
tion existing between parents and chil-
dren are among the strongest charac-
teristics of the Indian nature.’’ 
So the Federal Government acted ac-
cordingly. The Departments of War and 
Interior oversaw this forced assimila-
tion. 
Congress 
passed 
laws 
appro-
priating school funding to ‘‘civilize’’ 
Native children. When families refused 
to send their kids to these schools, 
Congress made the food rations that 
were negotiated in treaties contingent 
on their doing so. To fill the schools, 
the government enlisted religious orga-
nizations, paying them on a per-child 
basis. A majority of this money came 
from Federal Indian trusts—money 
that was supposed to help the Tribes— 
and the Supreme Court ruled that all 
of this was legal at the time. 
The result of these actions was a 
multi-generational trauma for Amer-
ican Indian, Alaska Native, and Native 
Hawaiian communities and families 
that continue to this day. Adults who 
attended boarding schools are more 
likely to have everything from arthri-
tis to depression. They are three times 
as likely to have cancer. Studies have 
found worse health outcomes for the 
ancestors of people who went to these 
schools, and there are 53 known child 
burial sites and an unknown number 
yet to be discovered. 
We can’t undo this history, but we 
have to acknowledge it. That starts 
with examining the full scope of this 
atrocity 
unflinchingly, 
with 
clear 
minds and with fresh eyes. We need to 
keep 
investigating 
Indian 
boarding 
schools, and the findings should be 
taught in every school and be known 
by every future generation of Ameri-
cans. As recommended in the report 
from the Department of the Interior, 
we must also support Native language 
revitalization. We cannot continue to 
neglect these programs and further 
erase Native culture. 
We have to understand and under-
take a path toward healing, not in the 
abstract but in a concrete and mean-
ingful way. We must work hand in 
hand with Native communities on a re-
spectful and restorative process. We 
have to empower these communities 
through increased Federal investments 
in Native healthcare and housing and 
economic development. We must reject 
our centuries-long pattern of Native 
suppression and, instead, begin one of 
reconciliation. We owe the survivors of 
the Indian boarding school era, their 
families, and their communities noth-
ing less.

f 
45TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE TRANS-ALASKA 
PIPELINE SYSTEM 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I 
have come to the floor this morning to 
recognize and commemorate the 45th 
anniversary of the first oil moving 
through 
the 
Trans-Alaska 
Pipeline 
System. We actually reached that 
milepost on Monday so I am here to 
speak this morning about what this 
800-mile-long 
pipeline 
continues 
to 
mean for Alaska, our Nation, and real-
ly the world itself. 
TAPS, the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, is 
truly a modern marvel. It is the back-
bone of my home State’s economy. It 
supports great jobs for Alaska. It helps 
generate 
critical 
revenues 
for 
our 
State. It ensures that our energy is 
transported safely, and it really is a 
vital component of America’s energy 
security. But I think it is kind of nice, 
as we reflect on decades past, to appre-
ciate some of the history behind the 
Trans-Alaska Pipeline because, for a 
period of time, there was a question of 
whether or not this extraordinary en-
ergy infrastructure would be built at 
all. 
After oil was discovered in Prudhoe 
Bay, there was vigorous debate as to 
how we were going to move this re-
source, how we were going to transport 
it. Some wanted to use trucks or tank-
ers; others actually thought that mas-
sive jets would be the way to go. There 
were some who wanted to build an 
overland pipeline across Canada. That 
would have been about a 3,200-mile line 
in length. But, thankfully, it was an 
all-Alaska pipeline route that pre-
vailed. 
So when you look at the map of Alas-
ka and where our pipeline sits today, it 
truly does just bisect the entire State 
of Alaska. From Prudhoe to Valdez at 
Tidewater is an 800-mile line. Thank-
fully, an all-Alaska pipeline route was 
the one that ultimately prevailed over 
all of the alternatives that were con-
sidered. 
Congress 
authorized 
it 
in 
1973—an 
overwhelmingly 
bipartisan 
basis of authorization. 
There is an interesting side story—it 
is actually not a side story; it is pretty 
pivotal—in terms of whether or not 
this Trans-Alaska Pipeline actually 
came into being. But it was a tie- 
breaking vote cast by Spiro Agnew 
that really helped to facilitate the line 
because it effectively determined that 
there would be no further litigation 
about the line moving forward. 
The 
preconstruction 
process 
for 
TAPS lasted for about 6 years, mostly 
concurrent with the final passage of its 
authorization act; and as part of that, 
the Federal Task Force on Alaskan Oil 
Development—this is a group that we 
should probably be bringing back— 
completed a six-volume environmental 
impact statement, so a six-volume EIS. 
And that EIS, along with Congress’s 
decision to shield TAPS from litiga-
tion—again, this tie-breaking vote that 
I have alluded to—allowed the con-
struction to begin. So it did. 
Several companies joined together to 
form a joint venture, called Alyeska, 
and they set forth to build and operate 
the line. And Alyeska ultimately ac-
quired 515 Federal permits, along with 
more than 832 from the State of Alas-
ka, in order to proceed. 
Now, at that time, TAPS was the 
largest private construction project of 
its kind. It had a pricetag of more than 
$8 billion. In October of 1975, more than 
28,000 people were working to make it a 
reality, and together they turned over 
100,000 pieces of 40- to 60-foot pipe in a

48-inch diameter that runs from, again, 
Prudhoe to Valdez in the south central 
part of our State. 
I have had many opportunities to 
show visitors our Trans-Alaska Pipe-
line. If you look at it from the air, it is 
just this silver ribbon, again, that bi-
sects the State. You look at it from the 
ground, and, again, it is truly, truly an 
engineering marvel. 
Now, I saw an old criticism that 
TAPS was an ‘‘engineer’s nightmare.’’ 
The occupant of the Chair here might 
be interested in this given your back-
ground, but, in reality, it is a testa-
ment, truly, to world-class engineering 
and the genius, the creativity, and the 
pioneering spirit of all who worked on 
it. 
TAPS crosses three mountain ranges, 
including Atigun Pass in the Brooks 
Range that has an elevation of 4,739 
feet. It reaches a grade of 55 degrees at 
Thompson Pass in the Chugach Range. 
It crosses more than 530 streams and 
rivers. It accommodates some 579 ani-
mal crossings. And it operates at tem-
peratures ranging from 95 degrees 
above zero to 80 degrees below zero, and 
that is not counting the windchill fac-
tor. 
And when you are talking about 
Alaska, of course, you have got to ac-
count for seismic activity. So TAPS’ 
engineers also had to account for that. 
You have got mountain ranges. You 
have got extreme weather. You have 
got animals, wildlife that you have to 
accommodate. You have the rivers, the 
streams, but you also have to accom-
modate seismic hazard. 
The pipeline crosses three fault lines, 
including the Denali Fault. In that 
area, engineers built the pipeline on 
slider beams with Teflon shoes. So if 
you look at these supports here, these 
vertical support pillars here and the 
slider beams are on Teflon shoes that 
allow the pipeline to move laterally up 
to 20 feet—up to 20 feet laterally—and 
up to 5 feet vertically. So this pipeline 
can absorb the give-and-take and the 
hard shake of a significant earthquake. 
And it is pretty important that the 
engineers worked this into this ex-
traordinary infrastructure. We had a 
magnitude 7.9 earthquake that struck 
in 2002 right on that Denali Fault. The 
pipeline handled it well. It remained 
intact, and it did exactly what the en-
gineers designed it to do: It moved 
back and forth on these lateral sup-
ports. It moved up and down, and it al-
lowed that pipeline, that piece of steel 
pipeline, to have the flex that it needed 
to avoid any—any—issues. 
The Trans-Alaska Pipeline System 
was built in just over 3 years. This was 
between 1974 and 1977. I was a young 
person growing up in Fairbanks at the 
time, and that was a time and place of 
great energy and intensity as we were 
involved in this extraordinary oil con-
struction boom. And the men and 
women who were working on the 
project at that time had this saying: 
‘‘They just didn’t know that it couldn’t 
be done.’’ And they not only met their 
goal of first oil moving through the 
pipeline by July 1, 1977; they beat it by 
10 days. 
And the rest, they say, is history. 
Over the past 45 years, TAPS has not 
just been a pipeline, not just oil pipe-
line infrastructure; it has become Alas-
ka’s economic lifeline. I say it is like 
the artery for our State. It has helped 
us create jobs to the point where our 
oil and gas industry either employs or 
supports about one-third of Alaska’s 
workforce. It has generated billions of 
dollars in revenues for our State—for 
everything from roads and schools to 
essential services. 
TAPS has allowed us to create and 
now grow our Permanent Fund. This 
Permanent Fund has really turned our 
oil resources into an enduring source of 
prosperity for Alaskans. We not only 
have a Permanent Fund, but spun off 
from that Permanent Fund and the in-
vestment on those earnings are divi-
dends that are returned to each and 
every Alaskan in this State. If you 
lived in Alaska from 1982, when they 
first started the dividends, until today, 
you would have received nearly $45,000 
in annual dividends that go to offset 
the high cost of living in a high-cost 
State like Alaska. This year, Alaskans 
are set to receive a pretty hefty Per-
manent Fund dividend: more than 
$3,000 more. 
So it has been an economic benefit, 
most certainly, to Alaskans. It has also 
enabled us to keep our State tax bur-
den low. We have no income tax in the 
State. We have no statewide sales tax. 
We have the lowest gas tax in the coun-
try. 
As the economist Scott Goldsmith 
has noted, revenues from TAPS also 
enable us to keep taxes on other indus-
tries like our tourism, our fisheries—it 
allows us to keep those taxes lower 
than they might otherwise be. 
But really, from day one, TAPS has 
strengthened our energy security. And 
when I talk about energy security, I 
am referring not just to the security of 
those of us in Alaska but to our Na-
tion’s energy security. It helped tide 
America over during the 1979 oil crisis. 
It has insulated us from OPEC and 
OPEC Plus and lessened our depend-
ence on nations that do not share our 
interests, and it has dramatically re-
duced the dollars that go overseas to 
purchase oil. 
It has certainly provided reliable and 
affordable energy for tens of millions 
of Americans up and down the west 
coast because it is the west coast 
where Alaskan oil is primarily di-
rected. 
But it is hard to imagine Alaska 
without TAPS, without the Trans- 
Alaska Pipeline System. It is hard also 
to 
imagine 
the 
consequences 
that 
America would have faced without the 
18.4 billion barrels of oil that it has 
now safely moved over these past 45 
years. And I think it is no exaggeration 
to say that while we built a pipeline, 
that pipeline has helped us build our 
State. 
And in the midst of all this—some-
thing that the folks at Alyeska Pipe-
line are very, very proud of—Alyeska 
has 
accrued 
a 
remarkable 
safety 
record. From 2017 through 2020, the 
company reported a total of just 5.1 
barrels of oil as spilled. Yet over that 
same time period, from 2017 to 2020, 
more than 733 million barrels of oil 
have moved through TAPS. So not 1 in 
every 1 million gallons, not 1 in every 
10 million gallons, not even 1 in every 
100 million gallons was spilled during 
this time period. That is a pretty darn 
good record. And that is something 
that Alyeska can be proud of, and I 
think it speaks to the kind of company 
that it is. 
And, at its core, the reason why 
TAPS has been successful are its peo-
ple. They focus on safety first. There 
are more than 700 people who work di-
rectly for Alyeska on the North Slope, 
at the pump stations, at its Anchorage 
control center, and in Valdez. And you 
are probably not going to find a more 
dedicated group. They are just so com-
mitted to their mission, and it cer-
tainly makes me proud to know that 95 
percent of those who work at Alyeska 
are Alaskans. 
TAPS is an economic engine for our 
State. But as we are standing here in 
2022 celebrating its 45th anniversary, 
the fact of the matter is, this pipeline 
faces a real challenge. TAPS’ technical 
capacity is 2 million barrels per day. 
We have achieved that years ago. But 
right now—right now—the pipeline is 
moving just a quarter of that. They are 
moving about 500,000 barrels a day. So 
what that means is that the line is 
about three-quarters empty, and that 
can create some difficult operational 
challenges. 
We have had many of the briefings 
about what it means when you have a 
pipeline that isn’t completely full. The 
throughput moves slower. And when 
you have hot oil coming out of the 
ground in an arctic environment, mov-
ing 800 miles through a cold piece of 
steel, if it doesn’t move quickly and it 
is allowed to cool down, it can build up 
waxy buildup on the inside that needs 
to be scrubbed and cleaned. We call it 
pigging. It is just an operational thing. 
Alyeska deals with it, but it is some-
thing that is an issue. 
When 
you 
have 
less 
than 
full 
throughput, it moves differently. So 
when you are going up mountain 
ranges and down the other side, now 
what happens as you see that pipeline, 
which is designed to flex, when you 
don’t have your full operational capac-
ity? And Alyeska has been working to 
work through some of these challenges, 
and they have been doing a good job. 
But in fairness, this is not Alyeska’s 
fault here. If you want to know why 
TAPS is a quarter full, you can prob-
ably look to some people in this Cham-
ber, some who have been serving in this 
Chamber before. You can look down 
the street to Pennsylvania Avenue at 
the current administration as well as 
some who preceded the Biden adminis-
tration.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3050 
June 22, 2022 
We have the resources—Alaska has 
the resources to fill TAPS up. What we 
have lacked is access to our lands, ac-
cess to our leases, and access to the 
permits to help make this a reality. 
And this is despite various Presidents 
telling Alaskans that, look, you are 
going to be able to develop your re-
sources. They say it, and the promises 
are broken over and over and over 
again. And it continues to this day. 
The Biden administration is breaking 
the law by refusing to carry out the oil 
and gas program that Congress man-
dated for the non-wilderness 1002 Area. 
We did that in the 2017 law. 
Millions of acres in our National Pe-
troleum Reserve are being taken off 
the table with this administration 
through, 
effectively, 
administration 
whim. And with one of the best 
projects within the Petroleum Reserve 
right now, we are dealing with some 
redtape here; but, effectively, the ex-
cuse is that more studies need to be 
done. These are studies that have been 
done already, and we are being told you 
have to do them again. 
With gas prices averaging more than 
$5 a gallon across the Nation, it sure 
would be nice to fill up the Trans-Alas-
ka Pipeline. It not only gives us more 
product domestically; it would cer-
tainly help us in Alaska. We would 
have more jobs in Alaska and more rev-
enue to help us improve the quality of 
life in every community in our State, 
help offset the very high fuel costs in 
our State. We averaged $5 and above a 
long time before many in the lower 48 
here. 
But we would also be bringing less 
foreign oil to the West Coast, including 
California, where imports have risen in 
almost direct proportion to our produc-
tion decline. As you are seeing less oil 
coming out of Alaska to the West 
Coast, particularly California, they are 
getting it from somewhere, and they 
are bringing it in. They are importing 
that. And whether it is from countries 
that don’t like us and don’t really care 
about their environmental track record 
or their human rights issues, we get it 
from there. 
We would also have an alternative to 
Russia, which continues to sell its en-
ergy and bring in billions of dollars a 
day to finance its bloody war against 
Ukraine. And then across the Nation, 
you could anticipate that prices would 
be lower at the pump, which would re-
duce the pain that families and busi-
nesses are experiencing. 
I know that there is not a dial on this 
extraordinary energy security asset 
where we can just ramp it up, but this 
is an important discussion to be hav-
ing, again, in context of what value the 
oil resources in Alaska can contribute 
to our country. 
And when you have in place policies 
that say it is not important to keep 
this thing full—even though in Alaska, 
you have the resources to keep it full— 
when you say it is not important and 
you put in place pressures and obsta-
cles and barriers to increase produc-
tion, you are going to see that. You are 
going to see that impact, what happens 
in this country to our supply. Right 
now, we are all reading about it. We 
are all watching the news. 
There is a lot that President Biden is 
saying that this is what we are going 
to do to bring down your gas prices, 
but I will go on record to suggest that 
a full TAPS would do a heck of a lot 
more to reduce gas prices than many of 
the other suggestions out there like 
price gouging probes and suspension of 
the Federal gas tax, the proposal to 
hand out gas cards. These are tem-
porary—almost momentary—blips that 
might make somebody feel OK for a 
month or 2 because maybe I get a few 
cents more off the price at the pump if 
we have a 3-month Federal gas tax hol-
iday like President Biden is suggesting. 
But, you know, it is not right to put in 
place—I mean, you can call it a gim-
mick, but are you addressing the fun-
damentals of supply and demand if you 
just say for a few months: ‘‘Here, we 
are going to take the pressure off you 
so you won’t be so mad’’? Well, people 
are going to continue to be so mad if it 
doesn’t help alleviate the problem, if it 
doesn’t help address the pain that 
American families are feeling. 
It is pretty simple out here. We need 
supply. We need supply to keep up with 
the rising demand and the falling out-
put from around the world. This is 
where we need to wake up because it is 
not as if we don’t have options. It is 
not as if we don’t have the supply. 
Alaska has the supply right in the vi-
cinity of a world-class pipeline that has 
room for an additional 1.5 million bar-
rels per day. 
It is just beyond me why anyone 
would contemplate oil from Iran or 
Venezuela or other members of OPEC+ 
over a State like Alaska. It is just be-
yond me; yet that is what we hear. 
That is what we hear from the Presi-
dent. That is what we hear from the 
administration that somehow we have 
to get this resource and it is going to 
have to come from somewhere, so we 
are going to go asking. We are going to 
go asking outside of our country. We 
are going to go to Iran, Venezuela. 
The President is going to make a trip 
to Saudi Arabia, yet they are not ask-
ing Alaska to do more. In fact, they are 
not only not asking, they continue to 
put up impediments and barriers for us 
to do more, and that just defies logic. 
It degrades the environment. It makes 
the world a more dangerous place every 
time we look to other countries for re-
sources that we need, knowing full well 
that we have a better environmental 
record here. We have the ability to 
make us less vulnerable, less energy- 
insecure, and yet we are not taking ad-
vantage of that. 
There is a section on Alyeska’s 
website titled ‘‘Memories and Mile-
posts,’’ with historical information 
about TAPS, and I would suggest that 
it is well worth visiting and recog-
nizing what an incredible asset this 
pipeline has been since first oil was 
moved through it on June 20, 1977. 
Forty-five years is a good long time, 
but even as we thank all who have 
made TAPS such a resounding success, 
I would encourage all of you to maybe 
mark your calendars for June 20, 2027. 
That will be the 50th anniversary. 
I would hope that we could all be 
honest and realistic about our global 
energy needs in the meantime and en-
sure significantly greater throughput 
is running through that pipeline when 
we reach the next milepost. That would 
be good for Alaskans; that would be 
good for the country. I think it would 
be good and important for the world. 
And we know the men and women who 
operate TAPS at Alyeska and their 
contractors will ensure that every last 
molecule moves safely through it. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HICKENLOOPER). The Republican whip. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I just 
want to echo what was said by my col-
league from Alaska because what we 
are now hearing from the administra-
tion are ideas that they think will help 
ease the pressure on gas prices in this 
country, but they are all gimmicky. I 
mean, it is all rebates—gas card re-
bates or doing away with the gas tax 
temporarily until September, like that 
is going to do anything meaningful 
long term to address this supply-de-
mand crisis that the Senator from 
Alaska just alluded to. 
I have to say that this administra-
tion, from the time they came into of-
fice, has demonstrated an open hos-
tility to oil and gas production in this 
country—energy production, more gen-
erally. 
The Senator from Alaska was talking 
about the oil pipeline. We have one in 
South Dakota—that was going to run 
through South Dakota—the Keystone 
XL Pipeline, which was killed the first 
day in office by the Biden administra-
tion and, again, sent signals to those 
who produce energy in this country 
that we are not interested in what you 
have to offer. We want to move in a dif-
ferent direction. And that different di-
rection, of course, is electric vehicles, 
which I am not against. Everybody 
might want an electric vehicle. It is a 
free country. But the fact of the mat-
ter is, we will be dependent upon liquid 
fuels in the foreseeable future. Since 
that is the case, we ought to produce it 
right here in Alaska. We have vast re-
sources. 
It is an issue, fundamentally, of sup-
ply and demand. As the Senator of 
Alaska pointed out, you look at Alas-
ka, now we are talking about getting 
oil from Saudi Arabia, from Venezuela, 
from countries, other places around the 
world—in some cases run by dic-
tators—instead of producing it right 
here in the United States of America. 
That is just tragic. It is just tragic, and 
the American people are paying the 
price for it. 
Why? Because in places like Alaska 
where we have abundant resources, 
they shut it down. They shut down

Federal lands. They started denying 
permits to drill, and they killed the in-
frastructure that supports, in many 
cases, energy production in this coun-
try. 
A pipeline, for example, is not only 
the most efficient, but the safest way 
to transport liquid fuels in this coun-
try. We need liquid fuels. We know 
that. It is a fact, and we have the sup-
ply—abundant supply is right here in 
the United States. All we have to do is 
simply access that. Instead, we are 
talking about gimmicks like rebates, 
gas card rebates or temporary suspen-
sion of the fuel tax in this country 
which, by the way, would rob the High-
way Trust Fund of the resources that 
we need to build out the infrastructure 
in this country and to maintain it. 
There are just so many reasons and 
on so many levels why these are bad 
ideas—so bad, in fact, that Speaker 
PELOSI in the House of Representatives 
has previously referred to this kind of 
idea that the administration is now 
proposing as a gimmick and something 
that isn’t going to provide long-term 
relief. 
It is fundamentally an issue of supply 
and demand, and all we simply have to 
do is turn it on. We have to get the en-
ergy producers in this country off the 
sidelines, back into the game, pro-
ducing oil and gas in America in a way 
that will meet Americans’ daily needs 
when they fill up their cars and trucks 
with gasoline at the pump, which right 
now they are being punished unneces-
sarily by an economy where we have 
constantly rising gas prices. The aver-
age price is around $5 nationwide, lit-
erally a doubling of the gas price since 
this President took office. There is a 
direct correlation—direct correlation— 
connect the dots—to policy decisions 
this administration has made, which 
they are now realizing and trying to 
come up with these gimmicky ideas to 
try to deal with an issue that fun-
damentally could be fixed simply by 
sending the right signals and encour-
aging and incentivizing the type of en-
ergy production in this country that 
we ought to be encouraging. 
And the energy producers in this 
country are up to it. They will meet 
the demand if we simply give them the 
opportunity. That is what needs to 
change. That is what this administra-
tion needs to be focused on, not on 
shutting down gas and oil and energy 
production here in the United States. 
PRO-LIFE MOVEMENT 
Mr. President, the Dobbs case will be 
decided by the Supreme Court in a 
matter of days now. I pray that it will 
be decided in favor of life and that Roe 
v. Wade, a case that even pro-abortion 
constitutional scholars criticized, will 
be overturned. 
But however Dobbs is decided, the 
work of the pro-life movement will 
continue. That work, of course, in-
cludes advocacy—attempts to change 
laws that ensure that human rights of 
unborn human beings are protected. 
But perhaps most of all, it includes 
the daily work of providing help to 
moms in need. Helping moms and their 
babies are central to the pro-life move-
ment. Pregnancy resource centers and 
other pro-life organizations provide a 
variety of resources to help women in 
challenging circumstances. They pro-
vide supplies for moms and their ba-
bies. They offer prenatal and parenting 
classes. They assist moms with hous-
ing. They help them connect with 
State and local resources, and they 
provide friendship and support and a 
listening ear to mom going through a 
difficult time. 
They provide agency referrals for 
mothers who choose to make an adop-
tion plan for their babies. They provide 
places for moms and their babies to 
live while they complete their edu-
cation or get back on their feet. 
During the current formula crisis, 
pregnancy resource centers have helped 
moms struggling to find what they 
need to feed their babies by providing 
them with free formula. 
You would think that helping out 
moms would be pretty uncontroversial. 
You would think that everyone, includ-
ing individuals who are pro-abortion, 
could get behind helping a struggling 
mom find housing or access to prenatal 
care. But apparently the pro-abortion 
movement finds providing material 
help to moms in need and letting them 
know they have alternatives to abor-
tion somehow to be pretty threatening. 
Pregnancy resource centers have fre-
quently been a target of pro-abortion 
politicians in the pro-abortion move-
ment, which have sought to undermine 
their work. But things have gotten 
very serious in recent weeks. Since a 
draft of a possible opinion in the Dobbs 
case was leaked in May, pro-abortion 
extremists have conducted a campaign 
of vandalism and violence against preg-
nancy resource centers and churches. 
Just a few blocks away from here, one 
pregnancy resource center was egged 
and graffitied and had its door covered 
in red paint. A number of others have 
faced similar vandalism, and multiple 
pregnancy resource centers have been 
the victim of arson. 
A group claiming responsibility for a 
number of the attacks, Jane’s Revenge, 
released a chilling letter last week in 
which it declared ‘‘open season’’ on 
pregnancy centers and stated: 
We promised to take increasingly drastic 
measures against oppressive infrastructures. 
Rest assured that we will, and those meas-
ures may not come in the form of something 
so easily cleaned up as fire and graffiti. 
Well, perhaps it is not entirely 
shocking that some members of the ex-
treme abortion movement have re-
sponded to the possibility of Roe being 
overturned with vandalism, arson, and 
threats of further attacks. 
This wave of violence is deeply trou-
bling, and these attacks need to be 
taken seriously. I hope Attorney Gen-
eral Garland is developing a strategy 
to confront this wave of vandalism and 
violence and to prevent future and 
more serious attacks. 
Earlier this month, I joined a number 
of my Republican colleagues in sending 
a letter to the Attorney General asking 
about his plans for dealing with these 
attacks and preventing future ones. I 
am disappointed that we have yet to 
receive a reply to our letter. And the 
President—not 
merely 
his 
spokes-
person but the President himself— 
should be out there strongly con-
demning these attacks and letting ev-
eryone know that violent responses to 
the Dobbs decision will not be toler-
ated. 
After one pregnancy resource center 
was vandalized, its director said: 
We are not going to let intimidation 
change what we are doing. It failed. It was 
pretty unanimous from the volunteers and 
staff here that this is not going to change 
how we will do business here one bit at all. 
I know that attitude is reflected at 
other pregnancy resource centers, and I 
know that, despite threats of violence, 
the work of helping moms and their ba-
bies will continue. 
The work of the pro-life movement 
represents the best of our American 
tradition: providing a voice to the 
voiceless, standing up for the human 
rights of those who have been denied 
them, and providing a helping hand to 
neighbors in need. I am grateful to all 
the pro-life Americans standing up for 
the human rights of unborn human 
beings and helping moms and their ba-
bies get the resources they need, and 
win or lose at the Supreme Court, I 
know that work will continue. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF MARY T. BOYLE 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, later 
this afternoon, we are going to vote on 
Mary Boyle to be a Consumer Product 
Safety Commissioner. This organiza-
tion, the Consumer Product Safety 
Commission, works on the frontlines to 
protect consumers from dangerous and 
defective products, and Ms. Boyle’s 
confirmation will give the Commission 
a full complement of Commissioners to 
complete its important work. 
The Consumer Product Safety Com-
mission is responsible for regulating 
the safety of more than 15,000 everyday 
products and helps keep hazardous 
products out of our homes and away 
from our families. The Agency is re-
sponsible for investigating hazards, ef-
fectuating product recalls, issuing and 
enforcing product safety standards, and 
informing consumers and manufactur-
ers about potential dangers and how to 
avoid them. The CPSC’s work literally 
saves lives and prevents injuries. 
We know that Ms. Boyle is well 
qualified for this position and that she 
will make consumers a top priority and 
their safety a top priority. 
Now is an important time for the 
Consumer Product Safety Commission

June 22, 2022 
to be well equipped to fight for these 
consumer safety issues. We need it to 
remain a strong force in keeping unsafe 
and defective products, including chil-
dren’s toys, infant rockers, household 
appliances, and other issues in the de-
velopment space, like elevators and 
space heaters, out of the market. 
When it comes to recalls, for exam-
ple, this year the Consumer Product 
Safety Commission and three residen-
tial elevator manufacturers announced 
the recall of 70,000 residential elevators 
that posed a serious risk of injury and, 
tragically, death to small children. I 
am encouraged to see that the Con-
sumer Product Safety Commission is 
taking action on this heartbreaking 
issue. There is more to be done, and we 
need a Commission that will follow 
through. 
The Commission is also responsible 
for investigating tragedies, such as 
home fires that might have been 
caused by defective products. In fact, 
the Consumer Product Safety Commis-
sion was quickly on the scene in the 
Bronx earlier this year when a fire 
from a space heater caused the death of 
17 people, including 8 children. When I 
sent a letter to the Consumer Product 
Safety Commission asking them to 
look further into this issue, they acted 
quickly and knew that we had to inves-
tigate. 
While these investigations are still 
ongoing, we need assurances that if a 
defective product is found to be the 
cause, that the Consumer Product 
Safety Commission is going to be fully 
equipped to take action. 
I also want to mention with respect 
to the Consumer Product Safety Com-
mission’s rulemaking authority that 
the 
Commerce 
Committee 
recently 
passed the STURDY Act, a bill that 
would speed up the Consumer Product 
Safety Commission’s rulemaking proc-
ess to deal with furniture tipovers. 
Unfortunately, many furniture items 
are designed in such a way that they 
can tip if a child grabs or climbs upon 
them, with the potential of very tragic 
consequences. The Consumer Product 
Safety Commission has been under-
taking a rulemaking to ban unsafe fur-
niture items by imposing strict tipover 
testing requirements. I hope we will 
see a safety standard for this very 
soon. 
Over the course of more than a dec-
ade at the Commission, Ms. Boyle has 
worked on these issues in senior posi-
tions across the Consumer Product 
Safety Commission, including as Gen-
eral Counsel and Deputy General Coun-
sel before assuming her current role as 
Executive Director. 
As the Consumer Product Safety 
Commission’s General Counsel, Ms. 
Boyle served the Agency’s chief legal 
officer—providing legal, policy, and 
strategic advice on a multitude of reg-
ulatory, statutory, fiscal, litigation, 
and enforcement issues—and examined 
proposed product safety rules and 
standards. So I think she is well quali-
fied for this job. She worked with the 
Department of Justice on Federal 
court litigation in which the Commis-
sion was involved. 
In her current role as Executive Di-
rector, she is the chief operating offi-
cer of the Agency, ensuring that it 
meets program and operational and ad-
ministrative functions. She is more 
than well-versed in the Agency’s proc-
esses and eminently qualified to hit the 
ground running as a Commissioner. 
Over 90 different organizations have 
written to my office in support of her 
nomination, including the AFL–CIO, 
the Consumer Federation of America, 
the National Consumers League, Kids 
in Danger, and many, many more orga-
nizations. 
I want to say to all my colleagues, I 
hope you will vote to confirm Ms. 
Boyle to ensure that the Consumer 
Product Safety Commission can move 
forward so that these important issues 
can be addressed and Americans can 
find safer products in their homes. 
I look forward to working with Ms.

BIPARTISAN SAFER COMMUNITIES ACT 
Ms. SINEMA. Madam President, I 
rise today at a time in which families 
in Arizona and across America are 
scared. For too long, they have seen 
unacceptable levels of violence in their 
communities, and it threatens their 
sense of safety and security. 
The morning after the tragic, hor-
rible activity at Robb Elementary 
School in Uvalde, TX, we all felt that 
fear. We felt it when we spoke to our 
neighbors and our friends and checked 
on our loved ones to ensure they were 
OK. 
For decades, parents have lived with 
the unnerving uncertainty of what 
might happen when they send their 
children to school or attend worship 
services, go to the grocery store, or 
even simply let their kids play outside. 
For too long, political games in 
Washington on both sides of the aisle 
have stopped progress towards pro-
tecting our communities and keeping 
families safe and secure. Commonsense 
proposals have been tossed to the side 
by partisan lawmakers choosing poli-
tics instead of solutions. 
Elected officials have made a habit of 
insulting 
one 
another 
for 
offering 
thoughts and prayers, for blaming vio-
lence on strictly mental illnesses or 
video games or particular kinds of 
weapons or any cause that didn’t align 
with and confirm their own predeter-
mined beliefs. 
Casting blame and trading political 
barbs and attacks became the path of 
least resistance, but the communities 
across our country that have experi-
enced senseless violence deserve better 
than Washington politics as usual. Our 
communities deserve a commitment by 
their leaders to do the hard work of 
putting aside politics, identifying prob-
lems that need solving, and working 
together towards common ground and 
common goals. 
On May 24, as news spread of the 
shooting in Uvalde and the 21 beautiful 
lives cut short, my friend and colleague 
CHRIS
MURPHY
came to the Senate 
floor, and he asked the Senate one sim-
ple question: What are we doing; why 
are we here, if not to solve a problem 
as existential as this? 
I am grateful that colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle have answered CHRIS’s 
question by resolving to do the hard 
work, build consensus, and find solu-
tions. 
Senator MURPHY, a tireless advocate 
for families in Connecticut, reached 
out to my friend Senator JOHN CORNYN 
of Texas, offering his condolences and 
assistance. Senator CORNYN
was in 
Uvalde, comforting families who were 
experiencing the unthinkable, and Sen-
ator MURPHY had, sadly, been in a simi-
lar place 10 years before at Sandy 
Hook. 
That same day, I reached out to Sen-
ator CORNYN and Senator THOM TILLIS, 
two friends I have worked with to craft 
lasting, bipartisan solutions managing 
the crisis at our border and helping 
veterans access the benefits they have 
earned. We all planned to get quickly 
together to identify realistic solutions. 
Within 1 day, Senators MURPHY, COR-
NYN, 
TILLIS, 
and 
myself—all 
rep-
resenting diverse States from across 
the country—sat down and started 
working together. 
That same day, we met with a larger 
group of 12 bipartisan Senators, all of 
whom were eager to sit down, work to-
gether, and find a path forward. 
Those meetings started a 4-week 
process, considering and working to-
ward a host of solutions that would 
save lives, make communities safer, 
and protect Americans’ constitutional 
rights. 
As we wrote our bill, we viewed our 
conversations as collaborations, not 
negotiations. We refused to frame our 
work as giving something up to getting 
something in return, and we stayed 
laser-focused on our shared goal of re-
ducing violence and saving lives across 
American communities. 
We acknowledged that the root of vi-
olence plaguing our communities is 
complex. It can be partly attributed to 
criminals with dangerous weapons and 
attributed to a mental health crisis af-
fecting young people in cities and 
towns across America. 
We spent hours carefully considering 
policy provisions, ensuring that we got 
the language right and that every pol-
icy included in our bill could help save 
lives, help children learn and grow in 
healthy, supportive environments, and 
make our communities safer, more vi-
brant places. 
It was hard work, and it was worth 
it. Together, we put aside our dif-
ferences, focused on our shared values, 
and crafted a bill that expands re-
sources in schools to help kids grow 
and learn, where they feel connected to 
their communities and where they 
know they can seek help if they need 
it. 
We boosted mental health resources 
through more community behavioral 
health clinics and increased access to 
telehealth services, ensuring that kids 
and families have access to care no 
matter where they live. 
Our mental health and school sup-
port proposals include evidence-based 
resources and programs that I saw help 
reduce violence when I was a young so-
cial worker serving in Sunnyslope and 
Shaw Butte Elementary Schools in 
Phoenix. 
Our provisions to protect more sur-
vivors of domestic violence will reduce 
the impact of trauma in children’s 
lives all across the country, ensuring 
that more kids and families grow up in 
safe homes, free from violence, and free 
from the fear of violence. 
And acknowledging the fact that the 
overwhelming number of gun owners 
are law-abiding citizens, we cracked 
down on criminals who illegally sell or 
purchase guns and ensure that courts, 
consistent 
with 
clear 
due 
process 
rights, can keep dangerous weapons 
out of the hands of people who are dan-
gerous to themselves and others. 
I am the sister of a police officer, and 
I grew up in a family of gun owners. I 
know firsthand how fundamental the 
Second 
Amendment 
is 
to 
families 
across Arizona. Arizonans have a con-
stitutional right to bear and keep 
arms, and that right will not be in-
fringed upon. 
Instead, our Bipartisan Safer Com-
munities Act ensures that our back-
ground check system works effectively 
and includes those who have com-
mitted dangerous crimes as juveniles

or who have a history of domestic vio-
lence—protecting 
the 
constitutional 
rights of law-abiding Americans while 
reducing familial violence and occur-
rences of childhood trauma. 
All of these tools together will give 
families in Arizona and across our 
country more peace of mind so they 
can trust that their communities are 
secure and their schools are safe. 
And, critically, the broad, bipartisan 
support of well over 60 Senators from 
across the political spectrum, includ-
ing both the Republican and Demo-
cratic Senate leaders, ensures that 
when our bill is signed into law, it will 
stand the test of time. 
You know, over the past few years, 
we have been told, time and time 
again, that bipartisanship just isn’t 
possible. And even after proving bipar-
tisan success with our historic Infra-
structure Investment and Jobs law last 
year, we continued to be asked by pun-
dits and political purists to accept a 
new standard by which important pol-
icy can only come together on a party 
line. 
But that just isn’t true. What could 
be more important than keeping fami-
lies and children safe and secure in 
their 
communities 
and 
in 
their 
schools? 
The truth is, Americans are far more 
united than today’s politics would have 
you believe. Ask our constituents in 
Arizona, Connecticut, Texas, North 
Carolina, and every State in between— 
ask them what they want to see in 
Washington, and they will tell you: an 
ability to work together, to solve prob-
lems, and help them build better lives 
for themselves and their families. 
Our bipartisan group of Senators re-
jected the notion that legislating must 
be a zero-sum game, with winners on 
one tally sheet and losers on another. 
Together, we provided an example for 
how Washington can and should work. 
We got out of our comfort zones; we 
built broad coalitions with unlikely al-
lies; and we refused to demonize each 
other when things got tough. 
And I sincerely thank Senator CHRIS 
MURPHY for his passion, Senator JOHN 
CORNYN for his leadership, and Senator 
THOM TILLIS for his pragmatism. 
Each of my friends and colleagues 
brought a unique perspective and ex-
pertise that allowed us, together, to 
craft the most holistic approach to 
community violence in nearly 30 years. 
I also want to thank all of our staffs, 
especially my legislative director, Mi-
chael Brownlie, and my counsel, Chris 
Leuchten, for their tireless hours, in-
cluding working straight through Fa-
ther’s Day to get this bill right. 
You know, their efforts will save 
lives, help families across our country 
feel more secure, and make our schools 
safer. 
I promised Arizonans that I would be 
an independent leader for our State 
and that I would ignore the chaos of 
Washington and instead just focus on 
getting things done. It won’t surprise 
anyone who might be listening today 
when I tell you that Washington hasn’t 
always liked my approach. But our bi-
partisan bill demonstrates the dif-
ference that elected leaders can make 
in the lives of our constituents when 
we choose to heal our divisions instead 
of feed those divisions. 
Our historic legislation proves that 
bipartisan solutions are possible when 
we just stay focused on what we were 
sent to Washington to do—to solve 
problems, help Americans thrive, and 
ensure that our country remains a safe 
and secure place to call home. 
And on this particular bill, my col-
leagues and I join together with a spe-
cial sense of purpose to honor the lives 
that were tragically lost to senseless 
violence in Uvalde, in Buffalo, in Tuc-
son, in Parkland, in Charleston, at 
Sandy Hook, and in communities all 
across our country. 
Our plan will make American com-
munities safer, and we will help return 
a sense of security to everyday Amer-
ican families. 
I couldn’t be more grateful for this 
moment. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HICKENLOOPER). The Senator from Con-
necticut. 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, in the 
Gallery right now listening to the Sen-
ate debate on the Bipartisan Safer 
Communities Act is one of my interns. 
Her name is Sari Kaufman. I am glad 
to have her as an intern in my office 
this summer, but Sari has a story to 
tell because she is a survivor of a mass 
shooting. 
She 
was 
a 
student 
at 
Marjory 
Stoneman Douglas High School when a 
gunman entered that campus and shot 
and killed her friends, her classmates. 
She reminds us that she went to more 
funerals in a matter of a week than 
many adults do in their entire lifetime. 
She was in debate class when the 
shooting started, and she ran for her 
life, as did hundreds of other survivors 
of that horrible day. 
No student in America should have 
to experience what she went through. 
No young person should have the bur-
den that she bears to come to Wash-
ington and argue for changes that will 
make sure that other students don’t go 
through the same thing, and no parent 
should have to go through the grief 
that parents day after day do, mass 
shooting after mass shooting, urban 
homicide after urban homicide, as we 
lose a generation of kids, of young peo-
ple in this Nation to an epidemic of 
gun violence that can be stopped by 
better public policy. 
I have been on this floor hundreds of 
times pleading with my colleagues to 
do something, and I am so grateful 
that Senator CORNYN, Senator TILLIS, 
and a handful of their colleagues on the 
Republican side this time stood up and 
sat down with Senator SINEMA, myself, 
and other Democrats to find the com-
mon denominator. 
I am here on the floor to talk a little 
bit more about what our piece of legis-
lation does, but I agree with Senator 
SINEMA—this is a moment where we 
have shown this country what is pos-
sible here in the U.S. Senate. 
I talked last night about the fear 
that families in Connecticut and all 
across the country felt in the wake of 
Buffalo and Uvalde and that twin fear 
about what fate awaited their children 
but also what fate awaited our democ-
racy if we were unable to rise to this 
moment to deal with this existential 
challenge—the loss of life in schools, in 
shopping malls, in supermarkets. 
And while this compromise was hard- 
earned, every single day for the last 4 
weeks proved to me what can happen in 
this body if we decide to come out of 
our political corners. 
And let me say that this moment 
that we are in today, on the precipice 
of passing the most significant piece of 
anti-gun violence legislation in the 
last 30 years, would not be possible if it 
were not for Senator SINEMA. It would 
not be possible if it wasn’t for her deci-
sion to sit down and help us find a path 
to what was possible. 
But it is also clear that without the 
leadership of Senator CORNYN, who has 
been through way too many of these 
tragedies in his State, and Senator 
TILLIS, a strong supporter of Second 
Amendment rights but also somebody 
who believes in this place finding a way 
to that common denominator, this day 
wouldn’t be possible either. 
So I want to talk for a few moments 
about what this bill does because there 
will be a lot of folks who focus on what 
it doesn’t do. It certainly doesn’t do all 
of the things I think are necessary to 
end the epidemic of gun violence in 
this Nation. But it will save thousands 
of lives; there is no doubt about it in 
my mind. And, in fact, I could make 
the argument that every single one of 
the provisions in this bill, in and of 
themselves, would save thousands of 
lives. 
We don’t get to do that very often in 
this place. We don’t get a chance very 
often to pass legislation that has this 
kind of impact. So if you want to focus 
on what is not in this legislation, you 
can, it is your prerogative, but I want 
to spend a few minutes talking about 
the difference this legislation will 
make in people’s lives. 
Senator SINEMA and Senator CORNYN 
rightly focused—and I put it right at 
the top—this major, historic invest-
ment in mental health access. I made 
no secret in my belief that you can’t 
solve America’s gun violence epidemic 
simply through mental health funding, 
but there is no doubt there is an inter-
section, and there is no doubt that our 
mental health system is just broken— 
period, stop—whether you believe that 
it has any intersection with America’s 
gun violence epidemic. There are far 
too many kids and adults in crisis in 
this country who cannot get access to 
mental health services. In my State, 
kids get stacked up in emergency 
rooms in hallways, waiting days, if not 
weeks, for inpatient beds.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3055 
June 22, 2022 
There is $11 billion in this bill to 
unlock pathways to treatment for kids 
and adults all across this country; 
funding in this bill for school and com-
munity safety—$2 billion to make our 
schools safer, not just for better door- 
locking mechanisms, but also in pro-
grams inside these schools that can try 
to identify kids in crisis early. There 
will be supportive school environments 
that cut down on the pathways to vio-
lence. But also there is money for com-
munity-based intervention, what we 
call violence interruption programs. 
We have them in Connecticut where 
you intervene when a shooting victim 
comes to the hospital. You will make 
sure that that incident doesn’t spiral 
into retributive violence in the com-
munity—funding for school safety and 
community safety in this bill. 
And then the parts of the bill that 
probably get the most attention, the 
changes in our gun laws—these crisis 
intervention orders do work. Not every 
State has them. It was important to 
Senator CORNYN for money to go to 
every State regardless of whether they 
have red flag laws; but if you have a 
red flag law or you want to pass one, 
you will be able to get funding through 
this bill—significant funding—to allow 
you to implement that red flag law bet-
ter. There are States that have them, 
but they don’t work very well because 
people don’t know how to access them. 
Police officers or first responders don’t 
know what to do when they see some-
body in crisis, when they see somebody 
threatening violence to themselves. 
Now, we will have funding to help 
States that will allow the authorities 
with court orders to be able to tempo-
rarily take weapons away from people 
who were threatening to kill them-
selves or threatening mass violence. 
We are going to keep guns away from 
domestic abusers, and we know that in 
States that make sure that every do-
mestic abuser is not allowed to pur-
chase or possess guns that there is a 
significant impact on domestic vio-
lence. And so our bill makes it a na-
tional policy that if you have carried 
out an act of domestic violence against 
your partner, whether you are married 
to them or whether you are in a serious 
dating relationship, you are not going 
to be able to have guns in your home. 
But because this is a compromise, we 
built in a process by which those who 
have no previous record and those who 
keep their records clean subsequent to 
the offense could get those rights back. 
It makes sense to us, especially if you 
are convicted of a felony, you have a 
pretty clear pathway in your States to 
get your rights back—your voting 
rights or your Second Amendment 
rights. So we set up that process for 
those who are convicted of domestic vi-
olence, dating misdemeanors. 
Enhanced 
background 
checks 
for 
young buyers—whether we like it or 
not, the 18-to-21-year-old profile, those 
are the mass shooters right now in this 
country. And so we want to make sure 
that we do a more significant back-
ground check to make sure you are a 
responsible gun buyer, including a 
check with the local police depart-
ment. 
The shooter in Uvalde was known to 
local police. He didn’t have an offense 
that would have prohibited him from 
buying those weapons. But, ask your-
self, what would have happened if the 
local police department had gotten a 
phone call as a part of that background 
check, had been alerted that a young 
man who they knew to be in some form 
of crisis was going to buy AR–15-style 
weapons on his 18th birthday? Would 
there have been an opportunity for an 
intervention? Possibly. Maybe that 
tragedy could have been avoided by 
better public policy. 
In this bill, we also have new pen-
alties for gun trafficking and straw 
purchasing. Why on Earth hasn’t the 
United States of America had a law 
banning gun trafficking at the Federal 
level or banning straw purchasing 
when the main way that guns get into 
the flow of illegal traffic is through 
straw purchasing and through com-
plicated 
gun 
trafficking 
networks? 
Now, our Federal law enforcement 
agencies are going to have available to 
them new tools that will allow them to 
cut down on the flow of illegal weapons 
throughout the country, but in par-
ticular and most importantly, into our 
cities. 
And the last thing we are going to do 
is more background checks because of 
this bill. We clarify in this bill the defi-
nition of a federally licensed gun deal-
er to make sure that everybody who 
should be licensed as a gun owner is. In 
one of the mass shootings in Texas, the 
individual who carried out the crime 
was mentally ill. He was a prohibited 
purchaser. He shouldn’t have been able 
to buy a gun. He was actually denied a 
sale when he went to a bricks-and-mor-
tar gun store, but he found a way 
around the background check system 
because he went online and found a 
seller there who would transfer a gun 
to him without a background check. It 
turned out that seller was, in fact, en-
gaged in the business, but didn’t be-
lieve the definition applied to him be-
cause the definition is admittedly con-
fusing. So we simplified that definition 
and hope that will result—and I believe 
it will result—in more of these fre-
quent online gun sellers registering, as 
they should, as federally licensed gun 
dealers which then requires them to 
perform background checks. 
Each one of these provisions argu-
ably saves thousands of lives in and of 
themselves; but cumulatively, this is a 
groundbreaking piece of legislation—a 
true compromise—not as much as I 
would like to do but certainly more 
than some Republicans would like to 
do. And it is a message to this country 
that there is a path forward in this 
body to address the epidemic of gun vi-
olence. It is a message to the activists 
like Sari Kaufman, who have been 
coming to this place, who have been 
going to their State legislatures, ask-
ing time and time again for change 
that speaking truth to power works, 
that legislators do listen. 
And I hope it as an invitation for us 
to find more ways like this to work to-
gether in the future. My belief is that 
those who vote—even those who have 
been on the outside of these negotia-
tions in the past will find that when 
they get back to their States, there 
will be unfamiliar supporters showing 
up at your events indoors, people who 
are cheering you on because we worked 
together to take this existential issue, 
the fear of death from gun violence, 
more seriously than we have in over 30 
years. 
So I am glad to share in a little bit 
more detail than I was last night what 
is in this package. I believe this is a 
week to focus on what we have done 
and not what we have left undone and 
to accept this as an invitation to find 
other ways to come together around 
difficult, vexing issues in this country. 
I have a fourth grader the same age 
as those kids in Uvalde, and I do not 
want him to grow up in a world in 
which he and his classmates have to 
worry about their survival when they 
walk into their school every day. I do 
not want to live in a world where sur-
vivors of these tragedies in school after 
school have to become advocates and 
activists in this cause. And while this 
bill doesn’t solve America’s gun vio-
lence, it shows we have the potential to 
work together on these difficult vexing 
challenges in a brandnew lifesaving 
way. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic whip is recognized. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, on June 
12, a bipartisan group of 20 Senators 
announced an agreement on legislation 
to protect our children and commu-
nities from the epidemic of gun vio-
lence. In the days since then, this bi-
partisan group, led by Senators MUR-
PHY, CORNYN, SINEMA, TILLIS, and oth-
ers, have worked to move this agree-
ment forward. 
We took a test vote last night—our 
first Senate floor vote on the package. 
It was a strong bipartisan rollcall. 
Let’s be clear: This bill is a com-
promise. In a 50/50 Senate, we expect 
nothing less. 
It doesn’t accomplish everything I 
want. It certainly doesn’t accomplish 
everything which the Republican col-
leagues who voted for it want either, 
but the reforms and investments made 
in this bill represent an important step 
toward making our Nation safer. 
It won’t end gun violence, but it will 
help to reduce the number of shootings 
and killings which number 100 Ameri-
cans each day, and it will end, perhaps, 
guns as the leading cause of death 
among our children. 
Let me highlight a few important 
provisions: $250 million in grants for 
community violence intervention pro-
grams which have shown great promise 
in communities in my State. This

would double the current annual Jus-
tice Department funding for these pro-
grams. The bill makes dramatic invest-
ments in mental health infrastructure, 
providing billions of dollars in school 
and community mental health grants 
and behavioral health clinics. It gives 
an additional $28 million to fund the 
trauma support in school program at 
HHS. This is a program that Senator 
CAPITO—Republican of West Virginia— 
and I created in 2018 to help break the 
cycle of trauma and violence. 
The bill also provides three-quarters 
of $1 billion in Byrne/JAG grants to 
help States administer crisis interven-
tion programs like the extreme risk 
protection order laws in Illinois and 18 
other States. 
The bill takes significant steps to-
ward closing the boyfriend loophole: 
keeping guns out of the hands of dating 
partners who have been convicted of 
domestic violence offenses. 
It creates a new Federal offense for 
the crimes of straw purchasing and gun 
trafficking. This will crack down on 
the illicit flow of guns into cities like 
Chicago. 
Again, this bill is a compromise. 
There are provisions I would rather 
change and some I would rather do 
without; but, overall, it marks the 
most significant gun violence reduc-
tion legislation in nearly three dec-
ades. I commend the bipartisan effort 
that led us to this point, and we should 
pass this bill without delay. 
I want to call particular attention to 
two sections of this bill that I men-
tioned. 
One is to stop straw purchases. Straw 
purchases are when a person with a 
clean criminal record or with no crimi-
nal record goes to buy a gun for the 
sole purpose of giving it to another in-
dividual who has a criminal record and 
couldn’t legally purchase a gun him-
self. That happens. It happened last 
year in Chicago. There was a straw 
purchase of a gun, and the gun was 
handed to a felon who turned around 
and used it to kill a Chicago police-
woman named Ella French. 
Ella French was 29 years old. She was 
a remarkable young woman. She had a 
great future ahead of her. She was, un-
fortunately, shot—gunned down—with 
a straw purchase gun. The same gun 
was used against her partner in his po-
lice vehicle. He lost his sight in one 
eye. He survived. But that just shows 
you that these straw purchase guns are 
being used by people against police and 
innocent people on a regular basis. 
Straw purchasing—buying a gun with 
a clean record to hand over to someone 
who has a felony conviction—should be 
treated as a serious violent crime. This 
bill does that. 
The second thing that we desperately 
need is to deal with counseling. Now, I 
know there is a traditional political ar-
gument where Republicans say: Guns 
are not the problem—it is mental 
health or other issues—and Democrats 
say: It is guns, and if you don’t include 
guns in the package, you are not going 
to get the job done. 
In my view, it includes both. You 
have to believe if half of the gun deaths 
in America each day are suicides, that 
the people who are the victims of those 
suicides needed, at least at some point 
in their lives, mental counseling. This 
bill provides counseling, and I hope it 
comes in the nick of time for people to 
turn their lives around and to restore 
hope in their futures so that they don’t 
resort to the desperate decision toward 
suicide. Mental counseling, for them, is 
important. 
Secondly, of course, we read about 
the mass shooters in theaters and in 
supermarkets and in schools, and we 
realize that they, too, should have been 
counseled at some point in the hopes 
that you could try to divert them from 
this vicious path that they are about to 
follow. That is an important issue. 
The third group is one that I am 
more familiar with. They are those 
people who are involved in gun vio-
lence in our cities like Chicago and St. 
Louis and in so many other cities. 
These are young people who have di-
verted their lives away from what we 
consider to be normal because of a 
traumatic experience. 
Now, trauma is more than physical 
trauma. 
It 
can 
involve 
types 
of 
posttraumatic stress that really lead 
to fight-or-flight syndromes and an in-
volvement in gangs and the use of guns 
without having the feeling of guilt to-
ward anyone you hurt. 
These people need help. If we can 
reach them at an early age in schools, 
we might be able to turn their lives 
around. If we don’t try, unfortunately, 
the violence will only continue on our 
streets. This bill that we are consid-
ering—this community safety bill that 
we are considering—provides resources 
to school districts to counsel young 
people. 
I think it is long overdue and is des-
perately needed, not just for those who 
have been through serious trauma in 
their lives, but for those facing other 
mental challenges. Our kids who have 
gone back to school after COVID may 
need a helping hand and someone they 
can counsel with. This bill starts pro-
viding those valuable resources. I be-
lieve it will make an important dif-
ference in the future of our country. 
INFLATION 
On another topic, Mr. President, ‘‘in-
flation’’ is the word on everyone’s 
mind. We see proof of it plastered on 
gas stations throughout the country 
and in the aisles of our grocery stores. 
Too many families are struggling to 
pay bills. Just last week, the Federal 
Reserve launched its most forceful 
broadside against inflation, the largest 
increase in interest rates in nearly 30 
years. 
As lawmakers, we owe the American 
people an honest, sober assessment of 
how we can start to bring down prices 
and help alleviate stress at the check-
out lane; but, sadly, the inflation con-
versation has been twisted with dishon-
esty and deflection by some political 
critics. 
Instead of passing legislation to help 
reduce the cost of essential goods and 
services like prescription drugs and 
childcare, many are pointing the finger 
of blame at the Biden administration 
as if he invented inflation or isn’t 
doing his best to end it. Despite the 
fact that it was former President 
Trump who urged the Federal Reserve 
to keep the money printer running at 
the start of the pandemic and that the 
Republicans oppose a bill that would 
prevent big oil companies from price 
gouging, we see arguments that are 
made totally on a political level. 
The bad-faith arguments we have 
heard from across the aisle ignore the 
essential truth: Inflation is not just an 
American problem; it is a global prob-
lem. It is happening in advanced econo-
mies like in the UK and France. That 
is largely due to disruptions in the sup-
ply chain. 
The phrase ‘‘supply chain’’ didn’t 
mean much to America a few months 
ago, but now, we know it is an impor-
tant part of our challenge. This began 
2 years ago with the pandemic, and it 
has 
been 
aggravated 
by 
Vladimir 
Putin’s barbaric invasion of Ukraine. It 
has caused the cost of everything from 
food to energy to spike. 
In the words of one conservative 
commentator at the Wall Street Jour-
nal: 
War in Ukraine Fans the Flames of Global 
Inflation. 
IMMIGRATION 
Mr. President, it is crucial to recog-
nize the United States can’t solve these 
global drivers of inflation on our own, 
but there is one driver of inflation that 
is within our control: labor shortages. 
We have twice as many jobs that need 
to be filled in this country as unem-
ployed people to fill them. 
What can we do? 
The chart tells you part of the story. 
This chart indicates that, under the 
policies of the previous administration 
and due to the COVID–19 pandemic, as 
well as lengthy backlogs, America has 
experienced a marked decline in immi-
gration that has had a direct and detri-
mental impact on working families. 
According to EconoFact: 
[N]et migration to the United States . . . 
has significantly declined over the last five 
years due to policies of the Trump adminis-
tration, processing backlogs, the pandemic, 
and other factors. This slowdown has impli-
cations for the number of workers available 
and for fiscal sustainability. 
By the end of 2021, there were 2 mil-
lion fewer working-age immigrants in 
America than there would have been if 
the pre-2020 migration trends had con-
tinued. 
Now, perhaps your first instinct is, 
Well, that is a good thing; that means 
more jobs for American workers. 
But the reality is not that at all. 
This decline in immigration is hurting 
working Americans and is contributing 
to inflation. There are a number of in-
dustries in America that rely on for-
eign-born labor to provide affordable 
goods and services to our country—in-
dustries like construction, agriculture, 
transportation, to name just a few.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3057 
June 22, 2022 
Consider the healthcare industry. 
Nursing homes depend on a reliable 
supply of immigrant workers to pro-
vide care to the elderly and disabled, 
but since 2019, nursing homes have lost 
more than 15 percent of their work-
force. Today, nearly every nursing 
home in the country—99 percent, ac-
cording to the Wall Street Journal—is 
experiencing staffing shortages. As a 
result, many of them have had to limit 
the number of new clients they accept. 
In the words of one leader in the in-
dustry: 
We’re just looking for people to fill the 
roles that we need. And time and again, we 
find it is the immigrant population that 
tends to respond to us. 
So it is our grandparents who end up 
paying the price for the shortage of 
working-age immigrants, and they are 
not alone. 
If you are in the market for a new 
home, you may have noticed prices are 
prohibitively high, and these sky-
rocketing costs aren’t just hurting po-
tential home buyers; they are hurting 
renters as well. The cost of rent is ac-
tually outpacing inflation in America. 
One obvious way to bring housing 
costs back down to earth is by expand-
ing the supply of homes in America. 
There are plenty of homebuilders who 
are willing to help fill the void, but 
they have got a problem: not enough 
workers. 
Down in Dallas, TX, one homebuilder 
named Joshua Correa has been forced 
to delay home construction projects for 
months because he can’t hire field 
crews. 
In his own words: 
Immigration is very important for our 
workforce in the United States . . . We’re 
feeling [the shortage of workers] . . . and if 
we’re feeling it at the end of the day as 
builders and developers, the consumer pays 
the price. 
From building new homes to pro-
viding healthcare in our homes, we rely 
on immigrants to fill critical roles; and 
in the absence of immigrant workers, 
we as customers end up paying higher 
prices. 
If we want to solve America’s worker 
shortage, we need to drastically in-
crease the number of immigrants we 
welcome into this country. Don’t just 
take it from me. The CEO of the Cham-
ber of Commerce of America has called 
for doubling the number of legal immi-
grants into this country. 
In her words: 
If we can alleviate the worker shortage, it 
might be the fastest thing [we can] do to im-
pact inflation. 
And that is just a short-term benefit 
for fixing America’s broken immigra-
tion system. In the long term, com-
prehensive immigration reform would 
drive America’s economic growth for 
years to come. 
According to the Economic Policy In-
stitute, undocumented immigrants al-
ready pay nearly $12 billion in State 
and local taxes annually, but many of 
them are not on the books. By pro-
viding them with a path to legal sta-
tus, we can double the amount of Fed-
eral tax revenue our Nation collects 
from this group. That is money that 
will fund the construction of roads and 
bridges and which will make Social Se-
curity, Medicare, and Medicaid pay-
ments. That is especially important 
when you consider the growing number 
of senior citizens in America who rely 
on these programs. By the end of this 
decade, more than a fifth of our popu-
lation will be over the age of 65. These 
Americans need a reliable, working-age 
tax base to support them. 
A path to legal status for undocu-
mented immigrants also would boost 
our Nation’s GDP by more than $1 tril-
lion over the next 10 years and create 
hundreds of thousands of jobs. 
Passing immigration reform will also 
help keep America on the cutting edge 
of 
innovation. 
Despite 
our 
former 
President’s 
destructive 
immigration 
policies, America is still one of the top 
destinations 
in 
the 
world 
for 
innovators and entrepreneurs. In fact, 
more than half of our Nation’s billion- 
dollar startups were founded by an im-
migrant. Let me repeat that. More 
than half of our Nation’s billion-dollar 
startups were founded by immigrants. 
Every day that we fail to enact immi-
gration reform, we are allowing a gen-
eration of potential innovators and 
skilled workers to fall through the 
cracks. 
I want to briefly share the story of 
one amazing person who almost fell 
through the cracks. His name is Dr. 
Alfredo Quinones, but he is more com-
monly known as Dr. Q. Today, Dr. Q— 
listen 
to 
this—is 
the 
chair 
of 
neurologic surgery at the Mayo Clinic. 
Decades ago, when he first arrived in 
the United States as a teenager, he was 
an 
undocumented 
farmworker. 
He 
earned little more than $3 an hour 
picking crops in the San Joaquin Val-
ley in California. Eventually, he began 
working as a welder for a railroad. One 
day, he suffered a bad injury after fall-
ing into an empty petroleum tank. 
When he woke up in the hospital, Dr. Q 
decided to pursue his passion. 
He enrolled in the University of Cali-
fornia at Berkeley and wrote his hon-
or’s 
thesis 
on 
neuroscience. 
That 
caught the attention of admissions of-
ficers 
at 
Harvard 
Medical 
School, 
where he was accepted as a student. He 
studied hard and discovered his calling: 
neurosurgery. Today, he removes about 
250 brain tumors every year. Outside of 
the OR, Dr. Q devotes countless hours 
to pioneering research. He has a very 
modest goal—curing cancer—and is ex-
ploring 
novel 
methods, 
like 
using 
human fat cells to fight brain cancer. 
How many other Dr. Qs are out there, 
hiding in the shadows of our immigra-
tion system? Isn’t it time we found 
out? 
In the meantime, I would like to pose 
a simpler question to my Republican 
colleagues: If you are genuinely inter-
ested in addressing inflation, will you 
help us move forward on this issue be-
fore the election? 
Your willingness to work on immi-
gration reform will reveal the answer. 
It is one of the most consequential 
steps we can take to combat inflation. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
INFLATION 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to talk about 
this Joe Biden-caused economic crisis 
that is impacting our country. 
Last week, Joe Biden said his spend-
ing is ‘‘changing people’s lives.’’ Well, 
for once, I am in complete agreement 
with Joe Biden because I have been 
traveling the State of Wyoming this 
past weekend, talking to a lot of peo-
ple, and Joe Biden’s policies have been 
changing people’s lives. Joe Biden’s in-
flation is changing people’s lives for 
the worst. It is costing American fami-
lies about $5,000 more this year than it 
did last year just to break even. Joe 
Biden’s inflation is driving families to 
the breaking point. Right now, work-
ing families all across this country are 
hoping for a summer break. This year’s 
summer break might just break work-
ing families. 
Inflation remains at a 40-year high. 
Prices are going up everywhere—gas 
station, grocery store, and even paying 
rent. Household staples like ground 
beef and chicken—highest prices ever. 
Inflation for eating at a restaurant— 
highest ever recorded. Families are 
paying $100 a week more than they did 
just a year ago just to stay afloat. 
According to a study from the Uni-
versity of Michigan, this is the biggest 
decline in disposable income since Her-
bert Hoover was President—Joe Biden; 
Herbert Hoover. Families’ savings ac-
counts are depleted. We now have the 
lowest savings rate since the great re-
cession. Household debt is breaking 
records. Families are being forced to 
cut back in ways they didn’t think pos-
sible. 
The fastest inflation of all, of course, 
has been on energy. Overall, inflation 
has been nearly 9 percent, but inflation 
for gasoline under Joe Biden is more 
than double—over 100 percent. The 
price of a gallon of gas has more than 
doubled since Joe Biden walked into 
the Oval Office. High energy costs 
mean high costs for everything else. 
High gas prices mean it is harder to get 
goods to the market. Diesel prices are 
also at record highs. Americans depend 
on farmers, and farmers depend on die-
sel. That is just a fact of life. That is 
why America needs energy now more 
than ever, in spite of the policies of Joe 
Biden. 
Rather than producing more energy, 
what does Joe Biden do? He is pro-
ducing one excuse after another. He

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

June 22, 2022 
continues to tighten the stranglehold 
on American energy, making it harder 
and harder to produce American en-
ergy, which is making American en-
ergy even more expensive. 
Last week, Joe Biden, President of 
the United States, sent a threatening 
letter to American energy companies. 
Now, he claims he wants more energy, 
but his actions speak much louder than 
the words he writes or speaks because 
Joe Biden has done just about every-
thing possible to keep American energy 
buried in the ground. He has blocked so 
many different ways to get American 
energy out of the ground and to refin-
eries and to export or to production. In 
fact, his Secretary of the Interior ex-
plicitly made that a campaign promise 
when she was running for Congress. 
The Secretary of the Interior—con-
firmed by the Democrats, opposed by 
me—promised to keep American en-
ergy in the ground. Well, that is ex-
actly what Joe Biden is doing and hav-
ing her do. 
By one estimate, Joe Biden has taken 
more than 100 actions, since he has 
been President, restricting American 
energy. It all started his first day in of-
fice. In the first few hours as President, 
Joe Biden killed the Keystone XL Pipe-
line—killed it flat—and then bragged 
about it. The Keystone Pipeline would 
have meant 800,000 barrels of oil deliv-
ered to this country each and every 
day, coming in from Canada. 
But that wasn’t enough, no. A few 
days later, Joe Biden made another an-
nouncement of his anti-American en-
ergy policy. He announced he was 
going to put a pause on all new oil and 
gas leases on Federal land. Bragging 
about Keystone, announcing a pause on 
leases on Federal land, and now here 
we are after 17 months in office—none. 
But Barack Obama by this time had 
done 44 Federal energy leases. Not a 
single one by Joe Biden—no, not one. 
He has also shut down energy explo-
ration near the Arctic. All you need to 
do is talk to the senior Senator, whom 
I share time with on the Energy Com-
mittee, 
Senator 
MURKOWSKI, 
about 
what is going on there, and she will tell 
you how Joe Biden has shut down en-
ergy in the Arctic. He has kept more 
than 4,300 drilling applications col-
lecting dust on his desk. 
His energy agenda is far, far to the 
left of any previous American Presi-
dent. His energy agenda, amazingly, is 
far to the left of Hillary Clinton’s agen-
da when she was running in 2016—fur-
ther to the left than Hillary. This is 
the most anti-American energy agenda 
in American history, and Joe Biden 
owns it. 
When he says he wants us to produce 
more, no one believes him. No one be-
lieves this President. You look at any 
poll numbers—people do not believe 
Joe Biden when he speaks, and people 
have stopped listening to him. The 
American people believe with their 
own two eyes and their empty wallets. 
They drive by the gas station, look at 
the price up there, and say: It is only 
going up. 
If you want to know what Joe Biden 
really thinks, just look at what he 
does; just listen to the people he has 
surrounded himself with. His anointed 
climate 
spokesman—and 
I 
mean 
anointed—is one John Kerry. 
John Kerry said last week: ‘‘We abso-
lutely don’t’’ need more oil, gas, and 
coal—‘‘absolutely don’t’’ need. That is 
the position of this administration and 
the President of the United States. He 
is happy with high prices. John Kerry 
thinks we can just get rid of fossil fuels 
immediately. 
These people are living a fairy tale. 
They are in a cocoon of self-delusion. 
That is what is going on at this White 
House. Joe Biden’s fantasy of ending 
oil and gas is just that—a fantasy. 
He wants every American in an elec-
tric vehicle. There are not enough bat-
teries; don’t have enough charging sta-
tions; don’t have enough of these vehi-
cles. Even the Secretary of Transpor-
tation—he bought one of these. He 
bought it from Mexico, according to 
the news reports, and it got recalled, 
along with 49,000 other electric vehi-
cles, because the battery didn’t work. 
The battery was not reliable. Pete 
Buttigieg—Mayor Pete—went from fill-
ing potholes in a small town in Indiana 
to becoming the world’s highest paid 
salesman of electric vehicles, but yet 
his own one failed him. 
The Biden administration is con-
vinced they are making an ‘‘incredible 
transition.’’ This isn’t science; this is 
science fiction. 
Last week, Joe Biden’s Press Sec-
retary was asked why the President 
wasn’t going to ‘‘drill more here at 
home.’’ After all, that is what the 
American people are calling for. That 
is what the economists say is a prob-
lem. Why aren’t you drilling more at 
home? She says: Oh, ‘‘[w]e don’t need 
to do that.’’ They don’t seem to care 
how high energy prices go, what the 
cost of gasoline is, because they live in 
a pure level of electric vehicles. 
Earlier 
today, 
the 
President 
re-
quested a pause on the gas tax until 
right before the election. This is the 
tax that funds our Federal roads and 
bridges. As a former member of the En-
vironment and Public Works Com-
mittee, I know how important the 
highway trust fund is. It helps repair 
roads, bridges, and builds highways. 
Joe Biden doesn’t seem to care about 
that part of it. He said: Oh, let’s just 
call a pause of 181⁄2 cents a gallon. It is 
a gimmick. It is a gimmick that won’t 
have very much effect on gas prices be-
cause gas prices would still be double 
what they were when Joe Biden took 
office even if you take off 181⁄2 cents. 
Let me remind the American public 
that today gasoline prices on average 
are $4.95 a gallon. It is more than dou-
ble what it was the day he took office. 
We are up about $2.50 for each and 
every gallon, and Joe Biden thinks: 
Well, you remove 18 cents, and we will 
call it good. What a fantasy. 
Democrat economist Larry Summers 
has called this idea by the President of 
the United States—and let me point 
out that Larry Summers was Bill Clin-
ton’s Secretary of Treasury, economic 
adviser to Barack Obama, and presi-
dent of Harvard University, and he 
says that what Joe Biden is doing—he 
called it ‘‘shortsighted, ineffective, 
goofy and gimmicky.’’ That is about 
what we are getting from this Presi-
dent of the United States—goofiness 
and gimmicks. 
Back in 2008, even President Obama 
said the idea was a gimmick. He ought 
to have credibility with the Democrats. 
You would think Joe Biden might have 
listened to him; he was his Vice Presi-
dent. President Obama said: This idea 
isn’t ‘‘designed to get you through the 
summer, it’s designed to get them 
through an election.’’ 
What about the Speaker of the 
House, NANCY PELOSI? She is a big Joe 
Biden fan. This is what she said of the 
idea. The thing the President proposed 
today, she said, is ‘‘very showbiz’’— 
‘‘very showbiz.’’ She said: It looks like 
you are doing something, ‘‘[b]ut it is 
not necessarily landing in the pocket 
of the consumer.’’ 
So Joe Biden wants to look busy. It 
is not what the American people are 
seeing, and in so many ways, they have 
tuned him out. The American people 
see the price of gasoline. They see it 
every time they drive by a gas station. 
At the same time, Senate Democrats 
want to raise taxes on American en-
ergy. That is what we hear from the 
Senate Democrats. 
What is your solution? 
Well, we are going to raise taxes on 
American energy. 
Oh, sounds good. 
Higher taxes mean higher prices—it 
is that simple. Higher taxes on pro-
ducers of oil and gas ultimately get 
passed on to the consumers. I am not 
sure what people don’t understand 
about that. 
NANCY PELOSI admitted that as well. 
A few months ago, she admitted that 
‘‘a tax on production . . . the con-
sumers [will] pay for that.’’ 
Look, Democrats are so desperate to 
try to do something, throwing one Hail 
Mary pass after another, they are now 
denying the laws of supply and de-
mand. The Senate Democrats act like 
these prices come out of thin air. 
Prices are the result of supply and de-
mand. Right now, the supply is too low 
to meet the demand of the American 
people. If you want lower prices, you 
have to increase the supply, and we can 
do that by producing American energy. 
High energy costs are driving up in-
flation all across the country. It is 
triggering a cascade of crises. The 
stock market is down 20 percent. Sen-
iors and retirees are watching their 
savings evaporate, melt away. 
Last 
week, 
the 
Federal 
Reserve 
raised interest rates for the third time 
since March. Each increase has been 
larger than the last one. This latest in-
crease is the largest increase in the 
Fed rate in 30 years. 
Oh, there is no question this is going 
to slow down the economy. So why is

June 22, 2022 
the Federal Reserve doing something 
that is going to slow down the econ-
omy? Well, there is one reason: infla-
tion under Joe Biden and the big- 
spending Democrats. That is the reason 
inflation is running rampant. There 
were trillions of dollars thrown onto 
the fire of inflation—inflation denied 
by the President, ignored by the Presi-
dent, dismissed by the President for 
month after month after month, and 
now the American people are living 
with inflation they cannot escape. 
So the Federal Reserve has only one 
choice. It is throwing on the emer-
gency brake. It may still be too late to 
prevent a crash. The economy is bar-
reling toward recession. Economists on 
both sides of the aisle say that, and Joe 
Biden the other day said, oh, he wasn’t 
worried about that coming along. 
A recession is a complete halt to eco-
nomic growth for half a year. If you 
have a recession, you still have higher 
prices with lower economic growth. We 
would still have higher prices, and peo-
ple won’t have the money to pay them. 
Right now, the Federal Reserve is 
taking desperate measures to counter-
act what Democrats have done. As a re-
sult, mortgage rates have already dou-
bled this year. Mortgage applications 
have been cut dramatically. Older 
Americans are delaying their dreams of 
retirement. Younger Americans are 
giving up on their dreams of owning a 
home. 
It is no wonder consumer confidence 
in Joe Biden in the Nation right now is 
at an alltime low. Joe Biden, who ear-
lier had been compared to Herbert Hoo-
ver in terms of what people are saying 
about both of them, has an even lower 
approval rating on inflation than did 
Jimmy Carter. 
Joe Biden wants to blame everybody 
but himself. Yet the American people 
are right when they point the finger 
and blame Joe Biden. With record in-
flation, record debt, and looming reces-
sion, now is not the time to do what 
the Democrats want to do, which is 
raise taxes. Democrats need to reverse 
course, stop the reckless spending, and 
above all, unleash American energy. 
Joe Biden should rip up his letter to 
energy companies and get to work: 
hold energy lease sales, approve the 
4,300 drilling applications still sitting 
in limbo in the Biden White House, ap-
prove more pipelines, speed up the ap-
proval process. The American people, 
right 
now, 
are 
feeling 
stuck 
and 
stressed and squeezed, and the best this 
President can do is say: Let’s take a 
holiday from gas taxes for 3 months— 
when prices are up over $2.60 a gallon 
from the day he took office. And he 
wants to alleviate 18 cents of the pain. 
It is time for the Democrats to re-
verse course. We will see if Joe Biden 
listens. The Democrats are refusing to 
listen. Americans are paying a very 
high price today, and the Democrats, 
across the board, are going to pay a 
very high price in November when peo-
ple go to the polls. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
BALDWIN). The junior Senator from 
West Virginia. 
ENERGY 
Mrs. CAPITO. Madam President, in 
March, I spoke here on the Senate floor 
about the highest reported gasoline 
prices ever. At that time, according to 
AAA, the average price in West Vir-
ginia, my home State, was $4.12. Well, 
today—today—West Virginia’s average 
is up to $4.90 while the national aver-
age is $4.96. 
Last week, the national average for a 
gallon of gas was more than $5—more 
than $5. Think about that. And, worse, 
these high gas prices hit our hardest 
working Americans the hardest. As 
Axios reported, ‘‘Americans who earn 
less than $50,000 a year are currently 
spending . . . 10% of their credit card 
bills on gas, compared with 6% for 
those households earning . . . $125,000.’’ 
These prices are not sustainable for 
the American families, especially when 
you consider not only gas, but with 
out-of-control inflation, they are bat-
tling gas, electricity, groceries, and 
other necessities. 
As the New York Times reported, 
‘‘Prices climbed 8.6 percent in the year 
through May, a reacceleration of infla-
tion that makes it increasingly dif-
ficult for consumers to afford everyday 
purchases.’’ 
So people ask me: How did we get 
here? Unfortunately, we shouldn’t be 
surprised, even if it is hard to imagine 
that things would get this bad. From 
the earliest days of his Presidential 
campaign, President Biden promised to 
be anti-American-energy. As President, 
his policies and personnel choices have 
delivered on his campaign promises, 
and high prices are just part of the bar-
gain, as they would say. 
The 
administration 
has 
canceled 
pipelines, rescinded previously issued 
approvals 
for 
other 
pipelines, 
and 
raised barriers to building new ones. 
They have frozen oil and gas leasing 
and proposed raising royalties—costs 
that are passed on to every consumer 
and, remember, those hardest working 
Americans who are now paying 10 per-
cent of their income. 
They are revising the NEPA process, 
which is the environmental review 
process, undoing the streamlining that 
was done during 2020 to speed up 
project delivery. That means faster 
pipelines, faster infrastructure devel-
opment of all kinds. Biden’s EPA has 
hammered small refineries, including 
the one in my State, by denying hard-
ship relief that could immediately help 
lower fuel prices. And Biden’s EPA has 
also recently announced a proposal 
under section 401 of the Clean Water 
Act to make it easier for activists to 
work 
to 
prevent 
infrastructure 
projects. 
Then there is the regulation on the 
power sector. The EPA has publicly an-
nounced plans to slam the electricity 
sector—already the most regulated sec-
tor by EPA—with a fresh new slate of 
new requirements. 
The damaging policies I have laid out 
today have led to the energy crisis and 
skyrocketing energy and electricity 
prices that we face today. These poli-
cies are going to continue to fan the 
flames of this crisis, making it worse 
and not better. As costs continue to 
climb and energy production gets more 
expensive—thanks to this regulatory 
assault—utility operators are already 
warning of blackouts this summer. Op-
erators are under tremendous strain, 
thanks to the Biden administration’s 
policies. 
So what has the White House done to 
address this crisis? Well, I think 
GasBuddy petroleum analyst Patrick 
De Haan said it well: 
White House begs all companies to improve 
situation. Can we drill? We’d rather you not. 
Can we build a refinery? We’d rather you 
not. Can we build a pipeline? We’d rather you 
not. Just make it better. 
So it is no wonder that all of these 
mixed messages have industry and in-
vestors confused. I am confused. The 
American public is confused why no-
body woke up to what was going on 
here—and the President in the White 
House. The administration made re-
leases from the Strategic Petroleum 
Reserve. What good did that do? It 
hasn’t started to abate the steady rise 
in gas prices. They have pointed fingers 
at energy producers and refiners with 
claims of price-gouging. They have 
pointed fingers at Vladimir Putin, de-
spite the fact that gas prices were 
steadily rising months before the inva-
sion of Ukraine. 
The White House is content to keep 
finger-pointing while refusing to take 
responsibility for their own actions. 
They know their actions are causing 
pain. They know, with these policies 
and pledges from our climate czar John 
Kerry to stop using our own American 
fuels, they are chilling investments 
that we need today. For example, who 
would make a billion-dollar, 40-year in-
vestment in the refining capacity we 
desperately need today when John 
Kerry promises that oil and gas invest-
ments will be ‘‘stranded assets.’’ 
Nothing the White House has prom-
ised will fix these kinds of issues. The 
President himself says energy pro-
ducers should take immediate action 
to increase the supply of gas. Yet his 
advisers in the White House are coun-
seling everyone otherwise. In effect and 
in the messages they send, this is going 
to make things worse. 
This administration is fiercely deter-
mined to kill the oil and gas industry 
and baseload power sector in this coun-
try rule by rule, Executive action by 
Executive action. And the hard-work-
ing Americans are paying for it at the 
pump. 
The 
American 
people 
are 
really 
smart. They see what is happening 
here. The Democrats want to layer on 
more regulations and legislation that 
will keep passing more and more costs 
on to those consumers, those hard- 
working Americans who are paying 10 
percent monthly from their monthly

earnings. All the while, the Biden ad-
ministration is working as hard as it 
can to shutter coal and natural gas en-
ergy production and electricity. 
Do you know what? Without a 180-de-
gree turn on several actions I have laid 
out, we can expect costs to stay high 
and blackouts and brownouts to occur. 
Americans deserve better. I am an 
optimist. Americans deserve better. 
I ask the administration to reverse 
course on some of these policies I have 
outlined and to put the livelihoods and 
the quality of life of our constituents 
first. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from Maryland. 
50TH ANNIVERSARY OF TITLE IX 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I 
take this time to celebrate the 50th an-
niversary of the enactment of title IX. 
It was passed and enacted on June 23, 
50 years ago, when President Nixon 
signed 
title 
IX 
of 
the 
Education 
Amendments of 1972 into law, which ex-
plicitly added the following sex dis-
crimination provision into the law: 
No person in the United States shall, on 
the basis of sex, be excluded from partici-
pating in, be denied the benefits of, or be 
subjected to discrimination under any edu-
cation program or activity receiving Federal 
financial assistance. 
Broadly speaking, title IX prohibits 
any institution that receives Federal 
education funding from discriminating 
against students or employees on the 
basis of sex. 
Today, I would like to reflect on how 
far we have come in terms of com-
bating sex discrimination in the United 
States, how far we still need to go, and 
what steps we can take as we strive to 
guarantee equal rights and equal jus-
tice under the law for all Americans, 
regardless of their gender identifica-
tion or sexual orientation. 
Sex discrimination comes in many 
forms and historically has included dis-
crimination based on pregnancy or sex 
stereotypes. We have seen sex discrimi-
nation that includes sexual harassment 
in our schools and in the workplace, 
dating violence, and sex-based stalk-
ing. Such sexual harassment and dis-
crimination often leads to higher rates 
of depression, anxiety, and suicide at-
tempts for the women affected and can 
lead to higher rates of dropping out of 
school. 
Congress responded, in part, by pass-
ing the Violence Against Women Act in 
1994 and recently reauthorizing it and 
strengthening it in 2022. 
Title IX is certainly responsible for 
much of the progress women have made 
in the last half a century. Today, 
women earn nearly 60 percent of the 
doctoral, master’s, bachelor’s, and as-
sociate degrees conferred in this Na-
tion. A stubborn disparity still exists, 
however, with respect to women—and, 
in particular, women of color—earning 
science, technology, engineering, and 
math—STEM—degrees. 
In terms of sports, we have seen an 
enormous increase in women and girls 
participating in athletic activities, 
with more than a 1,000-percent increase 
in high school-level sports and a 600- 
percent 
increase 
in 
collegiate-level 
sports—an increase that helps them de-
velop leadership and teamwork skills 
and, in some cases, earn athletic schol-
arships and become professional ath-
letes. 
In professions where women rep-
resent a majority of employees, women 
are still held back from obtaining lead-
ership positions. For example, women 
represent more than three-quarters of 
the entire healthcare workforce, yet 
just 27 percent of chief executive offi-
cer positions in our hospital systems. 
Looking at title IX progress and the 
road ahead, the National Coalition for 
Women and Girls in Education, the Na-
tional Women’s Law Center, and others 
recently released a report, ‘‘Title IX at 
50.’’ The report takes a look at title 
IX’s impact over the last half a cen-
tury, 
celebrating 
the 
significant 
progress to end sex discrimination in 
education while recognizing the work 
that remains to be done. 
Let me quote from that report: 
Despite the tremendous progress towards 
gender equity in the last 50 years, students 
today continue to be deprived of their edu-
cation because of sex discrimination. . . . 
Schools are not adequately protecting stu-
dents from sexual harassment, sex- and race- 
based discipline, and discrimination based on 
their sexual orientation, gender identity, or 
pregnancy or parenting status. Twenty per-
cent of girls have been victims of sexual as-
sault or attempted sexual assault while in 
high school, and 1 in 5 women and 1 in 4 
transgender or gender nonconforming stu-
dents are sexually assaulted on college cam-
puses. 
Women and girls and LGBTQI+ students 
continue to face sex discrimination in ath-
letics, in STEM and [career and technical 
education] programs, and in sex-segregated 
classrooms and schools. 
We still have progress that we need 
to achieve. 
I support the U.S. Department of 
Education’s effort to undo the Trump 
administration’s weakening of civil 
rights protections for student survivors 
and to ensure the protection of the 
LGBTQ community and students in the 
face of mounting violent threats, hate-
ful rhetoric, and cruel attacks from 
State officials. 
As the Women’s Law Center com-
mented recently on the enhanced title 
IX protections: 
We urge the swift release of a robust pro-
posed rule by the Department of Education 
by the 50th anniversary of Title IX on June 
23, 2022. . . . Students are protesting across 
the country, demanding that their schools 
meaningfully address sex-based harassment; 
they are in desperate need of Title IX’s full 
protections. The proposed rule is critical to 
begin the regulatory process for undoing the 
harmful changes made to the Title IX rule in 
2020 [by the Trump administration] . . . and 
to address mounting threats to LGBTQI+ 
students and school communities. While sex- 
based harassment in schools remains perva-
sive, the 2020 Rule pushes schools to ignore 
many instances of sex-based harassment, 
leaving scores of survivors without recourse 
. . . [which] are harmful to student sur-
vivors, [and] deter reporting. These harms 
especially fall on women and girls of color, 
disabled survivors, LGBTQI+ survivors, and 
pregnant and parenting survivors, all who 
face stereotypes casting them as less cred-
ible when they report sexual misconduct. 
As I said, we still have a road ahead 
of us. 
Let me close by saying that when it 
comes to equality for women in our 
laws and Constitution, there should be 
no deadline on equality. Most Ameri-
cans already think the Equal Rights 
Amendment is part of our Constitu-
tion. The needed 38 States have com-
pleted their legal ratification. We now 
need to remove any ambiguity and fi-
nally complete the ratification of the 
28th amendment to our Constitution. 
I have introduced bipartisan legisla-
tion with Senator MURKOWSKI, S.J. 
Res. 1, which would rescind the ERA 
arbitrary ratification deadline. The 
House has passed this legislation, and 
it has 51 cosponsors in the Senate. 
After the Equal Rights Amendment 
itself was first passed by the Senate in 
1972, Congress changed the 7-year dead-
line to 10 years, setting a precedent for 
such activity and authority. There is 
no deadline in the ERA itself. Legal en-
actment of the Equal Rights Amend-
ment to the Constitution should take 
place 2 years after two-thirds of the 
House and Senate and three-fourths of 
the States ratify. Nevada ratified the 
ERA in March of 2017; Illinois, in May 
of 2018; and Virginia, the 38th State, in 
January of 2020. 
Article V of the Constitution con-
tains no time limits for the ratification 
of amendments. The States finally 
ratified the 27th Amendment in 1992 re-
garding congressional pay raises more 
than 200 years after Congress proposed 
it in 1789 as part of the original Bill of 
Rights. That amendment is now part of 
our Constitution. The ERA time limit 
was contained in a joint resolution, not 
the actual text of the amendment. 
The ERA would simply provide that 
‘‘equality of rights under law shall not 
be denied or abridged by the United 
States or any State on account of sex.’’ 
The amendment also provides that 
‘‘Congress shall have the power to en-
force, by appropriate legislation, the 
provisions of this article.’’ 
Just like with title IX, women are 
not asking for privileges; they are sim-
ply asking to be treated equally under 
the law and to be afforded the same 
legal rights as men under the law. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 4261 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, I return 
to the floor of the Senate again today 
to ask that this body take immediate 
action—action needed—to address our 
Nation’s massive baby formula short-
age. 
For months, American moms and 
dads have been scouring supermarkets 
and drugstores looking for baby for-
mula. Anxiety-ridden parents are fran-
tically checking online stores and 
pleading with family and friends, try-
ing to figure out how to ship, purchase, 
and otherwise procure baby formula. 
Still, some families must hospitalize 
their babies because they can’t find 
formula. Yes, they are hospitalizing 
them for that reason alone. 
Inexcusably, the crisis has only got-
ten worse. In May alone, reports show 
that the out-of-stock rate jumped from 
43 percent to a staggering 73 percent 
nationally. 
In Utah, my State—the State with 
the largest families, the most children 
per capita, and the highest birthrate in 
the Nation—reports show that out-of- 
stock rate to be as high as 88.9 percent. 
Desperate parents are now resorting 
to places like Facebook Marketplace, 
buying from unknown sellers at exorbi-
tant markups. The failure of the Biden 
administration’s photo-op policy has 
not so much as put a dent—even a tiny 
dent—in this problem. 
Now, initially, the White House said 
that parents should ‘‘ask your pediatri-
cian, who may have formula samples or 
possible alternatives,’’ as if that were 
somehow a solution. 
This hollow nonresponse was embar-
rassing enough, but, tragically, the ad-
ministration’s response has not im-
proved with time, in the time that has 
passed since that statement was made. 
When the question came up again, the 
White House press secretary spent 
nearly 20 seconds flipping through a 
binder, only to respond with: ‘‘I don’t 
have anything new.’’ 
That response is simply unaccept-
able. It is unacceptable for the Amer-
ican people generally and especially for 
those 
families 
dealing 
with 
this 
inexplicably, needlessly prolonged cri-
sis. 
By failing to act, we are leaving par-
ents in an unimaginable situation dur-
ing one of the most stressful and 
impactful times of life. Worse, they 
have received no discernible answers 
from their elected officials. The White 
House’s website lays the blame solely 
on Abbott’s plant closure in Michigan 
‘‘due to safety concerns from the 
FDA.’’ 
Now, this is a very limited, narrow 
line of thinking. The FDA regularly re-
calls other food products, but none of 
those recalls happens to result in 
shortages of this magnitude or this sig-
nificance 
with 
such 
weighty 
con-
sequences on the youngest of Ameri-
cans. 
Look, it doesn’t have to be this way. 
There are a lot of weighty problems 
that we address in the U.S. Senate that 
are seemingly unsolvable, intractable, 
or, at least, very, very difficult to solve 
because they involve things that very 
often are beyond our ability to control. 
This is not one of those problems. 
This is within our grasp. It is within 
our control. In fact, the government is 
the problem. Government caused it, 
and by turning certain levers, govern-
ment can relieve this problem and do 
so in a very short period of time. This 
suffering is unnecessarily being pro-
longed by the government itself. 
So the Senate can help these fami-
lies, these American families strug-
gling with this crisis, by immediately 
passing my bill called the FORMULA 
Act. 
This bill responds to the crisis in 
three simple ways to help solve the cri-
sis at hand and feed American babies. 
First, my bill would suspend tariff 
collection on currently allowed for-
mula imports. We tax imported for-
mula at a rate of at least 17.5 percent 
upon entering the United States. It can 
roughly double to about 35 percent, de-
pending on the circumstances of the 
shipment. We can help ease the sky-
rocketing prices and encourage compa-
nies to import as much baby formula 
as possible or as much as demand with-
in the market requires by simply sus-
pending for a period of 6 months this 
tariff collection. 
Look, the administration has ac-
knowledged 
there 
are 
appropriate 
times to suspend the collection of cer-
tain taxes. For example, it is currently 
proposing suspending the gasoline tax 
for a period of 3 months. Surely, it is 
not the Biden White House’s position 
that gasoline is more important than 
feeding infants. 
Second, my bill would temporarily 
allow formula imports from several 
safe countries like those in Europe. 
This would enable us to access plenti-
ful formula supplies from abroad and 
meet our current needs with that. 
Now, allowing these imports is not 
going to endanger American babies. 
The manufacturing plants in question 
are already approved and are already 
regulated by their home countries. And 
the only plants that operate in coun-
tries and subject to authorities that 
are comparable to those imposed by 
our own Food and Drug Administra-
tion, these are countries from which we 
already import pharmaceutical prod-
ucts. 
The fact is that parents have already 
begun taking matters into their own 
hands, often with dire consequences. 
We are hearing reports of parents re-
sorting to online homemade recipes for 
formula that they then feed to their in-
fants. Infant hospitalizations due to 
malnutrition are correspondingly in-
creasing as a direct result of these ac-
tivities and the shortages from which 
they stem. 
Doctors have voiced their concerns 
that homemade formulas can lead to 
liver and kidney issues and, in some 
cases, even heart failure. Some fami-
lies have tried diluting the formula 
that they are able to access with more 
water, a tactic that health experts 
warn can lead to brain swelling and 
organ failure. 
Some doctors refer to this shortage 
as ‘‘the worst crisis they have experi-
enced in their careers.’’ They have to 
place dehydrated children on IV fluids, 
which isn’t, of course, a long-term so-
lution; it is an acute and dire response 
to 
a 
life-threatening 
emergency 
brought about through an artificial 
government constraint on the market. 
These 
short-term 
consequences 
are 
scary enough. They are scary enough 
for the moms and dads, to say nothing 
of the horrors the children, the infants, 
experience in the process. We still 
don’t know what the long-term effects 
of these might be to the babies. 
Those worried about the formula 
quality may find solace in the fact that 
my bill retains the FDA’s authority to 
recall foreign formulas in the very un-
likely event that these safety issues 
arise. Remember, these are formulas 
produced in facilities in countries from 
which we already import pharma-
ceutical products based on our coun-
try’s trust and confidence that their 
safety and quality standards are as se-
cure as, if not more stringent than, our 
own. 
Additionally, my bill only calls for 
importing formula that is lawfully 
marketed and approved in select for-
eign countries. Again, private citizens 
are already doing this. The law already 
allows the personal importation of 
baby formula, meaning somebody can 
jump online and order it on their own, 
and parents are voluntarily choosing to 
do so because they have done the re-
search and they trust that it is safe for 
their baby. 
They understand, as we do, that ba-
bies in France and Switzerland and of 
the United Kingdom are not different 
than babies in the United States of 
America. 
Formula 
that 
works 
for 
them, that is safe and healthy for 
them, is proven safe and healthy and 
effective for them for many, many dec-
ades is also going to work with respect 
to an American baby. My bill would 
just make this easier and more afford-
able for parents, you see, because to be 
one of those parents, you have got to 
have a degree of sophistication to know 
what you are looking for. Most people 
aren’t really aware of the fact that 
they could jump online and order this.

Secondly, it is really expensive to do 
it. They can’t buy in bulk, and it re-
quires extra shipping and handling 
costs that makes this prohibitively ex-
pensive for many people, even the 
lucky ones who become aware that it is 
even an option. 
So my bill isn’t making something 
legal that is currently illegal in that 
respect; it is simply making it more af-
fordable. It is making it so that we no 
longer limit access to these foreign for-
mulas—foreign 
top-quality 
formulas 
from places like France and Switzer-
land and the United Kingdom. They 
will be available to poor and middle- 
class 
families, 
and 
not 
just 
the 
wealthy. 
Finally, my bill would allow WIC pro-
gram recipients to buy whatever brand 
of formula is available with WIC 
vouchers. My bill will allow these par-
ents to buy from available stock and 
feed their children and guarantees 
greater flexibility. 
You see, the existing formula crisis 
has been exacerbated by virtue of the 
fact that the WIC formula—the WIC 
beneficiaries are given a voucher. Very 
often, that voucher limits them to pro-
curing only that brand of formula spec-
ified on the voucher itself, which, in 
many instances, might be out of stock. 
This would eliminate that problem. 
Keeping American infants fed should 
be one of the least controversial pro-
posals imaginable, especially because 
this is something that can be done eas-
ily. We can bring about almost imme-
diate relief to these American parents 
and especially to their babies, just by 
not causing the problem anymore or, 
at least, waiting for a few months be-
fore causing this problem again. 
In the meantime, the hope and the 
expectation is that the American for-
mula industry can retool, revamp, and 
get back in the practice of producing in 
sufficient quantities that they will be 
able to meet the demand, but we need 
6 months in order to do that. 
American babies are going hungry 
and the Federal Government is the 
problem. The Federal Government is 
causing these babies to starve and oth-
erwise suffer. 
My FORMULA Act will help solve 
the formula crisis and ensure that 
American babies do not go unfed. 
Look, there is a reason why we see 
this crisis here, but not in any of our 
neighbor countries, not in any of our 
peer countries. No, the crisis exists 
here because this is a feature of U.S. 
law. We can fix this problem. We can 
help solve this crisis today. We can 
make sure Americans babies’ cries do 
not go unanswered. We can and must 
pass my FORMULA Act. 
So, as if in legislative session, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of Calendar No. 372, S. 4261; that 
the bill be considered read a third time 
and passed; and that the motion to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I rise 
to object to the Senator from Utah’s 
request. 
I understand his concern and the con-
cern of the people in both parties, both 
sides of the aisle here in the Senate, to 
take action on this infant formula 
challenge that so many families are 
suffering through right now. The unfor-
tunate part about this proposal is that 
this will put babies at risk in ways 
that we don’t even fully understand 
right now. 
There is bipartisan concern, and the 
evidence for that is the action of com-
mittees—bipartisan work in several 
committees, including the Agriculture 
Committee as well as the Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions Com-
mittee—bipartisan work to meet this 
crisis. And the focus of that work has 
been to get formula on shelves as soon 
as possible. 
It is important to remember how our 
Nation’s formula crisis began. Abbott’s 
recall—the manufacturer—the recall 
and the closure came after as many as 
nine infants died from contaminated 
formula. That is how this started, con-
taminated formula. 
Now, we can and we should get to the 
bottom of the abject failures that led 
to contaminated formula hitting the 
shelves. I have been working on this for 
months—many months before this cri-
sis came to a head—but we can’t forget 
our top priority here when it comes to 
protecting infants. We have got to keep 
our Nation’s most vulnerable, these in-
fants, safe. 
And it is pretty clear that the Food 
and Drug Administration bears respon-
sibility for dropping the ball in so 
many ways in terms of inspections, but 
still, even despite that failure, the FDA 
standards are the best in the world. 
As I mentioned, the Agriculture and 
HELP Committees have already done 
bipartisan work. And I think when you 
saw the hearings that took place, espe-
cially in the Health, Education, Labor, 
and Pensions Committee, there was bi-
partisan condemnation of the Food and 
Drug Administration and bipartisan 
calls for accountability at the Food 
and Drug Administration. And they 
should be hit very hard in terms of the 
accountability that should be imposed 
and must be imposed on the FDA. Un-
fortunately, this bill will completely 
disregard the FDA standards for safety 
which would put our children at risk. 
I would also mention the HELP Com-
mittee’s work marking up a bill last 
week, an FDA bill, with amendments 
allowing importation during the short-
age with appropriate guardrails to en-
sure formula is safe for our Nation’s in-
fants. These bipartisan amendments 
represent a more appropriate path for-
ward than this approach today to limit 
the FDA’s ability to protect our in-
fants. 
Now is not the time to completely 
abandon safety standards. We need to 
do everything we can to get formula 
back on shelves, but we can’t com-
promise safety at any cost. 
Here are just some examples. Go to 
the FDA’s website under the Food and 
Drug Administration’s Center for Food 
Safety and Applied Nutrition. Here are 
a few examples from their database. 
In July 2016, a 4-week-old baby in the 
United States was fed a stage 1 infant 
milk product approved in nearly all the 
countries described in the Senator’s 
bill but not in the United States. After 
consuming the formula, the baby expe-
rienced diarrhea, fever, vomiting, and 
lethargy. The baby ended up in the 
emergency room where he was diag-
nosed with a salmonella infection. 
Second example, January 2017: A 1- 
month-old baby was similarly poisoned 
by a product approved by the countries 
in this bill but not legally marketed in 
the United States, and that baby began 
vomiting. 
In January 2019, a 5-month-old began 
experiencing upper abdominal pain and 
diarrhea after consuming another such 
product. That is just a small example. 
These concerns are why the Amer-
ican Academy of Pediatrics for years 
has warned against importing formula 
from Europe. The Academy has pub-
lished articles highlighting the dangers 
of buying imported baby formulas and 
advising against doing so. So despite 
all this, the Senator and others want to 
go forward with this bill. 
Here is the good news—the only good 
news in the short run. Here is the good 
news. We don’t have to compromise 
safety standards to increase the sup-
ply. 
We already know that the adminis-
tration’s Operation Fly Formula is 
bringing 
formula 
into 
the 
United 
States at a pretty rapid clip—32 flights, 
19 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents of 
formula. That is not the end of it. The 
FDA right now is using enforcement 
discretion to allow the importation of 
additional select formula through nor-
mal distribution channels, bolstering 
the domestic supply of safe and nutri-
tious formula by over 220 million 8- 
ounce bottle equivalents. Add the two 
of them together, and you have almost 
240 million bottles, many of which have 
already been imported safely. 
The administration is also taking 
other steps to increase formula produc-
tion domestically by invoking the De-
fense Production Act to prioritize crit-
ical ingredients and manufacturing 
supplies for infant formula production. 
So steps are being taken, but we can-
not—when we are invoking these pow-
ers of the executive branch or enacting 
legislation, we cannot compromise on 
safety. We have to have the highest 
safety standards in the world, which we 
do, and we have got to make sure that 
we adhere to those safety standards. 
So I object. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
OSSOFF). Objection is heard. 
The Senator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I appreciate 
the insight and the always thoughtful 
counsel of my distinguished friend and 
colleague, the Senator from Pennsyl-
vania. I always enjoy working with

him. He is a voice of reason and is a de-
light to work with. 
I do feel compelled to respond to a 
few of his points. Now, yes, it is true, 
there are ambitious plans to fly for-
mula over. They used the Defense Pro-
duction Act to do that, to have the 
government to act. And the ambitious 
plans that he describes have yet to ma-
terialize. What we have to look at is 
the bottles that are available now, that 
have been flown over now, that are 
here now as a result of that program, is 
about 13 million bottles. Do you know 
what the average daily consumption of 
formula is in America? Nine million. 
So this buys us a day and a half of for-
mula—a day and a half—and it is still 
not solving the problem. So that is not 
a solution. 
As to the objection related to the 
FDA’s regs, he points to the safety con-
cerns and highlights a few adverse inci-
dent reports not necessarily linked to 
the formula itself but things that peo-
ple experienced as they were switching 
formulas. A lot of the symptoms that 
he described—all of them, in fact, as I 
understand it—including lethargy, di-
arrhea, and some of those have been 
linked to babies switching formula. So, 
yes, when a baby switches formula, 
whether it is from one American brand 
to another or an American brand to a 
European brand, it is not uncommon 
during this transition period for babies 
to react that way. 
Now, I wish—we wish—that it wasn’t 
necessary for them to switch to begin 
with. This was unnecessary to make 
them switch. In fact, another point 
that I need to refute that he made at 
the outset about formula being respon-
sible for the contamination, for the 
food-borne illness, it was, in fact, not 
the formula itself that caused it. In 
fact, an FDA investigation revealed 
that it wasn’t the formula. It was a 
source of bottled water that had itself 
been contaminated, and it was that 
bottled water that the parents were 
mixing with the formula that turned 
out to be contaminated, by no fault of 
their own but also by no fault of the 
manufacturer. So we have got to keep 
straight exactly what happened here 
and what didn’t happen. 
Finally, with regard to the safety 
risks, I understand this, and it is im-
portant that we be safe in doing this. 
We have to remember these are coun-
tries from which we currently import 
pharmaceutical products because we 
trust that their equivalent of the FDA 
is safe and is effective. So if we don’t 
trust them with respect to baby for-
mula, I would submit that we shouldn’t 
trust them elsewhere. But in fact, we 
can trust them in these areas. None of 
those adverse incident reports that 
were reported, to my knowledge, have 
been linked to a defect or a contamina-
tion in the formula itself. 
Finally, it is important to remember 
that we have a massive health crisis 
faced by these babies who are unable to 
get formula. Children are being hos-
pitalized because they are dehydrated. 
These can have lasting consequences. 
They are occurring at a time when the 
baby’s brain development is on a very 
critical timeline. You don’t want to in-
terrupt that. You don’t want a supply 
chain disruption to lead to a disruption 
in the baby’s developmental growth. 
So it is unfortunate that my friend 
and distinguished colleague, the Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania, has objected 
to this very reasonable, rational, sen-
sible response that lists the govern-
ment’s impediments. I wish this were 
not the case because this would deliver 
meaningful reform, unlike the 13 mil-
lion bottles—the day and a half’s worth 
of formula that has been brought over 
to date through the Defense Produc-
tion Act efforts that he described—this 
would actually solve the problem. And 
it would solve it for at least 6 months, 
long enough for our domestic produc-
tion capabilities to resume. 
So it is unfortunate. I wish that were 
not the case. But in the spirit of com-
ity and compromise, I will modify my 
request. 
Again, the FORMULA Act would 
have included these three legs, a regu-
latory component lifting the regu-
latory restrictions, an import tariff re-
striction, and also lifting some restric-
tions in the WIC Program. 
So I am going to counteroffer with 
another amendment that would remove 
the waiver of the FDA regulations for 
the imported formula. That, after all, 
is the concern he expressed, and so that 
should allow us to deal with it. It 
would keep the tariff and the WIC 
waivers from the FORMULA Act intact 
and therefore shouldn’t raise any con-
cerns not addressed by my friend and 
distinguished colleague. 
And so, Mr. President, as if in legisla-
tive session, I ask unanimous consent 
that the Senate proceed to the imme-
diate consideration of Calendar No. 372, 
S. 4261; further, I ask that the Lee sub-
stitute amendment at the desk be con-
sidered and agreed to; that the bill, as 
amended, be considered read a third 
time and passed, and that the motions 
to reconsider be considered made and 
laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I object. 
Let me walk through why. My friend 
from Utah, in the spirit to try to work 
something out here, is offering a coun-
terproposal. 
The problem that I have with this is 
the amendment—now we are talking 
about the Department of Agriculture, 
which plays a role here. I will get to 
that in a moment. 
But in this case, the amendment 
would direct this Agency, the Depart-
ment of Agriculture, to allow formula 
to be included in the Women, Infants, 
and Children’s nutrition program that 
does not meet USDA standards. So 
now, we have a concern that I initially 
raised about FDA standards. Now, we 
have USDA standards for safety and 
nutritional adequacy. 
I would also add that this amend-
ment is unnecessary because of action 
that was taken by the leaders of the 
Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, 
and Forestry. That committee passed a 
bipartisan bill, the Access to Baby For-
mula Act, that the President just 
signed into law. This already provides 
the Agency, the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture, with the discretion it 
needs to expand the products available 
to WIC parents and babies—right now 
that is the law—while also continuing 
to meet those high nutritional needs of 
the babies. 
So, again, the concerns here are 
standards—safety standards—for those 
infants. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I find this, 
too, unfortunate. I wish we could adopt 
all three of these reforms; again, we 
have a regulatory reform, an import 
tax reform, and a WIC reform. He has 
now expressed objections to the regu-
latory reform and the WIC reform. 
So, in the spirit of comity and co-
operation and compromise, I would 
like to modify again, and I will take 
out the WIC restrictions—the WIC 
component of the bill—and leave only 
the tariff waiver. That, at least, would 
remove some of the protectionist prob-
lems that we have got in place that is 
currently 
prohibiting 
people 
from 
being able to import this stuff, leaving 
it available really only to wealthy, 
well-connected parents who know how 
to find this stuff and can pay the high-
er price for it. This would at least 
allow people to buy it in stores if we 
could lift that restriction and do so in 
larger quantities while adhering to the 
labeling and other regulatory require-
ments. 
So, Mr. President, as if in legislative 
session, I ask unanimous consent that 
the Senate proceed to the immediate 
consideration of Calendar No. 372, S. 
4261; further, I ask that the Lee sub-
stitute amendment at the desk be con-
sidered and agreed to; that the bill, as 
amended, be considered read a third 
time and passed; and that the motion 
to reconsider be considered made and 
laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I object, 
in this case, on much more limited 
grounds. Here is the reason: The Sen-
ator from Utah is trying to work some-
thing out here, and we appreciate that. 
The Democratic side has not had the 
opportunity yet to review this amend-
ment so we would seek, in the interest 
of comity, more time to review it. And 
on that basis, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.

Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I find it 
most unfortunate that, as American 
babies are starving and are literally 
being admitted to hospitals for dehy-
dration and malnutrition because of a

government-created problem, we can’t 
get to a solution here. 
I am determined to find one, and I 
am determined not to take no for an 
answer. We have to get to yes on that. 
To that end, I would like to modify my 
last request and shorten it down from 
180 days—a 6-month suspension—to a 
90-day suspension. This is the exact 
timeframe that mirrors the Biden ad-
ministration’s proposed time window 
for gas tax alleviation. The President 
has raised this and has asked us to act 
on that immediately. Look, I happen to 
think baby formula is a whole lot more 
important and urgent than gasoline. 
We can at least do this. So I am going 
to modify my request to move it down 
to just 90 days. We should be able to do 
that for 90 days. I am certain that we 
can. 
Mr. President, as if in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that the 
Senate proceed to the immediate con-
sideration of Calendar No. 372, S. 4261; 
further, that the Lee substitute amend-
ment at the desk be considered and 
agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be 
considered read a third time and 
passed; and that the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I object 
for the same narrow reason, which is 
that the Democratic side has not had 
the opportunity to review this amend-
ment. We will do that on both this 
amendment and the prior amendment 
and see where we are. On that basis, I 
object. 
I will also add for the record, on the 
debate overall, I think my friend is ex-
pressing a real concern that both sides 
have. It is not as if we just arrived here 
today to start talking about this issue. 
As I have said for months now, the 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions Committee, in a bipartisan way, 
and the Committee on Agriculture, Nu-
trition, and Forestry, in a bipartisan 
way, have been working on these 
issues. So to suggest that somehow the 
debate just started today and that nei-
ther side is doing enough, I think is not 
accurate. Both sides are concerned 
about this. Both Houses and both par-
ties are very concerned about it. It is a 
real crisis. The FDA should be held ac-
countable. As I said earlier, it should 
be hit hard for this, but we can’t com-
promise safety standards, and that is 
the reason for my objection. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I appreciate 
the thoughts expressed by my friend 
and distinguished colleague, the Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania. I share this 
concern and this desire to see this 
worked out and worked out on a bipar-
tisan basis. I think it is important. 
It is true that people have been work-
ing on it. They have been working on it 
now for the better part of a month and 
a half. Yet nothing has happened. Now, 
I understand that Rome wasn’t built in 
a day. Significant legislative reforms 
are not usually enacted very quickly. 
Well, they are in some places, and we 
are experiencing some of that this 
week, but that is a different issue alto-
gether. I understand that it takes time, 
on many occasions, to develop a legis-
lative solution. This is not one of those 
issues. This is just not that com-
plicated. 
I appreciate the fact that people are 
considering it. I appreciate the fact 
that my friend and colleague, the Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania, is willing to 
try to clear this on the Democratic 
side. I hope and expect that one of the 
four alternatives that I have proposed 
today—each in the spirit of comity and 
compromise and as something that 
should be acceptable to both political 
parties—has got to get there. 
There are issues on which we are al-
ways going to struggle to find solu-
tions. This one isn’t hard. We can do 
this. We can fix this. American babies 
are going hungry because of the mis-
management within our country. 
Yes, I share the Senator’s belief that 
we have got to hold the FDA account-
able, but I feel like we are in the same 
position 
as 
the 
unarmed 
English 
bobby—but with the FDA lately. The 
unarmed English bobby, being unarmed 
and upon seeing the commission of a 
crime, shouts, in a charming British 
accent, ‘‘Stop or I will yell ‘stop’ 
again.’’ We need to actually do some-
thing to force this issue because people 
are going hungry—babies are going 
hungry—and there are dire, long-last-
ing consequences. 
I hope and expect that we will solve 
this before the end of the week. This 
issue is not going away, and neither am 
I.

ator from Oregon. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 1658 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent for us to take 5 
minutes to address the PUMP for Nurs-
ing Mothers Act. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, it was 
10 years ago that we all got together 
and passed a bill to help women, when 
they go back to work, to be able to 
pump breast milk at work. We have 80 
percent of women who are having ba-
bies today striving to breastfeed. Half 
of the women who have babies are 
going back to work within a very short 
period of time, and the only way they 
can breastfeed is to pump milk at 
work. This was a beautiful, bipartisan 
vision, and it was Dr. Coburn who edu-
cated us all about the tremendous ben-
efits of breast milk for babies. 
But, in that work we did 10 years ago, 
we left out a significant group of 
women in America—those who work 
according to a manager’s salary rather 
than according to wage. So now we 
have a bill that has come out of com-
mittee, by voice vote, to fix that, and 
here we are talking about baby for-
mula. 
Truly, what is better, in terms of 
baby formula, than a mother’s milk? 
Let us stand with the babies; let us 
stand with the mothers; let us stand 
with the families and fix this so that 
every single mother in America who 
wishes to breastfeed can do so. 
As if in legislative session, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of Calendar No. 65, S. 1658; fur-
ther, that the committee-reported sub-
stitute be withdrawn and that the 
Merkley substitute amendment at the 
desk be considered and agreed to; that 
the bill, as amended, be considered 
read a third time and passed; and that 
the motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Wyoming. 
Ms. LUMMIS. Mr. President, in re-
serving the right to object, the PUMP 
Act is noble in nature, but it is an 
economy-sized approach without flexi-
bilities for some nonstationary work-
places. 
This legislation would require that 
all modes of transportation that have 
employees, including railcars, be retro-
fitted with private, non-bathroom en-
closures to allow for breastfeeding. It 
would also require employees reason-
able break time for an employee to ex-
press breast milk. 
To be clear, I recognize the need for 
breastfeeding women to do just that. 
However, many women in this industry 
are quite literally keeping the trains 
running on time. Entire supply chains 
could be disrupted because of an overly 
broad and burdensome regulation that 
is not crafted to fit this industry. I 
can’t believe I am the only one who 
sees the pitfalls in this. Regulations 
like this risk inadvertently doing more 
harm to working women than helping 
them. 
I understand what it is like to juggle 
the need to feed your child while also 
working to provide for them. My 
daughter is working while raising two 
little boys. 
This whole thing just makes no 
sense. That is why I am working on an 
amendment that would recognize the 
unique situation that working moms in 
the transportation sector face. It is my 
hope we can work with the bill’s spon-
sors to solve this small issue. Until 
that time, we don’t need to exacerbate 
our supply chain crisis by imple-
menting regulations that do not actu-
ally protect or aid women in this in-
dustry. 
For that reason, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from Oregon. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, a 
huge thanks to my colleague from 
Alaska, Senator MURKOWSKI, who has 
partnered with me in this effort. 
We have worked through the flexi-
bility needed in every setting, and I

must say the railroads weren’t the 
folks who came to us and said they 
needed help. In the past, we worked out 
every possible way to address this for 
fast-food locations and for all kinds of 
industries that said, ‘‘We need special 
arrangements,’’ and we worked them 
out. We have worked them out in this 
version for the airlines. 
It really is beyond the world of rea-
sonableness to keep saying and to keep 
finding some excuse that we can’t— 
with the innovation, the inventiveness, 
and the ingenuity of Americans—find 
the ability for a woman to be able to 
express breast milk. We have solved 
this problem in much more difficult 
situations. I am very disappointed 
that, today, because of my colleague 
from Wyoming’s objection, the women, 
the mothers, the babies, and the fami-
lies, lose. Let’s win next time.

CLIMATE CHANGE 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I 
rise now for the 284th time with my in-
creasingly tattered and battered ‘‘Time 
to Wake up’’ poster to urge this Cham-
ber to wake up on the issue of climate 
change. 
Human beings dumped 36.3 billion 
tons of greenhouse gases into the at-
mosphere last year—last year. After all 
our big talk, after all the plans and the 
COPS and the commitments, 36.3 bil-
lion tons. That is the highest total ever 
recorded. We are not doing any better. 
We continue to do worse, and here in 
Congress, we continue to do nothing. 
We have seen this coming for many 
years. And even with all that warning, 
nothing. 
NOAA reports there is currently 
more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere 
now than at any time during the last 4 
million years. Humankind has never 
experienced what we are putting our-
selves through. 
Here is a look at it. Over centuries, 
wobbling, wobbling, back and forth 
quite steadily. And now—whoops—and 
all the way up to where we are, out of 
the historic range of this planet back 
into geological time. 
All that carbon pollution has us hur-
tling toward climate catastrophe. With 
every ton of carbon dioxide we add, 
comes a higher risk of destructive 
changes to our world: ever-stronger 
hurricanes, 
rising 
seas, 
severe 
droughts, flooding, heat waves, disease, 
hunger, and more. We have a simple 
choice: We act swiftly to address the 
carbon pollution scorching our planet 
or we tip our climate over the edge 
into a cycle of destruction mankind 
cannot halt. 
As we disrupt essential planetary op-
erating systems, we face another prob-
lem: American deindustrialization and 
the offshoring of jobs in much of our 
manufacturing base. 
After China joined the World Trade 
Organization back here in 2001, the 
United States lost almost 6 million 
manufacturing jobs. It was a complete 
bloodbath. Communities across Amer-
ica were hollowed out as factories 
closed and workers were laid off losing 
union jobs that helped workers support 
their families and enjoy a good wage 
and a decent standard of living. 
Our trade deficit blew up, especially 
for manufactured goods. In 2001, our 
trade deficit in manufactured goods 
topped $250 billion. By 2020, it had more 
than tripled to almost $900 billion. 
Then came the COVID–19 pandemic 
and exposed the fact that we no longer 
make so much upon which modern life 
depends. First it was the masks and 
the protective gear for medical profes-
sionals on the frontlines; then short-
ages came to everything from patio 
furniture to auto computer chips, bicy-
cles, garage doors, and much more. 
Well, what if—what if—it turned out 
there was a solution to both problems, 
a policy that would simultaneously 
drive down carbon pollution worldwide 
and help reshore American manufac-
turing? Well, it turns out there is such 
a solution, and it is called a carbon 
border 
adjustment. 
With 
Senators 
COONS, SCHATZ, and HEINRICH, I have 
introduced one here in the Senate. 
The fact is that American manufac-
turers are way less carbon-intensive 
than other competitors. On average, we 
are nearly 50-percent less carbon-inten-
sive than our trading partners. 
Here is a list of some of our majors: 
China, 3.2 times more efficient; Mexico, 
1.4 times more efficient; India, 3.8 
times more efficient. So if we level the 
playing field about carbon emissions 
economy to economy, we win against 
carbon-intensive nations like China 
and India. And that is fair. A steel 
plant in Shanghai shouldn’t be able to 
pollute for free and undercut plants in 
Pittsburgh that make better steel with 
less pollution. My border adjustment 
fixes that problem. Carbon-polluting 
goods from abroad, fossil fuels, refined 
petroleum products, petrochemicals, 
fertilizer, 
cement, 
steel 
would 
be 
tariffed on the carbon intensity of 
their industries. This means that if you 
are a carbon-intensive cement factory 
in Mexico, you pay or you invest in 
technologies to lower your carbon in-
tensity to match that cleaner plant 
across the border in Texas. 
That is a powerful incentive to re-
duce global emissions and a big boost 
to U.S. companies competing against 
foreign climate cheaters. 
The tariff revenues fund a competi-
tive grant program for carbon-emitting 
U.S. industries to help them invest in 
the new technologies necessary to re-
duce their own carbon intensities. 
Developing countries didn’t get us 
into this mess, and they are getting 
clobbered by climate change, so we 
also direct some revenue to the State 
Department to support decarbonization 
projects in those countries. 
To make this work, we need to hold 
American 
companies 
to 
the 
same 
standard as we do overseas, so we set

the standard at our U.S. average emis-
sions for the industry. So all you have 
to do to pay nothing is be better than 
average. And if you are below average, 
all you have to do to pay nothing is to 
clean up your act to where half your 
industry already is. 
We also give clear targets to indus-
tries for future baseline carbon inten-
sity because that is what industry 
wants—clarity, 
certainty 
to 
know 
where the goalposts are. 
Look at an example. Under my bill, 
the average or better American steel 
mill would pay no charge at all because 
it is better than average. The below av-
erage steel mill might pay $5 to $10 per 
ton of steel produced, a $5 to $10 per 
ton incentive to clean up its mill. But 
here is the really good part: Imports 
from a Chinese steel mill, more like 
$110 per ton. The below average U.S. 
steel mill, $5 to $10; the Chinese, $110. 
That will make Americans feel more 
competitive compared to polluting Chi-
nese imports, and then buyers will beat 
a path to our door. 
We might as well get ready with a 
U.S. carbon border adjustment because 
the European Union Parliament is 
passing a carbon border adjustment of 
its own. Member states will vote on 
that proposal later this year. When it 
takes effect, American companies will 
pay a carbon tariff to European govern-
ments—unless we have one of our own. 
Now, where we want to be is for the 
EU, the UK, Canada, Mexico, Japan, 
perhaps South Korea, all with common 
carbon border adjustments, creating a 
common 
carbon 
pricing 
platform 
across all those major economies so 
that we move toward decarbonization, 
and more importantly, the rest of the 
world that wants to trade with the 
United States, with the UK, with the 
EU, has to clean up its act. They would 
need to decarbonize and fast to have 
any hope of competing. 
Trying to convince Chinese manufac-
turers to clean up their act out of the 
goodness of their hearts, perhaps, is a 
bit of a fool’s errand. Putting a tariff 
on their goods so that they have to pay 
if they don’t clean up their act? Now, 
that is how you get things going. 
Unfortunately, this is on us now—on 
Democrats. There are too many Repub-
licans who are just in tow to the fossil 
fuel industry to help. 
And, of course, you can’t talk about 
anything having to do with climate 
change without the dark money scoun-
drels, propped up by the fossil fuel in-
dustry, to come and cause mischief. 
They are even advertising against my 
bill. 
Here is an advertisement against it 
paid for by AG Conservatives—AG Con-
servatives. Well, assume that this is a 
real organization, which it isn’t. It is a 
front group paid for by dark money 
that hides who the real donors are— 
just a mouthpiece for somebody who 
doesn’t want to identify themselves. 
But why would an agriculture group 
want to hurt manufacturing? It doesn’t 
make any sense. Why would they not 
want American manufacturing to have 
that advantage against their Chinese 
competition? Why would they be ask-
ing people to vote no on a carbon bor-
der adjustment? 
And by the way, there are a lot of 
products where agricultural products 
form the feedstock for a later manufac-
turing product. And if we are bringing 
manufacturing to the United States be-
cause we are favored versus dirty pol-
luting 
foreign 
manufacturers, 
why 
would they not want that to happen? 
And where is agriculture in this fight 
anyway when this is mostly about 
manufacturing? Where, for American 
agriculture, is the downside? 
If you think it through, it actually 
doesn’t exist, which helps confirm to 
me that behind this phony front group 
is probably the fossil fuel industry pre-
tending that it is some agriculture 
group. If that were agriculture, that 
was agriculture from millions of years 
ago before it all went down to the bot-
tom and got compressed and rotted and 
turned, after millions of years, into oil. 
That is the agriculture. 
So that is what we are up against. 
That is why Democrats are going to 
have to do this. The fossil fuel money 
that is driving the other party makes 
it impossible for bipartisanship to 
work. 
We have a shot in reconciliation to 
pass a serious climate bill—a real one— 
and we should make a carbon border 
adjustment a central component of 
that bill. It is a win-win-win. We com-
pete on a playing field with a huge 
built-in advantage for American manu-
facturing; we spare ourselves carbon 
tariffs from the EU; and we relent-
lessly, with economic pressure and 
power, drive down carbon pollution 
across the biggest polluters around the 
globe—a win-win-win. 
The choice is clear. Let’s win.

NATIONAL DAIRY MONTH 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, June 2022 
marks the 85th annual Dairy Month, 
and today I wish to recognize the hard 
work of South Dakota’s dairy industry. 
Our dairy producers and processors 
work tirelessly to provide high-quality, 
safe, and nutritious products for people 
around the world. The 2020–2025 U.S. 
Dietary Guidelines for Americans high-
lights that dairy consumption is a crit-
ical part of a healthy, balanced diet 
and is the leading source of calcium 
and vitamin D, critical components of 
bone strength and heart health. 
In 2021, the U.S. dairy industry con-
tributed approximately $753 billion to 
the U.S. economy, and it supports 3.3 
million jobs. South Dakota’s dairy in-
dustry is experiencing exciting growth, 
as seen by the doubling of milk produc-
tion between 2000 and 2020. In 2019, 
South Dakota produced more than $563 
million in milk and dairy products. 
South Dakota is home to more than 170 
dairy farms and nearly a dozen proc-
essing facilities that support more 
than 6,000 jobs in our State. Each dairy 
cow brings an estimated $26,000 of eco-
nomic impact to communities every 
year. 
Our Nation’s producers are also lead-
ing the way in sustainability and effi-
ciency. Between 2007 and 2017, they de-
creased their carbon footprint by 19 
percent. The industry has also success-
fully lowered the water input in a gal-
lon of milk by 30 percent. These in-
creased efficiencies are a window into 
the incredible innovation of the agri-
culture industry as producers continue 
working to feed to the world. 
I commend the hard work and dedica-
tion of our State’s dairy farmers and 
processors and all that they do to con-
tinue to supply the world with nutri-
tious dairy products. I wish the dairy 
industry continued prosperity in the 
years to come.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION 
Australia—AGM–88E2 AARGM E2 Missiles 
The Government of Australia has re-
quested to buy up to fifteen (15) AGM–88E2 
Advanced 
Anti-Radiation 
Guided 
Missile 
(AARGM) Guidance Sections; up to fifteen 
(15) AARGM Control Sections; up to fifteen 
(15) High Speed Anti-Radiation Missiles 
(HARM) Rocket Motors; up to fifteen (15) 
HARM Warheads; and up to fifteen (15) 
HARM Control Sections. Also included are 
AGM–88E2 AARGM All Up Round (AUR) tac-
tical missiles; AGM–88E2 AARGM Captive 
Air Training Missile (CATM); HARM G-Code 
AUR; HARM G-Code CATM; M-Code GPS re-
ceivers; containers; support and test equip-
ment; EA–18G Growler test support; spare 
and repair parts; software (Classified and Un-
classified); U.S. Government and contractor 
engineering support; and other related ele-
ments of logistical and program support. The 
estimated total value is $94 million. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy and national security objectives of 
the United States. Australia is one of our 
most important allies in the Western Pa-
cific. The strategic location of this political 
and economic power contributes signifi-
cantly to ensuring peace and economic sta-
bility in the region. It is vital to the U.S. na-
tional interest to assist our ally in devel-
oping and maintaining a strong and ready 
self-defense capability. 
The proposed sale will improve Australia’s 
capability 
to 
meet 
current 
and 
future 
threats by suppressing and destroying land- 
or sea-based radar emitters associated with 
enemy air defenses. Destruction or suppres-
sion of enemy radar denies the adversary the 
use of air defense systems, thereby improv-
ing the survivability of its tactical aircraft. 
Australia will have no difficulty absorbing 
this equipment into its armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The principal contractors will be Northrop 
Grumman 
Information 
Systems 
(NGIS), 
Ridgecrest, CA. There are no known offset 
agreements proposed in connection with this 
potential sale. 
Implementation of the proposed sale will 
require U.S. Government and contractor rep-
resentatives to visit Australia on a tem-
porary basis in conjunction with program 
technical oversight and support require-
ments, including program and technical re-
views. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale. 
TRANSMITTAL NO. 22–27 
Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of 
Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the 
Arms Export Control Act 
Annex Item No. vii 
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The AGM–88E2 Advanced Anti-Radiation 
Guided Missile (AARGM) weapon system is 
an air-to-ground missile intended for Sup-
pression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) and 
Destruction of Enemy Air Defenses (DEAD) 
missions. The AARGM E2 provides suppres-
sion or destruction of enemy radar and de-
nies the enemy the use of air defense sys-
tems, thereby improving the survivability of 
tactical aircraft. The AGM–88E2 AARGM 
Captive Air Training Missiles (CATM) is 
used by pilots when training for SEAD/DEAD 
missions. 
2. The highest level of classification of de-
fense articles, components, and services in-
cluded in this potential sale is SECRET. 
3. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the specific 
hardware and software elements, the infor-
mation could be used to develop counter-
measures that might reduce weapon system 
effectiveness or be used in the development 
of a system with similar or advanced capa-
bilities. 
4. A determination has been made that 
Australia can provide substantially the same 
degree of protection for the sensitive tech-
nology being released as the U.S. Govern-
ment. This sale is necessary in furtherance 
of the U.S. foreign policy and national secu-
rity objectives outlined in the Policy Jus-
tification. 
5. All defense articles and services listed in 
this transmittal have been authorized for re-
lease and export to the Government of Aus-
tralia.

TRIBUTE TO ANNA MAE 
ROBERTSON 
Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor the life, career, and 
achievements of Anna Mae Robertson. 
Her service to the American people 
during World War II in the 6888th Cen-
tral Postal Directory Battalion, known 
as the Six Triple Eight, is a shining ex-
ample of hard work and courage in the 
face of cultural grievance. 
In her youth, Robertson lost her 
mother suddenly, leaving her and her 
brother alone. Her mother had instilled 
the values of hard work and service in 
her children, which inspired Anna Mae 
to devote her time and dedication to 
the U.S. Army. In service, she worked 
strenuous 
hours, 
filing 
over 
65,000 
pieces of mail for every shift. Robert-
son’s battalion consisted solely of 
Black women who excelled at their 
work in their respective department. 
Despite wartime anxieties and cultural 
unrest, Robertson and her team would 
complete 6 weeks of hard work in half 
the time needed, all while being sta-
tioned 
in 
Birmingham, 
England, 
amidst enemy attacks and wartime 
fears. 
Had it not been for Robertson and her 
team’s success, wartime communica-
tion would have been convoluted and 
inefficient. She handled the passage of 
information in the most dire of condi-
tions at the darkest of times when 
communication was a necessity. Her 
service did not end there. While sta-
tioned in France, she served as a hos-
pital aide, continuing to assist and 
nurse American soldiers. 
Robertson’s passion for helping those 
who have served would follow her 
home. When returning to Milwaukee, 
Robertson dedicated her time to work-
ing as a nurse aide at the Milwaukee 
VA Medical Center. She also joined the 
‘‘I Am Not Invisible’’ campaign headed 
by the Center for Women Veterans, ad-
vocating for equal recognition, aware-
ness, and resources for women who 
have served in the American military. 
Robertson served despite facing ra-
cial bigotry and discrimination. She 
stood for the American people uncondi-
tionally when some may have not 
stood for her. Robertson was previously 
been decorated with six awards for her 
service, and I am pleased that she, 
along with the members of Six Triple 
Eight, will now receive a Congressional

service. Anna Mae Robertson is an in-

gratitude with Anna Mae Robertson for 
her lifetime of service and devotion to 
our Nation.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO PASTOR WILLIAM 
‘‘BILL’’ WADE 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, it is im-
portant to honor key leaders who have 
made a positive impact in their com-
munities. Pastor William ‘‘Bill’’ Wade 
is the shepherding and care pastor at 
Living Hope Baptist Church in Bowling 
Green, KY. He has been married to 
Dianne Harbin of Vicksburg, MS for 41 
years. They are blessed with two grown 
children, Joey Wade and Katy Owen. 
They also have two grandchildren, 
Clare and Judson Owen. Pastor Bill re-
ceived his master of religious edu-
cation degree in December 1981 from 
New Orleans Baptist Theological Semi-
nary. 
Pastor Bill is a leader who cares 
deeply for those within his sphere of in-
fluence. It is this caring heart that mo-
tivated him to establish a counseling 
center in Bowling Green in 2016. His vi-
sion was to provide anyone who is hurt-
ing in the community the opportunity 
to receive free biblical counseling. His 
leadership has provided counselors who 
are prepared to help those struggling 
with addiction, those with marriage 
difficulties, those caught in debili-
tating conflict, and those contem-
plating suicide. As an extension of his 
love for the community, he served 
alongside first responders as a chaplain 
during the search and rescue efforts 
following 
the 
December 
2021 
dev-
astating tornados in Bowling Green, in 
which 18 individuals lost their lives and 
hundreds lost their homes. Pastor 
Bill’s primary goal that individuals 
will begin to experience God every day 
and live out a God-honoring life. 
In addition, he led efforts to open a 
pregnancy support center in 2019 in 
Bowling Green to care for those moth-
ers and fathers who feel overwhelmed 
by unexpected news that a baby is on 
the way. Much-needed care is provided 
during the pregnancy and after deliv-
ery. Many mothers have since decided 
to continue their pregnancy, bringing 
forth the joy of new life to celebrate. 
These two organizations are known 
collectively as the Centers for Hope. 
Through Bill’s wise and caring efforts, 
his dream has become a reality, and 
lives have been forever changed for the 
better. Pastor Bill’s legacy will remain 
strong for many generations to come.∑

REMEMBERING ANTOINE ‘‘TONY’’ 
INCASHOLA, SR. 
∑ Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I would 
like to share a few words today to 
honor an outstanding leader, veteran, 
and friend of mine who recently passed 
away. 
Tony Incashola was the director of 
the Selis-Qlispe Culture Committee, 
where he spent 47 years preserving and 
perpetuating Salish and Pend d’Oreille 
culture, language, and history. In his 
27 years as director of the committee, 
he earned the respect and trust of 
those he represented, so much so that 
members of the Selis-Qlispe Elders Cul-
tural Advisory Council regarded him as 
the leader of the Tribe. Apart from his 
work on the Selis-Qlispe Culture Com-
mittee, Tony was a former Tribal coun-
cilman for the Confederated Salish and 
Kootenai Tribes. 
In partnership with his fellow CSKT 
elder Johnny Arlee, Tony initiated the 
documentation and preservation of Sa-
lish language, stories, lessons, impor-
tant place names, and songs, among 
other historical artifacts. Thanks to 
their work, the Selis-Qlispe Culture 
Committee has produced one of the 
most 
comprehensive 
and 
extensive 
tribal collections of oral history and 
culture in the Nation. 
Tony’s life’s work was dedicated to 
passing Tribal knowledge onto future 
generations, which he accomplished 
not only through his record-keeping, 
but also through projects like the 
Nkwusm Salish School in Arlee, which 
teaches the Salish language and cul-
ture to kids from pre-K through 8th 
grade. 
Tony’s knowledge and leadership also 
had a profound impact on Tribal pol-
icy. As a member of the CSKT Tribal 
Council, he was instrumental in the ef-
fort to expand the Tribe’s natural re-
source department and ultimately ac-
quire 
ownership 
over 
the 
Salish 
Kootenai Dam. And as if his dedication 
to the Tribes wasn’t enough, Tony was 
also a Vietnam vet, who served his 
country 
courageously 
in 
the 
U.S. 
Army. But to me, and to many others, 
Tony was all these things and more. He 
was a spiritual leader, a historian, a re-
source, and a friend. 
I got to know him during my time in 
the Montana State Legislature, and he 
quickly became someone I deeply re-
spected for his character, his wisdom, 
and his deep knowledge of the past. 
But most of all, Tony was just a 
stand-up guy, a man who dedicated his 
life to others, whether that was his 
family, his Tribe, or even future gen-
erations of Tribal members he would 
never meet. 
I extend my deepest sympathies to 
Tony’s wife Denise; their children 
Daren, Brian, Brandy, and Tony, Jr.; 
foster children Destry Henderson and 
Marietta Meuli; ‘‘special daughter’’ 
Marlene 
Lafromboise; 
eight 
grand-
children; two great-grandchildren; and 
all the other folks who considered 
Tony family—and there were many. 
Though he is no longer with us, 
Tony’s presence will be felt for genera-
tions. Tony’s memory will live on, just 
like the CSKT history he spent his life 
working to preserve. 
Thank you, Tony, for all you gave to 
Montana. You will be sorely missed.∑

House of Representatives of the State of 
Michigan urging the United States Congress

to petition the U.S. International Trade 
Commission to temporarily waive tariffs on 
imports of fertilizer and fertilizer ingredi-

billion in economic activity annually to the 
state. More than 800,000 people work in 
Michigan’s agricultural industry, and care 
for nearly 10 million acres of land; and 
Whereas, Fertilizer is a critical agricul-
tural input that is utilized by farmers to pro-
vide nutrients to their land and maximize 
the productivity of their farms. Michigan 
farmers require access to fertilizers in order 
to nourish their land and maintain produc-
tion levels; and 
Whereas, The International Trade Commis-
sion (ITC) determined that the import of for-
eign fertilizers injured U.S. manufacturers. 
As a result, the ITC decided to impose a 
nineteen percent tariff on imports of fer-
tilizer and fertilizer ingredients from Mo-
rocco. The tariffs, which were implemented 
in early 2021, significantly increased fer-
tilizer prices; and 
Whereas, Fertilizer prices in the United 
States are now at an all-time high. Fertilizer 
prices had already been increasing due to 
factors such as rising costs of raw materials 
and increased demand for inputs. With these 
tariffs in effect, farmers who were already 
struggling to compete with rising costs are 
now faced with an increased financial burden 
and uncertain future; and 
Whereas, Meanwhile, the U.S. continues to 
rely on imported fertilizer and fertilizer in-
gredients. For example, more than 95 percent 
of potash, one of the key components found 
in fertilizer, is currently imported from out-
side the U.S.; and 
Whereas, Michigan contains the only com-
mercial deposit of natural potash in the U.S. 
and the highest quality natural potash de-
posit in the world. The Michigan Legislature 
recently provided an investment of $50 mil-
lion to establish potash extraction infra-
structure in Michigan. Once completed, this 
project will help increase domestic supply of 
this critical mineral, thereby strengthening 
and securing the supply of high-quality pot-
ash for Michigan farmers, in addition to pro-
viding hundreds of full-time jobs and boost-
ing Michigan’s economy. This will be crucial 
for the Michigan agricultural industry, as 
significant 
supply 
shortages 
and 
sky-
rocketing costs continue to burden Michigan 
farmers; and 
Whereas, Legislation has been introduced 
in Congress that would allow a process for 
farmers to petition the ITC to temporarily 
waive tariffs on imports of fertilizer and fer-
tilizer ingredients. With the price of fer-
tilizer on the rise, this would help alleviate 
costs for farmers, as Morocco is one of the 
top five exporters of fertilizer to the United 
States; now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives, 
That we urge Congress to pass legislation 
that would allow farmers to petition the ITC 
to temporarily waive tariffs on imports of 
fertilizer and fertilizer ingredients imported 
from Morocco; and be it further 
Resolved That copies of this resolution be 
transmitted to the President of the United 
States Senate, the Speaker of the United 
States House of Representatives, and the 
members of the Michigan congressional dele-
gation. 
POM–146. A resolution adopted by the Sen-
ate of the State of Hawaii urging the State

tions Paris Agreement and the 2030 Develop-
ment Agenda, and to specifically adopt the

Whereas, the State is recognized as a glob-
al partner and local leader in promotion of 
human rights and protection of the earth 
through its consistent acceptance of global 
standards that better serve our islands and 
the world; and 
Whereas, Hawai’i is guided by traditional 
Kanaka Maoli values and emerging inter-
national human rights principles to generate 
positive policy encouraging prevention and 
precaution regarding the planet; and 
Whereas, in September 2015, the United Na-
tions General Assembly adopted the historic 
‘‘Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda 
for Sustainable Development’’ (2030 Develop-
ment Agenda), which is a comprehensive, 
compassionate, 
creative, 
and 
courageous 
plan of action to end poverty, protect the 
planet, and ensure that all people enjoy 
peace and prosperity; and 
Whereas, the 2030 Development Agenda in-
cludes seventeen sustainable development 
goals, one hundred sixty-nine targets, and 
two hundred thirty indicators upon which 
general agreement has been reached to meas-
ure, monitor, and mobilize to achieve these 
goals and targets; and 
Whereas, goals 13 through 17 of the United 
Nations sustainable development goals are 
vital to protecting the State’s land and peo-
ple and should be adopted as local policy and 
governing principles for local government 
entities and other organizations; and 
Whereas, goals 13 through 17 of the United 
Nations sustainable development goals are 
the following, respectively: 
(1) Take urgent action to combat climate 
change and its impacts; 
(2) Conserve and sustainably use the 
oceans, seas, and marine resources for sus-
tainable development; 
(3) Protect, restore, and promote sustain-
able 
use 
of 
terrestrial 
ecosystems, 
sustainably 
manage 
forests, 
combat 
desertification, and halt and reverse land 
degradation and halt biodiversity loss; 
(4) Promote peaceful and inclusive soci-
eties for sustainable development, provide 
access to justice for all and build effective, 
accountable, and inclusive institutions at all 
levels; and 
(5) Strengthen the means of implementa-
tion and revitalize the global partnership for 
sustainable development; and 
Whereas, in December 2015, parties to the 
United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change, also known as Conference of 
the Parties, adopted the Paris Agreement 
that further limited the allowable tempera-
ture increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius to protect 
our Pacific neighbors; and 
Whereas, Hawai’i continues to partner 
with other states, territories, and nation- 
states with the ‘‘We Are Still In’’ movement; 
and 
Whereas, the Pacific islands in the Pacific 
Islands Forum for Oceania have undertaken 
creative campaigns to partner with the 
United Nations’ specialized agency programs 
and funding, as well as participating in the 
United Nations’ major forums, including the 
High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable 
Development, which focuses on the United 
Nations sustainable development goals; and 
Whereas, the Global Pact for the Environ-
ment (Global Pact) is an initiative led by the 
hosts of the United Nations Framework Con-
vention on Climate Change in Paris to ad-
dress the fragmented nature and incon-
sistent implementation of international en-
vironmental law by enumerating funda-
mental climate change principles in one le-
gally binding framework for current and fu-
ture generations for equity and equality; and 
Whereas, the Global Pact will serve as a 
cornerstone in international human rights 
and environmental law and create a more co-
herent global environmental governance; 
and 
Whereas, the Global Pact addresses the 
challenges posed by environmental degrada-
tion in the context of sustainable develop-
ment and induces a greater degree of uni-
formity for environmental laws in all states; 
and 
Whereas, the Global Pact consists of over 
two dozen articles that cover a variety of 
topics and ideas to consider for implementa-
tion, including: 
(1) The right to an ecologically sound envi-
ronment;

(21) Monitoring implementation of the 
Pact; and 
(22) Other topics focusing on the Secre-
tariat, signature, ratification, acceptance, 
approval, entry into force, denunciation, and 
depositary; and 
Whereas, the Global Pact provides an agen-
da based upon the articles for grassroots and 
global action to generate the political will to 
protect the planet today and tomorrow; and 
Whereas, the State desires to promote sus-
tainable development where each generation 
can satisfy its needs without compromising 
the capability of future generations to meet 
their needs to respect the balance and integ-
rity of the Earth’s and Hawai’i’s fragile eco-
system; and 
Whereas, Hawai’i emphasizes the vital role 
of women to achieve the United Nations sus-
tainable development goals and the neces-
sity to promote gender equality and em-
powerment of wahine for global general well- 
being; and 
Whereas, Hawai’i is already involved in 
international initiatives to protect the plan-
et and the Oceania region by actively par-
ticipating in many United Nations annual 
sessions and meetings and by partnering 
with United Nations specialized agencies, 
programs, and funds, including partnering 
with the United Nations Office of the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights and partici-
pating in the United Nations Environment 
Programme; and 
Whereas, in Hawai’i, college, community, 
and capitol dialogues on the Paris Agree-
ment and the 2030 Development Agenda, 
among other climate change topics, continue 
to generate genuine insight that contributes 
to Voluntary Local Reviews, which are vol-
untary reports to the United Nations on 
local progress on implementing the United 
Nations sustainable development goals; and 
Whereas, 
local 
opportunities 
for 
the 
State’s youth to learn about and participate 
in climate change initiative include opportu-
nities at colleges and universities that pro-
vide input on achieving the Global Pact, 
with a focus on research and innovation, and 
participation in a Hawai’i human rights and 
resilience process: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, By the Senate of the Thirty-first 
Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular 
Session of 2022, that the State and each

achieve the United Nations Paris Agreement 
and the 2030 Development Agenda, and to 
specifically adopt the United Nations sus-
tainable development goals, numbers 13 
through 17; and be it further 
Resolved, That the Global Pact should be 
embraced and that protection of nature 
should be the centerpiece of the State’s poli-
cies and practices; and be it further 
Resolved, That certified copies of this Reso-
lution be transmitted to the United Nations 
Secretary General and High Commissioner 
for Human Rights, President and Vice Presi-
dent of the United States, President Pro 
Tempore of the United States Senate, Major-
ity and Minority leaders of the United States 
Senate, Speaker and Minority Leader of the 
United States House of Representatives, 
each member of Hawai’i’s congressional dele-
gation, Governor, and mayors of each county 
of Hawai’i. 
POM–147. A resolution adopted by the Sen-
ate of the State of Hawaii affirming Hawaii’s 
ongoing commitment to the goals of the 
Paris Climate Agreement, the United Na-
tions Sustainable Development Goals, and 
endorsement of the Fossil Fuel Non-Pro-
liferation Treaty; to the Committee on For-
eign Relations. 
SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 95 
Whereas, the scientific consensus is clear 
that human activities are primarily respon-
sible for accelerating global climate change, 
and that the climate crisis now represents 
one of the preeminent threats to global civ-
ilization; and 
Whereas, the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change (IPCC) reported in 2018 that 
we must achieve net zero in greenhouse gas 
emissions (GHGs) by the middle of this cen-
tury in order to have a reasonable chance of 
limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Cel-
sius; and 
Whereas, the IPCC released its Sixth As-
sessment Report from Working Group II, 
which was approved by one hundred ninety- 
five member states, in February 2022, and the 
summary for policy makers notes that there 
is high confidence that ‘‘the rise in weather 
and climate extremes has led to some irre-
versible impacts as natural and human sys-
tems are pushed beyond their ability to 
adapt’’; and 
Whereas, the United Nations (UN) sec-
retary-General Antonio Guteres, responded, 
‘‘The IPCC is an atlas of human suffering 
. . . according to current commitment, glob-
al emissions are set to increase almost 14 
percent. . . . It will destroy any chance of 
keeping 1.5 alive . . . coal and other fossil 
fuels are choking humanity’’; and 
Whereas, the UN Human Rights council in 
2021 adopted landmark legislation, Resolu-
tion 48/13, recognizing a clean, healthy and 
sustainable environment is a human right; 
and 
Whereas, changes in Hawaii’s climate are 
already being felt, as evidenced by rising sea 
levels, coastal inundation, ocean warming as 
well as coral bleaching, heightened risk of 
wild fires, and increasing severe storms; and 
Whereas, the entire community is im-
pacted by the health and safety risks of fos-
sil fuel expansion, particularly those who 
also face socioeconomic and health inequi-
ties, including low-income families, those ex-
periencing homelessness, people of color and 
indigenous peoples, youth, seniors, those ex-
periencing mental and physical disabilities, 
and people with health conditions; and 
Whereas, youth and future generations 
have the most to lose from a lack of imme-
diate action to stop fossil fuel expansion as 
they face major and lifelong health, ecologi-
cal, social, and economic impacts from pro-
longed and cumulative effects of climate 
change, including food and water shortages, 
infectious diseases, and natural disasters; 
and 
Whereas, the Paris Climate Agreement is 
silent on coal, oil, and gas, an omission with 
respect to the supply and production of fossil 
fuels (the largest source of GHGs) that needs 
to be collectively addressed by other means; 
and 
Whereas, the Glasgow Climate Pact im-
proved incrementally only calling for a 
phase down not a phase out of coal; and 
Whereas, global governments and the fossil 
fuel industry are currently planning to 
produce about one hundred twenty percent 
more emissions by 2030 than what is needed 
to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius and 
avert catastrophic climate disruption, and 
such plans risk undoing the work of the 
State to reduce GHG emissions; and 
Whereas, the fossil fuel industry is cur-
rently 
claiming 
over 
fifty 
percent 
of 
coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic recovery 
funding from senior levels of government in 
the G20, thereby siphoning away recovery 
funding badly needed by cities and other in-
dustries; and 
Whereas, the construction of new fossil 
fuel infrastructure and expanded reliance on 
fossil fuels exposes communities to unten-
able risks to public health and safety at the 
local and global levels; and 
Whereas, the economic opportunities pre-
sented by a clean energy transition far out-
weigh the opportunities presented by an 
economy supported by expanding fossil fuel 
use and extraction; and 
Whereas, the community is committed, as 
part of the climate emergency response, to a 
just energy transition and to ambitious in-
vestments in the green infrastructure and in-
dustries that will create jobs and rapidly 
decarbonize the economy; and 
Whereas, Hawaii recognizes that it is the 
urgent responsibility and moral obligation of 
wealthy fossil fuel producers to lead in put-
ting an end to fossil fuel development and to 
manage the decline of existing production; 
and 
Whereas, a new global initiative is under-
way calling for a Fossil Fuel Non-Prolifera-
tion Treaty that would end new fossil fuel 
exploration and expansion, phase out exist-
ing production in line with the global com-
mitment to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Cel-
sius, and accelerate equitable transition 
plans; now, therefore, and be it further 
Resolved by the Senate of the Thirty-first 
Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular 
Session of 2022, that this body affirms the 
State’s ongoing commitment to the goals of 
the Paris Climate Agreement, the UN Sus-
tainable Development Goals, and the GHG 
reduction targets as called for by the IPCC, 
and pledges to meet its proportionate green-
house gas reductions under the Paris Cli-
mate Agreement; and be it further 
Resolved, That the State and each county 
are requested to formally endorse the call for 
a Fossil Fuel NonProliferation Treaty; and 
be it further 
Resolved, That the U.S. government is 
urged to support the initiative for a Fossil 
Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty; and be it fur-
ther 
Resolved, That certified copies of this Reso-
lution be transmitted to the United Nations 
Secretary General and High Commissioner 
for Human Rights, President and Vice Presi-
dent of the United States, President Pro 
Tempore of the United States Senate, Major-

of the United States House of Representa-
tives, members of the Hawaii congressional 
delegation, Governor, and Mayor of each 
county. 
POM–148. A resolution adopted by the Sen-
ate of the State of Hawaii denouncing Rus-
sia’s actions causing a humanitarian crisis 
in Ukraine and urging the United States 
Congress to take concrete action to support 
Ukrainian refugees and to increase the ref-
ugee limits for the United States and in-
crease funding related to those efforts; to the 
Committee on Foreign Relations. 
SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 178 
Whereas, the Russian invasion of Ukraine 
has prompted two million Ukrainians to flee 
the country as of March 8, 2022, and the num-
ber is expected to grow even higher as Russia 
continues its siege tactics of indiscrimi-
nately bombing cities; and 
Whereas, in only the first week of the con-
flict, more than one million people had fled 
Ukraine, in comparison it took over two 
years for that many people to leave Syria; 
and 
Whereas, as of March 8, 2022, the 2022 inva-
sion of Ukraine by Russia has caused at least 
1,335 civilian casualties in Ukraine, accord-
ing to the United Nations Office of the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights; and 
Whereas, the United Nations Office of the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights’ sta-
tistics are based off confirmable casualties, 
the number is likely several times higher as 
many of Ukraine’s largest cities under con-
trol of the Ukrainian government are subject 
to relentless bombing campaigns from long- 
distance artillery as well as air strikes front 
the Russian military and it is difficult if not 
impossible to confirm some of the deaths; 
and 
Whereas, Russia has begun to use siege 
style tactics where cities are surrounded 
from all sides and shelled repeatedly, such as 
in the port town of Mariupol, and while Rus-
sia has promised to open civilian corridors to 
allow for civilians to leave these cities, sev-
eral times when they have done so they have 
broken the ceasefire and shelled the civilian 
corridors resulting in civilian casualties; and 
Whereas, for many of the civilians living in 
these areas, staying in their homes is not an 
option as intense bombing campaigns by 
Russia have caused water, power, and energy 
disruptions, leaving these civilians stuck in 
homes with no electricity, running water, or 
heat in freezing temperatures; and 
Whereas, many of these, civilians have fled 
from areas of the country with most of the 
fighting such as the north, east, and south, 
and have headed to the western part of the 
country which has been relatively untouched 
by the fighting; and 
Whereas, cities such as Lviv in the western 
part of Ukraine near its borders with the Eu-
ropean Union are bursting at the seams with 
internally displaced people, and its mayor 
Andriy Sadovyi has requested international 
help as the city is currently housing two 
hundred fifty thousand internally displaced 
people from other parts of Ukraine, and at 
least fifty thousand people transit through 
its railway stations a day; and 
Whereas, the vast majority of refugees are 
women, children, and the elderly as Ukraine 
has banned men ages eighteen to sixty from 
leaving the country due to a mass mobiliza-
tion of soldiers; and 
Whereas, according to the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Refugees, as of March 
8, 2022, Poland has received 1,204,403 refugees, 
Hungary has received 191,348 refugees, Roma-
nia has received 143,000 refugees, Slovakia 
has received 140,745 refugees, the Czech Re-
public has received more than one hundred 
thousand refugees, and Moldova has received 
82,762 refugees, with other countries receiv-
ing fewer refugees; and 
Whereas, according to the UN Refugee 
Agency, as of March 31, 2022, Poland has re-
ceived 2,384,814 refugees, Romania has re-
ceived 623,627, Moldova received 390,187 refu-
gees, Hungary has received 374,535 refugees,

and Slovakia has received 292,039 refugees; 
and 
Whereas, countries such as Moldova, which 
is one of the poorest countries in Europe, 
need more international support to deal with 
the large number of refugees crossing the 
border from Ukraine; and 
Whereas, although United States President 
Biden has stated that the United States will 
accept one hundred thousand refugees, the 
United States needs to do more to help the 
refugee crises as countries like Poland, Ro-
mania, and Moldova are taking in a dis-
proportionate amount of Ukrainian refugees 
compared to the rest of the world; and 
Whereas, the United States needs to take 
more concrete steps to help Ukrainian refu-
gees such as increasing humanitarian aid to 
western parts of Ukraine that are dealing 
with an influx of refugees from the other 
parts of the country and countries dealing 
with large numbers of Ukrainian refugees; 
and 
Whereas, 
recognizing 
that 
the 
United 
States has taken some steps towards helping 
the refugee crisis, such as allowing Ukrain-
ians who arrived in the United States on or 
prior to March 1, 2022, to apply for temporary 
protected status; and 
Whereas, the United States should further 
help by taking in refugees from Ukraine, 
similar to how refugees from Afghanistan 
were taken in, and the United States should 
also increase the limit of how many refugees 
it can take in to allow for the resettlement 
of Ukrainians; and 
Whereas, more help should be given to the 
Ukrainian government and countries hous-
ing refugees as soon as possible, and plans 
should be made on how to deal with this cri-
sis in the longer term as there does not seem 
to be an end in sight; now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, by the Senate of the Thirty-first 
Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Ses-
sion of 2022, That this body strongly and 
forcefully denounces the Russian Federation 
and its President Vladimir Putin for the bla-
tant targeting of civilians by the Russian 
military and the destruction of civilian in-
frastructure, which makes evacuating civil-
ians from the warzone even more difficult; 
and be it further 
Resolved, That this body urges the United 
States Congress to take concrete actions to 
help with the refugee crisis facing Ukraine 
and its European neighbors by increasing 
material support to refugees, both those in-
ternally displaced, such as those who have 
fled to the relatively safe western part of 
Ukraine, and those who have fled the coun-
try, by sending monetary support and sup-
plies to Ukraine and its neighbors who have 
accepted large numbers of refugees; and be it 
further 
Resolved, That the United States President 
and Congress are urged to take an active role 
in assisting the crisis by raising the U.S. 
Refugee Admissions and Refugee Resettle-
ment Ceilings, making a stronger effort at 
resettling more Ukrainian refugees into the 
United States, and allocating more funding 
in order to support those efforts; and be it 
further 
Resolved, That certified copies of this Reso-
lution be transmitted to the President of the 
United States, Speaker of the United States 
House of Representatives, President Pro 
Tempore of the United States Senate, mem-
bers of the Hawaii congressional delegation, 
Governor, and Mayors of each county.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3073 
June 22, 2022 
Whereas, the United Nations Office of the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights’ sta-
tistics are based off confirmable casualties, 
the number is likely several times higher as 
many of Ukraine’s largest cities under con-
trol of the Ukrainian government are subject 
to relentless bombing campaigns from long- 
distance artillery as well as air strikes from 
the Russian military and it is difficult if not 
impossible to confirm some of the deaths; 
and 
Whereas, Russia has begun to use siege 
style tactics where cities are surrounded 
from all sides and shelled repeatedly, such as 
in the port town of Mariupol, and while Rus-
sia has promised to open civilian corridors to 
allow for civilians to leave these cities, sev-
eral times when they have done so they have 
broken the ceasefire and shelled the civilian 
corridors resulting in civilian casualties; and 
Whereas, for many of the civilians living in 
these areas, staying in their homes is not an 
option as intense bombing campaigns by 
Russia have caused water, power, and energy 
disruptions, leaving these civilians stuck in 
homes with no electricity, running water, or 
heat in freezing temperatures; and 
Whereas, many of these civilians have fled 
from areas of the country with most of the 
fighting such as the north, east, and south, 
and have headed to the western part of the 
country which has been relatively untouched 
by the fighting; and 
Whereas, cities such as Lviv in the western 
part of Ukraine near its borders with the Eu-
ropean Union are bursting at the seams with 
internally displaced people, and its mayor 
Andriy Sadovyi has requested international 
help as the city is currently housing two 
hundred fifty thousand internally displaced 
people from other parts of Ukraine, and at 
least fifty thousand people transit through 
its railway stations a day; and 
Whereas, the vast majority of refugees are 
women, children, and the elderly as Ukraine 
has banned men ages eighteen to sixty from 
leaving the country due to a mass mobiliza-
tion of soldiers; and 
Whereas, according to the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Refugees, as of March 
8, 2022, Poland has received 1,204,403 refugees, 
Hungary has received 191,348 refugees, Roma-
nia has received 143,000 refugees, Slovakia 
has received 140,745 refugees, the Czech Re-
public has received more than one hundred 
thousand refugees, and Moldova has received 
82,762 refugees, with other countries receiv-
ing fewer refugees; and 
Whereas, according to the UN Refugee 
Agency, as of March 31, 2022, Poland has re-
ceived 2,384,814 refugees, Romania has re-
ceived 623,627, Moldova received 390,187 refu-
gees, Hungary has received 374,535 refugees, 
and Slovakia has received 292,039 refugees; 
and 
Whereas, countries such as Moldova, which 
is one of the poorest countries in Europe, 
need more international support to deal with 
the large number of refugees crossing the 
border from Ukraine; and 
Whereas, although United States President 
Biden has stated that the United States will 
accept one hundred thousand refugees, the 
United States needs to do more to help the 
refugee crises as countries like Poland, Ro-
mania, and Moldova are taking in a dis-
proportionate amount of Ukrainian refugees 
compared to the rest of the world; and 
Whereas, the United States needs to take 
more concrete steps to help Ukrainian refu-
gees such as increasing humanitarian aid to 
western parts of Ukraine that are dealing 
with an influx of refugees from the other 
parts of the country and countries dealing 
with large numbers of Ukrainian refugees; 
and 
Whereas, 
recognizing 
that 
the 
United 
States has taken some steps towards helping 
the refugee crisis, such as allowing Ukrain-
ians who arrived in the United States on or 
prior to March 1, 2022, to apply for temporary 
protected status; and 
Whereas, the United States should further 
help by taking in refugees from Ukraine, 
similar to how refugees from Afghanistan 
were taken in, and the United States should 
also increase the limit of how many refugees 
it can take in to allow for the resettlement 
of Ukrainians; and 
Whereas, more help should be given to the 
Ukrainian government and countries hous-
ing refugees as soon as possible, and plans 
should be made on how to deal with this cri-
sis in the longer term as there does not seem 
to be an end in sight; now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate of the Thirty-first 
Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular 
Session of 2022, the House of Representatives 
concurring, that this body strongly and 
forcefully denounces the Russian Federation 
and its President Vladimir Putin for the bla-
tant targeting of civilians by the Russian 
military and the destruction of civilian in-
frastructure, which makes evacuating civil-
ians from the warzone even more difficult; 
and be it further 
Resolved, That this body urges the United 
States Congress to take concrete actions to 
help with the refugee crisis facing Ukraine 
and its European neighbors by increasing 
material support to refugees, both those in-
ternally displaced, such as those who have 
fled to the relatively safe western part of 
Ukraine, and those who have fled the coun-
try, by sending monetary support and sup-
plies to Ukraine and its neighbors who have 
accepted large numbers of refugees; and be it 
further 
Resolved, That the United States President 
and Congress are urged to take an active role 
in assisting the crisis by raising the U.S. 
Refugee Admissions and Refugee Resettle-
ment Ceilings, making a stronger effort at 
resettling more Ukrainian refugees into the 
United States, and allocating more funding 
in order to support those efforts; and be it 
further 
Resolved, That certified copies of this Con-
current Resolution be transmitted to the 
President of the United States, Speaker of 
the United States House of Representatives, 
President Pro Tempore of the United States 
Senate, members of the Hawaii congres-
sional delegation, Governor, and Mayors of 
each county. 
POM–151. A joint resolution adopted by the 
General Assembly of the State of Tennessee 
strongly supporting the completion of the se-
cure border wall across our nation’s southern 
border and strongly urging the United States 
Congress to immediately act to fund the con-
struction of such border wall without delay; 
to the Committee on Homeland Security and 
Governmental Affairs. 
HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION NO. 652 
Whereas, the security of our nation’s bor-
ders and the safety of our citizens are para-
mount to protecting the American way of 
life; and 
Whereas, it is essential to the welfare of 
our nation that illegal immigration cease; 
and 
Whereas, we should continue to safeguard 
our borders by completing the construction 
of the secure border wall on the southern 
border of the United States; and 
Whereas, illegal immigrants who cross the 
southern border are not required to receive a 
vaccination against COVID–19; and 
Whereas, it is known that at least eighteen 
percent of illegal immigrants who cross the 
southern border of the United States are in-
fected with COVID–19 and are contributing 
to this country’s national health crisis; and 
Whereas, the members of this General As-
sembly have consistently taken steps to ad-
dress illegal immigration within the borders 
of our great State and now wish to urge the 
United States Congress to address illegal im-
migration by completing the construction of 
the border wall: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives of 
the One Hundred Twelfth General Assembly of 
the State of Tennessee, the Senate Concurring, 
that we strongly support the completion of 
the secure border wall across our nation’s 
southern border and strongly urge the 
United States Congress to immediately act 
to fund the construction of such border wall 
without delay; and be it further 
Resolved, That certified copies of this reso-
lution be transmitted to the President of the 
United States, the U.S. Secretary of Home-
land Security, the Speaker and the Clerk of 
the United States House of Representatives, 
the President and the Secretary of the 
United States Senate, and each member of 
the Tennessee Congressional delegation. 
POM–152. A memorial adopted by the Leg-
islature of the State of Colorado urging the 
United States Congress to authorize for-
warding funding to make a one-time appro-
priation to the Bureau of Indian Education 
Higher Education Grant Program; to the 
Committee on Indian Affairs. 
SENATE MEMORIAL NO. 22–002 
Whereas, The Bureau of Indian Education 
(BIE) operates the Higher Education Grant 
Program (grant program) as authorized by 
the federal ‘‘Act of November 2, 1921’’, com-
monly referred to as the ‘‘Snyder Act’’, 25 
U.S.C. sec. 13; and 
Whereas, Numerous Indian tribal govern-
ments provide college financial assistance 
and scholarships from the grant program di-
rectly to Indian college students through the 
federal ‘‘1975 Indian Self-determination and 
Education Assistance Act’’, Pub. L. 93–638, or 
through the federal ‘‘Tribal Self-governance 
Act of 1994’’, Pub. L. 103–413; and 
Whereas, The federal government routinely 
operates under continuing resolutions. As 
such, grant program funding is delayed; con-
sequently, college scholarship and financial 
assistance payments and institutional dis-
bursements are delayed, which is problem-
atic for many Indian college students who 
depend on these funds to pay for tuition, 
books, room, and board; and 
Whereas, There is precedent for forward 
funding of federal Indian education pro-
grams. BIE-funded schools, including schools 
receiving funding pursuant to 25 U.S.C. sec. 
1810 and tribally controlled colleges and uni-
versities receiving funding pursuant to 25 
U.S.C. sec. 1810, are forward funded; and 
Whereas, Forward funding of the BIE will 
make grant program funds available for obli-
gation on July 1 of any given fiscal year, and 
the funds will remain available until Sep-
tember 30 of the succeeding fiscal year; and 
Whereas, Congress may authorize for-
warding funding and make a one-time appro-
priation of such sums, as necessary, to for-
ward fund the BIE grant program: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate of the Seventy-third 
General Assembly of the State of Colorado: 
That we, the members of the Colorado Sen-
ate strongly urge Congress to forward fund 
the Bureau of Indian Education Higher Edu-
cation Grant Program as authorized by the 
federal ‘‘Act of November 2, 1921’’; and be it 
further 
Resolved, That copies of this Memorial be 
sent to the Clerk of the United States House 
of Representatives; the Secretary of the 
United States Senate; each member of Colo-
rado’s 
congressional 
delegation; 
Melvin 
Baker, Chairman of the Southern Ute Indian 
Tribe; Manuel Heart, Chairman of the Ute 
Mountain Ute Tribe; and Jonathan Nez, 
President of the Navajo Nation.

116 justices, will have its first black woman

Whereas, Judge Jackson’s nomination for

vard Law School, from which she was grad-
uated cum laude, and her service as a public

HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION NO. 3205 
Whereas, the founders of our constitution 
empowered state legislators to be guardians 
of liberty against future abuses of power by 
the federal government; and 
Whereas, the federal government has cre-
ated a crushing national debt through im-
proper and imprudent spending; and 
Whereas, the federal government has in-
vaded the legitimate roles of the states 
through the manipulative process of federal

great extent; and 
Whereas, 
the 
federal

has 
ceased to live under a proper interpretation

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. PADILLA (for himself and 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN): 
S. 4439. A bill to take certain Federal 
land located in Siskiyou County, Cali-
fornia, and Humboldt County, Cali-
fornia, into trust for the benefit of the 
Karuk Tribe, and for other purposes; to 
the Committee on Indian Affairs. 
Mr. PADILLA, Mr. President, I rise 
to 
introduce 
the 
Katimiıˆn 
and 
Ameekya´araam Sacred Lands Act to 
place roughly 1,000 acres of sacred 
lands currently under Federal owner-
ship into trust for the benefit of the 
Karuk Tribe. 
The Karuk have lived in and con-
ducted ceremonies on these sacred 
lands known as Katimiıˆn for centuries, 
and this bill would promote the lon-
gevity of the Tribe’s culture and tradi-
tions. 
Our bill would transfer 1,031 acres of 
Federal land known as Katimiıˆn from 
the U.S. Forest Service to the Interior 
Department to place those lands into 
trust for the Karuk Tribe. Doing so 
would allow the Karuk to access 
Katimiıˆn for use during their ancestral 
ceremonies without interruption and 
exercise better stewardship over their 
sacred lands for generations to come. 
As our Nation works to correct his-
toric injustices, it is important that we 
promote Tribal sovereignty and the 
continuation of Tribal culture. These 
sacred lands, located in Humbolt and 
Siskiyou 
Counties, 
are 
central 
to 
Karuk culture, religion, and identity, 
and serve as the Tribe’s center of the 
universe and site of the Pikyavish 
world renewal ceremony. 
Currently, the Karuk have a special 
use permit from the Forest Service to 
access the land for prayers and ances-
tral ceremonies. However, in recent 
years, the Tribe has struggled to access 
the site and conduct their sacred cere-
monies privately without interruption. 
Placing these lands into trust would 
allow the Karuk to provide better pub-
lic notice of ceremonies, preserve tra-
ditional practices, and protect the 
land’s rich natural beauty, a core ten-
ant of the Tribe’s identity. 
I thank Senator FEINSTEIN for intro-
ducing this legislation with me in the 
Senate and Congressman HUFFMAN for 
championing this effort in the House of 
Representatives. 
I 
also 
thank 
the 
Karuk 
Tribe, 
including 
Chairman 
Attebery, for leading this important ef-
fort. I look forward to working with 
my colleagues to enact this bill as 
quickly as possible. 
By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and 
Mr. KAINE): 
S. 4446. A bill to modernize the proc-
ess of accelerated approval of a drug 
for a serious or life-threatening disease 
or condition; to the Committee on 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions. 
Ms. COLLINS, Mr. President, I rise 
to introduce the Modernizing the Ac-
celerated Approval Pathway Act with 
my colleague from Virginia, Senator 
TIM KAINE. The Food and Drug Admin-
istration’s accelerated approval path-
way has long had broad bipartisan sup-
port and is an important tool that pro-
vides early access to treatments for pa-
tients with serious and life-threatening 
conditions for which there is an unmet 
need, 
like 
Alzheimer’s 
disease, 
Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and 
many cancers. 
FDA 
grants 
accelerated 
approval 
based on substantial evidence that a 
surrogate end point is reasonably like-
ly to predict a clinical benefit. In other 
words, therapies have to meet the same 
‘‘substantial evidence’’ standard as tra-
ditional approval, but they can rely on 
a surrogate end point that predicts a 
clinical benefit rather than measuring 
that clinical benefit directly. For ex-
ample, a study might measure viral 
load as a surrogate end point for sur-
vival in HIV or tumor size in oncology. 
This can considerably shorten the 
time required before a product receives 
FDA approval. Clinical outcomes can 
take significantly more time to mani-
fest than a surrogate end point, and in 
the meantime, patients go without 
treatments while studies are being con-
ducted. Sponsors are still required to 
complete postmarket studies for their 
accelerated approval products, which 
are designed to confirm the clinical 
benefit with goals of converting an ac-
celerated approval into a traditional 
approval. A review of accelerated ap-
proval drugs approved between 1992 and 
2016 concluded that 76.5 percent were 
converted to traditional approval. 
The accelerated approval pathway 
has served us well over the decades 
since it was created in response to out-
cry over unmet patient need during the 
HIV/AIDS crisis. More than 250 new 
therapies have received accelerated ap-
proval, with 65 percent of those thera-
pies treating cancer indications and 
just over 40 percent treating rare dis-
eases or conditions. We need, however, 
to make sure that we update this path-
way so that it remains flexible in our 
current scientific environment and can 
continue to enable access to treat-
ments for patients with serious and 
life-threatening conditions who are 
desperate for a treatment or cure. 
It is well known that use of the ac-
celerated approval pathway is incon-
sistent across FDA. Some therapeutic 
areas, like oncology, have vast experi-
ence and success using the pathway. In 
fact, about 85 percent of accelerated 
approvals between 2010 and 2020 were 
for oncology indications. In other 
areas, like neurological diseases, it is 
infrequently 
used. 
Patient 
commu-
nities are deeply frustrated by what 
they view as underutilization of the 
tool and feel it has created disparities 
given that the urgency of finding a

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3078 
June 22, 2022 
cure is one shared by all patients with 
diseases for which there is no treat-
ment or cure, regardless of which bu-
reaucratic office leads drug review for 
their particular disease. The Govern-
ment Accountability Office has found 
that these inconsistencies are due in 
part to a lack of familiarity with the 
tools of accelerated approval in certain 
FDA centers and divisions. Our bill 
would correct this by establishing a 
council of senior FDA leadership to en-
sure consistent and appropriate use of 
the 
accelerated 
approval 
pathway 
across and within FDA centers and di-
visions. 
Although a number of rare disease 
therapies have been good candidates 
for accelerated approval, there can also 
be challenges to using the pathway. 
Sometimes a disease is so rare or het-
erogeneous that developers need to 
study a small subset of the population 
in order to demonstrate a treatment ef-
fect. Our bill would clarify that real- 
world evidence—data from patient reg-
istries, electronic health records, med-
ical claims, and observational studies— 
can be used to augment or support ap-
propriate post approval studies. This 
approach may yield meaningful and 
timely evidence that adds context to 
other data and helps us understand how 
a product works in the real world and 
across the entire population for a dis-
ease. 
Some have criticized the timeliness 
of confirmatory trials, which are some-
times delayed by operational or ethical 
challenges. FDA and drug developers 
are often rushing to agree on a con-
firmatory trial structure late in the re-
view structure, and in those cases they 
may not be able to benefit from expert 
input or feasibility analyses. This can 
create untenable expectations regard-
ing timelines or, in a worst case sce-
nario, result in drug developers pur-
suing a flawed study that is not appro-
priately designed to confirm clinical 
benefit. Our bill would clarify that 
FDA may require confirmatory trials 
to be underway prior to approval and 
that FDA can specify the conditions 
for those studies, which may include 
enrollment targets, study protocol, 
milestones, and a target date for study 
completion. Our bill also outlines expe-
dited procedures for withdrawing an 
accelerated approval if a confirmatory 
trial fails to confirm the clinical ben-
efit. 
Finally, we need to make it clearer 
how much progress an accelerated ap-
proval product has made toward con-
firming its clinical benefit. Our bill 
would require that developers of drugs 
approved under accelerated approval 
submit to FDA a report of the progress 
they have made on required confirm-
atory trials every 180 days. It would 
also require that if FDA does not re-
quire postapproval studies for an accel-
erated approval product, the Agency 
must publish an explanation on its 
website as to why such a study is not 
appropriate or necessary. 
Our bill has support from the Juve-
nile Diabetes Research Foundation, 
American Cancer Society Cancer Ac-
tion Network, Parent Project for Mus-
cular Dystrophy, EveryLife Founda-
tion for Rare Diseases, Alzheimer’s As-
sociation, National MS Society, Amer-
ican Academy of Neurology, National 
Organization of Rare Diseases, and the 
Haystack Project. I thank Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions Committee 
Chairman MURRAY and Ranking Mem-
ber BURR for including it in their FDA 
Safety and Landmark Advancements 
Act, which was favorably reported out 
of the HELP Committee this week. I 
encourage my colleagues to support 
that bill when it is considered on the 
Senate floor. 
By Mr. REED (for himself and 
Mr. MORAN): 
S. 4448. A bill to authorize a pilot 
program to expand and intensify sur-
veillance of self-harm in partnership 
with State and local public health de-
partments, to establish a grant pro-
gram to provide self-harm and suicide 
prevention services in hospital emer-
gency departments, and for other pur-
poses; to the Committee on Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, as we all 
know too well, rates of suicide have 
risen to epidemic levels in the United 
States, with suicide now the 10th lead-
ing cause of death in the country. On 
average, there are 130 suicides every 
day, roughly 1 every 11 minutes. These 
are staggering statistics behind which 
there are tragic stories of loss. That is 
why I am joining Senator MORAN to in-
troduce the Suicide Prevention Act. 
Our bipartisan, bicameral bill would 
provide new resources to help turn the 
tide on this disturbing trend. It would 
authorize new funding for the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention, 
CDC, partner with State and local 
health departments to improve surveil-
lance of suicide attempts and other 
incidences of self-harm. Data collec-
tion efforts regarding suicide often 
occur years after the fact, which limits 
the ability of State and local health de-
partments, as well as community orga-
nizations, to recognize trends early and 
intervene. CDC has already begun some 
of this work as a pilot program, but the 
Suicide Prevention Act would expand 
these efforts and enhance data collec-
tion so we can respond to new trends 
quickly and save lives. 
We know that emergency healthcare 
providers are often at the frontlines of 
responding to suicide attempts. Ap-
proximately 37 percent of individuals 
without a previous history of mental 
health or substance abuse who die by 
suicide make an emergency depart-
ment visit within the year before their 
death. According to the Suicide Pre-
vention Resource Center, the risk of 
suicide is greatest within a month of 
discharge from the hospital. To help 
ensure our emergency healthcare pro-
fessionals have the tools to respond, 
the bill would also authorize funding 
for a grant program within the Sub-
stance Abuse and Mental Health Serv-
ices Administration, SAMHSA, to help 
better train emergency department 
staff to implement suicide prevention 
strategies, screen at-risk patients, and 
refer patients to appropriate followup 
care. The legislation would also require 
SAMHSA to develop best practices for 
such programs, so that healthcare pro-
viders are able to provide their pa-
tients with the best possible care and 
advice. 
Nationwide, suicide rates have sky-
rocketed over the last decade. In 2020, 
nearly 46,000 Americans lost their lives 
to suicide. That same year, there were 
1.2 million suicide attempts. We must 
renew our efforts on suicide prevention 
and take a holistic approach. In addi-
tion to the Suicide Prevention Act, we 
must 
reauthorize 
the 
Garrett 
Lee 
Smith Memorial Act, which I am work-
ing with Senator MURKOWSKI to do. De-
spite the troubling national trend, pro-
grams under this law have contributed 
to declines in the youth suicide rates 
in my home State of Rhode Island over 
the last decade. 
We must also invest in the National 
Suicide Prevention Lifeline and the 
new nationwide three-digit 9–8–8 num-
ber, which is scheduled to go live this 
summer. Senator MORAN and I have 
teamed up on the National Suicide Pre-
vention Lifeline Improvement Act that 
will increase funding for the Lifeline 
and make key improvements, such as 
enhance texting capability. 
Today, I am pleased to have the op-
portunity to partner with Senator 
MORAN once again by introducing the 
Suicide Prevention Act. This bill is one 
more step Congress can take to combat 
the mental health and suicide crisis in 
our country. I look forward to working 
with Senator MORAN and advocates in 
Rhode Island and across the country to 
make a difference in addressing this 
epidemic.

Mr. TESTER, Mr. THUNE, and Mr. COR-
NYN) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 686 
Whereas pioneering men and women, rec-
ognized as ‘‘cowboys’’, helped to establish 
the American West; 
Whereas the cowboy embodies honesty, in-
tegrity, courage, compassion, respect, a 
strong work ethic, and patriotism; 
Whereas the cowboy spirit exemplifies 
strength of character, sound family values, 
and good common sense; 
Whereas the cowboy archetype transcends 
ethnicity, gender, geographic boundaries, 
and political affiliations; 
Whereas the cowboy, who lives off the land 
and works to protect and enhance the envi-
ronment, is an excellent steward of the land 
and its creatures; 
Whereas cowboy traditions have been a 
part of American culture for generations; 
Whereas the cowboy continues to be an im-
portant part of the economy through the 
work of many thousands of ranchers across 
the United States who contribute to the eco-
nomic well-being of every State; 
Whereas millions of fans watch profes-
sional and working ranch rodeo events annu-
ally, making rodeo one of the most-watched 
sports in the United States; 
Whereas membership and participation in 
rodeo and other organizations that promote 
and encompass the livelihood of cowboys 
span every generation and transcend race 
and gender; 
Whereas the cowboy is a central figure in 
literature, film, and music and occupies a 
central place in the public imagination; 
Whereas the cowboy is an American icon; 
and 
Whereas the ongoing contributions made 
by cowboys and cowgirls to their commu-
nities should be recognized and encouraged: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates July 23, 2022, as ‘‘National 
Day of the American Cowboy’’; and 
(2) encourages the people of the United 
States to observe the day with appropriate 
ceremonies and activities.

Mr. SCOTT of Florida submitted the

tions: 
S. RES. 688 
Whereas fiscal year 2022 marked the return 
of ‘‘congressionally directed spending’’ and 
‘‘community project funding’’, also known as 
‘‘earmarks’’, after a 12-year hiatus; 
Whereas the return of earmarks marks the 
return of lawmakers using their powers to 
circumvent the rules of the Senate in order 
to 
direct 
taxpayer 
dollars 
to 
wasteful 
projects; 
Whereas

than 3,000 requests for earmarks in the House 
of Representatives and the more than 8,000 
requests for earmarks in the Senate for fis-
cal year 2022; 
Whereas 
the 
reckless, 
2,700 
page, 
$1,500,000,000,000 omnibus spending bill (the 
Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022; Pub-
lic Law 117–103; 136 Stat. 49) enacted in 
March 2022 appropriated billions of dollars to 
earmarks, even though the United States is 
more than $30,000,000,000,000 in debt and expe-
riencing the highest level of inflation for 40 
years; 
Whereas the massive, omnibus spending 
bill includes funding for earmarks including, 
$2,500,000 to construct a museum annex in 
Vermont, $605,000 to construct a New York 
City greenhouse, and $3,000,000 to establish a 
Brooklyn gallery, in addition to earmark 
projects including bike trails in Vermont, 
derelict lobster pots in Connecticut, and a 
sidewalk for the road of a country club in 
Colorado; 
Whereas former Senator Tom Coburn con-
demned the use of earmarks as a ‘‘gateway 
drug to overspending’’, and former Senator 
John McCain called earmarks ‘‘the gateway 
drug to corruption and overspending in 
Washington’’; 
Whereas several former Members of Con-
gress and lobbyists have been convicted of 
crimes related to earmarking; 
Whereas it is crucial that Congress spend 
taxpayer dollars wisely and with the best re-
turn on investment, especially during times 
of historic inflation and Federal debt levels; 
and 
Whereas Congress must stop this reckless 
Federal spending and corrupt political deal-
ing, start paying down the debt of the United 
States, and get the United States back on 
track: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) condemns the use of ‘‘congressionally 
directed spending’’ and ‘‘community project 
funding’’, known as ‘‘earmarks’’, to direct 
and appropriate taxpayer dollars in any 
form; 
(2) reaffirms the previous ban on the use of 
earmarks, and affirms to restore the ban per-
manently and immediately; and 
(3) affirms the need for Congress to reign in 
overspending to help curb the inflation crisis 
that is crippling the families of the United 
States.

Whereas June 24, 2022, marks 1 year since

mediately answered the call of duty, includ-
ing firefighters, uniformed police officers, 
rescue and recovery crews, emergency med-
ical technicians, physicians, nurses, and oth-

trapped in the building; 
(3) international rescue crews and emer-
gency support organizations from Israel and 
Mexico responded to the site to aid in the 
search and recovery efforts; 
(4) National Urban Search and Rescue Re-
sponse System task forces from Florida, Vir-
ginia, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New 
Jersey, and emergency specialists from Cali-
fornia, deployed to Surfside, Florida, to pro-
vide critical support; 
(5) teams worked tirelessly around the 
clock to rescue survivors and recover the re-
mains of individuals killed in the tragic col-
lapse; and 
(6) on June 30, 2021, the National Institute 
of Standards and Technology announced it 
would launch a formal investigation into the 
cause of the collapse: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) commemorates the passage of 1 year 
since the tragic building collapse in Surfside, 
Florida, on June 24, 2021; 
(2) honors the survivors and the 98 lives 
lost in the collapse of the Champlain Towers

heartfelt condolences to the families, loved 
ones, and friends of the victims; 
(3) commends the bravery and selfless serv-
ice demonstrated by the local, State, na-

TION OF HISTORIC AND CLASSIC 
CARS IS AN IMPORTANT PART 
OF PRESERVING THE TECHNO-
LOGICAL 
ACHIEVEMENTS 
AND 
CULTURAL 
HERITAGE 
OF 
THE 
UNITED STATES 
Mr. TESTER (for himself and Mr. 
BURR) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was considered and agreed 
to: 
S. RES. 690 
Whereas many people in the United States 
maintain classic automobiles as a pastime 
and do so with great passion and as a means 
of individual expression; 
Whereas the Senate recognizes the effect 
that the more than 100-year history of the 
automobile 
has 
had 
on 
the 
economic 
progress of the United States and supports 
wholeheartedly all activities involved in the 
restoration and exhibition of classic auto-
mobiles; 
Whereas the collection, restoration, and 
preservation of automobiles is an activity 
shared across generations and across all seg-
ments of society; 
Whereas thousands of local car clubs and 
related businesses have been instrumental in 
preserving a historic part of the heritage of 
the United States by encouraging the res-
toration and exhibition of such vintage 
works of art; 
Whereas automotive restoration provides 
well-paying, high-skilled jobs for people in 
all 50 States; and 
Whereas automobiles have provided the in-
spiration for music, photography, cinema, 
fashion, and other artistic pursuits that have 
become part of the popular culture of the 
United States: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates July 8, 2022, as ‘‘Collector

toration of historic and classic cars is an im-

and subject only to the requirements of this 
section, a person who is not prohibited by 
Federal law from possessing, transporting, 
shipping, or receiving a firearm, who is car-
rying a valid identification document con-
taining a photograph of the person, and who 
is carrying a valid license or permit which is 
issued pursuant to the law of a State and 
which permits the person to carry a con-
cealed firearm or is entitled to carry a con-
cealed firearm in the State in which the per-
son resides, may possess or carry a concealed 
handgun (other than a machine gun or de-
structive device) that has been shipped or

ecution shall bear the burden of proving, be-
yond a reasonable doubt, that the conduct of

ceeding, the court shall award the prevailing

nance, regulation, custom, or usage of any 
State or any political subdivision thereof, 
may bring an action in any appropriate 
court against any other person, including a 
State or political subdivision thereof, who 
causes the person to be subject to the depri-
vation, for damages or other appropriate re-
lief. 
‘‘(2) The court shall award a plaintiff pre-
vailing in an action brought under paragraph 
(1) damages and such other relief as the 
court deems appropriate, including a reason-
able attorney’s fee.

means a document made or issued by or 
under the authority of the United States 
Government, a State, or a political subdivi-
sion of a State which, when completed with

vidual, is of a type intended or commonly ac-
cepted for the purpose of identification of in-
dividuals.

azine for use in a handgun and any ammuni-
tion loaded into the handgun or its maga-
zine. 
‘‘(f)(1) A person who possesses or carries a 
concealed handgun under subsection (a) shall

Strike all after the enacting clause and in-
sert the following: 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Federal 
Agency Customer Experience Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that— 
(1) the Federal Government serves the peo-
ple of the United States and should seek to 
continually improve public services provided 
by the Federal Government based on cus-
tomer feedback; 
(2) the people of the United States deserve 
a Federal Government that provides effi-
cient, effective, equitable, and high-quality 
services and customer experiences across 
multiple channels; 
(3) many agencies, offices, programs, and 
Federal employees provide excellent cus-
tomer experiences to individuals, but many 
parts of the Federal Government still fall 
short on delivering the customer experience 
that individuals have come to expect from 
the private sector; 
(4) according to the 2020 American Cus-
tomer Satisfaction Index, the Federal Gov-
ernment ranks among the bottom of all in-
dustries in the United States in customer 
satisfaction; 
(5) providing an equitable, reliable, trans-
parent, and responsive customer experience 
to individuals improves the confidence of the 
people of the United States in their Govern-
ment and helps agencies achieve greater im-
pact and fulfill their missions; and 
(6) improving service to individuals re-
quires agencies to work across organiza-
tional boundaries, leverage technology, col-
lect and share standardized data, and develop 
customer-centered mindsets and experience 
strategies. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) all agencies should strive to provide a 
high-quality, courteous, effective, and effi-
cient customer experience to the people of 
the United States and seek to measure, col-
lect, report, and use metrics relating to the

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Federal 
Agency Customer Experience Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that— 
(1) the Federal Government serves the peo-
ple of the United States and should seek to 
continually improve public services provided 
by the Federal Government based on cus-
tomer feedback; 
(2) the people of the United States deserve 
a Federal Government that provides effi-
cient, effective, equitable, and high-quality 
services and customer experiences across 
multiple channels; 
(3) many agencies, offices, programs, and 
Federal employees provide excellent cus-
tomer experiences to individuals, but many 
parts of the Federal Government still fall 
short on delivering the customer experience 
that individuals have come to expect from 
the private sector; 
(4) according to the 2020 American Cus-
tomer Satisfaction Index, the Federal Gov-
ernment ranks among the bottom of all in-
dustries in the United States in customer 
satisfaction; 
(5) providing an equitable, reliable, trans-
parent, and responsive customer experience 
to individuals improves the confidence of the 
people of the United States in their Govern-
ment and helps agencies achieve greater im-
pact and fulfill their missions; and 
(6) improving service to individuals re-
quires agencies to work across organiza-
tional boundaries, leverage technology, col-
lect and share standardized data, and develop 
customer-centered mindsets and experience 
strategies. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) all agencies should strive to provide a 
high-quality, courteous, effective, and effi-
cient customer experience to the people of 
the United States and seek to measure, col-
lect, report, and use metrics relating to the 
experience of individuals interacting with 
agencies to continually improve the cus-
tomer experience of the people of the United 
States; and 
(2) adequate Federal funding is needed to 
ensure agency staffing levels that can pro-
vide the public with an improved customer 
experience.

ORDER FOR ADJOURNMENT 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, if

The Senator from Michigan. 
f 
BIPARTISAN SAFER COMMUNITIES 
ACT 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, for far 
too long, Americans have grappled 
with the epidemic of gun violence that 
has taken lives and shattered families 
and communities in my home State of 
Michigan as well as all across the coun-
try. 
These shootings and attacks not only 
cause unimaginable pain and grief for 
victims and their families but terrorize 
entire communities, who must cope 
with the lasting effects of unspeakable 
tragedy in their schools, in their thea-
ters, houses of worship, and other pub-
lic places. 
There is no one easy solution to ad-
dress this matter, but Americans de-
serve to feel safe where they live, 
where they work and learn and shop 
and pray; and these senseless acts of vi-
olence occur far too often. 
From the Sandy Hook Elementary 
massacre of young students and school 
staff, to the Emanuel African Meth-
odist Episcopal Church and the Tree of 
Life synagogue shootings that killed 
Americans 
simply 
practicing 
their 
faith, to the deadly and hateful and 
heinous attacks at Pulse nightclub and 
a grocery store in Buffalo, gun violence 
has left no corner of our country un-
touched. 
In Michigan, sadly, we know all too 
well the terror and the devastation 
caused by gun violence. Late last year, 
in Oxford, MI, a horrific shooting un-
folded at Oxford High School. In a mat-
ter of just mere minutes, a routine 
school day at Oxford High turned into 
a scene of chaos and heartbreak when a 
gunman—a 
15-year-old 
classmate— 
opened fire inside the school, taking 
four young lives and wounding seven 
other 
people. 
That 
attack 
forever 
changed the lives of the students, the 
teachers, staff, and shattered the as-
sumption that schools are a safe haven. 
Oxford High School students and the 
entire community have been resilient, 
but as they continued to process the 
shooting and to work to heal from it, 
those emotional wounds again re-
opened for many when they watched 
yet another horrific scene play out at 
Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, 
TX, where 19 young students and 2 
teachers were murdered. 
Schools are supposed to be a safe 
haven. Parents and family members 
should not live in fear that their chil-
dren or their loved ones who are at 
work won’t return home at the end of 
that school day. And while there is no 
single solution to end the gun violence 
epidemic, for far too long, partisan 
gridlock has prevented Congress from 
advancing 
commonsense 
legislation 
that can save lives. 
For decades, politics have stood in 
the way of progress, and that is despite 
90 percent of the American people—in-
cluding a majority of Republican vot-
ers—supporting 
commonsense 
steps 
like expanding background checks. In 
today’s partisan environment, it is 
tough to get consensus, but that just 
shows how much support there is to 
getting something done. 
This should not be a partisan issue. 
We know that many responsible gun 
owners across our country support gun 
safety legislation. I am a gun owner. I 
enjoy hunting, as do so many in Michi-
gan, and I know that we can pass meas-
ures to improve public safety while 
protecting the rights of law-abiding 
citizens. 
After nearly three decades without 
major progress, we are on the verge— 
on the verge—of a significant break-
through as we consider the Bipartisan 
Safer Communities Act. This legisla-
tion will take important steps to ad-
dress gun violence, improve school 
safety, and increase mental health re-
sources. 
There is no question that this legisla-
tion could have included additional 
measures that are overwhelmingly sup-
ported by a majority of the American 
people, but this is still a significant 
step forward. We cannot let the perfect 
be the enemy of the good. This bill will 
help protect our children, our schools, 
and our communities.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3098 
June 22, 2022 
And by passing this bill, we can make 
progress right now. Right now, with 
this legislation, we can strengthen 
background checks for gun buyers 
under the age of 21 and keep guns out 
of the hands of dangerous people who 
simply should not have them. This in-
cludes providing critical support for 
red flag laws at the State level to en-
sure deadly weapons are kept out of 
the hands of individuals who a court 
has determined to be a significant dan-
ger to themselves or to others. 
And right now, we can offer protec-
tions to victims of domestic violence 
by adding convicted abusers in dating 
relationships to the National Instant 
Criminal Background Check System. 
And right now, we can crack down on 
criminals who illegally evade licensing 
requirements. 
Right now, we can increase funding 
for school safety to institute safety 
measures in and around schools and 
support school violence prevention ef-
forts. Right now, we can improve ac-
cess to essential mental health care re-
sources, which school safety advocates 
and violence prevention professionals 
agree is the key—the key—to providing 
an early opportunity for intervention— 
by investing in school-based health 
services to support those impacted by 
traumatic events. 
I am grateful to my colleague Sen-
ator STABENOW, who has led the charge 
to ensure that legislation include prov-
en, 
effective 
initiatives 
that 
will 
strengthen mental health services, and 
I urge my colleagues to work together 
to pass this legislation and encourage 
the House of Representatives to quick-
ly—to quickly—do the same and send it 
to the President to be signed into law. 
But know this: The bottom line is 
that our work to save lives and protect 
public safety must not end here. We 
must continue to come together and 
address this very real threat that is 
hurting communities all across our 
country. When we face difficult chal-
lenges and crises here in our country, 
we persevere because we ultimately 
come together as one. Let’s channel 
this spirit and come together for every 
American before the next school, the 
next family, and the next community 
is shattered. 
I yield the floor.

June 22, 2022 
ACTIVE SHOOTER ALERT ACT OF 
2022 
SPEECH OF 
HON. NANCY PELOSI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 21, 2022 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
support of the Active Shooter Alert Act, an-
other strong step to help save lives from the 
scourge of gun violence. 
On average, more than 300 Americans are 
shot every day across the country—including 
more than 20 precious children. 
Many are horrifically murdered in mass 
shootings, as we have sadly witnessed in 
Uvalde, Buffalo and many more communities. 
And tragically, hundreds more fall victim to 
the daily massacre of gun crime, which rarely 
makes the evening news. 
These shootings often unfold in the heart of 
our communities: 
in homes and in our neighborhoods; 
in our schools and on our streets; 
at our malls and in our movie theaters. 
But right now, there’s no efficient and effec-
tive way for law enforcement to warn nearby 
families to avoid the site of a shooting—which 
is putting more innocent lives at risk. 
That is why, today, the House will pass 
strong, bipartisan legislation to quickly warn 
communities when a gunman opens fire. 
Our Active Shooter Alert Act will help set up 
a system similar to AMBER Alerts—helping 
state and local law enforcement agencies to 
notify those in the area of an active shooter 
threat. 
With a more unified, streamlined and stand-
ardized system, we can keep communities 
better informed and prevent more innocent 
families from unknowingly walking into danger. 
Let us salute an unyielding champion in the 
fight against gun violence, Congressman 
DAVID CICILLINE, for crafting this commonsense 
and life-saving measure. 
And importantly, this vital legislation has the 
support of many major law enforcement orga-
nizations, who have called for its passage, in-
cluding: 
the National Sherriffs’ Association; 
the Major Cities Chiefs Associations; 
the National Association of Police Organiza-
tions; 
the Fraternal Order of Police; 
the National Police Foundation; 
and the National District Attorneys Associa-
tion. 
As we pass this bill today, we remain pray-
erful that the Senate will pass bipartisan legis-
lation to prevent gun violence. 
While more is needed, this bill will take 
steps to save lives. 
These measures would represent the most 
significant gun violence prevention legislation 
in three decades—breaking through the grid-
lock that has long blocked House-passed bills 
from becoming law. 
At the same time, our Democratic House 
Majority will never stop fighting for more life- 
saving measures. 
House Democrats have twice passed the Bi-
partisan Background Checks Act and the En-
hanced Background Checks Act, to secure 
universal background checks on all gun pur-
chases. 
Earlier this month, we passed our Protecting 
Our Kids Act to: 
raise the age to 21 years old to buy weap-
ons of war; 
ban high-capacity magazines designed for 
mass murder; 
ensure safe storage to protect our children 
from tragic accidents; 
and take additional steps to save lives. 
Mr. Speaker, our fight to prevent gun vio-
lence is of, by and for the children. 
Of the children, because they are suffering. 
It is heartbreaking that, in America, more chil-
dren die from guns than any other cause. 
By the children, because they are leading. 
We see them marching in the streets, testi-
fying before the Congress, demanding action. 
And always For The Children: building a fu-
ture where every child can reach his or her 
fulfillment, free from the fear of gun violence. 
Protecting our children must be a unifying 
mission in the Congress—as it is a unifying 
issue for the American people. 
And nowhere will we find more agreement 
than this commonsense measure to help keep 
innocent families out of the line of fire. 
I urge a strong, bipartisan ‘‘aye’’ vote for this 
life-saving legislation.

IN 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
LAURA 
NAKASAKA FOR TWO YEARS OF 
OUTSTANDING SERVICE 
HON. SUZAN K. DelBENE 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 22, 2022 
Ms. DELBENE. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to thank Laura Nakasaka for nearly two years 
of invaluable service to my office and my con-
stituents in Washington’s 1st Congressional 
District. 
Laura joined my office as a Staff Assistant 
and Press Assistant in September 2020 during 
the height of the pandemic and has worked 
tirelessly to ensure my constituents are kept 
up-to-date on my work for the district. Laura 
has brought a tremendous positive attitude, 
hard work ethic, and wonderful creativity to the 
role. 
Over her tenure, she played an instrumental 
role in overseeing the smooth ramp up of in- 
person constituent services as we transitioned 
back to being in the office, training and men-
toring our interns to ensure seamless front of-
fice operations, and boosting our social media 
presence through innovative strategies—all 
while building lasting relationships with my 
team and those who had the pleasure of get-
ting to know her. In addition, her incredible 
knowledge of caring for plants has also in-
spired many in our office to become plant par-
ents themselves. Laura has been an amazing 
staffer and a wonderful friend to all in the of-
fice, and we will all sorely miss her. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Laura Nakasaka and wishing 
her the best in all of her future endeavors.

HONORING DR. REIN BEEUWKES 
HON. DONALD S. BEYER, JR. 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 22, 2022 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
with my friend and colleague Congresswoman 
LORI TRAHAN to recognize the work of Dr. Rein 
Beeuwkes and his recognition as the first re-
cipient of the MIT Better World Alumni Service 
Award. This award honors a single MIT alum-
nus who ‘‘has demonstrated the ability, pas-
sion, and unwavering commitment for working 
wisely creatively and effectively to advance 
the MIT idea for the betterment of human-
kind.’’ 
In 2005, deeply concerned about the need 
to move the U.S. and the world to a low car-
bon sustainable future, Rein recognized that in 
order to meet even the modest climate goals 
that had been set, there would need to be 
major technological breakthroughs. After con-
siderable research, Rein was persuaded that 
fusion energy could become one of those 
breakthroughs if government adequately fund-
ed it and if the scientists working on fusion di-
rected their focus to getting energy to the grid 
at a competitive price. 
Rein, affectionately known as ‘‘fusion man,’’ 
has become the evangelist for the potential 
and promise of fusion energy. Rein has 
worked tirelessly with the community of fusion 
scientists to set goals that will bring fusion en-
ergy to the grid in this decade. Rein was in-
strumental in urging the formation of the bipar-
tisan Congressional Fusion Energy Caucus. 
Over the past decade, Rein has been an 
enthusiastic citizen-advocate for an acceler-
ated fusion energy program in which MIT’s 
Plasma Science and Fusion Center has 
played a leading role. Rein’s support for MIT’s 
fusion research helped spur the first commer-
cial nuclear fusion reactor in North America 
which is being built in Devens, MA by Com-
monwealth Fusion Systems.

and more than 4 decades, where he recorded 
and reported the events of Huntington Beach. 
Not only is he a lifelong Southern Califor-
nian, but he is truly a trailblazer in the field of 
cable journalism. With programs like his 
‘‘Local Cable Update. ‘‘Made in Huntington 
Beach,’’ and ‘‘Surf City Highlights,’’ Mr. 
Liffreing has brought everything from important 
current events to exciting local businesses to 
the airwaves, sharing the stories of our vibrant 
communities. 
Today, on behalf of all Orange County, l 
want to thank Mr. Liffreing and congratulate 
him on his 40 years of service to our commu-
nity.

INTRODUCTION 
OF 
THE 
POSTAL 
POLICE AUTHORITY CLARIFYING 
ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 22, 2022 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to introduce the Postal Police Authority Clari-
fying Act, which would clarify that United 
States Postal Police Officers (PPOs) have au-
thority to protect mail, postal property and 
postal employees both on and off United 
States Postal Service (USPS) real property. 
PPOs had been performing their duties both 
on and off USPS real property, but USPS has 
recently informed them that their statutory po-
lice powers are limited to USPS real property. 
Under federal law, Postal Inspectors are au-
thorized ‘‘to investigate criminal matters re-
lated to the Postal Service and the mails 
. . .,’’ while PPOs are authorized to protect 
the ‘‘property owned or occupied by the Postal 
Service or under the charge and control of the 
Postal Service, and persons on that property, 
including duty in areas outside the property to 
the extent necessary to protect the property 
and persons on the property.’’ USPS has re-
cently informed PPOs that property consists 
only of USPS real property, so PPO police 
powers are limited to USPS real property. This 
narrow interpretation of the statute severely 
limits the ability of PPOs to protect mail and 
postal staff. 
There has been an increase in mail theft na-
tionally, including through the theft of stolen 
universal keys, formally referred to as ‘‘arrow 
keys.’’ A constituent recently contacted my of-
fice after checks they put in a blue collection 
box were stolen. Thieves changed the payees 
and dollar amounts on the checks, and tens of 
thousands of dollars were stolen from my con-
stituent’s account. This is just one example of 
the increased mail theft occurring now, and is 
ample evidence of the need for legislation to 
clarify the authority of PPOs to fully protect 
mail and postal employees. 
I urge my colleagues to support this legisla-
tion. 
SPECIAL 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
NORTHVIEW HIGH SCHOOL WIN-
NING 
THE 
DIVISION 
I 
STATE 
BASEBALL CHAMPIONSHIP 
HON. ROBERT E. LATTA 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 22, 2022 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, it is with a 
great deal of pride that I rise to pay a very 
special tribute to an outstanding high school 
baseball team in Ohio’s Fifth Congressional 
District. The young men of the Northview High 
School baseball team have represented their 
school ably on their way to achieving the Divi-
sion I State Baseball Title. The Northview 
Wildcats overcame the challenges posed by 
intense competition in their effort to surpass all 
other teams in the Division I State Baseball 
Playoffs. 
In pursuing the State Championship, the 
Northview Wildcats defeated their outstanding 
competitors to win their first state baseball 
championship. The members of this very spe-
cial team have shown that their sport requires 
an individual effort for a team result. Their 
hard work and dedication, both on and off the 
field, in achieving this accomplishment should 
be commended. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the Northview High School 
baseball team. On behalf of the people of the 
Fifth District of Ohio, I am proud to recognize 
this great achievement.

INTRODUCTION OF THE AFFORD-
ABLE AND ACCESSIBLE INFANT 
FORMULA ACT 
HON. EARL BLUMENAUER 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 22, 2022 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, today 
I am pleased to introduce the Affordable and 
Accessible Infant Formula Act, legislation to 
temporarily suspend tariffs on imported infant 
formula. 
As we’ve all seen, families across the coun-
try have been facing a devastating infant for-
mula shortage. Between the closure of an Ab-
bott plant in Michigan in February and general 
supply chain struggles, out-of-stock rates for 
formula have been growing exponentially. At 
the end of May, ten states and fourteen metro-
politan areas have out-of-stock rates higher 
than 90 percent. To make matters worse, re-
starting formula production at Abbott’s Michi-
gan plan was further delayed after flooding 
from severe storms. 
The Biden-Harris Administration has acted 
swiftly to respond to the crisis. In May, the 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) took un-
precedented action to temporarily exercise en-
forcement discretion to increase infant formula 
in the United States. As of June 10, the Biden- 
Harris Administration has secured commit-
ments to import 130.7 million bottles of for-
mula. 
The FDA’s actions have allowed formula to 
be imported from around the world including 
Germany, Switzerland, and England. However, 
infant formula faces a substantial tariff when 
imported from countries without a Free Trade 
Agreement or that are not part of a preference 
program. As infant formula is imported into the 
United States during this period of an infant 
formula shortage, tariffs will increase the cost 
of the formula by approximately 27 percent on 
average. 
At a time of unprecedented crisis, the fed-
eral government should swiftly seek to remove 
any barriers that exacerbate the crisis. The 
FDA has done this by exercising enforcement 
discretion. Now, it is up to Congress to tempo-
rarily suspend the tariffs on imported infant 
formula so that imported formula is affordable 
for working families. Suspending these tariffs 
for the duration of the FDA’s current easing 
import restrictions will lower the cost of infant 
formula at a time when working families and 
single parents are struggling. 
I urge my colleagues to support this bipar-
tisan legislation and bring relief to families 
across the country.

HONORING AND CONGRATULATING 
THE SERVICE OF EARL ANGELES 
HON. VICKY HARTZLER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 22, 2022 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the dedicated service of Earl 
Angeles and congratulate him on his retire-
ment. With over 38 years of federal service, 
Mr. Angeles recently worked as a Medical 
Technician with the 509th Healthcare Oper-
ations Squadron at Whiteman Air Force Base 
where he provided his peers with superior 
leadership, dedication, and an outstanding ef-
fort on a wide variety of projects and major 
programs that have impacted the Air Force 
Global Strike Command, and the United 
States Air Force. 
After serving an honorable 24 years in the 
United States Air Force, Mr. Angeles began 
his career as a Medical Technician in 2007 
where he performed 64,000 tests annually for 
12,000 beneficiaries in eight departments. He 
continuously worked to bring innovative meth-
ods to the medical group which includes cre-
ating specimen label printing capabilities that 
improved patient safety and saved the wing 
$2,600. He was coined by the squadron com-
mander for his initiative. 
At the start of the global Coronavirus pan-
demic in 2020, Mr. Angeles played a pivotal 
role in the emergency response of Whiteman 
Air Force Base and the two following years, 
he assisted in processing 8,700 Coronavirus 
disease samples, and the testing of over 
3,000 rapid in-house patient samples. Mr. An-
geles also helped with the modernization of 
the laboratory’s capabilities by putting into 
place three analyzers that have increased 
testing accuracy, and reduced result turn-
around times by 97 percent. 
For over two decades, Mr. Angeles has de-
voted his service to the development of the 
laboratory where he has been a key asset to 
the wing and Whiteman Air Force Base. His 
extraordinary talents and determination have 
led him to win various awards and recogni-
tions. It is a great honor that I recognize the 
dedicated service and retirement of Mr. Earl 
Angeles. Please join me in congratulating him 
for many years of service to our nation and to 
the United States Air Force.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

CELEBRATION OF THE LIFE AND 
LEGACY OF BOB JULIANO 
HON. BOBBY L. RUSH 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 22, 2022 
Mr. RUSH. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
celebrate the life and legacy of Bob Juliano, 
an ally of the working man and a friend to so 
many who worked with him. 
Juliano, who referred to himself as ‘‘Cool 
Bobby J’’, was born and raised in the west 
side of Chicago—a city he dearly loved. He 
started his career in the hospitality industry in 
Chicago but moved to Washington to rep-
resent the legislative interests of the Hotel and 
Restaurant Employees International Union. 
He made strong relationship with Members 
on both sides of the aisle and from different 
parts of the country. Juliana’s success in D.C. 
was driven by the fact that he didn’t view the 
Members by the letters next to their names, 
but how each elected official cared about their 
constituents and everyday people. Juliano 
easily related to people as he advocated for 
improving the lives of our constituents, which 
endeared him to us. He managed relation-
ships beautifully, not just Members of the 
House and Senate, but our Congressional of-
fice staff as well. 
True to the spirit of his role, Juliano also 
seemed to know every service worker on the 
Hill, whom he extended the same level of 
kindness and respect as he would show lead-
ership. This embodied why we so deeply ad-
mired him, because he valued each person’s 
work and showed it. 
He made strong ties to members of the 
Congressional Black Caucus, because his de-
votion to people shined through in how he ad-
vocated about issues, especially when it came 
to the fight for equality. Bob always main-
tained that civil rights was the defining issue of 
our generation. 
The relationships he established and main-
tained around the Hill helped him shepherd 
labor legislation through both chambers, in-
cluding when it came to issues of middle- 
class, hardworking Americans and protecting 
health care of hospitality workers. 
A true Chicagoan, he never forgot where he 
came from and who helped him along the 
way. Although he passed last year, his spirit 
and memory still live on with everyone he 
worked with in D.C., reminding all of us of the 
importance of bipartisanship and treating oth-
ers with respect. 
Madam Speaker, it was a blessing to know 
him, and I am honored to have been able to 
call him a friend. My thoughts are with him, his 
family, and all who loved him. 
HONORING GENERAL MICHAEL X. 
GARRETT 
FOR 
38 
YEARS 
OF 
MILITARY SERVICE 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 22, 2022 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor U.S. Army General Michael X. Gar-
rett for 38 years of dedicated military service, 
culminating with more than three years of dis-
tinguished service as the Commanding Gen-
eral of U.S. Army Forces Command at Fort 
Bragg, North Carolina. 
Gen. Garrett personifies a life of service. 
The son of an Army command sergeant major 
decorated for valor in the Vietnam War, Gen. 
Garrett began his own Army career in 1984 as 
an Infantry officer and served his first assign-
ment within the 24th Infantry Division (Mecha-
nized) where his father also served as the di-
vision’s senior noncommissioned officer. 
Gen. Garrett went on to serve his formative 
years as a lieutenant, captain, and major in 
the elite 75th Ranger Regiment, where he 
wore the scrolls of the regimental head-
quarters and each of its three ranger battal-
ions. He was in command of an airborne in-
fantry battalion at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, 
on Sept. 11, 2001, when our Nation was thrust 
into the longest period of war in its history. 
Through these years of combat, Gen. Garrett 
led America’s sons and daughters through 
multiple deployments in the Middle East, in-
cluding his first to Afghanistan less than a 
year after Sept. 11 as a member of Fort 
Bragg’s XVIII Airborne Corps, and later as 
commander of a newly formed Alaska-based 
airborne brigade which fought valiantly through 
15 months of heavy combat in Iraq. As a gen-
eral officer, he has led service members pre-
paring for and serving in war from influential 
positions of responsibility, including as XVIII 
Airborne Corps and U.S. Central Command 
chief of staff, and as commanding general of 
U.S. Army Alaska, U.S. Army Central, and 
U.S. Army Forces Command. 
On account of his exemplary service, Gen. 
Garrett has received many of our nation’s 
most impressive distinctions and awards, in-
cluding the Distinguished Service Medal, the 
Defense Superior Service Medal with one 
bronze oak leaf cluster, the Legion of Merit 
with two oak leaf clusters, and the Bronze Star 
Medal with one bronze oak leaf cluster, 
among many others. He is a proud Ranger, 
paratrooper, and Soldier, and has been 
named a Distinguished Member of the 75th 
Ranger Regiment. Gen. Garrett represents the 
best our nation has to offer, and we will look 
up to his leadership for generations to come. 
As Fort Bragg’s Congressman, I know I 
speak for our Nation and community when I 
say we are truly grateful for Gen. Garrett’s ex-
ceptional service. I would like to offer my sin-
cerest appreciation and wish him and his fam-
ily success in all their future endeavors. 
PASSING OF MARK FLANAGAN 
HON. STEVE COHEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 22, 2022 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to pay a special tribute to my friend and long-
time supporter Mark Flanagan, known in Mem-
phis as the Mayor of Midtown, who passed 
last week. Mr. Flanagan contributed immeas-
urably to our community, founding the Irish 
Eyes of Memphis pub crawl from downtown to 
Overton Square that produced an annual bo-
nanza for the bars and businesses along the 
route. He had the original idea to develop the 
Cooper-Young neighborhood that now thrives 
with businesses and nightlife. Born in Wash-
ington, D.C., on March 13, 1943, he was the 
second oldest of nine children. Growing up in 
the District, he developed a lifelong love of 
politics, and was dubbed the Mayor of Adams 
Morgan, a D.C. neighborhood. (When he re-
turned to D.C. to care after aging relatives, he 
was the Prince of Cleveland Park.) His father, 
Frip Flanagan, was a close friend of House 
Speaker Thomas P. ‘‘Tip’’ O’Neill and the Ken-
nedy family, especially Bobby Kennedy. He 
was proud of his Irish heritage and loved 
spending his summers in Lisdoonvarna, Ire-
land. He and the late Thomas ‘‘Silky’’ Sullivan 
started a barbecue contest in Fanore, Ireland, 
so the Irish would learn about Memphis bar-
becue. Mark attended East Carolina University 
and American University in D.C. His profes-
sional career included plywood retail sales, 
real estate, and restaurant investments as well 
as associations with the late restaurateurs 
Silky Sullivan, Bud Chittom and Thomas 
Boggs. He came to Memphis in 1968 and pro-
ceeded to have a positive impact on the city, 
and became a kind of Pied Piper to many 
D.C. fellas who were encouraged to move to 
Memphis, including Joe (‘‘forehead’’) Dough-
erty; the Boland twins, Jim and Chris; William 
‘‘Bill’’ (Gringo) McGaughey; Bob ‘‘Doctor’’ Har-
per; the Juice, former Navy SEAL O.J. Mitch-
ell, and his brother Mike (Marcel), and Mark’s 
beloved brother Dennis. In 1973, he founded 
the Memphis St. Patrick’s Day Parade and 
Pub Crawl, the forerunner of the Beale Street 
Saint Patrick’s Day Parade. He served on the 
boards of the Hollywood Child Care Center 
and the ACLU, on the Shelby County and 
State Democratic Executive Committees, and 
was a 1980 delegate for Ted Kennedy at the 
Democratic National Convention. He ran for 
Congress on the Democratic ticket in the ’70s 
and ’80s. A founding member of the Irish Eyes 
of Memphis, he was also active in the Mem-
phis Irish Society. He worked with the late 
Irvin Salky on the first Beale Street Music Fes-
tival. He was active in Saving Overton Park 
and worked with Dr. David and Yvonne Acey 
on Memphis Honors Africa in April. Flanagan 
worked closely with me early in my career 
when I was the Memphis Police legal advisor, 
and together we petitioned the city to establish 
a 20 mile an hour speed limit to make Overton 
Square safely walkable. Mark had a huge 
heart and a larger personality. I extend my 
sincere condolences to his children, his sib-
lings and his many friends. His was a life well- 
lived, and he will be missed.

IN RECOGNITION OF KYLE HILL 
FOR 
FIVE 
YEARS 
OF 
OUT-
STANDING SERVICE 
HON. SUZAN K. DelBENE 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 22, 2022 
Ms. DELBENE. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to thank Kyle Hill for nearly five years of in-
valuable service to my office and my constitu-
ents in Washington’s 1st Congressional Dis-
trict. 
Kyle joined my office as a Legislative Assist-
ant in October 2017 and soon after became 
my Legislative Director. Prior to coming to my 
office, Kyle worked for the Hon. Steve Israel of 
New York for four years as well. 
In each of these roles, Kyle exceeded the 
mark and met the challenges that come with 
running a legislative team with his wealth of 
knowledge, quick wit, and joyful personality. 
Over his tenure, he played an instrumental 
role in overseeing the smooth management of 
a fast-paced office and shaping internal proc-
esses—all while building lasting relationships 
with my team and those who had the pleasure 
of getting to know him. We all also deeply ad-
mire and are inspired by his commitment to 
reducing his carbon footprint by biking to work 
every day, regardless of the weather. Kyle has 
been an amazing leader, a terrific mentor, and 
a wonderful friend, and we will all sorely miss 
him. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Kyle Hill and wishing him the 
best in all of his future endeavors.

CALLING FOR STABILITY AND THE 
CESSATION OF VIOLENCE AND 
CONDEMNING 
ISIS-AFFILIATED 
TERRORIST ACTIVITY IN NORTH-
ERN 
MOZAMBIQUE, 
INCLUDING 
THE CABO DELGADO PROVINCE, 
AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 21, 2022 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of this resolution calling for the sta-
bility and the cessation of violence and con-
demning ISIS-affiliated terrorist activity in 
northern Mozambique. 
For months, insurgents linked to the Islamic 
State have attacked innocent Mozambican citi-
zens and soldiers in the region of Cabo 
Delgado. 
The region is home to one of the world’s 
richest natural gas reservoirs, making it the 
target of considerable attention for Islamic rev-
olutionaries. 
Since the early 2010s, a mixture of eco-
nomic inequality, unemployment, and a reli-
gious movement have bred a strong, violent 
extremist organization called Ansar al-Sunna. 
That movement is now characterized by 
cells of the Islamic State working to terrorize 
the Mozambican people, funded by illegal drug 
and ivory trading. 
The violence has displaced nearly one mil-
lion people and killed thousands of others. 
The insurgents decimate villages, especially 
targeting Christian districts, while murdering ci-
vilians with terrifying callousness. 
This resolution calls on the government of 
Mozambique, 
specifically 
President 
Filipe 
Nyusi, to finally take action to counter the ex-
tremism. 
Under the status quo, people are killed for 
practicing their religion, and extremists have 
overrun all forms of policing in the Northern 
province. 
A right to liberty and justice is not something 
designed only for Americans or those in the 
West. Every human being deserves an equi-
table chance to pursue a fulfilling, secure life. 
That opportunity is being stripped away by 
deadly revolutionaries in Mozambique. It is 
time for this Congress to take a stand against 
an insurgency that has decimated lives since 
2017. 
As defenders of the defenseless, America 
must 
take 
a 
stand 
and 
pressure 
the 
Mozambican government to protect its own 
citizens.

CALLING 
ON 
THE 
GOVERNMENT 
OF THE REPUBLIC OF RWANDA 
TO 
RELEASE 
PAUL 
RUSESABAGINA 
ON 
HUMANI-
TARIAN GROUNDS 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 21, 2022 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of H. Res. 892: Calling on the Govern-
ment of the Republic of Rwanda to Release 
Paul Rusesabagina on Humanitarian Grounds. 
The resolution calls on the government of 
Rwanda 
to 
immediately 
release 
Paul 
Rusesabagina on humanitarian grounds, en-
sure that he receives access to appropriate 
qualified medical professionals and all medical 
care, and permit him to return safely to the 
United States . 
The resolution als urges the U.S. govern-
ment in all interactions with the government of 
Rwanda to raise e case of Paul Rusesabagina 
and to press for his immediate release on hu-
manitarian grounds. 
Paul Rusesabagina is a 67-year-old cancer 
survivor who suffers from a cardiovascular dis-
order, and his permanent residency is in 
Texas. 
He is also very special in the eyes of our 
entire nation, as he is a Presidential Medal of 
Freedom honoree. 
He came to global prominence because he 
was the manager of the Hoˆtel des Mille 
Collines in Kigali, a hotel that provided safe 
haven to over 1,200 Hutu and Tutsi refugees 
during the 1994 Rwandan genocide. 
In August 2020, Mr. Rusesabagina, on a 
flight 
meant 
to 
land 
in 
Burundi, 
was 
extrajudicially transferred to Kigali by the 
Rwandan government and put on trial. 
He was immediately arrested, although the 
Rwandan government did not acknowledge his 
detention for three days during which he was 
reportedly subjected to torture. 
Paul Rusesabagina was sentenced to 25 
years in prison on September 20, 2021. 
The rogue extrajudicial transfer of Mr. 
Rusesabagina from Texas to Rwanda, and the 
subsequent trial, have been widely criticized 
by human rights organizations for the lack of 
fair trial standards, including violations of attor-
ney-client privilege. 
Human 
Rights 
Watch 
called 
the 
trial 
‘‘flawed’’ and ‘‘emblematic of the government’s 
overreach and manipulation of the justice sys-
tem.’’ 
The U.S. State Department said it was 
‘‘concerned’’ about Rusesabagina’s ‘‘lack of 
confidential, unimpeded access to his lawyers 
and relevant case documents and his initial 
lack of access to counsel.’’ 
His own daughters only get to speak to him 
for about five minutes once a week. 
Mr. Rusesabagina has been a vocal critic of 
Rwandan President Paul Kagame, accusing 
the president of war crimes and human rights 
violations, and is suffering because of it. 
Our Constitution was built with the belief 
that every person has the right to express po-
litical dissent. 
An attack on free speech anywhere is an at-
tack on our American values. 
The reported lack of fair trial guarantees 
calls into question the fairness of the verdict 
and the lack of protections meant to be con-
sistent with Rwanda’s international commit-
ment. 
To allow a foreign government to abduct 
and hold hostage an American permanent 
resident without a fair trial is to turn our back 
on a fundamental rule of law and democracy. 
I urge all my colleagues to support H. Res. 
892, calling on the Government of the Repub-
lic of Rwanda to Release Paul Rusesabagina 
on Humanitarian Grounds.

NATIONAL COMPUTER FORENSICS 
INSTITUTE 
REAUTHORIZATION 
ACT OF 2022 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 21, 2022 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I 
stand in support of H.R. 7174, the ‘‘National, 
Computer Forensics Institute Reauthorization 
Act of 2022’’ which will bolster the education 
of those defending the American people 
against cyber security threats. 
Soon after the devastating attacks on 9/11, 
Congress passed the Homeland Security Act 
of 2002 through which it consolidated the sep-
arate branches of our security efforts into one 
dedicated office. 
Through this Act, the Department of Home-
land Security provided provisions such as in-
frastructure protection, chemical, biological, 
and nuclear defenses, as well as other meas-
ures to safeguard national security. 
Congress voted in 2012 to reauthorize these 
important protections. We gather here to do so 
again today. 
During the drafting of the Homeland Secu-
rity Act of 2002, the United States faced a 
wave of terrorism and extremism that threat-
ened the lives and liberties of our people. 
Today, enemies of the State have evolved 
to infiltrate our computers, cell phones, and 
cyber infrastructure. 
As a result, companies, organizations, and 
entire cities are targets for attacks. 
Last year, more than 400 U.S. government 
offices were held ransom or affected by a di-
rect cyber threat. 
In 2018, Atlanta, Georgia was nearly crip-
pled by a ransomware attack that wreaked 
havoc on utilities, parking, and other services 
in the city. Atlanta taxpayers spent over $2.6 
million in recovery efforts. 
Last year, Washington, D.C.’s Metropolitan 
Police Department was targeted by cyber- 
thugs threatening to publish countless pieces 
of sensitive data including arrest records, the 
identities of persons of interest, and even the 
names of confidential police informants. 
In December, a Los Angeles location of 
Planned Parenthood had the private health in-
formation of 400,000 patients stolen through 
ransomware. Addresses, birthdays, and diag-
noses of patients were in the hands of those 
who meant to do the American people harm. 
Ransomware attacks cost federal, state, and 
local government agencies about $915 million 
last year. 
Our Nation is vulnerable. 
We are at risk. 
We must be proactive to protect against 
larger and more sophisticated attacks. 
That is why I stand in support of the ‘‘Na-
tional Computer Forensics Institute Reauthor-
ization Act of 2022’’ which will continue efforts 
to train, educate and equip State, local, terri-
torial, and Tribal law enforcement officers to 
combat cyber-attacks for another 10 years. 
With this amended reauthorization, Con-
gress would balance the need for cybersecu-
rity with the prioritization of civil rights, civil lib-
erties, and the safeguarding of private data. 
It would also designate curriculum for the In-
stitute, authorize full or partial funding towards 
attendance at the Institute, require reports of 
efficacy, future need, and demographic infor-
mation, as well as expand on the physical and 
virtual capacities of the Institute’s academic 
reach. 
H.R. 7174 would amend the Homeland Se-
curity Act of 2002 to better train those who de-
fend our country from cyber threats today, 
while preparing for the advanced threats com-
ing tomorrow. 
Perhaps the most important section of this 
Act is the provision outlining the research and 
development of systems and procedures to 
enhance the Institute’s capabilities and capac-
ity for the future. 
If cyber-attackers are willing to target Amer-
ican cities, agencies, and companies today, 
there is little question that they will be willing 
to target even more tomorrow. 
Our best weapon against such threats is an 
educated and empowered league of law en-
forcement and IT professionals working to de-
fend the nation’s data, privacy, and security. 
Once again, I offer my support for H.R. 
7174, ‘‘National Computer Forensics Institute 
Reauthorization Act of 2022’’ and encourage 
my colleagues to do the same.

NDO FAIRNESS ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 21, 2022 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in defense of Americans’ right to due process 
in support of the NDO Fairness Act. 
This bill amends 18 U.S.C. 2705 to increase 
the federal regulation of law enforcement’s 
use of non-disclosure orders or ‘‘gag orders’’. 
H.R. 7072 requires federal prosecutors to 
have obtained a written determination from a 
court proving that their use of a non-disclosure 
order is necessary. 
This bill also would establish a 30-day limit 
for gag orders, which can be extended for 30 
days if deemed necessary. 
After the gag-order expires, law enforce-
ment must ensure that the person subject to 
the gag-order has been notified within 72 
hours. 
This bill also creates the historic and nec-
essary right for cellular service providers to 
contest prosecutors’ gag orders in court. 
Under the status quo, the process for pros-
ecutors to request and be granted access to 
an individual’s personal electronic communica-
tion is streamlined, unregulated, and relatively 
unrestrained. 
Prosecutors then petition for a non-disclo-
sure order, stripping the subject’s right to 
know their personal information is being 
searched. 
The NDO also prohibits the subject’s ability 
to block the search of their personal data. 
If this intrusion were done in-person—mean-
ing that the government shows up to a per-
son’s home, accesses their desktop, secures 
their personal data, and then refuses to tell 
that citizen—Americans would be outraged. 
The searching of online data is just as egre-
gious a violation of personal privacy. 
Establishing transparency within our democ-
racy, especially within our criminal justice sys-
tem, is necessary to ensure the legitimacy of 
government and the preservation of our Union. 
Just because the ecosystem for data has

EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CON-

TION-STYLE 
MURDERS 
OF 
UNITED STATES CITIZENS YLLI, 
AGRON, AND MEHMET BYTYQI IN 
THE REPUBLIC OF SERBIA IN 
JULY 1999 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 21, 2022 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of H. Con. Res.E ‘‘Expressing the 
Sense Of Congress Regarding the Execution- 
Style Murders Of United States Citizens Ylli, 
Agron, And Mehmet Bytyqi In The Republic Of 
Serbia In July 1999’’. 
This resolution would demand that the indi-
viduals who so unconscionably murdered the 
Bytyqi Brothers shortly after the end of the 
Kosovo war be held accountable by the Ser-
bian government. 
This resolution reaffirms our commitment to 
American citizens, that, no matter what, they 
will receive the justice that they and their fami-
lies deserve, regardless of how long it has 
been. 
Ylli, Agron, and Mehmet were American citi-
zens traveling on a humanitarian mission to 
combat the genocide of Serbian Albanians in 
1999, who, after unknowingly crossing an un-
marked border, were extrajudicially kidnapped, 
imprisoned, tortured, murdered, and callously 
thrown into a mass grave by Serbian govern-
ment officials. 
Their bodies were not discovered until 2001. 
These officials knew the entire time that the 
Bytyqi brothers were Americans citizens, and 
undeterred, carried out crime after crime, even 
after a Serbian judge ordered the brothers’ re-
lease. 
Despite this horrific crime, despite promises 
from President Aleksandar Vucic and Foreign 
Minister Ivica Dacic, not one person has been 
held responsible in the past 23 years. 
We cannot allow this injustice to exist, and 
we cannot allow other countries to believe that 
it is in any way acceptable to treat American 
citizens in this manner. 
It is unacceptable that there has been no 
movement on this case in years. 
Ylli, Agron, and Mehmet and the remaining 
Bytyqi family deserve justice, and the Serbian 
government agrees. How then has nothing 
been done to secure this justice? 
Since the Serbian government has not 
acted, the United States must devote re-
sources to fully assist and monitor Serbia’s ef-
forts to investigate this crime against American 
citizens. 
No American should experience what the 
Bytyqi brothers and their families have experi-
enced, and we should make it clear that the 
United States will always seek justice for its 
people.

PROMOTING 
UNITED 
STATES 
INTERNATIONAL LEADERSHIP IN 
5G ACT OF 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 21, 2022 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of H.R. 1934, the ‘‘Promoting United 
States International Leadership in 5G Act of 
2021’’. 
H.R. 1934 will enhance the United States’ 
leadership in setting standards for 5G—or 5th 
generation—and future evolutions of mobile 
telecomunications systems and infrastructure. 
I would like to thank my colleague, Rep-
resentative MCCAUL, for introducing this legis-
lation and taking initiative in addressing the 
rising importance of 5G standards. 
Under H.R. 1934, the President will estab-
lish an interagency working group consisting 
of the Sectretary of State and the head of 
each Federal department deemed appropriate. 
Within 180 days, the interagency working 
group will provide a briefing to the House 
Committee on Foreign Affairs and Senate 
Committee on Foreign Relations that will in-
clude: 
A strategy to promote United States leader-
ship in international standards-setting bodies; 
A strategy for diplomatic engagement re-
garding 5G and future generations of mobile 
telecommunications systems; 
A discussion of China’s activity in inter-
national standards-setting bodies; and 
A strategy regarding private sector commu-
nications and stakeholders to propose stand-
ards for 5G. 
Standards are crucial in the future of tele-
communications by allowing for global inter-
operability. 
Global interoperability allows companies to 
market products around the globe, increase in-
novation, and benefit from fair competition. 
Past generations of wireless technology, 2G 
and 3G, saw a split between networks used in 
United States, Europe, and China, which com-
plicated the globalization of the wireless mar-
ket. 
For 5G, standards have converged into pri-
marily one standard. 
China has become a leader in setting inter-
national standards for 5G. In 2019, China sub-
mitted 830 technical documents to the Inter-
national Telecommunication Union (ITU)—the 
most of any country. 
China’s dominance in 5G standards would 
give them an advantage in creating chips and 
software for 5G-compatible phones. 
H.R. 1934 addresses this head-on by spear-
heading American leadership in both 5G 
standards setting and global cooperation. 
Houston was one of the first cities in Amer-
ica to access 5G services with major pro-
viders—AT&T, 
T-Mobile, 
and 
Verizon— 
offerring access to Houston customers, 
The Texas Comptroller’s Office released a 
report in 2020 indicating that Houston led 5G 
growth in Texas. 
The adoption of 5G has tremendous poten-
tial 
to 
create 
jobs 
and 
transform 
the 
healthcare, energy, and transportation indus-
tries. 
CTIA, a trade group for the wireless com-
munications industry, found that 5G could 
have an economic impact of $30.3 billion and 
create 93,700 jobs in Houston. 
5G represents the future and will expand 
technological limits to a new frontier. 
It is important that we continue to prioritize 
the United States’ international leadership as 
5G continues to grow. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join 
me in supporting H.R. 1934.

PREVENT 
EXPOSURE 
TO 
NAR-
COTICS AND TOXICS ACT OF 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 21, 2022 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of H.R. 5274, known as the PRE-
VENT Act of 2021. 
The Prevent Exposure to Narcotics and 
Toxics Act seeks to amend the Homeland Se-
curity Act of 2002 to provide additional training 
for U.S. Customs and Border Protection per-
sonnel. 
The training outlined in the amendment 
would instruct U.S. Customs and Border Pro-
tection on containment devices which prevent 
secondary exposure to fentanyl and other le-
thal substances. 
These containment devices reduce expo-
sure to hazardous substances and can im-
prove investigations by better preserving 
chemical substances for forensic analysis. 
Fentanyl exposure as little as two milligrams 
can lead to trouble breathing, dizziness and a 
possible lethal overdose. 
CBP (Customer and Border Protection) Offi-
cers are at an increased risk of exposure to 
fentanyl and other lethal substances through 
inhalation, ingestion, skin contact, etc. This ex-
posure risk was reported by the U.S. Depart-
ment of Homeland Security’s Office of the In-
spector General. 
The same report cited that many CBP facili-
ties were ill equipped to store fentanyl and 
other lethal substances. 
These facilities were also not equipped with 
naloxone, a substance critical in preventing 
overdose when faced with accidental expo-
sures. 
Without proper training on how to contain 
and prevent these threats, our personnel are 
at risk of endangering themselves and the 
people they seek to protect. 
It is imperative to defend our law enforce-
ment officers from dangers they face while 
protecting our communities and Nation. This 
bill would promote the safety of CBP Officers 
while promoting the effectiveness of their in-
vestigations. 
I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 
5274. 
INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS 
CYBERSECURITY TRAINING ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 21, 2022 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of H.R. 7777, the ‘‘Industrial 
Control Systems Cybersecurity Training Act.’’ 
H.R. 7777 amends the Homeland Security 
Act of 2002 to authorize the Cybersecurity and 
Infrastructure Security Agency to establish an 
industrial control systems training iniative that 
will strengthen the skills of our vital cyber-se-
curity workforce. 
Industrial control systems are the devices, 
systems, networks, and controls used to oper-
ate and automate the industrial functions that 
keep our Nation running. 
They are key components in manufacturing, 
electrical generation, wastewater treatment, 
and even oil refineries—all of which are nec-
essary for the proper functioning of our coun-
try. 
While 
the 
technological 
revolution 
has 
streamlined many industrial services, it has 
also left us vulnerable to threats targeting our 
national utilities and infrastructure. 
The ‘‘Industrial Control Systems Cybersecu-
rity Training Act’’ provides an instruction man-
ual for training those on the frontlines of our 
defense. 
First, H.R. 7777 prioritizes increasing ac-
cess to cybersecurity education courses. 
The Act would require the Director to make 
accessible to the public tuition-free virtual and 
in-person cyber security courses and trainings 
for varying skill levels. 
It would also ensure that these trainings be 
available across the country so that those 
working in even the most remote corners of 
America have the opportunity to develop their 
cybersecurity skills. 
Trainings would cover topics of cyber de-
fense strategies, the evolution of cyber 
threats, and strategies for mitigating security 
vulnerabilities in industrial control systems. 
All of these courses would be crafted in col-
laboration with the National Laboratory of the 
Department of Energy and when necessary, 
consultation with expert private sector entities. 
Those who wish to harm our country are 
learning from the best criminals; therefore, we 
must equally arm our defenders right along 
side them. 
Secondly, H.R. 7777 requires the Director to 
provide reports on the initiative to the House 
Committee on Homeland Security and the 
Senate Committee on Homeland Security and 
Governmental Affairs. 
Through these reports, Congress would not 
only be able to monitor the quality of courses 
being offered, but would receive yearly rec-
ommendations on how to improve the edu-
cation and training being offered. 
In addition to reporting on the contents of 
the classes taught, the Director would also be 
expected to provide information on the race, 
gender, and regional location of those in at-
tendance. 
Through this monitoring process, Congress 
would be assured not only of current demo-
graphic diversity, but also the plans to expand 
access to industrial control systems cyberse-
curity training to women and underrepresented 
populations.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E657 
June 22, 2022 
In today’s increasingly interconnected world, 
it is critical that the United States produces 
highly trained cyber security professionals 
equipped to maintain America’s security and 
defense. 
It is also critical that the initiatives utilized to 
provide for their education encapsulate the 
needs of our diverse and varied Nation. 
H.R. 7777 will put in place the framework 
needed to train the next generation of leaders 
in industrial control systems cybersecurity. 
That is why I rise in strong support of ‘‘In-
dustrial Control Systems Cybersecurity Train-
ing Act.’’

CONDEMNING 
THE 
OCTOBER 
25, 
2021, MILITARY COUP IN SUDAN 
AND STANDING WITH THE PEO-
PLE OF SUDAN 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 21, 2022 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of H. Con. Res. 59, a resolu-
tion ‘‘Condemning the October 25, 2021, mili-
tary coup in Sudan and standing with the peo-
ple of Sudan.’’ 
H. Con. Res. 59 is a bipartisan resolution 
condemning the military coup carried out on 
October 25, 2021 and calls for Prime Minister 
Hamdok and other constitutional leaders from 
his cabinet to be released from unlawful cus-
tody. 
This resolution urges the Sudanese govern-
ment to resume measures to transition power 
to a civilian led government that respects 
democratic principles and end all violence 
against its citizens. 
Following the ousting of President Al-Bashir 
on April 11, 2019 the Transitional Military 
Council (TMC) seized power halting the pro-
posed transition to a representative democ-
racy, 
On June 3, 2019 about 127 peaceful pro-
testers were killed at the hands of the Rapid 
Support Forces, an extension of the Sudanese 
government that continues to perpetuate vio-
lence in the region to this day. 
With support from the U.S. and members of 
the international community, Sudan was show-
ing promise in its democratic transition through 
actions such as ratifying their intention to turn 
in former President Al-Bashir to the Inter-
national Criminal Court, as well as civilian and 
military leaders agreeing to a transitional 
framework to implement a civilan-led govern-
ment. 
Unfortunately, Lt. General Burhan and his 
allies seized power following a coup of the 
transitional government in October 2021, sub-
sequently imprisoning Minister Hamdok and 
other officials. 
Protests followed the coup as the Sudanese 
people called for a transition from a military 
ruling council to true democratic governance. 
BBC News reports over 100 people have 
been killed by Sudanese security forces since 
October 2021, with tensions between the mili-
tary and civilians worsening as the region 
faces increased food shortages and inflation. 
Houston is home to thousands of African 
immigrants including many Sudanese Ameri-
cans to whom I answer to as their representa-
tive. It is critical for Congress to stand with the 
women and men advocating and speaking up 
for the Sudanese people. 
I applaud the efforts and sacrifices that pro- 
democracy activists have made. They must be 
assured that the United States fully supports 
their desire for freedom and peace, and 
strongly condemns the violent and oppressive 
tactics of Sudan’s military junta. 
When enacted, controlled H. Con. Res. 59 
will lay out areas where the Sudan’s military- 
controlled government must improve if it wants 
to continue engaging with the United States, 
including political reform and a respect for 
human rights. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join 
me in supporting H. Con. Res 59 to confront 
these atrocities we have seen in Sudan and 
uplift the democratic values we work to pro-
tect.
