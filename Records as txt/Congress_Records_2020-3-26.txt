PRAYER 
Reverend Dr. Dan C. Cummins, Cap-
itol Worship, Washington, D.C., offered 
the following prayer: 
Heavenly Father, a certain Samari-
tan, finding a stranger by the roadside 
beaten and robbed, without hesitancy, 
put him upon his donkey, carried him 
to an inn, and charged the keeper, say-
ing: ‘‘Take care of him; and whatever 
you spend extra, I will come again to-
morrow and repay you.’’ 
Lord, thank You, always, for the op-
portunities to do good; to bring healing 
and restoration to the sick, the dying, 
and the suffering. 
Let us not love in word only, but 
with unselfish actions, just like the Sa-
maritan, expecting nothing in return. 
We pray, give wisdom to our Presi-
dent, the leaders of this House and Sen-
ate, to act in unity, for a threefold cord 
is not easily broken. 
Let us give liberally, as wise and pru-
dent stewards, whereby the world will 
know we are the children of God. 
Let us bind the brokenhearted, lift 
up the fallen, and let those who fear 
put their trust in the Lord. 
I pray these things in Jesus’ name. 
Amen.

HONORING 
CHRIS 
CARTER 
AND 
HIS YEARS OF DEDICATED SERV-
ICE 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 26, 2020 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and thank Chris Carter for his service 
to North Carolina and to this institution as my 
Chief of Staff and wish him well as he em-
barks on the next stage of his career. 
Chris started as an ambitious 23-year-old 
who never met a stranger and who quickly im-
pressed me with his character, hard work, op-
timism and his 1950’s style flat top. 
Over the past eight plus years, Chris has 
worked tirelessly by my side doing whatever it 
takes to meet the needs of the people of 
North Carolina’s Eighth District. There is no 
telling how many miles we have logged to-
gether over the years from Salisbury to Fay-
etteville and everywhere in-between. Though 
I’m sure Chris has a spreadsheet somewhere 
that could tell you down to the mile. He has 
been by my side since day one and has 
played an integral part of setting up every as-
pect of my organization. Through it all, Chris 
has demonstrated profound judgment and 
steady leadership. 
There are few instances where I do not 
seek Chris’ perspective or guidance. I like to 
think, however, this is a mutual feeling given 
the role I played bringing Chris together with 
his lovely wife, Jessika. They met thanks to 
me. And through constant coaching, pep talks 
and plenty of grooming and fashion advice, I 
helped Chris become the man with whom she 
finally fell in love. Despite being an obnoxious 
Carolina basketball fan, Jessika came to see 
what everyone who meets Chris knows—he is 
a person of warmth, integrity, intelligence, 
charm, an above average sense of humor and 
incredible empathy. 
My constituents have benefited from Chris’ 
hard work and commitment. He is the first to 
lend a helping hand to anyone seeking assist-
ance and I can confidently say that because of 
Chris, North Carolina is a better place. I know 
I would not be who I am or where I am today 
without him. 
It is with immense gratitude to Chris I stand 
here with the humble awareness I will never 
be able to truly express how much he means 
to me, my staff and my family. Chris, I love 
you like a brother and we wish you and Jess 
nothing but the best as you start your next 
great adventure together back in North Caro-
lina. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in 
thanking Chris Carter for his service to this in-
stitution and to the people of North Carolina.
