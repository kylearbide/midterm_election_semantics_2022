most holy name.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E861 
August 19, 2022 
DENOUNCING POLITICAL PERSECU-
TION, ESPECIALLY THAT OF DR. 
SIMONE GOLD 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 19, 2022 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to denounce political persecution. 
As of Tuesday, August 16, 2022, 860 peo-
ple have been charged with crimes for actions 
on January 6, 2022. A large percentage of 
these people were peaceful protestors who did 
not even know they were violating the law. 
As long as defendants groveled to the 
judges by renouncing their support of Donald 
Trump and insisting that he made them do it, 
they received plea deals of little or no jail time. 
If not, you might find yourself in jail for seven 
years, as happened with Guy Reffit, whose 
son the Department of Justice encouraged to 
turn against his father. Another man, activist 
Brandon Straka, who did not even enter the 
Capitol on January 6th, was given the choice 
by the FBI to either admit to saying an incen-
diary remark he in fact did not say, or go to 
trial. 
Perhaps the person most hated by the Deep 
State was Dr. Simone Gold. Not only did she 
have a problem with massive electoral fraud, 
she also was a leader in combatting COVID– 
19 misinformation. That is a bad twofer. Any-
one who dares to speak out against a dan-
gerous, deadly, and useless vaccine or abu-
sive and illegal lockdowns that led to count-
less deaths and immeasurable suffering de-
serves maximum cancellation. 
A judge sentenced her to prison for two 
months just for trespassing. She remained 
completely peaceful throughout her brief time 
in the Capitol. And now she fears for her safe-
ty and has complained of terrible treatment by 
prison officials, as have so many January 6 
defendants—whose constitutional rights to due 
process and a speedy trial have been shred-
ded and annihilated. 
The left gets on its high horse about human 
rights abuses by the likes of Putin and deserv-
edly so. But what about our own secret police 
and rotten justice system who pick and 
choose who to prosecute based on political 
beliefs? Hillary, Hunter, Peter Strozk, Lisa 
Page, Andrew McCabe, Black Lives Matter 
and antifa rioters, and those who destroy 
pregnancy care centers are free to egregiously 
break the law however they please. But inno-
cent people like Michael Flynn, Steve Bannon, 
Roger Stone, Donald Trump, and the majority 
of January 6 defendants must go to jail. 
If all protestors who trespassed in D.C. were 
thrown in a D.C. gulag for six months or sev-
eral years, that would be one thing. Democrat 
activists have invaded the Senate floor and 
halted official business. No one went to jail. 
Democrat activists illegally stalked and har-
assed conservative Supreme Court justices, 
and no one went to jail. Indeed, the halls of 
the Capitol have been subjected to leftist sit- 
ins, demonstrations, and other misbehavior for 
decades, and no one was sentenced to 
months or years in prison. Further, just re-
cently, members of a film crew for the left- 
wing activist Stephen Colbert were caught 
vandalizing a house office and trespassing. 
They then lied to Capitol Police. All charges 
were dropped and they spent no time in a 
D.C. gulag. But conservative or Trump-sup-
porting protestors who also trespassed on fed-
eral property have faced the full force of the 
law. This bifurcated treatment is a sign of cor-
ruption. 
Our judicial system is broken. The FBI must 
be abolished. Irresponsible and corrupt DOJ 
officials must be purged, starting with Merrick 
Garland. 
The United States is in an existential crisis 
between the forces of persecution, thuggery, 
and violence—administered and enforced by 
an unholy alliance of the long arm of the State 
and left-wing terrorists—and everyday Ameri-
cans who want to live their life, raise a family, 
and worship their God. The only question is 
who will win. And time is running out.

LILLIAN CLAMENS 
HON. DON BACON 
OF NEBRASKA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 19, 2022 
Mr. BACON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to 
honor 
Staff 
Sergeant 
Lillian 
LaDae 
Clamens, who was born on May 9, 1972, in 
Omaha, NE. As a proud graduate of Omaha’s 
Central High School, Lillian enlisted in the 
United States Army, and served as an Admin-
istrative Assistant Specialist from 1990 to 
2007, eventually attaining the rank of Staff 
Sergeant. 
During this time, she served at stations in 
Korea, Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri, Ger-
many, Fort Sill in Oklahoma, and is a combat 
veteran of Operation Iraqi Freedom. While en-
listed, she took advantage of her travels 
where she encountered many different people 
and made lots of friends from diverse cultures. 
She greatly valued the different perspectives 
on life she learned from the people she met. 
Lillian was also an adored mother. She 
gave birth to her first son Ayinde in 1993 and 
later remarried to Sergeant Raymond Clamens 
and had two more children, Lana and Vitoria. 
As a devoted wife and a role model to her 
children, family was always at the center of 
her life. 
On October 10, 2007, Staff Sergeant Lillian 
Clamens was tragically killed by a mortar at-
tack on Camp Victory in Baghdad, Iraq. At the 
time, she was 35 years old and had already 
served 17 years. Sergeant Clamens was post-
humously awarded the Bronze Star Medal and 
the Purple Heart. 
From the people who knew her best, Lillian 
was known as a woman who loved everyone 
who crossed her path and she demonstrated 
that when she sacrificed her own life to save 
others during the attack before she was trag-
ically killed herself. As a soldier, she dem-
onstrated the courage to defend American 
freedom, so that democracy may continue to 
grow and prosper for future generations to 
come. 
This past spring, I was glad to see the City 
of Omaha honor our hometown hero by re-
naming a stretch of Caldwell Street as ‘‘Lillian 
Clamens (Cobbin) Street’’. The renaming of 
this North Omaha street near where she grew 
up, will ensure our community carries on her 
legacy and brings recognition to Sergeant 
Clamens’ heroic service and sacrifice for oth-
ers. We owe Lillian and her family a debt of 
gratitude that we can never repay.

CONGRATULATIONS TO LOUISIANA 
JUMPSTART COALITION 
HON. GARRET GRAVES 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 19, 2022 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to congratulate the Louisiana 
Jumpstart Coalition for being awarded the 
State Coalition of the Year for 2022 by the 
Jumpstart Coalition for Personal Financial Lit-
eracy. Financial literacy is crucial to the edu-
cation of high school students as they prepare 
for life’s next steps. Under the leadership of 
state coalition president Baine Grimes, Lou-
isiana Jumpstart Coalition has taken the lead 
in making sure high school students are 
equipped with the tools and resources to 
achieve financial independence. 
Despite a range of challenges from the 
COVID–19 pandemic to Hurricane Ida, Lou-
isiana Jumpstart Coalition remained engaged 
with Louisiana students and businesses to 
continue the financial education program. 
Even starting new initiatives with Mayor-Presi-
dent Sharon Weston Broome of East Baton 
Rouge Parish to host city-wide financial lit-
eracy education workshops. Additionally, in 
partnership with Jumpstart Financial Inclusion 
Initiative, the Louisiana Jumpstart Coalition de-
veloped a pilot program in three parishes to 
continue its mission of increasing financial lit-
eracy. 
Again, I offer my congratulations to the Lou-
isiana Jumpstart Coalition for its work on pro-
moting financial literacy and investing in our 
students’ futures.

District, who passed away on May 6th of this 
year. Mr. Bruscato was an admired reporter, a 
dedicated public servant, and beloved partner, 
father, grandfather, and friend to many. 
In 1953, Mr. Tony Bruscato was born in 
Waukegan, Illinois to Anthony and Angela 
Bruscato. A talented writer, Mr. Bruscato was 
proud to continue his education at Indiana 
University in Bloomington, Indiana, earning a 
bachelor’s degree in broadcasting. Upon com-
pleting his degree, Mr. Bruscato put his talents 
to use as he began his broadcasting career in 
Iowa, before then moving to Port Huron, 
Michigan, to sharpen his skills. As his skills in 
broadcasting sharpened, Mr. Bruscato ad-
vanced to the larger metropolitan market, tak-
ing a position as Journalist for the Plymouth 
Observer Newspaper and serving with integrity 
through 2010. In addition, his work with the 
Observer and Eccentric in Wayne County 
made Mr. Bruscato a recognizable and trusted 
voice for many. 
While Mr. Bruscato’s broadcasting education 
and work led him across the Midwest, South-
east Michigan served as home for much of his 
professional career and later life. His knack for 
communication and love for community made 
Tony the best choice to ascend to the role of 
Plymouth Downtown Development Director. 
His skills served him well as he assumed this 
position, coordinating activity for the City of 
Plymouth and liaising with the various devel-
opment 
committees. 
Undoubtedly, 
Tony 
Bruscato’s work as Director contributed to the 
vibrant culture that makes Plymouth a highly 
sought place to live. A coworker of Mr. 
Bruscato attests to his work, saying ‘‘he 
helped grow many [City of Plymouth] events 
over the last decade, helped develop a new 
downtown Master Plan, assisted our busi-
nesses during the pandemic, and much, much 
more.’’ 
Mr. Bruscato was preceded in death by his 
parents and son, Matthew Bruscato. In addi-
tion to the love of his life, Lucia Morrison, Mr. 
Tony Bruscato’s legacy continues through his 
beloved children, Andrew (Jamie) Bruscato, 
and Sarah (Craig) Bruscato-Newsom, and 
grandchildren, Charlotte Bruscato, Andelina 
Bruscato, and Luciana Bruscato. Along with 
cultivating a reputation of integrity and excel-
lence professionally, Tony Bruscato was also 
known as a lifelong Hoosiers fan, periodically 
attending basketball games, and was a regular 
attendee of shows at Fisher Theater in Detroit. 
Those who knew Mr. Bruscato say that ‘‘he 
found every way to live life to the fullest’’ and 
will be greatly missed. 
Madam Speaker, Mr. Anthony Bruscato led 
by example, demonstrating how one person 
can create significant positive impact on their 
community through service to others. The 11th 
Congressional District of Michigan and the 
greater region has benefited from the work of 
Mr. Bruscato. Although he will continue to be 
missed by so many, it is certain that his leg-
acy will continue through the many whom he 
inspired. 
CONGRATULATING 
TRACEY 
ANN 
TIPPETT FOR BEING NAMED 2022 
UPPER PENINSULA VETERAN OF 
THE YEAR 
HON. JACK BERGMAN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 19, 2022 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it’s my 
honor to recognize Tracey Ann Tippett for 
being named the 2022 Upper Peninsula Vet-
eran of the Year. Through her dedicated serv-
ice, exceptional leadership, and steadfast de-
votion to her community, Tracey has become 
an indispensable part of the Upper Peninsula 
of Michigan. 
The U.P. Veteran of the Year is chosen an-
nually by a selection committee consisting of 
past commanders of various service organiza-
tions throughout the peninsula. It is given to 
recognize Yooper Veterans who go above and 
beyond in their service to their local commu-
nities and fellow Veterans. None are more de-
serving of this honor than Tracey. During her 
military career, Tracey served as a Sergeant 
in the United States Marine Corps, where she 
was decorated with the Good Conduct Medal, 
National Defense Service Medal, Rifle Marks-
manship Badge, Letter of Appreciation, and 
Certificate of Appreciation. Her devotion to the 
people of her country and community has not 
wavered since she returned from military serv-
ice. 
It is impossible to fully list all the ways in 
which Tracey works to better the lives of U.P. 
Veterans. She is an active member and has 
served in a variety of leadership positions in 
the Marine Corps League and Military Order of 
the Devil Dogs, and she is currently the U.P. 
Zone Vice Commandant and Department Ad-
jutant and Webmaster for the State of Michi-
gan. At her own expense, she makes copies 
of the Michigan Marine News and the Woof-O- 
Gram and mails them to members who do not 
have access to the Internet. Tracey serves on 
the Board of Trustees for the Marquette Coun-
ty Veteran’s Alliance Committee and as the 
Secretary of the Marquette County Veteran’s 
Board. She regularly volunteers at the DJ 
Jacobetti Home for Veterans, and is a mem-
ber of American Legion Post 44, MODD 
Northern Wolves Pound 174, and Lake Supe-
rior Detachment 764. Within the Detachment, 
she is a member of the Color Guard, and she 
volunteers at Memorial Day services, Flag Day 
celebrations, 4th of July services and parades, 
Veteran’s Day services, and Marine Corps 
Birthday celebrations. Tracey is dedicated to 
her fellow Marines and other Veterans, and 
she graciously does whatever is asked of her 
to ensure the Detachment’s success. She has 
devoted decades to the people of Michigan, 
and her tireless efforts have directly improved 
the lives of thousands of U.P. Veterans. 
Outside of her work for Veterans, Tracy is 
an active volunteer for Toys for Tots, the Mar-
quette and Ishpeming Christmas parades, 
Negaunee Pioneer Days, and Trinity Lutheran 
Church. Her contributions to her community 
were also previously recognized when she 
was named the 2021 Marquette County Vet-
eran of the Year, the 2021 State of Michigan 
Veteran of the Year, and the 2022 Marine 
Corps League Central Division Marine of the 
Year. Additionally, she is the recipient of the 
2022 U.P. Michigan Credit Union League Dis-
tinguished Service Award thanks to the 28 
years of service she has given to the TruNorth 
Federal Credit Union. As a servicemember, a 
Veteran, a volunteer, and a Yooper, Tracey 
consistently puts the needs of others before 
her own. 
Madam Speaker, it’s my honor to congratu-
late Tracey Ann Tippett for her decades of 
service to fellow Michigan Veterans, and for 
being named the 2022 Upper Peninsula Vet-
eran of the Year. Michiganders can take great 
pride in knowing the First District is home to 
such a selfless and devoted individual. On be-
half of my constituents, I wish Tracey all the 
best in her future endeavors.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF ELLA SEWELL 
HON. MARK DeSAULNIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 19, 2022 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the life and service of Ella 
Sewell. 
Ella was born in Houston, Texas to Walter 
and Octavia Lee Taylor. She was a dedicated 
student and was named valedictorian of her 
high school. She married her husband, Lowell 
Giddings Sewell, and the couple moved to 
Richmond, California when Lowell was offered 
a job at the Kaiser Shipyards. 
Throughout her life, Ella has been heavily 
involved in activism and has shown her pas-
sion for serving her community. In the 1940s, 
Ella advocated for equal voting rights for Afri-
can Americans and helped to get many mem-
bers of the community registered to vote. Ad-
ditionally, for over 16 years Ella served on the 
Richmond-Shimada Friendship Commission. 
As a part of this program, Ella hosted ambas-
sadors from Japan and shared African Amer-
ican culture and history with them. Ella also 
took on multiple leadership roles within the 
Easter Hill UM Church and helped to introduce 
several programs to the congregation. 
In her personal life, Ella enjoyed spending 
time with her family and expressing her cre-
ativity through dancing and cooking. Ella’s 
love for cooking was passed along to her by 
her father and uncles. She also loved playing 
cards and enjoying barbecues with her family 
and friends. 
Sadly, Ella passed away on July 10, 2021. 
She is survived by her daughter, Gloria, her 
sons, Michael (Gladys) and David, four grand-
children, four great grandchildren, two god-sis-
ters, and three god-granddaughters. She was 
a cherished member of our community and 
she will be remembered for her compassion, 
intelligence, and dedication. Please join me in 
honoring Ella Sewell for her many contribu-
tions to our community.

DENOUNCING LEFT-WING

an ‘‘idea.’’ In reality, it is a left-wing terror or-
ganization dedicated to violence against ‘‘fas-
cists’’—or anyone who believes, just as the 
Founders did, that our rights come from Al-
mighty God. 
Left-wing terrorists have attacked 64 pro-life 
pregnancy centers since the Supreme Court 
leak, according to Catholic Vote, including a 
number of fire bombings. 207 churches have 
been attacked and vandalized since May of 
2020—and 70 since the Supreme Court leak. 
One terrorist group called Ruth Sent Us told a 
Catholic that she should ‘‘stuff [her] rosaries 
and [her] weaponized prayer’’ and that the 
group will ‘‘be burning the Eucharist to show 
our disgust for the abuse Catholic Churches 
have condoned for centuries.’’ 
The Bible warns of persecution constantly. 
In the Gospel of Luke, Jesus says, ‘‘But be-
fore all this, they will seize and persecute you. 
They will hand you over to synagogues and 
put you in prison, and you will be brought be-
fore kings and governors, and all on account 
of my name.’’ 
The two-tiered justice system has existed 
for a while. Democrats have always gotten 
away with things that would have ended the 
career of anyone on the right. But a new level 
has been reached nowadays. Parents must be 
prosecuted for standing up to sexual and ra-
cial 
indoctrination 
in 
public 
schools. 
A 
‘‘disinformation board’’ is needed to keep an 
eye on those who believe in massive voter 
fraud and who recognize the toxicities of the 
COVID–19 vaccine. The raid of the residence 
of a duly-elected former president for political 
reasons is just the culmination of statist 
weaponization that runs the gamut from the in-
vention of treasonous activity by President 
Trump to the persecution of peaceful election 
protestors. 
When the Deep State is not busy destroying 
political opponents, they are standing down to 
left-wing terrorists. The massive amounts of 
damage caused by Black Lives Matter and 
antifa rioters in 2020 remain unpunished. So 
do the attacks on pregnancy resource centers 
and churches. There were no arrests made on 
rioters who were illegally picketing and intimi-
dating Supreme Court justices outside their 
homes—a clear and obvious violation of fed-
eral law. 
Persecution of the God-fearing and those 
with countercultural beliefs has existed for 
centuries, all the way back to the time of 
Christ and before. These hate crimes are ab-
horrent and are to be expected. However, that 
does not mean we must not fight back. We 
will not accept this persecution without a re-
sponse. 
I have called for the abolition of the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation (FBI). I will not cease 
in my calls to defend those persecuted by the 
State for political reasons—whether they be 
January 6 defendants or quality public figures 
like Scott Perry, Roger Stone, Michael Flynn, 
or Steve Bannon. I signed onto a petition to 
impeach Merrick Garland. I believe any cor-
rupt senior officials at the Department of Jus-
tice and FBI must resign immediately or be 
fired. 
We are in the eye of the storm. Christ said 
he came to bring division, fire, and the sword. 
Conflict with the forces of darkness is inevi-
table. We must expect it. And we must use 
the political system—as corrupt, rotten, and 
putrid as it is—to combat the persecution be-
fore it is too late. 
NEBRASKA FURNITURE MART 
TIME CAPSULE 
HON. DON BACON 
OF NEBRASKA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 19, 2022 
Mr. BACON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize an Omaha landmark, a fixture in 
Omaha’s history and in the furniture retail 
world—Nebraska Furniture Mart—on the occa-
sion of their 85th anniversary. In 1937, Rose 
Blumkin started the Mart—as it is known to 
those in the community—with $500 in the 
basement of her husband’s shop. Since then, 
four generations of the Blumkin family have 
worked at the retail giant which is now also lo-
cated in Iowa, Kansas City and Texas. 
The largest retailer of home furnishings in 
North America, their flagship store hosts more 
than two million visitors a year, making it one 
of Nebraska’s top tourists’ attractions. Employ-
ing over 5000 workers, including 2000 in 
Omaha, the Mart contributed over $104 million 
in local payroll for the year 2020. In addition, 
it generates an average of $4.3 million in 
Omaha taxes and $24.4 million in state taxes. 
As we gather on this 85th anniversary, we 
look forward to celebrating 100 years and the 
growth that the Mart will continue to have in 
Omaha and across the nation. Despite its 
large growth, the Mart is connected to the 
community, where it has a large footprint. I be-
lieve Rose Blumkin would be proud to see 
what her $500 has grown into and the impact 
it has made in the lives of those who work or 
shop here and would be excited to see what 
the future has to bear. 
Congratulations to Nebraska Furniture Mart 
and the Blumkin family and I look forward to 
seeing their progress and growth 15 years 
from now.

RECOGNIZING CAPTAIN BRIAN 
FALK 
HON. DAVID G. VALADAO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 19, 2022 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today and am joined by my colleague from 
California, Mr. MCCARTHY, to honor the life 
and legacy of Captain Brian Falk. After serving 
the Kern County Fire Department for more 
than two decades, Captain Falk passed away 
on July 14, 2022, while on active duty at Sta-
tion 23. 
Born in Bakersfield, California in 1974, Cap-
tain Falk was known as a fierce athlete, gre-
garious leader, and compassionate friend. As 
a student at North High School, he excelled in 
competitive sports, collecting numerous rec-
ognitions along the way for his athletic excel-
lence. Upon graduation, Captain Falk attended 
Bakersfield College before transferring to the 
University of Nevada, Reno, where he re-
ceived his bachelor’s degree in Criminology. 
After his time in Reno, Captain Falk re-
turned home to serve as a Kern County Pro-
bation Officer before joining the Kern County 
Fire Department in 2002. Within six years at 
the Department, he attained the rank of Cap-
tain—an incredible feat symbolizing Captain 
Falk’s unwavering dedication to service. For 
over two decades, Captain Falk served along-
side his team of committed first responders, 
protecting Kern County residents day and 
night. 
Captain Falk was the embodiment of serv-
ice, honor, and dignity. His commitment to his 
family and his community is an example to us 
all. On behalf of the 21st and 23rd Congres-
sional Districts of California, it is our privilege 
to honor Captain Falk’s life. Our thoughts and 
prayers are with his wife, Jennifer, and two 
sons, Randall James and Tyler Matthew, as 
they mourn the loss of an incredible man.

PAYING 
TRIBUTE 
TO 
CONGRES-
SIONAL 
STAFFER, 
CATHERINE 
PETTY 
HON. GARRET GRAVES 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 19, 2022 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, 
I want to pay tribute and recognize a distin-
guished member of Congressional staff, Cath-
erine Petty. 
With the loss of our friend, the late Dean of 
the House Congressman Don Young, there is 
presently no member seated from the great 
state of Alaska who may rise and recognize 
members of his staff within this body—even as 
they continue to serve our nation’s largest 
Congressional district. Therefore, it is my dis-
tinct honor today to recognize Catherine Petty, 
and to thank her for her years of service. 
Catherine Petty grew up in Boston, Massa-
chusetts where she acquired an accent that 
she proudly never fully outgrew. She joined 
the United States Air Force in 1971 which sta-
tioned her in Germany twice, Iceland twice, 
North Dakota, Texas, and New Mexico. In 
1983 she left the Air Force as a Staff Ser-
geant in order to devote additional time to her 
young family. She next went to work for the 
Department of Defense, then as a civilian em-
ployee of the Air Force. Catherine Petty ar-
rived in Alaska at 5:00 p.m. on October 5, 
1990, at what was then Elmendorf Air Force 
Base. She continued in federal civilian service 
until she was urged by a friend to apply for a 
position with Alaska’s lone member of Con-
gress—the legendary Don Young—who she 
admitted at the time she knew very little about. 
However, as fate would have it, Catherine ap-
plied and got the job—starting on June 15, 
2006 in his Anchorage district office amidst a 
tumultuous election cycle. 
Catherine Petty’s talents and leadership 
qualities were quickly recognized by Con-
gressman Young. In 2007 he promoted her to 
be his Deputy State Director. On a personal 
level, Catherine became especially close with 
Rep. Young’s wife, Mrs. Lu Young, until her 
passing in August of 2009. 
Mrs. Petty continued to faithfully serve Con-
gressman Young as his Deputy State Director 
with great distinction. Her Congressional case-
work 
accomplishments 
include 
personally 
completing a remarkable tally of over 7,000 
constituent cases. It is no wonder that Alas-
kans continued to return Congressman Young 
to the House for a record 25 terms—with such 
effective public servants like Mrs. Petty on his 
team.

office of Congressman Don Young and to the

Office of Alaska At-Large epitomizes what it 
means to be an effective caseworker, capable 
public servant, and loyal staffer. She has 
mentored her fellow staff, gained the admira-
tion of colleagues across agencies, and 
earned the gratitude of countless constituents. 
Some of Mrs. Petty’s most memorable suc-
cesses include aiding constituents faced with 
urgent needs such as passports and visas, as-
sisting Alaskan families as they navigated nat-
uralization, and helping servicemembers over-
come bureaucratic hurdles in order to receive 
the benefits they have earned. 
Mrs. Petty’s lengthy career of service which 
spans 50 years, including in the Armed Serv-
ices, as a civilian federal employee, and as 
staff with the United States House of Rep-
resentatives, proves that Mrs. Petty’s values 
and work ethic are deeply held. Some of those 
values and work ethic could be witnessed by 
anyone brave enough to show up to the office 
before 7:00 a.m., or unwise enough to shirk a 
task they had promised to complete. Though 
never a slouch, Mrs. Petty has always been 
known to be a fan of a good office prank. Her 
good nature and humor will be missed by her 
colleagues, who all wish her the very best as 
she looks forward to her upcoming retirement. 
Catherine 
Petty 
served 
Congressman 
Young and the House of Representatives for 
16 years. On behalf of the institution she has 
so well served, all of the constituents in Alas-
ka she has helped in the name of the boss 
over the years, and as a former Congressman 
Don Young staffer myself, I say thank you to 
Catherine for a job well done and may God 
bless her.

REMEMBERING MS. CARLA MEIER 
HON. HALEY M. STEVENS

Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in memory of Ms. Carla Jacqueline 
Meier of Troy, Michigan, who passed away 
peacefully on Tuesday, May 3, 2022. Carla 
Meier was a devoted mother, fierce progres-
sive activist, and beloved friend and mentor to

knew her. Carla’s work passionately defending 
women’s rights and advocating for environ-
mental justice are just two examples of the 
many causes she put her efforts into to serve 
her community. Michigan’s 11th Congressional 
District lost a true champion for progressive 
causes, and the entire Nation owes thanks to 
Ms. Meier for dedicating her life toward fight-
ing for these issues. 
Carla Meier was born on January 10, 1947, 
in Cincinnati, Ohio, to loving parents, Charles 
and Margaret Meier. She spent her childhood 
in Ohio with her beloved sisters, Nancy Meier 
Kronick and Deborah Meier, before making 
Troy, Michigan her home as a young adult. 
Upon settling in Troy, Ms. Meier began her ca-
reer as an administrative assistant. Ms. Meier 
excelled at everything she committed herself 
to doing. Through her hard work and strong 
intuition, she quickly advanced professionally, 
eventually ascending to the role of advertising 
executive. While forging ahead with her suc-
cessful career, Carla also managed to raise 
two children and cultivated her reputation as a 
skilled baker and social activist. 
Activism was a key component of what 
made up Carla Meier. Growing up in a time 
when women were frequently considered less 
capable, Carla was dedicated to women’s 
rights and worked to invalidate this mis-
conception. Rather than pursuing a leisurely 
retirement, Carla opted, instead, to pour her-
self even more into her advocacy work. The 
intelligence, passion, and skills that led her to 
a successful career were also critical to her ef-
forts to create a more just society. The world 
that Carla sought included equality for the 
LGBTQ+ community, the dismantling of racist 
institutions, inclusiveness for marginalized 
peoples, economic reform to aid social wel-
fare, among many other common-sense pro-
gressive ideals. Many of these causes were 
championed by Carla through her work with 
the Michigan Democratic Party, serving the 
Justice Caucus, Michigan’s Ninth Congres-
sional District, Oakland County Democratic 
Party, and the Troy Democratic Club. In each 
of these organizations, she made herself in-
valuable as a volunteer, mentor, and leader. 
Ms. Meier’s legacy continues through her 
children, Dave Inabnitt (Cary Burtt) and Leah 
Meray (Ryan), and through her beloved grand-
children, Winona and Lyda. Although she was 
considered by some as a ‘‘rabble-rouser’’ who 
was never afraid to speak her mind and chal-
lenge the status quo, she was also known to 
be incredibly kind and gracious. Carla touched 
the lives of many with her exuberant person-
ality, acquiring many close friends throughout 
her life who miss her. Her family and friends 
fondly recall her organization skills, silliness 
with her dogs, long stories, remarkable mem-
ory, creative Halloween costumes, collection 
of flashy cocktail rings and her flawlessly 
beautiful handwriting, among many other 
things. It is clear that Carla Meier lived a life 
of purpose and passion, inspiring many to 
continue her work to make the world a better 
and fairer place. 
Madam Speaker, Ms. Carla Meier was an 
incredible servant to the community and her 
loss has been felt by so many who adored 
her. I am proud to be one of those who have 
earned Ms. Meier’s support, friendship, and 
mentorship. The memory of Carla Meier in-
spires me to work every day to ensure that the 
progress led by these remarkable women is 
protected and continued by Congress. I ask 
my colleagues to please join me in remem-
bering the life of Ms. Carla Meier and her 
many contributions toward fighting for a more 
just society.

RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE CHERRY HUT OF 
BEULAH, MICHIGAN 
HON. JACK BERGMAN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 19, 2022 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor to recognize the 100th Anniversary of 
the Cherry Hut of Beulah, Michigan. Through-
out its century of business, the Cherry Hut has 
served up delicious homegrown cherry prod-
ucts to the people of Benzie County and be-
yond, and has become an indispensable part 
of Northern Michigan. 
In 1922, James and Dorothy Kraker estab-
lished the Cherry Hut as a roadside stand 
along Crystal Lake’s north shore, where they 
sold homemade cherry pies. In 1937, the 
stand moved to its current location off US 31, 
where its success prompted its expansion into 
a restaurant. Throughout its long history, the 
Cherry Hut has been in the hands of only two 
families, the Krakers and the Cases. Despite 
additions to the menu over the years, the res-
taurant continues to use Dorothy’s original 
cherry pie recipe, whose timelessness has 
kept guests coming back for generations. 
Madam Speaker, it is my honor to recognize 
Beulah’s Cherry Hut for a century of service to 
Benzie County. It should take immense pride 
in the great impact it has had on the county 
and the indelible memory it has left on so 
many Michigan families. On behalf of Michi-
gan’s First District, I wish it all the best in its 
future endeavors.

RECOGNIZING DEER RUN DAIRY’S 
COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO 
SUSTAINABILITY 
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 19, 2022 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise to recognize Deer Run Dairy for receiving 
national recognition for their comprehensive 
approach to sustainability. 
The farm’s recognition is part of the 11th 
Annual U.S. Dairy Sustainability Awards from 
the Innovation Center for U.S. Dairy. These 
awards aim to recognize dairy farms, busi-
nesses and collaborative partnerships that 
demonstrate a strong commitment to contin-
uous improvement in the area of sustainability, 
as well as a commitment to informing others 
on the advancing approaches to dairy sustain-
ability. 
Deer Run Dairy originated in 1984, when 
the Ducat family purchased the property along 
with 70 cows. Step-by-step, they worked to 
expand the farm and eventually combined 
their operation with that of Dale Bogart, who 
shared similar goals. The Ducats and Bogart 
spent three years searching for the ideal 
space to combine their operations and grow. 
In 2007 they did just that; and in the Fall of 
2008, they started milking 750 cows at Deer 
Run Dairy. Today, they milk approximately 
1,650 cows and manage 2,500 acres, along 
with being a leading advocate for sustainability 
in the dairy community. 
Deer Run Dairy faces unique challenges re-
lated to having shallow soil and being in close 
proximity to Lake Michigan. The Dairy has met 
these challenges through implementing con-
servation farming practices that build healthy 
soils and protect waterways. One example of 
this is their firm belief in the use of cover 
crops, in which they achieved their goal to 
seed 100 percent of their cropland by the fall 
of 2021. 
Through the use of an anaerobic digester, 
they also reduce pathogens in manure by a 
thousandfold. The digester produces useful 
byproducts, such as animal bedding and nutri-
ent-rich fertilizer, and was also converted to 
produce renewable natural gas for the trans-
portation market. Additionally, they use mini-
mal antibiotics, conduct feeding trials to re-
duce methane gas production in the rumen of 
their cows, cross-ventilate their barns with

Sustainability Award and for all their efforts in 
advancing sustainable agriculture.

HONORING LARRY AND GINNY 
HELMS’ 50TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. MICHAEL CLOUD 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 19, 2022 
Mr. CLOUD. Madam Speaker, today, I rise 
to honor Pastor Larry and Ginny Helms’ 50th 
wedding anniversary, and 50 years in ministry. 
Pastor Larry and Ginny got married in Dell 
City, Oklahoma on August 19th, 1972. They 
began both their marriage and ministry at that 
time, as Pastor Larry established his first 
church in October of 1972 at the age of 20. 
They pioneered three churches: Praise 
Temple in Littlefield, Texas—Church on the 
Way in Lawton, Oklahoma—and Joy Fellow-
ship in Victoria, Texas. 
The Helms’ traveled all over the country to 
spread God’s word. Even traveling to numer-
ous countries overseas, including El Salvador 
to teach bi-annually for three years—as well 
as short term mission trips in Guatemala. 
In 1992, in an extraordinary act of unity, the 
Helms’ moved from their pastorate at Joy Fel-
lowship to join their ministry efforts with Pastor 
Jim and Tamara at Faith Family Church. 
They’ve served the past 30 years in various 
capacities at Faith Family Church and con-
tinue to inspire those around them, including 
with their self-published book entitled Trans-
formed Mind: Transformed Life. 
It is a privilege of mine to recognize a hus-
band and wife with an unbreakable bond and 
an unshakable passion for ministry. Happy 
50th Anniversary to Larry and Ginny Helms.

HONORING BUDDY ARRINGTON 
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 19, 2022 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of Buddy Arrington, a native of 
Martinsville, Virginia, who died on August 2, 
2022. He was a popular racecar driver who 
throughout his career did things his way. 
Mr. Arrington was born on July 26, 1938, in 
Franklin County, Virginia, to Love Glenwood 
Arrington and Louise Walker Arrington. He 
began his NASCAR career as an independent 
driver and owner in 1964. A mechanic at a 
Chrysler dealership at the time, he continued 
to drive Chryslers and Dodges even when 
they were less associated with racing. He 
bought used equipment from Richard Petty, 
supported his racing with other jobs, and had 
a volunteer crew to keep his number 67 on 
the track. 
In 560 Cup Series races, Mr. Arrington fin-
ished in the top five 15 times and in the top 
ten 103 times. His best finishes were third at 
Nashville Speedway on July 31, 1965, and at 
Talladega Superspeedway on May 6, 1979. At 
the latter race, driving a Chrysler bought from 
Richard Petty, he led until the pit crew left a 
gas can attached, requiring him to stop again 
and costing him first place. 
Mr. Arrington retired from racing in 1988. Al-
though his 560 Cup races without a win are 
the second most by a driver, he later said, ac-
cording to the Martinsville Bulletin: ‘‘If I was 24 
years old, and I started racing today, and I 
knew what I’d just done, I would do the same 
thing I just did, even if I knew I wasn’t going 
to win a race. I’d keep on going and keep on 
trying, and we made a bunch of fans over the 
years.’’ 
Among Mr. Arrington’s survivors are his 
wife, Patsy Ann Chitwood Arrington; son, Joey 
Rogers Arrington; stepson, Todd Arrington; 
brother, Jimmy Arrington (Marie); nephew, 
Ronnie Arrington; niece, Angela Arrington; 
step-grandson, Danny Goad; and step-grand-
daughter, Amber Arrington. I offer my condo-
lences on the loss of this proud independent 
racer.

HONORING 
CAROLYN 
SAXTON, 
PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECU-
TIVE OFFICER OF LEGACY FOUN-
DATION, UPON HER RETIREMENT 
HON. FRANK J. MRVAN 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 19, 2022 
Mr. MRVAN. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great respect and admiration that I take this 
time to honor Carolyn Saxton and to wish her 
well upon her retirement from her position as 
President and Chief Executive Officer of Leg-
acy Foundation. For her lifetime commitment 
to philanthropic efforts throughout the region, 
she is to be highly commended. Carolyn will 
be honored at a retirement celebration taking 
place at the Dean and Barbara White Commu-
nity Center in Merrillville, Indiana, on Friday, 
August 19, 2022. 
Throughout her career, Carolyn has served 
in numerous capacities in the not-for-profit 
arena and has been a certified fundraising ex-
ecutive since 1992. Among her many note-
worthy leadership roles, she served as execu-
tive director for Community Hospice in Ash-
land, Kentucky, the Oak Park—River Forest 
Community Foundation and the Lubeznik Cen-
ter for the Arts in Michigan City. 
In 2014, Ms. Saxton became President and 
Chief Executive Officer of Legacy Foundation, 
Lake 
County’s 
community 
foundation. 
Throughout her tenure, she led multiple fund-
raising initiatives and secured millions of dol-
lars for several important philanthropic projects 
and grants throughout Northwest Indiana. The 
foundation has been responsible for more than 
$30 million in grant disbursements across the 
region and manages nearly $50 million in as-
sets in Lake County. Under Carolyn’s leader-
ship, Legacy Foundation has received numer-
ous prestigious awards including the Sec-
retary’s Award by the Department of Housing 
and Urban Development and the Foundation 
of the Year Award by the Association of Fund-
raising Professionals Northwest Indiana Chap-
ter, to name a few. Those who have worked 
with Carolyn can attest to her unwavering 
commitment to the foundation’s standard of 
excellence, as well as her enthusiasm for 
community investment and improvement. 
Carolyn’s dedication to the community of 
Northwest Indiana and her career is exceeded 
only by her devotion to her beloved husband, 
Bill, her children and her grandchildren. I am 
sure she will be enjoying quality time with her 
family in the years to come. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my 
other distinguished colleagues join me in hon-
oring Carolyn Saxton for her outstanding lead-
ership and in wishing her well upon her retire-
ment. For her remarkable contributions to the 
community of Northwest Indiana and beyond, 
Carolyn is worthy of our gratitude and praise.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF MICKEY GANITCH 
HON. MARK DeSAULNIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 19, 2022 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the life and service of Mick-
ey Ganitch. 
Mickey was born in Mogadore, Ohio and 
moved to California in 1939. On January 21, 
1941, he joined the U.S. Navy and began at-
tending boot camp in San Diego, California. 
He became a quartermaster, responsible for 
navigation and steering the ship. When he 
was stationed at the USS Pennsylvania at 
Pearl Harbor, the Japanese attacked on De-
cember 7, 1941. Mickey described how during 
the attack, a 500 pound bomb missed him by 
about 45 feet. 
Later on, Mickey went to the Philippines and 
Okinawa. While in Okinawa, his ship was hit 
by a Japanese torpedo. In 1948, the ship he 
was working on was found to have unsafe lev-
els of radiation and he was assigned to the 
USS Mt. Katmai, an ammunition ship. Mickey 
retired from the Navy in October 1963. When 
Mickey returned to Oakland, he worked in a 
bowling alley and as a fishing net manufac-
turer. He went on to work security for the Ala-
meda Naval Station until 1996. 
Mickey was passionate about serving the 
veteran community. He was involved with a 
wide variety of veteran and military groups in-
cluding the Fleet Reserve Association, the 
American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, 
Disabled American Veterans, the Pearl Harbor 
Survivors Association, and was a volunteer at 
the Oakland VA clinic. 
Sadly, Mickey passed away this Spring at 
the age of 102. He was a beloved member of 
the veteran community and he will be missed. 
Please join me in honoring his service to our 
community and to our Nation.

HONORING DR. RODNEY BENNETT, 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNIVERSITY 
OF SOUTHERN MISSISSIPPI 
HON. STEVEN M. PALAZZO 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 19, 2022 
Mr. PALAZZO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Dr. Rodney Bennett for his out-
standing service as President of the University 
of Southern Mississippi. 
A native of Knoxville, Tennessee, Dr. Ben-
nett, and his wife Temple have two adult 
daughters, Colby, and Logan. He holds a Doc-
tor of Education in Educational Administration 
from Tennessee State University in Nashville 
and Specialist, Master, and bachelor’s de-
grees from Middle Tennessee State University 
in Murfreesboro. He served as Vice President 
for Student Affairs at the University of Georgia 
before being appointed as the 10th President 
of the University of Southern Mississippi 
(USM). 
President Bennett established his vision for 
The University of Southern Mississippi to be-
come the model for public higher education 
across the country, with six key institutional 
priorities; ensuring student success; expanding 
enrollment strategies; enhancing academic in-
struction; fostering a greater focus on re-
search; bolstering economic and community 
partnerships; and maximizing human potential. 
During his Presidency, USM achieved R1 
status 
for 
research. 
Concurrently, 
USM 
reached 
significant 
fundraising 
milestones 
while enhancing community partnerships. The 
university expanded operations along the Mis-
sissippi Gulf Coast supported innovations in 
healthcare and invested in new faculty posi-
tions. His achievements include student suc-
cess programming and executing nearly $300 
million in capital improvements. 
Under President Bennett’s leadership, USM 
became one of only 14 R1 institutions in the 
nation that competed at the NCAA Division I 
level and maintained accreditation in all four 
primary areas of the Arts. He worked diligently 
to position USM as a Top Ten Military Friendly 
institution that was ranked first in the south-
east and third in the nation by Military Times 
(2021) by expanding programs and services 
for military veterans and service members. 
He was inducted into Omicron Delta Kappa 
in 2019 and made history by becoming the 
first black president of a predominantly white 
Mississippi university and the first in USM’s 
presidential lineage. 
Madam Speaker, I recognize Dr. Bennett 
today for his exceptional work and dedication 
to the USM Golden Eagle Community, my 
very own alma mater, and the institution of 
higher learning. May God Bless Dr. Bennett 
and his family as they begin their next chapter 
of outstanding service. ‘‘Southern Miss to The 
Top!!!’’
