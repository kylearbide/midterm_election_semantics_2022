Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today

stock judging contest at the Western

Conner Knudson, Hunter Knudson,

District proud. 
SCOTT COUNTY, INDIANA, CELEBRATES 
BICENTENNIAL 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Scott County, Indiana, on 
their bicentennial celebration. 
In these two centuries, Scott County 
has become a cornerstone of my Sixth 
District. With a growing economy, 
beautiful parks and lakes, and a close 
community of Hoosiers, Scott County 
continues to be a great place for all of 
us to call home. 
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Scott 
County on their bicentennial, and here 
is to the next 200 years. 
RUSHVILLE ROTARY CLUB’S 100TH ANNIVERSARY 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today

for celebrating 100 years of service. 
For a century now, the Rushville Ro-
tary Club has been a pillar of commu-
nity involvement in the district. The 
Rotary Club continues to support local 
service projects around the community 
and helps students at the Rushville 
High School. 
I want to thank the members of the 
Rotary Club for their service and dedi-
cation to the people of Rushville and 
congratulate them on their 100th anni-

CONGRATULATING MARLIN KOHLMEIER 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate Marlin Kohlmeier, who 
was named the 2019 Volunteer of the 
Year by the Indiana Department of

and the Indiana Hunter Education As-
sociation. 
Mr. Kohlmeier has been a teacher at 
South Ripley schools for over 40 years 
and volunteers his time to teach hun-
ter safety to all the students at South 
Ripley. 
According to his colleagues, Mr. 
Kohlmeier has a heart of gold, and

thank Mr. Kohlmeier for his work edu-
cating kids, and extend my congratula-
tions for receiving this award. 
RECOGNIZING RAILROAD DAY 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Railroad Day on Capitol 
Hill. 
Today, we have 450 industry profes-
sionals from railroads, rail labor, rail 
contractors, and rail supply companies 
on Capitol Hill fighting for the issues 
that affect us all. 
In my home State of Indiana, we 
have over 1,200 miles of Class III rail 
tracks and over 3,800 miles of Class I 
railroad tracks. As a crossroads of 
America, our rail industry is one of the 
busiest in the Nation and contributes 
to our thriving economy and business 
development. 
I am proud to support policies that 
increase the safety and efficiency of in-
frastructure in Indiana and the rest of 
our great Nation. 
We must support our country’s rail-
roads so that we can keep America’s 
economy rolling. 
CONGRATULATING SAM BENNETT 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate Sam Bennett of Delta 
High School for winning the 1–Meter 
Diving State Title at the 2020 Indiana 
Swimming and Diving State Meet. 
Sam put in the hard work and dedica-
tion into his sport to rise from fourth 
place last year to the number one spot 
this year. 
I wish Sam the best of luck next year 
as reigning champ for his senior sea-
son. I look forward to seeing him con-
tinue to make Indiana’s Sixth District 
proud.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1474 
March 4, 2020 
LIARS CANNOT BE TOLERATED 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. FOSTER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I am a 
scientist, and if a scientist stands up 
and says something that they know is 
not true, it is a career-ending action. 
The reason for this is that science al-
ways operates at the edge of what is 
known, so we cannot tolerate liars. 
The world is now facing scientific un-
certainty in the spread and the sever-
ity of the coronavirus. And when the 
leadership of China confronted the re-
ality of the pandemic, they chose to 
suppress scientific truth and lie to 
their people. That cost China and the 
world the opportunity to slow down 
and perhaps contain this outbreak. 
In the U.S., we were recently exposed 
to the spectacle of our country’s leader 
making self-serving pronouncements 
about the coronavirus outbreak that 
had no basis in scientific fact and that 
were immediately contradicted by his 
scientific experts. 
As our Nation faces the serious 
threat of coronavirus, the American 
people deserve to know that they can 
trust the information coming from 
their government, and that the public 
officials that they elected are putting 
science ahead of politics or deranged 
conspiracy theories. 
Unfortunately, after 3 years of con-
sistently undermining scientific re-
search and scientific fact, this adminis-
tration is dangerously deficient in 
credibility, and that is directly putting 
the health and well-being of millions of 
Americans at risk with an opaque and 
chaotic response to this outbreak. 
Just a few weeks ago, the Trump ad-
ministration presented a budget that 
would slash almost $700 million from 
the Centers for Disease Control, cut-
ting a vital resource that is at the 
front lines of this public health emer-
gency. 
This administration has left critical 
positions vacant at Homeland Security 
and the National Security Council, in-
cluding positions responsible for man-
aging pandemics. 
Americans need their elected leaders 
to spend less time tweeting and more 
time making sure that government re-
sources are coordinated and fully fund-
ed and ready to combat this outbreak. 
Soon, the House will move forward to 
provide 
emergency 
funding 
that 
matches the scale and the threat of the 
coronavirus. We must make sure that 
the President and the administration 
uses these funds for what they are in-
tended, a comprehensive and aggressive 
response to managing the coronavirus 
outbreak and making sure that any fu-
ture vaccines or treatments are afford-
able and available to all who need 
them. 
We also must hold the President and 
his administration accountable for the 
information they share with the Amer-
ican people. Three years of keeping 
science and facts at arm’s length have 
rightly made people suspicious of what 
comes out of the White House. And 
now, as Americans worry for the health 
of themselves and their loved ones, 
they unfortunately must also worry 
about whether the information coming 
from the people that they expect to 
manage this crisis will be distorted for 
the President’s political purposes. 
When a leader lies to the public 
about important scientific facts, it is 
not acceptable. It is not cute. It is not 
just Trump being Trump. It is a dan-
gerous act that puts our public health 
and our democracy at risk. 
f 
RECOGNIZING JACKSONVILLE 
NATIONAL CEMETERY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. RUTHERFORD) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the many na-
tional cemeteries in Florida, especially 
the Jacksonville National Cemetery, 
which is in my district. 
These hallowed grounds are sacred to 
the families of those who have served 
our country honorably, many of whom 
paid the ultimate sacrifice for our free-
dom. 
Recently, the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs ranked the top national 
cemeteries in the country, and I am 
proud to report that the Jacksonville 
National Cemetery of the Southeast 
District has earned the highest award, 
which was accepted by Al Richburg, 
the director of the Jacksonville Na-
tional Cemetery. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Al and his won-
derful team for all the work they do to 
preserve the final resting places of our 
Nation’s military and creating a beau-
tiful, peaceful, and memorable place 
for loved ones to visit. 
CONGRATULATING WEST NASSAU HIGH SCHOOL 
CHEERLEADING TEAM 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to congratulate the West 
Nassau 
High 
School 
Cheerleading 
Team, who recently won the State, Na-
tional, and World Championships in Or-
lando. 
With nine State titles, the Warriors 
are tied for the second most champion-
ships in the State of Florida. In fact, 
this is the second year in a row that 
they have claimed the State, National, 
and World titles, and they are the first 
high school in Florida to do so. 
The team is spearheaded by Coach 
Samantha Beazley, who has led West 
Nassau to now five State champion-
ships, three National championships, 
and two World championships. 
On behalf of Florida’s Fourth Con-
gressional District, I want to congratu-
late the West Nassau Warriors on a 
cheerleading dynasty.

ant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair

PRAYER 
Pastor Ethan Magness, First Chris-
tian Church, Johnson City, Tennessee, 
offered the following prayer: 
Gracious God, we come to You in 
need of Your sovereign love, for Your 
power exceeds all human power, Your 
authority exceeds all human authority, 
and Your government will stand when 
all human governments have passed 
into history. 
We come to You in confession of our 
weakness and sin, for we have sought 
too often our own power. We have 
fought too selfishly for our own glory. 
We have clung too tightly to our de-
sires and our factions and our plans. 
We come to You seeking the strength 
to repent. Turn us to Your wisdom in-
stead of our own. Turn us to honesty 
instead of falsehood. Turn us to humil-
ity and service instead of pride and 
self-seeking. 
We come to You for a blessing. Like 
Jacob, we cling to You and will not let 
go until You have blessed us, for You 
are good and gracious and loving, and 
in You, we put our trust. 
Amen.

The SPEAKER. The Chair has exam-
ined the Journal of the last day’s pro-
ceedings and announces to the House

Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Jour-
nal stands approved.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman 
from Tennessee (Mr. DAVID
P. ROE) 
come forward and lead the House in the 
Pledge of Allegiance. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee led 
the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

WELCOMING PASTOR ETHAN

There was no objection. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to recog-
nize Ethan Magness, who delivered to-
day’s opening prayer.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1475 
March 4, 2020 
Johnson City, Tennessee, where my 
wife, Clarinda, has attended for many 
years. 
We are pleased to welcome Pastor 
Magness here today. 
Ethan 
is 
originally 
from 
Elizabethton, 
Tennessee, 
and 
grad-
uated from Swarthmore College. He re-
ceived his master of divinity from Em-
manuel Christian Seminary and served 
for 10 years at the Mountain Christian 
Church in Joppa, Maryland. 
Ethan founded and still directs the 
Semester in Ministry program at Mil-
ligan College. He has served as an ad-
junct professor there for 10 years. 
I am proud to welcome Ethan; his 
wife, Betsy; and his son, Evan, to our 
Nation’s Capitol today. I am also 
pleased he could share the Word of God 
with us today.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
The SPEAKER. The Chair will enter-
tain up to 15 further requests for 1-

FLIGHT 3407 FAMILIES’ ADVOCACY 
IMPROVING AIRLINE SAFETY 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam 
Speaker, for 11 years now, the families 
of Continental Flight 3407 have come to 
Capitol Hill with the heart-driven goal 
of improving airline safety. 
Thanks to their efforts, and with bi-
partisan support from Congress, the 
Federal Aviation Administration reau-
thorization bill of 2010 included meas-
ures to improve transparency and safe-
ty for the flying public. 
At long last, the Pilot Records Data-
base, one of the final elements to be 
implemented, is moving forward. 
The captain of Flight 3407 had only 
600 hours of flight experience and failed 
three practical tests known as check 
rides. Still, Continental and its re-
gional carrier, Colgan Air, hired him. 
The National Transportation Safety 
Board found that pilot error had caused 
the crash. 
Led by the courageous family and 
friends of the victims of Flight 3407 and 
their tragic yet awe-inspiring public 
advocacy to protect the flying public, 
this success, in a deeply personal way, 
belongs to them and those they loved 
and lost. 
f 
MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT 
A message in writing from the Presi-
dent of the United States was commu-
nicated to the House by Miss Kaitlyn 
Roberts, one of his secretaries. 
f 
AIPAC IS EFFECTIVE 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, this week, we wel-
comed the American Israel Public Af-
fairs Committee to Washington for the 
annual AIPAC Policy Conference. 
This conference, with over 18,000 at-
tending, is the largest gathering of 
America’s 
pro-Israel 
community. 
AIPAC President Betsy Berns Korn is a 
very effective leader. 
Monday, I had the opportunity to 
have attended the AIPAC Leadership 
Reception 
hosted 
by 
Howard 
and 
Elayne Levkowitz with ADAM SCHIFF. 
Yesterday, I met with AIPAC mem-
bers, led by David Kulbersh and his 
wife, Jane, of Columbia. They contin-
ued the tradition of the late David 
Baker of Columbia advising my prede-
cessor, Chairman Floyd Spence. 
Americans appreciate Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu, a world states-
man, for his cooperation with Jared 
Kushner for peace. I will always cher-
ish leading the congressional delega-
tion for the opening of the U.S. Em-
bassy in Jerusalem with Ambassador 
David Friedman as President Donald 
Trump 
fulfilled 
‘‘Promises 
Made, 
Promises Kept.’’ 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
and we will never forget September 
11th in the global war on terrorism. 
Our prayers for Jeannie Burkett. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS NOT A HOAX 
(Mr. TED LIEU of California asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. TED LIEU of California. Madam 
Speaker, the coronavirus is not a hoax. 
There are over 90,000 cases worldwide 
and over 3,000 deaths. 
In the U.S., based on various report-
ing, we think there are over 100 cases, 
with at least nine deaths. 
Criticism of the Trump administra-
tion’s botched response to this out-
break is not a hoax. They had faulty 
initial tests. They then compounded 
that problem by having overly restric-
tive test criteria that artificially de-
flated 
the 
number 
of 
actual 
coronavirus cases. And we don’t have 
enough test kits, as of today. 
In L.A. County, where I am from, 
they recently declared a state of emer-
gency. L.A. County has a total of one 
coronavirus test kit. 
I am pleased that this week the 
House of Representatives will pass a 
supplemental funding package to make 
sure we have enough test kits for all 
the jurisdictions that need it. 
We need this administration to stop 
misleading the American people and 
start leading. Lives are at stake. 
f 
CONGRATULATING COACH PAT 
O’KEEFE 
(Mr. WALBERG asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize Coach Pat 
O’Keefe of Grand Ledge, who is retiring 
after 51 seasons leading the high 
school’s baseball program. 
Coach O’Keefe led the Comets to a 
pair of State championships and an in-
credible 1,315 wins, making him the 
winningest baseball coach in Michigan 
history. 
Adding 
to 
his 
accolades, 
Coach 
O’Keefe is a member of the Michigan 
High School Baseball Coaches Associa-
tion Hall of Fame, the Greater Lansing 
Sports Hall of Fame, and the Michigan 
Baseball Hall of Fame. 
He shares the successes of his career 
and gives credit to his wife of 48 years, 
Melody. 
Coach O’Keefe is an exemplary com-
munity leader who will leave a lasting 
legacy beyond baseball. He modeled the 
value of hard work and sportsmanship, 
and he taught valuable life lessons to 
the young men on his teams. 
Once again, I wish to congratulate 
Coach O’Keefe on a remarkable career, 
and I thank him for making such a 
positive impact on five decades of stu-
dents in Grand Ledge. 
f 
COMMEMORATING 
NATIONAL 
COLORECTAL 
CANCER 
AWARE-
NESS MONTH 
(Mr. PAYNE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to commemorate March as Na-
tional Colorectal Cancer Awareness 
Month. 
Colorectal cancer is the second lead-
ing cause of cancer deaths for men and 
women in this country. 
This year, almost 148,000 Americans 
will be diagnosed with this dreaded dis-
ease, and 53,000 will die from it. Yet, if 
we catch it early, 90 percent of patients 
could survive within 5 years. 
The key is awareness and education. 
If we can educate more Americans 
about colorectal cancer, we can limit 
the number of deaths from it. We can 
remove the fears and stigmas that pre-
vent people from getting screenings. 
I lost my father 8 years ago this 
weekend, Congressman Donald Payne, 
Sr., to colorectal cancer. But if more 
people get screened, we have a chance 
to keep more families from losing their 
fathers, brothers, and sons to this dis-
ease.

SUPPORT TRANSPORTATION 
WORKFORCE TRAINING 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-

Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 6032, the Transportation Work-
force Centers of Excellence Act.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1476 
March 4, 2020 
Caucus, we are constantly looking for 
new ways to support a skilled work-
force. 
A skilled workforce is critically nec-
essary to support a 21st century econ-
omy, and the individuals who pursue a 
skills-based career, as well as the insti-
tutions that train them, deserve to be 
rewarded for their commitment to 
closing our Nation’s skills gap. 
The Transportation Workforce Cen-
ters of Excellence Act would establish 
a competitive $50 million grant pro-
gram to strengthen education and 
training programs in critical indus-
tries. 
A highly skilled workforce is nec-
essary to revitalize our national trans-
portation system. The demand for 
qualified workers is greater than ever. 
This bill will help us meet infrastruc-
ture demands, close our Nation’s skills 
gap, and reward schools that have gone 
above and beyond by establishing cen-
ters of excellence. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to en-
courage my colleagues to join our ef-
forts in supporting career and tech-
nical education centers of excellence 
and increased transportation workforce 
training.

PREDATORY DEBT COLLECTION 
(Ms. DEAN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, our service-
men and -women deserve more than a 
thank-you. They deserve our support 
and our protection. 
This week, with unanimous support, 
we passed H.R. 5003, the Fair Debt Col-
lection Practices for Servicemembers 
Act, to stand up for our troops against 
abusive debt collection practices. 
Many debt collectors have used ma-
nipulative practices against our sol-
diers, such as threatening to contact a 
soldier’s superior officer, threatening 
to reduce rank, and threatening to re-
voke a security clearance. If these 
practices 
aren’t 
shameful 
enough, 
many debt collectors have resorted to 
contacting the soldier’s family. 
Soldiers are already under enough 
stress keeping us safe. The House pas-
sage of H.R. 5003 sends a clear message 
that we will protect those who protect 
us, and predator debt collection prac-
tices are never acceptable. 
I urge the Senate to consider our 
servicemembers and support H.R. 5003. 
f 
CONGRATULATING PLEASANT 
PLAINS CARDINALS 
(Mr. LAHOOD asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Sangamon Coun-
ty’s Pleasant Plains High School girls 
basketball team, who brought home 
the school’s first State championship 
last weekend. 
Last Saturday, at Redbird Arena in 
Normal, the Pleasant Plains Cardinals 
defeated the two-time defending cham-
pion Chicago Marshall Commandos in a 
performance dominated by Pleasant 
Plains’ defensive efforts. 
The Cardinals held Marshall to 32 
percent shooting and forced 12 turn-
overs in the game, winning by a final 
score of 43–37. The Commandos, who 
have won 11 previous State titles, led 
for only a minute the entire game. 
The Pleasant Plains victory was not 
without drama, however, as the Car-
dinals allowed a 13-point, fourth-quar-
ter lead to dwindle to just 1; but, on 
the strength of strong senior leader-
ship, the Cardinals were able to seal 
the game and bring a State champion-
ship home to Pleasant Plains. 
The Pleasant Plains girls team made 
all of Illinois very proud with their ac-
complishments this season, finishing 
with a 28–3 record. Each girl’s commit-
ment to the champion team and their 
community is truly inspiring. 
Congratulations to Coach T.J. Fraase 
and the Pleasant Plains Cardinals. 
f 
PERSONAL WELL TESTING 
(Mr. DELGADO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. DELGADO. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today because our communities 
need peace of mind when drinking 
water from their personal wells. This is 
felt acutely in rural communities, 
where a lack of water infrastructure 
leads people to use wells as their main 
water supply. 
That is why I joined colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to introduce 
H.R. 6053, which will give folks an easy- 
to-use tool through the EPA which 
would enable them to test their own 
well water. This tool will empower our 
communities and assure them that 
they are drinking water that is clean of 
toxic chemicals. 
I will keep championing work at the 
Federal level to hold the EPA account-
able to set a safe drinking water stand-
ard, make sure PFAS is regulated 
under the Clean Water Act, and more. 
At the same time, we can make sure 
our communities have the tools they 
need to feel safe when using well water. 
f 
CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF 
EVERETT ‘‘CRUSTY’’ TOLER 
(Mr. ABRAHAM asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to celebrate the life of Mr. 
Everett ‘‘Crusty’’ Toler, who passed 
away last week in his hometown of 
Jena, Louisiana. 
Crusty was a tugboat captain who 
lost the use of his legs early in life, but 
it did not do anything to cast a shadow 
on his warm personality or his out-
going demeanor. He was just a phe-
nomenal gentleman. A friend to all 
who knew him, Crusty was a member 
of the ‘‘Ole Boys’’ club and Pritchard 
Baptist Church in Jena. 
Crusty is survived by his wife, Paula, 
of 46 years; three brothers; and several 
nieces, nephews, and godchildren. 
Please join me in bidding Crusty 
Toler a warm farewell.

SHORTAGE OF MEDICAL DEVICES 
(Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker, 
we are all concerned about the growing 
spread of coronavirus, and these con-
cerns are not relieved by troubling sto-
ries of shortages of critically needed 
medical devices, including respirator 
masks. 
Concerningly, as our healthcare sys-
tem responds, it is exposing serious 
weaknesses in the supply chain for 
medical devices. These are products 
providers depend on to deliver life-
saving care. 
That is why, today, with my col-
leagues JAN SCHAKOWSKY from Illinois 
and JODY HICE from Georgia, I am in-
troducing important, bipartisan legis-
lation to help the FDA combat the 
threat. 
My bill would allow the FDA to act 
expeditiously to address shortages, in-
cluding by importing medical devices 
as needed. It would ensure that the 
manufacturers 
are 
communicating 
with the FDA about expected shortages 
of medical devices and that this infor-
mation is shared transparently with 
the public. 
The FDA already has these authori-
ties to act during drug shortages, and 
we should grant them the same ability 
to respond to shortages of medical de-
vices. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to join us in supporting this 
commonsense bill.

RECOGNIZING HANK WOLGAMOTT 
(Mr. OLSON asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. OLSON. Madam Speaker, last 
Thursday night, as the House was re-
cessed, I stood at this podium with a 
future President of the United States 
of 
America. 
His 
name 
is 
Hank 
Wolgamott. He is on the right in this 
picture. 
Hank is one of my bosses in Texas 22. 
When he was 9 years old, his left arm 
was in a cast. The doctors said he had 
fractured his elbow. They were wrong. 
Blood was going into his elbow joint. 
He had severe hemophilia. 
With the love of his mom, Amanda; 
his dad, Jesse; and his brother, Jack, 
Hank went to war against his condi-
tion, even though he was too young to 
know what was happening inside his 
body.

March 4, 2020 
At 16 months old, he had a port 
placed in his left chest as part of his 
immune tolerance induction therapy. 
That was there for over 6 years. A fever 
or a fall meant a trip to the hospital to 
stop the bleeding. But Hank soldiered 
on. 
My dad always told me: There are no 
guarantees in life. I have been alive 
now for 57 years and 3 months, and my 
dad has never been wrong—until I met 
Hank. There is a new guarantee in my 
life: 
Never 
bet 
against 
Hank 
Wolgamott. Hank always wins. 
Vote for Hank in 2048. You will be 
glad you did.

RECOGNIZING SERGEANT JUAN 
ZAMORA 
(Mr. RUIZ asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Riverside County 
Sheriff’s Department Sergeant Juan 
Zamora and celebrate his decades-long 
career. Sergeant Zamora is a devoted 
public servant, a great father, a caring 
husband, and my good friend. 
We both grew up in the Coachella 
Valley; 
we 
both 
graduated 
from 
Coachella Valley High School; and we 
are both the proud sons of farm-
workers. In fact, it is in the fields 
where Sergeant Zamora gained an ap-
preciation for honest, hard work, and it 
is that very same appreciation that 
fueled his desire to serve his commu-
nity and drove him to become the first 
in his family to go to college. 
In 1997, he joined the Riverside Coun-
ty Sheriff’s Department, rising through 
the ranks and serving as public infor-
mation officer before his appointment 
to sheriff’s sergeant in 2010. As the re-
cipient of the Lifesaving Award and the 
Unit Citation Award, he has received 
recognition for all that he has done to 
protect and inspire our community. 
I thank Sergeant Zamora for his 
years of service. I wish him a long and 
happy retirement filled with many 
more fond memories and plenty of that 
barbecue shrimp he loves. 
I am proud of him; our community is 
proud of him; and I know that Carmen, 
Matthew, and Nicholas are proud of 
him, too.

PROVIDING SUPPORT TO FAMILIES 
OF 
INDIVIDUALS 
SUFFERING 
FROM 
SUBSTANCE 
USE 
DIS-
ORDER 
(Mr. MEUSER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of an important bill I 
recently introduced with my friend and 
colleague, DAVID
TRONE
from Mary-
land. 
H.R. 5572, the Family Support Serv-
ices Act, would improve access to non-
profit community organizations that 
provide vital support for families of in-
dividuals struggling with substance use 
disorder. 
Despite the Trump administration’s 
strong support of significant funding 
increases through H.R. 6 and other 
means, last year, my district experi-
enced over 130 overdose deaths in Berks 
County alone, 102 in Schuylkill Coun-
ty. The numbers are tragically high 
throughout my district. 
Families play an essential role in 
helping their loved ones recover from 
addiction, but the recovery process can 
be intimidating, stressful, and con-
fusing. Organizations across the Nation 
struggle to offer family support serv-
ices, such as finding treatment options, 
navigating 
insurance 
coverage 
and 
funding assistance, joining local sup-
port groups, and training and edu-
cating parents. 
Currently, 
organizations 
offering 
these services receive no government 
funding. H.R. 5572 would create a grant 
program to improve access to these 
vital services and save lives. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to cosponsor H.R. 5572, and em-
power families to do all they can to 
help their loved ones recover. 
f 
PREPARATION AND PREVENTION 
OF CORONAVIRUS 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
just returning from my district, I am 
well aware of the sense of concern of 
our 
constituents 
regarding 
the 
coronavirus, having been the first 
Member to present this to her commu-
nity after unclassified briefings left me 
with many more answers. 
I believe it is imperative that we not 
panic, but prepare. 
In San Antonio, this headline reads: 
‘‘San Antonio declares emergency after 
CDC released a woman infected with 
the coronavirus: ‘Totally unaccept-
able.’ ’’ 
‘‘Coronavirus: You may need to take 
a 2-week break from your life,’’ CDC 
says. 
I am intending to introduce legisla-
tion that deals with hourly wage mak-
ers in order to protect them if such 
happens. 
But I think it is important, as well, 
to determine what equipment we have 
in the United States, to explain to the 
American people that there are now 
two strains—one more deadly than the 
other—and to be as forthright as you 
possibly can. 
Information provides opportunity to 
prepare, and it embraces all of the 
community. 
Finally, it is important that local 
health departments have test kits and 
that we explain to the Nation that a 
vaccine is not easily done. It has to be 
researched, tested, and vetted, and 
there will be a period of time. 
So our actions should be preparation 
and prevention, not panic; but the re-
ality is that we are dealing with some-
thing enormously serious, and I intend 
to continue to do that on behalf of my 
constituents.

Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers be given 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there

There was no objection. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
On Monday, the Rules Committee 
met and reported a rule, House Resolu-
tion 877, providing for consideration of 
H.R. 1140, the Rights for Transpor-
tation Security Officers Act of 2020, 
under a structured rule. The rule pro-
vides 1 hour of general debate equally 
divided and controlled by the chair and 
ranking minority member of the Com-
mittee on Homeland Security and 
makes in order nine amendments. 
Lastly, the rule provides suspension 
authority for Thursday and same-day 
authority for Wednesday and Thurs-
day, both limited to the consideration 
of a supplemental appropriations bill. 
Madam Speaker, when the Transpor-
tation Security Administration was es-
tablished as a response to the Sep-
tember 11 terrorist attacks in 2001, its 
Administrator was given broad author-
ity over its workforce with respect to 
setting up pay and workplace condi-
tions. As such, Transportation Secu-
rity officers, TSOs, have been unable to 
benefit from Fair Labor Standards Act 
protections or fall under the general 
schedule pay scale. This distinction 
puts TSOs in a different class from 
other federal workers, preventing them 
from 
having 
the 
representational 
rights afforded through the Civil Serv-
ice Reform Act of 1978. 
Each day, TSOs screen more than 2 
million passengers at over 440 airports 
nationwide. These workers are critical 
to helping Americans travel safely and 
make up more than 70 percent of the 
Transportation Security Administra-
tion’s workforce. However, TSOs are 
among the lowest paid Federal workers 
and routinely have among the lowest 
retention rate of any Federal agency. 
TSO annual pay lags well behind indus-
try counterparts, and even the top per-
forming TSOs with exceptional per-
formance find it difficult to advance 
within their pay bands. 
This was not Congress’ intention 
when it gave the Administrator broad 
latitude to manage its own personnel 
system, nor was it Congress’ intention 
that this authority should be used to 
benefit 
management 
over 
frontline 
TSOs, as is the case today. 
As a result, in the past decade TSA 
has come to rank near the bottom in 
Federal employee morale surveys. This 
has created a culture in which last 
year the Department of Homeland Se-
curity Office of Inspector General said 
that TSA must address its retention, 
hiring, and training challenges. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD excerpts from that 2019 report 
entitled ‘‘TSA Needs to Improve Ef-
forts to Retain, Hire, and Train Its 
Transportation Security Officers.’’ 
TSA NEEDS TO IMPROVE EFFORTS TO RETAIN, 
HIRE, AND TRAIN ITS TRANSPORTATION SE-
CURITY OFFICERS 
WHAT WE FOUND 
The Transportation Security Administra-
tion (TSA) needs to continue to improve its 
retention, hiring, and training of Transpor-
tation Security Officers (TSO). Specifically, 
TSA needs to better address its retention 
challenges because it currently does not 
share and leverage results of TSO exit sur-
veys and does not always convey job expecta-
tions to new-hires. Prior to August 2018, TSA 
did not always focus on TSO career growth. 
Thus, the agency may be missing opportuni-
ties to prevent early attrition. By improving 
its retention efforts, TSA could save funds 
otherwise spent to hire and train new TSOs. 
Furthermore, TSA does not fully evaluate 
applicants for capability as well as compat-
ibility when hiring new TSOs. Thus, the 
agency may be making uninformed hiring 
decisions due to inadequate applicant infor-
mation and a lack of formally documented 
guidance on ranking potential new-hires. 
Without complete information, TSA may not 
be selecting the most highly qualified indi-
viduals as TSOs. 
Prior to July 2018, TSA had not standard-
ized the approach for training new TSOs be-
fore they attend basic training and did not 
consistently send TSOs to basic training im-
mediately following onboarding. TSA also 
does not give all airports complete visibility 
into its basic training curriculum as a basis 
for training new-hires locally. Without an 
experienced workforce or a consistent, ro-
bust training program, TSA is missing op-
portunities to strengthen its workforce. 
Given the importance of TSOs fulfilling the 
aviation security mission, TSA must address 
its retention, hiring, and training chal-
lenges, which could save millions in tax-
payers’ dollars. 
TSA RESPONSE 
TSA concurred with all nine recommenda-
tions and initiated corrective actions to ad-
dress the findings. 
Memorandum for: The Honorable David 
Pekoske, Administrator, Transportation 
Security Administration. 
From: John V. Kelly, Acting Inspector Gen-
eral. 
Subject: TSA Needs to Improve Efforts to 
Retain, Hire, and Train Its Transpor-
tation Security Officers. 
Attached for your action is our final re-
port, TSA Needs to Improve Efforts to Re-
tain, Hire, and Train Its Transportation Se-
curity Officers. We incorporated the formal 
comments provided by your office. 
The report contains nine recommendations 
aimed at improving TSA’s retention, hiring, 
and training efforts for its Transportation 
Security Officers. Your office concurred with 
all nine recommendations. Based on infor-
mation provided in your response to the 
draft report, recommendations 4, 6, and 8 are 
closed while recommendations 1, 2, 5, 7, and 
9 are resolved and open. Once your office has 
fully implemented the recommendations, 
please submit a formal closeout letter to us 
within 30 days so that we may close the rec-
ommendations. The memorandum should be 
accompanied by evidence of completion of 
agreed upon corrective actions and of the 
disposition of any monetary amounts. Rec-
ommendation 3 remains unresolved and open 
because we did not agree with TSA’s pro-
posed corrective action plan. As prescribed 
by the Department of Homeland Security Di-
rective 077–01, Follow-Up and Resolutions for 
the Office of Inspector General Report Rec-
ommendations, within 90 days of the date of 
this memorandum, please provide our office 
with a written response that includes your 
(1) agreement or disagreement, (2) corrective 
action plan, and (3) target completion date. 
Also, please include responsible parties and 
any other supporting documentation nec-
essary to inform us about the current status 
of the recommendations. Until your response 
is received and evaluated, recommendation 
#3 will be considered open and unresolved. 
Consistent with our responsibility under 
the Inspector General Act, we will provide 
copies of our report to congressional com-
mittees with oversight and appropriation re-
sponsibility over the Department of Home-
land Security. We will post the report on our 
website for public dissemination. 
CONCLUSION 
TSOs are critical to airline passenger safe-
ty and the security of the aviation transpor-
tation system. The Aviation and Transpor-
tation Security Act charges TSA with devel-
oping standards for retaining, hiring, and 
training security screening personnel at all

U.S. airports. Passengers rely on TSOs to 
screen other passengers and baggage prop-
erly at more than 400 airports nationwide. In 
FY 2017, TSA hired more than 9,600 TSOs and 
spent approximately $75 million to recruit, 
hire, and train them. Improving retention, 
hiring, and training of TSOs would save 
costs and provide a more stable, mature, and 
qualified workforce to better secure the Na-
tion’s aviation transportation system. 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
Recommendation 1: We recommend the As-
sistant Administrator, Human Capital, con-
tinue to coordinate efforts with Security Op-
erations to implement actions that facilitate 
improvements in the hiring process to ensure 
applicants are informed of the Transpor-
tation Security Officer duties and that TSA 
continues to hire qualified applicants. At a 
minimum, TSA should: 
a. require an applicant affirm whether he/ 
she has reviewed the Transportation Secu-
rity Officer Realistic Job Preview video and 
understands duties include interacting with 
passengers, passenger patdowns, shift work, 
weekend work, and holidays. If the applicant 
has not, ensure the applicant reviews the 
video as part of the application process; and 
b. finalize the implementation of the agen-
cy’s job compatibility assessment tool for 
use during the hiring process. 
Recommendation 2: We recommend the As-
sistant Administrator, Human Capital, re-
vise the exit survey process to: 
a. ensure airports offer local exit inter-
views; 
b. record results in a centralized system; 
c. provide relevant stakeholders access to 
the results for analysis and process improve-
ments; and 
d. address areas identified in the exit sur-
vey results that would help retain a skilled 
and knowledgeable Transportation Security 
Officer workforce. 
Recommendation 3: We recommend the As-
sistant Administrator, Human Capital, con-
tinue to review and develop recruitment and 
retention strategies for reducing attrition: 
a. at smaller airports; and 
b. among part-time Transportation Secu-
rity Officers. 
Recommendation 4: We recommend the As-
sistant Administrator, Human Capital, meet 
established timelines to implement the first 
phase of Career Progression for newly ap-
pointed entry-level Transportation Security 
Officers. 
Recommendation 5: We recommend the As-
sistant Administrator, Human Capital, ex-
amine increases in pay based upon skill level 
for Transportation Security Officers that 
could help attract and retain a strong work-
force. 
Recommendation 6: We recommend the As-
sistant Administrator, Human Capital, com-
pile a local hiring update message to remind 
airports to follow TSA records retention 
policies for Airport Assessment documenta-
tion. 
Recommendation 7: We recommend the As-
sistant Administrator, Human Capital, for-
mally document system functional require-
ments, such as the rating process criteria, 
for quality assurance purposes to ensure 
proper system logic in how applicants are 
ranked on the Certification Lists. 
Recommendation 8: We recommend the As-
sistant Administrator, Training and Devel-
opment, coordinate with Security Operations 
to enforce the pre-Basic Training Program 
requirements. 
Recommendation 9: We recommend the As-
sistant Administrator, Training and Devel-
opment, provide all airports access to the 
Basic Training Program curriculum in its 
entirety. 
MANAGEMENT COMMENTS AND OIG ANALYSIS 
TSA concurred with 
all 
of 
our 
rec-
ommendations and is taking steps or has im-
plemented actions to address them. Appendix 
B contains TSA’s management comments in 
their entirety. We also received technical 
comments to the draft report and revised the 
report as appropriate. We consider rec-
ommendations 1, 2, 5, 7, and 9 resolved and 
open. Recommendations 4, 6, and 8 are 
closed. Recommendation 3 remains unre-
solved and open because we did not agree 
with TSA’s proposed corrective action plan. 
A summary of TSA’s responses and our anal-
ysis follows. 
TSA Comments to Recommendation 1: 
TSA concurred with the recommendation. 
TSA explained its efforts to make every TSO 
applicant aware of the realities of the TSO 
position and ensure the agency conveys job 
expectations to TSO applicants. These ef-
forts include participating in job fairs and 
career events, hosting in-person and virtual 
information sessions, attaching an airport- 
specific fact sheet to every TSO Job Oppor-
tunity Announcement posted on the Federal 
Government’s 
official 
employment 
site, 
USAJobs, and creating and sharing the TSO 
Realistic Job Preview video that is commu-
nicated throughout the hiring process and 
accessible through various avenues. TSA will 
mandate that personnel scheduling the Air-
port Assessment review an airport’s hours of 
operations, typical shifts and days off, and 
typical duties of the position. Additionally, 
TSA will modify the Airport Assessment 
scheduling script to advise that each appli-
cant is required to watch the TSO Realistic 
Job Preview video prior to attending the as-
sessment. TSA expects these actions to begin 
by March 31, 2019. Additionally, TSA plans to 
include a compatibility assessment tool in 
the TSO hiring process, which the Office of 
Personnel Management will validate. The es-
timated completion date to pilot and fully 
deploy the compatibility assessment tool is 
September 30, 2019. 
OIG Analysis of TSA Comments: TSA has 
taken steps to satisfy the intent of this rec-
ommendation. 
We 
consider 
this 
rec-
ommendation resolved, but it will remain 
open until TSA provides documentation to 
support that all planned corrective actions 
are completed. 
Ms. SCANLON. Fortunately, Madam 
Speaker, this bill before us today will 
address each of those challenges. The 
Rights for Transportation Security Of-
ficers Act will honor those who protect 
America’s aviation security by bring-
ing the TSA personnel system within 
the bounds of the rest of the Federal 
workforce. 
H.R. 1140 will put an end to the cur-
rent TSA personnel directives that 
have allowed the TSA to be the judge 
and jury in workforce disciplinary mat-
ters, and require TSA to follow the 
labor-management employee relations 
statutes that provide workplace rights 
and protections to most Federal em-
ployees under title 5 of the U.S. Code; 
the provision that is most notable in 
efforts to increase employee retention 
and morale by putting TSOs on the 
general schedule pay scale and finally 
aligning pay with the vast majority of 
other Federal employees. 
This legislation has been a long time 
coming for the men and women who 
protect our skies and keep millions of 
us safe on a daily basis. During the 35- 
day partial government shutdown at 
the end of the last Congress, TSOs were 
required to work for more than 5 weeks 
without pay. At Philadelphia Inter-
national Airport in my district, a typ-
ical entry-level salary for a TSO is 
about $29,000 per year, without includ-
ing additional locality pay. 
Working without pay for over a 
month would be difficult if you made 
three 
times 
that 
amount, 
Madam 
Speaker, but it is unconscionable that 
the Federal Government would force 
the very people we trust to keep us safe 
into having to turn to food banks, 
short-term loans, and donations to 
make ends meet. Yet these Federal 
workers kept reporting for work even 
when they couldn’t afford gas and 
parking. These are not hypotheticals. 
In my district alone we collected food, 
diapers, gas cards, and other neces-
sities for TSOs who were not being 
paid. 
The Federal Government did not live 
up to its commitment to these TSOs, 
but these civil servants did not waiver 
in their dedication to keeping the fly-
ing public safe. 
My colleagues across the aisle have 
objected to this bill which would sup-
port our Federal workers by claiming 
that our national security is at risk, 
that TSA would lose flexibility, and 
that the bill is too expensive. 
To the first point, I would say that a 
TSA staffed by underpaid and over-
worked TSOs is a greater threat to na-
tional security than paying a fair wage 
to keep Americans safe. Pay is one of 
the top reasons that the TSA struggles 
with keeping good employees. We lose 
current and potential TSOs every day 
because they can make more money in 
lower pressure work environments else-
where. 
Whether in business, law, or govern-
ment, you get what you pay for, and I, 
for one, do not believe that the secu-
rity of our airports and skies or the 
lives of the traveling public are some-
thing we should be looking to get a 
bargain on. 
Further, granting the TSA workforce 
full collective bargaining rights under 
title 5 would not deny TSA the ability 
to remove bad employees or interfere 
with TSA’s authority to direct security 
operations. Federal agencies already 
under title 5 jurisdiction have the 
flexibility to quickly deal with bad ac-
tors, but ensuring that proper proto-
cols are followed in termination pro-
ceedings is a right that must be af-
forded to employees. This includes 
other Federal agencies with security 
and enforcement operations such as 
Customs and Border Patrol, the De-
partment of Defense, and others. 
The TSA has had years to address its 
issues of recruitment, retention, and 
training, but has failed to do so. Now it 
is time for Congress to bring TSA in 
line with other Federal agencies. The 
TSA is not a new Federal agency, nor 
is it destined to go away. So, in that 
sense we must make sure that these 
patriotic civil workers are properly 
compensated and given the workplace 
rights that they deserve. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.

yielding me the customary 30 minutes, 
and I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Madam Speaker, this bill has six 
main aspects that I have major con-
cerns with. 
First, 
the 
bill 
eliminates 
TSA’s 
unique personnel management authori-
ties created in the Aviation and Trans-
portation Security Act of 2001, com-
monly known as ATSA. 
This legislation moves employees of 
the TSA into the government pay 
schedule. In 2001, when Congress cre-
ated TSA, the decision was made not to 
do this in order to give the agency 
flexibility. At present, the TSA Admin-
istrator has authority over employee 
pay, 
hiring, 
termination, 
and 
dis-
cipline. 
TSA has repeatedly told us that plac-
ing the screener workforce under title 5 
would tie the agency’s hands related to 
national security policy, workforce 
management, 
and 
collective 
bar-
gaining. 
Specifically, TSA would not be able 
to continue a one-step removal process 
for employees found to have committed 
serious 
security 
breaches 
or 
mis-
conduct, such as allowing unauthorized 
access to secure areas or allowing 
threat items and illicit contraband 
through the security checkpoint. 
TSA’s ability to move employees to 
different checkpoints based on pas-
senger volume would also be curtailed. 
Currently, TSA can set new security 
policies TSOs must follow and move 
TSOs between checkpoints to manage 
passenger volume. Under this bill, how-
ever, both actions would be subject to 
collective bargaining and the security 
measures could be limited as a result. 
TSA’s ability to set security screen-
ing policies, such as when and how to 
conduct pat-downs, would be nego-
tiable with the union instead of being 
driven by national security impera-
tives. 
In fact, the bill eliminates the TSA’s 
authority to immediately fire employ-
ees for serious misconduct, including 
sexual assault, drug and alcohol abuse, 
arrest, theft, and intentional security 
breaches, 
such 
as 
allowing 
guns, 
knives, and explosives past the check-
point. In recent years, there have been 
several incidents of TSOs assaulting 
passengers, stealing passenger items, 
and allowing drugs past the check-
point. Now, we all know the majority 
of TSOs are good people doing good 
jobs. But there are some bad actors. 
On February 6, 2020, the State of 
California announced the arrest and 
prosecution of a former TSA screener 
resulting from a joint investigation ef-
fort by Federal, State, and local en-
forcement agencies and the TSA. 
According to the criminal complaint, 
the TSA screener used fraud or deceit 
to falsely imprison a woman going 
through security while stationed as a 
travel document checker at Los Ange-
les International Airport in June of 
2019. The screener allegedly insisted 
that the woman passenger needed extra 
screening in an elevator, where he told 
the passenger to reveal her full breasts 
and to lift her pants and underwear. 
The victim in the case stated that she 
complied with the TSO’s instructions 
out of fear that he would inappropri-
ately touch her. 
This sort of horrible incident is why 
it is imperative that TSA retain its 
one-step removal process for employees 
who sully the integrity and honor of 
the TSA mission and put American 
travelers at risk. 
Under title 5 protections, this TSA 
screener that I just talked about could 
remain on the Federal Government’s 
payroll for years before removal. That 
is wrong. Under this bill, TSA leader-
ship would lose the flexibility to re-
spond effectively to incidents such as 
the one I just described. 
The second reason I have concerns 
about this bill is just recently in 2019, 
the bipartisan Blue Ribbon Panel for 
the Transportation Security Adminis-
tration on Human Capital Service De-
livery specifically recommended that 
TSA not—I repeat not—switch to the 
general schedule, GS, system, calling it 
overly rigid and outdated. 
b 1245 
This panel is comprised of former of-
ficials 
from 
both 
Republican 
and 
Democratic administrations, and it is 
led by a Department of Homeland Se-
curity official from the Obama admin-
istration. 
They all pointed out that, under the 
current system and law, TSA can pay 
its employees more than they can 
make under title 5. It called on TSA to 
use the statutory flexibility Congress 
provided it to provide targeted pay in-
creases, which I support. The Blue Rib-
bon Panel specifically recommended 
against the policies contained in H.R. 
1140. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD the Blue Ribbon Panel report, 
titled 
‘‘Final 
Findings 
and 
Rec-
ommendations, Blue Ribbon Panel for 
the Transportation Security Adminis-
tration.’’ 
FINAL FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
BLUE RIBBON PANEL FOR THE TRANSPORTATION 
SECURITY ADMINISTRATION (TSA) 
The Transportation Security Administra-
tion (TSA) has faced numerous challenges 
with human capital policy, operations, and 
services to support mission requirements. 
The Agency determined it needed a third- 
party review to identify the underlying prob-
lems and recommend solutions. ICF was con-
tracted to perform the work and convened a 
Blue-Ribbon Panel (the Panel) to review, 
analyze, and make recommendations for im-
provements. This Report documents the ‘‘As 
Is’’ state and recommendations for improve-
ment. It is based on extensive interviews 
with Office of Human Capital (OHC) and 
other headquarters (HQ) stakeholders, inter-
views with airport leaders, and focus groups 
with the National Advisory Council (NAC) 
and Transportation Security Officers (TSOs). 
In addition, the Panel reviewed documents 
and data provided by TSA. ICF also analyzed 
TSA data to look for trends, corroboration, 
or potential root causes of identified issues. 
Because of the nature of the Panel’s 
work—identifying 
problems 
and 
recom-
mending solutions—this report documents 
difficult, 
long-standing 
challenges. 
The 
Panel also found areas of excellence. The 
TSO workforce, for example, demonstrates a 
remarkable level of dedication to their work. 
Even during the seven-week partial govern-
ment shutdown, the vast majority of TSOs 
showed up and did their jobs. Some even par-
ticipated in recruiting events to help TSA 
recruit new officers. Given the low pay and 
difficult working conditions that are inher-
ent in TSA’s screening work, the dedication 
these officers show is extraordinary. 
TSA’s low ranking in the Partnership for 
Public Service’s Best Places to Work in the 
Federal Government may lead some to con-
clude that there are no great leaders in TSA. 
That is not true. The Panel found there are 
airports with outstanding leaders whose 
work clearly demonstrates excellence. The 
challenge facing TSA is to take the lessons 
learned from those airports, feedback from 
employees and stakeholders, and Panel rec-
ommendations to transform human capital 
operations agency-wide. 
The Panel’s key findings and recommenda-
tions are categorized into two major areas: 
Examining Human Capital Service Delivery 
and Supporting the Transportation Security 
Officer (TSO) Workforce. 
TSA human capital challenges include in-
effective use of Aviation and Transportation 
Security Act (ATSA) flexibilities, an ill-de-
fined service delivery model that relies on 
contractors with insufficient oversight and 
inadequate 
Human 
Capital 
Information 
Technology, poorly trained field staff, and a 
headquarters human capital office that lacks 
strategic focus and demonstrates insufficient 
teamwork. 
The policy and human capital operations 
challenges appear to result from deficiencies 
in the Office of Human Capital (OHC) and an 
inconsistent approach to field delivery of 
human capital services. The OHC suffers 
from a lack of teamwork and leadership 
challenges. 
Interviews 
with 
customers, 
stakeholders, and OHC staff make clear that 
human capital programs are not designed in 
the context of a cohesive strategy. OHC cus-
tomers gave negative feedback on key pro-
grams, particularly human capital informa-
tion technology systems, classification and 
position management, and hiring and pay, 
with a few bright spots in employee relations 
and training. OHC leaders consistently re-
ported a culture where cooperation across 
OHC organizations was lacking and peer re-
lationships are poor. 
TSA’s Human Capital Office issues are sig-
nificant, but the Panel has encountered 
other human capital organizations with such 
issues that have been transformed into effec-
tive units. With significant leadership sup-
port, the Panel believes the improvements in 
Human Capital Office leadership, work proc-
esses and policies required for TSA to have 
acceptable 
human 
capital 
services 
are 
achievable and has included recommenda-
tions for implementable and substantive 
changes that will provide a way forward for 
TSA. This report includes multiple rec-
ommendations. The most pressing among 
those recommendations are the need for 
more effective human capital leadership, a 
well thought out process for human capital 
service delivery, greater use of ATSA flexi-
bilities, modern human capital technology, 
and standardizing and realigning the field 
human capital structure. Adoption of these 
recommendations, coupled with actions TSA 
is already taking to make improvements, 
should 
result 
in 
significantly 
improved 
human capital policies and services. 
The 2018 TSA Exit Survey report indicated 
employees were concerned about leadership 
issues, having experienced a ‘‘lack of man-
agement skills,’’ ‘‘unfair practices (e.g., in

performance appraisal, disciplinary actions, 
career advancement, etc.),’’ ‘‘unequal levels 
of respect,’’ a ‘‘hostile work environment,’’ 
and ‘‘inadequate communication with the 
workforce.’’ TSOs perceive favoritism and 
express an inability to voice complaints 
about issues. 
The Panel believes the systemic problems 
with TSO pay may be a major contributor to 
some of those perceptions, due to the inabil-
ity of TSOs (even those with exceptional per-
formance ratings) to advance within their 
pay bands. Employee perceptions of leader-
ship and organizational fairness may under-
mine their commitment to stay at TSA. 
Surveys and Focus Groups reveal that TSO 
pay is a key issue for the screening work-
force, and a complex problem. These officers 
work long hours, have difficult working con-
ditions, and are the backbone of the TSA 
mission. By some measures, TSO annual pay 
in some locations lags well behind industry 
counterparts. TSO perceptions regarding in-
equity in their pay are aggravated by the 
fact that their pay averages about one-third 
of that of TSA employees in Management, 
Administration and Professional (MAP) posi-
tions. The Panel recognizes that the nature 
of the TSO’s work and that of employees in 
MAP positions means a disparity in pay is 
always going to exist. While there is no indi-
cation it was deliberate, TSA’s use of its 
flexibilities has boosted MAP pay above gov-
ernment averages, with TSO pay remaining 
below those averages for comparable jobs. 
The disparity is driven in part by a pay and 
performance management process that pro-
vides little hope of movement, especially 
within the E-Band. A TSO at the bottom of 
the E-band, even with exceptional perform-
ance ratings year after year, would take 
more than 30 years to reach the top of the E- 
Band. This produces the effect that the E- 
Band pay range is illusory, with few TSOs in 
the middle or at the top of the band. 
TSO turnover is high in the first three 
years in comparison to other positions in 
TSA and in the federal workforce. TSO turn-
over is somewhat consistent with other low 
wage jobs in the private sector with com-
parable skill requirements for initial hiring, 
where annual turnover rates of 20 percent or 
more are common. That does not mean TSA 
should accept high turnover as a given. The 
cost of turnover (in terms of recruiting, hir-
ing and training replacement officers and 
lower productivity of newer and less skilled 
officers) is high and the effect on the work-
force which carries the screening workload 
in absence of a full TSO cohort is significant. 
If TSA can retain Officers beyond the first 
three years, turnover reduces to a much 
more manageable level. 
Turnover among longer term employees 
may be driven by the stability of employ-
ment and benefits TSOs receive. Although 
TSA operates outside of the general govern-
ment pay and classification statutes found in 
Title 5 of the U.S. Code, the agency offers 
the same or better benefits as other agencies 
and provides greater job security than many 
private sector employers. As a result, if TSA 
can address pay, leadership, and turnover 
issues, the Panel believes the agency will see 
reduced costs, better morale, and a more sta-
ble workforce. 
This report includes recommendations to 
address TSO pay and advancement, and 
other critical issues for the TSO workforce. 
Although we often find that pay is a sec-
ondary issue for employees and other leader-
ship issues tend to drive turnover, Focus 
Group findings highlight pay as the greatest 
issue driving turnover. 
The Panel acknowledges that TSA recog-
nizes the pay issues and is seeking ways to 
address them. The scale of TSA operations 
means that even small across-the-board pay 
increases can cost tens of millions of dollars. 
The Panel recommends targeted pay raises, 
rather than across-the-board increases that 
might consume precious salary dollars to 
raise pay in locations where pay is not a 
problem. 
Although TSOs identify pay as the key 
driver of turnover, the Panel believes other 
problematic issues must be addressed as 
well. If pay problems are reduced, the other 
issues will continue to affect morale and 
turnover. Other key recommendations ad-
dress the hiring process, which the Panel be-
lieves should be significantly modernized, 
and leader selection and development, which 
is essential to address many of the morale 
issues that are contributors to morale prob-
lems and turnover. The Panel also rec-
ommends changes to the promotion process 
and support for Information Technology im-
provements that can simultaneously in-
crease operational efficiency and trans-
parency, likely reducing concerns of favor-
itism expressed by the TSO workforce. 
One recommendation the Panel heard re-
peatedly from employees was moving TSA 
into the General Schedule (GS). The Panel 
does not agree. The General Schedule is a 70 
year-old classification and compensation 
system from the last century and is the sub-
ject of countless studies and recommenda-
tions from good government organizations 
who consistently find it is too inflexible to 
meet the needs of the 21st century work-
force. A better course of action is to use ex-
isting ATSA flexibility to improve the TSA 
pay system so that it operates at a level su-
perior to the GS system. 
This Report provides a high-level roadmap 
for changes to TSA’s Human Capital policies 
and processes, which if adopted, should have 
a significant positive impact on TSA work-
force and mission operations. 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, third, 
some benefits currently available to 
the screener workforce under ATSA 
would not be possible if this bill were 
to become law. 
The bill does not fix the morale prob-
lem. 
The bill does not guarantee addi-
tional pay or benefits for TSOs. It may 
actually make situations worse. The 
bill eliminates the authority TSA has 
to pay TSOs more than other Federal 
employees under title 5. 
It also eliminates several benefits, 
such as the broadest application of vet-
erans’ hiring preference in the Federal 
Government, meaning that veterans 
may not get the same preference that 
they do now; shift trades between em-
ployees; voluntary leave transfers; par-
tial overtime pay as compensation for 
schedule changes; and career progres-
sion bonuses of up to 5 percent of a 
screener’s salary. 
Fourth, we have yet to receive a CBO 
score. However, TSA estimates the bill 
will cost $1.2 billion over the next 5 
years. To cover the cost, funding for se-
curity priorities would be reduced. The 
bill does not even have a specific au-
thorization of appropriations or means 
of paying for moving these employees 
under title 5. 
The fifth reason I have a concern on 
this bill, H.R. 1140, amounts to a forced 
unionization of the TSA workforce and 
a forced designation of the union that 
will represent that same workforce. It 
does not allow for an intervening elec-
tion for TSA screeners to choose their 
labor representation. 
As such, this bill benefits one specific 
union, the American Federation of 
Government Employees. The bill does 
not provide for an intervening election 
to give screeners the right to choose 
which union they want to represent 
them. 
In 2011, AFGE was recognized by the 
Obama administration to represent the 
screener workforce after two elections. 
Approximately 8,900 screeners voted for 
the union. However, today, there are 
approximately 45,000 screeners subject 
to this bill. While TSA employees did 
select AFGE as their bargaining agent 
in 2011, it is remarkable that this bill 
specifically dictates which union will 
be representing TSA employees with-
out a more recent vote or all employ-
ees voting. 
Sixth, this bill, once again, is a par-
tisan messaging bill that will not be-
come law. We know that because I 
highly doubt the Senate is going to 
hear this bill. Yet again, the majority 
refuses to work with the minority to 
move viable legislation to address real 
problems. 
Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to 
the rule, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, as expected, we have 
heard that eliminating the unique per-
sonnel management tools that were 
initially afforded to the TSA is some-
how going to undermine the organiza-
tion, but this ignores the reality that 
those tools are no longer needed nor ef-
fective. 
The record is replete with evidence 
that we need to reform the way the 
TSA is managed in order to address 
very, very serious issues of recruit-
ment, retention, and training. 
What is posited here is a false choice 
between workers’ rights and national 
security, and we reject that choice. 
We were given an example of gross 
sexual misconduct as a reason why 
workers shouldn’t have organizational 
rights. But under title 5’s rule, which 
would apply under this bill, agencies 
can expedite personnel actions against 
employees accused of criminal activ-
ity, and they also can be removed from 
their duty post for potential harm to 
themselves or to others. 
Again, this is a false choice between 
workers’ rights and national security, 
or just plain old management. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman from Pennsyl-
vania (Ms. SCANLON), a member of the 
Rules Committee, for her leadership. I 
thank the minority’s representative, as 
well. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to enthusiasti-
cally support H.R. 1140. I am very 
proud to be an enthusiastic cosponsor 
of this legislation and to explain to my 
colleagues and the American people 
how we started the Committee on

member, if you will, being here during 
the heinous terrorist acts of 9/11 and 
knowing that the Nation needed to put 
together quickly a Homeland Security 
Department, second in size to the De-
partment of Defense, I believe. 
We organized the Transportation Se-
curity Administration fast and in a 
way that the Administrator would, 
really, have all powers—all powers. In 
doing so, we failed to give them Fed-
eral civil service protection. So, this 
legislation is legislation that is crucial 
because the TSA workforce is among 
the lowest paid in the Federal Govern-
ment and lacks basic workplace protec-
tion afforded to most other govern-
ment workers. As a result, TSA strug-
gles with low morale and high attri-
tion. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1140, the Rights for 
Transportation Security Officers Act of 
2020, is nothing that has been pre-
viously described—nothing like that. It 
is an opportunity to maintain a profes-
sional force of individuals who every 
day protect Americans. 
It is unfortunate that, as we go 
through our normal life and we see 
TSO officers, and we see them in their 
blue shirts and their dark pants, we 
take them for granted, quite frankly. 
As a former chair of the Transpor-
tation Security Subcommittee of the 
Homeland Security Committee, I was 
intimately engaged in knowing just 
what the work was that they did. 
Do we understand the numbers of 
weapons that are found every day? I 
am saying it generically because some 
of this is classified. 
The number of incidences that are 
thwarted, if you will, by TSO officers— 
do we realize that one of our great offi-
cers lost his life in Los Angeles, and his 
family suffers? 
This bill would provide reasonable 
protection. It would give gradations of 
salaries. It will allow us to keep a pro-
fessional staff. 
We attempted to put a Band-Aid on 
this by providing for professional de-
velopment training in Georgia, where 
other Federal law enforcement acad-
emies were. That was not enough. 
In fact, they had to change it for 
these individuals who work for a period 
of time before they went to the acad-
emy because they were losing people 
after they went to the academy be-
cause they were not earning the com-
pensation that they should. There was 
no promotion. 
Just the other day, a very fine young 
woman, excellent, who was respected 
and had come up to headquarters, she 
left us for another Federal agency be-
cause there was no advancement or op-
portunity. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
RUIZ). The time of the gentlewoman 
has expired. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
an additional 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from Texas. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, 
these are fine Americans. Many of 
them are former military, and they 
support their families. To give them 
the opportunity to, first of all, have a 
right to grievance, to ensure that they 
have nonreduction on pay and com-
pensation, that they have preservation 
of their civil rights—there is no right 
to strike. But it is a right to have the 
ability to engage their employer and to 
be able to be respected. 
Mr. Speaker, I am enthusiastic about 
this. Names like Bill and Patrick and 
Alfred, other men and women of the 
Transportation Security Administra-
tion, the TSOs’ names, I am sure, that 
we could call in our respective airports, 
the people we know every day, our 
neighbors. They do a great and fine job. 
We must pass this bill, and I hope we 
pass it in a bipartisan way. Think 
about not paying those who are saving 
your lives every single day in the Na-
tion’s airports. Think about how you 
are treating them. Think about the low 
pay. Think about the compensation 
that does not allow them to have high 
morale. 
Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the 
show of support for passing this bill, 
and I ask my colleagues to support it. 
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I, too, support increas-
ing pay for our TSOs. I am the ranking 
member, Republican member, on the 
Homeland Security Subcommittee on 
Transportation and Maritime Security, 
so we have had hearings on this. 
I do believe that they need to get a 
pay increase. It is a tough job. The 
ones I go through, in the Phoenix and 
Washington DCA airports, do a good 
job. So I am not opposed to that at all, 
and I am hoping I can work together 
with my Democratic colleagues on the 
budget so we can try to increase the 
budget so that they can increase pay 
for good TSOs who are doing a good 
job. 
But what I do know is that I don’t 
like this bill. I already said the reasons 
why I don’t like this bill, but one of 
them is specifically about the case I 
talked about where a bad TSO officer, 
someone who did a bad thing—sexually 
assaulted a woman—that then they 
wouldn’t be removed immediately if 
this bill came into law. 
My colleague, Representative SCAN-
LON, said: Well, under title 5 rules, they 
could be removed from their post. 
Well, that is good, but they are still 
getting paid. And I can tell you what, 
I bet if I went out on the street right 
now and I said: Do you think it is fine 
if a TSO officer sexually assaulted a 
woman on an elevator under false pre-
tenses, do you think that Federal em-
ployee should still be getting paid? 
They would say absolutely not. They 
would be outraged. That is one of my 
major concerns on this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, I will bring to the floor 
H.R. 5595, the Israel Anti-Boycott Act. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to insert the text of my amend-
ment in the RECORD, along with extra-
neous material, immediately prior to 
the vote on the previous question. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Arizona? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, the Boy-
cott, Divestment and Sanctions cam-
paign, commonly known as BDS, is 
anti-Israel, anti-peace, and damaging 
to U.S. interests. 
This bill amends the Export Adminis-
tration Act of 1979 to prohibit boycotts 
or requests for boycotts imposed by 
international governmental organiza-
tions against Israel. This will protect 
American companies from being forced 
to give information to international 
organizations for the furthering of boy-
cotts against Israel. 
This bill establishes Congress’ oppo-
sition to the Boycott, Divestment and 
Sanctions movement, and establishes 
that Congress considers the United Na-
tions Human Rights Council’s creation 
of a database of companies doing busi-
ness in the West Bank, East Jerusalem, 
and the Golan Heights in March 2016 to 
be an act of BDS. 
b 1300 
We cannot be quiet when it comes to 
combating anti-Semitism and anti- 
Israel mentalities. We need to work to-
gether in Congress and pass common-
sense legislation on this issue. H.R. 
5595 does just that. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
New 
York 
(Mr. 
ZELDIN), my good friend. 
Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, I urge my 
colleagues to defeat the previous ques-
tion so that the House may take up 
H.R. 5595, the Israel Anti-Boycott Act, 
that would help fight back against the 
BDS movement. 
This bill would prohibit boycotts or 
requests for boycotts imposed by inter-
national governmental organizations 
against Israel and would protect Amer-
ican companies from being coerced to 
provide information to those organiza-
tions for the purpose of furthering boy-
cotts against Israel. 
This bill holds individuals who at-
tempt to violate this protection ac-
countable. Additionally, it establishes 
Congress’ opposition to the BDS move-
ment and condemns the United Na-
tions’ Human Rights Council’s creation 
of a blacklist of companies doing busi-
ness in the West Bank, East Jerusalem, 
and the Golan Heights as an act of 
BDS. 
This legislation does not impede the 
right of any individual American to 
boycott or criticize Israel. It is okay to 
have reasonable, legitimate concerns 
with any government, including our 
own and allies like Israel, but this 
hate-fueled movement is not all about 
affirming the rights of Palestinians. 
The BDS movement has fueled anti- 
Semitism across college campuses and 
in our country’s politics. I hear from 
Jewish students on college campuses 
across America who are being sub-
jected to blatant anti-Semitism under 
the guise of BDS. For example, at Syr-
acuse University, they are granting in-
ternship school credit to students in-
terning with pro-BDS organizations

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1483 
March 4, 2020 
after a slew of anti-Semitic graffiti 
vandalized the school. 
The founder of BDS was blatantly 
anti-Semitic, and this movement is 
being pushed by many people who sup-
port a one-state solution that would 
end Israel, our Nation’s greatest ally. 
BDS tries to delegitimize Israel by 
turning it into a pariah state cut off 
from all trade, tourism, military, dip-
lomatic, and cultural ties with the rest 
of the world. Last month, the U.N. did 
it again and published a blacklist of 
companies doing business in the West 
Bank. 
We must forcefully condemn this. 
This House, last year, passed H. Res. 
246, a resolution to condemn the BDS 
movement. Making a statement was a 
start, but now it is time to do some-
thing about it and pass legislation with 
teeth. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
defeat the rule and defeat the previous 
question. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
In closing, I want to urge my Demo-
cratic colleagues to vote against this 
rule and H.R. 1140 and the previous 
question so we can assert my anti-BDS 
amendment. 
The bill, as I stated, would eliminate 
TSA’s ability to immediately fire em-
ployees for serious misconduct, like 
what happened in California. The bill 
would also take away TSA’s ability to 
give the TSOs many of the benefits 
that they currently get, such as bo-
nuses and overtime pay. 
I really think we need to work to-
gether to ensure TSA employees are 
happy and enjoy their work, and that is 
why I said I am supportive of increas-
ing their pay, especially that of good 
and productive TSOs. We need to pro-
vide incentives to help bring good mo-
rale to these hardworking employees, 
not the opposite. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge ‘‘no’’ on the pre-
vious question, ‘‘no’’ on the underlying 
measure, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
H.R. 1140 is a pro-security and pro- 
Federal worker piece of legislation. 
The TSA is no longer a startup agen-
cy requiring maximum flexibility dur-
ing a period of national emergency, and 
Congress, in previous administrations, 
has taken actions to reflect that. 
Ten years after its creation, in 2011, 
TSA employees were given labor union 
representation. This was a good step 
forward. However, the time is now to 
provide the 60,000 TSA employees the 
same worker rights and protections af-
forded to other Federal workers under 
the U.S. Code. 
It is a sad and shameful day for the 
government when anyone is forced to 
turn to food pantries to feed their fam-
ily, employed or not, but it is unac-
ceptable that Federal workers who 
work to protect and serve all Ameri-
cans would be without a paycheck for 
weeks at a time—over the holidays, no 
less. 
Working people all over the United 
States are sacrificing more and earning 
less. This is a systemic problem that 
will not be solved by this bill. But, in 
order to rebuild the middle class that 
got so many of us into this body where 
we are today, we need to value Federal 
workers for the job they do and the 
services they provide to all of us. 
There are times and places for cut-
ting costs and reducing expenses, but I 
do not believe that we as a body should 
do so in a way that negatively impacts 
national security or does so to the det-
riment of the men and women who 
keep us safe. I believe it is the respon-
sibility of the Federal Government to 
responsibly pay its Federal workers. 
The hundreds of thousands of civil 
servants in this country do not belong 
to one political party or all subscribe 
to the same political beliefs. No, they 
do their jobs because they are in serv-
ice to this Nation, and, in return, they 
deserve reasonable wages and rights in 
the workplace. I do not think that this 
is too much to ask. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on 
the rule and the previous question. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mrs. LESKO is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 877 
At the end of the resolution, add the 
following: 
SEC. 4. Immediately upon adoption of this 
resolution, the House shall resolve into the 
Committee of the Whole House on the state 
of the Union for consideration of the bill 
(H.R. 5595) to impose additional prohibitions 
relating to foreign boycotts under Export 
Control Reform Act of 2018, and for other 
purposes. The first reading of the bill shall 
be dispensed with. All points of order against 
consideration of the bill are waived. General 
debate shall be confined to the bill and shall 
not exceed one hour equally divided and con-
trolled by the chair and ranking minority 
member of the Committee on Foreign Af-
fairs. After general debate the bill shall be 
considered for amendment under the five- 
minute rule. All points of order against pro-
visions in the bill are waived. When the com-
mittee rises and reports the bill back to the 
House with a recommendation that the bill 
do pass, the previous question shall be con-
sidered as ordered on the bill and amend-
ments thereto to final passage without inter-
vening motion except one motion to recom-
mit with or without instructions. If the 
Committee of the Whole rises and reports 
that it has come to no resolution on the bill, 
then on the next legislative day the House 
shall, immediately after the third daily 
order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, 
resolve into the Committee of the Whole for 
further consideration of the bill. 
SEC. 5. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not 
apply to the consideration of H.R. 5595. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time, and I 
move the previous question on the res-
olution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on ordering the previous 
question. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair 
will reduce to 5 minutes the minimum 
time for any electronic vote on the 
question of adoption of the resolution. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 219, nays 
194, not voting 16, as follows:

IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE 
Accordingly, 
the 
House 
resolved 
itself into the Committee of the Whole 
House on the state of the Union for the 
consideration of the bill (H.R. 1140) to 
enhance the security operations of the 
Transportation Security Administra-
tion and stability of the transportation 
security workforce by applying the per-
sonnel system under title 5, United 
States Code, to employees of the 
Transportation Security Administra-
tion who provide screening of all pas-
sengers and property, and for other 
purposes, with Mr. CUELLAR
in the 
chair. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the 
bill is considered read the first time. 
General debate shall be confined to 
the bill and shall not exceed 1 hour 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and the ranking minority mem-
ber of the Committee on Homeland Se-
curity. 
The gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. 
THOMPSON) and the gentleman from 
Alabama (Mr. ROGERS) each will con-
trol 30 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Mississippi. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Chair, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong sup-
port of H.R. 1140, the Rights for Trans-
portation Security Officers Act of 2020. 
For well over a decade, Chairwoman 
NITA LOWEY and I have championed 
this legislation to provide TSA front-
line security workers the basic rights 
and benefits they deserve. 
Today, H.R. 1140 has 242 bipartisan 
cosponsors and is strongly supported 
by the American Federation of Govern-
ment Employees and the Transport 
Workers Union of America. 
When TSA was stood up after the 
September 11 attacks, Congress gave 
the agency broad authority to develop 
a new, more nimble personnel system 
to address national security issues that 
threatened our transportation system. 
Over the years, TSA’s security poli-
cies, 
technologies, 
and 
capabilities 
have evolved to provide a formidable 
defense against potential terrorist at-
tacks. 
Unfortunately, TSA’s personnel man-
agement system has not evolved with 
the rest of the agency. The modern, 
nimble system Congress envisioned was 
never realized. 
Instead, Transportation Security of-
ficers, or TSOs, are subject to an anti-
quated system that does not provide 
appropriate pay, regular salary in-
creases, or basic civil service protec-
tions. 
Further, an employee subject to a 
disciplinary action does not have the 
right to appeal to an independent third 
party, such as the Merit Systems Pro-
tection Board. Today, the TSA Admin-
istrator serves as judge, jury, and exe-
cutioner for disciplinary proceedings. 
According to a former TSA Deputy 
Administrator, the lack of due process 
protections within TSA has bred a cul-
ture of retribution and arbitrary per-
sonnel 
practices, 
leading 
to 
mis-
behavior and a reluctance to report se-
curity vulnerabilities. 
When TSA leadership has used its 
special personnel authorities, it has 
been mostly to benefit senior manage-
ment, not the frontline workforce. 
In one instance, a senior manager re-
ceived $90,000 in bonuses in a single 
year, yet the men and women in the 
screening workforce make starting sal-
aries of just $29,000 and are among the 
lowest paid Federal workers. They are 
forced to live paycheck to paycheck 
even as their job responsibilities have 
grown 
increasingly 
complex 
with 
changes in threats and technologies. 
Today, few TSOs have advanced be-
yond the bottom levels of TSA’s pay 
bands, even after years of service. 
Under the Obama administration, the 
frontline TSA workforce was, for the 
first time, granted the ability to 
unionize. Many of us hoped that this 
change would lead to TSA abandoning 
unfair practices. 
Disappointingly, TSA limited the 
range of issues subject to collective 
bargaining to a narrow set of issues 
that, over time, have been repeatedly 
scaled back. 
TSA struggles with low morale and 
high attrition, consistently ranking 
near the bottom of the annual ‘‘Best 
Places to Work’’ survey. In fact, this 
year, TSA ranked 415th out of 415 agen-
cy components—dead last—on pay sat-
isfaction. 
Low morale and high attrition have 
had an adverse impact on the agency, 
crippling TSA’s ability to develop a 
mature workforce. According to the 
DHS inspector general, over a 2-year 
span in 2016 and 2017, one in three 
Transportation Security officers quit. 
As Members of Congress, many of us 
fly two or three times a week. We prob-
ably see and interact with Transpor-
tation Security officers more than any 
other Federal employees. We know 
them. 
How can we ask these brave men and 
women to protect us from terrorist at-
tacks, yet not provide them with the 
basic protections most Federal employ-
ees receive? 
This bill will place TSA under title 5 
like 
most 
other 
Federal 
agencies, 
granting the workforce better pay and 
regular salary increases. 
Employees would have robust collec-
tive bargaining rights like other Fed-
eral employees, such as Customs and 
Border Protection officers in the De-
partment of Homeland Security. And

H1486 
March 4, 2020 
in instances when an employee feels 
they have been unfairly disciplined, 
they could have their case considered 
by an independent party like other 
Federal employees. 
Importantly, 
TSA’s 
management 
would still be able to remove screeners 
from duty if their presence jeopardizes 
the mission of the agency, and security 
procedures would not be subject to col-
lective bargaining. 
While investing in the workforce will 
have an up-front cost, it will pay off in 
the long run. The DHS inspector gen-
eral found that, in 2017 alone, TSA 
spent approximately $16 million to hire 
and train nearly 2,000 people who left 
within months of being hired. That 
level of turnover is not sustainable. 
Enactment of H.R. 1140 will reduce 
attrition, improve morale, and position 
TSA to have a more experienced work-
force with the proficiency needed to 
execute TSA’s national security mis-
sion. 
Mr. Chair, I thank my colleagues for 
their support on this bill, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
b 1400 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition 
to H.R. 1140. 
After the terror attacks of 9/11, Con-
gress recognized that, in order for TSA 
to successfully carry out its critical 
mission, it had to accommodate the 
agency’s 
unique 
operational 
needs. 
That is why, when Congress passed the 
Aviation and Transportation Security 
Act, we gave TSA one-of-a-kind au-
thorities 
to 
respond 
to 
evolving 
threats. 
TSA has used these authorities over 
time to remain flexible and account-
able to the needs of a diverse transpor-
tation system where each airport faces 
a unique threat landscape. These flexi-
bilities are key to keeping the public 
safe. That is why I am very concerned 
about the impact this bill will have on 
the security of our aviation system. 
By moving the screener workforce 
under title V, this bill would eliminate 
many of those critical flexibilities. For 
example, current law allows for the im-
mediate termination of employees who 
intentionally allow guns, knives, or ex-
plosives through a checkpoint. Under 
this bill, that employee could remain 
on the TSA payroll for months, or even 
longer. 
Current law allows TSA to set new 
security requirements, such as en-
hanced passenger screening, when in-
telligence indicates credible threats. 
How new security requirements are im-
plemented could be subject to negotia-
tion if the union bill were to become 
law. 
Right now, TSA has the flexibility to 
move screener checkpoints to alleviate 
long lines and ensure security. The leg-
islation before us restricts that flexi-
bility. 
In addition to the impact on secu-
rity, I am concerned with how the bill 
proposes to transition the screener 
workforce. I don’t think it is fair for 
Congress to dictate which union gets to 
represent 45,000 screeners, but that is 
just what this bill does. The bill sets 
into law the exclusive bargaining agent 
for the screeners and requires TSA to 
immediately negotiate with them. 
Under this bill, there is no inter-
vening union election. Screeners never 
get a chance to exercise their constitu-
tional right to choose their representa-
tion. I think that is wrong. 
Beyond the consequences for aviation 
security and the fundamental ques-
tions of fairness, this bill does little to 
improve the pay and working condi-
tions 
for 
screeners. 
In 
fact, 
TSA 
screeners will lose benefits under this 
proposal. 
If this bill becomes law, screeners 
will lose the ability to trade shifts with 
one another or donate accrued leave to 
their fellow workers. Certain pay over-
time would be prohibited. Career mile-
stone bonuses would no longer be of-
fered. Many veterans would no longer 
qualify for hiring preferences. 
The Congressional Budget Office esti-
mates that this bill will cost $1.8 bil-
lion over 5 years. That is a 20 percent 
increase over TSA’s current budget. 
That is a tremendous cost for so little 
return. 
In May 2019, a blue-ribbon panel led 
by Clinton and Obama administration 
human capital experts strongly argued 
against moving screeners under title V 
as this bill would do. That panel right-
ly pointed out that, under current law, 
TSA can pay screeners more than they 
would make under title V. 
That is the real irony with this bill. 
It purports to improve pay and benefits 
for screeners, but, under current law, 
screeners could be paid more and re-
ceive better benefits than this bill 
would allow. 
I have long advocated for increased 
pay for the screener workforce, and I 
agree with the blue-ribbon panel that 
TSA should build a pay system supe-
rior to that of the GS schedule. The 
problem has always been funding. 
Past administrations have requested 
funding for increased screener pay, and 
past Congresses have not provided it. 
Fortunately, the President’s fiscal year 
2021 budget requests an increase in 
funding to provide raises and bonuses 
for screeners. 
If the majority truly wants to fix the 
problem, they should work with us on a 
bill to fund these pay raises and imple-
ment the recommendations of the bi-
partisan blue-ribbon panel. That is the 
bill we should have on the floor today. 
Instead, they have, yet again, decided 
to move a partisan messaging bill that 
rewards their political supporters. This 
time it comes at the expense of tax-
payers and security. 
Like the rest of them, this partisan 
messaging bill will never become law. 
The Senate won’t take it up. The Presi-
dent said he would veto it. It is a waste 
of time. 
At some point, I hope the majority 
rejects this partisan approach to legis-
lating and works with us on our Na-
tion’s priorities. 
Mr. Chair, I urge all Members to vote 
‘‘no,’’ and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
New 
York 
(Mrs. 
LOWEY), who has championed this issue 
from day one. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in 
strong support of H.R. 1140, the Rights 
for Transportation Security Officers 
Act of 2020. Chairman THOMPSON and I 
have worked on this bill for a very long 
time, and I am glad the House is con-
sidering it today. 
H.R. 1140 would give TSA’s screening 
workforce the same rights afforded to 
other Federal workers under title V, 
like fair pay under the General Sched-
ule pay scale, sick leave according to 
OPM guidelines, and collective bar-
gaining rights. 
Our TSOs have earned these rights. 
TSOs serve on the front lines of avia-
tion security and protect the traveling 
public on a daily basis. It is unreason-
able to deny these hardworking men 
and women who keep us safe the basic 
protections of Federal civil service. 
We must pass this bill today to send 
a clear message to TSA from Congress 
that a system denying TSOs predict-
ability and consistency is unaccept-
able. H.R. 1140 would improve the mo-
rale and stability of our screening 
workforce and help ensure safety at 
our Nation’s airports. 
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair-
man, I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFAZIO), the 
chair of the House Transportation and 
Infrastructure Committee. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
As a little bit of history, the gen-
tleman from Alabama wasn’t here 
when we created the Transportation 
Security Administration. It was cre-
ated in the Aviation Subcommittee of 
the Transportation and Infrastructure 
Committee. I was the ranking member; 
John Mica was the chair. The provi-
sions he referenced were not intended 
to oppress the workforce. 
Before 9/11, all of the securities were 
provided by the airlines, and they 
never met a low bidder they didn’t like. 
We had people who were felons and peo-
ple who were in the country illegally 
who were doing the screening. 
By the way, it was the lowest entry- 
level job in the airport, and we had tes-
timony from the Screener of the Year, 
once, who said: Hey, you know, people 
just move through these jobs because 
they got to go to McDonald’s. They’ll 
do better. 
Now, we aren’t treating these profes-
sionals much better than that. They 
are the lowest paid Federal employees, 
providing security to the billion people 
who flew last year. They worked 
through the shutdown with no pay.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1487 
March 4, 2020 
They don’t earn much money, so they 
don’t have a lot of savings, but they 
worked through the shutdown. 
These people deserve not only a pay 
raise, but they also deserve workers’ 
rights and whistleblower protections 
from abusive management. 
The gentleman expressed concern 
about $1.8 billion over 10 years. Well, 
join me on my FASTER bill; that is, 
this administration is diverting $2 bil-
lion a year in passenger security fees. 
Passengers pay the fee. It is supposed 
to provide security. No, it is going into 
the maw of the Federal Government 
and being spent somewhere else. Re-
claim that money. 
Don’t worry about the stupid scoring 
stuff. Oh, it is making the deficit look 
smaller. Whatever. We are charging 
passengers for security. Give them the 
security. Give these workers a pay 
raise, and give them decent workers’ 
rights and protections. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Chair, I would point out to my 
colleague from Oregon that the $1.8 bil-
lion was over 5 years, not 10 years. The 
screening fee that the gentleman was 
referring to was diverted under the 
Obama administration to general def-
icit relief. 
But the fact is I agree fully with 
Chairman THOMPSON that we should be 
paying our screeners more. It is our 
fault. Congress has not funded the abil-
ity of TSA to raise their pay. 
The irony of this bill is it would 
make it harder to pay them more; it 
would pay them less. If we would fund 
the TSA for what they are requesting, 
current law would allow them to have 
better incomes and better benefits than 
this bill would allow. That is the real 
irony here. 
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. CORREA), 
chair of the House Homeland Security 
Committee’s Subcommittee on Trans-
portation and Maritime Security. 
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Chairman, I rise in 
support of H.R. 1140, the Rights for 
Transportation Security Officers Act. 
Mr. Chair, I want to thank, again, 
Chairman THOMPSON for his leadership 
on this issue and bringing this bipar-
tisan piece of legislation to the floor 
that I am cosponsoring. 
Today, finally, we acknowledge that 
the TSA workers deserve a pay struc-
ture and personnel management sys-
tem that recognizes their value. These 
employees have had a higher turnover 
than the average Federal employee, 
and, in fact, many went unpaid during 
the government shutdown. 
These hardworking men and women 
are effectively the thin blue line that 
stands between us and our families 
while they are traveling by air and 
those who would do us harm by smug-
gling items onto planes through check-
points. That is what a TSA officer 
does: protect us and our families. 
We need to have professional TSA 
employees. We need to make sure that 
they are the best of the best. Our fam-
ily’s safety is worth it. 
As chairman of the Transportation 
and Maritime Security Subcommittee, 
I am proud to stand with these men 
and women of TSA in strong support of 
this legislation, and I urge all of my 
colleagues to vote ‘‘aye.’’ 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Chair, I appreciate my friend and 
colleague from California’s observa-
tion, but, again, I emphasize about the 
union representation. 
The gentleman just made the state-
ment and reiterated what the chairman 
had said in his opening statement, and 
that is there has been enormous turn-
over in the TSA over the last decade 
because of the poor pay, benefits, and 
working circumstances. 
The fact is that very few people who 
work at TSA today voted for AFGE to 
be the union. It won by plurality—not 
a majority—10 years ago, and very few 
people who were there then are here 
now. 
So, if, in fact, this bill were ever to 
become law—which it is not—at a min-
imum, we should allow the workers to 
decide who they want their representa-
tion to be. AFGE may win it, but it is 
wrong for Congress to dictate to 45,000 
employees who they should have for 
representation. 
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Chairman, just for the record, nothing 
in H.R. 1140 restricts the workforce’s 
ability to elect union representation. I 
want to be very clear on that. 
Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. 
JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I 
thank the gentleman from Mississippi 
for yielding. 
I want to thank the gentleman from 
Mississippi for his wisdom in putting 
forward a bill that is long overdue, and 
that is H.R. 1140, which is the Rights 
for Transportation Security Officers 
Act of 2020. 
Let me congratulate the storied or-
ganization AFGE. They have a stellar 
reputation for fairly representing gov-
ernment workers in a way that pro-
vides them a better quality of life. I am 
not sure why they have become the 
issue on this floor, and our chairman 
has just indicated that there is no such 
language that limits any actions by 
our TSO officers. 
Let me be very clear: Starting with 
the TSO and Homeland Security from 
the very beginning, this organizing was 
done for purposes of emergency. So 
now you have denied, for over 20 years, 
the rights of these individuals to live a 
decent life. 
I take issue with this one example of 
an individual who, obviously, was not 
managed, because we all know that a 
man does not examine a female pas-
senger, period, or traveler. We know 
that doesn’t happen. 
So a bad apple does not reflect on the 
fact that these workers need better 
rights, grievances, higher pay, profes-
sional development, and to be treated 
in the civil system such that we will 
develop a professional workforce that 
stays, that has a high morale and not a 
low morale. 
b 1415 
Are we doing this to the FBI, the De-
fense Department, and ATF? 
Are we telling them that at any mo-
ment they can be fired without due 
process? 
This doesn’t make sense. These peo-
ple have put their life on the line. They 
have stopped so much that you do not 
even know protecting the traveling 
public. 
Mr. Chairman, if you take a moment 
to talk with them, you will find out 
the massive number of weapons and 
other types of items that they have to 
be astute enough and keen enough to 
know what to do with. 
I support the TSA. I support TSOs be-
cause I see them every day as the front 
line for this Nation in providing a safe 
and secure aviation system. 
Yes, their job is difficult and deadly. 
We lost a gentleman in Los Angeles, 
and we all surrounded his family, he 
died in the line of duty. 
I believe this is an important legisla-
tive initiative. Let us take this and fi-
nally give to these workers the decency 
that they deserve. Let us not make ex-
cuses. Let us make it right, and let us 
stand with them as American workers 
and defenders of the security and free-
dom of this Nation. Support H.R. 1140. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Chairman, in response to my 
friend and colleague from Mississippi, 
who, in his last statements, empha-
sized that the employees at TSA would 
have the right to elect their union rep-
resentation, I would refer him to page 
9, line 24 of his bill, ‘‘Exclusive Rep-
resentative—The

This bill does pick winners and losers

I am just saying, I don’t think that is 
right. 
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Chairman, I yield myself such time as 
I may consume to say that I appreciate 
my colleague next door to me citing 
the section about Federal Labor Rela-
tions Authority because that is my ref-
erence. 
It says, ‘‘or successor labor organiza-
tion.’’ And it says in the ‘‘Sunset Pro-

shall cease to be effective as of the con-
version date.’’ 
So there are options available. It is 
not a closed-door process, and we 
wouldn’t have it that way anyway. 
Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. 
TITUS). 
Ms. TITUS. Mr. Chairman, I would 
like to thank our chairman for bring-
ing this bill and his leadership on this 
issue. 
I have the honor of representing Ne-
vada’s First Congressional District in 
the heart of Las Vegas. Every week, as 
I travel to and from Las Vegas through 
McCarran International Airport—just 
like more than 50 million travelers do 
each year—I see our TSA employees 
very hard at work screening pas-
sengers, baggage, and cargo. They play 
a critical role in allowing Las Vegas to 
be a truly international city with an 
economy that thrives on tourism and 
visitors who come to work, hike, and 
play. 
More broadly, Transportation Secu-
rity officers have the immense respon-
sibility of making sure passengers from 
all over the world, on hundreds of 
flights a day, make it safely to their 
destinations, wherever they may be. 
Yet, Federal law prohibits them from 
collectively bargaining for better pay, 
better benefits, and better working 
conditions. This shortcoming has led to 
a high level of turnover at TSA which 
threatens our security. 
It is time for that to change. That is 
why I strongly support this long over-
due piece of legislation that will im-
prove TSA agents’ pay and boost their 
collective bargaining power, not to 
mention their morale. 
So let’s come together today to give 
them the rights that other Federal em-
ployees have and that they so rightly 
deserve. Let’s respect them and give 
them this privilege so they can do what 
they do and keep us all safe. It is the 
least we can do to recognize that sac-
rifice. 
Mr. Chairman, I strongly support 
this bill, and I urge my colleagues to 
vote in favor of it. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
I would say to my friend from Nevada 
that the irony with this bill is they are 
moving TSA under a 70-year-old per-
sonnel 
management 
system 
widely 
panned by good government organiza-
tions as unable to meet the needs of 
the 21st century workforce. 
So which system really is outdated? 
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Chairman, I think, for the record, we 
want our TSOs to be treated just like 
all other Federal employees. If it is 
good enough for everybody else except 
TSA, then it should be good for TSA 
too. 
Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. 
WATSON COLEMAN). 
Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Chair-
man, I want to thank the gentleman 
for yielding to me, and I want to thank 
him for this leadership on this very im-
portant issue. 
I join him in calling for support and 
passage of the Transportation Security 
Officers Act. We rely on Transpor-
tation Security officers to keep us safe. 
They work hard, including going with-
out pay for more than 5 weeks during 
the last government shutdown. Yet 
these TSOs have none of the rights or 
the protections we have set for the rest 
of the Federal workforce, and that is 
what this bill would finally correct. 
H.R. 1140 offers TSOs the ability to 
organize themselves and fight for bet-
ter pay through collective bargaining 
and puts them on the Federal general 
schedule pay scale, ensuring they see 
the same regular step increases as the 
rest of the Federal workers who keep 
our government running. 
It would ensure TSOs can appeal per-
sonnel decisions to a neutral third 
party—something their managers and 
others within TSA can already do. It 
would give these workers the paid fam-
ily leave and medical leave that all 
other Federal workers now have, ensur-
ing they can care for an ailing parent, 
be home with a new baby, or deal with 
a new diagnosis. 
H.R. 1140 finally gives TSOs equal 
footing, recognizing that they are 
equally valued members of the Federal 
workforce—people we rely upon daily 
to keep our skies safe. 
I am grateful to our chairman, Mr. 
THOMPSON, for his work to bring this 
bill through committee and for his 
tireless efforts of workplace rights and 
protections for TSOs. 
Mr. Chairman, I urge the passage of 
this bill. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Chairman, the fact is, if we do 
treat the TSA officers the same as 
other employees by putting them in 
title 5, they will actually lose benefits. 
I talked about that in my opening 
statement. 
Right now, they already get the same 
benefits like paid family leave, but 
they are going to lose the ability to 
have bonuses, get certain overtime 
pay, and trade shifts. Those are things 
that are valuable. 
But the biggest problem I have is 
that we, as a Congress, have not funded 
the pay system they have now which 
would allow greater pay than title 5. I 
just think we need to stop shirking our 
duty and recognize it is our responsi-
bility to pay these employees fairly. 
We have not been doing that, and this 
bill will accommodate that. 
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr. PAYNE). 
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Chairman, first, let 
me commend the chairman of the 
Homeland Security Committee for this 
timely piece of legislation, this long- 
time coming piece of legislation. 
As has been stated, we fly home 
every week, and us being in Homeland 
Security, we interact with the TSOs on 
a regular basis. I don’t know what is 
going on in the gentleman from Ala-
bama’s airports, but these officers are 
really first responders who stand in the 
gap of whether we fly or travel safely 
every single day. 
They check thousands of bags for 
weapons that could be used to harm 
people flying or the pilots or the staff 
on airplanes, and we can’t give them a 
dignified wage, a living wage? 
I talk to them. Some of them have 
two jobs. 
Why should someone with such an 
important duty to keep our airways 
safe from terrorists and harm have to 
leave there and go work at Burger 
King? 
It is not right. I commend the gen-
tleman from Mississippi once again for 
this. 
These people need to be given the 
dignity that they deserve. They stand 
in the gap every single day, and not to 
pay them a commensurate salary with 
their job is criminal. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Chairman, my colleague from 
New Jersey is a great member of the 
Homeland Security Committee, and his 
heart is obviously in the right place. 
Everything he said I agree with about 
our TSA workforce. I travel through 
airports every week just like all the 
Members of this House. 
The fact is, it pains me to know we 
are not treating them better. These are 
the people who came to work in the 
last government shutdown without pay 
throughout that shutdown to make 
sure that we remained safe as we flew 
back and forth. 
We ought to be treating them better, 
and this bill doesn’t do it. If we want to 
treat these people the way they should 
be treated, we should use current law 
and properly fund it and give them pay 
and benefits better than anything this 
bill would ever accommodate. 
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Chairman, I have no more speakers, 
and I am prepared to close after the 
gentleman from Alabama closes. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield myself the balance of my 
time. 
I want to make Mr. THOMPSON aware 
that I have no further speakers and I 
am prepared to close. 
Mr. Chairman, I want to close by 
thanking the men and women of TSA. 
The debate we are having today does 
not impact the sincere appreciation we 
have for the tremendous job they do 
each and every day. While we may dis-
agree on the best way forward, I think 
we all share the same goal of improv-
ing screener pay and morale. We under-
stand how important it is to the work-
force and to our security.

H1489 
March 4, 2020 
Unfortunately, this bill would do lit-
tle more than undermine the goal that 
we seek to achieve. 
Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues 
to oppose the bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Chairman, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the argu-
ments my colleagues have made in 
favor of this bill as well as the amend-
ments offered to improve it. This is ul-
timately a simple bill with a simple 
but critical goal. 
Following the September 11 attack, 
Congress determined that the need to 
ensure the security of our Nation’s 
transportation systems required the 
creation of a new Federal agency, the 
TSA. 
Yet, in standing up this critical na-
tional security agency, Congress mis-
takenly gave TSA broad personnel au-
thority that has resulted in the work-
force lagging far behind other Federal 
workers with respect to pay, benefits, 
and rights. By passing this bill, we will 
finish the job we started and make 
TSA a Federal agency that follows the 
laws Congress had constructed over 
many decades to govern treatment of 
Federal employees. 
This is the right thing to do for the 
frontline workers, the right thing to do 
for the traveling public, and the right 
thing to do for our national security. 
Mr. Chair, I thank my colleagues for 
their support, I urge passage of H.R. 
1140, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
The CHAIR. All time for general de-
bate has expired. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Chair, I move that the Committee do 
now rise. 
The motion was agreed to. 
Accordingly, the Committee rose; 
and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. 
PAYNE) having assumed the chair, Mr. 
CUELLAR, Chair of the Committee of 
the Whole House on the state of the 
Union, reported that that Committee, 
having had under consideration the bill 
(H.R. 1140) to enhance the security op-
erations of the Transportation Secu-
rity Administration and stability of 
the transportation security workforce 
by 
applying 
the 
personnel 
system 
under title 5, United States Code, to 
employees of the Transportation Secu-
rity 
Administration 
who 
provide 
screening of all passengers and prop-
erty, and for other purposes, had come

CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL 
EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO 
ZIMBABWE—MESSAGE FROM THE 
PRESIDENT 
OF 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES (H. DOC. NO. 116–104) 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following message 
from the President of the United 
States; which was read and, together 
with the accompanying papers, referred 
to the Committee on Foreign Affairs 
and ordered to be printed: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides 
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90 
days before the anniversary date of its 
declaration, the President publishes in 
the Federal Register and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to 
the Federal Register for publication the 
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency declared in Executive 
Order 13288 of March 6, 2003, with re-
spect to the actions and policies of cer-
tain members of the Government of 
Zimbabwe and other persons to under-
mine Zimbabwe’s democratic processes 
or institutions is to continue in effect 
beyond March 6, 2020. 
In the wake of the resignation of 
former President Robert Mugabe in No-
vember 2017, Zimbabwe’s national elec-
tions in July 2018, and President 
Mugabe’s subsequent death in Sep-
tember 2019, Zimbabwe has had ample 
opportunity to implement reforms that 
could set the country on a constructive 
path, stabilize the southern African re-
gion, and open the door to greater co-
operation with the United States. Un-
fortunately, 
President 
Emmerson 
Mnangagwa’s administration has yet 
to signal credible political will to im-
plement such reforms. Indeed, the 
Zimbabwean government has arguably 
accelerated its persecution of critics 
and economic mismanagement in the 
past year, during which security forces 
have conducted extrajudicial killings, 
rapes, and alleged abductions of numer-
ous dissidents. 
These actions and policies by certain 
members 
of 
the 
Government 
of 
Zimbabwe and other persons to under-
mine Zimbabwe’s democratic processes 
or institutions continue to pose an un-
usual and extraordinary threat to the 
foreign policy of the United States. 
Therefore, I have determined that it is 
necessary to continue the national 
emergency declared in Executive Order 
13288 with respect to Zimbabwe.

United States, including in my own 
home county, and its death toll con-
tinues to grow. 
While the Trump administration has 
repeatedly demonstrated a failure to 
understand public health needs, Con-
gress is acting with the seriousness and 
the sense of urgency the coronavirus 
threat demands. 
This emergency supplemental is the 
product of thoughtful bipartisan co-
operation. It provides $8.3 billion in en-
tirely new funding to keep Americans 
safe, including: 
More than $3 billion for research and 
development of vaccines, therapeutics, 
and diagnostics; 
$300 million for the government to 
purchase vaccines at a fair and reason-
able price; 
$2.2 billion in public health funding 
for prevention, preparedness, and re-
sponse, of which $950 million is to sup-
port State and local health agencies; 
Nearly $1 billion for medical supplies, 
healthcare preparedness, community 
health centers, and medical surge ca-
pacity; 
$1.2 billion to address the coronavirus 
abroad, which helps keep Americans 
safe here at home; and 
Low-interest loans to affected small 
businesses to cushion the economic 
blow of this public health emergency. 
Finally, several other important pro-
visions have been included that will: 
allow seniors to access telemedicine 
services for coronavirus treatment, re-
quire the Trump administration to re-
imburse health accounts that were pre-
viously 
raided 
to 
pay 
for 
the 
coronavirus response, and ensure State 
and local governments are reimbursed 
for costs incurred while assisting the 
Federal response. 
Madam Speaker, strong funding in 
this legislation is a critical first step 
to enable a strategic, coordinated, and 
whole-of-government response to the 
coronavirus. 
While we all ardently hope that this 
public health emergency does not wors-
en, House Democrats will not hesitate 
to act again if we must augment this 
funding with more resources. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to join me in support of this 
legislation, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 6074, an emergency supple-
mental appropriations bill to fund the 
U.S. response to the coronavirus. 
When the news broke about this 
virus, the administration was able to 
respond 
immediately 
with 
reserve 
funds the Committee on Appropria-
tions created for the Department of 
Health and Human Services and the 
U.S. Agency for International Develop-
ment. These funds were championed by 
Republican leaders of our subcommit-
tees and had broad bipartisan support. 
It is my hope that the supplemental 
funding bill will receive the same level 
of cooperation. 
Madam Speaker, the bill before us 
today will allow the administration to 
continue its efforts to address the 
virus, both at home and abroad. Spe-
cifically, the bill includes funds for the 
development of broadly available test-
ing kits to diagnose those who may be 
infected, medicines to minimize the 
symptoms of the disease, and vaccines 
to prevent its spread. 
An overwhelming majority of our 
drug ingredients, pharmaceuticals, and 
medical 
devices 
are 
manufactured 
overseas. It is critical that we increase 
domestic drug production, increase the 
safety of the medical supply chain, and 
identify potential shortages. 
That is why this bill also includes 
funds for the Food and Drug Adminis-
tration to further ensure the safety 
and security of all Americans. The bill 
will also direct nearly $1 billion to 
State and local public health agencies 
on the front lines protecting our com-
munities. 
Finally, the bill protects American 
citizens abroad and helps prevent fur-
ther spread of coronavirus worldwide 
by providing just over $1 billion for the 
State Department and USAID. 
The Trump administration, through 
a task force led by Vice President 
PENCE, is doing what is required to re-
spond quickly to this ever-changing 
threat. We must give them the re-
sources they need. 
The health and safety of the Amer-
ican people is not, and never should be, 
a political issue. I urge all of my col-
leagues to join me in voting for the 
measure so that we can continue fight-
ing this virus and protecting our loved 
ones. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Kentucky (Mr. ROGERS), the former 
chairman of the full committee and the 
ranking member of the State, Foreign 
Operations, and Related Programs Sub-
committee. 
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of this bill, H.R. 6074. This 
coronavirus emergency supplemental, 
as has been said, provides $7.8 billion in 
additional appropriations for the U.S. 
response to coronavirus. 
Within the total, more than $2 billion 
is included for the Centers for Disease 
Control, and $1 billion is for State and 
local preparedness. The bill also pro-
vides more than $4 billion for research 
and 
development 
of 
vaccines, 
diagnostics, and therapeutics. 
As ranking member of the State, 
Foreign Operations, and Related Pro-
grams Subcommittee, I would also 
highlight the $1.25 billion in the bill for 
the State Department and the United 
States Agency for International Devel-
opment, AID. These funds will help 
protect Americans abroad and support 
efforts to contain the virus worldwide. 
Specifically, it includes: 
$264 million to maintain consular op-
erations, pay for evacuation expenses, 
and address other emergency prepared-
ness needs at our embassies and con-
sulates around the world; 
$435 million in global health funds, 
including $200 million for the emer-
gency reserve fund that we established 
in 2017 to address emerging health 
threats abroad; 
$300 million of international disaster 
assistance funding to respond to hu-
manitarian needs related to the virus; 
$250 million for economic and secu-
rity needs in countries facing insta-
bility because of the virus; and 
$1 million for the USAID inspector 
general 
to 
perform 
oversight 
of 
coronavirus response activities. 
The bill also requires a comprehen-
sive 
strategy 
to 
respond 
to 
the 
coronavirus overseas and regular re-
porting on the use of the funds so that 
we know how the moneys are being 
spent. 
Madam Speaker, this is a good bill. 
The resources are needed urgently, and 
I urge our colleagues to vote ‘‘aye.’’ 
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Michigan (Mr. UPTON). 
Mr. UPTON. Madam Speaker, this 
legislation is how this place is sup-
posed to work—real substance, forget 
the politics. 
We have an emergency. We really do. 
And I thank the leadership on both 
sides of the aisle for bringing this bill 
to the floor so quickly. 
The bipartisan Problem Solvers Cau-
cus met for an hour just yesterday at 
the White House to promise to work to-
gether, not only with the administra-
tion, but with Republicans and Demo-
crats, House and Senate. Many of us, 
the last couple of weeks, have met with 
the HHS Secretary, CDC, FDA, NIH, as 
well as with our health leaders in our 
States. 
This money is not only going to help 
our health officials on the front lines; 
it is going to help our families in vir-
tually every community. It is also 
going to help develop the vaccine and 
the therapeutics to save perhaps tens 
of thousands of lives. 
The 21st Century Cures legislation 
that most of us supported 3 years ago 
has laid the foundation to expedite the 
cures for so many illnesses, including 
this one. This is a moment in time 
when we need to step up for the safety 
of our families, our communities, and 
our Nation. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this money that is 
so desperately needed and get it to the 
President as quickly as we can. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, the 
government’s greatest responsibility is 
to keep Americans safe. This emer-
gency 
supplemental

coronavirus and takes critical steps to 
protect the American people from this 
deadly and expanding outbreak. 
I urge my colleagues to vote for this 
critical assistance, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. 
LOWEY) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6074. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this motion will be post-
poned. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
support of this Supplemental bill, which will 
provide $7.8 billion for our country to prepare 
for, prevent, and respond to the coronavirus. 
Congress thankfully began preparing for 
public health emergencies like the coronavirus 
five years ago, by including generous in-
creases for the National Institutes of Health, 
the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion and the Strategic National Stockpile. 
Beyond that, in 2018 this Congress estab-
lished the Infectious Disease Rapid Response 
Reserve Fund, which enabled our Administra-
tion and public health officials to direct a swift 
and decisive response to protect our citizens 
from day one. 
The funding provided in this Supplemental 
bill will further target resources to state and 
local health officials. It will enable the govern-
ment to procure medical supplies to supple-
ment the Strategic National Stockpile. It will 
provide over $800 million for research into a 
vaccine, and provide additional funds to de-
velop medicines, diagnostic tests, and aid in 
hospital preparedness. 
The bill also includes language waiving cer-
tain telehealth requirements during this time to 
ensure Medicare beneficiaries can receive the 
care they need at home to avoid placing them-
selves at greater risk of the virus. 
I’m glad we were able to come together in 
a bipartisan fashion to speed these funds to 
where they are needed. 
Mr. BUCHANAN. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of this Emergency Supple-
mental bill. I commend the bipartisan leader-
ship of the Appropriations Committee for 
bringing this critically needed bill to the floor 
so quickly. 
Time is of the essence for my constituents. 
Why? Because in my District, we already have 
3 confirmed cases of Coronavirus. 
I just finished 2 days of in-depth meetings 
with front-line medical experts at both the Doc-
tors Hospital and Sarasota Memorial Hospital. 
The message I have today for my col-
leagues in the House is crystal clear. We need 
to dramatically ramp-up the supply of test kits, 
increase the number of locations where peo-
ple exhibiting symptoms can easily get tested, 
and accelerate the process of getting results 
back—hopefully in less than 24 hours. 
It is imperative that Congress quickly pass 
this bill so that key state and local public 
health agencies and officials, who are on the 
front-line of this pandemic get all of the re-
sources they need. This will help them to iden-
tify potential patients and treat confirmed pa-
tients while working to keep everyone else 
safe from further exposure to this dangerous 
viral agent. 
Today is no time for partisan games. 
Congress should rise to the occasion by 
working together to approve this bill so that 
President Trump can sign it into law and pro-
vide vital funds and assistance to my part of 
southwest Florida and the rest of the Nation. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
support of this legislation. Aside from the pub-
lic health impact, this outbreak also threatens 
grave economic damage. Already, economists 
have lowered global forecasts with the dim-
mest outlooks predicting a fall from nearly 3 
percent to just 1 percent growth due to the un-
certainty and disruptions inflicted by the virus. 
Small firms, in particular, can expect hard-
ship from this public health crisis. From the 
local barber shop or neighborhood cafe to the 
innovative technology startup, a pandemic can 
mean fewer customers, supply chain disrup-
tion, and workforce reductions. 
As the coronavirus spreads, so, too does 
misinformation and alarm. Because of stigma 
and xenophobia, many Chinatown restaurants 
and stores in my city of New York were al-
ready feeling economic pain before even one 
person in the city tested positive for the virus. 
Merchants in Chinatown have reported sales 
drops as high as 80 percent. 
Provisions in this bill would mean all small 
businesses harmed by the virus could apply 
for emergency loans, with low interest rates, to 
help them meet financial obligations. Just as 
the SBA helps small firms get back on their 
feet after a hurricane, wildfire or earthquake, 
the agency can be critical to helping local 
economies recover from this public health cri-
sis. 
I want to thank Speaker PELOSI and Chair-
woman LOWEY for working to include these 
provisions, which are modeled on legislation I 
introduced late last week. I encourage a yes 
vote.

RECESS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair

Accordingly (at 2 o’clock and 45 min-
utes p.m.), the House stood in recess.

RECOGNIZING BERTA CACERES 
(Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, today indigenous environmental ac-
tivist, Berta Caceres, would have been 
49 years old, but on March 2, 2016, she 
was viciously murdered in her own 
home by a coordinated effort between 
greedy 
corporate 
and 
government 
thugs. 
She died defending the land of the 
Lenca indigenous people. Berta, along 
with countless other Honduran activ-
ists, was the victim of a government 
wracked with corruption and impunity. 
Drug traffickers have littered the high-
est ranks of Honduras’ Government, 
and its military remains weaponized 
against its own people, all of whom are 
targets of victimization by this govern-
ment, which is aided by U.S. security 
assistance. We turn away our brothers 
and sisters at the border, but we abet 
the very crimes they are fleeing. 
Berta Caceras’ legacy should serve to 
remind us of this, and enough is 
enough.

RECOGNIZING LAURA RANDOLPH 
STEVENS DEVENDORF 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to remember and honor 
the life of Mrs. Laura Randolph Ste-
vens Devendorf. 
Born in Savannah in Georgia’s First 
Congressional District, Laura was a 
fearless advocate, a talented artist, and 
dedicated writer who used her gifts for 
the betterment of others. 
Laura was an extraordinarily gifted 
designer. In fact, during the Atlanta 
Olympic Games, she served as assistant 
course designer, the first women in 
Olympic history to be so honored. 
She was also a dedicated environ-
mentalist and preservationist. In her 
late sixties, she became a certified 
Master 
Tree 
Farmer 
and 
Master 
Wildlifer and was an instructor for the 
University of Georgia’s Master Natu-
ralist Program in forestry and salt 
marsh ecology. 
She served on numerous boards, in-
cluding the Georgia Forestry Associa-
tion. In fact, in 2000, she was named 
Georgia’s Tree Farmer of the Year. 
I was blessed to meet Miss Laura, so 
I can attest to her empathy, her intel-
lect, creativity, courage, and compas-
sion. She was a pillar in Savannah, and 
her legacy will live on. 
Laura’s family and friends will be in 
my thoughts and prayers during this 
most difficult time. 
HOUR OF MEETING ON TOMORROW 
Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent that when the House ad-
journs today, it adjourn to meet at 9 
a.m. tomorrow. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois). Is there ob-
jection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection.

IMPRISONMENT OF SAUDI WOMEN 
ACTIVISTS 
(Ms. WILD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to 
recognize 
three 
extraordinary 
women: Nouf Abdulaziz, Loujain Al- 
Hathloul, and Eman Al-Nafjan. 
For nearly 2 years, these women have 
been imprisoned, placed in solitary 
confinement, and tortured by the Saudi 
Government, all because they used 
their voices to express the need for the 
government to recognize the funda-
mental rights and dignity of women. 
Under Saudi Arabia’s male guardian-
ship system, which requires women to 
obtain permission of their male guard-
ians in healthcare, employment, and 
travel decisions, the very notion of 
women’s rights or, for that matter, 
human 
rights, 
is 
effectively 
non-
existent. 
Despite the Saudi Government’s re-
cent claims of social reform, an unac-
ceptably oppressive status quo con-
tinues to dominate virtually every as-
pect of life for women in Saudi Arabia. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me as a cosponsor of H. Res. 129, a 
resolution which calls for the imme-
diate release of these activists and 
calls on the administration to impose 
sanctions on Saudi officials responsible 
for human rights violations. 
Let us come together, Democrats and 
Republicans alike, in demanding the 
release of these courageous women.

CONGRATULATING THE WEST VAL-
LEY GIRLS BASKETBALL TEAM 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, this 
past Saturday, the West Valley girls 
basketball team had a come-from-be-
hind win to win the Northern Section 
Division IV championship in northern 
California. 
After going 23–8 in the regular sea-
son, West Valley shut out their oppo-
nent in the fourth quarter to pull out a 
29–26 victory. 
After trailing 24–17 in the third quar-
ter, Hannah Wayne scored seven of the 
next eight points for the Eagles, cre-
ating a momentum that allowed the 
Eagles to keep the lead for good. 
Madalynn 
Bassett 
scored 
eight 
points, along with Hannah Wayne, for 
lead scorer of the game. 
Congratulations on the win to the 
West Valley Eagles, and head coach, 
Lenny Ehn. Good luck in the play-offs 
for the State championship, we will be 
rooting for you.

CLERMONT 
NATIVE 
EARNS 
NA-
TIONAL ATHLETIC RECOGNITION 
(Mr. SPANO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, today I 
rise to recognize Clermont, Florida, na-
tive Diane Travis, who exemplifies the 
type of citizen who puts community 
above self. 
Ms. Travis serves as a councilwoman, 
small business owner, and most re-
cently was named as a finalist for the 
Anne Viviani Women’s Great Grand 
Masters Duathlete of the Year. As a 
duathlete who runs, bikes, and then 
runs again, she truly exhibits tremen-
dous 
perseverance, 
discipline, 
and 
strength of character. 
Even more noteworthy is the fact 
that she dedicates each race to her 
friend, Anne Viviani, whom this award 
is named after, and who sadly lost her 
life in a car accident returning home 
from a competition. 
Being recognized as a finalist for 
Duathlete of the Year reflects the 
great success Ms. Travis has displayed 
in past competitions, including being 
the 2019 champion in her age group at 
the Women’s USA Nationals, and then 
capturing the silver medal at the world 
competition. 
Mr. Speaker, I wish Councilwoman 
Travis the best of luck moving forward 
as a finalist and in all future competi-
tions. I know she will continue to 
make Clermont, the 15th Congressional 
District, and our country proud.

SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE 
THOUGHT EXPERIMENT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. SCHWEIKERT) is recognized 
for 60 minutes as the designee of the 
minority leader. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, we 
are going to actually try to touch on 3 
or 4 different things this evening, and I 
am going to try to make it all sort of 
connect together. 
On a personal level, I was very 
pleased as we were doing the supple-
mental and the mechanism in regard to 
the coronavirus, a little widget of that 
was actually the telemedicine piece of 
legislation that I believe Mr. THOMPSON 
from the Ways and Means Committee 
and myself have offered. It is always 
nice to see some of these ideas you 
have been working on getting lifted up 
and moved forward. 
But this evening I actually want to 
sort of continue to talk about science, 
and the fact of the matter is, the im-
pact it can have if we actually think 
forward on functionally our debt, our

March 4, 2020 
deficits, and our ability to keep our 
promises. 
You know, I have been behind this 
mic dozens and dozens of times with 
my little boards, trying to demonstrate 
that over the next 30 years, functioning 
Social Security and Medicare, these 
are earned benefits, but they also are 
the primary drivers of U.S. debt. It is 
almost all of it. And a lot of it is just 
demographics, we are getting older as a 
society, and most of it is actually 
Medicare, it is healthcare costs. 
And it turns out that there are op-
portunities that, if we can embrace 
technology to actually disrupt some of 
those healthcare costs—and at the end, 
we always sort of talk about we need to 
grow the economy, we need tax policy, 
we need immigration policy, we need 
regulatory policy, we need incentives 
for labor force participation, there are 
all these things that make the econ-
omy grow so we have the resources, the 
receipts, revenues, tax revenues, and 
other things, to actually keep our 
promises. But one of the other things 
we could do is also disrupt the price of 
healthcare. 
So just as a thought experiment, ex-
cept it is actually based in the living 
math—this slide is a little hard to deal 
with—but think of this, over the next 
30 years—and this isn’t adjusted for in-
flation—but over the next 30 years, if 
you were to remove Social Security 
and Medicare, you would have $23 tril-
lion in the bank. 
If you roll Social Security and Medi-
care back, you are $103 trillion in debt, 
and it is mostly Medicare, it is mostly 
healthcare costs. Well, 30 percent of 
that healthcare cost is just diabetes— 
and that is what this slide is sort of 
walking through—diagnosed, the indi-
viduals we know about, those we are 
expecting to come in the future years, 
and the cost curve. 
The fact of the matter is, our invest-
ments, our ability to build policy that 
gets us to solutions for diabetes—and 
diabetes is complicated, you know, 
there are autoimmune issues, there are 
lifestyle issues, some are just some ge-
netic issues. It is complicated. 
b 1700 
But understand just curing diabetes 
would be 30 percent of the Medicare 
costs we are projecting over the next 30 
years. It is a demonstration, when we 
can get the incentives here correct, to 
push science for these little labs, for 
these really smart universities that ac-
tually will break off something and go 
set up and raise capital and do these 
high-risk experiments to produce dis-
ruptions, cures, how important that is 
actually to our society today but also 
into the future. Because if those little 
biologic labs can produce a cure, can 
produce new therapeutics, and change 
this cost curve, they also change the 
projection of U.S. economics, U.S. debt. 
I am trying to build an under-
standing here. So think about what we 
just did on the floor. We just moved 
eight-billion-something dollars work-
ing through the coronavirus, making 
sure there are supplementals and all 
these other things, and we also have 
had briefings, even earlier today, of 
some of the small labs and Big Pharma 
and little pharma that are desperately 
working to produce vaccines to also 
new therapeutics, antivirals. 
Yet, this same body in December 
moved a piece of legislation through 
here that would functionally crush, 
would functionally put those small bio-
logic innovators out of business. It 
would destroy what is often called the 
‘‘capital stack,’’ the ability to raise 
money for high-risk therapeutics that 
most of the time fail. 
If we care about drug prices, which 
both the Republican side and the Dem-
ocrat side all focus on, can we make 
sure that, if you are going to move a 
bill like they did, H.R. 3, that—func-
tionally you are going to get some 
price efficiency here, but you are going 
to wipe out the very innovation and 
the very biologics and small pharmas 
that we are relying on right now to 
produce some of the very disruptions 
for what is going on in the world right 
now. 
Understand, we have to be so careful 
that we don’t satiate our current polit-
ical desire—and it is a real one, to deal 
with the cost of pharmaceuticals—and 
end up destroying future innovation 
that will save lives, but also make sure 
we have the infrastructure for when we 
take on something like we are right 
now with the virus around the world. 
It turns out one of our greatest debt 
drivers is diabetes. It is 30 percent of 
the cost of Medicare over the next 30 
years. 
So why show this board? 
Just a couple days ago, I came across 
a series of articles talking about an-
other example of a miracle that science 
is bringing us. 
This is a mouse experiment. And tra-
ditionally when you see a mouse exper-
iment, we are still a decade away from 
the therapeutic. But this should be 
stunningly hopeful. They functionally 
found a way to put in living cells that 
associate as a pancreatic cell—and this 
just comes from reading three or four 
articles in some of the science jour-
nals—that produced insulin in this 
mouse experiment. 
Is this the beginning of a therapeutic 
that is either a cure for part of the dia-
betic population, or a substantial por-
tion of it, that also happens to have 
the economic benefit of dramatically 
changing the cost curve of healthcare, 
dramatically changing the cost curve 
of Medicare and Medicaid and so many 
other things? 
As we sit here and talk about every-
thing from conversations around the 
coronavirus to debt and deficits, under-
stand if the primary driver of our defi-
cits are functioning healthcare costs— 
and really it is actually our demo-
graphics; we have 74 million of us who 
are baby boomers, and we are moving 
into our benefit years—how do we build 
policy around here that says this is po-
tentially a miracle? 
If we can make this miracle work for 
our brothers and sisters across the 
country, how do we incentivize invest-
ment in this type of technology that 
not only may partially or substantially 
cure diabetes, but it also solves one of 
our greatest debt problems in the fu-
ture? This is actually the sort of thing 
Republicans and Democrats should be 
embracing and the policy and ideas to 
move capital, to move incentives to 
make this work. 
If this body is going to even have a 
discussion saying, hey, the world eco-
nomics are going to slow down for a lit-
tle while because of what is going on 
and we want to do some stimuli; talk 
about doing stimuli that actually isn’t 
just a momentary change, but actually 
would change our future debt curve be-
cause it provides cures for our brothers 
and sisters with diabetes, a chronic 
condition that is 30 percent of just 
Medicare’s future spending. 
I am asking us to think not only 
strategically and creatively, but also 
incentivize the very science that actu-
ally helps change our future. And it is 
here. This is really exciting stuff. 
You know, you hope and pray that 
the continuation of the experiments 
and the science continue to go in this 
direction, this is a big deal. And it is 
not only a big deal from a science 
standpoint for our brothers and sisters 
with diabetes, but even from debt and 
deficits. It turns out you really can ac-
tually have that holistic circle come 
together if we can get our policies 
right around here. 
So another thing we spend a lot of 
time on is talking about energy policy. 
How do you deal with everything from 
the issues of greenhouse gases and how 
dysfunctional our actual policies are 
here? 
And I don’t mean to get snarky, but 
on one hand people get behind these 
microphones, and we give these beau-
tiful speeches about how much we care. 
And then we look the other way when 
the actual things are going on in our 
economy are actually making things 
worse. 
And let me give my example. Part of 
the thought experiment is to under-
stand—do you see this multicolored 
layer? That is nuclear generation that 
is coming off-line. This is a 2017 slide. 
If you could see the slide—which it is 
very colorful—you would notice it is 
substantially taller than the yellow 
side. The yellow side is photovoltaic. 
I am from Arizona. I love solar. It is 
wonderful. But I also realize nuclear 
power provides this amazing baseload 
that is really clean. And we have actu-
ally been here and shown that. 
There is a gentleman with a Nobel 
Prize that wrote an article a few 
months ago thinking that in about 10 
years they will actually have a way to 
break down nuclear waste with a type 
of pulse laser. The physics on that are 
a little beyond me, but this is sort of 
the point. 
So we get our policy wrong on trying 
to keep our nuclear generation up and

March 4, 2020 
running, and then we run around giddy 
that we have had so much photovoltaic 
hit the market, but you do realize what 
the slide is telling you? We actually 
went backwards, because that differen-
tial had to be made up by other types 
of power generation. We fell backwards 
because we didn’t find ways to keep 
this nuclear power in production. 
If we are going to talk about things, 
I just desperately wish we would get 
our math right. 
Another thing, this one is optimistic, 
and this one actually is touching on a 
piece of legislation from Ways and 
Means. It is a bipartisan number of Re-
publicans and Democrats trying to 
push an all-of-the-above-type of model. 
For those of us in the desert southwest 
in the afternoons we produce a lot of 
photovoltaic power, solar power. And 
then the Sun goes down and we are 
still running our air conditioners. 
We actually have incentives for solar, 
for wind. Why wouldn’t you actually 
design something that is a little more 
egalitarian in understanding the tech-
nology? And this charge is about bat-
teries. And what is really amazing here 
is—see if I can bend over and read this 
line—battery prices have had an 85 per-
cent fall in price per density in the last 
decade. When you see that curve going 
down, those little black lines, that is 
actually the falling price of battery 
storage. 
Well, if you are going to have in the 
tax code an incentive for wind genera-
tion 
and 
solar 
generation, 
why 
wouldn’t you have it, also, for battery 
storage? Why wouldn’t you have it for 
a type of technology that we haven’t 
even thought of that some freaky 
smart person is working on in their 
basement or their garage or in a fancy 
lab right now that they may be about 
to bring out? 
So I am going to encourage Members 
to think about that as we are working 
on some of these packages, and it is 
often referred to as extenders and those 
issues. Why don’t we get this right and 
incentivize those things that actually 
are the next disruption? Because for us 
in the desert southwest, incentivizing 
that power storage actually creates the 
mechanisms of photovoltaic and other 
types of generation and smooths it out 
so it actually works for us. So, please, 
for anyone that is listening, let’s pay 
attention to that tax legislation. 
The other one I want to touch on is 
another piece of legislation I am spon-
soring and working on. 
A couple years ago, we passed some-
thing called Q45. No one knows what 
Q45 is, but it is actually really impor-
tant. It was everything in the tax re-
form data spot. It is the concept of a 
tax credit for capturing carbon. And 
then the other part of it for seques-
tering it or using it in other fashions. 
Wonderful. 
We have a piece of legislation to take 
that and make it permanent because, 
as we have learned, the capital expend-
itures for the technology to be on top 
of a smokestack or even the ambient 
air capture where it is on top of a 
building and it is just pulling carbon 
right out of the air, those sometimes 
are very large capital expenditures. 
They need a longer time to amortize 
out their costs. 
Well, it also turns out there are dis-
ruptions in that technology. This is a 
clip from an article back, oh, let’s say, 
last October, and anyone that is track-
ing this just basically grab your phone, 
go to your search engine, and search 
‘‘MIT ambient carbon capture.’’ They 
actually even have a little video to 
show you how it works. 
What the researchers say on this 
technology is overnight they may have 
just cut the cost in half. Cut the cost 
in half for functioning, just pulling car-
bon right out of the air, let alone on 
top of a smokestack. 
So it turns out that the technology 
of carbon capture and then the abil-
ity—if we could fix some of what we 
call that Q45, that tax credit that is al-
ready on the books, we are just trying 
to work out its timing—for seques-
tering that carbon in concrete or using 
it for enhanced oil recovery or—a cou-
ple researchers have been in our office 
and talked about—they can take that 
pure carbon with a little bit of a chem-
ical treatment and turn it back into a 
clean burning hydrocarbon fuel. The 
technology is here. 
How do you ever take a body like 
this, where you have a lot of smart 
people, but we have lots of different 
specialties, and keep up to date with 
the fact that we live in a time of mir-
acles? And if you are one of the people 
who truly cares about greenhouse 
gases, carbon in the atmosphere, then 
you also have the obligation to keep 
track of the disruption in technology 
because I will make you the argument, 
if the underlying math in the article 
behind this MIT carbon capture is true, 
it is a miracle, they may have cut the 
costs of capturing in half. 
So another one, and this has just 
been a project of mine for almost 5 
years here. I can walk through the con-
cept, and I actually even have a 
YouTube video. I think if you search 
‘‘Schweikert 
environmental 
crowdsourcing,’’ I have a 90-second 
YouTube video trying to explain this 
concept. 
We all walk around with these super 
computers in our pockets. We call 
them a smartphone. What would hap-
pen in your community if you had a 
couple thousand people in your com-
munity that had these new little sen-
sors that have hit the market? They 
are here, they are now. And you can be 
driving around, it could be your Uber 
driver, your Lyft driver, your UPS 
driver, the person driving the kids to 
soccer practice and every few minutes 
it is taking a sample as you go through 
the neighborhoods. You would actually 
have 
crowdsourced 
environmental 
data. Because today, what we do is we 
put up these towers, and those towers 
cost about a million dollars a year just 
to maintain, but they lack so much of 
the community information you actu-
ally need. And I will get to my punch-
line here where this makes sense. 
How do you know that the business 
over here is a good camper, but the 
folks down the street are painting cars 
in their backyard? Well, the fixed 
tower never tells you that. If you actu-
ally have a crowdsourced model of col-
lecting air quality samples, you know 
the business is a good actor over here, 
but you have clowns over here break-
ing the law. Capture them. 
It turns out if you built an air qual-
ity crowdsourcing model in your com-
munity—the world we have today, 
where you fill out lots of paperwork, 
then shove it in file cabinets, do the 
papers and file cabinets actually make 
the air quality cleaner in your neigh-
borhood? Of course not. It is a 1938 reg-
ulatory model. We document things, 
and then when someone screws up, we 
know who to sue. 
b 1715 
I will make you the argument that if 
you could crowdsource air quality sam-
ples in your neighborhood, you don’t 
need the businesses or the others who 
are licensed today to fill out paperwork 
every quarter, every 6 months, every 
year, because if they screw up, you cap-
ture them immediately. 
Think about it. You could crash the 
bureaucracy. You could crash filling 
out paperwork to shove in file cabinets 
and keep the air quality much, much 
healthier because you capture when 
there is a bad actor or when something 
has gone wrong. And you capture it in-
stantly. 
That community science, that citizen 
science, that crowdsourcing is here. It 
turns out that lots of smart people 
around the country are now producing 
products that will let you do this. 
I am ordering a couple different ones, 
but this is one version we pulled off the 
internet just the other day. What they 
are trying to point to here is that this 
is how we do it today. We put up a sin-
gle tower. It costs a million dollars a 
year. The technology is great. It has 
great sensitivity, but it doesn’t tell 
you where the bad actor is. 
In a crowdsource model, you in-
stantly find out where the bad actor is. 
In my State, in my county, Maricopa 
County Air Quality, instead of them 
being collectors of paperwork, they 
would have the data come in. They 
could see it on the heat map and imme-
diately know where to go take a look 
to see if there is something wrong hap-
pening. 
I am trying to make the argument— 
do you remember what I was saying 
earlier?—that we have to grow the 
economy rather vigorously to be able 
to have the resources to keep our 
promises. One of the things on that 
list, besides a tax policy that works 
and an immigration policy, was a regu-
latory policy. 
I have never been thrilled when peo-
ple walk around and use the term: ‘‘Oh, 
we are going to deregulate.’’ I beg of

March 4, 2020 
you to think about ‘‘smart regula-
tions.’’ 
This requires a dramatically smaller 
bureaucracy, dramatically less burden 
on those who are creating productive 
capacity in our communities, yet it 
would keep us healthier and would 
show us where the bad actors are. 
I beg of this body, think forward. We 
keep designing pieces of legislation 
around here that might have been bril-
liant if it was still the 1980s or early 
1990s. How do we push the way we 
think of everything, from the environ-
ment to environmental protection all 
the way down to creating the next gen-
eration of pharmaceuticals that cure 
us? 
I truly believe we live in a time of 
miracles. I also believe that our inabil-
ity to be forward-thinking in this body 
is one of the biggest problems we have 
in these sorts of technologies reaching 
our communities. 
We always start with this slide, be-
cause, one more time: What is the 
greatest fragility, long term, to this 
country? I am going to argue it is debt, 
but that debt is driven by our demo-
graphics. 
Our birth rates have collapsed over 
the last couple of decades, particularly 
these last few years. There is a large 
number of us who are baby boomers; we 
have our earned benefits coming to us. 
If you look at the debt accumulation 
that is about to happen, it is stunning. 
How do we build a path that makes it 
so that we can keep our promises and 
still have a growing economy so that 
my 4-year-old daughter has the same 
opportunities I have had? 
My brothers and sisters on the left 
will often come up with: ‘‘Well, we will 
tax rich people.’’ My brothers and sis-
ters on the right will often say: ‘‘Well, 
we are going to find waste and fraud.’’ 
You do realize that is mathematical 
lunacy? None of that works mathe-
matically. 
You have to grow the economy. You 
have to have a disruption in healthcare 
prices. You have to have a disruption 
of how you incentivize people to stay 
in the labor force. 
That is why we put up this slide, be-
cause we believe there are these five 
pillars that if we get the economic 
growth; the labor force participation; 
the adoption of disruptive technology; 
the population stability of encouraging 
family formation; and if you are going 
to change the immigration system, you 
actually incentivize more of a talent- 
based immigration system, because 
you need the economic velocity. 
Now, a lot of this is really politically 
uncomfortable. I mean, some of these 
things, when you go talk about it, peo-
ple get really mad because they are not 
comfortable with it. But it is almost 
the only way, at least in our little of-
fice, that we have been able to build a 
model that we can have enough eco-
nomic growth, enough tax revenues, 
enough change in the price of what our 
promises are that we end up having a 
pretty amazing future as a country. 
How do you ever get a body like this, 
where you have lots of smart people, to 
act when a lot of what we know is long 
since out of date and when the math is 
really, really uncomfortable to deal 
with and talk about? When you show 
up in front of an audience at home and 
say, ‘‘You do understand the biggest 
driver of debt is Medicare?’’ you will 
get booed, hissed at. But you need to 
understand, if you don’t talk about it, 
how do you save it? 
Remember, the Medicare trust fund, 
which is the part A, has only a few 
years left, and then it is gone. 
We need to step up, both Democrats 
and Republicans, and start telling the 
truth about the math, maybe invest in 
that crazy thing called a calculator 
and start to build a model of how we 
disrupt the prices, how we grow the 
economy, how we create the velocity 
that makes this work and provides 
hope and opportunity. 
My thesis is very, very simple: It is 
here. There is a way to do it. And the 
biggest barrier to it happening is this 
body here. We need to change the way 
we look at the disruption of tech-
nology. 
The last one I will give you is just 
this simple example. I have come to 
the floor multiple times and sort of 
done a thought experiment: the tech-
nology of something that looks like a 
large kazoo that you can blow into and 
instantly tells you that you have the 
flu, that instantly can bounce off your 
medical records on your phone, that 
knows you are not allergic to a certain 
antiviral, 
and 
that 
orders 
your 
antivirals. 
Isn’t that wonderful? Think about 
just the cost disruption that tech-
nology would have, particularly with 
what is going on right now. 
It turns out that technology exists, 
yet the professor who was working on 
it had incredible difficulties raising 
capital, being able to get investors to 
move it forward. You know why? Be-
cause it is functionally illegal. It 
would save lots of money, but the algo-
rithm for being allowed to write a pre-
scription is functionally illegal. It is il-
legal under State licensing laws, the 
Social Security Act, the way we reim-
burse. 
We need to become much more for-
ward-thinking because it is the way we 
save ourselves. If we stay the way we 
are, we do nothing but bathe in debt 
and stagnation. 
But there is a path. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

CALL FOR REPRODUCTIVE 
JUSTICE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentlewoman from 
Massachusetts (Ms. PRESSLEY) is recog-
nized for 60 minutes as the designee of 
the majority leader. 
Ms. 
PRESSLEY. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank my dear friend and sister in 
service, 
Representative 
TLAIB, 
for 
cohosting this special session with me 
this evening to discuss the critical 
issue of reproductive justice in our 
country. 
As chair of the Abortion Rights and 
Access Task Force in this first-ever 
pro-choice majority Congress, I am 
proud to join my colleagues tonight as 
we stand up and push back against 
these unprecedented, coordinated at-
tacks on our collective reproductive 
rights and liberties. 
You see, Mr. Speaker, the stakes 
could not be any higher. Since 2011, 
anti-choice politicians have pushed a 
wave of nearly 450 restrictive laws 
through State legislatures and now all 
the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
Over the last year alone, they have en-
acted 25 bans across dozens of States, 
pushing 
comprehensive 
reproductive 
healthcare, including abortion care, 
further and further out of reach. 
They are working overtime to peddle 
harmful misconceptions and to legis-
late abortion out of existence. 
As a result, reproductive health fa-
cilities have been forced to shut their 
doors, forcing individuals to travel 
across State lines, shoulder additional 
financial burdens, and jump through 
unnecessary and humiliating hoops 
just to access comprehensive care.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1500 
March 4, 2020 
Just this morning, I, along with sev-
eral of my House colleagues, marched 
to the Supreme Court to stand in soli-
darity with the justice warriors who 
are on the front lines, fighting for our 
collective humanity because, today, 
the Supreme Court begins deliberations 
on the constitutionality of a Louisiana 
State law that, if upheld by the Court, 
would literally shut down every abor-
tion clinic across the State except for 
one. 
To put this further into perspective, 
Mr. Speaker, this could leave just one 
doctor to provide abortion care for 
nearly 1 million individuals of repro-
ductive age across the entire State. 
If Louisiana’s clinic shutdown law 
takes effect, it will not only decimate 
abortion access in Louisiana, but it 
will further embolden State legisla-
tures around the country to do the 
same. 
Additionally, this law is literally 
identical to the Texas law struck down 
by the Court just 3 years ago in the 
Whole Woman’s Health case. 
Since the Texas case, the facts cer-
tainly haven’t changed. The precedent 
certainly hasn’t changed. The only 
thing that has changed is the makeup 
of the Supreme Court, a court that is 
now filled with judges who want to 
strip us of our bodily autonomy. 
Laws that restrict reproductive free-
dom undermine the very nature of 
equality and disproportionately harm 
the most vulnerable among us. 
Every person, every individual, re-
gardless of income, sexual orientation, 
or gender identity, deserves equitable 
access to comprehensive reproductive 
healthcare, including queer, trans, and 
nonbinary individuals. As I often say, 
people don’t live in checked boxes; we 
live in nuance and intersectionality. 
Abortion is healthcare. Reproductive 
justice is economic justice. Reproduc-
tive justice is racial justice. 
Mr. Speaker, the stakes are high. Our 
fundamental human rights and lib-
erties are not and should not be up for 
debate. 
b 1730 
I am proud to stand here on the floor 
today to remind the courts that Roe v. 
Wade is still the law of the land and 
that the days of the Hyde amendment 
are numbered and that we stand with 
our partners in community, the orga-
nizers and resisters who are fighting 
day in and day out to ensure that every 
person has the right to self-determina-
tion over their reproductive health. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE FOR 
WOMEN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Ms. TLAIB) is recognized for 
the remainder of the hour as the des-
ignee of the majority leader. 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, today’s 
Special Order is a call for reproductive 
justice for women, those who can be-
come pregnant and families every-
where who believe, as I do, that repro-
ductive rights are a human right. 
This Special Order hour comes as the 
Supreme Court, today, considers yet 
another attack on our right as women 
and those who can become pregnant to 
determine what we do with our own 
bodies. Worse, it comes less than a 
month after Senate Majority Leader 
MCCONNELL’s thankfully failed attempt 
to pass, not one, but two, abortion 
bans. 
Never mind the 250-plus bills to re-
duce prescription drug costs, improve 
access to the ballot box, and more that 
would make a real difference in the 
lives of the American people that he 
could have taken up; instead, he tried 
to control women’s bodies. 
The obsession with telling women, 
transgender folks, and nonbinary peo-
ple what to do with their own bodies 
must end. The obsession with trying to 
legislate what those who can become 
pregnant can do and cannot do with 
their own body must end. 
I represent one of the most beautiful, 
most Black cities in the country, the 
city of Detroit. The issue of reproduc-
tive justice is one that is very much af-
fecting Black women and women of 
color and transgender people all around 
the world. 
Of all female title X patients, for ex-
ample, 32 percent are Latinas, 21 per-
cent are Black, and 4 percent are Asian 
American and Pacific Islander. 
For the 2 million transgender people 
in the United States, this funding 
makes access to the hormone replace-
ment therapy and other transition-re-
lated care that they need very much 
possible for their health. 
How? With over 100 clinics across 17 
States offering HRT, Planned Parent-
hood is one of the largest transition 
care providers in the country. This 
money, this funding that is often 
threatened by anti-abortion rights ad-
vocates is actually a critical source of 
healthcare for these women who al-
ready face health disparities. 
Indeed, title X providers are one of 
the few places where women of color 
can access reproductive and preventive 
healthcare services. It is really critical 
in this institution, in this Chamber, 
that we ensure that those health dis-
parities are not exacerbated by a re-
duction or revocation of that funding. 
When we talk about 20-week abortion 
bans, the stories illustrating why ac-
cess to them is so important are as 
heartbreaking as they are harrowing. 
Take Jenni L. from my home State 
of Michigan as a perfect example. At 
her 18-week ultrasound, Jenni and her 
husband were given the devastating 
news that their unborn son had severe 
brain malfunction. For weeks after 
that appointment, she visited multiple 
specialists and genetic counselors who 
all gave her unborn son the same prog-
nosis: He was unlikely to survive a full 
term. So, at 21 weeks, Jenni termi-
nated her pregnancy. 
Jenni said: ‘‘Deciding to end my 
much-wanted pregnancy was difficult 
and deeply sad, but also deeply per-
sonal. At no point during that process 
did I consider my legislators a part of 
the conversation. I listened to my doc-
tors, genetic counselors, my family, 
and my heart.’’ 
Women like Jenni should absolutely 
have the right to listen to their doctors 
and their hearts when it comes to the 
health of themselves, their unborn 
children, and their bodies. 
Had the GOP had their way, Jenni 
would have spent the remainder of her 
pregnancy term living in fear that at 
any moment her son would pass away 
from this awful prognosis or the fear 
that she would give birth and watch 
him suffer. 
As a mother of two boys myself, I 
cannot 
imagine 
what 
Jenni 
went 
through or her emotional trauma as 
she considered or made that very per-
sonal choice. If she had to carry her 
son or not is up to her. 
She is just one story of many in 
which a mother, through no fault of 
her own, has had to make heart-
breaking decisions about her preg-
nancy. 
Sadly, nearly 99 percent of abortions 
actually do occur before this deadline 
of 20 weeks into pregnancy, but they 
decide to ignore that. They decide to 
make this a political issue, and it is 
not. It is a human issue, a women’s 
issue. 
For Jenni and the countless other 
mothers like her, this legislative body 
must keep their hands off of women’s 
bodies. It is so critically important to 
know, when we talk about this issue, 
that it is an economic justice issue. It 
is a racial justice issue. It is inter-
connected to so much of what we fight 
for as women in this country, to have 
ourselves be able to make very impor-
tant choices, not only about our jobs, 
with no fear of discrimination, but also 
about our health, which is so inter-
connected to so many other social jus-
tice issues that we face. 
So it is critically important that we 
really try to push back against this 
continued agenda that has been politi-
cized and making the issue of choice 
and the issue of healthcare for women 
something that they are vilifying and 
trying to use to a process. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from New York (Ms. OCASIO- 
CORTEZ). 
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank 
my 
esteemed 
colleagues, 
AYANNA PRESSLEY and RASHIDA TLAIB, 
for hosting this week’s Special Order 
hour on an issue that is so critically 
important to all people who want 
healthcare and need equitable access to 
reproductive healthcare and justice in 
the United States. 
Right now, we are facing a critical 
juncture in the fight for healthcare and 
reproductive healthcare in the United 
States. Louisiana lawmakers designed 
a law to push abortion out of reach. It 
compounds the financial barriers of

H1501 
March 4, 2020 
people struggling to make ends meet 
that they already face when seeking 
care, including the decades-old Hyde 
amendment that has long denied af-
fordable abortion care for low-income 
people. 
When I think about this issue and 
when any of us think about this issue, 
we bring our whole selves to the con-
versation. When I think about the issue 
of reproductive healthcare, I bring so 
much of my experience working in hos-
pitality in restaurants. 
Working in restaurants is a front line 
for sexual harassment and sexual as-
sault. Working as a waitress, many of 
my colleagues were sexually harassed 
and sexually assaulted. 
There were days when many of them 
did not have access to reproductive 
healthcare or even prenatal healthcare. 
One woman I know was pregnant and 
had no healthcare, and she had to show 
up at free clinics for hours at a hos-
pital waiting for a new doctor every 
time. 
Another friend of mine that I had 
worked with was in an abusive rela-
tionship, and, as we all know, reporting 
rape is a very different issue than ac-
cessing 
reproductive 
healthcare 
in 
time. 
When we impose things like the Hyde 
amendment, what we say is that, if you 
are wealthy and have these conditions, 
you can have access to reproductive 
healthcare and an abortion, but, if you 
are poor, you will not be afforded those 
same issues. That is what the Hyde 
amendment is telling the American 
people and all people who are capable 
of being pregnant or know a person or 
are part of a family of someone who is 
pregnant. 
It is incredibly important that we ad-
vance and uphold issues of economic 
and racial justice for all people, regard-
less of their income and regardless of 
who they are. 
Right now, choice is the law of the 
land. That law should be extended to 
all people, and there is no reason— 
none—that 
a 
Democratic 
majority 
should uphold the Hyde amendment in 
the United States. We have to make 
sure that all people have access to re-
productive justice and reproductive 
healthcare. 
Last, but not least, these decisions— 
oftentimes heart-wrenching—are not 
decisions to be made between a con-
stituent and a legislator. It is a deci-
sion to be made between a person and 
their doctor. 
Nobody’s healthcare should be up to 
a senator or their State representative 
to determine, no less, when so many of 
these bodies are not representative and 
do not contain in them people who can 
become pregnant. 
People do not understand, so many of 
the people writing these laws do not 
understand the scope and the breadth 
that economic and reproductive justice 
entails; and, to that, we have to make 
sure that we eliminate the Hyde 
amendment and allow all people to 
have access to the reproductive justice 
and healthcare that they need. 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Illinois 
(Mr. 
GARCI´A). 
Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, 
I am proud to participate in this con-
versation about women’s rights and ac-
cess to healthcare services, especially 
reproductive healthcare services. 
I want to thank Congresswoman 
TLAIB
and Congresswoman PRESSLEY 
for their leadership on this matter. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of women’s access to reproductive 
healthcare. 
The Louisiana law now being argued 
at the Supreme Court today, in part, is 
part of an ongoing national effort to ef-
fectively ban abortion without for-
mally bringing up Roe v. Wade. Even if 
the right to abortion technically ex-
ists, it won’t matter if access to places 
to get abortion care are eliminated. 
Republicans have pushed hundreds of 
restrictive laws throughout State leg-
islatures. If they truly cared about 
women, my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle would have voted for 
equal pay and for the Violence Against 
Women Act, but they didn’t. 
Instead, in 2020, they are still ques-
tioning a woman’s constitutional right 
to safe and legal abortion, which has 
been the law of the land for over 46 
years. They want to turn back the 
clock and deny women the right to re-
productive healthcare, to make choices 
about their own bodies. 
For many in my community, this is a 
deeply personal matter. I took a strong 
stance on reproductive rights before 
the issue was widely discussed and ac-
ceptable in my own community, but, 
for me, it has always been impossible 
to separate the issues of economic jus-
tice and reproductive freedom. 
The ability to control if, when, and 
how to have children is at the core of 
women’s ability to provide a decent 
standard of living for themselves and 
their families. 
But let me be clear: While abortion 
access is critical, women of color and 
other marginalized women also often 
have difficulty accessing contracep-
tion, comprehensive sex education, sex-
ually transmitted infection prevention 
and care, adequate prenatal and preg-
nancy care, and so much more. In 
short, one’s socioeconomic and immi-
gration status, ZIP Code, et cetera, 
should not determine access to repro-
ductive help. 
Abortion access is a critical step to-
ward achieving true reproductive jus-
tice for the communities I represent. If 
the Supreme Court decides to strip 
women of their practical access to 
abortion services, as they are now con-
sidering, they will effectively reverse 
Roe v. Wade and outright deny women 
the ability to determine their own 
health, family, and future. 
b 1745 
This is an assault on women, an as-
sault on freedom, and an assault on 
self-determination. 
Women 
alone 
should have the right to choose what is 
best for them. 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentleman from the great State of 
California (Mr. LOWENTHAL). 
Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to thank my colleagues, 
Representatives TLAIB and PRESSLEY, 
for yielding and allowing me to speak. 
As we all know, this morning the Su-
preme Court heard the oral arguments 
in Medical Services v. Russo, a case 
that challenges the unconstitutional 
abortion restrictions in Louisiana. The 
Louisiana law would require abortion 
providers to obtain admitting privi-
leges at a hospital within 30 miles or 
else they must stop providing care. 
Let’s be clear what this is about. 
This restrictive law is meant to elimi-
nate access to abortion care. In fact, if 
this law were allowed to stand, all but 
one of Louisiana’s abortion clinics 
would be shut down. 
This should be a straightforward de-
cision for the Supreme Court. Three 
years ago, the Court struck down an 
identical Texas law in Whole Woman’s 
Health v. Hellerstedt. 
Americans overwhelmingly support 
abortion access. Nearly 80 percent of 
Americans do not want to see Roe v. 
Wade overturned. Polling consistently 
shows that there is not a single State 
in the Union where residents want to 
outlaw abortion. Not one. 
Reproductive rights are central to in-
dividual liberties. What we are talking 
about are deeply personal decisions 
that should remain up to the woman, 
not be decided by politicians. These 
rights enable women to decide if or if 
not and how they should start to grow 
their family. This right should be an 
absolute right and solely up to women 
to make their own decisions about 
their health and their future, and we 
should respect them for making that 
decision. 
Reproductive 
rights 
also 
allow 
women to control their economic secu-
rity and make the best choices for 
themselves and their families. It is not 
our place—any of us—to decide wheth-
er a woman should or should not get an 
abortion. 
Abortion remains one of the safest 
outpatient medical procedures. How-
ever, placing the burden of admitting 
privileges on abortion providers threat-
ens the safety of these procedures. 
Nearly every professional medical asso-
ciation has said having admitting pro-
cedures will not make women safer. 
But let’s be honest. We know there is 
no medical reason for these out-
rageously restrictive laws. There are 
only political reasons behind these 
moves. Admitting privileges, as we 
know, are often difficult for abortion 
providers to obtain, solely because of 
the ideological opposition to abortion. 
Therefore, it is imperative that we 
protect individual liberties and that we 
protect reproductive rights and repro-
ductive education in order to build 
healthy communities. 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Representative PRESSLEY for her in-
credible leadership on this important

issue across the world and not just here 
in the United States. 
Also, this has been a wonderful expe-
rience for all of us new Members to ex-
perience a Special Order that has been 
coordinated and created by the Con-
gressional Progressive Caucus to help 
many of us be able to give a voice to 
many folks at home. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman 
from 
Massachusetts 
(Ms. 
PRESSLEY) for closing remarks. 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Again, I thank Rep-
resentative TLAIB
for cohosting the 
Special Order hour. This is a joint Spe-
cial Order hour in partnership with the 
Congressional Progressive Caucus and 
also the Pro-Choice Caucus. It is excit-
ing that we are the first pro-choice ma-
jority Congress in the history of Con-
gress. 
As heartened as I am by those who 
come here to speak, support, to affirm 
our reproductive rights and freedoms, 
it is shameful that our reproductive 
rights are even up for debate. It is 2020. 
Support for abortion access is at an all- 
time high. In fact, nearly 80 percent of 
Americans do not want to see Roe v. 
Wade overturned. There is not a single 
State in the Nation where making 
abortion illegal is popular. But here we 
find ourselves having to fight back 
against these insidious efforts to un-
dermine our reproductive rights and 
freedoms, and we just keep pushing. 
Just last month the House passed 
legislation to move us one step closer 
to ratifying the ERA. So we will just 
keep speaking out, organizing, and mo-
bilizing when it comes to equality and 
justice on all fronts. I am glad to see so 
many of our colleagues here tonight 
pushing back against these draconian 
efforts that want to take us backwards. 
We won’t stand for it—not now, not 
ever. 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
good colleague from Massachusetts for 
her incredible, much-needed voice here 
in this Chamber. 
As we all know, this Sunday is Inter-
national Women’s Day. So let’s cele-
brate all the women all over the world 
who stand up for what they believe in, 
who speak truth to power, and who 
fight for their communities as activ-
ists, voters, candidates, and elected of-
ficials. 
This International Women’s Day I 
want to uplift an issue that is personal 
to me and so many of my sisters in 
service. Violence against women in pol-
itics is a global problem. Research 
shows that women around the world 
are subjected to physical, sexual, eco-
nomic, and psychological violence for 
choosing to participate in politics. 
When I say around the world, I also 
mean here in the United States. 
As one of the first Muslim women in 
Congress, my family and I face con-
stant death threats and harassment. 
But this will not stop me from fighting 
and being a voice for 13 District 
Strong. But let’s be clear. Harassment, 
abuse, and assault are not the cost of 
doing politics. 
Women deserve to have their voices 
heard. They deserve a seat at the table. 
So this Sunday for International Wom-
en’s Day let’s finally commit to stop-
ping violence against women in poli-
tics. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 4, 2020 
No. 43 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, our Father, through 
these days of Lent, give us a contin-
uous awareness of Your presence. 
May each lawmaker remember Your 
promise to never leave or forsake us. 
Finding power in Your presence, give 
our Senators the ability to discover so-
lutions to the problems that confront 
our Nation and world. May they strive 
to make a positive difference for all 
Americans, permitting Your light to 
illumine the way. Lord, provide our 
legislators with a new vision of faith 
and a fresh venture of hope as they 
seek creative ways to help a troubled 
world. 
We pray in Your powerful Name. 
Amen.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
LOEFFLER). The Senator from Iowa is 
recognized. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
would ask unanimous consent to speak 
for 1 minute as in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
IOWA HISTORY MONTH 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
this month is Iowa History Month. For 
Iowa History Month, I will probably 
give a few 1-minute speeches about the 
history of Iowa, but today I want to 
recognize the role Iowa’s veterans have 
played in our history. 
For instance, in the Civil War, Iowa 
sent over 75,000 soldiers to fight for the 
Union—the most per capita of any 
State. I have been saying ‘‘the most 
per capita of any State’’ because I 
thought that was the history, but I 
have heard other States also say the 
same thing for their States, so I want 
to be intellectually honest. But I am 
still proud of those 75,000 Iowans who 
fought for the Union. 
Iowa has kept that tradition of serv-
ice, and I often have the pleasure of 
meeting our veterans. Yesterday, I met 
an Iowa delegation for the Veterans of 
Foreign Wars. I participate in the Li-
brary of Congress project called the 
Veterans History Project. Accordingly, 
I have had the honor of helping pre-
serve 31 interviews with Iowa veterans 
as 
part 
of 
the 
Veterans 
History 
Project. That has taken place over just 
the last 2 years, preserving the oral 
history of these Iowa veterans. So the 
Iowa Veterans History Project will 
have their stories for future genera-
tions to ensure that the service and the 
sacrifices of these Iowans are never for-
gotten. 
I yield the floor. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS 
BILL 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
last week I described how Congress 
could 
quickly 
secure 
supplemental 
funding to combat the coronavirus. 
The way to secure these urgently need-
ed resources with speed and certainty 
was to forgo partisan posturing, forgo 
micromanagement at the leadership 
level, and let the bipartisan appropri-
ators do their work. 
Since then, Senator SHELBY, Senator 
LEAHY, and their counterparts in the 
House have worked on bipartisan, bi-
cameral discussions. Thanks to their 
good work, we are close. The funding 
legislation appears to be about at the 
5-yard line. I hope to complete the leg-
islation and deliver this funding this 
week. We are close. 
In order to finish up, both sides will 
need to continue doing what has 
worked thus far and resist the tempta-
tion to impose any last-minute ideo-
logical demands. In particular, I have 
heard that the Democratic leadership 
may be contemplating a last-minute 
demand that this funding legislation 
also test drive some untried, untested, 
and controversial parts of their Medi-
care for All proposal that relate to the 
pricing of new drugs and innovations. 
So, look, everyone agrees that the 
potential diagnostics, therapeutics, or 
vaccines that might come out of this 
new funding cannot only be available 
to the ultrawealthy. We all agree on 
that. Everyone agrees. We already have 
longstanding, 
tried-and-true 
proce-
dures so the government can buy and 
distribute new medicines in scenarios 
like this to ensure accessibility. These 
mechanisms 
are 
already 
in 
place. 
There is no need and this is no time to 
begin experimenting with ideological 
proposals that could jeopardize re-
search, development, and innovation. 
Like I said, the accessibility of treat-
ments or vaccines is a priority for ev-
erybody, but before new technologies 
can be accessible, they obviously have 
to be available. 
This 
is 
a 
moment 
to 
empower 
innovators, to incentivize innovators. 
It is a time to remove hurdles to inno-
vation, not build new hurdles and cre-
ate new uncertainty through ideolog-
ical experimentation. 
So I hope these rumors do not prove 
true. I am optimistic we will be able to 
close out the remaining questions and 
process this legislation in short order. 
This moment calls for collaboration

S1450 
March 4, 2020 
and for unity. Our bicameral, bipar-
tisan talks have made great headway. 
It is time to give our public health ex-
perts and healthcare professionals the 
surge of resources they need at this 
challenging time. 
f 
S. 2657 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
in the meantime, the Senate will con-
tinue considering an important pack-
age of comprehensive energy legisla-
tion. For the first time in more than a 
decade, we are looking at a thorough 
update to the laws governing innova-
tion, security, and workforce develop-
ment all across the American energy 
sector. 
As Chairman MURKOWSKI has noted, 
12 years is a long time. The demands 
we face in researching, producing, re-
fining, storing, and protecting our 
abundant 
domestic 
energy 
have 
evolved a great deal since 2007, so it is 
high time for relevant Federal policy 
to evolve as well. I am grateful the 
chairman was willing to take on this 
important task, and I am glad she and 
Senator MANCHIN led their colleagues 
on the Energy and Natural Resources 
Committee through an overwhelmingly 
bipartisan process to produce this bill. 
As I mentioned yesterday, the legis-
lation aggregates 50 individual bills. It 
contains input from more than 60 Sen-
ators. It covers an exhaustive range of 
energy-related challenges, from power 
storage and renewable technologies to 
carbon capture and electrical grid 
cyber security. 
It has earned the support of a simi-
larly broad range of industry, advo-
cacy, and research organizations. In 
one joint letter, the Bipartisan Policy 
Center, the American Nuclear Society, 
the Nature Conservancy, and 36 other 
signatories endorsed it as ‘‘the cul-
mination of extensive efforts to de-
velop practical legislative solutions.’’ 
That is the American Nuclear Society 
and 
the 
Nature 
Conservancy—that 
ought to tell you what you need to 
know about this bill. This is a bipar-
tisan piece of legislation done right. 
This is how you take practical steps to 
build consensus on issues that affect 
every American in every State. 
Around this time last year, you will 
recall we saw a high-profile example of 
exactly what not to do. The far-left 
edge of the House Democratic caucus 
rolled out a massive scheme to forcibly 
remake much of our economy and our 
society according to their radical top- 
down designs. 
We all remember the Green New 
Deal—categorical bans on the most af-
fordable forms of American energy, a 
dim future for millions of energy jobs, 
unprecedented Washington mandates 
on every subject from building codes to 
personal transportation. We all remem-
ber what happened next: This socialist 
fantasy did not stay confined to ideo-
logical fringe; it quickly grew into a 
broader rallying cry. When the Senate 
had the opportunity to vote on this 
wish list of central planning, only 
four—just four—of our Democratic col-
leagues could bring themselves to vote 
against it. That is quite a remarkable 
commentary on the state of our poli-
tics. 
Experts estimated the Green New 
Deal could have cost our government 
more than the GDP of the entire world. 
The Green New Deal could have cost 
our government more than the GDP of 
the entire world. Instead, this bipar-
tisan legislation will let us direct re-
sponsible and targeted investment in a 
smart way toward key energy prior-
ities. 
The Green New Deal sought to have 
Washington micromanage everyday life 
in this country to a degree that the 
20th-century 
Socialists 
would 
have 
drooled over. Instead, this bipartisan 
legislation will create better policy 
and regulatory conditions for Amer-
ican workers, American innovators, 
and American job creators to actually 
thrive. 
Speaking as the senior Senator from 
Kentucky, I know firsthand that many 
Americans in the middle of the country 
suffered badly during the Obama era 
because Washington bureaucrats de-
cided American energy had to fit their 
ideological designs. The very last thing 
we want is to move backward and ex-
pand those errors exponentially with 
radical 
leftwing 
experiments 
that 
would make the last administration’s 
War on Coal look like child’s play. 
What Kentuckians and all Americans 
deserve is for the Federal Government 
to make prosperity and domestic en-
ergy 
dominance 
easier—easier—not 
harder. They deserve investment and 
support to help the communities that 
have fueled this country for genera-
tions to prosper once again, and that is 
what this bipartisan bill will actually 
deliver. 
I am proud to support this smart leg-
islation. Clearly, I am not alone, since 
only three Senators voted against ad-
vancing the bill this week. So I would 
urge all of my colleagues to keep up 
their support, and let’s see this pack-
age through to the finish line.

The senior assistant legislative clerk

Motion to proceed to S. 2657, a bill to sup-
port innovation in advanced geothermal re-
search and development, and for other pur-
poses. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, 
today we vote to begin the consider-
ation of S. 2657, which will serve as the 
vehicle for the American Energy Inno-
vation Act. This is truly bipartisan en-
ergy policy. This innovative package 
will be the first comprehensive policy 
update in 13 years. It brings together 
the strong bipartisan work of the En-
ergy Committee over the last year. 
I would like to thank my friend and 
chairman of the committee, LISA MUR-
KOWSKI, Republican from Alaska, for 
her leadership and partnership with me 
over the last 14 months to process 
these bills and form the basis of the en-
ergy package we will be turning to 
today. 
Thanks to the members of the En-
ergy and Natural Resources Committee 
for their contributions to the develop-
ment of this legislation. 
The American Energy Innovation Act 
draws from 53 bills from Members from 
both sides of the aisle, and 39 of those 
were truly a bipartisan effort. And 63 
Members of the Senate have either 
sponsored or cosponsored a piece of 
this package. 
It truly is a bipartisan product and 
one that I believe will benefit this 
country greatly. So far, we have had 
over 150 amendments filed, several of 
which are bipartisan, and there is no 
controversial issue that I know of. I am 
hoping that we can work together to 
incorporate some of those amendments 
from both sides of the aisle. 
As it stands, the American Energy 
Innovation Act will advance the abili-
ties of Department of Energy and the 
National Laboratories to deliver the 
much needed technology that Amer-
ican workers can then produce and ex-
port across the global marketplace. 
Not only will it further our ability to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions from 
energy, transportation, industry, and 
buildings, but it will also enhance our 
cyber and grid security and maintain 
our competitive edge and role as a 
global leader. 
We talk a lot—all of us do—about 
global climate, and when you think 
about global climate, then you think 
about our responsibility and what we 
emit into the air. For some reason, 
most people have been led to believe 
that power generation—whether it be 
coal-fired powerplants, natural gas- 
fired powerplants, or anything that has 
to do with fossil—is contributing all of 
the greenhouse gas emissions in the 
United States. That is just not true. 
Let me give you the breakdown. 
Power generation contributes 27.5 per-
cent of the greenhouse gas emissions.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1451 
March 4, 2020 
Power generation is how you get your 
electricity—if it comes from a coal- 
fired powerplant, gas, or any other 
type of fossil. 
Transportation is how we come and 
go back and forth to work and how we 
receive our goods. Whether it is going 
to be by car, by train, by plane, or by 
trucks, 29 percent of the responsibility 
for greenhouse gases goes to transpor-
tation. 
The industry is where people work, 
where they make their living, provide 
for their family, whether it be in a 
small factory, a large factory, a small 
business, or a high-tech business. In-
dustry contributes 22 percent of green-
house gas emissions. 
Commercial and residential, which is 
the building we are in today, which is 
the beautiful Capitol, and where we 
live—just the commercial and residen-
tial—are 11.5 percent responsible for 
greenhouse gases. 
So you have to have an ‘‘all in’’ pol-
icy. One thing doesn’t fit, and we don’t 
have a silver bullet to fix everything. 
What we have done is this. You take all 
of those—power generation, transpor-
tation, industry, commercial and resi-
dential—and that represents 90 percent 
of all the greenhouse gas emissions. We 
are approaching—and, basically, this 
piece of legislation approaches—every 
one of those to reduce the greenhouse 
gas emissions. 
If we all work together and pass this 
truly bipartisan, far-reaching, all-in-
clusive bill, it will make a world of dif-
ference in how we lead the rest of the 
world in reducing greenhouse gas emis-
sions. That is what we are trying to do. 
We do it through innovation. We 
don’t do it through elimination. Elimi-
nation is not practical, responsible, or 
reasonable. The rest of the world will 
not follow, and, basically, we have to 
have baseload fuel. It has to be depend-
able, reliable, and affordable, but it has 
to be the cleanest in the world. That is 
what this bill does. 
There is the other 9 percent. You say: 
Well, that is 90 percent; where is the 
other 10 percent? That is in agri-
culture. That is not in our jurisdiction, 
but they are working very hard in the 
Agriculture Committee to reduce their 
greenhouse gas emissions and their 
footprint. Everybody is doing their job. 
I believe this package is well bal-
anced, and many of my colleagues’ pri-
orities on both sides of the aisle have 
been met. This bill represents a critical 
step in the right direction. I encour-
age—I truly, sincerely encourage—all 
of my fellow Members, Democrats and 
Republicans, to vote yes today on the 
motion to proceed. Your children will 
thank us, and your grandchildren and 
generations after them will definitely 
thank all of us for doing our job today. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, as 
the number of confirmed cases of 
coronavirus in the United States con-
tinues to grow, Congress is taking 
swift action this week to provide our 
health experts, hospitals, healthcare 
providers, and State and local govern-
ments the funding they need. A bipar-
tisan negotiation between appropri-
ators in the House and Senate is very 
close to producing an emergency fund-
ing bill that will provide between $7 
and $8 billion to respond to the 
coronavirus. 
This is very close to the amount that 
I thought was appropriate when I re-
quested it last week—$8.5 billion—and 
it is more than four or five times what 
the 
administration 
originally 
re-
quested. I believe that if we had not 
pushed them, they would have been to-
tally inadequate to the crisis, as they 
have been in preparation and planning. 
The administration requested $2.5 
billion, which was half, and only half of 
that was new funding. The rest came 
from pulling it out of other things, like 
Ebola, which is very much needed as 
well. The bill we put together here in 
Congress is far more appropriate and 
will actually address our country’s 
short-term and medium-term needs. 
This is very, very good news. 
I would like to compliment Demo-
crats and Republicans, in the House 
and the Senate, for making efforts to 
come together and for being the adults 
in the room, while President Trump 
childishly 
exaggerates, 
underplays, 
points fingers of blame, latches on to 
conspiracy theories, and, most of all, 
doesn’t lead. This is an example of 
where America needs leadership, and 
President Trump’s lack of leadership is 
glaringly apparent to Americans. 
Crucial legislation provides funding 
for very specific and timely needs. 
There will be $350 million for ‘‘hot 
spots’’—areas affected by the outbreak. 
There will be $500 million to procure 
pharmaceuticals, 
masks, 
protective 
equipment, and other medical supplies 
to distribute to States, local govern-
ments, and hospitals. There will be $100 
million for community health centers 
and funding for training and beds. We 
are replenishing the CDC’s Infectious 
Disease Rapid Response Reserve Fund 
so that it can respond quickly to local 
areas that experience an outbreak. 
In total, there is over $950 million in 
funding for State and local govern-
ments to undertake the many activi-
ties they need to respond to the spread 
of the virus, surveillance for the 
coronavirus, laboratory testing, con-
tact tracing to identify anyone who 
may have been infected by a person 
known to have the virus, infection con-
trol at the local level, and more. 
This is only one piece of the bill. The 
rest of the bill will give desperately 
needed funds to CDC, HHS, USAID, 
FDA, and others to do vaccine research 
and development and much more. The 
funding level in this bill and the spe-
cific use very much reflects the needs 
of the country as healthcare profes-
sionals across America work to con-
front the spread of the virus. 
I want to thank our appropriators on 
the frontlines: Ranking Member LEAHY 
and Chairman SHELBY in the Senate 
and Chair LOWEY and Ranking Member 
GRANGER
in the House. While the 
Trump administration’s response has 
been slow and halting, Congress has 
taken action. While President Trump is 
playing fast and loose with facts and 
blaming everyone not named Donald 
Trump, Congress is taking responsi-
bility in acting like the adult in the 
room. 
Democrats would like to see this 
emergency 
funding 
package 
passed 
through the Senate by the end of the 
week, and we will work with the major-
ity to make sure that that happens. I 
urge all of my colleagues, in the inter-
est of time, understanding the urgency 
of the matter, to help us achieve this 
goal. 
Now, yesterday, Vice President MIKE 
PENCE and his team from CDC, FDA, 
and HHS met with the Democratic cau-
cus to answer questions about the ad-
ministration’s 
response 
to 
the 
coronavirus. We appreciated their will-
ingness to come to our caucus. They 
stayed. Unlike at some of the previous 
briefings, they stayed and addressed a 
lot of our questions. The only problem 
is they didn’t have as many answers as 
we needed—answers the American peo-
ple would have expected at this stage 
of the epidemic. 
One of our top priorities at the mo-
ment is testing. We need to know who 
is infected in order to contain the 
spread of the virus and treat any Amer-
ican infected by the disease. We asked 
the administration about the avail-
ability of testing kits, but they could 
not answer how soon hospitals, medical 
labs, and public health centers would 
receive the tests and if they would 
have enough of them to do the amount 
of testing required fast enough. The 
best way to deal with testing is to let 
people do it onsite. Let them go to 
their local doctor, their local CHC, and 
get the test and get an answer quickly. 
Unfortunately, the Vice President and 
his team had no answers to that. It is 
a real problem. Our questions at the 
meeting yesterday should give the ad-
ministration an urgency to figure this 
out as soon as possible. 
I would also plead with President 
Trump to begin showing some leader-
ship on the coronavirus. So far, the 
President’s main concern has been to 
tamp down concern about the virus. He 
gives broad assurances that ‘‘every-
thing is under control.’’ 
When you show up at your doctor’s 
office because you think you might 
have the coronavirus and there is no 
test, he doesn’t know what to do. He 
just says: Go home and don’t go to 
work.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1452 
March 4, 2020 
That is not ‘‘everything under con-
trol,’’ Mr. President. 
If any member of his administration 
tells the President something opti-
mistic, he repeats it and usually exag-
gerates it. The disease will magically 
disappear when the weather gets warm; 
a vaccine will be ready soon—all 
misstatements from President Trump. 
In a televised meeting with govern-
ment 
health 
experts 
and 
pharma-
ceutical experts, the President repeat-
edly failed to comprehend that a vac-
cine would take over a year to develop 
and test. This is the President of the 
United States during a crisis. He 
doesn’t even understand the basic rudi-
ments of what is going on. He sug-
gested blithely that we could just use 
the 
influenza 
vaccine 
for 
the 
coronavirus, and he was quickly cor-
rected by Dr. Fauci, one of our health 
experts. Twenty-four hours later, the 
President was claiming that pharma 
executives would speed up the produc-
tion of a vaccine as a ‘‘favor’’ to him. 
President Trump, people are sick. 
People are dying. This virus is wreak-
ing havoc on the economy, and you 
look at it as a favor to you? It is not 
about you, Mr. President; it is about 
America and the crisis and what our 
Federal Government is doing to help. 
The President saying it was a favor 
to him, stating such blatant mistruths, 
was a shocking demonstration of just 
how little the President listens, how 
little the President learns, and how lit-
tle leadership he shows at a time when 
we desperately need leadership. 
During a public health crisis of this 
magnitude, we need steady and con-
fident 
leadership 
from 
President 
Trump. So far, it has been totaling 
lacking—unfortunately for America. 
I yield the floor.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I 
thank all of those who just voted for 
the motion to proceed to S. 2657. We 
have called up my substitute amend-
ment, No. 1407, which now contains the 
full text of the American Energy Inno-
vation Act. 
We are moving through the process, 
albeit a little slowly here, but we are 
moving through the process. We now 
have more than 150 amendments that 
have been filed to the bill. Senator 
MANCHIN and I are working together 
with other Members to sort through 
potential votes on the bill. We are also 
working to see which ones might fit 
into a managers’ package of easy, non-
controversial, worked-out proposals. I 
know everyone thinks that theirs is 
easy and that it has been worked out, 
and, of course, it is not controversial, 
but we have a handful of those pro-
posals and are seeking additional ones. 
I would remind Members that amend-
ments require bipartisan cooperation, 
especially from those beyond the Com-
mittee on Energy and Natural Re-
sources’ jurisdiction. Those who are on 
the committee have had an oppor-
tunity to go through each and every 
one of these measures that we have in 
front of us and that have been incor-
porated as part of this American En-
ergy Innovation Act. That input has 
been helpful and very, very positive as 
we have built these proposals. I know 
some folks are looking at much of this 
for the first time if they are not on the 
committee. They have ideas that are 
good and worthy, and we want to re-
spect that process and incorporate 
them as appropriate and enhance this 
bill. 
I want to have votes. The leader has 
said he wants to have an open amend-
ment process. I want to have a man-
agers’ package, but it is entirely pos-
sible—we have seen it before—that the 
opportunity will be spoiled. I would 
just urge Members to be honest about 
how ready their proposals really are. 
Sometimes, they might not be as vet-
ted as you think they might be, and 
they might need some additional work, 
but know that, as a committee, we 
stand ready to work with Members on 
those proposals to better enhance 
them. 
I have taken the opportunity over 
the past couple of days to share with 
colleagues more about what our pack-
age includes—the result of this good 
work that we have done over the past 
year in working through regular order 
in our committee. Last night, I talked 
about title I, which focuses on innova-
tion—the big, key buzzword here, ‘‘in-
novation’’—everything from energy ef-
ficiency and renewables to energy stor-
age. We all talk a lot about energy 
storage—advanced nuclear and carbon 
capture, utilization, and storage. So 
there is a good focus on the innovation 
side of this bill. 
This morning, I would like to high-
light what is in title II, which is kind 
of our security title, and I put it in 
three different buckets. You have min-
eral security, which is critical to the 
supply chain. You have cyber security 
and grid security, which, again, are 
key to all operations of commerce and 
our economy. Then you have the eco-
nomic security that comes with good 
jobs. The focus on the workforce is 
here as well. 
Out of these three, I begin with min-
eral security, because we don’t always 
associate these efforts with meeting 
our energy and our climate goals. 
What we focus on within this bill is 
the development of new, clean tech-
nologies, but there is also a very im-
portant reality that we have to ac-
knowledge, which is that meeting our 
energy and our climate goals will re-
quire a significant increase in our sup-
ply of critical minerals. The world is 
not producing nearly enough of almost 
all of them. Think about that. We are 
pushing and challenging those within 
our national labs and those within the 
private sector and are saying: Move us 
to 
these 
cleaner 
technologies—the 
world of renewables. Yet we have to 
build all of these things. Whether it is 
your smartphone or whether it is a 
wind turbine, we need to build them, 
and they require minerals—they re-
quire critical minerals. 
If we are not producing them, where 
are we getting them from? More to the 
point, the United States is not pro-
ducing nearly enough of almost any of 
these materials that we are talking 
about when it comes to how we move 
to clean energy sources. We are largely 
absent from the field, as countries— 
most 
notably, 
China—increasingly 
dominate long-term supply chains that 
will give them an almost insurmount-
able competitive advantage. 
Consider a few of the numbers here. 
According to the World Bank, meeting 
the goals that have been set by the 
Paris Agreement would increase de-
mand for battery storage minerals, like 
lithium, cobalt, and nickel, by 1,000 
percent. Right now, nearly 70 percent 
of raw cobalt is coming from the Demo-
cratic Republic of the Congo, and over 
60 percent of the processed cobalt used 
in batteries is controlled by China. 
Think about that. The United States 
has no capacity for battery-grade co-
balt. That is the situation we are in 
right now. There is no capacity for bat-
tery-grade cobalt here in this country, 
and that is before the projected 600-per-
cent increase in demand over the next 
30 years. 
Despite new development on State 
and private lands in Nevada and North 
Carolina, the United States only pro-
duces about one percent of the world’s 
raw lithium and contributes about 
seven percent of the processed mate-
rials. Think about it—the cobalt that 
is so necessary and the lithium that we 
require for our batteries. The same 
goes for graphite, whereby 60 percent of 
mined graphite and 100 percent of the 
processed material is coming from 
China. We have some very promising 
reserves in my State of Alaska for 
graphite. Again, think about what this 
means when we are talking about solar 
panels, advanced batteries, and electric 
vehicles. What are they made of? It is 
not chocolate and candy canes here. If 
we want to compete in the industries of 
the future, we are going to have to do 
better. We will have to compete with 
China, particularly, and right now, we 
are at a disadvantage. 
Last year, an expert from the For-
eign Policy Analytics testified about 
China’s domination of mineral markets 
and supply chains. For electric vehi-
cles, China controls or has influence 
over 80 percent of the supply of rare 
earth elements. China also controls or 
has influence over 70 percent of the 
supply of graphite and graphene, 59 
percent of the supply of lithium, 56 per-
cent of the supply of vanadium, and 36 
percent of the supply of cobalt. 
Some of this is due to the production 
and supply chains in China. Some of it 
is as a result of extensive investments 
that China has made to acquire mines 
and mining interests around the world, 
most notably in places like the Congo. 
Yet this is the reality that we are fac-
ing right now—this ever-increasing re-
liance on and, therefore, vulnerability 
for these minerals that are so nec-
essary to the investments that we will 
make. 
It is not just China we are talking 
about here. Canada is well ahead of us. 
Just 
this 
week, 
Prime 
Minister 
Trudeau released the Canadian Min-
erals and Metals Plan, with the goal of 
‘‘being the leading mining nation,’’ in 
part, because minerals are critical to 
clean energy technologies. 
So while other countries are com-
peting to lead in this space, what are 
we doing here in this country? How are 
we doing it?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1454 
March 4, 2020 
Now, I want to give the administra-
tion credit in this space. They recog-
nize the problem. They are acting on 
it. The President laid down an Execu-
tive order. I just visited with the Sec-
retary of the Interior on their minerals 
analysis, but, really, the facts in front 
of us are pretty clear. 
USGS tells us this every year: We are 
still a long, long way from true min-
eral security. Right now, we import at 
least 50 percent of our supply of 46 dif-
ferent minerals, including 100 percent 
of 17 of them. 
This is like the Achilles’ heel for us 
because we have effectively surren-
dered the front end of the supply chain, 
and then we wonder why we have such 
a hard time capturing any of the rest 
of it. 
So our mineral subtitle will help put 
us on the right track. It is not an over-
night cure-all; there is none. But it will 
enable the United States to increase 
the responsible production and proc-
essing of critical minerals. It will help 
us figure out what we have. It will help 
us develop alternatives and substitutes 
for the minerals that we lack, and that 
is an important part of this because, as 
much as it is important to have that 
secure supply here, we need to be push-
ing ourselves to recycle, to find the al-
ternatives and the substitutes. That is 
key and folds into the first title, which 
is all about innovation and the tech-
nologies that will help us advance that 
but keeping and pushing on the R&D in 
that space. 
Then, also, what we do within the 
bill is increase recycling to reduce the 
need for new supplies. So you have a 
focus on mineral security, but how 
that ties into innovation and how we 
can reuse, recycle, and develop alter-
natives is key. 
Over time, our mineral subtitle will 
help America become a leader in grow-
ing industries like battery and renew-
able manufacturing, along with the 
jobs and the economic growth that 
they represent. 
I think it also helps put the United 
States in the driver’s seat to prevent 
supply disruptions that could quickly 
derail our efforts to deploy renewables, 
energy storage, EVs, and other tech-
nologies. 
There is one thing our minerals sub-
title will not do. It will not weaken 
laws that protect our lands and waters. 
Our bill continues to ensure that only 
responsible development is allowed to 
proceed. 
I have heard some claim just as re-
cently as yesterday that our bill will 
somehow weaken the environmental 
review process, but know that that is 
not accurate. That is simply wrong. 
The United States, right now, has 
one of the slowest permitting processes 
in the world—in the world. Some years 
back we were dead last; we were actu-
ally tied with Papua New Guinea. We 
do not have a permitting process that 
is the envy of anyone. It is entirely fair 
to encourage agencies to do better, like 
their 
counterparts 
all 
around 
the 
world, by working smarter and more 
efficiently. 
I also want to remind colleagues that 
we passed this same provision as part 
of our 2016 energy bill. Minerals were 
important enough to draw 85 votes 
back then, in 2016, so I would think 
that we would regard them as even 
more important now as our reliance 
and our vulnerability have only in-
creased. 
I want to thank Senator MANCHIN for 
his support on our efforts on mineral 
security and for his cosponsorship of 
the American Mineral Security Act. I 
was also glad to be able to combine his 
efforts on a bill that he called Rare 
Earth Element Advanced Coal Tech-
nologies. We have included that bill in 
our subtitle. 
I also want to thank a number of 
members on the Energy and Natural 
Resources Committee—Senators BAR-
RASSO, RISCH, DAINES, and MCSALLY— 
for their help in this very important 
subtitle. 
Another subtitle within title II on se-
curity addresses the real and growing 
threat of cyber attacks. According to 
the 2019 Worldwide Threat Assessment 
of the U.S. Intelligence Community, 
China, Russia, and other foreign adver-
saries are using cyber operations to 
target our critical energy infrastruc-
ture. 
We have already seen the real-world 
ramifications of cyber attacks on en-
ergy infrastructure. In December of 
2015, Russian hackers cut off power to 
nearly a quarter of a million people in 
Ukraine. Two years later, Russian 
hackers infiltrated the industrial con-
trol system of a Saudi Arabian petro-
chemical plant and disabled the plant’s 
safety systems. We can’t let that hap-
pen here. 
Our electric grid, which is composed 
of generation, transmission, and dis-
tribution resources, is a uniquely crit-
ical asset. Every sector of our economy 
depends on it. We know what the im-
pact would be if there were a successful 
hack. It could impact homes, hospitals, 
banks, gas pumps, traffic lights, cell 
phone services. The consequences real-
ly go without bounds in terms of the 
devastation that could be wrought, 
particularly if power can’t be restored 
for any meaningful duration. 
So, working with the administration, 
we have seen some good steps to ad-
dress this through the establishment of 
the Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Se-
curity, and Emergency Responses, also 
known as CESER, at the Department 
of Energy. I thank them for the leader-
ship there. This office is really pretty 
busy preparing for and responding to 
more and increasingly sophisticated 
cyber threats. 
Our innovation package builds on 
that effort through a bill called the 
PROTECT Act, which will enhance 
cyber security defenses of grid assets 
by providing incentives, grants, and 
technical assistance for utilities to in-
vest in cutting-edge technologies. 
The innovation package will also 
allow all utilities and power producers, 
especially those most vulnerable small-
er utilities that have fewer resources, 
to continue investing in new tech-
nology that keeps their systems pro-
tected against evolving cyber threats. 
This is important because we tend to 
focus on the big systems and what that 
impact might be, but for many, many, 
many around the country in our small-
er, more rural areas, these are our 
smaller utilities that don’t have the re-
sources to really be as current or as 
protected as they want to be and as 
they should be in the event of any kind 
of cyber threat. So helping assist them 
is important. 
We included language from Senator 
GARDNER to facilitate State energy se-
curity plans and public-private part-
nerships for grid security. We included 
Senator CANTWELL’s Energy Cybersecu-
rity Act, which puts programs in place 
for the DOE to effectively partner with 
industry and other Federal agencies. 
Senator CANTWELL has been a real 
leader—when she was the ranking 
member on the committee and now—as 
she continues to focus on this issue, 
the very important issue of cybersecu-
rity. So she has a good provision in-
cluded in this bill as well. 
The American Energy Innovation Act 
will help improve our national security 
in significant ways—again, through 
mineral security and protecting our 
electric grid from cyber attacks. 
We recognize that these measures 
play a crucial role in supporting energy 
innovation and ensuring that its many 
benefits can be enjoyed by the Amer-
ican people. 
There is more that I will take the 
time to outline at a later point, but I 
think it is important that, as Members 
consider what this energy provision al-
lows for, it is pretty expansive. It is 
pretty expansive, and it is expansive 
because, again, we haven’t seen an en-
ergy bill become law in 12 years, so it 
should be expansive, and it should 
focus on how we can help facilitate 
more of the ingenuity and innovation 
that will come forward from our uni-
versities, from our labs, from public- 
private partnerships, from those who 
are working every day with great ideas 
to help, really, transform not only our 
economy but our environment as well. 
So it is more than innovation in the 
renewable space. It is innovation in the 
carbon space. It is innovation in the 
nuclear space. It is innovation when it 
comes to industrial emissions. It is in-
novation when it comes to efficiency. 
With that innovation comes security, 
whether it be recognizing that we must 
do more to ensure that we have stable 
and secure supply chains through min-
eral security, through the security 
that comes with protection of our grids 
and protection from cyber threats, 
modernization of our grids, and, again, 
the security of the good jobs that come 
with a skilled workforce. 
So there is much to talk about in 
this good measure. Again, I encourage 
colleagues, we are in an amendment

process. Come to us with your com-
ments, your suggestions, your con-
cerns. Let’s work them out, but let’s 
get an energy bill through the Senate, 
through the House, and signed into law 
by the President. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
CRAMER). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
NET NEUTRALITY 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, 2 years 
ago at this time, we were hearing that 
the internet, as we know it, was going 
to disappear. On February 27, 2018, Sen-
ate Democrats sent a tweet warning 
that Americans would be getting the 
internet one word at a time. Why? Be-
cause the Federal Communications 
Commission had repealed heavyhanded, 
Obama-era internet regulation. If we 
didn’t immediately undo the FCC’s 
rules change, Democrats warned, the 
effects on internet access would be cat-
astrophic. 
Well, 2 years later, the internet, as 
we know it, isn’t just still with us, it is 
flourishing. Broadband access has ex-
panded; Americans are enjoying faster 
internet speeds; and we are imple-
menting 5G internet technology across 
the Nation, including in more rural 
places like South Dakota. 
It turns out the internet doesn’t fall 
apart without the heavy hand of gov-
ernment. In fact, it thrives. That 
should be an important lesson for us 
going forward. Historically speaking, 
the Federal Government has taken a 
light-touch approach to internet regu-
lation. The government largely stayed 
out of the internet’s way, and innova-
tion and creativity flourished, deliv-
ering nearly everything from Netflix to 
weather apps, to Uber. But in 2014, the 
Obama administration decided it want-
ed the Federal Government to start 
regulating the internet more heavily, 
and in 2015, the Obama Federal Com-
munications Commission passed the 
Open Internet Order, which dramati-
cally expanded the Federal Govern-
ment’s power over the internet in the 
name of net neutrality. 
Now, you might not know it from 
Democrats’ rhetoric, but net neutrality 
is a concept that enjoys broad support 
in both parties. I support net neu-
trality and rules that prevent blocking, 
throttling, or the paid prioritization of 
internet traffic. I don’t think a major 
service provider should be able to block 
a small new startup, and I don’t think 
Netflix should be able to pay to have 
its search results appear before anyone 
else’s. 
What the Obama FCC did in 2015 went 
far beyond net neutrality. In the name 
of keeping the internet open to every-
one, the Obama FCC asserted broad 
new government powers over the inter-
net using rules that were designed for 
telephone monopolies back during the 
Great Depression. This opened a whole 
host of new internet regulations, in-
cluding price regulations. 
Unsurprisingly, the FCC’s move re-
sulted in a decline in broadband invest-
ment as companies saw the possibility 
of burdensome new regulations headed 
their way. That was bad news for 
Americans, especially Americans in 
rural States like my home State of 
South Dakota. 
Getting broadband to rural commu-
nities is already more challenging than 
installing broadband in cities or sub-
urbs. The possibility of heavier regula-
tions acted as a further disincentive to 
expanding access. 
Fast forward to 2017, and the Federal 
Communications 
Commission, 
under 
Chairman Pai, voted to repeal the 
heavyhanded 
internet 
regulations 
passed by the Obama FCC. Democrats, 
as I already mentioned, responded 
hysterically, predicting that the inter-
net, as we knew it, would disappear. 
Providers, they warned, would slow 
down internet speeds to a crawl and 
block access to desired content—ex-
cept, of course, none of that has hap-
pened. 
Here is what actually has happened. 
Broadband investment has rebounded. 
In 2018, private broadband investment 
rose by $3 billion. Broadband access is 
expanding. The FCC reports that in 
2018, ‘‘broadband providers, both small 
and large, deployed fiber networks to 
5.9 million new homes, the largest 
number ever recorded.’’ 
Internet speeds have increased. 
The Nation is poised for widespread 
adoption of the next generation of 
internet, which is 5G. All of this de-
spite light-touch government regula-
tion or, perhaps more accurately, be-
cause of light-touch government regu-
lation. 
At a time when Democrats are push-
ing for government takeovers of every-
thing from our healthcare to our en-
ergy choices, it is important to remem-
ber that a lot of times heavyhanded 
government involvement causes prob-
lems instead of solving them. Of 
course, there is a place for government 
regulations, but more government in-
volvement 
does 
not 
automatically 
mean a better outcome. In fact, a lot of 
the time it means the opposite. 
Giving the Federal Government more 
power over the internet not only didn’t 
help anything, it actually discouraged 
the investment needed to ensure that 
all Americans have access to reliable, 
high-speed internet service. Lifting the 
heavy hand of government regulation, 
on 
the 
other 
hand, 
encouraged 
broadband investment, which is result-
ing in better internet access for more 
Americans. 
If we want the internet to continue 
to thrive and serve as an engine of eco-
nomic innovation and advancement, we 
should ensure that the Federal Govern-
ment stays away from heavyhanded 
regulations. 
I have spent years calling for a bipar-
tisan net neutrality bill that would ad-
dress concerns about blocking while 
codifying a light-touch approach to 
internet regulation. I am still waiting 
for a Democratic partner on that legis-
lation. 
While the current FCC has estab-
lished a healthy approach to regula-
tion, a different administration could 
return and, in the same way they did 
during the days of the Obama FCC, 
slow down internet advances like 5G 
and the expansion of broadband that is 
happening in rural communities across 
the country. 
I will continue to work for bipartisan 
net neutrality legislation that ensures 
that the government will not weigh 
down the internet with unnecessary 
and heavyhanded regulations. I hope 
my Democratic colleagues will join me. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, yester-
day the Senate passed my resolution to 
honor the life of Li Wenliang, the Chi-
nese doctor who heroically tried to 
warn his fellow citizens and the world 
about the Wuhan coronavirus late last 
year. Dr. Li tragically fell victim to 
that very disease but not before he was 
victimized by his own government, the 
Chinese Communist Party. Li was 34 
years old when he passed away of 
coronavirus on February 7. He had a 
wife, a young child, and another child 
on the way. His whole life was ahead of 
him, and now his wife is widowed, his 
child has no father, and his second 
child will never know his father. 
As Li knew, when you become a doc-
tor, you pledge to care for the sick and 
the dying—whatever the hardships, 
whatever the cost, whatever the risks 
to yourself. So when patients with a se-
vere pneumonia began appearing in 
Li’s hospital late last year, he sounded 
the alarm to fellow doctors, and the 
Chinese Communist Party responded 
with lightning speed—not to contain 
this epidemic but to intimidate Dr. Li 
and attack his reputation. 
Local Communist goons paid him a 
visit a few days later, forcing him to 
retract his statements and apologize 
for so-called illegal behavior. China’s 
state media piled on, denouncing Li 
and 
other 
whistleblowers 
as 
rumormongers who were spreading fear 
among the Chinese people. 
That has been the pattern of the Chi-
nese Communist Party’s response to 
the coronavirus from the very begin-
ning—first coverup and then catas-
trophe. 
When Chinese internet users flooded 
social media with indignation fol-
lowing Dr. Li’s death, their cries were

scrubbed from the internet by the Com-
munist Party’s army of censors. 
When a Chinese human rights activ-
ist called for Chairman Xi to step 
down, he was detained and then dis-
appeared. 
When Wall Street Journal columnist 
Walter Russell Mead wrote a bracing 
article about the Chinese Communist 
Party’s 
failure 
to 
contain 
the 
coronavirus, the Chinese Communists 
kicked three of the paper’s reporters 
out of the country. 
The Chinese Communist Party’s de-
ception has been so thorough that its 
rare moments of candor, however obvi-
ously helpful, have been quickly sup-
pressed and punished. 
When the number of reported infec-
tions spiked upward due to an improve-
ment in data reporting, the party 
purged local officials who were likely 
responsible. 
After Chinese scientists gave the 
world a headstart in developing a vac-
cine by publishing the disease’s genome 
online, what happened? Were they 
given awards? Were they celebrated? 
No. Their lab was shut down the very 
next day. These scientists deserved 
awards. They deserved a medal. In-
stead, they were given a professional 
death sentence. 
The Chinese people have suffered 
greatly from this coronavirus. They 
are, in fact, the first and the worst vic-
tims of their own Communist govern-
ment. But now the whole world is suf-
fering with them. Just as the Bubonic 
plague spread to Europe via traders on 
the Silk Road, the Wuhan coronavirus 
is traveling China’s new Silk Road. It 
turns out that the Belt and Road Ini-
tiative exports not just China’s money 
and Chinese debt but China’s viruses as 
well as its repression. It threatens not 
only economies around the world; it 
threatens peoples around the world. 
Right next door to China, Iran is suf-
fering a devastating outbreak of the 
coronavirus. Birds of a feather flock to-
gether, I would have to add. The 
mullahs in Tehran have emulated the 
Chinese Communist Party’s shameful 
response to coronavirus, first denying 
and then downplaying the outbreak 
until it was no longer possible to ig-
nore the bodies stacking up in clinics, 
a 
mysterious 
sickness 
spreading 
through the Cabinet of Iran’s Govern-
ment itself. 
Remember the suffering people in 
these countries when you hear trium-
phant, 
self-congratulatory 
messages 
coming from Chinese propaganda rags 
like Global Times and China Daily—or 
even the World Health Organization, 
which, I have to say, seems more inter-
ested in protecting the feelings of the 
Chinese Communist Party than pro-
tecting the health of people around the 
world. China’s propagandists are re-
portedly hard at work on a book exon-
erating Chairman Xi for his negligent 
response to this virus. 
The 
official 
line 
is 
that 
the 
coronavirus is contained and China is 
back to work, but don’t believe it. Do 
not believe the hype. The Chinese Com-
munist Party lied from the very begin-
ning of this outbreak, and it is lying 
still. It is responsible for the scale of 
this virus outbreak around the world. 
This outbreak didn’t happen in spite of 
the Chinese Communist Party’s efforts 
to contain it; it happened because of 
the Communist system of government. 
Three months later, we still don’t 
know how many people have been in-
fected or killed by coronavirus on the 
Chinese mainland. All we have are 
bogus statistics that just so happen to 
track 
perfectly—perfectly—with 
the 
Communist Party line day after day. 
I will cite just one example. Barron’s, 
the financial publication, discovered 
that the official number of deaths 
could be predicted perfectly in ad-
vance—in advance—in China using a 
simple mathematical formula. This 
coronavirus isn’t just contagious and 
deadly; it is good at math as well—if 
you believe the Chinese Communist 
Party. But that doesn’t just happen in 
nature. They are obviously cooking 
their books. It is not hard to see why. 
China’s economy has ground to a halt. 
The Chinese Communist Party is des-
perate to restart it and avoid the first 
contraction in the last 30 years, what-
ever it may cost in lives of the Chinese 
people. If China is truly back to work, 
as the Chinese Communists claim, it is 
only because it has employed Com-
munist tactics that evoke the worst 
horrors of Soviet communism, from 
Stalin’s 5-year plans to Leningrad in 
1943. 
After shutting down almost half the 
country’s factories to stop the spread 
of coronavirus, the Chinese Communist 
Party is opening them again, barely 1 
month later. Investors around the 
world beware: That decision is moti-
vated not by confidence but by despera-
tion. It will almost certainly lead to 
more outbreaks as workers congregate 
on crowded subways and factory floors, 
all because the Chinese Communist 
Party mandarins, living safely behind 
armed guards and walls in Beijing, de-
cided that hitting their growth target 
was more important than the peasants’ 
lives. 
When I first called for travel restric-
tions on China back in late January, 
Dr. 
Li 
was 
still 
alive 
and 
the 
coronavirus was, thankfully, far from 
our shores. Tragically, it is now a glob-
al disease, and we have to do all we can 
to arrest its spread. 
The most vital thing China can do is 
still be fully open and transparent 
about the origins and extent of the 
coronavirus. 
I say to the Chinese Communist 
Party: Stop hiding behind your fake 
numbers and politically correct bu-
reaucrats at the World Health Organi-
zation. Let truly independent experts 
into Wuhan to investigate this virus. 
The United States has offered repeat-
edly—repeatedly—to send a team and 
would do so tomorrow if you would just 
have the humanity to let them in and 
help save your own people. 
Finally, give those people the free-
dom to speak candidly about the dis-
ease that has devastated your nation. 
Do not stifle the next whistleblower, 
the next doctor or nurse who speaks up 
to save the lives not just of their own 
people but of the people around the 
world. 
Here in America, only time will tell 
how this virus will run its course. We 
have many advantages, though, to help 
us in this fight. We have the world’s 
best doctors, nurses, and healthcare 
professionals. As important, we live in 
a republic that protects the liberty of 
our citizens and gives every American 
the freedom to speak, to write, to dis-
sent, to sound an alarm—loudly sound 
an alarm—when we see something that 
isn’t right and we think we can make 
it right. 
Tragically, for himself, for his fam-
ily, for the world, Dr. Li Wenliang en-
joyed no such freedom. Yet he still 
spoke up to try to save his neighbors 
and to save the world. For that he was 
punished, and now he has passed. 
May he rest in peace, and may his 
memories inspire other selfless heroes 
who will speak truth and hold the Chi-
nese Communist Party to account, no 
matter the cost. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. ROM-
NEY). 
The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask

The 
PRESIDING

(Mr. 
PERDUE). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
BIPARTISAN BACKGROUND CHECKS 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, on aver-
age, we lose 100 Americans every single 
day to firearms. 
Last week marked 1 year since the 
House of Representatives passed H.R. 8. 
It was a bipartisan bill. Both Demo-
crats and Republicans supported it. 
The bill stood for a very basic propo-
sition, and the proposition is this: 
Whatever your constitutional rights or 
God-given rights—if you make that ar-
gument—to a firearm might be, we as a 
society cannot allow people who are 
convicted felons or who are shown to 
be mentally unstable to legally buy 
firearms in this country. We are sup-
posed to have background checks to 
make sure this doesn’t happen. It turns 
out that more than one out of five fire-
arms are sold in America without there 
having been background checks on the 
purchasers. 
So H.R. 8, this bipartisan bill, passed 
the House to close the gaps in our 
background system. What kind of gaps 
are we talking about? We have terrible 
gun violence in the city of Chicago. 
Some of the critics of Chicago like to 
say: You have the toughest gun laws 
and the most gun deaths. Well, they 
don’t tell you the whole story. Many of 
those guns start off not in Chicago and

not in Illinois but at gun shows in 
Northwest Indiana, where they are sold 
sometimes in volume without there 
being any background checks made on 
the purchasers. 
It has been 1 year of nothing in the 
U.S. Senate in responding to this na-
tional crisis—not one thing. It is with-
in the power of the majority leader, 
Republican Senator MITCH MCCONNELL, 
of Kentucky, to at least let us address 
the issue and debate it. 
He has a majority. Nothing is going 
to pass here without Republican sup-
port. We know that. But don’t the 
American people deserve a debate? One 
man, the Republican majority leader, 
says no. He styles himself as the Grim 
Reaper of the Senate. He takes pride in 
the fact that he has killed hundreds of 
bills passed by the House that will 
never, ever see the light of day in the 
U.S. Senate. 
Well, I can tell the Senator from 
Kentucky that after attending so many 
funerals, after giving heartbreaking 
sympathy to the families of those who 
have lost their children and loved ones, 
after hearing about so many mass 
shootings—mass shootings that should 
shock 
our 
conscience—aren’t 
we 
shocked when people just go to a movie 
theater in Colorado and are gunned 
down as they watch a movie? Aren’t we 
shocked when a crowd in Las Vegas 
just wants to enjoy a country western 
concert and they are gunned down? 
Weren’t we shocked at a high school in 
Florida or a first grade classroom in 
Connecticut when mass shootings take 
place? 
What will it take, America? What 
will it take for this Senate, what will 
it take for this majority leader to real-
ize enough is enough? 
I 
believe 
in 
Second 
Amendment 
rights to bear arms for those who buy 
them legally, use them and store them 
responsibly, whether it is for self-de-
fense, sport, or hunting. But none of 
the people who come to me and argue 
this issue are arguing for convicted fel-
ons and mentally unstable people to 
buy a firearm. We need them to stand 
with us and to stand with law enforce-
ment, who are often the victims of 
these firearms, to make this a safer na-
tion. 
There are obvious gaps in the Federal 
gun laws that make it easy for felons, 
abusers, and mentally unstable people 
to get their hands on guns and hurt in-
nocent people. Loopholes in the back-
ground check system, like the gun 
show loophole I mentioned and one I 
haven’t mentioned—the loophole on 
the internet, where there is no real 
background 
check 
whatsoever—ac-
count for massive sales of firearms 
each year in the United States. 
The House-passed Bipartisan Back-
ground Checks Act would close these 
gaps in the background check system. 
Around 90 percent of Americans sup-
port the proposals in this bill—90 per-
cent of them. It is good enough for 
America, but not good enough for the 
Senate. 
Obviously, the majority leader needs 
to be persuaded, and 90 percent of 
America is not enough. It is a common-
sense, bipartisan step we should take, 
consistent with constitutional rights 
but consistent, as well, with common 
sense. 
I can’t explain why the Senate Re-
publicans will not take up a bipartisan, 
House-passed bill that is so overwhelm-
ingly supported, even by Republicans. 
There are literally hundreds of bills, 
which have passed the House of Rep-
resentatives, gathering dust on the 
Senate desk, and this is one of them. 
These bills deal with issues like reduc-
ing the cost of prescription drugs, pro-
tecting the pensions of working Ameri-
cans and retired Americans, securing 
our elections from foreign interference, 
and, of course, reducing gun violence. 
They all wait on the desk of the Sen-
ator who styles himself the Grim Reap-
er. 
There have been too many excuses 
for inaction. There is plenty of time, as 
you can tell, on the Senate floor for us 
to roll up our sleeves and actually leg-
islate, and when it comes to gun vio-
lence, the cost of inaction is dev-
astating—100 Americans a day. 
It is time for Senator MCCONNELL to 
call up H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Back-
ground Checks Act, and have this Sen-
ate actually debate an issue and actu-
ally vote on an issue that can make a 
real difference in America. 
S. 2657 
Mr. President, I will commend the 
majority leader and Senator MUR-
KOWSKI of Alaska for doing something 
that is out of the ordinary. There is a 
bill pending before the Senate on the 
issue of American’s energy policy. You 
see, last year on floor of the U.S. Sen-
ate—this deliberative body that has 
been honored throughout history for 
the great debates that have taken 
place here—last year, during the entire 
calendar year, the Senate considered 
only 22 amendments in the entire year. 
I have served here for a while. I can 
never remember a time when there was 
so little activity on the floor of the 
U.S. Senate. 
Well, I want to commend Senator 
MURKOWSKI. She has started us off this 
year, I hope, with an indication that 
things might change. 
This Energy bill before us is going to 
be hotly debated. I am not going to 
agree with every provision, but that 
isn’t required of it. What is required is 
to bring a measure forward, debate it, 
compromise where you can, and come 
up with the best product you can come 
up with. 
Congress has not passed major en-
ergy legislation since the year 2009. 
Over 10 years have passed. Has the en-
ergy picture in America changed in 10 
years? Of course. Has the environ-
mental picture changed? We know it 
has. 
President Obama, in 2009, in a stim-
ulus package, included critical tax 
credits for renewable energy like wind 
and solar. This week’s debate marks an 
opportunity to tackle a decadelong leg-
islative slump on these issues. 
The American Energy Innovation Act 
seeks to modernize our electrical grid, 
support research into advanced energy 
technology, and improve energy effi-
ciency in buildings across America. 
Through significant bipartisan effort, 
my colleagues have constructed a 
package that starts to address one of 
America’s most pressing issues—energy 
for our future. 
Although the bill contains provisions 
that support innovation and research 
at the Department of Energy, I have to 
say I think we can do more. We need 
more robust support for basic science 
research—the kind of research that 
costs too much and takes too long for 
private companies to undertake on 
their own. 
Time and again, whether it is new 
medicine, new medical devices, or new 
energy policy, the Federal Government 
has shown the real leadership in basic 
research. 
We are at risk of no longer leading 
the world in cutting-edge research be-
cause our generation is not adequately 
funding basic science. We are living off 
the achievements of previous genera-
tions. We are not leaving the world of 
our children and grandchildren better 
for the research we are doing today—at 
least not as much as we should. That is 
why I put forth an amendment to this 
bill to increase funding for the Depart-
ment of Energy’s Office of Science by 5 
percent real growth—that is 5 percent 
over inflation—each year for the next 5 
years. 
This amendment will provide more 
than $43 billion over 5 years for basic 
research in energy technology and 
close a funding gap that has stunted 
some 
of 
DOE’s 
most 
important 
projects. 
Think for a moment about electric 
vehicles. Commonly now, their range of 
mileage is 200 to 300 miles. What if we 
doubled or tripled that number? Would 
it change the attitude of the public 
about using electric vehicles and re-
ducing pollution? I think there is no 
doubt that it would. 
This investment in research will pay 
off. It will strengthen the Energy bill 
and help move us into the 21st century 
in a leadership position where the 
United States should be. 
While my amendment addresses one 
priority to enhance the American En-
ergy Innovation Act, a larger question 
remains. It is fundamental and basic: 
How does this bill on energy address 
the 
existential 
threat 
of 
climate 
change? We should ask that about 
every bill that comes across the floor— 
certainly a bill talking about the fu-
ture of energy. 
My colleagues have worked to im-
prove energy efficiency and fund inno-
vation. I support both of those efforts. 
But this bill does not honestly and ag-
gressively deal with climate change. 
Unfortunately, 
facing 
the 
global 
threat of warming will require more 
than just faith and technology. Cli-
mate change impacts every sector of

March 4, 2020 
American life. It is well past time that 
we deal with solutions that can prom-
ise our kids and grandkids a habitable 
planet. 
According to the climatologist in my 
State of Illinois, as a result of climate 
change, Illinois faces higher tempera-
tures and more frequent, intense rain-
fall than at any other time in our 
State’s history. That is over 200 years. 
Our farmers have seen it. Last year, 
increased precipitation between April 
and June literally crippled our farmers 
when it came to planting and left 
them, many times, with fields that 
were not productive. 
We have seen it in the city of Chi-
cago. In January, there were waves as 
high as 20 feet pummeling the Lake 
Michigan shoreline of Chicago and 
flooding our coastal communities. 
During the summer, record tempera-
tures in Chicago last year threatened 
the elderly with heat stroke and kept 
many kids behind doors. Even the 
Trump administration has seen it. De-
spite the President’s denial of climate 
change, people within his administra-
tion spoke up. 
In November of 2018, the ‘‘Fourth Na-
tional Climate Assessment’’ reported 
that American economic losses could 
reach hundreds of billions of dollars by 
the end of the century as a result of 
climate change. 
For decades, scientists have warned 
us about this threat, and now we can 
see it in our lives almost every day. 
As the Senate considers energy legis-
lation, we do the American people a 
great disservice by failing to seriously 
address climate change. That is why I 
have been working on an approach that 
I think has some promise. 
Let’s look back at history, to the 
1930s. The United States faced a dif-
ferent existential crisis called the 
Great Depression. At that time, Frank-
lin Delano Roosevelt established the 
Reconstruction Finance Corporation. 
This was an agency that issued low-in-
terest loans and harnessed investment 
across the economy. The RFC, as it 
was known, became a critical lifeline 
for the U.S. economy, and its catch-all 
approach to investment spurred us into 
a recovery. 
Though climate change represents a 
different set of challenges than the 
Great 
Depression, 
the 
RFC 
model 
shows us an example of a broad strat-
egy 
needed 
to 
combat 
existential 
threats to our Nation. We need to take 
immediate action to decrease green-
house 
grass 
emissions 
and 
limit 
human-induced global warming. 
According to the EPA, in 2018, the 
United States emitted more than 5.2 
billion tons of carbon dioxide—a 3.2- 
percent increase over the previous 
year. We are moving in the wrong di-
rection. 
Clearly, this administration’s strat-
egy of removing the United States 
from the Paris climate accord and 
skirting around climate change is one 
that is not helping us address this issue 
successfully and effectively. Tackling 
this issue requires an immediate reduc-
tion in carbon emissions, massive in-
vestments in resilience and clean en-
ergy technology, and a willingness to 
take this threat seriously. 
Climate change makes the normal 
disasters in America that much worse. 
It increases their frequency and their 
intensity, and it is devastating to the 
most vulnerable people and businesses 
in America. 
I support efforts like the bill before 
us—the American Energy Innovation 
Act—that take small steps toward ad-
dressing climate change, but this prob-
lem calls for a much larger commit-
ment, not just by the Senate and the 
House and by the President, but cer-
tainly by the American people. We 
have it within our power, if we have 
the will, to deal with this challenge. 
Research, technology, and a willing-
ness to make a sacrifice for future gen-
erations is all it takes. We can put that 
package together on a bipartisan basis. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, the 
American 
people 
are 
apprehensive 
about the spread of the coronavirus in 
the United States and abroad, as we 
can always remember. Global financial 
markets are on edge. Both are resil-
ient, but vigorous action, I believe, is 
needed to calm nerves, stabilize the 
situation, and get our arms around this 
crisis. I believe Congress must marshal 
the resources necessary for an aggres-
sive, comprehensive, and swift re-
sponse. 
I am pleased to report to my col-
leagues this afternoon that we, with 
the House and leadership on both sides, 
have reached a bipartisan, bicameral 
agreement on an emergency supple-
mental appropriations package to do 
just that. The agreement provides a 
surge in funding at every level, as I 
have advocated for—local, State, Fed-
eral, and international—to meet the 
growing challenge that we face. 
The total amount included in the 
package is $7.76 billion, a little under 
$8 billion. We arrived at that figure by 
going back to the agencies—the NIH, 
the Centers for Disease Control, and so 
forth. We asked: What do you need? 
What do you think you would need if 
this virus really spreads? We wanted to 
make sure that they had the tools and 
the resources and that we would not 
shortchange the American people in 
any way. 
So the $7.76 billion, we have been told 
by the people who know, should be suf-
ficient. We hope it is. Nearly 85 percent 
of this funding will be spent right here 
in the United States—85 percent. And 
$2.2 billion is for the Centers for Dis-
ease Control, which the Presiding Offi-
cer is very familiar with because it is 
located in Atlanta, GA, including, no 
less than $950 million—just short of a 
billion—to help States and local gov-
ernments prevent and combat the 
spread of the virus. 
Now, $836 million will go to the Na-
tional Institutes of Health to, among 
other things, train healthcare workers 
on 
the 
frontlines 
and 
to 
develop 
diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines 
related to the virus. And $61 million 
will support the Food and Drug Admin-
istration’s role in approving such prod-
ucts for the American people. 
Now, $3.1 billion of this package is 
for the Public Health and Social Serv-
ices Emergency Fund, among other 
things, to supplement the Strategic 
National Stockpile here; to develop 
and purchase diagnostics, therapeutics, 
and vaccines; to provide resources for 
community health centers; and to help 
hospitals and help systems adapt and 
respond if this crisis grows. 
Another $300 million is made avail-
able for the purchase of additional 
diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines, 
should further need arise—in other 
words, a contingency. 
Finally, to fight the spread of the 
virus abroad, which we have to do, $1.25 
billion is provided to the State Depart-
ment and USAID to continue their 
work with our international partners. 
We have listened carefully to the 
agencies 
and 
the 
experts 
on 
the 
frontlines in crafting this package. 
Vice President PENCE has also been 
very helpful in this effort, and I appre-
ciate President Trump’s eagerness to 
sign this legislation. 
I also take a moment to thank Lead-
ers MCCONNELL
and SCHUMER, Vice 
Chairman LEAHY of the Appropriations 
Committee, Chairwoman LOWEY, chair 
of the House Appropriations Com-
mittee, and Ranking Member GRANGER 
for all of us coming together to do the 
right thing for the American people. 
We face this crisis together. We are 
fighting it together. Ultimately, I be-
lieve we will prevail together, but now 
is the time for action. The House will 
act first. All indications are they will 
pass it swiftly—this package. I hope so. 
When this package arrives in the 
Senate, I would urge my colleagues to 
do the same so we can get help to those 
who need it and ease some of the anx-
iety stemming from this outbreak. I 
think we owe it to the American people 
to do no less. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask

the quorum call be rescinded. 
The

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1459 
March 4, 2020 
have worked so hard together on the 
Appropriations 
Committee 
on 
the 
emergency coronavirus supplemental 
request. I have always enjoyed working 
with Chairman SHELBY, and I am 
pleased we can announce that we have 
reached a bipartisan, bicameral agree-
ment on an emergency supplemental to 
address 
the 
spread 
of 
the 
novel 
coronavirus and protect the health and 
safety of the American people. So I 
thank my friend Chairman SHELBY, 
Chairwoman LOWEY of the other body, 
and Ranking Member GRANGER
for 
their cooperation. 
I think one of the things I found dur-
ing my time on the Appropriations 
Committee is that we tend to leave our 
labels at the door. We worked together. 
We did not see each other as Repub-
licans and Democrats. We looked at 
each other as Members of the House 
and the Senate trying to get this done. 
I urge both the majority leader and the 
Democratic leader to move as quickly 
as possible, once the House acts today, 
to get this agreement to the Presi-
dent’s desk. 
As I said last weekend, there is no 
reason why we cannot and should not 
finish this bill this week and get it 
down to the President for signing. If we 
have to work Friday or even Saturday, 
let’s get it done and get it done now. 
Now, what the House of Representa-
tives is debating today is vastly dif-
ferent from the $1.25 billion grossly in-
adequate proposal from the Trump ad-
ministration that was sent to Congress 
just 9 days ago. This was so poorly 
thought out that both Republicans and 
Democrats said it made no sense. 
Where President Trump’s proposal 
would rob Peter to pay Paul by steal-
ing hundreds of millions of dollars from 
funds meant to contain an ongoing 
Ebola crisis and take money from pro-
grams the American people rely on, 
like the low-income heating assistance 
program, LIHEAP, our agreement pro-
vides $7.8 billion in new emergency 
funding to address this crisis without 
raiding these important programs. We 
cannot just turn our backs on funding 
to address the ongoing Ebola crisis. 
And millions of Amricans rely on 
programs like LIHEAP. I would invite 
any of those from the White House who 
think we do not need this heating as-
sistance in places like my home state 
of Vermont, where just a few days ago 
it was 10 below zero. 
Our agreement does not rob Peter to 
pay Paul. We are not stealing hundreds 
of millions of dollars from funds meant 
to contain an ongoing Ebola crisis but 
simply providing $7.8 billion in new 
emergency funding to address this cri-
sis without raiding those important 
programs. 
We also include a $500 million author-
ization to enhance the availability of 
telehealth 
services—something 
that 
could be so helpful in virtually every 
one of our States. 
We also reject the President’s ex-
treme ‘‘America First’’ mantra that 
would include nothing for USAID to 
help 
contain 
the 
spread 
of 
the 
coronvirus abroad. Let’s be realistic. 
At a time when communicable diseases 
are only an airplane flight away, that 
is a recipe for failure. If we can stop 
this before it gets to our borders, why 
shouldn’t we work with other countries 
to do that? So, we instead provide $1.25 
billion in new resources for the global 
health response, provide humanitarian 
assistance, and secure funding for 
emergency evacuations of U.S. citizens, 
if needed. 
We provide $2.2 billion to support 
Federal, State, and local public health 
agencies to prevent, prepare for, and 
respond to the coronavirus. The funds 
will support laboratory testing and 
monitoring, infection control, and pub-
lic health preparedness. Again, we are 
taking this completely out of politics 
and going to where our best people are 
who need the resources to address this 
crisis. I talked about some of the need 
for help with the Governor of our 
State, who is a Republican, and we 
worked very, very closely together. I 
applaud what he has been doing to pre-
pare for this virus. 
Our agreement is going to provide 
more than $3 billion for research and 
development of vaccines, therapeutics, 
and diagnostics to prevent or treat the 
effects of coronavirus. We are going to 
include provisions to ensure that vac-
cines developed with the support of 
Federal dollars—our tax dollars—re-
main affordable to those most in need. 
The taxpayers pay for it. They should 
not have to pay for it a second time be-
cause a large company wants to make 
a huge profit. In fact, we provide near-
ly $1 billion for healthcare prepared-
ness, the procurement of pharma-
ceuticals and medical supplies and 
funding to support community health 
centers, which provide healthcare to so 
many in our underserved urban areas 
and rural communities. 
We provide $61 million to the Food 
and Drug Administration to facilitate 
the development of new therapies and 
vaccines to combat the coronavirus but 
also to mitigate the potential medical 
supply chain interruptions. 
Importantly, this agreement includes 
$7 billion in small business disaster 
loans. What is happening can really hit 
the small businesses, which are the 
backbone of America’s economy. We 
have this money, the small business 
disaster loans, to help mitigate the 
economic impact of the spread of the 
coronavirus in the United States. 
When we confront this widening cri-
sis, it is important to remember that 
we are not doing it as Republicans or 
Democrats seeking to score political 
points in addressing this threat. It is 
not something for the Republican 
Party or the Democratic Party to deal 
with. We should deal with it as who we 
are. We are Americans, and we are U.S. 
Senators. One hundred of us have to 
speak to our own conscience. At times 
of crisis in our Nation’s history, the 
Senate has proven its ability to be the 
conscience of the Nation and a steady 
guiding hand. That is what we have to 
do now. 
I am pleased that the House measure 
does not include legislation related to 
extending FISA, the Foreign Intel-
ligence Surveillance Act. We have had 
months to deal with that controversial 
legislation. It has no place on urgent 
funding legislation to combat the cur-
rent health situation. 
I am confident we can, once again, 
put aside partisan squabbles and help 
to lead our Nation forward. Taking up 
this agreement as soon as possible is 
the first step. 
I will work with Chairman SHELBY. 
The two of us will work together to 
shepherd this bipartisan, bicameral 
agreement through the Senate and to 
the President. 
I would note—and I will speak fur-
ther on this later on—that there are an 
awful lot of members of our staffs, both 
Republican and Democratic, who have 
worked and worked and worked late 
nights, worked weekends, and worked 
on days off to get us here. I applaud the 
men and women who have done that. 
I see my distinguished colleague on 
the floor, so I will yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
AMERICA’S TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE 
ACT 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today to address 
America’s aging roads and bridges. 
Our highways are in need of repair all 
across the country. In some places, we 
actually need to rebuild new roads. 
That is why I, along with Senators 
CARPER, CAPITO, and CARDIN, have in-
troduced America’s Infrastructure Act. 
This bipartisan legislation is going to 
make a significant investment in our 
roads, in our bridges, and in our tun-
nels. It will fund our highways at his-
toric levels. 
These investments are critical, but 
just as critical is speeding up govern-
ment’s approvals for important road 
projects. 
Last Congress, the Environment and 
Public Works Committee, which I 
chair, heard testimony about a high-
way project in my home State of Wyo-
ming. The project took a decade—a full 
10 years—to get the required permits— 
one after another after another—but 
then it only took a couple of months to 
get the project done. It is a project 
that is going to make our roads safer 
and more efficient, which was the 
whole desired effect of this project. It 
was held up because of 10 years of wait-
ing for Washington permits. A decade 
to permit, months to build—any Amer-
ican with common sense knows that is 
absurd. America’s Transportation In-
frastructure Act cuts through Wash-
ington redtape so projects can get done 
faster, better, cheaper, and smarter. 
That is key. 
We used President Trump’s One Fed-
eral Decision policy as a model. It is a 
great plan, a great policy put forward 
by the President. Under the policy, the 
President has set a goal for his admin-
istration of completing environmental

reviews within 2 years. It is a goal I ab-
solutely applaud. Our legislation will 
codify key elements of that policy into 
law. 
The bill will streamline duplicative 
requirements by many different Fed-
eral agencies on the same project. The 
permitting process will be simplified 
and will occur faster. 
Our bill also gives States increased 
flexibility—something States want. So 
Federal approvals can get moving and 
the project construction can get start-
ed sooner. It reduces the amount of pa-
perwork needed from States to com-
plete the projects. It is unacceptable 
that the Federal Government would 
hold up State projects and put drivers 
at 
risk. 
Washington 
should 
never 
prioritize paperwork, which is what 
Washington tends to do—prioritize pa-
perwork over people’s safety. 
America’s Transportation Infrastruc-
ture Act cuts redtape. It makes safety 
a top priority. 
Our legislation is bipartisan, passing 
the Environment and Public Works 
Committee unanimously, 21 to 0. 
President Trump called on Congress 
to pass the bill. He did it during his 
State of the Union Address last month. 
This legislation is a win for the en-
tire country. The time is now to pass 
America’s Transportation Infrastruc-
ture Act so we can reduce the pun-
ishing and costly regulations and then 
do the important work of improving 
highway projects so that they can get 
built. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. COT-
TON). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 8 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I am 
coming to the floor today as we have 
just passed the 1-year mark since H.R. 
8, the Bipartisan Background Checks 
Act, passed the House of Representa-
tives. This is a piece of legislation sup-
ported by 90 percent of the American 
public. It is hard for anything to enjoy 
90 percent support in this country 
these days. 
The data shows us that this is a piece 
of legislation that, if enacted, would 
save lives. We have begged and pleaded 
for this piece of legislation to come be-
fore the Senate. I understand that 
there may not be 60 votes in the Senate 
to pass the exact piece of legislation 
supported by the House, but we could 
engage in a process of amendment, a 
process of compromise, and that could 
end up saving lives and getting a piece 
of legislation passed that is supported, 
as I mentioned, by 9 out of 10 Ameri-
cans. 
I have some remarks after what I ex-
pect will be an objection to my motion 
from the majority party. 
I will ask unanimous consent of my 
colleagues that the Senate proceed to 
the immediate consideration of Cal-
endar No. 29, H.R. 8, the Bipartisan 
Background Checks Act; I further ask 
that the bill be considered read a third 
time and passed, and the motion to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table, with no intervening ac-
tion or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Wyoming. 
Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, if this unanimous 
consent were passed without a vote or 
even debate, that would become law. 
Passage of this request could infringe 
on the constitutional right of my con-
stituents and many others across the 
United States. I believe firmly that 
would be the case and could even result 
in criminal charges against law-abid-
ing firearms owners. So I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Connecticut. 
Mr. MURPHY. I am sorry to hear the 
objection. It is obviously not sur-
prising. We have been waiting for a 
year for this body to act on the issue of 
gun violence. And though there are a 
range of measures that may actually 
be controversial, this is not one of 
them. This is not one of them. 
It is really hard to find folks in 
America who object to the idea that 
somebody should have to prove that 
they are not a criminal, that they 
don’t have a history of serious mental 
illness, before they purchase a firearm. 
The fact is, the longer we wait, the 
more people die. There is no piece of 
legislation that is going to eliminate 
every single gun death in this country. 
In my State of Connecticut, when we 
passed 
the 
universal 
background 
checks law, we saw an immediate 40- 
percent reduction in gun homicides. 
In Missouri, when they repealed their 
universal background checks law, they 
saw an immediate 25-percent increase. 
That is the short-term immediate 
rate of return—both on the upside and 
the downside—you get when you take 
steps to ensure that criminals don’t get 
guns or you take steps to make it easy 
for criminals to get guns. 
Senator BLUMENTHAL is on the floor 
with me as well, and he will make re-
marks. I have been unable to persuade 
my colleagues, based on the data, that 
we should pass background checks—the 
data being the broad public support for 
the measure, the data being about the 
impact on people’s lives that this piece 
of legislation would have. 
I want to make the case that, just 
from the simple standpoint of human-
ity, we should care about listening to 
the American public and passing legis-
lation that will reduce these numbers. 
This is heartbreaking. Some 39,000 peo-
ple a year are dying from gunshot 
wounds, with 3,011 on average a month 
and 100 a day. 
The majority of these are suicides, 
but the data tells us that by making it 
harder for people to buy guns who 
shouldn’t have them because of a seri-
ous history of mental illness or because 
of their criminal background, you will 
have less suicides. Many of these are 
homicides, and many of these are acci-
dental shootings. All of them are pre-
ventable by better policy. 
Remember, 
this 
happens 
in 
the 
United States and nowhere else in the 
advanced-income world. It is not be-
cause we have more mental illness in 
the United States. There is no evidence 
of that. It is not because our kids play 
more video games in the United States. 
There is no evidence of that. It is not 
because we spend less money on law en-
forcement. There is no evidence of 
that. It is because this country is 
awash in illegal and dangerous guns. It 
is because we have made a choice to 
make it a lot easier for some to find a 
way to a lethal firearm to commit an 
act of violence. 
Every single one of the 100 persons 
who die every day is attached to fami-
lies and friends and neighbors. The 
data suggests that for everybody who 
is killed in a gun homicide, there are 20 
other people who experience some kind 
of life-altering, diagnosable trauma be-
cause of it. 
I want to tell you a few of these sto-
ries today—stories of people who over 
the last year have been among this sta-
tistic—40,000 people who died from gun-
shot wounds. In March 2019, 1 month 
after H.R. 8 got to the Senate, Shelby 
Verderosa was home with her 6-month- 
old daughter when she was shot and 
killed in Phoenix, AZ. As a new mom, 
Shelby ‘‘was doing everything she pos-
sibly could to make sure her daughter 
had the best life,’’ said her cousin. One 
month after H.R. 8 passed the Senate, 
she was shot and killed when she was 
home with her 6-month-old daughter. 
Lamar Sharp was at a picnic in Kan-
sas City in April—2 months after H.R. 
8 got here to the Senate—when he 
heard gunshots. Instead of running 
away from the gunshots toward safety, 
he ran to save his friend’s 2-year-old 
grandson, and he was shot three times. 
He died 5 days before his 32nd birthday, 
2 months after H.R. 8 got to the Senate 
floor. 
In May, 3 months after the back-
ground checks bill got to the Senate, 
three LGBTQ+ young people were shot 
in Detroit. Alunte Davis, Timothy 
Blancher, and Paris Cameron were 
known for being funny. They were 
known for being wildly charismatic. 
Police believe their sexual orientation 
and gender identity were factors in 
their murders. 
A month later, 4 months after H.R. 8 
got here to the Senate, Durelle Moxley 
was killed on Father’s Day when a 
shooting broke out in his neighbor-
hood. Durelle and his wife had three 
young children. His friends said: 
He was really proud to be a father. He was 
pumped and he was really celebrating Fa-
ther’s Day.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1461 
March 4, 2020 
MITCH MCCONNELL’s desk, awaiting ac-
tion, Julianna Carr was killed by her 
brother in a murder-suicide at a house-
warming party in Katy, TX. She left 
behind a husband and two children 
whom she called her ‘‘greatest loves.’’ 
Jurnee Thompson was 8 years old 
when she was shot in August, 6 months 
after the Senate got H.R. 8—6 months 
of doing nothing on a bill with 90 per-
cent public support. Jurnee was the 
14th child to be shot and killed in St. 
Louis alone last summer. Her dad says 
losing her was ‘‘one of the biggest fears 
of my life and now I’m living it as a re-
ality.’’ 
In September, 7 months after H.R. 8 
showed up in the Senate and the Sen-
ate did nothing with it, Usher Hanns 
was 17 years old when he was shot and 
killed. He was a senior at Weaver High 
School in Connecticut. He was a mem-
ber of Hartford’s Proud Drill, Drum, 
and Dance Corp. His mom said he was 
‘‘a good son. He always made me smile. 
He’s a joyful kid.’’ 
Deirdre Zaccardi was murdered by 
her husband Joseph in Abington, PA, in 
October, 8 months after H.R. 8 got to 
the Senate. He also shot their three 
children, Alexis, Nathaniel, and Kath-
ryn, before turning the gun on himself. 
The Abington police chief said their 
deaths were ‘‘a horrific event no one 
should ever see.’’ 
Nine months after H.R. 8 got here in 
November, Gracie Ann Muehlberger 
was shot by a classmate with a semi-
automatic, untraceable ‘‘ghost gun’’ in 
Santa Clarita, CA. Hundreds attended 
Gracie’s memorial service. Her friends 
described her as an ‘‘independent spir-
it.’’ 
In December, 10 months after the 
House passed H.R. 8—10 months of 
doing nothing with it here in the Sen-
ate—Sergeant Chris Brewster was re-
sponding to a domestic violence call in 
Houston. When he got there, he was 
shot by a suspect fleeing the scene. He 
was a devoted husband who loved mak-
ing people laugh. Friends described 
him as ‘‘wonderfully weird.’’ 
In January, 11 months after H.R. 8 
got to the Senate, Gregory Rieves was 
killed. He had retired after 22 years as 
a State trooper, a career that he called 
his dream job. He was killed in Illinois. 
His friends described him as ‘‘the most 
gentle, kind-hearted person you could 
ever know.’’ 
In February of this year, two sisters, 
Abbaney and Deja Matts, were shot by 
Abbaney’s ex-boyfriend in a dormitory 
in Commerce, TX. ‘‘I just want people 
to know they were fun,’’ said their 
mom. 
Just last week in Milwaukee, almost 
exactly a year since H.R. 8 came to the 
Senate, five people were shot on the 
campus of Molson Coors. People who 
went to work on a normal Wednesday 
and whose families will never get to 
hug them or tell them goodbye or hear 
their voices again were shot and killed 
in a workplace shooting. 
Senator BLUMENTHAL and I are not 
going to give up. We are not going to 
give up because of what we have been 
through in Connecticut, having experi-
enced and lived through the aftermath 
of the horrific shooting in Sandy Hook, 
but also because of what we see hap-
pening every single day in places we 
represent—murders 
that 
happen 
in 
Hartford 
and 
Bridgeport 
and 
New 
Haven, murders that happen in rural 
areas of our State, as well—accidental 
shootings, 
homicides, 
suicides. 
No-
where else, other than in the United 
States, does this epidemic of carnage 
happen at this rate. It happens because 
we have made a choice. We have made 
a choice to let the gun industry run 
Washington, DC, to give them veto 
power over gun policy that has helped 
their bottom line, that has made gun 
company executives rich. But it has re-
sulted in 40,000 people a year dying—100 
a day. 
I will continue to come to the floor 
and tell the stories of those who have 
been lost. I am deeply sorry that when 
we try to bring up unanimous consent 
requests to the Senate to have a debate 
or a vote on H.R. 8, we keep hearing ob-
jections. 
We don’t run the Senate. Democrats 
are not in charge. We don’t get to set 
the agenda. MITCH MCCONNELL, Senator 
MCCONNELL, does; Republicans who are 
part of leadership do. All you have to 
do is bring this bill to the floor. Let’s 
have a debate on an expanded back-
ground checks proposal. 
I get that the version of the bill that 
passed the House might not have 60 
votes here, but why don’t we try to find 
common ground? Why don’t we sit 
down and do what the Senate used to 
do and find compromise that makes the 
country a better place? The fact that 
we aren’t even trying to find bipartisan 
agreement on a background checks 
proposal is absolutely heartbreaking, 
not 
just 
to 
me 
or 
to 
Senator 
BLUMENTHAL; it is heartbreaking to the 
survivors and the family members of 
the folks who aren’t with us any 
longer. It is an insult to them that we 
are not even lifting a finger to try to 
make this country a safer place. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I 
am honored to join my colleague and 
friend, Senator MURPHY. 
First, let me thank him for his lead-
ership. We have worked together as a 
team. We have been partners in this ef-
fort from the very first days of our 
elections, and we were together at 
Sandy Hook on the afternoon of De-
cember 14, 2012, when we saw and met 
many of the families who suffered that 
absolutely unspeakable loss in an un-
imaginable tragedy that haunts us 
both to this day. 
Just this morning, as a matter of 
fact, I was with one of the dads, Mark 
Barden, who has turned his grief into 
tremendously positive work in our 
schools, forming an organization called 
Sandy Hook Promise, one of the nu-
merous grassroots organizations that 
has grown in the wake of that tragedy. 
Of course, Brady existed before Sandy 
Hook, but afterward, there was Sandy 
Hook Promise and Newtown Action Al-
liance. Connecticut Against Gun Vio-
lence expanded, Moms Demand Action, 
Students Demand Action, Everytown 
for Gun Safety, Gifford—the list re-
flects the outrage and fear of the 
American public against this epidemic. 
I am here to talk about an epidemic, 
a public health menace. Of course, we 
must do something to take effective 
action and do it promptly against 
coronavirus, COVID–19, which also re-
flects a threat to our health and safety. 
It has already killed Americans. It 
threatens to spread. There is a need for 
preparedness and honesty and truthful-
ness to the American public about the 
extent of the threat and about the need 
for action. 
Gun violence today in America—just 
today and every day in America—kills 
more than 100 people. That number re-
flects only the fatalities. It is no meas-
ure of the people who are injured, 
sometimes crippled for life, and often 
emotionally damaged. It fails to reflect 
the families who suffer those losses and 
the trauma that affects children who 
are truly innocent bystanders to the 
drive-by shootings in downtown Hart-
ford or Bridgeport or New Haven. 
Literally, no community in America 
is immune from this public health epi-
demic, this menace that afflicts Amer-
ica unlike any other country in the 
world. Globalization has affected many 
public health threats, as we are learn-
ing about coronavirus. But America is 
unique in the magnitude of its gun vio-
lence epidemic, as my colleague Sen-
ator MURPHY has said so well. 
The costs are not just in human lives 
and emotion. Even if you care nothing 
about the human condition, think 
about the dollars and cents—the costs, 
the medical care, and, of course, the 
talent and energy, the intelligence, the 
productivity that is lost literally every 
day in those 100 lives. There is no vac-
cine. There is no panacea. There is no 
magic cure for this epidemic. 
The bill that brings us here today is 
just one piece of legislation, one tool 
that is vitally necessary, but it is only 
one step. It will not solve all of the 
problems of gun violence, but we know 
it will save lives. We know it from our 
experience in Connecticut. We know 
this enforcement mechanism will keep 
guns out of the hands of dangerous peo-
ple. 
It adds no new prohibitions. It im-
poses no new categories of people who 
are prohibited from buying guns. Those 
categories and those prohibitions are 
already in the Federal law. This back-
ground check expansion to all sales— 
not just federally licensed deals but 
private sales, sales on the internet—is 
simply a way to enforce the existing 
prohibitions, which were supported, by 
the way, by the NRA when they were 
passed decades of ago. It simply makes 
those prohibitions real. 
I know, from my experience as a 
prosecutor over decades and as a State

S1462 
March 4, 2020 
attorney general, that the best laws on 
the books are dead letter if they are 
unenforced. That is really why 98 per-
cent of the American people, the vast 
majority of gun owners, and even NRA 
members support this legislation. It is 
a simple, commonsense way to enforce 
existing prohibitions that keep guns 
out of the hands of dangerous people. It 
is the least we can do for those victims 
of gun violence whose images and 
voices and faces are with their families 
still and many of them with us every 
day. 
We should be very clear—because this 
measure should not be oversold—that 
it will not alone solve the problem of 
gun violence. There are a variety of 
other measures. I have introduced the 
emergency risk protection order legis-
lation that would enable law enforce-
ment—local police or State and Fed-
eral law enforcement—to take guns 
away from people who are dangerous to 
themselves or others. That legislation 
would require a warrant, and it would 
enable the warrant to be eventually 
challenged in a court proceeding. It 
would provide due process, which would 
be particularly important in domestic 
disputes when an estranged intimate 
partner may have a gun or when there 
is suicide and self-harm is threatened. 
This has worked in Florida thousands 
of times, where it was passed most re-
cently, 
and 
in 
Connecticut. 
Con-
necticut was the first in the Nation to 
adopt an emergency risk protection 
order, and it has worked. 
Along with that law are safe storage 
measures. There is Ethan’s Law, which 
was named after Ethan Song, who was 
lost to his wonderful parents, Kristin 
and Michael Song. Ethan was visiting a 
friend whose parents failed to store 
their gun safely, and in that unimagi-
nable tragedy, he was lost. 
Of course, there are also other meas-
ures, like eliminating sweetheart deals 
that provide unique and virtually abso-
lute immunity to gun manufacturers. 
The Sandy Hook surviving families are 
seeking redress against the manufac-
turer of the gun that killed their 20 
children and 6 great educators. They 
are overcoming the obstacles imposed 
by the law that provides that immu-
nity to the gun manufacturers. 
Assault weapons bans, ammunition 
background checks, and high-capacity 
magazines are a series of measures that 
we should consider. It is not that every 
one of them is necessary, but every one 
of them can help to save lives. Not one 
of them alone will prevent all of these 
fatalities. 
The least we can do is debate H.R. 8, 
which has been language on the Senate 
floor now for a year without its being 
called for a vote. That is really uncon-
scionable. I know we use that word 
‘‘unconscionable’’ so frequently that 
perhaps it has lost its meaning, but if 
we have a conscience and if we have a 
belief and a conviction in the demo-
cratic process, we should at least give 
a vote to this measure that is life-
saving, that is supported by almost all 
of the American people, and that is op-
posed only by the NRA and a gun lobby 
that is diminishing in power. In fact, 
the NRA is crumbling from within be-
cause of a financial scandal and on the 
outside because its extreme, inflexible 
positions are untenable to an American 
public that sees the public health epi-
demic before us as a result of gun vio-
lence and says: Enough is enough. 
There is a movement that will even-
tually prevail. Whether it will win in 
this session—because we have been 
blocked again from unanimous consent 
by our Republican colleagues—I don’t 
know. I do know with certainty that it 
will prevail because these grassroots 
have grown and have created a move-
ment. The students of Parkland have 
created a movement. The Sandy Hook 
Promise, the Newtown Action Alliance, 
Brady, Giffords, and others have cre-
ated a movement. Like many move-
ments and social causes in this coun-
try—the civil rights movement being 
the best example—this is fuel and 
power and is led by young people who 
are saying with the most passion of all: 
Enough is enough. 
Every one of them and every one of 
us knows someone—a family member, a 
coworker, a co-student, a colleague— 
who has been affected by gun violence. 
Almost two-thirds of those 100 deaths 
every day are from suicide, so we know 
mental health has to be addressed and 
that we need to invest more in mental 
health diagnoses and treatments. 
Again, mental health diagnoses and 
treatments alone are not a solution. I 
have long spearheaded and advocated 
for mental health parity—more treat-
ment, more insurance coverage—but 
they alone will not solve the gun vio-
lence epidemic in this country. 
The fact is that the States that have 
universal background checks, accord-
ing to a recent study, have had 52 per-
cent fewer mass shootings than the 
States that have lacked them. It 
makes sense. Background check laws 
mean that 80 percent of the firearms 
acquired for criminal purposes can be 
stopped from being sold by unlicensed 
sellers. 
We in Connecticut have one of the 
strongest universal background checks 
on the books anywhere in the country. 
Yet we know guns have, really, no re-
spect for State borders. They cross 
State borders with impunity. They 
cause deaths in Connecticut even if 
they have been manufactured else-
where or have been sold in the South 
and have come via the Iron Pipeline to 
Connecticut or to New York or to New 
Jersey, which also has strong gun laws. 
This national public health epidemic 
demands a national—Federal—solution 
that protects our Nation. 
The Odessa shooting just this past 
August serves as a tragic reminder of 
the steep price that inaction exacts. 
The Odessa shooter failed a background 
check, but then he turned right around 
after he failed that background check 
from a licensed dealer and bought an 
assault-style rifle in a private sale. 
That private sale was not covered by a 
background check, and seven more in-
nocent people are dead as a result. 
On December 14, 2012, I promised the 
parents who lost loved ones at Sandy 
Hook and other families that I would 
fight and do everything I could to 
make sure that no more parents would 
have to bury their children. I have 
worked tirelessly, along with others, 
like my colleague Senator MURPHY and 
many of us on this side of the aisle, on 
public health and safety measures that 
would stop gun violence. I have also 
worked with Senator GRAHAM on an 
emergency risk protection order pro-
posal that has shown very serious signs 
of acceptance on that side of the aisle 
and even by the White House. So far, 
inaction has been the result. 
Since that day, December 14, 2012, 
there have been 2,389 mass shootings, 
not counting the individual lives lost 
in Hartford or in the suburbs or in the 
rural areas. It is an equal opportunity 
public health epidemic. Like any epi-
demic, no one is immune. Over 2,000 
times, families have had to wait, like 
the parents of Newtown, to see whether 
that morning’s kiss goodbye would be 
the last. They have had to wait to see 
whether that last wave at the school 
door would be the final one. That real-
ly is unconscionable in the greatest 
country in the history of the world. 
When I stood here in the months 
after 2012—in fact, in 2013—when we 
last voted on a universal background 
check bill, it was supported by a major-
ity of my colleagues. There were 54 
who voted for it, but it was not enough 
to reach the 60-vote threshold. 
From the Galleries, I heard one of 
those parents shout ‘‘Shame.’’ He was 
right. Shame on my Republican col-
leagues then, and shame on them now 
if they defy common sense and the will 
of the American people by preventing a 
vote—simply a vote. That is what we 
are asking for—a vote on H.R. 8. A year 
has passed since the House voted and 
approved this bill. Shame on them—my 
Republican colleagues—if they stand in 
the way of saving lives. Shame on them 
if they allow the carnage to continue 
on our streets, in our neighborhoods, 
and in our communities, crippling fam-
ilies and tearing apart those commu-
nities. 
The vicelike grip of the gun lobby is 
breaking, and there will be bipartisan 
collaboration. It will be the result of 
not my persuasion from speeches given 
on the floor but of the American people 
at the polls, because the ultimate court 
is the court of public opinion and be-
cause the ultimate voice here is that of 
the American people. 
In the military, there is a saying: 
‘‘The enemy has a vote.’’ Here, the en-
emies are the shooters, and the en-
emies are the opposers of these com-
monsense measures. We cannot allow 
them to have a vote. It is the American 
people who will vote, and they will 
hold accountable those colleagues who 
fail to be on the right side of this issue 
and on the right side of history.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1463 
March 4, 2020 
I urge my Republican colleagues to 
rethink, to revisit, to reconsider their 
staunch, unyielding, inflexible opposi-
tion to even having a vote. To them, I 
say: Do your job. We are here to vote 
and save lives. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
YOUNG). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
BROADBAND ACCESS 
Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I call 
the Senate’s attention this afternoon 
to a pair of bills that are critical to the 
deployment of broadband access across 
the United States and the worldwide 
race to 5G, which we, of course, hope to 
win and will win. 
The first of these measures will en-
sure 
that 
telecommunications 
net-
works are safe and secure from foreign 
intrusion. The second bill, which I hope 
the Senate will take up and pass even 
today by unanimous consent, would 
help create highly accurate broadband 
coverage data that will help expand ac-
cess to high-speed internet. Both of 
these measures are Commerce Com-
mittee priorities and are the result of 
extensive negotiations and work on a 
bipartisan and bicameral basis. 
Our economic and national security 
depend on nationwide access to high- 
speed internet that is safe and secure. 
The 
threat 
of 
foreign 
espionage 
through our broadband infrastructure 
is real, and it stems directly from the 
Chinese tech firms, like Huawei and 
ZTE. 
These companies are pawns of the 
Chinese Government. As a matter of 
fact, for all practical purposes, they 
are wholly owned entities of the Chi-
nese Government, and they are putting 
on a full-court press to establish their 
footprint in wireless networks around 
the world and right here in the United 
States. 
Huawei and ZTE receive massive sub-
sidies each year from the Chinese Gov-
ernment, and it is really beyond dis-
pute that they are doing the bidding of 
the Chinese Communist Party. 
Some of our allies have come to real-
ize this threat and have taken decisive 
action. I want to commend Australia, 
New Zealand, and Japan. They have all 
banned Huawei technologies from their 
networks. 
I am grateful that the Trump admin-
istration has shown strong leadership 
on this issue. 
Last year, the Department of Com-
merce placed Huawei on its Entity 
List, severely limiting its ability to do 
business with U.S. companies. That 
was a bold step, but, unfortunately, 
some of our networks had already been 
compromised by Huawei by the time 
the Commerce Department took ac-
tion. 
So last week, the Senate took a 
major step toward removing the Chi-
nese threat by passing the Secure and 
Trusted 
Communications 
Networks 
Act. 
This bill, which some refer to as the 
‘‘rip and replace’’ bill, would rip out 
the Huawei equipment and replace it 
with reliable equipment that will not 
engage in espionage. 
This legislation will lay the founda-
tion to give strong financial incentives 
to U.S. firms to strip out their Huawei 
and ZTE technology and replace it 
with secure alternatives. It will also 
help small, rural telecom providers 
transition away from firms that are 
controlled by Beijing. 
That bill is now on the President’s 
desk, awaiting his signature, and it 
may be that he is going to wait until it 
can be joined by the Broadband DATA 
Act, which, again, I say can be passed 
by this body as early as this evening, 
when we adjourn. 
In 
December, 
the 
Senate 
unani-
mously passed the measure, but be-
cause the House passed a slightly 
amended version of the bill yesterday, 
we need to act again today to get this 
bill across the finish line and on to the 
White House. 
The Broadband DATA Act addresses 
the Federal Communication Commis-
sion’s flawed maps, which the Pre-
siding Officer and I have been so con-
cerned about. Every year, the FCC 
spends billions of dollars to promote 
deployment of broadband across the 
United States. This funding is espe-
cially important for America’s rural 
communication, which so often lags be-
hind in broadband development. We 
have done a lot to close the digital di-
vide, but an estimated 20 million Amer-
icans still lack access to broadband. 
For years, Members from both par-
ties have noted that the FCC’s maps 
have overstated broadband coverage, 
thereby understating the problem. For 
example, for Mississippi, the FCC map 
claims that we have a 98-percent mo-
bile 
broadband 
coverage—something 
anybody can say from experience is not 
true. It is far from true. Without accu-
rate maps, the FCC cannot direct sup-
port to areas most in need. 
The Broadband DATA Act will fix 
this problem by creating a new data-
base of areas in need of service, requir-
ing providers to submit precise data, 
establishing specific standards for data 
collection, and allowing crowd sourcing 
to encourage public participation in 
the process. 
As a result, the Broadband DATA Act 
will also help target Federal funds to-
ward those areas most in need of as-
sistance. These steps will pave the way 
for more Americans across the heart-
land to exercise and to access high- 
speed broadband and to enjoy the eco-
nomic opportunities that come with 
that. 
Coupled with last week’s passage of 
the ‘‘rip and replace’’ legislation, Con-
gress has achieved an important vic-
tory for our country and national secu-
rity. 
In conclusion, I want to recognize the 
excellent work of my staff on the Com-
merce Committee, both the majority 
and the minority. 
I want to thank my friend and rank-
ing member, Senator CANTWELL, as 
well as Chairman PALLONE and Rank-
ing Member WALDEN of the House of 
Representatives on the Energy and 
Commerce Committee, as well as the 
members of their staff. Their efforts 
have gotten us to this point, ready for 
the President to put a signature on 
these two very important bills. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
HYDE-SMITH). The clerk will call the 
roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. BRAUN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 2590 
Mr. BRAUN. Madam President, the 
discovery of thousands of fetal remains 
in Indiana at an abortionist’s home 
last year horrified us all and high-
lighted a disturbing trend that Indiana 
has taken the lead in rectifying. 
This bill is our chance to fix the 
problem 
nationally. 
I 
believe 
all 
human life deserves a dignified burial, 
and fetal remains deserve to be treated 
with respect, not as medical waste. 
Sadly, irreverence toward fetal re-
mains, like Dr. Klopfer’s grotesque col-
lection, in our case, is not an isolated 
incident. For example, in 2015, a Min-
nesota hospital threw out the body of a 
stillborn baby with dirty laundry. 
Indiana has led the way. Governor 
MIKE PENCE signed a law in 2016 pro-
tecting the dignity of fetal remains, 
upheld by the Supreme Court last year 
in Box v. Planned Parenthood. 
This legislation, the Dignity for 
Aborted Children Act, builds on Indi-
ana’s success and provides guidelines 
for handling fetal remains and pen-
alties for failing to respect the sanctity 
of human life, and it ensures that 
crimes like Dr. Klopfer’s have con-
sequences. 
The bill would require abortion pro-
viders to dispose of the remains of un-
born children just as any other human 
remains or to release the remains to 
the family, should the family wish to 
receive them. This bill does not tell 
anyone what to do with their body. It 
only holds human fetuses to a higher 
standard 
of 
dignity 
than 
medical 
waste. 
Last week, this body could not agree 
to ban abortions after science tells us 
fetuses are capable of feeling pain. This 
body could not agree to ensure that ba-
bies born alive after botched abortions 
should receive the same standard of 
care as a baby born in a hospital. 
At the very least, we should be able 
to agree to treat the remains of unborn 
children with the reverence befitting a

human life rather than as medical 
waste. 
Given this, I ask unanimous consent 
that the Committee on Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions be dis-
charged from further consideration of 
S. 2590 and the Senate proceed to its 
immediate consideration. 
I ask unanimous consent that the bill 
be considered read a third time and 
passed and that the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object, we have a 
serious public health crisis on our 
hands right now, and we expect it to 
get much worse. Right now, families 
across this country are actually look-
ing to Congress to put partisanship 
aside and put their needs first and are 
counting on us to listen to experts and 
make decisions that are guided by 
science, not by ideology. 
They need to know that our No. 1 pri-
ority and what we should be talking 
about is public health today. 
Instead of discussing this harmful 
bill that will gut reproductive rights, 
put unnecessary restrictions on med-
ical providers, and undermine medical 
research, which is an absolute non-
starter and the absolute last thing we 
should be doing right now, I think we 
should be focused on what families ac-
tually need us to be focused on, which 
is the coronavirus outbreak and what 
it means for them and what we are 
doing about it. 
The news of this virus is spreading 
throughout the country. The deaths, 
the illness, and the confusion it has 
caused in my home State of Wash-
ington 
and 
elsewhere 
are 
beyond 
alarming. The Trump administration 
has fallen far short of its responsibil-
ities to Washington State and to com-
munities nationwide. 
I am pleased Democrats and Repub-
licans in Congress were able to put par-
tisanship aside to hammer out the ro-
bust emergency supplemental funding 
agreement that was announced earlier 
today. It is an agreement that goes 
well beyond President Trump’s totally 
inadequate request in order to actually 
meet the needs we are hearing about 
from the officials on the frontlines of 
this crisis, like reimbursing States and 
local governments that have shoul-
dered the cost of this response so far or 
the need to support research so we can 
develop new treatments and diagnostic 
tests and vaccines and the need to 
make sure those are available to every-
one. 
This agreement helps us prepare for 
what is next by providing funding to 
shore up our store of medical supplies, 
support medical community health 
centers in underserved areas, and bol-
ster global health and public health 
preparedness programs. 
I am working to make sure we get 
that bill signed into law as soon as pos-
sible, and I will continue to follow it 
closely because experts have already 
made it very clear this is not going to 
be over soon. 
While the funding is a great first 
step, we need to make sure it is not the 
last one. It is very critical that we con-
tinue listening to our health experts, 
providing needed resources, and pre-
paring for what is next, including what 
this will mean for families’ day-to-day 
lives and for people who can’t take a 
day off work without losing a paycheck 
or don’t have affordable childcare if a 
school closes or don’t have health in-
surance or are experiencing homeless-
ness. 
I hope my Republican colleagues will 
think long and hard about what their 
priorities are in the midst of this and 
choose to refocus their energy on work-
ing with us to address the urgent issues 
of the day instead of distracting us 
from serious work and wasting time we 
don’t have. 
I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Indiana. 
Mr. BRAUN. Madam President, I 
think if we continue to make the argu-
ment with women’s healthcare that it 
is mutually exclusive to consider that, 
and you define what we are talking 
about here—banning abortions where 
there is pain-felt capability or not try-
ing to preserve the life of a baby born 
through a botched abortion—adding 
this as well: not treating the fetal re-
mains with the dignity that they de-
serve—I think it is increasingly dif-
ficult to make the argument that we 
constantly 
hear 
about 
women’s 
healthcare. They are not mutually ex-
clusive. 
This 
is 
something 
that 
shouldn’t be put into the category that 
it would impact any of that by putting 
this into effect. 
I yield floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 3259 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Foreign 
Relations Committee be discharged 
from further consideration of S. 3259 
and the Senate proceed to its imme-
diate consideration. I further ask that 
the bill be considered read a third time 
and passed and that the motion to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from New Hampshire. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, 
reserving the right to object, I am dis-
appointed that my colleague would try 
to codify a policy that has been proven 
to cause extensive harm to the most 
vulnerable women and families around 
the world. 
In the past 3 years, we have seen the 
global impact of this policy. Health 
clinics have closed, access to care has 
decreased, and lives are needlessly put 
at risk. When women in developing 
countries and other parts of the world 
don’t have access to family planning 
and information they need for women’s 
reproductive health, abortions actually 
increase rather than decrease. Re-
search shows that by decreasing access 
to information about modern contra-
ceptive options, abortion rates in-
crease. This policy doesn’t stop abor-
tions; it only limits the resources that 
are available that prevent women from 
having unwanted pregnancies. 
My Republican colleagues can call it 
whatever they want—the Protecting 
Life in Global Health Assistance pol-
icy, the Mexico City Policy—I call it 
dangerous and deadly. In fact, instead 
of protecting life, the global gag rule 
erects new barriers to critical health 
services, including reproductive health 
services, for people and communities 
who already have limited access to af-
fordable, high quality healthcare. 
Across U.S. global health assistance, 
we are seeing a breakdown in systems 
of health care provisions which dis-
proportionately impacts the most vul-
nerable, hard-to-reach populations. In 
Uganda, mobile health teams that go 
into communities and provide some-
times the only health care available 
are being cut. 
ABBEF, the International Planned 
Parenthood 
Federation 
member 
in 
Burkina Faso, was forced in 2017 to pre-
maturely end its U.S.-supported pilot 
initiative to distribute contraceptives 
in secondary schools where there is a 
huge family planning need. 
Marie Stopes International, MSI, re-
ceived 17% of its donor income from 
USAID at the time the global gag rule 
was reinstated. These funds were exclu-
sively used for voluntary contraception 
services and the loss of funding has im-
pacted 
work 
with 
poor 
and 
marginalized 
communities 
most 
in 
need of accessing services. 
Marie Stopes Ethiopia, with exper-
tise in reaching remote communities, 
ended its U.S.-funded program pro-
viding vasectomies and tubal ligations 
to rural populations. No other organi-
zation has the technical skills and ex-
pertise to provide the same quality of 
service and choice. 
Clearly this policy decreases care, in-
creases abortions, and risks the lives of 
women around the world. And this is 
not about abortion, this is about con-
trolling a woman’s body and limiting 
her choices. 
If we are actually going to get seri-
ous about improving women’s health, 
we should be working to end the global 
gag rule. 
Given the negative impact this policy 
has already had on so many women and 
families around the world, codifying it 
would just exacerbate those issues, so I 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, it is dis-
appointing that when we take a look at 
something that is controversial like 
abortion and we peel it back a layer 
further, we make it noncontroversial

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1465 
March 4, 2020 
by making the discussion about some-
thing that most Americans—the over-
whelming 
majority 
of 
Americans— 
agree about, which is, regardless of 
how you feel about abortion, you don’t 
necessarily want your government tak-
ing your taxpayer dollars and the tax-
payer dollars of a whole lot of people 
who have very strong feelings against 
abortion and using those to fund orga-
nizations that either perform abortions 
or that engage in promoting or lob-
bying or counseling or referring in 
order to encourage abortions. The over-
whelming majority of Americans don’t 
want that regardless of how they feel 
about life. 
This shouldn’t be a controversial 
issue. It is a non sequitur. It is a straw 
man argument to suggest that this 
somehow limits anyone’s options. It 
doesn’t. In fact, it expands options of 
individuals by saying: We are not going 
to take your money at the point of a 
gun, which is what governments do at 
the end of the day when they take 
money, in order to spend it on some-
thing that—depending on how you 
phrase the question and which pollster 
you are talking to, it is either a sizable 
majority or a bare majority of Ameri-
cans who find that morally problem-
atic. But an overwhelming majority of 
Americans say that, no matter what, 
you shouldn’t be taking all taxpayer 
money and then using that to fund 
abortion or abortion-related advocacy. 
Last week, the Senate had a chance 
to adopt some measures that would 
protect the dignity of human life—not 
just unborn human life but also born 
human life, including babies who had 
been born alive following a failed abor-
tion attempt. Unfortunately, due to a 
minority of this body, we lost the op-
portunity to enact those reforms. 
Those colleagues opposed to these 
measures did so largely on the claims 
that they were, as they put them, anti- 
woman or anti-healthcare. They claim 
somehow that these measures inter-
fered with what should be considered 
personal—the 
personal 
nature 
of 
healthcare between women and their 
doctors. 
I 
could 
not 
agree 
more 
that 
healthcare is personal. It is, after all, 
about healing, preserving, and pro-
longing the life of a human being, the 
life of a person. In the case of a preg-
nant woman, it is about two persons, 
sometimes three. If it is a woman who 
is pregnant with a single baby, it is 
two persons with two beating hearts, 
two distinct sets of DNA, and two 
unique 
and 
eternally 
valuable, 
unrepeatable souls—two persons with 
equal dignity and worth. We ought to 
value both of them and provide oppor-
tunity and care and rights and protec-
tion to both. 
In the spirit of our founding, we 
ought to affirm through our laws and 
through our taxpayer dollars the truth 
that every member of our society— 
every woman, every man, every unborn 
child—is entitled to the right to life 
and to the full protection of that right 
under the laws of the United States. 
Our healthcare ought to heal, preserve, 
and protect those lives. Unfortunately, 
many of our laws themselves permit 
and subsidize exactly the opposite of 
life in our country and even, tragically, 
abroad. 
Congress allows and helps fund the 
most radical abortion policy in the 
Western world, enabling procedures 
that impose barbaric violence upon 
women and unborn children and ending 
the lives of hundreds of thousands of 
innocent babies in our Nation every 
single year. It allows our foreign aid 
money to go to organizations that fund 
and promote abortions overseas, taking 
the lives of thousands of innocent ba-
bies across the globe—especially, by 
the way, baby girls. 
In some of these countries, abortions 
happen in much higher numbers to fe-
male babies precisely because they are 
female. Abortion is, in many cases, the 
knife’s edge of sexism—the exact tool 
they use to denigrate women’s equal 
dignity and value and worth and right 
to breathe. 
In some of these countries, women 
don’t even want the abortions. In some 
cases, these organizations force their 
own so-called enlightened values on 
them, pressuring these women to take 
their own children’s lives whether or 
not they really want to. This form of 
cultural and imperialism is not pro- 
woman, it is not pro-child, and it is 
certainly not pro-healthcare. It is pro- 
sexism and pro-violence. And we must 
end it. Today, we can, through the pas-
sage of the Protecting Life in Foreign 
Assistance Act. This bill would perma-
nently stop the use of our foreign aid 
money for funding or promoting abor-
tions overseas. 
We ought to uphold the equal dignity 
of women, whether born or unborn, in 
America and across the world, and we 
should treat their bodies with rev-
erence and dignity and respect, the re-
spect they deserve, not because any 
government decided to confer that re-
spect upon them but because they 
exist. Today, we can choose that, too, 
through Senator BRAUN’s bill, the Dig-
nity for Aborted Children Act. That 
measure, as Senator BRAUN
has ex-
plained, will ensure that aborted chil-
dren’s bodies are not treated simply as 
medical waste to be crudely disposed of 
and that they should instead receive a 
proper burial or cremation, just as we 
accord to all other human beings. 
We have to support and value women 
and babies everywhere. In our laws and 
for our lives, we ought to uphold the 
dignity of each and every human per-
son, regardless of race, sex, appearance, 
abilities, or age. The measures before 
us today—those I have outlined and 
those that have been proposed by Sen-
ator BRAUN—do just that, and we 
should support them for the very same 
reasons that we should pass them. 
They shouldn’t be objectionable. 
It is tragic that they have drawn an 
objection today. It is tragic that any 
American, much less any Member of 
the Senate, which calls itself the 
world’s greatest deliberative legisla-
tive body, would object to these meas-
ures. After all, it is difficult to fathom 
how someone wouldn’t want to protect 
babies. It is difficult to fathom why 
someone wouldn’t be in favor of some-
thing at least protecting the con-
science rights of U.S. taxpayers who 
don’t want to see their hard-earned 
taxpayer dollars going to fund an oper-
ation, a procedure that they know is 
designed to end a human life—a human 
life that in many cases is deliberately 
ended because of the sex of the person 
whose life is being taken. This is trag-
ic, it is unacceptable, and it shouldn’t 
happen—not here, not on this soil, not 
on our watch. 
We are not going to give up. The fact 
that we have endured these setbacks 
today, the fact that these well-con-
ceived, non-objectionable pieces of leg-
islation have drawn an objection today, 
doesn’t mean this issue is going to go 
away. It doesn’t mean these proposals 
are going to go away. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I 
want to talk to the Senate for a few 
minutes about refrigerators and air 
conditioners. Thank the Lord for both 
of them. They make our lives so much 
better, especially in the Presiding Offi-
cer’s home State of Mississippi and, 
certainly, in my home State of Lou-
isiana. 
Refrigerators and air conditioners 
and the like are able to keep people 
and things cold by using coolants or re-
frigerants, I think some people call 
them. I am going to call them coolants. 
Basically, I will not go into the chem-
istry and/or the physics, but when a 
coolant in liquid form is converted to a 
gas, it is called phase conversion. It ab-
sorbs heat. That is why you will hear 
people, including but not limited to re-
pair women and repair men, talking 
about coolant for an air conditioner or 
coolant for a refrigerator. It is that 
coolant that keeps us and our food 
cool. 
Years ago, we used to use a coolant 
called Freon. You probably have heard 
that term. It is seldom used today. 
There are some small occasions when it 
is used, but for the most part, we have 
decided Freon is not a good coolant, 
not because it doesn’t work but be-
cause it is very, very harmful to our 
environment. So a number of years 
ago, people the world over, including 
the U.S. Government, said: OK, we are 
not going to use Freon anymore. We 
are going to use another coolant, which 
we 
generally 
refer 
to 
as 
hydrofluorocarbons. If you hear me use 
the expression HFC or the acronym 
HFC, that is what I mean. 
So we went along and, instead of 
using Freon, we started using HFCs, 
hydrofluorocarbons. Then we discov-
ered—and by ‘‘we’’ I mean that most of 
the scientists throughout the world 
came 
to 
realize 
that

March 4, 2020 
hydrofluorocarbons or HFCs are not 
very good for the environment either. 
The people who made this decision, 
many of whom were American sci-
entists, decided we need to develop a 
third type of coolant other than Freon 
and other than HFCs to run our air 
conditioners and run our refrigerators 
and protect our environment at the 
same time. 
A few years ago, most of the coun-
tries throughout the world made this 
decision. The representatives of these 
countries got together and said: OK, 
you remember we decided to stop using 
Freon, and now we have been using 
these HFCs. Yet we have discovered 
these HFCs are also harmful, so we are 
going to agree—all of these countries 
said—to develop a third type of coolant 
that is not as harmful to our environ-
ment. 
That is the direction in which the 
world is headed. Within 5, 10, 15 years, 
not only will Freon be eliminated, but 
so will hydrofluorocarbons because the 
rest of the world is going to be using a 
third type of coolant, which has been 
developed and is being developed as we 
speak. 
There is just one problem. The 
United States has not agreed with 
those other countries. That is OK. That 
is our right to do it our way. But that 
presents yet another problem because 
in 5 or 10 or 15 years, we are going to 
look up, and we are going to be the odd 
person out. The rest of the world is 
going to be using this new technology, 
and we are still going to be using 
hydrofluorocarbons. We are going to be 
isolated, and it is going to cost our 
business community a lot of business, 
and it is going to hurt us. 
I and Senator TOM CARPER—a fine 
American and a good man—have a bill. 
It is called the American Innovation 
and Manufacturing Act—the Senator 
and I call it the AIM Act—and we have 
a lot of support. At last count, we had 
32 cosponsors—half Republican, half 
Democrat—and that number is rising 
as we speak. That is a third of the U.S. 
Senate. You can’t get a third of the 
U.S. Senate to agree on much of any-
thing except that they like ice cream, 
but for this august body, having 32 co-
sponsors is a big deal. 
Let me also say that we have a lot of 
support from the business community. 
For example—and I will not read all of 
the groups that are supporting it—the 
Air Conditioning, Heating and Refrig-
eration Institute is supporting this 
bill. It is in charge of our refrigerators 
and air conditioners, and it is saying: 
Yes, we want to do this. The environ-
mental community supports this bill. 
It is rare that we get both the environ-
mental community and the business 
community on the same page, but 
mainly through Senator CARPER’s in-
tellect and charm, we have been able to 
do that. 
As you know, we are in the process of 
considering an energy bill, and that en-
ergy bill is really an amalgamation of 
a lot of other bills that deal with en-
ergy that are going to be put together 
in one bill, ably handled by Senator 
MURKOWSKI. Senator CARPER
and I 
want to take our bill—the AIM Act, 
the American Innovation and Manufac-
turing Act, which is supported over-
whelmingly by the business commu-
nity and by the environmental commu-
nity—and add it to Senator MUR-
KOWSKI’s bill as an amendment, and 
that amendment has already been sub-
mitted. We have a lot of support for the 
amendment. The last time I looked, we 
had 28 cosponsors to the amendment, 
and once again, the business commu-
nity and the environmental commu-
nity are supporting it. 
The Presiding Officer is probably 
thinking, OK, KENNEDY. What is the 
problem? This is interesting, but what 
is the problem here? 
How can I put this? The problem is 
the way we operate. One person in the 
Senate can stop the entire Senate from 
ever voting on something, as we all 
know, and I am not going to go into 
the details. In some cases, that is not 
necessarily a bad thing. Our Founders 
intended the Senate to move carefully 
and slowly, but it is a bad thing, in my 
judgment, when it is used routinely to 
keep the Senate from having an up-or- 
down vote on something that is impor-
tant to the American people. 
I mean, the logical approach would 
be, OK, you don’t agree with the 
amendment. That is why God made 
rollcall votes. Let’s vote. You can vote 
yea or you can vote nay or you can 
jump the rail, but everybody gets to 
weigh in. That is why I was sent up 
here. My people sent me up here to de-
bate and decide. They didn’t send me 
up here to participate and delay in 
stultification. So that is my message 
today: Let my people vote. 
Once again, I understand there are 
rare occasions on which a Senator feels 
so strongly about something that he or 
she can and should exercise his or her 
right to prevent the whole body from 
considering something, but it has be-
come a routine political weapon. That 
is one of the reasons, in my judgment, 
that we don’t get more done in the 
Senate. 
I am not criticizing anybody. I am 
part of this body. If I am criticizing 
this body, I am criticizing myself. But 
doing nothing is hard because you 
never know when you are finished. We 
can do a lot more in this body, and I 
think we all understand that, and I 
think we can all agree with that. I 
think one of the reasons the Senate 
polls right up there with skim milk 
among the American people is that we 
don’t get more done, and one of the 
reasons we don’t get more done is that 
we are not allowed to vote. 
Once again, I am not telling anybody 
how to vote, for our votes are sacred, 
but you can vote yea on my ideas and 
Senator CARPER’s ideas, or you can 
vote nay, or you can not vote at all— 
you can jump the rail—but please let 
us vote. 
I am not criticizing anybody. I am 
really not. I know we are together a 
lot, as the Presiding Officer knows, and 
we all know each other, and I can hon-
estly say I like and respect every one 
of my colleagues in this body. I truly 
do. I may not agree with them, but I 
like and respect them, so my criticism 
is not personal. Yet our process here is 
a problem, which is my plea today to 
my colleagues: Please don’t object to 
this amendment. Please. It doesn’t 
mean you have to vote for it—you can 
vote against it—but please let the en-
tire body have a vote because that is 
what democracy is supposed to be all 
about. 
I yield the floor to my friend Senator 
CARPER. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I 
commend the Senator from Louisiana 
for his leadership and for his courage in 
not just helping to develop this pro-
posal that we have offered in a legisla-
tive forum but in trying to make sure 
that it gets the debate it needs and the 
vote it needs on this floor. 
For a couple of centuries, Members of 
the Senate would introduce legislation, 
and that legislation would be debated. 
Democrats and Republicans would have 
the opportunity to offer amendments 
to that legislation and to get votes on 
that legislation and on their amend-
ments. We would hammer out a com-
promise in the Senate and eventually 
with the House and with whoever was 
President. 
The Presiding Officer may remember 
an old movie called ‘‘The Way We 
Were.’’ That is the way we were, and 
we need desperately to get back to the 
way we were when we were the world’s 
greatest deliberative body. A good way 
to get started on that path is by sup-
porting the legislation that my friend 
from Louisiana and I have coauthored 
with the support of a broad coalition of 
Senators and with the support of the 
business community and the environ-
mental community as well. 
Our amendment, as Senator KENNEDY 
has described today, is identical to leg-
islation called the American Innova-
tion and Manufacturing Act. I am not 
a really big one for acronyms, but the 
acronym that the Senator has used is 
AIM, the AIM Act. It is currently sup-
ported by a bipartisan group of 32 Sen-
ators—16 Republicans and 16 Demo-
crats. I would describe this as Noah’s 
Ark, whereby, for every Republican, we 
add a Democrat and on and on and on. 
Even today, we are continuing to add 
sponsors and cosponsors to our bill and 
to this amendment. 
This amendment, like the stand- 
alone 
bill, 
would 
save 
consumers 
money; it would create jobs; it would 
support economic growth; and it would 
help us to address the climate crisis. 
This amendment would authorize the 
EPA to implement a phase-down of the 
production and consumption of some-
thing 
called 
hydrofluorocarbons, 
known as HFCs, over the next 15 years. 
HFCs are used as coolants in refrig-
erators and air conditioners. They are

substances that help to make sure our 
air conditioners work and our freezers 
work 
and 
our 
refrigerators 
work, 
among other things, and that our 
chillers work. 
Unfortunately, what came before the 
HFCs was bad for our ozone and our 
planet, and it created a big hole in the 
ozone layer of our planet. We figured 
out that it was not good. It turned out 
to be the refrigerants that we were 
using that were causing it. Scientists 
came along and said: Let’s replace 
them. Let’s get rid of those CFCs and 
replace them with something that 
doesn’t give us a hole in the ozone 
layer. 
Guess what. HFCs work. They do. 
They do a really good job at that. That 
is the good news. The bad news is these 
hydrofluorocarbons 
are 
1,000 
times 
worse than carbon dioxide as a green-
house gas—1,000 times worse. So they 
are good on the one hand and are bad 
on the other hand. 
So the scientists go to work again. 
Scientists in this country and busi-
nesses in this country go to work and 
ask: What can we do about this? They 
have come up with a replacement to re-
place the HFCs—1,000 times worse as a 
greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. 
We also have the opportunity, in 
using American technology, to put 
Americans to work in selling these 
products not just in America but 
around the world. American companies 
have invested literally billions of dol-
lars to produce and sell the next-gen-
eration technology to replace HFCs. 
Our amendment protects those invest-
ments. 
Again, the amendment is good for 
consumers, and I will explain why. The 
amendment drives the deployment of 
more efficient air-conditioning and re-
frigeration products and equipment. It 
reduces energy and upkeep costs as 
well. How much? What is it worth in 
terms of saving money for consumers? 
Apparently, the EPA has calculated it 
through its own economic analysis, and 
it has come up with a number that says 
that over the next 15 years, our legisla-
tion would save consumers $3.7 bil-
lion—not millions but billions of dol-
lars. 
Our amendment is good for American 
jobs. The chamber of commerce expects 
our legislation to result in the creation 
of 150,000 additional direct and indirect 
jobs in this country in the years to 
come—150,000 additional, good-paying 
jobs. Our amendment is good for our 
economy. 
Our legislation is expected to im-
prove the trade imbalance in chemicals 
and equipment by $12.5 billion, which is 
something we need to do, and it is ex-
pected to increase manufacturing out-
put close to $39 billion over the next 7 
years. 
Oh, by the way—P.S.—our amend-
ment is good for the planet we live on 
and the people who inhabit it. We will 
end up joining the rest of the world to 
phase out HFCs, which will help to 
avoid an increase of up to a half a de-
gree Celsius in our climate, in our tem-
perature on this planet. 
All of these are win-wins. They are 
all win-wins. They are the reason that 
our legislation has such broad support 
from stakeholders. Our legislation is 
supported by an unlikely coalition. As 
Senator KENNEDY said, it is not every 
day that you find the lamb and the lion 
lying down together in their finding a 
common cause. Yet, in this case, there 
is a whole host of environmental 
groups, the U.S. Chamber of Com-
merce, the National Association of 
Manufacturers, 
and 
other 
business 
groups, a lot of Democrats, a lot of Re-
publicans, and maybe one or two Inde-
pendents. I mean, it is a great coali-
tion, and it is one that I am proud of in 
my having worked with Senator KEN-
NEDY to create. We do all of this with 
the broad support of this unlikely coa-
lition. 
Our legislation doesn’t preempt the 
roles of States. With that said, I know 
that some of our colleagues have called 
for adding to this amendment new pre-
emption authorities that would pre-
vent States from addressing HFCs. My 
response to them is that there are rea-
sons this is not an issue to be addressed 
at this time. 
And as we have seen with TSCA and 
the California waiver for vehicle stand-
ards, this administration doesn’t seem 
keen on following the law, and there is 
no guarantee that if we require EPA to 
phase out HFCs that the Trump EPA 
will do so in a timely manner or in a 
legally defensible way. 
Allowing the States to act helps hold 
the Federal Government accountable. 
However, once a strong Federal pro-
gram is in place, States will not need 
to act and will spend their resources 
elsewhere. We have seen this happen 
before with programs similar to the 
one this amendment would create. 
I would like to add that many of my 
colleagues in this Chamber have stated 
that they support innovation to help 
achieve our climate and clean energy 
goals. 
The Federal Government has many 
tools to drive innovation—many tools 
to drive innovation—Federal funding, 
Federal procurement, and also regula-
tion. 
There is a reason we have broad sup-
port from the business community. 
Businesses know that regulation will 
further drive innovation and U.S. in-
vestments. Without the regulations 
that would be created if this amend-
ment were adopted, the United States 
will continue to lose global leadership 
in the production of HFC alternative 
technologies. 
And let me just add a P.S. I know 
some people think climate change is a 
hoax; it is not real. My wife and some 
of her colleagues from the DuPont 
Company that she worked with for 
years traveled to Antarctica earlier 
this year. They spent a couple weeks 
down there, an incredible trip, learned 
a lot, and they came back and I said: 
How warm was it down there? She said 
it was in the thirties—rarely below, 
not above. 
She came back about 5, 6 weeks ago. 
In the weeks since then, the record- 
high temperature in Antarctica, South 
Pole, hit 63 degrees. That record lasted 
for about a week, and it was replaced 
by a new record, 65. That lasted for 
about another week or two. That was 
broken by another record. I think it 
was 67 or 68 degrees—like that. 
A piece of Antarctica about the size 
of the District of Columbia fell off into 
the ocean. Something is happening 
here. Something is happening here, and 
I think what it is, is getting to be pret-
ty clear. 
Here is the good news. The good news 
is we can address that concern, that 
problem, which is not a hoax, and we 
can do so in ways that create tens of 
thousands of jobs, billions of dollars in 
exports, all kinds of economic oppor-
tunity, 
innovation, 
and 
technology 
that we would celebrate, and we should 
celebrate. 
We need to support this amendment. 
I just want to again thank my col-
league for his leadership, for allowing 
me to be his wingman in this effort, 
and I look forward to garnering the 
support of a broad coalition of our col-
leagues. It is the right thing do. Let’s 
do it. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
ABORTION 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
come to the floor tonight to briefly dis-
cuss a message from the Chief Justice 
of the Supreme Court, Chief Justice 
John Roberts. 
As you know, Chief Justice Roberts 
recently sat in the very chair, Madam 
President, in which you are sitting 
right now as he ably oversaw the im-
peachment trial. 
In a very rare admonition, the Chief 
Justice of the Supreme Court this 
afternoon released a statement in re-
sponse to statements made by the mi-
nority leader of the U.S. Senate, CHUCK 
SCHUMER. 
The Senator, speaking outside the 
Court, across the street from this 
building, was at a protest while argu-
ments were being heard inside the 
Court, and the comments made by Sen-
ator SCHUMER
certainly appeared to 
threaten members of the Supreme 
Court. 
The video clip shows Senator SCHU-
MER saying this. He said: 
I want to tell you, Gorsuch. I want to tell 
you, Kavanaugh. 
These are members of the Supreme 
Court, confirmed by the Senate. He 
said: 
I want to tell you. . . . You have released 
the whirlwind, and you will pay the price. 
‘‘You will pay the price.’’ 
Well, it can’t be a political price be-
cause Justices serve for life. Either 
they die in office or they can resign, 
step down. There is no political price 
to be paid. 
To me, this sounds like he is talking 
about a physical price, violence.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1468 
March 4, 2020 
Now, SCHUMER told abortion rights 
advocates who were outside the Court 
these very things: 
I [will] tell you, Gorsuch. I [will] tell you, 
Kavanaugh. You have released a whirlwind, 
and you will pay the price. 
He goes on to say: 
You won’t know what hit you. . . . 
You, members of the Supreme Court. 
He, the minority leader of the U.S. 
Senate, saying: 
You won’t know what hit you if you go for-
ward with these awful decisions. 
I believe these statements are out-
rageous; they are uncalled for; they are 
out of bounds; and on their face, they 
appear to invite violence against mem-
bers of the U.S. Supreme Court. 
Let me just read to you what the 
Chief Justice said today in his release. 
Chief Justice Roberts responded: 
This morning, Sen. Schumer spoke at a 
rally in front of the Supreme Court while a 
case was being argued inside. 
He goes on to say: 
Sen. Schumer referred to two Members of 
the Court by name and said he wanted to tell 
them that ‘‘you have released the whirlwind! 
And you will pay the price! You won’t know 
what hit you if you go forward with these 
awful decisions.’’ 
The Chief Justice continued: 
Justices know that criticism comes with 
the territory, but threatening statements of 
this sort from the highest levels of govern-
ment are not only inappropriate, they are 
dangerous. 
He concludes by saying: 
All Members of the Court will continue to 
do their job, without fear or favor, from 
whatever quarter. 
That is the statement of the Chief 
Justice of the Supreme Court referring 
to the actions by the minority leader, 
the Senator from New York, CHUCK 
SCHUMER. 
We cannot tolerate political violence 
or threats of harassment. We as a body, 
as a community, as a country should 
be looking to elevate our debates rath-
er than lower them, which is what, in 
my opinion, the minority leader did 
today. 
I hope the minority leader will think 
twice about comments like these in the 
future. 
I yield the floor.

DIGNITY IN AGING ACT 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, last 
night we passed by unanimous consent 
legislation to revise and extend for 5 
more years the key programs that Con-
gress 
established 
under 
the 
Older 
Americans Act of 1965. I cosponsored 
the final version of this measure, which 
passed 
our 
Chamber 
as 
a 
Senate 
amendment to the Dignity in Aging 
Act, H.R. 4334. 
I want to take this opportunity to ex-
press my appreciation to Senator COL-
LINS for leading the bicameral negotia-
tions that made this bipartisan com-
promise possible. I expect that the 
other Chamber will soon accept the 
changes we made to their version of 
this legislation, so that Congress can 
send the final version to the Presi-
dent’s desk in fairly short order. 
For over five decades, the Older 
Americans Act has made resources 
available to the Aging Network and 
States for services to the elderly and 
disabled. An example is the nutrition 
services program authorized under title 
III, which makes resources available 
for home-delivered meals, enabling the 
homebound to remain independent. 
This statute also helps older Ameri-
cans live independently by supporting 
community-based services, making in-
formation about care options available 
to family caregivers, and supporting 
the Long-Term Care Ombudsman Pro-
gram. 
As I continue my 99 county meetings 
across the State of Iowa each year, I 
welcome the feedback and ideas I get 
from local residents to help make our 
communities safer and stronger for 
older Americans. I also want to take 
this opportunity to commend the mem-
bers of the Elder Justice Coalition, as 
well as groups such as the Iowa Asso-
ciation of Area Agencies on Aging, for 
their efforts in this area. These organi-
zations and their members deserve rec-
ognition for their continued work on 
behalf of the Nation’s older Americans 
and their contributions to this year’s 
Older Americans Act extension. 
In a decade, all of our Nation’s baby 
boomers will have reached the age of 65 
or older, and this demographic shift 
creates new challenges for our commu-
nities. With this in mind, I am cur-
rently working with my colleagues on 
other bipartisan initiatives to improve 
the quality of life for older Iowans, in-
cluding legislation that would extend 
the Elder Justice Act. As the former 
chairman of the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee, I wrote the Elder Abuse Pre-
vention and Prosecution Act to curb 
elder abuse and beef up tools and re-
sources within local communities to 
help prevent financial fraud and exploi-
tation of older citizens. For those 
Iowans who enjoy working and need to 
continue working to pay the bills, I 
have also championed legislation to 
strengthen age-related workplace dis-
crimination laws. 
Mr. President, as noted by the former 
head of the Iowa Association of Area 
Agencies on Aging, ‘‘The Older Ameri-
cans Act provides the foundation that 
allows Iowa to continue to be a great 
place to for Iowans to call home.’’ I 
want to again thank my colleagues for 
working with me in a bipartisan way 
on this legislation to improve the lives 
of older Americans in Iowa and across 
the United States.

ARMS SALES NOTIFICATION 
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, section 
36(b) of the Arms Export Control Act 
requires that Congress receive prior no-
tification of certain proposed arms 
sales as defined by that statute. Upon 
such notification, the Congress has 30 
calendar days during which the sale 
may be reviewed. The provision stipu-
lates that, in the Senate, the notifica-
tion of proposed sales shall be sent to 
the chairman of the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee. 
In keeping with the committee’s in-
tention to see that relevant informa-
tion is available to the full Senate, I 
ask unanimous consent to have printed 
in the RECORD the notifications which 
have been received. If the cover letter 
references a classified annex, then such 
annex is available to all Senators in 
the office of the Foreign Relations 
Committee, room SD–423.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION 
Poland—Javelin Missile and Command 
Launch Unit 
The Government of Poland has requested 
to buy one hundred eighty (180) Javelin mis-
siles and seventy-nine (79) Javelin Command 
Launch Units (CLUs). Also included are 
Basic Skill Trainers (BST), Missile Simula-
tion Rounds (MSR), Battery Coolant Units 
(BCU), tool kits, modified 2–level mainte-
nance parts, training, U.S. Government and 
contractor technical assistance, transpor-
tation and other related elements of logistics 
support. The total estimated program cost is 
$100 million. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy and national security of the United 
States by improving the security of a NATO 
ally and partner nation which is an impor-
tant force for peace, political stability, and 
economic progress in Eastern Europe. 
This proposed sale of the Javelin system 
will help Poland build its long-term defense 
capacity to defend its sovereignty and terri-
torial integrity in order to meet its national 
defense requirements. Poland will have no 
difficulty absorbing this system into its 
armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The prime contractors will be Raytheon/ 
Lockheed Martin Javelin Joint Venture, Or-
lando, Florida and Tucson, Arizona. There 
are no known offset agreements proposed in 
connection with this potential sale. How-
ever, the purchaser typically requests off-
sets. Any offset agreement will be defined in 
negotiations between the purchaser and the 
contractor(s). 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
not require the assignment of U.S. Govern-
ment or contractor representatives to Po-
land. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale. 
TRANSMITTAL NO. 20–09 
Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of 
Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(l) of the 
Arms Export Control Act 
Annex Item No. vii 
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The Javelin Weapon System is a me-
dium-range, 
man-portable, 
shoulder- 
launched, fire-and-forget, anti-tank system 
for infantry, scouts, and combat engineers. 
It may also be mounted on a variety of plat-
forms 
including 
vehicles, 
aircraft, 
and 
watercraft. The system weighs 49.5 pounds 
and has a maximum range in excess of 2,500 
meters. The system is highly lethal against 
tanks and other systems with conventional 
and reactive armors. The system possesses a 
secondary capability against bunkers. 
2. The Javelin Weapon System is com-
prised of two major tactical components, 
which are a reusable Command Launch Unit 
(CLU) and a round contained in a disposable 
launch tube assembly. The CLU incorporates 
an integrated day-night sight that provides a 
target engagement capability in adverse 
weather and countermeasure environments. 
The CLU may also be used in a stand-alone 
mode for battlefield surveillance and target 
detection. The CLU’s thermal sight is a For-
ward Looking Infrared (FLIR) sensor. 
3. The Javelin’s key technical feature is 
the use of fire-and-forget technology which 
allows the gunner to fire and immediately 
relocate or take cover. The missile is auton-
omously guided to the target which allows 
the gunner the ability to reload and engage 
another target after firing a missile. The 
missile has a tandem warhead that is effec-
tive against armor threats. 
4. The Javelin Missile System hardware 
and the documentation are UNCLASSIFIED. 
The missile software which resides in the 
CLU is CLASSIFIED. 
5. If a technologically advanced adversary 
obtains knowledge of the specific hardware 
and software elements, the information 
could be used to develop countermeasures or 
equivalent systems that might reduce weap-
on system effectiveness or be used in the de-
velopment of a system with similar or ad-
vanced capabilities. 
6. A determination has been made that Po-
land can provide substantially the same de-
gree of protection for the sensitive tech-
nology being released as the U.S. Govern-
ment. This proposed sale is necessary to fur-
ther the U.S. foreign policy and national se-
curity objectives outlined in the Policy Jus-
tification. 
7. All defense articles and services listed on 
this transmittal are authorized for release 
and export to the Government of Poland. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF 
AREA AGENCIES OF AGING, 
January 31, 2020. 
DEAR CHAIRMEN ALEXANDER AND COLLINS, 
RANKING
MEMBERS
MURRAY
AND
CASEY, 
CHAIRMAN SCOTT AND RANKING MEMBER FOXX: 
On behalf of the National Association of 
Area Agencies on Aging (n4a), which rep-
resents the country’s 622 Area Agencies on 
Aging (AAAs) and is an advocacy voice for 
the more than 250 OAA Title VI Native 
American aging programs, we write today in 
strong support of the recently introduced bi-
partisan, bicameral legislation to update and 
reauthorize the Older Americans Act (OAA) 
through 2024. 
The Supporting Older Americans Act of 
2020, an amendment in the nature of a sub-
stitute to H.R. 4334, co-sponsored by Sen-
ators Collins and Casey, represents the dili-
gent work of all of your Committee Members 
and staff to secure broad and bipartisan sup-
port to responsibly update a landmark Act 
that supports millions of older adults and 
caregivers in communities across the nation. 
As you well know, the OAA is the corner-
stone of the nation’s non-Medicaid home and 
community-based services (HCBS) system, 
providing older adults with much-needed 
supports, including in-home care, congregate 
and home-delivered meals, adult day care, 
information and referral assistance, case 
management, transportation, legal services 
and caregiver support/respite. 
n4a appreciates your recognition of what is 
already working in the Act, including its 
unique delivery structure and intentional 
emphasis on local flexibility. 
We especially commend the bicameral and 
bipartisan work to include the following pro-
visions in the amendment to H.R. 4334, as 
they are among the most important provi-
sions in the bill and reflect many of n4a’s 
policy recommendations, which we shared 
with Congress in March 2019. 
We very much appreciate the annual in-
creases in the authorized funding levels. A 
lack of adequate funding is the number one 
barrier our members face in meeting the 
needs of older adults and caregivers, and 
with the rapidly increasing numbers of older 
adults in every community, the bill’s rec-
ommendations to increase core programs by 
seven percent in year one and six percent in 
subsequent years is an excellent starting 
point for appropriators to heed. Addition-
ally, we are pleased that the bill the returns 
to a five-year authorization period, which 
provides greater stability and allows the 
Aging Network to focus on achieving the 
Act’s goals, rather than divert time to advo-
cacy to renew a law that works so well. 
Part of any reauthorization is ensuring 
that the law remains clear in its direction, 
even as other systems or laws change over 
time. Section 118 is an excellent example of 
this, whereby the bill makes clear that Area 
Agencies on Aging can engage in emerging 
opportunities to serve greater numbers of 
older 
adults 
through 
non-OAA 
funding 
streams. Examples include contracts with 
health care payers to provide meals or trans-
portation to clients; establishing private-pay 
programs to enable AAAs to provide services 
to those who can afford to purchase OAA- 
like services when OAA resources are limited 
or unavailable; or similar mechanisms that 
serve the goals of the Act while operating 
outside of it. The bill also makes clear the 
role of the Assistant Secretary on Aging to 
continue encouraging and training the Aging 
Network on these matters of business acu-
men, innovation and changing models of 
health care and social services. 
We also commend the Title VI Native 
American aging program provisions. By al-
lowing the Administration on Aging to cre-
ate demonstrations around a broader array 
of Supportive Services than most Title VI 
aging programs can currently provide and in-
cludes increased funding to do so—the bill 
will help tribes build capacity and better 
meet the needs of the elders they serve.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1470 
March 4, 2020 
By including a robust new research and 
demonstration authority for the Administra-
tion on Aging (AoA) in Title IV, we appre-
ciate your work to create a research and 
evaluation center in Sec. 127 focused on pro-
moting and coordinating research and eval-
uation activities to enhance performance, 
develop new models and produce data-driven 
assessments of the value of the OAA pro-
grams. While we are disappointed that these 
activities lack a specific funding authoriza-
tion, we are pleased that lawmakers ac-
knowledge the importance of these activities 
and the need to create a dedicated entity fo-
cused on them. 
While a smaller measure, eliminating a 10 
percent cap on serving grandparents and 
other older relative caregivers under the 
Act’s Title III E National Family Caregiver 
Support Program is also important to n4a 
members. Eliminating this arbitrary cap re-
flects the growing realities of the opioid epi-
demic and the need for sufficient state and 
local flexibility to serve these older care-
givers 
who 
face 
uniquely 
challenging 
caregiving burdens. 
The research base revealing the negative 
health outcomes from social isolation and 
loneliness continues to grow and increas-
ingly documents the risks to the health and 
well-being of older adults. n4a appreciates 
the bill’s thoughtful addition of language in 
multiple places in the Act to recognize the 
challenge we face, as well as the fact that 
many core OAA programs already address so-
cial isolation and promote social engage-
ment. 
n4a requested a minor change to ensure 
that Area Agencies on Aging have access to 
a state’s cost-sharing policy or guidance. 
Section 212 of the bill also accomplishes this. 
We will not detail the many other provi-
sions in the bill—most of which we support 
or take no position on—but will again reit-
erate our thanks that this final product re-
flects our members’ concerns and realities. 
Congress was diligent in soliciting and con-
sidering the recommendations of a broad 
array of constituencies and organizations 
during this reauthorization process. 
Thank you for your leadership in crafting 
an OAA update that ensures that the Act’s 
innovative, efficient programs enabling older 
Americans to live at home and in their com-
munities for as long as possible continues to 
be a lifeline in communities across the coun-
try. 
We urge the Senate and House to act swift-
ly to approve the Supporting Older Ameri-
cans Act of 2020, H.R. 4334, and send it to 
President Trump for his signature. The sta-
bility that a finalized and current OAA reau-
thorization provides is critical to ensuring 
that the millions of older adults and care-
givers served by the OAA can continue to 
live with dignity and independence in their 
homes and communities for as long as pos-
sible. Should you have any questions, please 
feel free to contact me or n4a’s policy staff 
at 202.872.0888. 
Sincerely, 
SANDY MARKWOOD, 
Chief Executive Officer. 
MEALS ON WHEELS AMERICA, 
January 30, 2019. 
DEAR CHAIRMEN ALEXANDER
AND COLLINS 
AND RANKING MEMBERS MURRAY AND CASEY: 
On behalf of Meals on Wheels America, the 
nationwide network of community-based 
senior nutrition programs and the individ-
uals they serve, we write to endorse the 
‘‘Supporting Older Americans Act of 2020.’’ 
This legislation would amend H.R. 4334, the 
Dignity in Aging Act that passed by voice 
vote in the House last fall, and reauthorize 
the Older Americans Act (OAA) for five 
years. We commend you for your leadership 
and hard work to reach this bipartisan, bi-
cameral agreement and urge unanimous pas-
sage as soon as possible. 
Since 1965, the OAA has been the primary 
piece of federal legislation focused on estab-
lishing, 
coordinating 
and 
strengthening 
home- and community-based social and nu-
trition services for adults 60 and older and 
their families. OAA services like Meals on 
Wheels, transportation, caregiver assistance, 
senior employment and training and elder 
rights protection are just some of the vital 
functions the OAA provides to more than 11 
million seniors annually. 
As you and many of your colleagues know 
firsthand, OAA services and supports—in-
cluding the three nutrition programs author-
ized under Title III of the Act—help keep our 
nation’s most vulnerable, isolated and food 
insecure seniors healthier and in their own 
homes and communities longer. This, in 
turn, delays and/or prevents altogether the 
need for more expensive institutional care 
often paid for through Medicare or Medicaid. 
OAA programs are not only extremely cost- 
effective, but they are also longstanding ex-
amples of public-private partnerships that 
save taxpayer dollars at the local, state and 
federal levels in terms of reduced healthcare 
expenditures. 
We strongly support the authorized appro-
priations increases contained in this legisla-
tion. With nearly half of our Meals on 
Wheels programs having a documented wait-
ing list for nutrition services, the 6% in-
crease in authorization of funding levels 
through Fiscal Year 2024 for OAA programs 
will significantly improve the senior nutri-
tion network’s ability to close these service 
gaps. 
We further appreciate recognition of the 
significant impact of OAA nutrition services 
and 
supports 
and 
the 
steps 
taken 
to 
strengthen them through provisions in this 
final compromise reauthorization bill. Provi-
sions that advance research and data, includ-
ing capturing the unmet need and scope of 
waiting lists for congregate and home-deliv-
ered meals, and increase focus on culturally 
appropriate and medically-tailored meals, 
malnutrition, and the negative health con-
sequences of social isolation are key prior-
ities of our organization, among many oth-
ers. 
Accordingly, we urge the Senate to swiftly 
pass the ‘‘Supporting Older Americans Act of 
2020’’ to help better meet the inherent 
changes in our country’s aging population 
and serve more of those in need. Meals on 
Wheels America and the nationwide network 
of senior nutrition programs have appre-
ciated contributing feedback and policy rec-
ommendations throughout this reauthoriza-
tion process and look forward to continuing 
to work with you to build upon the ongoing 
successes of the OAA. 
Thank you again for your leadership, pub-
lic service and support for our nation’s older 
adults. 
Sincerely, 
ELLIE HOLLANDER, 
President and CEO. 
AARP, 
February 4, 2020. 
DEAR CHAIRMEN ALEXANDER AND SCOTT AND 
RANKING MEMBERS MURRAY AND FOXX: On be-
half of our nearly 38 million members and all 
older Americans nationwide, I am writing to 
express AARP’s support for the Supporting 
Older Americans Act of 2020, a bipartisan 
amendment in the nature of a substitute to 
H.R. 4334 that would reauthorize the Older 
Americans Act (OAA). We are pleased that 
this amendment maintains critical service 
and information roles of OAA programs, and 
promotes greater responsiveness to the needs 
of older Americans. We appreciate your lead-
ership in developing this bipartisan, bi-
cameral agreement and look forward to a 
prompt reauthorization of OAA. 
Giving Americans the support they need to 
live at home with independence and dignity 
has always been a bedrock goal of OAA, and 
it has been remarkably successful. The Sup-
porting Older Americans Act builds on this 
success by further enhancing OAA programs 
and services. This amendment addresses 
AARP’s OAA reauthorization priorities, in-
cluding further strengthening the National 
Family 
Caregiver 
Support 
Program 
(NFCSP), extending the bipartisan Recog-
nize, Assist, Include, Support, and Engage 
(RAISE) Family Caregivers Act (P.L. 115– 
119), and increasing funding levels for OAA 
programs. 
The Supporting Older Americans Act en-
hances support for caregivers by encouraging 
the use of caregiver assessments under 
NFCSP. Assessing the caregiving situation 
can lead to targeting services more effec-
tively by linking the caregiver to the serv-
ices most beneficial to them. Better tar-
geting of support services can also help 
maintain the health and well-being of the 
caregiver, sustain their ability to provide 
care, produce better outcomes for their loved 
ones, and prevent or delay nursing home 
placement. The provision to extend RAISE 
will provide the RAISE Family Caregiving 
Advisory Council with more time to identify 
meaningful solutions for supporting the 41 
million family caregivers nationwide who 
provide a staggering $470 billion annually in 
unpaid care to their loved ones. And impor-
tantly, at a time when the older population 
is projected to grow significantly, the in-
creased 
funding 
levels 
provided 
in 
the 
amendment would assist more older Ameri-
cans and caregivers, thus helping more older 
adults remain at home and in better health, 
avoiding costlier services. 
We commend the committees for their bi-
partisan and bicameral work, and urge 
prompt reauthorization of the Older Ameri-
cans Act to ensure that our loved ones can 
continue to turn to these vital services for 
their health and economic security as they 
age. If you have any questions, please feel 
free to contact me or have your staff contact 
Nicole Burda on our Government Affairs 
team. 
Sincerely, 
MEGAN O’REILLY, 
Vice President, Federal Health & Family, 
Government Affairs. 
FEBRUARY 7, 2020. 
DEAR LEADERS MCCONNELL AND SCHUMER, 
SPEAKER PELOSI, LEADER MCCARTHY, CHAIR-
MAN ALEXANDER, RANKING MEMBER MURRAY, 
CHAIRMAN SCOTT AND RANKING MEMBER FOXX: 
On behalf of the undersigned 128 national or-
ganizations with a vested interest in the 
well-being of America’s older adults and 
caregivers, we write to you today in support 
of the Supporting Older Americans Act of 
2020 (H.R. 4334) to reauthorize the Older 
Americans Act (OAA). 
We recognize and appreciate the diligent 
bipartisan and bicameral efforts to reauthor-
ize the Older Americans Act, which expired 
on September 30, 2019. Achieving a reauthor-
ization of this critical Act that reaffirms and 
protects its mission will ensure the sustain-
ability of vital OAA programs, as well as the 
health, dignity, and independence of the 
older Americans and their caregivers who de-
pend on them. 
The OAA is essential to developing, coordi-
nating, and delivering home and community- 
based services that help older adults remain 
in their homes and communities as they age. 
Many individuals served by OAA-funded pro-
grams would otherwise be at significant risk 
of hunger, isolation, abuse, and losing their 
ability to choose where they want to age. 
OAA-supported programs are provided to

more than 11 million seniors and their care-
givers annually, and include, but are not 
limited to, home-delivered and congregate 
nutrition services, in-home supportive serv-
ices, multipurpose senior centers, transpor-
tation, caregiver support, disease prevention 
and health promotion, community service 
employment, the long-term care ombudsman 
program, and services to prevent the abuse, 
neglect, and exploitation of older adults. 
By keeping seniors healthy and in their 
communities for more than 50 years, OAA 
programs have also delayed or prevented the 
need for more expensive institutional care 
for many older adults, which is often paid for 
through Medicare or Medicaid. OAA services 
can effectively save taxpayer, state, and fed-
eral dollars and promote efficiencies within 
the health care system. 
The Supporting Older Americans Act of 
2020 builds upon both the House-passed Dig-
nity in Aging Act (H.R. 4334) and the Senate- 
introduced Modernization of the Older Amer-
icans Act Amendments (S. 3057) to incor-
porate a number of important priorities ar-
ticulated by stakeholder organizations. Most 
importantly, the bicameral compromise calls 
for necessary investments in the OAA by in-
creasing funding authorizations over the 
next five years—a top priority of the under-
signed organizations and the most critical 
need of the Aging Network authorized by the 
OAA. 
Other priorities within the bill address re-
search and demonstrations, Native American 
services, local planning and development, 
supports for those living with dementia and 
social isolation, legal services, nutrition, in- 
home supportive services, disease prevention 
and health promotion, multigenerational 
collaboration, and family caregiver supports. 
We appreciate that the Supporting Older 
Americans Act of 2020 preserves the numer-
ous ways in which this Act works so well at 
the federal, state, and local level, on behalf 
of the older adults and caregivers for whom 
it is a lifeline to dignity, independence, 
health, safety, and economic security. 
Thank you for your commitment to this 
important issue. The undersigned organiza-
tions represent a diverse set of stakeholders, 
and we stand ready to build upon existing 
momentum to swiftly advance the com-
promise bill through Congress and to the 
President’s desk.

SUPPORTING OLDER AMERICANS 
ACT OF 2020 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, last 
night the Senate unanimously passed 
my legislation, the Supporting Older 
Americans Act of 2020. I developed this 
important legislation with Senator 
BOB CASEY, who serves as the ranking 
member of the Senate Aging Com-
mittee, which I chair, to reauthorize 
and strengthen the landmark Older 
Americans Act. A bipartisan group of 
24 Senators cosponsored this reauthor-
ization, and 128 national organizations 
endorsed it. I rise today to commend 
this bipartisan achievement that will 
ensure that vital services for our sen-
iors continue and are strengthened. 
Since 1965, the Older Americans Act 
has helped to ensure that millions of 
seniors receive the support they need 
to age independently and with dignity. 
Administered by the Administration 
for 
Community 
Living, 
the 
Older 
Americans Act authorizes an array of 
services through a network of 56 State 
units on aging and more than 600 area 
agencies on aging, serving more than 10 
million Americans throughout the Na-
tion each year. OAA programs provide 
nutritious food, transportation, assist-
ance to caregivers, and in-home serv-
ices for older adults. These invest-
ments foster a sense of community for 
older adults and save taxpayers money 
by reducing hospitalizations and the 
need for long-term residential care. 
As our population ages, demand for 
Older 
Americans 
Act 
services 
has 
grown. Our legislation extends OAA 
programs for 5 years and provides in-
creased investments to meet growing 
demands. For example, one hallmark 
OAA program is Meals on Wheels. Last 
year, this home-delivered nutrition 
program provided seniors with 358 mil-
lion meals. In many States, however, 
the need is soaring. In Maine, there is 
a waitlist of 400 to 1,500 people, depend-
ing on the time of the year and the lo-
cation in our State. That is why it is so 
important that this bill helps to ensure 
that more seniors in need of nutritious 
food can be served through important 
programs such as Meals on Wheels. 
At $11 a day, a meal is far cheaper 
than the $2,400 average cost of a hos-
pital stay. Using Older Americans Act 
dollars, the Southern Maine Agency on 
Aging conducted a pilot study that pro-
vided seniors discharged from the hos-
pital with 4 weeks’ worth of food. The 
results were astounding—hospital re-
admissions were reduced by 38 per-
cent—a 387-percent return on invest-
ment. On a national scale, the savings 
would be an astronomical $51 billion 
annually. 
Our legislation also includes several 
provisions to combat social isolation, 
which can have devastating health ef-
fects, particularly on older adults who 
are already vulnerable. 
As the executive director of the East-
ern Maine Area Agency on Aging, Dyan 
Walsh, said, The Older Americans Act 
is a great victory for the aging services 
network and those we serve. There are 
many important provisions in the bill, 
not the least of which is the focus on 
research to study the negative con-
sequences of social isolation and loneli-
ness which impacts so many rural older 
adults. We look to the future with a re-
newed focus to integrate innovative

strategies that will advance our mis-
sion to support communities and those 
who are the most vulnerable. 
The Older Americans Act is a shining 
example of a Federal policy that 
works. Every $1 invested into the Older 
Americans Act generates $3 by helping 
seniors stay at home through low-cost, 
community-based services. I thank the 
dozens of stakeholders we have worked 
with over the past several months to 
reauthorize and strengthen OAA, in-
cluding the Leadership Council of 
Aging Organizations, AARP, the Na-
tional Association of Area Agencies on 
Aging, 
the 
National 
Alliance 
for 
Caregiving, Meals on Wheels America, 
the National Association of Counties, 
and the Alzheimer’s Association. I ask 
unanimous consent to have these let-
ters of support printed in the RECORD 
at the end of my remarks. 
I urge my colleagues in the House to 
support this important reauthorization 
so that we can swiftly send it to the 
President’s desk to get signed into law. 
f 
GAME CHANGERS STUDY 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I recently 
had the honor of being welcomed by 
Game Changers, an organization based 
in Louisville, KY, devoted to guiding 
our 
youth 
toward 
productive 
and 
meaningful lives, for a panel discussion 
on the impact of violence in our com-
munity. The executive director of 
Game Changers is Christopher 2X, who 
I have known for many years and 
watched change the lives of so many 
Kentuckians through his advocacy, 
leadership, and community building ef-
forts. In December of 2019, just a few 
months ago, Christopher showed me 
the findings of Game Changers’s study 
on the impact of youth violence re-
cently released by his organization. 
Subsequently, I asked him to organize 
an event in West Louisville with a 
panel of community leaders and par-
ents to discuss the report and how vio-
lent crime affects the lives of Louis-
ville youth. 
At the event, we not only discussed 
the findings, but also heard from 
Louisvillians whose real-life stories are 
contained in the pages of those reports. 
Kentucky 
Education 
Commissioner, 
Dr. Wayne D. Lewis, educated us on the 
burden that violence has on children. 
However, the only way to grasp the 
true tragedy of violent crime is to hear 
from those impacted. I met with 
Deshante Edwards, who not only lost 
her son, Donte, but now sees her 6- 
year-old grandson subsequently lose 
focus in school. I listened as Krista and 
Navada Gwynn told me that, as a re-
sult of the murder of their son, Chris-
tian, their 17- and 11-year old children 
are too petrified to go outside. Only 
personal stories such as these truly 
demonstrate the extreme toll taken on 
children exposed to violence. 
That is why I feel compelled to share 
Game Changers’s findings on violence 
and its impact on our youth with my 
colleagues. Tragically, children are ex-
posed to violence in every corner of our 
Nation. I ask unanimous consent that 
this report be printed in the CONGRES-
SIONAL
RECORD
with the hope that 
every Member of Congress will read it 
and work with me to create safer com-
munities for our children. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as fallows: , 
VIOLENCE IMPACT ON CHILDREN LEARNING 
The Christopher 2X Game Changers Target 
Education—Crush Violence 
SHINING A LIGHT ON HOW GUN VIOLENCE 
IMPACTS KIDS 
Kentucky Education Commissioner Dr. Wayne 
D. Lewis 
‘‘Children who grow up in violent neighbor-
hoods seldom realize their way of life is not 
typical. Their lives may include regularly 
hearing gunshots through the night and 
sometimes during the day, losing friends, 
family, and neighbors to gun violence, and 
continually being fearful of becoming the 
victim of violent crime. 
No parent wants that kind of life for their 
children, but that is what life looks like for 
children living in violent neighborhoods 
across the U.S., including children in some 
Louisville neighborhoods. The trauma they 
suffer is unlike anything children growing up 
in upper middle class or affluent neighbor-
hoods could imagine. And the impact of that 
trauma, while often unrecognized, is signifi-
cant; often impacting their ability to reach 
their learning potential at school. 
Recognizing and responding to the trauma 
of students who experience violence has to be 
part of how we educate them. There is no 
way to reasonably expect students who have 
experienced such trauma to leave their fears, 
anxieties, and pain at home when they come 
to school. Instead, it is incumbent upon 
schools to help connect students with com-
munity resources as appropriate, and to do 
our absolute best to be sensitive to and ac-
commodate students’ social and emotional 
needs as we work to meet their academic 
needs in schools.’’ 
Jenny Benner, Senior Director-Child Develop-
ment Center, Chestnut Street Family YMCA 
‘‘As an early childhood educator, it has be-
come more common to see children who have 
been affected in some way by violence. Many 
of the children we serve are too young to 
verbalize their trauma or stress. Because of 
this, we have to ensure early childhood edu-
cators have the training and support needed 
to help these children build resilience. We 
focus heavily on a child’s social-emotional 
development and the first step is to make 
sure they feel safe and loved. 
Once in a safe environment, they will open 
up to learn skills necessary to be successful 
in school and life. It is also important to 
teach problem-solving and how to resolve 
conflicts appropriately, using words. I be-
lieve this skill is lacking in some children 
and they are most likely to continue cycles 
of violence because that is all they know. 
This report shines a light on how important 
education is, even as early as infancy, and 
my hope is that this will start a dialogue 
about how we as a community can come to-
gether to serve children to our best ability!’’ 
Jefferson Family Court Judge Derwin Webb 
‘‘When I was 15 years old, one of my good 
friends was accidentally shot and killed by a 
friend. A few years later, that same shooter 
was accidentally shot and killed by someone 
else. Today, we have kids killing kids—at 
random times—intentionally. Louisville, we 
are better than this. Guns have no names, 
bullets have no names, but our children do. 
So, I am asking you to please, please stop 
the violence. I started YOUNG Men’s Acad-
emy at Whitney Young Elementary, a 
mentorship program, to try to help, and I ap-
plaud this report and all efforts to bring at-
tention to the needs of kids exposed to vio-
lence, and to help them reach their poten-
tial.’’ 
Dr. J. David Richardson, Chief of Surgery, Uni-
versity of Louisville Hospital 
‘‘Having been involved in the care of the 
injured for over 40 years, I applaud the cur-
rent focus on the downstream effects of gun 
violence in our community. As trauma sur-
geons, our team focuses on the ‘‘victim’’ or 
injured. We analyze their care and outcomes 
through our quality review process, but we 
have few, if any, mechanisms for examining 
the effects on families, neighbors, or others 
in the community who are impacted by this 
violence. I have been particularly concerned 
about the children who bear witness to these 
acts, even if they are not directly or phys-
ically injured. How can a growing, evolving, 
learning, adapting brain develop as we would 
desire in an atmosphere of uncertainty and 
fear? I have heard countless stories of the 
deleterious effects of these acts of violence 
and their negative impact on the culture and 
well-being of our neighborhoods. While it is 
cliche to state ‘‘our children are our future’’, 
it is nonetheless true. The children who are 
exposed to gun violence in Louisville deserve 
better.’’ 
Troy Pitcock, retired LMPD Major 2nd Division 
‘‘Gun violence has a horrifying impact on 
our youth. Witnessing it directly or the rem-
nants of violence at police crime scenes are 
situations too many of our youth are ex-
posed to, many times at such early ages. 
These situations have life lasting implica-
tions on children, at times creating a percep-
tion such violence is acceptable. A lack of 
parental support can enhance the believe to 
our youth that such actions are acceptable 
or even the proper method to deal with con-
flict.’’ 
CHRISTOPHER 2X 
Imagine you’re a mom at home watching a 
video with your kids and their playmates on 
a Saturday afternoon when all a sudden your 
home is being riddled with bullets from a 
high-caliber weapon. 
Bullets through the walls, furniture, shat-
tering the oven door, while you scramble to 
get the little ones on the floor, covered with 
your body, and under a bed, to keep them 
safe. 
No imagination is needed. This happened 
to my daughter Heaven, a child development 
specialist, who was with six children, ages 1– 
7, when her home was hit with gunfire from 
an AK–47 in the middle of the afternoon last 
Dec. 1. Two neighboring apartments in the 
new Shepherd Square complex just east of 
downtown also were hit. 
While thankfully no one was physically 
hurt, the trauma from exposure to such a 
violent act can interrupt a child’s normal de-
velopment and ability to learn in school. 
My daughter’s experience and a spike in 
gun violence last summer—with teens shoot-
ing automatic weapons out of stolen cars, 
kids as young as 13 charged with murder— 
made me want to shine a light on the impact 
of gun violence on children and their learn-
ing. 
As a peace and justice advocate for nearly 
20 years, I know my daughter’s experience is 
not unique. In all parts of our city, citizens 
report hearing gunfire to police every day 
and gunshots have been heard outside my 
daughter’s apartment multiple times since 
the day her home was splattered with bul-
lets. 
In the first nine months of this year, 65 of 
the 73 murders in Louisville Metro were from

gunfire, and family and friends—including 
many young children—struggle with the 
losses. In all, 276 people were shot from Jan-
uary-September, more than 30 people a 
month. 
Children suffer if they get hit by bullet, 
witness a shooting, lose someone close or 
live on edge because the crack of gunshots is 
as common as the chirping of a songbird. 
They often can’t focus or learn in school. 
Some can’t sleep and have nightmares. Some 
withdraw, others act out or retaliate and re-
sort to violence themselves. 
In sharing their stories on the following 
pages—some redemptive, some tragic—we 
can all have a better understanding of what 
this sick culture of gun violence is doing to 
our children and their ability to learn. We 
can all do a better job recognizing children 
who are suffering and providing help they 
need to succeed in school and reach their po-
tential. 
There are many people—teachers, police 
officers, counselors, therapists, physicians, 
nurses, others—doing amazing work to help 
victims and their families. But much more is 
needed. Here is my call to action as a start: 
Parents/adults with children under your 
care: Talk to your child’s teacher or school 
counselor if your child has been exposed to 
violence so they can be supportive and help-
ful. Don’t assume your child is ok. Seek 
services for your child through the school or 
others such as their doctor if your family 
needs help. 
Teachers: Know the symptoms of trauma 
in a child, which vary based on age and the 
individual child but include acting out, ag-
gressive verbal or physical behavior, or with-
drawal and not doing their work. Use school 
resources to link the child to professional 
evaluation and help. 
Principals/administrators: Support teacher 
training at your schools, and make sure chil-
dren in need receive evaluations and follow 
up treatment if needed. 
I am deeply grateful to survivors of gun vi-
olence and others for sharing their stories. 
May God bless the victims, survivors and the 
angels in their lives who support them. 
DEVIN SESAY AND FAMILY 
Before June 13, he was excited about his 
upcoming freshman year at Atherton High 
School. He was also relieved because his big 
brother, Devin Sesay, a rising Atherton sen-
ior, would teach him the ropes at his new 
school. 
The brothers would walk to the bus stop 
together every morning. On the first day, 
they would be sporting new shoes that Devin, 
a smart dresser, would find online. 
Everything changed on June 13 for the boy, 
14, and his close extended family whose 
members first came to the United States 27 
years ago to escape war-torn Liberia in West 
Africa. 
On June 13, Devin was shot and died on 
Roselane Street in Smoketown, three doors 
down from the family’s home. He was 17. 
Family members said Devin had been walk-
ing home late at night from playing basket-
ball in nearby Shelby Park when shots were 
fired from a passing car. 
Devin’s family—his grandfather, mother 
and four brothers, his aunt and cousins—are 
dealing with devastating shock, grief and 
anger over his murder, while also coping 
with other major life adjustments. 
A few weeks after Devin’s murder, his 
mother, grandfather and brothers moved to a 
brick ranch house and new school district 13 
miles away in southern Jefferson County. 
‘‘I was afraid for the boys,’’ said their 
mother, Maima Karneh, 41, a certified nurse 
assistant who works nights at the Home of 
the Innocents, not far from Smoketown. 
Her boys and other children often hung out 
at their home, inside playing video games, 
outside on the porch or nearby throwing a 
football or shooting hoops. 
She liked having them around the house 
where they’d lived for 10 years, she said, be-
cause it meant they weren’t on the street. 
She enforced stern rules, checked on her 
boys often by phone and Devin had never 
been in any trouble, she said. 
Ten days after Devin’s murder, another 
shooting solidified her decision to move. On 
June 23, Tyrese Garvin, 20, was shot almost 
directly across the street from where her son 
was killed. Garvin had been visiting his new-
born twins at University Hospital. He died 
five days later in the same hospital where 
his twins were being treated. Three juveniles 
including a 14-year-old were charged with his 
murder. 
‘‘There was no way we were going to stay,’’ 
Karneh said. 
She and Devin knew Garvin, who was a 
senior when Devin was a freshman at Ath-
erton and Garvin attended Devin’s memorial 
service, a few days before he was murdered. 
In their new home, Devin’s portrait hangs 
in the living room near the front door and 
his brother at times stares at it. ‘‘It reminds 
me of how many good days we had,’’ he said. 
‘‘I was supposed to go to Atherton with him 
this year. He was supposed to show me the 
bus stops and everything and it just kills 
me.’’ Instead his brother is gone, he’s is a 
new neighborhood and attending Moore High 
School, and he said it doesn’t feel right. 
The school alerted his mother to concerns 
about him focusing and his grief and he and 
family members are receiving counseling. 
Two other younger brothers, 11 and 13, are 
attending Moore Middle School and said 
they are doing their best to live up to 
Devin’s memory. 
Devin’s four brothers—the oldest is 21—and 
a 10-year-old cousin were at home when 
Devin was killed and some of them heard the 
shots. 
Karneh’s 14-year-old son called her at work 
to report hearing gunfire and that Devin was 
not home. When Devin did not respond to her 
texts, ‘‘I knew it was him,’’ she said. 
Her sister, Sietta Karneh, said the family 
wants to keep Devin’s memory alive. He was 
an outgoing, athletic, fun teenager with a 
slew of friends who have taken his death 
hard, posting remembrances on social media, 
his aunt said. She and her sister have raised 
their kids as one family. ‘‘I also lost a son,’’ 
she said about Devin. ‘‘I can’t get over how 
close to home he was when they took his 
life . . . . I can’t get over this nightmare.’’ 
*Deadliest Month of 2019: June—15 homi-
cides, the highest number of murders in any 
month in the past five years and more than 
twice the seven homicides in June 2018. 
A FAMILY HUNKERS DOWN 
Near 22nd and Oak streets in West Louis-
ville, a 12-year-old boy and his 13-year-old 
sister decided to stay inside during the sum-
mer because they were afraid they’d get shot 
if they ventured outdoors. 
Their parents don’t want their names re-
vealed. ‘‘We are so close to it. We’re a stone’s 
throw away from it in either direction,’’ 
their father said about the gun violence. 
Their mother, who remembers a safe envi-
ronment when she was growing up in the 
neighborhood, said they hear gunshots two 
or three times a month at least, usually at 
night. She said they stay inside, and don’t go 
near the windows. 
‘‘You hear it so much you get used to it. 
You hope the gunshots don’t affect your fam-
ily.’’ When news reports spotlight a deadly 
shooting in areas where she has family ‘‘you 
think my brother lives down there. I hope it 
wasn’t him. You tend to tense up when you 
hear things like that.’’ 
Their children are keenly aware, too. They 
know about gunshot deaths not far from 
their home during the summer, and a video 
on social media of teens with guns touting 
an ‘‘east vs west’’ rivalry with random gun 
violence. 
‘‘It’s messed up,’’ the boy said. 
He said he began staying inside their house 
in early July after he was outside with 
friends in the early evening and a car pulled 
up on their street with a gun pointing out 
the window. He ran to his backyard and said 
after that, ‘‘I decided on my own not to go 
out.’’ 
His sister said she thinks ‘‘the world’s just 
getting violent.’’ She didn’t go outside ‘‘be-
cause the west and the east was doing a 
shootout.’’ She said she learned about it 
through a video on Facebook. 
Their parents said they don’t call police 
because they don’t think there is much the 
police can do, although they wish there were 
more routine police patrols visible on their 
streets. Police respond to gunfire, but with-
out adequate information they are unable to 
make an arrest, their father said. 
‘‘You don’t want to keep your kids locked 
in,’’ their mother said. ‘‘You are scared for 
their safety, too. You don’t know what to 
do.’’ 
Citizen reports of hearing gunshots over 18 
months, from Jan. 1, 2018–June 2019, totaled 
4,558, from every Louisville Metro police dis-
trict. 
Homicides by police district Jan.–Sept. 
2019: 1st District—12; 2nd District—25; 3rd 
District—11; 4th District—13; 5th District—3; 
6th District—5; 7th District—2; 8th District— 
2; Total: 73. 
DIONTAE ‘‘TAY’’ REED 
At 18, Diontae ‘‘Tay’’ Reed seems happy, 
with a playful sense of humor and a lot to be 
proud of—good grades, a diploma from 
Ballard High School, a future full of possi-
bilities including college. 
He’s come a long way from age 13 when he 
was shot in the back, underwent surgery and 
spent 11 days in the hospital. His homes have 
been shot up four different times, and he 
knows more people who have been shot or 
killed than he can count on both hands. 
‘‘I knew about the violence in my neigh-
borhood at a young age,’’ he said. ‘‘I have 
trust issues. I don’t trust people easily so 
wherever I go I’m always looking.’’ 
Now he’s the first person in his family to 
have graduated from high school, months 
after he and his family—his mother and a 
younger sister—were evicted from their 
home in the Portland neighborhood. He is 
staying with a friend’s family while his 
mother and sister are living apart with rel-
atives. He takes the bus from the apartment 
where he is living in the Portland neighbor-
hood to Mall St. Matthews and back for his 
part-time job at a shoe store. 
Diontae wonders if he’s ready for college, 
and he’s deeply worried about how he would 
pay for tuition, but he is exploring options 
as he also dreams of having a driver’s license 
and a car someday. 
He credits his mother, who ‘‘was always on 
me’’ for keeping him on the right track, off 
the streets and focused on school. He also 
credits Ballard High School teachers and a 
special tutor for helping him achieve. ‘‘I al-
ways made teachers laugh,’’ he said with a 
smile, and ‘‘they became friends to me.’’ He 
can tick off the names of several he admired. 
He attended Shawnee Academy his fresh-
man year but pursued a transfer to Ballard 
with the help of his mother. ‘‘I felt like if I 
had stayed at that school I wouldn’t have 
learned anything,’’ because teachers spent so 
much time trying to control the classroom, 
he said. 
His cousin had been doing well at Ballard, 
had a tutor, and he thought that formula 
would also work for him, and it did.

‘‘I’m seeing I’m getting good grades,’’ he 
said. ‘‘I do not want to go home and be on 
the streets and do something that could get 
me killed.’’ 
His two older brothers, 23 and 22, chose a 
‘‘way different path.’’ When he was shot four 
years ago, he was running away from a fight 
his brothers got into with another group of 
boys. When asked why he thought his homes 
had been shot up in the past, he responded, 
‘‘my brothers.’’ While he’s close to them, ‘‘I 
could never ask them what they’re doing.’’ 
While in the hospital, recovering from sur-
gery and a collapsed lung, he was angry but 
told relatives and friends who visited him 
that he didn’t want any more violence, no re-
taliation. He said he would have liked to 
have seen whoever shot him go to jail but no 
arrests were made. 
He participated in the Christopher 2X 
‘‘Hood2Hood’’ 
antiviolence 
campaign, 
preaching non-violence door-to-door and in 
neighborhoods and remains active in anti-vi-
olence and community service programs. 
‘‘The violence going on now is terrible, 
crazy,’’ he said. ‘‘People don’t even want to 
go outside because of what is going on.’’ 
73—Number of homicides in Louisville in 
the first nine months of 2019, an increase of 
nearly 20 percent compared to the first nine 
months of 2018 when 61 murders were com-
mitted. 
72.6%—53, of the 73 homicide victims in the 
first nine months of 2019 were black com-
pared to 63% for the same time period in 
2018. 
32%—of the victims, 25 killed, were under 
age 25, with eight victims 11–17 years old. 
One victim was under age 11. 
Homicides: 2014: 55; 2015: 80; 2016: 118; 2017: 
102; 2018: 80. 
89% of the 73 murder victims, 65 people, in 
the first nine months of 2019 were killed by 
gunfire, the highest percentage of homicides 
by gunfire for a comparable time period in 
the past five years.

TRIBUTE TO ALGENE SAJERY 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I 
rise to thank Algene Sajery, a senior 
member of my foreign policy legisla-
tive staff, for her incredible service to 
the State of Maryland, our country, 
and by virtue of her foreign policy and 
national security legislative achieve-
ments, to the international commu-
nity. I am incredibly grateful for all 
that we have accomplished during her 
tenure. 
Algene has served as my senior for-
eign policy and national security advi-
sor since 2012 and concurrently as 
democratic policy director for the Sen-
ate Committee on Foreign Relations 
from 2015 through 2018. Over the years, 
Algene has served as my lead staff au-
thor and/or negotiator of several land-
mark national security and foreign pol-
icy 
laws, 
including 
the 
Global 
Magnitsky Human Rights and Ac-
countability Act, P.L. 114–328; the For-
eign Aid Transparency and Account-
ability Act, P.L. 114–191; the African 
Growth and Opportunity Act and Mil-
lennium Challenge Act Modernization 
Act, AGOA and MCA Modernization 
Act, P.L. 115–167; the Global Food Se-
curity Act, P.L. 114–195; and the Elec-
trify Africa Act, P.L. 114–121. These ac-
complishments demonstrate the wide- 
ranging policy areas over which Algene 
has extensive knowledge. Her ability to 
leverage her knowledge to help nego-
tiate and advance such policies into 
law and her passion for doing so are 
what set Algene apart from most oth-
ers in this highly competitive field. 
But Algene’s accomplishments do not 
end with advancing landmark human 
rights, transparency, foreign assist-
ance, and international development 
legislation. Algene has also worked 
tirelessly at my direction on several 
bills related to human rights in con-
flict zones, including the Syrian War 
Crimes Accountability Act and the Elie 
Wiesel Genocide and Atrocities Preven-
tion Act P.L. 115–441. Algene’s efforts 
have helped cement my legacy in these 
arenas and as Special Representative 
for Anti-Semitism, Racism, Intoler-
ance for the Organization for Security 
and Cooperation in Europe—OSCE— 
Parliamentary Assembly, to help pro-
pel my work to create a world where 
the promise of ‘‘never again’’ in re-
sponse to genocide will one day bear 
truth. 
Our work together has transcended 
several Presidential administrations. 
We have observed Executive overstep 
with regard to war powers on numerous 
occasions. We have opened our eyes to 
the use of U.S. manufactured weapons 
to commit war crimes and repress 
human rights around the world. In re-
sponse, Algene and I also developed my 
signature arms sales oversight legisla-
tion, the Enhancing Human Rights 
Protections in Arms Sales Act of 2019, 
and numerous bills, resolutions, and 
amendments on authorization of use of 
military 
force, 
conflict 
prevention, 
peace and reconciliation, and commu-
nity resiliency policies. 
Algene’s successful legislative record 
is testament not only to her expertise 
on foreign policy and national security 
issues but also to her keen negotiating 
skills, ability to work across the aisle, 
and incomparable political acumen. 
But Algene’s service on my legislative 
staff has gone far and beyond helping 
me draft and advance legislation. One 
of 
the 
most 
striking 
qualities 
of 
Algene’s character and, in my opinion, 
one of the most noteworthy accom-
plishments as a part of her distinct leg-
acy on my team, is her dedication to 
helping others around her. 
Algene is one of only a handful of 
women of color working on foreign pol-
icy and national security issues and 
the first African-American woman to 
serve in a leadership position on the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
Over the years, she has served as a 
mentor to women of color at various 
stages in their careers, offering advice, 
support, and guidance. Algene has al-
ways made time to support those 
around her because she understands 
the challenges of launching and navi-
gating a career in foreign policy and 
national security, and she genuinely 
wants to propel others towards simi-
larly successful career paths. 
Algene is a highly effective legisla-
tive negotiator, strategist, coalition 
builder, and a true trailblazer. Her 
knowledge and expertise are unparal-
leled, but her passion, creativity, and 
tenacity truly are what have made her 
an asset to my team and a voice that I 
will greatly miss in my office. 
It has been an honor working with 
Algene over the years, and I wish her 
nothing but happiness and success as 
she transitions her career off Capitol 
Hill.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO SCOTT BENNETT 
∑ Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize the career of Scott 
Bennett, who is retiring as director of 
the Arkansas Department of Transpor-
tation after nearly 32 years of service 
and dedication to the State. 
Scott assumed his current post as di-
rector in 2011; however, he has been an 
asset to ARDOT since his summers as 
an engineering intern. Scott’s hard 
work, passion, and knowledge allowed 
him to build a celebrated career that 
has greatly benefited the State and its 
citizens. He received a bachelor’s de-
gree in civil engineering from the Uni-
versity of Arkansas in 1989 and became 
a full-time employee of the Planning 
and Research Division. He also earned 
a master’s degree in civil engineering 
in 1994 while working for ARDOT. 
During the past 9 years, his effective 
and influential leadership has been in-
disputable. Scott led ARDOT’s efforts 
to implement significant highway re-
habilitation efforts, including the 2011 
Interstate Rehabilitation Program and 
the 2012 Connecting Arkansas Program, 
both of which were approved by voters. 
Scott is an active leader in the trans-
portation 
and 
engineering 
commu-
nities in the State and at the national 
level. He was appointed to the Arkan-
sas Board of Licensure for Professional 
Engineers and Professional Land Sur-
veyors in 2015, where he currently 
serves as president. In 2017, Scott was 
elected 
secretary-treasurer 
of 
the 
American Association of State High-
way and Transportation Officials, after 
previously serving as a member of the 
board of directors. Scott has served on 
other various organizations to support 
the transportation industry and im-
prove roadways for all Americans. 
Scott has earned many accolades 
over the course of his career. The 
American Association of State High-
way and Transportation Officials pre-
sented him with the Thomas H. Mac-
Donald Memorial Award, which recog-
nizes top engineers in the transpor-
tation profession. In 2005, he received 
the University of Arkansas Young En-
gineer Alumni of the Year Award, and 
in 2019 he was honored with the Univer-
sity 
of 
Arkansas 
College 
of 
Engineering’s 
Distinguished 
Alumni 
Award. In 2010, Scott was inducted into 
the Arkansas Academy of Civil Engi-
neering. 
I applaud Scott for his accomplished 
career with the Arkansas Department

REMEMBERING HAROLD HOWARD 
‘‘SONNY’’ HOWELL II 
∑ Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor a proud West Virginian, 
a dedicated public servant, a beloved 
husband, father, grandfather, and a 
dear friend to all who had the pleasure 
of knowing him. It is a privilege to rec-
ognize the life and legacy of Mayor 
Harold Howard ‘‘Sonny’’ Howell II for 
his many years of dedicated service to 
the city of Madison, Boone County, and 
to our entire home State. 
Gayle and I are heartbroken to learn 
of the passing of our dear friend Sonny. 
My uncle, the late A. James Manchin, 
and Sonny were the closest of friends. 
I first met Sonny in the 1970s and he re-
mained an absolute unconditional, life-
long friend. I have met many unique 
people throughout the years, but no-
body compared to Sonny. He was a true 
example of what it means to be a pub-
lic servant, having served in the U.S. 
Army, as justice of the peace, Boone 
County Circuit clerk, and for many 
years as mayor of Madison. 
Born and raised in Madison, Sonny 
was a member of the Madison United 
Methodist Church for more than 80 
years. He was a 1956 graduate of Scott 
High School, and he attended West Vir-
ginia Wesleyan College, Morris Harvey 
College, and West Virginia State Col-
lege. He was a member of the Masonic 
O’Dell Lodge, Beni Kedem Shrine, 
Royal Order of the Jesters, Madison 
Rotary Club, Paul Harris Fellow for 
Rotary International, Member of the 
Municipal League, and a recipient of 
the 35th Star from my uncle A. James 
Manchin. He and his wife Onia have 
been the owners of Howell Rental, a 
family business started by Sonny’s fa-
ther in 1940. 
There is a lot to be said of someone 
who bravely serves our Nation, then re-
turns home to continue giving back to 
the community that made them who 
they are. When visitors come to West 
Virginia, I jump at the chance to tell 
them we have fought in more wars, 
shed more blood, and lost more lives 
for the cause of freedom than most any 
State. We have always done the heavy 
lifting and never complained. We have 
mined the coal and forged the steel 
that built the guns, ships, and factories 
that have protected and continue to 
protect our country to this day. I am 
so deeply proud of what West Vir-
ginians have accomplished and what 
they will continue to accomplish to 
protect the freedoms we hold dear. 
That is Sonny’s legacy, and his cour-
age, loyalty, and humility will never be 
forgotten. 
Put simply, Sonny represented the 
very best of West Virginia, which is 
saying quite a lot. In the Mountain 
State, if you are hungry, you will be 
fed. If you are lost, someone will not 
only give you directions but will offer 
to drive you to your destination. That 
is just who we are, and that is who 
Sonny was. We have lost a shining star 
in Boone County, but his impact, vi-
sion, and his passion for this special 
community will last forever. It was an 
honor to have known him and to call 
him my friend. He never met a stranger 
and always had time to share a story. 
What is most important is that 
Sonny lived a full life, surrounded by 
dear friends and family. It is my hope 
that his loved ones are able to find 
peace, strength, and support in one an-
other. I extend my condolences to his 
wife of 59 years, Onia, his son Kip, his 
daughter-in-law Deanna, his grand-
children Harry and Meredith, sister-in- 
law Marilyn, brother-in-law Mike, and 
a host of nieces and nephews, who lov-
ingly referred to him as Uncle Son. 
Again, I extend to you my most sincere 
condolences for our loss of this wonder-
ful person. The unwavering love Sonny 
had for his family, friends, community, 
and our home State will live on forever 
in the hearts of all who knew him.∑

MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT

secretaries. 
f 
PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE 
REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION 
OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY 
ORIGINALLY DECLARED IN EX-
ECUTIVE ORDER 13288 OF MARCH 
6, 2003, WITH RESPECT TO THE 
ACTIONS AND POLICIES OF CER-
TAIN MEMBERS OF THE GOV-
ERNMENT 
OF 
ZIMBABWE 
AND 
OTHER PERSONS TO UNDERMINE 
ZIMBABWE’S DEMOCRATIC PROC-
ESSES OR INSTITUTIONS—PM 49 
The PRESIDING OFFICER laid be-
fore the Senate the following message 
from the President of the United 
States, together with an accompanying 
report, which was referred to the Com-
mittee 
on 
Banking, 
Housing, 
and 
Urban Affairs: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides 
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90 
days before the anniversary date of its 
declaration, the President publishes in 
the Federal Register and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to 
the Federal Register for publication the 
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency declared in Executive 
Order 13288 of March 6, 2003, with re-
spect to the actions and policies of cer-
tain members of the Government of 
Zimbabwe and other persons to under-
mine Zimbabwe’s democratic processes 
or institutions is to continue in effect 
beyond March 6, 2020. 
In the wake of the resignation of 
former President Robert Mugabe in No-
vember 2017, Zimbabwe’s national elec-
tions in July 2018, and President 
Mugabe’s subsequent death in Sep-
tember 2019, Zimbabwe has had ample 
opportunity to implement reforms that 
could set the country on a constructive 
path, stabilize the southern African re-
gion, and open the door to greater co-
operation with the United States. Un-
fortunately, 
President 
Emmerson 
Mnangagwa’s administration has yet 
to signal credible political will to im-
plement such reforms. Indeed, the 
Zimbabwean government has arguably 
accelerated its persecution of critics 
and economic mismanagement in the 
past year, during which security forces 
have conducted extrajudicial killings, 
rapes, and alleged abductions of numer-
ous dissidents. 
These actions and policies by certain 
members 
of 
the 
Government 
of 
Zimbabwe and other persons to under-
mine Zimbabwe’s democratic processes 
or institutions continue to pose an un-
usual and extraordinary threat to the 
foreign policy of the United States. 
Therefore, I have determined that it is 
necessary to continue the national 
emergency declared in Executive Order 
13288 with respect to Zimbabwe. 
DONALD J. TRUMP.

S. RES. 527 
Whereas Australia and the United States 
have long held a unique relationship, marked 
by close diplomatic, security, and economic 
cooperation; 
Whereas Australia and the United States 
celebrated 100 years of mateship on July 4, 
2018, marking the 100-year anniversary of the 
Battle of Hamel, which helped turn the tide 
of World War I; 
Whereas the United States and Australia 
are entering the seventieth anniversary of 
the Australia, New Zealand, United States 
Security Treaty (ANZUS Treaty), the 1951 
collective security non-binding agreement 
between Australia and New Zealand and, sep-
arately, Australia and the United States, to

Whereas the United States and Australia 
have shared firefighting resources, including 
specialist firefighters, for over 15 years; 
Whereas the United States and Australia 
are experiencing some of the hottest and dri-
est weather conditions on record, exacer-
bating the threat of wildfires and contrib-
uting to longer wildfire seasons in both na-
tions; 
Whereas over 100 Australian firefighters 
traveled to the United States in August 2018, 
to assist with efforts to contain wildfires 
that threatened communities in California, 
Oregon, and Washington; 
Whereas over 300 American firefighters

SENATE RESOLUTION 528—RECOG-
NIZING 
THE 
IMPORTANCE 
OF 
THE BLUEBERRY INDUSTRY TO 
THE UNITED STATES AND DES-
IGNATING 
JULY 
2020 
AS 
‘‘NA-
TIONAL BLUEBERRY MONTH’’ 
Ms. STABENOW submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 528 
Whereas the blueberry is a fruit native to 
North America that was first used fresh and 
dried in food and medicines by Native Ameri-
cans, who introduced blueberries to early 
colonists, which led to new uses and forms of 
blueberries, including frozen, establishing 
traditions still observed in 2020; 
Whereas the pioneering work conducted in 
New Jersey in the early 1900s by Elizabeth 
White and Dr. Frederick Coville, a botanist 
at the Department of Agriculture, to domes-
ticate wild lowbush blueberries resulted in 
the development of the hybrid for cultivated 
highbush blueberries; 
Whereas, because of those early efforts, 
highbush blueberries are large, sweet, juicy 
berries that can be commercially produced 
and shipped, allowing the highbush blueberry 
industry to become an important agricul-
tural industry in the United States; 
Whereas highbush blueberries— 
(1) have a harvested area estimated at 
more than 97,000 acres; and 
(2) are produced in 48 States by more than 
14,000 growers and their families; 
Whereas highbush blueberry production in 
the United States has continually increased, 
with particular growth during the first 2 dec-
ades of the 21st century, reaching a harvest 
of 551,100,000 pounds in 2018; 
Whereas blueberries are— 
(1) low in fat; and 
(2) a source of fiber, vitamins, and min-
erals; 
Whereas blueberries are being studied to 
examine the role that the berries may play 
in promoting good health in areas such as 
cardiovascular health, brain health, exercise, 
insulin response, and gut health; and 
Whereas highbush blueberries are har-
vested in the United States from April 
through early September, with the peak of 
the harvest occurring in July: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates July 2020 as ‘‘National Blue-
berry Month’’; 
(2) recognizes the contributions of blue-
berry growers in the United States and their 
families; and 
(3) recognizes that purchasing blueberries 
grown in the United States supports farmers, 
jobs, and the economy of the United States. 
SENATE RESOLUTION 529—DESIG-
NATING FEBRUARY 29, 2020, AS 
‘‘RARE DISEASE DAY’’ 
Mr. BROWN (for himself, Mr. BAR-
RASSO, Mr. MARKEY, Ms. KLOBUCHAR, 
Mr. BOOKER, Mr. WHITEHOUSE, Mr. 
BLUMENTHAL, Mr. WICKER, and Mr. 
COONS) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was considered and agreed 
to: 
S. RES. 529 
Whereas a rare disease or disorder is a dis-
ease or disorder that affects a small number 
of patients; 
Whereas, in the United States, a rare dis-
ease or disorder typically affects fewer than 
200,000 individuals; 
Whereas, as of the date of the adoption of 
this resolution, more than 7,000 rare diseases 
or disorders affect approximately 30,000,000 
individuals in the United States and their 
families; 
Whereas children with rare diseases or dis-
orders account for a significant portion of 
the population affected by rare diseases or 
disorders in the United States; 
Whereas many rare diseases and disorders 
are serious and life-threatening and lack ef-
fective treatments; 
Whereas, as a result of the enactment of 
the Orphan Drug Act (Public Law 97–414; 96 
Stat. 2049), important advances have been 
made in the research and treatment of rare 
diseases and disorders; 
Whereas the Food and Drug Administra-
tion has made strides in gathering patient 
perspectives to inform the drug review proc-
ess as part of the Patient-Focused Drug De-
velopment program, an initiative that was 
reaffirmed under the FDA Reauthorization 
Act of 2017 (Public Law 115–52; 131 Stat. 1005); 
Whereas, although the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration has approved more than 840 or-
phan indications for drugs and biological 
products for the treatment of rare diseases 
and disorders, millions of individuals in the 
United States have a rare disease or disorder 
for which there is no approved treatment; 
Whereas limited treatment options and dif-
ficulty obtaining reimbursement for life-al-
tering and lifesaving treatments can be chal-
lenging for individuals with rare diseases or 
disorders and their families; 
Whereas rare diseases and disorders in-
clude acrodermatitis enteropathica, med-
ulloblastoma, Hartnup disease, mast cell ac-
tivation 
syndrome, 
Usher 
syndrome, 
osteosarcoma, Kabuki syndrome, Fanconi 
anemia, 
Neurofibromatosis, 
NGLY1 
defi-
ciency, Chandler’s syndrome, tularemia, and 
Joubert syndrome; 
Whereas individuals with rare diseases or 
disorders can experience difficulty in obtain-
ing accurate diagnoses and finding physi-
cians or treatment centers with expertise in 
their rare disease or disorder; 
Whereas the 115th Congress passed a 10- 
year extension of the Children’s Health In-
surance Program under title XXI of the So-
cial Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1397aa et seq.), 
ensuring health insurance coverage for many 
children with rare diseases or disorders; 
Whereas the Food and Drug Administra-
tion and the National Institutes of Health 
support research on the treatment of rare 
diseases and disorders; 
Whereas 2020 marks the 37th anniversary of 
the enactment of the Orphan Drug Act (Pub-
lic Law 97–414; 96 Stat. 2049); 
Whereas Rare Disease Day is observed each 
year on the last day of February; 
Whereas, in 2020, Rare Disease Day falls on 
the rarest of days, February 29; 
Whereas Rare Disease Day is a global event 
that was first observed in the United States 
on February 28, 2009, and was observed in 
more than 100 countries in 2019; and 
Whereas Rare Disease Day is expected to 
be observed globally for years to come, pro-
viding hope and information for rare disease 
and disorder patients around the world: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates February 29, 2020, as ‘‘Rare 
Disease Day’’; and 
(2) recognizes the importance of, with re-
spect to rare diseases and disorders— 
(A) improving awareness; 
(B) encouraging accurate and early diag-
nosis; and 
(C) supporting national and global efforts 
to develop effective treatments, diagnostics, 
and cures.

SENATE RESOLUTION 530—DESIG-
NATING MARCH 4, 2020, AS ‘‘NA-
TIONAL ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY 
AWARENESS DAY’’ 
Mr. CASEY (for himself and Mr. 
CRAMER) submitted the following reso-
lution; 
which 
was 
considered 
and 
agreed to: 
S. RES. 530 
Whereas assistive technology is any item, 
piece of equipment, or product system that 
is used to increase, maintain, or improve the 
functional capabilities of individuals with 
disabilities and older adults; 
Whereas the term ‘‘assistive technology 
service’’ means any service that directly as-
sists an individual with a disability or an 
older adult in the selection, acquisition, or 
use of an assistive technology device; 
Whereas, in 2018, the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention reported that 1 in 4 
individuals in the United States, or almost 
61,000,000 individuals, has a disability; 
Whereas, in 2017, the Department of Edu-
cation reported that there were more than 
7,000,000 children with disabilities; 
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention reported that, among adults 
65 years of age and older, 2 in 5 have a dis-
ability; 
Whereas assistive technology allows indi-
viduals with disabilities and older adults to 
be included in their communities and in in-
clusive classrooms and workplaces; 
Whereas assistive technology devices and 
services are necessities, not luxury items, for 
millions of individuals with disabilities and 
older adults, without which they would be 
unable to live in their communities, access 
education, or obtain, retain, and advance 
gainful, 
competitive, 
integrated 
employ-
ment; 
Whereas the availability of assistive tech-
nology in the workplace promotes economic 
self-sufficiency, enhances work participa-
tion, and is critical to the employment of in-
dividuals with disabilities and older adults; 
and 
Whereas State assistive technology pro-
grams support a continuum of services that 
include— 
(1) the exchange, repair, recycling, and 
other reutilization of assistive technology 
devices; 
(2) device loan programs that provide 
short-term loans of assistive technology de-
vices to individuals, employers, public agen-
cies, and others; 
(3) the demonstration of devices to inform 
decision making; and 
(4) State financing to help individuals pur-
chase or obtain assistive technology through 
a variety of initiatives, such as financial 
loan programs, leasing programs, and other 
financing alternatives, that give individuals 
affordable, flexible options to purchase or

determine the estimated energy savings of 
the subject property; and 
(B) a requirement that the estimated en-
ergy savings of the subject property be added 
to the appraised value of the subject prop-
erty by a mortgagee or the Administration 
for the purpose of determining the loan-to- 
value ratio of the subject property, unless 
the appraisal includes the value of the over-
all energy efficiency of the subject property, 
using methods to be established under the 
guidelines issued under paragraph (1). 
(3) DETERMINATION
OF
ESTIMATED
ENERGY 
SAVINGS.— 
(A) AMOUNT
OF
ENERGY
SAVINGS.—The 
amount of estimated energy savings shall be 
determined by calculating the difference be-
tween the estimated energy costs for the av-
erage comparable houses, as determined in 
guidelines to be issued under paragraph (1), 
and the estimated energy costs for the sub-
ject property based upon the energy effi-
ciency report.

ration of the estimated energy savings shall 
be based upon the estimated life of the appli-
cable equipment, consistent with the rating 
system used to produce the energy efficiency 
report. 
(C) PRESENT VALUE OF ENERGY SAVINGS.— 
The present value of the future savings shall 
be discounted using the average interest rate 
on conventional 30-year mortgages, in the 
manner directed by guidelines issued under 
paragraph (1). 
(4) ENSURING CONSIDERATION OF ENERGY EF-
FICIENT
FEATURES.—Section 1110 of the Fi-
nancial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and

following: 
‘‘(C) LOANS
FOR
ENERGY
EFFICIENCY
SAV-
INGS.— 
‘‘(i) IN GENERAL.—The Administration may 
make loans under this section to a borrower 
in an amount greater than the maximum 
amount under subparagraph (A)(i) if the loan 
proceeds are directed toward a project that 
results in energy savings for a small business 
concern as a result of the installation or im-
plementation of energy efficiency improve-
ments. 
‘‘(ii) AMOUNT.—The Administration may 
increase the maximum amount under sub-
paragraph (A)(i) for a small business concern 
by not more than the amount equal to the 
anticipated increased income or resources 
due to energy savings from the project.’’. 
(2) GUIDANCE FOR LOAN UNDERWRITING.—Not 
later than 180 days after the date of enact-
ment of this Act, the Administrator shall 
issue guidance requiring covered lenders to 
incorporate energy efficiency considerations 
and life-cycle cost savings into the under-
writing process for loans provided under title 
V of the Small Business Investment Act of 
1958 (15 U.S.C. 695 et seq.) and section 7(a) of 
the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 636(a)). 
(3) EXISTING FEDERAL PROGRAMS.—Nothing 
in this subsection or the amendments made 
by this subsection shall be construed to re-
strict or otherwise affect efforts of the Fed-
eral Government in existence on the day be-
fore the date of enactment of this Act that 
would expand financing opportunities for 
small business concerns. 
(d) WORKING GROUP
AND UTILITY-LENDER 
FINANCING INCENTIVE PILOT PROGRAM.— 
(1) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
(A) Small businesses account for more 
than 90 percent of utility commercial cus-
tomers and nearly half of all commercial 
electricity usage. 
(B) According to the National Small Busi-
ness Association, small businesses, particu-
larly those with fewer than 35 employees in 
the manufacturing sector, pay 35 percent 
more per unit for their electricity than com-
parable larger firms. 
(C) Utility-administered energy efficiency 
programs, including on-bill financing— 
(i) reduce or eliminate the first costs for 
energy efficiency improvements; 
(ii) leverage existing billing relationships 
between consumers and utilities; 
(iii) can be tied to a property so that en-
ergy savings are transferred to multiple own-
ers or tenants; 
(iv) incur low default rates ranging from 0 
to 3 percent; and 
(v) have been implemented in 23 States. 
(D) Utilities have encountered challenges 
to the widespread adoption of on-bill financ-
ing programs among small businesses, in-
cluding— 
(i) modification of utility billing systems 
in order to provide on-bill financing options 
to customers; 
(ii) desire among utilities to act as a finan-
cial institution; 
(iii) insufficient human resources to navi-
gate or comply with Federal and State regu-
latory reporting requirements involved with 
the implementation of on-bill financing pro-
grams; and 
(iv) risk of non-payment and challenges as-
sociated with non-payment penalties for cus-
tomers. 
(E) Because of the challenges for utilities 
described in subparagraph (D), participation 
rates for on-bill financing programs among 
small businesses are generally low. 
(F) Federal agency action can encourage 
on-bill financing programs and maximize 
their impact on the small business sector. 
(2) REQUIREMENT.—The Administrator shall 
carry out efforts to advance the availability 
and utilization of utility-based financing 
programs for energy efficiency improve-
ments among small business entities. 
(3) CREATION

program in accordance with this section; and 
(B) phasing down the consumption of regu-
lated 
substances 
in 
the 
United 
States 
through an allowance allocation and trading 
program in accordance with the schedule 
under paragraph (2)(C) (subject to the same 
exceptions and other requirements as are ap-
plicable to the phase-down of production of 
regulated substances under this section). 
(4) EXCEPTIONS.— 
(A) FEEDSTOCKS AND PROCESS AGENTS.—Ex-
cept for the reporting requirements de-
scribed in subsection (d)(1), this section does 
not apply to— 
(i) a regulated substance that is used and 
entirely consumed (except for trace quan-
tities) in the manufacture of another chem-
ical; or 
(ii) a regulated substance that is used and 
not entirely consumed in the manufacture of 
another chemical, if the remaining amounts 
of the regulated substance are subsequently 
destroyed. 
(B) ESSENTIAL USES.— 
(i) IN GENERAL.—Not earlier than January 
1, 2034, the Administrator may, after notice 
and opportunity for public comment, author-
ize the production or consumption of a regu-
lated substance for a period of not more than 
5 years in a quantity in excess of the quan-
tities authorized under paragraph (2)(A) for 
the exclusive use of the regulated substance 
in an application with respect to which the 
Administrator determines that— 
(I) no substitute will be available during 
the applicable period for that application, 
considering 
technological 
achievability, 
commercial demands, safety, and other rel-
evant factors; and 
(II) the total supply of the regulated sub-
stance authorized under paragraph (2)(A), in-
cluding any quantities of a regulated sub-
stance available from reclaiming, prior pro-
duction, or prior import, is insufficient to 
accommodate the application. 
(ii) LIMITATION.—No person receiving an 
authorization under clause (i) may, on an an-
nual basis, produce or consume a quantity of 
a regulated substance that is greater than 10 
percent of the quantity that the person pro-
duced or consumed to contribute to the pro-
duction baseline or the consumption base-
line, as applicable. 
(iii) REVIEW.— 
(I) IN GENERAL.—For each application for 
which the Administrator has authorized the 
production or consumption, as applicable, of 
a regulated substance under clause (i), the 
Administrator shall review the availability 
of substitutes, including any quantities of 
the regulated substance available from re-
claiming or prior production, not less fre-
quently than once every 5 years, considering 
technological achievability, commercial de-
mands, safety, and other relevant factors. 
(II) EXTENSION.—If the Administrator de-
termines, subject to notice and opportunity 
for public comment, that no substitute will 
be available for an application for which the 
Administrator granted a waiver under clause 
(i) during a subsequent period, the Adminis-
trator may authorize the production or con-
sumption, as applicable, of any regulated 
substance used in the application for not 
more than an additional 5 years in a quan-
tity in excess of the quantity authorized 
under paragraph (2)(A) for exclusive use in 
the application. 
(5) 
DOMESTIC
MANUFACTURING.—Notwith-
standing paragraph (2)(A)(i), the Adminis-
trator may authorize a person to produce a 
regulated substance in excess of the number 
of production allowances held by that per-
son, subject to the conditions that— 
(A) the authorization is— 
(i) for a renewable period of not more than 
5 years; and 
(ii) subject to notice and opportunity for 
public comment; and 
(B) the production— 
(i) is at a facility located in the United 
States; 
(ii) is solely for export to, and use in, a for-
eign country that is not subject to the prohi-
bition in subsection (j)(1); and 
(iii) would not violate paragraph (2)(B). 
(f) ACCELERATED SCHEDULE.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Subject to paragraph (4), 
the Administrator may, in response to a pe-
tition submitted to the Administrator in ac-
cordance with paragraph (3) and after notice 
and opportunity for public comment, pro-
mulgate regulations that establish a sched-
ule for phasing down the production or con-
sumption of regulated substances that is 
more stringent than the production and con-
sumption levels of regulated substances re-
quired under subsection (e)(2)(C) if, based on 
the availability of substitutes for regulated 
substances, the Administrator determines 
that a more-stringent schedule is prac-
ticable, taking into account technological

the regulated substance is used. 
(2) NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING.— 
(A) CONSIDERATION REQUIRED.—Before pro-
posing a rule for the use of a regulated sub-
stance for a sector or subsector under para-
graph (1), the Administrator shall consider 
negotiating with stakeholders in the sector 
or subsector subject to the potential rule in 
accordance with the negotiated rulemaking 
procedure provided for under subchapter III 
of chapter 5 of title 5, United States Code 
(commonly known as the ‘‘Negotiated Rule-
making Act of 1990’’). 
(B) NEGOTIATED RULEMAKINGS.—If the Ad-
ministrator negotiates a rulemaking with 
stakeholders using the procedure described 
in subparagraph (A), the Administrator 
shall, to the extent practicable, give priority 
to completing that rulemaking over com-
pleting rulemakings that were not nego-
tiated using that procedure. 
(C) NO NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING.—If the Ad-
ministrator does not negotiate a rulemaking 
with stakeholders using the procedure de-
scribed in subparagraph (A), the Adminis-
trator shall, before commencement of the 
rulemaking process for a rule under para-
graph (1), publish an explanation of the deci-
sion of the Administrator to not use that 
procedure. 
(3) TRANSITION.— 
(A) PROPOSALS.—Not later than 18 months 
after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
Administrator shall publish in the Federal 
Register a proposal of 1 or more dates after 
which the use of a regulated substance in a 
sector or subsector shall be restricted. 
(B) 
FINAL

HONORING 50 YEARS OF BATES 
HOUSE OF TURKEY IN GREEN-
VILLE, ALABAMA 
HON. MARTHA ROBY 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 4, 2020 
Mrs. ROBY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor and celebrate the 50th Anniversary of 
Bates House of Turkey in the City of Green-
ville, Alabama. 
On March 1, 1970, the late W.C. ‘‘Bill’’ 
Bates, Jr. and wife, Teresa Carlton Bates, 
opened the doors of legendary Bates House 
of Turkey in Greenville, Alabama for the first 
time. As the second generation of Bates Tur-
key Farm, they became a driving force behind 
not only the farm’s success, but also in the 
success of the iconic restaurant. 
Following the completion of Interstate 65, 
the entrepreneurial visionaries, Bill and Teresa 
Bates, decided to buy property and build the 
restaurant in Greenville, making the conscious 
decision to serve only turkey dishes made 
from free-range birds grown on their farm. In 
addition to Bates House of Turkey being one 
of the most unique restaurants in Alabama, it 
has also become one of the most popular 
spots for commuters to stop and grab a bite 
to eat while traveling through Butler County 
along I–65. 
Now, over 50 years later, Bates House of 
Turkey is still a family-owned restaurant where 
locals and non-locals alike gather for dishes 
such as their famous hickory smoked turkey 
sandwich or their old-fashioned roast turkey 
dinner. The Bates children, grandchildren, and 
great grandchildren have been successful in 
continuing the family legacy and keeping the 
restaurant alive and thriving. 
As the staff and loyal patrons gather to cele-
brate this wonderful achievement, I ask all my 
colleagues to join me in honoring the Bates 
family for their profoundly positive contribu-
tions to the Greenville community and sur-
rounding area.

RECOGNIZING JAY VOGT 
HON. DUSTY JOHNSON 
OF SOUTH DAKOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 4, 2020 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor 
Jay Vogt for his appointment to the Advisory 
Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP). 
A South Dakota native, Mr. Vogt has been 
a passionate servant for the preservation his-
torical places across the state of South Dakota 
and the entire nation. 
Mr. Vogt served as Director of the South 
Dakota State Historical Society and State His-
toric Preservation Officer. In the past, he 
served as the president of the National Con-
ference of State Historic Preservation Officers 
(NCSHPO) and represented NCSHPO on the 
ACHP for several years. After a decade of 
service, Mr. Vogt was appointed Deputy Direc-
tor of the South Dakota State Historical Soci-
ety in 1999, where he spearheaded the pres-
ervation of historic Deadwood. 
Mr. Vogt has directed the State Historical 
Society since 2003 and oversees the manage-
ment of the five programs—archaeology, ar-
chives, museum, historic preservation, re-
search and publishing—and the administrative 
and development units. 
I commend Mr. Vogt for his outstanding 
record of service, dedication, and hard work. I 
extend my deepest congratulations to Jay 
Vogt for his contributions to South Dakota and 
our nation’s historical places. I look forward to 
working with Mr. Vogt’s as he advises both the 
president and Congress on historical preserva-
tion efforts across our nation. 
CELEBRATING 
THE 
CENTENNIAL 
OF THE AMERICAN LEGION POST 
181 IN BREA, CALIFORNIA 
HON. GILBERT RAY CISNEROS, JR. 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 4, 2020 
Mr. CISNEROS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the centennial of one of the 
finest institutions in the 39th Congressional 
District. On Monday night, January 5, 1920, a 
cold wind blew out of the San Gabriel Moun-
tains, through the Brea-Olinda Oil Field, the 
goat and sheep pastures, and into orange 
groves that surrounded the tiny hamlet of 
Brea. With little more than a thousand resi-
dents, Brea could hardly host a U.S. Post Of-
fice, but it held a small group of proud, deter-
mined men. They were American veterans of 
the Great War, and only 10 months after the 
founding of the national parent organization, 
with the ink still wet on national charter, they 
founded American Legion Post 181 in Brea, 
California. 
The founders of Brea Post 181 were men 
like Ted Craig who returned home to Brea in 
1919 and helped secure the charter and prop-
erty for the new Post only a few months after 
returning from ‘‘Over There.’’ Many had seen 
things, carried traumas off the battlefield and 
certainly bore emotional and physical scars of 
the first fully industrialized conflict. But their 
commitment to the Legion gave them a new 
mission, a common purpose and a way to 
channel the evils of war into a peace and 
prosperity that was good. The first line of the 
Legion’s mission statement pledges every 
member to re-dedicate themselves to ‘‘uphold 
and defend the Constitution of the United 
States.’’ But it requires more. Built into the 
very fiber of the Legion’s national mission is a 
commitment to programs that build better 
communities and a better country in five 
areas: From honoring America’s war dead and 
supporting the rehabilitation of our nations 
wounded warriors, to supporting a strong na-
tional defense, the patriotic education of 
younger generations and, most broadly, to 
build support for American ideals and values. 
And Brea Post 181 has been an exemplary 
participant in all five areas from its beginning 
with a city-wide Armistice Day Celebration on 
November 11, 1920, just ten months and five 
days after the Post’s founding. Carnivals, 
dances, bingo nights and parades have been 
an important part of the Post’s connection to 
the community. But the Post’s work has also 
included scholarship funding, the Boy’s Nation 
Program, voter registration, and a long-stand-
ing collaboration with the city’s patriotic cele-
brations, especially the annual 4th of July 
Country Fair. And our Brea Legion Post has 
always been there in times of crisis. In 1933, 
Brea Legionnaires reacted heroically to the 
major earthquake that so heavily impacted 
Long Beach. The Post hosted displaced fami-
lies, took care of the injured victims, and even 
stepped in to direct and coordinate recovery

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E256 
March 4, 2020 
resources. World War II may have been 181’s 
finest hour. With the founding generation 
being too old for direct military service, men 
like Eugene Streed—a proud Marine who had 
fought Bolshevism in Vladvostock in 1918– 
1919—led war drives, supervised civil defense 
activities and put on remembrances and me-
morials. In Streed’s case, this included 
handcrafting more than 1000 white crosses to 
identify veterans’ graves. He was also the co- 
founder of Brea’s Memory Garden, where 
American flags with the names of Brea’s lost 
soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines are dis-
played on Memorial Day. 
Brea is not such a small town as it was in 
Eugene Streed’s day. One hundred years 
later, its population, at well over forty thou-
sand, is 40 times the size of a rural village 
that gave birth to Brea Post 181. Yet, for all 
the city’s growth and for all that the Post has 
done to underwrite that growth, our local Brea 
Legion has not always prospered in the same 
way. Indeed, I would be remiss if I failed to 
point out the struggles. The demographic shift 
from the mid-twentieth century, when service 
was almost universal for physically qualified 
men, to today’s all-volunteer force has dra-
matically changed the recruiting and financing 
picture of the Legion. Local membership had 
declined so precipitously that by 2014, the 
Post had to sell a property it owned to avoid 
insolvency. It might have collapsed, and the 
story might have ended before this centennial 
celebration. But the warrior spirit has always 
been fierce among the veterans of Brea, and 
Post 181 has evolved to thrive in its new de-
mographic environment. The membership has 
made smart business decisions and even 
smarter partnership arrangements with other 
veterans and civic groups like Veterans of For-
eign Wars Post 5384 and St. Angela Merici 
Church. The Post has come through its crisis. 
It is more intergenerational than ever before 
with former Brea Mayor Carrey Nelson—a re-
tired Navy Master Chief who served in both 
the Second World and Korean Wars—still an 
active contributing member alongside current 
Brea Mayor Pro Tem and Brea Post 181 Com-
mander Steven Vargas, who is also a Chief 
Petty Officer in the Naval Reserves. I hope 
that other Legion Posts are beginning to thrive 
and reinvent themselves to meet a rapidly 
changing country that, however different, still 
needs a strong American Legion. As a mem-
ber of the neighboring Legion Post 277 in 
Placentia, as the son of a Vietnam combat 
veteran and grandson of two World War II 
combat veterans, but most of all, as a member 
of the House Armed Services and Veterans 
Affairs Committees, I congratulate and com-
mend the Legionaries of Brea Post 181 and 
wish them another century of excellence.

IN RECOGNITION OF ANAN AMERI 
AS 
SHE 
IS 
NAMED 
THE 
2020 
ARAB AMERICAN OF THE YEAR 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 4, 2020 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Dr. Anan Ameri as she is 
named the 2020 Arab American of the Year 
by ACCESS. Dr. Ameri’s lifetime of community 
service and activism is worthy of commenda-
tion, and we are proud to recognize her 
achievements today. 
Anan Ameri is a pillar of Washtenaw Coun-
ty. For over forty years, she has dedicated her 
career to advocating for social justice and eq-
uity, upholding immigrant rights, and pre-
serving Arab American stories. Dr. Ameri, an 
author, educator, and activist, is especially 
known in our community as the founding di-
rector for the Arab American National Mu-
seum. Thanks to her steadfast leadership and 
revolutionary vision, she secured the muse-
um’s Smithsonian affiliation, making it the only 
Arab American organization in the prestigious 
network. In addition, Dr. Ameri is the national 
president of the Palestine Aid Society of 
America and was inducted to Michigan’s Hall 
of Fame for her extraordinary efforts in 2016. 
Today, we celebrate Anan Ameri for her life-
time of service to her community. Born in Da-
mascus, Syria and raised in Amman, Jordan, 
Dr. Ameri understands the daily trials and 
tribulations immigrants experience. As such, 
she has advocated for their voices and con-
tinues to fight to ensure their rights are 
upheld. Beyond her career in activism, she 
also has served as a mentor to young women. 
She has nurtured women to pursue their 
dreams, strive for excellence, and embrace 
their heritage. Dr. Ameri truly embodies the 
hopes and dreams of immigrants coming to 
America and has made a difference in our 
Michigan community. Her years of service 
have impacted the lives of many, and her con-
tinued dedication provides a lasting example 
for what we should all endeavor to accom-
plish—to effect change, be compassionate 
community members, and do all we can to 
make a difference in the world. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Dr. Anan Ameri. Her decades 
of selfless service make her a deserving re-
cipient of the Arab American of the Year 
Award. I am grateful for her lasting impact and 
wish her continued success in the years 
ahead.

JUDGE MARVA CRENSHAW—BLACK 
HISTORY MONTH 
HON. KATHY CASTOR 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 4, 2020 
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to celebrate one of Florida’s most 
distinguished jurists—and one of the highest 
integrity. Judge Marva L. Crenshaw was born 
in 1951 in DeFuniak Springs, Florida, one of 
seven children. A child of faith, naturally re-
flective in her calm demeanor, she would epit-
omize a commitment to justice and the judicial 
temperament that would distinguish her serv-
ice on the bench. She is married to Norman 
Campbell and together they raised their two 
daughters, Kalinda and Kamaria. 
Growing up in the segregated south, Judge 
Crenshaw attended segregated schools during 
her formative years. She excelled in language 
arts and became inspired by the impact of the 
rule of law, an appreciation she acquired 
spending time with her grandfather as he at-
tended his affairs in her small town’s court-
house. She earned her bachelor’s degree with 
honors in 1973 from Tuskegee Institute, where 
she pledged as a Delta Sigma Theta and also 
became active in voter rights. She then 
achieved her childhood dream by earning her 
law degree from the University of Florida in 
1975. 
Judge Crenshaw began her dedication to 
public service as a prosecutor with the State 
Attorney’s Office under Richard Gerstein in 
Miami-Dade County, Florida. She was hired by 
Janet Reno, who would later become the U.S. 
Attorney General. She served in that capacity 
until arriving to the Tampa Bay community in 
1978 to join Bay Area Legal Services. She put 
her skills and legal acumen to work for fami-
lies who often faced financial barriers to the 
courthouse and the legal system. She pro-
vided important legal services to disadvan-
taged neighbors across Tampa Bay and was 
named the organization’s Deputy Director a 
decade later. 
In 1989, Governor Bob Martinez appointed 
her to the Hillsborough County Court. In 2000, 
Governor Jeb Bush appointed her as the first 
African American woman to serve on the Thir-
teenth Judicial Circuit Court. There she was 
assigned to civil, family, criminal and juvenile 
divisions—furthering her lifelong dream to 
serve the public and her community. In 2009, 
Governor Charlie Crist appointed her to the 
Second District Court of Appeal, where she 
presided until retirement in 2018. 
Judge Crenshaw broke barriers and charted 
a course for others who are committed to 
equal justice to follow. She set the highest of 
standards in her courtroom and in service to 
our community to ensure fairness. While re-
tirement marks the end of one chapter in her 
life, she continues to explore other opportuni-
ties to impact people’s lives through service. 
Judge Crenshaw has been extensively in-
volved in bar activities and was recognized as 
recently as 2019 with both the Hillsborough 
County Bar Association’s Robert W. Patton 
Outstanding Jurist Award and the Hillsborough 
Association of Women Lawyers’ Trailblazer 
Award. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the Tampa 
Bay community, I am humbled to honor Judge 
Marva L. Crenshaw during this Black History 
Month for her many years of selfless service 
and leadership, and for being a trailblazer and 
a shining light for justice for all.

HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS

Wednesday, March 4, 2020 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today

Peoria community and to honor her as a part 
of Black History Month. Bonnie spent 35 years 
in the public sector and was most recently a 
Program Assistant for the Women, Infants, 
and Children (WIC) Program. 
Bonnie Hester earned a certificate in Labor 
History from the University of Illinois and a 
Clerical Certificate from the Vocational School 
of Southern Illinois. Bonnie worked for the Pe-
oria City/County Health Department for 25 
years. Bonnie served on the Health Care 
Committee for Peoria County employees and 
was President of local AFSCME Union Chap-
ter No. 3665 for 14 years. She represented 
District 1 on the Peoria County Board for eight 
years and served as the board’s precinct com-
mittee person. 
Now retired, Bonnie serves on the Executive 
Board for the West Central Labor Council rep-
resenting AFSCME retirees and volunteers for 
the American Red Cross Disaster Services, 
the Heart of Illinois United Way, and the 
Make-A-Wish Foundation. She also serves on 
the school board for Peoria Christ Lutheran 
School, and is a long-time member of Christ 
Lutheran Church, where she teaches Sunday 
School. Bonnie and her husband, Jerry, have 
been married for 39 years and have three chil-
dren and six grandchildren. I commend Bonnie 
on her service to the Peoria community. 
It is because of community leaders such as 
Bonnie Hester that I am especially proud to 
serve Illinois’ 17th Congressional District. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to again formally 
recognize Bonnie Hester for her great work in 
the Peoria community and honor her as a part 
of Black History Month.

SUPPORT FOR THE SOCIAL 
SECURITY 2100 ACT 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 4, 2020 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, let me 
commend my colleague and friend Congress-
man JOHN LARSON, the chair of the Ways and 
Means Social Security Subcommittee, for his 
leadership and his legislation the Social Secu-
rity 2100 Act. He is a tireless advocate for up-
holding our promise to our seniors, with re-
spect to their retirement and their economic 
wellbeing. 
Perhaps the ultimate legislative expression 
of our nation’s shared values is our Social Se-
curity program. In 1935, our federal govern-
ment made a promise to American workers 
that if they worked hard all of their lives, they 
would not fall into poverty when they retire. 
Social Security is foundational to tens of mil-
lions’ Americans economic security as they re-
tire. It provides a stable and secure source of 
income for our nation’s seniors and their fami-
lies. We continue to keep that promise today, 
as Social Security lifts out of poverty 22 million 
seniors nationwide and 130,000 in Con-
necticut. 
In fact, according to the Economic Policy In-
stitute, quote, ‘‘Social Security remains by far 
the most important source of income for most 
seniors. It constitutes most of the income of 
seniors in the bottom half of the income dis-
tribution.’’ 
Yet, a cliff is coming. Social Security no 
longer stretches as far as it once did. Even 
with their Social Security benefits, more than 
5 percent of Connecticut’s seniors are living in 
poverty. And, if we do nothing, in less than 15 
years, Social Security benefits will be cut by 
nearly 25 percent. 
When Social Security does not keep up with 
the cost of living, or modern economic chal-
lenges, seniors are robbed of their dignity and 
independence. They suffer when we do not 
uphold our promise. That is why we need to 
protect and enhance Social Security and to 
ensure it is able to help those who need it. 
That is why we need the Social Security 2100 
Act. 
It was introduced by my dear friend Con-
gressman JOHN LARSON. I am an original co-
sponsor. The bill expands benefits, strength-
ens the Social Security trust fund, and cuts 
taxes for seniors. The bill and House Demo-
crats’ leadership is critical at a time when 
Americans are struggling with stagnant in-
comes and a lack of good-paying jobs. 
In total, this bill would boost benefits for 62 
million people. And, it will put the program on 
sound financial footing for the next 75 years. 
It does so with several smart steps, includ-
ing by having millionaires and billionaires pay 
the same tax rate as everyone else. For many 
Americans, this is commonsense. What is 
nonsensical, however, is that Republicans 
passed a $1.5 trillion tax giveaway for the 
wealthy and well-connected. 83 percent of the 
benefits go to the top 1 percent. 
Instead of a giveaway to the rich, it is time 
for an investment in working people and sen-
iors. That is what we are trying to do with the 
Social Security 2100 Act. 
Experts have pointed to its economic bene-
fits, for both individuals and the nation. For ex-
ample, former Council of Economic Advisors 
Chair Jason Furman and former Treasury 
Secretary Lawrence Summers, have said this 
legislation would positively impact economic 
growth. 
As President Franklin Delano Roosevelt 
said of Social Security in 1934, quote, ‘‘This 
seeking for a greater measure of welfare and 
happiness does not indicate a change of val-
ues. It is rather a return to values lost in the 
course of our economic development and ex-
pansion.’’ 
Values lost, an apt description for our econ-
omy today. Costs skyrocketing. Wages stall-
ing. Savings stagnating. And, seniors suf-
fering. But, with this legislation, we can be re-
turning to values lost, to upholding our prom-
ise, to ensuring economic security. 
All Americans must keep up the fight to pro-
tect and expand social safety net programs 
like Social Security, The 60 million Americans 
receiving Social Security and countless more 
who will receive it are counting on us, and we 
will deliver.

FEMA DISASTER PREPAREDNESS 
IMPROVEMENT ACT 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 4, 2020 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, today I 
introduce the ‘‘FEMA Disaster Preparedness 
Improvement Act,’’ with support from the Cali-
fornia Governor’s Office of Emergency Serv-
ices (Cal OES) and the California State Asso-
ciation of Counties. I want to thank my col-
league Congressman MIKE THOMPSON (D–CA) 
for his support as the original cosponsor. 
This legislation would increase FEMA sup-
port for disaster preparedness and emergency 
response to reflect the needs of communities 
across the country. As states like California 
face increasingly severe and frequent natural 
disasters due to man-made climate change 
and global public health emergencies, Con-
gress and the federal government must step 
up.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E258 
March 4, 2020 
The people most impacted by disasters and 
emergencies are often the most vulnerable 
members of our society: the elderly, the eco-
nomically disadvantaged, and those with dis-
abilities. All Americans deserve nothing less 
than the full-throated support of their federal 
government as they prepare for natural disas-
ters and deal with public health emergencies, 
and that is exactly what my legislation would 
ensure. 
As a member of California’s Congressional 
delegation, I have seen firsthand the devasta-
tion that disasters can have on communities. 
In 2017 and 2018, our state experienced the 
most destructive fires recorded in California 
history. The federal government must be a 
real partner for states as they prepare for 
these disasters and seek to make our commu-
nities more resilient. My district is also one of 
the most flood-prone in the entire nation, and 
Travis Air Force Base housed the first Amer-
ican evacuees from the coronavirus outbreak 
in East Asia. 
That is why the ‘‘FEMA Disaster Prepared-
ness Improvement Act’’ would increase the 
federal cost share under the Hazard Mitigation 
and Emergency Management Performance 
Grant Programs to 85 percent, from 75 per-
cent and 50 percent respectively. FEMA’s 
Emergency Performance Grant Program helps 
state and local officials manage public emer-
gencies including health crises, such as the 
recent coronavirus outbreak. 
My bill would also exempt environmental re-
views under federal or state law from the 36- 
month deadline to complete hazard mitigation 
projects and make designated ‘‘special flood 
hazard areas’’ under the National Flood Insur-
ance Program automatically eligible for FEMA 
Hazard Mitigation Grants. Lastly, the bill would 
direct the Government Accountability Office to 
report to Congress on the challenges faced by 
states in utilizing FEMA’s Public Assistance 
Program Alternative Procedures. 
Damaged caused by natural disasters in the 
United States has risen in recent years, with 
an average of 15 disasters with a cost of over 
a billion dollars between 2016 and 2018, more 
than double the average of the previous three 
decades. Congress must respond to this trou-
bling trend and better support vulnerable com-
munities across the country as they prepare 
and increase resilience to natural disasters 
and other public emergencies. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all Members to co-
sponsor the ‘‘FEMA Disaster Preparedness 
Improvement Act.’’ As a senior member of the 
House Committee on Transportation and Infra-
structure, I plan to make this critical legislation 
a major priority.

HONORING THE LIFE OF JOHN 
NIEDERMAN 
HON. JIM BANKS 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 4, 2020 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the life and career of John Niederman. 
Since 1985, John has poured his heart and 
soul into the outstanding work conducted by 
Pathfinder Services. 
Though born in New York, Indiana is proud 
to claim John as one of our own. A graduate 
of Fort Wayne’s own University of Saint 
Francis, he has spent over three decades 
working in Huntington with Pathfinder Services 
to help those who need it most. 
John embodies the purest form of Hoosier 
hospitality in his work, helping countless oth-
ers on their way to realizing greater economic, 
physical and developmental independence. He 
has been active is creating an environment 
that values inclusion and fairness, giving those 
whom he encounters the best chance possible 
to succeed and Jive out the American Dream. 
As John prepares to step down from a posi-
tion he has loved and excelled at, I have no 
doubt that he will continue to be a leader in 
his community and a shining example to those 
who seek him out. Huntington County, and all 
of Indiana, are blessed to continue to count 
John and his family as their own.

JUDGE PERRY LITTLE—BLACK 
HISTORY MONTH 
HON. KATHY CASTOR 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 4, 2020 
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor a jurist who has served our 
Tampa neighbors for decades—and continues 
his dedication to this day. Through his work 
spanning more than 40 years and as the sec-
ond African American appointed to the bench 
in Hillsborough County, which is the longest 
tenure for an African American judge in the 
county’s history, Judge Perry A. Little has 
helped shape our community forever. Judge 
Little is husband to Sonjia Latson Little and fa-
ther of three: Matthew (Nandie), Marissa and 
Josie. He is also the proud grandfather of four 
girls, Reigan, Ivy, Gabrielle and Eden, and a 
member of Beulah Baptist Church. 
Judge Little was born and educated in 
Georgia. He received his undergraduate de-
gree from Morehouse College and his law de-
gree from Emory University. After completing 
law school, he took a position at a legal clinic 
where he could have a larger community im-
pact over a federal position he was offered in 
Washington, D.C. 
At a time when windows and doors were 
just beginning to open for African Americans 
in the legal profession, Judge Little was ap-
pointed to the bench in Hillsborough County in 
1977 by Governor Rubin Askew, where he 
presided for more than 12 years. He was the 
second African American in the county’s his-
tory to be appointed, standing on the shoul-
ders of Judge George Edgecomb, who only 
served three years as a county judge due to 
illness, but set the highest of standards for his 
colleagues to follow. The 1970s were a trans-
formative time for communities as desegrega-
tion orders blanketed the nation while raising 
the profile of diversity at all levels of govern-
ment. With the vital role our courts play in our 
democracy, economy and daily lives, a more 
diverse judiciary brings greater confidence in 
our justice system and is an important step to-
ward a more just and equal America. In 1993, 
Governor Lawton Chiles appointed Judge Lit-
tle to the Circuit Court where he served in the 
Juvenile and Circuit Civil Divisions until his re-
tirement in 2007. 
Much of Judge Little’s Circuit experience 
was dedicated to positively impacting the lives 
of juveniles and young adults through his legal 
decisions, who he continues to serve as an in-
spiration. Judge Little retired to care for his 
aging father in Georgia but continues to lend 
his judicial expertise as a Senior Judge for the 
Thirteenth Judicial Circuit, and assists other 
judges to ensure each case is given the time 
and care it deserves. He has been recognized 
for his extensive commitment to service 
through various awards, including the 2018 
Distinguished Leadership Award from the 
Black Law Students Association at WMU- 
Cooley Law School’s Tampa Bay campus. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the Tampa 
Bay community, it gives me immense pride to 
honor a great public servant this Black History 
Month. Judge Little is a man faithful to his 
family and community, and is unparalleled in 
service to his neighbors.

Wednesday, March 4, 2020 
Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in recognition Chief Ed Kulhawik as he retires 
after 39 years of service as a law enforcement 
officer. 
Ed began his career with the Wilton, Con-
necticut Police Department in 1981 as a patrol 
officer until he chose to take a leave of ab-
sence to pursue a master’s degree in Social 
Work from Boston College. After returning to 
the Wilton Police Department he went on to 
be promoted to the rank of Sergeant, Lieuten-
ant, Administrative Captain, and in 2004, Chief 
of Police. After serving the Wilton community 
for 27 years, he accepted a position with the 
Eastham, Massachusetts Police Department 
on August 31, 2009. In doing so, Chief 
Kulhawik fulfilled a long-time dream of working 
on Cape Cod. 
During his tenure as Chief in Eastham, he 
developed new recruitment strategies that fo-
cused on education. Chief Kulhawik improved 
training techniques and built significant rela-
tionships with both residents and local legisla-
tors. In both departments, he repeatedly ex-
emplified the highest ideals of his profession 
and worked to greatly improve both commu-
nities. 
Additionally, Chief Kulhawik led many of 
Massachusetts’ most prodigious non-depart-
mental policing bodies, such as the FBI Na-
tional Academy Associates for Connecticut 
and the Cape Cod Regional Law Enforcement 
Council. 
Chief Ed Kulhawik has dedicated his career 
to serving Eastham, and I wish him many 
years of well-deserved happiness and more 
with his family in retirement. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to honor Ed-
ward V. Kulhawik, Chief of the Eastham Police 
Department, and I ask that my colleagues join

CELEBRATING WOMEN’S HISTORY 
MONTH 
HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 4, 2020 
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great respect and admiration that I rise today 
in observance of Women’s History Month and 
its 2020 theme—Valiant Women of the Vote. 
Each year, the National Women’s History 
Project selects a unifying theme to recognize 
and promote Women’s History Month. This 
year’s theme recognizes the centennial of the 
19th Amendment and honors the stories of 
women from the original suffrage movement. 
In the United States, women of every race, 
class, and ethnic background have played a 
critical role with ensuring that women’s voices 
are heard. For generations, women have con-
tributed to resolving conflicts and have worked 
to promote equality in the workplace, schools, 
homes, 
communities, 
and 
government. 
Women have insisted upon and continue to 
fight for respect, justice, and equality for all of 
humanity. 
Throughout the years, women from diverse 
backgrounds have contributed to the coura-
geous movement that would secure a wom-
an’s right to vote. Among these remarkable 
leaders being recognized this month are pas-
sionate activists, including Congresswoman 
ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON, Theresa Kumar, 
founder of Voto Latino, Terry Ao Minnis, Direc-
tor of Asian Americans Advancing Justice, and 
Edith Mayo, curator at the Smithsonian Mu-
seum and historian of women’s suffrage. Also 
honored are Lucy Burns, a Silent Sentinel who 
protested at the White House, and Carrie 
Chapman Catt, a suffrage activist from Iowa 
who served as president of the National Amer-
ican Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). 
Wilhelmina 
Kekelaokalaninui 
Widemann 
Dowsett, a NAWSA member and founder of a 
suffrage organization in Hawaii, Ana Roque de 
Duprey, a Puerto Rican suffrage organizer, 
and Elizabeth Piper Ensley, a reporter for the 
‘‘Women’s Era’’ and member of the National 
Association of Colored Women, are also re-
membered for their contributions to the move-
ment. 
We also recall the passionate efforts of 
Marie Foster, a civil rights leader who 
marched from Selma to Montgomery and at-
tempted to register to vote eight times before 
being allowed to vote, Dr. Mabel Ping-Hua 
Lee, a New York suffragist who earned a PhD 
in economics, and Virginia Louisa Minor, the 
Missouri woman who appealed to the Su-
preme Court in 1874 for her right to vote. Fi-
nally, we salute Anna Howard Shaw, who 
earned a Distinguished Service Medal during 
World War I and played a critical role in the 
leadership of NAWSA. For their leadership 
and outstanding dedication to women’s rights, 
unity, and peace, these courageous women 
are well deserving of our respect and admira-
tion. I commend them and the many others 
who fought alongside them for women of 
every creed, class, and ethnic background. 
These fearless and strong women serve as re-
markable role models who reflect the 2020 
theme, Valiant Women of the Vote. 
Madam Speaker, I am honored to join in 
celebrating Women’s History Month and rec-
ognizing the dedication, perseverance, con-
tributions, and advances great American 
women from all cultures and classes have 
made to bettering our communities and the 
entire country. I ask that you and my other 
distinguished colleagues join me in celebrating 
these extraordinary women who have im-
proved American society and whose stories 
are woven into the fabric of our nation.

came on board to help high school captains 
Fionna Drake and Clara Ponder complete the 
season. The team practiced whenever they 
could, outside of their mandatory three les-
sons per week. Parents across the community 
opened their garages and other spare spaces 
to the girls for practice. The teamwork and 
dedication displayed by the moms, team cap-
tains and the dancers is remarkable and led 
them to victory at the IDTA State Finals. As a 
former athlete, I admire the fortitude the Knox-
ville High School Dance Team displayed to 
achieve their dreams of being state champions 
and I commend them for their efforts and can- 
do attitudes. I am proud to see them represent 
Knoxville so well throughout the state with 
their talent and passion. 
It is because of student leaders such as the 
Knoxville High School Dance Team that I am 
especially proud to serve Illinois’ 17th Con-
gressional District. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to again formally congratulate the Knox-
ville High School Dance Team on its victory at 
the IDTA State Finals in the Class A Kick 
Dance category.

RECOGNIZING 
OUR 
LADY 
OF 
LOURDES ACADEMY GIRLS’ SOC-
CER TEAM 
HON. DONNA E. SHALALA 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 4, 2020 
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
recognition of Our Lady of Lourdes Academy, 
which celebrated its second soccer state 
championship win this last week. 
With this victory, Lourdes Academy reaf-
firms its reputation for excellence in every 
field. Lourdes is well known as an academic 
powerhouse, and this victory is proof of the 
school’s incredible athletics program. 
The championship game was a test of the 
Lourdes soccer team’s resilience. Although 
Lourdes scored an early lead in the first quar-
ter, the game once again became tied just 
2:06 before halftime. Despite the close game, 
the Bobcat defense was stellar, and the they 
retook lead in the second half. 
With 500 fans cheering from the stands in 
Spec Martin Stadium, incredible teamwork, 
and endless determination, Lourdes captured 
the Class 6A state championship with a 2–1 
victory against Venice, marking the Bobcats’ 
second state title in the past three years. 
Congratulations to the Lourdes’ girls’ soccer 
team on a well-earned victory. It’s an honor to 
represent this team in Congress, and I hope to 
see many of these young women take their 
talents on to collegiate and professional soc-
cer. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF ALLEN 
CONNELLY 
HON. JIM BANKS 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 4, 2020 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the service of The American Legion, 
Department of Indiana State Commander Mr. 
Allen Connelly. 
As a 50-year member of LaGrange Amer-
ican Legion Post 215, Connelly’s engagement 
with the Legion over the last half-century is 
historic. That includes serving as Post Service 
Officer, Hoosier Boys State and Flag Edu-
cation Chairman, member of the District Fi-
nance Committee and District Advisory Com-
mittee, member of the Department Strategic 
Plan Committee and Centennial Celebration 
Committee, member of the National Veteran’s 
Preference Committee and Education, Other 
Benefits and Homelessness Committee, and 
more. 
Connelly has been heavily involved in his 
community outside the Legion as well. He 
served 25 years on the LaGrange Volunteer 
Fire Department; he was president and mem-
ber of the Lakeland School Corporation Board 
of Trustees; he served 12 years as a member 
of the Bloomfield Township Advisory Board, 
and he has served as the Veteran Represent-
ative on the LaGrange County Drug Court 
since its founding. He is a member of St. Jo-
seph Catholic Church in LaGrange. 
Connelly has also served our nation with 
distinction. He was active duty in the U.S. 
Army between 1964 and 1965, where he 
earned the rank of Sergeant. This record is 
testament to his civic engagement, attentive-
ness and hard work for which northeast Indi-
ana is forever grateful.

ROSS ANDERSON—BLACK HISTORY 
MONTH 
HON. KATHY CASTOR 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 4, 2020 
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor a true ‘‘Man of Vision,’’ Mr. 
Ross Anderson. He was born and raised in 
Tampa, Florida and has left an indelible mark 
in our hometown. Mr. Anderson graduated 
from Hillsborough High School and the Univer-
sity of South Florida. He received his graduate 
degrees from Columbia Southern University 
and Waldorf College, respectively. While Mr. 
Anderson takes great pride in his distin-
guished education and vocation, he is most 
proud to be the father of James Elaissaint-An-
derson and Henry Tillman Jr., and the grand-
father of Jasmine Tillman. 
Mr. Anderson saw a profound need in our 
community for mentorship directed towards 
young men whom he often refers as ‘‘our 
boys.’’ His vision for mentorship led him to 
leave his career as a successful corporate ex-
ecutive. In 2006, one year into his tenure as 
a teacher, Mr. Anderson helped found Men of 
Vision at Sligh Middle School. In 2010, Men of 
Vision, Inc. was established with the concept 
of ‘‘Action & Vision can change the World.’’ 
The effort starts at the commnunity level but 
knows no limits in its outreach. In Mr. Ander-
son’s world, ‘‘our boys’’ enhance their per-
sonal development, and by doing so, address 
the physical and social needs of their commu-
nities. It also follows that they then promote 
better relations among all people through a 
framework of friendship and service, and pro-
vide an overall vision for the future. 
Men of Vision is open to young boys and 
men from ages 10 to 19, fifth grade through 
post-secondary school. The group is orga-
nized into elementary, middle and high 
schools throughout the community. Member-
ship is open to young men regardless of race, 
color, ability, creed, gender, national origin or 
religion, reflecting the diversity of Tampa Bay, 
the community it serves. The impact has been 
tremendous. 
Mr. Anderson serves as a guide, mentor 
and advocate for ‘‘our boys,’’ some who may 
be on the brink of hopelessness. By boosting 
these individuals and turning them instead into 
confident contributors and leaders, Mr. Ander-
son lifts our community one Man of Vision at 
a time. He has dedicated his life to ensuring 
that Tampa’s future generations believe they 
can make a difference in the community in 
which they live by focusing on serving others 
and respecting themselves as vital members 
of our community. Nearly 100 percent of Men 
of Vision complete high school and many con-
tinue higher education. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the citizens of 
Florida and my neighbors across Tampa Bay 
I am proud to honor Ross Anderson this Black 
History Month. Mr. Anderson’s untiring efforts 
and selfless devotion are a shining beacon to 
all of us, especially the young people in our 
community. The time and energy he has in-
vested into developing our youth and making 
Tampa Bay a better place to live are un-
matched. His legacy will live on in history 
through the hundreds of young men and the 
community at large that he has inspired and 
impacted.

E261 
March 4, 2020 
Born on July 2, 1951 in Los Angeles, Cali-
fornia, Phil attended Venice High School and 
the University of California, Los Angeles. After 
graduating, Phil taught for 14 years in Culver 
City as an elementary school teacher and 
served as president of his teachers’ union for 
six years. 
Phil then decided on a bold mid-career 
pivot, attending law school at night and even-
tually becoming a lawyer. He also served as 
a Los Angeles County deputy District Attorney, 
where he had numerous successes in the 
courtroom. However, Phil told friends that he 
missed working in public education and re-
turned as an administrator, beginning his ten-
ure as the principal of Webster Elementary 
School in 1990. 
As principal, Phil introduced innovative 
projects and ideas to the benefit of Webster’s 
students, including Websterville, an annual re- 
creation of a colonial American village. Phil 
also led annual trips to Yosemite National 
Park and was key in establishing the school’s 
computer lab. Phil was known among Web-
ster’s teaching staff for encouraging individ-
uality and creativity in the classroom and con-
tributing to a warm and friendly environment 
for the students. 
Phil is survived by his wife, Charlee; chil-
dren Rachel and Daniel; and grandchildren, 
Heaven and Paris. May his compassion, lead-
ership, and devotion to those around him live 
on in the students he inspired and educators 
he helped nurture over his 37-year career.

HONORING TUSKEGEE AIRMEN 
DAY 
HON. TERRI A. SEWELL 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 4, 2020 
Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the Alabama State Legis-
lature’s joint resolution which recognizes 
March 7 as Tuskegee Airmen Day. House 
Joint Resolution 120 will acknowledge the 
honor and valor of those Tuskegee Airmen 
who risked their lives in defense of our coun-
try, despite racism, prejudice and segregation. 
In 1941, a group of African American men 
in Tuskegee, Alabama, joined together to form 
an all-African American squadron of pilots 
known as the Tuskegee Airmen. This squad-
ron fought fiercely overseas on behalf of the 
United States of America during World War II, 
proving that patriotism and love of country 
conquers even the cruelest forms of bigotry. 
Segregation barred African Americans from 
enlisting alongside white Americans, and prior 
to the Tuskegee Airmen, the United States 
had never had an African American military 
pilot. 
After being rejected from enlisting during 
World War I, African Americans spent more 
than two decades advocating for the right to 
enlist and train as military aviators. With help 
from the National Association for the Advance-
ment of Colored People, labor union leader A. 
Philip Randolph and Judge William H. Hastie, 
these advocates were successful in passing 
Appropriations Bill Public Law 18 with an 
amendment by Senator Harry H. Schwartz of 
Wyoming, which designated funds for training 
African American pilots. The money was then 
invested in civilian flight schools willing to train 
African American pilots. 
In June of 1941, the 99th Pursuit Squadron 
at Tuskegee University was founded. The unit 
consisted of 47 officers and 429 enlisted men 
who began primary training at Moton Field be-
fore moving to the Tuskegee Air Field about 
ten miles to the west for conversion training. 
Tuskegee Air Field mirrored existing all-white 
air fields like Maxwell Air Field only forty miles 
away, providing African American pilots with 
the same rigorous training as white Ameri-
cans. 
Major Noel F. Parrish advocated for the 
Tuskegee Airmen to be allowed to enter into 
combat, petitioning Washington, D.C. on their 
behalf. Eventually, in 1943, the Tuskegee Air-
men were deemed eligible for combat and 
were sent to North Africa to join the 33rd 
Fighter Group under the command of Colonel 
William W. Momyer. Given little guidance from 
experienced combat pilots, the Tuskegee Air-
men flew toward Italy where they attacked the 
small and strategically located volcanic island 
of Pantelleria. The island eventually surren-
dered, and the Airmen flew on to Sicily, re-
ceiving a Distinguished Unit Citation. The men 
went on to fight with heart and valor through-
out World War II, proving to America and to 
the entire world that African Americans were 
just as capable as white Americans of serving 
their country. In many ways, these men dis-
played even more patriotism, as they actively 
fought to overcome barriers in order to serve 
and protect. 
The Tuskegee Airmen’s legacy is one that 
should make the state of Alabama truly proud. 
These men are part of Alabama’s remarkable 
legacy of advocating for civil rights, proving 
that the determination of African American 
Alabamians can charge the course of history, 
not only for our country but for the entire 
world. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of Alabama’s 
7th Congressional District, I ask you and my 
colleagues to join me in paying tribute to the 
exemplary service of the Tuskegee Airmen, 
and to the Alabama State Legislature for ac-
knowledging their service through the passage 
of House Joint Resolution 120. May we cele-
brate the resilience and sacrifice of the 
Tuskegee Airmen not only on March 7, but 
every day.

Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, I rise

On June 27, 1992, Reverend Fox was or-

FEBRUARY VETERAN OF THE 
MONTH 
HON. KEVIN HERN 
OF OKLAHOMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 4, 2020 
Mr. KEVIN HERN of Oklahoma. Madam 
Speaker, I rise to honor the First District of 
Oklahoma’s February Veteran of the Month, 
Megan Lowry. 
A Military Police Officer in the United States 
Marine Corps, Ms. Lowry honorably served 
our nation for three years. Following her mili-
tary career, Megan served in the Secret Serv-
ice during President George W. Bush’s last 
term in office helping to protect the First Fam-
ily from various threats. Due to her out-
standing work with the Secret Service, Ms. 
Lowry was awarded the Presidential Service 
Badge for honorable service to the President 
of the United States and the White House. 
Upon returning home from service, Megan 
Lowry has dedicated her life to serving other 
veterans. 
Megan serves her fellow veterans who may 
be suffering from the invisible wounds that re-
main from their time in combat. Lowry is a 
service dog trainer for Wounded Veterans of 
Oklahoma 
and 
also 
works 
with 
the 
Pups4Patriots program which works to provide 
service animals to veterans free of charge. 
Ms. Lowry is a recent alumna of the Univer-
sity of Tulsa where she was an active member 
of their Student Veterans Association, which 
seeks 
to 
help 
transition 
returning 
servicemembers into collegiate life. Megan is 
also an active member of the Delaware Tribe, 
helping to preserve her native heritage for fu-
ture generations. 
Megan Lowry lives a life of unmatched dedi-
cation, sacrifice, and service to our great na-
tion. She answered the call to defend free-
dom, and she sacrificed whatever was nec-
essary in the name of that noble cause. She 
continues to serve our country, community, 
and her fellow veterans at a high level on a 
daily basis. It is my honor to recognize Megan 
Lowry as the 1st Congressional District of 
Oklahoma’s February Veteran of the Month.

RECOGNIZING JASON SAMSAL OF 
SUNBURST 
HON. GREG GIANFORTE 
OF MONTANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 4, 2020 
Mr. GIANFORTE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Jason Samsal of Sunburst for 
his innovation as a conservationist on his 
Montana family farm. 
Jason’s land, just north of Shelby, has been 
in his family for generations. When Jason was 
11 years old, his grandpa began teaching him 
the ways of the farmer and rancher. Jason 
has worked alongside his father for more than 
three decades. For him, it’s the independence 
and lifestyle that he loves so much. 
Jason has been an example for many Mon-
tana farmers and ranchers. Participating in 
United 
States 
Department 
of 
Agriculture 
(USDA) conservation programs, he goes 
above and beyond to ensure high-quality care 
for his crops and land. Jason is committed to 
using a diverse and intense cropping rotation 
that enhances the soil and protects it from 
erosion. 
His methods are working. Jason is known 
for his produce, including one-year turnips that 
have reached the size of dinner plates. As a 
result of his work, he was recognized as the 
Toole County Conservationist of the Year in 
2019. 
Along with crop rotation, Jason makes con-
structing habitat a top priority on his farm. 
After noticing bees were struggling to pollinate 
his large farm in 2010, he found a solution. 
For every quarter mile, Jason created habitat 
with plants and flowers that pollinate year- 
round, giving the bees an area to rest. Be-
cause of measures like these, his bees and 
crops are thriving. 
Jason is also committed to responsible wild-
life practices. His farm is open for hunters as 
part of the state’s block management program. 
He’s constructed three wildlife corridors for 
animals to roam freely. He’s also rebuilt all his 
fences with gates so antelope and deer can 
travel safely throughout his property. Madam 
Speaker, for his innovative approach to sus-
tainable farming and his commitment to con-
serving Montana’s land and creating healthy, 
practical wildlife habitat, I recognize Jason 
Samsal for his Spirit of Montana.
