PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Good Shepherd, may we hear You 
speak this day. In the voices of those 
around us—friends, colleagues, coun-
selors, may we hear Your words of love, 
support, and challenge. Speak through 
them in ways we can understand. 
Raise Your voice above the noise of 
cynicism and distrust, that we would 
instead be inclined to hope and mutual 
support. Make Your appeal to grace 
and mercy louder and more compelling 
that we would ignore the distractions 
of power and greed. 
We pray the wisdom to know Your 
voice when the cacophony of life at-
tempts to disguise and silence Your 
guidance. But hearing the familiarity 
of Your voice, may we strive to follow 
it wherever You lead us. 
For You, O Lord, care for us deeply. 
You will not let the righteous out of 
Your sight. Your hedge of protection 
surrounds us. No one will snatch us out 
of Your hand. 
We, the sheep of Your fold, are held 
closely in Your endless care. We are 
bound by Your boundless love. We are 
embraced in Your everlasting arms. 
In this may we find our strength this 
day. In Your merciful name we pray. 
Amen.

Let us pray. 
Eternal God, when we look to the

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
U.S. SUPREME COURT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this is 
a dark and disturbing morning for 
America. Last night, a report disclosed 
that a conservative majority of the 
United States Supreme Court is ready 
to overturn Roe v. Wade and uproot 
decades of precedent affirming a wom-
an’s right to an abortion. If this report 
is accurate, the Supreme Court is 
poised to inflict the greatest restric-
tion of rights in the past 50 years—not 
just on women, but on all Americans. 
Under this decision, our children will 
have less rights than their parents. The 
Republican-appointed 
Justices’ 
re-
ported votes to overturn Roe v. Wade 
will go down as an abomination—one of 
the worst, most damaging decisions in 
modern history. 
Several of these conservative Jus-
tices, who are in no way accountable to 
the American people, have lied to the 
U.S. Senate, ripped up the Constitu-
tion, and defiled both precedence and 
the Supreme Court’s reputation, all at 
the expense of tens of millions of 
women who could soon be stripped of 
their bodily autonomy and the con-
stitutional rights they have relied on 
for over half a century. 
The party of Lincoln and Eisenhower 
has now completely devolved into the 
Party of Trump. 
Every Republican Senator who sup-
ported Senator MCCONNELL and voted 
for Trump Justices, pretending that 
this day would never come, will now 
have to explain themselves to the 
American people. 
I will have more to say later this 
morning, but I want to make three 
things clear. 
First, now that the Court is poised to 
strike down Roe, it is my intention for 
the Senate to hold a vote on legislation 
to codify the right to an abortion in 
law. 
Second, a vote on this legislation is 
not an abstract exercise. This is as ur-
gent and real as it gets. We will vote to 
protect a woman’s right to choose, and 
every American is going to see which 
side every Senator stands. Every Amer-
ican is going to see on which side every 
Senator stands. 
Third, to the American people, I say 
this: The elections this November will 
have consequences because the rights 
of 100 million women are now on the 
ballot. 
To help fight this Court’s awful deci-
sion, I urge every American to make 
their voices heard this week and this 
year. 
I urge Americans to call their Mem-
bers, to write their Members, to email 
their Members, to text their Members, 
and most of all, to cast their ballots. 
Make no mistake, the blame for this 
decision falls squarely on Republican 
Senators and the Senate Republicans

as a whole, who spent years pushing ex-
tremist judges and spent years con-
firming far-right Justices to the Su-
preme Court but who claimed, some-
how, this day would never come. 
But this day has come, and we will 
fight it all the way. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Republican leader is recognized. 
U.S. SUPREME COURT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, for 
years, the radical left has attacked the 
institution of the Supreme Court. Last 
night, it appears their campaign hit a 
new low. 
Historically, the Justices, clerks, and 
staff have prized and protected the 
Court’s confidentiality. The Justices 
must be able to discuss and deliberate 
in an environment of total trust and 
privacy. Americans cannot receive a 
fair trial if politicians, pundits, bullies, 
and mobs get a say in court. Judicial 
independence is vital, but the far left 
has spent years shamelessly attacking 
it. Democrats in Congress have en-
dorsed plans for partisan Court pack-
ing. They have sent the Justices 
threatening legal briefs. They have 
scheduled sham hearings to smear 
judges. 
In 2020, the Senate Democratic leader 
marched across the street to the Court 
and shouted threats—threats—at mul-
tiple Justices by name if they didn’t 
rule how he wanted. 
In 2018, activists literally chased Sen-
ators around the Capitol. 
Now, last night, a shocking—shock-
ing—new 
breach: 
Somebody—likely 
somebody inside the Court itself— 
leaked a confidential internal draft to 
the press, almost certainly in an effort 
to stir up an inappropriate pressure 
campaign to sway an outcome. 
The radical left immediately rallied 
around the toxic stunt. The cheer-
leaders for partisan Court packing ap-
plauded what they suggested was the 
work of ‘‘a brave clerk’’ making ‘‘a 
last-ditch Hail Mary attempt’’ to cause 
a political firestorm and ‘‘cause the 
Court to reconsider.’’ 
Liberals want to rip the blindfold off 
Lady Justice. They want to override 
impartiality with intimidation. They 
want to elevate mob rule over the rule 
of law. The same political movement 
that used a leak to move up the 
timeline of Justice Breyer’s retirement 
process is trying to use yet another 
leak to make the Court less secure and 
less impartial. 
Never before—never before—in mod-
ern history has an internal draft been 
leaked to the public while the Justices 
were still deciding the case. Never be-
fore. 
Whoever committed this lawless act 
knew exactly what it could bring 
about. The Justices already require se-
curity. Less than 2 weeks ago, an un-
balanced person lit himself on fire on 
the Court steps. Less than 3 years ago, 
a liberal mob tried to storm the Court, 
shoving past law enforcement and 
pounding on the doors. 
Look, everybody knows what kind of 
climate the far left is trying to fuel: 
one that is antithetical—antithetical— 
to the rule of law. Right on cue, top 
Democrats began publishing wild state-
ments about what the Court might de-
cide, packed with using unhinged rhet-
oric that could easily incite, light a 
match. 
So what else happened? Activists 
flocked to the Court. An angry crowd 
surrounded the Court, chanting Jus-
tices’ names—their renewed call to 
smash the institutions of both the Sen-
ate and the Court at the same time. 
One of the Court’s most essential and 
sacred features was smashed just to 
buy the outraged industrial complex a 
few extra days to scream nonsense 
about what the Court might rule. 
This lawless action should be inves-
tigated and punished to the fullest ex-
tent possible—fullest extent possible. I 
am certain the Chief Justice will seek 
to get to the bottom of this. If a crime 
was committed, the Department of 
Justice must pursue it completely. 
So, listen, I want all nine Justices to 
know there are still principled Sen-
ators who have their backs no matter 
what. There are still some people in 
this Capitol—and a majority in the 
Senate—whose support for the rule of 
law is not conditional, not conditional. 
The Court should tune out the bad- 
faith noise and feel completely free to 
do their jobs. They should follow the 
facts and the law wherever that leads. 
As I have warned in the past, courts 
bowing to activist pressure would 
never enhance judicial legitimacy. It 
could only erode it. And the hostage 
takers would never settle for half a 
loaf. 
ENERGY 
Now, Mr. President, on another mat-
ter, an unfortunate routine keeps play-
ing itself out with the Biden adminis-
tration. First, they implement bad 
policies that create problems. Then 
they propose solutions that are really 
just more bad ideas. 
A case in point is inflation. Demo-
crats spent last spring unleashing a 
deluge of reckless spending on our re-
covering economy. They spent the rest 
of the year trying to pull off yet an-
other taxing-and-spending spree. Now 
they want to pass a massive tax hike 
while families are already hurting. 
Unfortunately, for the American peo-
ple, the same thing is playing itself out 
in the world of energy policy. Since 
day one, the Biden administration has 
done its best to wage holy war on 
American domestic energy production. 
The predictable result, thanks to these 
policies and the broader inflation that 
Democrats have fueled, is that Amer-
ican families are hurting badly. Across 
the board, energy costs have risen 
nearly 32 percent in a year. 
But now comes the third part of the 
unfortunate routine: a slew of bad, far- 
left policy choices and proposals that 
would make the pain for the American 
people 
actually 
even 
worse. 
Some 
Democrats are pushing for a massive 
new tax on companies involved in de-
veloping and exporting American en-
ergy. The last time this wrongheaded 
idea was given legs, President Carter 
ended up reducing domestic produc-
tion, increasing our foreign depend-
ence, and raising Americans’ prices at 
the pump. 
And over the last few weeks, the 
Biden administration took two more 
steps in the wrong direction. After ig-
noring Federal law by failing to award 
a single oil or gas development lease 
for five straight quarters, the adminis-
tration has shrunk its land offering by 
80 percent while jacking up its royalty 
rate by 50 percent. That is right. Demo-
crats’ response to supply shortages and 
sky-high prices at the pump is to make 
American energy even less available 
and even more expensive. Meanwhile, 
it has begun to tear up the regulatory 
reforms put in place under the last ad-
ministration to streamline infrastruc-
ture project permitting. 
President Biden and his team struck 
the match on a historic surge in energy 
prices and are now making it even 
more—more—expensive for American 
producers to boost supply. They en-
dorsed a bipartisan infrastructure bill 
and are now making it harder for 
American builders to get to work. 
And, of course, Democrats are still 
itching to resurrect their Green New 
Deal. In the midst of historic inflation, 
they want to jack costs up even further 
for consumers while making America 
wildly dependent on China and other 
regimes with abysmal environmental 
and labor standards. 
The same Democrats who don’t want 
us responsibly exploring for oil and 
natural gas also don’t want us respon-
sibly exploring for critical minerals ei-
ther and want to tie up American man-
ufacturing in redtape. So the adminis-
tration’s war on American energy has 
left destruction in its wake. The only 
idea they have left to try is the one 
that would have worked from the be-
ginning: Unleash—unleash—the abun-
dant, affordable, and reliable supply we 
have got right here at home. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2255 
May 3, 2022 
Senator MCCONNELL, with respect to 
the alleged breach of the Supreme 
Court and reiterate that this is a law-
less action. If it turns out to be what 
we believe to be true, it should be in-
vestigated, punished as fully as pos-
sible. The Chief Justice has to get to 
the bottom of this. And, if applicable, 
the Department of Justice needs to 
pursue any criminal charges. 
Let me just say, too, that I believe, 
as Senator MCCONNELL
pointed out, 
that all nine Justices on the Supreme 
Court should tune out the bad-faith 
noise and feel totally free to do their 
jobs following the facts and the law 
where they lead. We need an inde-
pendent Supreme Court, and we should, 
at every turn, be defending the inde-
pendence of our Supreme Court. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. President, the Biden border crisis 
is still getting worse. In March, U.S. 
Customs and Border Protection en-
countered 221,303 individuals attempt-
ing to cross our southern border ille-
gally—221,303. That is an average of 
more than 7,100 individuals per day. As 
of April, that number had gotten even 
worse. An April 26 memo from the Sec-
retary of Homeland Security reported: 
In the past 3 weeks, CBP [our Customs and 
Border Patrol] has encountered an average of 
over 7,800 migrants per day across the south-
west border. This is compared to a historical 
average of 1,600 per day in the pre-pandemic 
years [2014 to 2019]. 
Let me just repeat that: 
In the past 3 weeks, CBP has encountered 
an average of over 7,800 migrants per day 
across the southwest border. [This is] com-
pared to a historical average of 1,600 per day 
in the pre-pandemic years. 
The situation on our southern border 
is out of control. It is on track to get 
much, much worse. On April 1, the 
Biden administration announced the 
title 42 COVID–19 restrictions, which 
provided for the immediate deportation 
of individuals who crossed the border 
illegally, will end on May 23. It is iron-
ic that even as the President has effec-
tively declared that the COVID emer-
gency to be over at our southern bor-
der, his administration continues to 
advocate to press Congress for more 
COVID funding. 
Once title 42 restrictions are offi-
cially lifted, the flood of illegal immi-
gration across our southern border is 
expected to become a tsunami. The De-
partment of Homeland Security ex-
pects as many as 18,000 migrants per 
day to attempt to cross our southern 
border after the policy is lifted—18,000 
per day. That is more than double the 
number we are currently experiencing, 
which is already straining Border Pa-
trol to the limit. 
Secretary Mayorkas testified last 
week that morale in the Border Patrol 
is low. Not surprising. What will it be 
like for these men and women when 
their workload more than doubles? 
Title 42 restrictions were never in-
tended to be a permanent border solu-
tion and lifting them would not be a 
problem if it were clear that the Presi-
dent is ready to deal with the resulting 
immigration surge, but the President 
hasn’t even been able to—or hasn’t 
bothered to—come up with a plan to 
address our existing immigration cri-
sis. And the plan he has offered to deal 
with the unexpected surge when title 42 
restrictions are lifted is inadequate, to 
put it mildly. 
To give us one example, the adminis-
tration plans to increase Customs and 
Border Protection detention capacity 
to 18,000. The problem with that is, as 
I said, we could be facing an influx of 
18,000 illegal immigrants per day—per 
day—when title 42 has ended. Given 
that individuals usually stay in Cus-
toms and Border Protection custody 
for 2 or 3 days, it is clear that a deten-
tion capacity of 18,000 is likely to be 
woefully insufficient. 
Even some Democrats have criticized 
the administration’s plan with one not-
ing that: ‘‘The administration’s plan 
for the end of title 42 is unrealistic by 
May 23.’’ 
Another Democrat said: 
There hasn’t been enough preparation . . . 
we don’t have the basics of how you’re going 
to handle 18,000 individuals a day safely and 
in accordance with our ethics and principles. 
This plan, I have not seen it yet. 
A number of Senate Democrats have 
criticized the President’s decision to 
end title 42 right now. While I appre-
ciate their speaking up, I wish that 
they had decided to join Republicans in 
supporting an amendment to preserve 
title 42 border policies when we voted 
on it last August, or the amendment 
Republicans supported in February of 
last year to boost funding for security 
at our Nation’s borders. Then, perhaps, 
we wouldn’t currently be in a situation 
where we expect to see half a million 
individuals a month attempting to ille-
gally cross our southern border. 
Out-of-control 
illegal 
immigration 
represents a serious security threat. 
Criminals, 
including 
human 
traf-
fickers, drug smugglers, and gang 
members, regularly attempt to cross 
our southern border. And the worse the 
situation at our border gets, the easier 
it is for these individuals to make their 
way into our country. Our Border Pa-
trol officers do heroic work, but they 
are stretched incredibly thin and have 
been for more than a year now. It is 
simply common sense to acknowledge 
that the greater the flood of illegal im-
migration they have to contend with, 
the easier it is going to be for bad ac-
tors to get across the border. 
Just last week, Secretary Mayorkas 
testified there were more than 389,000 
got-aways, which were individuals the 
Border Patrol saw but was unable to 
apprehend at our southern border dur-
ing fiscal year 2021—389,000 got away. 
How many more are there likely to be 
if the influx at our southern border 
more than doubles? 
Securing our border—by that, I mean 
having actual operational control of 
who enters our country—is a national 
security imperative. It is unfortunate 
that President Biden doesn’t seem to 
realize that. He began his administra-
tion by rescinding the declaration of a 
national emergency at our southern 
border, halting construction of the bor-
der wall, and revoking a Trump admin-
istration order that called for the gov-
ernment to faithfully execute our im-
migration laws. In other words, Presi-
dent Biden immediately gave the green 
light to those who would exploit our 
broken immigration system. He has 
continued to implement measures that 
have served to convey the message that 
the U.S. borders are effectively open. 
While his title 42 decision has finally 
forced him to offer a so-called plan to 
deal with border security, the measures 
he proposes to take are unlikely to 
deter the expected surge of illegal im-
migration once title 42 is lifted. As a 
result, by the end of this month, our 
Nation may be facing a security en-
forcement and humanitarian crisis at 
our southern border that makes our 
current crisis look like child’s play. 
The administration must do more to 
develop its response plan before the 
President lifts title 42 restrictions on 
the 23rd of May. The truth of the mat-
ter is, it is almost unquestionably too 
late for the administration to be ade-
quately prepared for the coming crisis 
by the end of this month. I hope the 
President will recognize that and delay 
the May 23 date until he has an ade-
quate plan for dealing with our current 
border crisis, as well as any additional 
influx from lifting title 42 border re-
strictions. 
If he does not move the May 23 dead-
line, then Congress should step in and 
do it for him and stop our Nation’s cur-
rent border crisis from becoming a true 
catastrophe. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
SEMICONDUCTORS 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, over re-
cent decades, globalization—and by 
that, I mean depending on the cheapest 
producer of a particular good and dis-
regarding the vulnerability of supply 
chains—has characterized our global 
commerce. By and large, that has been 
a good thing, particularly for con-
sumers, if you are talking about toys 
for your children or an appliance, let’s 
say. Everything from ag products to in-
novative technologies can find a place 
in global markets. And that can benefit 
consumers. 
But this interdependence creates se-
rious risks, as well. Over the last cou-
ple of years, we have seen how supply 
chain vulnerabilities can bring an en-
tire industry—or perhaps even an en-
tire country—to its knees. 
Some of the clearest examples have 
surfaced during the pandemic. The U.S. 
leans heavily on Chinese manufac-
turing for masks, gloves, gowns, and 
ventilators, otherwise known as PPE— 
not the ventilators, but the masks and 
gloves. For a long time, that didn’t 
seem to be a problem. Then COVID–19 
showed up on our front doorstep. China 
held most of the supply for its own

May 3, 2022 
healthcare workers, leaving the rest of 
the world to scramble and compete for 
what little product was available here 
at home. Suddenly, we were unable to 
protect our healthcare workers with 
PPE and the equipment they needed in 
order to deal with people sick with the 
virus. 
As the American people now know all 
too well, the pandemic taught us sup-
ply chain lessons that extend far be-
yond personal protective equipment 
and medical equipment. One of the big-
gest vulnerabilities that came to light 
was the semiconductor supply chain. 
Now, chips or semiconductors or 
microcircuits are critical components 
in the most used products here in 
America, 
whether 
it 
is 
your 
smartphone, computer, your TV, your 
car, airplanes that you may fly in, cell 
towers—just about anything with an 
‘‘off’’ and ‘‘on’’ switch. That is what 
semiconductors power. It also includes 
critical defense articles, everything 
from fighter jets, like the F–35 Joint 
Strike Fighter, our fifth-generation 
jet, to the Javelin missiles now being 
used to take out Russian tanks in 
Ukraine. 
As much as we depend on a strong 
supply of these microcircuits or chips 
currently, we also depend on other 
countries to make them. Ninety per-
cent of the most advanced semiconduc-
tors in the world are made in Asia, 
with the lion’s share being made in 
Taiwan. 
I recently visited Taipei and the Tai-
wan Semiconductor Company, where 
they manufacture chips designed by 
other companies all around the world. 
It is a great business model for TSMC, 
and it is good for the designers of the 
chips because TSMC, being located in 
Taiwan, can make them for about 30 
percent less than a fab or manufac-
turing facility here in the United 
States. But the problem is, we make 
zero percent of the advanced semi-
conductors in the world right here at 
home, and that is a huge risk. 
In the summer of 2020, I introduced 
the bipartisan CHIPS for America Act 
with my friend and colleague MARK 
WARNER, the senior Senator from Vir-
ginia, to incentivize companies to 
reshore the manufacturing of semi-
conductors here in America. 
It is really chilling to think about 
how vulnerable we are to the semicon-
ductor supply chain. Think if there was 
another pandemic or a natural disaster 
or, Heaven forbid, the People’s Repub-
lic of China decides to ‘‘unify’’ with 
Taiwan. That would jeopardize our ac-
cess to these advanced semiconductors. 
It would have an immediate, negative 
impact on our economy. The Depart-
ment of Commerce said we would go 
into a recession immediately, and, de-
pending on how long it lasted, it would 
have catastrophic consequences. 
The bill that Senator WARNER and I 
introduced became law at the start of 
last year as part of the national de-
fense authorization bill, and for the 
last 16 months, we have been working 
on a way to fund this CHIPS Program. 
In the coming days, the House and the 
Senate will begin to resolve the dif-
ferences between the House and Senate 
versions of recently passed bills, and I 
am proud to be serving as a member of 
that conference committee. I am eager 
to dive into negotiations with our col-
leagues, and there certainly is a lot of 
urgency. 
Like so many supply chain vulnera-
bilities, once we realize that vulnera-
bility exists, we can’t necessarily turn 
it on a dime. It is going to take a lot 
of investment and perhaps a year or 
more to develop the capacity to manu-
facture these chips here in America. 
What is more, the global demand for 
semiconductors is expected to increase 
by 56 percent over the next decade. 
Think about 5G. Think about artificial 
intelligence, quantum computing. We 
rely more and more on technology and 
thus more and more on semiconductors 
every day, and we will continue to do 
so into the future. So it is absolutely 
critical that we start investing in do-
mestic chip manufacturing and do it 
now to ensure that we have the capac-
ity to meet our economic and national 
security needs. 
But, as we all have learned, recent 
events haven’t just taught us about the 
importance of a strong semiconductor 
supply chain; they have also taught us 
a lesson about energy security, about 
having reliable sources of energy. I 
don’t remember that energy security 
was much a part of the conversation 
before the Russians invaded Ukraine 
and Europe realized they were solely 
dependent on Russian oil and gas. So 
the war in Ukraine opened the world’s 
eyes to the dangers of that dependency 
on a single supplier, particularly one 
like the Russian Federation. And then 
Putin is using the profits from the 
price of oil, which has gone through 
the roof because of this uncertainty— 
he is using that money to fund his 
unprovoked war against Ukraine as 
well as threaten NATO and our other 
allies who don’t want to prop up Rus-
sia’s war machine. 
Here in the United States, we don’t 
rely on Russia to keep the lights on. 
Russia accounts for about 2 percent of 
our crude oil and petroleum imports, 
allowing us to ban Russian imports 
without risk of a major disruption. But 
our allies in Europe are not so lucky. 
They don’t just rely on Russian oil; 
they also need Russian gas. 
We have learned that Putin’s not 
afraid to use oil and gas as a weapon to 
tear up, threaten, and intimidate his 
adversaries. That was underscored in 
January of 2009 when Russia effectively 
turned off the gas to Ukraine for al-
most 3 weeks. This had an impact on at 
least 10 countries in Europe whose nat-
ural gas traveled through Ukraine. 
Today, we are seeing that movie re-
played again. Russia recently cut off 
the supply of natural gas to Bulgaria 
and Poland as retaliation for their sup-
port of the sanctions that we have im-
posed against Russia because of the 
Ukraine invasion. 
In many ways, the risks that we are 
seeing with the global energy supply 
today are similar to the supply chain 
vulnerabilities we have with semi-
conductors. When you rely upon a sin-
gle country for critical products, the 
decisions made by that country’s lead-
er could cause a supply to be cut off at 
a moment’s notice. 
This has obviously been a wake-up 
call for all of us. All countries are tak-
ing a hard look at where their energy 
supply comes from and trying to find 
ways to diversify their sources of en-
ergy and to insulate themselves from 
geopolitical 
disruptions, 
and 
the 
United States is no exception. 
In recent years, our conversation 
about energy policy seems to have been 
consumed by debates about what is the 
impact on the environment of fossil 
fuels, and I think the debate has large-
ly ignored questions about how policies 
that were being proposed would impact 
energy security. 
Many of our Democratic colleagues 
have 
proposed 
everything 
from 
fracking bans to unfeasible zero-net 
deadlines, to pie-in-the-sky proposals 
that, frankly, are unlikely to pass. 
There also are fantasies being foisted 
on the American people clearly not in 
the interest of our economy or our na-
tional security. 
But we know the President has the 
power of the pen, and he has repeatedly 
used it to undermine our domestic oil 
and gas industry here in the United 
States. Only hours after he was sworn 
in, President Biden canceled the per-
mit for the Keystone XL Pipeline and 
halted all new energy leasing and per-
mitting on public lands and waters. 
The Biden administration recently 
announced that it will resume oil and 
gas leases on Federal lands. That was 
good news, but then it undercut that 
announcement by saying it reduced the 
amount of land available and signifi-
cantly increased the overhead costs or 
royalties that must be paid to the Fed-
eral Government. 
By these kinds of policies, the Biden 
administration has effectively discour-
aged investments in new production 
here in America, and the American 
people are paying the price, including 
at the pump. 
Even when President Biden eventu-
ally makes the right decision, it seems 
to always come after a lot of delay. It 
took weeks, for example, and the loom-
ing likelihood of congressional action 
before the President banned Russian 
oil imports. 
The climate-only approach to energy 
policy isn’t going to cut it anymore. 
We can’t just look through a soda 
straw at what our energy policy is; we 
have to look at both the intended and 
unintended consequences. I believe our 
top priority must be to ensure that the 
United States and our friends and al-
lies around the world have access to af-
fordable energy. 
Now, I want to be clear, I support ef-
forts to diversify energy sources and 
reduce emissions, and I think one of

S2257 
May 3, 2022 
the best contributions to that has been 
the move from coal to natural gas 
when it comes to producing elec-
tricity—a 
significant 
reduction 
in 
emissions by that move alone. 
Now, back home in Texas, we em-
brace an ‘‘all of the above’’ energy 
strategy that includes oil, gas, wind, 
solar, and nuclear. ‘‘All of the above’’ 
makes sense because you want a diver-
sification of your supply—something 
we found out again or were reminded of 
when we had a big freeze I guess about 
a year and a half ago now which not 
only 
shut 
down 
our 
renewable 
sources—the wind turbines and solar 
panels—but also froze the gas pumps 
that compress natural gas and push it 
through the pipelines. So having a 
number of options allows you to be 
nimble and more flexible in the case of 
an emergency. 
We produce more electricity from 
wind turbines than any other State in 
the Nation—even our friends in Cali-
fornia, which may shock some people. 
On top of that, Texas-based companies 
are making serious strides in energy 
innovation, which I believe ultimately 
is the key to energy security and a 
cleaner environment and reduced emis-
sions. Texas-based companies are find-
ing ways to make our most prevalent 
and affordable energy sources cleaner. 
I believe we could do more here in 
Congress to encourage that kind of in-
novation and diversification of our en-
ergy sources, but those efforts must 
come second to energy security, which 
should be job No. 1. 
The fact of the matter is, renewables 
are not close to being capable of pro-
viding all of our electricity needs. In 
my State, it is about 20 percent. I 
think that is roughly the average 
around the country. But renewables ac-
count for less than 20 percent, I be-
lieve, across the board, of our elec-
tricity generation. We know the Sun 
doesn’t always shine and the wind 
doesn’t always blow, so you need a 
baseload when Mother Nature fails to 
deliver an adequate supply of energy. 
We need a reliable baseload, which 
means nuclear, oil and gas, and geo-
thermal and hydro where you can get 
it. 
If the President continues to wage 
war on American oil and gas compa-
nies, we will not have the capability to 
protect ourselves or our allies. Energy 
security is national security. If that 
fact was ever in doubt, Russia’s actions 
have provided complete clarity. Our 
top priority must be to pursue our 
independence, and we do that by diver-
sification and more production here at 
home. If we are able to bolster renew-
ables, invest in carbon capture tech-
nologies, and take other steps along 
the way to reduce emissions, that is 
great, but priority No. 1 for the United 
States and our allies must be energy 
security. 
The sooner the Biden administration 
views the oil and gas industry as 
friends rather than adversaries, the 
better off all of us will be. 
We are blessed to live in a resource- 
rich country, and there is no reason to 
put the energy security of the United 
States and our allies at risk because 
President Biden is trying to placate a 
part of his political base. 
The war in Ukraine is already high-
lighting the global energy security 
risk. We don’t need to make that prob-
lem worse. We don’t need to make it 
worse; we need to make it better. Now, 
I am not suggesting, either, that we 
embrace isolationist energy policies 
like the 1970s oil export ban, but we do 
need to take decisive action to reduce 
the world’s reliance on authoritarian 
regimes. Just as the pandemic led us to 
reevaluate vulnerabilities in our sup-
ply chains for semiconductors and per-
sonal protective equipment, this war is 
also pushing us to reevaluate global en-
ergy security. 
I hope this crisis—if there is any-
thing good that comes out of it—will 
serve as a reset button for our energy 
security efforts and discourage those 
who want to increase our dependency 
as opposed to maintaining and devel-
oping our energy security by diversi-
fying our energy sources and taking 
advantage of the natural resources 
that we have been blessed with in 
America. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise 
today to call for the rapid confirmation 
of Kenneth Wainstein to be Under Sec-
retary for Intelligence and Analysis at 
the Department of Homeland Security. 
The Under Secretary for Intelligence 
and Analysis, or I&A, sits at a critical 
juncture—between the analytic work of 
the intelligence community and the in-
formation-sharing role of the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security. 
The Under Secretary receives and 
analyzes intelligence and law enforce-
ment information related to Homeland 
Security and ensures its prompt dis-
semination throughout the Depart-
ment as well as to Federal, State, 
local, and Tribal departments that 
need this information to protect our 
Nation. 
The nominee, who has been before 
our committee and passed out, comes 
with an incredible background for this 
position. Ken Wainstein served the 
United States throughout his career as 
a Federal prosecutor, at the highest 
levels of the FBI as general counsel and 
Chief of Staff to FBI Director Robert 
Mueller, as U.S. attorney for DC, and 
as the first-ever Assistant Attorney 
General of the Justice Department’s 
National Security Division, and as 
Homeland Security Advisor to Presi-
dent George W. Bush. 
The truth is, after a remarkable ca-
reer, he went into the private sector, 
and the fact that he is willing to come 
back and serve this administration, al-
though he was a career official on the 
other side, speaks to his character. 
The role of heading DHS intelligence 
is not without challenges, which is why 
we need this confirmed Under Sec-
retary. The I&A mission continues to 
evolve and mature since its creation in 
the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, and 
there is a clear tension between its 
dual missions: national intelligence 
and departmental priorities. 
Some Members, including myself, 
were very unhappy with the I&A’s op-
erations in Portland in 2020, and then 
disappointed that the I&A provided 
next to no warning about what was to 
come on January 6, 2021. These epi-
sodes clearly reveal work needs to be 
done to improve DHS and I&A in par-
ticular. 
At the same time, we all know the 
First Amendment protects Americans’ 
right to free speech and nonviolent, 
peaceful protest, and a fundamental 
role of our government is to defend the 
Constitution, 
including 
these 
First 
Amendment rights. 
As the confirmed head of DHS’s intel-
ligence operation, Mr. Wainstein will 
be charged with ensuring that DHS 
I&A keeps upholding those standards 
and protects civil rights, while also en-
suring that I&A’s work is completely 
apolitical. 
To summarize, the role of the Under 
Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis 
is critical for the Department of Home-
land Security and the country. 
Consequently, I ask unanimous con-
sent that notwithstanding rule XXII, 
the Senate consider the following nom-
ination: Calendar No. 792, Kenneth L. 
Wainstein, of Virginia, to be Under 
Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis 
at the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity; that the Senate vote on the nomi-
nation without intervening action or 
debate; that the motion to reconsider 
be considered made and laid upon the 
table; and that any statements relating 
to the nomination be printed in the 
RECORD. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Kentucky. 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, we learned last 
week that the Department of Home-
land Security has established a ‘‘Min-
istry of Truth.’’ They are calling it the 
Disinformation 
Governance 
Board— 
how Orwellian. 
Now, the details are scarce of this ef-
fort, but one would assume that the 
DHS Intelligence and Analysis would 
be part of that effort. 
The nominee being considered today 
was one of the architects of George W. 
Bush administrations’s bulk metadata 
collection at the NSA—what a great 
recommendation for him. Sarcasm in-
cluded—which gathered the private 
electronic communications of millions 
of Americans without warrant. 
Is this someone we would want to be 
involved in the Biden administrations’s 
new ‘‘Ministry of Truth’’? 
I will not provide my consent to ex-
panding the surveillance state and the 
suppression 
of 
First 
and 
Fourth 
Amendment rights of Americans. 
I oppose this nominee and object.

S2258 
May 3, 2022 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think 
we have an incredible nominee in Mr. 
Wainstein. He has served our govern-
ment in the Justice Department at the 
FBI at virtually every level. 
I think if my colleague, the Senator 
from Kentucky, is concerned about 
this, we ought to have somebody who is 
confirmed in this role. 
And I would acknowledge that there 
are Members who share his concerns 
about First Amendment rights, includ-
ing one of the members of our com-
mittee who has worked through Mr. 
Wainstein and was part of the group 
that unanimously voted to move him 
forward. 
I am disappointed by the objection, 
and, unfortunately, both the security 
of our country and, candidly, the pro-
tection of those First Amendment 
rights is undermined by not having 
this nominee in place. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to

Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask 
consent to speak for up to 2 minutes on 
the nomination. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF ELIZABETH DE LEON BHARGAVA 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I urge 
my colleagues to join me in advancing 
the nomination of Elizabeth de Leon 
Bhargava to be Assistant Secretary for 
Administration of the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development. Ms. 
Bhargava would oversee offices respon-
sible for recruitment and staffing, pro-
curement, and providing administra-
tive support for HUD employees. She 
will ensure the Department takes steps 
to retain the best talent and grow 
HUD’s workforce to meet current and 
future needs. 
Yesterday, I came to Washington on 
the commercial United flight with Sec-
retary Fudge. She is working hard 
every day to serve her former constitu-
ents. I live in her old congressional dis-
trict. And to serve this country, she 
needs qualified employees confirmed 
like Ms. Bhargava. 
For more than 4 years, Ms. Bhargava 
served as New York State Deputy Sec-
retary for Labor and Workforce, di-
rectly responsible for workforce policy 
and operations affecting more than 9 
million New Yorkers. She recognizes 
that the program continuity depends 
on strong leadership at the top and 
meeting the Department’s urgent staff-
ing needs. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
supporting 
the 
nomination 
of 
Ms. 
Bhargava to HUD. 
NOMINATION OF JOSHUA FROST 
Mr. 
GRASSLEY. 
Mr. 
President, 
today, the Senate will vote on the 
nomination of Joshua Frost to be an 
Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for 
Financial Markets. While by most ac-
counts Mr. Frost is qualified for this 
position, I will vote against his nomi-
nation out of growing concerns that 
the Treasury Department has been der-
elict in its responsibilities to the Sen-
ate Finance Committee and its mem-
bers. 
The most recent example of Treasury 
thumbing its nose at the committee is 
the unprecedented delay of Secretary 
Yellen in agreeing to testify before the 
committee on the President’s budget. 
Typically, 
the 
Treasury 
Secretary 
agrees to testify before the Finance 
Committee the week that the Presi-
dent releases his budget. Since 2005, the 
only other time a Treasury Secretary 
testified before the committee more 
than 3 days after the release of the 
President’s 
budget 
was 
Secretary 
Geithner in 2009, and he appeared just 6 
days after the President released his 
budget. 
This year, 37 days have passed since 
the President unveiled his budget, and 
Secretary Yellen has yet to agree on a 
date to come before the committee. Fi-
nance Committee members have been 
informed that the earliest Secretary 
Yellen will appear before the com-
mittee is sometime in June, more than 
2 months after the release of the Presi-
dent’s budget. The reason given for this 
unprecedented delay is that Secretary 
Yellen is too busy to fit the Finance 
Committee into her schedule. This ex-
cuse rings hollow when just last week 
she was able to find time in her busy 
schedule to give the keynote address at 
an event held at the liberal Brookings 
Institution. 
So Secretary Yellen has time in her 
busy schedule to address the D.C. lib-
eral intelligentsia at the Brookings In-
stitution, but can’t find time to answer 
the questions of elected Members of 
Congress and their constituents? This 
is unacceptable, and the Treasury De-
partment must be held to account for 
shirking its responsibilities. In light of 
this, I intend to vote against the nomi-
nation of Mr. Frost to be an Assistant 
Secretary of the Treasury for Financial 
Markets. 
VOTE ON FROST NOMINATION 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, all postcloture time 
is expired. 
The question is, Will the Senate ad-
vise and consent to the Frost nomina-
tion? 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask for 
the yeas and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond. 
The clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk called the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the 
Senator from Colorado (Mr. BENNET), 
and the Senator from New Hampshire 
(Mrs. SHAHEEN) are necessarily absent.

are necessarily absent: the Senator 
from Alabama (Mr. SHELBY) and the

ECONOMY 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today to talk about 
our Nation’s economy. On Friday, we 
saw new inflation numbers, and we 
found inflation remains the worst that 
it’s been in 40 years. 
We also found out that in the first 
three months of this year, the Amer-
ican economy actually shrank. 
Why did it shrink? Well, because of 
the inflation that is hitting hard every 
family in America. So now we have a 
terrible situation with soaring infla-
tion and a stagnant economy—both at 
the same time. People are paying more 
and more, and they are getting less and 
less. 
Now, the last time this happened, 
was in the 1970s. It was called ‘‘stagfla-
tion.’’ Back then, all the liberal eco-
nomic experts said it was impossible, 
you couldn’t have soaring inflation in a 
stagnant economy, but we did. And 
now here we are 50 years later, same 
thing again. 
This is hitting American families 
like a sledgehammer, and the people 
are suffering all across this country. 
Inflation has been so high for so long, 
the experts tell us it might lead to a 
recession.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2260 
May 3, 2022 
Now, a recession is when the econ-
omy shrinks for six months. We are al-
ready halfway there. Joe Biden, the 
other day, said everything was fine. He 
said he was not concerned at all about 
a recession. 
He said no one is predicting a reces-
sion right now. 
Well, that is just not true. Maybe he 
is not listening, but people within his 
own administration are predicting ad-
ditional dire economic times ahead. 
Look, our economy has underper-
formed projections in four out of the 
last five quarters since Joe Biden has 
become President. Joe Biden’s own 
Labor Secretary admits a recession is a 
real likelihood. Last month, Deutsche 
Bank predicted a recession by the end 
of next year. Three days later, the 
Bank of America told investors infla-
tion shock is worsening; interest rate 
shock is just beginning; and recession 
shock is coming. 
Bank of America went on to say that 
‘‘inflation is out of control and infla-
tion causes recessions.’’ 
Last month, Larry Summers pointed 
out that the United States has never 
had the current inflation rate and the 
current unemployment rate without a 
recession coming within 2 years. 
Larry Summers went on to say: 
Recession in the next couple of years is 
more likely than not. 
More likely than not. 
I suspect that is how the consensus will 
evolve. 
Well, Larry Summers is right. He has 
been right before. He has been right 
about inflation. This is economics 101. 
It is also American history 101. 
High inflation brings about a change 
in the Federal Reserve, so they raise 
interest rates, and when they raise in-
terest rates, the economy slows down. 
That is what we are seeing. 
Inflation is the worst it has been in 
40 years, and in March the Federal Re-
serve raised rates for the first time in 
4 years. The Fed is widely expected to 
raise rates again very soon. It is easy 
to see where this is all going. Joe 
Biden’s inflation will soon lead to Joe 
Biden’s recession. Now, maybe Joe 
Biden is hoping that stagnation will be 
transitory, just like he said of inflation 
for month after month after month 
after month after month. 
The American people have seen this 
before. Unlike Joe Biden, the American 
people are concerned about inflation 
and they are concerned about a stag-
nant economy and they are concerned 
about a recession. 
Apparently, the President likes to 
laugh about it. In the last 12 months, 
we have seen the highest inflation ever 
recorded for household staples—chick-
en, lunch meat, baby food. It is hard to 
get infant formula now. There is a 
shortage of that all across the country. 
The American people are feeling stuck 
in place. They are very stressed, and 
they feel the squeeze every day. 
One estimate says the typical family 
will pay $5,200 more this year than they 
did last year just to buy the same 
things. That is $100 a week. This is in 
addition to the inflation that we suf-
fered last year. Add the two together, 
working families are paying much, 
much more to buy the same things 
that they bought 2 years ago. 
The truth is painful, and the painful 
truth is that the average American 
family is poorer today than they were 
the day that Joe Biden took office. 
People have had to change so much in 
their lives because of this. They have 
had to change the way they drive, had 
to change the way they shop and eat, 
had to change the way they live. 
A poll last week found that two out 
of every three American families have 
had to cut back on spending because of 
inflation. Half said they are struggling 
to pay rent. Nearly 90 percent of the 
American people said they want Con-
gress to bring down inflation. 
So what have Democrats had to do 
about this over the last 15 months? 
Well, last week, the Democratic leader 
said this: He said he wants to raise 
taxes. He said it is the only way to con-
ceivably bring down inflation—raising 
taxes. 
Well, that may be the only way that 
CHUCK SCHUMER knows, but I would 
just say that is not going to bring down 
inflation, and it is not going to help 
the economy. 
Prices are up. Interest rates are 
going up. Now Democrats want taxes 
to go up on top of it. Energy prices are 
at record highs. You have to empty 
your wallet to fill your tank, and yet 
CHUCK SCHUMER’s answer is higher tax 
rates. 
With a recession ready to hit the 
country, Democrats want to take more 
money out of the pockets of hard-work-
ing people. Well, there is not a lot left 
to take, I would say to the majority 
leader of the U.S. Senate and to the 
President of the United States. 
It is really no wonder, then, that two 
out of every three Americans dis-
approve of the way the President of the 
United States is handling the economy. 
The American people know that Demo-
crats—every one of them voted in lock-
step with Joe Biden for 15 months. 
They remember every single Democrat 
in the Senate voted with Joe Biden on 
his major spending bill. The American 
people remember every Democrat sup-
ported Joe Biden’s economic priorities, 
which, of course, hurt the economy. 
The results have been disastrous for 
the American people. We know what we 
need to do. We need to lower costs. We 
need to reduce these burdensome regu-
lations. We need to get back to Amer-
ican energy—American energy, afford-
able energy, reliable energy—not going 
hat in hand to people around the world. 
We do much better if we are American 
energy dominant, selling energy to our 
friends rather than having to buy it 
from our enemies. 
We have had the strongest economic 
times in the United States in my life-
time prior to the pandemic. We know 
what brought it to us. It was lower 
taxes, more American energy, limiting 
regulations. Those are the things that 
make a difference. Those are the things 
that Joe Biden has chosen to ignore. 
The American people are struggling 
and suffering, and it is about time they 
get an administration focused on their 
needs, not on the needs of an adminis-
tration which is woefully out of touch 
with the American people. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
U.S. SUPREME COURT 
Mr. 
DURBIN. 
Madam 
President, 
Americans across the country today 
woke up to a rare occurrence in the 
history of our American democracy. 
The highest Court in our land is pre-
paring to eliminate a federally pro-
tected constitutional right—a woman’s 
right to choose. I am an amateur histo-
rian, but I can’t think of a precedent in 
history where the Supreme Court has 
taken away a constitutional right after 
it has been in place for 50 years. 
Women in America may soon live in a 
country where they have fewer rights 
than their parents and grandparents. 
Let me be clear. The leak of the ma-
jority draft opinion in Dobbs v. Jack-
son Women’s Health Organization is a 
breach of the Court’s confidential de-
liberations. But the opinion which— 
draft opinion, which has been authenti-
cated by the Chief Justice, is very real. 
It is a peculiar political event this 
afternoon. Senator MCCONNELL, the Re-
publican leader, who has focused more 
of his energy and efforts on reshaping 
the Federal judiciary to reflect his po-
litical point of view, was virtually si-
lent on the issue of this Alito draft 
opinion on the Dobbs case. He couldn’t 
be pinned down as to whether he would 
acknowledge it or even say something 
good about it. Supposedly, it was the 
answer to his political prayer. 
He went so far in trying to reach this 
goal as to protect a vacancy on the Su-
preme Court for almost 10 months. 
Antonin Scalia died while Barack 
Obama was still President, in his last 
year of his second term, and MCCON-
NELL—Senator MCCONNELL
made the 
argument that he did not have the au-
thority, since he was a lameduck Presi-
dent, in Senator MCCONNELL’s words, 
to fill the vacancy. 
So the Supreme Court was there with 
8 members for 10 months until Senator 
MCCONNELL’s political prayer was an-
swered again and Donald Trump was 
elected President and could appoint a 
Justice of Senator MCCONNELL’s polit-
ical liking. So he has been very suc-
cessful in his approach to filling vacan-
cies on the U.S. Supreme Court with 
people who agree with his political phi-
losophy. 
Now, one of them, Justice Alito, is 
about to hand down an opinion which 
eliminates Roe v. Wade, a position 
which 
is 
consistent 
with 
Senator 
MCCONNELL’s belief that has been stat-
ed on the floor many times. And yet, 
when he was asked today whether he 
was in favor of this opinion, he refused 
to even answer. He wanted to focus on

S2261 
May 3, 2022 
who leaked this opinion. Well, of 
course, that is an important question. 
The Court is working on it right now 
with the Chief Justice turning his U.S. 
Marshal on the case. 
But he would—Senator MCCONNELL 
insisted on avoiding even taking a posi-
tion on this draft opinion that has now 
been spread across America. It makes 
no sense at all. 
Women across America are grappling 
with the very real concern and, yes, 
you could say fear, that they may lose 
access to reproductive freedom and 
choice in a matter of weeks. If true, 
this decision will end a 50-year guar-
antee that reproductive rights are pro-
tected by our Constitution. 
If this radical decision becomes the 
law of the land, it would deny tens of 
millions of Americans their bodily au-
tonomy. In an instant, abortion would 
be rendered illegal in more than a 
dozen States. 
In this land of liberty, the govern-
ment has no business interfering with a 
woman’s right to her own reproductive 
healthcare. It is her right to choose, 
plain and simple. But for the past sev-
eral decades, the far right has fought 
relentlessly to eliminate this constitu-
tional right. They have waged a harsh 
campaign to, in some instances, actu-
ally punish the women seeking abor-
tions. 
Here is what I am describing: In 
Texas last year, lawmakers passed a 
law that has turned bounty hunters 
loose on anyone who even helps a 
woman receive an abortion. 
And that Mississippi law that the 
Court is poised to uphold, it makes no 
exception for women seeking abortion 
in the case of rape or incest. 
At a certain point, you have to ask: 
What is the real goal here? These re-
strictive laws won’t stop people from 
getting abortions. We know that from 
history. They only make the procedure 
dangerously unsafe and, in some cases, 
prohibitively expensive for low-income 
Americans. Women’s lives are literally 
at stake. 
Furthermore, we have hardly begun 
to reckon with the consequences of this 
decision when it comes to other funda-
mental liberties. 
I read Justice Alito’s draft opinion. 
It is hard for me to describe it in a few 
words, but when it comes to issues as 
fundamental as privacy and personal 
choice, Justice Alito takes a pretty 
harsh point of view. 
He acknowledges that cases that are 
often cited in the name of privacy, 
such as Griswold—I can vaguely re-
member that before the Griswold deci-
sion in the 1960s, the decision of selling 
contraceptives was subject to strict 
State regulation, and in many States, 
they prohibited the sale of any forms of 
contraception. It is hard for America 
to even believe that, when you see 
forms of contraception being adver-
tised on television these days, but 
there was a time in the fifties and be-
fore when State regulations prevailed. 
Griswold v. Connecticut was a Su-
preme Court case that took a look at 
the regulation in Connecticut and said: 
It is fundamentally wrong. We believe 
that individuals have a right of privacy 
to make their own decision on contra-
ception. 
That was a privacy right, which I re-
spect. And yet, if you are careful and 
read every single word, you will never 
find the word ‘‘privacy’’ in the Con-
stitution. The Supreme Court found 
the right to privacy by combining the 
rights of several other different amend-
ments. 
That wasn’t good enough for Justice 
Alito on the basis of this draft opinion 
we have been given. He said since he 
can’t find the word ‘‘abortion’’ in the 
Constitution, he doesn’t believe there 
is a right to it. And he goes on to com-
pare it to privacy rights, like the one I 
just described in Griswold v. Con-
necticut, and he said that is just a 
matter of saying privacy is your right 
to choose your own personal lifestyle, 
or words to that effect. 
Well, it is more than that. It gets 
down to the fundamentals. And if you 
are going to be making a decision with 
something as basic as a family—a hus-
band and wife deciding how many chil-
dren and when you will have children— 
it really is one of the most basic things 
that frequently you would define free-
dom in this country. 
That is not the way Justice Alito de-
fines it in the Dobbs decision. If we 
apply Justice Alito’s reasoning behind 
this draft decision to other rights, the 
implications are staggering. The Su-
preme Court could turn back the clock 
on a whole host of civil liberties. 
What is next—the return of State 
bans on contraception? bans on same- 
sex marriage? bans on the permissible 
conduct of LGBTQ people and their dif-
ferent sexual orientation situation? All 
of that can be on the table. 
Now that the Supreme Court has con-
firmed that this draft opinion is au-
thentic, the Members of this Senate 
cannot delay. We need to hold a vote 
codifying the right to abortion into 
law. Let’s show the American people 
where each Senator stands. 
Senator MCCONNELL ducked the ques-
tion at a press conference today. I still 
don’t understand why. But he can’t 
duck the vote. We are going to make 
sure that there is a vote and that his 
Members, as well as the Senator, have 
an opportunity to express themselves 
on the record. 
Will we allow our children to inherit 
a nation that is less free than the one 
their parents grew up in? That is the 
question which presents itself to this 
Senate.

Mr. President, last month, on the 
evening of April 5, a drone whizzed 
through the skies of Shanghai, China. 
The city had been shut down for nearly 
a week following a recent uptick in 
COVID. 
China’s 
government 
forced 
Shanghai’s nearly 26 million residents 
into a strict lockdown. Nobody was al-
lowed to leave their home, not even to 
buy groceries or medicine. 
By the evening of April 5, many resi-
dents were running out of food. Panic 
was starting to set in. In one housing 
complex, the residents began shouting 
from their windows, demanding that 
the government provide them with the 
basics. 
As they shouted, the drone stopped 
flying and began hovering over their 
housing complex. It blinked a white 
flashing light as a robotic voice issued 
a command—a command that would 
send chills down the spine of anyone. 
The voice instructed the residents of 
that Shanghai apartment complex to 
comply with the lockdown and then 
said: ‘‘Control your soul’s desire for 
freedom.’’ 
As government drones patrol Shang-
hai’s skies, robotic dogs are patrolling 
the city’s empty streets, barking com-
mands for citizens to ‘‘remain civ-
ilized.’’ 
These methods of enforcement and 
control did not appear out of thin air. 
For years, the Chinese government has 
poured its treasure and talent into de-
veloping next-generation technology, 
like dystopian drones, robotic dogs, 
and the most sophisticated surveil-
lance apparatus in the world. 
Technology, of course, by itself is 
neither good nor bad. The same tech-
nology can be used to advance freedom 
and democracy as they use to suppress 
it. For instance, facial recognition 
technology is built into our smart 
phones to protect our sensitive data. In 
China, this technology is also used to 
monitor their citizenry and tabulate 
their ‘‘social credit scores.’’ 
The Chinese government also uses ar-
tificial intelligence, AI, for the troves 
of data it collects on its own citizens 
every day, particularly on ethnic mi-
norities 
like 
the 
Uighers, 
against 
whom the Chinese government is com-
mitting human rights abuses. 
Scientific and technological innova-
tion are critical to America’s future 
economic prosperity and standard of 
living, but innovation is also critical to 
our national security and to the future 
of our country. 
Who do we want to take the lead in 
shaping the future, the United States 
or the other democracies of the world 
or authoritarian states like China and 
Russia? 
China’s technological clout is a prod-
uct of decades of investment. This 
chart shows the annual growth of re-
search and development expenditures 
since 1995. Note that leading the path 
is China; Korea is second, Taiwan is 
third, Israel is fourth, and the United 
States, five. 
From 1995 to 2018, China increased its 
investment in research and develop-
ment by more than 15 percent on aver-
age, reaching $463 billion in 2018. Since 
then, they have accelerated the pace. 
China’s investments were nearly dou-
ble the increase we have seen in Korea, 
which has the second highest R&D. 
During that same period, America grew 
by less than 5 percent, leaving it only 
$89 billion ahead of China.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2262 
May 3, 2022 
Last December, a report from Har-
vard warned that China is now a ‘‘full- 
spectrum peer competitor’’ when it 
comes to advanced technology like AI 
and quantum computing. 
For years, I have been working on 
the Senate Appropriations Committee 
to address this gap—to boost federal in-
vestments in science, technology, and 
medical R&D. For America to remain 
the scientific and technological leader 
of the world, we need to now act sig-
nificantly to increase investment. 
The U.S. Innovation and Competition 
Act, or USICA, will enable us to make 
these investments. It is a down pay-
ment on a more secure America. 
USICA will mark our Nation’s largest 
investment in science and technology 
since Apollo 11. It will strengthen our 
national security in the age of cyber 
warfare. It will harness American inno-
vation to drive economic growth. 
It includes a provision I led with Sen-
ator SHAHEEN that requires the U.S. to 
increase exports by 200 percent to Afri-
can, Latin American, and Caribbean 
markets where China is already mak-
ing considerable investments. This pro-
vision is going to help American work-
ers. And, importantly, USICA will also 
reinvigorate American manufacturing 
by bringing microchip production back 
to our shores. It devotes $50 billion to 
expand our U.S. microchip industry—a 
critical component in our future econ-
omy. 
Microchips, 
computer 
chips—the 
small pieces of silicon that power ev-
erything around us from smartphones 
to appliances like refrigerators and 
microwaves—even our cars have dozens 
of microchips. 
Right now, there is a serious global 
shortage. It has disrupted virtually 
every industry. It is leading to higher 
prices for all types of products. Amer-
ica actually invented the microchip, 
and we used to make them here, too— 
nearly 40 percent of the world’s supply. 
But we let that manufacturing produc-
tion get away. Now we have got to 
bring it home. Today, we produce only 
10 percent of the world’s supply of 
microchips. Also, microchip production 
has massive consequences for our econ-
omy. When a disaster like COVID hits 
that causes a microchip factory in Ma-
laysia to halt production, American 
businesses and consumers suffer. We 
have become dangerously dependent on 
China and other competitors when it 
comes to securing our supply chain 
with microchips. 
With USICA, we can rebuild Amer-
ica’s manufacturing and solve supply 
chain shortages. It will incentivize 
American companies to hire more 
American workers to make their prod-
ucts right here at home. In addition to 
shoring up America’s supply chain, 
USICA will help protect American con-
sumers. 
The House has a counterpart bill, the 
America COMPETES Act. Included in 
that is something known as the IN-
FORM Consumers Act. I introduced 
this with Senator CASSIDY, a Repub-
lican from Louisiana, and it was led in 
the House by Congresswoman SCHA-
KOWSKY and Representative GUS BILI-
RAKIS. This bill will help prevent coun-
terfeit goods from China and stolen 
goods from our retail stores from being 
hawked by shady sellers on online mar-
ketplaces. 
It was 10 years ago or more, Home 
Depot came to see me and said: We got 
a problem. 
And I said: What is it? 
They said: Our drills are being sold 
on an internet marketplace. 
I said: What is wrong with that? 
They said: We are not selling them. 
They are the drills which are made in 
our sole manufacturing facility in 
China. Somewhere after they are made, 
they are stolen, and someone is steal-
ing enough of them that they can offer 
them for sale on the internet. 
I said: Well, that explains a lot of 
what is going on. 
Go into a drugstore today and try to 
buy a deodorant, and you will find it is 
under lock and key. And you think to 
yourself: Wait a minute. That only 
costs a couple bucks. Why is it under 
lock and key? Because it is so fre-
quently stolen and bought. Whether it 
is Home Depot’s drills or deodorants 
sold at Walgreen’s, people are stealing 
them in volume not for personal use or 
personal sale, but because there are 
gangs that are peddling these goods on 
the internet. 
So we put together a bill, Senator 
CASSIDY
and myself, that prevents 
these counterfeit goods and stolen 
goods from being sold without dis-
closing the name of the seller. We had 
some resistance from some of these 
internet marketplaces. They didn’t 
want to disclose the name of the seller. 
We told them: That seller is selling sto-
len goods on your marketplace. 
‘‘Well, that is their business. They 
have a right to confidentiality.’’ 
It took a long time to persuade them 
otherwise. 
Our bill is being supported by a broad 
coalition: the National Association of 
Manufacturers, the Fraternal Order of 
Police, the AFL–CIO, and Consumer 
Reports. 
I think it is about time. You look at 
these gangs that are running in and 
doing all this shoplifting in massive 
amounts and pulling it into garbage 
bags. It isn’t for them to go out and sit 
on the sidewalk and try to sell what 
they have stolen. They have got a syn-
dicate—a gangland operation which fil-
ters all these goods into an internet 
marketplace. Now, if we can start to 
identify the sellers of these illegal and 
stolen goods, perhaps we can start to 
bring justice to this situation. 
Finally, USICA is going to make cru-
cial investments in America’s capacity 
to 
innovate 
and 
pioneer 
groundbreaking technology. It author-
izes billions of dollars to the National 
Science Foundation to help America’s 
scientists unlock the potential of AI, 
quantum computing, and other ad-
vanced technology. These investments 
will make a difference. 
Just 2 weeks ago, I was at the Uni-
versity of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, 
where Dr. Panchanathan, who heads up 
the National Science Foundation, made 
a visit. I am proud to report that many 
universities in our State do Federal re-
search, but the University of Illinois 
may do more than most, and they re-
ceive many grants from the National 
Science Foundation. 
We welcomed the Director of that 
science foundation to Illinois, and he 
made a point of looking at the projects 
that were being funded. 
I can’t even start to describe to you 
what some of them are. I am just a lib-
eral arts lawyer. I heard these descrip-
tions about the next generation of 
computing and technology. 
Let me tell you about one of the 
products which I did understand. It was 
led by Professor Girish Chowdhary, 
along with a CEO of his company, 
Chinmay Soman. 
The project they started is called 
EarthSense. Picture this, if you will: 
Their goal is to combine machine 
learning with smart agriculture to 
build robots that our farmers can use 
to grow crops more efficiently and im-
prove the environment. 
So I watched the little robots go to 
work. They are powered by batteries, 
and if you can picture a cornfield—and 
we have got a lot of them in Illinois— 
these robots go between the rows of 
corn. And while they are going down 
the rows, they are gathering data and 
information: moisture in the ground; 
pictures of the soybeans and corn 
above them to determine whether or 
not they are being successful and most 
productive; and, at the same time, they 
are spreading seeds for a cover crop 
that is going to be growing following 
the harvesting of the corn. They are 
guided remotely by computer. And that 
is the future of farming, I believe. 
I think getting a picture of a farmer 
on a tractor is something you want to 
hang onto as a souvenir. The farms of 
the future are going to be managed by 
autonomous machines—robots and the 
like—and it is going to be a lot more 
efficient. It kind of breaks the hearts 
of our farmers to talk in these terms, 
but that is the reality, and we better 
be on top of it. EarthSense at the Uni-
versity of Illinois is a good illustration. 
Every State is home to institutions 
that 
support 
researchers 
working. 
Let’s give them the tools and resources 
they need. 
Do we want a future in which flying 
drones overhead demand that hungry 
citizens suppress their soul’s desire for 
freedom or a future in which robots 
help grow more food to feed the planet? 
Which nations and which values 
shape the world’s future will be in-
formed by the decisions we make in 
Congress and in Washington. 
Let’s send this competitiveness pack-
age to President Biden’s desk and in-
vest in America. 
I yield the floor.

PHY). The Senator from Iowa.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2263 
May 3, 2022 
REMEMBERING ORRIN G. HATCH 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I 
want to take a few minutes to speak 
about Orrin Hatch, whom many of us 
were fortunate enough to work with for 
many, many years. He had a tremen-
dous impact on the U.S. Senate and, in 
turn, on America. 
Barbara and I first want to express 
our condolences to Elaine, his wife, to 
their six children and their families, 
and to all of those who mourn the pass-
ing of this outstanding public servant 
and humble servant of the Lord. 
Senator Hatch’s funeral will be this 
Friday. 
In December of 2018, as his incredible 
42 years in the U.S. Senate were draw-
ing to a close, Orrin Hatch delivered 
the usual farewell address of retiring 
Members here on the Senate floor. 
Concerned about the direction that 
he had seen this institution take in re-
cent years, he said: 
We must restore the culture of comity, 
compromise, and mutual respect that used to 
exist here—and still does, in some respects. 
He also said: 
We must not be enemies but friends. 
In his farewell address and in the 
quotes that I just read, Orrin’s com-
mitment to mutual respect and integ-
rity is made very clear. It is also a 
charge to us to honor his memory by 
taking his words to heart as we go 
about our work here and in what we do 
across the country. 
During Orrin’s career, he served as 
chairman of the Finance Committee, 
the Judiciary Committee, and as Presi-
dent pro tem of the U.S. Senate. I have 
had the honor of doing those same 
three things. The Finance Committee 
and the Judiciary Committee are pow-
erful committees that deal with mat-
ters of broad importance to America. 
Decisions are made there that directly 
affect the lives of all Americans. Many 
times, dearly held beliefs and prin-
ciples held by different Senators come 
into conflict during long hours of work 
on important legislation or with high- 
level Cabinet and judicial nominations. 
Many of the tributes to Orrin have 
already made an observation which I 
share from our decades of working to-
gether at the negotiating table. 
Orrin was an unflinching, dyed-in- 
the-wool statesman who stayed true to 
his values and his convictions and 
finessed disagreements with a spirit of 
collegiality. He always remembered 
that he was working with friends and 
not enemies, and he always remem-
bered why he was in the U.S. Senate— 
to represent the great people of Utah. 
Orrin’s ability to disagree without 
being disagreeable was evident from 
his incredible level of productivity. Ac-
cording to the Orrin G. Hatch Founda-
tion, when he retired, he had passed 
more legislation into law than any liv-
ing Senator and had sponsored or co-
sponsored more than 750 bills that were 
enacted into law. 
As anyone who has spent any length 
of time in the Senate knows very well, 
getting legislation enacted into law, 
especially any enduring legislation, re-
quires the ability to develop relation-
ships and build trust with Members of 
both parties. To be productive over the 
long term, those relationships need to 
be able to withstand the unproductive 
partisanship that tends to dominate 
the fleeting issues of the day. 
Some of Orrin’s most significant leg-
islative accomplishments highlight his 
ability to work across the aisle. 
A prime example is the Drug Price 
Competition and Patent Term Restora-
tion Act, also known as Hatch-Wax-
man, stemming from his work with 
longtime 
Democratic 
Congressman 
Henry Waxman. 
Another important piece of legisla-
tion is the State Children’s Health In-
surance Program on which he worked 
with the late Senator Ted Kennedy. 
Orrin regularly talked about working 
with his good friend Senator Kennedy. 
For many years, Orrin Hatch and Ted 
Kennedy appeared to be complete oppo-
sites. They couldn’t imagine that those 
two 
Senators, 
with 
very 
different 
views, could even work together, much 
less be friends. People who say that 
don’t 
understand 
how 
the 
Senate 
works. 
Orrin’s spirit of bipartisanship didn’t 
come at the expense of his principles. 
Whether he was criticized for compro-
mising with Democrats or for not com-
promising enough, Orrin stuck with 
what he believed was the right thing to 
do. 
As chairman of the Finance Com-
mittee, during consideration of the Tax 
Cuts and Jobs Act, Orrin took the lead 
in drafting the most important tax re-
form legislation to be enacted in more 
than 30 years. 
When staff would discuss provisions 
to be included in the legislation, Orrin 
would repeatedly ask what the tax pol-
icy was. This was always his primary 
concern, not what was the most politi-
cally expedient policy or the best pol-
icy with which to win reelection. Orrin 
wanted to get the details right, and the 
rest of his decisions flowed from that 
perspective. I know because I worked 
with him for decades on that com-
mittee, particularly during that legis-
lation. 
Despite the criticism he would get 
from all sides, Orrin would never let 
that drive him off course from sticking 
with his values and from being civil 
with his colleagues. In his office, Orrin 
had a statue of a red-tailed hawk that 
staff had given to him. It had a plaque 
on it that said, ‘‘Tough old bird.’’ He 
adopted that phrase to describe himself 
to reporters and many who met him in 
his office. 
His ‘‘tough old bird’’ status was fully 
evident one late night during the Fi-
nance Committee’s consideration of 
that tax bill I have referred to—the 
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. When Repub-
licans were accused of only being inter-
ested in looking out for the very rich, 
Orrin forcefully noted his own very 
humble beginnings. He shared how he 
had worked his whole career for ‘‘peo-
ple who don’t have a chance.’’ 
Another principle Orrin shared with 
me was the importance of staff. To be 
effective day in and day out and to sift 
through the avalanche of information 
that comes into every Senator’s office, 
good staff is vital, particularly when a 
Senator has served for a lengthy period 
of time. Staff is important to pre-
serving the institutional memory of a 
committee. From years of around-the- 
clock work, they become really a sec-
ond family. They may not share blood 
ties, but they share loyalty and share 
service to dig down into the trenches 
when policymaking and politics be-
come a blood sport. So having lon-
gevity and cohesion within a staff is 
very, very important. 
A tradition that I believe was unique 
to the Hatch office was the election of 
a Pioneer Day’s King and Queen from 
the people within that office. Now, Pio-
neer Day is a Utah State holiday that 
celebrates the entry of the first Mor-
mon pioneers into Salt Lake Valley on 
July 24, 1847. To recognize that holiday, 
everyone working for Senator Hatch, 
whether in his personal office or on a 
committee he chaired, would vote for a 
King and Queen from a slate of can-
didates from within that office. At a 
lunch attended by the whole office, 
Orrin would announce the winners and 
crown the King and Queen. The corona-
tion was a salute to their service to the 
people of Utah, whose enduring pio-
neering spirit rings true to this very 
day. 
Outside of ensuring his office was a 
place that good staff would want to 
work, Orrin was no aloof boss. His sin-
cerity shined through with me and his 
Senate colleagues and then, of course, 
with his staff. He wanted to know what 
was happening in his staff’s lives and 
made sure to say that he appreciated 
their advice even when he might not 
take that advice. 
In closing, I return to what I said 
about Orrin and what he said in his 
farewell address. I associate myself 
with his remarks that we must be 
friends and not enemies. That is how 
we can honor Orrin Hatch and keep his 
spirit within this institution that he 
cared so much for and devoted much of 
his life to—here, right here, in the Sen-
ate. 
Orrin’s lifetime of public service 
helped generations of families in Utah 
achieve a better quality of life and 
made America and the U.S. Senate a 
better place. 
Godspeed, my friend. 
I yield the floor.

May 3, 2022 
floor to ask that we wake up to the 
threat of climate change—an issue that 
demands, right now, American leader-
ship. Over the recent recess, I traveled 
to parts of the world where climate ca-
tastrophe looms, and I saw firsthand 
what the absence of American leader-
ship has cost. 
My first stop was to the 2022 Our 
Oceans Conference in Palau, where I 
joined President Biden’s Special Envoy 
for Climate, Secretary John Kerry, to 
discuss the state of our oceans. It was 
another productive Our Oceans Con-
ference, leading to 410 commitments 
from around the world, worth $16.35 bil-
lion, to fund climate action, reduce 
plastic pollution, and reduce illegal 
fishing, among other things. These 
commitments are, indeed, a hopeful 
sign. 
Palau is a tiny, beautiful ocean na-
tion on the very far side of the Pacific 
Rim. This archipelago relies almost en-
tirely on the ocean, with tourism as 
the dominant industry and fishing as a 
way of life. Palau has a front-row seat 
to the changes taking place in our 
ocean. Rising ocean temperatures and 
sea levels, acidification, disrupted fish-
eries, more frequent storms—they see 
and feel these every day. 
I have spoken a lot about the amount 
of heat trapped by greenhouse gas pol-
lution 
and 
then 
absorbed 
by 
our 
oceans. It is equivalent to multiple 
Hiroshima-sized atomic bombs being 
detonated in the ocean every second. 
That is the heat load that we are add-
ing. In the last three decades, our 
oceans warmed eight times faster than 
in preceding decades. This is so much 
heat that you have to measure it using 
a special super unit of measurement— 
the zettajoule. 
What is a zettajoule? A joule—J-O-U- 
L-E—is our standard unit of heat en-
ergy. A zettajoule is that unit with 21 
zeros behind it. Here is a more prac-
tical reference: All of the energy used 
annually by all of the people in all of 
the world—all of it—adds up to one 
half—one half—of a zettajoule. 
What does this mean for oceans? Sci-
entists tell us that the top 2,000 meters 
of ocean absorbed a record 227 excess 
zettajoules of energy from 1981 to 2010. 
The 
current 
rate 
is 
to 
load 
14 
zettajoules of heat into our oceans 
every single year, which means we are 
loading into our oceans every year 
nearly 30 times more heat than the en-
tire energy use of the entire species on 
the entire planet. 
If you take a look at the segment of 
our energy use that is produced by fos-
sil fuels, that segment, which is less 
than half a zettajoule, is creating this 
effect of 14 zettajoules of heat into the 
oceans every single year. We are pump-
ing into the oceans nearly 30 times our 
total global human energy use. 
This kind of heat is why coral reefs 
face mass bleaching and are dying, and, 
of course, dead reefs threaten the col-
lapse of entire ocean ecosystems. It is 
not just dying reefs; when water 
warms, it expands, which means sea 
levels are rising and will rise by feet in 
the decades ahead—a big problem for 
coastal communities everywhere, in-
cluding Connecticut and Rhode Island. 
I landed in Palau on the heels of an 
unexpected 
tropical 
storm— 
unseasonal—that grew into a violent 
typhoon. Climate change makes these 
storms more frequent, more severe, and 
more unpredictable, putting coastal in-
frastructure everywhere under serious 
threat. 
From Palau, I met up with a congres-
sional delegation traveling to India and 
Nepal—two nations at the center of 
dire global security risks. Nepal’s Hi-
malayan glaciers are the source of 
much of Asia’s freshwater. The Hima-
layan snowcap is so big, it is described 
as the Earth’s third pole—the North 
Pole with all of its ice, the South Pole 
with all of its ice, and the Himalayan 
glacier with all of its ice. As the planet 
warms, 
those 
Himalayan 
glaciers 
shrink away. 
Our 1.5-degree Celsius global warm-
ing target right now is, in effect, a 2.1- 
degree Celsius global warming target 
for the Himalayas. Himalayan glacier 
mass is expected to drop by more than 
a third by the end of the century. If the 
glaciers aren’t there to feed the rivers, 
the rivers don’t have the water to flow. 
For India, the consequences are dead-
ly serious. According to the U.S. Insti-
tute of Peace, losing that glacial flow 
will spell rampant sickness, hunger, 
and economic calamity downstream, 
which could, as they say—I quote 
them—‘‘in turn, open the door to con-
flict.’’ Well, obviously, if people don’t 
have the water they need to live, they 
are going to fight over it. 
A likely flashpoint is Kashmir, the 
region between India and Pakistan— 
two nuclear-armed adversaries. India’s 
Parliament has reported on the chal-
lenge climate change poses for distrib-
uting scarce Himalayan water among 
Indian and Pakistani downstream re-
gions. India plans new dams on the 
Chenab River in Kashmir. Pakistan 
fears that India will pinch off river 
flow into Pakistan, perhaps to put eco-
nomic survival pressure on Pakistan in 
times of conflict. Suspicions between 
the two countries of riparian mischief 
run high, and long memories of conflict 
linger. Food security, electricity gen-
eration, and public safety are all at 
stake, 
giving 
nuclear-armed 
adver-
saries a lot to fight over. 
So what did we see and feel in India? 
Scorching heat—109 degrees Fahrenheit 
at the Taj Mahal. Last week in Delhi, 
thermometers topped 110 degrees. In 
Nawabshah, 
Pakistan, 
temperatures 
hit 1171⁄2 degrees. In another area of 
Pakistan, temperatures exceeded 122 
degrees. Try to walk around and work 
and live outdoors in 122 degrees. It 
doesn’t work. This is the kind of heat 
where the human body no longer func-
tions properly. It can’t cool itself. And, 
of course, electricity grids fail, and lots 
of water evaporates. 
We discussed these issues with the 
Nepali Prime Minister and Congress 
president. Their government is clear- 
eyed about this problem. Their glaciers 
are thinning before their eyes. They 
see it now, they feel it in river flow, 
and they see it in the risk of glacier 
collapse, which leads to catastrophic 
downstream flooding. They feel all 
these shocks to their region’s food sup-
ply and every tremor from their neigh-
bors’ conflicts. Their message to us is 
really clear: ‘‘Nepal is ready to join 
hands with the U.S. on the issue of cli-
mate change,’’ one of the Nepali Par-
liamentarians told us, but the United 
States needs to step up. 
Our last stop was Doha in Qatar, 
where I met with airmen of the Rhode 
Island Air National Guard and other 
servicemembers carrying out vital mis-
sions in the Middle East at Al Udeid 
Air Base. 
The Defense Department is worried 
about climate heat compromising its 
flight operations in places as hot as 
Doha. It gets hard to operate out on 
the runways in the kind of heat that 
climate change is causing, and Doha is 
hot. You may recall the news a few 
years ago about Qatar considering air- 
conditioning the out of doors. DOD’s 
October 2021 Climate Risk Analysis 
listed rising temperatures affecting 
flight operations and ‘‘aircraft per-
formance’’—‘‘loss of payload capacity, 
range, and loiter time’’—as the mili-
tary has to schedule for ‘‘too hot to 
fly’’ times of day. For the airmen I met 
with, out protecting our country, these 
are real issues now. 
The world cries out for Congress to 
act, to reclaim America’s place of lead-
ership on this defining issue of our 
time. The people of Palau cannot fix 
the ocean heat on their own. The peo-
ple of India, Pakistan, and Nepal can-
not solve the disappearance of the Hi-
malayan glaciers on their own. Our air-
men cannot cool the temperatures dis-
rupting their flight operations on their 
own. 
President Clinton once said that the 
world is always ‘‘more impressed by 
the power of our [American] example 
than by [any] example of our [Amer-
ican] power.’’ If we are to remain Dan-
iel Webster’s city on a hill, we must re-
flect the power of that good American 
example beyond our borders. This goes 
beyond climate change; this goes to the 
heart of the integrity of the American 
brand. 
At the end of an American century 
where we rebuilt Europe with the Mar-
shall Plan and rebuilt Asia with the 
MacArthur Plan and set the stage for 
the freedom and peace and economic 
growth that this American century has 
produced, we are at risk of squandering 
that entire reputation as people from 
Palau to Nepal suffer and experience 
the consequences of climate change 
and know perfectly well that America 
could have and should have led, that 
America could have and should have 
done something about this, that Amer-
ica knew what the climate risk was 
and failed to act, and that the failure is 
explained by the worst of all possible

May 3, 2022 
reasons: We got rolled by the special 
interests, 
the 
fossil 
fuel 
industry, 
whose conflict of interest is apparent 
but whose power through dark money 
and pressure and corruption in this 
body has disabled us for more than a 
decade 
from 
doing 
what 
everyone 
knows is right. 
Our failure and the disgraceful rea-
son for it will be a visible blot on 
America’s standing for decades if we 
don’t act. If we don’t act, if we fail, 
don’t think no one will notice. What we 
are doing is open and notorious, and it 
is a devastating failure of American 
leadership. 
We must pass a real climate bill now. 
It is time, as I have said 283 times, to 
wake up. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
S.J. RES. 39 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, as I men-
tioned earlier today on the floor, Presi-
dent Biden has apparently decided that 
COVID is over at our southern border 
but not, apparently, for American tod-
dlers. 
While a court injunction has barred 
enforcement in a number of States, the 
Department of Health and Human 
Services has still not repealed its mask 
and vaccine mandate for Head Start 
Programs—a mandate that requires 
children as young as 2 years old to 
wear masks indoors and, incredibly, 
outside. 
The scientific evidence for masking 
toddlers is shaky at best. The World 
Health Organization does not rec-
ommend masking for children under 5. 
The concerns about the effect on 
speech and children’s development are 
real. But none of that seems to matter 
to the administration. 
Despite the low danger of serious ill-
ness in children, apparently the Biden 
administration believes that toddlers 
should be masked in perpetuity—a po-
sition Secretary Becerra doubled down 
on in front of the Senate Finance Com-
mittee last month. 
If the Biden administration isn’t 
going to repeal its toddler mask man-
date, it is time for Congress to step in 
and do it for them. The resolution of 
disapproval that I have introduced and 
which we are voting on in the next few 
minutes would end the administra-
tion’s mandate, and I urge all of my 
colleagues to join me in voting for this 
resolution. It is past time to call a halt 
to the Biden administration’s outdated 
and unscientific mandate and ensure 
that our toddlers can run around the 
playground mask-free. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
S.J. RES. 39 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, what 
we are about to vote on is just another 
distraction while Republicans are tak-
ing away abortion rights. 
I want to be clear: This coming vote 
is about more than just masks. The 
Congressional Review Act resolution 
could have hugely consequential and 
potentially damaging effects not just 
for the current pandemic but for the 
future as well. 
Young children getting an early edu-
cation through our Head Start Pro-
gram are the only age group that can-
not yet be vaccinated against COVID– 
19. That means parents of children 
under 5 are in a really difficult position 
right now. They don’t have the choice 
to vaccinate their children. So they are 
dependent on the adults who care for 
them to do everything they can to con-
tinue protecting them. 
But Senator THUNE’s resolution fails 
to take into consideration the concerns 
of parents with young children, and I 
don’t just mean masks. This resolution 
would also take away a tool for Head 
Start programs to ensure that adults 
are vaccinated when caring for kids 
who cannot get vaccinated themselves. 
Now, once our youngest children can 
get fully vaccinated, it probably makes 
sense to revisit some of these require-
ments, but we are not there yet—some-
thing I know so many parents are wor-
ried about and frustrated by. Right 
now, we need to do everything we can 
to protect our children and give par-
ents some peace of mind. 
We also need to think about the dan-
gerous repercussions this CRA could 
have in the future. This resolution 
would prevent HHS from implementing 
critical public health practices that 
keep our kids safe in the future. Enact-
ing a CRA permanently constrains an 
Agency’s ability to regulate again in 
that space, and I cannot overstate how 
serious such a step would be. What if 
there is a new threat but we can’t im-
plement the necessary public health 
measures which we know can keep kids 
safe because they have been blocked by 
the CRA? 
We need to make sure that HHS and 
the Head Start Program can protect 
our most vulnerable children in case 
there is a new, more dangerous variant 
or even a new pandemic threat. Mr. 
President, when you get in from the 
rain, you may put your umbrella away, 
but you don’t throw it out. And when it 
comes to this pandemic, some of us are 
safely inside; but for the young kids 
who cannot yet get vaccinated, they 
are still out in the storm, and their 
parents are still counting on having 
that umbrella. And when it comes to 
the future, there could be other rainy 
days. So let’s not throw away this im-
portant tool to keep our kids safe. 
I urge my colleagues to vote no. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the clerk will read 
the joint resolution for the third time. 
The joint resolution was ordered to 
be engrossed for a third reading and 
was read the third time. 
Mr. THUNE. I ask for the yeas and 
nays. 
VOTE ON S.J. RES. 39 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The joint 
resolution having been read the third 
time, the question is, Shall the joint 
resolution pass? 
The yeas and nays have been re-
quested. 
Is there a sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond. 
The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
called the roll.

UKRAINE 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I 
come to the Senate floor today once 
again to talk about what is happening 
in Ukraine. This is the 10th time in the 
10 weeks of session since before the in-
vasion started that I have come to the 
floor to talk about the atrocities being 
committed in Ukraine by this brutal 
and unprovoked invasion from Russia 
and to talk about more effective ways 
for us to help the Ukrainian people. 
I just spoke to the Ukrainian Ambas-
sador to the United States, Oksana 
Markarova. She started by thanking 
me on behalf of the Ukrainian people— 
really, thanking the American people— 
and saying that they appreciate all of 
the help, not just the funding and the 
weapons but the moral support that 
the people of Ukraine feel from the 
people of the United States of America. 
That made me proud. 
She also talked about the desperate 
need right now to provide Ukrainian 
soldiers with the heavy weapons they 
need to confront the new fight in 
Ukraine—the need to confront Russia 
as Vladimir Putin continues his brutal 
campaign to kill Ukrainian citizens, to 
flatten Ukrainian cities. 
Just today, Lviv, which is way over 
here in western Ukraine, was attacked 
again. So Russia says they are going to 
focus over here. Once again, they are 
lobbing missiles into Lviv. Once again, 
they have attacked Odesa in the south, 
hoping, I suppose, to flatten Odesa as 
well as they have done with Mariupol 
and kill there somewhere between 20 
and 25,000 innocent civilians, according 
to the latest reports we have. 
Ukraine has been an independent and 
sovereign country since 1991. They are 
not part of Russia. In 2014, the people 
of Ukraine made a very conscious 
choice to turn to the West, to get out 
from under the Russian thumb alto-
gether. They wanted freedom and de-
mocracy, to move away from tyranny 
and corruption. They wanted to be like 
us here in America. That is one reason 
so much of the free world has rallied 
around Ukraine—because this is about 
a country that is seeking freedom, free 
enterprise, the ability to gather freely, 
free speech. 
I was an election observer here in 
2014 right after they made this deci-
sion, and we saw a fair election, where 
a President was elected by the people 
with huge voter turnout. Again, that is 
one reason we feel this connection to 
Ukraine, as does the rest of the free 
world. 
Ukraine’s armed forces continue to 
perform well, but as this map shows, 
the fight is fierce right now. The dark 
red here is Ukrainian territory that 
was taken by Russia back in 2014. This 
includes Crimea. It includes Donetsk, 
Luhansk. 
The 
lighter 
red 
is 
the 
Ukrainian territory that Russia has 
seized during this latest invasion dur-
ing this war. And the light-blue area is 
where Ukrainian troops have effec-
tively countered the Russian offensives 
and pushed Russian forces out of terri-
tory. 
Ukraine won a decisive battle here, 
as an example, in Kyiv. You can see 
where they pushed the Russian forces 
out. 
The Kremlin, at that time, had as a 
strategic objective, seizing Kyiv, which 
is the capital of Ukraine, and also 
other major cities all around the coun-
try. They wanted to force the govern-
ment—the democratically elected gov-
ernment—out to overthrow the govern-
ment of President Zelenskyy. 
Instead, because of effective Ukrain-
ian resistance, Russia has been forced 
to settle for these more limited objec-
tives, even as they continue to bomb 
cities all around Ukraine. 
They now want to consolidate the 
Donbas region and create a land bridge 
from Crimea up to Transnistria. They 
want to cut off one of the world’s 
greatest exporters—Ukraine—from any 
access to the city, to make them land-
locked so they cannot have an effective 
economy. 
Our goal must be to stop Russia from 
achieving its invasion goals and push 
them out of the territory of this free 
and independent country, Ukraine, our 
ally. This is a very dangerous point in 
this battle. 
While the Russians have made incre-
mental gains in the east, they have not 
achieved the decisive breakthrough 
that they want, thanks to the tough-
ness and tenacity of the Ukrainian 
forces. But it is a tough fight, and the 
Ukrainians are outgunned. We must do 
all we can to keep Russia from a break-
through until heavier weapons pledged 
by the United States and other allied 
nations can reinforce Ukrainian posi-
tions—our howitzers, as an example. 
Artillery is starting to arrive but only 
starting. 
My hope is that by reinforcing 
Ukrainian positions with these heavier 
weapons, that will allow Ukraine not 
just to defend itself but to be able to 
roll back this Russian invasion and re-
claim this territory. 
Late last week, I was pleased that 
the Biden administration formerly re-
quested emergency supplemental fund-
ing that will provide needed military, 
humanitarian, and economic aid for 
Ukraine. This proposal, by the way, in-
cludes $6 billion for the Ukraine Secu-
rity Assistance Initiative—a bipartisan 
initiative I have long spearheaded. 
Funding for this initiative is used to 
train, equip, and provide support for 
the Ukrainian Government and mili-
tary. It was crucial to helping Ukraine 
prepare for the current fight, and it is 
crucial now. 
As the President has requested, there 
is also drawdown authority in this leg-
islation. Now, that is what the Presi-
dent is currently using to provide the 
howitzers I talked about and other 
military assistance. There is $5 billion 
of additional Presidential drawdown 
authority in this request. 
The existing Presidential drawdown 
authority has been expended. I just 
checked with the Ambassador again 
just before making this speech. She in-
dicates that out of the $3.3 billion that 
was in the previous Presidential draw-
down authority to provide weapons to 
Ukraine, there is roughly $150 million 
left. In other words, they need this sup-
plemental spending package now. It 
cannot wait, not at this crucial time in 
the battle. 
I am encouraged by the administra-
tion’s request for military assistance 
because I think—assuming we approve 
it and get this done quickly—it will 
send a very important message to the 
world and, most importantly, to Vladi-
mir Putin, that America is in this fight 
for the long haul. 
The humanitarian aid is also des-
perately needed to complement the re-
markable work that is being done in 
Ukraine by so many great religious and 
nonprofit groups. Some of you know 
Samaritan’s Purse, as an example. 
Last night, Jose Andres, who is the 
founder of what is called the World 
Central Kitchen, told me that they 
have now provided 18 million meals to 
Ukrainian refugees both in-country 
and out of country, and they have 
12,000 volunteers that have been en-
gaged to do this. They are not asking 
for money from American taxpayers, 
but they are providing incredible help, 
so many of these great groups. 
I am also encouraged that the admin-
istration heeded our bipartisan calls 
and appointed a Ukraine military as-
sistance coordinator, LTG Terry Wolff. 
This followed a letter that I sent with 
Senators SHAHEEN, WICKER, and DUR-
BIN, with the goal of cutting through 
the redtape to ensure the right weap-
ons get to Ukraine and they get there 
quickly. 
When I asked Secretary Blinken last 
week who Lieutenant General Wolff 
would be reporting to as the coordi-
nator of the military assistance in 
order to make this whole process work 
more smoothly and help the Ukrain-
ians more, he was uncertain. 
I will state today that I hope that the 
coordinator, Lieutenant General Wolff, 
will be reporting directly to the Com-
mander in Chief. Why? Because there 
are so many Agencies and Departments 
involved, and the whole idea is to have 
one person who has the President’s ear 
who is able to get stuff done quickly, 
without the bureaucracy. And I know 
President Biden believes that we ought 
to get this military equipment and 
other assistance to Ukraine imme-
diately. 
In the context of this significant ad-
ditional funding request for Ukraine to 
be able to defend itself, it is important 
to note that they are not just relying 
on us. We are not the only country pro-
viding military assistance to Ukraine.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2267 
May 3, 2022 
In the past few weeks, we have seen 
allies and nations in Europe and 
around the world come together and in-
crease their military aid, and I com-
mend them for that. 
Last Thursday, after weeks of debate, 
I was very pleased to see that the Ger-
man Bundestag, which is their Par-
liament, 
voted 
overwhelmingly 
in 
favor—586 to 100—of sending heavy 
weapons to Ukraine. This is a break-
through for Germany. They have now 
woken up to the serious threat that 
Russia poses to European security, and 
the Germans are now assuming more 
responsibility for defense of their own 
backyard. Good for them. We need 
them. 
Additionally, the Polish Government 
has now transferred even more Soviet- 
era T–72 tanks to Ukraine—again, 
heavy equipment they need in the 
Donbas. 
Slovakia has sent S–300 air defense 
systems. Our great allies in the United 
Kingdom have been tremendous sup-
porters of Ukraine since before the in-
vasion, including sending anti-tank 
and anti-air weapons that have been 
used to devastating effect on the bat-
tlefield. They have sent humanitarian 
aid and have recently sent Saxon ar-
mored vehicles. 
The Netherlands have also been very 
helpful by sending Stinger anti-air 
missiles that help Ukraine contest the 
sky against Russian superior air power. 
Turkey has provided armed drones 
that have proven deadly effective at 
neutralizing Russian tanks, vehicles, 
and surface ships. I commend Turkey 
for that. 
Even on the other side of the globe, 
democracies are stepping up and pro-
viding military aid to Ukraine, includ-
ing Bushmaster armored vehicles from 
Australia, 
bulletproof 
vests 
from 
Japan, and other military equipment 
from South Korea. 
The list of those countries that are 
providing lethal assistance or humani-
tarian aid is now over 40 and grows 
every day as freedom-loving nations 
everywhere see what is happening here. 
They see President Putin’s actions for 
what they are—an assault on freedom 
and democracy, a brutal assault. 
Again, the next few weeks could be a 
tipping point. But Ukraine is finally 
starting to get the necessary weaponry 
from the free world to have a chance to 
actually succeed in pushing Russia out 
of their territory. 
The new Ukraine funding bill is being 
scrubbed right now for issues or prob-
lems, which is appropriate. We want to 
be sure, as an example, that the direct 
economic support has the anti-corrup-
tion guardrails we have had in it in the 
past. The Department of Agriculture 
funding has to be scrubbed to ensure it 
actually helps Ukraine. But the scrub-
bing has been going on for almost a 
week now. It is time for us to move 
this legislation. 
I encourage the Senate Democratic 
leadership to bring to the floor this 
Ukraine funding bill this week, not 
combined with other measures but as a 
stand-alone piece of legislation not 
tied to COVID funding or other unre-
lated priorities, including title 42 and 
the border, which I feel strongly about, 
or other issues, including issues to do 
with Afghanistan and the parolees. 
Let’s keep other issues off of this leg-
islation. Why? Because otherwise it be-
comes a political football and will be 
impossible to pass quickly. 
We have time to deal with those 
other issues as well, and we should. But 
our allies in Ukraine are desperate for 
assistance, and they need it now at this 
crucial time in this battle. Adding 
other politically charged issues to this 
request will slow it down and delay the 
lethal aid, and in the end will cost the 
lives of Ukrainian soldiers and civil-
ians at the hands of the ruthless Rus-
sian attacks. 
On the sanctions front, I am pleased 
that this past week, the administration 
is finally saying they will move for-
ward in seizing, not just freezing, Rus-
sian assets in the United States. 
Last Thursday, the administration 
announced a streamline process for 
seizing assets and finding a legal way 
to repurpose those assets to help the 
Ukrainian people. Good for them. I 
have called for this in legislation I in-
troduced 5 weeks ago with Senator 
BENNET of Colorado. Our RELIEF Act 
would ensure seized Russian funds go 
to support the humanitarian needs in 
Ukraine, which is just and appropriate. 
And, by the way, other countries have 
already done this. 
The Russians continue to commit 
war crimes and atrocities against the 
innocent people of Ukraine. Late last 
week, 
Ukrainian 
authorities 
filed 
criminal charges against 10 individual 
Russian soldiers accused of taking ci-
vilians hostage and torturing them in 
the Kyiv suburb of Bucha. Many of you 
have seen the videos. This is the first 
such move by prosecutors investigating 
possible war crimes by Russians. 
All 10 were noncommissioned officers 
and privates from Russia’s 64th Sepa-
rate Guards Motor Rifle Brigade, one of 
the units that took part in the 
monthlong occupation of Bucha. 
I call on the International Criminal 
Court that has announced an investiga-
tion to follow in Ukraine’s footsteps 
and immediately begin an actual war 
crimes tribunal. The evidence of war 
crimes is clear, and there should be no 
delay. By holding Russians accountable 
now, the hope is there will be some de-
terrent effect to avoid additional war 
crimes being created. 
Last week, Secretary Blinken, in his 
testimony before the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee on the new budg-
et request, talked about the request for 
additional funding of $5 million for 
what is called the Global Engagement 
Center. This is an organization that 
Senator MURPHY of Connecticut and I 
cofounded with legislation to combat 
disinformation abroad. Unfortunately, 
this very modest increase will not ade-
quately 
address 
the 
massive 
disinformation efforts by the Kremlin, 
let alone the world. 
In this hybrid war in Ukraine, it is 
not just about kinetic military action; 
it 
is 
also 
about 
a 
massive 
disinformation campaign. They are 
bombarding 
Ukraine 
with 
disinformation 
that 
must 
be 
con-
fronted. 
The Global Engagement Center is es-
tablished to do just that. Unfortu-
nately, it has been 2 years since there 
was a coordinator appointed by a Presi-
dent to lead this Global Engagement 
Center. This gap in leadership is unac-
ceptable, and I urge the President to 
immediately appoint a person to this 
role. 
The efforts we talked about tonight 
so far—the heavy weapons, the security 
assistance, the prosecution of war 
crimes, and the seizing rather than 
freezing of Russian assets—are all steps 
in the right direction. However, further 
steps have to be taken if we are going 
to stop the Kremlin from being able to 
finance this war effort. 
The biggest problem, by far, is en-
ergy. Energy is Russia’s No. 1 export. 
Forty to 50 percent of the Russian 
budget is funded by energy receipts 
coming back into the country. Presi-
dent Putin, of course, has long used 
natural gas as an energy weapon 
against Europe. Last week, he directed 
the gas company Gazprom to stop pro-
viding natural gas to Poland and to 
Bulgaria. The natural gas supply from 
Russia was suspended because of Po-
land and Bulgaria’s refusal to pay in 
rubles, Russia’s currency, which would 
help bolster Russia’s economy and 
make it easier for them to finance this 
war. Bulgaria and Poland should be 
commended for not bowing to Vladimir 
Putin’s wishes. 
This is also a significant opportunity 
for the United States to step up further 
and to help our European allies to 
wean themselves off of Russian energy. 
The United States of America has the 
tools and the resources to help our al-
lies accomplish this. We have a ten-
tative agreement to do so. The United 
States has already halted the import of 
Russian energy. I now commend Lith-
uania and Estonia for recently doing 
the exact same thing. Poland has indi-
cated they would like to do the same. 
In order to encourage Europe to end 
its dependency on Russian oil and gas, 
America must act now to help ensure 
there is a more abundant supply of en-
ergy resources on the global market for 
purchase by Europe and other coun-
tries. Specifically, we need to expand 
U.S. production of natural gas that will 
help stabilize the market, provide liq-
uefied natural gas to Europe, and re-
duce energy costs for consumers. Most 
importantly, it will stop the flow of 
funding to Russia’s war machine that 
is killing innocent Ukrainians every 
single day. 
Together, working with Europe, we 
can end the approximately $870 million 
a day—$870 million a day—that Europe 
is sending to Russia to help fund the

war machine. We must do so imme-
diately by expanding natural gas pro-
duction here and our infrastructure 
here to provide Europe with the prom-
ised liquefied natural gas as an alter-
native to Russian gas. 
But, more generally, we have to sup-
port all our domestic producers here in 
the United States through a robust, 
all-of-the-above energy policy that in-
cludes fossil fuels, renewables, carbon- 
capture technologies, nuclear power, 
hydropower, hydrogen, and energy effi-
ciency. 
Instead of recognizing that Putin is 
using energy as a weapon and respond-
ing appropriately, unfortunately, the 
Biden administration has acted to 
make it more difficult for domestic en-
ergy production. These actions include 
an increase of taxes on energy produc-
tion proposed in the President’s budg-
et, restricting new leases on Federal 
lands and waters for oil and gas pro-
duction, rewriting the definitions of 
the ‘‘Waters of the United States’’—or 
WOTUS, as it is called—which could 
add significant time and complexity to 
permitting new energy projects. 
As I raised directly with Secretary 
Blinken last week during his time be-
fore the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee, these domestic policies 
that the administration is pursuing are 
having a direct and negative impact on 
our national security and the security 
of our allies abroad. We need to 
produce more right now to be able to 
ensure our national security and their 
national security is protected. 
The ruble, the Russian currency, has 
just about fully recovered from its 
preinvasion value, in part because Rus-
sia is still bringing in revenues from 
the sale of energy. Our sanctions have 
left Russia’s biggest economic lifeline 
largely untouched: again, energy sales, 
specifically to Europe. 
In addition to cutting off natural gas 
and the revenue that fuels the Russian 
war machine, we need to tighten up 
bank sanctions as they relate to en-
ergy. Sanctions for energy transactions 
don’t go into effect against Russian 
banks, including the VTB Bank, until 
June 24. These sanctions should have 
gone in place weeks ago, and they 
should certainly go into place now. 
President Biden must lead our allies 
to do whatever it takes to help Ukraine 
win, and the administration should 
make clear that their objective is for 
Ukraine to push the forces of Russia 
out 
of 
the 
sovereign 
territory 
of 
Ukraine. Remember, Ukrainians are 
not asking for us to fight for them, but 
they are asking us to help them fight 
for themselves. We have got to do that 
so they have a chance to win. 
Last month, I was at the border of 
Ukraine and Poland, and I was able to 
talk to a number of Ukrainian refu-
gees. Through their tears, they spoke 
of their homes being destroyed, their 
loved ones killed, and the pain of being 
separated from their husbands and fa-
thers who had stayed behind to fight. 
Almost every refugee was either a 
woman or a child, grandparents with 
their grandchildren. 
I also saw the heroic efforts and the 
amazing generosity of spirit from the 
Polish people who were taking these 
Ukrainian refugees literally into their 
homes—to feed them, to give them a 
roof over their head. 
Yesterday, I joined my colleagues 
CHRIS
COONS
and ROY
BLUNT
intro-
ducing a resolution to commend and 
recognize 
Poland’s 
efforts 
in 
wel-
coming Ukrainian refugees and sup-
porting the Ukrainian resistance. Po-
land has been amazing. Since Russia’s 
invasion began, more than 3 million 
Ukrainians have fled across the border 
into Poland. We are so grateful to them 
for opening their hearts and their 
homes and for continuing to donate 
their time and resources to help the 
refugees. 
I want to close my remarks today 
with talking about why the United 
States has a special obligation to sup-
port Ukraine in light of Russia’s brutal 
and illegal invasion. It is important 
that we not forget the Budapest Memo-
randum signed by Russia, the United 
States, 
the 
United 
Kingdom, 
and 
Ukraine in 1994. After the fall of the 
Soviet Union, under this 1994 memo-
randum, a newly independent Ukraine 
agreed to give up its nuclear weapons, 
but they did so in return for an iron-
clad commitment from all those sig-
natories—the United States, the UK, 
and Russia—to respect and ensure 
Ukraine’s 
territorial 
integrity 
and 
independence. 
This is what makes Russia’s invasion 
and veiled threats of nuclear weapons 
particularly outrageous. Russia made a 
commitment to respect Ukraine’s ter-
ritorial integrity and independence in 
exchange for Ukraine giving up its nu-
clear weapons. Now Russia invaded 
Ukraine and is threatening to use nu-
clear weapons against Ukrainians. 
This war is in gross violation of the 
Budapest Memorandum and, of course, 
Russia’s other international commit-
ments, such as the United Nations 
Charter. For these transgressions, it is 
now time for the international commu-
nity to strip Russia of its privilege of 
sitting on the U.N. Security Council 
and other bodies of international rep-
resentation, 
and 
Russia 
should 
be 
deemed a state sponsor of terror. 
There is reporting that Russia be-
lieved the invasion would split and 
weaken the NATO alliance. Instead, as 
we have seen, Russia’s brutal attacks 
on a neighboring democracy have actu-
ally galvanized and strengthened the 
resolve of NATO and the free world in 
general and will likely lead to expan-
sion with Finland and Sweden soon 
joining the NATO alliance. 
What the United States is doing to 
help Ukraine with military, humani-
tarian, and economic assistance and 
rallying our allies to do the same is 
critically important, particularly at 
this time, for the battle is at a critical 
stage. It is critically important—it is 
important not just because it fulfills 
our commitment under the 1994 Buda-
pest Memorandum but because it is in 
our national interest as the leader of 
the free world to stand with our allies. 
There was a speech once written that 
was never given. It was meant to be de-
livered by President John F. Kennedy 
on the afternoon of November 22, 1963, 
the day that he was killed. The speech 
was profound and very simple. It said: 
We, in this country, in this generation, 
by destiny rather than choice, are the 
watchmen on the walls of world free-
dom—by destiny rather than choice. 
When democracies are under attack 
by authoritarian regimes, history says 
when America leads, others will join, 
and we are victorious in protecting 
freedom. 
In this instance, in this critical point 
in Ukraine, we must continue to lead 
the 
free 
world 
in 
standing 
with 
Ukraine until their final victory. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
UNIONS 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I appre-
ciate being recognized. 
I want to start with a short little 
story. A month after—well, maybe 2 
weeks after—President Biden took of-
fice, I was invited as the new chair of 
a major Senate Committee, the Senate 
Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs 
Committee. I think the Presiding Offi-
cer was there that day, too. We met in 
the Oval Office with the President of 
the United States. 
We sat in a semicircle, and I saw that 
the painting behind President Biden 
was of Franklin Roosevelt. He was sur-
rounded by busts of Harry Truman, 
Rosa Parks, Dr. King, Cesar Chavez, 
and Robert Kennedy. He asked us to go 
around the room and tell what inter-
ests us, what kind of things we should 
be doing. 
When it was my turn, I talked about 
the Protecting the Right to Organize 
Act, and I talked about the child tax 
credit, which, after we passed it, it was 
a $3,000 tax cut to 92 percent of the 
families in my State and a similar per-
cent in the Presiding Officer’s State of 
Michigan. Families with children re-
ceived a $3,000 tax cut, the biggest in 
American history. 
I spoke about housing, and then I 
said, at the end of my little minute and 
a half: Mr. President, thank you for 
talking about unions. 
He kind of smiled and said: Of course. 
When the meeting was over, after 45 
minutes or so, the President walked to-
ward me and said: Why wouldn’t I men-
tion unions? 
I said: Mr. President, I have been in 
this office a number of times over the 
last 25 years, and I have never heard a 
President talk about the unions the 
way you do. 
That was the beginning. We then 
passed the recovery act and have done 
so much more with the bipartisan in-
frastructure bill. 
He has always put the emphasis on 
workers, putting workers at the center

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2269 
May 3, 2022 
of our economic policy and workers at 
the center of our country and at the 
center of our economy. 
Let me illustrate. In the last 2 
weeks—I know that Senator HASSAN, 
who is about to preside today, when she 
went back to New Hampshire during 
these 2 weeks, she was talking to fami-
lies and workers, and Senator PETERS, 
who is presiding, from Michigan, did 
the same—what struck me is that we 
had four sort of Cabinet-level people 
from the Biden administration who 
came to Ohio during these couple of 
weeks. I was with three of them. With 
one of them, we couldn’t work out 
schedules. 
The head of the EPA was in Ohio. Do 
you know what he talked about? He 
talked about how we replace—Ohio, un-
fortunately, is No. 2 in the country in 
the number of contaminated pipes con-
necting main water lines going into 
people’s homes, contaminated with 
lead. We are, because of the bipartisan 
infrastructure bill, going to replace 
those 600,000 pipes. We are going to re-
place them with U.S., Made-in-America 
iron and steel and other components, 
because in infrastructure, we passed 
the strongest—and Senator HASSAN 
was part of this and others. We passed 
the strongest ‘‘Buy America’’ provi-
sions ever in American history. If you 
are going to spend American tax dol-
lars, you are going to hire American 
workers to do that. 
Administrator Regan of the EPA 
talked about what that means. It 
means thousands of jobs for pipefitters 
and other union trades people. It also 
means 
clean 
water 
going 
into 
moderate- and low-income families’ 
homes in Appalachia and East Cleve-
land and everywhere in between. And 
that means healthier children. 
Then the Secretary of the Depart-
ment of Labor came. The Department 
of Labor Secretary with President 
Biden’s predecessor was essentially a 
corporate lawyer. I would use the 
word—this might sound disrespectful, 
and I apologize ahead of time—a hack. 
Fundamentally, he was a guy who 
spent his career making, I assume, mil-
lions of dollars a year working for a 
prestigious law firm, busting unions, 
and always siding with employers and 
with big corporations against workers. 
That was the predecessor. 
The Secretary of Labor under Presi-
dent Biden came out of Boston. He was 
a former laborer. He was a former 
union laborer. Make that contrast. 
Then I spent part of the time in Lake-
wood, a Cleveland suburb—in the city 
of Cleveland and in Lakewood—and 
then Fremont, OH, with the new Chair 
of the Export-Import Bank, talking 
about jobs, talking about workers, 
talking about getting help competing 
with the Chinese, with the Export-Im-
port Bank, always with an emphasis on 
wages. 
We know what has happened the last 
50 years. I went to high school and 
walked the halls of Mansfield Senior 
High School and Johnny Appleseed 
Junior High School with the sons and 
daughters of machinists who worked at 
Ohio Brass, of electrical workers who 
worked 
at 
Westinghouse, 
of 
auto-
workers who worked at GM, of rubber 
workers who worked at Mansfield Tire, 
and with the sons and daughters of la-
borers and operating engineers, mill-
wrights, carpenters, pipefitters, paint-
ers, and electricians—all making mid-
dle-class union wages that really built 
a decent economy for tens of thousands 
of families in my community. 
I know what that meant, and then we 
saw corporate leaders: First they shut 
down production in places like Mans-
field, my hometown, or Springfield or 
Toledo. They moved to Alabama or 
Tennessee or Arkansas—low wages, few 
unions, 
weak 
unemployment 
com-
pensation, sort of inadequate unem-
ployment workers’ compensation pro-
grams for injured and unemployed 
workers. 
But those wages weren’t low enough. 
So these same corporate leaders went 
on a scavenger hunt to Mexico and 
China—all over the world—to try to 
find the cheapest labor possible. 
And do you know what? Far too 
many Presidents and far too many peo-
ple in this body helped them do that. 
That is why this President is so impor-
tant and why this Senate is so impor-
tant—that we can fight back. 
We are seeing now that the whole 
idea of this administration is to begin 
to bring these jobs back home and 
treat these workers with respect and 
begin, again, to rebuild the middle 
class. 
The last Cabinet Secretary to come 
in who I spent a full day with was in 
Chillicothe, OH, in southern Ohio. It is 
a 
small 
community 
hurt 
by 
globalization. There is a VA hospital. 
It is one of the oldest VA hospitals in 
the country. And these workers—there 
was a Commission started by President 
Trump that is slating the closure of 
the Chillicothe VA. 
Today, 
Presiding 
Officer 
Senator 
HASSAN and I were in the Veterans’ 
Committee asking about workers— 
with Senator TESTER
presiding and 
Senator BOOZMAN, a good bipartisan 
team on Veterans’ Affairs—what do we 
do to make sure these workers are 
whole, that we train workers, that they 
are not burning out by all the tension 
and the pressure and the anxiety they 
face now? 
In 
sitting 
with 
Secretary 
Denis 
McDonough, the new Secretary of the 
VA, the Biden Secretary of the VA, it 
was a pleasure watching him interact 
with these workers, interacting with 
Jessica Fee, who is the union presi-
dent, at Chillicothe, the American Fed-
eration 
of 
Government 
Employees. 
President Kelley, the international 
president, was there. Ms. Simon, his as-
sistant, was there, listening to these 
workers, listening to what do we do to 
train enough LPNs, licensed practical 
nurses? What do we do to train enough 
nurses? What do we do to train enough 
physical therapists? And how do we 
keep this hospital open? Because so 
many veterans care so deeply about 
this hospital. 
So the last 2 weeks what motivates 
me in this job is my job really, in so 
many ways, is how do you speak for 
those who don’t have a voice? How do 
you fight for those—it is always whom 
you fight for and what you fight 
against. I am not interested in oppos-
ing Senator MCCONNELL
because he 
blocks a whole bunch of stuff that we 
care about. I am not interested in op-
posing him; I am interested in fighting 
against some of the things he does. 
But I am interested in fighting for 
these workers at the VA. I am inter-
ested in fighting for these pipefitters 
who are going to lay these clean pipes 
without lead contamination, making 
these children in Appalachian Ohio, in 
East Cleveland, in East Columbus, 
OH—making them more whole. I am in-
terested in helping these workers who 
DOL finally sides with instead of siding 
with corporate interest. 
During these 2 weeks, I went to a 
Starbucks in Columbus, and these 
workers are trying to organize a union. 
They know that carrying a union 
card—carrying a union card means bet-
ter wages; it means better benefits; it 
means more control over your work 
schedule. Of course, Starbucks is fight-
ing the union, but finally we have a 
government that is helping these small 
businesses export more. And we have a 
government that is going to finally 
side with veterans and side with work-
ers at VA hospitals. 
The last 2 weeks is—and for me it has 
been a celebration, as Studs Terkel 
said in an introduction of a book 
called, ‘‘Christ in Concrete,’’ a book 
written in the late 1930s about an im-
migrant worker. It came out the same 
week as ‘‘Grapes of Wrath,’’ and, inter-
estingly, it was chosen over ‘‘Grapes of 
Wrath’’ 
for 
the 
Book-of-the-Month 
Club, even though ‘‘Grapes of Wrath’’ 
had a little bit more staying power. 
But Studs Terkel talked in his intro-
duction 
about 
celebrating 
the 
uncelebrated, and that is really what 
we should be doing here. You celebrate 
those workers. It is not the corpora-
tions; it is not the President; it is not 
the big shots; it is really the workers 
who power this economy, the workers 
who make the VA work, the workers 
who will lay those pipes, the workers 
who are the small business people suc-
ceeding and competing with China in 
countries around the world, the work-
ers at the VA. 
That is what the last 2 weeks for me 
was about. It is why the honor of hav-
ing this job and fighting for these 
workers gets me up every day. 
I yield the floor.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO RACHEL FELDMAN 
∑ Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, 
I would like to take the opportunity to 
express my appreciation to Rachel for 
her hard work as an intern in my 
Washington, DC, office. I recognize her 
efforts and contributions to my office, 
as well as to the State of Wyoming. 
Rachel is a native of California. She 
is a student at UC Berkeley, where she 
is studying political science and legal 
studies. She has demonstrated a strong 
work ethic, which has made her an in-
valuable asset to our office. The qual-
ity of her work is reflected in her great 
efforts over the last several months. 
I want to thank Rachel for the dedi-
cation she has shown while working for 
me and my staff. It is a pleasure to

75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
MEMORIAL BAPTIST CHURCH 
∑ Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I rise 
today to honor the 75th anniversary of 
the Memorial Baptist Church of Arling-
ton, VA, for faithful ministry and serv-
ice to Arlington and the greater Wash-
ington, DC area. For decades, they 
have lived up to their covenant to en-
gage in Christian care for each other, 
through bible study and dedicated 
work for the advancement of Christi-
anity. 
Memorial Baptist Church’s first pub-
lic service was held on Easter Sunday, 
April 6, 1947, at the old Glebe Theater 
near what is now Langston Boulevard. 
Memorial Baptist was officially orga-
nized on April 28, 1947, less than a 
month after its first service, with Rev-
erend James Farmer becoming the 
church’s first pastor. One year later, on 
April 28, 1948, they celebrated the 
groundbreaking 
of 
their 
chapel, 
a 
building that is still the center of the 
church today. Since construction fin-
ished in 1949, locals from all over the 
area have come to worship and be a 
part of their congregation. 
Since Memorial Baptist’s inception, 
they have been a catalyst of commu-
nity engagement, worship, and service. 
Along with being a center for Christian 
prayer and values, they have brought 
people together in weekly bible stud-
ies, adult classes, and family picnics. 
Memorial Baptist Church also has a 
long history of faithful ministry and 
service to the Arlington community 
and around the world, including mis-
sion 
partnerships 
in 
Kentucky, 
Ukraine, and India. 
Memorial Baptist Church has forged 
75 years of history and tradition for the 
local community. Memorial Baptist 
Church will continue to minister and 
serve in the name of Christ with a vari-
ety of services, programs, and activi-
ties in anticipation of a bright and pro-
ductive future.∑

RECOGNIZING POPPY AND POUT 
∑ Mr. RISCH. Madam President, Idaho 
small businesses have shown immense 
resilience in the face of labor short-
ages, supply chain disruptions, and ris-
ing costs. These small businesses de-
serve to be celebrated for their great 
work in preserving the values unique 
to our communities. I am proud to re-
launch Support Local Gems, a state-
wide initiative, on May 6, to encourage 
Idahoans to support the small busi-
nesses that make the Gem State spe-
cial. As a member and former chairman 
of the Senate Committee on Small 
Business and Entrepreneurship, I am 
pleased to honor Poppy and Pout lo-
cated in Idaho Falls as one of Idaho’s 
Small Businesses of the Month for May 
2022. 
In 2014, Derek Cooper founded Poppy 
and Pout and began to sell his unique, 
untinted lip balm out of his kitchen 
while studying at Brigham Young Uni-
versity-Idaho. Aware of the growing 
environmentally 
conscious 
market, 
Derek created a 100-percent recyclable 
cardboard tube and packaging for his 
product. Since then, Poppy and Pout’s 
business has taken off and garnered na-
tional recognition, including Oprah 
Winfrey adding the company to her 
most recent ‘‘Favorite Things List.’’ 
To keep up with their growing local 
and national following, Derek opened a 
brick-and-mortar store and production 
facility in downtown Idaho Falls in 
July 2021. The boutique features a vari-
ety of his signature, hand-made lip 
balm, as well as clothing, gifts, and 
other beauty products. Today, Poppy 
and Pout’s 40 employees supply their 
all-natural lip balm to boutiques, sa-
lons, and stores worldwide, giving ev-
eryone a little taste of Idaho. 
Congratulations to Derek Cooper and 
all of the employees at Poppy and Pout 
for being selected as an Idaho Small 
Business of the Month for May 2022. 
You are an outstanding example of 
what it means to be one of Idaho’s 
Local Gems. You make our great State 
proud, and I look forward to your con-
tinued growth and success.∑

RECOGNIZING TWIN FALLS SAND-
WICH 
COMPANY 
AND 
KOTO 
BREWING COMPANY 
∑ Mr. RISCH. Madam President, Idaho 
small businesses have shown immense 
resilience in the face of labor short-
ages, supply chain disruptions, and ris-
ing costs. These small businesses de-
serve to be celebrated for their great 
work in preserving the values unique 
to our communities. I am proud to re-
launch Support Local Gems, a state-
wide initiative, on May 6, to encourage 
Idahoans to support the small busi-
nesses that make the Gem State spe-

of the Senate Committee on Small 
Business and Entrepreneurship, I am 
pleased to honor Twin Falls Sandwich 
Company and Koto Brewing Company 
located in Twin Falls as one of Idaho’s 
Small Businesses of the Month for May 
2022. 
Fifteen years ago, Twin Falls Sand-
wich Company owner Shane Cook vis-
ited the Magic Valley and fell deeply in 
love with the community. He believed 
the downtown area had the potential to 
be a lively gathering place for the peo-
ple of Twin Falls. Shane took his res-
taurant expertise and vision to restore 
a Main Avenue building to its original 
rustic red brick and customized a menu 
almost entirely sourced from local 
farmers and producers. Thanks to their 
10 years of business, the Sandwich 
Company has become a mainstay for 
many in the Magic Valley. 
Take a short stroll down Main Ave-
nue, and you will find another passion 
of Shane’s at Koto Brewing Company. 
Named after Tojiro ‘‘Tom’’ Koto, a 
Japanese immigrant who built the 
building in 1920, Koto Brewing Co. has 
been serving gourmet pub food, a full 
dinner menu, and an eclectic beer list 
since 2018. Shane and his business part-
ner, Twin Falls native and brewmaster 
Pierre Tusow, spent a year and a half 
exposing the building’s original brick 
and wood flooring and adding tabletops 
made from Twin Falls High School’s 
old gym floor. Shane and Pierre also 
pride themselves on donating $10 from 
every barrel of beer brewed to local 
charities. The local touches along with 
live music from local artists and a good 
laugh from comedians from all over the 
country make Koto Brewing Co. the 
gathering place Shane envisioned 15 
years ago. 
Congratulations to Shane Cook and 
all of the employees at Twin Falls 
Sandwich Company and Koto Brewing 
Company for being selected as an Idaho 
Small Business of the Month for May 
2022. You are an outstanding example 
of what it means to be one of Idaho’s 
Local Gems. You make our great State

DEMOCRACIES, IN COMMEMORA-
TION OF WORLD PRESS FREE-
DOM DAY ON MAY 3, 2022 
Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself, Mr. 
RUBIO, Mr. KAINE, Mr. TILLIS, Mr. 
CARDIN, Mr. MORAN, Mr. COONS, Mr. 
CORNYN, Mr. MERKLEY, and Mr. VAN 
HOLLEN) submitted the following reso-
lution; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 609 
Whereas Thomas Jefferson, who cham-
pioned the necessity of a free press for a 
thriving democratic society, wisely declared, 
‘‘Our liberty depends on the freedom of the 
press, and that cannot be limited without 
being lost.’’; 
Whereas Article 19 of the United Nations 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
adopted in Paris on December 10, 1948, states, 
‘‘Everyone has the right to freedom of opin-
ion and expression; this right includes free-
dom to hold opinions without interference 
and to seek, receive and impart information 
and ideas through any media and regardless 
of frontiers.’’; 
Whereas in 1993, the United Nations Gen-
eral Assembly proclaimed the third day of 
May of each year to be ‘‘World Press Free-
dom Day’’— 
(1) to celebrate the fundamental principles 
of press freedom; 
(2) to evaluate press freedom around the 
world; 
(3) to defend the media against attacks on 
its independence; and 
(4) to pay tribute to journalists who have 
lost their lives while working in their profes-
sion; 
Whereas the Daniel Pearl Freedom of the 
Press Act of 2009 (Public Law 111–166) ex-
panded the examination of the freedom of 
the press around the world in the annual 
Country Reports on Human Rights Practices 
published by the Department of State; 
Whereas, on December 18, 2013, and Decem-
ber 18, 2019, the United Nations General As-
sembly adopted Resolution 68/163 and Resolu-
tion 74/157, respectively, on the safety of 
journalists and the problem of impunity by 
unequivocally condemning all attacks on, 
and violence against, journalists and media 
workers, 
including 
torture, 
extrajudicial 
killing, enforced disappearance, arbitrary de-
tention, and intimidation and harassment in 
conflict and non-conflict situations; 
Whereas the First Amendment to the 
United States Constitution and various 
State constitutions protect freedom of the 
press in the United States; 
Whereas the United States Government 
has used the Global Magnitsky Human 
Rights Accountability Act (subtitle F of 
title XII of Public Law 114–328) to place tar-
geted visa and economic sanctions on indi-
viduals, including for their roles in the tar-
geted killings of journalists; 
Whereas, in an effort to combat attacks 
against 
journalists, 
Secretary 
of 
State 
Antony J. Blinken in February 2021 an-
nounced the Khashoggi Ban, a new policy al-
lowing the Department of State to impose 
visa restrictions on individuals who, acting 
on behalf of a foreign government, are be-
lieved to have been directly engaged in seri-
ous, extraterritorial counter-dissident ac-
tivities, including activities that suppress, 
harass, surveil, threaten, or harm journal-
ists, activists, or other persons perceived to 
be dissidents for their work; 
Whereas the 2021 World Press Freedom 
Index, compiled by Reporters Without Bor-
ders, warns that the COVID–19 pandemic ‘‘il-
lustrates the negative factors threatening 
the right to reliable information’’ and ampli-
fies the many crises that threaten media 
freedom and pluralism; 
Whereas the Freedom in the World 2022 re-
port, published by Freedom House, marked 
the 16th consecutive year of decline in global 
freedom, with ‘‘some 38 percent of the global 
population liv[ing] in Not Free countries, the 
highest proportion since 1997’’, and the orga-
nization’s Freedom on the Net 2021 report 
identified 11 consecutive years of decline in 
internet freedom. 
Whereas worsening media freedom has 
been one of the key drivers of these global 
declines, including attacks and prosecutions 
against journalists, pressure on media out-
lets, repressive regulatory and legal frame-
works, internet shutdowns, and blocks on on-
line sources of information; 
Whereas, according to the Committee to 
Protect Journalists— 
(1) at least 27 journalists were killed in 
2021, 21 of whom were singled out in retalia-
tion for their work; 
(2) India and Mexico had the most retalia-
tory killings in 2021; 
(3) at least 293 journalists were imprisoned 
in relation to their work on December 1, 
2021, marking the sixth consecutive year 
that at least 250 journalists were imprisoned 
globally; 
(4) China, Myanmar, Egypt, Vietnam, 
Belarus, and Turkey were responsible for 
nearly 50 percent of all jailed journalists 
worldwide; and 
(5) journalists around the world have been 
targeted by sophisticated spyware products 
that pose a severe risk to their safety and 
the safety of their sources; 
Whereas the Freedom to Write Index 2021, 
published by PEN America, noted that at 
least 277 writers and public intellectuals, in-
cluding columnists and editorial journalists, 
were jailed across 36 different countries dur-
ing 2021; 
Whereas, according to Reporters Without 
Borders, 362 journalists, 93 citizen journal-
ists, and 20 media assistants were imprisoned 
as of April 22, 2022; 
Whereas since the start of the Russia’s 
full-scale offensive against Ukraine, Report-
ers Without Borders has documented attacks 
directly targeting journalists wearing a 
‘‘Press’’ armband including— 
(1) the killing of 7 journalists; 
(2) the torture by electric shock, beatings, 
and mock executions of journalists working 
for the international press; and 
(3) the targeted kidnappings of journalists 
and their families in occupied regions of 
Ukraine to put pressure on their reporting; 
Whereas in the Ukrainian territory of Cri-
mea, Ukrainian journalists and bloggers 
have repeatedly been threatened, arbitrarily 
arrested, and tortured for resisting Russian 
occupation, such as the detention of Crimean 
journalist Vladyslav Yesipenko and Crimean 
Tatar 
journalists 
Osman 
Arifmemetov, 
Rustem Sheikhaliev, and Remzi Bekirov; 
Whereas media workers face heightened 
dangers in Russia, leading up to and fol-
lowing draconian censorship laws passed in 
the wake of the Russia’s full-scale invasion 
of Ukraine have intensified already wide- 
spread harassment, repression, and govern-
ment-driven retaliation, including in the 
cases of— 
(1) Sergey Mikhaylov, publisher of inde-
pendent newspaper Listok, who was arrested 
for spreading ‘‘fakes’’ about the Russian 
military; 
(2) Mikhail Afanasyev, editor-in-chief of 
the online magazine Novy Fokus, who was 
charged with spreading false information 
about the Russian military; 
(3) 
Natalya 
Tyshkevich, 
Vladimir 
Metelkin, 
Alla 
Gutnikova, 
and 
Armen 
Aramyan, the editors of student magazine 
DOXA, who were detained after refusing to 
take down a video informing Russian youth 
of their right to protest in support of 
Navalny; and 
(4) Novaya Gazeta, a landmark inde-
pendent newspaper, which ceased publication 
in Russia after receiving ominous warnings 
from Russia’s media regulator under its for-
eign agents law; 
Whereas the Government of the People’s 
Republic of China, which according to Re-
porters Without Borders is currently detain-
ing at least 127 journalists and forced 18 for-
eign correspondents to leave the country in 
2020, has unleashed an onslaught of attacks 
on press freedom in China and Hong Kong, 
including through— 
(1) 
state-sponsored 
censorship 
and 
disinformation campaigns limiting access to 
information about the novel coronavirus, in-
cluding through its censorship of virus-re-
lated keywords on social media platforms; 
(2) attacks on press freedom in Hong Kong, 
including the passage of the National Secu-
rity Law, which poses an existential threat 
to the city’s tradition of press freedom, and 
the arrest and subsequent conviction of 
Jimmy Lai, owner of Hong Kong’s largest 
media outlet, Apple Daily, and an outspoken 
democracy advocate; 
(3) arrests or other repressive actions 
against independent journalists and others 
in mainland China attempting to share un-
censored news or opinion about the COVID– 
19 outbreak, including the detention of cit-
izen journalist Chen Qiushi, who disappeared 
without explanation for longer than 600 days; 
(4) the detention of journalists critical of 
the Government of China, including Chen 
Jieren, who remains in prison after being 
sentenced to 15 years in 2020, following 2 
years of incommunicado detention, after 
blogging about allegations of corrupt local 
officials; and 
(5) the 2017 disappearance of Uyghur jour-
nalist and poet Qurban Mamut following a 
visit to the United States to visit his son, 
and his subsequent detention and 15-year 
prison 
sentence 
for 
alleged 
‘‘political 
crimes’’; 
Whereas Afghanistan under the Taliban re-
mains one of the most repressive countries 
for journalists, with journalists subject to 
arrest, beatings and arbitrary restrictions on 
their work; 
Whereas Belarus has witnessed sweeping 
attacks against the press since Alexander 
Lukashenka’s fraudulent election in August 
2020, with journalists and media workers har-
assed, assaulted, imprisoned, or otherwise re-
taliated against for their work, including— 
(1) Raman Pratasevich, a journalist in 
exile whose plane from Greece to Lithuania 
was illegally diverted by Belarusian authori-
ties and forced to land in Minsk, allowing 
Pratasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega 
to be arrested;

Whereas assaults on press freedom in El

tence in August 2020;

Whereas impunity continues for the Saudi 
officials involved in the 2018 assassination of 
Saudi columnist Jamal Khashoggi; 
Whereas the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 
maintains an especially hostile environment 
towards journalists through systematic and 
arbitrary arrests, torture and inhumane or

was referred to the Committee on 
Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs: 
S. RES. 610 
Whereas trade-based money laundering is 
among the most widely used and least under-
stood forms of money laundering, disguising 
proceeds of crime by moving value through 
international trade transactions in an at-
tempt to legitimize illicit origins of money 
or products; 
Whereas the transnational nature and 
complexity of trade-based money laundering 
make detection and investigation exceed-
ingly difficult; 
Whereas drug trafficking organizations, 
terrorist 
organizations, 
and 
other 
transnational criminal organizations have 
succeeded at trade-based money laundering 
despite the best efforts of United States law 
enforcement;

Whereas trade-based money laundering in-
cludes other offenses such as tax evasion, 
disruption of markets, profit loss for busi-
nesses, and corruption of government offi-
cials, and constitutes a persistent threat to 
the economy and security of the United 
States; 
Whereas trade-based money laundering can 
result in the decreased collection of customs 
duties as a result of the undervaluation of 
imports and fraudulent cargo manifests; 
Whereas trade-based money laundering can 
decrease tax revenue collected as a result of 
the sale of underpriced goods in the market-
place; 
Whereas trade-based money laundering is 
one mechanism by which counterfeiters in-
filtrate supply chains, threatening the qual-
ity and safety of consumer, industrial, and 
military products; 
Whereas drug trafficking organizations 
collaborate with Chinese criminal networks 
to launder profits from drug trafficking 
through Chinese messaging applications; 
Whereas on March 16, 2021, the Commander 
of the United States Southern Command, 
Admiral Faller, testified to the Committee 
on Armed Services of the Senate that 
transnational criminal organizations ‘‘mar-
ket in drugs and people and guns and illegal 
mining, and one of the prime sources that 
underwrites their efforts is Chinese money- 
laundering’’; 
Whereas the deaths and violence associated 
with drug traffickers, the financing of ter-
rorist organizations and other violent non- 
state actors, and the adulteration of supply 
chains with counterfeit goods showcase the 
danger trade-based money laundering poses 
to the United States; 
Whereas trade-based money laundering un-
dermines national security and the rule of 
law in countries where it takes place; 
Whereas illicit profits for transnational 
criminal organizations and other criminal 
organizations can lead to instability glob-
ally; 
Whereas the United States is facing a drug 
use and overdose epidemic, as well as an in-
crease in consumption of synthetic drugs, 
such as methamphetamine and fentanyl, 
which is often enabled by Chinese money 
laundering organizations operating in co-
ordination with drug-trafficking organiza-
tions and transnational criminal organiza-
tions in the Western Hemisphere that use 
trade-based money laundering to disguise 
the proceeds of drug trafficking; 
Whereas the presence of drug traffickers in 
the United States and their intrinsic connec-
tion to international threat networks, as 
well as the use of licit trade to further their 
motives, is a national security concern; 
Whereas 
drug-trafficking 
organizations 
frequently use the trade-based money laun-
dering scheme known as the ‘‘Black Market 
Peso Exchange’’ to move their ill-gotten 
gains out of the United States and into Cen-
tral and South America; 
Whereas United States ports and U.S. Cus-
toms and Border Protection do not have the 
capacity to properly examine the 60,000,000 
shipping 
containers 
that 
pass 
through 
United States ports annually, with only 2 to 
5 percent of that cargo actively inspected; 
Whereas trade-based money laundering can 
only be combated effectively if the intel-
ligence community, law enforcement agen-
cies, the Department of State, the Depart-
ment of Defense, the Department of the 
Treasury, the Department of Homeland Se-
curity, the Department of Justice, and the 
private sector work together; 
Whereas 
drug-trafficking 
organizations, 
terrorist 
organizations, 
and 
other 
transnational criminal organizations dis-
guise the proceeds of their illegal activities 
behind sophisticated mechanisms that oper-
ate seamlessly between licit and illicit trade 
and financial transactions, making it almost 
impossible to address without international 
cooperation; and 
Whereas the United States has established 
Trade Transparency Units with 18 partner 
countries, including with major drug-pro-
ducing and transit countries, to facilitate 
the increased exchange of import-export 
data to combat trade-based money laun-
dering: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate 
that— 
(1) the activities of transnational criminal 
organizations and their networks, and the 
means by which such organizations and net-
works move and launder their ill-gotten 
gains, such as through the use of illicit 
economies, illicit trade, and trade-based 
money laundering, pose a threat to the na-
tional interests and national security of the 
United States and allies and partners of the 
United States around the world; 
(2) in addition to considering the coun-
tering of illicit economies, illicit trade, and 
trade-based money laundering as a national 
priority and committing to detect, address, 
and prevent such activities, the President 
should— 
(A) continue to assess, in the periodic na-
tional risk assessments on money laun-
dering, terrorist financing, and proliferation 
financing conducted by the Department of 
the Treasury, the ongoing risks of trade- 
based money laundering; 
(B) finalize the assessment described in the 
Explanatory Statement accompanying the 
Financial Services and General Government 
Appropriations Act, 2020 (division C of the 
Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 (Pub-
lic Law 116–93)), which directs the Financial 
Crimes Enforcement Network of the Depart-
ment of the Treasury to thoroughly assess 
the risk that trade-based money laundering 
and other forms of illicit finance pose to na-
tional security; 
(C) work expeditiously to develop, finalize, 
and execute a strategy, as described in sec-
tion 6506 of the Anti-Money Laundering Act 
of 2020 (title LXV of division F of Public Law 
116–283; 134 Stat. 4631), drawing on the mul-
tiple instruments of United States national 
power available, to counter— 
(i) the activities of transnational criminal 
organizations, including illicit trade and 
trade-based money laundering; and 
(ii) the illicit economies such organiza-
tions operate in; 
(D) coordinate with international partners 
to implement that strategy, exhorting those 
partners to strengthen their approaches to 
combating transnational criminal organiza-
tions; and 
(E) review that strategy on a biennial basis 
and improve it as needed in order to most ef-
fectively address illicit economies, illicit 
trade, and trade-based money laundering by 
exploring the use of emerging technologies 
and other new avenues for interrupting and 
putting an end to those activities; and 
(3) the Trade Transparency Unit program 
of the Department of Homeland Security 
should take steps to strengthen its work, in-
cluding in countries that the Department of 
State has identified as major money laun-
dering jurisdictions under section 489 of the 
Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 
2291h).

CON-
FERENCE OF THE PARTIES TO 
THE TREATY ON THE NON-PRO-
LIFERATION OF NUCLEAR WEAP-
ONS 
Mr. MENENDEZ submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on Foreign Rela-
tions: 
S. RES. 611 
Whereas the Treaty on the Non-Prolifera-
tion of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) opened for 
signature 53 years ago on July 1, 1968, and 
entered into force in 1970; 
Whereas the NPT is a cornerstone of the 
global nuclear nonproliferation regime and 
has grown to include 191 States Parties; 
Whereas the United States remains com-
mitted to upholding the three pillars of the 
NPT, which include— 
(1) non-proliferation; 
(2) disarmament; and 
(3) the peaceful use of nuclear energy; 
Whereas Article III of the NPT obligates 
each nonnuclear weapon state to the NPT to 
conclude a Safeguards Agreement with the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 
to verify treaty compliance, 174 of which are 
Comprehensive 
Safeguards 
Agreements 
crafted to detect the diversion of nuclear 
materials from peaceful to non-peaceful 
uses; 
Whereas the IAEA strengthens the global 
nuclear and security framework and helps 
promote international nuclear cooperation, 
and IAEA safeguards are a requirement for 
United States bilateral nuclear cooperation; 
Whereas the United States was the first 
country to conclude a safeguards agreement 
with the IAEA; 
Whereas the 2018 Department of Defense 
Nuclear Posture Review affirms, ‘‘The Nu-
clear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) is a 
cornerstone of the nuclear nonproliferation 
regime. It plays a positive role in building 
consensus for non-proliferation and enhances 
international efforts to impose costs on 
those that would pursue nuclear weapons 
outside the Treaty.’’; 
Whereas the success of the NPT has and 
will continue to depend upon the full imple-
mentation by all States Parties of the NPT’s 
three mutually reinforcing pillars; 
Whereas, over the past half century, the 
United States has exhibited leadership in 
strengthening each of the NPT’s three pillars 
for the global good, including— 
(1) reducing its nuclear weapons stockpile 
by 88 percent from its maximum in 1967 of 
31,225 in parallel with equally massive reduc-
tions of the Russian Federation’s stockpile 
through bilateral coordination; 
(2) cooperating with former Soviet states 
to facilitate the surrender of nuclear weap-
ons on their soil after the fall of the Soviet 
Union; 
(3) providing voluntary contributions to 
the IAEA to promote peaceful nuclear activi-
ties exceeding $378,000,000 since 2010, includ-
ing activities that help in the treatment of 
cancer and other life-saving applications;

(4) extending deterrence to United States 
allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organiza-
tion (NATO), Japan, the Republic of Korea, 
and Australia, which is an unmistakable 
demonstration of the United States commit-
ment to collective security; 
Whereas the United States calls on the Is-
lamic Republic of Iran to comply with its ob-
ligations under the NPT, which it ratified in 
1970, abide by its 1974 comprehensive safe-
guards agreement with the IAEA, and fully 
and permanently implement the Additional 
Protocol to its IAEA safeguards agreement 
in refraining to obtain or produce nuclear 
weapons; 
Whereas heightened geopolitical tensions 
in recent years have made cooperation on 
nonproliferation and arms control issues 
with the Russian Federation and the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China more challenging; 
Whereas recent harmful actions by the 
Government of the Russian Federation have 
led to a further a deterioration in bilateral 
relations with the United States, including 
Russia’s illegal occupation of Crimea, its 
2014 invasion of Eastern Ukraine, and its 2022 
invasion into all of Ukraine, its brazen inter-
ference in the 2016 and 2020 United States 
presidential elections, its violation of the 
Treaty between the United States of Amer-
ica and the Union of Soviet Socialist Repub-
lics on the Elimination of Their Inter-
mediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles, 
signed at Washington December 8, 1987, and 
entered into force June 1, 1988 (commonly re-
ferred to as the ‘‘INF Treaty’’), its use of 
chemical nerve agents in assassination at-
tempts in the United Kingdom and against 
Aleksei A. Navalny, and its destabilizing ac-
tions in Syria; 
Whereas concerning actions by the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China have also strained bi-
lateral relations with the United States, in-
cluding a sustained build-up of nuclear 
forces, threatening military activities to-
ward Taiwan, and the transfer by Chinese en-
tities of proliferation and missile technology 
transfers to states such as the Islamic Re-
public of Iran, North Korea, Syria, and Paki-
stan; 
Whereas, despite these challenges, the 
United States remains committed to a stable 
strategic relationship with the Governments 
of the Russian Federation and the People’s 
Republic of China and especially in the field 
of nonproliferation and arms control; 
Whereas United States efforts to reduce 
dangers associated with nuclear arsenals 
through ambitious arms control agreements 
with both the Russian Federation and the 
People’s Republic of China would advance 
United States and global security, adding to 
the benefits of stability and transparency 
provided by existing agreements; 
Whereas President Joseph R. Biden’s deci-
sion to extend the New START Treaty be-
tween the United States and the Russian 
Federation for five years places verifiable le-
gally-binding limits on Russian ICBMs, 
SLBMs, and heavy bombers until February 5, 
2026; 
Whereas the Bilateral Consultative Com-
mission (BCC) continues to be the appro-
priate forum for the Parties to engage con-
structively on any New START Treaty im-
plementation issues that arise; 
Whereas the Ninth Review Conference of 
the States Parties to the NPT will take 
place in August of 2022 in New York, having 
been rescheduled due to restrictions brought 
on by the COVID–19 pandemic; and 
Whereas the Ninth Review Conference pre-
sents an opportunity to refocus States Par-
ties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation 
of Nuclear Weapons on the danger that the 
spread of nuclear weapons poses, to discuss 
potential ways to deal with countries that 
continue to pose a nuclear security threat, 
and to find common solutions so as to fur-
ther reduce the number of nuclear weapons 
in the world and enable increased use of nu-
clear energy while improving safeguards to 
ensure that illicit nuclear programs are not 
occurring: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of Congress 
that— 
(1) the United States should continue to 
encourage all States Parties to the Treaty 
on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons 
(NPT) to comply fully with the terms and 
the spirit of the Treaty; 
(2) the United States should— 
(A) maintain support for the IAEA through 
its assessed and voluntary contributions and 
seek to pay its dues at the beginning of the 
IAEA’s fiscal year and through advocating 
for all countries to enter into the Additional 
Protocols with the IAEA; 
(B) pursue a verifiable and comprehensive 
arms control agreement with the Russian 
Federation and the People’s Republic of 
China to capture strategic and nonstrategic 
nuclear weapons capabilities, which would 
enhance United States and global security 
by building upon other treaties, agreements, 
and transparency measures that reduce nu-
clear risk; 
(C) continue to encourage opportunities 
with other nuclear weapon-possessing states 
to reduce the reliance upon, role, and num-
ber of nuclear weapons in their national 
military strategies; and 
(D) advance critical United States security 
partnerships like the one among Australia, 
the United Kingdom, and the United States 
(commonly known as ‘‘AUKUS’’) consistent 
with IAEA safeguards, to provide Australia 
with naval nuclear propulsion technology to 
better deter against military aggression in 
the Indo-Pacific; and 
(3) the President is encouraged to work 
with other States Parties to the NPT to 
strengthen 
compliance 
and 
enforcement 
mechanisms and develop collective responses 
in the United Nations Security Council and 
in any other relevant multilateral fora to 
any notification of withdrawal from the 
Treaty.

SMALL 
BUSINESSES 
FOR 
NATIONAL 
SMALL BUSINESS WEEK 
Ms. ERNST (for herself, Mr. RISCH, 
Mr. YOUNG, Ms. HIRONO, Mrs. CAPITO, 
and Mr. MARKEY) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on Small Business 
and Entrepreneurship: 
S. RES. 612 
Whereas the United States proudly recog-
nizes small businesses as the backbone of the 
economy and acknowledges the impactful 
contributions 
of 
women 
entrepreneurs 
throughout the United States who are push-
ing small businesses to succeed; 
Whereas, 
because 
female 
professionals, 
leaders, and small business owners play a 
vital role in the economy of the United 
States, when the United States empowers 
women, it empowers the entire economy; 
Whereas 
women 
entrepreneurs 
provide 
critical goods and services, create high-pay-
ing jobs, build stronger supply chains for the 
United States, and play an integral role in 
Federal contracting and procurement; 
Whereas women small business owners are 
key job creators and employers that are 
building a legacy for the next generation of 
businesswomen; 
Whereas, according to the 2019 Annual 
Business Survey conducted by the Census 
Bureau, women-owned businesses employed 
more than 10,000,000 workers and accumu-
lated $1,800,000,000,000 in receipts; 
Whereas women-owned businesses make up 
more than 20 percent of all employer firms in 
the United States; 
Whereas the vast majority of all women- 
owned businesses are classified as small busi-
nesses; 
Whereas National Small Business Week 
takes place from May 1 to May 7, 2022, and 
recognizes the critical contributions of the 
entrepreneurs and small business owners of 
the United States; and 
Whereas women-owned small businesses 
should be celebrated for their accomplish-
ments and contributions during National 
Small Business Week: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) 
acknowledges 
the 
important 
role 
women-owned small businesses have in the 
economy of the United States; and 
(2) commits to supporting women-owned 
small businesses by recognizing those busi-
nesses during National Small Business Week.

SENATE RESOLUTION 614—DESIG-
NATING JULY 20, 2022, AS ‘‘GLIO-
BLASTOMA AWARENESS DAY’’ 
Mr. 
GRAHAM 
(for 
himself, 
Ms. 
SINEMA, Mr. KELLY, Mr. COONS, Ms. 
WARREN, Mr. MARKEY, and Mr. SCOTT 
of South Carolina) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was consid-
ered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 614 
Whereas approximately 13,460 new cases of 
glioblastoma will be diagnosed in the United 
States in 2022; 
Whereas glioblastoma is— 
(1) the most common malignant brain 
tumor, accounting for approximately 1⁄2 of 
all primary malignant brain tumors; and 
(2) the most aggressive, complex, difficult 
to treat, and deadly type of brain tumor; 
Whereas it is estimated that more than 
10,000 individuals in the United States will 
succumb to glioblastoma each year; 
Whereas the 5-year survival rate for glio-
blastoma patients is only 6.8 percent, and 
the median length of survival for glio-
blastoma patients is only 8 months; 
Whereas glioblastoma is described as a dis-
ease that affects the ‘‘essence of self’’, as the 
treatment and removal of glioblastoma pre-
sents significant challenges due to the 
uniquely complex and fragile nature of the 
brain, the primary organ in the human body 
that controls not only cognitive ability, but 
also the actions of every organ and limb; 
Whereas patients and caregivers play a 
critical role in furthering research for glio-
blastoma; 
Whereas, relative to other types of cancers, 
brain cancer patients pay the second highest 
out-of-pocket costs for medical services in 
both the initial and end-of life phases of 
care; 
Whereas, although research advances may 
fuel the development of new treatments for 
glioblastoma, challenging obstacles to accel-
erating progress toward new treatments for 
glioblastoma remain, and there are no 
screening or early detection methods; 
Whereas, in 2021, the World Health Organi-
zation reclassified brain tumors and made 
significant changes to the molecular charac-
teristics of a glioblastoma diagnosis, necessi-
tating critical biomarker testing for pa-
tients suspected of having a possible glio-
blastoma; 
Whereas, although glioblastoma was first 
described in medical and scientific literature 
in the 1920s, and despite its devastating prog-
nosis, only 4 drugs and 1 medical device have 
been approved by the Food and Drug Admin-
istration to treat glioblastoma since the 
1920s, and the mortality rates associated 
with glioblastoma have changed little during 
the past 30 years; 
Whereas, in 2020, the National Cancer In-
stitute established the Glioblastoma Thera-
peutics Network (referred to in this pre-
amble as ‘‘GTN’’), as part of a national infra-
structure to enhance and support the dis-
covery and development of glioblastoma 
therapies available for multi-institutional 
GTN teams to drive therapeutic agents 
through pre-clinical studies and early-phase 
clinical trials, which are necessary to rap-
idly evaluate potential treatments to ad-
vance toward cures and improved quality of 
life; and 
Whereas there is a need for greater public 
awareness of glioblastoma, including aware-
ness of both— 
(1) the urgent unmet medical needs of glio-
blastoma patients; and 
(2) the opportunities for research of, and 
treatment advances for, glioblastoma: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates July 20, 2022, as ‘‘Glio-
blastoma Awareness Day’’; 
(2) encourages increased public awareness 
of glioblastoma; 
(3) honors the individuals who have died 
from glioblastoma, a devastating disease, or 
are currently living with it; 
(4) supports efforts to develop better treat-
ments for glioblastoma that will improve the 
long-term prognosis for, and the quality of 
life of, individuals diagnosed with the dis-
ease; 
(5) recognizes the importance of molecular 
biomarker testing to the diagnosis and treat-
ment of glioblastoma; 
(6) expresses support for the individuals 
who are battling brain tumors, as well as the 
families, friends, and caregivers of those in-
dividuals; 
(7) urges a collaborative approach to brain 
tumor research among governmental, pri-
vate, and nonprofit organizations, which is a 
promising means of advancing the under-
standing and treatment of glioblastoma; and 
(8) encourages continued investments in 
glioblastoma research and treatments, in-
cluding through the Glioblastoma Thera-
peutics Network and other existing brain 
tumor research resources.

mitted the following resolution; which 
was referred to the Committee on For-
eign Relations: 
S. RES. 615 
Whereas, on February 24, 2022, Russian 
Federation President Vladimir Putin insti-
gated an unprovoked, unjustified, and unlaw-
ful war by violating the territorial integrity 
of the sovereign country of Ukraine; 
Whereas, as of May 3, 2022, more than 
5,500,000 Ukrainians have fled Ukraine since 
the Russian Federation began its invasion; 
Whereas the Republic of Poland has played 
a critical role in responding to the influx of 
Ukrainian refugees into Europe, admitting 
more than half of the Ukrainians who have 
fled from the conflict; 
Whereas the Republic of Poland has ac-
cepted more Ukrainian refugees than any 
other country, admitting more than 3,000,000 
Ukrainian refugees as of May 3, 2022; 
Whereas, prior to the invasion, the Repub-
lic of Poland had admitted more than 
1,500,000 Ukrainians since 2014, when the Rus-
sian Federation illegally annexed the Crimea 
region of Ukraine and started a separatist 
conflict in eastern Ukraine; 
Whereas the Republic of Poland continues 
to provide critical services to Ukrainian ref-
ugees in the Republic of Poland, including 
access to the Polish labor market, health 
care system, education, and social benefits; 
Whereas the people of the Republic of Po-
land have joined their government in re-
sponding to Ukrainian refugees with gen-
erosity, leadership, and resolve, including by 
welcoming Ukrainian refugees into their 
homes; 
Whereas the leaders of the Republic of Po-
land supported Ukrainian sovereignty and 
advocated for the need for a united front 
against Russian aggression prior to the inva-
sion of Ukraine; 
Whereas the Republic of Poland has facili-
tated the shipment of humanitarian assist-
ance into Ukraine by collecting and sending 
aid into Ukraine and by serving as a transit 
hub, simplifying border crossing procedures, 
and waiving road tolls for aid trucks; 
Whereas the Republic of Poland continues 
to provide vital military assistance to 
Ukraine and serves as a crucial transit hub 
for sending international military supplies 
and equipment into Ukraine; 
Whereas the Republic of Poland is a key 
partner in deterrence efforts against addi-
tional Russian aggression in Eastern Europe, 
including through their hosting of approxi-
mately 10,000 United States troops; 
Whereas the Republic of Poland has hosted 
the United States Embassy Kyiv during its 
temporary relocation, supporting the vital 
work of the Department of State of assisting 
United States citizens and their families de-
parting Ukraine; 
Whereas Poland is a crucial member of the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization alliance 
and a historic friend of the United States: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) thanks the Republic of Poland for its 
pivotal role accepting Ukrainian refugees; 
and 
(2) appreciates the ongoing support of the 
Republic of Poland for the sovereignty and 
territorial integrity of Ukraine, including 
through the North Atlantic Treaty Organiza-

STATES CODE 
Ms. ERNST (for herself and Mr. 
COONS) submitted the following concur-
rent resolution; which was referred to 
the Committee on Commerce, Science, 
and Transportation: 
S. CON. RES. 38 
Whereas, in February 2014, the Russian 
military invaded and annexed the Ukrainian 
peninsula of Crimea, and the Russian Fed-
eration took action to establish pro-Russian 
separatist states in the Donbas region of 
Ukraine; 
Whereas, the Russian Federation has failed 
to follow the cease-fire agreements estab-
lished by the Minsk 1 and Minsk 2 accords, 
and conflict has been ongoing in Ukraine 
since such invasion and annexation; 
Whereas, throughout 2021, Russia amassed 
troops, weapon systems, and military hard-
ware on the border of Russia and Ukraine; 
Whereas, on December 17, 2021, the Russian 
Federation presented the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization (referred to in this pre-
amble as ‘‘NATO’’) with a list of security de-
mands, including that NATO would never 
allow Ukraine, or other former Soviet states, 
into the alliance; 
Whereas such demands are counter to 
NATO’s ‘‘open door policy’’, which dates to 
the alliance’s founding and gives no third 
party a say in such deliberations; 
Whereas, on February 21, 2022, President 
Vladimir Putin officially recognized the re-
gions of Donetsk and Luhansk as inde-
pendent states despite international con-
sensus that those regions remain part of the 
sovereign territory of Ukraine; 
Whereas, on February 22, 2022, President 
Putin ordered Russian troops to enter 
Donetsk and Luhansk on a ‘‘peacekeeping 
mission’’ while setting the stage for a larger 
invasion; 
Whereas, on February 24, 2022, President 
Putin ordered Russian forces to conduct a 
full-scale invasion, moving beyond the re-
gions of Donetsk and Luhansk, and initi-
ating attacks throughout broader Ukrainian 
territory; 
Whereas Russian forces continue to dev-
astate Ukraine’s hospitals, schools, homes, 
and other civilian infrastructure, and threat-
en nuclear power plants with heavy artillery, 
multi-launch rocket systems, and munitions 
systems, with no regard for civilian casual-
ties; 
Whereas, an October 19, 2017, Government 
Accountability Office Report stated that a 
‘‘2015 analysis of agency data found that the 
application of [Cargo Preference for Food 
Aid (CPFA)] requirements increased United 
States Agency for International Develop-
ment’s and United States Department of Ag-
riculture’s costs for shipping food aid by 
about 23 percent, or $107 million, compared 
with the estimated shipping costs without 
application of CPFA requirements, from 
April 2011 through fiscal year 2014.’’; 
Whereas, in a United States Agency for 
International Development fact sheet titled: 
‘‘Food Aid Reform: Behind the Numbers’’, 
the United States Agency for International 
Development stated that eliminating the 
mandatory cargo preference reimbursements 
will reduce the deficit by an estimated 
$50,000,000 per year; 
Whereas, in March 2020, the American En-
terprise Institute published a report titled 
‘‘The Cost of Cargo Preferences for Inter-
national Food Aid Programs’’, which— 
(1) found ‘‘that removing cargo preference 
requirements would allow for between $36 
and $64 million of already appropriated funds 
to go to feeding the hungry and would ben-
efit U.S. soft power globally’’; and 
(2) concluded that ‘‘cargo preference for 
food 
aid 
imposes 
substantial 
costs 
on 
USAID’s Title II program budget. . . The im-
pacts are substantial, reducing the funds 
available for additional food aid programs by 
$52.83 million a year.’’; 
Whereas, in a March 25, 2022, information 
note titled ‘‘The importance of Ukraine and 
the Russian Federation for global agricul-
tural markets and the risks associated with 
the current conflict’’, the Food and Agri-
culture Organization (referred to in this pre-
amble as the ‘‘FAO’’) of the United Nations 
stated that— 
(1) the invasion of Ukraine could raise food 
prices ‘‘by 8 to 22 percent above their already 
elevated baseline levels’’; 
(2) ‘‘current indications are that, as a re-
sult of the conflict, between 20 and 30 per-
cent of areas sown to winter crops in 
Ukraine will remain unharvested during the 
2022/23 season, with the yields of these crops 
also likely to be adversely affected’’; and 
(3) ‘‘FAO’s simulations suggest that under 
such a scenario, the global number of under-
nourished people could increase by 8 to 13 
million people in 2022/23, with the most pro-
nounced increases taking place in Asia-Pa-
cific, followed by sub-Saharan Africa, and 
the Near East and North Africa.’’; 
Whereas, on April 8, 2022, the Associated 
Press published that ‘‘The U.N. Food and Ag-
riculture Organization said its Food Price 
Index, which tracks monthly changes in 
international prices for a basket of commod-
ities, averaged 159.3 points last month, up 
12.6% from February’’, and that ‘‘As it is, the 
February index was the highest level since 
its inception in 1990.’’; 
Whereas, on April 27, 2022, the United 
States Agency for International Develop-
ment said in a press release that ‘‘The world 
is suffering from historic levels of global 
food insecurity, which is being exacerbated 
by the impact Russia’s war on Ukraine is 
having on global food supplies. Available es-
timates suggest that an additional 40 million 
people could be pushed into poverty and food 
insecurity as a result of Russia’s aggres-
sion.’’; 
Whereas, on April 27, 2022, the Adminis-
trator of the United States Agency for Inter-
national Development, Samantha Power, 
said that ‘‘In Ukraine, which provides 10 per-
cent of the world’s wheat, farmers are strug-
gling to plant and harvest their crops for 
fear of shelling and Russian landmines, and 
their path to exporting these vital commod-
ities is severely restricted by Russia’s inva-
sion, which caused the closure of Ukraine’s 
ports.’’; and 
Whereas, on April 27, 2022, Secretary of Ag-
riculture Tom Vilsack, said that ‘‘Russia’s 
unprovoked war on Ukraine, a fellow major 
agricultural export country, is driving food 
and energy costs higher for people around 
the world.’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate (the House of Rep-
resentatives concurring), That— 
(1) a state of emergency exists due to the 
Russian invasion of Ukraine; 
(2) such state of emergency— 
(A) for the purposes of subparagraph (B), 
shall be in effect beginning on May 1, 2022, 
and ending on February 1, 2025; and

Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I

minority populations of the United States

cific Islanders. 
There being no objection, the Senate

Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I 
rise today to ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing April as National Mi-
nority Health Month. For over 35 
years, commemorating National Mi-
nority Health Month every April has 
provided us the opportunity to cele-
brate the progress we have made in ad-
dressing health disparities and recom-
mit to achieving health equity. I thank 
my 
colleagues, 
especially 
Senator 
SCOTT of South Carolina, for working 
with me to recognize this occasion for-
mally through a Senate resolution. 
Minority groups now make up more 
the 40 percent of the American popu-
lation, and that number will continue 
to 
rise. 
Health 
disparities 
persist 
among racial and ethnic minorities. 
These disparities are plainly visible if 
we examine the mental health crisis or 
diseases such as diabetes and asthma. 
Adults and children across all groups 
continue to experience increased be-
havioral health issues, but the burden 
on minority populations is heaviest. 
For instance, for American Indian and 
Alaska Native adults the death rate 
from suicide is about 20 percent higher 
than non-Hispanic White population. In 
2019, suicide was the leading and second 
leading cause of death for Native Ha-
waiians and Pacific Islanders and Afri-
can-Americans aged 15 to 24 respec-
tively. High school-aged Asian Amer-
ican males were 30 percent more likely 
to consider attempting suicide than 
non-Hispanic 
White 
male 
students 
were. 
This is why I continue to work with 
my colleagues in the Senate Finance 
Committee to improve access to behav-
ioral healthcare for everyone. I look 
forward to working with all of my col-
leagues in the Senate to get the bipar-
tisan package signed into law and am 
proud to continue my work to improve 
behavioral health, especially through 
increased telehealth access. 
More than 30 million Americans live 
with diabetes, but African-Americans 
are twice as likely and Hispanics are 
over 1.3 times as likely to die from dia-
betes as non-Hispanic Whites are. Afri-
can-Americans are also over three 
times more likely to suffer from diabe-
tes-related end-stage renal disease than 
non-Hispanic 
Whites 
are. 
African- 
Americans and Hispanics are also at 
higher risk of having other related 
complications, such as the need for 
lower extremity amputations. 
Asthma is another disease that dis-
proportionately harms African-Amer-
ican, Hispanic, and American Indian 
and 
Alaska 
Native 
peoples. 
These 
groups have the highest asthma rates, 
hospitalizations, and deaths. For exam-
ple, African-Americans are nearly 1.5 
times more likely to have asthma than 
non-Hispanic White Americans and 5 
times more likely to visit the emer-
gency room due to asthma. 
Social determinants of health such as 
access to transportation, education, 
housing, and income play a key role in 
health and well-being. According to the 
Healthy Baltimore 2020 report, the dis-
crepancy in life expectancy between 
higher-income and lower-income neigh-
borhoods within the city is as high as

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2292 
May 3, 2022 
20 years—20 years based on one’s Zip 
code. That is unconscionable. 
To tackle health inequity, we must 
understand its underlying causes. I am 
proud of the work that the National In-
stitutes 
of 
Health—NIH—based 
in 
Maryland, and NIH’s National Institute 
for Minority Health and Health Dis-
parities—NIMHD—are doing to advance 
the field of scientific research into 
health disparities. The evidence-based 
research that NIMHD invests in at in-
stitutions throughout the country is 
expanding the scientific knowledge 
base and informing practice and policy 
to reduce health disparities. Some re-
cent work of NIMHD has focused on the 
prevention, treatment, and manage-
ment of comorbid chronic diseases, as 
well as COVID–19 vaccine hesitancy 
within communities of color. 
COVID–19 has disproportionately af-
fected communities of color, particu-
larly 
African-Americans, 
Hispanic 
Americans, and American Indian or 
Alaska Native people, who are at an in-
creased risk of getting sick, having 
more severe illness, and dying from 
COVID–19. This is why I have fought 
for additional outreach and better data 
to close this gap. As part of that effort, 
Senator MENENDEZ
and I introduced 
our legislation, the COVID–19 Health 
Disparities Action Act, which would 
support targeted and culturally com-
petent public awareness campaigns 
about COVID–19 vaccines and preven-
tive measures such as masking and so-
cial distancing. 
I am glad to see NIMHD also tar-
geting these issues through the theme 
of this year’s National Minority Health 
Month, 
‘‘Give 
Your 
Community 
a 
Boost!’’ which focuses on the continued 
importance of COVID–19 vaccination, 
including boosters, as one of the most 
effective ways to protect communities 
from COVID–19. 
Accessible and affordable health cov-
erage is key to addressing health in-
equities. I was proud to help pass the 
Affordable Care Act—ACA—which ex-
panded health coverage to millions of 
Americans across the country. The 
American Rescue Plan built on the suc-
cess of the ACA and expanded care to 
an additional 5.8 million Americans in-
cluding 181,000 Marylanders. 
I look forward to continuing to work 
with my colleagues to build on this 
progress. 
As we recognize April as National Mi-
nority Health Month, let us recommit 
ourselves to ensuring all Americans 
have access to affordable, high-quality 
healthcare and renew our pledge to do 
everything possible to eliminate health 
disparities 
and 
ultimately 
achieve 
health equity for all.

HONORING 
THE 
50TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE BAR ASSOCIATION 
OF SAN FRANCISCO 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 3, 2022 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to ask the House of Representatives to join 
me in honoring and congratulating the 7,500 
members of the Bar Association of San Fran-
cisco (BASF) for their legacy of excellence in 
the promotion of justice. BASF is rooted in the 
12th and 14th Congressional Districts of Cali-
fornia, which Speaker Pelosi and I are privi-
leged to represent. BASF has worked tire-
lessly to make the law work for our commu-
nities. 
BASF is the third oldest bar association in 
the United States and its members first met on 
April 27, 1872. Over the following 150 years, 
BASF has grown into an institution character-
ized by innovation, entrepreneurship, and pro-
gressive thinking. In times of social and eco-
nomic turmoil in San Francisco and our nation, 
BASF pioneered paths that were copied by 
other local bar associations. 
Working for greater judicial efficiency, BASF 
has been instrumental in improving the Cali-
fornia Code, guiding the organization and 
rules of local and state courts, establishing a 
Code of Ethics, and helping identify competent 
and fair judges. Today, BASF is a highly re-
spected voice for mediation and alternative 
dispute resolution, criminal justice reform, judi-
cial independence, court funding, and equal 
access to justice. 
BASF consistently fights for the American 
promise of justice for all. In the early 20th cen-
tury, it was among the first bar associations to 
mobilize its members to support the Legal Aid 
Society. It then continued to create ways to 
help those touched by homelessness, immi-
gration status, family turmoil, and economic 
challenges. Today, the Justice & Diversity 
Center of BASF advances fairness and equity 
by providing pro bona legal services to low-in-
come and homeless residents, and all those in 
times of crisis. 
BASF also consistently fights for equal ac-
cess to legal services. In 1946, BASF pio-
neered a referral service that studied cultural, 
political and economic realities to better iden-
tify those most in need of access to our justice 
system. These efforts blossomed into its Law-
yer Referral and Information Service (LRIS). 
Today, LRIS educates people about their legal 
rights and offers access to affordable and 
competent legal consultation and representa-
tion. 
Equal opportunity in the legal profession is 
another priority for BASF. The bar association 
pioneered methods of diversity, equity, and in-
clusion. In the 1930s, BASF began a con-
tinuing legal education program that remains 
in strong demand as emerging areas of law 
demand expertise. BASF actively helped local 
firms and legal agencies with hiring, retention, 
and promotion of those attorneys new to their 
legal careers, women, people of color, those 
who identify as LGBTQ, and people of dif-
fering physical abilities. The bar of San Fran-
cisco strives to reflects the community it 
serves. 
Madam Speaker, I ask the entire House of 
Representatives to join me in commending the 
Bar Association of San Francisco for its re-
markable 150-year history promoting the 
causes of judicial efficiency, legal education, 
diversifying and strengthening the bar, and 
supporting all those who seek justice.

RECOGNIZING JAY STOUGH 
HON. BRIAN K. FITZPATRICK 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 3, 2022 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize an outstanding constituent 
from my district, Joseph (Jay) C. Stough. Jay 
entered the Doylestown Fire Company Num-
ber 1 as a volunteer firefighter on March 1, 
1972. Since that date, he has faithfully served 
the Doylestown community as a member of 
Fire Company Number 1 and the Doylestown 
Firefighters’ Relief Association. Throughout 
Jay’s time in this public service, he has held 
many positions within the fire company and 
the Relief Association’s administration, includ-
ing as President, Vice President and Treas-
urer. He continues to serve with distinction as 
the financial secretary of the Doylestown Fire 
Company. 
This year, as Jay celebrates 50 consecutive 
years of fire company service, I would like to 
recognize him for his dedication and leader-
ship, both of which provide immeasurable 
value to his community and have earned him 
the respect and admiration of his colleagues. 
We are grateful for the positive impact Jay has 
demonstrated throughout his time of extraor-
dinary service and wish him countless bless-
ings as he continues into his next decade with 
Doylestown Fire Company Number 1.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 100TH AN-
NIVERSARY OF THE ASSOCIATE 
ALUMNAE 
OF 
DOUGLASS 
COL-
LEGE 
HON. FRANK PALLONE, JR. 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 3, 2022 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the Associate Alumnae of Doug-
lass College as its members commemorate its 
100th anniversary this year. 
The Associate Alumnae of Douglass Col-
lege was founded by members of the Class of 
1922, the first graduating class of the New 
Jersey College for Women (present day Doug-
lass Residential College). Since that time, the 
organization has continued to advance its mis-
sion to develop, promote and support Doug-
lass alumnae. 
The Associate Alumnae of Douglass Col-
lege is led by a volunteer Board of Directors, 
all of whom are Douglass alumnae. Through-
out its first century, the organization has been 
led by many distinguished alumnae, including 
Inez Phillips Durham, Victoria Dabrowski 
Schmidt, Evelyn Sermons Field, and its cur-
rent President, Jeanne Fox. 
Today, the Associate Alumnae of Douglass 
College consists of a network of over 39,000 
women across the globe with a shared pursuit 
of lifelong learning. Through its programs, 
services and networks, the Associate Alumnae 
of Douglass College advances the personal 
and professional growth of its members. The 
organization provides opportunities to engage 
in both social and educational forums, fos-
tering connections and empowering women. In 
addition to its programs, the Associate Alum-
nae of Douglass College oversees endowment 
funds, including the Douglass Fund, and en-
sures proper management and distribution. 
Madam Speaker, I sincerely hope that my 
colleagues will join me in congratulating the 
Associate Alumnae of Douglass College on its 
100th anniversary. The organization has 
paved a successful path for generations of 
women and its efforts are truly deserving of 
this recognition.

HONORING JOHN AND KATHY 
LOGUE 
HON. ANDY KIM 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 3, 2022 
Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor John and Kathy Logue, 
who are being honored as the 2022 Citizens 
of the Year for Moorestown, New Jersey. This 
year’s award recognizes two Moorestown resi-
dents who have positively impacted the quality 
of life of our community. 
John and Kathy moved to Moorestown in 
1978 and immediately became involved in the 
community. Their collaborations touched the 
lives of many, and they have become familiar 
faces around town. Whether it was volun-
teering at neighborhood events, coaching 
sports teams, or leading a Girl Scout troop, 
their positivity radiates throughout our commu-
nity. During the last 46 years, John and Kathy 
have volunteered with 9 and 11 different orga-
nizations respectively, in Moorestown and 
throughout New Jersey. 
Starting 
his 
work 
in 
1978 
as 
the 
Moorestown Deputy Clerk, John became an 
active member of many committees and advi-
sory boards. Totaling a combined 12 years of 
service, John played an integral role on the 
Planning Board; the Zoning Board; the Eco-
nomic Development Advisory Committee; the 
Low and Moderate Income Housing Advisory 
Committee; Moorestown’s Visioning Advisory

Committee; and the Make It Moorestown Cele-
bration Committee. In addition, John was an 
active member of the Moorestown Rotary Club 
and the Knights of Columbus Council 1082. 
Similarly impressive, Kathy served as Vice 
President, Planning Board Alternate, and a 
member of the Appearance Committee for the 
Moorestown School Board for more than a 
decade. Kathy was also a Board Member and 
Secretary of the Moorestown Business Asso-
ciation from 2006 to 2009. Her most recent 
community work involves her contributions to 
Percheron Park and her involvement on the 
Moorestown Tree Planting and Preservation 
Committee. 
For almost five decades, whether they were 
together or apart, John and Kathy they have 
been integral participants in Moorestown’s vol-
unteer community and have been described 
as an inspiration to everyone around them. I 
am proud to congratulate them both for win-
ning this award and thank them for their con-
tinued service to our community.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF DR. 
JOHNNIE ANDERSON JONES, SR., 
ESQ. 
HON. TROY A. CARTER 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 3, 2022 
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, 
today, I want to recognize the extraordinary 
life of Dr. Johnnie Anderson Jones, Sr., Esq. 
of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, a Civil Rights Law-
yer, and World War II Veteran, at the tender 
age of 102 on April 23, 2022. 
Dr. Jones was born November 30, 1919, in 
Laurel 
Hill, 
Louisiana 
and 
raised 
on 
Rosemound Plantation by his parents, who 
farmed 73 acres of land but insisted that their 
son get an education. He attended a two-room 
schoolhouse and became interested in the 
law, he said, when a teacher gave him a book 
by Charles Evans Hughes, then the Chief Jus-
tice of the United States. 
‘‘While we were out in the fields picking cot-
ton, I would be thinking about what I read in 
that book,’’ Mr. Jones told the Advocate of 
Baton Rouge. ‘‘I couldn’t stand the sight of 
people picking cotton . . . . Everything it rep-
resented.’’ 
Mr. Jones enrolled at Southern University 
and A&M College in Baton Rouge, planning to 
major in industrial education. He was 24 years 
old, a future civil rights lawyer not yet grad-
uated from college, when he landed on the 
beaches of Normandy in the D-Day invasion 
of 1944. He was tasked with unloading equip-
ment during the Normandy invasion. 
He became the Army’s first African-Amer-
ican warrant officer. He was assigned to a unit 
responsible for unloading equipment and sup-
plies onto Normandy. 
He nearly died before his ship reached the 
shore, when the explosion of a mine sent him 
flying ‘‘sky high into the air,’’ he recalled, and 
onto an upper deck. He again almost died 
when he came under German sniper fire on 
Omaha Beach. 
When Mr. Jones returned home to Lou-
isiana, he was greeted not with a hero’s wel-
come, but rather with all the indignities of seg-
regation in the Jim Crow South. 
Riding 
a 
bus 
with 
fellow 
U.S. 
servicemembers, Mr. Jones, who was African 
American, was forced to sit in the back of the 
coach. He was driving to New Orleans to have 
shrapnel removed from his neck when a White 
police officer, entirely unprovoked, pulled him 
over and began assaulting him. 
‘‘He knocked me down and started kicking 
me,’’ he said. ‘‘Things weren’t right. ‘Separate 
but equal’ was unconstitutional, and I wanted 
to fight it and make it better.’’ 
Mr. Jones did so by enrolling in law school 
and becoming a lawyer in the early years of 
the civil rights movement. Mr. Jones was cred-
ited with fighting legal battles on multiple 
fronts of the movement for racial equality. 
He worked with voter leagues and with civil 
rights organizations; including the NAACP and 
the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE). He 
assisted demonstrators who participated in 
lunch-counter sit-ins. During that time, his car 
was bombed on two separate occasions. 
After the 1954 Supreme Court ruling in 
Brown v. Board of Education, which outlawed 
segregation in public schools, he helped ac-
company about 30 Black children to a White 
elementary school in Baton Rouge, historian 
Adam Fairclough wrote in the volume ‘‘Race 
and Democracy: The Civil Rights Struggle in 
Louisiana, 1915–1972.’’ 
But Mr. Jones played perhaps his most sig-
nificant role in the 1953 Baton Rouge bus boy-
cott, a long-overlooked event that helped in-
spire the landmark boycott two years later in 
Montgomery, Ala., prompted by the arrest of 
Rosa Parks. Mr. Jones was only two weeks 
out of law school in June 1953 when the Rev. 
T.J. Jemison, a founding member of the 
Southern Christian Leadership Conference, in-
vited him to represent the organizers of the ef-
fort in Baton Rouge. 
‘‘I told him, ‘That’s an awfully big suit to 
fill,’ ’’ Mr. Jones recalled to a reporter in 2015. 
‘‘But he said, ‘Nonsense, Brother Jones, you 
can do it.’ ’’ 
The 
Baton 
Rouge 
demonstration 
was 
touched off when Martha White, an African- 
American housekeeper, ignited a controversy 
by taking a seat in a section of a public bus 
reserved for White riders. During the eight-day 
boycott that followed, activists organized car-
pools that allowed participants to travel to and 
from work without riding city buses. Eighty 
percent of the city’s bus ridership at the time 
was African American. The boycott ended with 
the partial desegregation of city buses, with 
the front two rows of seats reserved for White 
people and the last two rows for Black people. 
While some protesters had hoped for a more 
dramatic outcome, historians today describe 
the Baton Rouge boycott as a prototype of 
others to come. 
‘‘Almost unnoticed at the time,’’ the Baton 
Rouge protest ‘‘was a direct precursor of the 
Montgomery bus boycott,’’ Fairclough wrote, 
‘‘and an event of major significance in the evo-
lution of the civil rights movement.’’ 
Upon his return to the United States, he re-
sumed his studies and changed his major to 
psychology, receiving a bachelor’s degree in 
1949. He received a law degree, also from 
Southern University, in 1953. 
Mr. Jones served briefly in the Louisiana 
House of Representatives in the 1970s. He 
continued practicing law into his 90s. 
Mr. Jones was predeceased by his four chil-
dren, Johnnie A. Jones Jr., Adal Jones, Adair 
Jones and Ann Jones. Survivors include many 
grandchildren and great-grandchildren. 
During his service in World War II, Mr. 
Jones sustained shrapnel wounds that he 
would bear for the rest of his life. 
‘‘The doctor told me it would really hurt in 
75 years, but I wouldn’t have to worry about 
that,’’ he bravely discussed. ‘‘I fooled him. It 
hurts, and I’m still picking it out of my head 
and arm. A piece came out just above my left 
eye yesterday.’’ 
He waited nearly eight decades for his serv-
ice to be recognized with a Purple Heart, re-
ceiving the award only last year. The long 
delay was symbolic of what he saw as the 
slow move toward justice in the civil rights 
movement. 
His heroism will be forever marked in our 
lives. I am proud to say the life he lived paved 
the way for me to enjoy the accomplishments 
I have endured following his footsteps. I will 
continue to work for the citizens of Louisiana, 
as Dr. Jones did, always striving to make life 
better in our community.

HONORING DAVID MCWILLIAM 
RASER 
HON. KAY GRANGER 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 3, 2022 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor David McWilliam Raser, a 
hardworking and dedicated staff member of 
the House Appropriations Committee, who 
suddenly passed away on February 5th of this 
year. 
Son of David and Denise Raser, Dave was 
born in Long Island, New York on May 3, 
1997. Just a few years later, the Rasers 
added another member to the family, Emily, 
who would become Dave’s best friend. In the 
early 2000s, the family headed for warmer 
weather, moving from New York to Naples, 
Florida. 
Dave grew to become an accomplished 
young man in his academic, athletic, and serv-
ice endeavors. He spent much of his time out-
doors, whether fishing, hiking, or playing team 
sports. In fact, Dave and his rugby team—the 
Naples Bears—went on to win State in 2014. 
He continued his pursuit of fitness into his pro-
fessional life, running a marathon and sur-
passing his goal of running 1,000 miles in 
2021. 
In high school, he joined the Junior Reserve 
Officer Training Corps, where he rose to the 
rank of Battalion Commander. Because of his 
leadership and achievements, Congressman 
MARIO DIAZ-BALART nominated Dave to the 
United States Military Academy at West Point. 
As fate would have it, Dave instead at-
tended Louisiana State University, where he 
would receive a Bachelor of Arts in Political 
Science, specializing in American government 
and politics. Before graduating, Dave served 
as a summer intern for Congressman Thomas 
Rooney, where he learned the legislative proc-
ess firsthand, and shortly after receiving his di-
ploma in 2019, Dave moved to Washington, 
D.C. with hopes of obtaining a full-time posi-
tion in Congress. 
Dave joined the House Appropriations Com-
mittee as an intern in 2019 and did such great 
work that he officially joined my committee 
staff in 2020. In his role, he served as the ulti-
mate utility player, always willing and eager to 
assist when needed, regardless of the task at 
hand. Whether it was preparing materials for 
hearings and briefings or assisting staff with

reviewing legislation, he worked just as hard 
as anyone and did so with a heart of gratitude 
and service. Dave always had a smile on his 
face and a joyful spirit that uplifted others. He 
truly made a positive impact on everyone he 
interacted with. 
At the age of 24, Dave passed away just 
days shy of his two-year work anniversary. 
Joined by family, friends, and committee staff, 
his funeral service was held at the same chap-
el he was baptized in as a child. 
Today, May 3rd, would have been Dave’s 
25th birthday. In honor of his birthday, we cel-
ebrate his life and remember the incredible 
son, brother, and friend he was. Words cannot 
express how saddened we are at the loss of 
someone so young and so kind. Dave is dear-
ly missed by his colleagues. On behalf of Con-
gress and the Appropriations Committee, I 
offer my deepest condolences to Dave’s family 
and friends.

HONORING OF JAMES MABE 
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 3, 2022 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
honor of James Mabe of Abingdon, Virginia, 
who passed away on April 10, 2022, at the 
age of 66. Mr. Mabe was a well-known voice 
in the community as a radio host for more 
than 30 years. 
Mr. Mabe was born on April 30, 1955, to 
Eugene and Easter Mabe. He was educated 
at Fort Chiswell High School. He always held 
a great love for music. As a young man, he 
performed with many local bands and worked 
in his family’s truck stop until he started in 
radio. His first on-air appearance was with a 
station in Pulaski, Virginia, in 1983. He went 
on to be a voice in radio for more than three 
decades but spent most of his career as the 
host of the ‘‘More Music Morning Show’’ in 
Marion, Virginia. 
His voice was in the ears of community 
members in their homes, on their daily com-
mutes, and during their workdays. His candor 
and lively personality made it easy for him to 
connect with his listeners. He was known for 
his witty one-liners. He loved his job and the 
ability to reach so much of the community. In 
2020, the American Advertising Federation of 
Southwest Virginia awarded him the Silver 
Medal for Lifetime Achievement. 
Mr. Mabe was predeceased in death by his 
parents; his sister, Janie Mabe; and his father- 
in-law and mother-in-law, WR and Evangeline 
Humphreys. He is survived by his loving wife 
of 32 years, Annette Mabe; daughters, Kaci 
Willis and her husband, Jon; Stacey Burton 
and partner, Jesse Blevins; and Jenny Mabe; 
grandchildren Caleb, Jaden, Noah, Laine, 
Avery, Archer and Gunner; brother, Gerald 
Mabe and wife, Kathy; as well as many other 
beloved friends and family, including many lis-
teners of his show. I offer my condolences to 
them on the loss of this great man. 
HONORING JEFF PRICE OF 
MILLIKEN AND COMPANY 
HON. WILLIAM R. TIMMONS, IV 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 3, 2022 
Mr. TIMMONS. Madam Speaker, today, I 
rise to honor Jeff Price on his well-earned re-
tirement 
from 
Milliken 
and 
Company, 
headquartered in Spartanburg, South Carolina. 
Milliken, a global leader in textiles and mate-
rials science, has a clear commitment to inno-
vation, growth and leadership—which makes it 
a tough place to stand out. Yet, for 43 years, 
Jeff Price has done exactly that. 
Jeff joined Milliken after graduating from the 
University of North Carolina in 1979. Jeff start-
ed in Milliken on the plant floor and worked as 
a business manager before he was selected 
to run an essential division at Milliken: the 
global airbag and non-woven automotive divi-
sion. Think about that level of responsibility. 
Countless South Carolinians, countless Ameri-
cans, rely on airbags every day to keep our-
selves and our loved ones safe. We don’t 
think about it when we get in our cars, to go 
to work or school or soccer practice, but we 
know we can do so with the highest level of 
safety because of the work of Jeff Price and 
his teams at Milliken. 
Jeff’s demonstrated success in airbags and 
non-woven automotive led him to serving as 
president of Milliken’s textile business, where 
he continued to focus on innovation and solu-
tions-driven leadership. In that role, he co- 
chaired the American Manufacturing Trade Ac-
tion Coalition (AMTAC) and was instrumental 
in the decision to merge AMTAC with the Na-
tional 
Council 
of 
Textile 
Organizations 
(NCTO), where he also served as Chairman, 
Vice Chairman, and Board member. 
In 2019, after Jeff had held 13 different 
roles at the company, Milliken CEO Halsey 
Cook tapped Jeff to stand up a new position— 
Executive Vice President of Operations— 
where he oversees corporate logistics and 
sourcing, environmental health and safety, 
corporate engineering and global security. If 
that sounds like a lot, that is because it is. 
Jeff’s leadership in both manufacturing and 
general management make him an effective 
strategic leader in global operations for the 
company, and, by extension, for all commu-
nities in South Carolina and around the world 
where Milliken has locations. 
Earlier this year, Jeff’s decades of success 
at Milliken were recognized when he was 
awarded the Roger Milliken Award—an exclu-
sive recognition that honors individuals who 
have created lasting and measurable dif-
ferences within the company and have built a 
legacy of their own at Milliken. 
Yet, greater than all the achievements and 
professional success I have shared, Jeff is the 
loving husband of Terri, proud father of Jen-
nifer (husband Amine) and Christopher (wife 
Amanda), and grandfather of eight. I know his 
family joins me in celebrating his accomplish-
ments for Milliken in and out of the manufac-
turing plant. Terri, pastor at Providence Pres-
byterian Church in Powdersville, South Caro-
lina, is also retiring this year. 
I am pleased to be joined by Representa-
tives TOM RICE (SC–02), JEFF DUNCAN (SC– 
03), RALPH NORMAN (SC–05) in honoring Jeff 
Price as he prepares for his well-earned retire-
ment from Milliken and Company at the end of 
this year. Congratulations and Godspeed.

REMEMBERING ANDREW CRESCI 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 3, 2022 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to remember Andrew Cresci, a remarkable 
man who recently passed away at the age of 
82. Andy did what only a few souls dream to 
accomplish: He housed people, offering them 
a chance at the American Dream. 
My district is populated by homes immor-
talized by Pete Seeger and Malvina Reynolds 
in the song ‘‘Little Boxes.’’ Andy Cresci and 
his hearty employees built thousands of those 
‘‘little boxes’’ on the hillsides of Daly City, 
along the streets of South San Francisco, and 
throughout Hercules. However, let’s set the 
record straight: Pete Seeger and Malvina Rey-
nolds were wrong. These homes were well 
built, beloved by their first owners, and are 
proudly owned by the current generation of 
homeowners. 
The Standard Building Company/Sunstream 
Homes began in the 1920s and was a thriving 
company when Andy Cresci started as an ar-
chitect in the 1960s. He eventually took over 
as CEO after the founders, Carl and Fred 
Gellert, retired. Sunstream built dreams. In the 
Serramonte neighborhood, in South San Fran-
cisco and Hercules, thousands of affordable 
homes ready-made for proud ownership were 
constructed. Andy Cresci required that homes 
be built to satisfy every customer. One former 
employee noted that while he was with the 
company—over decades—he and his team 
never set foot in a courtroom due to a cus-
tomer complaint. They would often return after 
the warranty had expired to fix anything that 
was of concern. Every Sunstream home has a 
license plate-like piece of metal, typically in 
the garage, identifying its number in the long 
series of homes built by Sunstream. So, if you 
bought the 4,352nd Sunstream home, you 
knew that there were 4,351 satisfied cus-
tomers who came before you. 
We often hear today of companies that 
refuse to share their success with employees. 
Sunstream was different. Many employees 
made investments alongside management, 
even as little as $600, and received significant 
returns on their investments. Andy ran a pru-
dent operation that delivered value to both 
customers and employees. In later years, as 
opportunities to purchase large tracts of land 
dwindled, he had a sharp eye for infill devel-
opment opportunities and looked for surplus 
public lands. 
He wasn’t all about work. Andy loved golf 
and for many years he belonged to the ‘‘Dew 
Sweepers,’’ a group of fellow golfers who 
played courses very early in the morning, typi-
cally at Poplar Creek. The loser had to buy 
everyone else french fries. At home, his ‘‘man 
cave’’ included three TVs so that he could 
watch baseball, golf, and basketball, but espe-
cially the 49ers. He was a season ticket hold-
er. He travelled widely, loved such disparate 
music as ABBA, Elvis Presley and Queen, and 
of course he enjoyed Italian classics. 
Andy Cresci had a dry wit and a wet gar-
den. A friend reports that he had five or six

varieties of tomatoes and harvested a bounti-
ful crop each year. 
Andy left his mark in many remarkable 
ways, but most notably through his personal 
and voluntary philanthropic efforts. He served 
on the Board of Directors of the Gellert Foun-
dation. Over the decades, he and his fellow 
board members donated many millions of dol-
lars, chiefly to education, but also to youth 
programs and seniors. We will probably never 
know how much he donated through his own 
charitable giving, but it is said to have been a 
significant sum. Always concerned about put-
ting a roof over the head of someone or 
something, he designed and built birdhouses, 
made from wooden wine boxes, and he do-
nated these birdhouses to charity where they 
sold at fundraisers. His philanthropy included 
the Fallen Heroes Memorial in the City of San 
Mateo, the Wounded Warrior Project, and the 
San Mateo Police Activities League. 
Andy Cresci was the proud father of Lisa 
Christensen, 
the 
father-in-law 
of 
John 
Christensen, and the stepfather of Nicole 
Pobuta Aquino (Miguel), Kristen Pobuta Iwata 
(Nick), the grandfather of Nicolas and Anthony 
Christensen, and the step-grandfather of Car-
son Iwata. He was predeceased by his first 
wife Kathy Cresci and survived by my friend 
and the former Mayor of San Mateo, Maureen 
Freschet. 
Madam Speaker, a long life leads to many 
accomplishments arising from opportunities. 
Most people seize opportunities that arrive by 
chance, but a few people also spend their 
lives creating opportunities. Andy Cresci was 
the latter. He was a doer and a dreamer. 
Without question, and for tens of thousands of 
customers, friends and family members, Andy 
Cresci made a difference for the better in our 
community. He was the personification of pa-
triotism. May he rest in peace.

RECOGNIZING MS. DENISE SMITH 
HON. HALEY M. STEVENS 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 3, 2022 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of Ms. Denise Smith of 
Canton, Michigan, upon her 70th birthday. Ms. 
Smith is a tireless community servant and per-
sonal friend who has dedicated her life to ad-
vancing many social and political causes that 
are critically important to the people of Michi-
gan’s 11th Congressional District and the 
greater Metropolitan Detroit community. The 
entire Nation benefits from the work of Ms. 
Smith, and it is a pleasure to join her family 
and friends in celebrating and thanking her 
today upon achieving this significant mile-
stone. 
Ms. Denise Smith grew up in Waterford, 
Michigan and has continued to make South-
east Michigan her home for many years since. 
She spent much of her career with Ford Motor 
Company in corporate finance, retiring after 25 
years, in 2014. In addition to the full-time com-
mitment of maintaining a family and career, 
Ms. Smith found great pleasure in serving her 
community through volunteering and grass-
roots organizing. She was inspired to lead a 
life of service by her experience as a child, 
watching her parents offer help to anyone in 
need. This instilled in Denise a strong sense 
of service, leading to her affiliation with many 
local organizations throughout her life that 
have the mission of helping others. 
Among the many causes that Ms. Smith has 
taken up, she has worked to support and ad-
vocate for survivors of domestic and sexual vi-
olence with First Step Michigan, address the 
gun violence epidemic with Moms Demand 
Action, and organize and distribute clothing to 
those in need as a high school clothing bank 
volunteer. Expanding the scope of her activ-
ism, Ms. Smith was drawn to assist with the 
election of Barack Obama, serving as a volun-
teer for his 2008 campaign. Ms. Smith loves 
sharing her enthusiasm for her community by 
making phone calls to engage voters, assem-
bling yard signs to remind neighbors of the up-
coming election, and overseeing campaign of-
fices and their administration. She also served 
on the board of the Canton Democratic Club 
and was Treasurer of the Township Treas-
urer’s campaign. Because of her tireless ef-
forts, she was deservedly awarded the 2013 
Grassroots Activist Award from her local 
Democratic Party organization. 
Along with being a prolific local activist, Ms. 
Smith is proud to be a mother and grand-
mother. Her beloved son, Sam Plymale (Chel-
sea Plymale) of Livonia, Michigan, and daugh-
ter, Sarah Plymale-Ponza (Victor Ponza) of 
Portland, Oregon, have brought her great joy 
in welcoming two lovely grandchildren, Anna-
belle Plymale and Zadian Ponza; she is also 
thrilled for another grandson, Joseph Plymale, 
to join the family this June. Being a mother 
and grandmother motivates Ms. Smith’s efforts 
to extend beyond rhetoric, as she translates 
her passion into action that is certain to leave 
our nation a better place for future genera-
tions. 
Madam Speaker, Ms. Denise Smith has 
dedicated herself to helping others and has 
improved the lives of countless individuals 
within Michigan’s 11th Congressional District 
and beyond. Her acts of kindness as a servant 
leader have an impact that will positively influ-
ence our community and Nation long into the 
future. It is with great pleasure that I ask my 
colleagues to join me in recognizing Ms. 
Denise Smith upon her 70th birthday and to 
thank her for the years of service on behalf of 
her fellow Americans.

IN RECOGNITION OF RICK YOST 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 3, 2022 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of the retirement of Mr. 
Rick Yost, the Superintendent of Fredericks-
burg Christian School. Rick has faithfully 
served as Superintendent since 2004. Each 
year, Rick’s love for Fredericksburg Christian 
School and commitment to the students has 
grown exponentially. A polished leader and 
expert communicator, Rick worked tirelessly 
throughout his time as Superintendent to edu-
cate the next generation of Christian Ameri-
cans and prepare them for a life of amazing 
opportunities. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me in 
recognizing the accomplishments of Rick Yost. 
Words alone cannot express the positive im-
pact he has had on the next generation. May 
God bless the next phase of Rick’s journey 
and continue to guide him in all his endeavors.

IN RECOGNITION OF MARIA 
GUADALUPE ‘‘LUPITA’’ AGUILAR 
HON. HENRY CUELLAR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 3, 2022 
Mr. CUELLAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Maria Guadalupe ‘‘Lupita’’ Aguilar. 
Maria Guadalupe ‘‘Lupita’’ Aguilar was born 
and raised in Laredo, TX. A proud daughter of 
a WWII Veteran and a farmworker turned 
seamstress, Lupita was taught about the val-
ues of community and service at an early age. 
Lupita honorably graduated from Nixon High 
School and Laredo Community College and 
made a career in the service industry—work-
ing in housing and health care spaces pri-
marily focusing on servicing low-income, 
Latino families throughout Laredo and Webb 
County. 
The biggest accomplishment of her life has 
been being a mother of four grown children 
who are in their late 20’s and early 30’s: Jorge 
‘‘Georgie’’ Aguilar, Jaime ‘‘JB’’ Aguilar, Lorena 
Aguilar, and Randy Aguilar. Watching them 
graduate from college, start a job and form 
their own families has been a blessing. Guid-
ed by her Catholic faith, positive mentality and 
optimism, Lupita has surmounted many chal-
lenges in the past including beating breast 
cancer twice. 
During her free time, Lupita enjoys spending 
time with her grandchildren, cooking and trav-
eling when she gets the opportunity. She and 
her husband reside in Rio Bravo, TX—just 
blocks away from the Rio Grande—where 
they’ve lived for over 20 years. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing Maria Guadalupe ‘‘Lupita’’ Aguilar.

HONORING CHARLES MINOT DOLE 
FOR HIS FOUNDING OF THE NA-
TIONAL SKI PATROL AND HIS 
CONTRIBUTIONS 
TO

10TH 
MOUNTAIN DIVISION 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 3, 2022 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor and remember the extraor-
dinary life of Charles Minot ‘‘Minnie’’ Dole. 
Minnie Dole played a pivotal role in founding 
the National Ski Patrol and creating the 10th 
Mountain Division as we know it today. 
Minnie Dole was born in Tyngsboro, Massa-
chusetts on April 18, 1899. He attended Phil-
lips Academy and then graduated Yale in 
1923. Mr. Dole was an outdoor enthusiast and 
a member of the prestigious New York ama-
teur Ski Club. He recognized the need for an 
organization that would supply first aid and 
rescue support at ski races and downhill skiing 
venues, so he established the National Ski 
Patrol in 1938 and served as its national direc-
tor until 1950. His leadership and vision al-
lowed for greater safety, accessibility, and en-
joyment in skiing. Thanks to Mr. Dole’s con-
tributions, the National Ski Patrol is the largest

rescue organization in the world, and its mem-
bers are world renowned. 
During World War II, Mr. Dole convinced the 
United States War Department that success 
against the Germans in the mountainous 
Italian terrain required troops trained in moun-
taineering. His persistence led to the formation 
of the United States Army Ski Troopers in the 
10th Mountain Division. After intense training 
in skiing and climbing, the 10th Mountain Divi-
sion deployed to Northern Italy and began a 
series of daring and successful assaults 
against the German army in the northern Ap-
ennine Mountains of Italy, proving Mr. Dole to 
be correct. 
Minnie Dole has made an indelible impact 
on the National Ski Patrol and the 10th Moun-
tain Division. On behalf of New York’s 21st 
Congressional District, I am honored to re-
member and celebrate the life of Minnie Dole. 
The contributions he has made to the safety 
and security of Americans through the 10th 
Mountain Division and the National Ski Patrol 
cannot be overstated.

CELEBRATING MR. ALVIN BROOKS’ 
90TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 3, 2022 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate and honor Mr. Alvin Brooks 
for his decades of service to Missouri’s Fifth 
Congressional District and to congratulate him 
on his most recent milestone: his 90th birth-
day. Having spent a lifetime advancing civil 
and human rights, Alvin Brooks is a Kansas 
City legend who has been recognized in both 
chambers of Congress. On this momentous 
occasion, it is once again worth reflecting on 
Al’s inspiring narrative. 
Born into poverty during the early years of 
the Great Depression, Alvin and his family 
struggled to make ends meet. Coming of age 
during a time when legal segregation was still 
yet to be declared unconstitutional, Alvin never 
forgot the lessons he learned while navigating 
the injustices of Jim Crow. Firsthand knowl-
edge of the country’s racial caste system, and 
the oppressive measures used to uphold it, 
generated within him a deep desire for justice 
and a strong sense of right and wrong. Alvin 
understood the importance of Black Americans 
being represented in all professional fields, 
particularly law and politics. It is only fitting, 
then, that he became one of Kansas City’s 
only Black police officers in the 1950s. Not 
only that, but he also founded the AdHoc 
Group Against Crime—a grassroots organiza-
tion dedicated to reducing violence, solving 
crimes, and bringing about healing—and later 
organized the city’s Human Relations Depart-
ment, making him the first Black department 
head in Kansas City government. 
Alvin continued to inspire. He was twice 
elected to City Council, served as the Mayor 
Pro Tem, and came within 851 votes of be-
coming Mayor of Kansas City, Missouri. Alvin 
chaired city’s the Public Safety Committee, the 
Police Capital Improvements Oversight Com-
mittee, the Police Site Selection Committee, 
and was vice-chair of the Aviation Committee 
and the Finance and Audit Committee. What-
ever his station, though, Alvin was always a 
man of the people. He opposed racism in all 
its forms, brought justice to the community, 
and prioritized fairness and equality. ‘‘Hate the 
sin, love the sinner’’—that is Alvin. Through it 
all, he kept his roots. His work in Kansas City, 
though, is demonstrative of the work we need 
to do in communities all across America. Jus-
tice, fairness, and human rights: these are nei-
ther specific to locale nor timeframe. They are 
universal and eternal. 
President George H.W. Bush appointed 
Alvin to the President’s National Drug Advisory 
Council. He was one of President Bush’s 
‘‘Thousand Points of Light,’’—a select group of 
Americans who were recognized for volun-
teering in cities and towns across the coun-
try—serving in that capacity for three years. 
Understanding the devastating impact that the 
influx of drugs inflicted on underserved com-
munities, Alvin worked tirelessly to steer oth-
ers away from substance abuse. Missouri 
Governor Jay Nixon appointed him to the Kan-
sas City Board of Police Commissioners, 
where he used his seat at the table to advo-
cate for the fair meting of justice. Alvin is also 
the fortysecond recipient of the Harry S. Tru-
man Award for Public Service, the highest 
honor awarded by the City of Independence, 
Missouri. His name is on that list along with 
some quite notable company: Jimmy Carter, 
Gerald Ford, and Bill Clinton, to name just a 
few. I would be remiss not to mention Alvin’s 
five honorary doctorates as well. 
Aside from the work itself and all the acco-
lades, Alvin has always sought to educate and 
inspire the next generation. He has served on 
boards of many community organizations, 
nonprofits, and businesses, sharing his knowl-
edge and experience. His work as a motiva-
tional speaker, lecturer, and conductor of sem-
inars and workshops has ensured that leaders 
in all fields are not only aware of how far our 
country has come, but of the work that still re-
mains. Indeed, his passion for education bears 
out in his work with universities throughout my 
district. The next generation has a great ex-
ample in Alvin, and his ninety years on Earth 
offer a gold mine of invaluable lessons. 
As we celebrate his 90th birthday and distin-
guished career, I hope my colleagues will join 
me in honoring Mr. Alvin Brooks. Here’s to 
many more.

RECOGNIZING VICTOR SIX HEALTH 
AND FITNESS ORGANIZATION 
HON. BRIAN K. FITZPATRICK 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 3, 2022 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize a groundbreaking Veterans’ 
Service Group in my District, Victor Six Health 
and Fitness Organization. Victor Six was 
founded by decorated Vietnam Veteran, David 
A. Christian, with the mission to improve the 
physical and mental health of Veterans in the 
community. 
On April 24, 2022, I had the honor of cele-
brating the graduation of Victor Six’s inaugural 
class. The course promoted the mutual im-
provement of the physical health and mental 
well-being of the Veterans, fulfilling the mantra 
that a strong body fuels a strong mind. This 
was made possible by a partnership with the 
Newtown Athletic Club, which graciously of-
fered their space, equipment, and personnel to 
the program. Nine Veterans, ranging from 39 
to 74 years of age, completed a rigorous 12– 
week physical training program. The nine Vet-
erans are: 
Ronald Warren Brand, United States Army 
Robert Peter Cassalia, United States Navy 
Daniel Marion Christian, United States Army

Participants completed pre- and post-as-
sessment measures of upper and lower body, 
core strength, cardio endurance, and flexibility 
as well as a self-evaluation of their mental sta-
tus. An individualized personal training plan for 
each Veteran was formulated by trainers 
based on their assessments. The Veterans 
were introduced to various private group exer-
cise classes such as aqua exercise, yoga, 
dance, strength, and cardio training. 
The program built camaraderie and esprit 
de corps by providing a safe haven from 
stressors and improving the mental well-being 
of all. In the continuing battle against Veteran 
and Servicemember suicide, organizations like 
Victor Six provide the tools necessary to fight 
back and give hope to our Nation’s heroes. 
We are incredibly grateful for the positive im-
pact that this organization has already had on 
our community.

the Long Branch Free Public Library in par-
ticular, supporting the New Jersey State Li-
brary’s IMLS Leadership Grant and nominating 
the Long Branch Free Public Library twice for 
the National Medal for Museum and Library 
Service. 
A Long Branch native currently residing in 
Neptune, New Jersey, Veronica Buffaloe- 
Stubbs is an active member of both commu-
nities and recognizes the importance of civic 
engagement. 
Ms. 
Buffaloe-Stubbs

Communications-Electronics Command and 
has previously worked as a youth counselor 
for the Monmouth County Juvenile Detention 
Center, substitute teacher and a certified 
nurse’s assistant/home health aide. 
Throughout 
her 
library 
career, 
Peggy 
Cadigan demonstrated a remarkable commit-
ment to her profession and the community. 
Recently retired from the New Jersey State Li-
brary after nearly 20 years as Deputy State Li-
brarian for Innovation, Ms. Cadigan previously 
served as a Reference Librarian and a Junior 
Library Assistant at the Ocean County Library. 
Her knowledge and experience were well-re-
garded in the field. She gave valuable presen-
tations throughout the United States and to re-
mote audiences abroad and served as a con-
sultant for the libraries of Dubai. Her vision, 
encouragement and support has helped other 
libraries improve their programs and adapt to 
societal changes and advancing technologies. 
Additionally, Ms. Cadigan expanded the Fresh 
Start re-entry program launched by the Long 
Branch Free Public Library. 
In her positions with the Long Branch Police 
Department, Sergeant Kimberly Leavy has 
been engaged in community programs. During 
her time as a Detective, she was focused on 
matters 
involving 
juveniles 
and 
currently 
serves in the Urban Enterprise Unit as a Com-
munity Police Officer in the Patrol Division. 
Through her role as a Community Police Offi-
cer and her work with National Night Out and 
the Citizens’ Police Academy, Sgt. Leavy con-
tinues to enhance the relationship between the 
community and the police force. She has 
served as a Liaison Officer for many commu-
nity organizations and has collaborated with 
the Long Branch School District and the Long 
Branch Free Public Library, promoting mutual 
programs and participating in educational 
presentations. 
Monmouth Medical Center continues to pro-
vide outstanding health care services to the 
greater Long Branch community and has been 
a valuable partner of the Long Branch Free 
Public Library. Working with Monmouth Med-
ical Center, in particular Eric Carney, CEO 
and President, Jean McKinney, Regional Di-
rector of Community Health, Social Impact and 
Community Investment, and Sylvia Jacobs, Di-
rector of Diversity and Inclusion, the Long 
Branch Free Public Library has expanded their 
programs and improved their community out-

Public libraries are an integral part of our 
communities, and it is my honor to join with 
the Long Branch Free Public Library in recog-
nizing the contributions of Senator CORY 
BOOKER, Veronica Buffaloe-Stubbs, Peggy 
Cadigan, Sergeant Kimberly Leavy and Mon-
mouth Medical Center.

HONORING THE LIFE OF RHONDA 
FERGUSON 
HON. DAVID P. JOYCE 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 3, 2022 
Mr. JOYCE of Ohio. Madam Speaker, it is 
with a heavy heart that I honor the life and 
memory of Rhonda Ferguson, and express my 
deepest condolences to her family, friends and 
colleagues. 
A Northeast Ohio native, Rhonda was an in-
credibly accomplished woman. She was the 
first in her family to graduate college, grad-
uating from Northwestern University with a de-
gree in Industrial Engineering. She then 
earned her Juris Doctorate from Case West-
ern Reserve University. It came as no surprise 
to those who knew her that Rhonda went on 
to have an extremely successful, storied ca-
reer. 
In 2019, Black Enterprise magazine named 
Rhonda one of the most powerful Black 
women in corporate America. The following 
year, she was hired as the Executive Vice 
President, Chief Legal Officer, General Coun-
sel and Secretary of the Allstate Corporation. 
Her colleagues warmly refer to her as a vi-
sionary force and a passionate friend, coach 
and mentor whose leadership helped ignite 
Allstate’s transformation and create societal 
impact. 
However, Rhonda’s legacy as a well-re-
spected mentor and trailblazer in the work-
place would be incomplete without her unwav-
ering commitment to her family. Rhonda cared 
deeply for her husband, Clayton, and their two 
children, Kristen and Clayton. I have no doubt 
that her memory will live on through all of 
them. 
Kelly and I offer our prayers and condo-
lences to Rhonda’s husband, their children, 
and her parents, as well as her extended fam-
ily and friends as they navigate their tragic 
loss during this difficult time. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in honoring 
the life and memory of Rhonda Ferguson.

INTRODUCTION OF THE RECOVER 
ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 3, 2022 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise to in-
troduce the Reducing the Effects of the 
Cyberattack on OPM Victims Emergency Re-
sponse Act of 2022, or the RECOVER Act, 
which would require the Office of Personnel 
Management (OPM) to make permanent the 
free identity protection coverage that Congress 
required OPM to provide for 10 years to indi-
viduals whose Social Security Numbers were 
potentially compromised during the OPM data 
breaches. In 2015, OPM reported that the per-
sonally identifiable information of as many as 
25.7 million current, former and prospective 
federal employees and contractors was stolen 
in two data breaches. I appreciate that Rep-
resentative C.A. DUTCH RUPPERSBERGER is co- 
leading on this bill. 
After OPM announced that it would offer 
identity protection coverage of limited duration 
and value, Senator BEN CARDIN and I intro-
duced the RECOVER Act in July 2015, which 
would have provided affected individuals life-
time protection and at least $5 million in iden-
tity theft insurance. Congress subsequently 
passed a version of our bill as part of an ap-
propriations bill, but limited the duration of the 
protection. Under current law, OPM is only re-
quired to provide identity protection coverage 
through fiscal year 2026. Under the bill I am 
introducing today, OPM would be required to 
provide coverage for the remainder of the lives 
of affected individuals. 
The current coverage is inadequate, particu-
larly considering that there is no limit to when 
the stolen data may be exploited. Therefore, 
there should be no limit on the duration of the 
coverage provided to affected individuals. This 
bill would give current, former and prospective 
federal employees and contractors who were 
affected both some peace of mind and protec-
tion. OPM failed to protect these people. It fol-
lows that the government must make up for its 
mistake. 
I urge my colleagues to support this impor-
tant bill.

RECOGNIZING MR. RALPH WHITE 
FOR 
HIS 
SERVICE 
TO 
THE 
UNITED STATES CONGRESS AND 
THE 
GOVERNMENT 
ACCOUNT-
ABILITY OFFICE (GAO) 
HON. ADAM SMITH 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 3, 2022 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, 
as the chairman of the House Armed Services 
Committee, I would like to recognize an out-
standing public servant, Mr. Ralph White, who 
has dedicated his career to providing bidders 
for government contracts with an expeditious 
means to seek accountability, and to maintain-
ing a high rate of effectiveness in the bid pro-
test process. Mr. White will retire on May 29, 
2022, after a distinguished, 39-year career in 
public service, including serving 33 years at 
the Government Accountability Office (GAO), 
where he is currently a Managing Associate 
General Counsel for the Procurement Law di-
vision. 
As a Senate staffer during the beginning of 
his career, Mr. White was instrumental in the 
drafting of the Competition in Contracting Act 
of 1984, which established the authority for 
GAO’s bid protest function, under which hun-
dreds of bid protests are filed each year. Mr. 
White joined GAO in 1989 as a writing attor-
ney/hearing officer in the Procurement Law di-
vision and was promoted in 2010 to lead a 
team of attorneys as an Assistant General 
Counsel. Since becoming a Managing Asso-
ciate General Counsel, responsible for GAO’s 
bid protest decision-making authority, Mr. 
White has successfully led GAO’s Procure-
ment Law division to resolve numerous large

and complicated bid protests with a consist-
ently high effectiveness rate and has been 
recognized by the government contracting 
community as a preeminent legal expert and 
trusted mentor. Mr. White is regularly sought 
out to speak and provide insights into the bid 
protest process throughout the government, 
academia, and industry. Throughout his ten-
ure, Mr. White has managed the resolution of 
protests related to nearly every aspect of fed-
eral procurement spending. His exceptional 
professionalism, integrity, and dedication have 
been 
recognized 
by 
numerous 
awards 
throughout his GAO career, including GAO’s 
Distinguished Service award in 2013 and the 
General Counsel’s Award in March 2010 for 
outstanding leadership. 
Under Mr. White’s leadership, the GAO bid 
protest process has increased public con-
fidence in the transparency, accountability, 
and functionality of the U.S. federal acquisition 
system. We thank him for his commitment and 
service to the Nation.

HONORING TEACHER 
APPRECIATION WEEK 
HON. NANETTE DIAZ BARRAGA´N 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 3, 2022 
Ms. BARRAGA´ N. Madam Speaker, in honor 
of Teacher Appreciation Week, I want to com-
mend and honor the extraordinary teachers in 
California’s 44th Congressional District and 
across the United States. 
Teacher Appreciation Week is an annual 
celebration of educators and the remarkable 
contributions they make in the lives of our stu-
dents, parents, schools, and communities. 
During the COVID–19 pandemic, our Na-
tion’s teachers innovated the education sys-
tem to create new ways to connect and care 
for their students during times of uncertainty 
during both remote and in-person learning. 
And our teachers have done all of this while 
they care for themselves and their own fami-
lies. 
Despite these challenges, teachers across 
the country continue to show up day after day 
to inspire, empower, and motivate their stu-
dents. 
I’d like to highlight two of my district’s ex-
traordinary 
teachers: 
Audrey 
Casas 
and 
Youko Amemiya and share a bit more about 
some of their accomplishments. 
Audrey Casas is a passionate, brilliant, and 
community-focused Teach for America teacher 
in Los Angeles. During the pandemic she no-
ticed some of her students and their families 
struggled to secure basic necessities, which 
led her to start working in the community to 
gather resources. Her success led to a non-
profit that she now runs in addition to her job 
teaching. She is passionate about student led 
practices and integrates many student-led 
projects into her teaching. Audrey’s classroom 
is a safe space for kids and is often packed 
at lunchtime with her students including the 
ones she doesn’t teach, to take part in ‘‘lunch 
club.’’ Some days the kids just hangout while 
they eat their personal lunches, and other 
days kids and their families will bring food to 
share. She constantly celebrates her students 
and fellow staff, from teachers to custodians to 
administrators, and is a known light on her 
campus, in her community, and in Lynwood. 
She was selected as Teacher of the Month by 
her students and her efforts were recognized 
by her school, district, and other regional news 
publications. 
Youko Amemiya is an enthusiastic and ac-
complished teacher in the City of Carson, who 
is dedicated to her students, her school, and 
her community. She has instilled a vision of 
climate awareness at her school site with the 
development of her school’s Roots and Shoots 
Club. At the beginning of the year, she wanted 
to teach her students about caring for the en-
vironment by planting 100 trees throughout the 
community in honor of the school’s 100-year 
anniversary. Her students and community ral-
lied behind her and helped to plant over 200 
trees. Mrs. Amemiya is also committed to 
helping beautify her school. Through her tire-
less work reaching out to community partners 
and applying to grants, she was able to se-
cure planters, benches, trees, soil, and various 
plants to make her school shine. She has 
been a positive influence on her classroom, 
her Roots and Shoots Club students, and the 
larger Carson community. 
These are just two of the teachers in my 
district who make a profound impact on their 
students. 
Teacher Appreciation Week is a time to cel-
ebrate the contributions of educators. 
It’s also a time to call for the policies and 
practices that will attract exceptional leaders to 
the teaching profession and support them 
throughout their career. 
We must break down the barriers that pre-
vent individuals from pursuing teaching ca-
reers and make concerted efforts to retain tal-
ented and effective teachers. 
We need to create the conditions which 
allow teachers to grow, lead, and truly thrive 
in their profession. 
And, in many instances—it means paying 
them higher salaries. We cannot prioritize our 
students, without prioritizing our teachers. 
So, on this occasion of Teacher Apprecia-
tion Week, to the teachers in my district, I 
thank them for leading with ingenuity, resil-
ience, and passion each and every day in 
their classrooms, and for their commitment to 
our students.

RECOGNIZING THE CAREER OF 
TONY DIMARE 
HON. CARLOS A. GIMENEZ 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 3, 2022 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the incredible career of my good 
friend Tony Dimare. Going back to my days as 
Mayor of Miami-Dade County, Tony has been 
a pillar of leadership in the agricultural com-
munity of South Florida for over thirty years 
and I am honored to join the Dade County 
Farm Bureau in recognizing him and all he 
has done for the agriculture industry. 
Tony Dimare began working for his family’s 
business in 1983 and has worked in the 
produce industry for nearly forty years. His 
family’s business, The Dimare Company, is a 
94-year-old family produce company four gen-
erations deep with operations in four states— 
Florida, California, Pennsylvania, and Texas. 
He has taken his family’s business to another 
level and has created countless jobs in South 
Florida and across the country. 
Along with bringing countless jobs to South 
Florida, Mr. Dimare serves on countless 
boards and does philanthropic work for South 
Florida. During the height of the COVID–19 
pandemic in 2020, one of the organizations he 
serves on hosted daily food drives to help 
families experiencing food insecurity in the 
Miami-Dade County area. Mr. Dimare has al-
ways proven to be an integral part of the com-
munity. 
I am always honored to recognize individ-
uals who spend their lives bringing invaluable 
services to the South Florida and District 26 
communities. Tony and I have worked to-
gether throughout the years, and I am certain 
he will continue to be a strong leader in the 
agricultural industry and in the community.

HONORING 
THE 
50TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE SAN MATEO COUN-
TY 
SILICON 
VALLEY 
CONVEN-
TION AND VISITORS BUREAU 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 3, 2022 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise to con-
gratulate the San Mateo County Silicon Valley 
Convention and Visitors Bureau on the 50th 
anniversary of its founding. It was 50 years 
ago that the Space Shuttle program was offi-
cially launched. It was fitting that the conven-
tion and visitors bureau began at that same 
time because the hope was to boost hotel oc-
cupancy to stratospheric levels, and to entice 
conventions to the fairgrounds in the City of 
San Mateo. It worked. 
As the local economy transitioned away 
from agriculture and towards high technology, 
the fairgrounds became the site of a national 
semiconductor 
convention—SEMICON—and 
since that time has hosted hundreds of busi-
ness and nonprofit events. Hotel rooms avail-
able in San Mateo County have exploded, 
from 81 hotels and 5,972 rooms in the Con-
vention and Visitors Bureau when it was first 
formed to 140 hotels and 15,794 rooms today. 
The economic impact of our visitor-serving 
industries is enormous. Pre-pandemic, the 
sector generated $4.5 billion in visitor spend-
ing and well over $500 million in local tax rev-
enue. It employed 45,000 people. The bureau 
doesn’t claim credit for all of these jobs or the 
money spent but given the reach of its pro-
motional efforts it certainly has an impact. For 
decades, the bureau represented its member-
ship at national shows dedicated to explaining 
to convention organizers the benefits of com-
ing to San Mateo County. Many conventions 
came and tens of thousands of tourists annu-
ally are typically greeted in their hotels and 
event locations by further promotional adver-
tisements for local attractions. 
The San Mateo County Silicon Valley Con-
vention and Visitors Bureau has been an in-
dispensable source of information for me dur-
ing the pandemic. Under the leadership of its 
outstanding President and CEO, John Hutar, 
the organization arranged for owners and 
managers to explain the steps they were tak-
ing to keep their doors open, or to avoid going 
into foreclosure, during the emergency. I was 
proud to be able to vote for the Paycheck Pro-
tection Program, EIDL loans and restaurant

relief, all of which nourished this sector when 
the pandemic threatened to permanently de-
stroy the industry in San Mateo County. For 
example, the Restaurant Revitalization Fund 
brought $214 million in relief to almost 500 
San Mateo County restaurants. I held many 
meetings with bureau members and listened 
closely as they explained their concerns. 
Madam Speaker, San Mateo County is the 
site of many amazing companies including 
those that discover new treatments for cancer 
or diabetes, program and design electric vehi-
cles, arrange electronic payments for trillions 
of dollars in transactions annually, and that 
provide amazing medical care to our entire 
population. Key to our local quality of life are 
our visitor-serving hotel and restaurant pro-
viders. Not only do they serve visitors, but 
they provide fine service to residents, and jobs 
for tens of thousands. It is my honor to recog-
nize those who help create jobs by shouting to 
the mountain tops the benefits of doing busi-
ness in San Mateo County. It is a testament 
to their skill that today they are financially sur-
viving and focusing on the next decades after 
the pandemic clears. I honor the men and 
women of the San Mateo County Silicon Val-
ley Convention and Visitors Bureau and their 
board of directors for giving their all on behalf 
of us all during a time that has tried us all. 
Bravo.
