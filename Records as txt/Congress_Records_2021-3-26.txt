way will be made clear. 
We pray in the abiding love of Your

Amen.

total annual cost of $4,105,500 for a lease 
term of up to 20 years, a prospectus for which 
is attached to and included in this resolu-
tion. 
Approval of this prospectus constitutes au-
thority to execute an interim lease for all 
tenants, if necessary, prior to the execution 
of the new lease. 
Provided that, the Administrator of General 
Services and tenant agency(ies) agree to 
apply an overall utilization rate of 174 square 
feet or less per person, except that, if the Ad-
ministrator determines that the overall uti-
lization rate cannot be achieved, the Admin-
istrator shall provide an explanatory state-
ment to the Committee on Transportation 
and Infrastructure of the House of Rep-
resentatives prior to exercising any lease au-
thority provided in this resolution. 
Provided that, except for interim leases as 
described above, the Administrator may not 
enter into any leases that are below pro-
spectus level for the purposes of meeting any 
of the requirements, or portions thereof, in-
cluded in the prospectus that would result in 
an overall utilization rate of 174 square feet 
or higher per person. 
Provided that, to the maximum extent 
practicable, the Administrator shall include 
in the lease contract(s) a purchase option 
that can be exercised at the conclusion of 
the firm term of the lease. 
Provided further, that the General Services 
Administration shall not delegate to any 
other agency the authority granted by this 
resolution. 
Provided further, that the Administrator 
shall require that the delineated area of the 
procurement is identical to the delineated 
area included in the prospectus, except that, 
if the Administrator determines that the de-
lineated area of the procurement should not

structure of the House of Representatives 
prior to exercising any lease authority pro-
vided in this resolution. 
Provided further, not later than 30 calendar 
days after the date on which a request from 
the Chair or Ranking Member of the Com-
mittee on Transportation and Infrastructure 
of the House of Representatives is received 
by the Administrator of General Services, 
the Administrator shall provide such Mem-
ber a response in writing that provides any 
information requested regarding the project. 
Provided further, the Administrator of Gen-
eral Services may not enter into this lease if 
it does not contain a provision barring any 
individual holding a Federally-elected office, 
regardless of whether such individual took 
office before or after execution of this lease, 
to directly participate in, or benefit from or 
under this lease or any part thereof and that 
such provision provide that if this lease is 
found to have been made in violation of the 
foregoing prohibition or it is found that this 
prohibition has been violated during the 
term of the lease, the lease shall be void, ex-
cept that the foregoing limitation shall not 
apply if the lease is entered into with a pub-
licly-held corporation or publicly-held entity 
for the general benefit of such corporation or 
entity. 
Provided further, prior to entering into this 
lease or approving a novation agreement in-
volving a change of ownership under this 
lease, the Administrator of General Services 
shall require the offeror or the parties re-
questing the novation, as applicable, to iden-
tify and disclose whether the owner of the 
leased space, including an entity involved in 
the financing thereof, is a foreign person or

such an instance, the Administrator of Gen-
eral Services shall notify the occupant agen-
cy(ies) in writing, and consult with such oc-
cupant agency(ies) regarding security con-
cerns and necessary mitigation measures (if 
any) prior to award of the lease or approval 
of the novation agreement. 
Provided that, to the maximum extent 
practicable, the Administrator of General 
Services shall require that the lease procure-
ment consider the availability of public 
transportation consistent with agency mis-
sion requirements and that the space to be 
leased be renovated for all cost effective im-
provements, including renewable energy up-
grades, water efficiency improvements, and 
indoor air quality optimization, that reduce

PROSPECTUS - LEASE 
DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY 
INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE 
SAN JOSE,CA 
Prospectus Number: 
PCA-01-SJ20 
Congressional District: CAI 7, 18, and 19 
Estimated Total Annual Cost3: 
$4,105,500 
Background 
The IRS mission is to provide America's taxpayers top quality service by helping them 
understand and meet their tax responsibilities and by applying the tax law with integrity 
and fairness to all. 
Justification 
This IRS field office fulfills a critical need to support the agency's m1ss10n and 
operational needs for the greater San Jose area. The field office executes reviews and 
audits of tax returns, appeal resolution, and other necessary compliance and enforcement 
activities. 
The current leases at 55 South Market Street in San Jose, CA, expire on March 19, 2023, 
and October 6, 2021. IRS requires continued housing to carry out its essential mission. 
Summary of Energy Compliance 
GSA will incorporate energy efficiency requirements into the Request for Lease 
Proposals and other documents related to the procurement of space based on the 
approved prospectus. GSA encourages offerors to exceed minimum requirements set 
forth in the procurement and to achieve an Energy Star performance rating of 75 or 
higher. 
Resolutions of Approval 
Resolutions adopted by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and 
the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works approving this prospectus will 
constitute approval to make appropriations to lease space in a facility that will yield the 
required rentable area. 
2 This estimate is for fiscal year 2023 and may be escalated by 2 percent annually to the e11ective date of the lease to 
account for inflation. The proposed rental rate is fully serviced including all operating expenses, whether paid by the 
lessor or directly by the Government. GSA will conduct the procurement using prevailing market rental rates as a 
benchmark for the evaluation of competitive offers and as the basis for negotiating with offerors to ensure that lease 
award is made in the best interest of the Government. 
3 New leases may contain an escalation clause to provide for annual changes in real estate taxes and operating costs.

benchmark for the evaluation of competitive offers and as the basis for negotiating with offcrors to ensure that lease 
award is made in the best interest of the Government.

In order to maximize the flexibility and competition in acquiring space for SSA, GSA 
may issue a single, multiple-award solicitation that will allow offerors to provide blocks 
of space able to meet requirements in whole or in part. All offers must provide space 
consistent with the delineated area defined by this prospectus. 
Background 
The mission of SSA is to deliver quality social security services to the public through the 
three programs it administers under the Social Security Act: the Old-Age and Survivors 
Insurance program, the Disability Insurance program, and the Supplemental Security 
Income program. SSA's Office of Hearing Operations (OHO) and Office of Analytics, 
Review, and Oversight (OARO) are two components responsible for holding hearings, 
issuing decisions, and reviewing appeals as part of SSA's process for determining 
whether a person may receive benefits. The Office of Retirement and Disability Policy 
(ORDP) is responsible for all major activities in the areas of strategic and program 
policy planning, policy research and evaluation, statistical programs, and overall 
policy development, analysis, and implementation. 
OHO is one of the largest administrative adjudication systems in the world and directs a 
nationwide field organization of administrative law judges (ALJ) who conduct impartial 
hearings and make decisions on appealed determinations involving retirement, survivors, 
disability, and supplemental security income benefits. OARO reviews ALJ decisions on 
appeal by claimants, or on its own motion, and processes cases appealed to Federal court. 
The OARO Office of Appellate Operations serves through the Appeals Council as the 
final level of administrative review for claimants appealing ALJ denials and dismissals of 
claims. The Office of Appellate Operations also collects and analyzes nationwide data on 
policy compliance of adjudicators and performance of the adjudication process. 
ORDP directs and manages the planning, development, issuance, and evaluation of 
operational policies, standards, and instructions for the Retirement and Survivors 
Insurance, Disability Insurance, Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, and 
other SSA programs.

Prospectus Number: PVA-0l-WA21 
Congressional District: MD 3, 4, 5, 6, 8

Justification 
SSA is currently housed at 5107 Leesburg Pike, Falls Church, VA; 2121 Crystal City 
Drive, Arlington, VA; and 250 E. Street SW, Washington, DC, in leases that expire on 
September 30, 2024, October 24, 2024, and January 22, 2029, respectively. SSA requires 
continued housing to carry out its mission. Combining these components into one 
location will allow SSA to take advantage of economies of scale and shared common 
space, and significantly reduces the overall footprint and rent of the agency. 
Co-location of SSA entities into a single location allows for synergy of mission and 
captures economies of scale. The proposed requirement incorporates SSA's new 
housing space standards in addition to resource sharing, yielding a 48-percent 
reduction in the amount of total space and a SO-percent improvement in overall 
utilization rate. Depending on the location, SSA's estimated rental expenses will be 
reduced by up to $5.3 million annually. 
Summary of Energy Compliance 
GSA will incorporate energy efficiency requirements into the Request for Lease 
Proposals and other documents related to the procurement of space based on the 
approved prospectus. GSA encourages offerors to exceed minimum requirements set 
forth in the procurement and to achieve an Energy Star performance rating of 75 or 
higher. 
Resolutions of Approval 
Resolutions adopted by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and 
the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works approving this prospectus will 
constitute approval to make appropriations to lease space in a facility that will yield the 
required rentable area. 
Interim Leasing 
GSA will execute such interim leasing actions as are necessary to ensure continued 
housing of the tenant agency prior to the effective date of the new lease. It is in the best 
interest of the Government to avert the financial risk of holdover tenancy.

annual cost of $9,864,821 for a lease term of 
up to 20 years, a prospectus for which is at-
tached to and included in this resolution. 
Approval of this prospectus constitutes au-
thority to execute an interim lease for all

of the new lease. 
Provided that, the Administrator of General 
Services and tenant agency(ies) agree to 
apply an overall utilization rate of 162 square 
feet or less per person, except that, if the Ad-
ministrator determines that the overall uti-
lization rate cannot be achieved, the Admin-
istrator shall provide an explanatory state-
ment to the Committee on Transportation 
and Infrastructure of the House of Rep-
resentatives prior to exercising any lease au-
thority provided in this resolution. 
Provided that, except for interim leases as 
described above, the Administrator may not 
enter into any leases that are below pro-
spectus level for the purposes of meeting any 
of the requirements, or portions thereof, in-
cluded in the prospectus that would result in 
an overall utilization rate of 162 square feet 
or higher per person. 
Provided that, to the maximum extent 
practicable, the Administrator shall include 
in the lease contract(s) a purchase option 
that can be exercised at the conclusion of 
the firm term of the lease. 
Provided further, that the General Services 
Administration shall not delegate to any 
other agency the authority granted by this 
resolution. 
Provided further, that the Administrator 
shall require that the delineated area of the 
procurement is identical to the delineated 
area included in the prospectus, except that, 
if the Administrator determines that the de-
lineated area of the procurement should not 
be identical to the delineated area included 
in the prospectus, the Administrator shall 
provide an explanatory statement to the 
Committee on Transportation and Infra-
structure of the House of Representatives 
prior to exercising any lease authority pro-
vided in this resolution. 
Provided further, not later than 30 calendar 
days after the date on which a request from 
the Chair or Ranking Member of the Com-
mittee on Transportation and Infrastructure 
of the House of Representatives is received 
by the Administrator of General Services, 
the Administrator shall provide such Mem-
ber a response in writing that provides any 
information requested regarding the project. 
Provided further, the Administrator of Gen-
eral Services may not enter into this lease if 
it does not contain a provision barring any 
individual holding a Federally-elected office, 
regardless of whether such individual took 
office before or after execution of this lease, 
to directly participate in, or benefit from or 
under this lease or any part thereof and that 
such provision provide that if this lease is 
found to have been made in violation of the 
foregoing prohibition or it is found that this 
prohibition has been violated during the 
term of the lease, the lease shall be void, ex-
cept that the foregoing limitation shall not 
apply if the lease is entered into with a pub-
licly-held corporation or publicly-held entity 
for the general benefit of such corporation or 
entity. 
Provided further, prior to entering into this 
lease or approving a novation agreement in-
volving a change of ownership under this 
lease, the Administrator of General Services 
shall require the offeror or the parties re-
questing the novation, as applicable, to iden-
tify and disclose whether the owner of the 
leased space, including an entity involved in 
the financing thereof, is a foreign person or 
a foreign-owned entity; provided further, in 
such an instance, the Administrator of Gen-
eral Services shall notify the occupant agen-
cy(ies) in writing, and consult with such oc-
cupant agency(ies) regarding security con-
cerns and necessary mitigation measures (if 
any) prior to award of the lease or approval 
of the novation agreement. 
Provided that, to the maximum extent 
practicable, the Administrator of General 
Services shall require that the lease procure-
ment consider the availability of public 
transportation consistent with agency mis-
sion requirements and that the space to be 
leased be renovated for all cost effective im-
provements, including renewable energy up-
grades, water efficiency improvements, and 
indoor air quality optimization, that reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions.

Background

INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE 
COVINGTON, KY 
PBS 
Prospectus Number: PKY-0 l -CO2 l 
Congressional District: 
4 
The IRS's mission is to provide America's taxpayers top quality service by helping them 
understand and meet their tax responsibilities and by applying the tax law with integrity 
and fairness to all. Based on the tax laws passed by Congress, the IRS' s role is to help 
the large majority of compliant taxpayers with the tax law, while ensuring that the 
minority who are unwilling to comply do pay their fair share. 
The Gateway Center leased buildings primarily house IRS's Accounts Management 
Group as well as a large call site operation. Originally, these buildings functioned as 
support to the federally owned IRS Service Center located at 200 W. 4th Street. In 
September 2016, IRS decided to downsize their agency footprint by ramping down 
operations in various cities, including the federally owned Covington Service Center 
facility. 
IRS vacated the Service Center facility at the end of December 2019. The 
remaining operations from this facility were absorbed into their space within the Gateway 
Center and Gateway Center West leased buildings as well as their IRS Annex lease 
located at 7940 Kentucky Drive in Florence, KY. 
Justification 
Due to the existing level of adequate available space, dock facilities, parking, and 
advantageous proximity to major highways and interstates, as well as the anticipated high 
cost to relocate security, modernization and information technology services, furniture 
and equipment, and a large quantity of files and documents, GSA will consider whether 
IRS's continued housing needs should be satisfied in the existing location based on an 
analysis of other potential locations in the delineated area. If other potential locations are 
identified, a cost-benefit analysis will be conducted to determine whether the 
Government can expect to recover the relocation and duplication costs of real and 
personal property needed for IRS to accomplish its mission. 
The current lease located in Gateway Center at 333 Scott Street and in Gateway Center 
West at 3rd and Madison Avenue in Covington, expires on July 31, 2024. IRS requires 
continued housing to carry out its mission. 
Summary of Energy Compliance 
GSA will incorporate energy efficiency requirements into the Request for Lease 
Proposals and other documents related to the procurement of space based on the 
approved prospectus. GSA encourages offerors to exceed minimum requirements set 
forth in the procurement and to achieve an Energy Star performance rating of 75 or 
higher.

COMMITTEE RESOLUTION 
LEASE—U.S. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS 
AFFAIRS, OAHU, HI 
Resolved by the Committee on Transportation 
and Infrastructure of the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives, that pursuant to 40 U.S.C. § 3307, 
appropriations are authorized for a lease of 
up to 66,000 net usable square feet of space, 
including 528 official parking spaces, for the 
U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs cur-
rently located at the Tripler Army Medical 
Center in Oahu, HI, at a proposed total 
unserviced annual cost of $5,931,083 for a 
lease term of up to 15 years, a prospectus for 
which is attached to and included in this res-
olution. This resolution amends the author-
ization of the Committee on February 28, 
2017, of Prospectus No. PHI–01–VA17. 
Approval of this prospectus constitutes au-
thority to execute an interim lease for all 
tenants, if necessary, prior to the execution 
of the new lease. 
Provided that, to the maximum extent 
practicable, the Administrator shall include 
in the lease contract(s) a purchase option 
that can be exercised at the conclusion of 
the firm term of the lease. 
Provided further, that the Administrator 
shall require that the delineated area of the 
procurement is identical to the delineated 
area included in the prospectus, except that, 
if the Administrator determines that the de-
lineated area of the procurement should not 
be identical to the delineated area included 
in the prospectus, the Administrator shall 
provide an explanatory statement to the 
Committee on Transportation and Infra-
structure of the House of Representatives 
prior to exercising any lease authority pro-
vided in this resolution. 
Provided further, not later than 30 calendar 
days after the date on which a request from

Prospectus Number: PHI-01-V A2 l 
Congressional District:

Executive Summary 
The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) proposes to amend prospectus PHI-01-
VAl 7, which proposed a lease of up to 66,000 net usable square feet (NUSF) for an 
outpatient clinic lease for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), in Oahu, HI. 
The Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works and the House Committee on 
Transportation and Infrastructure approved the original prospectus on November 29, 
2017, and February 29, 2017. This amended prospectus seeks authority to lease the 
previously approved space at a higher rental rate for a shorter period of time. The lease 
will enable the VA Pacific Island Health Care System to more efficiently provide 
services to veterans located on the island.

need to provide ongoing primary, mental health, and specialty care services to veterans 
residing in those areas. 
The proposed lease will address utilization and space gaps at the current facility and will 
support major VA initiatives identified by the VA Secretary including: improve veterans' 
mental health, experience, and access to health care; enable 2ist century benefits; and 
establish strong VA management infrastructure and integrated operating model and 
health informatics. 
By consolidating the existing Veterans Health Administration clinic, Veterans Benefits 
Administration regional office, and VA Veterans Center in the Ewa Plain of Oahu, the 
proposed lease enables the VA Pacific Island Health Care System (V APIHCS) to more 
efficiently provide services to veterans located on the island. In addition, the new facility 
will decompress the VA Spark M. Matsunaga Medical Center and provide space for 
interdisciplinary team delivery, integration of services into the treatment plan, and 
optimization of health and wellness. 
Providing service in this region improves access to care for veterans by reducing wait and 
drive times, and enables VA to meet all current and projected demand for services. 
Additionally, the proposed lease will educate and empower minority and woman veterans 
through effective outreach, education, and monitoring of the provision of VA benefits 
and services. The Ewa Plain/Leeward, central, and north shore areas of Oahu contain 
many minority and woman veterans that will be served through specified and tailored 
programs that bring awareness to the entitlement of benefits and conduct targeted 
outreach programs. 
This project was initially approved as part of VA's 2014 budget request and was 
subsequently authorized by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure 
and the Senate Committee on the Environment and Public Works in 2017. After 
completing requirements development and market analysis, VA's attempts at 
procurement were unsuccessful as all offers were above the approved maximum rental 
rate. Approval of this amended prospectus would allow VA to award a lease under an 
active solicitation. 
Summary of Energy Compliance 
Energy efficiency requirements will be incorporated into any proposed contract and other 
documents related to the procurement of space based on the approved prospectus. 
Offerors are encouraged to exceed minimum requirements set forth in the procurement 
and to achieve an Energy Star performance rating of 75 or higher.

Acquisition Strategy 
ln order to maximize the flexibility and competition in acquiring space for the NPS, GSA 
may issue a single, multiple-award solicitation that will allow offerors to provide blocks 
of space able to meet requirements in whole or in part. All offers must provide space 
consistent with the delineated area defined by this prospectus. 
Background 
The NPS mission is to preserve unimpaired the natural and cultural resources and values 
of the National Park System for the enjoyment, education, and inspiration of this and 
future generations. NPS cooperates with partners to extend the benefits of natural and 
cultural resource conservation and outdoor recreation throughout this country and the 
world. 
Justification 
NPS requires continued housing in Lakewood, CO, to carry out its mission. The lease 
will house three primary divisions: 
lntermountain Region (IMR): IMR oversees documentation of structures and sites 
recorded in Arizona, Colorado, Montana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, and 
Wyoming. 
Washington Support Office (WASO): The NPS national headquarters and support 
centers are collectively called the Washington Support Office (WASO). Employees 
at WASO provide services to the regional office, park units, program areas, and NPS 
partners, as well as coordinate with other agencies and bureaus in the Department of 
the Interior. W ASO supports the NPS mission at the national level by providing 
2 This estimate is for fiscal year 2024 and may be escalated by 2 percent annually to the effective date of the lease to 
account for inflation. The proposed rental rate is fully serviced including all operating expenses, whether paid by the 
lessor or directly by the Government. GSA will conduct the procurement using prevailing market rental rates as a 
benchmark for the evaluation of competitive offers and as the basis for negotiating with offerors to ensure that lease 
award is made in the best interest of the Government. 
3 New leases may contain an escalation clause to provide for annual changes in real estate taxes and operating costs.

leadership and advocacy, policy and regulatory formulation and direction, program 
guidance, budget formulation, legislative support, and accountability for programs 
and activities managed by the field and key program offices. It manages service-
wide programs that can most effectively be carried out from a central location. 
Denver Service Center (DSC): DSC is the central planning, design, and construction 
management project office for NPS. DSC provides park and community planning, 
design and construction project management, transportation planning, contracting 
services, and technical information management for the parks and regions in the 
national park system. 
The proposed lease will ensure continuity of operations for NPS while consolidating two 
separate leases and reducing the space requirement by approximately 29,000 RSF. NPS 
is currently housed at 12795 Alameda Parkway in Lakewood, CO, and 7333 W Jefferson 
Avenue in Lakewood, CO, in leases that expire September 30, 2024, and September 15, 
2022. 
Summary of Energy Compliance 
GSA will incorporate energy efficiency requirements into the Request for Lease 
Proposals and other documents related to the procurement of space based on the 
approved prospectus. GSA encourages offerors to exceed minimum requirements set 
forth in the procurement and to achieve an Energy Star performance rating of 75 or 
higher. 
Resolutions of Approval 
Resolutions adopted by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and 
the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works approving this prospectus will 
constitute approval to make appropriations to lease space in a facility that will yield the 
required rentable area. 
Interim Leasing 
GSA will execute such interim leasing actions as are necessary to ensure continued 
housing of the tenant agency prior to the effective date of the new lease. It is in the best 
interest of the Government to avert the financial risk of holdover tenancy.

nual cost of $3,845,600 for a lease term of up 
to 20 years, a prospectus for which is at-
tached to and included in this resolution. 
Approval of this prospectus constitutes au-
thority to execute an interim lease for all 
tenants, if necessary, prior to the execution 
of the new lease. 
Provided that, the Administrator of General 
Services and tenant agency(ies) agree to 
apply an overall utilization rate of 240 square 
feet or less per person, except that, if the Ad-
ministrator determines that the overall uti-
lization rate cannot be achieved, the Admin-
istrator shall provide an explanatory state-
ment to the Committee on Transportation 
and Infrastructure of the House of Rep-
resentatives prior to exercising any lease au-
thority provided in this resolution. 
Provided that, except for interim leases as 
described above, the Administrator may not 
enter into any leases that are below pro-
spectus level for the purposes of meeting any 
of the requirements, or portions thereof, in-
cluded in the prospectus that would result in 
an overall utilization rate of 240 square feet 
or higher per person. 
Provided that, to the maximum extent 
practicable, the Administrator shall include 
in the lease contract(s) a purchase option 
that can be exercised at the conclusion of 
the firm term of the lease. 
Provided further, that the General Services 
Administration shall not delegate to any 
other agency the authority granted by this 
resolution. 
Provided further, that the Administrator 
shall require that the delineated area of the

if the Administrator determines that the de-
lineated area of the procurement should not

structure of the House of Representatives 
prior to exercising any lease authority pro-
vided in this resolution. 
Provided further, not later than 30 calendar

regardless of whether such individual took 
office before or after execution of this lease, 
to directly participate in, or benefit from or 
under this lease or any part thereof and that 
such provision provide that if this lease is 
found to have been made in violation of the 
foregoing prohibition or it is found that this 
prohibition has been violated during the 
term of the lease, the lease shall be void, ex-
cept that the foregoing limitation shall not 
apply if the lease is entered into with a pub-
licly-held corporation or publicly-held entity 
for the general benefit of such corporation or 
entity. 
Provided further, prior to entering into this 
lease or approving a novation agreement in-
volving a change of ownership under this 
lease, the Administrator of General Services 
shall require the offeror or the parties re-
questing the novation, as applicable, to iden-
tify and disclose whether the owner of the

eral Services shall notify the occupant agen-
cy(ies) in writing, and consult with such oc-
cupant agency(ies) regarding security con-
cerns and necessary mitigation measures (if 
any) prior to award of the lease or approval 
of the novation agreement. 
Provided that, to the maximum extent 
practicable, the Administrator of General 
Services shall require that the lease procure-
ment consider the availability of public 
transportation consistent with agency mis-
sion requirements and that the space to be 
leased be renovated for all cost effective im-
provements, including renewable energy up-
grades, water efficiency improvements, and 
indoor air quality optimization, that reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions.

1.20 is used for the estimated proposed maximum RSF as indicated in the housing plan. 
2 This estimate is for fiscal year 2022 and may be escalated by 2% percent annually to the effective date of the lease to 
account for inflation. The proposed rental rate is fully serviced including all operating expenses, whether paid by the 
lessor or directly by the Government. GSA will conduct the procurement using prevailing market rental rates as a 
benchmark for the evaluation of competitive otlers and as the basis for negotiating with ofterors to ensure that lease 
award is made in the best interest of the Government. 
3 New leases may contain an escalation clause to provide for annual changes in real estate taxes and operating costs.

PCA-0 l -SF2 l

Nationwide, SEC's mission is to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient 
markets, and facilitate capital formation. SEC oversees key participants in the securities 
world, including securities exchanges, securities brokers and dealers, investment 
advisors, and mutual funds. The agency's primary concern is promoting the disclosure of 
important market-related information, maintaining fair dealing, and protecting against 
fraud. Crucial to SEC's effectiveness in each of these areas is its enforcement authority. 
Each year SEC brings hundreds of civil enforcement actions against individuals and 
companies for violation of the securities laws. Typical infractions include insider trading, 
accounting fraud, and providing false or misleading information about securities and the 
companies that issue them. 
SEC oversees and regulates the U.S. securities markets; SEC also works closely with 
many other institutions, including Congress, other Federal departments and agencies, the 
self-regulatory organizations (e.g. the stock exchanges), State securities regulators, and 
various private-sector organizations. SEC has approximately 4,600 staff located in 
Washington, DC, and in 11 regional offices throughout the country. 
The San Francisco Regional Office (SFRO) has jurisdiction in Washington, Oregon, 
Alaska, Montana, Idaho, and Northern California. The SFRO staff includes accountants, 
attorneys, examiners, paralegals, and other professionals who are responsible for the 
regulation, examination, enforcement, and oversight of the securities industry, securities 
markets, and the financial services industry. 
Justification 
SEC is currently housed at 44 Montgomery Street in San Francisco, CA, in a delegated 
lease that expires January 31, 2022. SEC requires continued housing to carry out its 
mission and needs to be located in the Financial District of San Francisco as the agency 
interacts with the investing public, other financial services regulators, self-regulatory 
organizations (SRO), and other professionals. 
Summary of Energy Compliance 
GSA will incorporate energy efficiency requirements into the Request for Lease 
Proposals and other documents related to the procurement of space based on the 
approved prospectus. GSA encourages offerors to exceed minimum requirements set 
forth in the procurement and to achieve an Energy Star performance rating of 75 or 
higher.

The mission of DOJ is to enforce the law and defend the interests of the United States 
according to the law; to ensure public safety against threats foreign and domestic; to 
provide Federal leadership in preventing and controlling crime; to seek just punishment 
for those guilty of unlawful behavior; and to ensure fair and impartial administration of 
justice for all Americans. 
Both the Antitrust Division and the Civil Division report to the Associate Attorney 
General. The mission of the Antitrust Division is to promote economic competition 
through enforcing and providing guidance on antitrust laws and principles. The DOJ 
Civil Division represents the United States, its departments and agencies, Members of 
Congress, Cabinet Officers, and other Federal employees in any civil or criminal matter 
within its scope of responsibility. The Civil Division's responsibilities include ensuring 
the Federal Government speaks with one voice in its view of the law; preserving the 
intent of Congress; advancing the credibility of the Government before the courts; and 
protecting the public fisc (i.e., the U.S. Treasury). 
Justification 
DOJ's Antitrust Division and Civil Division are currently housed at 450 Fifth St. NW in a 
lease that expires January 11, 2023. These DOJ components require continued housing to 
carry out their missions. 
Summary of Energy Compliance 
GSA will incorporate energy efficiency requirements into the Request for Lease 
Proposals and other documents related to the procurement of space based on the 
approved prospectus. GSA encourages offerors to exceed minimum requirements set 
forth in the procurement and to achieve an Energy Star performance rating of 75 or 
higher.

The U.S. Attorneys serve as the Nation's principal litigators under the direction of the 
Attorney General. There are 93 U.S. Attorneys stationed throughout the United States, 
Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands. U.S. Attorneys 
are appointed by, and serve at the discretion of, the President of the United States, with 
the advice and consent of the United States Senate. U.S. Attorneys conduct most of the 
trial work in which the United States is a party. They have three statutory responsibilities 
under title 28, section 54 7 of the United States Code: 
-
the prosecution of criminal cases brought by the Federal Government; 
the prosecution and defense of civil cases in which the United States is a party; 
and 
-
the collection of debts owed the Federal Government that are administratively 
uncollectible. 
Each office deals with every category of cases and handles a mixture of simple and 
complex litigation, and each U.S. Attorney exercises wide discretion in the use of his or 
her resources to further the priorities of the local jurisdictions and needs of their 
communities. 
This location houses the offices of the Civil Division of the Southern District of New 
York. The District prosecutes cases involving violations of Federal laws and represents 
the interests of the United States Government and its agencies in criminal and civil 
matters. The District also investigates and prosecutes a broad array of criminal conduct of 
every conceivable magnitude, including terrorism, white collar and cybercrime, mortgage 
fraud, public corruption, gang violence, organized crime, international narcotics 
trafficking and civil rights violations. Similarly, the Office litigates among the most 
complex and significant civil cases the Department of Justice handles-from large 
affirmative civil fraud cases to cases in the environmental, health care, immigration and 
bankruptcy areas, as well as cases implicating classified information. 
Justification 
USAO is currently housed at 86 Chambers Street, New York, NY, in a lease that expires 
December 31, 2023. The District requires continued housing for the Civil Division to 
carry out its mission until it can execute a long-term relocation to the Jacob K. Javits 
Federal Building, which is being renovated as part of a separate prospectus.

Parkway in Chantilly, VA, and at 2675 Prosperity Avenue in Merrifield, VA, since 
2/1/2002 and 8/24/2015, respectively, under two leases that expire in 2022 and 2025. 
The new lease will provide continued housing for DEA and much needed expansion 
space and will maintain adequate utilization rates, although the office and overall space 
utilization rates will increase slightly from 73 to 90 and 130 to 158 usable square feet

DEA's mission is to enforce the controlled substances laws and regulations of the United 
States and bring to the criminal and civil justice system of the United States, or any other 
competent jurisdiction, those organizations and principal members of organizations 
involved in the growing, manufacture, or distribution of controlled substances appearing 
in or destined for illicit traffic in the United States; and to recommend and support non-
enforcement programs aimed at reducing the availability of illicit controlled substances 
on the domestic and international markets. 
Justification 
DEA is currently housed at 14560 Avion Parkway in Chantilly, VA, and 2675 Prosperity 
Avenue, Merrifield, VA, in two leases that expire on 1/31/2022 and 8/23/2025, 
respectively. DEA requires continued housing to carry out its mission. This project 
proposes to consolidate these groups with additional DEA and law enforcement entities 
currently housed within small blocks of space at multiple locations throughout the 
National Capital Region. 
The current facilities do not have the space to conduct mission-critical operational and 
coordination meetings. The increased footprint includes the meeting, office, and support 
space to address this space need and enable coordinated investigative operations with 
local, State, Federal, and international entities. 
Summary of Energy Compliance 
GSA will incorporate energy efficiency requirements into the Request for Lease 
Proposals and other documents related to the procurement of space based on the 
3 This estimate is for fiscal year FY 2022 and may be escalated by 2 percent annually to the effective date of the lease 
to account for inflation. The proposed rental rate is fully serviced including all operating expenses, whether paid by the 
lessor or directly by the Government. GSA will conduct the procurement using prevailing market rental rates as a 
benchmark for the evaluation of competitive offers and as the basis for negotiating with offerors to ensure that lease 
award is made in the best interest of the Government. 
4 New leases may contain an escalation clause to provide for annual changes in real estate taxes and operating costs.

In order to maximize the flexibility and competition in acquiring space for the VBA, 
GSA may issue a single, multiple-award solicitation that will allow offerors to provide 
blocks of space able to meet requirements in whole or in part. All offers must provide 
space consistent with the delineated area defined by this prospectus. 
Background 
VBA's mission is to provide benefits and services to veterans and their families and 
survivors in a responsive, timely, and compassionate manner in recognition of their 
service to the Nation. 
VBA serves as a leading advocate for service members, veterans, their families and 
survivors through nine different major program offices: Compensation Service; Pension 
and Fiduciary Service; Insurance Service; Education Service; Loan Guaranty Service; 
Office of Transition and Economic Development; vocational Rehabilitation and 
Employment Service; Office of Field Operations; and Appeals Management Center. 
Justification 
The Phoenix VBA Regional Office (V ARO) currently occupies 95,558 RSF at 3333 
North Central Avenue under a lease delegated to the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
VARO administers a wide array of benefits to our Nation's veterans in the Phoenix area, 
as well as assisting with claims nationally. VARO currently houses Education Service, 
Loan Guaranty, Pacific District Office, Veteran Service Center and Vocational 
Rehabilitation. The National Call Center (NCC) occupies a separate lease location at 
3838 North Central Avenue 
The VBA delegated lease currently expires on May 31, 2023. The separate National Call 
Center lease expires on February 19, 2023. VBA requires continued housing to carry out 
its mission. This project will consolidate these two leases (V ARO and NCC) and allow 
VBA to meet updated space needs and standards.

Justification 
PROSPECTUS - LEASE 
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 
NORTHERN, VA 
Prospectus Number: 
PVA-03-WA21 
Congressional District: 
V A-8, 10, 11 
EPA currently occupies 264,935 RSF of space at the Potomac Yard complex, 2777 Crystal 
Drive, Arlington, Virginia. There is also approximately 61,122 RSF of space currently vacant. 
This space will remain in the extension as it will not be subdivided in the short term. 
EPA has been planning, realigning offices, and relocating nearly 3,000 employees within the 
Federal Triangle in order to make room for the approximately 1,000 employees moving from 
Potomac Yard. The employee relocation through weekly moves and decommissioning at 
Potomac Yard was scheduled to be completed by February 2021, in time for lease expiration. 
However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and surrounding events, the current schedule has been 
significantly delayed. 
Adequate time is required to prepare the spaces within Federal Triangle for occupancy, including 
thorough cleaning and equipment moves; and due to the mandatory telework orders stemming 
from the pandemic, the weekly moves have been put on hold indefinitely. Accordingly, a lease 
extension will be necessary to avoid a holdover situation at the leased location and to provide 
EPA with continued housing to carry out its mission until relocation to Federal space is 
complete. 
Resolutions of Approval 
Resolutions adopted by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and the 
Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works approving this prospectus will constitute 
approval to make appropriations to lease space in a facility that will yield the required rentable 
area. 
Interim Leasing 
GSA will execute such interim leasing actions as are necessary to ensure continued housing of 
the tenant agency prior to the effective date of the extension. It is in the best interest of the 
Government to avert the financial risk of holdover tenancy.

JEFFERSONVILLE, IN 
Prospectus Number: PIN-01-JE21

Acquisition Strategy 
In order to maximize the flexibility and competition in acquiring space for the Census, 
GSA may issue a single, multiple-award solicitation that will allow offerors to provide 
blocks of space able to meet requirements in whole or in part. All offers must provide 
space consistent with the delineated area defined by this prospectus. 
Background 
Census is an integral part of the Department of Commerce, and a principal agency of the 
Federal Statistical System of the United States. The mission of Census is to serve as the 
leading source of quality data about the Nation's people and economy. Census honors 
privacy, protects confidentiality, shares its expertise globally, and conducts its work 
openly. Census is guided on this mission by its strong and capable workforce, its 
readiness to innovate, and its abiding commitment to its customers. 
Justification 
This location is the National Processing Center (NPC) for Census. NPC is the agency's 
primary 
center for 
mail 
processing, 
survey 
processing, 
data 
capture, 
and 
imaging/scanning. Census has a Contact Center that responds to caller inquiries and 
conducts telephone interviews. The agency collects and processes monthly, quarterly, and 
annual surveys that include demographic data, population statistics, economic indicators, 
housing statistics, business, construction, and foreign trade information, as well as other 
information. Some of the activities Census engages in are: the Decennial Census, the 
Economic Census, and the Census of Governments. Information collected from these 
studies allow for the distribution of more than $675 billion in Federal funds. The NPC 
supports Census operations in all states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and all 
U.S. territories. Without the National Processing Center, Census would be unable to 
fulfill its mission. 
Census is currently located in a Federal facility that dates back to the American Civil 
War, is comprised of approximately ten buildings creating inefficiencies, and does not 
meet the agency's current needs. Significant investment in the Federal facility would be 
required for it to meet Census's long-term needs. The relocation of Census will allow for 
the disposal of the Federal facility and allow GSA to avoid approximately $50 million in 
repair and alteration in short term and ten year investment liabilities.

Summary of Energy Compliance 
GSA will incorporate energy efficiency requirements into the Request for Lease 
Proposals and other documents related to the procurement of space based on the 
approved prospectus. GSA encourages offerors to exceed minimum requirements set 
forth in the procurement and to achieve an Energy Star performance rating of 75 or 
higher. 
Resolutions of Approval 
Resolutions adopted by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and 
the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works approving this prospectus will 
constitute approval to make appropriations to lease space in a facility that will yield the 
required rentable area. 
Interim Leasing 
GSA will execute such interim leasing actions as are necessary to ensure continued 
housing of the tenant agency prior to the effective date of the new lease. It is in the best 
interest of the Government to avert the financial risk of holdover tenancy. 
Certification of Need 
The proposed project is the best solution to meet a validated Government need.

HONORING BETH BARTKE AS THE 
2020 WOMAN OF THE YEAR 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 26, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Beth Bartke, 
whom I have named the 2020 Woman of the 
Year in Contra Costa County, California. 
Woman of the Year recognizes women who 
have made important contributions to Califor-
nia’s 5th Congressional District in Arts and 
Culture, Professional Achievement, Entrepre-
neurship and Innovation or Community Serv-
ice. 
Although she is proud to call Martinez 
home, Mrs. Bartke was born in Pasadena and 
spent most of her youth in San Fernando and 
Santa Rosa, initially coming to our district to 
pursue a degree in elementary education from 
Sonoma State University. She could not bring 
herself to leave its natural beauty and tight 
knit community, choosing to settle in the dis-
trict permanently. 
Dedicating her time and effort to the com-
munity she holds dear; she served on the Her-
cules City Council from 1992 to 1996 and was 
a ten-year board member for the Commis-
sioner’s Advisory Panel for the Rodeo-Her-
cules Fire Protection District and a thirteen 
year employee of the Pinole Police Depart-
ment. Even in her retirement, Mrs. Bartke is 
committed to public safety and regularly volun-
teers with both the Pinole and Martinez Police 
Departments while simultaneously working to 
enhance community recognition and apprecia-
tion of our first responders throughout the dis-
trict. 
Beyond the time she gives to city govern-
ment, Mrs. Bartke also works with our commu-
nity’s homeless population, operating showers 
and serving meals to a multitude of non-prof-
its. She also participates in the torch relay for 
the Special Olympics, a tradition she carries 
on every June. Mrs. Bartke is relentless in al-
ways finding a way to serve our community. 
Mrs. Bartke’s selflessness and commitment 
to service can in part be attributed to her faith. 
The Bartke Family are members of the Creek-
side Church and the tenets of Mrs. Bartke’s 
faith have guided her professional and private 
life. There is no doubt that Mrs. Bartke has 
had a great impact on so many members of 
our community. 
Our community is immeasurably better for 
all of Mrs. Bartke’s contributions and it is 
therefore fitting and proper that we honor her 
here today as Contra Costa’s 2020 Woman of 
the Year. 
BRIEN WALL 
HON. MICHAEL F. DOYLE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 26, 2021 
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to 
Brien Wall, a constituent, a 25-year Allegheny 
County Democratic Committee member, and a 
lifelong Pittsburgh area resident, who unex-
pectedly passed away on Saturday, March 6, 
2021, in Fort Myers, Florida. 
Born on July 5, 1948, in Pittsburgh, Brien 
was a proud graduate of South Hills Catholic 
High School. He also graduated from Indiana 
University of Pennsylvania (IUP), graduating 
with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Economics 
as part of the class of 1970. A dedicated 
alumni of IUP, he was instrumental in founding 
IUP’s Center for Family Business. Committed 
to the preservation of the family business as 
the basic element of the American free enter-
prise system, his leadership helped shape the 
underlying mission of IUP’s Center for Family 
Business and enhanced its reputation greatly. 
Brien was a veteran of the United States 
Army. He was drafted immediately after col-
lege and was selected to serve as a military 
policeman at the United States Military Acad-
emy at West Point, where he held a top-secret 
clearance. 
A Certified Family Business Specialist at 
Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Com-
pany for 23 years, Mr. Wall dedicated his pro-
fessional career to solving problems for cli-
ents. Recognized nationally for his work, Brien 
was one of only 250 employees throughout 
the country to receive the Family Business 
Specialist designation, and he was one of only 
ten agents named to the Mass Mutual Life In-
surance Company Master’s Club out of 4,000 
agents across the nation. 
Brien was also an active community leader, 
giving back as much as he could. He was a 
founding member of, and served as the fi-
nance 
chairman 
for, 
Allegheny 
Health 
Choices, and he was a member of both the 
Three Rivers Labor Management Committee 
and the Eberly College of Business advisory 
council. He also served on the board of the St. 
Francis Health Foundation, where he was 
awarded the ‘‘Courage to Come Back Award.’’ 
Brien is survived by his loving wife of 44 
years, Patricia Ann; children, Brien, Erin, and 
Sean; grandsons, Brien and Robert; and many 
family members and friends. 
Brien Wall was a good man, whose impact 
was felt throughout our region and by every 
person who was blessed to meet him. On be-
half of the 18th Congressional District, I want 
to celebrate the contributions Brien made 
throughout his life. He will be greatly missed. 
CELEBRATING 
HARVEY 
SOLWAY 
ON THE OCCASION OF HIS 70TH 
BIRTHDAY 
HON. HALEY M. STEVENS 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 26, 2021 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the 70th birthday of Mr. 
Harvey Solway of Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, 
who reached this milestone on March 24th. 
Harvey has spent his long and loving life 
dedicated to his beloved family and countless 
friends. He has maintained a vibrant career as 
the successful Chief Executive Officer of Pet 
Supplies Plus, and now investment enter-
prises. 
Harvey’s family encouraged friends around 
the country to write to him and share a favor-
ite memory, and I would like to include mine 
here for this record. 
It is well known that the first time I met Har-
vey Solway was when I was in high school, 
and I entered his house after school with his 
daughter, Allison, one of my best friends. I 
mistakenly thought he was asking me how my 
day went, when in fact, he was speaking to 
his wife. My precocious seventeen-year-old 
self responded that I was exasperated to find 
out that a government education program for 
young adults had concluded its application pe-
riod, and that I had missed the deadline. 
While Allison regales many with this story 
frequently, what many do not know is that 
Harvey Solway was one of the first people to 
encourage my run for Congress. 
Harvey has lent generous wisdom and 
counsel to many aspiring young professionals. 
He does so without seeking credit or attention, 
but because he likes to contribute to the better 
outcomes of those around him. Today, I am 
pleased to celebrate my friend, Harvey, on his 
birthday. I am glad that he got to spend this 
milestone day with his loving wife, Nancy, by 
his side. Here’s to many more.

Friday, March 26, 2021 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, as a mem-
ber of the House of Representatives, I take 
any example of abuse to our citizens ex-
tremely seriously. It is incumbent on the entire 
United States Congress to do our part to tack-
le this problem. For two decades, Place of 
Hope and its founder and CEO, Charles Bend-
er, have taken the baton and run its share of 
the race. Entering its 20th year, the organiza-
tion continues to do phenomenal work in one 
part of our pursuit of a more perfect union.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E300 
March 26, 2021 
Since its inception, the organization has pro-
vided support to over 17,000 survivors of 
human trafficking, homeless kids, and foster 
children. To this date, a remarkable 320 ‘‘for-
ever families’’ have been created via adoption. 
Place of Hope has also helped to generate 
much-needed awareness for this issue. Over 
40,000 community members have been edu-
cated about human trafficking under Place of 
Hope. 
Over the years, the organization has ex-
panded its outreach and become a more di-
verse enterprise. Beginning in 2008, a need 
for a more robust community foster care pro-
gram was found. As a result, Homes of Hope 
was created to help recruit families in the local 
community to adopt foster children. The Peter 
and Fern Barsanti Family Life Center was 
opened in 2010 as another measure to pro-
vide therapy and other recreational necessities 
to the children within the organization’s super-
vision. 
Organizations like Place of Hope are invalu-
able to making the world a better place for the 
next generation, particularly those that have 
endured unimaginable hardship. Children who 
have been through trafficking, abuse, and ne-
glect have a continuum of support available to 
them through this terrific project that will con-
tinue to do marvelous work for our youth. Des-

versary of Place of Hope is a necessary step

HONORING KARISSA KRUSE AS 
THE 2020 WOMAN OF THE YEAR 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 26, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Karissa Kruse, 
whom I have named the 2020 Woman of the 
Year in Sonoma County, California. Woman of 
the Year recognizes women who have made 
important contributions to California’s 5th Con-
gressional District in Arts and Culture, Profes-
sional Achievement, Entrepreneurship and In-
novation or Community Service. 
Born in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, Ms. 
Kruse grew up surrounded by a loving and 
supportive family. A University of Pennsylvania 
alumna, she graduated with a BS in Econom-
ics and an MBA in Marketing from the pres-
tigious Wharton School of Business. In pursuit 
of a warmer climate, she came to Sonoma 
County shortly after graduating, starting Argot 
Wines and Karma, an angel investment firm. 
Ms. Kruse began her career with the 
Sonoma County Winegrowers in 2012 as the 
Director of Marketing before being named 
President in 2013. The following year, she 
launched an initiative charting a 5-year path to 
100 percent sustainability, an ambitious target 
that reflects both her decisiveness as a leader 
and her passion for our environment and farm-
ing families. By September of 2019, nearly all 
of Sonoma County’s vineyards had been cer-
tified sustainable, making it the most eco-
logically friendly wine region in the world. Ms. 
Kruse continued to build upon the organiza-
tion’s environmental leadership, establishing 
an exclusive partnership with the California 
Land Stewardship Institute to launch a Climate 
Adaptation Certification, the first of its kind for 
agriculture. 
Her tenure as President has also coincided 
with the recent wildfires that have challenged 
the resilience of the wine community. Ms. 
Kruse has been instrumental in guiding our 
agricultural communities through these tumul-
tuous times, re-establishing the Sonoma 
County Grape Growers Foundation in 2016 to 
improve the lives of agricultural workers and 
their families. Over the past two years, the 
Foundation has provided over $1 million for 
wildfire recovery, housing support, and work-
force development. These funds have been 
crucial in supporting the stability of the wine 
industry, which in turn has been a lynchpin in 
rebuilding our communities. Moreover, Ms. 
Kruse is thrilled to have recently married 
Steve Dutton, a 5th generation Sonoma Coun-
ty farmer, on January 1, 2021. She is honored 
to be a member of the Dutton family along 
with Steve and her new stepchildren, Jake 
and Jordan. 
Madam Speaker, Ms. Karissa L. Kruse ex-
emplifies the kind of business leadership that 
fosters vibrant, cohesive, and prosperous 
communities. It is therefore fitting and proper 
that we honor her here today as Sonoma 
County’s 2020 Woman of the Year.

IN HONOR OF THE LIFE OF HAJJI 
FADWAT 
‘‘EM 
CHAWKI’’ 
HAIDOUS-BAZZI 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 26, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Hajji Fadwat ‘‘Em 
Chawki’’ Haidous-Bazzi of Dearborn, Michigan 
who passed away on March 22nd. Her lifetime 
of service to our community is worthy of com-
mendation. 
Hajji was born on March 1, 1938 in Bint 
Jbeil, Lebanon but made her home in Dear-
born, Michigan. In 1957, she married Hajji 
Kassem Bazzi and in the wake of the Leba-
nese Civil War in 1975, they left their home 
country to come to America. Together they 
raised six children. After leaving her home-
land, she worked tirelessly to reunite her chil-
dren and their families in diaspora. 
Known for her tender heart, she dedicated 
herself to charitable giving, volunteering, and 
fundraising for people in need in both Lebanon 
and Michigan, never asking for anything in re-
turn. Generous by nature, she was known to 
shower those she loved in prayer and in song. 
A towering figure among those who knew 
her, Hajji had a commanding presence and an 
enduring love of family. She and her husband 
raised a family of forty-seven strong, who 
adored her infectious spirit and thoughtful 
humor. She is survived by her husband, her 
siblings, including Wayne County Commis-
sioner Al Haidous, her grandchildren, including 
Michigan Solicitor General Fadwa Alawieh 
Hammoud, children in law, and great-grand-
children. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life of Hajji Fadwat ‘‘Em 
Chawki’’ Haidous-Bazzi. She was a loving 
mother and grandmother, and a friend to 
many. A pillar of our community and a con-
stant reminder of the importance of family and 
charity, she will be deeply missed. Our 
thoughts are with Mr. Bazzi and his family at 
this time.

IN RECOGNITION OF VICKY 
BRECHIBIEL 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 26, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to congratulate Vicky Brechbiel 
on receiving the Client Impact Award from the 
Greater Chambersburg Chamber of Com-
merce. 
Vicky is a Certified Nursing Assistant at 
Menno Haven. She has spent 20 years as a 
CNA caring for her patients. She is dedicated 
to her patients and consistently goes above 
and beyond to ensure they receive their favor-
ite foods, wake up at their preferred times, 
and begin their mornings well. The Client Im-
pact Award is awarded to a person that dem-
onstrates extraordinary efforts to positively im-
pact the lives of their patients. Vicky treats 
every patient with love and respect, as well as 
an individualized treatment plan. 
Vicky exhibits true dedication, compassion, 
and professionalism to the residents of Menno 
Haven. On behalf of Pennsylvania’s 13th Dis-
trict, I congratulate Vicky on this achievement 
and thank her for her service to our commu-
nity.

MOURNING THE CONTINUED LOSS 
OF LIFE IN AMERICA TO GUN VI-
OLENCE 
HON. HALEY M. STEVENS 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 26, 2021 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in response to the exceptional number 
of lives that have been stolen from American 
communities just this month to the continued 
scourge of gun violence in this country. 
On March 16th in Georgia, a gunman went 
on a deadly rampage at three spas in the At-
lanta area, murdering eight people. Six of the 
precious lives lost were women of Asian de-
scent: mothers, sisters, and partners. 
On March 20th in Pennsylvania, a gunman 
opened fire at a party in Philadelphia, killing 
one and wounding five others. 
And on March 22nd in Colorado, a gunman 
took ten innocent souls at a grocery store in 
Boulder—one of which was a police officer 
who arrived to help. 
I fear that many have grown numb to the 
news of violence, death, and dreams unreal-
ized in this country, and to those I plead: see 
your neighbor as yourself. Protect your fellow 
Americans. Do not give up on the possibility of 
a future free from pain and fear of preventable 
death. 
On behalf of the victims of gun violence and 
their families, we cannot be deterred in our 
mission to institute basic protections to shield 
the American people from continual loss. I will 
not surrender to hopelessness, and neither 
should my colleagues in this legislative body.

E301 
March 26, 2021 
AMERICANS ARE STUBBORNLY UNMOVED BY 
DEATH 
(By Robin Givhan) 
The scene looked heartbreakingly familiar: 
the rumble of tactical vehicles, the swarm of 
law enforcement officers, the long ribbons of 
yellow police tape and the eyewitness de-
scriptions thick with residual terror. Mon-
day evening’s deadly shooting in Boulder, 
Colo., which resulted in the deaths of 10 peo-
ple, including a police officer, was the second 
mass shooting in a week. 
A dreadful normalcy has returned. Muscle 
memory demands that we lament it—even as 
all evidence suggests that many of us are 
unmoved by death. It doesn’t cause behavior 
to change. It doesn’t shake people from their 
moorings at the center of their own universe. 
Death is not a deterrent. 
In the days after a mass shooting, the na-
tion mourns and those who died are named. 
The hearts of our elected officials have been 
broken so many times that surely they must 
be in shards by now. The flags are lowered to 
half-staff. And the president speaks. Joe 
Biden, a man who is expert at consoling, did 
the best that he could to say something true 
that did not sound like a cliche. 
‘‘I even hate to say it because we’re saying 
it so often: My heart goes out. Our hearts go 
out for the survivors, the—who had to—had 
to flee for their lives and who hid, terrified, 
unsure if they would ever see their families 
again, their friends again,’’ Biden said Tues-
day afternoon from the State Dining Room. 
‘‘The consequences of all this are deeper 
than I suspect we know. By that, I mean the 
mental consequences—a feeling of—anyway, 
it just—we’ve been through too many of 
these.’’ 
The images from these shootings can be 
gut-wrenching. In video and still images, 
people see shellshocked survivors pouring 
out of the school, the night club and, this 
time, the grocery store. There’s blood in 
these images, sometimes even the blurred 
image of one of the deceased. There’s noth-
ing sanitized about them. The shooting may 
happen behind closed doors, but the death is 
in the open. The terror rises off the survivors 
like a stench; the sound of fear reverberates. 
And still the deaths don’t spur action to 
make the guns harder to get, to make the 
guns less efficient. The president, some poli-
ticians and many activists cry out for ‘‘com-
mon sense’’ gun laws to stop the senseless 
death even as it seems that they are pleading 
with a country that’s engaged in a com-
pletely different kind of calculation. 
Increasingly it seems that we simply do 
not care about the other person, that other 
family, someone else’s child. The self is ev-
erything. It’s freedom and liberty, whims 
and desires. Community doesn’t extend be-
yond one’s front door. Everything else is 
someone else’s concern. 
Studies have shown that the human brain 
can lose the capacity to process death, to ab-
sorb the meaning of it, when the numbers of 
the dead begin to reach staggering levels. We 
have been told that the heart can go numb in 
response to such enormity, This is one of the 
explanations for why people have continued 
to engage in risky behavior during the 
coronavirus pandemic even as it has become 
ever clearer how best to protect our fellow 
Americans. The end is on the horizon, and if 
people simply wear a mask, social distance 
and persevere with patience, we might get 
there—not all of us, sadly, but most of us. 
Yet unmasked revelers crowded onto the 
streets of Miami Beach. The very real possi-
bility of death has not been a deterrent. The 
community didn’t matter as these partyers 
and tourists ostensibly shot a different kind 
of deadly slug into the Florida air. 
More than 544,000 deaths in the United 
States due to the coronavirus have not sent 
everyone scurrying to protect their neigh-
bor. To follow common sense recommenda-
tions. To center the community instead of 
the individual. 
If that number is too big for people to 
grapple with, what is the right number? 
What number is small enough that each 
death touches the heart and therefore moti-
vates people to act, to be better? Is it 58—the 
number of people a man killed at a Las 
Vegas country music festival in 2017? Is it 
49—the number killed in a shooting at 
Orlando’s Pulse nightclub in 2016? Or perhaps 
the motivating number is nine, which ac-
counts for those who were fatally shot in 
Charleston during a prayer meeting. Is it 
eight—the number who were killed in Geor-
gia just last week? It surely can’t be one be-
cause there are singular deadly shootings in 
communities all too often and still nothing 
happens. Nothing. 
We have not gone numb to death. To ‘‘go 
numb’’ suggests that once there was feeling, 
once there was sensitivity. When was that? 
Perhaps it was back in 1968 when, after the 
deaths of John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther 
King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy, Congress 
passed gun laws that formed the basis of fed-
eral regulation that has been regularly erod-
ed and only occasionally strengthened. We 
haven’t cared for a long time. Not when the 
dying were schoolchildren, people in the 
midst of prayer or contented folks just living 
quiet lives. 
HARRIS’S SELF-EVIDENT TRUTH 
Crowds gather in the street while a speak-
er blasts music an hour past curfew in Miami 
Beach on Sunday. (Daniel A. Varela/Miami 
Herald/AP) 
Today, some in this country argue against 
gun laws with a ferocity that moves beyond 
a right to hunt rabbits, or defend oneself 
against an assailant or one’s property in the 
face of an intruder. We refuse to relinquish 
the delusion that 21st-century America is a 
frontier town in which gunplay is a form of 
justice. 
Many insist that the very real possibility 
of mass deaths does not outweigh a personal 
inconvenience or the setting aside of a myth. 
Give up large-capacity magazines. Wear a 
mask. These deaths matter. 
We are not numb to death. We stubbornly, 
selfishly dismiss it. We shake it off. But 
there is always an assault that has the ca-
pacity to bring an individual low. Some brac-
ing gut punch that stings and startles. The 
pain might finally register in a way that is 
deep and lasting. And that person begins to 
feel something. But that may require death 
coming directly to their own doorstep, since 
that’s the only one that, for many of us, 
seems to matter. 
Correction: A previous version of this arti-
cle misstated the year of the shooting at a 
Las Vegas country music festival. It was in 
2017, not 2018.

HONORING ELIZABETH ANN 
HOFFMAN 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 26, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Elizabeth Ann 
Hoffman, whom I have named the 2021 
Woman of the Year in Contra Costa County, 
California. Woman of the Year recognizes 
women who have made important contribu-
tions to California’s 5th Congressional District 
in Arts and Culture, Professional Achievement, 
Entrepreneurship and Innovation or Commu-
nity Service. 
A California native born in San Leandro and 
raised in Benicia, Ms. Hoffman attended 
Sonoma State University for her under-
graduate degree and San Jose State Univer-
sity for her graduate education in Social Serv-
ices. A member of Food Bank of Contra Costa 
and the Vallejo Chamber of Commerce, Ms. 
Hoffman has been an active member of our 
community for many years. 
Most notably, Ms. Hoffman serves as the 
Executive Director for Rebuilding Together So-
lano County (RTSC), working diligently to im-
prove the lives of low-income families, vet-
erans, seniors, and disabled members of our 
community. Throughout the years, Ms. Hoff-
man’s contributions to RTSC have resulted in 
the rehabilitation of over 40 low-income homes 
and 52 community centers. She has also im-
pressively amassed over 12,000 volunteers for 
the organization, expanding resources to bet-
ter the lives of those in need. 
Her exceptional commitment to our commu-
nity has not gone unrecognized. Ms. Hoffman 
has received numerous public health service 
awards, including PG&E’s Environmental Re-
mediation Sibley Award and the American Red 
Cross’ Community Service Hero Award. 
Madam Speaker, Ms. Hoffman has proven 
herself to be a true asset to the groups she 
serves. Our community is immeasurably better 
for all of Ms. Hoffman’s contributions and it is 
therefore fitting and proper that we honor her 
here today as Contra Costa County’s 2021 
Woman of the Year.

KENT MCELHATTAN 
HON. MICHAEL F. DOYLE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 26, 2021 
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to 
Kent McElhattan, a constituent who has dedi-
cated his life and career to safety. 
Earlier this month, the National Safety 
Council (NSC) honored Mr. McElhattan with 
the prestigious Flame of Life award at the 
2020NE Virtual Safety Congress and Expo. 
This honor has only been given four times in 
the 107-year history of the National Safety 
Council, as it is reserved for the most out-
standing individuals who have dedicated them-
selves to building safer workplaces and com-
munities. Mr. McElhattan is a long-time partner 
to the National Safety Council. He served on 
the NSC Board of Directors for a decade, in-
cluding a stint as chairman from 2010 until 
2013. 
A founder of the Pittsburgh-based Industrial 
Scientific, Kent worked to build products that 
protect workers from hazardous conditions 
around the world. Industrial Scientific special-
izes in producing Personal Protective Equip-
ment (PPE), some of which has become vital 
to all of us during the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Under his leadership, Industrial Scientific was 
a founding member of the Campbell Institute, 
which is focused on solving global environ-
mental, health, and safety challenges through 
research and innovation. 
Now CEO and co-founder of another Pitts-
burgh-based company, Discovery Robotics,

safety and quality of life through the creation 
of robotic solutions. 
Feeling personally responsible for every 
worker he employed over the course of his ca-
reer, he has made it his top priority to ensure 
that every one of his workers returned home 
safely to their families at the end of each 
workday. He and his family also founded the 
McElhattan Foundation, which is invested in 
the belief that safety advancements can be 
achieved through technology. The McElhattan 
foundation has also partnered with NSC to 
launch the Work to Zero initiative, designed to 
eliminate workplace fatalities through the use 
of technology. 
On behalf of Pennsylvania’s 18th Congres-
sional District, I want to commend Kent and 
thank him for his many years of dedication to 
building a safer community and a safer work-
place for his employees. His actions serve as 
an inspiration and should be admired by us 
all. I am pleased to honor him as a deserving 
recipient of the National Safety Council Flame 
and Life award.

HONORING ELOISE SCOTT 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA

Friday, March 26, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Eloise Scott, 
whom I have named the 2021 Woman of the 
Year in Solano County, California. Woman of 
the Year recognizes women who have made 
important contributions to California’s 5th Con-
gressional District in Arts and Culture, Profes-
sional Achievement, Entrepreneurship and In-
novation or Community Service. 
Born in the Philippines in 1935, Ms. Scott 
immigrated to the United States in 1959, 
where she lived in San Francisco until settling 
in Vallejo in 1976. She graduated from the 
University of San Francisco with a Bachelor of 
Arts Degree in Counseling and Social Work. 
She has utilized her expertise in counseling to 
aid families and respond to numerous commu-
nity tragedies. In 1998, she brought commu-
nity awareness of the shooting of 14-year-old 
Filipino student Regi Infanti, organizing respite 
care and counseling, and has continued to ex-
pand her meaningful work since. 
Ms. Scott has become a notably fierce ad-
vocate for change among the Filipino commu-
nity in Vallejo. Serving as a board member for 
both the Filipino Community of Solano County 
Inc. and Filipino American Social Services, 
Ms. Scott has been instrumental in the 
progress made for the Filipino American com-
munity and positively impacted the lives of 
young women, from substance abuse treat-
ment to pregnancy prevention. She also 
serves as the Chairperson of the Philippine 
Cultural Committee ‘‘PISTA SA NAYON’’ and 
has been the President of Hinunangan Asso-
ciation, Inc., and a member of Solano Coun-
ty’s Democratic Central Committee. 
Driven by her faith, Ms. Scott is also a 
proud member of St. Basil’s Catholic Church 
in Vallejo, where she serves as a Eucharistic 
Minister. She has volunteered her time to 
fundraising for the building maintenance and 
other various activities and programs within 
the church, as well as helping with physical 
education classes for St. Basil’s secondary 
school. 
Our community in Vallejo has been im-
proved from Eloise Scott’s contributions and it 
is therefore fitting and proper that we honor 
her here today as Solano County’s 2021

IN RECOGNITION OF EDWARD 
GAZEL’S 100TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 26, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Edward Gazel of Lincoln 
Park on the occasion of his 100th birthday. 
His contributions to our community and to our 
nation are worthy of commendation. 
Mr. Gazel was born and raised in Detroit, 
Michigan and is a 1939 graduate of Detroit 
Northwestern High School. During the Great 
Depression he earned money working at the 
Detroit Golf Club, caddying for Michigan sports 
legends like Coach Harry Kipke and Detroit 
Tiger Mickey Cochrane. After the attack on 
Pearl Harbor, he volunteered for the Marine 
Corps. 
He was sent to San Diego, California for 
boot camp and was then assigned to a me-
dium tank unit of the Second Tank battalion, 
Second Marine Division. The stories of his 
service are numerous and detailed and cannot 
only be shared in one short speech. His unit 
saw action at Tarawa, Saipan, Tinian, and 
Okinawa. After the Japanese surrendered, his 
unit was assigned to maintain order at the 
scene of the second atomic bombing in Naga-
saki. He often remembers his fellow Marines 
who lost their lives in combat and is the last 
surviving member of his unit. Mr. Gazel was 
awarded the Bronze Star for his gallantry at 
Tinian. 
After his return to the United States in De-
cember 1945 and his discharge from the 
armed forces in January 1946 he returned to 
civilian life, marrying Esther the same year. 
Together they had three girls and Mr. Gazel 
found 
his 
success 
in 
selling 
wholesale 
produce in Detroit. A true patriot and a deco-
rated Marine, he is known to insist that ‘‘the 
real heroes are those who fell in combat and 
rest under those markers on far away and 
sometimes forgotten battlefields.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Edward Gazel on his 100th

Hawaiians in key parts of VAWA. 
My amendment requires key data for full im-
plementation of VAWA about our nation’s in-
digenous peoples that has previously been un-
available, especially relating to Native Hawai-
ians. To develop this data, the federal govern-
ment will conduct a review of law enforcement 
and other crime prevention programs dealing 
with child sexual exploitation, child abuse, inti-
mate partner violence, human trafficking, miss-
ing or murdered individuals and substance 
abuse. The review will result in recommenda-
tions directly affecting the social, educational, 
economic and other factors contributing to Na-
tive Hawaiians becoming missing or murdered. 
My amendment also calls for two additional 
reviews. The first one will examine programs 
that affect Native Hawaiians who are victims 
of criminal offenses. The second report will ex-
amine Native Hawaiians in the criminal justice 
system. This second report will also produce 
recommendations related to the social, edu-
cational, economic and other factors contrib-
uting to Native Hawaiians becoming involved 
in the criminal justice system. 
The need for these reports and data is crit-
ical. While data is available for individuals of 
Native American and Alaska Native descent, it 
does not exist for Native Hawaiians who suffer 
from high incidences of violence. This new 
data will guide future legislation and identify 
key areas in which additional assistance and 
resources are needed. Organizations that are 
centered around helping the Native Hawaiian 
community will benefit as well through avail-
ability of accurate data to direct their re-
sources better. 
Mahalo nui loa (thank you very much) for 
your support for my amendment and for the 
inclusion of American Indian, Alaska Native 
and Native Hawaiian groups within VAWA.

CELEBRATING 
THE 
96TH 
BIRTH-
DAY OF WWII VETERAN AND EL 
DORADO NATIVE, NOEL KENNY, 
CALAWAY, JR. 
HON. BRUCE WESTERMAN 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 26, 2021 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the 96th birthday of Fourth 
District resident and World War II veteran, Mr. 
Noel Kenny Calaway, Jr. A longtime El Do-
rado resident, Mr. Calaway served as a Navy 
radioman on a patrol yacht in the Hawaiian Is-
lands. 
Born in El Dorado on April 19, 1925, Mr. 
Calaway graduated from high school in May 
1943. He immediately went to work as an oil 
rig builder, but he received his draft notice on 
October 16, 1943, and reported for basic train-
ing at San Diego, California, and then a 20- 
week radio school in Boulder, Colorado. After 
arriving at Pearl Harbor in 1944, Calaway 
spent more than a year patrolling the Hawai-
ian Islands aboard an armed patrol vessel 
tasked with monitoring the area for sub-
marines following the Japanese attack on 
Pearl Harbor. While the patrol yacht was 
armed with various anti-aircraft guns, he also 
radioed signals to U.S. warplanes, assisting 
American pilots with navigation in the region. 
Following his discharge from the Navy in 
1946, he made him home and raised his fam-
ily in El Dorado, Arkansas, where he remains 
one of the best examples of our nation’s 
greatest generation. I take this time today to 
honor the life of service exemplified by Mr. 
Calaway, and I ask that our nation join me in 
wishing him a happy 96th birthday. I thank him 
and his family for their dedication to our fellow 
citizens and the cause of liberty.

HONORING THE LIFE OF PASTOR 
ROBERT ‘‘BOB’’ REEVE 
HON. YOUNG KIM 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 26, 2021 
Mrs. KIM of California. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the life of Pastor Bob 
Reeve. Robert ‘‘Bob’’ Reeve was born June 2, 
1955 as the second of three boys to Charles 
Blair Reeve and Patricia Ann Reeve. Bob 
graduated from West Covina High School in 
1973, where he was the starting varsity catch-
er for the baseball team and the starting var-
sity quarterback for the football team. He grad-
uated from Azusa Pacific University with a 
Bachelor of Arts in 1977, and later a Master 
of Arts in Religion in 1982. He married the 
love of his life, Sherry Jo Smart on June 24, 
1977. He was a proud father of three children, 
John, Joshua, and Shannon and an even 
prouder grandfather to eight grandchildren: 
Nevaeh, 
Asher, 
Cohen, 
Arabella, 
Amos, 
Dracien, A’aliyah, and A’aniyah. 
Pastor Reeve devoted his life to service. He 
served as Youth Pastor at Bethel Dutch Re-
formed Church from 1977 to 1979. He served 
full time in Campus Life ministry with high 
schoolers in the San Fernando Valley from 
1979 to 1981. From 1980 to 2004, he served 
under his brother Jim at Faith Community 
Church in West Covina, California, helping the 
church grow to over 12,000 in weekly attend-
ance. In 2005, he started the Cause Commu-
nity Church and was the Founding and Lead 
Pastor along with Sherry. 
Pastor Reeve was an accomplished leader 
during his time at Cause Community Church. 
In 2006, he started Kidz on the Block Party, 
one of many significant Brea Community 
Events. From 2007 to 2009, he led the church 
through ‘‘The Beacon Project,’’ a $1.3 million 
capital campaign, where the church purchased 
and renovated its current home on Beacon 
Street. In 2009, he created the DNA Journal, 
encouraging people to read their Bible daily 
and journal reflectively. In addition to many 
other accomplishments, he was an active 
member of the Brea Ministerial Association for 
16 years, led hundreds of people to the Holy 
Land in Israel, and started a Pastoral 
Practicum in 2020. 
Bob also had a passion for coaching that 
began when he coached his brother John’s 
5th grade flag football team in 1967, as a 12- 
year-old. From 1987 to 1993 he was a base-
ball coach in the South Hills Little League for 
his sons, John and Joshua, and nephew Jeff. 
From 2003 to 2004, he was the Southlands 
High School Girls Softball Coach, coaching his 
daughter Shannon. 
During his lifetime, Bob was a pastor and 
shepherd, spiritual leader and coach, marriage 
and family counselor, and preacher and teach-
er of God’s Word to thousands who poured 
his heart and soul into his family. His honest, 
yet humorous approach to teaching will make 
you laugh and learn about yourself. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me today in recognizing the life of Pastor Bob 
Reeve, he will be greatly missed.

HONORING CAROL HUCHINGSON 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 26, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Carol J. 
Huchingson, whom I have named the 2021 
Woman of the Year in Lake County, California. 
Woman of the Year recognizes women who 
have made important contributions to Califor-
nia’s 5th Congressional District in Arts and 
Culture, Professional Achievement, Entrepre-
neurship and Innovation or Community Serv-
ice. 
A 
Northern 
California 
native, 
Ms. 
Huchingson earned her Bachelor and Master 
of Arts degrees in Social Welfare and Edu-
cation, with special studies in Human Services 
Administration, from Humboldt State University 
in 1990. She worked for the County of Lake 
Department of Social Services as Director 
from 1994–2016 and currently works as Coun-
ty Administrative Officer. 
Ms. Huchingson worked to revamp Lake 
County’s Department of Social Services into 
an organization that effectively responds to the 
needs of our community members and effi-
ciently reacts in times of disaster. Similarly, 
during her time as County Administrative offi-
cer, she advocated to strengthen our county’s 
government workforce by increasing training 
and developing better relationships with labor 
organizations. 
Ms. Huchingson was also an active leader 
during the 2015 Valley Fire, the 2016 Clayton 
Fire, the 2017 Wine Country Fire, the 2018 
Mendocino Fire, and the 2020 August Com-
plex Fire. Her leadership helped our commu-
nity through difficult times. Due to Ms. 
Huchingson’s initiative and commitment, Lake 
County is making its way to economic viability 
and recovery after these horrific disasters. 
As COVID–19 has recently hindered local 
involvement in government, Ms. Huchingson 
led a team that developed a new, award-win-
ning hybrid approach to public meetings. In 
August of 2020, six Board of Supervisors and

sylvania. 
Ms. Huchingson has made a great impact 
on our community by serving in our govern-
ment and has devoted countless hours during 
her 21-year career. Our community is better 
for all of Ms. Huchingson’s contributions and it 
is therefore fitting and proper that we honor 
her today as Lake County’s 2021 Woman of 
the Year.

IN RECOGNITION OF ARTHUR 
RUSSELL’S 100TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 26, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Arthur Russell of Dearborn 
on the occasion of his 100th birthday. His con-
tributions to our community and to our nation 
are worthy of commendation. 
Mr. Russell was born in Texas but grew up 
in Plymouth, Michigan. During the Great De-
pression he became an avid small game hun-
ter to help put food on his family’s table. Dur-
ing prohibition, he helped his mother at her 
blind pig. He ended up leaving school after 
11th grade and went to work on a milk truck 
and as a plumber’s assistant. Seeing war on 
the horizon, he volunteered for the United 
States Marine Corps at age 20 in 1941. 
He went to boot camp in San Diego, Cali-
fornia and was first assigned to the armory 
there. He was then transferred to Jaques 
Farm and was assigned to train with the ‘‘D’’ 
Company of the Second Tank Battalion. He 
was integrated into the ‘‘B’’ Company and was 
deployed to New Zealand in the spring of 
1943. After a few brief stops throughout the 
Pacific, the Second Marine Division assaulted 
Tarawa. This resulted in a 76-hour battle with 
the Japanese troops. His tank did not fare well 
on the atoll and was disabled by enemy fire. 
During combat, he was hit by sniper fire but 
was only nicked. Today, he proudly owns the 
rifle that the Japanese snipers used against 
him. He also participated in combat in the as-
saults on Saipan and Tinian. After being re-
lived of combat duty he was assigned to guard 
duty in Washington, D,C. where he was a 
guard for the Main Navy Building. He was 
then transferred to Camp Lejeune in North 
Carolina where he was discharged from in 
1946. 
In 1948 Mr. Russell married Patricia and to-
gether they had six children. He began work-
ing in the Forestry Division of the Wayne 
County Roads Commission, where he rose to 
be Head of the Forestry Division. A true pa-
triot, when the Korean War broke out, he 
joined the Navy where he was sent to serve 
in Guam and was promoted the rank of Petty 
Officer First Class. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Arthur Russell on his 100th 
Birthday. He has honorably served this coun-
try through his exemplary military service. I 
join with Mr. Russell’s family and friends in ex-
tending my best wishes to him on his birthday.

HONORING LYDIA MONDAVI 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 26, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Lydia Mondavi, 
whom I have named the 2021 Woman of the 
Year in Napa County, California. Woman of 
the Year recognizes women who have made 
important contributions to California’s 5th Con-
gressional District in Arts and Culture, Profes-
sional Achievement, Entrepreneurship and In-
novation or Community Service. 
The seeds that bloomed into Ms. Mondavi’s 
community service lay nearly 240 years in the 
past. A member of the historic Rutledge fam-
ily, who count among their members signers 
of the Declaration of Independence and Con-
stitution, she has always embodied her ances-
tors’ spirit of civic dedication. As a business-
woman and as a philanthropist, she has made 
her family and our district proud through her 
selfless action on behalf of others. 
In the early days of the corona virus pan-
demic, Ms. Mondavi employed this spark to 
ensure that all members of our community 
would have equitable access to COVID–19 
testing services. Leveraging her healthcare 
and logistics experience as Chair of the 
Queen of the Valley Foundation Board of 
Trustees and owner of The Abernathy Group, 
Rutledge & Vine, and 29 Cosmetics, she 
united local and state governments, busi-
nesses, and non-profits to establish testing 
sites and deploy mobile testing teams. These 
sites have performed over 200,000 tests to 
date, including many for agricultural workers 
and other vulnerable populations. Now as 
doses of the vaccine become more available, 
she is again working with Core Response, 
Napa Valley Vintners and the Queen of the 
Valley 
Community 
Outreach 
program 
to 
launch an immunization clinic that will be on-
line by the end of March. 
Aside from her efforts during the recent pan-
demic, Ms. Mondavi has served our Napa 
community through her role as an Advisory 
Board Member of The What. Sharing her ex-
periences as an accomplished business-
woman and owner of three companies, she 
works with the organization to foster an open 
forum for women to learn, network, and grow. 
Her dedicated service to this mission has no 
doubt helped many women become industry 
leaders in the Napa Valley. 
Our community is immeasurably better for 
all of Lydia Mondavi’s contributions and it is 
therefore fitting and proper that we honor her 
here today as Napa County’s 2021 Woman of 
the Year.

her time, talents and energy to the Sixth Con-
gressional District and the rest of the Hoosier 
state. I am grateful for her service. 
A dedicated public servant, Ginger currently 
serves Ripley County as county clerk. She is 
also a fervent leader and volunteer in her 
community, often the first to volunteer her time 
and always willing to help at a moment’s no-
tice. 
Finally, I have gotten to know Ginger over 
the last four years, and I am grateful for her 
friendship. 
I thank Ginger Bradford.

NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION 
FOR THE FUTURE ACT 
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 26, 2021 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
today I am pleased to be joined by my col-
leagues on the Committee on Science, Space, 
and Technology, Ranking Member FRANK 
LUCAS, and the Research and Technology 
Subcommittee 
Chairwoman 
and 
Ranking 
Member, HALEY STEVENS and MICHAEL WALTZ, 
in introducing the National Science Foundation 
for the Future Act. 
Established in 1950, the National Science 
Foundation (NSF) was born out of hard- 
earned lessons about the powerful role of 
science in securing an allied victory in World 
War II. Propelled by his wartime experience 
leading the Office of Scientific Research and 
Development, Vannevar Bush championed the 
creation of NSF and postwar federal support 
for science, making the argument that ‘‘ad-
vances in science when put to practical use 
mean more jobs, higher wages, shorter hours, 
more abundant crops, more leisure for recre-
ation, for study, for learning how to live without 
the deadening drudgery which has been the 
burden of the common man for ages past. Ad-
vances in science will also bring higher stand-
ards of living, will lead to the prevention or 
cure of diseases, will promote conservation of 
our limited national resources, and will assure 
means of defense against aggression.’’ 
That was a lofty vision. One, I am proud to 
say, the Foundation has largely lived up to 
throughout its existence. Over the past 70 
years, NSF has played a critical role in sup-
porting fundamental research, education, and 
infrastructure at colleges, universities, and 
other institutions throughout the country. NSF 
funding has enabled numerous breakthrough 
discoveries that have transformed the daily 
lives of the American people—from the inter-
net, lithium batteries, and GPS to weather 
radar, MRI technology, and DNA analysis— 
just to name a few. 
One of the aims of this bill is to empower 
the agency to do more of what it does best. 
Years of modest budget growth have resulted 
in low proposal success rates and stagnant 
grant sizes. Researchers and peer-reviewers 
alike are more conservative in this funding en-
vironment, feeling pressure to deliver results 
rather than take big risks. Researchers are 
also struggling to support graduate students 
and postdocs and are bogged down preparing 
multiple grant proposals to increase their 
chances of being funded. This is no way for 
the world’s leading scientific enterprise to 
function. And if we continue on this path, we 
will cede our scientific leadership, and with it 
the advantages of developing new industries 
and setting the global norms for emerging 
technologies. This bill authorizes a significant 
increase in the agency’s budget. Funding for 
the current portfolio of activities is increased 
by nearly $2 billion in year one and grows at 
an average annual rate of 6 percent, setting 
the agency on a path to double its budget in 
9 years. 
This bill also pushes the Foundation to con-
tinue to evolve. While it is undeniable that the 
Foundation has a legacy of scientific achieve-
ments that have delivered enormous benefits 
to society, it is important to acknowledge that 
those benefits have not always been widely 
shared. Some segments of the public have 
been left behind by the traditional approach to 
science and innovation. This bill promotes in-
creased accountability to the public through 
improvements to the implementation of the 
Broader Impacts review criterion and a new 
requirement for researchers to describe the 
ethical and societal implications of their work. 
The bill also expands public access to data re-
sulting from NSF-funded research and pro-
motes increased vigilance against threats to 
research security and integrity. 
The bill funds centers that will connect NSF 
STEM education innovations to school districts 
and teachers, so more students can benefit. It 
encourages universities to collaborate with the 
private sector to better align undergraduate 
STEM education with workforce needs. It 
raises the bar for mentoring and training of 
graduate students and postdocs and estab-
lishes a pilot program to strengthen the re-
search capacity of emerging research institu-
tions, including minority serving institutions. 
Finally, this bill establishes a new direc-
torate to promote a solutions-driven approach 
to research. A central goal of the Directorate 
for Science and Engineering Solutions (SES) 
is to be more strategic and inclusive in the na-
ture of research collaborations, including by 
connecting researchers with potential users or 
beneficiaries of their research from the priority- 
setting stage through the translation of an in-
novation into practice. While industry has an 
important seat at this table, so do local gov-
ernments and communities that might be af-
fected by the research. The SES Directorate 
will enable the Foundation to take big risks 
and experiment with new approaches to accel-
erate use-inspired and translational research 
to address society’s major challenges, includ-
ing climate change and environmental sustain-
ability, global competitiveness in critical tech-
nologies, 
cybersecurity, 
national 
security, 
STEM education and workforce, and social 
and economic inequality. 
To fully realize the potential of science to 
benefit society, we must fund more research 
on the questions that matter to the American 
people. We also must ensure this research is, 
in the words of Vannevar Bush, ‘‘put to prac-
tical use.’’ Our competitiveness with China and 
other nations drives much of the national dis-
course around innovation because our eco-
nomic and national security depend on our 
leadership in science and technology. How-
ever, competitiveness with China will not be 
possible if we do not unleash our nation’s 
STEM talent on the full range challenges we 
face. Surely the COVID–19 pandemic has laid 
that bare for all of us. And the fact is, re-
searchers and students are inspired by finding 
solutions, whether they be scientific or societal 
challenges. In this bill, we seek to inspire. 
Over a year of bipartisan collaboration and 
numerous conversations with a wide range of 
stakeholders, thought leaders, and policy ex-
perts has resulted in the bill we are intro-
ducing today. I want to thank the many individ-
uals who took the time to engage with Com-
mittee staff and share their perspectives. Their 
efforts have improved the bill immeasurably. 
This is a well-vetted bill, but it is by no means 
the final product. I am committed to a trans-
parent and deliberative process for moving 
this bill forward. I look forward to continuing to 
engage with the stakeholder community and 
with my Committee colleagues through hear-
ings and a markup. 
Finally, I want to thank Majority Leader 
SCHUMER for his leadership in championing an 
infusion of funding and a bold new vision for 
the future of NSF. While our approaches to 
establishing a new directorate differ, we share 
the same goal. We must dramatically accel-
erate progress in research and development in 
this country. I look forward to partnering with 
Senator SCHUMER and my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle in this effort.

HONORING WALLACE YAU KEE 
CHANG 
HON. DAN BISHOP 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 26, 2021 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, today I rise to honor Corporal Wal-
lace Yau Kee Chang, one of the very few re-
maining Chinese-American veterans of World 
War II. In recognition of their service, these 
veterans were collectively awarded the Con-
gressional Gold Medal in 2018—this body’s 
highest honor. For his actions in Europe, Cor-
poral Chang was also awarded the Bronze 
Star. 
Just four days after Pearl Harbor, Corporal 
Chang started his military career as a Hawaii 
Territory Guard. In March 1945, he joined 
Army Company C in the 39th Regiment. While 
stationed in France and Germany, he took 
part in the central German campaign which 
led to the downfall of Hitler and the Nazi re-
gime. After the war, he was appointed leader 
of the 39th Regimental band stationed in 
Rosenheim, Germany. 
Corporal Chang is 98 years old and is a 
resident of Lumberton, North Carolina. I am 
very pleased to honor this great patriot and 
hope to call him a constituent for many more 
years to come. I thank Corporal Chang for his 
service to our country and to our community.

camp in San Diego, California, he was as-
signed to the ‘‘I’’ Company, Third Battalion, 
First Marine Regiment. His unit fought in two 
of the bloodiest battles of the war, Peleliu and 
Okinawa, where many of his fellow soldiers 
lost their lives. He was wounded in battle in 
mid-June 1945 and after recovering, he toured 
with the First Marine Division that was tasked

INTRODUCTION OF THE OUR 
HOMES OUR VOTES ACT 
HON. JESU´S G. ‘‘CHUY’’ GARCI´A 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 26, 2021 
Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to introduce the Our Homes Our 
Votes Act along with my colleague from Penn-
sylvania, MARY GAY SCANLON and my col-
league from Georgia, NIKEMA WILLIAMS. This 
bill will help close the voter turnout gap be-
tween rich and poor by making it easier for eli-
gible tenants in federally subsidized housing to 
register to vote. 
People have fought and died for the right to 
vote in this country, but many still face barriers 
to voting. Tenants in federally subsidized 
housing already have their residence and 
identity verified by public agencies, and this 
bill will allow them to register to vote as they 
sign their lease and verify their income without 
duplicating information or finding additional pa-
perwork to fill out. 
The best way to confront this country’s his-
tory of voter suppression is to remove barriers 
to voting that exist today. Eligible voters in 
working class districts like mine vote at lower 
rates than wealthier voters, and that discrep-
ancy undermines our democracy. This bill is a 
step toward fixing that, and I urge this body to 
advance it. 
HONORING LETITIA HANKE 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 26, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Letitia Hanke, 
whom I have named the 2021 Woman of the 
Year in Sonoma County, California. Woman of 
the Year recognizes women who have made 
important contributions to California’s 5th Con-
gressional District in Arts and Culture, Profes-
sional Achievement, Entrepreneurship and In-
novation or Community Service. 
Ms. Hanke was born in San Pablo and 
moved to Lake County at the age of five. As 
a new student entering a homogeneous com-
munity, she was often bullied. Though these 
experiences hurt her, she learned to channel 
her emotions into creative pursuits. At the urg-
ing of her elementary school music teacher, 
she picked up the trumpet. By the age of nine, 
she was playing with the high school band, 
and more important had found a community of 
friends who stuck up for her. Carrying this 
passion through her middle and high school 
education, she decided to attend Sonoma 
State University in 1993 to pursue a degree in 
Music Performing and Recording Arts. 
Working full-time at a roofing company to 
pay for school, she quickly rose through the 
ranks. Despite having no background in the 
construction industry, the owner of the busi-
ness offered his mentorship and the chance to 
purchase the business from him. Stepping 
away from her final year of school, she pulled 
the cash together and became CEO of ARS 
Roofing, Gutters, and Solar. 
As one of the few women, and even fewer 
Black women working in the roofing industry, 
she found herself once again subject to adver-
sity as a newcomer. Reminded of the power of 
the community that advocated on her behalf, 
she founded the LIME Foundation to help 
underrepresented 
youth 
accomplish 
their 
dreams. Made up of the Nextgen Trades 
Academy, the Senior Activities Program, and 
the Turner Arts Initiative, LIME has trained 
and placed over 100 youth in construction 
trades, increased quality of life for seniors 
through nutrition and exercise classes, and 
provided youth the opportunity to pursue their 
creative passions through summer camps and 
after school arts programs. 
Our community is immeasurably better for 
all of Ms. Hanke’s contributions and it is there-
fore fitting and proper that we honor her here 
today as Sonoma County’s 2021 Woman of 
the Year.

Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to congratulate Stephanie 
Strickler on receiving the Health Care Heroes 
Leadership Award from the Greater Cham-
bersburg Chamber of Commerce. 
Stephanie is the Director of Purchasing at 
Keystone Health and is responsible for over-

cines for Keystone Health providers and pa-
tients. 
In addition to working long hours at the hos-
pital, Stephanie is active in the community and 
often serves with Leadership Franklin. 
Stephanie exhibits true dedication, compas-
sion, and professionalism to the team at Key-
stone Health. On behalf of Pennsylvania’s 
13th District, I congratulate Stephanie on this

munity.

Friday, March 26, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Jamie Garcia 
for receiving the Arvada Wheat Ridge Service 
Ambassadors for Youth award. 
Jamie Garcia is a student at Jefferson Jr./ 
Sr. H.S. and received this award because her 
determination and hard work have allowed her 
to overcome adversities. 
The dedication demonstrated by Jamie Gar-
cia is exemplary of the type of achievement 
that can be attained with hard work and perse-
verance. It is essential students at all levels 
strive to make the most of their education and 
develop a work ethic which will guide them for 
the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to 
Jamie Garcia for winning the Arvada Wheat 
Ridge Service Ambassador for Youth award. I 
have no doubt she will exhibit the same dedi-
cation and character in all of her future ac-
complishments.

HONORING CHARLES WAGGONER 
HON. GREG PENCE 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 26, 2021 
Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Charles Waggoner of Jennings County, 
Indiana. Charles served as the Republican 
County Vice Chairman of Jennings County. He 
committed his time, talents and energy to the 
Sixth Congressional District and the rest of the 
Hoosier state. I am grateful for his service. 
Not only is Charles a successful business-
man, he is also a fervent leader and volunteer 
in his community. Charles is actively engaged 
in civic and community endeavors, often the 
first to volunteer his time and always willing to 
help at a moment’s notice. 
Finally, I have gotten to know Charles over 
the last four years, and I am grateful for his 
friendship. I thank Charles Waggoner.

HON. JESU´S G. ‘‘CHUY’’ GARCI´A 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 26, 2021 
Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to introduce this joint resolution to 
repeal the OCC’s so-called ‘‘True Lender 
Rule.’’ 
Predatory loans trap working families into 
cycles of debt they can’t pay off, and the 
Trump Administration’s True Lender Rule 
helps lenders get around state laws that pro-
tect consumers. Just this week my state of Illi-
nois enacted a law that caps interest rates on 
consumer loans at 36%, but my constituents 
won’t be fully protected until the True Lender 
Rule is repealed. 
People are more vulnerable than ever to 
predatory loans as they struggle to make ends 
meet due to the economic crisis caused by the 
COVID pandemic. Congress should act quick-
ly to repeal this flawed rule that undermines 
important safeguards set by state govern-
ments like mine.

HONORING CRYSTAL MARTIN AS 
THE 2020 WOMAN OF THE YEAR 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 26, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Crystal Martin, 
whom I have named the 2020 Woman of the 
Year in Lake County, California. Woman of the 
Year recognizes women who have made im-
portant contributions to California’s 5th Con-
gressional District in Arts and Culture, Profes-
sional Achievement, Entrepreneurship and In-
novation or Community Service. 
Born in Fayetteville, North Carolina, Ms. 
Martin is well known across our district for her 
interest and engagement in several fund-
raising events in Lake County, as well as her 
exceptional work in the Lake County District 
Attorney’s Office. She is also a devoted wife 
and mother and she takes great pride in her 
family. 
In 2016, inspired by the generosity of 
women in her community, Ms. Martin co- 
founded the ‘‘100+ Women Who Care’’ in 
Lake County. Currently, the organization con-
sists of approximately 150 women and has 
raised more than $200,000 for non-profit 
groups, 100 percent of which goes directly to 
the chosen non-profits in the Lake County 
area. 
Crystal works as the Lake County District 
Attorney’s Victim-Witness Program Adminis-
trator as an advocate for victims. Her skills 
have allowed many victims of violence to con-
tinue their journeys to healing and reconcili-
ation by ensuring that their offenders have 
been brought to justice. Ms. Martin has also 
helped many victims of violence navigate the 
sometimes-overwhelming criminal justice sys-
tem. Always committed to protecting and sup-
porting the interests of those for whom she 
advocates; Ms. Martin has helped victims 
navigate their difficult experiences. 
Madam speaker, Ms. Crystal Martin is a 
dedicated advocate who has devoted her life 
to helping members of our community. It is 
therefore fitting and proper that we honor her 
here today as Lake County’s 2020 Woman of 
the Year.

INTRODUCTION OF THE FAIR PAY 
ACT OF 2021 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 26, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, March 24th 
was Equal Pay Day, which marked the num-
ber of additional days a woman must work to 
earn what a man earned the prior year. The 
1963 Equal Pay Act (EPA), the first of the 
great civil rights statutes of the 1960s, has 
grown creaky with age and needs updating to 
reflect the new workforce, in which women 
work almost as much as men. 
What maybe the best case for a stronger 
and updated EPA occurred in the Congress in 
2003, when female custodians in the House 
and Senate won an EPA case after showing 
that female workers were paid a dollar less 
per hour for doing the same or similar work as 
males. Had those women not been rep-
resented by their union, they would have had 
an almost impossible task in using the rules 
for bringing and sustaining an EPA class ac-
tion lawsuit. 
My own experience as the first woman to 
chair the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission afforded me the opportunity to 
enforce the EPA. However, if women are to 
get equal pay, they need the Fair Pay Act 
(FPA). I again introduce this bill on behalf of 
the average female worker, who is often first 
steered to, and then locked into, jobs with 
wages that are deeply influenced by the gen-
der of individuals who have traditionally held 
such jobs. Much of the wage inequality 
women experience today is because of em-
ployer-steering 
and 
deeply 
rooted 
wage 
stereotypes, which result in wages paid ac-
cording to gender and not according to the 
skill necessary to do the job. I introduce the 
FPA because the pay disparity most women 
face today stems mainly from the segregation 
of women and men in different jobs and pay-
ing women in female-dominated jobs system-
atically less. Two-thirds of white women and 
three quarters of African-American women 
work in just three areas: sales/clerical, service 
and factories. We need more aggressive strat-
egies to break through the societal barriers 
present throughout history the world over, as 
well as employer-steering based on gender, 
which is as old as paid employment itself. 
The FPA would require that if men and 
women are doing comparable work, they must 
be paid comparable wages. If a woman, for 
example, is an emergency services operator, 
a female-dominated profession, she should 
not be paid less than a fire dispatcher, a male- 
dominated profession, simply because each of 
these jobs has been dominated by one gen-
der. If a woman is a social worker, a tradition-
ally female occupation, she should not earn 
less than a probation officer, a traditionally 
male job, simply because of the gender asso-
ciated with each of these jobs. 
The FPA would not tamper with the legal 
burden. Under the FPA, as under the EPA, 
the burden would be on the plaintiff to prove 
discrimination. The plaintiff must show that the 
reason for the disparate treatment is gender 
discrimination, not legitimate market factors. 
Remedies to achieve comparable pay for 
men and women are not radical or unprece-
dented. State governments, in red and blue 
states alike, have shown that it is possible to 
eliminate the part of the pay gap that is due 
to discrimination. Twenty state governments 
have adjusted wages for female-dominated 
professions, raising pay for teachers, nurses, 
clerical workers, librarians, and other female- 
dominated jobs that paid less than comparable 
male-dominated jobs. Minnesota, for example, 
implemented a pay equity plan when it found 
that traditionally female jobs paid 20 percent 
less than comparable traditionally male jobs. 
There may well be some portion of the gender 
wage gap that is traceable to market factors, 
but 20 states have shown that you can tackle 
the gender discrimination-based wage gap 
without interfering in the market system. 
States generally have closed the wage gap 
over a period of four to five years at a one- 
time cost of no more than three to four per-
cent of payroll. 
In addition, many female workers routinely 
achieve pay equity through collective bar-
gaining, and countless employers provide it on 
their own as they see women shifting out of 
vital female-dominated occupations as a result 
of the shortage of skilled workers, as well as 
because of the unfairness to women. Unequal 
pay has been built into the way women have 
been treated since Adam and Eve. To dis-
lodge such deep-seated and pervasive treat-
ment, we must go to the source, the tradition-
ally female occupations, where pay is linked 
with gender and always has been. 
I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

50TH ANNIVERSARY OF 
BANGLADESH’S INDEPENDENCE 
HON. ANDY LEVIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 26, 2021 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the 50th anniversary of 
Bangladesh’s independence, which is being 
celebrated on March 26, 2021. 
On March 7, 1971, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, 
who is called ‘‘Mujib’’ and is also known as the 
‘‘Father of the Nation,’’ delivered a speech 
calling for what was then known as East Paki-
stan to become an independent state. Ban-
gladesh became independent from Pakistan 
on March 26, 1971, and since then, March 
26th has been observed as a national holiday 
in Bangladesh. It is a day when people in 
Bangladesh as well as people around the 
world of Bangladeshi descent remember those 
who lost their lives in the brutal 1971 war for 
independence and celebrate Bangladesh’s vic-
tory as a new independent nation. 
The 
people 
of 
Bangladesh 
and 
the 
Bangladeshi diaspora, including Bangladeshi 
Americans in Michigan’s 9th District, are ob-
serving the golden jubilee of the Independ-
ence Day and celebrating throughout the 
month of March. The 50th anniversary of Ban-
gladesh’s independence is deeply meaningful 
to those with connections to Bangladesh, 
there and abroad. I encourage my colleagues 
to join me in recognizing those working to 
honor Bangladesh’s history by holding special 
events around the world, and in congratulating 
the people of Bangladesh and all Bangladeshi 
Americans on this historic day.

INTRODUCTION 
OF 
RESOLUTION 
RECOGNIZING 
THE 
HERITAGE, 
CULTURE, AND CONTRIBUTIONS 
OF 
LATINAS 
IN 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES 
HON. J. LUIS CORREA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 26, 2021 
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, one in six 
women in the United States is a Latina. There 
are currently nearly twenty-nine million His-
panic women living in the United States. 
Latinas have been part of our nation’s fabric 
from the start. They contribute to our nation 
through their work in business, education, 
science and technology, medicine, engineer-
ing, mathematics, literature and the arts, the 
military, agriculture, hospitality, and public 
service at every level of the government. 
Latinas have served as essential workers 
throughout the COVID–19 pandemic and have 
kept the economy going and the people of the 
United States safe. Many have overcome a 
unique set of challenges and have paved their 
own paths to success. During National Wom-
en’s History Month, I want to honor the mil-
lions of Latinas who have contributed to our 
nation. 
Therefore, I am reintroducing a resolution 
recognizing the heritage, culture, and contribu-
tions of Latinas in the United States. This res-
olution will recognize their contributions to 
American society and further celebrates those 
who have inspired the next generation.

Friday, March 26, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Annette Taylor,

the Year recognizes women who have made 
important contributions to California’s 5th Con-
gressional District in Arts and Culture, Profes-
sional Achievement, Entrepreneurship and In-
novation or Community Service. 
Born in Savannah, Georgia, Ms. Taylor’s 
family moved to Vallejo in 1958. She attended 
the University of San Francisco and graduated 
in 1987 with a Bachelor of Science in Organi-
zational Behavior. A member of the Vallejo 
Chamber of Commerce and the Solano Coun-
ty Black Chamber of Commerce, Ms. Taylor 
has prioritized nurturing local small businesses 
toward success and advocating for equity and 
equality for all. These efforts have not gone 
unnoticed, earning her dozens of accolades. 
Most notably, she was the recipient the 
Assemblywoman Pat Wiggins Woman of 
Achievement Award, not once but twice, in 
2000 and 2002 and the Athena Award in 2004 
from the Vallejo Chamber of Commerce. 
Over the course of her life as a community 
leader, Ms. Taylor has had an immense im-
pact on the people of Vallejo. A lifetime mem-
ber and former president of the Vallejo Section 
of the National Council of Negro Women, Ms. 
Taylor has proven herself a leader amongst 
others. She has been an effective community 
advocate for communities of color in her roles 
as a life member and the former first vice 
president of the National Association for the 
Advancement of Colored People’s (NAACP) 
Vallejo Branch, receiving the President’s 
Award in 1988. 
Ms. Taylor currently serves as the Senior 
Community Development Analyst in the Eco-
nomic Development Division in the city of 
Vallejo. In 2000 and 2020, Ms. Taylor received 
the California on Location Award as the Em-
ployee of the Year for Cities for her many 
years of professionally supporting the film in-
dustry and their activities. She has utilized her 
personal and professional successes to lift 
worthy causes in our community. Further, as a 
consummate philanthropist, Ms. Taylor has 
donated to the arts, public broadcasting and 
veterans. 
Madam Speaker, Ms. Annette Taylor is a 
lifelong public servant, dedicated to giving 
back to our community of Vallejo, and a great 
friend. It is therefore fitting and proper that we 
honor Ms. Annette Taylor here today as So-
lano County’s 2020 Woman of the Year.

Had I been present for Roll Call Vote 88 on 
the COVID–19 Bankruptcy Relief Extension 
Act of 2021 (H.R. 1651), I would have voted 
yea. During the COVID–19 pandemic, small 
businesses and American families have strug-
gled to make ends meet. This bill offers critical 
support to businesses by extending the bank-
ruptcy relief provisions in the CARES Act for 
another year. I was honored to vote for these 
provisions in the CARES Act and am a strong 
supporter of extending them. In keeping with 
the spirit of this legislation, I will continue to 
advocate for relief to small businesses and 
economic recovery in the wake of COVID.

INTRODUCTION OF THE END OIL 
AND GAS TAX SUBSIDIES ACT 
OF 2021 
HON. EARL BLUMENAUER 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 26, 2021 
Mr. 
BLUMENAUER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
America faces a climate crisis. This fact is in-
disputable, as is the fact that humans are pri-
mary cause of the changing climate. But our 
tax code does not reflect this, instead it show-
ers billions of dollars of benefits to profitable 
oil and gas companies. Today, I introduced 
the End Oil and Gas Tax Subsidies Act of 
2021, legislation that would eliminate nearly a 
dozen of the most egregious tax breaks en-
joyed by the oil and gas industry. 
Despite consistent profitability, fossil fuel 
companies receive billions of dollars in federal 
tax breaks and subsidies, which underwrite 
the costs of oil and gas production. These for-
gone revenues undermine the United States’ 
ability to combat the climate crisis and invest 
in critical initiatives like education, housing, in-
frastructure, and healthcare. The End Oil and 
Gas Tax Subsidies Act of 2021 would not only 
eliminate 11 of these provisions in the tax 
code, it would also ensure the United States 
is no longer providing tax subsidies to oil and 
gas at the expense of clean energy, increas-
ing the competitiveness of the energy industry. 
I look forward to working with my colleagues 
in the House and Senate to get this legislation 
enacted into law this year.

pandemic. Monica also volunteered to lead a 
COVID–19 testing site and later spearheaded 
the vaccine operation at the hospital. Under 
her leadership and diligence, Keystone Health 
has not wasted a single COVID–19 vaccine 
dose. 
Monica exhibits true dedication, compas-
sion, and professionalism to the patients at 
Keystone Health. On behalf of Pennsylvania’s 
13th District, I congratulate Monica on this in-
credible work and thank her for her service to 
our community.

Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Sabrina 
Zuniga for receiving the Arvada Wheat Ridge 
Service Ambassadors for Youth award. 
Sabrina Zuniga is a student at Jefferson Jr./

I extend my deepest congratulations to 
Sabrina Zuniga for winning the Arvada Wheat 
Ridge Service Ambassador for Youth award. I 
have no doubt she will exhibit the same dedi-
cation and character in all of her future ac-
complishments.

HONORING 
THE 
LIFE 
OF 
MONTFORD POINT MARINE ROB-
ERT MOORE 
HON. MIKE LEVIN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 26, 2021 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to pay tribute to Robert Moore, who 
passed away on February 25, 2021, after a 
lifetime of service to his country. 
Robert was born in 1929 in Queens, New 
York. After enlisting in the Marines in 1946, he 
became one of approximately 20,000 Black 
men to train at the segregated Camp Montford 
Point in North Carolina. The Montford Point 
Marines were regularly subjected to racist at-
tacks from White Marines stationed at Camp 
Lejeune. 
Robert spent over four decades at Camp 
Pendleton, which I am proud to represent. He 
served honorably in the Korean and Vietnam 
Wars, where he ran mess halls and trained 
Marines in food service. In 1972, he retired 
from the Marine Corps at the rank of gunnery 
sergeant and received his degree from Pal-
omar College. He spent the following 20 years 
working at Camp Pendleton as a dietic techni-
cian at the Naval Hospital. 
Robert was one of the last surviving 
Montford Point Marines in the San Diego area. 
Fewer than 400 of the original 20,000 
Montford Point Marines are still living. He was 
a proud recipient of a Congressional Gold 
Medal awarded to all Montford Point Marines. 
Robert was married to his wife Willie Mae 
Miles for 56 years before her death in 2004. 
They had 11 children, 19 grandchildren, 47 
great-grandchildren, and 10 great-great grand-
children. 
Robert Moore lived an incredible and full 
life. He was a dedicated husband, parent, and 
friend. His courage and valor laid the founda-
tion for future generations. We are grateful for 
his service to his country.

HONORING LUKE WALDROP 
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 26, 2021 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
honor of Louis Stephens ‘‘Luke’’ Waldrop Sr. 
of Salem, Virginia, who passed away on 
March 12, 2021 at the age of 97. Mr. Waldrop 
was a real estate developer and philanthropist 
who made a tremendous impact on Salem 
throughout his long and active life. 
Mr. Waldrop was born on June 11, 1923 to 
Alexander 
Atkinson 
and 
Carolyn 
Bear 
Waldrop. He grew up in Roanoke and at-
tended Episcopal High School in Alexandria. 
His collegiate studies at the University of Vir-
ginia (UVA) were interrupted by World War II, 
in which he served as a Navy medic in the 
Pacific theater. After completing his service, 
Mr. Waldrop returned to UVA to finish his de-
gree and married Harriett, at the time a senior 
at Mary Baldwin College. 
After a stint in Richmond, Mr. Waldrop 
moved with his young family back to his native 
Roanoke Valley. His brother John introduced 
him to R.L. Russ, who educated him in the 
real estate business. Mr. Waldrop launched 
his own company, L.S. Waldrop Realty, in 
1956. 
Much of our country was remade by the 
housing boom that followed World War II. It 
was Luke Waldrop that harnessed that boom 
to remake Salem. With a keen sense for deal 
making and closing the sale, he drove forward 
residential and business development. Mid-
dleton 
Gardens, 
West 
Club 
Forest, 
Woodbridge, Spartan Square, Salem Terrace 
at Harrogate, Caroline Forest Apartments, and 
over 900 single family homes resulted from his 
professional efforts. 
Mr. Waldrop was devoted to charitable 
causes and community organizations in Salem 
and beyond. Among the educational institu-
tions that benefited from his contributions and 
support for endowed scholarships are his alma 
mater UVA, Roanoke College, Mary Baldwin 
College, Virginia Western Community College,

vestry at St. Paul’s Episcopal Church, be-
longed to and at one time served as president 
of the Salem Rotary, and served on the Roa-
noke County Planning Commission. 
Mr. Waldrop was preceded in death by his 
first wife, Harriett, his second wife, Anne 
‘‘Dickie’’ Dickson Jordon Waldrop, and grand-
son Adam Thomas Waldrop. He is survived by 
children Kathryn Kerkering (Tom), Caroline 
Buckman Haddock, Louis Stephens ‘‘Steve’’ 
Waldrop Jr., Preston Adam Waldrop (Jamie), 
Harriett Ann Waldrop, and Laura Doub 
(Bruce); thirteen grandchildren; two step- 
grandchildren; and numerous great-grand-
children. I offer them my condolences on the 
loss of Luke Waldrop, a member of the Great-
est Generation who changed Salem for the 
better over his many decades in business and 
in service.

HONORING HOPE REYES LUGO AS 
THE 2020 WOMAN OF THE YEAR 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 26, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Hope Reyes 
Lugo, whom I have named the 2020 Woman 
of the Year in Napa County, California. 
Woman of the Year recognizes women who 
have made important contributions to Califor-
nia’s 5th Congressional District in Arts and 
Culture, Professional Achievement, Entrepre-
neurship and Innovation or Community Serv-
ice. 
Born in San Bernardino, California, Ms. 
Lugo was the oldest of 13 children. At just 24 
years old, she moved with her husband and 
family to Napa, where they settled perma-
nently. Originally finding work on small farms, 
Lugo picked up extra jobs to support her fam-
ily, enrolling her children in the community 
Head Start program with the hope of giving 
them better lives. 
Never one to leave her family’s wellbeing in 
the hands of others, she joined the parent pol-
icy council and became a Head Start instruc-
tor. Earning the trust and admiration of our 
community for her advocacy on behalf of farm 
workers and her poor neighbors, she was later 
appointed to the Napa County Council for 
Economic Opportunity (NCCEO) Board of Di-
rectors. Graduating to the role of Executive Di-
rector in 1970, she served with pride and dis-
tinction for 30 years. Throughout her tenure as 
director, she took on numerous other civic and 
philanthropic responsibilities, including mem-
bership in the Napa Latino Leadership Organi-
zation and the President’s Commission on the 
White House Conference for Children and 
Youth. 
Our community and the nation have recog-
nized Ms. Lugo for her leadership numerous 
times. In 1990, the Department of Health and 
Human Services bestowed the National Head 
Start Award on her for providing an excep-
tional education to her students. Ten years 
later, the city of Napa further celebrated her 
impact on children by dedicating the Hope 
Lugo Child Development Center in her honor. 
Most recently, in 2014, the Napa County His-
panic Chamber of Commerce awarded her the 
Building a Legacy Award to Ms. Lugo for near-
ly six decades of distinguished service. 
Though her accolades are many, Hope takes 
the greatest pride in being matriarch of a 
large, devoted family. A caring mother, a dot-
ing grandmother, a cherished great-grand-
mother, and a teacher in the truest sense of 
the word, she has intimately shaped the expe-
riences of children across generations. 
Madam Speaker, Hope Lugo is a great 
friend and has dedicated her life to the com-
munities and people she holds dear. It is 
therefore fitting and proper we honor her here 
today as Napa County’s 2020 Woman of the 
Year.

MILITARY RETIREE SURVIVOR 
COMFORT ACT 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 26, 2021 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, today I 
reintroduce the ‘‘Military Retiree Survivor Com-
fort Act,’’ with Congressman MIKE TURNER (R– 
OH) as the original cosponsor. 
The late Congressman Walter B. Jones, Jr. 
(R–NC), my dear friend and our beloved col-
league, sponsored the ‘‘Military Retiree Sur-
vivor Comfort Act’’ every Congress since 
2002. I am honored to continue his work on 
this critical, bipartisan legislation to protect 
military families from completely avoidable 
bank overdrafts following a veteran’s death. 
Specifically, the ‘‘Military Retiree Survivor 
Comfort Act’’ would allow the spouse or other 
designated survivor/beneficiary of a veteran to 
retain the full retirement benefit paid out in the 
final month just before or coinciding with the 
veteran’s death. Under current Department of 
Defense policy, that final month’s retirement 
benefit may be clawed back on a prorated 
basis if the family fails to immediately notify 
the Defense Finance and Accounting Services 
(DFAS) of their veteran’s death. 
Military families with joint bank accounts, 
into which retirement payments are deposited 
electronically, are often unaware that DFAS 
can claw back overpayments without the 
accountholder’s consent. This results in joint 
bank accounts being drained of funds, sub-
jecting veterans’ families to overdraft fees and 
avoidable financial hardship following a vet-
eran’s death. 
The ‘‘Military Retiree Survivor Comfort Act’’ 
would finally end this needless and callous 
DFAS practice for any retirement benefit re-
ceived in the month for which a veteran was 
alive for at least 24 hours. Military families 
grieving the loss of their loved one should not 
be penalized for an accounting oversight by 
the Department of Defense. 
As chairman of the House Armed Services 
Subcommittee on Readiness, I plan to make 
the ‘‘Military Retiree Survivor Comfort Act’’ a 
major priority during this year’s National De-
fense Authorization Act (NDAA). 
Madam Speaker, I urge all Members to join 
me and Congressman TURNER (R–OH) in co-
sponsoring this bipartisan and commonsense 
bill. 
IN RECOGNITION OF TAMMY 
MACLAY 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA

Friday, March 26, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to congratulate Tammy Maclay 
on receiving the Exceptional Dedication Award 
from the Greater Chambersburg Chamber of 
Commerce. 
Tammy is a Clinical Nurse Specialist at 
WellSpan Chambersburg Hospital, where she 
has selflessly served patients for more than 33 
years. Though her specialty was teaching hos-
pital staff safe practices, she never hesitated 
transition into work in the Critical Care Unit 
with COVID-positive patients during the pan-
demic. 
Tammy exhibits true dedication, compas-
sion, and professionalism to the patients at 
WellSpan Chambersburg Hospital. On behalf 
of Pennsylvania’s 13th District, I congratulate 
Tammy on this achievement and thank her for 
her service to our community.

INTRODUCTION OF THE OFFICE OF 
MANUFACTURING & INDUSTRIAL 
POLICY ACT 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 26, 2021 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, manufac-
turing is not just America’s legacy; it is our fu-
ture. To ensure this legacy remains, we need 
to position domestic manufacturing and the 
American worker at the center of federal pol-
icy. 
America’s manufacturing and innovation 
sectors are second to none. When we work 
together and support America’s domestic man-
ufacturing ecosystem, there is nothing in this 
world we cannot achieve. 
As a daughter of the industrial Midwest, the 
strong, hardworking city of Toledo, Ohio, I 
know firsthand how important a strong manu-
facturing sector is to American families and 
their communities. 
It is for these workers, their forbearers and 
future generation of manufactures yet to 
come, that I am so pleased to author and in-
troduce the bipartisan, bicameral Office of 
Manufacturing and Industrial Innovation Policy 
Act. 
The global coronavirus pandemic exposed 
how vulnerable the United States has become 
as a result of over-reliance on international 
supply chains. Yet these lessons provide op-
portunity in both economic recovery and to 
reposition American manufacturing for long- 
term prosperity. To do this, we need an Office 
at the highest level to coordinate, strengthen, 
and rebuild America’s manufacturing leader-
ship. The Office of Manufacturing and Indus-
trial Innovation Policy Act provides this oppor-
tunity. 
This legislation will create within the Execu-
tive Office of the President (EOP) an Office of 
Manufacturing and Industrial Innovation (OMII) 
to elevate and coordinate manufacturing and 
industrial innovation policy. The Office will syn-
thesize information from inter and intra gov-
ernmental engagements, as well as advice 
from the manufacturing sector, including small 
businesses, labor unions, academics, and 
nongovernmental bodies. 
This bipartisan legislation will elevate focus 
to address critical challenges facing the Amer-
ican manufacturing industry, establish key 
agency coordination and cross-administration 
management efforts to ensure global leader-
ship in manufacturing and trade, improve 
workforce development and job creation for 
the future, enhance research and develop-
ment, and develop a long-term strategy to en-
sure the growth and national security of the 
U.S. manufacturing industry, workforce, and 
economy. In summary, provisions included in 
each of the titles establish the following initia-
tives: 
Title I. Establishes Policy and Priority Objec-
tives for U.S. Manufacturing and Industrial In-
novation: lays out goals to promote a thriving 
manufacturing and industrial sector, enhanced 
and fortified by coordinated efforts to address 
the enumerated policies and priorities, focused 
through comprehensive strategy implemented 
at the highest-level. 
Title II. Entities to Advance a Cohesive U.S. 
Manufacturing and Industrial Innovation Agen-
da Creates The Office of Manufacturing and 
Industrial Innovation Policy, modeled on the 
Executive Office of Science and Technology 
Policy, to provide manufacturing and industrial 
perspective and advice to the President, and 
provide a comprehensive survey and cross 
administration management of efforts to en-
sure global leadership in manufacturing critical 
to the long-term health and national security of 
the United States. 
A Chief Manufacturing Officer (CMO) will 
serve as Director of OMII and advisor to the 
President. The CMO will lead coordination of 
manufacturing and industrial innovation initia-
tives across the federal Government and work 
with representatives in State and local govern-
ment, labor, non-governmental groups, and 
private business to develop and implement en-
hanced coordination of manufacturing policy. 
OMII will develop and update a National 
Strategic Plan, quadrennially, with short and 
long-term goals to ensure American leadership 
in manufacturing. 
Title III. Establishes the President’s Com-
mittee on Manufacturing and Industrial Innova-
tion, comprised of representatives from the 
business, consumer, defense, public interest, 
and labor sectors to analyze the landscape of 
manufacturing efforts and activities in America. 
The Committee will be apportioned by the 
President and report on the state of manufac-
turing 
and 
provide 
recommendations 
to 
strengthen the sector through federal policies 
and initiatives. 
Title IV. Establishes the Federal Strategy 
and Coordinating Council on Manufacturing 
and Industrial Innovation, chaired by the Presi-
dent, to coordinate manufacturing and indus-
trial innovation policy. The Council will con-
vene the heads of various executive agen-
cies—including Secretaries of Commerce, 
Labor, HHS, DOD, and Energy—to establish 
national priorities and coordinated strategies 
for manufacturing and industrial innovation 
policy and investment. 
Title V. Establishes a Federally Funded Re-
search & Development Center: The Manufac-
turing and Industrial Innovation Policy Institute 
to gather, analyze, initiate studies, and assist 
the federal government on issues and con-
cerns related to American manufacturing and 
industrial innovation. The National Institute of 
Standards and Technology will sponsor the In-
stitute. 
Title VI. Creates a National Medal of Manu-
facturing and Industrial Innovation to recognize 
outstanding contributions to knowledge in 
manufacturing and industrial innovation. 
Title VII. Appropriations: authorizes sums as 
needed, but specifies $5 million per title for 
the first year for Title 2, Title 3, Title 4, Title 
5. 
America’s manufacturing legacy is one of 
prosperity and progress. This Office provides 
the opportunity to once again prioritize U.S. 
manufacturing and industrial innovation to sup-
port job creation and America’s long-term eco-
nomic strength. 
Given the lofty efforts of this Office, the leg-
islation earned endorsement of numerous 
groups, including: the Aerospace Industries 
Association (AIA), the Alliance for American 
Manufacturing 
(AAM), 
the 
AFL–CIO, 
the 
American Mold Builders Association (AMBA), 
the American Small Manufacturers Coalition 
(ASMC), the Association for Manufacturing 
Technology (AMT), the Can Manufacturers In-
stitute (CMI), the Industrial Fasteners Institute 
(IFI), the International Association of Machin-
ists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), the Inter-
national 
Economic 
Development 
Council 
(IEDC), the International Federation of Profes-
sional and Technical Engineers (IFPTE), the 
Information Technology and Innovation Foun-
dation (ITIF), the Motor & Equipment Manufac-
turers Association (MEMA), the National Asso-
ciation of Manufacturing (NAM), the National 
Tooling and Machining Association (NTMA), 
the Precision Metalforming Association (PMA), 
the Precision Machined Products Association 
(PMPA), the State Science & Technology In-
stitute (SSTI), the International Union of 
United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricul-
tural Implement Workers of America (UAW), 
and the United Steel Workers (USW). 
Here is a glimpse of what the groups and 
experts across the country have to say about 
the importance of this effort: 
The U.S. has seen massive supply chain 
disruptions due to COVID–19, which have re-
quired small manufacturers to rapidly re-
invent both their products and their serv-
ices. Representative Kaptur and Senator 
Klobuchar understand the challenges facing 
American manufacturers and have dem-
onstrated long standing support for this crit-
ical industry, said Chuck Spangler, board 
chair of the American Small Manufacturers 
Coalition (ASMC) and president of the South 
Carolina Manufacturing Extension Partner-
ship. ‘‘We at ASMC thank them for their 
leadership and we look forward to working 
with them in the future.’’ 
The COVID pandemic laid bare what many 
of us have been saying for years—the United 
States is long overdue for a comprehensive, 
national 
manufacturing 
and 
innovation 
strategy. The foundation laid in this bipar-
tisan bill to create an Office of Manufac-
turing and Industrial Innovation Policy and 
a federal plan for manufacturing will go a 
long way to making that a reality. The AFL– 
CIO is proud to endorse this important bill. 
Brad Markell, Executive Director AFL–CIO 
Industrial Union Council 
The decisions made by every federal de-
partment affects manufacturers, often with 
unintended consequences. The Office of Man-
ufacturing and Industrial Innovation Policy 
Act will help make sure small and medium 
sized manufacturers have a strong voice 
within the federal government and help 
agencies coordinate policies that encourage 
domestic 
manufacturing. 
Precision 
Ma-
chined Products Association 
The Machinists Union applauds Senators 
lobuchar, Wicker, Coons. and Portman, and 
Representative Kaptur and Representative 
Fitzpatrick for not only recognizing the crit-
ical importance of the U.S. manufacturing 
industry, but for also proposing long awaited 
legislation that will rebuild U.S. manufac-
turing for a sustainable future. The bipar-
tisan Office of Manufacturing and Industrial 
Innovation Policy Act places a priority on 
creating the kind of high wage jobs that 
American workers and our economy need 
now and for future generations. Inter-

advanced manufacturing, rebuild the na-
tional manufacturing innovation ecosystem, 
and rekindle American ingenuity. OMII is 
designed to provide a much needed national 
strategy and requisite policy implementa-
tion to ensure that what is invented here is 
manufactured here to deliver a return on in-
vestment of taxpayer dollars in science and 
technology.—Sridhar Kota, Executive Direc-
tor, MForesight: Alliance for Manufacturing 
Foresight; Herrick Professor of Engineering, 
University of Michigan. 
‘‘The fastener industry makes the nuts, 
bolts and screws that hold the world to-
gether. We are pleased to support this legis-
lation to elevate manufacturing within the 
Executive Office of the President, and to bet-
ter coordinate the various manufacturing 
initiatives across the federal government as 
the U.S. focuses on a needed national manu-
facturing strategy.’’—Dan Walker, Managing 
Director, Industrial Fasteners Institute 
I thank my colleagues, Representatives 
HALEY STEVENS, TIM RYAN, BRIAN FITZPATRICK, 
and CHUCK FLEISCHMANN for introducing this 
bipartisan bill with me in the House, and Sen-
ators AMY KLOBUCHAR, ROGER WICKER, CHRIS 
COONS, and ROB PORTMAN for their leadership 
on this bill in the Senate. Additionally, I would 
like to acknowledge Jenny Perrino, my Deputy 
Chief of Staff and Legislative Director, for her 
hard work to craft this legislation and bring it 
to the line. Together, I am confident we can 
champion this bill through Congress and to the 
President’s desk without delay. America’s 
manufacturing workers deserve nothing less.

INTRODUCTION OF THE PAY 
EQUITY FOR ALL ACT OF 2021 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 26, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise to in-
troduce the Pay Equity for All Act of 2021, 
which would help eliminate the gender and ra-
cial pay gap by prohibiting employers from 
asking job applicants for their salary history 
before making a job or salary offer. Even 
though many employers may not intentionally 
discriminate against applicants or employees 
based on gender, race or ethnicity, setting 
wages based on salary history can reinforce 
the wage gap. Members of historically dis-
advantaged groups often start their careers 
with unfair and artificially low wages compared 
to their white male counterparts, and the dis-
parities are compounded from job to job 
throughout their careers. Last Congress, the 
House passed the Pay Equity for All Act as 
part of the Paycheck Fairness Act (H.R. 7). 
The Pay Equity for All Act would help en-
sure that applicants’ salaries are based on 
their skills and merit, not on salary history, by 
assessing penalties against employers that 
ask applicants for their salary history during 
the interview process or as a condition of em-
ployment. It would also provide job applicants 
and employees with a private right of action 
against employers that violate these provi-
sions. 
There is much work to be done to address 
the wage gap. This bill would be an important 
step toward addressing these disparities. 
I urge my colleagues to support this bill. 
JUANITA LEWIS ARREOLA 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 26, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Juanita Lewis 
Arreola for receiving the Arvada Wheat Ridge 
Service Ambassadors for Youth award. 
Juanita Lewis Arreola is a student at Arvada 
High School and received this award because 
her determination and hard work have allowed 
her to overcome adversities. 
The dedication demonstrated by Juanita 
Lewis Arreola is exemplary of the type of 
achievement that can be attained with hard 
work and perseverance. It is essential stu-
dents at all levels strive to make the most of 
their education and develop a work ethic 
which will guide them for the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to Jua-
nita Lewis Arreola for winning the Arvada 
Wheat Ridge Service Ambassador for Youth 
award. I have no doubt she will exhibit the 
same dedication and character in all of her fu-
ture accomplishments.

OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Jeanie Hahn of Jennings County, Indi-

Jeanie served as the Republican County 
Chairwoman of Jennings County. She com-
mitted her time, talents and energy to the 
Sixth Congressional District and the rest of the 
Hoosier state. I am grateful for her service. 
Jeanie is actively engaged in civic and com-
munity endeavors, often the first to volunteer 
her time and always willing to help at a mo-
ment’s notice. She is a passionate social 
worker and has dedicated her life to helping 
victims of domestic violence. 
Finally, Jeanie has become a dear friend 
over the last four years, and I am grateful for 
her friendship. 
I thank Jeanie Hahn.

OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Mr. CASTEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today

Anne and Gail were instrumental in con-
vincing me to first run for office, helping to 
build a campaign team, and then served as 
my co-district directors for the last 2 and one- 
half years. For that, I owe them my eternal 
personal gratitude. 
But I am ultimately a side story. Anne and 
Gail share my belief that the office is bigger 
and more important than the officeholder, and 
never shied away from reminding me of my

relative insignificance. They did not seek pub-
lic office, nor even to become district directors. 
But they were called to it. Anne is a 27-year 
Navy Veteran. She’s also a mother and a 
community leader. We met her when my own 
wife joined the local PTA, came home and 
said ‘‘you’ve got to meet Anne. She gets stuff 
done.’’ Gail is a retired law partner, volunteers 
as an organ courier and has been active for 
years with the local League of Women Voters. 
These are necessarily incomplete resumes, 
highlighted here only to illustrate that they did 
not need to become politically involved. But 
the times found them. They wanted a govern-
ment that worked. Not just for them, but for all 
Americans. Not just in times of crisis, but be-
fore crises to avert them. And so, after the 
2016 election, they heeded the words of our 
own speaker. They did not agonize, they orga-
nized. 
In their capacity as my co-district directors, 
their commitment to good government has 
never waned. First when they set up a district 
office. Then when they helped senior citizens 
get their social security checks. When they 
helped a World War II ‘‘Atomic Veteran’’ se-
cure long-overdue veterans benefits. When 
they organized events to draw attention to un-
sung women in our district who provide full 
women’s health services in a church base-
ment in the pre-Roe era. When they helped 
young high school students to learn about, 
and ultimately secure admission to our Na-
tion’s great service academies. In these exam-
ples, and so many more, public service came 
first. 
Anne and Gail are emblematic of the mil-
lions of under-appreciated, unsung women 
who got engaged and stepped up to protect 
our democracy in 2017. They are a part of 
that crucial slice of the American electorate 
who have proven William Seward’s observa-
tion that there has always been ‘‘just enough 
virtue in this nation to save it—sometimes 
none to spare, but still enough.’’ They are, in 
short, two remarkable women who deserve 
more recognition than they seek, and certainly 
more than I can provide in these few words. 
To loosely paraphrase former Saturday Night 
Live actor Harry Shearer ‘‘Give me a Wick and 
a Kalinich, and there is nothing I cannot do.’’ 
I am grateful to them both for their friend-
ship, for their service to the people of Illinois’ 
6th Congressional district, for their patriotism. 
Our office, this body, and our nation will for-
ever be in their debt.

IN RECOGNITION OF ASHLI YODER 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 26, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to congratulate Ashli Yoder on 
receiving the Rising Star Award from the 
Greater Chambersburg Chamber of Com-
merce. 
Ashli began working for Norland Avenue 
Pharmacy at the beginning of the COVID–19 
pandemic. Since then, she and her team have 
been crucial to the growth of their in-house 
medication synchronization program. Ashli has 
been charged with the vaccine distribution at 
the hospital. Under her leadership, they pro-
vided more than 750 vaccine doses in March. 
Her work has been invaluable to the Cham-
bersburg community. 
Ashli exhibits true dedication, compassion, 
and professionalism to the clients at Norland 
Avenue Pharmacy. On behalf of Pennsylva-
nia’s 13th District, I congratulate Ashli on this 
award and thank her for her service to our 
community.

COMMEMORATING THE 1971 
BENGALI GENOCIDE 
HON. JUDY CHU 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 26, 2021 
Ms. CHU. Madam Speaker, I join with my 
Bengali constituents to honor and commemo-
rate the tragedy that befell Bangladesh 50 
years ago and the millions whose lives were 
lost or disrupted. 
The 1971 Bengali Genocide was one of the 
worst human tragedies of the 20th century, 
with over 2 million lives lost and over 10 mil-
lion displaced. In addition, over 200,000 
women were violently raped. The campaign of 
sexual violence against women in particular 
was so severe that the United Nations was 
bringing in doctors to help treat these women. 
These terrible events began on March 25, 
1971, with ‘‘Operation Searchlight’’—a military 
operation that intentionally targeted civilians 
because of the language they spoke and the 
religion they practiced. It was a deliberately 
brutal response meant to silence Bengali 
voices and erase Bengali culture while snuff-
ing out the flame of self-determination. 
Fortunately, this genocidal attempt failed, 
but not before too many paid the ultimate 
price. And the survivors still carry their scars, 
even fifty years later. 
This violence was made worse by the failure 
of the United States to speak out against it. 
That is why I am urging the U.S. government 
and all Americans of conscience to not only 
join me in remembering this genocide and 
those we lost, but also to speak out against 
this kind of violence against civilians wherever 
it occurs. I also encourage more Americans to 
learn about what happened in the 1971 Ben-
gali Massacre so that we can start telling the 
truth about this genocide.

HONORING EMMA C. CHAPPELL 
HON. BRENDAN F. BOYLE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 26, 2021 
Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, it is my honor to ask the 
House of Representatives to join me in hon-
oring Emma C. Chappell, a pioneer in the 
banking community who passed away on 
March 16th at the age of 80. 
Mrs. Chappell was born Emma Carolyn 
Bayton in Philadelphia in 1941. Raised by her 
father after her mother passed away when she 
was 14 years old, Mrs. Chappell graduated 
from West Philadelphia High School. At the 
age of 16, her pastor and civil rights activist 
Leon H. Sullivan recognized her aptitude for 
mathematics and encouraged her to go into 
banking. After high school, Mrs. Chappell be-
came a clerk photographer at Continental 
Bank in 1959. 
Mrs. Chappell set her sights on becoming a 
top bank executive, determined to use her grit 
and tenacity to succeed. As a newlywed to her 
husband, Verdayne, Mrs. Chappell attended 
Temple University at night for five years. In 
1971, after completing an executive program 
that allowed her to work in several different 
departments and gain invaluable experience, 
she was promoted to Assistant Treasurer of 
Continental Bank. In 1977, she was promoted 
to Vice President at Continental, the first Afri-
can American to serve in that role and the first 
female Vice President of a major bank in 
Pennsylvania. In this capacity, Mrs. Chappell 
oversaw the Community Business Loan and 
Development Department, granting more than 
$30 million in loans to African American and 
women owned businesses. 
In 1992, after a five-year effort to raise the 
$5 million that was then required to capitalize 
a bank, Mrs. Chappell founded the United 
Bank of Philadelphia, becoming the first Afri-
can American woman to charter a commercial 
bank in the United States. At the same time, 
she began to expand her good work beyond 
the banking world. She was one of the found-
ers of the Rainbow Coalition, the organization 
founded by Jesse Jackson to promote racial 
equality. She also worked to organize what 
would later become the Philadelphia Commer-
cial Development Project. During her 20-year 
tenure in banking, Mrs. Chappell held an im-
pressive record of a less than one percent 
loan loss ratio, despite offering loans to those 
who might be turned away by other financial 
institutions. 
Emma Chappell was a trailblazer in the 
banking community and leaves behind a leg-
acy of using her position to bring new opportu-
nities and resources to underserved Philadel-
phians. Although she is no longer with us, her 
work will continue to live on and inspire gen-
erations to come.

MEMORIALIZING THE INTENT OF 
THE TRIBAL PORTION OF THE 
CORONAVIRUS RELIEF FUND IN 
THE CORONAVIRUS AID, RELIEF, 
AND ECONOMIC SECURITY ACT 
(CARES ACT) 
HON. RAUL RUIZ 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 26, 2021 
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
highlight a critical portion of the American 
Rescue Plan that will help native communities 
across our country mitigate and recover from 
the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. 
I am proud to have helped lead the fight to 
secure the $20 billion Coronavirus Recovery 
Fund for Tribal Governments. It is essential 
that this fund is implemented swiftly and equi-
tably by the Treasury Department as intended 
by Congress and following meaningful Tribal 
consultation. 
Nearly a year ago, Tribal governments 
across the country, recognizing the imminent 
public health threat, voluntarily closed their 
business and government operations to stem 
the spread of COVID–19. 
Many Tribal businesses in California’s 36th 
District and throughout the State remained 
closed for months. It was this sacrifice, and 
the sacrifice that millions of Americans made 
to shelter in place and minimize social gath-
erings, that prevented this pandemic from 
claiming hundreds of thousands more lives. 
For Tribal governments, the implications of 
the economic shutdown are hard to under-
state. In addition to supporting the workers 
they employ and meeting basic commercial 
obligations, Tribal governments rely on the 
revenue generated by their businesses to pro-
vide health care, education, emergency serv-
ices, housing, security, sanitation, and more 
for their members. Tribal governments, unlike 
state and county governments, do not have a 
tax base to raise revenue. Shutting down their 
businesses meant losing the revenue that sup-
ports essential government services. 
That is why the Coronavirus Recovery Fund 
for Tribal governments in the American Res-
cue Plan is so important. It is also important 
to address several issues and lessons learned 
from the distribution of these funds following 
the passage of the CARES Act. 
First, Treasury should allow Tribal govern-
ments to certify their population counts. In the 
CARES Act allocation, some Tribes were im-
properly listed as having zero population, 
while many more were severely undercounted 
based on their historical participation in Indian 
housing programs. This flawed policy resulted 
in some Tribes losing out on significant fund-
ing and it must be fixed in the implementation 
of the American Rescue Plan. 
Second, it is critical that Tribal governments 
be given maximum flexibility in determining 
how they use funding provided to them from 
the Coronavirus Recovery Fund. Whether it is 
replacing lost revenue, making necessary cap-
ital investments, or providing health coverage 
to members, it should be up to the Tribal gov-
ernments to evaluate and determine the best 
use of this funding. This flexibility should also 
recognize the unique nature and function of 
Tribal governments as opposed to state or 
municipal governments. 
Lastly, I encourage Treasury to adopt a 
more equitable formula that better takes into 
account the disparate economic impacts that 
COVlD–19 related shutdowns have had on 
Tribal governments and employees. In the im-
plementation of the CARES Act many in my 
district were still left facing severe budget cuts. 
A formula that includes a proper weight to-
wards economic factors would help address 
this issue, while also providing aid to those 
Tribes who were more economically injured by 
the pandemic.

COMMEMORATING THE 
RETIREMENT OF LISA NELSON 
HON. JAKE AUCHINCLOSS 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 26, 2021 
Mr. AUCHINCLOSS. Madam Speaker, it is 
my honor and privilege to recognize Lisa Nel-
son on the occasion of her retirement after 15 
years of dedicated service to the Massachu-
setts Fourth Congressional District and innu-
merable years of service to the community at 
large. 
Lisa was born and raised in Attleboro, Mas-
sachusetts. After graduating from Attleboro 
High School and Wheaton College, she in-
spired children by beginning her career as a 
fifth-grade teacher. After transitioning into a 
career of inspiring her own children at home, 
Lisa would eventually start her own business 
doing real estate appraisals. 
All throughout, Lisa’s commitment to the At-
tleboro area has never wavered. She was the 
first woman to be appointed as Fire Commis-
sioner for the City of Attleboro and recently 
served a term on the city Board of Assessors. 
She sat on the Attleboro Tricentennial com-
mittee and has held multiple positions on 
Boards of Directors for community organiza-
tions, such as Big Brothers Big Sisters, New 
Hope, The Sturdy Memorial Hospital Founda-
tion and Attleboro Enterprises—working to im-
prove the lives of some of those most vulner-
able populations. Lisa is also active not only 
within her own church but with the Attleboro 
Area Interfaith Collaborative which is a signifi-
cant resource in addressing food insecurity in 
the area. 
Lisa began her tenure with the House in 
2006, serving as a District Representative for 
Congressman Jim McGovern when his district 
included the City of Attleboro. Most recently, 
she served as District Director for Congress-
man Joe Kennedy and Senior Advisor with my 
office. 
As I am sure my predecessors will agree, in 
a job that can have its share of difficult deci-
sions, choosing to work with Lisa is not one of 
them. 
Lisa approaches constituent service with an 
extraordinary amount of empathy and kind-
ness. She is a trusted mentor to those she 
works with and three Members of Congress 
came to rely on her knowledge of the district, 
its needs and navigating the challenges of the 
federal system. She is a true representative of 
the values of public service. 
It is difficult to truly capture the impact that 
Lisa has made for this office, district and 
countless constituents and their families but 
suffice it to say that her contributions will be 
missed. Though for those of us who know 
Lisa, we know those contributions will never 
truly end. 
ISABELLA CIOTTI 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 26, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Isabella Ciotti 
for receiving the Arvada Wheat Ridge Service 
Ambassadors for Youth award. 
Isabella Ciotti is a student at Arvada K–8 
and received this award because her deter-
mination and hard work have allowed her to 
overcome adversities. 
The dedication demonstrated by Isabella 
Ciotti is exemplary of the type of achievement 
that can be attained with hard work and perse-
verance. It is essential students at all levels 
strive to make the most of their education and 
develop a work ethic which will guide them for 
the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to Isa-
bella Ciotti for winning the Arvada Wheat 
Ridge Service Ambassador for Youth award. I 
have no doubt she will exhibit the same dedi-
cation and character in all of her future ac-
complishments.

HONORING NICOLE VANNOTE 
HON. GREG PENCE 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 26, 2021 
Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Nicole VanNote of Randolph County, In-
diana. Nicole has dedicated her service to im-
proving her community and helping get con-
servative officials elected. 
I want to thank Nicole for serving in the role 
of Randolph County Republican Vice-Chair. 
Nicole has helped move the conservative 
agenda forward, and I appreciate all the work 
she has done for her community and her sup-
port.

HON. LARRY BUCSHON

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Mr. BUCSHON. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to include in the RECORD clarifying com-
ments from Centers for Medicare and Med-
icaid Services (CMS) in response to a ques-
tion I asked during a House Energy and Com-
merce Committee Markup on February 12, 
2021. During the Markup, I asked about the 
scope of the Medicaid drug rebate provisions, 
specifically section 3101(a)(4), in the American 
Rescue Plan. 
CMS responded: ‘‘Regarding whether sec-
tion 3101(a)(4) preserves the status quo, we 
do not believe this language extends rebates 
to drugs or biological products not currently 
subject to rebates under the MDRP. Meaning, 
it keeps the status quo. 
‘‘We agree this provision is drafted similarly 
to the ‘fix’ for MAT. Like MAT, since states 
would be required to cover drugs under this 
new COVID treatment benefit, confirming that 
states would still be required to cover such 
drugs absent any rebate agreement. 
‘‘Note that we do not believe current statute 
compels a manufacturer to enter into a rebate 
agreement. So if the intent is to compel pay-
ment of rebates for drugs covered under this 
new benefit, this provision would have to be 
drafted differently.’’

REMEMBERING ROBERT ‘‘BOBBY’’ 
BIANCO 
HON. RAUL RUIZ 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 26, 2021 
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
celebrate the life of my constituent, Robert 
‘‘Bobby’’ Bianco—a remarkable community 
member and innovative grower who made his-
tory in the Coachella Valley. 
Mr. Bianco arrived in our Valley in 1965. He 
co-owned and operated Anthony Vineyards 
with his brother and drove economic growth 
and employed thousands of Valley residents 
over the past 50 years. 
Mr. Bianco was a leader in the grape indus-
try and was nationally known and recognized 
for his innovation. In fact, he was the first in 
the nation to commercially grow the red flame 
seedless grape in 1975, which rapidly grew to 
become one of the most popular table grapes 
produced in the world. This historic achieve-
ment drew people from near and far to visit 
our Valley and learn from his techniques. 
Mr. Bianco’s impact on the community ex-
tended beyond his ingenuity in the field. Along 
with his beloved wife, Harlene, he was in-
volved in local organizations such as the Boys 
and Girls Club, Big Brother Little Sisters of the 
Desert, and Desert Arc. Mr. Bianco also was 
involved in the formation of the Palm Valley 
School and the expansion of churches in our 
Valley, such as Our Lady of Perpetual Help, 
St. Francis Parish, Our Lady of Solidad, Our 
Lady of Guadalupe, and Sacred Heart. 
A friend and colleague of my father’s, I 
knew Mr. Bianco to be a kind and hardworking 
man who strived to instill positive change in 
our communities. He was a local leader, na-
tionally renowned grape grower, philanthropist, 
and lover of golf whose impact on our commu-
nity will be felt for years to come. 
Mr. Bianco is survived by his son, Anthony 
Bianco, and daughter, Francesca Gist, and his 
six grandchildren. 
Today, we celebrate his life and record his 
story in our nation’s history.

RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE 26TH AMENDMENT 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 26, 2021 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, March 23, 
2021 marked the 50th anniversary of Congres-
sional passage of the 26th Amendment to the 
Constitution, which extended the right to vote

March 26, 2021 
to 18–20-year-olds. This bipartisan amend-
ment was the culmination of young activists of 
all political parties and backgrounds coming 
together to fight for their democratic right. 
It was reported that some in Washington 
called the effort a ‘‘children’s crusade.’’ But 
those naysayers quickly learned one of Wash-
ington’s most important lessons: never doubt 
America’s youth. 
With the proud support of California’s former 
Members of Congress Don Edwards, Jerry 
Waldie, Pete McCloskey, Ab Mikva and oth-
ers, the Amendment passed the House 401– 
19, after Senate approval by a 94–0 vote, and 
gave more than 10 million 18-to-20-year-olds 
the right to vote. 
Since then, youth activism has remained a 
driving force to address our nation’s biggest 
issues. The global climate crisis, gun violence 
and police brutality have sparked worldwide 
movements for change led by young orga-
nizers. 
Half a century after Congress passed the 
26th Amendment, young voters face many 
roadblocks to registering to vote and actually 
being able to cast their ballots. Many young 
Americans aren’t educated on how to vote or 
register to vote, face challenges to voting ab-
sentee while studying away from home, and 
face the burden of having to go to class or 
work on Election Day. 
For young people of color, the challenges 
are even greater, as the overcriminalization of 
youth leads to adult felony convictions that bar 
them from voting in many states, fees that 
must be paid before voting, and arrests for 
low-level offenses that deter potential voters 
from showing up to the voting booth. 
H.R. 1, the For The People Act, which the 
House passed this month, would strengthen 
the 26th Amendment by requiring online voter 
registration, making absentee ballots more ac-
cessible, sending federal funds for colleges 
and universities to appoint a ‘‘campus vote co-
ordinator’’ to educate students on how they 
can vote and improve voter participation on 
campus, and ensure formerly incarcerated in-
dividuals have their right to vote restored 
when they reenter society. The bill also allows 
16- and 17-year-olds to preregister to vote, 
engaging future voters at a young age to en-
courage higher participation in the future. 
America’s youth are ambassadors to our fu-
ture. March 23rd is an anniversary to cele-
brate extraordinary progress made by vision-
aries whose shoulders we stand on today.

ERICKA CARIAS VALENZUELA 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 26, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Ericka Carias 
Valenzuela for receiving the Arvada Wheat 
Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth award. 
Ericka Carias Valenzuela is a student at Ar-
vada High School and received this award be-
cause her determination and hard work have 
allowed her to overcome adversities. 
The dedication demonstrated by Ericka 
Carias Valenzuela is exemplary of the type of 
achievement that can be attained with hard 
work and perseverance. It is essential stu-
dents at all levels strive to make the most of 
their education and develop a work ethic 
which will guide them for the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to 
Ericka Carias Valenzuela for winning the Ar-
vada Wheat Ridge Service Ambassador for 
Youth award. I have no doubt she will exhibit 
the same dedication and character in all of her 
future accomplishments.

HONORING BARBARA HACKMAN 
HON. GREG PENCE 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 26, 2021 
Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Barbara Hackman of my hometown of 
Columbus, Indiana. Barb served as the Re-
publican County Chairwoman of Bartholomew 
County for eight years. She committed her 
time, talents and energy to the Sixth Congres-
sional District and the rest of the Hoosier 
state. I am grateful for her service. 
Barb is always willing to lend a helping hand 
to her community, but her priority is her fam-
ily—her husband of 45 years, their daughters, 
and six beautiful grandchildren. 
Finally, Barb is a dear friend to the Pence 
family. We are all grateful for her friendship 
throughout the years.
