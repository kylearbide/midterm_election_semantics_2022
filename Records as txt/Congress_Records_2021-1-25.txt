PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
God of the ages for whom one day is 
like 1,000 years and 1,000 years a day, 
we come before You in gratitude for 
the days and years we are graced to 
enjoy. We are truly appreciative of the 
people with whom we journey in our 
lifetimes; for the lives You have al-
lowed us to share, for the joy that fills 
us in their presence, and for the love 
that You have given us through them. 
And when those days pass, we put our 
grief into Your tender care, praying 
that their memories will remain a 
blessing. We ask that You minister to 
us as we name in our hearts those 
whose loss is especially poignant: fam-
ily members, friends, mentors, and 
leaders. And in these days when our 
country mourns notables like Hank 
Aaron and Larry King, and the less 
conspicuous lives of over 400,000 who 
have died from COVID, as well as he-
roes who have given their lives in bat-
tle and the homeless who have lost 
their fight to survive, may our lives 
serve to bring honor to those who have 
gone before us. May all that we do 
today reflect not only gratitude for our 
days, but our debt to their years. 
We offer ourselves and our prayers to 
You in the strength of Your holy name. 
Amen.

Vol. 167 
WASHINGTON, MONDAY, JANUARY 25, 2021 
No. 14 
Senate 
The Senate met at 3 p.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. LEAHY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Almighty God, the rock of our salva-
tion, teach us to live as contemplative 
activists, reflecting Your sacred guid-
ance and obeying Your commands. 
Remind our lawmakers that You di-
rect the steps of good people, leading 
the faithful to the destination You 
have chosen. Lord, stir the hearts of 
our Senators until they possess a holi-
ness that strives to carve tunnels of 
hope through mountains of despair. 
We offer You our hearts, mighty God, 
for we trust Your prevailing and loving 
providence. 
We pray in Your great Name. Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Hawaii.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-

NOMINATION OF JANET LOUISE 
YELLEN 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
this week, the Senate will continue 
confirming President Biden’s highly 
qualified and history-making nomi-
nees. 
In a few hours we will hold a vote on 
Janet Yellen to serve as the next Sec-
retary of the Treasury. Janet Yellen, of 
course, is no stranger to this Chamber. 
She has been confirmed by the Senate 
no fewer than four times and was re-
ported favorably to the floor by a 
unanimous vote of the Finance Com-
mittee on Friday. 
The 
bipartisan 
support 
of 
Ms. 
Yellen’s multiple nominations reflects 
her breathtaking range of experience 
and just how well suited she is to man-
age the economic challenges of our 
time. Ms. Yellen, I am proud to report, 
is a native of working-class Brooklyn, 
the daughter of a schoolteacher and 
physician, raised during the Great De-
pression. She went to Fort Hamilton 
High School, one of James Madison 
High School’s rivals. A graduate of 
Brown and Yale, Ms. Yellen has taught 
economics at some of the world’s most 
prestigious 
universities. 
Of 
course, 
Janet Yellen is best known for her ten-
ure as Chair of the Federal Reserve, 
overseeing a period of falling unem-
ployment and steady economic recov-
ery from the global financial crisis. 
Few people possess the experience 
and expertise that Ms. Yellen would 
bring to the Treasury, particularly 
during this moment of economic crisis. 
At the Treasury Department, there are 
long hallways on the third floor where 
the portraits of all 77 Treasury Secre-
taries hang—all of them men, all the 
way back to Alexander Hamilton, the 
first Secretary. I am thrilled today to 
vote to confirm the first woman to ever 
hold the position of Treasury Secretary 
and someday add her portrait to that 
hallway. 
On that note, I would add it was a 
great pleasure to read the Biden ad-
ministration’s 
announcement 
today 
that the Treasury Department plans to 
speed up the plans to add the portrait 
of Harriet Tubman to the $20 bill. This 
is an issue I have long championed and 
something that should have been done 
a long time ago. I feel particularly 
strong about it since Harriet Tubman 
was an Auburn, NY, resident, and our 
office worked for years to successfully 
make her home in Upstate New York a 
national historic monument. 
I am glad the Biden administration is 
reversing the Trump administration’s 
foot-dragging. It is the kind of thing 
they did—no excuse, no reason, just 
didn’t do it. But now the Biden admin-
istration is reversing the Trump ad-
ministration’s foot-dragging and will 
press forward with plans to circulate 
new currency celebrating Harriet Tub-
man’s life and legacy. 
After Ms. Yellen’s confirmation to-
night, the Senate will continue to proc-
ess nominations to President Biden’s 
Cabinet for the Secretaries of State, 
Homeland 
Security, 
and 
Transpor-
tation. With cooperation, the Senate 
could complete both confirmations this 
week. Again, those are the Secretaries 
of 
State, 
Homeland 
Security, 
and 
Transportation, in addition to Treas-
ury this evening. 
I remind my colleagues that Presi-
dent Trump had his Secretary of Home-
land Security installed on Inaugura-
tion Day. We cannot allow our national 
security and our domestic security to 
be compromised in any way by the pro-
longed delay of Mr. Mayorkas’ nomina-
tion. 
f 
IMPEACHMENT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, as 
I announced on Friday, the Republican 
leader and I have come to an initial 
agreement about the timing of the im-
peachment trial of Donald Trump. This 
evening, managers appointed by the 
House of Representatives will deliver

January 25, 2021 
to the Senate the Article of Impeach-
ment and will read the article here in 
the well of this Chamber. 
Tomorrow, Senators will be sworn in 
as judges and jurors in the impending 
trial, and the Senate will issue a sum-
mons to former President Trump. After 
that, both the House managers and the 
former President’s counsel will have a 
period of time to draft their legal 
briefs, just as they did in previous 
trials. Once the briefs are drafted, pres-
entations by the parties will commence 
the week of February 8. 
I want to thank the Republican lead-
er for working with us to reach this 
agreement, which we believe is fair to 
both sides and will enable the Senate 
to conduct a timely and fair trial on 
the 
Article 
of 
Impeachment. 
The 
schedule will also allow us to continue 
the important work of the people, in-
cluding confirming more members of 
President Biden’s Cabinet. 
I want to be very clear about that 
last point. The Senate will conduct a 
timely and fair trial. 
I want to be very clear about that be-
cause some of my Republican col-
leagues have latched on to a fringe 
legal theory that the Senate does not 
have the constitutional power to hold 
the trial because Donald Trump is no 
longer in office. This argument has 
been roundly debunked by constitu-
tional scholars from the left, right, and 
center. It defies precedent, historic 
practice, and basic common sense. It 
makes no sense whatsoever that a 
President—or any official—could com-
mit a heinous crime against our coun-
try and then defeat Congress’s im-
peachment powers by simply resigning 
so as to avoid accountability and a 
vote to disqualify them from future of-
fice. 
This is not merely a hypothetical sit-
uation. In 1876, President Grant’s Sec-
retary of War, William Belknap, impli-
cated in a corruption scheme, literally 
raced to the White House to tender his 
resignation mere minutes before the 
House was set to vote on his impeach-
ment. Then, as a matter of historical 
record, he burst into tears. Not only 
did the House move forward with the 
five impeachment articles against him, 
but a trial was then convened in the 
Senate. 
Of course, the question came up as to 
whether the Senate could try former 
officials, and guess what. The Senate 
voted as a Chamber that Mr. Belknap 
could be tried ‘‘for acts done as Sec-
retary of War, notwithstanding his res-
ignation of said office.’’ 
Those are the words of the Senate 
vote in 1876. 
Mr. Belknap was ultimately acquit-
ted, but the record is clear. The Senate 
has the power to try former officials, 
and the reasons are obvious. A Presi-
dent or any official, for example, could 
wait until their final 2 weeks in office 
to betray their country, knowing they 
could escape accountability or merely 
resign moments before the Senate de-
cides to convict and disqualify them 
from future office. The theory that the 
Senate cannot try former officials 
would amount to a constitutional get- 
out-of-jail-free card for any President 
who commits an impeachable offense. 
Now, it is certainly appropriate for 
the Senate to take the resignation of 
an official into account. After all, the 
House decided not to impeach Richard 
Nixon because, in that sense, Nixon 
took some responsibility for his ac-
tions. But to state the obvious, Presi-
dent Trump did not resign. He has not 
demonstrated remorse. He has not even 
acknowledged his role in the events of 
January 6, and he has never disavowed 
the lies that were fed to the American 
people by him about who actually won 
the election. 
Just to put a final nail into the coffin 
of this ridiculous theory, I remind my 
colleagues, if a President is convicted 
on an Article of Impeachment, the Sen-
ate holds a separate vote on whether to 
bar them from future office. Once a 
President is convicted of an impeach-
ment charge, they are removed from 
office. In other words, they become a 
former official. If we are to believe 
that the Senate can’t hold former offi-
cials to account, then the Senate could 
never proceed to that second vote of 
disqualification, which is provided for 
in the Constitution, even for a sitting 
President. 
In saying this, I am expressing the 
view of legal scholars across the polit-
ical spectrum. Stephen Vladeck, a 
prominent constitutional expert at the 
University of Texas, wrote in the New 
York Times that Donald Trump is the 
‘‘poster child’’ for why the conviction 
of an ex-President is not just constitu-
tionally 
permissible 
but 
necessary. 
More than 150 legal scholars signed a 
letter last week forcefully stating that 
an impeachment trial of a former 
President is constitutional. Among the 
signatories, one of the cofounders of 
the Federalist Society, as well as one 
of President Reagan’s Solicitors Gen-
eral, among other prominent conserv-
atives. 
It is so obviously wrong to suggest 
that impeaching the President is un-
constitutional—that 
impeaching 
a 
former President is unconstitutional. 
So why are some suggesting it? 
Well, there seems to be a desire on 
the political right to avoid passing 
judgment, one way or the other, on 
former President Trump and his role in 
fomenting the despicable attack on the 
Capitol on January 6. There seems to 
be some hope that Republicans could 
oppose the former President’s impeach-
ment on process grounds, rather than 
grappling with his actual awful con-
duct. 
Let me be very clear. This is not 
going to fly. The trial is going to hap-
pen. It is certainly and clearly con-
stitutional, and if the former President 
is convicted, there will be a vote to dis-
qualify him from future office. 
There is only one question at stake— 
only one question that Senators of 
both parties will have to answer before 
God and their own conscience: Is 
former President Trump guilty of in-
citing an insurrection against the 
United States? 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
our Nation has spent nearly a year 
locked in this terrible battle with 
COVID–19. This virus that spread from 
China around the world has taken more 
than 400,000 American lives. It has ef-
fectively cost many children an entire 
school year. It made us slam the 
brakes on one of the best job markets 
in modern history and threw millions 
of families into financial chaos. 
But thanks to a lot of hard work in 
2020, the dawn of 2021 has brought a 
turning point. The genius of science 
and the support of Operation Warp 
Speed produced vaccines in record 
time. And in December, after months 
of delay, Democrats finally let Con-
gress move ahead with another major 
rescue package. The light at the end of 
the tunnel is getting closer, and both 
Republicans and Democrats are going 
to continue working together to accel-
erate victory. 
Curiously, the President’s candidate 
to run the Department of Health and 
Human Services is the famously par-
tisan attorney general of California. 
His recent experience in health policies 
seems largely limited to promoting 
abortion-on-demand and suing groups 
like the Little Sisters of the Poor, 
which dare to live out their religious 
convictions. 
In an interview just yesterday, Mr. 
Becerra compared the current state of 
vaccinations inherited by the Biden ad-
ministration to an airplane in a nose-
dive—a disaster. He contrasted the sta-
tus quo with the new administration’s 
stated goal of 1 million vaccinations 
per day, which he called ‘‘ambitious.’’ 
There is a problem here. Even the 
press has repeatedly pointed it out, 
which said our Nation is already meet-
ing that very pace—already meeting 
that very pace. That is not a big new 
goal. It is exactly what they inherited 
from the Trump administration in Op-
eration Warp Speed. 
Inauguration Day, Thursday, and 
Friday, each topped 1 million vaccina-
tions. As of today, we are averaging 
1.16 million shots per day over the last

January 25, 2021 
week. They are claiming the exact 
same number can either be a total ca-
tastrophe or a smashing success. I 
guess it depends on whether Democrats 
are in power. So much for science with-
out politics. 
Here is how the Washington Post put 
it: 
The accelerating speed of the [vaccine] 
program undercuts assertions by some Biden 
advisers that they were left no plan by the 
Trump administration, and suggests they 
need only to keep their feet on the pedal to 
clear the bar they set for themselves. 
Yesterday, Mr. Becerra was asked 
about increasing vaccinations in the 
months ahead. Here is what he said: ‘‘I 
first have to be sworn in to give you a 
timeline.’’ Perhaps that is like the 
time the Speaker of the House fa-
mously said she had to pass a bill be-
fore the public could learn what was in 
it. 
The new administration campaigned 
heavily on having a new master plan to 
fight the pandemic. Well, now they are 
in office, President Biden has said: 
‘‘[T]here’s nothing we can do to change 
the trajectory of the pandemic in the 
next several months,’’ and his adminis-
tration is apparently content to main-
tain the same vaccine pace they actu-
ally inherited. 
Let’s talk about Congress’s role in 
the pandemic relief. Our Democratic 
colleagues spent last summer and fall 
using the legislative filibuster to delay 
the next rescue package until after the 
election. Now, that would be the same 
tool that some Senate Democrats now 
suddenly say they oppose, as if they 
hadn’t leaned on it liberally over the 
last 6 years. 
But, finally, last month, they let us 
act. We passed another package total-
ing nearly $900 billion in urgent relief. 
We provided more than $80 billion to 
help K–12 schools, $280 billion for the 
Paycheck Protection Program, billions 
more for Federal unemployment insur-
ance supplements, nutrition and rental 
assistance, and direct cash aid and 
massive new investments in purchasing 
and distributing vaccines. Some of that 
money has already gone out the door. 
Other portions are still unspent—a 
massive, historic, almost trillion-dol-
lar package that was passed into law 
just 5 weeks ago. 
Since last March, Washington, DC, 
has spent a historic amount of money 
standing up one of the most enormous 
policy responses by any government to 
any emergency that the world has ever 
seen. Nobody thinks the support has 
been perfect—far from it—but it has 
been historic and strong. 
For example, a nonpartisan study in 
November showed that because of the 
historic emergency legislation passed 
through Congress, American personal 
income was actually—listen to this— 
higher in September than it had been 
before the pandemic. 
Last month, Larry Summers, Presi-
dent Clinton’s Treasury Secretary and 
President Obama’s NEC Director, con-
firmed that relative to our underlying 
economy, our multiple rescue packages 
have brought American household in-
come all the way back to a level that 
equals or even exceeds what he would 
expect if we weren’t in a crisis. 
So, to be clear, nobody thinks our bi-
partisan work fighting this pandemic is 
completely finished. Nobody is arguing 
that. And we all understand that over-
all national statistics do not explain 
away the terrible struggles facing 
many families. But experts and econo-
mists from the left to the right agree: 
Any further action should be smart and 
targeted, not just an imprecise deluge 
of borrowed money that would direct 
huge sums toward those who don’t need 
it. 
That is why the new administration’s 
first draft of their sprawling proposal 
misses the mark, and press reports 
make clear this is not just a Repub-
lican view. Multiple Democratic Sen-
ators agree that it is not the right path 
forward. 
So as the $900 billion package from 5 
weeks ago continues to come online 
and as the remaining needs continue to 
come into focus, Republicans will be 
ready and eager to continue bipartisan 
discussions about smart steps forward 
for the American people. Bipartisan ac-
tion helped our Nation endure the last 
year. Bipartisan action helped us turn 
the corner, and it will be smart, bipar-
tisan actions that help us finish the 
fight.

NOMINATION OF JANET LOUISE 
YELLEN 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
now on a related matter, this after-
noon, the Senate will confirm Dr. 
Janet Yellen, the former Chair of the 
Federal Reserve, to serve as President 
Biden’s Secretary of the Treasury. Her 
speedy 
confirmation 
will 
contrast 
sharply with the way the Senate Demo-
cratic minority handled many of the 
last President’s key Cabinet nomina-
tions 4 years ago. 
Secretary 
Mnuchin 
had 
to 
sit 
through a stunt where Senate Demo-
crats literally boycotted his committee 
hearing. He was not confirmed until 
mid-February. 
Dr. Yellen came out of committee on 
a unanimous vote and will begin to 
work 5 days after the inauguration. 
That is even faster than Secretary 
Geithner’s nomination in 2009 in the 
teeth of a financial crisis. 
This 
certainly 
isn’t 
because 
Dr. 
Yellen’s or President Biden’s economic 
policy views have unanimous support 
here in the Senate. I expect we will 
have no shortage of spirited policy dis-
cussions with Dr. Yellen in the months 
ahead, especially if some Democrats 
keep trying to use this historic emer-
gency as a pretext—a pretext to push 
through 
permanent 
far-left 
policy 
changes. 
The 50 Senators on our side have 
great confidence in our pro-job, pro- 
worker vision that helped build the 
greatest job market in living memory. 
But the simple fact is that, when the 
American people elect a President and 
when the President selects qualified 
and mainstream people for key posts, 
the whole Nation deserves for them to 
be able to assemble their team. 
I will be voting to confirm Dr. Yellen 
today. I look forward to working to-
gether on pro-growth policies that will 
help rebuild the thriving economy for 
American workers that was in place 
just 1 year ago.

TRIBUTE TO CAPITOL CUSTODIAL STAFF 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, it is 
good to see the Senator from Hawaii as 
the Presiding Officer. 
Madam President, I rise today to 
honor workers in this building—some-
thing that Senator HIRONO does every 
day of her life in this job—workers in 
this building who are too often over-
looked but whose work is essential to 
the functioning of our government: our 
Capitol custodial staff. 
In the days after the January 6 insur-
rection, 
when 
domestic 
terrorists 
stormed this building, we rightly hon-
ored Capitol Police Officer Eugene 
Goodman and many other Capitol po-
lice officers who put their lives on the 
line to protect all of us, to protect our 
democratic process, and, essentially, to 
protect our democracy. 
Last week, I joined a bipartisan 
group of colleagues in introducing leg-
islation to award Officer Goodman the

Congressional Gold Medal. He and oth-
ers may well have saved our lives and 
protected our democracy. They did it 
without the support they needed from 
their leadership. They did it without 
the support from the Trump White 
House on down. 
But those officers aren’t the only 
ones who deserve our honor and our 
gratitude. They are not the only ones 
who put their lives on the line serving 
our country on January 6 or over the 
past year during this pandemic. 
Every day, Capitol custodial staff do 
their jobs with skill, dedication, and 
dignity. They showed up for work dur-
ing this pandemic even when many in 
this building didn’t take it seriously 
and put those workers’ health at risk 
by not wearing masks. 
Capitol custodial workers were here 
on January 6, doing their jobs, when 
White supremacists stormed this build-
ing, barging into this Chamber, acting 
as though no one could ever possibly 
hold them accountable. Because the 
President was on their side, they 
thought they were invulnerable. 
And when their rampage was over, it 
was largely the Black and Brown 
custodians who were left to restore dig-
nity and respect to the Capitol. Their 
work allowed us to continue ours that 
night: certifying the electoral votes, 
securing the election and our democ-
racy. 
Many Americans were so moved to 
see those workers still doing their jobs. 
That is what service looks like. That is 
what love of country looks like. That 
is what the dignity of work is all 
about. 
Unfortunately, it tells you a whole 
lot about the problems that have been 
allowed to fester for too long in this 
country: White supremacists make a 
mess; Black workers clean it up. 
We have a lot of work to do to fix 
that and to ensure that hard work pays 
off for all workers in this country. We 
simply don’t value and respect all work 
the way we should. 
I think of the words of Dr. King, who, 
as you know, died fighting for workers, 
sanitation workers in Memphis. He 
said: 
If a man is called to be a street sweeper, he 
should sweep streets even as Michelangelo 
painted or Beethoven composed music or 
Shakespeare wrote poetry. He should sweep 
streets so well that all the hosts of heaven 
and earth will pause to say, ‘‘Here lived a 
great street sweeper who did his job well.’’ 
Dr. King said: 
No work is insignificant. All labor that up-
lifts humanity has dignity and importance. 
No work is insignificant. All labor 
has dignity. We ought to treat it that 
way, starting with honoring these 
workers. 
In the days after January 6, pictures 
of Capitol workers cleaning up after 
these terrorists were reported on the 
news, captured by dedicated journalists 
who also risked their lives to do their 
jobs that day. These photos struck a 
chord with so many people. Americans 
began writing thank-you letters, send-
ing them to the Architect of the Cap-
itol to pass on to custodial staff, to po-
lice officers, and to others. 
Many of these workers are rep-
resented by AFSCME Local 626, which 
gives workers a voice on the job and is 
also working on ways to honor its 
members. 
Members of Congress should do the 
same. In the coming weeks, I will be in-
troducing a Senate resolution to recog-
nize the Capitol custodial staff for 
their bravery and their service to our 
country on January 6. I hope my col-
leagues will join me—all of them—not 
as Republicans or Democrats but as 
Members of this body, as Americans 
all. 
This Capitol is the people’s House. 
The insurrectionists ransacked it. The 
Capitol 
custodians 
picked 
up 
the 
pieces. They deserve our eternal grati-
tude. To all the Capitol custodians who 
come to work in this building each day 
to ensure our democracy functions, 
thank you, thank you, thank you. 
NOMINATION OF JANET LOUISE YELLEN 
Madam President, a few days after 
our first woman Vice President was 
sworn in, we are about to confirm the 
first woman to step into one of the 
leading roles in our economy. Janet 
Yellen made history when she served as 
Chair of the Federal Reserve. She is 
about to make history again as Sec-
retary of the Treasury. 
She will be the first person ever to 
have held all three of the top positions 
in our economy—Chair of the Council 
of Economic Advisers, Chair of the 
Federal Reserve, and Secretary of the 
Treasury—and now more than ever, we 
need her leadership, her vision, and her 
appreciation for what makes this coun-
try work. 
As Fed Chair and as a labor econo-
mist, Janet Yellen made it clear that 
she understands what drives our econ-
omy. It is not the stock market. It is 
not Wall Street. It is people. It is work-
ers. Janet Yellen knows our economy 
is built by Americans who know the 
dignity of a hard day’s work, whether 
you punch a clock or swipe a badge or 
work for tips or care for children or 
take care of your parents. 
I remember in 2015 Chair Yellen came 
to Cleveland and toured the Alcoa 
plant not far from my house. She 
showed the kind of leadership we need, 
the kind of leaders President Biden is 
putting into the top jobs managing our 
economy—people who will get out of 
Washington, who will visit every sort 
of community in the heart of the coun-
try, and people who act on what they 
learn from workers in Chillicothe, in 
Springfield, in Youngstown and Moline, 
IL, where the next Presiding Officer 
comes from. 
There is a lot more to our economy 
than a quarterly earnings report. Janet 
Yellen understands that. She will step 
into this job at a time when the con-
trast between the financial health of 
corporations and workers couldn’t be 
starker. 
We are in the midst of a public health 
crisis and an economic crisis. You 
wouldn’t know it if you looked only at 
the stock market or corporate profits. 
But 
under 
President 
Biden, 
under 
Janet Yellen, and under new leadership 
in the Senate, we are done measuring— 
we are just done measuring the econ-
omy that way. We are going to think 
about the economy the way workers 
and their families do—in terms of pay-
checks, whether they can make rent or 
pay the mortgage this month or afford 
childcare or pay for their prescription 
drugs. By those measures, people are 
hurting. 
We hear a lot about what some peo-
ple call the K-shaped recovery—that is 
one way of saying that the rich are get-
ting richer while the middle class and 
low-income families continue to strug-
gle. It was a problem before this virus, 
as you know. The pandemic has only 
made it worse, and it is layered on top 
of systemic racism and inequalities 
that have been allowed to fester for too 
long. 
We have a tax code that favors the 
wealthy, that gives corporations a tax 
break when they move manufacturing 
jobs out of East St. Louis or out of 
East Cleveland overseas. Americans’ 
hard-earned savings are at risk from 
the financial instability of climate 
change. China is aggressive, confident, 
and continues to threaten American 
jobs. The Internal Revenue Service 
wastes time and taxpayer money audit-
ing working families, often Black and 
Brown families, instead of going after 
wealthy tax cheats. Wall Street re-
wards corporations that lay off em-
ployees and cut their pay and treat 
their workers as expendable. Risky be-
havior on Wall Street—like it did in 
the last crisis—can devastate commu-
nities in Ohio and around the country. 
I have confidence that Janet Yellen 
understands these vast challenges and 
that she will get to work immediately 
to take them on and to create a better, 
more prosperous, more stable economy, 
centered on the dignity of work. She 
knows we can build new, cleaner infra-
structure that puts people to work at 
good-paying union jobs. We can invest 
in the country, including the small 
towns and industrial cities of South-
east Ohio and Southern Illinois and the 
Black and Brown communities in our 
cities that too often get left behind. We 
can make it easier for people to afford 
housing 
and 
transportation 
and 
childcare. We can create a tax code 
that rewards work instead of wealth, 
starting with a dramatic expansion of 
the child tax credit and the earned in-
come tax credit. We can give people 
more power over their lives and their 
own money with options like monthly 
distribution of the child tax credit and 
no-fee bank accounts. That is the vi-
sion Janet Yellen and Joe Biden and 
Senate Democrats are committed to— 
one where the middle class is growing 
and everyone has the opportunity to 
join it. 
Janet Yellen has the experience, the 
talent, and the commitment to service 
to deliver results. She is the right per-
son for these tumultuous times. She

will rise to meet this moment to help 
our country build back better. I ask 
my colleagues to support Janet Yellen 
for Secretary of the Treasury. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
DUCKWORTH). The clerk will call the 
roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
59TH INAUGURATION 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, last 
week, the country and the world 
watched as our Nation carried out one 
of 
its 
most 
sacred 
traditions—the 
peaceful transfer of power, which is the 
hallmark of American democracy, that 
has defined our country since its ear-
liest days. Between the pandemic and 
heightened security concerns, this in-
auguration looked far different than 
those of former Presidents, but the will 
of the people was carried out just as it 
has been following every Presidential 
election throughout our Nation’s his-
tory. 
President Biden, in his inaugural ad-
dress, stressed the importance of uni-
fying our country. I agree, and I hope 
that the President and our Democratic 
colleagues in Congress lead by exam-
ple. 
FILIBUSTER 
Madam President, our first order of 
business has been to fill critical posi-
tions throughout the Federal Govern-
ment, and the Senate has already con-
firmed the Director of National Intel-
ligence and the Secretary of Defense, 
both of whom I supported. This after-
noon, we will vote on the confirmation 
of Janet Yellen to be Secretary of the 
Treasury, whom I intend to vote for, as 
well, and there is a slate of other im-
portant positions that need to be filled 
in the coming days and weeks. 
I should note that voting to confirm 
a nominee, under the words of the Con-
stitution—providing advice and con-
sent—is not a rubberstamp of the ad-
ministration’s policies. I know there 
will be important issues that we will 
disagree on, but if elections mean any-
thing, they mean that the prevailing 
party should not be knee-capped as, un-
fortunately, our Democratic colleagues 
did to the previous administration 
when it tried to install a new Cabinet 
and agency heads. Rather, I believe the 
tradition has been to accommodate one 
another when we can so the adminis-
tration can carry out its duties. 
This morning, I had a very good con-
versation with Judge Merrick Garland, 
whom President Biden has nominated 
for Attorney General. Judge Garland’s 
extensive legal experience makes him 
well suited to lead the Department of 
Justice, and I appreciate his commit-
ment to keeping politics out of the 
Justice Department. That is my No. 1 
criterion for who should be the next 
head of the Department of Justice, the 
Attorney General. I think both sides 
should support a depoliticized Justice 
Department, and that is what I hope 
Judge Garland, once confirmed, will 
deliver. I look forward to talking to 
him more during the confirmation 
process, but unless I hear something 
new, I expect to support his nomina-
tion before the full Senate. It is in the 
best interest of the country to have 
qualified, Senate-confirmed individuals 
leading our Federal departments and 
agencies. 
As we look beyond the confirmation 
process, there are many opportunities 
for Republicans and Democrats to work 
together in those places where we 
agree, 
and 
I 
know 
additional 
coronavirus relief, as it is needed, is 
high on President Biden’s list. Approxi-
mately 1 million Americans are being 
vaccinated every day, and while the 
light at the end of the tunnel is getting 
bigger and brighter, we are still not in 
the clear. Congress has provided tril-
lions of dollars in relief to strengthen 
our fight on both the healthcare and 
economic fronts, but we need to remain 
vigilant in the final, critical phase of 
this battle. 
I don’t support President Biden’s 
pandemic relief proposal in its current 
form, but I do believe it is a starting 
point for bipartisan negotiations. I will 
gladly support a reasonable, targeted 
bill as we determine precisely, as we 
can, where the needs truly are. We all 
agree we need to bolster vaccine manu-
facturing and distribution; that some 
Americans need additional financial 
support; and that Main Street busi-
nesses and their workforces are still 
struggling to survive this economic re-
cession. I hope the administration will 
be willing to work with Congress to 
reach 
an 
agreement 
that 
receives 
broad, bipartisan support as each of the 
previous bills that we have passed has. 
During my time in the Senate, I have 
worked with folks across the aisle on 
our shared priorities, and I have no 
plans of changing that practice now, 
but make no mistake: I will push back, 
forcefully, 
respectfully, 
when 
the 
President and I disagree. One of the 
things I have learned, though, is that 
there is a difference between what 
some elected officials say and what 
they actually do, and rather than lis-
ten to what they say, I really prefer to 
watch what they do and see if those are 
consistent. Only hours after being 
sworn in and speaking of unifying the 
country, President Biden unilaterally 
canceled the permit for the Keystone 
XL Pipeline, and on the same day, the 
administration halted all new energy 
leasing and permitting on public lands 
and waters. With these unfortunate ac-
tions, President Biden is killing thou-
sands of well-paying U.S. jobs and 
kicking the U.S. energy industry while 
it is still struggling from the pan-
demic. 
I had hoped and still hope to work 
with President Biden on an all-of-the- 
above energy strategy that prioritizes 
our fossil fuels—we have 280 million 
cars on the road, and people are still 
going to need gasoline for the foresee-
able future—renewables, and innova-
tive technologies that help us harness 
our most prevalent and reliable energy 
sources. One of the things that, I think, 
is exciting about some of the research 
that is being done is on carbon capture 
technology, which ought to be, again, 
something that we can all agree on as 
we transition to the next forms of en-
ergy. 
As we begin a new Congress and wel-
come a new President, I am, once 
again, reminded of the words that were 
quoted from Ruth Bader Ginsburg, re-
cently deceased Justice of the U.S. Su-
preme Court. She didn’t originate it, 
but she did make it popular when she 
said, ‘‘You can disagree without being 
disagreeable.’’ Of course, democracy 
itself expects a competition of ideas 
but not necessarily the mudslinging 
and name-calling that have become all 
too common. I hope we can return to 
the respectful battles in the days and 
months ahead and know there is no 
better battleground for that to happen 
in than in the Senate, where some-
times—sometimes—we live up to the 
billing as the world’s greatest delibera-
tive body. 
The primary feature that separates 
the Senate from the House or any 
other legislative body is that of free 
and full debate. That is why it takes 60 
votes to cut off debate—so that you 
can then vote and pass a piece of legis-
lation with 51 votes. It forces us to do 
what we ought to do anyway, which is 
to have fulsome debate, allow minority 
views to be presented, and then, once 
the debate is concluded, have a vote on 
the underlying bill. Fundamentally, 
the Founders saw the Senate as a place 
that protected minority rights. I have 
been here long enough to be in the ma-
jority and in the minority, and we 
know what goes around comes around 
in the U.S. Senate. It is as sure as day 
follows night. That is why we are 
called a deliberative body. In the 
House, you have 435 Members, and in 
order to pass a bill, all you need is a 
majority. 
Got 
the 
votes? 
Jam 
it 
through. Yet there has to be some-
place, somewhere, in a nation of 330 
million souls, where competing ideas 
can be seriously debated, and that is 
why our Founders created the U.S. 
Senate. 
George Washington was famously 
said to have told Thomas Jefferson 
that the Senate was meant to be a sau-
cer to cool House legislation like a sau-
cer was used to cool hot tea. Well, if 
partisan bills are the hot tea, then the 
Senate cloture requirements are the 
saucer. Rather than a simple majority 
here in the Senate, you have to get 60 
out of 100 Senators to support a bill in 
order for it to advance. I know we all 
would love to see each of our ideas 
passed into law without any delay or 
extended debate, but that is not the 
way the Senate is supposed to work. It 
forces us to do what we ought to want 
to do anyway, which is to do the hard

work of bipartisan negotiation and 
compromise, come up with an 80–20 so-
lution that can leave the 20 percent 
you don’t agree on for another day and 
another battle, but to pass into law and 
make progress, on behalf of the Amer-
ican people, the 80 percent we can 
agree on. 
Neither party has had a filibuster- 
proof majority since the late 1970s, and 
as a result, Senators from red States 
and blue States have had to work to-
gether, as they should, to reach agree-
ments on nearly every piece of legisla-
tion that has moved through this 
Chamber in the last four decades. The 
only real exception is the budget rec-
onciliation process, which, by court 
rules, can be done with 51 votes, but, 
otherwise, in the main, 60 votes—a bi-
partisan majority—is required in order 
to move legislation. 
When bills require bipartisan support 
in order to pass, they are more durable. 
The fact is, if you pass a partisan piece 
of legislation, the next time the major-
ity flips, it can undo it. I think it is 
useful in terms of our comity, in terms 
of our relationships, and in terms of 
our ability to get things done for the 
American people to try to figure out 
how to do things on a bipartisan basis. 
While I know bipartisanship isn’t nec-
essarily popular with the political 
bases of either party, it is critical to 
our democracy. 
Unfortunately, 
some 
of 
our 
col-
leagues on the other side have ex-
pressed an interest in using their newly 
gained powers in the majority to blow 
up the filibuster and to shatter that 
important cooling saucer. Make no 
mistake: That would do irreparable 
harm to this institution and inflict se-
rious damage on our democracy. With-
out the 60-vote cloture requirement, 
both Chambers would be majority-rule 
institutions, with a steady flow of par-
tisan legislation moving through Con-
gress. If the same party controls both 
Chambers and the White House, that 
party could pass strictly partisan legis-
lation that would quickly be signed 
into law without a single vote from the 
opposing party. Does that feel good? 
Well, if you are on the winning side, 
yes. Is it good for the country? No, it is 
not. It is efficient, but it is not effec-
tive. It is not lasting. It is not durable. 
It doesn’t provide the sort of stability 
and ability to plan that the current 
structure provides. 
All the reasons I have given for doing 
away with the Senate cloture require-
ment are why no majority has ever 
tried to blow it up before. 
During the past administrations—the 
Trump, Obama, Bush and Clinton ad-
ministration—there was a period of 
time when the President’s party con-
trolled both Chambers of Congress. If 
you go further back in history, you 
will find dozens of examples. But no 
Senate, until now, has ever been so 
shortsighted as to get rid of the cloture 
requirement and the filibuster when it 
comes to legislation. 
If Democrats carried out their threat 
to do that today, they would clear the 
path to pass a radical agenda that 
would fundamentally reshape our coun-
try without a single Republican vote. 
As a reminder, we have a 50–50 Sen-
ate, and in the House there are 221 
Democrats and 211 Republicans. In all 
of Congress, there are 10 more Demo-
crats than Republicans out of 535 Mem-
bers of Congress. That is far from a 
progressive or a radical mandate. 
As I said, elections happen, majori-
ties change, and Presidents come and 
go, as do U.S. Senators. In 2 years, Re-
publicans could win the majority in ei-
ther or both Chambers, and in 4, a Re-
publican could win the White House as 
well. 
If we were to do away with this re-
straint on snap decisions and partisan 
legislation, what would the succeeding 
Republican administration likely do? 
It would simply undo everything that 
had been done on a partisan basis. 
Well, would our Democratic col-
leagues support a rule change to blow 
up the filibuster when Republicans con-
trol both Houses and the White House? 
Would they believe the Senate minor-
ity should be silenced, as they believe 
now? 
As I say, what goes around comes 
around, and the shoe is always on the 
other foot, eventually. 
The good news is we don’t have to 
wonder what the answer would be be-
cause we already know it. In 2017, there 
was a Republican-led Senate, House, 
and White House, when we held both 
Houses and the White House. There was 
fear by some folks across the aisle—ac-
tually, both sides of the aisle—that the 
filibuster would be eliminated in order 
to clear a path for a Republican agen-
da. 
That was when 61 Senators, a fili-
buster-proof majority, wrote a bipar-
tisan letter to then-Majority Leader 
MCCONNELL
and Democratic Leader 
SCHUMER, urging them to protect the 
filibuster. 
That 
was 
61 
Senators. 
Among the cosigners were 27 current 
Democratic Senators. One of the signa-
tures on this bipartisan letter is that 
of our newly sworn-in Vice President, 
KAMALA HARRIS. 
I can promise you that Leader 
MCCONNELL has no interest in elimi-
nating the filibuster, when he was ma-
jority or now as minority leader, be-
cause he knew the institutional dam-
age that this would cause and the dam-
age to our democracy. 
Unfortunately, Leader SCHUMER re-
fuses to acknowledge that most basic 
fact. 
The two party leaders are now in the 
process of negotiating an organizing 
resolution on how this new reality of a 
50–50 Senate will operate. Fortunately, 
there is modern precedent for how this 
has been done, and the two leaders 
have shared an interest in emulating 
the 2001 agreement negotiated by Tom 
Daschle and Trent Lott. 
But because of the newfound obses-
sion of some on the left with uprooting 
the cornerstone of the Senate, Leader 
MCCONNELL has asked for assurances 
from Leader SCHUMER
that the fili-
buster and the cloture requirement will 
remain intact. After all, it is not un-
reasonable to ask your negotiating 
partner to commit to not breaking the 
rules, which is all Senator MCCONNELL 
is asking for. 
Senator SCHUMER has derided that re-
quest, calling it ‘‘extraneous’’ and say-
ing it falls outside the bounds of the 
2001 organizing resolution. 
But I would like to remind our col-
leagues that in 2001 the majority party 
was not threatening to blow up the 
Senate rules to advance a partisan 
agenda. That is why it wasn’t the sub-
ject, explicitly, of that negotiation of 
the organizing resolution. There was 
no need to ask for assurances on the 
protection of the filibuster because it 
wasn’t even a question to be answered. 
Our Democratic colleagues have re-
lied on the filibuster while Republicans 
have held the majority. I can think of 
time after time after time when we 
have tried to pass more COVID–19 relief 
bills that our Democratic colleagues 
felt were inadequate. And time after 
time after time, they used the fili-
buster to prevent passage of those bills, 
which was their right—I think a mis-
take, a decision I disagree with, but 
within their rights under the Senate 
rules. Republicans have also relied on 
the filibuster while Democrats have 
held the majority. 
We all recognize that at some point 
the shoe is always on the other foot, 
which is why no one has been so foolish 
as to eliminate the legislative fili-
buster or to even seriously consider it 
before. I hope our colleagues on the 
other side will avoid making this trag-
ic mistake in order to pursue short-
sighted political goals. 
And in an encouraging sign on Fri-
day, the White House indicated that 
President Biden does not support get-
ting rid of the legislative filibuster ei-
ther. President Biden served in the 
Senate for, I believe, 36 years. He un-
derstands how this institution works, 
how it is supposed to work, and his ad-
vice—and it is only advice, since he is 
the President and not a Member of the 
Senate anymore—is: Don’t go there. 
I encourage our more than two dozen 
Democratic colleagues who have re-
peatedly voiced their support for main-
taining the legislative filibuster to in-
sist that this critical stabilizing force 
in our democracy be preserved in the 
organizing resolution currently being 
discussed by Senator SCHUMER
and 
Senator MCCONNELL. I truly believe 
that if we don’t do that, if the legisla-
tive filibuster is eliminated, we will all 
rue the day. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, I tell you, I am going to follow

very high expectations of what this 
Congress is going to be able to accom-
plish, and they also have high expecta-
tions for this administration. What 
they are doing is looking there, and 
they are saying: Politics and politi-
cians are not what this is all about. 
They don’t necessarily matter. Policies 
matter. 
And, as my colleague is saying, main-
taining the filibuster rule in the Sen-
ate allows robust, respectful debate so 
that we arrive at a sense of com-
promise and we do what is best for the 
American people. 
Today, I was talking with one of our 
Tennesseans, and they were talking 
about that it doesn’t matter what is 
being said on social media—on Twitter 
or Facebook or Parler or any of the so-
cial media platforms—that when you 
strip it all away, good policy is good 
policy, and that is what matters. Good 
policy is good policy. It is good for the 
people, and that is where the emphasis 
should be. 
So when I say they have high expec-
tations, I don’t only mean that they 
want good policies; they want this to 
focus on them. They want it to focus 
on their concerns, their communities, 
their schools, their right to feel secure, 
their right to enjoy free speech, their 
right to pursue their happiness, their 
American dream, and their right to cel-
ebrate and protect life. It is about 
them, not politicians, not politics. It is 
about the American people. 
From their perspective, we can spend 
hours debating the budget or immigra-
tion reform or data privacy—which I 
will talk more about later this week— 
as long as at the end of the day, what-
ever compromise we reach not only 
meets their needs but recognizes that 
the people are the most important part 
of this entire equation—the people. 
Every Member of this body under-
stands that when the balance of power 
shifts, sometimes that means that the 
guy across the aisle is going to get the 
upper hand. Things change, but it 
would be a mistake for my colleagues 
on the other side of the aisle to assume 
that that means we are willing to set 
our priorities and our principles aside. 
It doesn’t mean that we are going to 
submit to their agenda. It doesn’t 
mean we are going to conform to their 
agenda. It means we are going to stay 
true to our principles, represent our 
States, and work—work diligently—for 
what is going to be best for the people. 
We may have had a changing of the 
guard here in Washington, but it 
doesn’t mean that any of us has set 
aside the promises that we have made 
to the people we represent, and that is 
why I came out so strongly against the 
Biden administration and the Presi-
dent’s Executive order that really 
crushed the jobs and the potential for 
energy security that came with the 
building of the Keystone XL pipeline. 
This was a project that had achieved 
bipartisan support, and what are we 
seeing now? Lost jobs, lost livelihoods, 
more money being taken out of the 
taxpayers’ pocket. 
For similar reasons, I came out in op-
position to rejoining the Paris climate 
accords and reversing our course on the 
departure from the World Health Orga-
nization. 
For me, this is isn’t about politics. It 
is about the policies this new adminis-
tration has decided to unilaterally say 
yes to—without consulting Congress, 
without including the people in the dis-
cussion. 
And just so we are all aware, Presi-
dent Biden said yes to more unilateral 
policy changes on day one than any 
President in our Nation’s history— 
more than any President in our Na-
tion’s history. 
The Biden administration looked at 
those new policies and decided that the 
result—achieving that outcome—was 
worth whatever it would cost the 
American people to get it. 
So over the next few weeks, we will 
also be examining the President’s Cabi-
net picks to get a sense of the tradeoff 
they will be willing to make. 
Safety is at the forefront of every-
one’s mind back home in Tennessee— 
not just safety from COVID but from 
the bad actors and the foreign adver-
saries who continue to show us just 
how far they are willing to go to under-
mine us on the world stage. Back in 
Tennessee, we have a saying: When 
somebody shows you who they really 
are, you better believe them. 
And I will tell you that they are pay-
ing attention, and I will tell you that 
they are not very impressed right now 
with some of the so-called soft talk 
that they are hearing on proposed poli-
cies toward Iran and the communist re-
gime in China. 
This is why I chose not to support 
the confirmation of our new Director of 
National Intelligence, Avril Haines. I 
also had some pretty tough questions 
to ask Secretary of State Nominee 
Blinken about some of these same 
issues dealing with Iran, dealing with 
China. Many of the proposals that I am 
hearing 
from 
them 
have 
sounded 
strangely familiar from years gone by. 
We don’t have to look overseas to 
find some very real policy differences 
between what Tennesseans have said 
they expect and what the Biden admin-
istration is signaling that they want to 
deliver. 
In his hearing before the Commerce 
Committee, Transportation Secretary 
Nominee Pete Buttigieg signaled to the 
panel that he would put the adminis-
tration’s environmental goals ahead of 
some very basic changes to Federal 
policy that would lighten the regu-
latory load on the county and city 
mayors trying to get their transpor-
tation projects off the ground. 
As I told him, many times the regu-
lations at issue don’t just slow the 
projects down, they kill the project and 
that town’s prospects for growth, for a 
better life, for people in the commu-
nity. Hopefully, he is going to keep in 
mind what it means to these mayors 
the next time he is asked to consider 
the benefits of removing unnecessary 
redtape. 
These tradeoffs many times are just 
too destructive to say yes to. I would 
encourage all of my colleagues to look 
at the compromises the President is 
asking each and every one to make, 
not just in terms of what we stand to 
gain but what is going to be the cost. 
What is the monetary cost? 
What is the cost of freedom? 
What is the opportunity cost that 
will be delivered to the American peo-
ple in order for the administration to 
have their way, to get their income? 
That is the question we should each 
ask: What is the cost to the American 
people in order to protect them, in 
order to meet the expectations that 
they have? We should be listening to 
the people. These policies are about 
them. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
NOMINATION OF JANET LOUISE YELLEN 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, it is 
a pleasure tonight to be making the 
case for Janet Yellen, former Chair of 
the Federal Reserve, to be the next 
Secretary of the Treasury. It is an aw-
fully easy case to make. 
Chair Janet Yellen deserves to be in 
the Senate confirmation hall of fame. 
She has already been confirmed four 
times for key economic positions. To-
night, the Senate can deliver an espe-
cially important economic judgment: 
Confirm Janet Yellen a fifth time and 
know that she will work with every 
single one of us to get our workers, our 
small businesses, and all Americans, 
from sea to shining sea, back on solid 
economic footing. 
Tonight, I am going to spend just a 
few minutes discussing several impor-
tant matters we learned from Chair 
Yellen’s confirmation hearing. First, 
Chair Yellen is an exceptional econo-
mist who has a rare gift. She can take 
complicated economic theories and put 
them into understandable language, all 
while showing a real heart for the mil-
lions of Americans who are hurting 
through no fault of their own. 
I asked Chair Yellen at her confirma-
tion hearing: What will give Americans 
the most bang for the economic recov-
ery buck? And Chair Yellen simply 
walked through the priorities, particu-
larly going to bat for our small busi-
nesses. I come from a State where we 
have only a handful of big businesses. 
We are an overwhelmingly small busi-
ness State. At her confirmation hear-
ing, she spoke clearly about those 
small business needs, and she talked 
about the concerns she has for innova-
tive and important approaches to ex-
panding 
unemployment 
benefits 
to 
make sure that we are meeting the 
needs of our people. She also focused on 
reducing hunger and approaches that 
will help stretch anti-hunger dollars. 
Second, Chair Yellen knows that it 
would be a big mistake for the Con-
gress to go small on economic relief. 
She is acutely aware of what happened 
in 2009, when the government took its 
foot off the economic gas pedal too

January 25, 2021 
soon, and recovery was compromised as 
a result. She also understands that 
emergency economic relief, like unem-
ployment compensation, needs to last 
as long as the emergency. It cannot be 
tied to arbitrary expiration dates, 
where potential political agendas come 
before human needs. There is a reason 
why the Finance Committee approved 
her nomination unanimously on Friday 
morning. I touched on some of those 
factors, and I am going to amplify a 
little bit. 
For example, nobody deserves more 
credit than Chair Yellen for the longest 
economic expansion in American his-
tory. It lasted until the pandemic hit. 
As Federal Reserve Chair, she led an 
important change to the status quo in 
economic policy. Previously, there had 
been too great a focus on inflation and 
deficit. Chair Yellen said: Let’s zero in 
more on unemployment, income, and 
inequality, and she believed that the 
economy could run a bit hotter. The 
record shows that the Yellen approach 
was right on. Unemployment went 
down, wages went up, and a lot of peo-
ple were better off than they were be-
fore. That is exactly the kind of think-
ing America needs again because con-
fronting the COVID economy is ham-
mering working families, in particular. 
Again, another clear reason why Janet 
Yellen is the right pick to be the next 
Treasury Secretary. 
The 
most 
recent 
economic 
data 
shows that 1.4 million people nation-
wide had filed new claims for unem-
ployment benefits in the last full week 
of the previous administration. So it is 
not hard to figure out what that 
means. It is an economic catastrophe. 
It is more than twice the highest figure 
from any single week in the great re-
cession. That means 1.4 million peo-
ple—so, so many working families—are 
suddenly walking on an economic 
tightrope every single day, balancing 
the food cost against the fuel cost, the 
fuel cost against the rent bill, worried 
about finding a new job, getting a 
badly needed shift at work, falling be-
hind on rent or the mortgage, feeding 
their kids, paying the electric bill, pay-
ing medical bills—worried that the 
economy is headed in reverse and wor-
ried about whether the Congress will be 
gridlocked. 
The country lost 140,000 jobs last 
month. My home State lost more than 
25,000, in part because the Senate, in 
something that just defied common 
sense, waited around for the recovery 
to peter out before passing any more 
relief. Thousands and thousands of 
neighborhood restaurants and bars and 
mom-and-pop 
businesses 
have 
been 
shuttered. Nearly 11 million workers 
are out of a job. Another 4 million 
Americans have fallen out of the labor 
force entirely since this time last year. 
Unless the Congress acts boldly and 
quickly with more relief, the damage 
from the COVID economic crash will 
long outlast the pandemic itself. That 
must not be allowed to happen. 
The key, of course, is for the Senate 
to get down to work, and one of the 
best ways you can do it is to confirm 
someone who is eminently qualified, 
Chair Janet Yellen, to be Treasury Sec-
retary. 
As I touched on, we are looking at 
working with her on a host of key eco-
nomic issues. As I have said as the new 
chair of the Finance Committee, my 
first priority will be to make sure that 
this Congress does not commit again 
the mistake of 2009. 
In 2009, the sense was, well, maybe we 
are getting there on economic recov-
ery. We will be able to come back later 
if maybe we didn’t do enough. Well, we 
all know that a missed opportunity is a 
missed opportunity, and, in 2009, the 
Congress said, All right. We can take 
our foot off the gas now. It was too 
early, and there wasn’t any next effort 
to make up for the damage. I am com-
mitted to making sure that doesn’t 
happen again. Suffice it to say, it took 
71⁄2 years for the unemployment rate in 
Oregon to return to its prerecession 
levels. 
This time around, the Congress has 
been warned. The warning I am giving 
about 
making 
sure 
that 
Congress 
doesn’t take its foot off the economic 
relief pedal too soon is not the first 
warning. Chair Powell, for example, 
made it clear that the biggest danger 
lies in not doing enough. 
Increasing relief checks to $2,000 is 
key. The Congress needs to increase 
and extend unemployment benefits for 
the entirety of the COVID crisis, and 
you do that by, in effect, tying the ben-
efits to the real world, to economic 
conditions on the ground. That has 
been my proposal for some time. Other 
colleagues have long advanced similar 
ideas. It is not a revolutionary propo-
sition to say that emergency relief 
should last as long as the emergency. 
Simply stated. And it should not be 
held hostage by the arbitrary political 
agendas of Members of Congress. 
If you don’t do it, dysfunction and 
gridlock in Congress creates still more 
havoc for people who have done noth-
ing wrong and just need help. A decade 
ago, that help went away too quickly 
because benefits expired arbitrarily, 
and Congress did not keep up with ex-
tensions. The Congress needs to do bet-
ter, and I believe that should include 
important upgrades as well to unem-
ployment insurance, which was created 
in the last century. I don’t think it is 
too much to say we at least bring this 
critical safety net program into the 
relevant century. 
Now, sometimes these programs look 
a little rusty in the modern economy. 
Sometimes it is because of outright 
sabotage. But workers suffer, particu-
larly Black and Hispanic workers. So 
there are steps that need to be taken, 
in addition to modernizing the bene-
fits, increasing base benefits, bringing 
all workers into the system, and ensur-
ing it can hold up in a crisis. 
Finally, Chair Yellen had some im-
portant comments on fixing America’s 
broken Tax Code. I will tell you, 
Madam President, I start with the 
proposition that a nurse who is treat-
ing COVID patients and paying taxes 
with every single paycheck should not 
find themselves in a disadvantaged po-
sition when compared to billionaires 
who, in effect, do no such thing and can 
postpone and postpone and postpone 
paying their taxes. 
Now, there is a lot of work we need to 
do to repair the 2017 bill. The previous 
administration actually increased the 
incentives for corporations to ship jobs 
overseas. I want to fix that mistake. I 
want to work with Secretary Yellen on 
energy policy because so much of it 
deals with the Tax Code. 
Suffice it to say, those are just some 
of the challenges Chair Yellen will face 
when, I believe, she is confirmed to-
night as Treasury Secretary. She is su-
premely qualified—a member, in my 
view, of the Senate Confirmation hall 
of fame—and a proven economic policy-
maker. 
Finally, I say to my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle, it is long past 
time to have a woman lead the U.S. 
Treasury Department. Chair Yellen has 
my full support. 
As colleagues come for this vote—and 
it is a significant economic policy vote, 
make no mistake about that—I would 
just ask my colleagues to reflect on the 
fact that Chair Yellen was approved by 
the Finance Committee 26 to nothing. 
Sometimes I say about this place—I 
have questions about whether you can 
get a simple decision like ordering a 
sandwich decided on a 26-to-nothing. 
She was approved unanimously because 
she gives public service a good name. 
I urge my colleagues to support 
Janet Yellen for Secretary of the 
Treasury when we vote in just a few 
minutes. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
TRIBUTE TO RYAN D. MCCARTHY 
Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I 
want to visit this evening on the Sen-
ate floor and take this opportunity to 
recognize a public servant, a leader, 
our former Secretary of the Army, the 
Honorable Ryan D. McCarthy. Sec-
retary 
McCarthy 
led 
our 
Nation’s 
Army from September 30, 2019, to Janu-
ary 20, 2021, and during that time, he 
made it a more modern, agile, and le-
thal fighting force. 
We have worked together on a num-
ber of projects for Kansans and those 
who serve or have served our Nation 
during his tenure as Secretary, Acting 
Secretary, and Under Secretary of the 
Army, and I have grown to consider 
him a good, solid friend. 
One of my most memorable experi-
ences in the Senate was visiting the 1st 
Infantry Division soldiers in Germany 
and Poland—soldiers who come from 
Fort Riley, KS—with the Secretary, 
followed by our trip to Afghanistan to 
meet with troops on the frontlines in 
the global War on Terror. Those visits 
marked the beginning of our friend-
ship, and since then, I have appreciated 
his guidance and his support during his

visits to Kansas and our many discus-
sions here in our Nation’s Capital. 
In 2019, Secretary McCarthy joined 
me in Kansas to visit Seitz Elementary 
School, which serves the families of 
the Big Red One soldiers on Fort Riley. 
Secretary McCarthy was instrumental 
in helping to find funding for this 
school in 2011 when he was the Special 
Assistant to Defense Secretary Robert 
Gates, a Kansan. I was pleased he 
joined me in Kansas to visit the 
school—and 
its 
students—that 
he 
helped create in 2019. We also met with 
Fort Riley leadership and then traveled 
to Wichita to visit defense manufac-
turing and academic leaders to discuss 
the future of Army procurement. 
These personal touch points with sol-
diers and with the Army community 
were some of the reasons why Sec-
retary McCarthy was universally re-
spected within the Army family. 
While I will always appreciate our 
personal engagements with soldiers, I 
will also remember our efforts to sup-
port soldiers and veterans when they 
step off the battlefield or separate from 
military service. 
This past Veterans Day, we coau-
thored an editorial that discussed our 
parallel efforts to support the mental 
health and well-being of soldiers and 
veterans. 
Reports 
show 
Americans 
across the country are feeling isolated 
and alone in today’s socially distanced 
environment, including our Nation’s 
service men and women and veteran 
populations. Between my efforts as 
chairman of the Senate Veterans’ Af-
fairs Committee to implement the 
Commander John Scott Hannon Vet-
erans Mental Health Care Improvement 
Act and Secretary McCarthy’s effort to 
build interpersonal connections be-
tween soldiers, we are working to give 
soldiers and veterans the tools they 
need to overcome mental health chal-
lenges they face. 
As Secretary McCarthy transitions 
out of the watchful eye of public life, I 
rise this evening to express my appre-
ciation for his leadership, his char-
acter, and his moral compass. He never 
let politics or convenience influence 
his decisions, and that has signifi-
cantly benefited soldiers, Army civil-
ians, veterans, and Kansans across the 
Nation. 
As the chairman and now ranking 
member of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs 
Committee, I will always strive to help 
veterans find success after service. 
Secretary 
McCarthy, 
I 
have 
no 
doubts that you will find success and 
happiness after your dedicated service 
to our country. I thank your family for 
their support of your public service. I 
know that you and your family will 
find a quality life with purpose and 
meaning as you enter the next phase. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana. 
Mr. CASSIDY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to complete my 
remarks before the scheduled rollcall 
vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
TRIBUTE TO CHRIS GILLOTT 
Mr. CASSIDY. Madam President, I 
rise today to recognize and thank three 
long-serving aides who have served my 
office but more importantly served our 
Nation proudly, and they are now mov-
ing on to the next chapters of their 
lives. 
First, Chris Gillott. Chris Gillott was 
my legislative director and for 8 years 
has been my right-hand person on pol-
icy. He never failed to take the ideas 
we discussed together and craft the ac-
tual policy needed to make a meaning-
ful difference in the lives of folks in 
Louisiana and the lives of all Ameri-
cans. 
He was a master at navigating the 
partisan divide to find areas of con-
sensus upon which we could build to 
advance real solutions. I was always 
struck that he was on a first-name 
basis with the legislative director of— 
and fill in the Democratic Senator’s or 
the Republican Senator’s name. You 
have a sense that in the era before 
Zoom calls, they would go out and have 
a beer on a regular basis, and that 
helped us tremendously. 
We saw this fully on display recently 
as Chris was a central figure in the so- 
called 908 Coalition, which jump-start-
ed stalled COVID relief packages. And 
it wasn’t just the relationships be-
tween the Senators but, again, as I 
said, between the different legislative 
directors from both parties in all of-
fices. 
His efforts were also central to pass-
ing legislation to ban surprise medical 
billing—a more than 2-year effort that 
will have a direct and positive impact 
on the pocketbooks of American fami-
lies. He was crucial in our effort to 
make healthcare more affordable and 
pass generational tax reform. For 
every major legislative pursuit, I could 
rely upon Chris. 
What many in Louisiana may not 
know is that he has also been a central 
figure engaged in some of the most 
pressing issues affecting our State, in-
cluding offshore energy production, 
revenue sharing, energy regulation and 
permitting, the National Flood Insur-
ance Program, and public works re-
lated to flood protection. These are all 
important to the well-being of our 
State and the folks who live there, as 
well as our entire country, and all 
these were regularly under assault. 
Chris was a fearless advocate for en-
ergy production and for the jobs that 
energy production creates to not only 
help meet America’s energy needs but 
to meet the individual families’ finan-
cial 
needs. 
He 
has 
been 
on 
the 
frontlines to prevent changes to rev-
enue sharing that would gut the money 
used in my State for hurricane protec-
tion, flood mitigation, and coastal en-
vironmental renewal. He has defended 
the National Flood Insurance Program 
to ensure that this critical lifeline re-
mains accessible to people across the 
country and, importantly, to those in 
Louisiana. 
Thank you, Chris, for all you have 
done for me and for those of Louisiana. 
TRIBUTE TO ALLISON KAPSNER SOLLEY 
Madam President, the next person I 
will speak of is Allison Kapsner Solley. 
Allison is a Minnesotan. She said she 
grew up on the upper end of the Mis-
sissippi, but she found a home in the 
lower end of the Mississippi—or at 
least the office that represented Lou-
isiana. She joined my staff at the be-
ginning of my first Senate term as a 
scheduler but through sheer excellence 
became deputy chief of staff and a 
close confidant. 
Trust is so important. I learned I 
could always trust Allie’s judgment 
and her ability to accomplish any-
thing. She is irreplaceable. She has had 
an impact on this office, ensuring that 
we better serve Louisiana, but that im-
pact has meant that we will better 
serve Louisiana even after her depar-
ture. 
Some examples. For any office to 
succeed, it needs to run efficiently and 
effectively. I knew this, that we had to 
have systems. Allie figured out the sys-
tems. She implemented them across all 
the offices here in DC and Louisiana. 
She kept things running smoothly. And 
she has a skill of identifying an indi-
vidual’s strengths and helping that in-
dividual leverage those strengths into 
results that contributed to the whole 
but also to the future of the individual. 
I am about to say this about Allie, 
but I could say it of Chris and also of 
David, whom I am about to speak of. In 
Mark chapter 10, versus 42 through 45, 
Jesus speaks about servant leadership, 
and in there is a quote that ‘‘the great-
est among you shall be your servants.’’ 
Allie is someone who has served others 
and helped others serve as well. Wheth-
er it be our staff, our mission, our con-
stituents, the State of Louisiana, or 
the United States of America, she 
served creatively and tirelessly. She 
will be greatly missed, but I am look-
ing forward to all that she achieves as 
she enters the next phase of her career. 
TRIBUTE TO DAVID MILLS 
Madam President, now let me speak 
of David Mills, a Louisiana native and 
a man of tremendous character and 
deep faith who has served for 5 years on 
my staff. He came to Washington be-
cause he felt called to give back to his 
State and Nation through public serv-
ice. He was working in Congress for the 
right reasons, and his work reflected 
that. 
David handled pro-life issues and 
other legal issues for my office. He was 
key in last year’s impeachment trial as 
an attorney providing quick, reliable 
research to supplement my under-
standing of the testimony that we 
heard. 
David also has the ability just to 
note something others don’t notice and 
then very gently suggest some modi-
fication of how I would handle a situa-
tion, and that modification, although 
nuanced, could be so important, and I 
really learned to trust those insights. 
David also handled privacy issues and 
has laid the foundation for work that

will continue after he has left us. As 
society becomes more technologically 
centered, we must ensure that data pri-
vacy laws keep up. David was on the 
forefront of that, thinking, how do we 
protect the privacy of consumers? 
As I mentioned, this will be an im-
portant issue in this upcoming Con-
gress, and just let me be specific. David 
developed legislation on questions re-
garding the data that is collected from 
a wearable, a smartwatch, a contact 
tracing app, and other information 
that provides personal health informa-
tion but which is not covered by cur-
rent personal health information laws. 
Our office will continue to build on Da-
vid’s work in those areas, and I thank 
David for all he has done. 
Sometimes people say: Oh my gosh, 
those folks who are younger than those 
of us in the Senate—is there something 
lacking? I can promise you, among 
these, there is nothing lacking. They 
are the leaders who will take your 
place and my place as we pass the 
baton to the next generation, and, in 
turn, they shall pass to another to 
leave our future brighter than it has 
been in the past. 
NOMINATION OF JANET LOUISE YELLEN 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, 
I rise in support of Janet Yellen’s nom-
ination to be Secretary of the U.S. De-
partment of the Treasury. I’ve known 
Janet since she became president of the 
Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco 
in 2004. I believe she is an excellent 
nominee for this position. 
Janet has an impressive record. She 
served twice on the Federal Reserve 
Board of Governors and was the first 
woman to chair the Fed from 2014 to 
2018. She became a professor of eco-
nomics at the University of Cali-
fornia—Berkeley in 1980, she is now 
professor emeritus. Dr. Yellen served 
as Chair of the Council of Economic 
Advisors under President Clinton and 
has been very active as a distinguished 
fellow at the Brookings Institution. 
As some have joked, Janet’s husband 
of 42 years, George, won the Nobel 
Prize in Economic Sciences, yet he is 
only the second-most accomplished 
economist in his own home. 
All of these accomplishments did not 
come easily for a woman in the male- 
dominated field of economics. 
Out of the 24 students who received 
doctorates in economics from Yale in 
1971, Janet was the only woman. She 
has been a trailblazer her entire career. 
Now, Janet brings the experience and 
leadership needed at the Treasury De-
partment at this critical juncture. 
I believe that Janet understands that 
the economy is not an abstract series 
of charts and figures, but a collection 
of real individuals, families, commu-
nities and businesses who need help 
now. 
At the same time, she is pragmatic 
and recognizes the need for fiscal dis-
cipline. I believe she made that clear in 
her confirmation before the Finance 
Committee, where I had the honor of 
introducing her. 
In short, she is the ideal candidate to 
head the Treasury Department at a 
time when we can afford nothing less. I 
urge the Senate to confirm her nomi-
nation. Thank you. 
Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, as 
we face an economic crisis brought on 
by COVID–19, we will need steady, 
proven leadership at the Treasury De-
partment. A highly respected econo-
mist, Dr. Yellen served first as Vice 
Chair and then Chair of the Federal Re-
serve. She has served under Democratic 
and Republican presidents and during 
periods of economic crisis and eco-
nomic growth. 
Last year, I worked with my col-
leagues to deliver bipartisan relief for 
those who have been harmed by the 
pandemic. We addressed the crisis in 
five bills totaling approximately $3 
trillion. Through subsequent negotia-
tions in November and December on an 
additional $900 billion package, we se-
cured a second round of Paycheck Pro-
tection Program forgivable loans for 
the hardest hit small businesses and 
extended unemployment programs, as-
sistance for schools, vaccine delivery, 
and more. But additional work re-
mains. 
During 
this 
crisis, 
Secretary 
Mnuchin proved himself to be an able 
partner to all of us in delivering this 
relief. It is my hope that Treasury Sec-
retary-designate Yellen will build on 
our work. In her testimony before the 
Senate Finance Committee and during 
the subsequent questions, Dr. Yellen 
made clear that she understands these 
needs. 
Our nation’s eight living former Sec-
retaries of the Treasury have provided 
their support for the nomination. I 
urge the swift confirmation of Janet 
Yellen to ensure that President Biden 
has a qualified economic team in place. 
Thank you. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise today to support the nomi-
nation of Janet Yellen, a dedicated 
public 
servant 
and 
world-renowned 
economist, as Secretary of the Treas-
ury. 
Janet Yellen’s extensive background 
in economics and accomplished career 
in the field led her to Chair the Federal 
Reserve, where she served with distinc-
tion in the aftermath of the great re-
cession. Ms. Yellen brought a steady 
hand and wisdom befitting her experi-
ence to her responsibilities at the helm 
of the Federal Reserve, and as a mem-
ber of the Banking Committee, I al-
ways appreciated her frank testimony 
and thoughtful analysis. 
In her new role as Treasury Sec-
retary, she will inherit an economic 
crisis caused by a mismanaged pan-
demic. She will be charged not only 
with providing historic relief in close 
coordination with Congress, but also 
with building back better to create the 
conditions for a dynamic economy that 
harnesses the potential of each and 
every American. I am confident in her 
ability to take on these urgent chal-
lenges. I look forward to voting yes on 
her nomination and working closely 
with her in the years ahead to ensure 
that we build an economy that works 
for everyone. 
Mr. CASSIDY. I yield the floor.

CONFIRMATION OF JANET LOUISE 
YELLEN 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, I 
am going to be one of the first Sen-
ators to congratulate Dr. Yellen, now 
Secretary Yellen, to be Secretary of 
the Treasury of the United States. 
You saw it was a strong vote, and 
there is no doubt that she has the cre-
dentials, the experience, the qualifica-
tions to be Secretary of the Treasury— 
former Chairman of the Fed. I mean, 
her resume is off the charts. 
I know her nomination is historic for 
so many women across the country, in-
cluding my three daughters. I am men-
tioning this because I certainly in-
tended 
to 
vote 
for 
now-Secretary 
Yellen, and I was a ‘‘no’’ vote. 
I want to explain my ‘‘no’’ vote be-
cause I had a very good conversation 
with her just the other day. We covered 
a whole bunch of topics—everything 
from Alaska Native corporations to the 
strength of the dollar, to our debt and 
deficit—big macroeconomic issues that 
are important to the country, particu-
larly as we are in a recession. It is im-
portant to my State. 
But we got to the topic of energy. We 
got to the topic of energy, and, reluc-
tantly, I am saying this now because I 
was a bit shocked that despite a long, 
robust discussion, it was very difficult 
to get her, from my perspective, to 
commit to being a Secretary of the 
Treasury, the most important eco-
nomic player in any Cabinet in any 
government—in the U.S. Government, 
besides, of course, the President—to 
commit to being a strong advocate for 
a robust, all-of-the-above energy sector 
for the U.S. economy. 
This is not a radical proposition. I 
would argue that every Secretary of 
the Treasury since Alexander Hamilton 
has been a robust supporter of resource 
development in our energy sector— 
again, all of it—renewables, oil, gas. 
And the reason is that it has been such 
an 
important 
driver 
of 
economic 
growth and jobs for pretty much our 
Nation’s entire existence. 
Now that we are in this recession— 
deep 
recession—we 
need 
good 
job 
growth, and we need a strong recovery. 
To me, having the Secretary of the 
Treasury be a strong proponent in the 
debates about policy for the energy 
sector, I thought, was a no-brainer. As 
a matter of fact, I think pretty much 
every Secretary of the Treasury has 
been that person. Again, in the 2008– 
2009 recession—the deep, great reces-
sion—the No. 1 driver of economic 
growth and job growth and capital for-
mation for the U.S. economy was the 
energy sector, and it was supported. 
Democrats and Republicans, for dec-
ades, have supported a strong energy 
sector. 
But despite a long, respectful debate 
with now Secretary Yellen, with whom 
I certainly have a good relationship, I 
could not get that commitment, which 
I thought was surprising. As a matter 
of fact, I thought it was shocking, and 
it is the reason I reluctantly voted no 
because, again, she is very qualified. 
What is going on here is we are start-
ing to see policies that I believe need a 
national debate. We are starting to see 
policies—yes, we all want renewables, 
clean energy, but we have a really im-
portant, strong energy sector. 
Prior to the pandemic, we were the 
world’s superpower of energy again. 
One of the reasons we won World War 
II was our energy sector. The men and 
women who have been producing en-
ergy—‘‘all of the above’’ energy—are 
great patriotic workers who have been 
doing it for decades to the benefit of 
every single American. 
We need a debate because what I am 
starting to see with the new adminis-
tration, unfortunately—and I have had 
discussions, and, hopefully, they are 
not going to go down this path—are Ex-
ecutive actions that are going to target 
certain sectors of the energy sector, 
the U.S. economy. 
Natural gas. We can be dominant in 
natural gas for 100 years. We are going 
to start targeting workers in the nat-
ural gas sector? 
Oil. I know some people don’t like 
oil, but it is important. 
We can do all of this, but right now, 
there seems to be hostility toward the 
sector and the workers and no debate. 
We should have that debate. It is an 
important debate. It is really impor-
tant in my State, but I think it is real-
ly important to America. 
Every Secretary of the Treasury for 
the last three, four, five, six, seven dec-
ades—since World War II—has always 
sought the goal of getting America 
back to energy independence. That is 
good for jobs. It is good for low-cost 
manufacturing. It is good to reduce the 
heating and energy bills of American 
families. It is good for our national se-
curity. It is good for our foreign policy. 
We are pretty much on the verge of 
doing this. And now we are going to 
start to unilaterally disarm? 
We have gotten to the point where I 
can’t find anyone—and I hope I am 
wrong—in the Biden administration 
Cabinet who is going to be a proponent 
of a strong energy sector. Who is it? I 
was hoping it was going to be the Sec-
retary of the Treasury. Maybe in our 
long discussion, I misinterpreted where 
she is going to be on this issue. Pretty 
much every previous Secretary—Demo-
cratic and Republican—in the history 
of our great Nation has really, really 
been an advocate for the men and 
women who work in the sector and for 
the economic growth it brings and for 
the help it brings to families and the 
good jobs it brings. So that is the ra-
tionale behind my vote. 
Right now, I think we are starting to 
see, whether with the Keystone Pipe-
line decision or with the men and 
women in the building trades, who 
have built this country through hard 
work, that they are being laid off by 
the thousands. We had a big scare back 
home in my State. All weekend, I was 
working this issue of these Executive 
orders from the Biden administration, 
where it looked like it was going to 
send hundreds of people home, unem-
ployed—oil and gas workers in my 
State. Why? I hope that is not the case, 
especially during a recession. 
We need a debate on it, and I cer-
tainly hope somebody in this adminis-
tration, in their principals’ meetings, 
talk about how we get good jobs and a 
strong working class. I have noticed 
that the National Security Advisor, 
Jake Sullivan, keeps talking about 
basing our policies on working-class 
families. You can’t get more blue-col-
lar, strong middle class than these en-
ergy sector jobs. 
I, certainly, want to have a good, 
constructive relationship with the Sec-
retary of the Treasury and her team, 
but given the people I represent and 
what I am starting to see right now, I 
could not in good conscience vote yes 
when, on the basic question of ‘‘Are 
you committed and will you be a 
strong advocate for a strong energy 
sector—you name it: renewables, nat-
ural 
gas, 
wind, 
solar—all 
of 
the 
above?’’ I couldn’t get that commit-
ment. I reluctantly voted no on some-
one who has a background and experi-
ence in these other areas that are im-
portant for the country. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
f 
CLIMATE CHANGE 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, I have hastened to the floor be-
cause I was upstairs, waiting for the 
House managers to bring the article 
over, and I heard my friend, the distin-
guished Senator from Alaska, talking 
about his concern about the fossil fuel 
part of the energy sector and his dis-
satisfaction with what the Secretary of 
the Treasury was able to assure him of 
in that regard. 
I just wanted to note that I missed a 
moment of the Senator’s remarks when 
I came walking down here, but as best 
as I could tell, the Senator never men-
tioned the term ‘‘climate change,’’ and 
he never referenced ‘‘carbon emis-
sions.’’ I have to say, if we are going to 
deal with our energy sector, we have to 
deal with it in a way that takes into 
account carbon emissions and climate 
change. You can’t just whistle past 
those things and pretend that they are 
not real and act as if we can continue 
to go forward in the way we always 
have—releasing carbon dioxide in the 
atmosphere, poisoning our oceans with 
acidification, warming the planet, and 
putting coastal communities like mine 
at grave risk from sea level rise and 
storm surge. We have to address those 
things.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S124 
January 25, 2021 
As we go forward in this new Con-
gress, I very much hope that my friend 
Senator SULLIVAN and I will be able to 
work together to address that exact 
problem to make sure that not only is 
our energy mix strong for our economy 
but to make absolutely sure that we 
are not sacrificing the safety of our 
planet, the economic security of our fu-
ture generations, and the health of peo-
ple all around the planet who have, 
really, no choice but to live close to 
the land and feel the pounding of cli-
mate change in their immediate lives 
every day. We have to address those 
things, and I hope we will. 
So, in having heard his side of the ar-
gument, I just wanted to come back to 
the floor and offer the other side. 
Somewhere between us there is a reso-
lution because I know perfectly well 
that the State of Alaska is getting hit 
by the acidification and warming side 
and by the sea level rise and storm 
surge side of this problem, just as 
much as Rhode Island is. Perhaps, be-
cause, as my friend constantly reminds 
me, Alaska has a huge advantage of 
size over Rhode Island, one could even 
imagine that it is having more of an ef-
fect than Rhode Island. 
So with those comments and with af-
fection and regard for my colleague 
from Alaska, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, as 
a lot of our colleagues here know, Sen-
ator WHITEHOUSE is not just a distin-
guished Senator but one of my very 
good friends here in the U.S. Senate. 
So I always respect what he has to say, 
and I appreciate his words. He and I 
have done a lot of work—some key 
work, particularly on issues of the en-
vironment 
and 
cleaning 
up 
our 
oceans—ocean acidification—and I look 
forward to continuing to work with 
him. Climate change is also, certainly, 
happening in my State. We are seeing 
it. No doubt about it. 
My point is we have an economy that 
is in recession, and you have tens of 
thousands—literally, hundreds of thou-
sands—of people out of work, and you 
have a sector that is important—crit-
ical, actually—the energy sector. There 
is no doubt about it. I know we can use 
words like spewing and polluters, but 
the energy sector has been one of the 
things that has made this country so 
strong, with great jobs—middle-class 
jobs—and people can’t deny that. All I 
am asking for is for the new Secretary 
of the Treasury to look at that. 
We are looking at the whole U.S. 
economy and the strength of our recov-
ery and good-paying jobs. That has to 
be taken into account. What I worry 
about is that it is not. We need a de-
bate, and I would welcome it with my 
good friend on: What is the strategy? 
The strategy out of the box can’t be 
that we are going to go after these oil 
and gas jobs and put people out of 
work. And replace it with what? 
We had a hearing in the Commerce 
Committee with the new, incoming 
Transportation Secretary. A lot of peo-
ple asked: Well, what are you going to 
replace it with? What are you telling 
the 10,000 guys who just lost their jobs 
on the Keystone Pipeline their new 
jobs are going to be? They have mort-
gages and tuitions to pay. They are out 
of work right now. So we need a strat-
egy. 
Look, I look forward to working on 
all of these issues with my good friend 
from Rhode Island, but it is, I think, a 
first. If you look back at the great his-
tory of this Nation, if you don’t have a 
U.S. Treasury Secretary or other mem-
bers of the Cabinet who are for a ro-
bust, strong energy sector—which, of 
course, would include renewables—that 
is new, that is different, and, I think, it 
is very troubling, particularly as it re-
lates to the jobs that, I think, are 
going to be sacrificed on a policy and a 
strategy that I have not seen the meat 
and bones of yet. I am just seeing the 
damage, and a lot of the damage is 
starting to happen to the people I care 
about, particularly in my State, who 
work in these sectors and who are 
great Americans who have helped build 
this country and build my State. We 
can’t just disregard them and say: 
Don’t worry; you are going to get a 
green job later. 
It is tough to tell people that. It is 
tough to tell people that when they 
have mortgages and tuitions, and we 
are relying on them. 
So I commit to continuing to work 
on these issues and others with my 
friend from Rhode Island. I appreciate 
his coming down here, but I wanted to 
explain my vote on an issue that I 
think we need to debate here in the 
Senate that is important for our Na-
tion. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, I would just close by suggesting 
that perhaps my friend, the Senator 
from Alaska, can sympathize, since he 
fears that the interests that he came to 
the floor here to defend will not be lis-
tened to. Perhaps he can sympathize 
with the fact that, for 4 years, an en-
tire administration wouldn’t give the 
time of day to the sea level rise con-
cerns that are threatening my State. 
We are talking about Freddie Mac. We 
are talking about a property value 
crash across all of our coasts that is 
going to cause enormous harm to 
Rhode Island, and we just left an ad-
ministration that wouldn’t pay one 
iota of attention to that. It had fossil 
fuel industry climate deniers, and 
there is such a thing. Not everybody in 
the fossil fuel industry is that way, but 
they picked the bottom feeders to 
bring into government. 
I share the Senator’s frustration, but 
let me say I have got it about 10,000 
times over after having lived with the 
Trump administration for the past 4 
years and gotten nothing and after 
having tried to bring serious climate 
debate to the floor, knowing that the 
Republican leader was going to block 
it. So, yes, I sympathize with his dis-
tress, and I hope he sympathizes with 
my, rather, greater, cumulative dis-
tress from the last 4 years. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. With-
out objection, it is so ordered. 
The hour of 7 p.m. having arrived, 
the Acting Sergeant at Arms will 
present the managers on the part of

NANCY PELOSI, Speaker of the House 
of Representatives. 
With the permission of the Senate, I 
will now read the Article of Impeach-
ment, House Resolution 24. 
HOUSE RESOLUTION 24 
In the House of Representatives, 
U.S., January 13, 2021. 
Impeaching 
Donald 
John 
Trump, 
President of the United States, for high 
crimes and misdemeanors. 
Resolved, that Donald John Trump, 
President of the United States, is im-
peached for high crimes and mis-
demeanors and that the following arti-
cle of impeachment be exhibited to the 
United States Senate: 
Article of impeachment exhibited by 
the House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in the name 
of itself and of the people of the United 
States of America, against Donald 
John Trump, President of the United 
States of America, in maintenance and 
support of its impeachment against 
him for high crimes and misdemeanors. 
Article I: Incitement of Insurrection 
The Constitution provides that the 
House of Representatives ‘‘shall have 
the sole Power of Impeachment’’ and 
that the President ‘‘shall be removed 
from Office on Impeachment for, and 
Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or 
other high Crimes and Misdemeanors’’. 
Further, section 3 of the 14th Amend-
ment to the Constitution prohibits any 
person who has ‘‘engaged in insurrec-
tion or rebellion against’’ the United 
States from ‘‘hold[ing] any office . . . 
under the United States’’. In his con-
duct while President of the United 
States—and in violation of his con-
stitutional oath faithfully to execute 
the office of President of the United 
States and, to the best of his ability, 
preserve, protect, and defend the Con-
stitution of the United States, and in 
violation of his constitutional duty to 
take care that the laws be faithfully 
executed—Donald John Trump engaged 
in high Crimes and Misdemeanors by 
inciting violence against the Govern-
ment of the United States, in that: 
On January 6, 2021, pursuant to the 
12th Amendment to the Constitution of 
the United States, the Vice President 
of the United States, the House of Rep-
resentatives, and the Senate met at the 
United States Capitol for a Joint Ses-
sion of Congress to count the votes of 
the Electoral College. In the months 
preceding the Joint Session, President 
Trump repeatedly issued false state-
ments asserting that the Presidential 
election results were the product of 
widespread fraud and should not be ac-
cepted by the American people or cer-
tified by State or Federal officials. 
Shortly before the Joint Session com-
menced, President Trump, addressed a 
crowd at the Ellipse in Washington, 
DC. There, he reiterated false claims 
that ‘‘we won this election, and we won 
it by a landslide’’. He also willfully 
made statements that, in context, en-
couraged—and foreseeably resulted in— 
lawless action at the Capitol, such as: 
‘‘if you don’t fight like hell you’re not 
going to have a country anymore’’. 
Thus incited by President Trump, 
members of the crowd he had ad-
dressed, in an attempt to, among other 
objectives, interfere with the Joint 
Session’s solemn constitutional duty 
to certify the results of the 2020 Presi-
dential election, unlawfully breached 
and vandalized the Capitol, injured and 
killed law enforcement personnel, men-
aced Members of Congress, the Vice 
President, 
and 
Congressional 
per-
sonnel, and engaged in other violent, 
deadly, destructive, and seditious acts. 
President Trump’s conduct on Janu-
ary 6, 2021, followed his prior efforts to 
subvert and obstruct the certification 
of the results of the 202 Presidential 
election. Those prior efforts included a 
phone call on January 2, 2021, during 
which President Trump urged the sec-
retary 
of 
state 
of 
Georgia, 
Brad 
Raffensperger, to ‘‘find’’ enough votes 
to overturn the Georgia Presidential 
election results and threatened Sec-
retary Raffensperger if he failed to do 
so. 
In all this, President Trump gravely 
endangered the security of the United 
States and its institutions of Govern-
ment. He threatened the integrity of 
the democratic system, interfered with 
the peaceful transition of power, and 
imperiled a coequal branch of Govern-
ment. He thereby betrayed his trust as 
President, to the manifest injury of the 
people of the United States. 
Wherefore, Donald John Trump, by 
such conduct, has demonstrated that 
he will remain a threat to national se-
curity, democracy, and the Constitu-
tion if allowed to remain in office, and 
has acted in a manner grossly incom-
patible with self-governance and the 
rule of law. Donald John Trump thus 
warrants impeachment and trial, re-
moval from office, and disqualification 
to hold and enjoy any office of honor, 
trust, or profit under the United 
States. 
NANCY PELOSI, Speaker of the House 
of Representatives. 
Mr. President, that completes the ex-
hibition of the Article of Impeachment 
against Donald John Trump, President 
of the United States. The managers re-
quest that the Senate take order for 
the trial. The managers now request 
leave to withdraw. 
The 
PRESIDENT 
pro 
tempore. 
Thank you, Mr. Manager RASKIN. The 
Senate will duly notify the House of 
Representatives when it is ready to 
proceed with the trial. 
You may proceed to depart. 
The majority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I suggest the absence 
of a quorum. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S126 
January 25, 2021 
REMEMBERING PAUL SARBANES 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, all of 
us in this body mourn the recent pass-
ing of former Senator Paul Sarbanes. 
Those of us who served with him have 
known him as one of the finest and 
most 
accomplished 
Senators 
with 
whom we have served. And what a 
great pleasure it was to work with him, 
on so many issues. 
In addition to his impressive legisla-
tive accomplishments, Paul Sarbanes 
was one of the Senate’s keenest inter-
rogators and one of the Senate’s finest 
orators. In the Senate community, 
most of all we knew him for his wit, for 
his warmth and kindness, and for his 
decency. 
I would like to call to the Senate’s 
attention an insightful remembrance of 
Senator Sarbanes by Paul Glastris that 
was published this month by the Wash-
ington Monthly. 
I ask unanimous consent that the ar-
ticle be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the Washington Monthly, Jan. 1, 2021] 
REMEMBERING PAUL SARBANES 
HOW
WIT, INTEGRITY
AND
EXPERTISE
MADE 
AMERICA’S FIRST GREEK AMERICAN SENATOR 
A
BEHIND-THE-SCENES
WASHINGTON
POWER 
PLAYER. 
(By Paul Glastris) 
There have been many fine tributes to 
former U.S. Senator Paul Sarbanes of Mary-
land, who passed away December 6 at age 87. 
These encomiums invariably note the near 
universal high regard he enjoyed in Wash-
ington for his intelligence, integrity, humor, 
and accomplishments—the latter consisting 
mostly of liberal legislation he managed, via 
his other attributes, to get Republicans to 
support. They include, while a young House 
member, 
the 
articles 
of 
impeachment 
against Richard Nixon and, in the Senate, 
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which tough-
ened regulations and created government 
oversight of corporate accounting practices 
after the Enron debacle. He also served on 
the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee for 
decades with Joe Biden and was a boss and 
mentor to a number of the president-elect’s 
senior advisors, including Antony Blinken, 
his nominee for secretary of state. 
But I want to focus on another set of his 
deeds, ones associated with his role as the 
leading Greek American in Congress. They 
begin with what has come to be known as the 
‘‘Sarbanes Rule.’’ 
The rule dictates that ‘‘any Greek Amer-
ican awards dinner should conclude on the 
same day it begins.’’ The Senator devised 
this dictate after patiently sitting through 
countless such dinners. They would go on in-
terminably due to the fact that the orga-
nizers, wanting to acknowledge as many ben-
efactors as possible, would bring to the po-
dium a speaker (usually a wealthy Greek- 
American businessman) whose job it was to 
introduce another such speaker, who would 
then introduce another speaker, who would 
finally present the award to the person who 
would then speak, typically at some length 
(these are Greeks we’re talking about). 
Since multiple honors were bestowed on 
any given evening, the result was awards 
ceremonies that began with cocktails at 6 
PM but wouldn’t end until well after mid-
night. At which point the priest would give 
the benediction, the color guard would 
march the U.S. and Greek flags out of the 
ballroom, the bouzouki band would come 
out, and everyone would dance for several 
more hours. Having attended these events 
regularly in DC from the 1990s until COVID– 
19, I can attest that after the Senator intro-
duced his rule about a decade ago, the pro-
ceedings tightened considerably, with the 
dancing commencing at a more civilized 10 
PM. 
It was at one of these dinners that I got to 
know Sarbanes personally when my late wife 
Kukula found herself seated next to him. She 
asked him what kind of cocktail he liked and 
went to the bar to fetch it. The two of them 
spent the rest of the evening animatedly 
chatting about foreign affairs—Kuku, a jour-
nalist and the daughter of a diplomat, had 
strong and informed views on the subject. 
Our hosts Manny and Marilyn Rouvelas must 
have noticed, because the next year the place 
cards showed that Kuku was again seated 
next to the Senator. When she saw Sarbanes 
walk into the ballroom, she went to the bar 
and, remembering his drink of choice (it was 
one of her superpowers), had it waiting for 
him when he arrived at the table. He was 
charmed and delighted; she felt the same 
about him. For years thereafter the two of 
them were annual dinner mates. There were 
far more powerful people in the room than 
Kuku, but the fact that Sarbanes was con-
tent to spend the evening talking with her 
told me everything I needed to know about 
his character. 
‘‘Unlike many of his contemporary office-
holders, Mr. Sarbanes was uncomfortable 
with the backslapping, glad-handing and 
grandstanding that often go with public of-
fice,’’ his Washington Post obituary reads. 
‘‘He avoided the social and party circuit in 
the nation’s capital and rarely spent a night 
in Washington, preferring instead to drive 
home to his wife and children in Baltimore.’’ 
At these Greek dinners, however, Sarbanes 
was in his element. While other politicians 
would drop by (it was a target-rich donor en-
vironment), he would stay for hours, chat-
ting with the scores of people who would 
come to the table to meet him, then eventu-
ally excusing himself to work the room, 
table by table, shaking every hand. 
The way he brought order to those dinners 
with his Sarbanes rule is a small illustration 
of what made the Senator effective and re-
spected in Washington. Born to Greek immi-
grant restaurant owners in 1933, Sarbanes 
earned scholarships and degrees from Prince-
ton, Oxford, and Harvard. He had an intellec-
tual gift for getting to the heart of knotty 
problems and formulating wise solutions 
with a wit that put his colleagues at ease. He 
deployed this genius throughout his career, 
often in the service of selling unpopular but 
vitally necessary policies like the return of 
the Panama Canal. As former Democratic 
Senate leader Thomas Daschle told the New 
York Times, when ‘‘trying to persuade the 
caucus to do something difficult, I would use 
Paul to bring it home, to close the argu-
ment.’’ 
In the Greek American community he is 
most remembered for spearheading—along 
with another young Greek-American con-
gressman, John Brademus—a 1974 House ef-
fort to cut off U.S. arms sales to Turkey 
after that country invaded and occupied the 
independent majority-Greek-speaking nation 
of Cyprus. The Nixon and Ford administra-
tions fiercely opposed the legislation because 
Turkey, a NATO ally, shared a militarized 
border with the Soviet Union. But Sarbanes, 
Brademus, and others in the newly-activated 
Greek American community countered on 
not only moral but legal grounds: U.S. stat-
ute, they correctly noted, specifically re-
quired the administration to cut off arms 
sales to any country that used such weapons 
offensively. 
Several of the multiple House votes to pass 
the embargo and then override a presidential 
veto succeeded by only a one-vote margin, 
recalls Andy Manatos, then an aide to Sen-
ator Tom Eagleton, who was successfully 
championing similar embargo legislation in 
the Senate. ‘‘It would never have passed in 
the House without the esteem Paul and John 
enjoyed,’’ says Manatos, now the dean of 
Greek-American lobbyists, adding that Sar-
banes and Brademus were two of the three 
Rhodes Scholars then serving in that body. 
The Turkish arms embargo—the first time 
in modern U.S. history that Congress suc-
cessfully overturned the White House on a 
major foreign policy issue—lasted three and 
a half years before the Carter administration 
managed to get it repealed. But it was re-
placed by an agreement in Washington to 
sell arms to Greece and Turkey on a 7-to-10 
basis in order to achieve a military balance 
in the Aegean, an agreement Sarbanes vigor-
ously defended for years after. 
Being seen as a fierce advocate for your 
own minority ethnic constituency can be 
risky for any politician seeking higher of-
fice. Sarbanes managed to pull it off in 1976 
when he became the first Greek American 
elected to the U.S. Senate (he would be fol-
lowed by Paul Tsongas and Olympia Snowe). 
He was hardly a radical on the issue. ‘‘I met 
today with a number of Cypriot foreign min-
isters’’ he would joke to friends after rebuff-
ing, say, a group of Greek diner owners de-
manding he take stronger actions than the 
Cypriot government itself wanted. But over 
the subsequent decades, through constant 
study and engagement with experts on the 
region, he built a reputation as the man to 
see on anything regarding the Eastern Medi-
terranean—from 
Turkish 
air 
threats 
to 
Greek territory in the Aegean to the be-
sieged 
Greek 
Orthodox 
patriarchate 
in 
Istanbul. Greek prime ministers sought his 
counsel. So too did U.S. presidents, secre-
taries of state, and senior diplomats. ‘‘In 
that cerebral way of his, he would analyze 
the whole situation and explain to people 
what to do, who to talk to, what to be care-
ful of,’’ recalls Manatos. ‘‘He was hands down 
far ahead of anyone else in Congress in his 
thinking about these issues.’’ 
People underestimate, especially in the 
age of Trump, the degree to which knowledge 
can be power in Washington. Sarbanes did 
not. He ‘‘studied issues himself rather than 
rely on staff talking points,’’ recalls John 
Sitilides, who worked with the Senator as a 
GOP staffer on the Senate Banking Com-
mittee before starting the Western Policy 
Center, a security think tank focused on the 
Eastern Mediterranean. His mastery of sub-
stance gave Sarbanes ‘‘the freedom to argue 
and discern based on his own knowledge,’’ 
says Sitilides, which in turn earned him the 
confidence of Senators on both sides of the 
aisle. That kind of power is typically wit-
nessed only by insiders, though public 
glimpses of it can sometimes be caught. Nick 
Larigakis, executive director of the Amer-
ican Hellenic Institute, notes that Sarbanes 
could be ‘‘relied upon to ask the tough and 
probing questions’’ on issues important to 
Greek Americans at confirmation hearings 
for US ambassadors to the region—an effec-
tive way to keep Foggy Bottom on its toes. 
If Sarbanes’ mind was legendary, so too 
was his rectitude. He managed a 40-year ca-
reer in politics—from his first election to the 
Maryland House of Delegates in 1967 to his 
retirement from the U.S. Senate in 2007— 
without a hint of personal scandal. That’s no 
small feat for someone who rose through the 
often-corrupting culture of Maryland poli-
tics (Spiro Agnew, another Greek American 
politician from Maryland, was not so care-
ful). Sarbanes enjoyed a 48-year marriage to 
his wife Christine, who passed away in 2009.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S127 
January 25, 2021 
And he was famously averse to raising 
money, even for his own campaigns. (His son 
John Sarbanes, who represents his father’s 
old congressional district, has carried on 
that tradition by sponsoring the House’s 
leading campaign finance reform legisla-
tion.) Indeed, much of the Senator’s career 
success was due to his savvy longtime chief 
of staff Peter Marudas, another Greek Amer-
ican who could not only go toe to toe with 
Sarbanes on the issues but ably manage the 
more transactional demands of his office. 
Joe Biden has spoken optimistically—na-
ively in the opinion of many—about his abil-
ity as president to work productively with 
Mitch McConnell and other Republicans on 
substantive issues. To the degree he honestly 
believes that, it is because he has done so in 
his own career, and watched others, like 
Paul Sarbanes, do so as well. 
After the Senator died, Biden tweeted: 
‘‘Paul Sarbanes and I served together on the 
Foreign Relations Committee for 30 years. 
There was no one sharper, more committed, 
or with firmer principles. And he, too, re-
turned to his family nearly every night. 
They meant the world to him. Rest In Peace, 
Paul.’’ 
f 
‘‘DOMESTIC TERRORISM IN THE 
CAPITOL’’ 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, what 
our Nation witnessed and what Mem-
bers of Congress and the dedicated staff 
that work in the Capitol witnessed on 
January 6 was a deadly attack on one 
of our most sacred and historic con-
stitutional duties: the count and final 
certification of the results of our Presi-
dential election. The violent insurrec-
tion that occurred in the Capitol, 
which took the lives of five people, in-
cluding an officer of the U.S. Capitol 
Police, was an attack on our democ-
racy. The votes cast in the 2020 Presi-
dential election were counted and re-
counted. The results were challenged in 
the courts and ultimately were cer-
tified in every single State. Yet, citing 
the baseless chant that the election 
was ‘‘stolen,’’ an angry and violent 
mob stormed the Capitol in an effort to 
suspend the democratic process, over-
turn the will of the American people, 
and ensure that now-former President 
Trump remained in office. These insur-
rectionists vandalized the very heart of 
our government and threatened and 
harmed those sworn to protect it. 
In 
a 
column 
in 
the 
VTDigger, 
Haviland Smith, a Vermonter and the 
first chief of counterterrorism oper-
ations for the Central Intelligence 
Agency, makes the strong case that 
the insurrection on January 6 was an 
act of domestic terrorism. I am certain 
that the FBI and the Department of 
Justice will continue to investigate 
and, where appropriate, to file charges 
and hold these people to account. But 
in this Chamber, we must heed Mr. 
Smith’s wisdom. As legislative body, as 
public servants, we must reckon with 
the lies and anti-democratic discourse 
that fueled this attack and work to en-
sure that such an act of domestic ter-
ror never occurs again. 
I ask unanimous consent that the 
piece written by Haviland Smith, titled 
‘‘Domestic Terrorism in the Capitol,’’ 
be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the VTDigger, Jan. 8, 2021] 
DOMESTIC TERRORISM IN THE CAPITOL 
(By Haviland Smith) 
It is a fact that the best, noblest political 
movements often attract the worst kind of 
violent participants. These people barge in 
and commit the kinds of violent acts that ul-
timately change the focus of a previously be-
nign movement to violent terrorist activi-
ties. These are viewed quite differently and 
are generally punished more severely than 
normal criminal activities. 
That is what we are seeing today in the 
United States. Whether you agree with their 
goals or not, the vast majority of Trump 
supporters are non-violent Americans who 
seek basic changes in American life. They 
plan to reach their goals by supporting 
Trump. 
Right 
now, 
that 
means 
dem-
onstrating peacefully on his behalf and 
agreeing with and backing his claims of 
fraud in the 2020 presidential election which 
he lost to Joe Biden. 
The other part of this picture is the violent 
one. There is unquestionably a smaller group 
or groups who, for whatever reasons, see 
these peaceful demonstrations as an oppor-
tunity to raise havoc, to partake in the only 
form of protest that turns them on—vio-
lence. 
What none of these folks seem to realize is 
that in the commission of felonies (entering 
the U.S. Capitol forcefully, etc.) in the pur-
suit of political goals (the illegal participa-
tion in maintaining Trump in power) they 
qualify nicely for classification as terrorists. 
At one point during the invasion of the 
Capitol, it was announced by the TV com-
mentators that the invaders were beginning 
to leave the area. Careful examination of the 
TV footage at the time shows that the people 
leaving the area were old, often female—a 
less fit, less bellicose group. In fact, they 
were the Capitol invaders who had no inten-
tion of getting involved in what clearly was 
becoming a potentially violent situation. 
They simply were not up to it politically, 
mentally or physically. 
On the other hand, who stayed behind? 
Those who were actively interested in be-
coming involved in violence. Did you notice 
how many of them wore helmets? The only 
reason you wear a helmet is to protect your-
self from violent attacks on your head and 
that is clearly what they were doing. They 
anticipated participating in violence. In ad-
dition, the stay-behinds were a major cut in 
age below those who were leaving. They were 
the sort who could climb vertical walls, 
break through windows and throw projectiles 
at the protecting police force. The fact that 
5 people died, over 80 were arrested, and 50 
police officers were injured bears eloquent 
testimony to the fact that this was a ter-
rorist invasion encouraged by the sitting 
President of the United States, his family 
members and Republican colleagues. 
Ever since the results of the November 
election became known, the President has 
created and maintained the fiction that 
widespread fraud was involved in the Biden 
win. Whether Trump knows that his major 
premise is all lies (which would make him a 
calculating criminal) or doesn’t know that 
his positions are all lies (making him de-
ranged) is almost irrelevant. In either case, 
calculating or deranged, he is a strangely 
questionable choice for leader of this coun-
try. 
Terrorism is the use of fear (terror) and 
acts of violence to intimidate societies, gov-
ernments or ideologies. Domestic terrorism 
is a form of terrorism in which victims with-
in a country are targeted by a perpetrator 
with the same citizenship’’ as the victims. 
It is worth noting that in the middle of the 
January 6 invasion, the FBI became in-
volved, presumably on the basis of a logical 
conclusion that they were looking at an act 
of domestic terrorism. The FBI’s definition 
of domestic terrorism is ‘‘violent, criminal 
acts committed by individuals and/or groups 
to further ideological goals stemming from 
domestic influences, such as those of a polit-
ical, religious, social, racial or environ-
mental nature.’’ 
It is clear that the invasion of the Capitol 
building involved criminal activity. It is 
equally clear that if the criminals are to be 
identified and tried for their crimes, as has 
been clearly stated by all the government 
elements involved, it will be the FBI that 
will lead the way. They are, after all, the 
premier law enforcement organization in the 
United States. As such, they are most likely 
to be the only organization capable of resolv-
ing the many complicated issues involved in 
this crime, most emphatically including the 
issue of domestic terrorism, its initiators, 
motivators and perpetrators.

THE POWER OF HUMAN CHOICES 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, amid the 
chaos of the last 4 years, it is almost 
difficult to parse out the particular 
challenge that was 2020. Faced with 
deadly pandemic wrought by COVID–19 
and the ensuing economic crisis, mil-
lions of Americans lost their jobs and 
found themselves in a newfound state 
of uncertainty and instability. Hun-
dreds of thousands of Americans have 
died from the pandemic, and millions 
have been infected. Meanwhile, fami-
lies across the country have lost their 
homes and businesses due to worsening 
hurricanes, 
floods, 
and 
wildfires 
brought on by intensifying climate 
change. And there are socioeconomic 
challenges, too, that linger and grow 
due to inequality, political division, 
and racial injustice, all things that 
have defined the last year. 
George Will poignantly wrote on Jan-
uary 1 in the Washington Post about 
the challenges we faced throughout the 
past year and will continue to face 
moving forward. In his piece, Mr. Will 
highlights a greater overarching chal-
lenge as well: that we, as humans, do 
not have all encompassing control over 
our circumstances. There are greater 
forces in play; yet our choices and deci-
sions can dictate to some degree the 
impact of those forces. 
As we begin our work in the 117th 
Congress, I hope we can come together 
to better equip our families, commu-
nities, and society to respond to our 
current challenges and prepare our 
country to effectively combat similar 
challenges in the future. 
I ask unanimous consent that Mr. 
Will’s column, ‘‘2020 was a booster shot 
against human hubris,’’ be printed in 
the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S128 
January 25, 2021 
[From the Washington Post, Jan. 1, 2021] 
2020 WAS A BOOSTER SHOT AGAINST HUMAN 
HUBRIS 
(By George Will) 
The plague year 2020 was yet another bru-
tal rejoinder to the belief that brute forces 
can be pushed to the margins of, and eventu-
ally out of, humanity’s experience. When to-
day’s pandemic recedes, what should linger 
is a quickened appreciation of the fragility 
of life and social arrangements. And an 
awareness that things much worse than 
covid–19 have happened before, and will con-
tinue to happen. The human story is not en-
tirely about human choices. 
The 1918–19 ‘‘Spanish flu,’’ which began in 
Kansas, killed between 50 million and 100 
million people worldwide, lowered U.S. life 
expectancy by 12 years, and did not spare, as 
covid–19 largely does, the young. The Black 
Death—the bubonic plague—of 1346–1353 was 
much worse, killing 10 percent of the world’s 
population, and more than one-third of Eu-
rope’s, including 40,000 of London’s 70,000 
residents. 
In the 1980s, AIDS was so shocking because 
it refuted the complacent belief that infec-
tious disease epidemics had been banished. 
In 2019, however, 1.7 million people were 
newly infected with the AIDS virus, and 
690,000 people who were already infected died. 
But of the 38 million living with the virus, 
25.4 
million 
were 
controlling 
it 
with 
antiviral drugs. 
Astronomy lowered mankind’s self-esteem 
(we are not the center of the universe), then 
biology 
did 
(our 
species 
has 
an 
undistinguished pedigree). Geology, too, has 
disturbed our sense of mastery. Genesis en-
joins us to ‘‘subdue’’ the Earth, but this 
slowly cooling residue of the Big Bang gets a 
vote. As its continents wander—half an inch 
to four inches a year, according to plate tec-
tonics—the planet’s interior of boiling gas 
and molten rock occasionally is heard from. 
Volcanic eruptions at what is now Yellow-
stone National Park some 630,000 years ago 
covered half of what is now the continental 
United States with ash. When the Indonesian 
volcano Krakatoa erupted in 1883, sea surges, 
which killed most of the eruption’s eventual 
36,000 victims, were felt in the English Chan-
nel. Krakatoa, was, however, only one-tenth 
as powerful as the April 1815 eruption of In-
donesia’s Mount Tambora, which killed 
10,000 instantly—incandescent ash flowed 100 
miles per hour—and generated winds that 
uprooted trees. Particulate matter blocking 
the sun’s rays cooled the Earth: Water froze 
in some American cisterns on July 4. Today, 
a large majority of the one-eighth of the na-
tion’s population that lives in California re-
sides near the San Andreas fault, and the 
question is not if but when it will lurch cata-
strophically. 
A U.S. satellite poised between Earth and 
the sun can provide perhaps a 45-minute 
warning if the sun is going to plunge the 
planet into darkness. On Sept. 2, 1859, before 
there were light bulbs, a coronal mass ejec-
tion (CME) of 100 million tons of charged 
particles thrown off by the sun only pro-
duced 
spectacular 
sunsets. 
If—actually, 
when—it happens again, it can produce chaos 
in our thoroughly electrified, digitized world 
by induced electric currents: no functioning 
satellites, telephonic communications, water 
pumps, financial transactions, hospitals. No 
Netflix. That got your attention. 
On March 13, 1989, a CME solar storm 
turned out the lights in the entire Canadian 
province of Quebec. Three days earlier, a 
NASA astronomer says, scientists had no-
ticed ‘‘a powerful explosion on the sun. With-
in minutes, tangled magnetic forces on the 
sun had released a billion-ton cloud of gas. It 
was like the energy of thousands of nuclear 
bombs exploding at the same time. The 
storm cloud rushed out from the sun, 
straight towards Earth, at 1 million miles an 
hour.’’ This geomagnetic storm struck the 
Earth the evening of March 12, creating 
‘‘electrical currents in the ground beneath 
much of North America,’’ crashing Quebec’s 
power grid. 
There are those who believe in a benevo-
lent God because Earth, as they see it, is 
‘‘biophilic,’’ meaning friendly to life. They 
must, however, reckon not only with non- 
biophilic things (saber-toothed tigers, volca-
noes, typhoons, viruses, etc.), but also with 
the fact that this (meaning: everything) is 
not going to end well. The universe will ei-
ther continue to expand, ending in life-extin-
guishing cold, or will collapse into incin-
erating heat. 
Meanwhile, here is some (sort of) good 
news, from the Economist. In history’s 
bloodiest century, the last one, 100 million to 
200 million people died as a result of war. 
Measles killed in the same range, influenza 
near the top of the range. Smallpox, how-
ever, killed 300 million to 500 million. 
The eradication of smallpox, by globally 
coordinated vaccination campaigns, ‘‘stands 
as one of the all-time-great humanitarian 
triumphs.’’ 
Human choices cannot subdue all the brute 
forces that always lurk. Choices can, how-
ever, make a difference. And they can dig-
nify us, a thinking, coping species. 
f 
NOMINATION OF ANTONY JOHN 
BLINKEN 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, 
I rise to speak in support of Tony 
Blinken’s nomination to be Secretary 
of State. 
I support Tony for Secretary of State 
for three key reasons. First, he has the 
diplomatic skills that our country 
needs at this pivotal moment to regain 
our leadership on the world stage. 
From 2015 to 2017, he served as Deputy 
Secretary of State, the Nation’s second 
highest ranking diplomat. In that posi-
tion, he helped lead U.S. efforts to 
combat terrorism, address rising con-
cerns in Asia, and respond to Russian 
regional aggression. He is a crisis-test-
ed leader who will hit the ground run-
ning at the State Department with 
critical knowledge and relationships 
with leaders worldwide. 
Second, Tony has a longstanding and 
trusted 
personal 
relationship 
with 
President Biden that will enable him to 
advise the President on key foreign 
policy 
issues. 
During 
President 
Obama’s first term in office, he was Na-
tional Security Advisor to then-Vice 
President 
Biden. 
Previously, 
Tony 
served as the Democratic staff director 
for the Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee for 6 years when then-Senator 
Biden was committee chairman. It is 
because of his relationship with Presi-
dent Biden and his career as a public 
servant that Tony understands that 
the job of Secretary of State is not just 
to serve the American people, but to 
help improve the lives of people strug-
gling all over the world. 
Last but certainly not least, Tony 
has the experience of serving at the 
State Department that will help him 
rebuild 
the 
Department, 
recruiting 
needed Foreign Service Officers and ci-
vilians, ensuring State personnel have 
the training they need to be effective 
in their mission, restoring morale 
throughout the Department, and em-
powering our diplomats to speak on be-
half of him and President Biden. 
Tony will help our country repair the 
damage of the last 4 years and restore 
the United States as a leader and trust-
ed ally. I look forward to working with 
him to advance our mutual objectives 
of promoting peace and security, and I 
urge my colleagues to vote in favor of 
his confirmation. 
Thank you. 
f 
CONFIRMATION OF LLOYD JAMES 
AUSTIN 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam President, I was 
proud to vote in support of Lloyd Austin to 
serve as our next Secretary of Defense. I cast 
my vote with confidence that he will capably 
lead the Department of Defense through this 
difficult period in our Nation’s history. 
As a four-star general, Lloyd Austin was 
tasked with leading the drawdown of American 
troops from Iraq and helped bring 150,000 
U.S. soldiers home. He demonstrated the 
logistical mastery that will be necessary to 
help lead the nationwide effort to vaccinate 
against COVID–19. Through his remarkable 
life and trailblazing career, he has gained the 
experience and perspective required of this of-
fice, and now, he has broken one more barrier 
as the first African-American Secretary of De-
fense in our Nation’s history. I am confident he 
will ensure that our Armed Forces reflect and 
respect the diversity of our Nation and that ev-
eryone in our military upholds the oath they 
take to protect our Constitution. 
I have made no secret of my concerns 
about the troubling trend of Congress granting 
waivers to allow recently retired officers to 
serve as Secretary of Defense, and I voted 
against such a waiver for Lloyd Austin as I did 
when that question was previously put before 
the Congress. Nevertheless, I believe once 
Congress speaks on the issue of a waiver, 
each Senator must evaluate the nominee on 
his or her merits alone. By that measure, 
Lloyd Austin is superbly qualified. He has the 
confidence of the President and is the right 
person for this moment. I support his con-
firmation.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING BARBARA 
HARDCASTLE 
∑ Mr. BOOZMAN. Madman President, I 
rise today to honor the life of Mrs. Bar-
bara Hardcastle, who passed away on 
January 13, 2020, at the age of 94. 
Mrs. Hardcastle was trailblazer and a 
fierce advocate for her community and 
her State. A native of Fort Smith, AK, 
she also made her mark in politics and 
government in California. I was hon-
ored to know her, and so I join her 
friends and family in grieving her loss. 
Barbara Turner was born in Fort 
Smith on April 6, 1927. She graduated 
from Fort Smith High School in 1944 
and went on to earn a bachelor’s degree 
from Fort Smith Junior College. She

married Ben Hardcastle, a banker and 
World War II veteran, in 1947, and they 
would spend almost 63 years together 
before his passing in 2010. 
Early in their married life, Ben ac-
cepted a job at the Beverly Hills Sav-
ings and Loan, so they moved to North 
Hollywood, CA. They immediately be-
came active in their local church and, 
as a result, made friends with many 
Hollywood actors, including Ronald 
and Nancy Reagan. 
Their friendship with the Reagans led 
to Barbara’s involvement in California 
politics, including playing a key role in 
his race for Governor of California. She 
is also credited by many as having in-
troduced the future President to Jelly 
Belly candy as he attempted to stop 
smoking. Friends and family say she 
kept him stocked with the company’s 
signature jelly beans throughout his 
Presidency. 
During their time in California, Bar-
bara became an ordained minister and 
public speaker. She was also a trail-
blazing professional, serving as a super-
visor and one of the first female execu-
tives with the Federal housing agency, 
Fannie Mae. 
Ben and Barbara decided to retire in 
1991 and returned to Arkansas, where 
they continued to be active in local, 
State and national politics. In addition 
to helping candidates for all levels of 
public office, Barbara used her experi-
ence to make a difference in the com-
munity. 
I had many opportunities to work 
with Barbara over the years, but no oc-
casion stands out more than her deter-
mined efforts on behalf of the 188th 
Fighter Wing when its future was 
threatened by the Base Realignment 
and Closure Commission, BRAC. She 
used her organizing skills to rally the 
community and show visiting BRAC 
committee members how strong sup-
port was for the base. Her leadership 
and industry helped save the Wing and 
bring more opportunity to the region. 
Barbara was truly a force. Her strong 
values, hard work, wonderful sense of 
humor and personal conviction made a 
difference. I am grateful to have count-
ed her as a friend and hope her legacy 
will continue to inspire young Arkan-
sans to fight for their communities and 
their causes with the same determina-
tion that she did throughout her life.∑

REMEMBERING GARY SPEARS 
∑ Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, I 
rise today to honor the life of an out-
standing 
Arkansan 
and 
Cleveland 
County leader, Judge Gary Spears. 
After a multiyear battle with cancer, 
Judge Spears passed away on January 
10, 2021. 
Judge Spears grew up on a small 
farm in New Edinburg, AR, and grad-
uated with honors from New Edinburg 
High School in 1987. He attended the 
University of Arkansas at Monticello, 
where he studied agricultural business 
before marrying his wife Melody. The 
couple moved to Warren, AR, where 
Judge Spears worked as a distributor 
for Big R Ice. The couple eventually re-
turned to New Edinburg in 1996 and 
purchased the New Edinburg County 
Store, which they operated together 
for 10 years. 
In 2007, Judge Spears was elected 
Cleveland County Judge, marking the 
start of an illustrious 14-year career as 
the longest serving county judge in 
county history. His undeniable leader-
ship while presiding over Cleveland 
County had ripple effects that extended 
beyond the county borders and brought 
tremendous benefit to the entire State. 
A few recent and notable achievements 
during his tenure include successful ef-
forts to ensure an accurate 2020 census 
count for Cleveland County and di-
rectly overseeing the county’s finances 
during the COVID–19 pandemic by au-
thorizing and approving the disburse-
ment of funds. 
Representing the citizens of Cleve-
land County was a clear passion for 
Judge Spears. He was also dedicated to 
farming. On the exact 10-acre plot that 
his father once farmed, Judge Spears 
worked diligently to continue his fam-
ily’s unique tradition of ‘‘truck-patch 
farming.’’ He grew various crops, in-
cluding tomatoes, beans, peas, squash, 
cucumbers, watermelons, peppers, and 
much more. In fact, his family’s agri-
culture operation gained deserved rec-
ognition in 2019 when they were named 
Cleveland County Farm Family of the 
Year. 
Judge Spears leaves behind a lasting 
legacy thanks to the confidence en-
trusted in him by his Cleveland County 
constituents. I am confident his self-
less leadership as a Cleveland County 
judge, businessman, and family farmer 
will guide and inspire future genera-
tions of Arkansans.∑

TRIBUTE TO GARLAND 
SHEPHEARD 
∑ Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, I rise 
today 
to 
pay 
tribute 
to 
Garland 
Shepheard, who retired as the North 
Carolina House sergeant-in-arms at the 
beginning of the year. Mr. Shepheard is 
a proud North Carolinian who was com-
mitted to keeping North Carolina leg-
islators safe. 
Garland Shepheard is a lifelong resi-
dent of Tarboro, NC, where he resides 
with his wife Betty Jo. Mr. Shepheard 
was successful car salesman and addi-
tionally served as Edgecombe County 
Republican Party chairman. He also 
served two terms on the Tarboro Town 
Council and has contributed a lifetime 
of service to his community. 
Before representing North Carolina 
in the U.S. Senate, I had the pleasure 
of interacting with Mr. Shepheard serv-
ing as North Carolina speaker of the 
house. Widely known for his brightly 
colored jackets and distinct Eastern 
North Carolina accent, Garland was 
loved by members from both sides of 
the aisle. 
As the U.S. Senator from North Caro-
lina, I am grateful for Garland’s service 
to our State and Nation. I hope he en-
joys 
his 
much-deserved 
retirement 
back in Eastern North Carolina, and we 
will never forget his commitment to 
keeping North Carolinians safe.∑

MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE 
At 7:12 p.m., a message from the 
House of Representatives, delivered by 
Mr. RASKIN (manager on the part of the 
House in the matter of impeachment of 
Donald John Trump), announced that 
the House has agreed to the following 
resolution: 
H. RES. 24 
Resolved, That Donald John Trump, Presi-
dent of the United States, is impeached for 
high crimes and misdemeanors and that the 
following article of impeachment be exhib-
ited to the United States Senate: 
Article of impeachment exhibited by the 
House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in the name of itself and 
of the people of the United States of Amer-
ica, against Donald John Trump, President 
of the United States of America, in mainte-
nance and support of its impeachment 
against him for high crimes and mis-
demeanors. 
ARTICLE I: INCITEMENT OF INSURRECTION 
The Constitution provides that the House 
of Representatives ‘‘shall have the sole 
Power of Impeachment’’ and that the Presi-
dent ‘‘shall be removed from Office on Im-
peachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, 
Bribery, or other high Crimes and Mis-
demeanors’’. Further, section 3 of the 14th 
Amendment to the Constitution prohibits 
any person who has ‘‘engaged in insurrection 
or rebellion against’’ the United States from 
‘‘hold[ing] any office . . . under the United 
States’’. In his conduct while President of 
the United States—and in violation of his 
constitutional oath faithfully to execute the 
office of President of the United States and, 
to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, 
and defend the Constitution of the United 
States, and in violation of his constitutional 
duty to take care that the laws be faithfully 
executed—Donald John Trump engaged in 
high Crimes and Misdemeanors by inciting 
violence against the Government of the 
United States, in that: 
On January 6, 2021, pursuant to the 12th 
Amendment to the Constitution of the 
United States, the Vice President of the 
United States, the House of Representatives, 
and the Senate met at the United States 
Capitol for a Joint Session of Congress to 
count the votes of the Electoral College. In 
the months preceding the Joint Session, 
President Trump repeatedly issued false 
statements asserting that the Presidential 
election results were the product of wide-
spread fraud and should not be accepted by

January 25, 2021 
the American people or certified by State or 
Federal officials. Shortly before the Joint 
Session commenced, President Trump, ad-
dressed a crowd at the Ellipse in Wash-
ington, DC. There, he reiterated false claims 
that ‘‘we won this election, and we won it by 
a landslide’’. He also willfully made state-
ments that, in context, encouraged—and 
foreseeably resulted in—lawless action at the 
Capitol, such as: ‘‘if you don’t fight like hell 
you’re not going to have a country any-
more’’. Thus incited by President Trump, 
members of the crowd he had addressed, in 
an attempt to, among other objectives, 
interfere with the Joint Session’s solemn 
constitutional duty to certify the results of 
the 2020 Presidential election, unlawfully 
breached and vandalized the Capitol, injured 
and killed law enforcement personnel, men-
aced Members of Congress, the Vice Presi-
dent, and Congressional personnel, and en-
gaged in other violent, deadly, destructive, 
and seditious acts. 
President Trump’s conduct on January 6, 
2021, followed his prior efforts to subvert and 
obstruct the certification of the results of 
the 2020 Presidential election. Those prior ef-
forts included a phone call on January 2, 
2021, during which President Trump urged 
the secretary of state of Georgia, Brad 
Raffensperger, to ‘‘find’’ enough votes to 
overturn the Georgia Presidential election 
results 
and 
threatened 
Secretary 
Raffensperger if he failed to do so. 
In all this, President Trump gravely en-
dangered the security of the United States 
and its institutions of Government. He 
threatened the integrity of the democratic 
system, interfered with the peaceful transi-
tion of power, and imperiled a coequal 
branch of Government. He thereby betrayed 
his trust as President, to the manifest injury 
of the people of the United States. 
Wherefore, Donald John Trump, by such 
conduct, has demonstrated that he will re-
main a threat to national security, democ-
racy, and the Constitution if allowed to re-
main in office, and has acted in a manner 
grossly incompatible with self-governance 
and the rule of law. Donald John Trump thus 
warrants impeachment and trial, removal 
from office, and disqualification to hold and 
enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit 
under the United States. 
The message also announced that the

MEMORANDUM 
REGARDING 
AU-
THORIZATION OF THE DEPART-
MENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY 
HON. NANCY PELOSI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 25, 2021 
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, I submit the 
following memorandum regarding authorization 
of the Department of Homeland Security: 
We, the chairs of the committees with ju-
risdiction over the Department of Homeland 
Security or its components, are hereby re-
cording our agreement on the following prin-
ciples for the 117th Congress: 
1. The Department of Homeland Security 
(‘‘the Department’’) and its components 
should be authorized on a regular basis to 
ensure robust oversight and improve its op-
eration. 
2. Committees with jurisdiction over the 
Department 
and 
its 
components 
will 
prioritize any expired or expiring authoriza-
tions within the Department and its compo-
nents in that committee’s jurisdiction. 
3. To the maximum extent practicable, the 
committees with jurisdiction over compo-
nents of the Department will coordinate 
with the Committee on Homeland Security 
to produce comprehensive authorization leg-
islation for the Department and consult with 
the Committee on Homeland Security prior 
to consideration of component authorization 
legislation in a committee markup. Prior to 
consideration of component authorization 
legislation in a committee markup, the Com-
mittee on Homeland Security will consult 
with any other committee that is a party to 
this agreement that is a committee with ju-
risdiction over that component. 
4. The Committee on Homeland Security 
will coordinate with the committees with ju-
risdiction over components of the Depart-
ment in the development of any comprehen-
sive authorization bill for the Department. 
5. The committees will work in good faith 
to expeditiously consider any bill to com-
prehensively authorize the Department, in-
cluding timely resolution of any matters 
subject to a sequential or additional referral. 
6. To the extent that there are policy dif-
ferences between the committees regarding a 
provision of a bill or comprehensive author-
ization bill for the Department, the commit-
tees will make best efforts to resolve any 
such dispute and where the Committee on 
Homeland Security has policy differences re-
garding a measure to be advanced by another 
committee that is a party to this agreement, 
the Committee on Homeland Security will 
make best efforts to achieve a timely resolu-
tion of such dispute. 
7. Consistent with existing rules and prece-
dents of the House, the Committee on Home-
land Security Committee shall not include 
any provision in a bill that the chair of the 
Committee on Ways and Means has deter-
mined to be a revenue provision or a provi-
sion affecting revenue. Nothing in this agree-
ment shall be construed to preclude the 
Committee on Ways and Means from exer-
cising an additional or sequential referral 
over any measure or to waive clause 5(a) of 
Rule XXI of the Rules of the House of Rep-
resentatives . 
8. Nothing in this agreement shall be con-
strued as altering or expanding any commit-
tee’s jurisdiction under rule X of the Rules of 
the House of Representatives or the referral 
of any measure thereunder and will not be 
construed as support for any claim for se-
quential referral on legislation pertaining to 
the Department generally, including poli-
cies, programs, and general management of 
component agencies. 
9. Further, nothing in this agreement shall 
be construed to affect the provision of infor-
mation by the Executive Branch to commit-
tees of jurisdiction pursuant to law or other-
wise. 
10. Further, nothing in this agreement 
shall be construed as altering any respon-
sibilities or authority of any committee 
under Rule XI of the House of Representa-
tives. 
11. Further, nothing in this agreement pre-
cludes a further agreement between the com-
mittees with regard to the implementation 
of a process to collaborate on comprehensive 
authorization legislation and component- 
specific measures. 
12. Consistent with past practice, commit-
tees that are party to this agreement will 
consult with the Committee on Oversight 
and Reform when statutes under its Rule X 
jurisdiction are implicated by comprehensive 
reauthorization legislation.

WELCOMING THE BIDEN 
ADMINISTRATION 
HON. HALEY M. STEVENS 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 25, 2021 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in celebration of the newly inaugurated 
Biden Administration. 
I have every confidence that my friend, and 
a good man, President Joseph R. Biden, will 
serve as the head of state that this weighty 
moment 
deserves. 
With 
Vice 
President 
Kamala Harris by his side, America will heal, 
America will innovate, and America will lead. 
My partnership with President Biden began 
on the campaign trail in 2008, and it continued 
to the U.S. Auto Rescue Task Force, where 
he showed every day his care for the needs 
of hardworking Michigan families and our 
manufacturing economy. I am ready to work 
alongside the Biden Administration and my 
colleagues in Congress to defeat the COVID– 
19 pandemic, get our economy back on track, 
and help Michiganders get back on their feet. 
I ask my colleagues in the U.S. House of 
Representatives to join me in congratulating 
the new Administration and welcoming the first 
family to the White House. 
Now, we begin a new chapter in American 
history—one of innovative, collaborative, and 
forward-thinking leadership to strengthen our 
nation for generations to come. 
We will build a future for our children that is 
guided by truth and science, energized by the 
will of the people, and fortified by love for our 
resilient republic. May we be successful in this 
endeavor, and may we never lose faith in 
America’s promise.

Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor an extraordinary 
South Carolinian, Ms. Treva Green of Conway 
and wish her a happy 100th birthday. 
Ms. Green was 18 years old when she vol-
unteered to become a nurse with the U.S 
Army. She served our nation in England, 
France, and Germany during World War II. 
Following the war, Treva and her husband 
moved to Conway and served the Grand 
Strand community as a nurse for over four 
decades. Wow. 
Her commitment to her nation and commu-
nity are truly admirable. She is a shining ex-
ample of the best of our country. Ms. Green 
is now enjoying retirement in Conway. Treva 
recently said ‘‘I’ve done everything the Lord 
wants me to do, or at least I tried to and 
asked for forgiveness for everything I couldn’t

REMARKS 
ON 
TERRI 
FREEMAN 
LEAVING THE NATIONAL CIVIL 
RIGHTS MUSEUM 
HON. STEVE COHEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 25, 2021 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to bid a reluctant farewell to Terri Lee Free-
man, who for the past six years has served as 
President of the National Civil Rights Museum 
in Memphis. Ms. Freeman has done an excep-
tional job leading the nation’s premiere Civil 
Rights museum, located in the Lorraine Motel 
where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assas-
sinated in 1968. During her tenure, Ms. Free-
man organized the 50th anniversary of that 
seminal event in American history—‘‘MLK50— 
Where Do We Go From Here?’’—featuring 
such national figures as our late Congres-
sional colleague, John Lewis; the Reverend 
Jesse Jackson, former Polish President and 
1983 Nobel Peace Prize laureate Lech 
Walesa; the Reverend William Barber of the 
Poor People’s Campaign, and many others 
who traveled from around the world to spend 
time in our showcase institution. In her six 
years, she saw the museum’s budget double 
to $9.7 million while overseeing a staff of 50 
and an increased physical footprint. She also 
helped affiliate the museum with the Smithso-
nian Institution and its traveling exhibits. Also 
while at the museum, she began ‘‘Unpacking 
Racism in Action,’’ a series of community dia-
logues aimed at confronting implicit and struc-
tural bias. Last year, she was named ‘‘Mem-
phian of the Year’’ by Memphis Magazine. Be-
fore moving to Memphis, she was president of 
what is now the Greater Washington Commu-
nity Foundation. In her 18 years with that or-
ganization, she increased the organization’s 
assets from $52 million in 1996 to more than 
$350 million in 2014. A proven leader, Ms. 
Freeman was a 2016 graduate of Leadership 
Memphis and served on the boards of the 
Community Foundation of Greater Memphis, 
the New Memphis Institute and the Memphis 
Convention and Visitors Bureau, as well as 
being a member of the Tennessee Edu-
cational Equity Coalition Steering Committee. 
Born in Chicago, Ms. Freeman is a graduate 
of Hamtramck High School (1977) and the 
University of Dayton (1981 through 1983) and 
received a Master’s degree in organizational 
communications from Howard University. Ms. 
Freeman is married to Dr. Bowyer G. Free-
man, senior pastor of the New Saint Mark 
Baptist Church in Baltimore, and the mother of 
three grown daughters. I wish Ms. Freeman 
every success in her new post as executive 
director of the Reginald Lewis Museum of Afri-
can American History and Culture in Balti-
more. I’m pleased to read that Ms. Freeman 
will always consider herself an ‘‘adopted child’’ 
of our city where her work and dedication will 
remain her lasting legacy. 
PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
HON. DOUG LAMBORN 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 25, 2021 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I had in-
tended to vote ‘‘Yea’’ on Roll Call No. 18. 
f 
SUPPORTING H.R. 335, THE LEGAL 
EXCEPTION NECESSARY TO AP-
POINT LLOYD J. AUSTIN III AS 
PRESIDENT BIDEN’S SECRETARY 
OF DEFENSE 
HON. PETER A. DeFAZIO 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 25, 2021 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, on January 
21, I voted in support of H.R. 335, legislation 
to provide a waiver for former General Lloyd 
J. Austin III to serve as President Biden’s Sec-
retary of Defense. The Senate confirmed Aus-
tin as Secretary of Defense on January 22. 
Civilian 
control 
of 
the 
military 
is 
a 
foundational tenet of our constitutional democ-
racy, and I fully support all efforts to maintain 
and reinforce this essential principle. 
Federal law requires that any Secretary of 
Defense nominee who has served in the mili-
tary must be retired from the military for at 
least seven years, unless Congress grants a 
waiver. Until Congress granted a waiver for 
President Trump’s nominee for Secretary of 
Defense, former General Jim Mattis, in 2017, 
a waiver of this kind had only occurred one 
other time: for former General George Mar-
shall in 1950. 
I believe this seven-year ‘‘cooling off’’ period 
for former military officials is an important 
mechanism to ensure continued civilian control 
of the U.S. military, and I believe Congress 
should not make a habit of granting these 
waivers. 
However, I am confident that Secretary Aus-
tin is committed to upholding civilian control of 
the military. As he indicated in his Senate con-
firmation testimony on January 19, Austin be-
lieves that ‘‘the safety and security of our de-
mocracy demands competent civilian control 
of our Armed Forces, the subordination of mili-
tary power to the civil. I know that being a 
member of the president’s Cabinet—a political 
appointee—requires a different perspective 
and unique duties from a career in uniform.’’ 
I am also encouraged by Secretary Austin’s 
statements of belief in military restraint, rather 
than interventionism, as well as aspects of his 
service under the Obama administration, in-
cluding overseeing the withdrawal of 150,000 
U.S. troops from Iraq, his opposition to a U.S. 
war and regime change in Syria, his dedica-
tion to diplomacy, and his support for avoiding 
civilian casualties. 
Austin is also the first Black Secretary of 
Defense in U.S. history. While there is still a 
significant lack of diversity in the top ranks of 
the military, Austin’s appointment is an impor-
tant step in the right direction. 
It is also notable that Austin will lead the 
Pentagon during a time when white suprem-
acy and ideological extremism are on the rise 
among military ranks. In his January 19 Sen-
ate confirmation hearing, Austin pledged to 
‘‘fight hard to stamp out sexual assault, to rid 
our ranks of racists and extremists, and to cre-
ate a climate where everyone fit and willing 
has the opportunity to serve this country with 
dignity.’’ 
Civilian control of the military is not only 
achieved via the Secretary of Defense. Unlike 
President Trump, who appointed former gen-
erals to serve in numerous civilian and na-
tional security roles in the White House, Presi-
dent Biden has demonstrated a clear commit-
ment to civilian control of the military by ap-
pointing non-military civilians in key national 
security posts. 
While I support Congress’s waiver for Sec-
retary Austin, I strongly encourage the Biden 
administration and future administrations to 
avoid appointing additional former military offi-
cials as Secretary of Defense if they have not 
completed their seven-year cooling off period. 
I also will not hesitate to criticize Secretary 
Austin and the Biden administration—as I 
have done with previous Republican and 
Democratic administrations—when I disagree 
with their policies and actions. It is essential 
we rein in our bloated and wasteful defense 
spending, tackle the massive waste, fraud, 
and abuse within the Pentagon, and that Con-
gress reassert its Constitutional war powers 
and put an end to our endless wars.

INTRODUCTION OF THE BUILDING 
UNITED 
STATES 
INFRASTRUC-
TURE AND LEVERAGING DEVEL-
OPMENT (BUILD) ACT 
HON. EARL BLUMENAUER 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 25, 2021 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, today 
I introduced the Building United States Infra-
structure 
and 
Leveraging 
Development 
(BUILD) Act. This bipartisan legislation will 
spur billions of dollars in private investment to-
ward surface transportation and freight trans-
fer facilities, while giving state and local gov-
ernments an important instrument to improve 
their communities. 
It is no secret that America’s infrastructure 
is falling apart while we fall behind our global 
competitors. America’s roads, bridges, tunnels, 
and transit systems face a funding gap of 
more than $1.1 trillion by 2025. One in five 
miles of highway pavement is in poor condi-
tion and congestion costs the U.S. economy 
nearly $305 billion annually. Continued under-
investment will lead to longer trips to work or 
school, more costly maintenance expenses, 
and unsafe road conditions. We must do bet-
ter. 
As of December 1, 2020, the Department of 
Transportation doesn’t have any additional 
surface transportation private activity bonds 
available, as the entire $15 billion statutory 
cap has been issued or allocated. This legisla-
tion builds on the success of these bonds by 
doubling the federal volume cap and clarifying 
that the use of the bonds must maintain strong 
labor standards. While public-private partner-
ships are not a panacea for solving all of our 
transportation challenges, they are an impor-
tant piece of rebuilding and renewing America. 
I look forward to working with my colleagues 
in the House and Senate to enact this legisla-
tion as part of an infrastructure investment bill.

PASSING 
THROUGH 
THE 
FIERY 
TRIALS 
OF 
DEMOCRACY 
TO 
SAVE AND RENEW OUR REPUB-
LIC 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 25, 2021 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as a 
senior member of the Committees on the Judi-
ciary and on Homeland Security, as the de-
scendant of patriotic and heroic veterans who 
risked their lives to defend our nation and our 
freedoms, as a parent with the fervent hope 
and determination to pass on this great de-
mocracy to the next generation, and as a cit-
izen of the greatest republic in world history, 
I rise to reflect on the state of our democracy 
as it is about to open a new chapter in the re-
markable story of America. 
In 1776, the Framers declared the self-evi-
dent and later the universal truth that all per-
sons are created equal and endowed by their 
Creator with the inalienable rights of life, lib-
erty, and the pursuit of happiness. As impor-
tant, the Framers declared that ‘‘to secure 
these 
rights, 
governments 
are 
instituted 
among men, deriving their just power from the 
consent of the governed.’’ This genius of self- 
government is the Framers’ gift to us and 
America’s gift to the world, and for nearly 250 
years the world has looked upon the United 
States with wonder, awe, and envy not just for 
its awesome powers and achievements, but 
for being the exemplar to which most freedom- 
loving nations aspire. 
But as President Lincoln reminded us at 
Gettysburg, the proposition that a people can 
govern themselves is not to be taken for 
granted; it is a proposition that will be tested 
time and again and it for us, the living, to high-
ly resolve to commit ourselves to the great 
task always before us, that government of the 
people, by the people, and for the people not 
perish from the earth. 
As Thomas Paine said in his time, the past 
four years were times that tried one’s soul. 
The nation was tested, severely so, by what 
can only be described as the modern-day 
Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse: a deadly 
pandemic, economic devastation unseen since 
the Great Depression, social justice unrest, 
and the very real threat of authoritarianism. 
While the threat posed by these challenges 
are still with us to varying extent, we can all 
rejoice that the nation withstood the challenge, 
e pluribus unum, by standing together as ‘‘We 
The People.’’ President Lincoln reminded us 
that in times of testing and challenge that ‘‘the 
fiery trial through which we pass will mark us 
down in honor or dishonor until the latest gen-
eration’’ but that so long as the people ‘‘retain 
their virtue and vigilance, no administration, by 
any extreme of wickedness or folly, can very 
seriously injure the government in the short 
space of four years.’’ 
And Lincoln was right, for on Election Day 
2020, Americans by a substantial majority, 
voted to withhold consent to govern from an 
incumbent administration and confer it upon 
another. That act of self-government and sov-
ereign expression was solemnized on January 
20, 2021, at noon when Joseph R. Biden and 
KAMALA D. HARRIS took the oath of office as 
the 46th President and 49th Vice-President of 
the United States. 
The Philadelphia Miracle of 1789 endures 
but only because we Americans resolve that it 
does and work to make it so. The President 
takes the oath of office pledging to preserve, 
protect, and defend the Constitution. As does 
every one of my congressional colleagues, I 
have sacredly pledged true faith and alle-
giance in defending the Constitution against all 
enemies, foreign and domestic and to well and 
faithfully execute the duties of the office I hold. 
I do this ever mindful that the purpose of our 
form of government is ‘‘to form a more perfect 
union, to establish justice, to insure domestic 
tranquility, to provide for the common defense, 
to promote the general welfare, and to secure 
the blessings of liberty for posterity.’’ 
But we all have a responsibility to preserve 
and strengthen this constitutional republic and 
pass it on to the next generation by engaging 
in robust, lawful, and peaceful civic activity to 
hold our government to account and to peace-
ably assemble when necessary to petition for 
a redress of grievances as shown by the Rev. 
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. at the March on 
Washington, following the example of Ma-
hatma Gandhi; by John Lewis and the Civil 
Rights foot soldiers at the Edmund Pettus 
Bridge in Selma, Alabama; by Elizabeth Cady 
Staton and Lucretia Mott at Seneca Falls; by 
Cesar Chavez leading the fight for human dig-
nity of farmworkers, and by Black Lives Matter 
demonstrators protesting inequalities in the 
criminal justice system. For the work of de-
mocracy is never complete, our union is al-
ways in the process of being made more per-
fect. 
Americans have suffered, endured, and sur-
vived much pain and heartbreak over the past 
four years. But Psalms 30:5 teaches that 
‘‘weeping lasteth for a night, but joy cometh in 
the morning.’’ So, let us all be of good cheer, 
for tomorrow, at the end of morning, a new 
day dawns in America with the inauguration of 
President Biden and Vice-President HARRIS 
and our collective journey towards the beloved 
community continues inexorably forward.

REMEMBERING KEITH E. 
FREELAND 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 25, 2021 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I would like to include in the Record 
the following obituary for Keith E. Freeland. 
With deep sorrow we pronounce the passing 
of Keith E. Freeland of Lewiston, NY on Fri-
day, January 1, 2021. He passed away peace-
fully at the age of 67. Born in Niagara Falls, 
NY, he was the son of the late Edward C. and 
Norma E. (Klipfel) Freeland. He was raised 
along with his three sisters in Ransomville, 
NY. Keith married Christine A. (Covatta) 
Freeland in Lewiston, NY on October 18, 1975 
and was a devoted and loving husband for 45 
years. 
Keith 
attended 
Lewiston-Porter 
High 
School and graduated from Buffalo State 
College with a degree in business education. 
He ultimately pursued his life-long career in 
manufacturing and sales, founding Package 
Design and Supply in 1995. Viewed as a kind, 
selfless and devoted leader, he demonstrated 
unwavering loyalty and compassion to all of 
his beloved employees and colleagues. 
Keith not only excelled in his career but he 
was devoted to several hobbies. Boating was 
his ultimate passion and anytime the sun 
was shining in the summer you could find 
him at the boat docks in Lewiston or cruis-
ing along the Lower Niagara River. He was 
fervent about the community of friends who 
shared his desire for being on the water; 
often traveling and seeking new adventures 
each summer. Keith was a dedicated board 
member of the Youngstown Yacht Club aid-
ing in annual fundraising events. He also en-
joyed vintage car restoration, proudly dis-
playing vehicles he worked so tirelessly on 
at various local shows. Keith found solace in 
meticulously 
maintaining 
his 
yard 
in 
Thornwood Forest and working diligently on 
various projects around the home he so cher-
ished. He was an avid Buffalo sports fan and 
longtime season ticket holder for his beloved 
Bills and Sabres, for whom he shared in the 
joys and sorrows with his two sons. 
Above all, Keith cared about family and he 
would stop at nothing to be there for them. 
He instilled in them the value of hard work, 
honesty, loyalty and simply to be thankful 
and appreciative. In addition to his wife of 45 
years, Keith is survived by his children, Dr. 
Erik Freeland, Jeffrey Freeland, and Julie 
Freeland; his siblings, Kathy (late Dr. F. 
Craig) Fisher of Chicago, IL and Jane (Greg) 
DiPietro of League City, TX. He was pre-
deceased by his sister, Linda (James) Giar-
dino of Scottsdale, AZ. He is also survived by 
numerous nieces, nephews, and countless 
friends.

IN 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
ROSEMARY 
HEARD, FORMER PRESIDENT OF 
CATCH NEIGHBORHOOD HOUSING 
HON. ANN M. KUSTER 
NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 25, 2021 
Ms. KUSTER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Rosemary Heard’s life, career and 
many years of service as President and Chief 
Executive Officer of CATCH Neighborhood 
Housing. 
As President, Rosemary was responsible for 
the 
administration 
and 
management 
of 
CATCH Neighborhood Housing, an organiza-
tion whose mission is to make sure every per-
son is confident in having a place to call 
home. Rosemary’s ingenuity led to the con-
struction of numerous new affordable housing 
units and revitalized existing housing in areas 
where affordable options are limited. 
Rosemary’s dedication to her community 
and bettering the lives of others did not stop 
at CATCH. She also served on the Municipal 
Housing Commission for the City of Concord, 
the Public Policy Committee for the National 
NeighborWorks Association, the City of Con-
cord’s Plan to End Homelessness, and Con-
cord Hospital’s Board of Trustees. Recognized 
for her professional excellence, Rosemary was 
the recipient of a Greater Concord Chamber of 
Commerce 2019 Business Leader of the Year 
award. 
On behalf of New Hampshire’s Second Con-
gressional District and all those who have 
been impacted by Rosemary’s important work, 
I’d like to thank Rosemary for her commitment 
to and passion for housing security that will 
continue to benefit Granite Staters for years to 
come.

LIMITATION AGAINST APPOINT-

OF 
DEFENSE 
WITHIN 
SEVEN YEARS OF RELIEF FROM 
ACTIVE DUTY 
SPEECH OF 
HON. BILL POSEY 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 21, 2021 
Mr. POSEY. Mr. Speaker, through the Na-
tional Security Act, Congress required that the 
Secretary of Defense be from civilian life and 
placed a limitation on the appointment of 
former military personnel to that position man-
dating that a nominee be retired from military 
service for ten years. In 2008, Congress short-
ened that period to seven years. 
I have several concerns which I would like 
to express and go on record in opposition to 
providing a waiver. First, I thank the General 
for his service to our nation in uniform. I have 
reservations about providing yet another waiv-
er from the law intended to preserve civilian 
leadership in the role of Secretary of Defense. 
If confirmed as Secretary of Defense by the 
U.S. Senate, after fewer than five years from 
his last military assignment, General Lloyd 
Austin (Ret.) will be expected to uphold the 
principles of civilian control of the military. 
My hope is that General Austin’s focus will 
be ensuring that our nation is prepared to 
meet head-on the threat posed by adversaries 
including China, Russia, and Iran. He should 
follow and focus on the bipartisan 2018 Na-
tional Defense Strategy that stresses the need 
to strengthen our military for potential major 
conflict. Mr. Austin should work to preserve 
the strategic nuclear triad, protect and ensure 
American space superiority, and maintain 
Naval supremacy as cornerstones of our free-
dom. 
Serving as our nation’s Secretary of De-
fense is an awesome responsibility and I await 
the U.S. Senate vetting General Austin as the 
U.S. Senate has the responsibility under the 
Constitution of reviewing Presidential nomi-
nees.

IN RECOGNITION OF HER SERVICE: 
MS. JUDITH MITCHELL 
HON. ALAN S. LOWENTHAL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 25, 2021 
Mr. LOWENTHAL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Judith Mitchell and her career 
of public service. 
After 11 years of dedicated public service, 
Ms. Mitchell will be retiring from public service. 
Ms. Mitchell served with honor as Rolling 
Hills Estate Mayor and Council Member for 
her city, Southland, her state and the nation. 
Ms. Mitchell showed her fairness, depth of 
knowledge and dedication to improving the 
quality of life for all. 
During her political career, Ms. Mitchell was 
elected to represent 51 cities in the western 
portion of Los Angeles County which she rep-
resented through the Governing Board of the 
South Coast Air Quality Management District. 
Ms. Mitchell was then appointed to the Cali-
fornia Air Resources Board under Governor 
Edmund J. Brown, and additionally served as 
the President of the League of California Cit-
ies where she chaired several key environ-
mental committees. Her work on these two 
agencies, helped to spur technological innova-
tion to create jobs and economic growth in the 
Southland and across the nation. 
Ms. Mitchell’s legacy for clean air policies 
and her unwavering support for green tech-
nologies has not only helped those most im-
pacted in her community, but these efforts 
have a direct impact on my Congressional 
District. These clean air advancements will 
also assist other States and regions to help 
meet federal public health standards and build 
a foundation for the United States techno-
logical and industrial leadership. 
It is with great pride and gratitude that I ex-
tend my best wishes to Ms. Judith Mitchell 
upon her retirement and ask that my distin-
guished colleagues join me in honoring her.

CONDEMNING IRRESPONSIBLE 
DEFAMATION IN CONGRESS 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 25, 2021 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to express my dismay that members of Con-
gress are making unfounded claims of treason 
and sedition against their colleagues without 
evidence to back their outlandish claims. By 
this, I mean the numerous members alleging 
that members aided in ‘‘reconnaissance’’ tours 
for those individuals who would storm the 
Capitol during the Electoral College certifi-
cation. 
These accusations leveled by several mem-
bers make these bold statements without of-
fering a shred of evidence. In fact, over 30 
members put their names on a letter which 
made these allegations without even an indi-
cation to whom they were referring to. In the 
absence of fact, these accusations have al-
lowed conspiracy to permeate the narrative 
from the deepest enclaves of the Internet. 
Leftist media sources, from major 24 hour 
broadcast companies to biogs, have picked up 
on these hollow accusations, and the effects 
have been damaging. 
Since evidence and due process have been 
replaced with speculation, members of Con-
gress are being deemed guilty of these 
crimes, including myself. In fact, there is now 
a narrative running that since I supported the 
objection to the certification of the count, I 
must be one of the members guilty of this 
treason. Multiple media sources have reported 
as ‘‘fact’’ that me and other objectors con-
ducted tours of the Capitol to do some type of 
‘‘reconnaissance’’. This is patently and un-
equivocally false. They offered no proof of this 
scurrilous and defamatory falsehood. I asked 
Capitol Police to pull and preserve all video 
footage from House security cameras which 
can establish with finality who, if anyone, gave 
even one tour during the days leading to the 
unrest. I can say this: my office has not given 
a tour since February 2020. The continuing 
publication of this defamation by members of 
Congress and media is unprofessional, uneth-
ical, and actionable. 
The increase in violent, threatening mes-
sages received in our offices because of the 
irresponsible political messaging from my col-
leagues in coordination with their media pals 
is sickening and indicative of our larger soci-
etal issues, such as a media which tells their 
viewers what they know to be true, not what 
the facts are. So, let me set the record 
straight. I have not given a tour of the Capitol 
since 2017, and my staff has not given a tour 
since they closed to the public early in 2020 
as a COVID–19 response. Further, at no time 
did anyone with Stop the Steal talk to me 
about violence, and my efforts to speak to the 
American people and fight for my constituents 
were guided by the First Amendment and the 
Electoral Count Act of 1878. 
Madam Speaker, the purpose of this body is 
to serve as the voice of the American people, 
a voice which speaks with honesty to conduct 
the business of this country and contribute to 
the overall good. Yet, the passions of human-
ity can undermine these principles, and these 
unfounded accusations are a menace to the 
traditions of this body. Therefore, Madam 
Speaker, I condemn my colleagues irrespon-
sible actions and their use of their official pow-
ers to fuel a media spectacle for their own po-
litical benefit. Their willingness to set these 
mistruths into the public and not interject when 
the truth is deviated from and innocent people 
are blamed is defamation, conspiratorial, and 
faulty justice. Much like McCarthyism or the 
witch hunt conducted these last four years, 
history will not look kindly on this abuse of 
Congressional power, and therefore I implore 
my colleagues to either set the record straight 
with evidence or retract these claims imme-
diately to resecure their position in history.

REINTRODUCTION 
OF 
THE 
COM-
PREHENSIVE 
BREAST 
RECON-

HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 25, 2021 
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise

reintroduce 
the 
Comprehensive 
Breast Reconstruction Act. This legislation will 
bring Medicaid and Medicare programs into 
compliance with the Women’s Health and 
Cancer Rights Act of 1998, and will expand 
post-mastectomy breast reconstruction pa-
tients’ access to modern and innovative proce-
dures, products, and therapies to support their 
return to a healthy normal. 
In 2020 alone, almost 280,000 new in-
stances of breast cancer were estimated to 
have been diagnosed, and anticipated deaths 
from breast cancer were over 42,000. How-
ever, the breast cancer survival rate has 
steadily increased faster than the rate of new 
diagnoses, which is believed to be related to

new treatments and procedures, such as early 
detection screening. 
My legislation builds on past advancements 
and successes to heal the whole patient fol-
lowing a medically-necessary mastectomy. 
Deciding to receive a mastectomy is undoubt-
edly an emotional decision in an impossible 
situation. In order to alleviate the toll this deci-
sion has on breast cancer patients, breast re-
construction is an option for them to build a 
sense of well-being and confidence as well as 
regain a sense of wholeness. 
More patients are opting for breast recon-
struction, with over 107,000 in 2019, a 36 per-
cent growth since 2000. Unfortunately, many 
patients face a complex landscape of what ex-
actly a breast reconstruction entails, and laws 
and policies intended to provide healthcare 
coverage for this procedure are antiquated 
and do not account for advances in this area. 
My legislation will establish a more uniform 
and 
comprehensive 
breast 
reconstruction 
process that can be tailored to fit each pa-
tient’s needs. Medicaid and Medicare bene-
ficiaries will be guaranteed access to post- 
mastectomy reconstruction under the Wom-
en’s Health and Cancer Rights Act and by ex-
panding coverage to include nipple-areola 
complex tattoos for those who elect to under-
go this procedure. The goal is to expand ac-
cess to scientifically proven healthcare that in-
crease patient well-being and satisfaction with 
their results. 
Madam Speaker, breast reconstruction and 
the nipple-areola complex tattoo are not about 
cosmetic change. They are about holistic out-
comes and choice in what the patient and pro-
vider decide is best physically, emotionally, 
and mentally to attain the ideal outcome and 
long-term health. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in cospon-
soring this long-overdue legislation.

AMERICAN FOOD FOR AMERICAN 
SCHOOLS ACT OF 2021 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 25, 2021 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, today I 
reintroduce the ‘‘American Food for American 
Schools Act,’’ which I have sponsored since 
the 114th Congress. I want to thank Rep-
resentatives KAPTUR (D–OH), FORTENBERRY 
(R–NE), RYAN
(D–OH), LAMALFA
(R–CA), 
CARBAJAL (D–CA), YOUNG (R–AK), and KILMER 
(D–WA) for their support as original cospon-
sors. 
Our ‘‘American Food for American Schools 
Act’’ would strengthen enforcement of the ex-
isting ‘‘Buy American’’ requirements under the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) 
school breakfast, special milk, and national 
school lunch programs. This will ensure that 
school districts use federal taxpayer dollars to 
purchase domestically sourced food products 
for all in-school meals and afterschool snacks. 
Our bipartisan bill would also increase public 
transparency by allowing parents to know from 
where the food served to their children in 
school comes. 
Even in California’s Central Valley, which in-
cludes many of the most productive agricul-
tural communities in the nation, school districts 
continue to misuse taxpayer dollars to buy im-
ported foods, unnecessarily, without informing 
parents. In numerous cases, these same im-
ported foods have been recalled due to safety 
concerns and outbreaks of food borne dis-
eases. This is especially troubling as those 
same foods could have been sourced locally 
in the first place as required by federal law. 
Under our bill, school districts would be re-
quired to obtain a written waiver from USDA to 
use federal taxpayer dollars to purchase for-
eign-sourced food products. Any such waivers 
would only be granted by USDA if the domes-
tically produced food was cost prohibitive or 
simply unavailable. Our bill would also require 
that school districts notify parents of all for-
eign-sourced foods served to students, by 
posting any such waivers obtained from USDA 
on the school’s website. This would increase 
public transparency and provide American 
farmers the opportunity to seek out school dis-
tricts in need of affordable, domestically grown 
foods. Our nation’s schoolchildren should be 
served nutritious, American-grown foods pro-
duced under the strictest food safety stand-
ards in the world, as required by federal law. 
That is exactly what our bill would accomplish. 
In the 115th Congress, we included a ‘‘Buy 
American’’ enforcement provision for the Rich-
ard B. Russell National School Lunch Program 
in the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 
(Public Law 115–334), commonly known as 
the 2018 Farm Bill. This was a first step in ad-
dressing this critical issue for American farm-
ers and parents with school-age children. 
Now, Congress needs to finish the job by 
passing our ‘‘American Food for American 
Schools Act’’ into law. 
Madam Speaker, I hope all members of the 
House will join us in cosponsoring the ‘‘Amer-
ican Food for American Schools Act of 2021.’’ 
I look forward to working with the Committee 
on Education and Labor to ensure that our bi-
partisan bill is included in any future Child Nu-
trition Reauthorization legislation.

IN HONOR OF THE LIFE OF SGT. 
MAJ. JERRY BELL 
HON. KEVIN BRADY 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 25, 2021 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the life of Sergeant Major Jerry Bell, 
a decorated veteran of the United States 
Army, who sadly passed away Sunday, Janu-
ary 10, 2021. 
Jerry Lynn Bell was born May 2, 1943 to 
parents William Ernest and Mary Adeline 
(Johnson) Bell in Leon County, Texas. Jerry 
Bell’s entire life has been defined by bravery 
and selfless service. At the age of 17, he en-
listed in the U.S. Army. During his time in the 
military, he rose to the rank of Sergeant Major 
and proved himself to be a true American 
hero, receiving the Purple Heart, the Distin-
guished Flying Cross, three Air Medals for 
valor, two Bronze Stars for valor, and an Army 
Commendation Medal for valor during his 
service in the Vietnam War as a tanker and 
helicopter gunner. His nephew, Texas State 
Representative Cecil Bell Jr., describes Sgt. 
Maj. Bell as a ‘‘true warrior who fought with 
valor and distinction.’’ 
While his military service took him from 
Alaska to Germany, Sgt. Maj. Bell could not 
help but return to his home of Leon County. 
After returning to Texas, he worked for B–5 
Construction, the U.S. Postal Service, and 
was the owner and operator of Bell Alley Gun 
Shop. 
Sgt. Maj. Bell was a mainstay of the com-
munity. At his gun shop, he did what he loved 
most, selling guns and working as a gunsmith 
while sharing thoughts on conservatism, 2nd 
amendment rights, and religion. While Sgt. 
Maj. Bell leaves behind a military legacy to be 
heralded, it comes second to his legacy as a 
man who placed God first in his life, a man 
who loved his country and state, and a man 
who was a devoted husband, father, and 
great-grandfather. Sgt. Maj. Bell’s favorite 
times were those spent with family at Bell fam-
ily reunions and Christmas parties at his home 
in Leona. The Bell family shared their lives 
with each other and the entire community, 
making everyone feel like they were a part of 
this tight-knit family. 
In the words of his nephew, Cecil Bell Jr., 
‘‘On January 10, 2021, as the cold rains fell in 
Leon County, Texas, the chopping sounds of 
an Army helicopter landing were heard as 
Jerry Bell, age 77, Sergeant Major, U.S. Army 
Retired, deployed to Heaven’s shore.’’ Sgt. 
Maj. is remembered by his loving wife, Alice 
Cothron Bell of Leona and a host of loving 
children, 
grandchildren, 
and 
great-grand-
children. 
I join the entire community in honoring Sgt.

IMPEACHMENT OF PRESIDENT 
DONALD J. TRUMP 
HON. CAROLYN BOURDEAUX 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 25, 2021 
Ms. BOURDEAUX. Madam Speaker, I teach 
a class called Public Service and Democracy 
where often I point out that our democracy is 
not self-executing, it requires people of good 
faith and ethics to make it work. 
Our President and those who enable him 
are not operating in good faith. I come from 
Georgia, one of the most contested states dur-
ing this election cycle and I’m no stranger to 
fighting for voting rights or concerns about 
election results. 
I’ve fought for years to protect our elections 
in Georgia and expand access to the ballot 
box—so I know a thing or two about free and 
fair elections. 
Let’s be clear: Georgia’s elections were ad-
ministered by Republicans who themselves 
voted for and campaigned for President 
Trump. So if there was fraud, I’m sure they 
would have found it. At the request of the 
President and his surrogates, Republicans 
have looked high and low for voter fraud and 
have found nothing. 
Georgia officials, at significant cost to the 
taxpayers I might add, have counted the five 
million votes in Georgia three times, once by 
hand, and only found minor errors that would 
not change the outcome of the election. 
They have audited 15,000 voter signatures 
and again only found the most trivial of prob-
lems, and nothing that would indicate voter 
fraud.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E68 
January 25, 2021 
They have investigated every charge, every 
conspiracy with diligence and have come up 
with nothing. 
The idea that Georgia’s vote was illegitimate 
is a lie. There is no way around it. 
But the President didn’t like the results, so 
he tried to extort, bully, and threaten our Sec-
retary of State to change the election results. 
Now, we actually have attempted election 
fraud—but from our President. And we have 
his conversation on tape. 
When his plan to solicit fraud failed, the 
President then incited a violent mob on the 
basis of lies to come to the Capitol and try to 
disrupt the constitutionally required certification 
of the election. This was a mob with zip tie 
handcuffs, tactical military gear, and weapons. 
A mob that hung a noose on the mall for Vice 
President Mike Pence. Then as the Capitol 
Police made desperate pleas for the deploy-
ment of the national guard to help respond to 
the insurrection, their request was denied by 
the President. 
A democracy requires people of good faith 
and ethics to make it work. I ask my col-
leagues to reject the lies and to support the 
article of impeachment against President Don-
ald Trump.

SENATE COMMITTEE MEETINGS
