The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
HIRONO). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, let 
me say at the outset that I will yield 
the floor if either leader comes. I know 
they are busy in their offices, and I 
would be prepared to give them what-
ever opportunity they need. 
f 
NOMINATION OF LAUREN J. KING 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, this 
week, the Senate will consider Lauren 
King’s nomination for the U.S. District 
Court for the Western District of Wash-
ington. 
Ms. King is an incredibly qualified ju-
rist with experience as a lawyer and a 
judge. If confirmed, she will make his-
tory—the first Native American Fed-
eral judge to serve in Washington’s 
Western District, which is home to 
more 
than 
25 
federally 
recognized 
Tribes. 
Ms. King received her undergraduate 
degree from the University of Wash-
ington, her law degree from the Univer-
sity of Virginia, and for more than 12 
years, she has been a litigator in pri-
vate practice. She has handled cases in-
volving intellectual property, commer-
cial contract disputes, construction 
litigation, and Tribal hunting and fish-
ing rights. 
In addition to her work in private 
practice, Ms. King has served the pub-
lic as an appellate court judge in the 
Northwest Intertribal Court System. 
She has also advocated for her commu-
nity as a member of the Seattle Indian 
Health Board, which provides care to 
Native Americans and Alaskan Na-
tives. 
Ms. King has long been recognized as 
a leader in the legal community. She 
served on the board of the Northwest 
Tribal Court Judges Association, has 
chaired both the Federal Bar Associa-
tion’s Indian Law Section Conference 
and the Washington State Bar Associa-
tion’s Indian Law Section. 
How is she rated by the American 
Bar Association? ‘‘Well qualified.’’ 
Ms. King has the strong support of 
her home State Senators, MURRAY and 
CANTWELL, and bipartisan support in 
our Judiciary Committee, with Rank-
ing Member GRASSLEY
and Senator 
GRAHAM joining us in supporting her 
nomination. 
Her nomination has been endorsed by 
dozens of Tribes and Tribal organiza-
tions throughout the United States, in-
cluding the National Congress of Amer-
ican Indians, the Native American 
Rights Fund, and the Midwest Alliance 
of Sovereign Tribes. Ms. King has given 
back to her community every step of 
her career. 
With her confirmation, the Members 
of the Senate can continue the vital 
work of building the Federal judiciary 
that really reflects the diversity of this 
Nation. 
I urge my colleagues to support her 
nomination. 
f 
U.S. SUPREME COURT 
Mr. 
DURBIN. 
Madam 
President, 
today is the first Monday in October. It 
is the date that marks the start of a 
new term for the U.S. Supreme Court.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6880 
October 4, 2021 
All indications are this term will be 
of major consequence. The Court has 
chosen to take up a number of cases 
that have the potential to dramatically 
change America as we know it. For ex-
ample, the Court has decided to hear 
cases in which it is being asked to 
overturn Roe v. Wade, as well as strike 
down State laws regarding the carrying 
of weapons in public places. These are 
among the momentous issues on the 
Court’s first term. 
Madam President, I would yield the 
floor to the leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Take your time. I am 
going to get settled. 
Mr. DURBIN. He has asked me to 
carry on for a little bit here. 
Back to my statement. 
These are among the momentous 
issues on the Court’s merits docket 
this term. 
But the Court has been also very ac-
tive on another docket, the ‘‘shadow 
docket.’’ Most are not familiar with 
that term and don’t know what it 
means. We learned in the Senate Judi-
ciary Committee. It refers to decisions 
issued by the Supreme Court outside of 
the regular routine merits docket. 
These decisions are often rendered on a 
very short timetable without full brief-
ing, public deliberation, detailed expla-
nation, or signed opinions. 
Historically, shadow docket orders 
were mostly noncontroversial. They 
typically involved routine or proce-
dural questions, such as establishing 
deadlines for parties to file briefs. But 
that has changed in recent years. Not 
only have the orders from the Supreme 
Court shadow docket become more sub-
stantive and controversial, they have 
also been taking an increasingly clear, 
ideological bent. 
Consider the weeks leading up to the 
start of this new October term. The 
Court’s conservative majority used the 
shadow docket to block the Biden ad-
ministration’s COVID eviction morato-
rium and to reinstate the Trump ad-
ministration’s cruel ‘‘Remain in Mex-
ico’’ 
policy 
that, 
unfortunately, 
blocked families and children fleeing 
persecution. 
The Court’s majority also used the 
shadow docket last month to allow 
Texas law S.B. 8 to take effect, a law 
that effectively bans abortion after 6 
weeks, directly violating the constitu-
tional protections the Court recognized 
half a century in Roe v. Wade. 
These and other shadow docket or-
ders from the Court’s conservative Jus-
tices are having profound consequences 
for millions of Americans. 
Last week, the Senate Judiciary 
Committee, which I chair and the Pre-
siding Officer has joined as a member, 
held a hearing on the Court’s use of the 
shadow docket. 
We heard from a number of experts 
about the increased use of the docket 
and the increasing ideological nature 
of its use. They pointed out, for exam-
ple, that President Trump’s Justice De-
partment, in 4 years, requested the 
Court take emergency action on their 
shadow docket a recordbreaking 36 
times in 4 years. The Court granted 28 
of those requests. 
What about previous Presidents? In 
contrast, the Justice Department only 
requested emergency relief eight times 
total—eight 
times—in 
16 
years 
of 
George W. Bush and Barack Obama, 
and on only four occasions was the 
shadow docket approved—the request 
was approved. 
At this point, I am going to yield the 
floor and ask unanimous consent that 
when I return to the floor, I be able to 
resume these remarks. But I want to 
yield to the majority leader. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
thank my dear friend, our majority 
whip and the senior Senator from the 
State of Illinois, as well as someone 
who was my roommate for, well, dec-
ades, I guess. 
f 
INFRASTRUCTURE AND BUILD 
BACK BETTER AGENDA 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, on 
the day that this majority commenced 
its work, I promised that this Chamber 
would meet the challenges that face 
our Nation ‘‘not with timid solutions 
but with boldness and [with] courage.’’ 
Now the 117th Congress stands at a piv-
otal moment in our pursuit of this 
goal. 
Over the past few months, both 
Chambers have dedicated themselves 
to passing two transformative, once-in- 
a-generation pieces of legislation: the 
bipartisan infrastructure bill and the 
Build Back Better agenda. 
Doing big things in Congress is al-
ways hard, but we didn’t choose elected 
office just to pursue the easy things. In 
the days and weeks to come, Senate 
Democrats will remain focused on pass-
ing the agenda we promised no matter 
how hard the task. 
All last week, I held extensive talks 
with the Speaker, the President, and 
my Senate colleagues to bring us closer 
to a final agreement on our Build Back 
Better agenda. We made important 
progress, but there is more work to do. 
So, this week, I will continue meet-
ing with my colleagues in an effort to 
produce a bill that all of us can get be-
hind. 
Last Friday, President Biden spoke 
to House Democrats about the path 
forward for passing our ambitious 
agenda into law. His message was sim-
ple: If we stick together, if we work to 
find a legislative sweet spot that we 
can all support, then we will succeed. 
He is right, and that is exactly what 
we are going to do. 
As I explained this morning in my 
‘‘Dear Colleague,’’ our new legislative 
goal must be to get both the infra-
structure bill and the Build Back Bet-
ter agenda done by the end of October. 
The reason is simple: The infrastruc-
ture bill, for all its historic invest-
ments, is also a reauthorization of the 
highway trust fund. We passed a 30-day 
patch over the weekend to keep vital 
programs going. But as it stands, the 
trust fund is set to run out of money by 
the end of October. 
If we are going to meet this deadline, 
Democrats must arrive at a final agree-
ment on the details of the Build Back 
Better agenda as soon as possible, pref-
erably within a matter of days, not 
weeks. It is the only way we can give 
committees enough time to draft legis-
lation to ensure its privileged status in 
our Chamber and complete the rec-
onciliation process before the end of 
the month. 
Now, none of this is going to be easy. 
It will require sacrifice, compromise, 
and finding common ground. Nobody is 
going to get everything they want. 
But no matter what, our final pro-
posal will deliver the core promise we 
made to the American people: We will 
take bold action on climate change, 
while creating millions of jobs; we will 
expand healthcare opportunities and 
lower costs for working Americans; and 
we will cut taxes for the working and 
middle class, while asking the wealthy 
to pay their fair share. 
I am confident we will be proud of 
the end result: a bill that will dramati-
cally improve the lives of every single 
American not just for today but for 
generations; a bill that will rebuild lad-
ders for working people to get to the 
middle class, help people stay in the 
middle class who are there already, and 
rekindle—rekindle—that sunny Amer-
ican disposition so central to our na-
tional identity but seems to be fading a 
bit in the last while. 
This is worth a couple of hard days. 
This is worth many hard days. Again, 
we didn’t come to Washington to take 
the easy way out. We came here com-
mitted to work every day, to reward 
the faith that the American people 
have placed in us. We came here to get 
big things done, and that is exactly 
what we will do in the weeks ahead. 
f 
DEBT CEILING 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
now, on the debt ceiling, before the end 
of this week, the Senate must—must— 
get a bill to the President’s desk to ad-
dress the acute crisis of the debt limit. 
President Biden was crystal clear in 
his speech this morning. If Republicans 
don’t get out of the way and let the 
Senate take action now, our govern-
ment will in all likelihood enter de-
fault for the first time ever. 
Sadly, the Republican position as the 
party of default has now become so ex-
treme that they have blocked every 
single attempt to prevent a default 
from happening, putting our country in 
serious, serious danger. They have gone 
so far as rejecting their own requests 
for how the debt ceiling should be

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6881 
October 4, 2021 
raised. Their own requests for putting 
those in action—they are now saying 
no. Why do you think? Why do you 
think? 
Now the Republican leader has re-
peatedly stated that the Democrats 
must raise the debt ceiling on our own, 
and he has directly cited precedents of 
2003, 2004, and 2006 when the Senate 
voted to raise the debt ceiling by a ma-
jority vote. But what he conveniently 
and repeatedly ignores—and he knows 
better—he ignores that in each of those 
examples, the minority allowed an up- 
or-down vote without—without—a par-
tisan filibuster. In other words, the 
other side said: Get us to 50 votes, and 
we won’t make you get to 60. 
That is just what we are asking for 
now. We are proposing the same offer 
now, which Leader MCCONNELL
has 
cited. Let us vote to raise the debt ceil-
ing without a partisan filibuster. In 
fact, this was the thrust of my consent 
request last week, which would have 
resolved this Republican-driven default 
crisis with an up-or-down vote. Repub-
licans could have gotten their chance 
to vote no, and we could all have put 
an end to this needless impasse. But 
given the easiest way out of the mess, 
the Republicans still refuse to take 
‘‘yes’’ for an answer. Now our country 
is on the brink of a crisis whose con-
sequences will reverberate around the 
world. 
The bottom line is, this Chamber 
must pass legislation to avoid a de-
fault. Accordingly, I will soon file clo-
ture on the House-passed proposal that 
will suspend the debt limit until De-
cember of 2022. We aren’t asking Re-
publicans to support it when it comes 
time for a vote; we only ask that they 
get out of the way as Democrats pass it 
on our own, just as the majority party 
did in the early 2000s. It is really that 
simple. If Republicans want to vote to 
stop payments from going to Social Se-
curity recipients or veterans, then be 
my guest, but they ought to get out of 
the way and let the legislation pass the 
Senate. 
The fact is, we don’t have the luxury 
of waiting until October 18 to extend 
the debt ceiling. Even a near miss can 
have dramatic consequences. Every 
single day we delay taking action, we 
increase the chances of doing irrevers-
ible damage to our global financial sys-
tem, our economic recovery, and trust 
in our country’s ability to pay its 
debts. 
So, again, we will need to get a bill 
extending the debt ceiling to the Presi-
dent’s desk by the end of this week. We 
aren’t asking Republicans to vote yes 
even though it is debt that they in-
curred; we are simply asking that they 
get out of the way. 
I yield the floor, and I thank my col-
league for his courtesy. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican leader is recognized. 
DEBT CEILING 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I want to begin today with a quotation: 
Because this massive accumulation of debt 
was predicted, because it was foreseeable, be-
cause it was unnecessary, because it was the 
result of willful and reckless disregard for 
the warnings that were given and for the fun-
damentals of economic management, I am 
voting against the debt limit increase. 
Now, Madam President, that was 
then-Senator Joe Biden in March of 
2006, right before every single Demo-
cratic Senator voted against raising 
the debt limit and made a unified Re-
publican government do it alone. 
Here is another quote: 
Today’s fiscal mess . . . is the inevitable 
outcome of policies that consistently ig-
nored evidence and experience. My symbolic 
vote against raising the debt limit would 
have been a protest of the policies that have 
brought us to this point, and a demand that 
we change course. 
Well, that same speaker, then-Sen-
ator Biden, 2 years earlier in 2004. 
As Senate Republicans have made 
clear since last July and as I reminded 
the President in a letter just this 
morning, his sentiments then are our 
sentiments now. His sentiments then 
are our sentiments now. 
For the last few weeks, Washington 
Democrats tried to forget that they 
lined up to oppose debt limit increases 
during unified Republican government. 
They pretended these votes are always 
bipartisan. Well, that was simply not 
true. 
So now our colleagues have moved on 
to yet another new argument that is 
equally flimsy. Now they claim they 
would be perfectly happy to handle this 
responsibility with 51 votes done one 
way, but they would rather risk the 
Nation’s credit than doing it with 51 
votes a slightly different way—two dif-
ferent ways to achieve 51 votes. I am 
not kidding. This is the position they 
are taking. The President said it today. 
The reconciliation procedure would 
be slightly more inconvenient, they 
said—a few more days, a few more 
votes they would rather duck. The 
Democratic leaders running America 
are saying with a straight face that the 
entire U.S. economy should live or die 
based on the procedural convenience— 
convenience—of 
Washington 
Demo-
crats. 
Now, they have got no problem using 
the party-line process over and over 
and over to spend trillions and trans-
form the country, but now, for this 
purpose only, they suddenly and mys-
teriously find it unappealing. 
Democrats could not be more capable 
of handling this on their own. Just 
months ago, the Democratic leader 
won new powers to reuse reconciliation 
over and over. They don’t even need 
our consent to set a vote at 51 instead 
of 60. They need even less help raising 
the debt limit than majorities needed 
in the past. So trust me, Madam Presi-
dent—if Republicans were sitting on a 
hidden veto power to stop reconcili-
ation bills, you would have heard about 
it way back in the springtime. The ma-
jority doesn’t need our votes. They just 
want a bipartisan shortcut around pro-
cedural hurdles that they can actually 
clear on their own, and they want that 
shortcut so they can pivot right back 
to partisan spending as fast as possible. 
They want a bipartisan shortcut to get 
right back to more partisan hardball. 
And 
Republicans 
have 
spent 
21⁄2 
months—this is no surprise; 21⁄2 months 
ago—explaining that this is the way 
they needed to go forward on the debt 
ceiling. 
This unified Democratic government 
is having trouble governing. They 
couldn’t even pass the bipartisan infra-
structure bill which the President ne-
gotiated and the Speaker of the House 
promised would pass last week. 
The majority needs to stop sleep-
walking toward yet another prevent-
able crisis. Democrats need to tackle 
the debt limit. We gave them a road-
map and 3 months’ notice. I suggest 
that our colleagues get moving. 
f 
INFLATION 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
now on an obviously related matter, 
speaking of Democrats’ reckless taxing 
and spending, this unified government 
is behind closed doors brainstorming 
ways to make inflation even more 
painful for American families. Their 
next 
reckless 
taxing-and-spending 
spree is packed with radical, leftwing 
policies and the biggest tax hike on the 
American people in half a century. 
So far, the bill is more than 2,400 
pages long, but it can be summarized in 
just four words: hurts families and 
helps China. Hurts families and helps 
China. 
Wasting trillions and trillions of dol-
lars on socialism would be a bad idea 
any day, but it is a uniquely bad idea 
at a time when American families are 
already being hammered by inflation 
and soaring costs. 
The government’s own data continue 
to indicate that the historic and pain-
ful inflation that began to take hold of 
our economy this spring isn’t going 
anywhere anytime soon. The Chairman 
of the Federal Reserve acknowledged 
last week that rising prices have be-
come an increasingly broad and struc-
tural problem. Last week, the Com-
merce Department reported that infla-
tion has continued to rise faster than 
at any time since 1991. The Democrats’ 
inflation is so bad that even though the 
average American worker has gotten a 
multiple-percentage-point 
pay 
raise 
over the last year, their actual pur-
chasing power has actually been cut. 
Their paychecks have gone up, but 
their buying power has gone down. 
Wholesale inflation just marked the 
steepest 12-month jump on record. 
Even dollar stores are having to raise 
their prices. Just ask any American 
family about the last few trips to the 
supermarket, the gas station, or the 
toy store. Heaven forbid if they have 
had to participate in the housing mar-
ket or the auto market anytime lately.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6882 
October 4, 2021 
And the Democrats are uniting around 
yet another multitrillion-dollar tax-
ing-and-spending spree? I guess our col-
leagues think they can inflate their 
way out of inflation. That is going to 
be an extraordinarily painful experi-
ment for the middle-class families of 
our country.

Mr. DURBIN. I ask consent to speak 
as if in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
DEBT CEILING 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I lis-
tened closely to the speech by the Re-
publican Senate leader, and I have 
heard statements made over the week-
end on television. I think this is a mo-
ment where we might consider for just 
a minute or two a lesson on Senate 101 
so there is an understanding of where 
we are and why we are at this place. 
There are 100 Members of the Senate. 
Currently, there are 50 Democrats and 
50 Republicans. Under the ordinary 
course of business, which has become 
extraordinary in this Chamber, a ma-
jority rules, so 51 votes will pass an 
amendment or a bill in most cases. 
However, there is a creature in the 
Senate known as a filibuster, and the 
filibuster requires that 60 votes be 
found in order to prevail on a motion 
or a measure. 
The filibuster raises the requirement 
from a simple majority to 60 votes. The 
Senator from Kentucky knows that as 
well as I do, he has been here longer 
than I have, that filibuster makes all 
the difference in the world. So to argue 
‘‘The Democrats have the majority; 
why don’t they just take this majority 
and do their business?’’ is to ignore the 
obvious. 
What the Republicans have decided 
to do is, for the first time perhaps 
ever—I don’t want to say that without 
checking the record for sure—but cer-
tainly in modern history, to require 
that when we pass the debt ceiling, we 
need to have 60 votes on the floor of 
the Senate. Well, it is no great revela-
tion that with 50 Democrats, we would 
need 10 Republicans, and the Senate 
Republican leader has made it clear: He 
ain’t giving us a vote, not one. So we 
have come to a standstill. 
We are 2 weeks away from a default. 
For the first time in the history of the 
United States that we would default on 
our debt, it is as if America had a big 
home and a big mortgage and decided 
one month not to pay on the mortgage. 
Well, let’s hope the day would come 
when the payment would be made, but 
in the meantime, there is a serious 
question then raised about the credit 
reputation of the United States, and 
that is exactly the fire that the Repub-
licans are playing with by imposing a 
filibuster on this simple measure. They 
know that they can stop us as long as 
60 votes are needed and they give none. 
One 
of 
our 
colleagues, 
Senator 
WHITEHOUSE, made an interesting ob-
servation in our caucus lunch last 
week. I hope he will forgive me if I try 
to paraphrase it. He said: Many people 
argue that we need a filibuster because 
it really encourages bipartisanship. We 
have to come together. We have to look 
for compromise. 
Well, how do you compromise when 
the debt ceiling question is whether 
you do it or don’t do it? And that is 
what is at stake here. Are we going to 
acknowledge the debt of the United 
States to its creditors far and wide and 
continue the business of this economy 
and this government? Republicans say: 
No, we would rather play fire with it. 
But they leave out that one element 
that is so critical: It is their decision, 
their filibuster that stops this. 
I believe that Senator SCHUMER and 
the Democrats will offer them this op-
portunity again this week. Senator 
SCHUMER said as much. But it really 
troubles me that we are at a point in 
our history, recovering from this pan-
demic, businesses getting back on their 
feet, employees need to go back to 
work—and the Republicans have taken 
this strategy of defaulting on the na-
tional debt. 
As far as the characterization of 
what reconciliation will do, Senator 
MCCONNELL continues to come to the 
floor repeatedly and say: ‘‘It will hurt 
families.’’ Well, one of the provisions 
in the reconciliation bill, which I hope 
survives our compromise negotiation, 
will help families find affordable, qual-
ity daycare. 
When you look at the fact that the 
vast majority of those who are not re-
turning to work are women, you under-
stand the circumstances. Many of them 
question whether or not school is going 
to be in person or by Zoom. They ques-
tion whether or not they can find af-
fordable daycare in any direction, and 
they question whether they can afford 
it once they find it. 
If we took that worry off the family 
plate and said ‘‘We are going to make 
sure that you have accessible, afford-
able childcare for your children,’’ think 
of the relief it would give and the fact 
that many would return to the work-
place. 
According to the Senator from Ken-
tucky, Senator MCCONNELL, that hurts 
families. Hurts them? It helps them in 
ways that many of us don’t even under-
stand. Can you imagine frantically 
leaving a child at home in the care of 
someone you don’t quite trust because 
you have no alternative but to go to 
work and try to earn a paycheck to 
feed that child and pay the rent? I 
wouldn’t want to be in that desperate 
situation. I wouldn’t want anyone in 
family to face it. To say that hurts 
families, to do that, is certainly wrong. 
It would help them if reconciliation in-
cludes that measure. 
We also have a pre-K program to give 
kids who struggle a helping hand and a 
fresh start. We know the Head Start 
Program—it was created I guess almost 
60-plus years ago—has had positive re-
sults in preparing people to go to col-
lege. Yes, Head Start Programs when 
they are young children—3, 4, and 5 
years old—can make difference in their 
lives, how they learn, and what they 
do. So we want to make that the offi-
cial policy of this country, that we 
have 2 years of pre-K education avail-
able to families. I think they will 
thank us for it, and in the future, gen-
erations that are helped with this will 
thank us as well. 
The notion of extending the school 
year from K–12 through K–14, to put 2 
years of community college without 
cost for families, is an extraordinary 
commitment. 
There was a time in the turn of the 
19th to the 20th century when America 
decided to make a big, bold experi-
ment. It was called high schools. Up 
until that point, most families were 
lucky to get kids through eighth grade. 
The rich families, the ones well-posi-
tioned, would take them to high 
school. Well, we decided to make high 
school a universal, national experience 
in America. So you wouldn’t quit at 
the 8th grade; you would finish in the 
12th grade. Did it result in anything 
good for us? Take a look at the 20th 
century. With an educated, motivated 
workforce, America led the world. It is

no accident that extending education 
brought us to that moment. 
Now, Joe Biden and many of us agree 
the 21st century is a brandnew set of 
challenges and putting 2 more years 
that you don’t have to worry about 
going deep in debt affording on to a 
person’s education gives them a better 
chance. Some will go to college. Some 
will develop skills that they need to 
get into the workforce and succeed. 
Some will have an experience that will 
change their lives. That is what this 
additional 2 years will be. 
Senator MCCONNELL thinks an addi-
tional 2 years of free higher education 
hurts American families. What is he 
thinking? I don’t know what it is like 
in the Commonwealth of Kentucky, but 
just north of it, in Illinois, we appre-
ciate education and how it liberates, 
motivates, and educates young people 
to be part of the future. 
So I would say to Senator MCCON-
NELL: Understand Senate 101. Your fili-
buster is stopping the extension of the 
debt ceiling, and stopping the exten-
sion is going to jeopardize our credit 
rating, raise interest rates, and cost 6 
million American jobs, according to 
the best economists. Why would we do 
that to America at this moment in his-
tory? We should be doing just the oppo-
site, helping everybody we can. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent to return to my statement 
that I was making earlier when I vol-
untarily surrendered the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
U.S. SUPREME COURT 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I 
noted that the shadow docket in the 
Supreme Court was a subject of the 
Senate Judiciary Committee last week. 
It is one of those esoteric subjects you 
wonder if anybody will even notice. We 
thought it was important enough to 
talk about it in light of the Texas abor-
tion statute. 
We noted the fact that in the last 4 
years, there were 36 times when the 
Trump administration asked for the 
shadow docket to be used. The Court 
granted 28 of those Trump Justice De-
partment administration requests. In 
the previous years, under George W. 
Bush and Barack Obama: 16 years; 8 re-
quests; 4 were granted—4 versus 28 out 
of 36. 
You can tell that something is hap-
pening in the Court. The day after our 
hearing, someone happened to notice. 
That person was Justice Samuel Alito. 
He made headlines for a speech he gave 
at Notre Dame Law School criticizing 
lawmakers—I suppose that is myself 
and the Presiding Officer—journalists, 
and scholars who raised concern about 
the Court’s use of the shadow docket. 
There doesn’t appear to be a publicly 
available transcript or video of the full 
speech given by Justice Alito, so I ask 
unanimous consent to have printed in 
the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD an article 
from 
The 
Hill 
newspaper 
entitled 
‘‘Alito bristles over criticism of Su-
preme Court’s ‘shadow docket’.’’ 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From The Hill, Sept. 30, 2021] 
ALITO BRISTLES OVER CRITICISM OF SUPREME 
COURT’S SHADOW DOCKET 
(By John Kruzel) 
Justice Samuel Alito on Thursday bristled 
over recent criticism of the Supreme Court’s 
handling of emergency matters under its so- 
called ‘‘shadow docket,’’ a phrase the justice 
said plays into a warped portrayal of the 
court as a ‘‘dangerous cabal.’’ 
The staunchly conservative 71-year-old jus-
tice said he welcomes substantive debate 
over the court’s rulings, but takes exception 
to what he characterized as a distorted de-
piction commonly found in media reports on 
the court’s emergency activity. 
‘‘The catchy and sinister term ‘shadow 
docket’ has been used to portray the court as 
having been captured by a dangerous cabal 
that resorts to sneaky and improper methods 
to get its ways,’’ Alito told students during 
a speech at Notre Dame Law School. 
‘‘And this portrayal feeds unprecedented 
efforts to intimidate the court or damage it 
as an independent institution,’’ he said. 
The phrase ‘‘shadow docket,’’ originally 
coined by University of Chicago Law School 
professor William Baude, has come to refer 
to the court’s use of a truncated process to 
issue rulings on an emergency basis. The 
procedure departs from the court’s regular 
operations by forgoing a comprehensive set 
of paper briefs and oral arguments in favor of 
ruling quickly on an emergency application. 
Although Alito’s speech Thursday gave the 
impression that the principal critics of the 
court’s shadow docket were observers and 
politicians, three of his fellow justices have 
criticized the shadow docket’s recent use as 
a vehicle for rulings of major significance. 
In recent weeks, the court’s three more lib-
eral 
justices—Stephen 
Breyer, 
Sonia 
Sotomayor and Elena Kagan—have either in-
dividually criticized the procedure’s use or 
joined a dissenting opinion that did so. 
The liberal jurists denounced the major-
ity’s use of the shadow docket in August to 
block an eviction freeze put in place by the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) to shield cash-strapped renters from 
the coronavirus pandemic. Likewise. a 5–4 
majority court refused to block Texas’ six- 
week abortion ban from taking effect earlier 
this month. 
Kagan took direct aim at the practice in a 
dissent from the majority’s Texas ruling 
that was joined by her two fellow liberals. 
‘‘[T]he majority’s decision is emblematic 
of too much of this Court’s shadow docket 
decisionmaking—which every day becomes 
more unreasoned, inconsistent, and impos-
sible to defend,’’ Kagan wrote. 
The shadow docket itself is nothing new. 
But the Supreme Court had previously used 
the abbreviated process only sparingly to 
render decisions of major consequence, ac-
cording to a report by The Economist, which 
found the practice became more common 
during the Trump administration. 
Alito conceded in his Thursday speech that 
the emergency docket has seen an increase 
in activity. 
‘‘Now it is true that we have issued more 
emergency rulings in recent years, but there 
is a simple reason for that and it’s not part 
of a nefarious strategy: it’s because we had 
been receiving more emergency applica-
tions,’’ he said. 
‘‘We would much prefer to have days or 
weeks or months to think about these mat-
ters before we have to do anything,’’ he 
added. ‘‘But we don’t have that luxury. The 
world will not sit still while we cogitate.’’ 
Mr. DURBIN. In his speech, Justice 
Alito reportedly zeroed in on our Sen-
ate Judiciary Committee hearing last 
week and criticized one of the experts 
who testified, University of Texas law 
professor Steve Vladeck. He also re-
portedly criticized an article by a re-
spected journalist who writes about the 
Court frequently for a major magazine. 
Justice Alito derided the phrase 
‘‘shadow docket’’ as a ‘‘catchy and sin-
ister term’’ meant to convey some-
thing ‘‘sneaky and dangerous.’’ In fact, 
the phrase ‘‘shadow docket’’ was coined 
by a University of Chicago law pro-
fessor, William Baude, who, inciden-
tally, clerked for Chief Justice Roberts 
and has spoken more than 30 times in 
Federalist Society events. 
Justice 
Alito 
dismissed 
concerns 
about the shadow docket. He said: 
The media and political talk about the 
shadow docket is not serious criticism. 
What he failed to mention, however, 
is that some of the strongest warnings 
about the Court’s changing use of the 
shadow docket have come not from 
politicians like ourselves or journalists 
but from Justice Alito’s colleagues on 
the Court. 
Our hearing in the Judiciary Com-
mittee 
highlighted 
how 
Justices 
Kagan, Sotomayor, Breyer, and even 
Chief Justice Roberts sounded the 
alarm about the Supreme Court’s shad-
ow docket ruling on the Texas abortion 
ban. 
Justice 
Sotomayor 
said 
of 
the 
Court’s shadow docket decision on the 
Texas law: 
The Court’s order is stunning. Presented 
with an application to enjoin a flagrantly 
unconstitutional law engineered to prohibit 
women from exercising their constitutional 
rights and evade judicial scrutiny, a major-
ity of Justices have opted to bury their 
heads in the sand. 
That is from Justice Sotomayor. 
How about Justice Kagan? Justice 
Kagan 
expressed 
alarm 
that 
the 
Court’s shadow docket decisionmaking 
‘‘every day becomes more unreasoned, 
inconsistent, and impossible to defend. 
The Justices made it clear that the 
Court’s shadow docket handling of S.B. 
8 in Texas raises urgent concerns that 
American people should be aware of. 
That is why we had the hearing. Chief 
Justice Roberts noted that Texas has 
now created ‘‘a model for action,’’ in 
his words, showing how States can un-
dermine constitutional rights by using 
a bounty hunter enforcement scheme 
that avoids judicial scrutiny, thanks to 
the shadow docket. Lawmakers in a 
number of States are eyeing this proce-
dure to try to copycat Texas’s enforce-
ment model. That ought to trouble 
anyone who cares about our Constitu-
tion. 
With its order on the Texas abortion 
ban, the Court’s majority has also 
shown its willingness to use the shad-
ow docket to allow ‘‘flagrantly uncon-
stitutional’’ laws, in the words of Jus-
tice Sotomayor, to take effect, at least 
when the laws align with the major-
ity’s ideological beliefs. As a result,

October 4, 2021 
millions of Texans have had their con-
stitutional rights stripped away, and 
the rights of all Americans are less se-
cure. That is a major change that de-
mands serious discussion. 
Justice Alito may bristle at per-
ceived criticism of the Court’s prac-
tices, but that doesn’t mean the Court 
should be immune from scrutiny from 
the American people, a free press, even 
legislative branch of government. 
Historically, Congress has played an 
important and essential role in debates 
over the proper functioning of the 
courts. 
First and foremost is the Senate’s ad-
vise and consent role that results in 
the appointment of men and women to 
the Supreme Court. In addition, many 
aspects of the Supreme Court’s oper-
ation, including the starting date of 
the Court’s fall term, are established 
by an act of Congress. In fact, much of 
the Court’s jurisdiction is set by Con-
gress. 
Congress is asked regularly by the 
Judicial Conference to pass new legis-
lation governing the operations of the 
judiciary, and Justices have routinely 
come before Congress to discuss the re-
quests and a wide range of other mat-
ters. In March 2019, for example, Jus-
tice Kagan testified before the House 
Appropriations Committee about such 
topics as whether the judicial code of 
conduct should apply to the Supreme 
Court. With her that day was none 
other than Justice Alito. 
The Senate Judiciary Committee has 
frequently and appropriately been the 
forum for many debates over the Su-
preme Court’s operations. I remember 
in 2011 when Justices Scalia and Breyer 
appeared before the Judiciary Com-
mittee for a wide-ranging discussion of 
the role of judges under the Constitu-
tion. 
Our committee also has robust de-
bates about the appropriate degree of 
transparency for the Court’s operation. 
Earlier this year, the committee ap-
proved bipartisan legislation to allow 
cameras in the Supreme Court so that 
all Americans can see what is going on. 
We are going to continue this debate 
in the Judiciary Committee over the 
shadow docket. It is not politicizing 
the Court to do so. And Republicans 
have no standing to accuse Democrats 
of politicizing the Court, especially 
after their unprecedented, politically 
motivated 
blockade 
of 
President 
Obama’s Supreme Court nominee in 
2016 and their haste to confirm a third 
Trump Justice mere weeks before the 
2020 election—both acts of raw, polit-
ical power. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that the 
order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
DUCKWORTH). Without objection, it is 
so ordered. 
AFGHANISTAN 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Madam Presi-
dent, in the winter of 2010, American 
intelligence picked up the chatter of 
Afghan fighters in Pakistan. 
‘‘Why are you back?’’ asked the 
Taliban leaders. ‘‘You are supposed to 
be fighting the Americans.’’ 
‘‘Yes,’’ one of the fighters said, ‘‘but 
the Americans run toward the bullets.’’ 
That story captures the American 
fighting spirit. If you ever find yourself 
questioning the greatness of this coun-
try, I encourage you to go talk to one 
of our young servicemembers. 
I am not talking about our older gen-
erals or warhorses you often see on TV 
or around here on Capitol Hill. They 
won’t renew your faith in America. 
They may even worry you. 
I am talking about the young people. 
It is the door kickers, the tank drivers, 
the trigger pullers. Some of them are 
still just kids. I am talking about the 
ones fresh out of college; ones hoping 
to pay for college by signing up for our 
great military. These young people are 
America’s future. 
They are the Americans who fought 
so hard for us in Afghanistan over the 
last 20 years, and they are the ones so 
disappointed today of how we aban-
doned our mission in Afghanistan. 
Many of them did not remember the 
bright blue morning on September 11, 
2001, when evil itself boarded four 
planes here on the east coast and took 
the lives of 2,977 of our fellow Ameri-
cans in just a matter of hours. 
They were just infants when Presi-
dent Bush demanded the Taliban hand 
over Osama bin Laden and shut down 
the terrorist training camps that lit-
tered 
Afghanistan. 
And 
when 
the 
Taliban refused, the United States and 
our most loyal ally, Great Britain, in-
vaded Afghanistan. 
We were soon joined by 46 other na-
tions. It was the first time Article 5 of 
NATO had been invoked, which states: 
An attack on one is an attack on all. 
America, in her righteous might, 
launched Operation Enduring Freedom 
and rained hell on the Taliban on Octo-
ber 7, 2001. We lost 12 brave American 
soldiers that year, but by December 17, 
we controlled a country few Americans 
could have found on the map months 
before. 
To call Afghanistan in 2001 ‘‘stone 
age’’ would be an insult to the rocks on 
the ground. We saw diseases only found 
in textbooks. Eighty-five percent of the 
population was illiterate. No girls were 
allowed to attend school. Cell phones 
and computers were nonexistent. 
We were not there to conquer. We 
didn’t want to nation build. Our pres-
ence was needed because we wanted to 
keep Afghanistan from yet again be-
coming a training sanctuary for every 
would-be terrorist on Earth. 
After all, the United States and our 
politicians of the 1990s looked the other 
way and failed to recognize Afghani-
stan as a threat. Thirty years ago, Af-
ghanistan was a training ground for 
some 10 to 20,000 terrorists. 
From Afghanistan, al-Qaida attacked 
the World Trade Center in 1993; two of 
our Embassies in Africa; and bombed 
the USS Cole, a ship that was docked. 
The Clinton administration thought 
it could handle al-Qaida and their ter-
rorist threat with over-the-horizon ca-
pabilities. September 11 showed us that 
strategy doesn’t work. But, unfortu-
nately, the Biden administration has 
forgotten those lessons of our past. 
During World War II, my father land-
ed at Normandy and fought the Nazis 
in Europe. Hitler and Germany had the 
will to win, but, thank God, America 
and our allies had more will. 
From the time my dad landed at Nor-
mandy to when he reached Berlin, he 
earned five Bronze Stars and a Purple 
Heart. He was lucky. More than 400,000 
other Americans would never return 
home. Their blood, sweat, and tears 
saved Europe and the free world. 
Yet the work of the Greatest Genera-
tion didn’t end on May 8, 1945. Ameri-
cans stayed in Germany. We stayed to 
prosecute Nazi leadership. We stayed to 
build and rebuild their businesses and 
banks. 
If you drive a BMW today, it is be-
cause America worked to change the 
behavior of millions of Nazis who were 
still living in Germany after the war. 
And we are, today, still in Germany. 
It is the same success story in Japan 
and in South Korea. America’s com-
mitment to freedom and democracy 
didn’t end when the shooting stopped. 
Today, Germany, Japan, and South 
Korea are some of our most vibrant 
economies and democracies across the 
world. Those nations are also among 
our closest allies. 
That, ladies and gentlemen, was our 
hope for Afghanistan. Every American 
wants to see war come to an end. War 
is ugly. War is brutal. War robs lives 
and destroys property. But freedom is 
certainly worth fighting for. 
Like World War II, our war in Af-
ghanistan was completely justified. We 
took the end fight to the enemy who 
started it: the Taliban and al-Qaida. 
Our war in Afghanistan ended in 2014. 
Operation 
Enduring 
Freedom 
transitioned to a supporting role called 
Operation Resolute Support. 
That support trained the Afghan 
Army, intelligence, and police forces to 
fend for themselves. It allowed for 
greater educational opportunities for 
young boys and girls all throughout Af-
ghanistan. 
And as the Afghan security forces be-
came increasingly capable, America 
withdrew her forces. By January 2021, 
we had reduced our presence to just 
2,500 from a high of 98,000 in 2011. 
President Trump also wanted to go 
to zero, but his military advisers said 
it would be unwise. So President 
Trump listened and maintained troop 
levels at 2,500. 
President Biden claims he doesn’t re-
member his generals telling him to 
keep 2,500 troops in Afghanistan. Yet 
the President’s principal military ad-
viser, General Mark Milley, says he

wanted to see 2,500 troops in Afghani-
stan. The top commander for the Mid-
dle East, General Frank McKenzie, said 
he wanted to see 2,500 troops remain in 
Afghanistan. The top, longest-serving, 
and most decorated commander in Af-
ghanistan, General Scott Miller, want-
ed to see 2,500 troops in Afghanistan. 
They clearly told President Biden 
that, to remain stable and protect the 
U.S. and our allies, Afghanistan needed 
a small American presence of 2,500 
troops. 
So when the President says he 
doesn’t recall or he doesn’t remember, 
is he telling the truth? 
Well, I don’t know. But what I do 
know is that President Biden didn’t lis-
ten to his military advisers. He didn’t 
listen to troops on the ground. He ig-
nored military advice and, instead, 
made a political decision. 
You can’t run a war from Washington 
with an 8,000-mile-long screwdriver. If 
you do, you will screw it up—85 billion 
in equipment captured by the Taliban; 
valuable air bases abandoned in the 
middle of the night; American citizens 
still left behind enemy lines to this 
day; journalists and aid workers aban-
doned; innocent Afghan partners and 
allies left to the will of our enemy; 
chaos and disorder at Kabul airport; 
desperate Afghans falling from our air-
craft, as people across our Nation and 
the world watched in horror; 13 Amer-
ican soldiers dead. 
None of this should have ever hap-
pened. But now we must reckon with 
the worst foreign policy decision ever 
made. Our credibility has been eroded 
and respect from our allies has been de-
stroyed. 
America must return to the peace- 
through-strength leadership that has 
guided us throughout history. It has 
made our enemies fear us, our allies 
value us and what it means to have us 
as a partner on the world stage. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that the

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

TRIBUTE TO LEE GREENWOOD 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, many artists and entertainers 
have staked their claim to fame by 
bending the rules and changing the 
conventional wisdom that defines their 
craft. But not many can claim to have 
made an impact on American culture 
that is at once musical, political, and 
spiritual. 
This month, my friend and fellow 
Tennessean Lee Greenwood is enjoying 
some 
well-deserved 
recognition 
for 
doing just that. Next week, he will cel-
ebrate the 40th year of one of the most 
significant and successful careers in 
country music history. 
On behalf of the entire Tennessee del-
egation, I want to thank Lee for his ar-
tistry, his patriotism, and his belief in 
the power of a song to heal our deepest 
wounds. 
We thank him for his friendship, for 
his commitment to our great State of 
Tennessee, and we wish him even 
greater successes in his career. 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING 
Madam President, over the weekend, 
my Democratic colleagues put on a ter-
rific show for the American people, ar-
guing over which multitrillion-dollar 
spending bill they wanted to pass 
first—not if they were going to pass 
one, but which one they wanted to pass 
first. And from what I am hearing in 
Tennessee, they are saying: We don’t 
want either of these. None of this 
should ever be passed and signed into 
law. 
Those that I spoke with also wanted 
me to pass on a message. It doesn’t 
matter if they were Democrat, Repub-
lican, Independent, Libertarian. They 
said what happened here in Washington 
over the weekend was just about the 
most tone-deaf and disrespectful thing 
that they had seen take place in Wash-
ington in a long time. 
All year, Tennesseans have been ask-
ing themselves why is it that the 
Democrats are pushing so hard to 
spend more than a trillion dollars on a 
so-called infrastructure package that 
really isn’t about infrastructure? Why 
are they fighting so hard for a multi-
trillion-dollar social spending package 
that prioritizes all the wrong things? 
Tennesseans have caught on to this 
insanity. They know with absolute cer-
tainty that every time Joe Biden’s gov-
ernment steps in to take control over 
an aspect of their lives, the goal is not 
to make their lives easier. The goal is 
to complicate their lives. The goal is to 
take away some of their individual 
freedom, some of their choice. 
There is no other explanation as to 
why they would do this in the face of 
some of the issues that we have, like 
serious supply chain vulnerabilities, 
unsustainable inflation—no, it is not 
temporary—and levels of divisiveness 
and mistrust that have made even the 
most unplugged, apolitical people that 
I know sit up and speak out. 
The fact that more people are paying 
attention is really a problem for my 
Democratic 
colleagues. 
They 
know 
that there is no chance that the major-
ity of the American people will just go 
along with what it is that they are pro-
posing. 
As I said, it doesn’t matter if they 
are 
Democrat, 
Republican, 
Inde-
pendent, Libertarian. They are looking 
at this and they are saying: Hey, wait 
a minute. These guys that are over 
there, every one of them—what are 
they trying to do? They are trying to 
drive this socialist agenda, tear down 
our institutions, and build it back as a 
socialist state—which is exactly why 
the Democrats are opting for a power 
grab rather than an honest debate. 
By seizing that control and taking 
away that freedom, they are slowly but 
surely setting themselves up to rede-
fine the relationship between the peo-
ple and the government. Eventually, 
this will allow the Democrats to de-
stroy our most important institutions 
and remake them in the image of the 
grand socialist future that they are so 
desperate to build. 
If you can’t beat them—and the 
Democrats haven’t been able to beat 
the people—then what do you do? They 
go about—the Democrats—and they 
just move the goalpost. 
They have shown this intent time 
and again over the course of decades, 
but let’s start with more recent events. 
The Federal healthcare takeover de-
stroyed the concept of the doctor-pa-
tient relationship and replaced it with 
layers of bureaucracy and, now, ration-
ing. 
Over the past 3 years, my Democratic 
colleagues have tried multiple times to 
force through an election takeover bill 
that would federalize voting. That is 
right—not local control like we have 
had but federalizing elections, inten-
tionally exposing conservative voters 
to an unhinged and violent opposition 
and making the ballot box vulnerable 
to fraud. That is what they are trying 
to do. 
Earlier this year, we discovered that 
the Democrats thought that opening 
up everyone’s pocketbook for scrutiny 
by the IRS would be an acceptable way 
to pay for their so-called infrastructure 
package. It is a neat trick. It is also 
completely and utterly despicable, and 
people are not buying what the Demo-
crats are selling. They do not want so-
cialism ruling their life. They do not 
want the United States of America to 
be a socialist nation. 
The majority in this Chamber have 
accused the Republicans in this Cham-
ber of many things, and most of them 
untrue. But what is true is that we are 
indeed getting in the way of this reck-
less, destructive agenda. That is be-
cause it is our duty to protect this 
country and to protect our freedoms. 
Joe Biden and the Democratic Party 
control the entire U.S. Government. 
That is right. We had an election, and 
you are in charge. That government 
has already made it clear that—man-
date or no mandate—they have their 
eye on the prize. And that prize is to 
take away your freedom, give that over 
to the government, and leave you liv-
ing in a socialist nation. All it would 
cost is all of your money, all of your 
principles, all of your freedom. That is 
right. 
That is the future that they, the 
Democratic Party, envision for you and 
your 
family—they, 
the 
Democratic 
Party, making all the decisions; they, 
the Democratic Party, winning all the 
elections because they federalize them 
and they let the Federal Government 
decide who wins, with them in charge. 
If the Democrats wish to make those 
sacrifices, they are more than welcome 
to go about trying to do it, because the 
American people are not buying the 
agenda that they are pushing.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6886 
October 4, 2021 
Every day I talk to Tennesseans. 
What do they want? Freedom—bal-
anced freedom that allows them to ex-
perience their version of the American 
dream, that allows their children to 
dream big dreams and then live in a 
country where they can work to make 
those dreams come true. Preserving 
that is a worthy fight. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. PAUL. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from New Jersey. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 5323 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, 
in May of this year, terrorist groups in 
Gaza launched more than 4,000 rockets 
at innocent Israelis. For 11 days, 
Hamas and others fired off thousands 
of various rocket systems with little 
guidance into heavily populated areas 
across Israel with no regard, indeed, 
likely with the intention of killing ci-
vilians. 
In the face of this barrage, once 
again, Israel deployed the Iron Dome 
missile defense system, which inter-
cepted 90 percent of these incoming at-
tacks. Because of this purely defensive 
system, Israel is able to protect its own 
citizens and also direct its response to 
more carefully target those in Gaza 
who are responsible for launching these 
brutal attacks. 
Now, I have been clear: We should all 
mourn the loss of innocent Israelis and 
Palestinians who were killed during 
this conflict. Beyond a lack of regard 
for innocent Israeli civilians, Hamas 
further endangers Palestinians by hid-
ing their stockpiles and themselves in 
densely populated areas. 
But I am not here today to relitigate 
thousands of years of conflict; I am 
here to point out two simple facts: 
Hamas is a terrorist organization that 
routinely threatens innocent civilians; 
Iron Dome, a purely defensive system 
that protects civilians. It saves lives, 
regardless of religion or ethnicity, pe-
riod. 
Furthermore, by saving those lives, 
Iron Dome also preserves diplomatic 
space for deescalation, communication, 
and further negotiations about Israeli 
and Palestinian long-term security and 
the future of a negotiated two-State 
solution. 
There is no conceivable reason why 
anyone in this Chamber, on either side 
of the aisle, should stand in the way of 
U.S. support for this lifesaving defense 
to be fully ready for the next attack. 
I strongly urge my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to join the House 
of Representatives in passing this fund-
ing on a broadly bipartisan effort. 
So, therefore, Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that at a time 
to be determined by the majority lead-
er, following consultation with the Re-
publican leader, the Senate proceed to 
the consideration of Calendar No. 140, 
H.R. 5323; that there be up to 2 hours 
for debate; that upon the use or yield-
ing back of time, the bill be considered 
read a third time and the Senate vote 
on passage of the bill without inter-
vening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. PAUL. Madam President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kentucky. 
Mr. PAUL. Reserving the right to ob-
ject, I join the chairman of the Foreign 
Relations Committee in being sup-
portive of Iron Dome, but I think it 
should be paid for. 
I think the American taxpayer dol-
lars that pay for it should come from 
money that could go to the Taliban. 
There is a fund with over $6 billion in 
it that was designated for the Afghan 
Government, and that money, I think, 
could be spent on the Taliban if we do 
not rescind that money. 
The justification for my proposal for 
paying this is simple: Only an economi-
cally strong United States can be a 
militarily strong ally of Israel. 
I support Israel. I voted for hundreds 
of millions of dollars to support Iron 
Dome. I am glad the United States has 
a strong bond with Israel. But the 
United States cannot give money it 
does not have, no matter how strong 
our relationship is. 
The United States is approaching $30 
trillion in debt. Our out-of-control 
spending added $3 trillion to this debt 
just in this fiscal year. 
A day of reckoning is coming, sooner 
than you think. Interest on the debt 
will be larger than what we spent on 
national defense in just a few years. If 
the debt weakens us to the point where 
we have difficulty funding our own 
military needs, how can the United 
States continue to be a reliable ally to 
Israel? 
Getting our fiscal house in order does 
not mean that we are failing to support 
Israel—far from it. The billion dollars 
under consideration today is on top of 
the more than $1.6 billion the United 
States has already given for Iron 
Dome, and that is not all. 
The United States provides Israel 
with just under $4 billion in aid annu-
ally. To date, the United States has 
provided over $146 billion in aid to 
Israel. In addition to Iron Dome, the 
United States has helped Israel fund 
other missile defense systems as well. 
We spent $2 billion on David’s Sling 
and $3.7 billion on Arrow programs. 
That means the United States has con-
tributed $7 billion to Israel’s missile 
defense systems. 
Iron Dome is an indispensable defen-
sive tool that not only saves Israeli 
lives but Palestinian lives. I want an 
Israel strong enough so that it does not 
have to rely on American support. But 
if we are here to add an additional bil-
lion dollars in aid, all I ask is that we 
make sure that it is paid for. 
My amendment would rescind $6 bil-
lion 
in 
Afghanistan 
reconstruction 
money that otherwise might go to the 
Taliban. Secretary Blinken said as re-
cently as 2 weeks ago that this money 
may well go to the new Taliban govern-
ment. 
Under this arrangement, we would 
devote $1 billion to Israel’s Iron Dome 
and return the rest to Treasury. This is 
clear to all of the Republicans. So it 
needs to be very clear today that Re-
publicans 
support 
paying 
for 
Iron 
Dome, and they support paying for Iron 
Dome with taking away money that 
would go to the Taliban. 
I hope my colleagues will work with 
me to strengthen Israel, strengthen the 
United States, and strengthen our alli-
ance. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—PAUL 
AMENDMENT 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Senator modify his re-
quest so that instead of his proposal, 
the Senate proceed to the immediate 
consideration of Calendar No. 140, H.R. 
5323; further, that the only amendment 
in order be my substitute amendment, 
which is at the desk. I further ask that 
there be 2 hours of debate, equally di-
vided between the two leaders or their 
designees, and upon the use or yielding 
back of the time, the Paul substitute 
amendment at the desk be considered 
and agreed to, the bill, as amended, be 
considered read a third time, and the 
Senate vote on passage of the bill, as 
amended, with no intervening action or 
debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the 
Senator so modify his request? 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Reserving the right 
to object. While I respect the Senator 
from Kentucky’s consistent approach 
to foreign aid spending, his substitute 
to H.R. 5323 is problematic for the fol-
lowing reasons: This amendment would 
unleash an array of adverse con-
sequences for our broader foreign pol-
icy and national security objectives. 
This amendment ultimately proposes 
to rescind funds from the Departments 
of State and Defense. And this amend-
ment would not reallocate funds that 
would allegedly go to the Taliban, as 
the Senator from Kentucky suggests. 
The reality is that U.S. dollars are not 
going to the Taliban, nor will they. 
Let me be clear and echo what the 
administration has said: No U.S. for-
eign aid will go to a Taliban-controlled 
Afghan Government. This does not 
mean that we remain any less com-
mitted to supporting the Afghan peo-
ple. On the contrary, U.S. humani-
tarian aid could be routed through 
highly vetted partners, like the World 
Food Programme that we trust to put 
the interests of the Afghan people first. 
So let me be clear. Senator PAUL’s 
amendment would actually raid the 
funding that delivers lifesaving human-
itarian aid to the Afghan people. And 
they need it more than ever. 
Secondly, Afghanistan is in the grips 
of a dire humanitarian crisis. The econ-
omy has collapsed. One in three Af-
ghans do not know where their next

meal will come from. People are afraid 
to leave their homes. 
And so for those reasons, as well as 
the following—this amendment would 
also slash refugee assistance being used 
at this very moment to evacuate and 
resettle the U.S. allies and partners 
who served alongside Americans in the 
War on Terror. 
Likewise, Senator PAUL is proposing 
we rescind the funding that supports 
important bipartisan priorities like 
promoting 
regional 
security, 
coun-
tering Chinese influence, and ending 
this pandemic. 
And that is not all. The amendment 
also jeopardizes funds being used to re-
cover and secure U.S. military equip-
ment. 
We may no longer be funding the Af-
ghan National Army, but we still ur-
gently need these repurposed funds to 
keep American equipment out of the 
wrong hands. 
In short, Senator PAUL’s amendment 
could undermine U.S. national secu-
rity; it would abandon the Afghan peo-
ple in their darkest hour; and it would 
betray the American people’s commit-
ment to supporting our Afghan allies. 
Finally, let me just say that this 
body 
overwhelmingly 
supports 
the 
swift passage of Iron Dome. Despite 
what others may have said, even on 
this floor, Democrats in the Senate are 
not holding up this critical funding. In 
the House, there may have been a very 
small handful of bipartisan opposition. 
And the only reason it is being held up 
in this body is because of this amend-
ment. He is not a member of the Demo-
cratic caucus. 
This is a defensive, lifesaving system 
built on years of cooperation with our 
ally Israel. I am disappointed we are in 
this situation. But because of all of 
these reasons, I must object to the Sen-
ator’s substitute amendment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion to the modification is heard. 
Mr. PAUL. Madam President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection to withdrawing the request? 
Mr. PAUL. Madam President, reserv-
ing the right to object, I think it is 
very clear, and very important that it 
be very clear, that I have offered to 
fully pay for the Iron Dome system 
with an extra billion dollars. The ob-
jection is coming from the Democrat 
side. They are objecting to it being 
paid for. 
We have offered this fund of $6 bil-
lion. We have offered to modify it and 
make it less so there will still be some 
remaining money in this system. We 
have offered other funds. We have of-
fered a basically open invitation to the 
other side that we just think it ought 
to be paid for. So the objection from 
the other side is to paying for Iron 
Dome, to paying for the billion dollars. 
Interestingly, aid is already going to 
Afghanistan while the Taliban is in 
charge. Now, allegedly, that aid is 
going to charitable organizations. But 
the history of the Taliban has been to 
withhold, control, manipulate, and cor-
rupt charitable organizations as well. 
I think it is a mistake to have money 
already flowing into the new govern-
ment under the Taliban and to chari-
table organizations because it basically 
makes their job easier. It will make 
the public more pacified if they are 
being fed by the Western world. They 
wouldn’t be as happy if the money is 
destroyed in this chaos. So, really, in 
some ways, you do help to stabilize the 
Taliban by sending more money there. 
But Secretary Blinken was asked 
this very question in committee by 
myself: Can you guarantee the $6 bil-
lion will not be released at any time to 
the Taliban? 
And he said no; the implication being 
that if the Taliban behaves, he sees 
this $6 billion going to the Taliban. I 
think it is a big mistake. 
This is a big issue. Iron Dome is a big 
issue, but it is also a big issue whether 
we send money to the Taliban. They al-
ready have $80 billion worth of our 
weapons. I think it will be a real big 
mistake to send money indirectly or 
directly to the Taliban so I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Let me just simply 
say, this is a figleaf. 
We could have, today, passed Iron 
Dome as the House of Representatives 
passed it, send $1 billion, and make 
sure that Israelis and Palestinians 
would be safer as a result of the terri-
fying actions that Hamas and others 
take. There is no reason for this. 
I know my colleague has not been 
particularly supportive on foreign aid 
in general, and in this case in par-
ticular, but the reality is that we have 
an opportunity here. 
Now, I am convinced that Iron Dome 
will get done. We will get the resources 
to our allies, the State of Israel. But it 
is a shame that we have to have the 
uncertainty that is pending as a result 
of the objection that has been had. 
We don’t need to find a pathway in 
this particular way, which, you know, 
is only going to undermine our own na-
tional security interests as it relates to 
Afghanistan. 
With that I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Mr. PETERS. Madam President, I re-
quest that I am able to make my re-
marks prior to the vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF JONATHAN EUGENE MEYER 
Mr. PETERS. Madam President, I 
rise in support of Jonathan Meyer’s 
nomination to be general counsel at 
the Department of Homeland Security, 
or DHS. 
Mr. Meyer understands the unique 
challenges facing DHS, and he has the 
legal and management experience and 
vision needed to succeed in this impor-
tant role. Throughout the confirmation 
process, Mr. Meyer has demonstrated 
that he understands the complex legal 
issues facing DHS and the importance 
of ensuring the Department cooperates 
with congressional oversight. 
DHS has not had a Senate-confirmed 
general counsel for over 2 years. DHS 
needs qualified, Senate-confirmed lead-
ers in place to effectively carry out its 
critical mission of safeguarding our 
Nation. Mr. Meyer is an accomplished 
lawyer and dedicated public servant 
who is well qualified to serve as the De-
partment’s chief legal officer. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
supporting the confirmation of Jona-
than Meyer to be general counsel for 
DHS.

ARMS SALES NOTIFICATION 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, sec-
tion 36(b) of the Arms Export Control 
Act requires that Congress receive 
prior notification of certain proposed 
arms sales as defined by that statute. 
Upon such notification, the Congress 
has 30 calendar days during which the 
sale may be reviewed. The provision 
stipulates that, in the Senate, the noti-
fication of proposed sales shall be sent 
to the chairman of the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee. 
In keeping with the committee’s in-
tention to see that relevant informa-
tion is available to the full Senate, I 
ask unanimous consent to have printed 
in the RECORD the notifications which 
have been received. If the cover letter 
references a classified annex, then such

POLICY JUSTIFICATION 
Australia—EA–18G Growler Aircraft and 
Related Defense Services 
The Government of Australia has re-
quested to buy a United States Navy (USN) 
EA–18G aircraft. The USN EA–18G aircraft 
will then be modified into a Royal Aus-
tralian Air Force (RAAF) EA–18G aircraft 
configuration. The sale would include one (1) 
EA–18G Growler aircraft (Lot 38 or later) and 
engineering and modification; verification 
and validation flight test efforts; mainte-
nance and storage; U.S. Government and 
contractor engineering/technical assistance; 
related studies and analysis support; and 
other related elements of programmatic, 
technical and logistics support. The total es-
timated value is $125 million. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy and national security objectives of 
the United States. Australia is one of our 
most important allies in the Western Pa-
cific. The strategic location of this political 
and economic power contributes signifi-
cantly to ensuring peace and economic sta-
bility in the region. It is vital to the U.S. na-
tional interest to assist our ally in devel-
oping and maintaining a strong and ready 
self-defense capability. 
This proposed sale will allow Australia to 
effectively maintain its current force projec-
tion capability that enhances interoper-
ability with U.S. forces well into the future 
and maintain their original primary level of 
aircraft authorized. This aircraft would re-
place Australia’s EA–18G A46–311 aircraft 
lost in an accident at Nellis Air Force Base. 
Australia currently employs the EA–18G and 
will have no difficulty absorbing this equip-
ment into its armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this aircraft and fol-
low-on support will not alter the basic mili-
tary balance in the region. 
These aircraft will be provided from U.S. 
Navy stock. There are no known offset 
agreements proposed in connection with this 
potential sale. 
Implementation of the proposed sale will 
require U.S. Government and contractor per-
sonnel to visit Australia on a temporary 
basis in conjunction with program technical 
oversight and support requirements, includ-
ing program and technical reviews. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

as other complementary systems to provide 
one of the most capable AEA platforms in 
the world. 
2. The highest level of classification of de-
fense articles, components, and services in-
cluded in this potential sale is SECRET. 
3. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the specific 
hardware and software elements, the infor-
mation could be used to develop counter-
measures that might reduce weapon system 
effectiveness or be used in the development 
of a system with similar or advanced capa-
bilities. 
4. A determination has been made that 
Australia can provide substantially the same 
degree of protection for the sensitive tech-
nology being released as the U.S. Govern-
ment. This sale is necessary in furtherance 
of the U.S. foreign policy and national secu-
rity objectives outlined in the Policy Jus-
tification. 
5. All defense services listed in this trans-
mittal have been authorized for release and 
export to the Government of Australia.

ARMS SALES NOTIFICATION 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, sec-
tion 36(b) of the Arms Export Control 
Act requires that Congress receive 
prior notification of certain proposed 
arms sales as defined by that statute. 
Upon such notification, the Congress 
has 30 calendar days during which the 
sale may be reviewed. The provision 
stipulates that, in the Senate, the noti-
fication of proposed sales shall be sent 
to the chairman of the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee. 
In keeping with the committee’s in-
tention to see that relevant informa-
tion is available to the full Senate, I 
ask unanimous consent to have printed 
in the RECORD the notifications which 
have been received. If the cover letter 
references a classified annex, then such 
annex is available to all Senators in 
the office of the Foreign Relations 
Committee, room SD–423. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
DEFENSE SECURITY 
COOPERATION AGENCY, 
Arlington, VA. 
Hon. ROBERT MENENDEZ, 
Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations, 
U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. 
DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: Pursuant to the re-
porting requirements of Section 36(b)(5)(A) of 
the Arms Export Control Act (AECA), as 
amended, we are forwarding Transmittal No. 
0P–21. This notification relates to enhance-
ments or upgrades from the level of sensi-
tivity of technology or capability described 
in the Section 36(b)(1) AECA certification 21– 
31 of March 19, 2021. 
Sincerely, 
JEDIDIAH P. ROYAL, 
Deputy Director. 
Enclosures. 
TRANSMITTAL NO. 0P–21 
Report of Enhancement or Upgrade of Sensi-
tivity of Technology or Capability (Sec. 
36(b)(5)(A), AECA) 
(i) Purchaser: Republic of Korea. 
(ii) Sec. 36(b)(1), AECA Transmittal No.: 
21–31; Date: March 19, 2021; Military Depart-
ment: Army. 
(iii) Description: On March 19, 2021, Con-
gress was notified by Congressional certifi-
cation transmittal number 21–31, of the pos-
sible sale under Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms 
Export Control Act of two hundred eighty- 
eight (288) AGM-114R Hellfire missiles. Also 
included were AGM-l14R spare parts; U.S. 
Government and contractor engineering, 
technical, and logistics support services; re-
pair and return; storage; and other related 
elements of logistical and program support. 
The estimated total cost was $36 million. 
Major Defense Equipment (MDE) constituted 
$33 million of this total. 
This transmittal reports a value increase 
due to a decrease in global requests for 
Hellfire missiles, which negatively impact 
Hellfire production economies of scale. The 
estimated total increase in MDE value is $9 
million, resulting in a new MDE total of $42 
million. The total notified case value will in-
crease to $47 million. 
(iv) Significance: This notification is being 
provided as the pricing for the original noti-
fication was outdated and requires an in-
crease. 
(v) Justification: This proposed sale will 
support the foreign policy and national secu-
rity objectives of the United States by meet-
ing the legitimate security and defense needs 
of 
one 
of 
the 
closest 
allies 
in 
the 
INDOPACOM Theater. The ROK is one of the 
major political and economic powers in East 
Asia and the Western Pacific and a key part-
ner of the United States in ensuring peace 
and stability in that region. It is vital to 
U.S. national interests to assist the ROK in 
developing and maintaining a strong and 
ready self-defense capability. 
(vi) Sensitivity of Technology: The Sensi-
tivity of Technology Statement contained in 
the original notification applies to items re-
ported here. 
(vii) Date Report Delivered to Congress: 
October 1, 2021.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING JUSTICE CORNELIA 
A. ‘‘CONNIE’’ CLARK 
∑ Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, it 
is with a heavy heart that I take these 
next few moments to honor the life and 
legacy of and my personal friendship 
with Justice Cornelia A. ‘‘Connie’’ 
Clark. We lost Connie last month to a 
short battle with cancer. 
Justice Clark was a trailblazer in the 
Tennessee judiciary. Her public service 
spanned more than four decades and 
culminated in a long and happy tenure 
on 
the 
Tennessee 
Supreme 
Court, 
where she served as chief justice from 
2010–2012. In the days since we lost 
Connie, her friends on the bench have 
shared fond memories of a woman who 
was cheerful, humble, diligent, and 
strong in her faith, and who ap-
proached her role as a jurist with grace 
and equanimity. 
Over the course of her distinguished 
career, Justice Clark prioritized ensur-
ing access to justice. As a result of her 
compassionate 
advocacy, 
the 
once- 
cluttered path to the courthouse is 
clear for the thousands of men and 
women who climb its steps each year. 
She was an early and fierce advocate 
for women in the legal profession, 
throwing open doors for her peers and 
serving as a powerful role model for 
young women and girls. In 2005, she 
helped usher in a new era for the bench 
when she became the fourth woman to 
serve on the Tennessee Supreme Court. 
Since 2008, the Court has boasted a fe-
male-majority bench. 
On behalf of the entire Tennessee 
congressional delegation, I offer pray-
ers and condolences to Connie’s family 
and friends. 
Rest in peace, Connie, and thank you 
for dedicating your life to the relent-
less pursuit of justice for all Ten-
nesseans.∑

RECOGNIZING CITY LIMITS BREW 
PUB 
∑ Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, as a mem-
ber and former chairman of the Senate 
Committee on Small Business and En-
trepreneurship, each month, I recog-
nize and celebrate the American entre-
preneurial spirit by highlighting the 
success of a small business in my home 
State of Idaho. Today, I am pleased to 
honor City Limits Brew Pub in Wallace 
as the Idaho Small Business of the 
Month for October 2021. 
Nestled in the beautiful north Idaho 
town of Wallace, City Limits is a res-
taurant and brewery known for its ex-
tensive selection of beer, food, and 
amenities. For years, founder and cur-
rent 
brewmaster 
Mark 
Burmeister 
brewed beer as a hobby while working 
in the oil industry. After retiring, he 
continued working and set out to es-
tablish his own beer brewing business. 
In 2008, he obtained a brewery license 
and opened a microbrewery in his ga-
rage. Equipped with a 10-gallon brew-
ing system, he crafted an assortment of 
micro brews and distributed them to 
local businesses and taps. People loved 
the microbrews, and demand soared. 
With growing sales and the need to 
expand, a group of partners joined in 
and purchased a new building and an 
adjacent RV park in Wallace in 2010. 
Led by partner Don Hoffman, the group 
remodeled the building and opened the 
business under its new name, City Lim-
its Pub. They installed a new 217-gallon 
brewing system along with a new bath-
room facility and log cabins to the RV 
site. The business formally changed its 
name to City Limits Brew Pub in 2015 
and has become a thriving restaurant, 
pub, and attraction for thousands of 
locals and visitors every year. 
City Limits Brew Pub is beloved in 
the Silver Valley. The business pro-
vides tours of the brewery, provides 
local drinks, and serves family-friendly 
food options for guests. City Limits is 
also heavily involved in the Wallace 
community. The business hosts several 
community events like its Oktoberfest 
celebration and its biennial Welcome 
Back to Summer Town BBQ, where 
local businesses showcase their upcom-
ing summer events. City Limits also 
supports local community causes and 
has contributed to several charities 
over the years. The small business 
looks forward to continuing to serve 
guests and the community well into 
the future.

S6895 
October 4, 2021 
Mr. CRAMER, Mr. DAINES, Mr. HAGERTY, 
Mr. HAWLEY, Mrs. HYDE-SMITH, Mr. 
INHOFE, Mr. LANKFORD, Ms. LUMMIS, 
Mr. RUBIO, Mr. SCOTT of Florida, Mr. 
SCOTT of South Carolina, Mr. WICKER, 
Mr. YOUNG, and Mr. BARRASSO) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which 
was referred to the Committee on the 
Judiciary: 
S. RES. 407 
Whereas the free exercise of religion is an 
inherent, fundamental, and inalienable right 
protected by the First Amendment to the 
Constitution of the United States; 
Whereas the United States has long recog-
nized that the free exercise of religion is im-
portant to the intellectual, ethical, moral, 
and civic development of individuals in the 
United States, as evidenced by Founders of 
the United States, such as— 
(1) Benjamin Franklin, who believed reli-
gion to be ‘‘uniquely capable of educating a 
citizenry for democracy’’; and 
(2) George Washington, who said in his 
farewell address, ‘‘Of all the dispositions and 
habits which lead to political prosperity, re-
ligion and morality are indispensable sup-
ports.’’; 
Whereas religious education is useful for 
self-development, because it asks students to 
consider and respond to questions concerning 
the meaning and purpose of life, engages stu-
dents in questions about morality and jus-
tice, and enables students to identify their 
values; 
Whereas studies like the one published by 
the International Journal of Mental Health 
Systems in 2019 have shown that religious 
education can be ‘‘instrumental to improv-
ing adolescent mental health’’ by helping 
children learn how to make decisions based 
on morals, promoting less risky choices, and 
encouraging connectedness within a commu-
nity, which can enhance self-esteem and 
well-being; 
Whereas religious education fosters respect 
for other religious groups and individuals 
generally by acknowledging a source for 
human dignity and worth; 
Whereas the Supreme Court of the United 
States found in Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 
268 U.S. 510 (1925), that the state does not 
have power ‘‘to standardize its children by 
forcing them to accept instruction from pub-
lic teachers only. The child is not the mere 
creature of the state; those who nurture him 
and direct his destiny have the right, cou-
pled with the high duty, to recognize and 
prepare him for additional obligations.’’; 
Whereas religious instruction can come 
from a variety of sources, including sec-
tarian schools and released time programs; 
Whereas, according to the National Center 
for Education Statistics, in 2015, 4,350,000 
children in the United States attended sec-
tarian elementary and secondary schools 
where those children received religious edu-
cation; and 
Whereas the Supreme Court of the United 
States held in Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U.S. 306 
(1952), that State statutes providing for the 
release of public school students from school 
to attend religious classes are constitu-
tional, and, as a result, an estimated 540,000 
public school students in the United States 
take advantage of released time programs 
each year: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) affirms the importance of religious edu-
cation in the civic and moral development of 
the people of the United States; 
(2) celebrates the schools and organizations 
that are engaged in religious instruction of 
the children of the United States to aid 
those children in intellectual, ethical, moral, 
and civic development; 
(3) calls on each of the 50 States, each ter-
ritory of the United States, and the District 
of Columbia to accommodate individuals 
who wish to be released from public school 
attendance to attend religious classes; and 
(4) designates the week of October 3, 2021, 
through October 9, 2021, as ‘‘Religious Edu-
cation Week’’.
