PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Your love, Lord, reaches to the heav-
ens, Your faithfulness to the skies. 
Your righteousness is like the highest 
mountains, Your justice like the great 
deep. 
Give us eyes of faith that we may 
look to the heavens and know Your 
love, hearts that we may enjoy Your 
faithfulness. Grant us strength that we 
would climb the highest mountain to 
learn of Your righteousness, courage 
that we would plunge the great deep to 
exercise Your justice. 
How priceless is Your unfailing love, 
O God. People take refuge in the shad-
ow of Your wings. They feast on the 
abundance of Your house; You give 
them drink from the river of delights. 
Holy Lord, even as You provide shel-
ter and food and drink for us this day, 
may we serve to be the extension of 
Your wings of refuge. May we share the 
bounty of our own larders and give 
water to those who thirst for the re-
freshment of Your own living water. 
For with You is the fountain of life; 
in Your light we see light. 
Hear our prayer this day that we may 
reflect the light of Your sacred name. 
Amen.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. GARCIA) 
come forward and lead the House in the 
Pledge of Allegiance. 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas led the Pledge 
of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE 
A message from the Senate by Ms. 
BYRD, one of its clerks, announced that 
the Senate has passed a bill of the fol-
lowing title in which the concurrence 
of the House is requested: 
S. 4160. An act to amend title 40, United 
States Code, to grant the Supreme Court of 
the United States security-related authori-
ties equivalent to the legislative and execu-
tive branches. 
f 
WE MUST NOT GO BACK 
(Ms. GARCIA of Texas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise with outrage at the recent cruel 
attack on women’s reproductive rights. 
Through a leak, we have learned 
about the Supreme Court draft opinion 
that would terrifyingly overturn Roe v. 
Wade if finalized. This is shocking. 
You see, I know what happens when 
Republicans strip reproductive rights 
away from women. I have seen it in my 
home State of Texas, which has the 
strictest reproductive healthcare laws 
in the country, S.B. 8. 
Each month, nearly 1,500 Texans are 
forced into such desperation where 
they travel to surrounding States for a 
chance to receive their healthcare. 
Many times these Texans are forced to 
travel in unsafe conditions, putting 
themselves in harm’s way. 
Mr. Speaker, we will not go back. We 
must not go back. I urge my Senate 
colleagues to codify Roe v. Wade into 
law. We must protect a woman’s right 
to reproductive healthcare. 
f 
RECOGNIZING NATIONAL POLICE 
WEEK 
(Mr. MCCARTHY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, crime 
and the fear of crime impacts the lives 
of every American. 
We know its rising pace: carjackings 
at record highs; smash-and-grab rob-
beries surging; and at least 12 major 
cities breaking homicide records in 
2021. 
We know its price in dollar terms: 
$200 billion annually in a regressive 
crime tax. 
We know its widespread costs to fam-
ilies who are afraid to walk the streets 
at night. 
We know the tragic costs it inflicts 
in death and suffering. 
And we know its root cause: soft-on- 
crime policies, far-left prosecutors, and 
radical Democrats. From Seattle and 
Portland to New York City and Wash-
ington, D.C., Democrats have failed the 
first duty of government. They have 
failed to keep citizens safe. 
Now, some House Democrats want to 
erase their own soft-on-crime record, 
but the American people will not be 
fooled. This Congress, 219 House Demo-
crats voted for a bill that would cost 
local police departments hundreds of 
millions of dollars.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4726 
May 10, 2022 
The American people can’t afford 
Democrats’ radical agenda of fewer po-
lice officers on the streets, fewer crimi-
nals behind bars, more victims of vio-
lent crime. 
Our police officers can’t afford it ei-
ther. Last year, more officers were 
murdered in the line of duty during 
President Biden’s first year in office 
than at any point since 1995. 
Mr. Speaker, let me say that again. 
Last year, more officers were murdered 
in the line of duty during President 
Biden’s first year in office than at any 
point since 1995. 
One of those officers was Kern Coun-
ty 
Sheriff’s 
Office 
Deputy 
Phillip 
Campas. He was a rising star who was 
killed in the line of duty last year after 
his SWAT team responded to a domes-
tic violence call. He leaves behind a 
wife and a young family. 
He grew up in my hometown, and he 
went to the exact same elementary 
school and junior high that I did. 
Campas was a bright example of what 
it means to serve others. Fittingly, 
this year, his name was added to the 
Roll Call of Heroes on the National 
Peace Officers’ Memorial in Wash-
ington, D.C. 
To Deputy Campas’ children, we can-
not begin to imagine your sadness and 
pain, but I want you to know this: 
Your father was a hero. We will never 
forget him. 
Mr. Speaker, the solution to safer 
communities is the exact opposite of 
Democrats’ radical agenda. This crime 
crisis deserves serious leadership, and 
it starts with stepping up and sup-
porting law enforcement. 
Our brave officers face enormous 
challenges, yet they choose to wear the 
uniform every day. It is not enough to 
fully fund them. They must know we 
have their backs. 
So, as National Police Week begins, I 
want to say something our law enforce-
ment officers don’t hear enough: Thank 
you. Thank you for protecting our 
communities. Thank you for protecting 
our children. Thank you for protecting 
our country. 
While radical Democrats want to 
defund, demonize, and abolish the po-
lice, Republicans salute you, and we 
will always support you. 
f 
RANGERS LEAD THE WAY 
(Mr. CROW asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CROW. Mr. Speaker, as a former 
Army Ranger, I rise today in support of 
S. 1872, a bill to award United States 
Army Rangers veterans of World War II 
a Congressional Gold Medal. 
In World War II, the U.S. Army 
formed six all-volunteer Ranger battal-
ions and one provisional battalion. 
Some of the most important battles of 
the war relied on their skill, sacrifice, 
and unending courage. 
They fought throughout Europe, in-
cluding 
D-day 
landings 
at 
Omaha 
Beach, and liberated 500 prisoners from 
a Japanese POW camp in the Phil-
ippines known as the Great Raid. 
Of the 7,000 Rangers who served in 
World War II, only 15 are alive today. 
They live across our Nation, on each 
coast and in the heartland. 
As an Army Ranger who followed in 
their immense footsteps, I thank them 
for their service, sacrifice, and exam-
ple. 
I also thank Senator ERNST for her 
partnership on this bill, and I urge my 
colleagues to join me in supporting its 
passage when it comes to a vote today. 
‘‘Rangers Lead the Way.’’ 
f 
HONORING NATIONAL CHARTER 
SCHOOL WEEK 
(Ms. FOXX asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, in honor of 
National Charter School Week, I am 
here to talk about the importance of 
school choice. 
Families should be empowered to 
find the best learning environments for 
their children instead of being forced 
into failing public schools that may 
not meet their child’s needs. 
Piedmont 
Community 
Charter 
School, located in Gaston County, 
North Carolina, is an amazing example 
of a school that puts students first. 
This school isn’t afraid to hold its stu-
dents to a high standard or to provide 
a challenging curriculum. 
Schools like Piedmont should inspire 
us all to renew and strengthen our sup-
port for education freedom. Instead of 
trapping children in a race to the bot-
tom, charter schools like Piedmont are 
pushing students to the top. More op-
tions mean more successful students. 
Happy 
National 
Charter 
School 
Week. 
f 
ENVISIONING A POST-ROE 
COUNTRY 
(Ms. BROWN of Ohio asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, 
the horrifying reality is that, in a mat-
ter of weeks, we could live in a post- 
Roe country, a country where women 
no longer have the fundamental right 
to make decisions about their own bod-
ies; a country where women no longer 
have control over when and how to 
start a family; a country where women 
will suddenly face government inter-
ference in their personal lives, their 
privacy, and their freedom. 
Overturning Roe will not eliminate 
the need for abortion; it will simply 
eliminate access to safe, legal abortion 
care. And it will take the worst toll on 
poor women, women of color, and oth-
ers who already face countless barriers 
to healthcare. 
Decisions about a woman’s body are 
deeply personal. They should not be 
controlled by politicians. Every person, 
no matter where they live, how much 
money they make, or what they look 
like, deserves the right to make their 
own decisions about their health, life, 
and future. 
f 
RECOGNIZING F.O. BARDEN & SON 
LUMBER’S 
CENTENNIAL 
MILE-
STONE 
(Mr. BERGMAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize 100 years of stellar 
performance of an exemplary company 
in 
Michigan’s 
First 
District, 
F.O. 
Barden & Son Lumber. 
Since its founding in 1922 by Frank 
Barden, the company has become a 
vital component in helping Boyne City 
and northern Michigan grow and adapt 
to needs in all aspects of daily life. 
This centennial milestone represents 
the years of service that Barden Lum-
ber has dedicated to contributing to 
the economic well-being of the area 
and the lives of countless residents. 
In reflecting on the company’s 100- 
year history, it is clear that they have 
continually chosen to not only make 
decisions for the good of the company 
in the wake of a changing marketplace, 
but they have also proven capable of 
looking beyond the balance sheet to in-
clude the ideas and the ideals of its 
people and community. 
Even as our cyclical Michigan econ-
omy has presented obstacles to its 
growth, F.O. Barden & Son Lumber has 
sustained itself through dedication and 
innovation. 
We are grateful for the company’s 
contributions to Boyne City and to all 
of Michigan. Thank you, F.O. Barden & 
Son.

b 1415 
FAREWELL TO CONGRESS 
(Mr. REED asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. REED. Mr. Speaker, after almost 
12 years in Congress, today is my last 
day. It has been an honor to serve with 
you all from both parties. I love this 
institution as it still exemplifies what 
is best about our government. We are 
the people’s House. While I am proud 
that we put people before politics, 
there is much more to do. I am leaving 
to continue that work and hope to have 
a greater impact on our country. 
I believe the current focus on extre-
mism demands us to heed the words 
Abraham Lincoln uttered years ago as 
we face a similar threat to our exist-
ence today—a house divided cannot 
stand. But I add—a house united will 
not fail. It is time for petty political 
posturing to end. Leadership must 
emerge and in God I trust. His divine 
protection will extend again if only we 
acknowledge and accept His love and 
the divine spark that exists in each of 
us as citizens of our great Nation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4727 
May 10, 2022 
I thank my family, who without 
their love and support I am nothing. I 
also thank the people who have worked 
for us and helped so many. I am grate-
ful. 
My most profound appreciation is for 
the people of western New York. Thank 
you for giving a country lawyer, the 
youngest of 12, raised by a single moth-
er, whose father passed away when I 
was just 2 years old, the honor of rep-
resenting you at the highest level. 
Only in America can such a dream 
come true. 
I humbly bid farewell and submit my 
resignation as a Member of the House. 
I wish you all Godspeed. 
f 
SUPREME COURT LEAK 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. The leak of the Su-
preme Court’s draft opinion on the 
Dobbs case is a betrayal of confidence 
between the Justices, the deliberative 
process, and the public. 
No matter what side of the aisle you 
are on or what side of the issue, every-
one should find it reprehensible that 
such an assault on our judicial system 
could even occur. 
The leak breaks down the ability of 
our Nation’s highest court to objec-
tively examine on all sides and come to 
clear answers on the constitutionality 
of serious issues. 
Justices consider very serious topics, 
such as the Dobbs case; they should be 
allowed 
to 
freely 
debate 
amongst 
themselves and hypothesize in their de-
liberations. 
I expect a full investigation into this 
leak, and I condemn this attempt to 
undermine the American judicial proc-
ess. This leak has caused protesters to 
now threaten the Justices’ families at 
their homes and where they go. 
Yet, what do we get? Silence from 
the Biden administration. I guess if it 
falls on the side of issues and topics 
they agree with, it isn’t violence, it is 
just merely protest and strong feelings. 
What hypocrisy. We must put an end to 
this right now and have a full inves-
tigation so they can do their judicial 
process in safety and without any kind 
of false influence. 
f 
CONGRATULATING NAVAL AIR 
STATION PENSACOLA 
(Mr. GAETZ asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate the men and 
women of Naval Air Station Pensacola 
on being named Navy Installations 
Command’s Large Installation of the 
Year. 
I am continuously in awe of the dedi-
cation and patriotism our servicemem-
bers and defense civilians display day- 
in and day-out to ensure the defense of 
our great Nation and advance the cause 
of liberty. 
The patriots of NAS Pensacola con-
ducted 50,000 operations in fiscal year 
2021 without mishap. An astonishing 
feat given the inherently dangerous na-
ture of military training. 
The 
installation 
established 
the 
Emergency Family Assistance Center 
to provide relief and aid in the recov-
ery, shelter, and assistance of 267 Hur-
ricane Sally victims. We ask our serv-
icemembers and their families to sac-
rifice so much, and the ability to de-
compress and enjoy leisure time with 
family and friends is critical to their 
well-being and readiness. To that end, 
NAS Pensacola’s morale, welfare, and 
recreation department received a five- 
star rating and was ranked number one 
among large bases. 
Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct privi-
lege to serve Florida’s First Congres-
sional District and to represent the 
brave men and women of NAS Pensa-
cola. The best is yet to come. 
f 
HONORING ANN THOMAS 
(Mr. FERGUSON asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Mrs. Ann Thomas, a 
dedicated educator, who will be retir-
ing after 43 years as a math teacher at 
Springwood High School. 
Mrs. Thomas is someone who chal-
lenges her students to look beyond the 
pages of the textbook and to become 
problem-solvers and critical thinkers. 
Every day her tenacity, her passion, 
and dedication impact each and every 
one of her students. 
As a math teacher, she ensured that 
young people would have the knowl-
edge and skills to not only help them 
succeed in the classroom, but to be em-
powered to become productive mem-
bers of society. 
Mr. Speaker, I am a proud alumnus 
of Springwood High School in many 
ways because of her. In honor of her 43 
years of remarkable service, I thank 
and commend Mrs. Thomas for her re-
lentless commitment to mathematics 
education and for helping the next gen-
eration of young students succeed. 
f 
REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF 
MELINDA GAY POWELL 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to remember the life of 
an 
incredible 
and 
selfless 
woman, 
Melinda Powell, affectionately referred 
to as ‘‘Sweet Melinda.’’ 
A nurse and nurse practitioner by 
trade, Melinda led by example, setting 
an unparalleled standard of love and 
service, enriching the lives of her 
friends, family, and community mem-
bers. 
Melinda resided in Savannah, Geor-
gia, where she remained an active 
member of the Savannah community 
for many years. She was a caring 
woman who looked after her patients 
like they were her own family. 
She left a lasting impression on ev-
eryone that she encountered and was 
deeply loved by all who had the pleas-
ure of knowing her. Her service and 
love for our community will forever be 
remembered and her memory will al-
ways be cherished. 
My thoughts and prayers reside with 
Melinda’s family and friends through 
this most tremendous loss, and I wish 
her Godspeed on her journey home.

vacy enhancing technologies and pro-
mote responsible data use, and for 
other purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 847 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Promoting Dig-
ital Privacy Technologies Act’’. 
SEC. 2. DEFINITION OF PRIVACY ENHANCING 
TECHNOLOGY. 
In this Act, the term ‘‘privacy enhancing tech-
nology’’— 
(1) means any software or hardware solution,

PORT OF RESEARCH ON PRIVACY EN-
HANCING TECHNOLOGY. 
The Director of the National Science Founda-
tion, in consultation with other relevant Federal 
agencies (as determined by the Director), shall 
support 
merit-reviewed 
and 
competitively 
awarded research on privacy enhancing tech-
nologies, which may include— 
(1) fundamental research on technologies for 
de-identification, 
pseudonymization, 
anonymization, or obfuscation to mitigate indi-
viduals’ privacy risks in data sets while main-
taining fairness, accuracy, and efficiency; 
(2) fundamental research on algorithms and 
other similar mathematical tools used to protect 
individual privacy when collecting, storing, 
sharing, analyzing, or aggregating data;

preferences, requirements, and human behavior 
to inform the design and adoption of effective 
privacy solutions; 
(7) development of freely available privacy en-
hancing technology software libraries, plat-
forms, and applications; and 
(8) fundamental research on techniques that 
may undermine the protections provided by pri-
vacy enhancing technologies, the limitations of 
the protections provided by privacy enhancing 
technologies, and the trade-offs between privacy 
and utility required for their deployment. 
SEC. 4. INTEGRATION INTO THE COMPUTER AND 
NETWORK SECURITY PROGRAM.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Ms. STEVENS) and the gen-
tlewoman from Oklahoma (Mrs. BICE) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Michigan. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on H.R. 847, the bill 
now under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Michigan? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 847, the Promoting Digital Pri-
vacy Technologies Act. 
The 21st century has ushered in the 
era of hyper-internet utilization, the 
gig economy of nearly everything. 
Americans are online. Practically 
any digital action that internet users 
take—from social media to shopping 
online to browsing news or using 
email—creates data that is stored by 
companies or organizations. More and 
more data about each of us is being 
generated faster and faster each day. In 
fact, 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are 
generated nearly every day. Ninety 
percent of the world’s data was created 
in just the last 2 years alone. 
Companies can use, share, or sell 
data they collect since most of the 
data economy is invisible—Americans 
are not able to see this constant flow of 
their information, but the more mod-
ern digital economy is fueled by per-
sonal data. 
Unfortunately, there are few proc-
esses that can enable the productive 
use of personal data while also pro-
tecting the privacy and confidentiality 
of the people to whom that data is 
linked. 
A 2019 survey by the National Tele-
communications and Information Ad-
ministration found that 73 percent of 
U.S. households have significant con-
cerns about online privacy and security 
risks. I hear it from my own constitu-
ents all throughout Oakland County, 
Michigan. 
There are tremendous opportunities 
to capture the benefits of data, includ-
ing for safer roads, improved public 
health, and better educational out-
comes. However, in any use of personal 
data, we have the ability and the ne-
cessity to ensure privacy and confiden-
tiality. Form and function, my friends. 
One key way to achieve that is through 
the development of the privacy-en-
hancing technologies, or PETs. 
PETs are a broad range of tech-
nologies that allow organizations to 
collect, share, and use data while miti-
gating the privacy risks that arise 
from those activities. The goal is to 
make these systems that use personal 
information private by default, opening 
up those data to a wide range of re-
searchers who would otherwise not 
have access.

These technologies have the poten-
tial to enable broader use of Federal 
data sets, as privacy risks are often the 
greatest barrier to open government 
data efforts. We recognize the untapped 
potential 
and 
opportunity 
for 
the 
United States of America to lead here. 
The technology itself for PETs is still 
immature and not necessarily ready for 
widespread use. 
My bill, H.R. 847, the Promoting Dig-
ital Privacy Technologies Act, sup-
ports research, workforce development, 
standard setting, and government co-
ordination for PETs. 
H.R. 847 directs the National Science 
Foundation to conduct fundamental 
privacy research that can help improve 
these technologies, assess their limita-
tions, and broaden their applicability. 
This bill also directs the National 
Science Foundation to support work-
force development activities in order 
to help address the growing shortage of 
privacy professionals across the United 
States of America. 
H.R. 847 also supports activities at 
the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology to facilitate the devel-
opment of standards and best practices 
for integration of PETs in the public 
and private sectors. This is the best of 
government in action, my friends. 
Finally, H.R. 847 directs the White 
House Office of Science and Tech-
nology Policy to coordinate Federal 
activities to accelerate the develop-
ment of PETs across government. 
Congress has been debating different 
proposals for privacy legislation, as we 
know, for many, many years. I remain 
hopeful and optimistic that we will get 
something done. In the meantime, the 
Promoting 
Digital 
Privacy 
Tech-
nologies Act will help ensure that we 
have the necessary tools to fully imple-
ment privacy legislation without sti-
fling innovation. It is high time that 
we research ways in which privacy-en-
hancing technologies can be utilized to 
protect Americans’ most sensitive and 
personal data. 
b 1430 
I also thank my colleagues—this has 
been a bipartisan effort—Congressman 
ANTHONY GONZALEZ, as well as Senator 
CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO and Senator 
DEB FISCHER, for working with me to 
develop this legislation last year. I also 
thank our stakeholders whose feedback 
helped strengthen this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support H.R. 847, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
847, the Promoting Digital Privacy 
Technologies Act. This legislation sup-
ports research activities to advance in-
novative technologies to safeguard in-
dividuals’ privacy. 
As Americans have moved more and 
more of their lives online, especially 
during the pandemic, it has also re-
sulted in more digital consumer data 
and personal information being gen-
erated than ever before. 
This personal information has long 
been a target for cybercriminals, and it 
has only worsened over the pandemic. 
According to the Federal Trade Com-
mission, identify theft increased by al-
most 3,000 percent over the past year. 
This problem is exacerbated by the 
failure of some companies to properly 
safeguard consumer data. 
This data is a valuable asset. In 2017 
‘‘The Economist’’ claimed data is now 
the world’s most valuable resource. 
When safely utilized, it can do a great 
deal to spur our economy and support 
innovations like artificial intelligence 
and machine learning. Our task is to 
ensure this resource doesn’t fall into 
the hands of bad actors, putting Ameri-
cans’ private information at risk. 
Privacy 
Enhancing 
Technologies, 
PETs, may be part of the solution. 
PETs utilize cryptography and statis-
tics to minimize the amount of person-
ally identifiable information while en-
suring the data sets are still usable. 
However, more research is needed to 
understand PETs’ applicability and to 
encourage further development and 
adoption. 
This 
bill 
requires 
the 
National 
Science Foundation to support funda-
mental research into PETs, the mathe-
matics that is the foundation of PETs, 
and additional technologies that pro-
mote data minimization principles. 
The legislation also directs NIST to 
work with stakeholders to develop vol-
untary consensus standards for incor-
porating these technologies into Fed-
eral and commercial applications. 
I thank Chairwoman STEVENS
and 
Representative GONZALEZ
for leading 
this very important legislation. I en-
courage my colleagues to support this 
bill. 
In closing, Mr. Speaker, while the 
data revolution offers an opportunity 
to solve many of the world’s grand 
challenges, we must also ensure these 
innovations don’t put Americans’ pri-
vate information at risk. By sup-
porting further research on privacy-en-
hancing technologies through this leg-
islation, we are taking important steps 
to strengthen consumer privacy while 
enabling the use of consumer data. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this bill, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I join my colleague in 
encouraging Members of this legisla-
tive body to support H.R. 847. I recog-
nize 
that 
privacy-enhancing 
tech-
nologies are an innovation opportunity 
for the United States of America. The 
role that the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology will play 
with this legislation will convene in-
dustry 
stakeholders 
and 
nonprofit 
groups to a standard set, which is cer-
tainly welcome by many, and will also 
ensure us the ability to continue to 
succeed and compete in years to come. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. 
STEVENS) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 847, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Mr. Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

Michigan (Ms. STEVENS) and the gen-
tlewoman from Oklahoma (Mrs. BICE) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Michigan. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and to in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 5324, 
the bill now under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Michigan? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I voice my support for this bipartisan 
legislation led by Ranking Member 
BICE and Chairwoman SHERRILL of the 
Science, Space, and Technology Com-
mittee’s Environment Subcommittee. 
The NWR Modernization Act of 2021 
will direct NOAA to undertake various 
updates to the NOAA Weather Radio. 
NOAA Weather Radio serves as a con-
sistent and reliable source of weather 
forecasts, warnings, and watches from 
the National Weather Service to com-
munities across America—something 
that is all too palpable to Americans 
today given the rise of extreme weath-
er incidents. 
Because of its broad reach and con-
tinuous 
coverage, 
NOAA 
Weather 
Radio also provides information re-
lated to natural disasters and other 
hazardous, nonweather events. In order 
to ensure that NOAA Weather Radio 
can continue to provide reliable, life- 
saving information, it is vital to ensure 
the system is upgraded to reflect the 
modern era. This bill requires NOAA to 
require more transmitters and update 
vital software and telecommunications 
infrastructure to support operation of 
NOAA Weather Radio and enhance its 
transmission of nonweather emergency 
messages. These updates should help to 
expand NOAA Weather Radio coverage 
to ensure all communities, especially 
underserved rural communities, re-
ceive these critical alerts. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill will provide 
benefits to many across this incredible 
country. I urge my colleagues to join 
me in supporting its passage, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5324, the NOAA 
Weather Radio Modernization Act, is 
dedicated to supporting, upgrading, 
and modernizing one of the best alert 
systems we have for extreme weather 
and other dangerous events. 
The NOAA Weather Radio All Haz-
ards system, known as NWR, is a high-
ly successful, nationwide network of 
stations that broadcasts natural, envi-
ronmental, and safety alerts to the 
public through radio broadcast fre-
quencies. 
Whether it is an earthquake, tor-
nado, chemical release, oil spill, or 
AMBER Alert, the NWR broadcasts 24 
hours a day, 7 days a week to 95 per-
cent of the U.S. population. It is life-
saving and informative to everyone, no 
matter their location. Simply put, 
NWR is the single source for com-
prehensive weather and emergency in-
formation. 
Many of my constituents in Okla-
homa heard alerts through their Na-
tional Weather Radio receiver last 
week when severe weather and torna-
does struck Seminole County in the 
late evening. Thankfully, there have 
been no reported casualties, and that is 
due in large part to citizens heeding 
the warnings of the NWR. 
The NWR is consistent, as it operates 
even when the power goes out and cell 
service is down. It is also trusted be-
cause of its accuracy and long track 
record of saving lives. But as with all 
technology, it needs to be upgraded and 
modernized to remain just as effective 
in the future as well as ensure current 
outages are short and infrequent. 
It was almost three decades ago, in 
the late 1990s, that the NWR network 
received its last upgrade. Since that 
time, 
operations 
and 
maintenance 
costs related to transmitters and an-
tennas have increased. It should be ob-
vious that technology has greatly ad-
vanced, as the very first iPhone wasn’t 
available when these upgrades took 
place. 
As the world becomes more digi-
talized, we must ensure that older sys-
tems like this that protect lives and 
property don’t get lost in the shuffle. 
That is why I introduced this legisla-
tion. H.R. 5324 authorizes upgrades to 
the existing system through timely re-
pairs and ensures that the reliable in-
frastructure in place is not abandoned. 
This will help outages become less 
common. 
Mr. Speaker, to give you an idea of 
this need, right before coming down 
here, I checked the NWR’s website to 
see that 19 transmitters are currently 
out of service, and nine are experi-
encing degraded signal. That means 28 
areas and surrounding communities are 
at risk of severe events with minimal 
warning. 
This legislation also establishes a 
modernization initiative for broadcasts 
to transmit to IP-based communica-
tions and develop options for backup 
capabilities and enhanced signal trans-
mission. This paves the way for future 
development and provides failsafe op-
tions, so NWR is never down for an ex-
tended period of time. 
Last but not least, H.R. 5324 requires 
NOAA to conduct an assessment of 
NWR access. This will ensure that the 
modernization efforts are effective and 
people across the country have easy, 
reliable access in a manner that is in 
line with modern technology. 
The benefits of the National Weather 
Radio right now are numerous. The sig-
nal can easily reach and educate vul-
nerable communities. It can cover both 
land and marine warnings. And when a 
disaster is over, NWR can issue an all-

clear for a community that might be 
battered, but whose people are safe. 
Therefore, we should ensure its contin-
ued use by supporting its reliability 
and efforts to bring the system into the 
21st century. I am proud to have intro-
duced this legislation that does exactly 
that and will protect the lives of Okla-
homans, as well as communities across 
the Nation. 
I 
thank 
the 
Environment 
Sub-
committee Chairwoman SHERRILL for 
leading this bill with me and for her ef-
forts to work across the aisle for its 
passage. I also thank Representatives 
KILMER, 
LATURNER, 
BONAMICI, 
and 
ELLZEY for cosponsoring it. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues 
to support this bipartisan legislation, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I will to take a moment 
to reflect. The Congresswoman from 
Oklahoma mentioned something that I 
believe is important to reiterate, which 
is that the technology adoptions oc-
curred before the iPhone. Last June, in 
Oakland County, Michigan, the city of 
Farmington and Farmington Hills ex-
perienced an extreme weather event 
otherwise known as a supercell. This is 
rapid winds at a high level, multiple— 
hundreds of feet, sometimes up in the 
air, ripping large trees from their 
roots. It was very destructive. There 
was no warning. It terrified residents 
of my district. 
We also reflect that in Mason City, 
Iowa, just last month, there was a 
major tornado that blew through, 
again, without warning. So this is very 
real and palpable to the American peo-
ple. 
I again recognize the leadership of 
the Congresswoman from New Jersey 
(Ms. 
SHERRILL), 
who 
is 
the 
sub-
committee chair of the Environment 
Subcommittee, 
for 
her 
leadership, 
along with the Congresswoman from 
Oklahoma (Mrs. BICE) for bringing us 
this very critical bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. 
LUCAS), who is the distinguished rank-
ing member of the Committee on 
Science, Space, and Technology and 
dean of the Oklahoma delegation. 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentlewoman from Oklahoma for yield-
ing and for introducing this legislation. 
H.R. 5324, the NOAA Weather Radio 
Modernization 
Act 
of 
2021, 
is 
a 
straightforward, lifesaving bill intro-
duced by my esteemed colleague from 
Oklahoma, Representative STEPHANIE 
BICE, who is the ranking member of the 
Environment Subcommittee. 
Last week, nearly the entire State of 
Oklahoma experienced an outbreak in 
severe weather and a number of con-
firmed tornadoes. That is not uncom-
mon for this time of year, and our citi-
zens were well prepared. 
While there was significant damage 
and widespread power outages, there 
have been no confirmed deaths at this 
point. That is because of the lifesaving 
efforts of NOAA, the National Weather 
Service, and warning capabilities like 
the NOAA Weather Radio, also known 
as NWR. 
Day or night, power or no power, in a 
rural area or in the heart of the city, 
an NWR device loudly alerts you and 
your family to severe weather nearby. 
Most Oklahomans have grown up lis-
tening to these announcements, and we 
know to act when we hear them. That 
saves lives. But since NWR was des-
ignated as the sole government pro-
vider of direct warnings to private 
homes in 1975, the system has gone 
through 
few 
upgrades 
other 
than 
broadly expanding access across the 
country. 
The NWR’s aging infrastructure has 
led to increased maintenance costs and 
more frequent outages. The copper wir-
ing that connects broadcast transmit-
ters to Weather Service stations has 
become obsolete and expensive. More 
powerful storms require backup op-
tions and stronger signals in case of ex-
tensive damage to mission critical fa-
cilities. 
The NWR Modernization Act address-
es these challenges and gives NOAA the 
authority and resources to ensure the 
NWR is as useful in the 21st century as 
it has been for the last four decades. 
This legislation continues to expand 
access to NWR, but does so while en-
suring the system does not become ob-
solete with out-of-date technology.

Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
leadership 
of 
the 
Committee 
on 
Science, Space, and Technology’s Envi-
ronment 
Subcommittee, 
Ranking 
Member 
BICE
and 
Chairwoman 
SHERRILL, for leading on this critical 
issue, and I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this bill. 
I would simply note that we pass lots 
of pieces of legislation in this body 
every session. But every so often, we 
address a piece of legislation that 
makes a real difference in the lives of 
people, a piece of legislation that de-
serves to move as swiftly as possible 
through the process to enable its im-
plementation. 
Mr. Speaker, again, I thank all of my 
colleagues, and I urge a yes vote. 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, 
the NWR Modernization Act of 2021 will 
ensure the continued safety of all 
Americans when experiencing severe 
weather and other emergency events. 
We have seen examples as recent as the 
past month of the NOAA Weather 
Radio saving lives in Oklahoma, Iowa, 
and Colorado. 
Although 
the 
National 
Weather 
Radio coverage is currently available 
to 95 percent of the U.S. population, I 
see no reason why we shouldn’t strive 
for 100 percent. Every citizen, no mat-
ter how remote or isolated their loca-
tion, deserves equal access to this life-
saving service. 
Additionally, because we have seen 
just how effective NWR is, we need to 
support its modernization and contin-
ued use for decades to come. Many 
services 
across 
different 
industries 
have used technology to adapt to a 
more modern age, and our country’s 
emergency alert system should be no 
different. This bill allows NOAA to 
achieve both of those goals. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, NOAA 
Weather Radio is absolutely essential. 
We have a bill to modernize it. The 
American people need it now. 
H.R. 5324, the NWR Modernization 
Act of 2021, has my full support. I urge 
my colleagues to support it. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. 
STEVENS) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5324, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, on that I de-
mand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on S. 66, the 
bill now under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Michigan? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 
66, the South Florida Clean Coastal 
Waters Act of 2021. 
The South Florida region suffers 
from blooms of harmful algae in both 
its fresh and marine bodies of water. 
The impacts of marine red tide and 
freshwater blue-green algae in this re-
gion are felt in marine life, across the 
local economy, and on public health. 
When these algae blooms die and sink 
to the bottom of water bodies, they can 
cause hypoxia or low oxygen events, 
which further impact marine and fresh-
water ecosystems. 
This bill authorizes a scientific as-
sessment and action plan to address 
the negative impacts of harmful algal 
blooms, HABs, and hypoxia in South 
Florida. 
We know that many Michiganders 
enjoy the splendors of South Florida in 
the winter season. We have had this re-
ported from colleagues from Florida. 
We are supporting this bill because this 
work can serve as a template for other 
communities suffering from HABs and 
hypoxia and help address these disrup-
tive events. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.

Hon. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON, 
Chair, Committee on Science, Space, and Tech-
nology, House of Representatives, Wash-
ington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIR JOHNSON: In recognition of the 
goal of expediting consideration of S.66, the 
‘‘South Florida Clean Coastal Waters Act of

X jurisdiction of the Committee on Natural 
Resources. 
The Committee on Natural Resources 
takes this action with the mutual under-
standing that, in doing so, we do not waive 
any jurisdiction over the subject matter con-
tained in this or similar legislation, and that 
the Committee will be appropriately con-
sulted and involved as the bill or similar leg-
islation moves forward so that we may ad-
dress any remaining-issues within our juris-
diction. Our Committee also reserves the 
right to seek appointment of conferees to 
any House-Senate conference involving this 
or similar legislation. 
I also ask that a copy of our exchange of 
letters on this matter be included in the 
Congressional Record. I appreciate your co-
operation regarding this legislation and look 
forward to continuing to work with you as 
this measure moves through the legislative 
process. 
Sincerely,

CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES, 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, April 29, 2022. 
Chairman RAU´ L M. GRIJALVA, 
Committee on Natural Resources, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN GRIJALVA, I am writing to 
you concerning S. 66, the ‘‘South Florida 
Clean Coastal Waters Act of 2021,’’ which was 
passed by the Senate on March 8, 2022. 
I appreciate your willingness to work coop-
eratively on this bill. I recognize that the 
bill contains provisions that fall within the 
jurisdiction of the Committee on Natural Re-
sources. I acknowledge that your committee 
will waive further consideration of S. 66 and 
that this action is not a waiver of future ju-
risdictional claims by the Committee on 
Natural Resources over this subject matter. 
I will make sure to include our exchange of 
letters in the Congressional Record and will 
support the appointment of the Committee 
on Natural Resource conferees during any 
House-Senate conference. Thank you for 
your cooperation on this legislation. 
Sincerely, 
EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON, 
Chairwoman. 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, 
we are now considering a Senate bill, 
S. 66, the South Florida Clean Coastal 
Waters Act of 2021. I support this bill, 
and I would like to note that I espe-
cially appreciate that we are going 
through the normal legislative process 
here.

H.R.

with 
Science, Space, and Technology Com-
mittee 
cosponsors 
Representatives 
POSEY, WALTZ, and GIMENEZ. 
H.R. 335, H.R. 565, and the bill we are 
considering now, S. 66, are all one and 
the same. It is simple language that is 
critically important to my colleagues 
in Florida and their communities, 
which are dependent on clean, healthy 
waters. 
The legislation requires the Inter- 
Agency Task Force on Harmful Algal 
Blooms and Hypoxia to produce an as-
sessment of the causes, consequences, 
and potential mitigation options to re-
duce HABs and hypoxia in South Flor-
ida. 
The legislation also calls for the task 
force to assess our current work and 
identify gaps in research, monitoring, 
and management efforts. The task 
force will also develop an action plan 
for reducing, mitigating, and control-
ling HABs and hypoxia. 
This will build on the great work to 
reduce those in other parts of the coun-
try; namely, the Great Lakes region 
and the northern Gulf of Mexico. 
It is solid legislation, and I look for-
ward to seeing its results in Florida. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, for 
those watching at home, a friendly re-
minder that S. 66 passed the House last 
session of Congress, the 116th Congress. 
We are now in the 117th Congress. We 
will pass this bill again. That is our in-
tention, to send it over to the Senate 
yet again to get it passed and signed 
into law. 
As a friendly reminder, the House 
Science, Space, and Technology Com-
mittee oversees and has jurisdiction 
over the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hy-
poxia Research and Control Act, which 
is why we are passing it through not 
only our committee but, obviously, 
here on the House floor. 
Madam Speaker, yet again, I join my 
colleagues in urging the passage of this 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Madam 
Speaker, 
the 
South 
Florida 
Clean 
Coastal Waters Act will help Floridians 
enjoy clean, safe, and healthy waters. 
That helps families and our economy. 
We have already seen how efforts like 
this can succeed in reducing harmful 
algal blooms in other parts of the coun-
try. This legislation will ensure south-
ern Florida enjoys the same success. 
This is a great example of solid pol-
icymaking through regular order, and I 
appreciate all the work that went into 
it. I thank Senators RUBIO and SCOTT 
for their work on the bill across the 
Hill; Representative MAST for his will-
ingness to collaborate with our Senate 
colleagues; and Representatives POSEY, 
WALTZ, and GIMENEZ for leading this 
effort for the Science, Space, and Tech-
nology Committee. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
bill, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I 
note that, with this bill, the task force 
to develop an action plan based on an 
integrated 
assessment 
that 
details 
methods for reducing, mitigating, and 
controlling HABs and hypoxia in South 
Florida is obviously essential. 
This is an interagency effort involv-
ing the State, local and Tribal govern-
ments, as well as non-Federal stake-
holder groups. I urge the passage of S. 
66. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I rise in support of S. 66, the South Florida 
Clean Coastal Waters Act of 2021. 
South Florida suffers from blooms of harm-
ful algae in both its marine and freshwater 
systems that have led to worsening ecologic 
and economic impacts. This region is im-
pacted by toxic red tide and massive fresh-
water blue-green algae blooms which can 
choke waterways and coastlines. Red tide and 
other types of HABs also pose health risks to 
humans from direct exposure and from eating 
infected seafood. When these algae die and 
sink to the bottom of water bodies and decay, 
it creates low oxygen conditions known as hy-
poxia. 
This bill is largely similar to what we passed 
out of the House last Congress on a bipartisan 
basis. It would authorize a scientific assess-
ment and action plan to help address the 
problem of HABs and hypoxia in South Flor-
ida. This assessment and action plan will help 
identify research gaps, and detail methods for 
mitigating and controlling HABs and hypoxia in 
South Florida. 
This bill takes an important step in helping 
address the HABs and hypoxia issue in South 
Florida, and I urge my colleagues to support 
it. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
GARCIA of Texas). The question is on 
the motion offered by the gentlewoman 
from Michigan (Ms. STEVENS) that the 
House suspend the rules and pass the 
bill, S. 66. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays.

ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution

Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-

EMPOWERING THE U.S. FIRE 
ADMINISTRATION ACT 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 7077) to require the United 
States Fire Administration to conduct 
on-site investigations of major fires, 
and for other purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 7077 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Empowering

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4734 
May 10, 2022 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 7077, the Empowering the 
U.S. Fire Administration Act. 
Although fire loss has improved sig-
nificantly over the past 25 years, the 
fire problem in the United States of 
America remains serious and is deserv-
ing of our attention and our legislative 
action. 
The United States still has one of the 
highest fire death rates in the industri-
alized world. It is clear we have work 
to do to prevent these fires and, unfor-
tunately, their deadly consequences. 
According to FEMA, between 2017 
and 2019, residential building fires 
caused an estimated 2,770 deaths, 11,650 
injuries, and $8.1 billion in property 
loss. 
In Michigan—and this is deeply per-
sonal to those of us in Oakland Coun-
ty—we have recently experienced a sig-
nificant rise in fire-related deaths dur-
ing 2022, just this year alone. Accord-
ing to the Bureau of Fire Services, fire- 
related deaths across Michigan in-
creased by 144 percent. Fires them-
selves are on the rise in the first month 
of 2022 alone compared to 2021. 
Unfortunately, it was reported that 
these increased fires in Michigan were 
all preventable, Madam Speaker, and 
that is why I am proud to be joining 
my incredible colleague from New 
York, Congressman TORRES, today in 
supporting his legislation. 
The Empowering the U.S. Fire Ad-
ministration Act is part of a Federal 
legislative package aimed at solving 
the underlying issues that cause deadly 
fires. 
H.R. 7077 is led by my friend and col-
league, Congressman RITCHIE TORRES. 
On January 9 of this year, a major fire 
occurred at the Twin Parks North West 
apartment building in Representative 
TORRES’ district in which 17 people, in-
cluding 8 children, tragically lost their 
lives. 
Following that, we experienced a less 
deadly fire, although monumental, at 
Oakland Hills in Bloomfield Hills, 
Michigan, in which the second-largest 
wood frame structure caught on fire 
and nearly all collapsed. 
A key objective of the U.S. Fire Ad-
ministration is to significantly reduce 
the Nation’s loss of life from fire while 
also achieving a reduction in property 
loss and nonfatal injury due to fire. 
This bill authorizes the U.S. Fire Ad-
ministration to conduct onsite inves-
tigations of major fires by authorizing 
the USFA to send incident investiga-
tors to the site of a major fire. 
This bill will more fully leverage the 
unique expertise of the USFA to con-
tribute to what we can learn from 
these fires to continue to strengthen 
prevention going forward. 
b 1500 
These catastrophes deserve Federal 
support. They hamper our local fire de-
partments. Our local residents deserve 
answers. 
I mentioned the tragedy in my own 
region in February that the Oakland 
Hills Country Club, a fixture that has 
been in our community for genera-
tions, 
experienced. 
The 
99-year-old 
clubhouse is one of the oldest, all- 
wooden structures in Michigan and it 
was where I worked as a hostess fol-
lowing my graduation from high school 
at Birmingham Seaholm. I was saving 
up money for college. Thankfully, no 
one was injured, but the Oakland Coun-
ty Sheriff recently forecasted that the 
total fire investigation could take up 
to a full year to complete. 
We must learn from these fires to in-
form efforts to prevent major fires 
from occurring in the future, and the 
USFA is an important component of 
these efforts. The agency is limited in 
its ability to learn from these fires, as 
it currently lacks the authority to con-
duct on-site investigations. This is 
what this bill will achieve. 
It will unlock the expertise of Fed-
eral fire safety specialists and engi-
neers to coordinate and cooperate with 
local firefighter investigators after a 
major fire incident in their commu-
nity. 
It authorizes the USFA to send their 
own experts to the site of a major fire 
to conduct an on-site investigation in 
coordination and cooperation with ap-
propriate Federal, State, and local au-
thorities. In doing so, this bill more 
fully utilizes the agency’s extensive ex-
pertise to help learn from major fires 
and to help inform prevention efforts 
in the future. 
Additionally, this bill requires USFA 
to issue a public report on the findings 
of the investigation to local, State, and 
Federal authorities. This report would 
include recommendations on how to 
mitigate the causes of the investigated 
fire, as well as buildings with similar 
characteristics that may bear similar 
fire risks. 
The sharing of national best prac-
tices is how we succeed as the United 
States of America. If other Federal 
agencies, for example, NIST, are also 
investigating the fire, the bill would 
encourage the agency to collaborate on 
a comprehensive report and inter-
agency effort. In fact, collaboration 
with local, State, and other Federal au-
thorities is a central theme of this en-
tire bill. We are just ensuring that 
USFA also has the specific authorities 
it needs to carry out its mission. 
I thank my colleague, Congressman 
RITCHIE
TORRES, a freshman in this 
body, for his fantastic leadership on 
this bill. I also recognize my Science 
Committee 
colleagues, 
Congressman 
PETER MEIJER from west Michigan and 
Congressman ANTHONY GONZALEZ from 
the State of Ohio. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to join us in passing this bill, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 7077, the Empowering the U.S. 
Fire Administration Act. This bipar-
tisan legislation would help us better 
investigate and prevent deadly fires by 
giving the U.S. Fire Administration 
the authority to collaborate with local 
fire departments. With this authority, 
they can send safety specialists, fire 
protection engineers, codes and stand-
ards experts, researchers, and fire 
training specialists to assist with on- 
site investigations of major fires. 
The U.S. Fire Administration is 
housed within FEMA, and it helps en-
hance our ability to prevent and re-
spond to fires through research and 
education. 
It has valuable and lifesaving re-
sources in preventing, responding to, 
and investigating fires. This bill would 
ensure that State and local govern-
ments can access their expertise and, 
hopefully, prevent major fires in the 
future. 
The bill directs U.S. Fire Administra-
tion incident investigators to examine 
the causes and origins of fires. Their 
expertise will help local officials assess 
factors that contributed to the loss of 
property and life, including the use of 
codes and standards, demographics, 
structural characteristics, smoke and 
fire dynamics, and related costs. 
Additionally, the bill requires the 
U.S. Fire Administration to issue a re-
port in coordination with Federal, 
State, and local authorities on their 
findings and to provide recommenda-
tions on how to prevent similar fires 
from occurring in the future. 
I thank Representative TORRES for 
introducing this bill after New York’s 
deadliest fire in over three decades 
claimed the lives of 17 residents, in-
cluding 8 children. 
Representative 
TORRES
recognizes 
that it is critical that we empower the 
U.S. Fire Administration to partner 
with local fire departments to help de-
termine the root cause of these tragic 
and horrific fires to make sure they 
never happen again. 
The bill incorporates stakeholder and 
agency feedback and is endorsed by the 
Fire Department of New York, the 
International 
Association 
of 
Fire 
Chiefs, International Association of 
Fire Fighters, the National Association 
of State Fire Marshals, and the Na-
tional Fire Protection Association. 
It is smart and practical policy to 
make the best possible use of our re-
sources to protect American lives. In 
addition to Representative TORRES, I 
thank the original cosponsors from our 
committee: Representatives STEVENS, 
MEIJER, and GONZALEZ. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. TORRES). 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I am here to speak about H.R. 
7077, which stems from the tragedy of 
Twin Parks North West, the scene of 
New York’s deadliest fire in more than 
three decades, one that left the South 
Bronx with a death count of 17, includ-
ing 8 children, one as young as 2 years 
of age.

May 10, 2022 
The legislation would empower the 
United States Fire Administration to 
investigate the deadliest fires, in part-
nership with State and local govern-
ments. Not all local jurisdictions have 
the capacity to investigate the causes 
of complex fires on their own. The Fed-
eral Government, tapping into the 
technical expertise of the USFA, can 
and should aid fire investigations in 
the aim of ascertaining the truth about 
what exactly happened and why. 
We must investigate the deadliest 
fires so that every lesson is learned and 
so that no life is ever lost in vain. 
The objective here is to enable the 
USFA to share lessons learned with 
governments at all levels in the hopes 
of transforming those lessons into poli-
cies and practices that prevent fires 
and save lives. 
Every time a fire breaks out and a 
life is lost, we should be reminded of a 
simple injunction: Those who fail to 
learn from history are doomed to re-
peat it. Let us enable the USFA to 
learn from the deadliest fires so that 
we as a Nation never repeat them. 
I am enormously grateful for the 
partnership of Congress Member HALEY 
STEVENS; without whose support the 
bill would never have been brought to 
the floor. I am also enormously grate-
ful for the bipartisan cooperation of 
Congress Members BICE, MEIJER, and 
GONZALEZ. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD letters supporting my legisla-
tion from the FDNY, International As-
sociation of Fire Chiefs, National Asso-
ciation of State Fire Marshals, and the 
International 
Association 
of 
Fire

DEAR CONGRESSMAN TORRES: I am pleased 
to write in support of H.R. 7077. This bill au-
thorizes the U.S. Fire Administration to con-
duct on-site investigations of major fires and 
other 
fires 
under 
other 
specified 
cir-
cumstances. 
This bill would help to prevent future fires 
and deadly tragedies by empowering the U.S. 
Fire Administration to launch investiga-
tions, which assess a range of broad system-
atic matters that contribute to fire inci-
dents. The most recent fire at Twin Parks 
was a tragic reminder that a serious fire can 
happen at any time, particularly in vulner-
able communities. Through investigations 
and education, we can prevent future trage-
dies, and this bill will assist in doing just 
that. 
I look forward to partnering with your of-
fice on this bill and other critical legislation 
that furthers New York City. 
Sincerely, 
LAURA KAVANAGH, 
Acting Fire Commissioner, 
Fire Department of the City of New York. 
INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
OF FIRE CHIEFS, 
Chantilly, VA, March 4, 2022. 
Hon. RITCHIE TORRES, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE TORRES: On behalf 
of the nearly 12,000 members of the Inter-
national Association of Fire Chiefs (IAFC), I 
endorse the Empowering the U.S. Fire Ad-
ministration Act. This legislation will allow 
the U.S. Fire Administration (USFA) to ex-
amine the cause of major fires and share les-
sons learned with local governments to pre-
vent future tragedies. The IAFC asks Con-
gress to pass this legislation. 
Deaths and property loss from fire remain 
a national tragedy. The National Fire Pro-
tection Association reports that, in 2020, 
local fire departments responded to more 
than 1.3 million fires. These resulted in 3,500 
civilian fire deaths, 15,200 injuries and more 
almost $22 billion in property loss. Despite 
efforts to reduce the threat of fire, the 
United States still has one of the worst fire 
problems in the industrialized world. 
The USFA can play a significant role in re-
ducing fire deaths and property loss. It has 
programs to promote fire prevention and to 
train local fire departments to develop effec-
tive fire prevention programs. The Empow-
ering the U.S. Fire Administration Act can 
add a valuable tool to USFA’s programs by 
allowing USFA to examine the cause and ori-
gin of major fires and report on them. Spe-
cifically, the bill would allow USFA to co-
ordinate with the appropriate federal, state, 
and local authorities, which are authorized 
to investigate major fires. The USFA inves-
tigators would examine the determined 
cause and origin of the fire and assess broad-
er systematic matters, including the use of 
codes and standards, demographics, struc-
tural characteristics, smoke and fire dynam-
ics during the fire, and the costs of associ-
ated injuries and deaths. Then the USFA 
would release a report on this fire with rec-
ommendations about fire prevention in simi-
lar buildings; how to improve the tactical re-
sponse to similar fires; and how to protect 
civilian life and property. In addition, USFA 
could include this information in its edu-
cational curricula at the National Fire Acad-
emy 
to 
ensure 
that 
important 
lessons 
learned from major fires are distributed 
throughout the national fire and emergency 
service. 
I thank you again for introducing this im-
portant legislation. The nation must work 
harder to reduce the loss of life and property 
through tragic fires. Your bill will empower 
the USFA to examine the causes of major 
fires and educate the nation on how to pre-
vent future tragedies. We look forward to 
collaborating with you to pass this bill. 
Sincerely, 
FIRE CHIEF KENNETH W. STUEBING,

Hon. ANTHONY GONZALEZ, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVES TORRES, STEVENS, 
MEIJER, & GONZALEZ: The National Associa-
tion of State Fire Marshals (NASFM) thanks 
you for your leadership introducing legisla-
tion to authorize the United States Fire Ad-
ministration (USFA) to conduct on-site in-
vestigations of major fires and fires with un-
usual 
or 
remarkable 
context. 
NASFM 
strongly endorses H.R. 7077, the Empowering 
the U.S. Fire Administration Act. 
NASFM membership comprises the most 
senior state fire officials in the United 
States. Our primary mission is to protect 
human life, property and the environment 
from fire and related hazards. As such, we 
are extremely supportive of your legislation 
to empower the USFA to help establish a 
broader analysis of major fires and provide 
recommendations for enhanced risk reduc-
tion and fire prevention efforts. 
This bipartisan legislation will increase 
fire investigation collaboration at the fed-
eral, state, and local levels by allowing the 
USFA to send safety specialists, fire protec-
tion engineers, codes and standards experts, 
researchers, and fire training specialists to 
the sites of major fires throughout the coun-
try. The bill also requires the USFA to issue 
a report in coordination with appropriate 
federal, state, and local authorities to deter-
mine the cause and origin of the fire with 
recommendations to implement, and en-
forcement of national safety codes and 
standards, to prevent similar fires in the fu-
ture. 
‘‘The National Association of State Fire 
Marshals enthusiastically supports H.R. 7077, 
the Empowering the U.S. Fire Administra-
tion Act.’’ said NASFM Executive Director 
Jim Narva, ‘‘By ensuring the inclusion of a 
more diverse risk reduction focus, the inves-
tigations authorized under this Act will help 
identify underlying issues and recommend 
actions to help prevent future tragedies, sav-
ing countless lives.’’ 
Thank you again for your leadership, we 
look forward to working with you to enact 
this important fire risk reduction and pre-
vention legislation into law. 
Sincerely, 
JIM NARVA, 
Executive Director. 
INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF 
FIRE FIGHTERS 
Washington, DC, April 1, 2022. 
Hon. RITCHIE TORRES, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE TORRES: On behalf 
of the more than 327,000 professional fire 
fighters and emergency medical services 
(EMS) personnel of the International Asso-
ciation of Fire Fighters (IAFF), thank you 
for introducing the Empowering the U.S. 
Fire Administration Act (H.R. 7077). The 
IAFF appreciates your work to enable the 
U.S. Fire Administrator to investigate fires 
and identify essential lessons learned that 
can save lives in the future. 
Fires continue to be a significant threat 
across the nation. This past January alone, 
three fires led to the deaths of 3 fire fighters 
and 29 members of the public. When these 
major fires occur, there are always lessons 
that can prevent future deaths. Sadly, the 
U.S. Fire Administration (USFA) lacks the 
formal authority to investigate fires and 
translate lessons learned into ways to en-
hance fire fighters’ training and public edu-
cation efforts. The IAFF is pleased to sup-
port your legislation as it empowers the 
USFA to identify important findings from 
each fire. 
The IAFF also appreciates that H.R. 7077 
places a high value on communicating the 
findings of fire investigations to the public. 
Far too often, findings from fire investiga-
tions are only partially released or done so 
in a manner that does not allow findings to 
be used for future educational purposes. The 
USFA has a strong track record of educating 
the fire service and developing valuable 
training. Authorizing the USFA to conduct 
these investigations is a meaningful way to 
ensure that these findings will be shared 
with the broader fire service and fully incor-
porated into future training and educational 
opportunities. 
Thank you again for your leadership and 
work to support fire fighters across the na-
tion. Congress must make every effort to 
support our fire fighters’ safety and enable 
them to succeed in serving their commu-
nities. H.R. 7077 provides an important new

tool by empowering the USFA to serve the 
American fire service in a new capacity. The 
IAFF looks forward to working with you to 
secure the passage of H.R. 7077 as quickly as 
possible. 
Sincerely, 
EDWARD A. KELLY, 
General President. 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Michigan (Mr. MEIJER), 
my freshman colleague. 
Mr. MEIJER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 7077, the Em-
powering the U.S. Fire Administration 
Act, which is an important piece of bi-
partisan legislation to support the U.S. 
Fire Administration. 
I was honored to join my colleague 
we 
just 
heard 
from, 
Mr. 
RITCHIE 
TORRES, 
in 
introducing 
this 
bill, 
spurred from a terrible and heart-
breaking tragedy in his district in New 
York. 
That fire in the Bronx apartment 
building left us with many questions. 
Upon further examination, it became 
clear that there is currently a lack of 
coordination between the Federal U.S. 
Fire Administration and other State 
and local authorities. In fact, the U.S. 
Fire Administration does not have the 
authority to conduct on-site investiga-
tions of major fires. As a result, our 
State and local authorities are limited 
in their capabilities to investigate 
major fires. 
The U.S. Fire Administration’s ex-
pertise can and should be used to the 
fullest extent, in coordination with all 
existing authorities responsible for fire 
investigations. 
That is why H.R. 7077 is so impor-
tant. It simply addresses the existing 
coordination 
gap 
between 
Federal, 
State, and local authorities. It allows 
the U.S. Fire Administration to send 
investigators, including safety special-
ists, fire protection engineers, codes 
and standards experts, and fire training 
specialists to the site of a major fire so 
that these experts can then work on 
the ground with their State and local 
authorities to determine causes, exam-
ine building failures, provide answers 
to those affected by the fires, and es-
tablish lessons learned so similar trag-
edies can be prevented in the future. 
The tragedy we saw in the Bronx was 
heartbreaking and should never have 
happened. We need answers, and we 
also need to ensure that something like 
this does not happen again. It is past 
time to allow the experts at all levels, 
Federal, State, and local, to coordinate 
and help us achieve this goal. This bill 
has received support from fire depart-
ments across the country, including 
my hometown of Grand Rapids, with 
our Grand Rapids Fire Department of-
fering its support. 
I thank my colleague, Mr. TORRES, 
without whom this wouldn’t have hap-
pened, Ms. STEVENS, and Mr. GONZALEZ 
for their work on this bill, as well as 
my dear colleague, Mrs. BICE, for her 
work. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this piece of legisla-
tion. 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
I rise again in support of H.R. 7077, 
the Empowering the U.S. Fire Adminis-
tration Act. 
As I previously mentioned, the USFA 
has valuable and lifesaving resources in 
preventing, responding to, and inves-
tigating fires. This bill would ensure 
that State and local governments have 
access to these resources and that the 
U.S. Fire Administration has the au-
thority needed to conduct on-site in-
vestigations of major fires. 
We cannot afford to let any more 
tragic and preventable fires like the 
one in Representative TORRES’ district 
happen in the future. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I 
urge my colleagues to support this 
critical bill, H.R. 7077, a bill to em-
power the U.S. Fire Administration to 
act in regard to the event of fires for 
investigative purposes. 
I also note that the Members who are 
supporting this bill not only share a 
time zone but also share a generation 
and share a vision for the future, a vi-
sion for the future of this country that 
utilizes the best of government and 
interagency effort, government acting 
cohesively together when needed, hav-
ing the Federal Government come in 
and support local fire departments in 
the wake of catastrophic fires. 
This is quite palpable, Madam Speak-
er. The urgency to pass the bill, H.R. 
7077, could not be more palpable. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. 
STEVENS) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 7077, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

woman from Michigan. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and to include extraneous mate-
rial on H.R. 1437, the bill now under 
consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Michigan? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 1437, the Providing Re-
search and Estimates of Changes in 
Precipitation, or PRECIP Act. 
I 
commend 
Environment 
Sub-
committee Chairwoman SHERRILL
of 
the Science Committee on her work to 
bring the PRECIP Act to the House 
floor today. This bipartisan bill is the 
result of significant stakeholder en-
gagement 
led 
by 
Congresswoman 
SHERRILL of New Jersey. 
Precipitation data is used by deci-
sionmakers like dam safety officials, 
flood plain managers, civil engineers, 
and Federal, State, and local officials, 
to build resilient infrastructure, some-
thing we care a lot about in this body, 
for communities. 
b 1515 
The precipitation data is extremely 
important for Michiganians. This is a 
huge reality for us, particularly in 
southeastern Michigan, after record, 
record rainfall over the last year. 
The Great Lakes Integrated Sciences 
and Assessments organization found 
that changes in precipitation in the 
Great Lakes region will lead to more 
extreme precipitation events in the 
State of Michigan, otherwise known as 
flooding, a reality all too probable to 
the Speaker and myself, both hailing 
from southeast Michigan. 
These extreme precipitation events 
can cause flooding and can also affect 
lake levels, which could have severe 
economic 
and 
ecological 
impacts 
across my home State of Michigan and 
certainly across the country. 
The PRECIP Act would help to mod-
ernize 
outdated 
precipitation 
data 
across the country, and the bill also di-
rects NOAA to update precipitation 
data on a regular cadence. This will 
not only address many precipitation 
estimates that are currently years, and 
sometimes decades, out of date, it will 
also help local responders act when 
their residents need them to. It will 
also help local elected officials coordi-
nate with the Federal agencies in re-
sponding 
to 
extreme 
precipitation 
events. It will also ensure consistency 
in precipitation estimates across the 
United States; as we know, precipita-
tion events do not respect State or re-
gional boundaries. 
As we are also anticipating an in-
crease in frequency and intensity of 
precipitation events due to the reality 
of climate change, it is critical that 
this bill also requires NOAA to con-
sider future climate change while up-
dating these precipitation estimates. 
This will ensure that this data remains 
relevant for the future. 
I am deeply proud to cosponsor this 
bill that has both bipartisan and bi-
cameral support. Its passage will posi-
tively impact all Americans, and I urge 
my colleagues in this Chamber on both 
sides of the aisle to support this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 1437, the PRECIP Act. This legis-
lation, sponsored by the Chairwoman 
of the Environmental Subcommittee, 
the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Ms. 
SHERRILL), would amend the Weather 
Act to enhance precipitation estimates 
and improve how NOAA works with 
stakeholder groups to best utilize this 
data. 
This precipitation data is crucial to 
our forecasting abilities. Accurate pre-
cipitation estimates not only inform

our decisions on agriculture and water 
resources but also help us better pre-
dict and protect ourselves from natural 
disasters like flooding and landslides. 
To improve these estimates, this bill 
directs NOAA to partner with the Na-
tional Academies to review current 
practices for estimating precipitation 
and identifying research needs in order 
to improve these forecasts. 
Additionally, the legislation requires 
NOAA to update its maximum precipi-
tation estimates within 6 years of the 
National Academies report and every 
10 years afterward. 
Finally, this bill directs NOAA to de-
velop and publish a national guidance 
document for Federal and State agen-
cies, meteorologists, and other users to 
follow when performing probable max-
imum precipitation studies. 
The commonsense steps in this bill 
will provide tremendous benefits across 
the country. Communities will benefit 
from access to better data as they 
make key decisions about creating and 
updating infrastructure to address ex-
treme weather events, including flood-
ing. 
This will make a real difference 
across America. My home State of 
Oklahoma is home to thousands of 
dams. Many of these structures are in 
need of repair and modernization, and 
the communities responsible for these 
dams rely on accurate data to ensure 
we are prepared for future rainfall. Too 
often, we have had to rely on out-of- 
date data to make these critical deci-
sions, which will not be the case if the 
PRECIP Act becomes law. 
I am proud to be a cosponsor of the 
legislation, and I will thank Chair-
woman SHERRILL for her work on this 
important topic. I urge my colleagues 
to support the bill, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I 
have seen Congresswoman DEBBIE DIN-
GELL of Michigan’s 12th District, in her 
waders, moving around her district, in-
cluding 
Dearborn, 
in 
flood-ridden 
neighborhoods. This is a crisis. 
It is important to pass the PRECIP 
Act, as introduced by the gentlewoman 
from New Jersey (Ms. SHERRILL), co-led 
by the gentleman from Pennsylvania 
(Mr. FITZPATRICK). 
This is a remarkable piece of legisla-
tion that will make a huge difference 
to this country. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Madam 
Speaker, I once again thank Represent-
ative SHERRILL for sponsoring this im-
portant legislation. Better precipita-
tion estimates will improve the way we 
do business, manage infrastructure, 
and prevent losses during natural dis-
asters. 
This is a smart and practical bill 
that ensures we have accurate data 
from NOAA on precipitation. It also 
ensures NOAA will update its esti-
mates more frequently so communities 
can use timely data to make crucial 
decisions. 
I appreciate my colleagues’ work on 
this important topic, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, in 
closing, H.R. 1437, the PRECIP Act, is 
of great merit. I urge my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to join me in its 
passage, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. 
STEVENS) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1437, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are

UNITED STATES ARMY RANGERS 
VETERANS OF WORLD WAR II 
CONGRESSIONAL 
GOLD 
MEDAL 
ACT 
Mr. 
GARCI´A 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, I move to suspend the rules 
and pass the bill (S. 1872) to award a 
Congressional Gold Medal, collectively, 
to the United States Army Rangers 
Veterans of World War II in recogni-
tion of their extraordinary service dur-
ing World War II. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 1872 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘United 
States Army Rangers Veterans of World War 
II Congressional Gold Medal Act’’. 
SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS. 
In this Act— 
(1) the term ‘‘Secretary’’ means the Sec-
retary of the Treasury; and 
(2) the term ‘‘United States Army Rangers 
Veteran of World War II’’ means any indi-
vidual who— 
(A) served in the Armed Forces— 
(i) honorably; 
(ii) in an active duty status; and 
(iii) at any time during the period begin-
ning on June 19, 1942, and ending on Sep-
tember 2, 1945; and 
(B) was assigned to a Ranger Battalion of 
the Army at any time during the period de-
scribed in subparagraph (A)(iii). 
SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) In World War II, the Army formed 6 
Ranger Battalions and 1 provisional bat-
talion. All members of the Ranger Battalions 
were volunteers. The initial concept of Rang-
er units drew from the British method of 
using highly trained ‘‘commando’’ units and 
the military tradition of the United States 
of utilizing light infantry for scouting and 
raiding operations. 
(2) The Ranger Battalions of World War II 
consisted of— 
(A) the 1st Ranger Infantry Battalion, 
which was activated on June 19, 1942, in 
Northern Ireland; 
(B) the 2d Ranger Infantry Battalion, 
which was activated on April 1, 1943, at Camp 
Forrest, Tennessee; 
(C) the 3d Ranger Infantry Battalion, 
which was— 
(i) activated as provisional on May 21, 1943, 
in North Africa; and 
(ii) constituted on July 21, 1943, and con-
currently consolidated with the provisional 
unit described in clause (i); 
(D) the 4th Ranger Infantry Battalion, 
which was— 
(i) activated as provisional on May 29, 1943, 
in North Africa; and 
(ii) constituted on July 21, 1943, and con-
currently consolidated with the provisional 
unit described in clause (i); 
(E) the 5th Ranger Infantry Battalion, 
which was activated on September 1, 1943, at 
Camp Forrest, Tennessee; 
(F) the 6th Ranger Infantry Battalion, 
which was— 
(i) originally activated on January 20, 1941, 
at Fort Lewis, Washington, as the 98th Field 
Artillery Battalion; and 
(ii) converted and redesignated on Sep-
tember 26, 1944, as the 6th Ranger Infantry 
Battalion; and 
(G) the 29th Ranger Infantry Battalion, a 
provisional Army National Guard unit that 
was— 
(i) activated on December 20, 1942, at 
Tidworth Barracks, England; and 
(ii) disbanded on October 18, 1943. 
(3) The first combat operations of Army 
Rangers occurred on August 19, 1942, when 50 
Rangers took part in the British-Canadian 
raid on the French coastal town of Dieppe. 
(4) The 1st Ranger Battalion, under the 
leadership of Major William O. Darby, was 
used in full strength during the landings at 
Arsew, Algeria, during the North African 
campaign. Due to the success of the Rangers 
in several difficult battles, particularly at El 
Guettar in March and April of 1943, 2 addi-
tional Ranger Battalions were organized in 
North Africa. 
(5) During the North African campaign, the 
1st Ranger Battalion was awarded battle 
honors for its actions in Tunisia. On March 
20, 1943, the Battalion penetrated enemy 
lines and captured the position Djebel el Ank 
in a nighttime attack, taking more than 200 
prisoners. Two days later, the battalion was 
attacked by the 10th Panzer division of the 
German Afrika Korps and, despite heavy 
losses, continued to defend its position. The 
following day, the 1st Battalion counter-
attacked to clear high ground overlooking 
the positions held by the Armed Forces. 
These actions demonstrated the ability of 
the Rangers to fight in difficult terrain and 
the courage to endure despite being out-
numbered and exposed to heavy enemy fire. 
(6) The 29th provisional Ranger Battalion 
was formed from volunteers drawn from the 
29th Infantry Division stationed in England 
in the fall of 1942. The Battalion was acti-
vated on December 20, 1942, and accompanied 
British commandos on 3 small-scale raids in 
Norway. Nineteen members of the 29th Rang-
er Battalion conducted a raid on a German 
radar site in France on the night of Sep-
tember 3, 1943. After that raid, the 29th 
Ranger Battalion was disbanded because new 
Ranger units, the 2d and 5th Battalions, were 
being formed. 
(7) During the summer and fall of 1943, the 
1st, 3d, and 4th Ranger Battalions were heav-
ily involved in the campaign in Sicily and 
the landings in Italy. The 1st and 4th Ranger 
Battalions conducted a night amphibious 
landing in Sicily and secured the landing 
beaches for the main force. The 3d Battalion 
landed separately at Licata, Sicily, and was 
able to silence gun positions on an 82-foot 
cliff overlooking the invasion beaches.

(8) During the invasion of Italy, the 1st and 
4th Ranger Battalions landed at Maiori with 
the mission of seizing the high ground and 
protecting the flank of the remainder of the 
main landing by the United States. Enemy 
forces in the area were estimated to out-
number the Rangers by approximately 8 to 1. 
Despite these odds, the Rangers took the po-
sition and held off 7 enemy counterattacks. 
(9) After the invasion of Italy, Rangers 
continued to be used, often in night attacks, 
to seize key terrain ahead of the advancing 
Allied forces. At the Anzio beachhead, the 
majority of the 1st, 3d, and 4th Ranger Bat-
talions sustained heavy casualties after 
being cut off behind German lines. The Rang-
ers had planned to infiltrate German posi-
tions under the cover of darkness and make 
a dawn attack on a critical road junction but 
were pinned down by enemy tanks and an 
elite German paratrooper unit. After 12 
hours of desperate fighting and a failed relief 
attempt, the majority of the Ranger force 
was killed, wounded, or captured. Only 6 
Rangers from the 1st and 3d Battalions, out 
of more than 767 men, returned to friendly 
lines. The 4th Battalion, which had been in 
reserve, also suffered 60 killed and 120 
wounded out of 550 men. These 3 battalions 
were inactivated and the survivors were 
transferred to other units. 
(10) In the United States, and later in Scot-
land, the 2d and 5th Ranger Battalions were 
formed to undertake operations in Western 
Europe. Those Battalions were engaged on D- 
Day, assaulting German positions at the 
Pointe du Hoc coastal battery, and remained 
in combat through September of 1944. Spe-
cifically, Rangers in the 2d Battalion, under 
the command of Lieutenant Colonel James 
E. Rudder— 
(A) overcame mines, machine gun fire, and 
enemy artillery while scaling the 100-foot 
high cliffs at Pointe du Hoc; 
(B) held against intense German efforts to 
retake the position; and 
(C) after reaching the top of the cliffs, 
moved inland roughly 1 mile and sustained 
heavy casualties while searching for, and ul-
timately destroying, a German heavy artil-
lery battery. 
(11) During June, July, and August of 1944, 
the 2d and 5th Ranger Battalions were en-
gaged in the campaign in Brest, which in-
cluded close-range fighting in hedgerows and 
numerous villages. Later, in operations in 
Western Germany, the Battalions were fre-
quently used to attack in darkness and gain 
vital positions to pave the way for the main 
Army attacks. 
(12) During the final drive into Germany in 
late February and early March 1945, the 5th 
Ranger Battalion was cited for battle honors 
for outstanding performance. Under the 
cover of darkness, the unit drove into Ger-
man lines and blocked the main German sup-
ply route in the sector. The Germans at-
tacked the position of the Rangers from both 
sides, resulting in heavy Ranger casualties 
during 5 days of fighting. As a result of the 
actions of the Rangers, the main Army at-
tack was able to overcome German defenses 
more easily, occupy the vital city of Trier, 
and reach the Rhine River. 
(13) The 6th Ranger Battalion operated in 
the Pacific. In the most notable exploit of 
the 6th Ranger Battalion, in January and 
February of 1945, the Battalion formed the 
nucleus of a rescue force that liberated more 
than 500 Allied prisoners, including prisoners 
from the United States, from the Caba-
natuan prisoner of war camp in the Phil-
ippines. With the help of local Filipino gue-
rillas, the Rangers, led by Lieutenant Colo-
nel Henry A. Mucci, demonstrated extraor-
dinary heroism by infiltrating Japanese-held 
territory to reach the prisoners of war and 
prevent them from being killed by the Japa-
nese. After a 25-mile march at night through 
the jungle, the unit killed all Japanese sen-
tries with no loss of life of the prisoners of 
war. The unit successfully returned to Amer-
ican lines having lost only 2 soldiers killed 
and having another 2 wounded. 
(14) The 1st Ranger Infantry Battalion— 
(A) participated in the campaigns of— 
(i) Algeria-French Morocco (with arrow-
head); 
(ii) Tunisia;

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

May 10, 2022 
World War II Congressional Gold Medal 
Act. This bill honors the service of the 
men of the U.S. Army Rangers whose 
courageous actions in the European, 
North African, and Pacific theaters 
during World War II were essential to 
ensuring victory for the Allied Powers. 
At the onset of World War II, there 
were no U.S. Army units capable of 
performing highly specialized raiding 
missions like that of their British 
Commandos counterparts. To resolve 
this, 
Brigadier 
General 
Lucian 
K. 
Truscott, Jr., proposed the creation of 
Army Ranger Battalions to General 
George Marshall. These small, highly 
specialized, and independent units drew 
upon 
existing 
American 
expertise, 
using light infantry units for raids and 
scouting. 
Captain William O. Darby was se-
lected as the 1st Ranger Battalion com-
mander due to his experience in am-
phibious training and operational expe-
rience in both cavalry and infantry. 
Darby immediately went about recruit-
ing volunteers, 473 of whom became the 
1st Ranger Battalion. 
Thereafter, 
the 
2nd 
through 
6th 
Ranger Battalions were formed, along 
with the 29th provisional Ranger Bat-
talion, comprised of members of the 
Army National Guard. 
The 1st Ranger Battalion was given 
the initial mission of taking part in 
the British and Canadian raid in 
Dieppe in France, making them the 
first American troops to see ground 
combat in Europe. Following this raid, 
the 1st Ranger Battalion operated pri-
marily throughout North Africa and 
Italy, where they and members of the 
3rd Ranger Battalion played a crucial 
role in the operational success of the 
Battle of Anzio. 
The 29th provisional Ranger Bat-
talion participated in several smaller 
raids in Norway and France and was 
then disbanded due to the new forma-
tion of the 2nd and 5th Ranger Battal-
ions, who took part in campaigns in 
France, Belgium, and Central Europe, 
including Alsace, Brest, and most fa-
mously, the invasion of Normandy on 
D-day. 
The 3rd and 4th Ranger Battalions 
conducted missions across Italy, while 
the 6th Ranger Battalion engaged in 
combat in the Pacific theater, pri-
marily in the Philippines and New 
Guinea. The 6th Ranger Battalion is 
best known for its part in the rescue of 
more than 500 prisoners of war in the 
raid of the prison camp at Cabanatuan, 
which is the largest rescue operation in 
American history. 
Following the war, all seven Ranger 
Infantry Battalions received the Presi-
dential Unit Citation for their exten-
sive contributions to the Allied war ef-
fort, and I believe their heroism ought 
to be recognized and rewarded further 
still. 
I urge my colleagues to support S. 
1872, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise, too, in sup-
port of S. 1872, the United States Army 
Rangers Veterans of World War II Con-
gressional Gold Medal Act. I thank my 
friend from Illinois for managing the 
time today and also thank Senators 
ERNST and DUCKWORTH for their work 
on the Senate side in originating this 
bill and Representatives here in the 
House, 
CROW, 
MILLER-MEEKS, 
and 
WALTZ for their work on the House 
companion, H.R. 3577. 
Madam Speaker, to become an Army 
Ranger is a distinct honor. Those who 
have the privilege of donning the tan 
beret are proven warriors whose com-
mitment to our freedom knows no 
bounds. These warriors embody the 
Ranger motto: ‘‘Rangers Lead the 
Way.’’ 
The 75th Ranger regiment is so well- 
known that it is hard to believe that 
the United States had no official units 
organized to carry out such specialized 
missions prior to World War II. 
But when America entered the war, 
conventional wisdom changed, and it 
became clear that special operation 
units were essential to an Allied vic-
tory. 
The first Rangers were trailblazers, 
whose work influenced our Nation’s ap-
proach to special operations across all 
branches of the military. On May 26, 
1942, 
Brigadier 
General 
Lucian 
Truscott, the U.S. Army liaison with 
the British Combined Operations head-
quarters, proposed to Army Chief of 
Staff General George C. Marshall that 
‘‘we undertake immediately the orga-
nization of an American unit along 
British Commando lines.’’ 
In short order, a cable was sent from 
the War Department to Major General 
Russell P. Hartle, the commander of 
U.S. Army forces in Northern Ireland, 
to authorize the activation of the first- 
ever Ranger unit. 
The idea was to disseminate volun-
teer units with the British Commandos 
to become combat tested in special op-
eration warfare and eventually to re-
turn to their original American units 
and 
share 
their 
newfound 
combat 
knowledge. 
b 1530 
It was Truscott who bestowed the 
title, ‘‘Rangers’’ on these brave sol-
diers. Truscott said: ‘‘I selected ‘Rang-
ers’ because few words have a more 
glamorous connotation in American 
military history. 
‘‘It was therefore fitting that the or-
ganization destined to be the first of 
American ground forces to battle Ger-
mans on the European Continent in 
World War II should be called Rang-
ers—in compliment to those in Amer-
ican history who exemplified such high 
standards of individual courage, initia-
tive, determination, and ruggedness, 
fighting ability and achievement.’’ 
In just a few weeks after Truscott’s 
original proposal, the First Ranger In-
fantry Battalion was activated 19 June 
1942. Five more Ranger battalions fol-
lowed, as well as a provisional Army 
National Guard unit known as the 29th 
Ranger Battalion. 
The newly formed Ranger battalions 
had an immediate impact on the Allied 
war effort. The first battalion, then led 
by Major William O. Darby, was an in-
tegral part of the North Africa cam-
paign, so much so that the battalion 
was awarded battalion honors for its 
actions in Tunisia spearheading Oper-
ation Torch. 
Bill Darby was a hero in my home 
State of Arkansas. Brigadier General 
Bill Darby was born and buried in Fort 
Smith, Arkansas. And Darby, for all 
his 
leadership, 
proudly 
represented 
that Ranger uniform and Ranger lead-
ership. He was killed in action in Italy 
at age 34 in April 1945. 
Darby and those early Ranger units 
were able to overtake enemy troops 
where the Axis forces held every advan-
tage, including that of just sheer num-
bers. Our debt can never be repaid to 
those who have chosen to wear the 
cloth of this Nation. But today, we can 
honor this very special group of volun-
teer soldiers, those very first Ranger 
battalions who, during the Second 
World War, set the tone for the modern 
Ranger regiments. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
GARCI´A 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, I have no further speakers, 
and I am prepared to close. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time until Mr. HILL yields 
back. 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. DAVIDSON), a distinguished mem-
ber of the 75th Ranger Regiment. 
Mr. DAVIDSON. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Arkansas 
for yielding, and I thank everyone who 
has had a hand in taking time to create 
this bill, to create this Congressional 
Gold Medal, to recognize the limited 
number of World War II Army Rangers 
that we have still alive with us today, 
and, frankly, to honor the service of 
each and every one of them. 
The heroism and legacy of the Army 
Rangers go back to the Revolutionary 
War. Since we have fought, we have 
recognized the Ranger tactics and 
Ranger units that inspired the creation 
of the Rangers in World War II. So it is 
an incredible honor to have gotten the 
chance to complete the school and to 
serve in the 75th Ranger Regiment. 
After the Civil War, more than half a 
century passed without formal Ranger 
units in America. Mr. HILL just high-
lighted the history of how that was 
created, but from their very first en-
gagements in North Africa, it was clear 
the difference that they could make on 
the battlefield. 
The 3rd and 4th Ranger Battalions 
were trained in Africa by Darby. It is 
hard to think that such a young man 
who lost his life, gave his life in battle 
for our country, created such a legacy 
that has continued today. They began 
a tradition of wearing the scroll at

that time, and it has officially been 
adopted by today’s Ranger battalions. 
The Second and Fifth Ranger Battal-
ions participated in the D-day landings 
on Omaha Beach, Normandy, at Pointe 
du Hoc, and that is where the motto 
formally was coined: ‘‘Rangers Lead 
the Way.’’ 
They conducted missions, to include 
scaling cliffs there, overlooking Omaha 
Beach. They destroyed German gun 
emplacements, and they trained fires 
on the beachhead. 
The 6th Ranger Battalion operated in 
the Philippines. Our colleague already 
highlighted their famed largest rescue 
of more than 500 POWs in that battle. 
The 75th Ranger Regiment owes its 
heritage to the China-Burma-India the-
ater as Task Force Galahad on October 
3, 1943. It was during the campaigns in 
the China-Burma-India theater that 
the 
regiment 
became 
known 
as 
Merrill’s Marauders after its com-
mander, Major General Frank Merrill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I yield an 
additional 30 seconds to the gentleman 
from Ohio. 
Mr. DAVIDSON. Madam Speaker, the 
Ranger battalions were deactivated at 
the end of World War II, and we know 
of all their achievements since then. 
But it is fitting that we take this Gold 
Medal as an opportunity to honor the 
service of our World War II Army 
Rangers. 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I urge that our friends across the 
aisle and on this side of the aisle sup-
port this important bill to recognize 
those few Army Rangers who are still 
living and recognize the work of the es-
tablishment of the Ranger Corps in our 
Nation. 
Madam Speaker, I am so grateful 
that WARREN DAVIDSON was here today. 
Because of WARREN’s work on the 
House Committee on Financial Serv-
ices and in this body, truly he is the 
embodiment of ‘‘Rangers Lead the 
Way.’’ His reflection on the formation 
of the regiments makes us all think 
back to that historic anniversary of D- 
day and President Reagan’s speech at 
Pointe du Hoc when he paid tribute to 
those Rangers, ‘‘the boys of Pointe du 
Hoc.’’ 
Madam Speaker, there were, at that 
time, at the 40th anniversary, a whole 
row of Rangers, still living at Pointe 
du Hoc, who sat in front of President 
Reagan to hear him pay tribute to 
these brave men who scaled the cliffs 
at Normandy. Now, so many years 
later, we have lost so many more. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my friends 
in the Senate for this bill and for my 
friends in the House who worked on it. 
I urge all of the House to vote unani-
mously to support this Gold Medal to 
recognize the Greatest Generation of 
Army Rangers. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
GARCI´A 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman from Iowa, Senator ERNST, for 
sponsoring S. 1872, along with my col-
league, the gentleman from Colorado, 
Congressman CROW, for introducing its 
companion version in the House. 
The Army Rangers veterans of World 
War II deserve this accolade for their 
tireless courage, grit, determination, 
and dedication to their country. The 
heroism they demonstrated throughout 
the war made an incalculable contribu-
tion to the Allied victory. They are 
truly the embodiment of their motto: 
‘‘Rangers Lead the Way.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on S. 1872, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Illinois 
(Mr. 
GARCI´A) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, S. 1872. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from Il-
linois (Mr. GARCI´A) and the gentleman 
from Arkansas (Mr. HILL) each will 
control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Illinois. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. 
GARCI´A 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks on this legislation and 
to include extraneous material there-
on. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Illinois? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. 
GARCI´A 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 5911, the Fair Hiring in 
Banking Act. I thank the chair of our 
Subcommittee on Diversity and Inclu-
sion, Congresswoman JOYCE
BEATTY, 
for this important piece of legislation 
and the Members of both sides of the 
aisle who came together to support 
this bill. 
For far too long, American citizens, 
especially people of color, who have 
paid their debt to society have contin-
ued to face unnecessary barriers to em-
ployment within the financial services 
industry. 
Black and Latinx people are over- 
policed and face harsher prosecution 
and sentencing than their White peers 
for the same crimes. Arrest records for 
such convictions often prevent individ-
uals from securing employment, put-
ting them at higher risk of homeless-
ness and recidivism. 
Until recent changes by the FDIC 
and the NCUA, if a bank or credit 
union wanted to hire an individual who 
is highly qualified but happens to have 
a couple of minor drug possession vio-
lations on their record from 30 years 
ago, they would need to go through a 
cumbersome process for filing for a 
waiver from the FDIC or NCUA to 
allow them to hire this highly qualified 
individual. This is true whether the job 
that they are applying for is a janitor 
or a bank teller. 
These kinds of policies created en-
tirely unnecessary and unjustified bar-
riers to employment for highly quali-
fied individuals who have done their 
time and who deserve to be given a sec-
ond chance to reintegrate into society. 
This bill would codify and expand on 
these recent changes from the FDIC 
and NCUA to break down these bar-
riers. In particular, this bill reduces 
the lookback period for certain crimi-
nal charges from an indeterminate 
timeline to 7 years, or 5 years from the 
time a person is released from incar-
ceration. 
The bill also makes it clear that 
criminal offenses that have been ex-
punged, sealed, or dismissed are not in-
cluded in the FDIC or NCUA review of 
eligibility to work for an insured bank 
or credit union. 
This bill also would build on the ad-
ministrative changes that FDIC and 
NCUA have made by providing statu-
tory clarity and the definition of cer-
tain crimes of dishonesty that receive 
special treatment under their rules. 
We must ensure that those who have 
successfully paid their debt to society 
are not arbitrarily denied job opportu-
nities that they otherwise are qualified 
to do. 
Again, I thank Chair BEATTY for in-
troducing this important bill, and I 
urge my colleagues to join me in sup-
porting it. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 5911, the Fair Hiring in Banking 
Act. I appreciate the hard work of Con-
gresswoman BEATTY from Ohio in its 
preparation and passage. 
This bill is an important step toward 
continuing to expand employment op-
portunities for all Americans, includ-
ing ex-offenders. 
This bill is bipartisan. In fact, this 
bill codifies rules promulgated under 
the previous administration. The FDIC 
rules struck a balance between allow-
ing qualified individuals to obtain em-
ployment through the waiver process 
with the need to protect the safety and 
soundness of our banking system. 
Republicans and Democrats worked 
together on this bill to ensure that 
both of those objectives were met. In 
fact, I am proud to say that one place 
where we worked together to improve 
the bill was on the question of rehabili-
tation. Just because an individual once 
committed a crime does not automati-
cally mean that they can never be 
trusted, nor does it mean they are un-
qualified to work in our financial sys-
tem. 
Madam Speaker, it is our responsi-
bility as lawmakers to ensure that our 
banking system is safeguarded against 
bad actors, but it is also our responsi-
bility to ensure that those who are

qualified to work in America’s finan-
cial institutions have that opportunity 
to pursue happiness in that manner. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill and support 
those who have repaid their debt to so-
ciety as they begin that important 
journey of shifting back to society, 
building a new life, and pursuing happi-
ness. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1545 
Mr. 
GARCI´A 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. BEATTY). 
Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Illinois for 
yielding time, and I also thank him 
and the minority for their support of 
this bill. 
Madam Speaker, with the historic re-
covery since President Biden took of-
fice, there are now 11.5 million job 
openings in the United States. Unfortu-
nately, for 78 million justice-involved 
individuals—that is one out of every 
three American adults—those opportu-
nities are too often out of reach. 
Under current law, people with crimi-
nal records are prohibited from work-
ing in a federally insured financial in-
stitution like a bank or a credit union 
unless they get a waiver from the gov-
ernment. That is just not for major 
felonies 
but 
also 
for 
minor 
mis-
demeanors, like shoplifting or having 
an altercation. 
That is why my bill, H.R. 5911, the 
Fair Hiring in Banking Act, would up-
date the law to reduce barriers for indi-
viduals with criminal records seeking 
to work at a federally insured financial 
institution. 
Take the example of a young person 
that had an altercation with a police 
officer, a misdemeanor, and got 6 
months probation with no time served 
and without admitting guilt. They 
would fall under this. 
Specifically, this bill would reduce 
the existing lifetime ban to a more ef-
fective 7-year ban. Research shows that 
after 7 years, someone convicted of a 
felony is no more likely to commit a 
new offense than any other person. 
Importantly, my bill would keep in 
place the ban for people who are con-
victed of major financial offenses like 
bank fraud or money laundering. 
The bill also, as you have heard, codi-
fies some of the recent rulemaking of 
the FDIC to exempt those individuals 
whose crimes have been expunged or 
whose offenses happened before the age 
of 21. 
I would like to point out to my col-
leagues that this is a bipartisan bill 
that passed the Financial Services 
Committee without controversy. It has 
the backing of major financial services 
industry groups and a broad range of 
organizations, from the United States 
Chamber of Commerce to Public Cit-
izen. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill. 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Again, I thank Mrs. BEATTY for her 
work on this bill and her leadership as 
our subcommittee chair. 
I think it deserves reiterating that 
when 
former 
FDIC 
Chair 
Jelena 
McWilliams was at the helm, she is the 
one who led the way to issue rules that 
allow individuals convicted of certain 
crimes who are currently barred from 
employment in the banking industry to 
apply 
for 
an 
exemption. 
Chair 
McWilliams did, I think, an out-
standing job at the helm of the FDIC 
on behalf of the Trump administration. 
H.R. 5911 takes the approach that 
would codify—put into law—aspects of 
that rulemaking, as well as expand the 
employment opportunities at banks 
and credit unions. 
As Congresswoman BEATTY says, it 
does this, in part, by eliminating that 
waiver requirement for certain older 
criminal charges and reducing the 
lookback for crimes committed by per-
sons under the age of 21. 
This bill in no way eliminates the 
waiver requirement for crimes specific 
to a financial institution, and it 
doesn’t change the 10-year minimum 
probation period. 
This bipartisan bill codifies work 
done by the prior administration in an 
effective way that opens up, as I say, 
the opportunity for many people in 
this country to pursue happiness by 
way of a career in the financial serv-
ices industry. 
Madam Speaker, I spent almost four 
decades in the financial industry and 
have been involved in hiring hundreds 
of people in the banking industry, and 
this is the kind of a practical, common-
sense view that I think will help many 
of our banks find and retain key mem-
bers of their staff. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman from Ohio for her work. I en-
courage colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle to support the bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
GARCI´A 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
H.R. 5911 is just the next step toward 
addressing employment barriers for 
justice-involved 
individuals. 
More 
must be done, and I am glad that we 
can agree in a bipartisan manner to 
provide this opportunity with fair ac-
cess to employment opportunities at 
banks and credit unions. 
I thank Chair BEATTY for this bill, 
and I again urge my colleagues to join 
me in supporting this important H.R. 
5911. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Illinois 
(Mr. 
GARCI´A) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5911, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from Il-

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. 
GARCI´A 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days within which to revise and extend 
their remarks on this legislation and 
to insert extraneous material thereon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Illinois? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. 
GARCI´A 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to voice my 
support for H.R. 5914, the Empowering 
States to Protect Seniors from Bad Ac-
tors Act. I thank Mr. GOTTHEIMER for 
introducing this legislation that pro-
vides grants to State securities regu-
lators to support programs that pro-
tect senior investors. I also thank Mr. 
MCHENRY, the minority spokesperson, 
for working with us on this important 
bill. 
Madam Speaker, seniors are particu-
larly vulnerable to investment frauds, 
scams, and deceptive practices. In Oc-
tober of last year, in its annual report 
on elder fraud and abuse, the Depart-
ment of Justice reported that in 2020 
alone, seniors suffered over $1 billion in 
financial losses due to fraud. 
State securities and insurance regu-
lators are on the front lines of pro-
tecting our investors. The SEC, with 
the support of its Investor Advocate 
and Division of Enforcement, is well 
placed to evaluate and administer 
grant programs to bolster State regu-
lators’ efforts to better protect senior 
investors. 
This bill is widely supported by in-
vestor advocates and State securities 
regulators, including the North Amer-
ican Securities Administrators Asso-
ciation, the Consumer Federation of 
America, Public Citizen, and the CFA 
Institute. 
Madam Speaker, I, again, thank 
Members on both sides for coming to-
gether on this bill, and I urge its pas-
sage. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise today in support of H.R. 5914, 
the Empowering States to Protect Sen-
iors from Bad Actors Act. I thank the 
gentleman 
from 
New 
Jersey 
(Mr. 
GOTTHEIMER), my friend, for his work 
on this important legislation. 
Protecting investors, especially the 
most vulnerable to financial crimes 
and fraud, is a bipartisan effort. In the 
great State of Arkansas, our seniors 
make up 17.4 percent of our population 
and, across the Nation, with 54 million 
seniors over the age of 65, senior inves-
tors are a frequent target of invest-
ment fraudsters. 
It is especially important that we 
protect this population against fraud 
and punish bad actors, especially since 
these investors are largely on fixed in-
comes, living on their savings. 
H.R. 5914 better equips State securi-
ties regulators and their enforcement 
and investigative arms to pursue, pun-
ish, and deter financial crimes and 
fraud committed against our seniors. 
With this being a new grant program, 
important provisions have been in-
cluded that require an interim and 
final report to the Congress. This will 
allow us to determine the effectiveness 
of this program before it is renewed. 
I urge colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle to support this legislation, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
GARCI´A 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Texas (Ms. GARCIA).

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4746 
May 10, 2022 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today in support of my col-
league 
from 
New 
Jersey 
Mr. 
GOTTHEIMER’s bill, H.R. 5914, the Em-
powering States to Protect Seniors 
from Bad Actors Act, of which I am a 
proud cosponsor. 
Increasingly, senior investors and 
consumers have become the target of 
financial exploitation. Sadly, one in 
five older Americans have been victim-
ized by financial fraud. 
Madam Speaker, in today’s world of 
technology and telemarketing calls 
and robocalls, it is only getting worse. 
I can tell you, Madam Speaker, that 
I have had many lives in my life. I am 
like a cat. The first life I had was as a 
geriatric social worker. I saw it back 
then, but it was a little bit different. 
Now, with technology and all the high- 
tech things that one can do, it gets 
worse and worse. The numbers are get-
ting higher, and the dollar values are 
getting higher. 
Protecting seniors from financial ex-
ploitation is critical to ensuring that 
seniors can maintain a secure retire-
ment. 
This bill will help do that. It creates 
a senior investor protection grant pro-
gram to be implemented by the Securi-
ties and Exchange Commission, which 
will work closely with State securities 
regulators to protect older investors 
and educate seniors about financial 
matters and financial scams. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Chair-
woman WATERS
and Representative 
GOTTHEIMER
for bringing this bipar-
tisan bill before us today. I urge my 
colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this bill, 
and I look forward to seeing it come to 
fruition. 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, let me 
again urge our colleagues to provide 
support for this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
GARCI´A 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Madam Speaker, this is a strongly bi-
partisan bill aimed to strengthen sen-
ior investment protection programs at 
our States’ securities and insurance 
regulators. It will help protect millions 
of seniors who are vulnerable to scams 
and fraudsters. 
I thank Mr. GOTTHEIMER for his lead-
ership on this bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Illinois 
(Mr. 
GARCI´A) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5914, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed. 
SMALL BUSINESS MERGERS, AC-
QUISITIONS, SALES, AND BRO-
KERAGE 
SIMPLIFICATION 
ACT 
OF 2021 
Mr. 
GARCI´A 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, I move to suspend the rules 
and pass the bill (H.R. 935) to amend 
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to 
exempt from registration brokers per-
forming services in connection with 
the transfer of ownership of smaller 
privately held companies, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill.

resentatives of the United States of America in

‘‘(E) DEFINITIONS.—In this paragraph: 
‘‘(i) BUSINESS COMBINATION RELATED SHELL 
COMPANY.—The term ‘business combination

which is a shell company. 
‘‘(ii) CONTROL.—The term ‘control’ means 
the power, directly or indirectly, to direct

contract, or otherwise. There is a presump-
tion of control if, upon completion of a 
transaction, the buyer or group of buyers—

‘‘(II) In the fiscal year ending immediately

lowing conditions (determined in accordance 
with the historical financial accounting 
records of the company): 
‘‘(aa) The earnings of the company before 
interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortiza-
tion are less than $25,000,000. 
‘‘(bb) The gross revenues of the company 
are less than $250,000,000.

sion may by rule modify the dollar figures if 
the Commission determines that such a 
modification is necessary or appropriate in 
the public interest or for the protection of 
investors.

BROKER.—The 
term 
‘M&A 
broker’ means a broker, and any person asso-
ciated with a broker, engaged in the business

Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that

their remarks on this legislation and

b 1600 
Mr. 
GARCI´A 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge 
passage of H.R. 935, the Small Business 
Mergers, Acquisitions, Sales, and Bro-
kerage Simplification Act of 2021. I 
thank its lead sponsors, Congressman 
HUIZENGA, who serves as the ranking 
member of the Subcommittee on Inves-
tor Protection, Entrepreneurship and 
Capital Markets, as well as Congress-
woman MALONEY
who served as the 
chairwoman of the same subcommittee 
last Congress. 
Congressman 
HUIZENGA
and 
Con-
gresswoman MALONEY have come to-
gether to put forth a commonsense bill, 
which provides relief for small and 
midsize businesses who are looking to 
merge or sell their companies. 
Generally, mergers and acquisitions 
brokers act as intermediaries who con-
duct negotiated sales of privately held 
small- and medium-sized companies. 
These so-called M&A brokers essen-
tially help facilitate the transfer of 
ownership and control of such compa-
nies to a buyer. 
The Securities and Exchange Com-
mission, which oversees brokers, can 
become involved in these transactions 
because M&A brokers facilitate securi-
ties transactions when they connect a 
selling company to a buyer. 
In 2014, the SEC, via a no-action let-
ter, permitted M&A brokers to effect 
securities transactions with the trans-
fer of ownership of privately held com-
panies without registering as a broker- 
dealer. This no-action letter helps to 
account for the fact that small and 
midsize 
businesses 
have 
fewer 
re-
sources to pay for the services of reg-
istered broker-dealers, and ultimately 
do not pose the kinds of potentially 
systemic risks that larger companies 
may pose. 
H.R. 935 would codify the SEC 2014 
no-action letter and will further clarify 
and simplify the registration regime 
for M&A brokers, which will reduce 
costs for buyers and sellers. 
H.R. 935 is consistent with the North 
American 
Securities 
Administrators 
Association’s model State regulation 
for M&A brokers, which exempts M&A 
brokers from State securities legisla-
tion. 
Madam Speaker, I again thank Mem-
bers on both sides for coming together 
on this bill, and I urge its passage, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today on be-
half of the committee in support of 
H.R. 935, the Small Business Mergers, 
Acquisitions, 
Sales, 
and 
Brokerage 
Simplification Act. I particularly want 
to thank the bill’s sponsor, the gen-
tleman from Michigan (Mr. HUIZENGA), 
for his leadership on this issue on be-
half of small businesses across our 
country. The importance of small busi-
nesses to our economy, our job cre-
ation, and the innovation across our 
Nation cannot be overstated. They are 
the backbone of all of our commu-
nities. 
In October 2020, the SBA, the Small 
Business Administration, reported that 
there were 31.7 million small businesses 
in the United States. Yet, too often 
Democrats’ heavy-handed approach to 
business regulation in this country can 
put that success at risk. A one-size- 
fits-all regulatory approach dispropor-
tionately burdens small enterprises. 
For those looking to grow through 
merger and acquisition, they often face 
additional costs, the expense of that 
transaction. 
The committee has found that merg-
er and acquisition brokers provide cru-
cial services to small businesses whose 
owners desire to sell the business or 
merge with another firm. However, cer-
tain of these brokers face significant 
compliance costs, including SEC reg-
istration fees, which, of course, are 
passed on to their clients, the small 
businesses. 
H.R. 935 helps to alleviate these costs 
by amending the Exchange Act to cre-
ate a simplified registration system for 
these kinds of merger and acquisition 
brokers. 
The Securities and Exchange Com-
mission, the SEC, agrees with the 
premise of this bill. In fact, back in 
2014, the SEC issued a no-action letter 
to exempt certain M&A brokers from 
registration, and that no-action letter, 
Madam Speaker, is relied upon today. 
Without a change in law, the regu-
lated community is left in a state of 
uncertainty when it comes to Federal 
securities laws. The gentleman from 
Michigan’s bill will clarify, simplify, 
and provide much-needed certainty as 
to that process without compromising 
important investor protections. 
I also remind my colleagues that this 
bill has passed the House in previous 
Congresses. Therefore, our committee 
urges our colleagues to support H.R. 
935, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. 
GARCI´A 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, I have no further speakers 
and I am prepared to close. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time until Mr. HILL yields 
back. 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentleman from Michi-
gan (Mr. HUIZENGA), the author of this 
legislation and the ranking member of 
our Investor Protection, Entrepreneur-
ship, 
and 
Capital 
Markets 
Sub-
committee. 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of my legislation,

H4748 
May 10, 2022 
H.R. 935, the Small Business Mergers, 
Acquisitions, 
Sales, 
and 
Brokerage 
Simplification Act of 2021. 
Madam Speaker, this bill isn’t new, 
we have been here before. In fact, this 
will be the third instance that my leg-
islation has actually come to the floor. 
Each time Members of this body have 
unanimously supported the legislation 
before us today. I certainly hope that 
the third time is the charm. 
Let’s be clear. For small, privately- 
owned businesses, merger and acquisi-
tion advisers and business brokers per-
form crucial roles in preparing these 
privately held businesses for a sale or a 
merger by finding and screening poten-
tial business buyers or partners. These 
brokers play a vital role in navigating 
M&A transactions to successful out-
comes. 
Unfortunately, 
Federal 
securities 
regulations 
technically 
require 
an 
M&A broker to be registered and regu-
lated by the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, as well as FINRA, just 
like a Wall Street investment banker 
selling or buying publicly traded com-
panies. This is a problem long identi-
fied by both practitioners and the regu-
lators themselves. 
Whether it is a small, locally owned 
store in Holland, Michigan, my home-
town, or a Fortune 500 company, today, 
the same rules apply, regardless of the 
size of the business, the size of the 
transaction, or whether they are pub-
licly or privately held. 
Sadly, these last 2 years have only 
increased the need for my bill. Despite 
$5 trillion in COVID relief packages, 
which have often picked winners and 
losers, rising costs due to inflation are 
making it difficult for many small 
businesses to keep the lights on today. 
Recent data from the Federal Re-
serve itself showed that 85 percent of 
small businesses experienced financial 
hardships and difficulties in 2021. Ac-
cording to the Small Business Adminis-
tration, 68 percent of small business 
owners say they are having a hard time 
keeping and hiring staff. 
Nevertheless, small businesses con-
tinue to be the backbone of all of our 
local economies. Just look at my home 
State of Michigan, which is the home 
of very large companies like the auto-
makers, office furniture makers, chem-
ical companies, and medical device 
companies. But it also is a place where 
98 percent of businesses are small busi-
nesses—98 percent of them—and they 
employ literally half of the Michigan 
workforce. Just as important, for every 
$100 spent at a local business, roughly 
$68 stays in the local economy, accord-
ing to studies. 
Small businesses need to grow and 
have to do a couple of different things 
to be successful. For some that means 
they need to consolidate; some may 
need to restructure and try to recover 
from the challenges that have been ex-
acerbated by the pandemic or the econ-
omy or whatever it might be; and 
sometimes it may be a family succes-
sion plan that is happening within 
those 
small 
businesses. 
These 
innovators, entrepreneurs, and risk- 
takers are critical to our country’s 
economic growth and prosperity. We 
need to level the playing field that 
gives an unfair advantage to those Wall 
Street big guys. 
So, how did we get here? 
As was discussed, in 2006 merger and 
acquisition brokers attempted to ad-
dress their concerns with the Securi-
ties and Exchange Commission by de-
veloping a rule that would codify and 
simplify the ‘‘broker-dealer’’ regula-
tion. 
Unfortunately, due to the fallout 
from the great financial crisis, the SEC 
could not make the time for this rule-
making and make it a priority, which 
sent groups then to Congress for a leg-
islative fix. Along the way, this bill has 
enjoyed bipartisan and bicameral sup-
port. It passed the Committee on Fi-
nancial Services, not once, not twice, 
but now four times, including this last 
summer. 
In 2014, the chief counsel of the Divi-
sion of Trading of the Securities and 
Exchange 
Commission 
released 
the 
M&A broker no-action letter, which 
concluded that the SEC staff would not 
recommend enforcement against an un-
registered person who was engaged in 
facilitating a securities transaction 
solely related to the purchase or sale of 
a privately held company—regardless 
of the size of the company—provided 
certain enumerated conditions were 
met. 
H.R. 935 is consistent with the no-ac-
tion letter but will clarify and simplify 
the merger process for small businesses 
and M&A brokers. The bill codifies the 
extensive investor protections, while 
not affecting the SEC’s jurisdiction 
over M&A brokers. 
However, a no-action letter is not le-
gally binding. It cannot change securi-
ties laws. That is up to us, Congress. 
We must pass my legislation to provide 
legal clarity once and for all. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
NEWMAN). The time of the gentleman 
has expired. 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I yield an 
additional 30 seconds to the gentleman. 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Madam Speaker, we 
have been on this journey for nearly 10 
years, going back to the 113th Con-
gress. While many of the Members who 
served with me back then no longer re-
main, the challenges small businesses 
face have not dimmed. 
Madam Speaker, I recognize my col-
league, Representative BRIAN HIGGINS 
from New York, who has been the 
original cosponsor from day one, and 
he has been on this journey every step 
of the way, as well as Congresswoman 
MALONEY and Chairwoman WATERS and 
Ranking Member MCHENRY. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to pass this commonsense bi-
partisan legislation. 
Mr. 
GARCI´A 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, let me 
conclude the discussion on H.R. 935 by 
thanking my friend from Michigan for 
his persistent leadership over many 
Congresses on this topic. I urge my col-
leagues to support him in this effort, 
putting it over the goal line, and get-
ting a great result out of the Senate in 
the days ahead. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. 
GARCI´A 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Madam Speaker, I certainly hope the 
third time is the charm, as the sponsor 
of the bill has reiterated. H.R. 935 will 
provide legal certainty to certain fi-
nancial intermediaries who serve and 
support small business owners and buy-
ers. 
The bill would codify a longstanding 
no-action letter by the Securities and 
Exchange Commission. I thank its 
sponsors, Mr. HUIZENGA and Mrs. MALO-
NEY. 
Madam Speaker, I urge the speedy 
passage by the House, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Illinois 
(Mr. 
GARCI´A) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 935, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed. 
f 
RUSSIA AND BELARUS FINANCIAL 
SANCTIONS ACT OF 2022 
Mr. 
GARCI´A 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, I move to suspend the rules 
and pass the bill (H.R. 7066) to require 
United States financial institutions to 
ensure entities and persons owned or 
controlled by the institution comply 
with financial sanctions on the Russian 
Federation and the Republic of Belarus 
to the same extent as the institution 
itself, and for other purposes, as 
amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 7066 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Russia and 
Belarus Financial Sanctions Act of 2022’’.

tion.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from Il-
linois (Mr. GARCI´A) and the gentleman 
from Arkansas (Mr. HILL) each will 
control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Illinois. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. 
GARCI´A 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days within which to revise and extend 
their remarks on this legislation and 
include extraneous material thereon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Illinois? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. 
GARCI´A 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 7066, the Russia and Belarus Fi-
nancial Sanctions Act, sponsored by 
Congressman BRAD SHERMAN. 
Within days of Russia’s unjustified 
and inhumane invasion of Ukraine, 
President Biden demonstrated strong 
leadership when he brought our allies 
together to impose the toughest set of 
sanctions ever against a major world 
economy. 
The effectiveness of these sanctions 
will depend in large part on strong en-
forcement of these restrictions and 
prohibitions by the U.S. and by our al-
lies. 
b 1615 
U.S. financial institutions, including 
banks, credit card companies, broker- 
dealers, 
money 
service 
businesses, 
cryptocurrency exchanges, and mobile 
wallets, play a pivotal role in the im-
plementation of U.S. sanctions. There 
is some ambiguity, however, as to 
whether compliance by U.S. financial 
institutions extends to foreign entities 
that they own or control. 
Congressman 
SHERMAN’s 
bill 
will 
clarify that all foreign operations of 
U.S. financial institutions, including 
any subsidiaries domiciled outside the 
United States, must fully comply with 
all existing sanctions imposed in re-
sponse to Russia’s brutal war against 
Ukraine. 
I thank Congressman SHERMAN for 
his good work on this bipartisan bill, 
as well as Congressman HILL
for 
partnering with him. This is a com-
monsense clarification to ensure that 
we are doing all that we can to degrade 
the Russian economy until it is no 
longer able to fund its incursion into 
Ukraine and to show Russia that there 
are consequences for its actions. For 
these reasons, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE, 
Washington, DC, May 6, 2022. 
Hon. MAXINE WATERS, 
Chairwoman, Committee on Financial Services, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR
CHAIRWOMAN
WATERS: This letter 
confirms our mutual understanding regard-
ing H.R. 7066, the Russia and Belarus Finan-
cial Sanctions Act. Thank you for collabo-
rating with the Committee on Agriculture 
on the matters within our jurisdiction. 
The Committee on Agriculture will forego 
any further consideration of this bill so that 
it may proceed expeditiously to the House 
floor for consideration. However, by fore-
going consideration at this time, we do not 
waive any jurisdiction over any subject mat-
ter contained in this or similar legislation. 
We request that our Committee be consulted 
and involved as this bill moves forward so 
that we may address any remaining issues in 
our jurisdiction. The Committee on Agri-
culture also reserves the right to seek ap-
pointment of an appropriate number of con-
ferees to any House-Senate conference in-
volving this or similar legislation and ask 
that you support any such request. 
We would appreciate a response to this let-
ter confirming this understanding with re-
spect to H.R. 7066, and request that a copy of 
our letters on this matter be published in the 
Congressional Record during Floor consider-
ation. 
Sincerely, 
DAVID SCOTT, 
Chairman. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON FINANCIAL SERVICES, 
Washington, DC, May 9, 2022. 
Hon. DAVID SCOTT, 
Chairman, Committee on Agriculture, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MISTER CHAIRMAN: I am writing to 
acknowledge your letter dated May 9, 2022, 
regarding the waiver by the Committee on 
Agriculture of any jurisdictional claims over 
the matters contained in H.R. 7066, the ‘‘Rus-
sian and Belarus Financial Sanctions Act.’’ 
The Committee on Financial Services con-
firms our mutual understanding that your 
Committee does not waive any jurisdiction 
over the subject matter contained in this or 
similar legislation, and your Committee will 
be appropriately consulted and involved as 
this bill or similar legislation moves forward 
so that we may address any remaining issues 
within your jurisdiction. 
The Committee on Financial Services fur-
ther recognizes your interest in appointment 
of outside conferees from the Committee on 
Agriculture should this bill or similar lan-
guage be considered in a conference with the 
Senate. 
Pursuant to your request, I will ensure 
that this exchange of letters is included in 
the Congressional Record during Floor con-
sideration of the bill. I appreciate your co-
operation regarding this legislation and look 
forward to continuing to work with you as 
this measure moves through the legislative 
process. 
Sincerely, 
MAXINE WATERS, 
Chairwoman. 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my friend 
from Illinois for managing the bill. It 
is also good to be on this House floor 
again talking on an issue that we share 
in common, and that is the importance 
of sanctions being successful as a part 
of our strategy to get Mr. Putin out of 
Ukraine. So it has been very good to 
partner with my friend from California 
(Mr. SHERMAN) on H.R. 7066, the Russia 
and Belarus Financial Sanctions Act. 
Madam Speaker, U.S. financial insti-
tutions are already prohibited from en-
gaging in transactions with sanctioned 
Russian entities, but H.R. 7066 extends 
that prohibition to entities owned or 
controlled by U.S. financial institu-
tions as well. This is a commonsense 
provision, and it has helped other sanc-
tions programs be more successful, and 
I cite particularly the efforts to isolate 
Iran and North Korea. 
Under the President’s ongoing Russia 
measures, anyone providing support to 
a sanctioned person runs the risk of 
being sanctioned themselves. We know 
that U.S. financial institutions are 
fully aware of us. Congress expects 
their full compliance and to be watch-
ful on their affiliates that may also do 
business with Russia. 
As the U.S. continues to pressure the 
Putin regime, we must seek and pre-
vent opportunities for Russia to find 
loopholes for non-U.S. financial insti-
tutions.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4750 
May 10, 2022 
I am glad to see that our current 
sanctions on Russia are making it 
more difficult for Moscow to find alter-
natives to Western banks. However, op-
portunities remain for us to tighten 
these multilateral sanctions and in-
crease pressure on Russia, particularly 
in Russia’s energy exports. Both the 
United States and Europe continue to 
provide carve-outs for energy trans-
actions, and the next step on the sanc-
tions ladder is to close these loopholes 
so that Russia cannot receive hard cur-
rency by selling oil and gas. 
I hope that Republicans and Demo-
crats can work together to pursue this 
kind of policy and continue to collabo-
rate on how to tighten the financial 
noose around Putin. Just as we worked 
on this bill together, I hope Members 
on both sides of the aisle will come to-
gether and support the work of my 
friend from California. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
GARCI´A 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. SHERMAN). 
Mr. SHERMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of H.R. 7066, the Russia 
and Belarus Financial Sanctions Act. 
I thank Chairwoman WATERS, Rank-
ing Member MCHENRY, and my co-lead 
on this bill, the gentleman from Ar-
kansas (Mr. HILL), for their work in 
bringing forward this legislation. 
This bill passed unanimously in the 
Financial 
Services 
Committee 
in 
March. The Russia and Belarus Finan-
cial Sanctions Act represents a signifi-
cant step forward in imposing sanc-
tions on Russia and on Belarus for 
their historic aggression. 
I have spent 26 years on the Foreign 
Affairs Committee and well over a dec-
ade on the Congressional Ukrainian 
Caucus. I understand the importance of 
financial sanctions in changing Rus-
sia’s behavior in part through my dis-
cussions with President Zelenskyy and 
other Ukrainian leaders who have 
pointed out that that is their Achilles’ 
heel. 
Chairwoman WATERS and I have for 
several years been pushing to prohibit 
Americans from purchasing all new 
Russian sovereign debt and have passed 
that through the House several times. 
But that was before the invasion. 
As has been explained by my col-
leagues who have spoken, we now have 
effective sanctions prohibiting U.S. fi-
nancial institutions from engaging in a 
wide range of transactions with Rus-
sian and Belarusian individuals and en-
tities—particularly the Russian Cen-
tral Bank—many of the state-owned 
enterprises and financial institutions, 
and oligarchs. 
But what people have not focused on 
is that these sanctions apply only to 
U.S. persons and do not apply to the 
over 1,000 foreign subsidiaries of Amer-
ican financial institutions. As we meet 
here today, foreign subsidiaries owned 
by U.S. financial institutions are en-
gaging in the very financial trans-
actions that we have prohibited if en-
gaged by a U.S. institution. It is time 
to deal with this gaping loophole. That 
is why this bill requires all U.S. finan-
cial institutions to prevent their for-
eign subsidiaries from engaging in 
transactions prohibited to U.S.-based 
financial institutions. 
Madam Speaker, I think it is impor-
tant that this bill has acquired bipar-
tisan support and shows that Congress 
comes together to deal with this out-
rageous invasion, and I urge my col-
leagues to support this timely legisla-
tion. 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
I thank my good friend, Mr. SHER-
MAN, on this bill, and let me remind the 
leaders of the Kremlin that Americans 
on both sides of this aisle are unified in 
our efforts to cut off the economic flow 
to the Kremlin, and we share that ob-
jective with our friends in Europe. 
When I was in Europe a few weeks ago, 
just before Easter, leaders in both Po-
land and Romania reiterated that they 
are prepared to go further in economic 
sanctions against the Putin regime and 
Moscow. 
So it needs to be clear that Ameri-
cans, while we are fully on board with 
our 
transatlantic 
friends 
in 
con-
straining Mr. Putin, the announced 
sanctions by President Biden and the 
sanctions that we are talking about 
today are just a beginning point as this 
Congress works to provide lethal as-
sistance with 31 countries to help the 
Ukrainians defend themselves. This 
Congress helps provide humanitarian 
assistance, along with countries from 
all around the world and the United 
Nations, to help the Ukrainians have 
the medicine, food, and material that 
they need to survive in this really out-
rageous and unprecedented attack by 
the Russians on the sovereign nation of 
Ukraine. 
So it is important to note here that 
we are here not for the last time to 
talk about how to fine-tune, how to 
tighten, and how to direct our eco-
nomic sanctions more successfully. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my friend 
from California for our collaboration 
on this. I encourage all Members on 
both sides of the aisle to support it, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. 
GARCI´A 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. The Russia and Belarus Fi-
nancial Sanctions Act was passed by 
our committee with bipartisan support. 
It provides an important clarification 
to ensure financial institutions follow 
the law and implement sanctions on 
Russia and Belarus. 
Madam Speaker, I urge Members to 
support this bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Illinois 
(Mr. 
GARCI´A) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 7066, as 
amended. 
The question was taken.

Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays.

ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered.

UKRAINE COMPREHENSIVE DEBT

GARCI´A 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, I move to suspend the rules

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. 
GARCI´A 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members have 5 legislative days to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material thereon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Illinois? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. 
GARCI´A 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 7081, the Ukraine Com-
prehensive Debt Payment Relief Act 
which I introduced earlier this year. 
Ukraine needs significant financial re-
sources to sustain its defense against 
Putin’s brutal invasion, so my bill 
would provide Ukraine with urgently 
needed relief from crushing debt pay-
ments to international financial insti-
tutions like the International Mone-
tary Fund, or IMF, and the World 
Bank. 
Let me provide some context. This 
year alone Ukraine owes $4.6 billion— 
more than $20 billion in total—to inter-
national institutions. And even as it is 
under siege from the invading Russian 
Army, Ukraine still owes payments on 
that debt. For example, the IMF im-
poses additional surcharges on coun-
tries that already have high levels of 
debt or are behind on their payments. 
Ukraine is one of those countries. So 
while it fights a war against Russia, 
Ukraine also owes an estimated $14 
million in surcharges to the IMF each 
month—money 
that 
Ukraine 
des-
perately needs to defend itself and to 
provide vital services to its citizens, 
and, once the war is over, to focus on 
reconstruction. 
These 
surcharges, 
along with loans and debt payments, 
will hold Ukraine back not only during 
this war but for years to come. 
Now is not the time for development 
institutions to come collecting debts, 
and that is exactly why I introduced 
the Ukraine Comprehensive Debt Pay-
ment Relief Act. My bill would direct 
U.S. representatives at these institu-
tions to support the immediate suspen-
sion of Ukraine’s debt payments, direct 
our government to coordinate com-
prehensive debt relief for Ukraine from 
government and commercial creditors, 
and direct U.S. Representatives to sup-
port additional financial assistance for 
Ukraine on generous terms. 
I would also like to note key lan-
guage that was put forth by Represent-
ative BEATTY which was included in the 
bill. The language makes clear that the 
financial assistance called for in the 
bill should include economic support 
for refugees from Ukraine for countries 
receiving refugees. It specifically in-
cludes support for refugees of African 
descent. African refugees from Ukraine 
have been experiencing discrimination 
in the current crisis. According to 
press 
reports, 
there 
have 
been 
incidences where African refugees from 
Ukraine have been stuck at the border, 
unable to cross safely while suffering 
through the cold without food or shel-
ter. By adopting this bill, we will send 
a strong statement of support to these 
refugees. 
I thank Chair WATERS, Ranking 
Member MCHENRY, and all those on the 
Financial 
Services 
Committee 
who 
helped get this bill to the House floor 
in a timely manner. 
Madam Speaker, I urge support for 
H.R. 7081, a simple but urgent measure 
to let Ukraine focus its limited re-
sources on defense, aid, and reconstruc-
tion, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
b 1630 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 7081, the Ukraine Comprehensive 
Debt Payment Relief Act. 
Last 
month, 
Ukraine’s 
President 
Zelenskyy gave a speech about rebuild-
ing a free, sovereign, and democratic 
future for his sovereign nation of 
Ukraine. While it seems distant now, 
with Putin’s war raging, we, in fact, 
must start to think about the coun-
try’s eventual rebuilding, recovery, and 
rebirth. 
The United States and our allies 
must support Ukraine to ensure that 
its debt repayments don’t overwhelm 
the country while it continues to con-
front Russia’s invasion and keeps up 
the fight every day, not only on the 
war front but on the home front in try-
ing to keep its domestic operations 
functioning. 
In fact, Madam Speaker, Ukraine is 
spending roughly some $5 billion a day 
in its core functions for government. 
So while Putin is pulverizing villages, 
plazas, parks, and ports, the Ukrainian 
Government presses on, serving its 
citizens. 
But when this war is over, Ukraine 
will face an enormous financing need 
that will require international finan-
cial institutions to step in with sup-
port. 
I am pleased to support this legisla-
tion, which calls for a suspension of 
Ukraine’s debt service payments and 
urges debt relief from multilateral and 
bilateral creditors. 
When you think of the hundreds of 
billions and certainly possibly trillions 
of dollars of long-term reconstruction 
that faces Ukraine, you have to recog-
nize the need now for conserving cash 
flow and conserving its resources. 
That rebuilding is going to take im-
mense good government; investment in 
the country’s municipal, health, and 
education infrastructure; energy resil-
ience; and energy independence. That 
will 
be 
a 
special 
opportunity 
to 
strengthen democracy and the rule of 
law in Europe. 
Prior to the war, Ukraine’s economy 
had stagnated for too long. Therefore, 
international 
financial 
institutions 
should 
assess 
how 
best 
to 
foster 
Ukrainian industries that can expand 
exports, earn hard currency, and move 
forward. 
This bill is an important step in our 
bilateral and multilateral efforts to 
help Ukraine mush on, get through this 
war, maintain its services to its citi-
zens, and fight Putin to the end with 
his leaving the country. 
This legislation was reported out of 
our committee unanimously, and I 
look forward to its passage today. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
GARCI´A 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from Ohio (Mrs. BEATTY). 
Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
I rise in support of H.R. 7081 as one of 
the many actions this Congress has 
taken to support Ukraine in its fight 
against Putin’s atrocities. 
Since the invasions, the U.N. esti-
mates that nearly 6 million refugees 
have fled Ukraine to neighboring coun-
tries, the largest refugee crisis since 
the 1990s. 
That is why I authored the provision 
in this bill to use the United States’ 
position on international financial in-
stitutions—the World Bank, IMF, et 
cetera—to encourage economic support 
for refugees. 
The provision specifically makes it 
clear 
that 
this 
economic 
support 
should include refugees of African de-
scent who have been experiencing dif-
ficulties and discrimination as they 
flee danger. 
I express my thanks to Chairwoman 
WATERS
and 
Ranking 
Member 
MCHENRY for working with me and es-
pecially to the bill’s sponsor, Congress-
man GARCI´A. I urge my colleagues to 
support this excellent bill. 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I reit-
erate my thanks to my friend from Illi-
nois for his work on this bill as one key 
component of helping Ukraine have the 
financial wherewithal, the financial re-
sources, to fight back against Putin’s 
illegal invasion. 
I remind my colleagues that this debt 
suspension has a 7-year sunset in the 
bill, that this is in no way a panacea, 
but it is an absolutely critical element 
in the cash flow conservation for the 
Ukrainians as they attempt to deliver 
the important services that they have

ISOLATE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT 
OFFICIALS ACT OF 2022 
Mr. 
GARCI´A 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, I move to suspend the rules 
and pass the bill (H.R. 6891) to exclude 
government officials of the Russian 
Federation from certain international 
meetings, and for other purposes, as 
amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 6891 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Isolate Rus-
sian Government Officials Act of 2022’’. 
SEC. 2. EXCLUSION OF GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS 
OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION. 
(a) POLICY
OF
THE UNITED STATES.—It is 
the policy of the United States to seek to ex-
clude government officials of the Russian 
Federation, to the maximum extent prac-
ticable, from participation in meetings, pro-
ceedings, and other activities of the fol-
lowing organizations: 
(1) Group of 20. 
(2) Bank for International Settlements. 
(3) Basel Committee for Banking Stand-
ards. 
(4) Financial Stability Board. 
(5) International Association of Insurance 
Supervisors. 
(6) International Organization of Securities 
Commissions. 
(b) IMPLEMENTATION.—The Secretary of the 
Treasury, the Board of Governors of the Fed-
eral Reserve System, and the Securities and 
Exchange Commission, as the case may be, 
shall take all necessary steps to advance the 
policy set forth in subsection (a). 
(c) TERMINATION.—This section shall have 
no force or effect on the earlier of— 
(1) the date that is 5 years after the date of 
enactment of this Act; or 
(2) 30 days after the date that the President 
reports to Congress that the government of 
the Russian Federation has ceased its desta-
bilizing activities with respect to the sov-
ereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. 
(d) WAIVER.—The President may waive the 
application of this section if the President 
reports to the Congress that the waiver is in 
the national interest of the United States 
and includes an explanation of the reasons 
therefor. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from Il-
linois (Mr. GARCI´A) and the gentleman 
from Arkansas (Mr. HILL) each will 
control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Illinois. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. 
GARCI´A 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous 
material thereon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Illinois? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. 
GARCI´A 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 6891, the Isolate Russian Govern-
ment Officials Act, sponsored by the 
Congresswoman from Missouri (Mrs. 
WAGNER). I commend her for her work 
on this bill, and I appreciate that she 
worked with Chairwoman WATERS to 
improve the bill. 
The Russian Government partici-
pates, along with the U.S., in a wide 
range of international organizations 
that are intended to promote collabo-
ration and harmonize global standards 
on critical issues like financial sta-
bility. However, Russia shattered any 
notion of international harmony by 
violating the sovereignty of Ukraine 
and its people with Putin’s unlawful in-
vasion. 
As such, Russia should no longer 
have a seat at a table of meetings of a 
wide range of important bodies, includ-
ing the Basel Committee and the Inter-
national Organization of Securities 
Commissions. 
I applaud the Biden administration 
for securing the suspension of Russia 
from the Bank for International Settle-
ments and the Financial Stability 
Board. It is time to kick the Kremlin 
out of every other room and pass H.R. 
6891. 
Madam Speaker, for these reasons, I 
urge my colleagues to support this bill, 
and I reserve the balance of my time.

Sincerely, 
MAXINE WATERS, 
Chairwoman. 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of Congresswoman WAGNER’s bill, 
H.R. 6891, the Isolate Russian Govern-
ment Officials Act. 
As the United States and our allies 
confront 
Russia’s 
aggression 
in 
Ukraine, we must show the world that 
the Congress can unite around bipar-
tisan legislation to hold the Putin re-
gime accountable. 
I thank my friend, Congresswoman 
WAGNER, who recognized early that 
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine required a 
complete rethinking of Moscow’s in-
volvement and engagement in our 
international organizations.

WAGNER

nently qualified for that as she is a

May 10, 2022 
senior member of both the House Fi-
nancial Services Committee and the 
House Foreign Affairs Committee and 
has had the distinction of serving our 
Nation abroad as our Ambassador. 
Congresswoman WAGNER’s bill would 
establish that U.S. policy is to exclude 
Russia from participating in key inter-
national bodies until Moscow with-
draws completely from Ukraine. 
I think Americans join us in knowing 
that it is illogical and unreasonable for 
a country that threatens peace in Eu-
rope and financial stability globally to 
take part in overseeing the world’s 
many multilateral financial system or-
ganizations. 
Our strong sanctions against the 
Putin regime have been vital to raising 
the costs and imposing new ones, as we 
have talked about on this floor today, 
on Moscow, on Putin’s leadership, on 
his cronies. But Moscow must pay a 
diplomatic cost as well. 
We were in Romania and Poland, 
many of us on both sides of the aisle, 
over the last few weeks, and we have 
also had some extraordinary presen-
tations by the distinguished Ambas-
sador to the United Nations from 
Ukraine. Universally, diplomats in the 
European Union, across Europe, and at 
the United Nations are asking them-
selves: Are we really going to have 
business as usual when a member of 
the U.N. Security Council invades an-
other United Nations member and de-
stroys a country? 
Today, we are proposing to employ a 
heavy diplomatic cost on Moscow, and 
that means leaving Russian Govern-
ment officials on the outside, Madam 
Speaker, looking in. 
After H.R. 6891 was introduced, Rus-
sia was suspended from the Bank for 
International Settlements and agreed 
to no longer participate in the meet-
ings of the FSB, the Financial Sta-
bility Board. These moves would be 
codified in law when Mrs. WAGNER’s 
bill is enacted. We now need the G20 to 
follow suit. 
While it is a symbolic step for Treas-
ury Secretary Yellen and other allied 
officials to walk out of the recent G20 
meeting last month, where Russian 
representatives were attending, this 
Congress and our transatlantic part-
ners need to do more. 
Under this bill, a hostile Russia 
would have no future in the G20. H.R. 
6891 presents a clear choice for the 
Putin regime: End your destabilizing, 
illegal violations of Ukrainian sov-
ereignty or remain an international pa-
riah. 
Our response to Putin’s invasion 
should signal to China a similar fate 
awaits Beijing should it ever decide to 
follow in Putin’s ill-conceived foot-
steps. The costs imposed on Russia 
through this bill foreshadow costs that 
China or any other nation bears if it 
violates the international norms of be-
havior. 
This strong measure passed unani-
mously in the House Financial Services 
Committee, and I, too, welcome its pas-
sage on this House floor. I thank Chair 
WATERS for her work on H.R. 6891 and 
appreciate the strong bipartisan work 
on this important national security, 
economic security, and diplomatic cost 
measure. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. 
WAGNER), the author of H.R. 6891. Let 
me reiterate Congresswoman WAGNER’s 
experience as the vice chairwoman of 
the House Financial Services Com-
mittee and vice chairwoman for the 
House Foreign Affairs Committee. 
b 1645 
Mrs. WAGNER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend from Arkansas (Mr. 
HILL), who is managing this set of Fi-
nancial Services Committee sanctions 
against Russia, for yielding me the 
time. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
my bill, H.R. 6891, the Isolate Russian 
Government Officials Act, a bipartisan 
bill that would exclude Russian Gov-
ernment officials from participating in 
key international bodies until Moscow 
puts a stop to its brutal and utterly 
unprovoked war on Ukraine. 
These Russian officials would be ex-
cluded from international bodies, in-
cluding the G20 and other organiza-
tions that oversee the world’s financial 
system. Taking part in these groups’ 
proceedings should be out of the ques-
tion for a country that has ended dec-
ades of peace in Europe and threatened 
financial stability globally. 
As we know, the U.S. and our allies 
have 
levied 
punishing 
sanctions 
against the Putin regime, and these 
measures have imposed immense costs 
on Moscow, but there must be diplo-
matic costs as well. That means leav-
ing Russian Government officials on 
the outside of every one of these key 
organizations looking in. 
After I introduced H.R. 6891, I was 
pleased to see the President called 
upon Russia to be ejected from the G20, 
and this legislation would ensure that 
Treasury and the Federal Reserve take 
all necessary steps to advance this as 
U.S. policy and law. 
The Financial Services Committee, 
on a bipartisan basis, has traditionally 
pursued clear objectives in its national 
security legislation. Our bills are a 
means to an end, and my legislation is 
no exception. 
While H.R. 6891 takes a hard stance 
against Russian officials, it provides an 
off-ramp for Moscow if, and only if, 
Putin chooses to end the violence in 
Ukraine. There is also waiver author-
ity so that the executive branch can 
have maximum leverage when negoti-
ating an end to the Russian hostilities. 
But let’s be crystal clear. Just as 
launching an illegal and unilateral at-
tack on Ukraine was wholly Putin’s 
choice, and his alone, so too is it his 
choice to bring Russia back into the 
fold of the international community by 
ending his war on Ukraine. 
China, and other countries and adver-
saries, are watching our response to 
Russia closely, and our resolve in the 
face of Putin’s invasion should signal 
to China, and others, that it will be-
come an international pariah if Beijing 
ever follows Moscow’s playbook. 
Benefiting 
from 
participation 
in 
international organizations, including 
the ones in my bill, calls for a basic 
level of commitment to international 
order. We must not let others take this 
for granted. 
Again, I thank the chairman and the 
ranking member for their support of 
H.R. 6891, and I urge my colleagues to 
support the bill, the Isolate Russian 
Government Officials Act. 
Mr. 
GARCI´A 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY), 
who is a member of the Committee on 
Foreign Affairs. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend from Illinois for his 
indulgence. 
I rise in strong support of the effort 
of my good friend and colleague, Mrs. 
WAGNER of Missouri, on H.R. 6891. I 
think it is important that we speak 
with one voice in this body that the 
brutal, reckless, and unprovoked inva-
sion of Russia in Ukraine and the ter-
rible toll it has taken on the Ukrainian 
people is not acceptable, not to the 
American people and certainly not to 
this Congress. 
Taking the steps enumerated in Mrs. 
WAGNER’s bill is a very important mat-
ter in isolating Russia and in raising 
the cost to Russia of this reckless and 
brutal invasion. 
It is not okay to target hospitals. It 
is not okay to target innocent citizens. 
It is not okay to target children, in-
cluding children’s cancer hospitals, 
with missiles raining down on their 
heads and killing the innocents. 
It is not okay in the 21st century to 
settle disputes kinetically, that is to 
say, by military invasion. Until and 
unless Russia stops its actions in 
Ukraine and withdraws from its sov-
ereign territory completely, we need to 
stand as one with our allies and as one 
Nation in saying that we will resist, 
and we will assist the Ukrainian people 
in resisting this ruthless action by 
Vladimir Putin and his kleptocrats in 
Moscow. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my friend 
from Missouri for her leadership, and I 
am proud to support this effort. 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume for 
the purpose of closing. 
First, I reiterate my thanks to Mrs. 
WAGNER for her leadership on this bill 
and as she has done so well ably, even 
as a diplomat in our own House of Rep-
resentatives, 
provided 
leadership 
through the Committees on Foreign 
Affairs and Financial Services on this 
issue. 
Secondly, let me reiterate Mr. CON-
NOLLY’s comment that we do speak in 
one voice on this House floor as it re-
lates to Putin’s illegal, unprovoked in-
vasion of a sovereign nation, Ukraine, 
particularly egregious for a permanent

member of the U.N. Security Council, 
to place the world in this position. But 
I think we do have to take to heart 
Ukrainian Ambassador to the United 
Nations’ view of ‘‘we are not going to 
have business as usual.’’ 
So while we speak as one voice here 
in the people’s House, let’s encourage 
the executive branch, under President 
Biden, to also speak with one voice on 
this point. Let’s not have weasel words 
from former Secretary Kerry talking 
about, ‘‘Oh, but we need the Russians’ 
support on climate’’ or Jake Sullivan 
saying, ‘‘Oh, but we have got to have 
Russian support negotiating with Iran 
on the failed JCPOA reentry project of 
this administration.’’ 
I agree it is not business as usual, 
and you can’t have it both ways when 
you are having Ukraine, a nation of 
over 40 million people, the size of the 
State of Texas, in the heart of central 
Europe, invaded by a permanent mem-
ber of the U.N. Security Council. It is 
outrageous. They don’t have a seat at 
the table, and this bill demonstrates it 
and demonstrates that strong bipar-
tisan view in the House of Representa-
tives that Putin doesn’t deserve a seat 
at the table. 
I think Americans, as I said earlier, 
believe it is illogical and unreasonable 
for a country that threatens peace on 
the Continent of Europe and financial 
stability globally in any way, shape, or 
form, take part in overseeing the eco-
nomic affairs of our international 
order. 
Therefore, I reiterate that this bipar-
tisan support for Ukraine is fully em-
braced in H.R. 6891. I urge all Members 
to support it, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
GARCI´A 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
I, again, thank Representative WAG-

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

SEC. 2. SPECIAL DRAWING RIGHTS EXCHANGE 
PROHIBITION.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Illinois. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. 
GARCI´A 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks on this legislation and 
to insert extraneous material thereon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Illinois? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. 
GARCI´A 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I commend the gen-
tleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL) for 
his leadership on H.R. 6899, the Russia 
and Belarus SDR Exchange Prohibition 
Act of 2022. 
Mr. HILL’s legislation would codify 
the Biden administration’s current po-
sition against exchanging any Special 
Drawing Rights, or SDRs, held by Rus-
sia or Belarus for U.S. dollars. 
SDRs are a special reserve asset cre-
ated by the International Monetary 
Fund to supplement the official re-
serves of its members. SDR allocations 
are distributed to all IMF member 
countries 
in 
proportion 
to 
their 
shareholding in the fund, and countries 
can hold their SDRs as part of their 
precautionary reserve balances or con-
vert them for hard currency to finance 
balance of payments needs, pay for im-
ports, adjust the composition of their 
reserves, or pay back IMF loans. 
In August of 2021, the IMF issued a 
$650 billion general allocation of SDRs, 
of which $275 billion went to emerging 
market and developing countries to 
help transform the global pandemic 
crisis into a fair and resilient economic 
recovery. 
Given the recent sanctions placed by 
the G7 group of nations against Rus-
sia’s central bank and other Russian fi-
nancial institutions, as well as the 
international sanctions against the 
banking sector in Belarus, it would be 
difficult for Russia or Belarus to find 
any country willing to convert their 
SDRs, especially since such a trans-
action would be viewed by the rest of 
the world as a hostile action. 
Even if the central bank of Russia 
were able to acquire a key freely usable 
currency, such as U.S. dollars, euros, 
yen, or pounds, as a result of an SDR 
transaction, current sanctions would 
effectively immobilize those assets. 
I think it is useful for Congress to re-
inforce the administration’s position 
against the conversion of SDRs held by 
Russia or Belarus, and I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of my legislation being considered 
here on the House floor, the Russia and 
Belarus SDR Exchange Prohibition 
Act, H.R. 6899. 
This legislation would prohibit the 
United States from exchanging any 
Special Drawing Rights, or SDRs, with 
Russia or Belarus. These SDRs are re-
serve assets issued by the International 
Monetary Fund, the IMF. 
This bill would also require the Sec-
retary of the Treasury to work with 
other IMF member countries to pre-
vent them from doing the same. 
Now, let’s be blunt. We should be es-
pecially concerned by Russia’s ability 
to exchange its SDRs for Chinese 
renminbi or pledge their SDRs for a 
loan that isn’t transparent to the world 
in support of Russia’s illegal invasion 
by a country such as China, using those 
reserve assets.

This is a particular risk, as Moscow 
is increasingly forced to potentially 
turn to China in response to global 
sanctions imposed on the nation of 
Russia and its central bank. Mr. 
Speaker, the world is watching, and we 
must send a message that the United 
States is not standing idly by and al-
lowing SDR assets to be used to fi-
nance the destruction of Ukraine. 
Russia alone owns over $25 billion of 
these IMF reserve assets, and these 
IMF assets represent unconditional li-
quidity and a source of financing for 
the Kremlin. It is important to note 
that of that $25 billion of SDR assets 
on the books of the Russian central 
bank, more than $17 billion of it was 
just recently gifted to czar Putin last 
year, through the Biden administra-
tion’s $650 billion green-lighting of a 
general SDR allocation by the IMF. 
Nearly a billion dollars in SDRs were 
also awarded to Belarus last year, a 
move that our colleagues from the bi-
partisan Friends of Belarus Caucus 
warned would be rewarding state-spon-
sored violence against civilians. 
Now, Mr. Speaker, on this House 
floor, in our committee, and in many 
other forums over many months, I 
urged Treasury Secretary Yellen and 
the administration not to pursue this 
flawed policy. There were superior pol-
icy choices with an eye to benefiting 
the poorest nations on our globe that 
have had the hardest macroeconomic 
impact as a result of COVID–19, supe-
rior policy choices, far superior to an 
across-the-board general allocation, be-
cause not only do wealthy countries 
get that allocation and the poor coun-
tries get it, but the foes of freedom get 
the allocation. We are back on this 
House floor today talking about the 
ramifications of when that happens. 
Two foes of freedom today, no doubt, 
are Belarus and Russia. 
My warnings came long before the in-
vasion of Ukraine began, but those 
warnings were not heeded. Today, we 
come to the House floor united as a bi-
partisan leadership team saying under 
no circumstances should the central 
banks of Belarus and Russia in any 
way, shape, or form have access to 
their special drawing rights, pledge 
their special drawing rights, or ex-
change their special drawing rights, 
and we once again urge our Treasury 
Secretary to put up the guardrails, lay 
those rules of the road out, prohibit 
anyone who is a member of the IMF 
from doing likewise. That work with 
our allies at the IMF is critical to en-
sure that China or some other nation 
doesn’t throw Vladimir Putin an SDR 
lifeline. 
Passing this bill, too, sends a clear 
signal to Beijing that the United 
States will not tolerate such a move, 
and I would argue our European Trans-
atlantic partners would not tolerate 
such a move. 
This bill also requires the adminis-
tration to oppose conventional loans to 
Russia or Belarus if they approach the 
IMF as a lender of last resort. This is 
important, because as we seek to exert 
maximum pressure against these re-
gimes, we cannot, as Mr. SHERMAN 
talked about a few minutes ago, allow 
loopholes to be exploited for potential 
assistance from the IMF. 
H.R. 6899 presents a clear choice to 
Russia and Belarus: End the desta-
bilizing activities in Ukraine or find 
yourself shut off from emergency li-
quidity just like on this floor we have 
talked about shutting off diplomatic 
efforts at global responsibility. 
I conclude my comments by thanking 
Chair WATERS and her Democratic col-
leagues for their support of this bill 
and her work on this bill and her rec-
ognition of what a tragedy a backdoor 
bailout of Russia by others using cen-
tral bank assets would be. 
We will continue to find a way to de-
prive Russia of cash and financing as it 
continues to wage war in Ukraine. H.R. 
6899 is a strong step in that direction. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, 
we have no further speakers, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time to close. 
As Russia continues to wage war on 
Ukraine, this body, on a bipartisan 
basis, will continue to ensure that we 
are using all the levers to exert and 
utilize maximum pressure, maximum 
lethal assistance pressure to Ukraine, 
maximum diplomatic pressure through 
isolating Russia in international orga-
nizations, 
and 
maximum 
economic 
pressure that we are talking about on 
this floor, of which H.R. 6899 is one cog 
in that wheel. 
Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank 
U.S. Senators RICK
SCOTT
and JOE 
MANCHIN, who have introduced the 
companion legislation to H.R. 6899 in 
the U.S. Senate. 
I look forward to this becoming law 
soon. I urge all my colleagues to sup-
port the Russia and Belarus SDR Ex-
change Prohibition Act, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself the balance of my time. 
In closing, I thank the bill’s author, 
Representative HILL, for giving the 
Members of the House the opportunity 
to act together against Russia and 
Belarus and their war against the free 
world. I urge Members on both sides of 
the aisle to join me in supporting H.R. 
6899. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
TRONE). The question is on the motion 
offered by the gentleman from Illinois

BENJAMIN BERELL FERENCZ CON-
GRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL ACT 
Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, 
I move to suspend the rules and pass 
the bill (H.R. 6015) to award a Congres-
sional Gold Medal to Benjamin Berell 
Ferencz, in recognition of his service to 
the United States and international 
community during the post-World War 
II Nuremberg trials and lifelong advo-
cacy for international criminal justice 
and rule of law, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 6015 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Benjamin 
Berell Ferencz Congressional Gold Medal 
Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Benjamin ‘‘Ben’’ Berell Ferencz was 
born on March 11, 1920, in Transylvania, now 
modern day Hungary. 
(2) In 1920, Ben and his family fled anti-Se-
mitic persecution and emigrated to the 
United States. Ben grew up in New York 
City, and in 1940, was awarded a scholarship 
to Harvard Law School where he graduated 
with honors. 
(3) After the onset of World War II, Ben en-
listed in the United States Army in 1943, and 
joined an anti-aircraft artillery battalion 
preparing for the invasion of France. As an 
enlisted man under General Patton, he 
fought in most of the major campaigns in 
Europe. 
(4) As Nazi atrocities were uncovered, Ben 
was transferred to a newly created War 
Crimes Branch of the Army to gather evi-
dence of war crimes that could be used in a 
court of law to prosecute persons responsible 
for these crimes. Ben documented the hor-
rors perpetrated by Nazi Germany, visiting 
concentration camps as they were liberated. 
(5) At the end of 1945, Ben was honorably 
discharged from the United States Army 
with the rank of Sergeant of Infantry. He 
had been awarded five battle stars. 
(6) In 1946, the United States Government 
recruited Ben to join the team working on 
the Nuremberg tribunals, a novel inde-
pendent court established to try top-ranking 
Nazi officials for crimes perpetrated during 
the course of the war, including those crimes 
we now call the Holocaust. Mr. Ferencz was 
sent to Berlin to oversee a team of 50 re-
searchers investigating official Nazi records, 
which provided overwhelming evidence to 
implicate German doctors, lawyers, judges, 
generals, industrialists, and others in geno-
cide. 
(7) By 1948, at age 27, Ben had secured 
enough evidence to prosecute 22 SS members 
of Nazi killing squads charged for the murder 
of over 1,000,0000 Jewish, Roma, Soviet, and 
other men, women, and children in shooting 
massacres in occupied Soviet territory. He 
was 
appointed 
chief 
prosecutor 
in 
the 
Einsatzgruppen Trial, in what the Associated 
Press called ‘‘the biggest murder trial in his-
tory’’. The court found 20 Nazi officials

guilty of war crimes, crimes against human-
ity, and membership in a criminal organiza-
tion for their roles in the murder of over a 
million people. An additional two defendants 
were found guilty for membership in a crimi-
nal organization. 
(8) After the Nuremberg trials ended, Ben 
fought for compensation for victims and sur-
vivors of the Holocaust, the return of stolen 
assets, and other forms of restitution for 
those who had suffered at the hands of the 
Nazis. 
(9) Since the 1970s, Ben has worked tire-
lessly to promote development of inter-
national mechanisms to outlaw and punish 
aggressive war and the crimes of genocide, 
crimes against humanity and war crimes. 
His efforts contributed to the establishment 
of the International Criminal Court and to 
the recognition of aggression as an inter-
national crime. 
(10) Ben is a tireless advocate for inter-
national criminal justice and the conviction 
that the rule of law offers the world a sus-
tainable path to stem conflict and reach 
peaceful conclusions to geopolitical disputes. 
His unwavering goal has been ‘‘to establish a 
legal precedent that would encourage a more 
humane and secure world in the future’’. 
(11) Ben, at age 101, is still active, giving 
speeches throughout the world about lessons 
learned during his extraordinary career. He 
is compelled by the imperative to ‘‘replace 
the rule of force with the rule of law’’, pro-
moting judicial mechanisms that can resolve 
conflict. He often tells young people to 
‘‘never give up’’ because the fight for peace 
and justice is worth the long struggle ahead.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from Il-
linois (Mr. GARCI´A) and the gentleman 
from Arkansas (Mr. HILL) each will 
control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Illinois. 
Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Today I will share with my col-
leagues the incredible life story and 
mission of Benjamin Ferencz, the chief 
prosecutor at the Einsatzgruppen Trial 
in Nuremberg, Germany, the man who 
brought to justice the individuals re-
sponsible for orchestrating the horrific 
war crimes committed during World 
War II. 
I thank the gentlewoman from Flor-
ida (Ms. FRANKEL) for sponsoring H.R. 
6015, this bill, honoring Mr. Ferencz’s 
life and legacy. Benjamin Ferencz and 
his family immigrated to the United 
States when he was an infant, fleeing 
the persecution of Hungarian Jews in 
Romania. 
He grew up poor in New York, but his 
perseverance, intellect, and yearning 
for justice earned him a scholarship 
from Harvard Law School. He joined 
the Army shortly after graduation and 
was tasked with gathering evidence on 
Nazi war crimes against the Jewish 
people and other marginalized groups, 
a fate that his own family could have 
met had they not fled. 
At the age of 27, he was appointed 
chief prosecutor for the United States 
Army for a case involving war crimes 
and crimes against humanity com-
mitted 
by 
22 
individuals 
from 
Einsatzgruppen, a Nazi secret police 
death squad operating in Nazi-con-
trolled Eastern Europe. He declared in 
his opening statement that the purpose 
of this case was ‘‘to affirm by inter-
national penal action man’s right to 
live in peace and dignity, regardless of 
his race or creed . . . a plea of human-
ity to law.’’ 
The 22 defendants were charged with 
the murder of over one million people, 
including Jews, ethnic minorities, po-
litical dissidents, persons with disabil-
ities, and members of the LGBTQ com-
munity, those who the Third Reich 
deemed to be different and, therefore, 
lesser. Mr. Ferencz secured conviction 
for all 22 defendants. 
He spent the following decade advo-
cating for the institution of an inter-
national criminal court and the inter-
national rule of law to prevent some-
thing like the Nuremberg trials from 
ever being necessary again. As Ferencz 
stated, ‘‘If law is to be respected it 
must apply equally to everyone every-
where. If a permanent international 
criminal court had already existed, 
these ad hoc tribunals would not have 
been necessary.’’ 
Throughout his life, Mr. Ferencz 
sought to make the world a safer, more 
equitable, and more peaceful place 
through his denunciations of war and 
his advocacy for the institution of 
international criminal law. 
For these reasons, I urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 6015, which 
would grant Mr. Ferencz the highest 
congressional honor for his tireless ef-
forts to advance justice. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of H.R. 6015, the Benjamin 
Berell 
Ferencz 
Congressional 
Gold 
Medal Act. I thank Congresswoman 
FRANKEL and the numerous original co-
sponsors for their work on this legisla-
tion. 
Mr. Speaker, Ben Ferencz was the 
last surviving prosecutor in the Nur-
emberg trials. A few minutes ago, we 
were reflecting on how few Army Rang-
ers we have left from World War II. 
Truly, the Greatest Generation is pass-
ing before us. 
Ben Ferencz is one of the few people 
remaining on Earth who had a front 
row seat to witness the horrors brought 
about by Nazi Germany before and dur-
ing the war. As we witness the horrors 
now being carried out in Ukraine, it 
has never been more important for the 
world to hear his story. 
Ben Ferencz’s family fled to New 
York City to escape Romania’s perse-
cution of the Hungarian Jews. As a 
young man, Ferencz studied at the City 
College of New York and attended Har-
vard Law on a scholarship. After grad-
uating from Harvard in 1943, Ferencz 
joined the U.S. Army. Like so many 
Americans, this was a decision that put 
him face to face with the potential of 
death and face to face with the worst 
case of persecution and genocide in his-
tory, the Holocaust. 
After 2 years at Camp Davis in Holly 
Ridge, North Carolina, Ferencz was 
transferred to the headquarters of Gen-
eral Patton’s Third Army. There he 
was assigned to a team tasked with 
setting up a war crimes branch, col-
lecting the evidence of the horrors that 
had been carried out at the recently 
liberated concentration camps. One of 
those liberators in April 1945 was my 
father-in-law, 
Captain 
William 
A. 
McKenzie, a brand-new graduate of 
Texas A&M University, an Army engi-
neer with Patton’s Third Army. One 
spring day in April 1945, their convoy 
rolled up to the gates of Buchenwald 
concentration camp.

There, he bore witness to the Nazi 
terror, a terror that started with an

ideology of hate and superiority based 
on race and creed. 
Bill McKenzie was just a good kid 
from Texas, put in an incredible posi-
tion, and that was being one of the 
first U.S. Army officers to see smoke 
still coming out of the chimneys, bod-
ies stacked up, and survivors. 
In 1994, at the 50th anniversary of 
freedom in Europe and Paris, Bill 
McKenzie, that skinny captain from 
Texas A&M, got to meet a survivor 
from Buchenwald, Jacques Graubart, 
who was from Brussels, who had been 
imprisoned in Buchenwald and sur-
vived, and 50 years later, they met face 
to face in Paris, France. 
Mr. McKenzie swaggered up to this 
man and said, Well, what unit were you 
in in World War II? And Mr. Gruber 
said, I wasn’t in a unit. I was in the Bu-
chenwald concentration camp. 
And Mr. McKenzie was so caught 
with emotion, so embarrassed for his 
question, that he said, I never expected 
to meet a survivor. And Jacques looked 
at Bill McKenzie and said, I never ex-
pected to meet someone who saved us 
to say thank you. 
So today, we are back on this floor to 
thank the work of Ben Ferencz and so 
many Americans and other Allies who 
worked against the ideology of the 
Nazis, such an affront to American val-
ues. And Ben Ferencz was there to put 
those puzzle pieces together that those 
American Army officers found at Bu-
chenwald. 
Ben Ferencz would travel to that 
concentration camp. He would collect 
the evidence of the horrors. He would 
honor us with the work in that war 
crimes branch. And Sergeant Ferencz 
was honorably discharged in 1945 and 
recruited to work on those trials for 
many, many years. For three years he 
led the researchers investigating those 
records, and we know it was no easy 
task. 
As 
the 
lead 
prosecutor 
for 
the 
Einsatzgruppen case, Ben Ferencz suc-
cessfully convicted 22 men for taking 
part in a mobile death squad, which 
was responsible for nearly a third of 
Jewish civilian deaths. His work at the 
Nuremburg trials established an in-
credible 
mandate 
for 
international 
criminal responsibility for the commis-
sion of war crimes and crimes against 
humanity. 
And Ben Ferencz’ work, his sacrifice, 
echoes true for all of us as we see what 
Assad has done in Syria, and we see 
what 
Putin 
is 
doing 
in 
Ukraine. 
Ferencz’ career spanned several dec-
ades and included fighting for proper 
compensation for the victims and the 
survivors of the Holocaust and working 
to establish an International Criminal 
Court. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
come together in support of this bill, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, 
I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks on this legislation and to insert 
extraneous material thereon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Illinois? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Florida (Ms. LOIS FRANKEL), the 
sponsor of the bill. 
Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding and to my colleagues for their 
articulate words today. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise with great pride 
as we move forward with a bipartisan 
bill to award the last living Nuremberg 
prosecutor, a prosecutor against Nazi 
criminals, 
Mr. 
Benjamin 
Ferencz, 
awarding him the Congressional Gold 
Medal, Congress’ highest expression of 
appreciation for distinguished achieve-
ments. 
In this day of partisan conflict, this 
is a rare show of bipartisanship with 
296 cosponsors from both sides of the 
aisle. Mr. Ferencz is 102 years old, and 
to this day, is a tireless advocate for 
the rule of law and international jus-
tice. I have met Mr. Ferencz because I 
am blessed to say he is my constituent 
in Del Ray Beach, Florida, and he re-
mains very alert and very humble. 
My colleagues have said it, and I am 
going to quickly repeat a little of his 
history. 
Mr. Ferencz emigrated to the United 
States with his family—he was only 10 
months old—to escape the persecution 
of Jews in Eastern Europe. He grew up 
in New York City, eventually earning 
degrees from City College and Harvard 
Law School before serving in the Army 
during World War II. 
He enlisted under General Patton be-
fore being transferred to a newly cre-
ated war crimes unit to help collect 
evidence of Nazi war crimes. He would 
enter concentration camps and come 
face to face with the horrors of the 
Nazi regime’s systematic murder of 
millions of Jews. 
He once said: ‘‘Even today, when I 
close my eyes, I witness a deadly vision 
I can never forget—the crematoria 
aglow with the fire of burning flesh, 
the 
mounds 
of 
emaciated 
corpses 
stacked like cordwood waiting to be 
burned. I had peered into hell.’’ 
After the war, he was honorably dis-
charged and awarded five battle stars 
for his service. And that is when he was 
recruited for his most notable role, 
chief prosecutor of the Nuremberg 
trial, that was later called the biggest 
murder trial in history. At age 27, it 
was his first case, and yet, he rose to 
the occasion, reminding the courtroom 
and the world that this was a case that 
dealt with our humanity. 
And in his closing statement, he con-
cluded about the Nazis on trial: ‘‘Death 
was their tool and life their toy.’’ And 
if they were found innocent: ‘‘ . . . then 
law has lost its meaning and man must 
live in fear.’’ Not only did his words 
ring true in the courtroom, where all 22 
Nazis officials he prosecuted were 
brought to justice, they resonated 
around the world and have been quoted 
time and time again when the inter-
national community rallies to decry 
crimes against humanity. 
Nearly 80 days after the conclusion of 
these trials, we meet here during Jew-
ish American History Month, after 
having just celebrated Israel’s Inde-
pendence 
Day 
and 
observing 
Yom 
HaShoah, the day set aside for Jews to 
remember the Holocaust. It is impor-
tant to recognize we are still fighting 
the ongoing battle against racism, 
anti-Semitism, and Holocaust denial in 
this country and around the world, as 
we witness in horror the inhumanity of 
Putin’s war on Ukraine. 
So the timing of this bill has never 
been 
more 
important 
because 
Mr. 
Ferencz inspires us to stand up to the 
cruel barbarians of this world. Mr. 
Ferencz 
said 
it 
best: 
‘‘Nuremberg 
taught me that creating a world of tol-
erance and compassion would be a long 
and arduous task.’’ His lifelong philos-
ophy of ‘‘law not war’’ and ‘‘never give 
up’’ was quoted recently by Ukraine’s 
Ambassador. 
Today, in bipartisan fashion, we are 
going to recognize this magnificent 
man, committed to justice, peace, and 
human dignity with the Congressional 
Gold Medal. 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I am pre-
pared to close, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from North Carolina (Ms. MANNING). 
Ms. MANNING. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my 
good 
friend, 
Congresswoman 
FRANKEL, for her efforts to recognize 
the hard work and dedication of Ben-
jamin Ferencz. It is quite fitting that 
Mr. Ferencz be awarded the Congres-
sional Gold Medal for his remarkable 
work prosecuting Nazis during the 
Nuremburg trials at this particular 
time. 
First, because at a time when immi-
grants 
are 
being 
villainized, 
Mr. 
Ferencz is an example of an immigrant 
who fled to this country from the per-
secution of Jews by the Nazis and made 
this country proud with his military 
service and with his tireless advocacy 
for justice at the Nuremburg trials. 
Second, because at a time of rising 
anti-Semitism globally and in this 
country, it is important to honor Mr. 
Ferencz who fought to hold responsible 
those whose anti-Semitic actions re-
sulted in an unprecedented genocide: 
the murder of 6 million innocent Jews. 
Third, because today we are wit-
nessing 
another 
tyrant, 
Vladimir 
Putin, who reminds us of the brutality, 
the unprovoked aggression, and the un-
bridled cruelty of Adolf Hitler and his 
war machine. 
We can only hope that when Mr. 
Putin’s aggression against Ukraine and 
the Ukrainian people is put to an end, 
we have honorable and highly-skilled 
people like Mr. Ferencz who will hold 
Putin and other war criminals account-
able in a court of law.

May 10, 2022 
Finally, during this Jewish History 
Month, it is a privilege to recognize a 
Jew who served his country and his 
people with distinction, honor, and suc-
cess. Mr. Ferencz was the embodiment 
of the Biblical instruction: Justice, jus-
tice you shall pursue. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, 
Ms. FRANKEL, for her effort to make 
sure this Gold Medal is awarded to 
such a deserving recipient. 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume, and I 
am prepared to close. 
Mr. Speaker, let me thank Ms. 
FRANKEL for her leadership, Congress-
woman MANNING
for her testimony 
there, and we all, on both sides of the 
aisle, stand in recognition of Ben 
Ferencz’ pioneering efforts of his and 
his colleagues in the Nuremberg trials 
for laying out the protection of evi-
dence, the careful documentation of it, 
preserving a way to convict the per-
petrators of the Holocaust. 
Those lessons and Ben Ferencz’ leg-
acy live on today, as just a few months 
ago we received one of our first convic-
tions in a court in Germany of an 
Assad henchman for murder and may-
hem in Syria. There is no doubt in my 
mind that the chain of evidence and 
the actions of this Congress, the ac-
tions of the United Nations, to prompt-
ly set up an evidence protection and 
evidence 
documentation 
effort 
for 
Ukraine will bear fruit in coming days. 
Those are all efforts standing on the 
shoulders of Ben Ferencz and his col-
leagues in Nuremburg. 
I urge all my colleagues to support 
this recognition of his efforts. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues, 
the gentlewoman from Florida, Con-
gresswoman FRANKEL, for her leader-
ship in sponsoring H.R. 6015, and for 
working so hard to ensure that Mr. 
Ferencz receives the recognition that 
he so clearly deserves. 
Through his prosecutorial work, his 
teaching, his written works and his ad-
vocacy, for the establishment of the 
International Criminal Court, he has 
directly and indirectly brought count-
less criminals to justice and left a last-
ing humanitarian legacy. 
The recent reports of Russian atroc-
ities being committed against the peo-
ple of Ukraine are a reminder that war 
crimes are far from being a relic of a 
past. 
Now more than ever, we must act to 
honor and uplift those who have dedi-
cated their lives to advancing justice, 
peace, and giving a voice to the voice-
less. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 6015, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Illinois 
(Mr. 
GARCI´A) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6015, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members

revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on this 
measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-

There was no objection. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield

of the Committee on Homeland Secu-
rity and Governmental Affairs and 
Senator RON JOHNSON of Wisconsin. 
I thank Representatives JOE NEGUSE 
and SCOTT FRANKLIN, who did excellent 
bipartisan work here to lead the House 
companion, H.R. 5962, which was re-
ported by the Oversight and Reform 
Committee on February 4 without op-
position. 
This important bill to defend our Na-
tion’s information and communica-
tions technology supply chains cannot 
be enacted soon enough. 
In December 2020, a Government Ac-
countability 
Office 
report 
revealed 
that Federal agencies had failed to 
fully implement supply chain and risk 
management standards for information 
and communications technology. 
That same month, the discovery of 
the SolarWinds breach made urgently 
clear how dangerous supply chain vul-
nerabilities can be. The networks of at 
least nine Federal agencies were com-
promised by Russian actors, allowing

them access to Federal systems for 
months before they were even discov-
ered. 
To help address these concerns, the 
Supply Chain Security Training Act es-
tablishes a training program for agen-
cy employees with responsibilities re-
lated to supply chain risk manage-
ment, better preparing them to iden-
tify and mitigate supply chain threats 
associated with the acquisition of prod-
ucts and services. 
The training requirements created by 
this bill will ensure that the acquisi-
tion workforce has the capability to 
identify items in the supply chain that 
could be used to exploit Federal infor-
mation systems. 
As the largest purchaser of goods and 
services in the world, the Federal Gov-
ernment relies on a complex supply 
chain that spans continents and is con-
tinuously targeted by foreign adver-
saries and cybercriminals scheming to 
breach Federal information systems. 
To protect our national security in-
terests and guard against these at-
tacks, we must equip our Federal ac-
quisition officials with the expertise 
and skills they need to reinforce our 
cybersecurity defenses through pur-
chasing decisions. 
I encourage my colleagues to support 
this bill, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. MACE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, recent cyberattacks on 
the U.S. Government continue to re-
veal weaknesses in our Federal infor-
mation technology systems. One such 
weakness resides in the software prod-
ucts Federal agencies purchase from 
the private sector. 
IT and software products, like most 
goods and services, now rely on global 
supply chains for their development, 
and this means increased vulnerabili-
ties to threats from malicious and 
criminal actors, as well as our foreign 
enemies, as my colleague, Mr. CON-
NOLLY, just recognized. 
Congress must ensure Federal agen-
cies proactively address supply chain 
security risks. The Supply Chain Secu-
rity Training Act will ensure the Fed-
eral workforce properly understands 
these supply chain risks and the appro-
priate policies to implement to address 
the risks. 
Specifically, the bill tasks the Gen-
eral Services Administration with de-
veloping, and the Office of Manage-
ment and Budget, OMB, with imple-
menting 
a 
governmentwide 
supply 
chain security training program. This 
training will prepare the Federal work-
force to better identify and mitigate 
the security risks throughout the ac-
quisition lifecycle of information and 
communications technology products 
and services. For instance, Federal 
agency personnel would be better able 
to recognize and avoid purchasing soft-
ware products with malware vulnera-
bilities. 
This is smart legislation that builds 
on existing congressional reforms. For 
instance, the bill requires coordination 
with the existing Federal Acquisition 
Security Council, an interagency effort 
established by Congress in 2018 to de-
velop policies and procedures address-
ing supply chain risks. 
Despite these existing efforts, there 
are currently no Federal workforce 
training requirements in place to en-
sure supply chain security policies are 
properly 
and 
consistently 
imple-
mented. The national security stakes 
are too high to leave such a strategic 
gap in our Federal defenses. 
S. 2201 represents a practical policy 
reform to a very real threat. I appre-
ciate my colleagues Representatives 
NEGUSE and FRANKLIN’s leadership on 
championing the House companion bill, 
H.R. 5962. 
I look forward to seeing the Supply 
Chain Security Training Act pass the 
House and advance to the President’s 
desk. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no further speakers on this side. I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. MACE. Mr. Speaker, I also want 
to again recognize my colleagues, Rep-
resentatives NEGUSE
and FRANKLIN, 
who crafted the House companion leg-
islation, H.R. 5962. 
I encourage my colleagues to support 
this bill, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my friend from South Carolina 
for her leadership and support on this 
important piece of legislation, which 
will help guard Federal assets. 
I urge passage of the bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CON-
NOLLY) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, S. 2201. 
The question was taken; and (two-

rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4761 
May 10, 2022 
with the companion legislation intro-
duced by Representatives RO KHANNA 
and NANCY MACE. 
The Federal Rotational Cyber Work-
force Program Act enables cybersecu-
rity professionals in the Federal Gov-
ernment to rotate through assignments 
outside of their regular position or 
agency on a voluntary basis. 
The Office of Personnel Management 
would establish guidelines for the im-
plementation of the program. The pro-
gram would be authorized for 5 years, 
and after 3 years, the Government Ac-
countability Office would assess its op-
eration and effectiveness. 
Achieving cybersecurity in response 
to the threats the Nation faces was 
identified in GAO’s latest ‘‘High Risk 
List’’ as an area where the government 
is actually regressing. GAO reported 
that Federal agencies are struggling to 
ensure that staff have the skills re-
quired to address the critical cyberse-
curity risks that continue to intensify. 
The program this bill creates allows 
the government to have its security 
employees to further develop their 
skills and agencies across the govern-
ment to benefit from the employees’ 
expertise. 
Recent cyberattacks in both the pri-
vate and public sectors have dem-
onstrated the dire consequences of fail-
ing to improve the Federal Govern-
ment’s cybersecurity operations. 
We know that adversaries in Russia, 
China, and other malign actors, state 
and nonstate, are consistently working 
to breach the U.S. Government’s com-
munications and data. Unfortunately, 
at times, they have been all too suc-
cessful. In the 2020 SolarWinds breach, 
for example, Russian hackers infil-
trated the networks of nine Federal 
agencies 
and 
went 
undetected 
for 
months. 
This bill goes a long way toward im-
proving Federal agencies’ capacity to 
strengthen cybersecurity operations, 
help them retain top talent in that 
field, and facilitate the exchange of ex-
pertise in this critical area. 
The security of Federal information 
technology systems and data is a na-
tional security priority, and it ought 
to be. It is essential to preserving pub-
lic trust in government institutions 
and ensuring that agencies are better 
equipped to meet their missions in 
serving the American people. 
I strongly support the bill, and I urge 
my colleagues to do the same. I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. MACE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the U.S. Government is 
under constant attack. We watch news 
story after news story of private com-
panies 
being 
attacked 
by 
hackers 
across the country and, quite frankly, 
across the world. But our Federal agen-
cies are also vulnerable. 
Malicious hackers try to steal sen-
sitive public information and disrupt 
the missions of our Federal agencies. 
In fact, in 2020, there were 11 Federal 
agencies that were hacked by actors 
aligned with countries like China and— 
you guessed it—Russia. And all too 
often, these malicious actors are suc-
cessful. 
My 
colleague, 
Representative 
RO 
KHANNA, and I recognized this reality 
and crafted the House companion bill 
legislation to the Senate bill we are 
considering today. That companion bill 
is H.R. 3599. 
The Federal Rotational Cyber Work-
force 
Program 
Act 
continues 
the 
Trump administration’s efforts as laid 
out in the ‘‘America’s Cybersecurity 
Workforce’’ executive order. This exec-
utive order promoted cyber rotational 
details at the Department of Homeland 
Security. Such programs help Federal 
cyber experts gain more diverse profes-
sional experiences and continue to 
sharpen their skills. 
Our Nation’s cyber readiness depends 
on maintaining a skilled Federal work-
force to defend against constant at-
tacks. Specifically, this bill establishes 
an additional governmentwide rota-
tional opportunity for cyber-focused 
professionals. 
The bill has necessary congressional 
oversight mechanisms, such as a re-
quirement for a detailed operational 
plan and a future Government Ac-
countability Office review. This will 
help Congress understand if the pro-
gram is running as intended. Addition-
ally, a 5-year sunset will provide Con-
gress an opportunity to evaluate the 
program and decide whether to renew 
it for future years. 
I thank my House and Senate col-
leagues for their work on this bipar-
tisan bill, which builds upon the cyber 
workforce efforts of the prior adminis-
tration, and I encourage my colleagues 
to support S. 1097 and send this nec-
essary bill to the President’s desk. 
To any teenager who loves to code 
out there today, I encourage all of you 
to look at cybersecurity jobs and op-
portunities in your near future because 
we will need you in our workforce. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I in-
form the House I have no further 
speakers, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. MACE. Mr. Speaker, now more 
than ever, the cyber workforce of our 
Federal agencies needs to be well 
equipped 
to 
address 
the 
constant 
threats we face. 
By expanding cyber rotation pro-
grams under this bill, we will help Fed-
eral agencies gain valuable experience 
and share best practices across the gov-
ernment. 
I encourage my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle to support this bill, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I con-
gratulate my colleague from South 
Carolina for her leadership on a very 
important matter, and I urge passage 
of this important piece of legislation. 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CON-
NOLLY) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, S. 1097. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
TARGETING RESOURCES TO COM-
MUNITIES IN NEED ACT OF 2022 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 6531) to provide an increased allo-
cation of funding under certain pro-
grams for assistance in areas of per-
sistent poverty, and for other purposes, 
as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on this 
measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Virginia? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support H.R. 6531, the Targeting Re-
sources to Communities in Need Act. 
This bill is bipartisan, and it was intro-
duced by the distinguished majority 
whip, Representative JIM CLYBURN of 
South Carolina, and Mr. HAL ROGERS of 
Kentucky. 
b 1745 
This bill is timely and would make a 
difference in the lives of the people 
across the Nation facing the difficul-
ties of living in persistent poverty. 
According to the Census Bureau, in 
2020 the official rate of poverty in the 
United States was 11.4 percent. That 
statistic illustrates the hardships faced 
by over 37.2 million people. As we 
know, poverty can be experienced by 
Americans of all backgrounds in rural, 
urban, and suburban communities. 
The aims of this important bill are 
straightforward. The bill would provide 
additional 
transparency 
about 
the 
areas of the country facing persistent 
poverty and would target more Federal 
resources for program assistance to 
those areas. 
Specifically, H.R. 6531 would require 
the Census Bureau to publish a list of 
all areas of persistent poverty, and the 
Office of Management and Budget 
would work with agencies to direct ad-
ditional funds to the places where peo-
ple need them most. 
Reports to Congress would be sub-
mitted annually—noting the programs 
included in the bill’s efforts, along with 
assessments of the economic impacts 
of the additional investments, to the 
extent possible. 
This bill also calls for GAO to evalu-
ate the effectiveness of the invest-
ments over time. Those areas of the 
country facing exceptional hardship re-
quire our exceptional attention and 
support. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bipartisan legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. MACE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6531 directs the Of-
fice of Management and Budget to lead 
a government-wide effort to review the 
share of Federal funds addressing pov-
erty in a consistent manner across 
agency assistance programs. 
Specifically, this legislation will en-
sure that a more up-to-date and con-
sistent listing of the areas of persistent 
poverty in our Nation will be used by 
agencies to determine funding alloca-
tions. This will help struggling rural 
Americans getting greater access to 
the many taxpayer-funded poverty as-
sistance programs. 
The Federal Government currently 
spends an enormous amount of tax-
payer funds on low-income populations. 
However, it is important that funding 
be targeted especially to our most vul-
nerable 
counties 
experiencing 
pro-
longed struggles with poverty. 
This bill creates a consistent ap-
proach across competitively awarded 
Federal grant and financial assistance 
programs. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues, 
Congressman CLYBURN and Congress-
man HAL ROGERS, for their bipartisan 
efforts on this legislation, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
4 minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman from South Carolina (Mr. CLY-
BURN), the majority whip. 
Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of H.R. 6531, the Targeting Re-
sources to Communities in Need Act, a 
bipartisan bill that I introduced with 
HAL ROGERS of Kentucky and Senators 
CORY BOOKER and ROB PORTMAN, to en-
sure that communities that have been 
determined to be suffering from per-
sistent poverty received a more equi-
table share of Federal investments. 
According to the Census Bureau 
there are nearly 500 persistent poverty 
counties in our great country. They are 
defined as counties that have had a 
poverty rate of 20 percent or more for 
the last 30 years. 
These counties are as diverse as the 
country, including White communities 
in Appalachia, African-American com-
munities in the South, Latino commu-
nities in the Southwest, and Native 
American communities throughout the 
West. 
In 2009, I included a provision in the 
American Recovery and Reinvestment 
Act requiring that at least 10 percent 
of the funds in three rural development 
accounts be spent in these counties. 
This became known as the 10–20–30 
funding formula. 
The formula worked effectively, effi-
ciently, and equitably; funding infra-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4763 
May 10, 2022 
Over the past 12 years, Democrats 
and Republicans have worked together 
to expand this approach to nearly 20 
appropriations accounts. Much of this 
progress was made when Mr. ROGERS 
was chair of the Appropriations Com-
mittee, and I thank him for his leader-
ship. 
This legislation would expand this 
10–20–30 targeted formula throughout 
the Federal Government; recognizing 
that the best way to target funding in 
these areas may differ from program to 
program. 
Our bill gives discretion to Federal 
agencies led by OMB to tailor the pol-
icy to the needs of each program while 
requiring them to report to Congress 
on the progress being made to create 
and expand opportunities in these com-
munities. 
This bill does not increase Federal 
spending one iota. It simply targets 
Federal resources to communities that 
are most in need. 
In closing, I thank my friend HAL 
ROGERS for his collaboration, and I ask 
our colleagues for their support of this 
effort to make America’s greatness 
more accessible and affordable to all 
communities. 
Ms. MACE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentleman from Ken-
tucky (Mr. ROGERS). 
Mr. 
ROGERS 
of 
Kentucky. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in strong support of 
H.R. 6531, the Targeting Resources to 
Communities in Need Act. 
The impetus for this legislation was 
the understanding that in certain parts 
of the country there are pockets of sys-
temic poverty caused by a variety of 
factors that can be very difficult to 
boost economically. 
Ranging from rural towns to popu-
lated urban areas, these areas of per-
sistent poverty deserve a keen eye 
from our Federal Government and a 
plan to help them reinvigorate. 
I have been proud to work with Ma-
jority Whip JIM CLYBURN on this for 
many years now with some modest suc-
cess, but hopefully a great future 
today. I have been happy to work with 
Mr. CLYBURN on legislative efforts to 
alleviate persistent poverty and set up 
these communities for economic suc-
cess and self-sufficiency. 
This bill directs the Office of Man-
agement and Budget, in consultation 
with Federal agencies, to develop and 
implement guidance and measures to 
increase the share of Federal invest-
ments targeted to areas of persistent 
poverty. 
The bill will require the OMB direc-
tor to submit to Congress each fiscal 
year a report including the list of pro-
grams, by agency, under which the 
amount of Federal funds targeted to 
persistent poverty areas were increased 
in the previous fiscal year. 
By targeting Federal resources to 
these communities, we will spur eco-
nomic development in the areas of the 
country 
that 
need 
it 
most 
and 
strengthen the American economy as a 
whole. 
The bill further requires the U.S. 
Government Accountability Office to 
report on the effectiveness of the meas-
ures implemented, which will respon-
sibly ensure that this legislation is 
making a meaningful impact. 
We have made great strides to lift up 
impoverished areas, like Kentucky’s 
Appalachian region, but we have more 
work to do in my district and similar 
parts of the country that need our at-
tention. This targeted bill will help 
communities break through the cycle 
of poverty and provide resources nec-
essary to thrive. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Whip CLYBURN 
for his partnership and his great work 
on this over the years and his commit-
ment, and I urge support for the bill. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank 
the distinguished gentleman 
from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY), and the 
manager for the minority. 
Mr. Speaker, let me rise with enthu-
siasm for this legislation for it has 
been a long-time investment of Whip 
CLYBURN. 
The Targeting Resources to Commu-
nities in Need Act of 2022 tracks work 
that I have done as it relates to equity 
in various entities, but in particular in 
African Americans. 
This work of Mr. CLYBURN, 10–20–30, 
has the ability to reach poor commu-
nities that have not been necessarily 
receiving the benefits equitably of Fed-
eral resources. This can be a great 
boost to our rural communities. It can 
be a source of change. 
For example, in Texas, during the 
pandemic, we lost a large number of 
rural hospitals, and in those commu-
nities people were deprived of access to 
good healthcare. The hospitals just 
closed because they did not have the 
resources. 
This, as well, deals with education, 
flood mitigation, infrastructure, all of 
these issues come out of appropria-
tions. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. ROGERS 
who I know has been working with 
Whip CLYBURN for a long time on this 
equitable approach to the distribution 
of our funds. 
I think it is important for the Amer-
ican people to know that Members of 
Congress are concerned that Federal 
funds get to the people, and they get to 
the people that are most in need—they 
are life-changing efforts. 
For example, as we worked on the 
community projects, many Members 
have found that when they give those 
pointed dollars, you can change lives of 
communities, schools, neighborhoods, 
and families. This particular legisla-
tion, the Targeting Resources to Com-
munities in Need Act, is an appropriate 
approach to ensuring that tax dollars 
get to where they are needed and help 
those in need. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
support H.R. 6531 and congratulate Mr. 
CLYBURN for his work. 
Ms. MACE. Mr. Speaker, I support 
H.R. 6531, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, let me 
just say, this is how it is supposed to 
work—watching the collaboration be-
tween our dear friend from South Caro-
lina (Mr. CLYBURN) and the dean of the 
House (Mr. ROGERS) on addressing en-
demic poverty in the United States is 
how this House works best. I congratu-
late both of them for showing us the 
way. I hope we emulate it on more 
than this occasion. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this important piece of legisla-
tion. Let’s help our fellow Americans 
when we can, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CON-
NOLLY) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6531, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, on that I de-
mand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I ask

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-

Rights for the TSA Workforce Act 
under a structured rule. It provides 1 
hour of debate equally divided and con-
trolled by the chair and ranking minor-
ity member of the Committee on 
Homeland Security. It self-executes a 
manager’s amendment from Chairman 
THOMPSON, 
makes 
in 
order 
eight 
amendments, and provides for one mo-
tion to recommit. 
The rule also provides for consider-
ation of H.R. 2499 and H.R. 5129 under 
structured rules. It provides 1 hour of 
debate for each equally divided and 
controlled by the chair and ranking 
minority member of the Committee on 
Education and Labor. It self-executes 
manager amendments from Chairman 
SCOTT to both bills. It makes in order 
8 amendments and 17 amendments re-
spectively, and it provides for one mo-
tion to recommit for both bills. 
The rule provides en bloc authority 
to Chairmen THOMPSON and SCOTT. 
b 1815 
Further, the rule provides for consid-
eration of H.R. 7691, the Additional 
Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations 
Act, under a closed rule. The rule pro-
vides 1 hour of debate equally divided 
and controlled by the chair and rank-
ing minority member of the Committee 
on Appropriations. The rule self-exe-
cutes a manager’s amendment from 
Chairwoman DELAURO and provides one 
motion to recommit. 
The rule also deems passage of H. 
Res. 1096, a resolution, Recognizing 
Congressional Workers’ Right to Orga-
nize. 
The rule also provides recess instruc-
tions, suspension authority, and same- 
day authority through June 10. 
Finally, the rule postpones requested 
roll call votes on suspension bills con-
sidered on May 10 and May 11 through 
May 18. 
Madam Speaker, the rule contains 
five essential points of action. 
H.R. 903, the Rights for the TSA 
Workforce Act of 2021: This legislation 
seeks to afford TSA employees similar 
rights, protections, and benefits af-
forded to most other Federal workers 
across the country in order to improve 
the agency’s operations, workforce re-
tention, and morale. 
H.R. 2499 is the bipartisan Federal 
Firefighters Fairness Act of 2022. This 
legislation establishes a science-based 
list of diseases for which an automatic 
presumption of work-related illness 
would apply for Federal firefighters 
who get sick, provided that they are 
employed in fire protection activities 
for at least 5 years. It also establishes 
a process for adding other diseases 
based on scientific data and analysis 
going forward. 
H.R. 5129 is the bipartisan Commu-
nity Services Block Grant Moderniza-
tion Act of 2022. It reauthorizes and im-
proves the popular and effective com-
munity services block grant program 
to help reach even more Americans, 
provide more community development 
across the country, and further reduce 
poverty. 
The rule also contains a resolution 
recognizing the right of congressional 
staff to unionize. 
Finally, it includes H.R. 7691, the Ad-
ditional Ukraine Supplemental Appro-
priations Act, 2022. Madam Speaker, 
generations to come will look back at 
this moment to ask: What did our gen-
eration do when Vladimir Putin and 
his army invaded the sovereign nation 
of Ukraine and tried not only to crush 
its democracy and violate the spirit of 
its people but vaporize and annex the 
entire nation? 
Well, today, let future generations 
observe the Biden administration and a 
bipartisan Congress has not only al-
ready provided more than $4 billion in 
security assistance to Ukraine, almost 
all of it coming after the February 24 
invasion, but today, we are voting to 
provide nearly $40 billion to address 
the immediate and near-term security, 
economic, and humanitarian needs of 
the Ukrainian people that are urgent 
and desperate. 
We will provide $6 billion for train-
ing, equipment, weapons, logistics sup-
port, supplies, salaries and stipends, 
and intelligence support; $4.35 billion 
in emergency food assistance, medical 
equipment, and other humanitarian 
aid; and billions more for humanitarian 
relief for the millions of refugees dis-
placed by Putin’s violence and bom-
bardment of communities in Ukraine. 
The aid that we vote on today will 
come with the fervent solidarity, admi-
ration, and love of the American peo-
ple. We are in awe of President 
Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian people, and 
their army. They have been hanging 
tough against terrible odds and terrible 
violence in a splendid display of demo-
cratic patriotism for their country. 
Their resolve is heroic, and it is 
breathtaking to behold. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the Representative, Mr. RASKIN, 
for yielding me the customary 30 min-
utes, and I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Today, we are here to discuss a rule 
providing for consideration of H.R. 903, 
the Rights for the TSA Workforce Act; 
H.R. 5129, the Community Services 
Block Grant Modernization Act of 2022; 
and H.R. 2499, the Federal Firefighters 
Fairness Act, which would provide 
needed benefits to firefighters and 
other Federal workers suffering from 
occupation-related diseases and sim-
plifies the process of providing care 
and benefits for these workers to en-
sure they will not be caught up in bu-
reaucratic red tape. Finally, the rule 
provides for consideration of a supple-
mental appropriation to Ukraine to en-
sure that they have the necessary 
funds to counter Russian aggression. 
The community services block grant, 
or CSBG, aims to reduce poverty by 
improving economic security for low- 
income individuals and creating eco-
nomic opportunities in their commu-
nities. This program has not been up-
dated since 1998 and is in dire need of 
reform, but H.R. 5129 fails to accom-
plish that goal. 
It continues to let States set the 
benchmarks for progress and allows in-
effective programs to continue receiv-
ing taxpayer dollars. 
It increases the income thresholds to 
200 percent above the Federal poverty 
line, stretching Federal resources thin-
ner and effectively robbing those most 
in need of help. 
It allows grantees to use their facili-
ties for voter registration, completely 
distracting from the program’s goal to 
fight poverty and risking the introduc-
tion of partisan activity into non-
partisan efforts. 
Worst of all, this bill cuts existing 
protections for faith-based charities. 
Without these protections, organiza-
tions that have fought poverty for 
years could be forced to remove their 
faithful beliefs from their work if they

May 10, 2022 
want to continue providing important 
poverty relief. Why would we want to 
limit the number of organizations par-
ticipating in this cause? 
H.R. 903, the Rights for the TSA 
Workforce Act, has so many flaws, I 
don’t have time to mention them all. 
This bill goes against Congress’ intent 
when it enacted the Aviation and 
Transportation Security Act to create 
the Transportation Security Adminis-
tration, or the TSA, in November 2001 
following the 9/11 terror attacks. 
At the time, Congress recognized the 
importance of providing unique au-
thorities to ensure that TSA could 
carry out its national security mission. 
Converting all 60,000 TSA employees 
into title 5 would limit that flexibility. 
Under ATSA, the agency may exer-
cise one-step removal for serious of-
fenses such as intentional security 
breaches, theft, failure of drug and al-
cohol tests while on duty, or arrests for 
certain criminal offenses. Under H.R. 
903, an employee who knowingly allows 
guns or explosives through a security 
checkpoint may no longer be imme-
diately fired. 
Furthermore, under this bill, matters 
of national security could be nego-
tiable under collective bargaining ne-
gotiations. The flexibility that Con-
gress intended for TSA would allow for 
the imposition of, for example, en-
hanced screening procedures based on 
credible threats. Under this bill, the 
implementation of new security re-
quirements could be subject to negotia-
tion with the union. 
If the national security implications 
are not enough, how about the fact 
that TSA employees could actually 
lose benefits under this bill? If H.R. 903 
becomes law, employees could lose the 
ability to trade shifts with one an-
other, donate leave to their colleagues, 
and receive certain incentive pay. 
Some overtime pay would be prohib-
ited, and current career milestone bo-
nuses could no longer be offered. 
Finally, this bill forces employees to 
unionize under AFGE specifically so 
employees wouldn’t even get to choose 
their labor representation. This bill 
does not allow for an intervening union 
election and would require the DHS 
Secretary to consult with AFGE on 
leave benefits, additional pay, and in-
centives and bonuses for all TSA em-
ployees, now a 60,000-person workforce. 
Everyone here, I am sure, is thankful 
for TSA and wants their employees to 
be satisfied with their working condi-
tions. But that is a question of Con-
gress prioritizing for that purpose, not 
an inflexible, forced unionization to ap-
pease the majority’s base. 
I urge my colleagues to heed the rec-
ommendations of the Blue Ribbon 
Panel, a bipartisan group of former of-
ficials 
that 
strongly 
recommended 
against moving TSA personnel under 
title 5. 
Madam Speaker, I oppose the rule 
and ask Members to do the same. I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the distinguished gentle-
woman 
from 
Virginia 
(Ms. 
SPANBERGER). 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in support of this impor-
tant legislation of which I am a co-
sponsor and intend to vote for. 
Firefighters are routinely exposed to 
high stress, smoke, heat, and various 
toxic substances. As a result, they are 
far more likely to contract cardio-
vascular disease, lung disease, and can-
cer than other workers. 
I strongly support extending work-
ers’ compensation to America’s Federal 
civilian firefighters as we will do with 
the Federal Firefighter Fairness Act, 
but I want to use this opportunity to 
call on House leadership and the Vet-
erans’ Affairs Committee to bring for-
ward another related bill, the Michael 
Lecik Military Firefighters Protection 
Act. 
I strongly support extending work-
ers’ compensation to our civilian fire-
fighters, but we must extend the same 
benefits to our military firefighters. 
Not doing so would be nothing short of 
a dereliction of our sacred duty to 
them. 
One such military firefighter was Mi-
chael Lecik, an Air Force firefighter. 
He deployed twice to the Middle East, 
and after coming home to central Vir-
ginia some years later, Mike was diag-
nosed with multiple myeloma, a blood 
cancer linked to the dangerous condi-
tions of his service as a military fire-
fighter, a connection we are acknowl-
edging for Federal firefighters with our 
votes for the Federal Firefighters Fair-
ness Act. 
While I am grateful that we are mov-
ing this bill forward, I am deeply con-
cerned and disappointed that we are 
not remedying this issue for the brave 
servicemembers like Mike who had 
similar exposures. 
Mike died in March 2021 at the age of 
41, leaving behind a loving wife and 
three school-age daughters. As he faced 
down his illness, he worked and advo-
cated to ensure that other military 
firefighters would have their service- 
connected illnesses recognized. 
In his honor and in service to mili-
tary firefighters like him, I will con-
tinue to work to ensure an acknowl-
edgment of harm is extended to all af-
fected populations, including veterans 
dying from cancer without any ac-
knowledgment of their service-con-
nected injury. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 4 minutes to the Representative 
from Texas (Mr. BURGESS). 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman from Min-
nesota for yielding. 
This Ukraine supplemental in this 
rule authorizes an additional $40 billion 
to provide defense articles and serv-
ices, humanitarian aid, and financial 
support. 
I do believe it is important that 
Western countries continue to support 
Ukraine in its fight against its bar-
baric aggressors, but honestly, do we 
not deserve a plan? Does the adminis-
tration not need to come to us with 
where we are going with this? 
This is an additional $40 billion on 
top of the several billion dollars that 
have already been spent. It is not that 
I object to the money. I object to not 
understanding how the administration 
is proceeding with this. 
Look, it was just 10 months ago that 
we were all on a conference call with 
the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary 
of State, and the Secretary of Home-
land Security. They assured us that 
the government in Afghanistan was 
solid, and they were going to be okay. 
At the same time, we are all getting 
alerts on our phones that the govern-
ment in Afghanistan is headed for the 
exits with all of our money. 
Then it was October of this year with 
the clear signs that Vladimir Putin 
was amassing on the borders around 
Ukraine, and there was no solid discus-
sion about whether or not this was im-
portant for the United States and 
whether or not we should do anything 
to counteract that. 
b 1830 
Indeed, there were approvals for some 
transfer of weaponry, but it was slow 
to get there. Then the President made 
the unfortunate statement that a small 
incursion would perhaps be okay. The 
same Secretary of Defense and the 
same Secretary of State told us that 
this all would likely be over in 3 days’ 
time, but they didn’t take into account 
the nationality, the spirit of President 
Zelenskyy and his countrymen, who 
said: No, this is not going to happen in 
our country. 
Look, none of us can predict the fu-
ture, but truly the Biden administra-
tion really does need to justify the use 
of American resources as this conflict 
unfolds. 
Is there a plan for when this supple-
mental funding runs out? 
Will the United States defense pro-
duction keep up with Ukrainian de-
mand? 
Who is keeping count on the number 
of Stingers and Javelin missiles that 
are leaving our stockpiles that should 
be defending our homeland? Are we de-
pleting those so severely that we 
wouldn’t be able to respond should we 
need to? 
Are we providing resources that will 
give Ukraine an asymmetric advantage 
to eventually win this war? If we are 
not doing that, how long are we going 
to ask the American people to continue 
to fund the status quo? 
Look, 
Russia 
advancing 
beyond 
Ukraine’s borders into NATO territory 
would almost certainly also draw the 
United States into a war in Europe. 
But let me stress: That is a war in Eu-
rope. Where is the rest of Europe in 
this? We all want to prevent that out-
come. We cannot let Vladimir Putin 
create this new world order in which he 
is the new tyrant of the world. To de-
feat him, we have to be united in our 
goals, united in the expenditure of 
American resources in support of those

goals, and we have to have a plan that 
we are confident is being followed. 
It is not lost on me that this amount 
of money that we are asking to appro-
priate in an emergency fashion today is 
exactly one-half of the dollar amount 
of the weaponry that was abandoned in 
Afghanistan, abandoned to our en-
emies. Let’s not find ourselves in that 
situation again. 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, the gentleman asks 
us to justify the use of American re-
sources in supporting our democratic 
allies in Ukraine. 
How would we justify the use of these 
resources? 
Well, let’s start with this. The 
Ukrainian 
people 
and 
President 
Zelenskyy have asked for our help. 
They have asked for these resources, 
and they need these resources in order 
to beat back a brutal, bloody, and ille-
gal innovation by Vladimir Putin, who 
is violating the laws of war on a daily 
basis. 
They have killed thousands of civil-
ians, they have killed more than 150 
children, murdering them, and his 
Army is raping and killing women, 
leaving their corpses in the street. 
So we have a democracy trying to de-
fend its sovereign borders against an 
autocrat who wants to rebuild the Rus-
sian 
empire, 
Vladimir 
Putin, 
the 
former chief of the KGB, who said that 
the greatest catastrophe of the 20th 
century was the collapse of the Soviet 
Union. 
We were hoping that we would have a 
unanimous, bipartisan statement today 
in favor of aid to the besieged people of 
Ukraine. Instead, we get more voices of 
defeatism, pessimism, and gloom. 
We have heard it before. We heard 
Representative CAWTHORN
who said: 
Remember that Zelenskyy is a thug, 
remember that the Ukrainian Govern-
ment is incredibly corrupt, and is in-
credibly evil and has been pushing 
woke ideologies. 
We heard from Steve Bannon who 
said: No Republican should vote for 
any money for Ukraine, zero dollars for 
Ukraine. 
We are hearing it from other can-
didates 
around 
the 
country, 
J.D. 
Vance, who says: I have got to be hon-
est with you; I don’t really care what 
happens to Ukraine one way or the 
other. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
the 
democratic 
world is under siege by Vladimir Putin 
and his filthy army, which is mur-
dering children, raping women, killing 
civilians. Which side are we on? 
The Biden administration is rallying 
the democratic world, rallying the 
NATO countries. We should be standing 
on a unanimous, bipartisan basis with 
the people of Ukraine. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. 
LEVIN). 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in support of this rule, 
which includes the resolution I intro-
duced to provide House staff legal pro-
tection to organize and bargain collec-
tively. 
First, a big thank you to Speaker 
PELOSI, Majority Leader HOYER, Whip 
CLYBURN, and committee chairs LOF-
GREN and SCOTT for working with me to 
get this legislation across the finish 
line and a big thank you to the major-
ity of Democrats for cosponsoring this 
resolution. 
It feels surreal, and also completely 
right, to be here at this critical mo-
ment. I have spent much of my career 
helping workers form unions and bar-
gain collectively. The power of workers 
to unite and demand fair wages, better 
benefits, and safer working conditions 
was central to the creation of the 
American middle class, and it is essen-
tial right now for working families 
simply trying to get by. 
That is why I was humbled when con-
gressional staffers approached me ear-
lier this year and asked me to intro-
duce a resolution that would grant 
them a fundamental human right, the 
right to organize and bargain collec-
tively without fear of retaliation. 
For months now, our workers have 
been organizing in the shadows, be-
cause they lack the legal protections 
to come forward. It should not and does 
not have to be this way for workers 
seeking to exercise their First Amend-
ment right to freedom of association, 
especially here in the Halls of Con-
gress. 
I fervently believe that all workers 
deserve the chance to have a union and 
to be protected in pursuing one. This 
resolution approves regulations origi-
nally proposed in 1996, 26 years ago. 
Those regulations provide guidance for 
how legislative branch employees can 
exercise their statutory right to form 
or join labor organizations, as Congress 
expressly intended. 
I can say without a doubt that here 
in the people’s House, we could not 
serve our districts without the hard 
work and dedication of congressional 
staff. They manage our schedules, ad-
vise on policy, engage with constitu-
ents, and do so much more essential 
work with humility, with grit, and 
often with little to no recognition. 
These same workers have endured 
trauma while providing public service, 
working through a global pandemic 
that has killed a million people in this 
country, and experiencing an assault 
on our very workplace on January 6, 
2021. 
The very least we can do is honor and 
respect their effort to organize in Con-
gress, giving them the long-overdue 
right to find their collective voice. 
This resolution will protect bargaining 
over working conditions, wages, just- 
cause provisions, and more. We have 
heard loudly and clearly over the past 
few 
months: 
Congressional 
staffers 
want a union. Let’s not make them 
wait a second longer. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ 
on the rule. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Georgia (Mrs. GREENE). 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in opposition to the 
Ukrainian supplemental bill. 
Madam Speaker, $40 billion, but 
there is no baby formula for American 
mothers and babies. 
An unknown amount of money to the 
CIA in the Ukraine supplemental bill, 
but there is no formula for American 
babies and mothers. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
$54 
million 
in 
COVID spending in Ukraine, but there 
is no formula for American babies and 
mothers. 
Madam Speaker, $900 million for non-
profits and organizations in Ukraine, 
but there is no formula for American 
babies and mothers. 
Madam Speaker, $8.7 billion for eco-
nomic support and funding in Ukraine, 
but there is no formula for American 
mothers and babies. 
If this is about claiming that it is 
about saving lives, let’s be real, then 
we would care about war-torn coun-
tries like Ethiopia. So that is a bunch 
of hypocrisy, because I never hear 
Ethiopia brought up here. Totally ig-
noring our own border crisis, our own 
baby formula crisis, and brutal infla-
tion, skyrocketing gas prices that no 
one can afford, but $40 billion for 
Ukraine? 
Stop funding regime change and 
money laundering scams and U.S. poli-
tician coverups of their crimes in coun-
tries like Ukraine. The American peo-
ple do not support paying for constant 
U.S. involvement in foreign affairs 
while our own government fails our 
own country. 
Let me remind everyone here: We 
swore an oath to uphold and defend the 
Constitution of the United States of 
America and our borders. We should be 
paying attention to our country right 
now. 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, here 
is a formula for the destruction of de-
mocracy: 
Repeating 
Putin’s 
propa-
ganda and disinformation and appeas-
ing imperialist assaults on sovereign 
nations. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Washington 
(Ms. JAYAPAL). 
Ms. 
JAYAPAL. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
workers’ rights are human rights. The 
labor movement has shown us what is 
possible when we dream big and fight 
hard. Tonight, we will clear yet an-
other hurdle in the battle for work-
place safety and dignity. 
I thank my colleague, Representative 
LEVIN, for his tremendous leadership 
on this resolution. With House Resolu-
tion 915, congressional staff will be able 
to organize and bargain for a better 
workplace without fear of intimidation 
or retaliation. 
As someone who organized 
with 
unions, working people, and for collec-
tive bargaining rights before coming to 
Congress, I know how important it is 
that we guarantee our staff that same

right. As a co-lead of the PRO Act, I 
have continuously pushed for pro- 
worker policies that prioritize safety, 
equity, and better pay. Like other 
workers, congressional staff deserve to 
be protected at work. They put in long, 
hard hours. They work incredibly hard 
to serve the people. 
We must lead by example and show 
our gratitude by ensuring our staff 
have the right to bargain, to organize, 
and to unionize. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
If we defeat the previous question, I 
will offer an amendment to the rule to 
immediately consider a bill that would 
block the Biden administration’s effort 
to establish a so-called Disinformation 
Governance Board. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to insert the text of my 
amendment in the RECORD along with 
any extraneous material immediately 
prior to the vote on the previous ques-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
JACKSON LEE). Is there objection to the 
request of the gentlewoman from Min-
nesota? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, 
policing of the First Amendment pro-
tected speech has no place in this coun-
try. Yet, the Biden administration, 
unsatisfied with their big tech and 
their mainstream media allies’ efforts 
to control criticism of their disastrous 
agenda, have decided to propose a gov-
ernment-sanctioned, 
taxpayer-funded 
ministry of truth. This not only runs 
contrary to the values of our Nation 
but is likely unconstitutional and Con-
gress should play no part in its cre-
ation. In fact, Congress should come 
together to uphold the constitutional 
principles that the best weapon against 
speech we don’t like is not censure; it 
is more speech. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
KATKO) to further speak on the amend-
ment. 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in opposition to the previous 
question and in support of the imme-
diate consideration of legislation intro-
duced by Leader MCCARTHY and House 
Republicans to defund and prohibit the 
activities of the Biden administration’s 
Disinformation Governance Board at 
the Department of Homeland Security. 
That 
is 
right: 
It 
is 
called 
the 
Disinformation Governance Board. 
The notion that this ill-conceived ef-
fort will improve Americans’ trust in 
their government is fundamentally ab-
surd. In fact, it is just the latest exam-
ple of how this administration, and 
specifically leadership at the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security, remains 
grossly out of touch with what issues 
matter most to the American people. 
At a time when the border is in a 
state of crisis and more Americans 
than ever before are being fatally 
poisoned with fentanyl, everyone in 
this room and in this country would be 
wise 
to 
take 
note 
that 
this, 
a 
Disinformation Governance Board, is 
what your Department of Homeland 
Security is focused on. 
b 1845 
Are they focused on combating the 
drug cartels and human traffickers 
that are profiting from the chaos at 
our southwest border? Apparently not. 
Are they focused on improving our 
economic 
security 
and 
resilience 
against unprecedented threats from 
China, Russia, and others? It doesn’t 
seem like it. 
Madam Speaker, as ranking member 
of the Homeland Security Committee, I 
witnessed firsthand the consistent lack 
of transparency demonstrated by Sec-
retary Mayorkas and the Department 
of Homeland Security when faced with 
congressional oversight and legitimate 
requests for information on the depart-
ment’s mission. 
Why on Earth would we trust the 
same department to now unilaterally 
expand their mission and decide for us, 
the public, what is or is not the truth? 
Why has the Department of Homeland 
Security been unable or unwilling to 
answer basic questions as to the func-
tions, remit, or charter of this board 
when asked by Congress? 
If the Biden administration was seri-
ous about making the board apolitical, 
as they claim they are, why have they 
opted 
to 
appoint 
known 
partisan 
operatives as its executive director and 
co-chairs? In fact, it is reported that 
the named executive director herself 
has promoted now-debunked claims on 
social media. Think about that. The 
person that they claim to be the execu-
tive director is now the one that has in 
the 
past 
herself 
engaged 
in 
disinformation. That is pretty ironic. 
I ask you, Madam Speaker, and my 
colleagues across the aisle, where is 
the accountability for this misguided 
operation? With this vote, we have the 
opportunity to send a clear message: 
This administration should focus on re-
storing our national security, not mak-
ing itself the arbiter of truth and 
speech. This is America, this isn’t a 
Communist country. 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. GREEN). 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I thank Mr. RASKIN for the time, 
and I thank Mr. LEVIN for what he has 
done to bring this resolution to fru-
ition. 
Madam Speaker, today I rise to de-
fend the rights of our staff to organize. 
This really is about respect. We should 
respect their rights: Their right to 
have a decent day’s pay for a hard 
day’s work, their right to have the best 
healthcare that we can afford. 
I respect them, I support them, and I 
respect the right of all workers to or-
ganize. Hence, I will vote for the legis-
lation. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Louisiana (Mr. JOHNSON). 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to oppose the pre-
vious question so that we can imme-
diately consider H.R. 7690 to defund the 
Biden administration’s recently an-
nounced 
Disinformation 
Governance 
Board. 
Madam Speaker, the Biden adminis-
tration’s decision to create this board 
is dystopian in design and should be 
doomed right from the start. 
Madam Speaker, the Disinformation 
Governance Board should be defunded 
for one obvious reason. It is not only 
Orwellian, as everyone has said, but it 
is clearly unconstitutional. In Amer-
ica, we don’t allow bureaucrats and 
government officials to choose what 
speech is deemed acceptable or censor 
and silence viewpoints they dislike. 
This fundamental principle of our 
law must always be vigorously de-
fended to preserve our freedom and to 
keep the government in check. I used 
to defend this principle in the Federal 
courts before I was elected to Congress, 
and I am so encouraged to work with 
so many colleagues, at least on this 
side of the aisle here, who are also 
fiercely committed to this cause. 
Let’s put this simply: There is zero 
role for the Federal Government in de-
termining 
what 
constitutes 
true 
speech. But while we have everybody’s 
attention, let’s just recap this real 
quickly. 
This 
Disinformation 
Governance 
Board will be housed within the De-
partment of Homeland Security. It was 
just 
announced 
by 
ambush, 
very 
abruptly, 
by 
Secretary 
Mayorkas. 
There is no information about its budg-
et. There is no information provided to 
us about the scope of its work, no in-
formation about how it will be kept ac-
countable. Basically, there are no de-
tails at all. Remember, this is from the 
same administration that wants to spy 
on parents who speak up at school 
board meetings and spy on our bank 
accounts. This governance board is a 
glaring example of mission creep, and 
even its name is creepy. 
Here is what we do know, Madam 
Speaker: The board is supposed to be 
headed by a young woman by the name 
of Nina Jankowicz, who refers to her-
self—no kidding—as the Mary Poppins 
of disinformation. 
Miss Poppins is herself a frequent 
purveyor of untruths, such as calling 
the New York Post’s report on Hunter 
Biden’s laptop a ‘‘Russian influence 
op’’ and promoting the false claim that 
the Steele dossier was ‘‘Republican op-
position research.’’ She also appears 
sympathetic to the cause of censorship 
because she told NPR recently that she 
shudders—that is her word—to think 
about a country where free speech ab-
solutists, again quoting her, were tak-
ing over more platforms. She rec-
ommended that law enforcement and 
legislatures do more to censor Ameri-
cans. 
To help her hit the ground running in 
doing what is certain to be a short 
stint in this job, here is what we sug-
gest: She ought to check out the recent

falsehoods from her own administra-
tion. 
Here is a hit list: 
The 
falsehood 
that 
Secretary 
Mayorkas has done an ‘‘effective job’’ 
managing the border crisis and that it 
is somehow secure. He said that under 
oath here a couple weeks ago. 
The falsehood that economic contrac-
tion in Quarter 1 of this year is actu-
ally just masking some hidden, broad 
economic resiliency. 
The falsehood that Biden’s $3.5 tril-
lion spending bill actually cost zero 
dollars. 
The falsehood that inflation is a 
high-class problem, as they told us. 
The falsehood that 70 percent of our 
current inflation is being caused by 
Vladimir Putin. 
You get the point. 
The problem with the government 
appointing itself as the arbiter of truth 
is that it is often the government itself 
that often engages in spin and untruth. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentleman. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, if the Biden administration 
was itself a beacon of truth, this board 
would still be unconstitutional. I would 
tell my colleagues, if this was being 
proposed by a Republican administra-
tion, we would be fighting it just as vo-
ciferously. 
I do find it noteworthy, however, 
that those who seem the most pre-
occupied with censoring Americans and 
policing disinformation are so often 
themselves the worst offenders at 
spreading it. 
Again, here is the bottom line: The 
government has no role whatsoever in 
determining what constitutes truth or 
acceptable speech. 
President Biden should dissolve this 
board immediately and entirely; and if 
he won’t, Republicans will. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on 
the previous question so we may amend 
the rule to provide for immediate con-
sideration of my legislation to defund 
the DHS Disinformation Governance 
Board. 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the distinguished gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. DOGGETT). 
Mr. DOGGETT. Madam Speaker, to-
night 
we 
stand 
with 
courageous 
Ukrainians who refuse to give in to 
Putin’s war crimes. 
The morning after this unprovoked 
attack, I authored the first sanctions 
legislation in this Congress. Eventu-
ally, it may help. But what is needed 
immediately is more weapons and hu-
manitarian relief. 
Undoubtedly, Putin was encouraged 
by those he hoped would divide the 
West, 
like 
his 
admirer 
President 
Trump, who declared Putin ‘‘a genius’’ 
and called this ‘‘a peacekeeping mis-
sion,’’ and his close adviser who, even 
after 
the 
bombing 
got 
underway, 
claimed that Putin was being too 
gentle. 
With our weapons, Ukrainians defend 
not only themselves, but freedom and 
democracy everywhere. Tonight, I hope 
that Republicans will join Democrats 
in what is truly a test of our commit-
ment to freedom. Together, we offer 
strong support for Ukraine to push 
back on the brutal aggressor, end this 
terror, and maintain its independence. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Colorado (Mrs. BOEBERT). 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to oppose the previous question so 
that we can immediately consider H.R. 
7690. 
Madam Speaker, the Biden regime 
wants to talk disinformation? Okay, 
let’s give them something to talk 
about. 
Let’s talk about how the White 
House said that it was Republicans 
that want to defund the police. 
Let’s 
talk 
about 
how 
Secretary 
Mayorkas said the southern border is 
closed. 
Let’s talk about how Joe Biden said 
his Build Back Better agenda cost zero 
American tax dollars. 
Let’s talk about how Biden’s new 
press secretary falsely claimed Trump 
stole the 2016 Presidential election. 
And remember Afghanistan? Let’s 
talk about how Joe Biden said any 
American who wants to come home, we 
will get you home. Well, that sounds 
like the words of a lying, dog-faced 
pony soldier to me. 
The American people will not have 
their speech monitored by corrupt, ca-
reer professional politicians who lie 
day in and day out. 
And now the DHS, a militarized de-
partment, 
has 
established 
a 
new 
Disinformation Governance Board, or 
more accurately known as the depart-
ment of propaganda. DHS was created 
to stop terrorism. Now it is being used 
to terrorize the American people. 
And who did Mayorkas hire to run 
this Orwellian ministry of truth? This 
lady, Nina Jankowicz. Mayorkas calls 
her an expert on disinformation, prob-
ably because she tells lies all the dang 
time. Nina said that President Trump 
would embolden ISIS. Well, he defeated 
it. Nina said the Hunter Biden laptop 
from hell was a Trump campaign prod-
uct. Nina said that concerned parents 
who wanted a say in their children’s 
education were pushing disinformation; 
and Nina said Big Tech should censor 
the Wuhan lab leak theory because it 
was, you guessed it, disinformation. 
Nina doesn’t seem to have a good re-
lationship with truth and will surely 
use this board to silence Americans. 
Nina is no public servant. How is that, 
you say? Don’t take it from me. Here 
are her words. Are these the words of a 
public servant? What do I need to do 
to—well, Madam Speaker, I will let you 
read the rest of that. This doesn’t 
sound like someone who should be 
monitoring Americans’ speech. 
The Democratic Party has truly lost 
their minds, from intimidating judges 
at their homes, burning down preg-
nancy centers, and vandalizing church-
es, to calling moms and dads domestic 
terrorists, and now creating this de-
partment to censor free speech because 
extremists are scared of, what, Elon 
Musk? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mrs. BOEBERT. They say social 
media censoring doesn’t go far enough. 
And this needs to be defunded. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman is no longer recognized. 
Members are reminded to refrain 
from engaging in personalities toward 
the President while speaking on the 
floor of the House. 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, the 
very distinguished gentlewoman from 
Colorado called the President of the 
United States, or likened him to, I 
think she said, a lying, dog-faced pony 
soldier. 
We obviously could have taken those 
words down, but we have serious busi-
ness to do here, and unlike some of our 
colleagues on the other side, we are not 
interested in censoring other people’s 
speech. We want the whole world to see 
how the gentlewoman from Colorado 
speaks in public as a Member of Con-
gress. We want everyone to look at 
that. 
Meantime, we have come here to-
night, Madam Speaker, to fight for the 
rights of the TSA workforce. More 
than 50,000 workers. We are giving 
them the same rights that other Fed-
eral workers have. We came here to 
fight for the rights of Federal fire-
fighters, tens of thousands of them, 
who will be able to benefit from this 
legislation if and when they get sick 
from illnesses caused by their work as 
firefighters. 
We came here to expand and improve 
the Community Services Block Grant 
Modernization Act of 2022, a bipartisan 
piece of legislation. Despite what was 
said about it on the other side, I be-
lieve there were eight Members of the 
minority who voted for it in the House 
Education and Labor Committee. 
We are here to recognize the right of 
congressional staff to unionize, and we 
are here most significantly, Madam 
Speaker, on the Additional Ukraine 
Supplemental Appropriations Act. 
It is for that act that the antics and 
the diatribes of our colleagues are so 
profoundly disappointing to those of us 
who have come here to support Presi-
dent Zelenskyy and the heroic people 
of Ukraine who are resisting a brutal, 
illegal aggression by Vladimir Putin 
and his army. 
b 1900 
And we were hoping that we would 
have a bipartisan, unanimous support 
for this legislation to render the mili-
tary and strategic economic and hu-
manitarian aid that our democratic al-
lies need, and they are asking for and 
deserve, to fight off this illegal crimi-
nal aggression by Vladimir Putin, who 
is not a genius but a war criminal and 
a mass murderer. That is what he is.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4770 
May 10, 2022 
We are very proud of the work that 
President Biden has been doing in uni-
fying the democratic world against the 
autocrat Vladimir Putin and his naked, 
bloody aggression against the people of 
Ukraine, which has cost the lives of 
thousands of civilians already. We have 
seen the war crime of rape spread at 
the hands of Russian’s filthy soldiers, 
and we have seen them kill children, 
blow up schools and hospitals. 
We don’t see anything remotely like 
the seriousness and the solemnity that 
we would expect of Members of the 
United States Congress. Instead, they 
put up profanity, they mock the Presi-
dent of the United States, they make a 
disgrace of their own party by the way 
they behave on the floor of the House 
of Representatives. 
Madam Speaker, Vladimir Putin and 
his cheerleaders all over the world 
thought they would make quick work 
of the people of Ukraine and President 
Zelenskyy. They only had supplies for 
less than a week. Everybody thought it 
was just going to be game over, as 
some of our colleagues have said; that 
Vladimir Putin would just cut right 
through them. 
But you know what they weren’t 
counting on, Madam Speaker? They 
weren’t counting on the spirit of a 
democratic people, the noble people of 
Ukraine who have heroically resisted 
every criminal aggressive act by Vladi-
mir Putin and his autocratic cheer-
leaders around the world. 
So today, 21⁄2 months later, President 
Biden, having rallied the democratic 
world, having unified NATO, comes 
back to us and asks for nearly $40 bil-
lion in aid to support the strategic 
needs, the security needs, the economic 
needs, the humanitarian needs of a 
population that is reeling from the 
war. 
Madam Speaker, we say the Amer-
ican people are here to support the 
Ukrainian people. That is what we are 
doing here tonight. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair will remind Members that re-
marks in debate may not engage in 
personalities toward the President, in-
cluding by repeating remarks made 
elsewhere that would be improper if 
spoken in the Member’s own words. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. PFLUGER). 
Mr. PFLUGER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to oppose the previous question so 
that we can immediately consider H.R. 
7690 to DEFUND the Biden’s Adminis-
tration DHS Disinformation Govern-
ance Board. 
However, before I get into that, I 
would remind my colleague that just a 
couple months ago, that the adminis-
tration did offer a ride to President 
Zelenskyy, offered him a ride out of 
Ukraine to leave the country that he 
so valiantly has been fighting for. I 
want to make sure that that is set 
straight. And we will get back to the 
business at hand: The Disinformation 
Governance Board. 
The fact is that the administration 
thinks that they should be policing 
disinformation. It is beyond alarming. 
And I am trying to put myself back 
into the shoes of the Founders 240 
years ago, to think that the govern-
ment would be in charge of personal 
views of the First Amendment. 
The antics, as it has been called here, 
my 
750,000-plus 
constituents 
don’t 
think what I am saying right now are 
antics. What they are proud of is we 
are standing up to say that we do af-
firm that the government does not get 
to determine what is true and false. 
Personally, I have heard the Sec-
retary 
of 
Homeland 
Security, 
Mayorkas, claim that our border is se-
cure, but millions of illegal immi-
grants are allowed to pour into our 
country, including known and sus-
pected 
terrorists. 
Even 
more 
dis-
turbing, is that Secretary Mayorkas 
has put an outspoken partisan person, 
who has mocked stories, including 
those about Hunter Biden’s laptop, has 
praised the now-debunked Steele dos-
sier, and other stories out into the pub-
lic, while claiming to now be the pur-
veyor of truth. The lack of credibility 
and the misinformation is beyond 
laughable. 
The Department of Homeland Secu-
rity should be focused on one thing, 
and this is not a partisan issue. It is 
our security. It is our Nation’s secu-
rity. That is what DHS was founded on 
after September 11. That is what the 
focus should be on right now, not fact- 
checking social media or censoring 
Americans. 
Today, every Member of Congress 
will be put on RECORD, and the ques-
tion will be: Do you stand on the side 
of free speech or not? 
I stand on the side of free speech for 
my constituents, the 750,000 who I be-
lieve would not call what I am saying 
antics. 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Our colleagues don’t seem to want to 
talk about the chaos and the violence 
and the bloodshed that has been un-
leashed on the people of Ukraine. I am 
really shocked that they don’t want to 
talk about it, but they want to talk 
about free speech. 
Great. Let’s talk about free speech in 
Russia. 
More than 15,000 people arrested and 
detained as they crush the antiwar 
movement in Russia, as he jails polit-
ical opponents in Russia. And they 
haven’t said a word about that. 
Have they said anything about the 
opponents of the war in Russia who 
have been thrown into jail? No. 
They are talking about a board in 
America that I wasn’t even aware ex-
isted—I am not sure it does—that has 
never thrown anybody in a jail. 
How do they feel about Russian crit-
ics of the war being thrown into jail? 
How do they feel about more than 8 
million Ukrainians who have been dis-
placed by the war, who are living in the 
homes of the Polish people who have 
heroically opened their doors to them? 
They say nothing about that. 
Do they think that Vladimir Putin is 
the leader of a democracy? 
Is there any one of them who will 
stand up and say that Vladimir Putin 
is an autocrat, an authoritarian, a 
would-be totalitarian? 
Do any of them remember that Vladi-
mir Putin was the head of the KGB? 
Is that their ideal model for civil lib-
erties? Vladimir Putin, who said that 
the collapse of the Soviet Union is the 
greatest catastrophe of the 20th cen-
tury? 
Is this Abraham Lincoln’s party we 
are hearing today? Or is it a cult of 
Donald Trump? 
Madam Speaker, we have to decide 
which side America is going to be on. 
The democratic world has risen as one 
to support the people of Ukraine, and 
yet, our friends don’t seem to want to 
talk about that. They don’t want to 
seem to support this effort, which is 
extraordinary to me, as the people of 
Ukraine are doing whatever they can 
to fight this naked, illegal aggression, 
this 
unilateral 
war 
of 
aggression; 
unprovoked, unjustified, a violation of 
international law in every way. 
Madam Speaker, it is incumbent 
upon us as the leader of the democratic 
world, if that is still what we want to 
be, to support democracies under at-
tack by authoritarian regimes. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. ROY). 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, the gen-
tleman from Maryland talked about 
protecting this institution or talked 
about this institution, but we have a 
$40 billion bill at 3 o’clock in the after-
noon. I haven’t had a chance to review 
the bill. My staff is poring over the 
pages to try to see what’s in it. 
You want to talk about the institu-
tion? You want to talk about standing 
up alongside Ukraine? 
Why don’t we actually have a debate 
on the floor of the people’s House in-
stead of the garbage of getting a $40 
billion bill at 3 o’clock in the after-
noon; not paid for, without having any 
idea what is really in it, with a massive 
slush fund that goes to the State De-
partment—$13 billion; $8 billion for the 
Economic Support Fund, $110 million 
for embassy security. 
We got $40 billion that is unpaid for, 
and you want to sit here and lecture 
this body about what we are going to 
do or not do about standing alongside 
Ukraine? 
Why don’t we talk about the Amer-
ican people who are hurting, the wide- 
open borders; the inflation that is kill-
ing people; the jobs that people can’t 
get because of the cost of goods and 
services in this country. 
Sitting here and being lectured to, 
when I don’t even have time to look at 
a $40 billion unpaid bill.

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.

is recognized. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Texas 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
I reject the notion that America is 
not strong enough to stand with 
Ukraine as it tramples on autocracy. I 
reject the notion that America and the 
American people are not strong enough 
to stand with those in Ukraine who are 
fighting for their survival and fighting 
against the horrible violence of Vladi-
mir Putin. I reject the notion that 
Americans are not empathetic about 
Mariupol and what the mayor at that 
time on April 12 said; he noted that 210 
children were murdered by this vicious 
bombing in the midst of 21,000 dead. 
As I traveled with Leader HOYER, 
over and over again I asked the ques-
tion about the children. As UNICEF 
said, this war is a nightmare for 
Ukraine’s children. 
This supplemental for Ukraine recog-
nizes that. It recognizes that democ-
racy must stand but that children must 
be protected with the focus on humani-
tarian aid, eliminating or stopping 
human trafficking, and recognizing 
that girls and women have been raped. 
It is time for us to speak what the 
American people have spoken, that

they are standing with Ukraine. They 
want a victory for Ukraine. 
This supplemental will help us stand 
with Ukraine. I ask my colleagues to 
support it and to recognize victory for 
Ukraine. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I am 
prepared to close, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I am pre-
pared to close, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to com-
ment a little bit. There have been some 
complaints that our speakers on our 
side of the aisle here are not addressing 
the issues in Ukraine and the bill that 
has been presented to us this after-
noon. But right now we are talking 
about the rule, and we are dealing with 
procedures for what will happen the 
rest of this week. 
This is a rules debate, and we will get 
to the substance of the issue and the 
debate on each of the bills that we are 
talking about right now. I am sure, I 
know that our Members will be talking 
about the Ukraine bill and some of the 
concerns and some of the positives 
about that bill with all of the time 
that is allotted for those debates later 
today. I am sure that there will be 
great discussion about each of the bills 
at great length. 
In the meantime, there is great con-
cern regarding the Disinformation Gov-
ernance Board, and I think that this 
body needs to discuss that. That is why 
we bring it up. 
Mr. Speaker, I oppose the rule and 
the previous question, I ask Members 
to do the same, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for her remarks. We 
were interrupted by a motion to ad-
journ a few moments ago. 
Ukrainians are being slaughtered by 
Putin’s army as we speak. Schools, 
churches, and hospitals have been 
bombarded, and yet I think 188 of our 
colleagues voted just to pack it up and 
to go home instead of acting to provide 
the people of Ukraine and President 
Zelenskyy with the military and hu-
manitarian assistance that they need. I 
am very glad, and I thank the bipar-
tisan majority that rejected that ap-
proach, and I want us to make sure we 
are sending a message of hope and soli-
darity to the people of Ukraine. 
Mr. Speaker, if we have isolationists 
in the House, I hope that they don’t 
flatter themselves to think that Vladi-
mir Putin is some kind of civil liber-
tarian. Vladimir Putin is no civil liber-
tarian for those people who have found 
the cause of civil liberties today. 
Vladimir Putin is no civil libertarian. 
He is shutting down the freedom of 
speech and blocking his people’s access 
to social media. He has thrown thou-
sands of people into prison for pro-
testing against his war in Ukraine. He 
just signed a new law to impose 15 
years in prison on anyone who pub-
lishes or broadcasts what Russian Gov-
ernment censors consider false infor-
mation about the invasion of Ukraine. 
In fact, it is against the law in Rus-
sia now to even describe the invasion of 
Ukraine and the war against Ukraine 
as an invasion or a war. You can’t de-
scribe it. Talk about Orwellian. 
Why did we hear nothing from our 
colleagues about that? 
Do they actually think that Vladimir 
Putin is fighting for civil liberties in 
his bloody and filthy invasion of 
Ukraine and his attempt to demolish a 
country? 
Mr. Speaker, the American people in 
every public opinion poll we have seen 
stand strongly with the people of 
Ukraine. They understand illegal ag-
gression when they see it. We know 
that Vladimir Putin is trying to crush 
the 
sovereignty 
of 
the 
people 
of 
Ukraine. 
America stands with the NATO coun-
tries. America stands with the demo-
cratic governments and peoples of the 
world. America stands with democracy 
all over the world. That is who we are. 
That is who we are. We will never for-
get it, and we will never let go of it. We 
will not fall prey to Putin’s propa-
ganda, his disinformation, or the con-
spiracy theory that tries to blind us to 
the reality of what is happening in 
Ukraine today. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on 
the rule and the previous question. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speak-
er, this past February, a Democrat staffer or-
ganization began a public campaign to 
unionize. A month later, the Committee on 
House Administration held a hearing on the 
topic of congressional unions. 
To be clear, that hearing was not to con-
sider the resolution that is before the House 
floor today, much less a mark-up. That hear-
ing was, however, an opportunity to ask the 
Office of Congressional Workplace Rights— 
the office that administers the law governing 
unionization efforts in Congress—questions 
about how staffer unions would logistically 
work. The result of that hearing was more un-
answered questions. 
While unions play a vital role in many work-
places, including throughout my district, they 
just aren’t feasible for Congress. OCWR’s own 
General Counsel was unable to provide an-
swers regarding how the unique office struc-
tures, fluctuating partisan balance, and un-
avoidable turnover due to elections would im-
pact 
congressional 
unions. 
Yet 
Speaker 
PELOSI is bringing forward the resolution for a 
vote anyway. 
This isn’t about helping all staffers, because 
if it were then the majority would have given 
Republicans the opportunity to provide our 
input, including a chance to amend today’s 
resolution. But once again, the majority is 
abandoning regular order to push a partisan 
proposal. 
One of the main concerns of staffers is low 
pay. As a former staffer myself, I know both 
the opportunities and challenges of working in 
a Congressional office and can assure you 
that an office providing fair pay and maintain-
ing a healthy work environment are the keys 
to recruiting and retaining top talent. And I 
have great news for everyone here today: you 
don’t need to wait for the Speaker to unilater-
ally implement a pay order to start doing so. 
Every Member’s office was provided a 21 per-
cent MRA increase in March of this year. 
Further, collective bargaining would not and 
could not address the issue of low pay—Fed-
eral law forbids this. Federal law also prohibits 
negotiation on healthcare and retirement ben-
efits even if this resolution were to pass. In-
stead, union dues would just take more money 
out of staff’s hard-earned paychecks without 
really anything to show for it. 
Unionization also creates potential conflicts 
of interest that could impact a Member’s con-
stitutional responsibilities, including unique in-
fluence over Members’ development and pas-
sage of certain legislation, and political con-
tributions to Members using dues paid by their 
staff. As a reminder, under current law, con-
gressional staff are not allowed to make polit-
ical contributions to their employers. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose this resolu-
tion because it is quite simple: unions don’t 
make sense for Congress. 
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, today 
I rise in strong support of H. Res. 1096 be-
cause I believe the time has come to recog-
nize our Congressional Workers’ Right to Or-
ganize. Just as celebrated Mexican American 
Civil Rights Activist and Labor Leader, Cesar 
Chavez said (‘‘ Se Puede.’’). Yes, you can. 
Madam Speaker, the American Labor Move-
ment was born out of a creed and funda-
mental belief rooted firmly in protecting the 
common interests of workers by promoting 
and advancing the social, political, and eco-
nomic equality of every man, woman, and 
child. 
Throughout our nation’s history, workers 
have come together to bravely share their 
workplace experiences and illustrate their 
need for the protected right to organize. The 
earliest labor unions were inspired by a just 
society, deriving their ideals from the Amer-
ican Revolution. They sought to create condi-
tions that fostered social equality, celebrated 
honest labor, and relied on independent and 
virtuous citizenship. 
It was the American Federation of Labor, a 
union, that successfully negotiated wage in-
creases for its members and enhanced work-
place safety in the early 20th Century. 
And it was the dedication and efforts from 
unions like United Farm Workers, United Auto 
Workers, and United Steelworkers, that have 
long championed religious freedoms, the 
evolving demands of the environmental move-
ment; the rights of farm workers; promoting 
human rights both domestically and abroad; 
advancing civil liberties; social justice, and 
economic equality for every American. 
It took President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s 
leadership and the hard work of unions for 
Congress to pass the Fair Labor Standards 
Act in 1938, which is responsible for estab-
lishing the eight-hour day and five-day week 
for wage employees. As FDR once told union 
and civil-rights leader A. Philip Randolph, he 
agreed with the labor movement’s ideas, but it 
was the work of the activists that made him go 
out and advocate for these reforms. 
Throughout our Nation’s history, workers 
and their unions have agitated lobbied, orga-
nized, struck, and voted for decades to 
achieve more equitable and safe working con-
ditions. 
For the past thirty years, it has been my 
great honor to serve the California’s 40th Con-
gressional District and the American people. I

have been able to do this through a hard- 
working, dedicated and committed staff. 
I am happy to join my colleagues in bringing 
Congressional Staff closer to having the legal 
right to organize and bargain collectively. 
Yes, you can. 
(Si, Se Puede) 
The material previously referred to 
by Mrs. FISCHBACH is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 1097 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 17. Immediately upon adoption of this 
resolution, the House shall proceed to the 
consideration in the House of the bill (H.R. 
7690) to prohibit the use of Federal funds to 
establish or carry out the activities of a 
Disinformation Governance Board of the De-
partment of Homeland Security, and for 
other purposes. All points of order against 
consideration of the bill are waived. The bill 
shall be considered as read. All points of 
order against provisions in the bill are 
waived. The previous question shall be con-
sidered as ordered on the bill and on any 
amendment thereto to final passage without 
intervening motion except: (1) one hour of 
debate equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of the 
Committee on Homeland Security; and (2) 
one motion to recommit. 
SEC. 18. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not 
apply to the consideration of H.R. 7690. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time, and I 
move the previous question on the res-
olution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on ordering the previous 
question. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it.

bers will record their vote by elec-
tronic device.

billion in much-needed emergency se-
curity, economic, and humanitarian 
aid to support the Ukrainian people 
and defend global democracy in the 
wake of Russia’s unprovoked attack on 
Ukraine. 
For nearly 3 months now, Putin’s 
greed, 
growing 
aggression, 
and 
unyielding pursuit of power have led to 
grievous loss of life and humanitarian 
devastation. The cruelty against inno-
cent civilians at the hands of Putin and 
his cronies is devastating. The images 
of the violence and terror coming from 
Ukraine should horrify us all. 
Entire cities are being demolished. 
Ukraine’s democracy is being under-
mined every single day. Women and 
girls are being sexually abused by cruel 
Russian soldiers. Hospitals and univer-
sities, which should be safe havens, are 
being 
intentionally 
attacked. 
War 
crimes are being carried out every sin-
gle day as part of a deeply dangerous 
pattern of extensive shootings, torture, 
and other violent crimes. Thousands of 
innocent children and their families 
have been brutally murdered. As a re-
sult, nearly 6 million Ukrainians have 
been forced to flee their country, and 
another 61⁄2 million have been displaced 
inside war-torn Ukraine. 
Given the magnitude of the terror 
campaign being waged against the 
Ukrainian people and Ukrainian de-
mocracy, we are morally obligated to 
ensure the brave Ukrainian fighters 
and the Ukrainian people have the se-
curity and economic aid that they 
need. I am proud to be standing here 
today in support of a bill that does just 
that. 
This legislation invests strongly to 
support Ukraine’s dire efforts to defend 
itself by keeping weapons and ammuni-
tion 
flowing 
without 
interruption. 
With $6 billion for the Ukraine Secu-
rity Assistance Initiative, we will pro-
vide 
the 
equipment, 
training, 
and 
weapons that the Ukrainian military 
and national security forces need to 
continue to protect the Ukrainian peo-
ple. And at the same time, we are pro-
viding additional support for Ukraine 
and our allies and partners in the re-
gion as they continue to build and up-
date their capabilities. 
But we know very well that Russia’s 
invasion is not only a threat to 
Ukraine’s physical security, but also a 
threat to the very core of Ukrainian 
and global democracy. This bill will in-
vest in critical economic assistance to 
help Ukraine protect its democracy by 
ensuring the continuity of its demo-
cratic 
government, 
by 
countering 
human trafficking, and by fighting 
dangerous Russian lies. 
But the impact of this war does not 
end there. The prolonged invasion has 
taken an immense toll globally, where 
people the world over are suffering 
from a growing food insecurity and the 
rising costs of food. To address this 
devastating reality, we are providing 
more than $5 billion in emergency food 
assistance and support for agricultural 
development. As we support the fight 
against 
Russian 
aggression, 
those 
struggling to put food on the table, the 
most vulnerable people around our 
world deserve our support. 
And none of the devastation caused 
would have been possible without help 
from Putin’s cronies. For that reason, 
the funding in this bill will continue 
efforts to hold them accountable for 
the terror they have caused the people 
of Ukraine. With funds to seize, retain, 
and sell the forfeited property of Rus-
sia’s criminal kleptocrats who enable 
Putin’s regime war crimes, this bill en-
sures that we are one step closer to 
making them pay the full price for 
their actions. And in the process, we 
will 
be 
standing 
firmly 
with 
the 
Ukrainian people while combating the 
exploitation of Ukraine’s vulnerable fi-
nancial system. 
For those Ukrainians who managed 
to find refuge at our borders, this bill 
provides funds to expand support serv-
ices that will make sure they feel safe 
here as they search for peace and for 
freedom. 
We are providing funds for trauma 
care, housing assistance, case manage-
ment, English language classes, and for 
screenings, vaccinations, and ongoing 
public health surveillance. 
The Ukrainian people are in des-
perate need of our support, and Rus-
sia’s invasion of Ukraine continues to 
threaten peace and democracy around

the globe. This bill will protect democ-
racy, limit Russian aggression, and 
strengthen our own national security 
while, most importantly, supporting 
Ukraine. We have no room to fail and 
must act swiftly and decisively. 
The Members of this body came to-
gether quickly in March to provide 
critical security and economic support 
for the people of Ukraine. 
Mr. Speaker, while I am saddened 
and angry that we have to be here 
again today, Russia’s continued aggres-
sion and this vicious invasion require 
us to act decisively in support of 
Ukraine, our allies in the region, and 
the millions of others suffering as a re-
sult of this war. 
We need to protect global democracy, 
limiting Russian aggression in the 
longer term, and strengthening our 
own national security. Failure is not 
an option. 
For those critical reasons, I urge my 
colleagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 7691, a bill that would provide 
additional assistance to Ukraine and 
other partners in the region. Ten weeks 
ago, we witnessed Russia begin its at-
tack 
on 
the 
sovereign 
nation 
of 
Ukraine. 
To support Ukraine and our allies 
during the unprovoked, illegal, and ap-
palling attack, Congress provided near-
ly $14 billion in emergency funding 
through the fiscal year 2022 appropria-
tions bills. That funding has been cru-
cial in Ukraine’s efforts to fight back 
against Putin’s evil invasion. 
The bill before us today would pro-
vide roughly $40 billion in assistance to 
address the ongoing conflict. With Rus-
sia continuing to take control of the 
country, more resources are needed to 
provide military assistance to Ukrain-
ian forces, address the humanitarian 
crisis created by this conflict, and sup-
port our allies in the region. 
A large portion of the bill will also go 
to backfill DOD’s weapons and equip-
ment. The United States has the best 
weapons in the world, and it is critical 
that we not only supply those to our 
allies in their time of need, as we have 
done in Ukraine, but that we ensure 
our own troops continue to have what 
they need. 
As China, Iran, and North Korea 
watch our response, we must show the 
world that America stands firm with 
its allies and will do what is necessary 
to protect our interests abroad. 
For those reasons, I urge my col-
leagues to join me in supporting this 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Ohio 
(Ms. KAPTUR), the chairwoman of the 
Appropriations Subcommittee on En-
ergy and Water Development, who has 
been a leader leading the effort and the 
fight to make sure that we help to pre-
serve democracy in Ukraine and to 
really be responsive to the Ukrainian 
people. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chair DELAURO for her leadership in 
moving this bill to the floor with such 
dispatch and content. 
I rise tonight to urge passage of this 
essential $40 billion supplemental secu-
rity package for Ukraine. 
The battle for Ukraine and what it is 
waging, for liberty, is not one for her 
to fight alone. The world must recog-
nize the true evil that free people ev-
erywhere are confronting. Indeed, lib-
erty’s survival and the global rule of 
law are on the line. Russia invaded an 
independent sovereign nation without 
provocation. Ukraine is the scrimmage 
line for liberty on the Continent of Eu-
rope today. 
Untethered to reason or humanity, 
Putin will not stop his brutal slaughter 
of innocents. Words and well wishes 
will not be enough. What Ukraine 
needs most of all is reinforcement; it 
needs arms, ammunition, combat vehi-
cles, and air and sea defense. 
Putin’s Russia will never win this 
war. The courage and resolve of the 
Ukrainian people is already legendary, 
but to hasten the demise of Putin’s 
murderous rampage, America must act 
without delay. 
Ukraine’s fight for liberty is the 
world’s fight for liberty in this modern 
era. Let us arm Ukraine with the tools 
for the fight and put an end, sooner 
rather than later, to the bloodshed 
Putin’s madness has unleashed. ‘‘Glory 
to Ukraine, ‘‘Slava Ukraini.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman 
DELAURO for uniting all of the sub-
committees of Appropriations to bring 
this critical bill forward. I thank her 
for her leadership. 
b 2045 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
5 minutes to the gentleman from Ken-
tucky (Mr. ROGERS), the former chair-
man of the Committee on Appropria-
tions and the ranking member of the 
State, Foreign Operations, and Related 
Programs Subcommittee. 
Mr. 
ROGERS 
of 
Kentucky. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
yielding me time. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 7691, the emergency supple-
mental appropriations act for Ukraine. 
Mr. Speaker, this vital assistance 
will continue the support of Ukraine’s 
heroic and inspiring assistance of their 
countrymen and will continue to sup-
port their heroic and inspiring resist-
ance to Russia’s unprovoked invasion. 
We and our allies must continue to pro-
vide the assistance critical to defeat 
Russian aggression and help preserve 
Ukrainian independence. 
For those in this country and else-
where, Mr. Speaker, who thought that 
war was a 19th or 20th century concern, 
this crisis has underscored the impor-
tance of capable military alliances, the 
centrality of NATO, and the critical 
importance of American leadership in 
the transatlantic alliance. 
This bill provides essential military 
assistance across State Department 
and Department of Defense accounts. It 
also includes funding for Russian sanc-
tions enforcement, returns our dip-
lomats to Kyiv, and provides much- 
needed humanitarian relief for Ukraine 
and other countries impacted by this 
crisis. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the 
bill. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. LEE), the chairwoman of 
the Appropriations Subcommittee on 
State, Foreign Operations, and Related 
Programs. 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of this emergency supplemental to sup-
port Ukraine and to address the global 
impacts of Putin’s brutal invasion and 
war. I thank Chairwoman DELAURO, 
our Speaker, and Chairman MCGOVERN 
for moving this legislation so quickly. 
Mr. Speaker, a little more than a 
week ago, I had the honor of visiting 
Eastern Europe to meet with Ukrain-
ians and Poles and to learn about what 
was taking place firsthand. We met 
with civil society organizations funded 
by the United States that, in the midst 
of danger and violence, are supporting 
refugees, vulnerable people, and women 
and children. 
I was deeply moved by their stories 
and their commitment, their resil-
ience, and recognized very quickly 
what an emergency this is. So, I thank 
everyone again for bringing this bill to 
the floor right away. The Ukrainian 
people need our support to defend their 
territory, but we equally need to sup-
port their efforts to protect their peo-
ple, their economy, their way of life, 
and, yes, their democracy. 
As chair of the State, Foreign Oper-
ations, and Related Programs Sub-
committee, I am very proud that we 
provided $18.9 billion in assistance for 
economic security and humanitarian 
assistance for Ukraine in this bill. 
This 
bill 
will 
help 
sustain 
the 
Ukrainian 
Government’s 
essential 
services, protect refugees and inter-
nally 
displaced 
persons, 
clear 
unexploded 
ordnance, 
and 
combat 
human trafficking. It funds getting our 
dedicated and courageous diplomats 
back to Kyiv so that they can continue 
working on behalf of the United States 
to protect the people and the dignity of 
Ukraine. 
I 
salute 
them, 
commend 
them, and thank them for their serv-
ice. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill contains pre-
cious resources to deal with the global 
food crisis that has been deepened by 
the Russian invasion. This is truly a 
defining 
moment 
in 
our 
history, 
Ukrainian history, Poland’s history, 
and the world’s history. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
respond to the remarkable strength 
and resilience of the Ukrainian people 
and stand by them. We need to stand 
by them—we must stand by them—by

supporting this supplemental appro-
priations bill. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. PELOSI), the Speaker of the 
House of Representatives. 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding. I thank 
her and the ranking member for their 
leadership in bringing this legislation 
to the floor. It is legislation that 
makes an immediate and substantial 
difference to what is happening in 
Ukraine. 
Mr. Speaker, 10 days ago, it was my 
solemn and extraordinary privilege to 
lead a congressional delegation to 
Kyiv, where we met with President 
Zelenskyy. In the heart of his war-torn 
nation, our delegation expressed our 
deep admiration for the courage of the 
Ukrainian people as they fought for 
their democracy against autocracy and 
our endless respect for his great, heroic 
leadership. 
In return, really just from the start, 
President 
Zelenskyy 
expressed 
his 
gratitude to the American people, 
which I conveyed to this Congress and, 
therefore, to the American people for 
the extraordinary support that we have 
so far supplied—and now, tonight, more 
to come. 
He praised our President for being 
such a source of hope as well as support 
to the people of Ukraine—not only for 
our support but for the unifying force 
he has been in this fight. 
Mr. Speaker, as Putin desperately ac-
celerates his campaign of horror and 
brutality in Ukraine, time is of the es-
sence. That is why we are so pleased to 
hear that we could proceed imme-
diately with this bill today so that it 
goes to the Senate and to the Presi-
dent’s desk so that the assistance can 
reach the people of Ukraine and East-
ern Europe. We cannot afford to wait. 
Again, time is of the essence. 
The aid package we will pass today 
will be pivotal, and others have ad-
dressed what is in there in terms of 
weaponry and security issues, in terms 
of government and their economy, in 
terms of humanitarian assistance. 
I was very pleased for the delegation 
to be joined by Chairman JIM MCGOV-
ERN, chair of the Rules Committee, but 
the chair always of the food security 
initiatives in the Congress. He made 
very clear the link between what Putin 
is doing in Ukraine and the impact it 
will have on the rest of the world in 
terms of starvation because Ukraine 
has been the breadbasket of Europe and 
the world. All of the product—whether 
it is sunflower oil, whether it is wheat, 
corn, whatever—going to Africa and 
other places in the world is essential to 
their food security. 
The brutality of Putin is not just 
what he is doing in Ukraine but the im-
pact that it is having on food for the 
world. So when you are home thinking 
of what this is all about, just think: 
‘‘When I was hungry, you fed me,’’ the 
Gospel of Matthew. 
I also was so pleased that Mr. MEEKS, 
the chairman of the Committee on For-
eign Affairs, was with us because we 
talked about sanctions, which are a 
product of his committee. I mention 
that because he knows his subject very 
well, as did President Zelenskyy. But 
the fact is, what we want to see is an 
end to war. If we could end war by 
using economic sanctions, all the bet-
ter, all the better to spare human life 
on both sides of it. 
But President Putin has initiated 
hostilities into a sovereign country 
with a band leading it, thinking that 
he was going to be well-received with a 
band. What could he have been think-
ing? 
Again, Mr. MEEKS, in terms of nego-
tiations, in terms of sanctions and the 
rest, led our visit very well. 
Mr. SCHIFF, the chair of the Intel-
ligence Committee, had a very clear 
conversation 
with 
President 
Zelenskyy, the speaker of their par-
liament, and the Foreign Minister 
about how respectful of what the 
Ukrainians are doing with their own 
security—and not to be misled into 
thinking that anything but their own 
security has led to some of the suc-
cesses they have had. 
BARBARA
LEE, who we just heard 
from, the chair of the State, Foreign 
Operations, and Related Programs Sub-
committee, just so remarkable in our 
visit to Poland to talk about how we 
have not only economic assistance or 
humanitarian assistance but account-
ability, as well as help for children who 
are suffering so much there. 
Mr. KEATING, a member of both the 
Committee on Foreign Affairs and the 
Committee on Armed Services, was 
very much into the accountability 
piece. He is chair of the committee 
that is Europe, Eurasia, environment, 
global issues across borders and under-
stood the need for us to have public 
support and accountability for what we 
give. 
JASON CROW, a member of the Intel-
ligence Committee and the Armed 
Services Committee, spoke with great 
authority about weapons systems and 
the rest with President Zelenskyy and 
his team, about what they need, what 
we can convey back, and what judg-
ments are made in that regard. 
What is interesting about Mr. CROW 
is that he was a member at another 
time, earlier in his life—which wasn’t 
that long ago—he was a member of the 
82nd Airborne. When we met with the 
82nd Airborne in Poland, they were 
happy to welcome one of their former 
members. They spoke the same lan-
guage, some hoots and hollers of some 
kind. I don’t know. But nonetheless, 
his participation there was beneficial, 
especially when it came to comparing 
notes on weapons systems. 
What I think is important for the 
American people to know is that what 
Putin has done is not only an act of 
brutality; it is an act of cowardice. 
Who but a coward would pretend he 
is going to war and bomb a maternity 
hospital? 
Who but a coward would have his sol-
diers resort to the cruelty of rape of 
children or their parents in front of 
them—boys and girls? 
Who but a coward would pile these 
children in trains and take them to 
Russia? 
All of this will be a matter of coming 
to justice at some point, but right now, 
we have to have it come to a conclu-
sion that you don’t do that. It is out-
side the circle of civilized human be-
havior. 
Putin: Coward. 
In any event, what we are doing here 
is very important. It is buying weap-
onry and security assistance, govern-
ment and economic assistance, human-
itarian assistance. 
I thank Congresswoman LEE and Mr. 
MCGOVERN for their focus on all of 
that, for the refugees, for the displaced 
within Ukraine, and for those who are 
trapped under fire without food or 
fresh water or anything because their 
civilian communities are being at-
tacked by the coward Putin. 
So, we are very proud of this effort 
today. We should all be very proud that 
we had the opportunity, when Putin 
decided whatever it is he decided, to be 
brutal and cruel and a coward, that we 
were there to help. 
It is about democracy versus dicta-
torship. 
Democracy 
must 
prevail. 
Ukrainian people are fighting the fight 
for their democracy and, in doing so, 
for ours as well. We must help them 
win so that we can have bread for the 
world and feed the hungry, so we can 
stop the horrible behavior that they 
are doing in treating women and traf-
ficking women and girls. This is unbe-
lievable. 
b 2100 
It is horrible, and the world needs to 
know why this is important. The world 
needs to know why we have decided to 
go forward with this as soon as pos-
sible. 
This package builds upon the strong, 
ongoing support already delivered by 
the United States, thanks to the bipar-
tisan, bicameral unity in the Congress 
and with the administration. 
In our government funding legisla-
tion last March, we delivered $13.6 bil-
lion in humanitarian, security, and 
economic assistance. These resources 
are already reaching communities on 
the ground, helping the Ukrainians 
protect their people and repel Russian 
forces. 
Just 
yesterday, 
President 
Biden 
proudly signed into law one of our con-
sequential legislative initiatives, the 
revival of the historic lend-lease pro-
gram. Lend-lease helped turn the tide 
in the fight against fascism in World 
War II, and it will be essential in our 
mission to rescue democracy from dic-
tatorship today. 
The House also passed one that I like 
to call seize and freeze: seize the Rus-
sian assets, freeze them, and then, to 
punish the Russian oligarchs funding 
this diabolical war, use the assets, 
when they thaw, to rebuild Ukraine.

May 10, 2022 
At the same time, America has con-
tinued to move together with our allies 
to level a historic punishment against 
Putin for his senseless aggression, iso-
lating Russia and devastating its econ-
omy. 
I wish the people of Russia knew 
what he was doing to them, but he does 
not allow the truth to be heard by the 
Russian people. 
I want to say one more thing about 
all of this, and that is, when we talk 
about our partners in NATO and the 
European Union, I want to sing their 
praises because they have seen that 
their dependence on Russian oil is a 
weapon of war for the Russians. They 
have seen that unless they diversify 
away from Russian oil, they will al-
ways be enslaved by needing that oil. 
I am so pleased that they have made 
the decision that, in an appropriate 
timetable, they will be withdrawing 
from that, as we did in the House a 
number of weeks ago when we said— 
and the Senate did as well—we won’t 
be purchasing any more Russian oil. 
So again, for these and other reasons, 
it is just an honor to be associated 
with the courage of the people of 
Ukraine and the generosity of the peo-
ple of Poland and other European coun-
tries that are receiving these refugees. 
They have opened their homes and 
their hearts to them, and we need to be 
helpful in every way that we can. 
So, I salute our bipartisan leadership 
in bringing this to the floor. 
I also thank Mr. ROGERS. He was 
chair of the committee when I was on 
the committee, and I appreciated his 
remarks earlier. 
Again, I thank ROSA DELAURO for the 
efficiency and directness with which 
she was ready to bring this to the floor 
the minute the President said we can 
proceed with it as a single measure. 
I urge a strong bipartisan vote for 
this act of mercy. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Min-
nesota (Ms. MCCOLLUM), the chair of 
the Appropriations Subcommittee on 
Defense. 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of the Additional 
Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations 
Act. 
The Biden administration, Congress, 
and the American people have been un-
flinching in our support for the people 
of 
Ukraine. 
Under 
desperate 
cir-
cumstances, the Ukrainian people have 
valiantly resisted Vladimir Putin’s il-
legal, unjust, and unprovoked invasion 
of their country. 
Today, the House of Representatives 
has another opportunity not only to 
stand with the people of Ukraine but to 
stand together with our fellow democ-
racies against this authoritarian ag-
gression by passing this supplemental. 
As chair of the Appropriations De-
fense Subcommittee, I know how crit-
ical it is to continue our commitment 
to provide Ukraine with robust secu-
rity assistance. 
At the same time, we must provide 
the Department of Defense with addi-
tional tools to respond to the Russian 
aggression. That is why we have in-
cluded $20.1 billion in this legislation, 
including $6 billion for the Ukrainian 
Security Assistance Initiative to pro-
vide equipment, weapons, and training 
to the Ukrainian military. We have in-
cluded $9.1 billion to replenish stocks 
of the U.S. military equipment that 
has been donated to Ukraine. 
Last month, I had the opportunity to 
travel to Germany and Poland and 
visit with our deployed servicemem-
bers. Today, I am pleased that we have 
included flexibility for the Department 
of Defense to provide hardship pay for 
those deployed in the EUCOM region. 
This legislation also includes funding 
for desperately needed humanitarian 
relief for Ukrainian families who have 
been displaced within Ukraine or have 
fled to neighboring nations. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge our Republican 
colleagues to join us in a show of bipar-
tisan unity. Let us stand together. Let 
us pass this bill. Let us defend democ-
racies everywhere from Russian aggres-
sion. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS). 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in strong support of the 
Additional Ukraine Supplemental Ap-
propriations Act, and I do so without 
hesitation or reservation. I do so be-
cause there is no way that we could 
stand idly by and watch the horror 
that is being heaped upon our Ukrain-
ian brothers and sisters. 
Rather than just wringing our hands 
and talking about how unfortunate it 
is, we are doing something about it. We 
are bringing aid and help and assist-
ance. 
I am proud to be part of a country 
that looks out not only for itself but 
recognizes that we either stand for 
something or we fall together. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman 
for her leadership. I also must thank 
the country of Poland. I thank Poland 
for standing up in the face of dire cir-
cumstances. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Texas 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
am grateful for the leadership that we 
have shown in this Democratic Caucus, 
joined by our Republican friends. 
Let me thank the chairwoman, the 
manager of this bill, and the Repub-
lican manager, my friend from Texas. 
The one point that I think we can all 
agree to: This is a vile and violent and 
brutal and senseless war. It is Vladimir 
Putin trying to return to the greatness 
of Russia that fought Nazism but is 
now making a fiasco and light of what 
fighting Nazism is all about. 
Going to Ukraine with the Hoyer 
codel, my focus was on the terrible 
plight of children. In an op-ed that was 
printed in the Houston Chronicle, I 
said that our children in war must 
never 
suffer 
the 
nightmare 
that 
UNICEF says. 
So, I support this supplemental for 
the very reason of dealing with, one, 
providing 
for 
the 
munitions 
and 
exportability of funds to procure crit-
ical munitions, but as well the humani-
tarian aid that is to correct the devas-
tation of children who saw the bodies 
of their parents dead in the street. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Ms. DELAURO. I yield an additional 1 
minute 
to 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Texas. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for her kind-
ness. 
Dealing with the pictures that were 
depicted, but the stories that I heard of 
children sitting next to dead parents, 
or dead bodies, children unaccom-
panied, lost, orphaned. 
So my conclusion is that, in addition 
to war, we must realize that our chil-
dren are our future. 
In this bill, the administration for 
children and families, $900 million to 
provide refugee support services, hous-
ing, English language, trauma and sup-
port services to help those who have 
been trafficked or may be trafficked, to 
help those who have been raped, young 
women and children; to deal with the 
Centers for Disease Control with $54 
million to provide them medical sup-
port; and, of course, to be able to pro-
vide dealing with the migration and 
refugee circumstances that we saw in 
Poland that took 2 to 3 million refu-
gees, including children. 
b 2110 
We are standing on democracy. We 
are not afraid to stand with what is 
right, and we are not afraid to say 
glory to Ukraine. We want the victory 
for Ukraine, and we want defeat for 
Vladimir Putin. Regime change would 
be great, but we realize that will not 
happen, but defeat must happen. I sup-
port the supplemental. Let us stand for 
democracy. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Mem-
ber GRANGER for her support for this ef-
fort. As the Speaker pointed out, this 
has been a bipartisan measure since we 
moved on March 8. I also thank Chair-
man ROGERS for speaking here tonight 
as well. 
The world must see that we are 
united in our support of Ukraine. I 
think the Ukrainian people—they need 
us. They are in desperate need of our 
support. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine 
continues to threaten peace and de-
mocracy around the globe, and Vladi-
mir Putin must be held accountable.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4782 
May 10, 2022 
Why is there an unprovoked attack 
on a sovereign Nation whose only de-
sire is to be free, to be a democracy, to 
associate itself with the West? Why is 
that a provocation for being invaded, 
for 
the 
massive 
destruction 
that 
Ukraine is undergoing at the moment? 
Again, Vladimir Putin and his cronies 
must be held accountable. 
This bill does that by protecting de-
mocracy, limiting Russian aggression, 
and strengthening our own national se-
curity. We must act swiftly and deci-
sively tonight. We have not seen such a 
mobilization of support around the 
world for an ally since World War II. I 
am so proud that that mobilization has 
been led by a United States President, 
President Biden. 
It is a moral obligation. It is a moral 
responsibility. We can’t sit by and 
watch news day-in and day-out seeing 
the massive destruction that is being 
wrought on Ukraine and its citizens. 
President Zelenskyy said: Light will 
overcome darkness. And our job is to 
help to provide the light. 
I think it was stirring when you had, 
in Moscow, victory day, and President 
Putin with his extraordinary display of 
power. 
Then 
watching 
President 
Zelenskyy walk down the street of 
Kyiv on his own by himself, an extraor-
dinary leader who needs to know—and 
I think he does know—that the United 
States and the world is there to sup-
port his efforts. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER), 
the majority leader. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I apologize 
for keeping people waiting. I tend to 
speak more briefly than I usually 
speak on my 1 minute, but not because 
of the importance of this subject, not 
because of the deep feelings that I have 
that this is the right thing to do. 
Mr. Speaker, this supplemental ap-
propriations bill is a down payment on 
the security and success of democracy. 
We have paid that price before, not 
only in dollars but in lives, not only in 
Ukraine, but throughout the world. 
Yesterday, Vladimir Putin watched 
as 
the 
Russian 
military 
paraded 
through Red Square to commemorate 
victory in the Second World War. In-
stead of honoring, however, those who 
defeated fascism, Putin repeated his 
lies about the purpose of his criminal 
and unprovoked war against Ukraine. 
Putin, like Hitler, and Stalin before 
him, has denigrated the law, humani-
tarian principles, morals, and any kind 
of status in the world. We know why 
Putin invaded Ukraine—not to free its 
people, they were free, they are free; 
not to protect Russian speakers, they 
were protected with all the rights and 
security of free citizens in a nation of 
laws. In fact, I suggested that the U.N. 
send observers into eastern Ukraine to 
protect Russian speakers. 
Russia was not only under no threat 
from Ukraine, but not from any NATO 
nation either. No, the plain truth is 
that Vladimir Putin ordered the inva-
sion of Ukraine because he wanted to 
consolidate and expand his own power 
and his control over Russia. In sum, he 
wants to recreate the Russian empire, 
a tyranny, a ruling over people by 
force, not by choice. 
After the defeat of fascism in the 
Second War World, the United States 
and our allies built a global order based 
on human rights and the rule of law. In 
Ukraine, Putin sought to forge a new 
international order with help from 
China—one in which might makes 
right and strong men make rules. 
In such a view, individual freedoms 
must yield to the benefit of the leader 
and his cronies or the greatness of the 
state or ruling party. Putin believed 
that a quick victory in Ukraine would 
show his might and strengthen his rule 
and deter America and our allies to 
stand up to future acts of Russian ag-
gression. 
We have all been surprised and heart-
ened and admiring and awed by the 
courage 
and 
determination 
of 
the 
Ukrainian people and their leader. 
b 2120 
In their valiant fight they have writ-
ten a new chapter in the history of 
their nation and in the story of 
humankind’s struggle for a free world. 
Our own Nation: Give me liberty or 
give me death. 
The first stage of the war in Ukraine 
was a victory for freedom and the 
Ukrainian people. With the help of 
Western arms and aid, Ukraine de-
feated Putin’s attempt to win a quick 
and decisive victory and to occupy and 
control the capital of Ukraine. Indeed, 
they have given the Russian military a 
substantial bruising. But this war, as 
we know, is far from over. 
In the east, Russian forces continue 
their fierce assault against Ukrainian 
defenses; their criminal assaults, their 
murderous assaults, their savage as-
saults. There is not an adverse adjec-
tive that you could use, Mr. Speaker, 
that does not apply to the actions of 
Russia, its soldiers, and its leaders. 
Their seizure of towns and villages and 
their war crimes against civilians is 
meant to demoralize the Ukrainian 
people into submission. 
How awed we must be and proud of 
their determination not to be bludg-
eoned into submission. The world now 
knows that Ukrainians will fight to 
their last breath for their country. 
We have pledged our lives, our 
honor—our sacred honor—and all that 
we have. That is what our Founders 
said fighting the behemoth power, the 
world power of its day. Because of the 
courage of our Founders and those 
minutemen and those minutewomen we 
prevailed. 
I say this bill is a down payment. The 
world now knows that Ukrainians will 
fight to their last breath for their 
country—just as the fighters—and that 
is not just we have to say it, we have 
seen it in Mariupol. 
This bill is a down payment for the 
success and security of democracy; not 
just of Ukraine democracy or Ukrain-
ian freedom, but for the freedom of the 
global community. As I have said in re-
cent weeks, America and our allies 
must ensure that Putin suffers a stra-
tegic loss from this invasion. If he does 
not, every two-bit dictator in the world 
will take the lesson that we can do the 
same. 
President Biden understands this, 
which is why he requested this funding 
to provide Ukraine with the type of 
arms it needs to shift from defensive to 
offensive operations. The battle of Kyiv 
has at least for now been won. But this 
war will turn on the battle of the 
Donbas and the battle of the Black Sea 
coast. 
I urge every one of my colleagues, do 
not be dissuaded tonight by politics. 
Do not be diverted from our support of 
democracy, which 435 of us support, or 
freedom or liberty about which all of 
us talk all the time. Talk is cheap; this 
victory for democracy is not, it has 
never been, and it is not today or to-
morrow and the day thereafter. 
Let us not let Putin achieve a vic-
tory over democracy and liberty and 
freedom. Vote ‘‘yes’’ for Ukraine, for 
the American people and our democ-
racy, and for those who love liberty 
throughout this globe. Let us send a 
united message. Yes, we have political 
differences. Yes, we can sometimes be 
demeaning of one another. But when it 
comes to the defense of liberty and 
freedom, we shall be united. Vote 
‘‘yes.’’ 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, we were 
together, as I said earlier on March 8, 
in support of Ukraine. Let us be to-
gether tonight in support of Ukraine. 
Let us tell Vladimir Putin that the 
United States is leading the world in 
support of Ukraine on behalf of the 
Ukrainian people. Let him understand 
that he is alone in this world and needs 
to pay a price for this outrageous inva-
sion and unprovoked attack on a sov-
ereign nation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Pursuant to House Resolution 1097, 
the previous question is ordered on the 
bill, as amended. 
The question is on the engrossment 
and third reading of the bill. 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
and read a third time, and was read the

York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. GAR-
CIA), the sponsor of this bill. 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the chairwoman for bringing 
this bill forward, a bill that is literally 
very important, not just to the Guillen 
family but to so many constituents in 
my district. 
I also recognize that we are in the 
midst of celebrating the 1-year anni-
versary of Vanessa Guillen’s death. 
Vanessa was one of my constituents 
before she was transferred to Fort 
Hood military base for her Army train-
ing. She was a rising star before her 
life was tragically cut short. 
As Members of Congress, we have the 
moral obligation to honor Vanessa’s 
memory and enact change that will end 
violence in our military installations. 
Her story has captivated Americans 
of all backgrounds. It brought much- 
needed attention to sexual assault in 
the military, and it has led to changes 
being implemented at Fort Hood and at 
military bases throughout the Nation 
and, in fact, the world. 
I will not rest until there is justice 
for Vanessa Guillen and her family. 
There is still much work that will need 
to be done. But the naming of a post of-
fice in her memory this year of her 
first anniversary would be but a small 
gesture on the part of this Congress in 
naming a post office after her to me-
morialize her work and her legacy. 
Ms. MACE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, Houston native and 
Army Specialist Vanessa Guillen was 
stationed at Fort Hood, Texas. In April 
2020, she was reported missing from her 
unit. 
Tragically, her body was found 2 
months later along the Leon River 
near Fort Hood. It is believed Spe-
cialist Guillen was killed by a fellow 
soldier at Fort Hood who had been 
harassing her and stalking her. 
Specialist Guillen’s death spurred a 
national policy conversation about the 
way in which sexual harassment claims 
have been handled by the military. 
I strongly support this postal-naming 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. 
JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to salute this naming of a Houston 
post office after Vanessa Guillen and to 
congratulate my colleague, Congress-
woman SYLVIA
GARCIA, whose con-
stituent Vanessa was, for her leader-
ship in recognizing the importance of 
the life and legacy of Vanessa Guillen. 
She was a hero in life and a hero in 
death. 
As the story is told, all of her life she 
wanted to be in the United States 
Army, and she was an impeccable 
member of the United States military. 
Her tragic story is not one that she de-
served, the violent death, the sexual 
assault, the lack of oversight, the lack 
of knowledge and investigation and 
process that would have really saved 
her life. 
She did her duty. She made those in 
positions of power aware of the journey 
and the trials and tribulations that she 
was facing. Yet, her life was lost but 
not her legacy, not her story, and not 
the response that has come about 
through the United States Congress. 
And that will continue. 
As I heard my colleague say, she will 
not rest until Vanessa Guillen gets jus-
tice. This is one step of honor for all 
little girls to know what a brave and 
wonderful young woman she was and to 
be able to say to her family that we 
will never forget her story. 
I honor her tonight; I honor her leg-
acy; I honor her bravery; and I honor 
her story. 
What are we to say to the young girls 
who seek to be part of the United 
States military and to fight and stand 
for their country? Yes, they can model 
their lives after the service given by 
Vanessa Guillen. 
I thank her, brave that she was and, 
yes, a servant of the people of the 
United States. I thank her, and I salute 
her. 
Congratulations for this post office 
to her family and her community and 
to Congresswoman SYLVIA GARCIA. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, in the interest of 
time, I wish to be associated with the 
words of my colleagues in honor of 
Vanessa Guillen. I thank my colleague, 
SYLVIA GARCIA, for putting this impor-
tant legislation forward. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 
224, to designate the facility of the United 
States Postal Service located at 5302 Gal-
veston Road in Houston, Texas, as the 
‘‘Vanessa Guille´n Post Office Building.’’ 
Ms. Vanessa Guille´n was born to the par-
ents of immigrants and grew up in Houston, 
Texas. In high school, she was a stand-out 
athlete and graduated in the top 15 percent of 
her class. 
At a young age, Ms. Guille´n knew that she 
wanted to serve her country in the United 
States Army. In June 2018, she joined the 
Army and trained as a 91F, Small Arms and 
Artillery Repairer. Tragically at the age of 20, 
Private First Class Guille´n was killed while 
serving at Fort Hood leaving a hole in the 
hearts of her family and the community. Pri-
vate First Class Guille´n was posthumously 
promoted to the rank of Specialist on July 1, 
2020. 
I encourage all of my colleagues to join me 
in honoring the life of this young woman by 
naming the Post Office at 5302 Galveston 
Road in Houston, Texas, as the ‘‘Vanessa 
Guille´n Post Office Building.’’ 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 224. 
Mr. Speaker, if there are no further 
speakers, I am prepared to close, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. MACE. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
colleagues for giving a voice to thou-
sands of women who don’t have one 
with this postal-naming bill tonight. I 
support this bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of 
H.R. 224, and I yield back the balance 
of my time.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that all Members may have 5 
legislative days in which to revise and 
extend their remarks and include ex-
traneous material on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. FOS-
TER), the sponsor of this bill. 
Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to urge my colleagues to vote in 
favor of my legislation, H.R. 700, to 
name the Elwood, Illinois, post office 
after Larry Walsh, Sr., a public servant 
and a dedicated member of the Will 
County community. 
Mr. Walsh was raised in Joliet and 
was a graduate of Joliet Junior College 
and a lifelong resident of Elwood, Illi-
nois. Larry loved the State of Illinois 
and devoted his life to making it a bet-
ter place. 
He first began his career in public 
service as a member of the Elwood 
School Board and continued to serve 
his community as an elected Jackson 
Township supervisor, a member of the 
Will County Board, and an Illinois 
State Senator representing the 43rd 
District, a time during which he was 
widely reputed to have spent a certain 
amount of time playing poker with his 
colleague, then State Senator Barack 
Obama. 
Larry finished his career in public 
service as the Will County executive, a 
position he held from 2004 until his 
passing in 2020. 
Larry was a family man and a de-
voted farmer, a voice for disability 
issues, senior citizens services, and ag-
ricultural workers. 
He championed the largest infra-
structure improvement investment in 
Will County’s history, alongside mod-
ernizing his county’s public safety re-
sources. Simply put, Will County is a 
better place today because of the dec-
ades of work that Larry devoted to it. 
The Lawrence M. ‘‘Larry’’ Walsh Sr. 
Post Office will be a justifiable source 
of pride and a fitting tribute to a man 
who dedicated his life to local govern-
ment and his community. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote in favor of this legislation, one of 
the collegial and noble things that 
Congress can do for a collegial and 
noble man. 
Ms. MACE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, Lawrence Walsh was 
born and raised in Joliet, Illinois, 
where he later served as an Illinois 
State Senator from 1997 to 2005. He also 
served his local community as the Will 
County executive, an office he held 
from 2004 until his death in 2020. 
Mr. Speaker, I support this postal- 
naming bill honoring an Illinois com-
munity public servant, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, in the interests of 
time, I submit my statement in sup-
port of Mr. FOSTER’s very important 
bill. I strongly support it. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 
700, to designate the facility of the United 
States Postal Service located at 303 East Mis-
sissippi Avenue in Elwood, Illinois, as the 
‘‘Lawrence M. ‘Larry’ Walsh Sr. Post Office.’’ 
Mr. Larry Walsh Sr. was an American farm-
er, public servant, and dedicated member of 
the Will County community. In 1970, he began 
his career in public service as a member of 
the Elwood School Board. He was then elect-
ed as Jackson Township Supervisor in 1973, 
where he served until December 2004. Mr. 
Walsh also served on the Will County Board 
in 1974 and 1992. 
From April 1997 until January 2005, Mr. 
Walsh was an Illinois State Senator, rep-
resenting the 43rd District. As a public serv-
ant, his mission was always to better the lives 
of people who lived and worked in his commu-
nity. 
He brought a voice to disability issues, sen-
ior citizens’ services, preservation, and agri-
culture concerns. 
I encourage all of my colleagues to join me 
in commemorating Mr. Walsh’s dedication to 
public service by naming the Post Office at 
303 East Mississippi Avenue in Elwood, Illi-
nois, as the ‘‘Lawrence M. ‘Larry’ Walsh Post 
Office.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I have no further speak-
ers and I am prepared to close, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. MACE. Mr. Speaker, I support 
this bill, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of

Jacob Cruz Post Office. 
Private Jacob Cruz grew up in Boyle 
Heights and was the second born of five 
children. At the age of 17, Private Cruz 
enlisted in the Marine Corps. 
As part of the 2nd Marine Division, 
his mission was to secure the island of 
Betio in order to control the Japanese 
airstrip in the Tarawa Atoll. Trag-
ically, during the battle of Tarawa, 
Private Cruz was killed. Private Cruz 
was declared unrecoverable for 77 years 
before his remains were identified and 
returned home to his family in Los An-
geles. 
On March 25, 2021, he was then laid to 
rest with full military honors. He was 
the recipient of numerous awards and 
citations, including the Silver Star, 
Purple Heart, Combat Action Ribbon, 
World War II Victory Medal, American 
Campaign Medal, Marine Corps Presi-
dential Unit Citation, Asiatic-Pacific

Mr. Speaker, tonight, I am honored 
to speak about Private Jacob Cruz, a 
marine killed in the World War II Pa-
cific campaign. 
Private Cruz fought bravely along-
side other marines and soldiers who 
were also killed in battle. However, 
until recently, many of these American 
heroes were laid to rest abroad in un-
known or lost graves. 
In 2019, thanks in part to the Virginia 
nonprofit 
History 
Flight, 
Private 
Cruz’s remains were finally identified. 
Later in 2021, his remains were finally 
returned to the United States and re-
turned to his family members. Private 
Cruz now lies in rest here in the United 
States, the country he gave his life de-
fending. 
Today, we honor this American hero 
by renaming a U.S. Post Office in his 
honor. I support this bill, and I yield

Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Illinois 
(Mr. 
KRISHNAMOORTHI), who is the sponsor of 
this bill. 
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speak-
er, I stand in honor of veterans across 
this country, in Illinois, and, of course, 
in my Eighth District of Illinois which 
I represent. I salute veterans for their 
bravery, their courage, their sacrifice, 
and their patriotism. I wish to honor 
the men and women who take up our 
flag in service for our great Nation and 
express my immense gratitude. 
It is for this reason I have introduced 
this bill to rename the Post Office in 
Schaumburg, Illinois, in honor of the 
veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan 
Wars. Since 2001, between 2 to 3 million 
servicemembers have served in post-9/ 
11 war operations in Afghanistan and 
Iraq. 
The 
new 
name 
of 
this 
Schaumburg Post Office will be a con-
stant reminder for my community of 
the bravery of veterans from these 
wars. 
How we honor our veterans reflects 
who we are as a country. I look forward 
to passing my legislation today to re-
name this Post Office in honor of vet-
erans of the Iraq and Afghanistan 
Wars. 
Ms. MACE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, our soldiers sacrifice so 
much for our Nation. Naming a Post 
Office for those veterans who served in 
Iraq and Afghanistan is the least we 
can do to honor them. When local resi-
dents 
visit 
this 
Post 
Office 
in 
Schaumburg, Illinois, hopefully, they 
will be reminded of all the sacrifices 
made by our servicemembers in sup-
port of American freedom, democracy, 
and national security that we hold so 
dear here and around the world. 
Mr. Speaker, I support this postal- 
naming bill, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, in the interest of 
time, I associate myself with the com-
ments of my two colleagues. 
Chair MALONEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in support of H.R. 6386, to designate the facil-
ity of the United States Postal Service located 
at 
450 
West 
Schaumburg 
Road 
in 
Schaumburg, Illinois, as the ‘‘Veterans of Iraq 
and Afghanistan Memorial Post Office Build-
ing.’’ 
Our nation’s veterans do not sign up for a 
normal job. They enlist knowing full well that 
they may be injured or killed in service to our 
country. 
Over the last 20 years of conflict, more than 
2.3 million Americans served in Iraq and Af-
ghanistan. Of these service members, more 
than 6,800 were killed and tens of thousands 
more have suffered the scars and trauma— 
both seen and unseen—of serving in combat. 
It is our responsibly to remember and honor 
all of their sacrifices. 
This bill will ensure that their service is 
never forgotten. 
I encourage all of my colleagues to join me 
in honoring the brave men and women who 
sacrificed so much over the last two decades 
serving our country in Iraq and Afghanistan by 
supporting this important bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 6386. 
I congratulate Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI 
on his excellent bill. I am prepared to 
close. I have no further speakers, and I 
reserve the balance of my time.

The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that all Members may have 5 
legislative days in which to revise and 
extend their remarks and include ex-
traneous material on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 6614 to designate the facility of 
the United States Postal Service lo-
cated at 4744 Grand River Avenue in 
Detroit, Michigan, as the Rosa Louise 
McCauley Parks Post Office Building. 
Mrs. Rosa Louise McCauley Parks 
was born on February 4, 1913, in 
Tuskegee, Alabama. She attended ele-
mentary school in Pine Level, Ala-
bama, and eventually went on to at-
tend the Alabama State Teacher’s Col-
lege High School. Unfortunately, she 
was not able to graduate with her class 
due to the passing of her grandmother. 
Mrs. Parks further delayed her edu-
cation to take care of her family when 
her mother fell ill. She eventually re-
ceived her high school diploma in 1934 
after marrying Raymond Parks on De-
cember 18, 1932. 
In the 1930s, Mrs. Parks was an early 
activist in the effort to free the 
Scottsboro Boys. With her husband, 
Raymond, she worked as the secretary 
and later the youth leader of the local 
branch of the NAACP. 
Mrs. Parks’ refusal to surrender her 
seat to a White male passenger on a 
Montgomery, Alabama, bus on Decem-
ber 1, 1955, triggered a wave of protests 
that 
reverberated 
throughout 
the 
United States. Her courageous act 
changed America’s view of Black peo-
ple and redirected the course of his-
tory. 
After her arrest, Black people in 
Montgomery organized and promoted a 
boycott of the city bus line that lasted 
381 days. Inspired by the Montgomery 
protests, other actions took shape in 
the form of sit-ins and eat-ins to de-
mand equal rights for all people. 
From 1965 to 1988, Mrs. Parks worked 
for Congressman John Conyers’ staff as 
he represented what was then the First 
Congressional District of Michigan. 
In February 1987, she co-founded the 
Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for 
Self Development with Ms. Elaine 
Eason Steele in honor of her late hus-
band Raymond. The goal of the insti-
tute was to motivate and empower 
youth not targeted by other programs 
to achieve their highest potential. Mrs. 
Parks saw the energy of young people 
as a real force for change. 
Mrs. Parks received more than 43 
honorary doctorate degrees, hundreds 
of 
plaques, 
certificates, 
citations, 
awards, and keys to many cities, such 
as the NAACP Spingarn Medal, the 
UAW’s Social Justice Award, the Mar-
tin 
Luther 
King, 
Jr., 
Non-Violent 
Peace Prize, and the Congressional 
Gold Medal in 1999. 
In September of 1996, she was award-
ed the Presidential Medal of Freedom 
by President Bill Clinton. In the State 
of Michigan, the first Monday after 
February 4 has been designated as Mrs. 
Rosa Parks Day. 
On October 24, 2005, Mrs. Parks 
peacefully passed away. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to join me in honoring the life 
of this great civil rights activist by 
naming the Post Office at 4744 Grand 
River Avenue in Detroit, Michigan, as 
the Rosa Louise McCauley Parks Post 
Office Building. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. MACE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, Rosa Parks is known as 
the ‘‘Mother of the Civil Rights Move-
ment.’’ 
Her brave resistance set in motion 
one of the largest social movements in 
American history: the Montgomery 
Bus Boycott. After 381 days, the Mont-
gomery Bus Boycott ended after the 
Supreme Court held that any law re-
quiring racially segregated seating on 
buses violated the 14th Amendment. 
Because of her brave actions, Mrs. 
Parks lost her job and faced death 
threats the remainder of her life, but 
she never gave up the fight. She moved 
with her family to Detroit in 1957, 
where she continued to support the 
civil rights movement. 
Mr. Speaker, I support this postal- 
naming bill, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage 
of H.R. 6614, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. 
CAROLYN B. MALONEY) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 6614. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

May 10, 2022 
In August 2012, Private First Class 
Austin graduated basic training and 
advanced infantry training at Fort 
Leonard Wood, Missouri, as a combat 
engineer. 
Immediately following, he was sta-
tioned at Fort Stewart, Georgia, where 
he was assigned to the 4th Brigade Spe-
cial Troops Battalion, 4th Infantry Bri-
gade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Divi-
sion. He was later deployed to Afghani-
stan in 2013. 
On April 17, 2013, Private First Class 
Austin suffered massive head and chest 
trauma after an attack while driving 
an armored truck on patrol in Wardak 
Province, Afghanistan. 
On April 21, 2013, at the age of 20, Pri-
vate First Class Austin succumbed to 
his injuries in Landstuhl, Germany. 
Posthumously, he was awarded a Pur-
ple Heart, Bronze Star, Palmetto State 
Hero award, and the South Carolina 
Governor’s Award for Extraordinary 
Sacrifice and Heroism. 
I encourage all of my colleagues to 
join me in honoring the life of Private 
First Class Austin by naming the post 
office at 810 South Pendleton Street in 
Easley, South Carolina, as the Private 
First Class Barrett Lyle Austin Post 
Office Building. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. MACE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentleman from South 
Carolina (Mr. DUNCAN), the sponsor of 
this bill. 
Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 91 to honor 
Private First Class Barrett Lyle Aus-
tin, a fallen son of South Carolina who 
gave his life in service to our country, 
by designating the Easley, South Caro-
lina post office the Private First Class 
Barrett Lyle Austin Post Office Build-
ing. 
This resolution is cosponsored by the 
entire South Carolina delegation and 
supported by the city of Easley, their 
city council, as well as the family of 
Private First Class Barrett Lyle Aus-
tin, his parents, Curt and Yolanda Aus-
tin. 
Not long after he won his stripes as a 
private first class in the Army, he was 
driving an armored truck on patrol in 
the Wardak Province of Afghanistan 
when insurgents attacked. A bomb ex-
ploded, and he suffered massive head 
and chest trauma. Private First Class 
Austin died in Germany days later, on 
April 21, 2013, at the young age of 20. 
Private First Class Austin was post-
humously awarded a Purple Heart, 
Bronze Star, Palmetto State Hero 
award, and the South Carolina Gov-
ernor’s Award for Extraordinary Sac-
rifice and Heroism. 
Private First Class Austin was an 
avid sportsman, a 2011 graduate of 
Pickens High School, and a member of 
Rock 
Springs 
Baptist 
Church 
in 
Easley. 
I attended his service, and the pastor 
said he was awarded the medals post-
humously, but he was awarded the jew-
els in his crown the minute he entered 
the pearly gates. He was that kind of 
believer. 
He was an inspiration to many. He is 
an American hero and deserves to be 
honored for his bravery and sacrifice 
for our country as a soldier defending 
our freedoms and security. 
As John 15:13 says, greater love has 
no one than this, that someone lay 
down his life for his friends. Barrett did 
that. 
I thank the committee and Ranking 
Member COMER for bringing this meas-
ure to the floor and allowing us to 
honor our fallen heroes. Again, I urge 
passage of the legislation. 
Ms. MACE. Mr. Speaker, I urge my 
colleagues to support this bill honoring 
Easley, South Carolina native and 
American hero, Private First Class 
Austin. I yield back the balance of my

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support

the U.S. Postal Service located at 215 
1st Avenue in Amory, Mississippi, as 
the ‘‘Command Sergeant Major Law-
rence E. ‘Rabbit’ Kennedy Post Office 
Building.’’ 
Command Sergeant Major Lawrence 
Kennedy enlisted in the U.S. Army in 
October of 1940 by walking for 2 days 
from his hometown of Smithville to 
Tupelo. 
Over the course of his 35 years in the 
United States Army, he served in 
World War II, the Korean war, and the 
Vietnam war. 
Command Sergeant Major Kennedy 
fought in the Battle of the Bulge, par-
ticipated in 506 airborne jumps, and 
was featured on the cover of Life Maga-
zine, along with the Army’s 1st Cavalry 
9th Division. 
In 2017, Command Sergeant Major 
Kennedy was commended by the Mis-
sissippi legislature by House Concur-
rent Resolution 51, authored in honor 
of his outstanding military career. 
After serving for 35 years, he contin-
ued to serve local veterans, founding 
the annual veterans’ breakfast in part-
nership with Community Bank. 
On July 20, 2017, Command Sergeant 
Major Kennedy passed away. 
I encourage all of my colleagues to 
join me in honoring the legacy of this 
patriot by naming the post office at 215 
1st Avenue in Armory, Mississippi, as 
the ‘‘Command Sergeant Major Law-
rence E. ‘Rabbit’ Kennedy Post Office 
Building’’. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. MACE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentleman from Mis-
sissippi (Mr. KELLY), the sponsor of the 
bill. 
Mr. 
KELLY 
of 
Mississippi. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 
207, renaming the post office in Amory, 
Mississippi, for Command Sergeant 
Major Lawrence E. ‘‘Rabbit’’ Kennedy. 
Rabbit is an American hero, and I am 
proud to sponsor this legislation in his 
honor. 
Rabbit enlisted in the United States 
Army in October of 1940. To do so, he 
walked for 2 days from his hometown 
of Smithville to Tupelo. Rabbit served 
in World War II, the Korean war, and 
the Vietnam war over the course of 35 
years in the United States Army. 
There were not a lot of three-war vet-
erans in our lifetimes, and he was a 
true hero. I am proud to have known 
him personally. 
Rabbit’s accounts of World War II 
battles are features of the 2014 book 
‘‘Last Eyewitnesses, World War II 
Memories: D-Day to 70th Anniversary.’’ 
He fought in the Battle of the Bulge 
where he spent 9 days in a foxhole next 
to a dead German soldier. 
Command Sergeant Major Kennedy 
led the Army’s 1st Cavalry Division in 
Vietnam, and a photo of his leading his 
men into combat was featured on the 
cover of Life Magazine. 
During his career in the United 
States Army, Rabbit Kennedy earned 
four Legions of Merit, four Bronze 
Stars, participated in 506 airborne 
jumps, and retired as one of the most 
decorated soldiers in the history of the 
United States Army. 
In 2017, Rabbit Kennedy was com-
mended by the Mississippi legislature 
in House Concurrent Resolution 51. He 
was also the first enlisted man in-
ducted into the Hall of Fame at the 
United States Army Aviation Museum 
at Fort Rucker, Alabama. 
Rabbit Kennedy continued to serve 
local veterans throughout his life, 
which is where I met him. He never 
quit helping veterans, even after he got 
out after his 35 years of military serv-
ice. 
Rabbit Kennedy is regarded as a com-
munity leader and a true American 
hero. On July 20, 2017, he went to be 
with the Lord and will always be lo-
cally remembered as a patriot and a 
member of the Greatest Generation. 
It is a true and lasting honor to re-
member the service of Rabbit Kennedy. 
I just have to say again, he was an 
amazing man who served this country 
in three wars, but he always had time 
for everyone, and he always had time 
for a veteran in need and was always 
helping. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to 
close, and I reserve the balance of my

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that all Members may have 5 
legislative days in which to revise and 
extend their remarks and include ex-
traneous material on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 209, to designate the facility of 
the U.S. Postal Service located at 305 
Highway 15 North in Pontotoc, Mis-
sissippi, as the ‘‘Lance Corporal Marc 
Lucas Tucker Post Office Building’’. 
Lance Corporal Marc Lucas Tucker 
joined the Marine Corps at the age of 
23. He was deployed to Iraq with the 
9th Engineer Support Battalion, III 
Marine Expeditionary Force. 
Everyone in his family and commu-
nity knew that Lance Corporal Tucker 
chose a life of service, and his mother 
confirmed his commitment to the U.S. 
military, saying he was a ‘‘lifer.’’ 
On June 7, Lance Corporal Tucker 
called his mother to let her know 
about the timeline of his latest mis-
sion. Unfortunately, at 11 a.m., Ms. 
Bagwell recalls having a horrible head-
ache, which she later learned occurred 
at the time of her son’s death. 
b 2300 
I encourage all of my colleagues to 
join me in honoring the life of Lance 
Corporal Tucker by naming the post of-
fice at 305 Highway 15 North in 
Pontotoc, Mississippi, as the ‘‘Lance 
Corporal Marc Lucas Tucker Post Of-
fice Building’’. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. MACE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentleman from Mis-
sissippi (Mr. KELLY), the sponsor of the 
bill. 
Mr. 
KELLY 
of 
Mississippi. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I thank Chairwoman MALO-
NEY and Ranking Member COMER for 
bringing these very important bills to 
honor our heroes in America. I think it 
is important that we honor and remem-
ber those who served this Nation, espe-
cially those who gave their lives. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 209, renaming the post office in 
Pontotoc, Mississippi, for Lance Cor-
poral Marc Lucas Tucker. 
At age 23, Marc Lucas Tucker joined 
the Marine Corps and deployed to Iraq 
with the 9th Engineer Support Bat-
talion, 
3rd 
Marine 
Expeditionary 
Force. 
His mother, Mrs. Donna Bagwell, re-
calls her son wanting to be a marine 
from a very young age, following in the 
footsteps of his grandfather, who also 
served in the Marine Corps. 
He was a 1999 graduate of South 
Pontotoc Attendance Center, where he 
was known for his patriotism and sense 
of adventure. He was a baseball player, 
an avid hunter, and a fisherman. 
On June 8, 2005, Lance Corporal 
Tucker was killed in a vehicle accident 
while stationed in Okinawa, Japan. 
During his funeral, he was awarded 
the Navy Cross and the Mississippi 
Medal of Valor by Marine Major John 
Harding. He has also been awarded the 
Combat Action Ribbon, Good Conduct 
Medal, 
National 
Defense 
Service 
Medal, Korean Defense Service Medal, 
Humanitarian Service Medal, and Sea 
Service Medal. 
The Pontotoc community continues 
to mourn the loss of this young man 
who dedicated his life to the service of 
his country. Today I aim to honor his 
family and countless others who have 
lost their loved ones in service for our 
Nation. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, if the gentlewoman 
from South Carolina has no further 
speakers, I am prepared to close. 
Ms. MACE. Mr. Speaker, I urge the 
support of my colleagues on this bill 
honoring Lance Corporal Tucker, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of 
H.R. 209, and I yield back the balance 
of my time.

extend their remarks and include ex-
traneous material on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
I rise in support of H.R. 3508 to des-
ignate the facility of the U.S. Postal 
Service located at 39 West Main Street 
in Honeoye Falls, New York, as the 
‘‘CW4 Christian J. Koch Memorial Post 
Office’’. 
Chief Warrant Officer Koch grew up 
in the York/Leicester area and was a 
1999 graduate of York Central School 
District. Before enlisting in the Na-
tional Guard Infantry in March of 2000, 
he studied mathematics at Brockport 
State. 
He graduated second in his basic 
training class with honors and was im-
mediately awarded a slot in Airborne 
School and assigned to the A Company 
1st Battalion 108th Infantry. 
He was soon promoted to E5 and 
given a slot in Air Assault School, a 
distinct honor. In 2004, Chief Warrant 
Officer Koch was accepted into War-
rant Officer School and went on to at-
tend flight school and graduate in 2008. 
He was then deployed to Iraq during 
Operation Iraqi Freedom from 2008 to 
2009, where he flew supplies and per-
sonnel. 
Throughout his training and Active 
Duty, he served as an honor guard for 
veterans’ funerals, participated in Vet-
erans Day ceremonies, and had his unit 
featured in the Geneseo Warplane Mu-
seum. In addition, he participated in 
Operation Noble Eagle, guarding the 
northern border and the Ginna Nuclear 
Power Plant following the tragedy of 9/ 
11. 
Sadly, on January 20, 2021, Chief War-
rant Officer Koch lost his life during a 
training mission with the New York 
State National Guard. He is survived 
by his wife and four children. 
I urge all of my colleagues to join me 
in honoring Christian’s legacy by nam-
ing the post office at 39 West Main 
Street in Honeoye Falls, New York, as 
the ‘‘CW4 Christian J. Koch Memorial 
Post Office’’. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. MACE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, Christian Koch enlisted 
in the National Guard Infantry in 
March of 2000. He graduated second in 
his basic training class with honors. 
With such an excellent record, he was 
immediately awarded a slot in Air-
borne School. He was quickly promoted 
and granted a spot in Air Assault 
School, which was a unique honor. 
In 2004, he was accepted into Warrant 
Officer School at Fort Rucker, Ala-
bama. Upon completion, he then at-
tended and graduated flight school in 
2008. He was deployed to Iraq during 
Operation Iraqi Freedom, where he flew 
supplies and personnel. Later, he was 
deployed to Afghanistan as a medical 
evacuation pilot. 
He passed away in January 2021 dur-
ing a training mission, leaving behind 
his wife and their four children. 
Mr. Speaker, to honor his legacy, I 
strongly support this postal-naming 
bill, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New

No. 78 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Honorable RAPH-
AEL G. WARNOCK, a Senator from the 
State of Georgia. 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Savior, lead us today as a shepherd 
guides sheep. Direct our lives. Inspire 
our hearts. May the talents here on 
Capitol Hill help bring unity and heal-
ing to our Nation and world. 
Lord, strengthen our lawmakers as 
they deal with unsolved problems and 
urgent global needs. Prepare them for 
the challenges yet to come. Make our 
Senators eager to lift burdens and 
ready to respond in service to human-
ity. 
Help us all to feel a bit of the respon-
sibility for the challenges that hang 
heavy over our Nation and world. 
We pray in Your powerful Name. 
Amen.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The Presiding Officer led the Pledge

lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

MEASURE PLACED ON THE 
CALENDAR—S. 4164 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I un-
derstand that there is a bill at the desk 
that is due for a second reading. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will read the bill by 
title for the second time. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (S. 4164) to prohibit the expenditure 
of Federal funds for the establishment or op-
eration of the Disinformation Governance 
Board in the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, in 
order to place the bill on the calendar 
under the provisions of rule XIV, I 
would object to further proceeding. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Objection having been heard, the 
bill will now be placed on the calendar. 
f 
ABORTION 
Mr. SCHUMER. So, Mr. President, 
tomorrow, the U.S. Senate will vote to 
protect one of the most fundamental 
freedoms that women have in this 
country: the freedom to choose wheth-
er or not to have an abortion. Few de-
cisions are more personal and few deci-
sions are more private than decisions 
women make regarding their own preg-
nancies. Few should be more out of 
bounds to elected politicians and to the 
whims of government. But, sadly, few 
rights are in as much peril right now as 
the fundamental right to choose. 
If this abominable decision becomes 
law, women will lose their freedom in 
so many ways—a giant step backward 
in the United States, where expanding 
freedom has always been our goal and 
our aspiration. 
Tomorrow’s vote will be one of the 
most important votes we take in this 
Chamber in decades because, for the 
first time in 50 years, a conservative 
majority—an 
extreme 
conservative 
majority—on the Supreme Court is on 
the brink of declaring that women do 
not have a right to an abortion, they 
do not have the right to control their 
own bodies, and they do not have the 
right to healthcare in the ways that 
they believe they need. 
If that happens, tens of millions of 
women will see their freedoms contract 
in the blink of an eye. Our children will 
grow up in a world where they have 
fewer rights than their parents and 
grandparents had. America will take a 
painful and damaging step backward. 
The American people will be watch-
ing the Senate closely tomorrow, and 
they will not forget how their elected 
Senators voted. I ask my colleagues to 
think carefully about their vote, to 
grapple with the impact of a world 
without Roe because all of us will have 
to answer for this vote for the rest of 
our time in public office. 
Now, it is worth saying over and over 
again: Last week’s draft decision didn’t 
come out of nowhere; it didn’t mate-
rialize in a vacuum. On the contrary, it 
is precisely the outcome that extreme 
Republicans have been working toward 
for years. Leader MCCONNELL himself 
has admitted that this was their plan

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2386 
May 10, 2022 
all along. They have worked for years 
to confirm radical judges, plucked 
right out of the Federalist Society 
playbook, with the express goal to 
‘‘pick away at Roe v. Wade.’’ That is 
their quote. 
The radicals on the hard right have 
passed wave after wave of draconian re-
strictions at the State level, making 
abortion nearly impossible to access. 
One of those laws is about to be upheld 
by the Supreme Court of the United 
States. 
These radicals have taken what were 
once outlandish ideas, like prison time 
for women and doctors and abortion 
bans without exception for rape and in-
cest, and brought them to the fore-
front. Ideas that were radical and out 
of hand they are now talking about 
freely. Should Roe ultimately be over-
turned, many of us fear it would be just 
the start. 
Over the weekend, Leader MCCON-
NELL acknowledged where this is ulti-
mately going. Without Roe, proposals 
for a nationwide ban on abortions are 
now possible if Republicans retake the 
Senate. That is what Leader MCCON-
NELL said this weekend. That is right— 
a national ban on abortion. Not very 
long ago, the idea seemed to belong on 
the extreme of the extremes. Now the 
Republican leader himself acknowl-
edges this is on the table—just a glar-
ing indication of how radicalized the 
Republican Party has become in recent 
decades as the MAGA wing has all but 
completed its cancerous takeover. 
All the times that Republicans dis-
guised their hostility to Roe as a mat-
ter of ‘‘States’ rights’’ have been ex-
posed for what they are: hypocrisy, a 
smokescreen hiding the real objective. 
It is one of the oldest, most sinister ar-
guments Republicans have used for 
decades. For MAGA Republicans, this 
has never been about States’ rights; it 
has always been about getting rid of 
abortion altogether. 
The hypocrisies run deeper still. It is 
worth noting that the very same party 
that spent years opposing healthcare 
by saying that ‘‘the American people 
want healthcare decisions left up to 
families and doctors’’—that is what 
they said as they opposed ACA year 
after year. They said, again, the Amer-
ican people want healthcare decisions 
left up to their families and doctors 
when it came to ACA. They are now 
the very same radicals who are telling 
Americans: No, it is not up to your 
family and your doctor; it is your body, 
our choice—the radical right’s choice, 
the choice of five men on the Supreme 
Court who are extreme. 
Now, many on the other side can’t 
even bring themselves to own the hor-
rors they have unleashed. They are try-
ing to convince people they are not ex-
treme, but the truth is that the MAGA 
wing of the Republican Party is run-
ning the show, and their actions prove 
how extreme they are. 
Senate Republicans have spent a full 
week trying to change the subject to 
anything but Roe because they know 
how toxic this issue has become for 
them. The Republican leader tried to 
say, in vain, that the real story of the 
draft decision was not the end of Roe 
but the source of the leaked draft? Tell 
that to 100 million Americans who will 
lose their most personal of rights. I am 
sure they don’t care as much about the 
leaked draft as about how they can 
control their own bodies. 
The chair of the Republican cam-
paign arm, Senator SCOTT, released 
laughable talking points saying Repub-
licans, of course, don’t want to im-
prison doctors, even though his allies, 
his fellow MAGA Republicans, are 
pushing for exactly that at the State 
level. It would all be farcical if it 
wasn’t so bone-chilling and the con-
sequences were not so serious. 
Senate Republicans can try to run 
from their role in securing Roe’s ex-
tinction, but sooner or later, the truth 
wins out. Without the actions they 
have taken for years, reproductive 
rights wouldn’t be staring straight into 
a doomsday scenario. 
So, tomorrow, the vote to protect 
abortion rights will shine like a flood-
light on every Member of this Cham-
ber. Republicans who pretended dis-
ingenuously as if this moment couldn’t 
possibly happen will have to answer to 
the women of America whose rights are 
about to be turned back by decades. 
Tomorrow, there will be no more hid-
ing; there will be no more distracting, 
no more obfuscating where every Mem-
ber in this Chamber stands. Senate Re-
publicans will face a choice: Either 
vote to protect the rights of women to 
exercise freedom over their own bodies 
or stand with the Supreme Court as 50 
years of women’s rights are reduced to 
rubble before our very eyes. The vote 
tomorrow will tell. 
f 
UKRAINE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now 
on Ukraine, later today, the House is 
set to vote on nearly $40 billion in 
emergency aid to help Ukraine as the 
Ukrainians continue to fight back 
quite successfully against Russian ag-
gression. This is a large package, but 
the need is great, and time is of the es-
sence. After the House passes the legis-
lation, it is my intention for the Sen-
ate to act on it as soon as we can. The 
President has called on both Chambers 
of Congress to act quickly on the 
Ukrainian aid package, so act quickly 
we must. 
The Ukrainian Ambassador will be 
visiting us at our caucus lunch this 
afternoon to discuss the upcoming 
package, and she will let us know how 
important it is to quickly approve it. 
Quickly 
approving 
this 
emergency 
funding is essential to helping the peo-
ple of Ukraine in their fight against 
the vicious Putin. It will mean more 
funding to provide Javelins, Stingers, 
Howitzers, Switchblade unmanned aer-
ial munitions, and other critical equip-
ment. And it will mean more food, sup-
plies, and shelter for the millions of 
Ukrainian refugees who are in the 
midst of the largest refugee crisis since 
the Second World War. 
We have a moral obligation to stand 
with our friends in Ukraine. The fight 
they are in is a struggle between de-
mocracy and authoritarianism itself, 
and we dare not relent or delay swift 
action to help our friends in need. 
And make no mistake, the Senate 
will move swiftly to get an emergency 
funding package passed and sent to the 
President’s desk. 
I yield the floor.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican leader is recog-
nized. 
f 
INFLATION 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, this 
all-Democratic government has man-
aged a unique kind of economic turn-
around. They took an economy that 
was ready to soar, turned it around, 
and drove it into the ground. American 
families are being crushed by 8.5 per-
cent 
inflation. 
Democrats’ 
policies 
have unleashed the worst inflation in 
more than 40 years. 
Last March, the Senate Democratic 
leader said: 
I do not think the dangers of inflation . . . 
are very real. 
At that time, the most recent infla-
tion figure was 1.7 percent. Inflation 
has more than quadrupled since Leader 
SCHUMER said he wasn’t worried. 
Now, remember, the same Democrats 
predicted the Republicans’ 2017 tax re-
form bill would harm the economy and 
hurt working people. Instead, what it 
produced is the best economic moment 
for American workers in modern his-
tory. Falling unemployment, low infla-
tion, and wages grew faster for the bot-
tom 25 percent of earners than for the 
top. 
So Democrats’ worldview has been 
proven 
absolutely 
wrong. 
But, 
of 
course, last year, they put it into ac-
tion anyway. Democrats dumped $2 
trillion on a recovering economy and 
paid people a bonus to stay home from 
work, even after vaccines were avail-
able, and the American people are 
hurting as a result. 
American 
workers’ 
real 
average 
weekly earnings declined 3.6 percent 
over the last year. Inflation has more 
than wiped out the average worker’s 
wage gains. President Biden has hand-
ed the average American a big pay 
cut—a pay cut. 
The cost of the essentials that fami-
lies need have been skyrocketing. Gas 
prices are now the highest they have 
ever been in American history—ever. 
Americans are now paying roughly 
$4.40 per gallon. That is up about 2 
whole dollars from when President 
Biden put his hand on the Bible. Gro-
cery prices have shot up 10 percent

over the past year. Housing costs are 
up more than 6 percent. Clothing is up 
nearly 7 percent. Each category is the 
worst it has been since at least the 
early 1980s. 
Remember, if and when the inflation 
rate begins to gradually slow, that does 
not mean all of these sky-high prices 
for goods and services will actually fall 
back down. In many cases, this painful 
and preventable inflation will be baked 
into prices going forward. These Demo-
cratic price hikes will likely be Amer-
ican families’ new normal at the 
checkout counter, a permanent—per-
manent—direct result of their failed 
policies. 
f 
NOMINATIONS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, now 
on a different matter, this week, our 
colleagues want a second run on some 
controversial nominees who stalled out 
last month. 
Today, Senate Democrats will try 
again to confirm Professor Lisa Cook 
to the Federal Reserve Board. Pro-
fessor Cook has no proven expertise in 
monetary economics at all, much less 
fighting inflation. One of her main sup-
posed qualifications for this position is 
that she sits on the regional Fed Board 
in Chicago. The problem is, she was lit-
erally appointed to that position a few 
days before she was nominated for this 
one. 
Professor Cook is a proven partisan 
who has promoted leftwing conspiracy 
theories and called for a fellow aca-
demic to be fired because that person 
did not support defunding the police. 
The American people deserve an inde-
pendent, nonpartisan inflation fighter 
for this important post. 
Likewise, the Federal Trade Commis-
sion is an important Agency that gets 
wide latitude to oversee our private 
sector. The American people need its 
Commissioners to be levelheaded ex-
perts who will put aside ideological ax- 
grinding. 
The two current Commissioners who 
were appointed by a Republican Presi-
dent 
were 
so 
qualified 
and 
uncontroversial, the Senate approved 
each of them on a voice vote. But to 
serve as their newest colleague, Presi-
dent Biden has picked a radical par-
tisan named Alvaro Bedoya. 
Mr. Bedoya is such a poor fit that the 
first time Leader SCHUMER
tried to 
shut down debate on his nomination, 
he lacked the votes and had to call it 
off. But Democrats want this hardcore 
partisan confirmed very badly, so here 
we are once again. 
Mr. Bedoya has publicly attacked po-
lice and law enforcement and de-
manded that our country not enforce— 
not enforce—our immigration laws. He 
has called for States to essentially nul-
lify Federal immigration law, saying: 
Maryland police have no business working 
with ICE [and] I think it’s high time that 
state legislators understand that they can do 
something about this. 
He has volunteered statements that 
align with ‘‘defund the police,’’ de-
manding that none of the Democrats’ 
trillions in stimulus waste should go to 
provide for law enforcement. 
Mr. Bedoya’s social media feeds have 
read like the rantings of a far-left ac-
tivist with no aspiration to ever re-
ceive Senate confirmation. 
He has embraced socialized medicine, 
critical race theory, and cracking down 
on citizens’ Second Amendment rights. 
He has launched political attacks on 
current Senators and called the Na-
tional Republican Party Convention 
a—listen to this—‘‘White supremacist 
rally’’—a ‘‘White supremacist rally,’’ 
the Republican National Convention. 
The rabid partisanship is not just an 
extracurricular activity. We know Mr. 
Bedoya would apply it specifically to 
the work of the FTC. He is already on 
the record calling for the elimination 
of longstanding bipartisan FTC policy 
statements. He supports excluding mi-
nority party Commissioners from in-
vestigations. 
This nominee would not be fit to neu-
trally oversee major economic deci-
sions, no matter what the makeup of 
the Senate was. But he is an essen-
tially foolish choice—foolish—when the 
American people handed this adminis-
tration a 50–50 Senate. 
I would urge my colleagues on both 
sides to stop this awful nomination so 
the President can reconsider and send 
us somebody suitable.

EXECUTIVE SESSION 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Under the previous order, the 
Senate will proceed to executive ses-
sion to resume consideration of the fol-
lowing nomination, which the clerk 
will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read the nomination of Ann Claire 
Phillips, of Virginia, to be Adminis-
trator of the Maritime Administration. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I suggest the ab-
sence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
UKRAINE 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, for more 
than 70 days now, the Ukrainian people 
have endured—and more than endured, 
they fought back. They stood up to 
their invaders and have achieved amaz-
ing things against a superior force—su-
perior, at least, on paper. 
Many feared that Russia would crush 
Ukraine in days. Instead, Ukraine has 
not only withstood Russian aggression 
but has inflicted humiliating defeats 
on 
Russia. 
Twelve—twelve—Russian 
generals have reportedly been killed. 
Russia lost thousands of its troops, as 
well as hundreds of tanks and scores of 
aircraft. One estimate from British in-
telligence suggests that Russia may 
have lost more than a quarter of its 
ground combat strength. 
Ukrainians successfully pushed Rus-
sia out of the Kyiv suburbs, have re-
taken territory outside of Kharkiv, and 
still—still—maintain a defiant hold on 
the steel plant in Mariupol despite 
being encircled by Russian troops. 
At the same time we recognize 
Ukraine’s successes and the fierce de-
termination that has made them pos-
sible, it is also important to remember 
the devastation this war has inflicted. 
Thousands of Ukrainian civilians have 
been killed. Somewhere around 12 mil-
lion Ukrainians have fled their homes. 
And the list of Russian atrocities gets 
longer every day—schools and hos-
pitals intentionally bombed, execu-
tions and mass graves, torture, rape, 
the deliberate targeting of civilians, 
apparent war crimes. 
In a few short weeks, Russia has 
brought unimaginable devastation. The 
port city of Mariupol—once home to 
more than 400,000 people—has been re-
duced to rubble. The city essentially no 
longer exists. Across Ukraine, an un-
told number of homes and buildings 
have been destroyed. It will take years 
to rebuild or remove the imprint of 
Russian aggression from the landscape, 
and some things cannot be entirely re-
covered. Just last night, Russia inten-
tionally struck civilian centers in 
Odessa, bombing a shopping mall and a 
consumer warehouse without regard 
for innocent human life. 
The Ukrainian people have displayed 
an incredible gallantry and resolve. 
They have embraced this fight and the 
cause of their country’s freedom. They 
have not spent any time waiting 
around for anyone else to come and 
save them. In fact, a recent news story 
highlighted the fact that Ukrainians 
not only continue to oppose the Rus-
sians, they have actually started re-
building in places even as the war con-
tinues to rage. 
But it is also important to remember 
that the Ukrainian people cannot sus-
tain this war without military support 
from the United States and other free 
countries. The weapons and military 
resources we have supplied are playing 
a crucial role in enabling Ukraine to 
continue standing up to Russian ag-
gression, and it is essential that we 
continue that support for as long as the 
Ukrainian people need it. 
At the end of April, the President 
sent Congress a request for $33 billion 
in emergency supplemental funding for 
critical security and economic assist-
ance to Ukraine. Negotiations are on-
going about how we iron out a few mat-
ters.

change, but I hope Congress can act 
quickly to get Ukraine the military 
equipment it needs, as well as humani-
tarian support to help the millions of 
Ukrainians who have been displaced. 
We also need to make sure that our Eu-
ropean partners are making similar 
contributions to help put President 
Zelenskyy in the strongest possible po-
sition to bring this war to an end. It 
would be a tragedy for Ukraine to have 
bought all this time with our help only 
to lose the initiative now. 
So I hope that we can get this fund-
ing out the door as quickly as possible 
and that Democrats will not slow 
things down by attaching extraneous 
funding requests for unrelated policy 
riders. Thirty-three billion dollars is a 
substantial sum of money, but, as the 
news reports showing Ukrainian high-
ways dotted with bombed-out Russian 
tanks attest, Ukraine is putting our 
military aid to good use. 
The cost of inaction on our part—of 
allowing Vladimir Putin to destroy 
Ukraine and threaten NATO—would be 
much greater. We should not be so 
naive as to think that Putin’s cam-
paign of Soviet expansion will end with 
Ukraine. There are rightfully concerns 
that he will seek to escalate into 
former Soviet countries in Eastern Eu-
rope or even further. He has already 
hinted at a willingness to use nuclear 
weapons, and he proved in Syria that 
he is certainly OK with the use of 
chemical weapons. 
I hope defenders of the Iran nuclear 
deal are making note of what nuclear 
power looks like in the hands of a na-
tion with a malign agenda. 
We cannot allow Putin to think that 
he can pursue his expansionist dreams 
unopposed. 
The United States and all NATO 
members must remain committed to 
our shared defense and to supporting 
Ukraine in its fight for freedom. NATO 
countries should also preserve our 
open-door policy to nations that are 
seeking to contribute to the collective 
security of the alliance. There can 
never be too many allies in the quest 
to preserve peace and maintain a 
strong defense against tyranny, and we 
should welcome any nation that seeks 
to help further those goals. 
Currently, Russia’s main areas of 
control span from east of Kharkiv to 
previously 
contested 
parts 
of 
the 
Donbas and now along the coast of the 
Sea of Azov and past Crimea in an at-
tempt to fully block Ukraine’s access 
to the Black Sea. Russia has failed to 
capture Kyiv or break the resolve of 
the Ukrainian people, so now Putin 
wants to close Ukraine off from the 
world, which will harm not only 
Ukrainians but also Ukraine’s trading 
partners that rely on Ukraine’s sub-
stantial agricultural capacity. 
Ukraine is a major exporter of wheat, 
corn, and sunflower oil. If Ukraine’s 
ability to produce and export these 
products is compromised, which is al-
ready happening, we are likely to see 
not only price hikes but very serious 
food shortages as a result. 
The World Food Programme reports 
that an additional 47 million people 
around the world could be facing acute 
hunger if the war in Ukraine continues. 
In a world in which hunger persists and 
famine looms, Putin’s war of aggres-
sion in Ukraine threatens to cause cas-
ualties far beyond Ukraine’s borders, 
which brings us back once again to the 
importance of supporting the Ukrain-
ian people and their fight. 
As President Zelenskyy said the 
other day in reference to the United 
States and Ukraine, we defend common 
values, democracy, and freedom. We 
do, indeed, Mr. President. We do, in-
deed. 
The Ukrainian people are currently 
giving their all to secure a future of de-
mocracy and freedom in Ukraine. Let’s 
continue to make it clear that they are 
not alone in that fight, and let’s make 
sure they have the tools they need to 
win this war and secure Ukraine’s free-
dom permanently. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Illinois. 
ROE V. WADE 
Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. President, my 
older daughter, Abigail—named for 
Abigail Adams, who urged her husband 
to ‘‘remember the ladies’’—is 7. She is 
generous, silly, and so, so smart. She 
calls herself a maker-kid and dreams of 
being an engineer or an army nurse but 
definitely not a helicopter pilot. 
My younger daughter, Maile, just 
turned 4. Her laugh is contagious, and 
early on during the pandemic when I 
was mostly working from home, she 
proved that she was truly her mother’s 
daughter by starting to pull pranks, in-
cluding 
grabbing 
my 
phone 
and, 
oopsies, hanging up on whoever was on 
the other line when I was trying to 
conduct a Zoom meeting or review 
some legislation instead of playing 
with her. But Abigail and Maile might 
not be here today if it weren’t for the 
basic reproductive rights Americans 
have relied on for nearly 50 years. 
When Roe was decided in 1973, it 
changed the lives of so many women. 
It saved the lives of 14-year-olds who 
were the victims of rape or incest, who 
otherwise would have had to turn to 
back alleys and back rooms. 
It changed the lives of women who 
desperately wanted to be moms but 
who 
found 
out 
their 
pregnancies 
weren’t viable. They would have to go 
through the pain and suffering and 
trauma of a full term, only to stillborn 
at the end of 9 months. 
Personally, for me, it gave me my 
chance to be a mom, for I never would 
have had my creative, silly, drive-me- 
crazy-yet-love-them-infinitely 
two 
daughters if Roe hadn’t paved the way 
for 
women 
to 
make 
their 
own 
healthcare decisions, as I was only able 
to get pregnant through IVF, a fer-
tility process that Roe lays the founda-
tion for. 
Because of IVF, I got to experience 
all the joys of motherhood. Because of 
reproductive rights, my husband and I 
aren’t just ‘‘Tammy and Bryan,’’ we 
are ‘‘Mommy and Daddy.’’ 
Because of Roe and the rights and 
laws it protects, we are a family. Yet, 
last week, we learned that the Supreme 
Court could be just weeks away from 
overturning Roe v. Wade and Planned 
Parenthood v. Casey, a decision that, if 
made final, would strip away reproduc-
tive rights for millions of women, forc-
ing them to potentially live through 
the horrors and indignities that their 
grandmothers bore if they needed re-
productive care, and this would just be 
the start. 
For while the anti-choice movement 
has been working for years—decades— 
to get to this moment, overturning Roe 
is not their end goal. They want a na-
tional ban on abortion, something the 
Republican Senate Leader said was a 
possibility just last week. 
They want to undermine access to 
contraception. In some States, legisla-
tion has already been introduced that 
would make IVF a crime. In Oklahoma, 
one woman was even convicted of man-
slaughter for having a miscarriage—a 
miscarriage. Criminalized for having a 
miscarriage. I have had a miscarriage, 
and there are no words to describe 
what mothers feel in that moment. For 
me, I was overcome with the rawest, 
most painful emotion I had ever experi-
enced. 
In that moment, losing my baby felt 
more searing than anything I had ever 
felt in my entire life. Yet if the GOP 
has its way, women may now have to 
live in fear that that worst moment of 
their lives may also send them to pris-
on. And if extremists get what they are 
seeking, doctors who perform proce-
dures, such as dilation and curettage, 
to help grieving families who have lost 
a pregnancy might be at risk of going 
to jail too. Doctors like the one who 
after my own miscarriage conducted 
the D&C to clear out my uterus that 
allowed me to immediately continue 
my dream of having a baby via IVF, 
my desperately wished for second child, 
my beautiful rainbow baby, Maile. 
So let’s be honest, what is happening 
is not about protecting life. If the anti- 
choice movement truly wanted to pro-
tect life, they would stop trying to 
strip 
away 
Americans’ 
healthcare. 
They would be putting all of their ef-
forts into addressing the growing ma-
ternal mortality crisis that has taken 
a tragic number of Black mothers’ 
lives. 
They would be pushing for des-
perately needed policies that support 
parents, like affordable childcare and 
paid parental leave. If Republicans ac-
tually cared about being pro-life, they 
would 
do 
something, 
anything, 
to 
stand up to the National Rifle Associa-
tion. 
So, no, this isn’t about saving lives. 
This isn’t about looking out for fami-
lies. It is about getting a slap on the 
back from their base and exerting even 
more control over women’s bodies. It is 
about deepening divides between the 
haves and the have-nots. It is about

making it even harder to undo cen-
turies of harm unleashed by systemic 
racism and economic injustice, sys-
tems under which women of color have 
suffered the most. Look, I know that a 
lot of us are tired from the seemingly 
endless fight to protect our most basic 
human rights, but we can do more. We 
have to do more. We must. 
Congress itself has the power. We 
have the ability to vote tomorrow to 
pass the Women’s Health Protection 
Act, which would codify Roe v. Wade 
once and for all because, let me be 
clear, women seeking care should not 
be ashamed. The people who should feel 
shame are those forcing these women 
to live through unnecessary pain and 
suffering. The people who should feel 
shame are those who claim to be pro- 
life, yet would let a mother die in 
childbirth for an unviable pregnancy, 
who refuse to expand Medicaid, who be-
lieve guns should be easy to get but 
basic healthcare impossible to find. 
These are the people who should be 
ashamed. These are the people who 
have no shame. And I will be damned if 
I let my daughters grow up in a coun-
try that gives them fewer rights than 
their mom had. 
So here I am today fighting for to-
morrow that doesn’t look like our yes-
terday because in that yesterday, those 
of us with uteruses were treated as sec-
ond-class citizens. And I didn’t learn to 
fly Black Hawk helicopters, go to war 
for this Nation, nearly lose my life 
fighting for the rights enshrined in 
that Constitution I protected, only to 
come back home and have those same 
rights stripped away from the next 
generation of girls who simply want to 
be able to follow their own dreams, like 
I did mine. 
To me, it comes down to this: Women 
should 
be 
allowed 
to 
make 
their 
healthcare decisions without MITCH 
MCCONNELL’s 
voice 
or 
Brett 
Kavanaugh’s face haunting them at 
their OB/GYN appointment. So shame 
on those who want to take us back to 
the pre-Roe back alleys. Shame on 
those who don’t dare regulate guns but 
want to regulate our uteruses. 
I will fight with everything I have 
got to keep us out of those back alleys 
because it is the least that the women 
who came before us and fought for 
these rights deserve, and it is the least 
that our own daughters need. So 
enough of the hypocrisy, enough of the 
misogyny, enough of some men in hal-
lowed halls of DC arguing that they 
know better than women in Illinois or 
Arizona or Missouri. We can and we 
must do better. That means proving 
that we care about women every day of 
the year, not just on one Sunday in 
May. That means codifying Roe now. 
Let’s vote. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PADILLA). The Senator from Texas. 
ABORTION 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, over the 
last several days, the radical left has 
taken the debate about abortion to 
dangerous ends. 
Last week, a liberal group launched 
an intimidation campaign against six 
members of the Supreme Court. They 
posted a map online with their home 
addresses and encouraged protesters to 
take their complaints straight to the 
Justices’ doorsteps. No surprise as 
swarms of protesters heeded their call. 
They showed up at some of the Jus-
tices’ homes this weekend. 
Even though this plan was in the 
works for several days, the White 
House remained silent and refused to 
condemn this clearcut example of 
doxing. 
It wasn’t until yesterday morning, 
once the weekend’s protest had con-
cluded, that the White House Press 
Secretary said the Justices should be 
able to do their jobs without fearing 
for their personal safety or the safety 
of their families. And that wasn’t the 
only alarming update from the week-
end. 
A pro-life group in Wisconsin was 
vandalized and set on fire on Sunday 
morning. The person or persons respon-
sible smashed windows and attempted 
to use a Molotov cocktail. They left 
graffiti on the exterior wall of the 
building that read, ‘‘If abortions aren’t 
safe, then you aren’t either.’’ 
Threats of violence are never accept-
able. It doesn’t matter who is making 
the threat or who is on the receiving 
end. There is a world of difference be-
tween legitimate public discourse pro-
tected under the First Amendment to 
the United States Constitution and 
threats or acts of violence which are 
not. 
Every single person in this Chamber, 
especially our Democratic colleagues, 
should affirm that any demonstrations 
about this heated issue cannot threat-
en the safety of anyone, Supreme Court 
Justices, pro-life advocates, or other-
wise. 
This past weekend’s events have 
highlighted the need to better protect 
the Justices and their families. They 
deserve the protection that, at this mo-
ment, the Supreme Court Police are 
not able to provide. Last week, Senator 
COONS, the Senator from Delaware, and 
I introduced a bill to increase protec-
tion for all nine Justices and their fam-
ilies. This basically would be the same 
sort of authorities given to the Capitol 
Police in protecting Members of Con-
gress. 
The events of this weekend have un-
derscored just how important this is. 
This legislation was at the request of 
the Chief Justice, who wants to ensure 
that members of the Court and their 
families have the security and protec-
tion they need, especially at this tense 
time when Justices are facing en-
hanced threats. 
We currently have two Justices with 
school-age children, and in the coming 
months, that number will increase to 
three once Judge Jackson takes her 
place on the Supreme Court Bench. I 
am glad this bill passed the Senate last 
night, and I hope our colleagues in the 
House will take it up and pass it in the 
coming days. 
This week, the issue at the center of 
this turmoil will be a topic of debate 
here in the U.S. Senate. The Demo-
cratic leader has promised that the 
Senate will vote on a radical abortion 
bill that goes far, far beyond codifying 
Roe v. Wade. 
This radical pro-abortion bill that 
Senator SCHUMER has set for a vote on 
tomorrow allows for abortions at any 
point during a woman’s pregnancy, up 
until the time of delivery. 
It does this by prohibiting States 
from protecting an unborn child’s right 
to life as long as one healthcare pro-
vider signs off that a pregnancy would 
pose a risk to the woman’s physical or 
mental health. 
It isn’t hard to see that this is a 
blank check for abortion providers like 
Kermit Gosnell. You may remember 
that Dr. Gosnell was a physician in 
Philadelphia, PA, who ran something 
called the Women’s Medical Society 
Clinic but which was dubbed a ‘‘house 
of horrors’’ during his subsequent trial. 
He was also a prolific prescriber of 
OxyContin, but in 2011 Dr. Gosnell and 
his wife Pearl and eight employees 
were charged with a total of 32 felonies 
and 227 misdemeanors in connection 
with the deaths, illegal medical serv-
ices, and regulatory violations at his 
abortion clinic. 
Pearl and the eight employees plead-
ed guilty to various charges in 2011, 
while Dr. Gosnell pleaded not guilty 
and sought a jury trial. After that 
trial, Dr. Gosnell was convicted of 
first-degree murder in the deaths of 
three infants and involuntary man-
slaughter in the death of Karnamaya 
Mongar, an adult patient at the clinic 
following an abortion procedure. 
Gosnell was also convicted of 21 fel-
ony counts of illegal late-term abor-
tions and 211 counts of violating Penn-
sylvania’s 24-hour informed consent 
law. 
After his conviction, Gosnell waived 
his right to appeal, and in an exchange 
for an agreement from prosecutors not 
to seek the death penalty, he was sen-
tenced to life in prison without parole. 
Not only does the radical abortion 
bill that Senator SCHUMER has teed up 
a vote on tomorrow usurp the constitu-
tional role reserved to the States, it 
would allow a child born after 21 weeks 
of gestation to be aborted. Next month, 
a baby who was born at 21 weeks and 2 
days will celebrate his second birthday. 
But this extreme legislation would in-
validate all State laws that limit abor-
tions after 20 weeks of gestation. 
This wouldn’t just impact pro-life red 
States; this change is so radical that it 
would invalidate existing laws in blue 
States as well. In Massachusetts and 
Nevada, for example, abortions are re-
stricted after 24 weeks. In California, 
Washington, and Illinois, abortions are 
restricted after viability. 
If this legislation were to become 
law, those laws would be preempted 
under the supremacy clause of the Fed-
eral Constitution. 
Now, this sort of radical lurch and 
knee-jerk reaction to a draft opinion

May 10, 2022 
illegally leaked by somebody at the 
Supreme Court—this reaction is way 
out of step with the views of most 
Americans when it comes to the sen-
sitive and emotional issue of abortion. 
A poll last summer found that 65 per-
cent of Americans believe abortion 
should be illegal in the second tri-
mester. Opposition to third trimester 
abortion is even stronger—an over-
whelming 80 percent of Americans are 
opposed to late third trimester term 
abortions. 
But under this legislation, States 
would have no power to stop the rad-
ical procedure known as partial birth 
abortion as long as one provider signed 
off that the mother’s mental health 
might be affected. 
What that is, is not defined and is 
left to the imagination. But just when 
you think it is bad, it gets worse. This 
bill would also invalidate laws that 
prevent abortion from being used as a 
method of sex selection. In other 
words, this legislation allows a parent 
who is hoping for a son to abort a baby 
girl. 
This is a type of practice that sadly 
became common in China during the 
era of the one-child policy. It is not 
something 
that 
should 
happen 
in 
America. 
Not only that, this bill undermines 
State efforts to protect unborn babies 
with disabilities, like Down syndrome. 
Unborn children being killed based 
solely on gender or disabilities is a dev-
astating problem in other countries. 
We cannot allow such grotesque prac-
tices to become mainstream here in 
America. America is better than that. 
This bill that the majority leader has 
teed up a vote on tomorrow would also 
invalidate conscience laws, which pro-
tect healthcare providers who have 
deeply held objections to abortion. 
Conscience laws are extremely com-
mon—46 
States 
allow 
individual 
healthcare providers to refuse to pro-
vide abortion services. 
This law that we will be voting on to-
morrow would wipe away all of those 
existing State laws. Any healthcare 
provider who had a deeply held reli-
gious or moral objection to abortion 
would be required by Federal law to 
provide them anyway. Any healthcare 
provider who refused to do so could 
find themselves on the receiving end of 
a lawsuit. 
This radical pro-abortion legislation 
removes a range of commonsense pro-
tections that exist in States across the 
country. It does away with State laws 
that limit the performance of abortions 
to licensed physicians, meaning non-
physicians could perform and prescribe 
abortions; and it provides no protec-
tion for babies who survive a botched 
abortion. 
It invalidates informed consent laws, 
which require healthcare providers to 
share information about the baby with 
the mother, such as whether the child 
is capable of feeling pain. 
And it gives the Attorney General of 
the United States sweeping authority 
to block State laws protecting the 
right to life. 
This legislation would overturn ex-
isting laws and allow abortions on a 
scale our country has never seen be-
fore. 
It is a sad commentary on the con-
science of America when all but a 
handful of our Democratic colleagues 
are fighting to implement these radical 
policies. 
As it stands today, the United States 
is only one of a handful of countries 
that allows elective abortions after 20 
weeks. Other countries on that list of 
seven include the People’s Republic of 
China, ruled by the Chinese Communist 
Party, and North Korea. 
This should be a massive red flag for 
our colleagues across the aisle that our 
compassion for the unborn ranks right 
up there with the People’s Republic of 
China and North Korea; but, unfortu-
nately, they don’t see the inherent hu-
manity of these lost innocent lives. 
The extent to which the Democratic 
Party continues to embrace such rad-
ical policies never ceases to amaze me. 
As shocking as this legislation is, it 
is not entirely new. It already failed to 
pass the Senate once this year. It 
couldn’t even earn the support of all 50 
Democratic Senators. It failed on a 46– 
48 line vote. Democrats haven’t made 
any changes that will move the needle 
in their direction in this bill that we 
will vote on tomorrow. 
I simply do not agree that the Amer-
ican people want abortion laws in our 
country that put us on par with the 
Chinese Communist Party and North 
Korea—two of the world’s most aggres-
sive human rights abusers. 
America cannot be its best if we do 
not value the lives of our most vulner-
able. I believe babies—fellow human 
beings with heartbeats, fingerprints, 
just like the rest of us—deserve to have 
protection under the law—under State 
laws that would, if in the event Roe 
were overturned, be the ultimate arbi-
ter of what the laws would be in those 
individual States. 
The 
Declaration 
of 
Independence 
itself guarantees the right to life, lib-
erty, and the pursuit of happiness, and 
I believe that right to life extends to 
the unborn, just as it does to every 
other American. 
I have always believed in defending 
the right of the unborn to life, liberty 
and the pursuit of happiness, and I will 
continue to fight this bill, no matter 
how many times the majority leader 
brings it to the floor. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, last 
week, Americans woke up to the news 
that was perhaps not unexpected but 
still stunning. 
It appears that in a matter of weeks, 
we may soon live in a country where 
women 
have 
fewer 
constitutional 
rights than their parents or grand-
parents. 
In one bold move, the ultraconserva-
tive, activist majority on the Supreme 
Court appears poised to erase the con-
stitutional right to choose whether or 
not to carry a pregnancy to term. 
I want to be clear: The leak of the 
majority draft opinion in Dobbs v. 
Jackson Women’s Health Organization 
is an unprecedented breach of the 
Court’s confidential deliberations. It 
may harm the trust the Justices have 
with one another, as well as the 
public’s trust in the Court. 
Still, one must wonder, Why is it 
that our Republican colleagues have 
been focused so exclusively on the leak 
of the draft opinion rather than the 
substance of the opinion itself? And 
why do we hear in the last few days a 
continued reference to the security of 
Supreme Court Justices without a real 
discussion of where the proposed opin-
ion will take us? 
Let’s make it clear—unequivocally 
clear—in a bipartisan fashion: Violence 
is never acceptable. Violence is never 
acceptable against Supreme Court Jus-
tices, their families, their staff, or any-
one associated with that branch of gov-
ernment. 
Nor is violence acceptable on Janu-
ary 6, 2021, in this Chamber, when the 
mob—the insurrectionist mob—leaving 
a Trump rally came here and tried to 
stop the business of the U.S. Senate 
and the House of Representatives, and 
we left as fast as we could move out 
the back door to try to escape that. 
That was violence which led to five 
deaths and the assaults on 150 members 
of law enforcement. That violence is 
unacceptable as well, and I hope my 
friends on the other side of the aisle, 
who vetoed an effort for a bipartisan 
commission to investigate the violence 
of January 6, will step up now and say 
they were wrong. 
Violence against a Supreme Court 
Justice, violence against a Member of 
the House, and a Member of the Sen-
ate—none of those is acceptable, pe-
riod. Unequivocally. Period. 
I am in favor of protecting the Jus-
tices, of course. I have been party to ef-
forts in my home State of Illinois, 
after a tragic incident over 10 years 
ago, when a disgruntled client ended up 
killing a Federal judge’s mother and 
husband in their home. 
Since then, I have called for more se-
curity, and I am glad to add my name 
to this effort now to provide security 
to this Court and all the members of 
the Court, their families, and the staff 
who are involved. 
It is unacceptable. Violence, either in 
this building or across the street, is un-
acceptable. 
But I would like to speak as well to 
the substance of the statement just 
made by the Senator from Texas. 
He recalled the case of Kermit 
Gosnell, a case where a doctor in Phila-
delphia was convicted, virtually of in-
fanticide—repeated 
cases 
of 
infan-
ticide—and he was sentenced, ulti-
mately, to life in prison, where he still 
spends his time serving that out, with 
no chance of parole, nor should he ever 
have a chance at parole.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2391 
May 10, 2022 
I struggle to get the connection be-
tween the crime of infanticide and the 
debate we are having, because there is 
nothing in the bill coming to the floor 
by the Democrats which is going to 
change that basic finding in the case in 
Pennsylvania. 
That doctor, now removed from his 
profession and serving time in Federal 
prison, was guilty of a crime, and the 
bill before us on the floor of the Senate 
will not change that reality at all. I 
don’t know if that was the inference, 
but I took it to mean that. I hope I was 
wrong. 
We need to acknowledge the basics 
that a critical constitutional right 
may be removed by the Supreme Court. 
I am an amateur historian studying 
the history of this country. I can’t 
think of another time when a constitu-
tionally guaranteed right by Supreme 
Court opinion of over 50 years has been 
removed by the Court. But that is what 
we face now—on the right of Americans 
to make the most basic decisions about 
their health, their lives, and their fu-
ture. 
Sadly, many Republicans are des-
perately trying to deflect from this rul-
ing and what it means for every single 
American. 
If the legal reason in the Court’s 
draft opinion becomes final, that deci-
sion in Dobbs will end a half-century 
guarantee that the right to abortion is 
protected in our Constitution. 
Republicans know that overturning 
Roe v. Wade and eliminating access to 
a woman’s healthcare is extremely un-
popular. 
When asked point-blank whether we 
should do it, only 28 percent of Ameri-
cans say that they agree. 
In a world without Roe, Americans 
would not only be denied healthcare 
services they are entitled to, it is pos-
sible—it is possible—that some will be 
prosecuted. 
Far-right lawmakers have been fever-
ishly anticipating this moment. Over 
the past week, some of these same offi-
cials 
have 
introduced 
legislation 
around the country designed to punish 
women for making the basic decisions 
about reproductive health. 
State legislators in Louisiana intro-
duced a bill to allow prosecutors to 
bring murder charges against a woman 
who undergoes or anyone who provides 
an abortion. 
The same Louisiana bill would seem-
ingly call into question the legality of 
in vitro fertilization, as well as IUDs, 
the morning after pill, and other forms 
of emergency contraception. 
I am glad I was on the floor a few 
minutes ago. My colleague, Senator 
DUCKWORTH, talked about her two little 
girls—cutest kids you can imagine. 
I remember those kids from the ear-
liest time. When I was in a car driving 
in the State of Illinois to an event in 
Bloomington, the phone rang and it 
was TAMMY DUCKWORTH. She was my 
colleague in the U.S. Senate and—she 
was going to be my colleague in the 
U.S. Senate, and she was a Member of 
the House of Representatives, and she 
told me that she was going to have a 
baby. I couldn’t believe it. 
TAMMY and I have known one another 
since a few weeks after her, I should 
say, terrible crash of the helicopter in 
Iraq. I had known what she had gone 
through, surgeries and recovery, and I 
was the one who encouraged her to run 
for office, and I am sure glad I did. She 
has become the voice of the military, 
the voice of veterans, and one of most 
powerful voices in the U.S. Senate. 
And when she told the story about 
those two little girls, born through the 
process of in vitro fertilization, it 
struck home. 
I am fortunate enough as a grand-
father 
to 
have 
two 
in 
vitro 
grandbabies. I love them to pieces, and 
I thank goodness that there was a 
science achievement available to help 
my daughter deliver those beautiful 
kids. 
A Republican lawmaker in Idaho said 
he is open to banning certain forms of 
birth control if this decision goes for-
ward at the Supreme Court. He wanted 
to include plan B emergency contra-
ception and IUDs. 
Think about that. State by State, 
legislator by legislator, will decide 
what is acceptable when it comes to 
contraception. 
Now, some people are going to think: 
DURBIN, you are exaggerating. Demo-
crats are at it again exaggerating. 
But I am old enough to remember be-
fore Griswold, the regulation of contra-
ception in those days when it was vir-
tually, in many States, even illegal to 
buy a condom. 
And so you think I am exaggerating? 
We lived at that time. 
It wasn’t until Griswold v. Con-
necticut, 
decided 
by 
the 
Supreme 
Court, that established a right of pri-
vacy under our Constitution, which 
then led to Roe v. Wade. That was 
America. It was an America which, 
sadly, many Republican lawmakers 
long for. 
A lawmaker in Missouri introduced a 
bill that deputizes bounty hunters to 
sue anyone who helps a woman seeking 
an abortion outside the State of Mis-
souri. 
I wanted to remind my colleague 
from Texas, who spoke just before me, 
it was the Texas bounty hunter’s law 
that started this conversation in ear-
nest. 
In Texas, they decided that there 
would be a civil penalty that can be 
charged against those who were en-
gaged in an abortion, and the person 
could claim that penalty if they dis-
closed that to the public. 
Just a few days ago, the Republican 
leader in this body, Senator MCCON-
NELL of Kentucky, said that a national 
ban on abortion could be ‘‘possible’’—a 
national ban if Roe is overturned and 
the Republicans take control of the 
Senate. 
Leaving it up to each State to decide 
a woman’s reproductive rights is cre-
ating a patchwork quilt of uncertainty. 
Your constitutional rights would de-
pend on your ZIP Code, but that is ex-
actly the future we are facing. 
To be sure, Democratic State legisla-
tures will continue to protect access to 
abortion unless, of course, Republicans 
in Congress enact the national ban 
that Senator MCCONNELL said is pos-
sible. 
In the absence of a national ban, if 
you can afford to travel, you will be 
able to access reproductive care in 
States like Illinois and Connecticut. 
But what about everyone else? If the 
right to have an abortion now depends 
on where you live or how much money 
you make, millions of women, many 
from historically marginalized commu-
nities, will face even greater hurdles in 
obtaining an abortion. 
America already has one of the worst 
maternal mortality rates in the devel-
oped world. Drastically restricting ac-
cess to abortion or banning abortion 
altogether will make those rates worse. 
Republicans and anti-choice activists 
are trying to minimize the impact that 
erasing Roe would have. They talk 
about other times the Supreme Court 
has overturned precedent, and they 
argue—disingenuously, I think—that 
this is how the Court has always 
worked. It corrects its own past mis-
takes. 
They claim that overturning Roe is 
no different than the Supreme Court 
overturning Plessy v. Ferguson—a de-
cision which gave us the odious fiction 
of ‘‘separate but equal’’ that was later 
overturned by Brown v. Board of Edu-
cation. But there is a profound dif-
ference. It appears that never before in 
the history of America has a Supreme 
Court decision to abandon settled law 
made Americans less free—never. In 
the past, when the Court has taken the 
serious step of overturning settled law, 
it has done so to expand freedom, ex-
pand opportunity, not eliminate it. 
What the activist, anti-choice majority 
on this Court will do is unprecedented, 
radical, and dangerous. 
Here is another fact that Republican 
lawmakers are hoping you will not no-
tice: It is not just the right to abortion 
that is in jeopardy; Justice Alito’s 
draft opinion in the Dobbs case ques-
tions the very existence of the right to 
privacy. It argues that unenumerated 
rights—that is, rights not explicitly 
mentioned in the Constitution—must 
be deeply rooted in U.S. history and 
tradition in order to be recognized as a 
constitutional right. Who decides what 
is deeply rooted in history and tradi-
tion? 
The Court’s Obergefell v. Hodges de-
cision established marriage equality 
only 7 years ago. Will the Court’s reac-
tionary majority put that next on the 
chopping block? 
What about the right to contracep-
tion, as I mentioned before, established 
by Griswold v. Connecticut 11 years be-
fore Roe? A Republican Member of this 
body recently criticized that decision 
establishing the privacy right of every 
individual to choose the contraception

right for their family. He described this 
as ‘‘constitutionally unsound.’’ 
Rather than settling the debate on 
abortion, 
the 
draft 
Dobbs 
opinion 
would further divide our fractious Na-
tion and set the stage for a radical ma-
jority in the Court to erase even more 
constitutional rights. It would give 
government the power to dictate your 
rights and dictate your future. That is 
why we must take action to protect 
women’s productive rights. 
Tomorrow, the Senate will vote on 
the Women’s Health Protection Act. 
This bill will codify the right to pro-
vide or obtain an abortion free from 
medically 
unnecessary 
restrictions. 
The American people deserve to know 
where their Senators stand. I will not 
stop fighting for the right of every 
American, especially the women of 
America, to have these rights as estab-
lished for over 50 years. 
For years, the Republicans have 
claimed they are the party of families, 
the party of family values. Yet they 
have spent decades ignoring the needs 
of working families. Republicans are 
willing to force women to carry un-
wanted or unexpected or even dan-
gerous pregnancies to term, but they 
are not willing to help them raise their 
children. 
There are aspects of their voting pat-
terns in the Senate that make it clear 
that when it comes to helping families 
with the basics, such as tax credits for 
children, making sure that families 
have paid medical leave for their 
newborns or other family members—all 
of these things are family friendly and 
family values. Unfortunately, they are 
not supported by many, if any, Repub-
licans. That would be a demonstration 
that they truly care for families. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HICKENLOOPER). The clerk will call the 
roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF ASMERET ASEFAW BERHE 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today in opposition 
to the nomination of Dr. Asmeret 
Berhe, who has been nominated to 
serve as the Director of the Office of 
Science at the U.S. Department of En-
ergy. 
The Office of Science is the Nation’s 
largest Federal sponsor of basic re-
search in physical sciences. Its mission 
is to advance the energy, economic, 
and national security of the United 
States. This job, this mission to ad-
vance the energy, economic, and na-
tional security of the United States is 
one that I view as very critical. 
Dr. Berhe has been a professor of soil 
biogeochemistry—soil 
biogeo-
chemistry—at the University of Cali-
fornia Merced for over a decade. Now, 
she has focused her research on soil 
management and sequestering carbon 
in the soil. Her background and her ex-
perience have very little to do with the 
Department of Energy’s main scientific 
focus. 
A May 9, 2001, op-ed in the Wall 
Street Journal by a physicist whose ex-
pertise 
is 
theoretical 
physics 
has 
noted: 
Ms. Berhe’s research program on soil 
chemistry, exploring the capture of carbon 
dioxide, is relevant to climate-change policy. 
But her research expertise isn’t in any of the 
Office of Science’s major programs, and she 
has no experience as a scientific adminis-
trator and minimal experience with the En-
ergy Department itself. 
So not that there is anything wrong 
with her underlying experience to do 
other things, but for this specific posi-
tion, the qualifications just aren’t 
there. Dr. Berhe is clearly not the right 
choice to lead the Office of Science. 
Certain 
positions 
Dr. 
Berhe 
has 
taken or endorsed are also concerning. 
On February 28, 2001, she retweeted this 
statement: 
I’m just going to propose that a nation 
that can land an SUV sized rover in an an-
cient lake on another planet can build an 
electrical grid that is not [f---ing] useless— 
This is her retweeting— 
because of slavish devotion to the 
free market. 
Apparently, we are devoted to the 
free market, and she doesn’t like it. 
On May 7, 2015, she wrote in Science 
that ‘‘the practice of farming’’ is to 
blame for climate change. ‘‘The prac-
tice of farming’’ is to blame for climate 
change. 
Dr. Berhe is not the right person to 
serve as the Director of the Office of 
Science. I rise in opposition to her 
nomination. I urge my colleagues to 
join me in voting against this nominee. 
I yield the floor. 
VOTE ON PHILLIPS NOMINATION 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to start the vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The question is, Will the Senate ad-
vise and consent to the Phillips nomi-
nation? 
Mr. BARRASSO. I ask for the yeas 
and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond.

WOMEN’S HEALTH PROTECTION ACT 
Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, in the 
aftermath of last week’s leak of the 
draft Supreme Court opinion of Dobbs 
v. Jackson Women’s Health Organiza-
tion, we are facing one of the lowest 
moments in history for our Nation’s 
highest Court. 
An illegitimate, far-right majority 
on the Court is poised to overturn Roe 
v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. 
Casey and take away a fundamental 
constitutional right that has been the 
law of the land for almost 50 years—the 
right to a legal, safe abortion. Every 
American deserves the right to make 
their own decisions about their own 
bodies. 
While the leaked opinion may only 
be a draft, we cannot ignore the pro-
found threat it poses. That is because 
the opinion is the outrageous culmina-
tion of a rightwing campaign to take 
over the Court and take America back 
to the days when far too many faced 
not only a loss of liberty but a loss of 
life when seeking abortion care. 
It validates the theft of two Supreme 
Court seats by President Trump, then- 
Leader MCCONNELL, and Senate Repub-
licans. 
It confirms that conservative Jus-
tices lied to the Congress and the 
American people about their commit-
ment to the Court’s precedent and the 
rule of law. 
Overturning Roe v. Wade will under-
mine the health, safety, and freedom of 
millions of Americans, and it will cre-
ate horrific pain and hardship for peo-
ple all across the Nation, especially 
those without the means or resources 
to travel to States where abortion will 
remain safe and legal. 
Already, for pregnant Americans in 
red States across the country, access 
to abortion is functionally denied be-
cause of a lack of funds, geography, im-
migration status, and other barriers. 
This war on people of color and the 
poor is already being waged, and we 
cannot let the Supreme Court provide 
deadlier weapons. 
If the extremist rightwing of the 
Court is willing to abandon something 
as fundamental as the right to privacy 
and the right for Americans to make 
decisions about their own bodies, then 
we are on a slippery slope to the 
undoing of other fundamental rights 
the Court has recognized as being 
grounded in the right to privacy, in-
cluding the right to use contraception 
or the right to marry whomever you 
love. 
But this was the goal of the Repub-
licans and the rightwing all along: 
steal the Supreme Court seats, steal an 
election, and steal the rights of Ameri-
cans. 
This is the direct consequence of an 
anti-majoritarian and anti-democratic 
national electoral system that allowed 
two Presidents, who both lost the pop-
ular vote, to nominate more than half 
of the current Justices to the U.S. Su-
preme Court and allowed them to be 
confirmed by Senators representing a 
minority of the Nation’s population. 
This is the racist, misogynistic, 
xenophobic manifestation of a radical 
rightwing, extremist vision of America 
that is out of step with the vast major-
ity of Americans. In fact, by a 2-to-1 
margin, Americans say Roe v. Wade 
should be upheld. 
This egregious and overtly political 
act cannot be allowed to go unan-
swered. Faith in our judicial system is 
in jeopardy, so we are left with no 
other choice. We have to immediately 
pass Federal legislation that protects 
millions of Americans’ right to choose, 
that lifts dangerous and discriminatory 
bans on abortion, and that removes un-
necessary limits on reproductive free-
dom. 
The Women’s Health Protection Act 
will do all of that by codifying Roe so 
as to affirm it as the law of the land. 
The Women’s Health Protection Act 
enshrines in Federal law a healthcare 
provider’s right to provide abortion 
services and a patient’s right to receive 
them. 
Among its provisions, the bill would 
prohibit previability bans designed to 
undercut the right to an abortion, like 
the 15-week ban imposed by the Mis-
sissippi law at issue in Dobbs or spe-
cious ‘‘heartbeat’’ bans like the one 
imposed by Texas’s SB 8. 
The Women’s Health Protection Act 
would prohibit bans that do not make 
exceptions for the patient’s health or 
life. I am appalled that any Member of 
Congress could consider themselves in 
support of women but then support a 
ban that explicitly devalues life. 
This bill would also ban so-called 
TRAP laws—the targeted regulation of 
abortion providers—that impose oner-
ous and unwarranted requirements on 
facilities and providers who do nothing 
to promote health but, rather, make it 
nearly impossible for healthcare pro-
viders to keep their doors open. 
The bill would also prohibit require-
ments that providers share medically 
inaccurate information and impose 
medically unnecessary and manipula-
tive tests and procedures like manda-
tory ultrasounds. 
It would prohibit limitations that 
prevent providers from caring for pa-
tients by telemedicine—a service that 
we have all learned to have been in-
valuable over the course of the pan-
demic and one that is all the more nec-
essary for abortion care given the al-
ready draconian laws in some red 
States across the country. 
It would bar other unjustified, oner-
ous, and discriminatory practices in-
tended to place obstacles in the path of 
those seeking abortion services. 
In short, the Women’s Health Protec-
tion Act will safeguard the rights es-
tablished by 50 years of Supreme Court 
precedent and would protect abortion 
access even if Roe is overturned. 
This bill is all that is standing be-
tween the America we have known for 
decades and one that plunges millions 
of people back in time—into despair, 
pain, poverty, and forced parenthood. 
If we fail to act, we know Repub-
licans will. If the Supreme Court over-
turns Roe v. Wade, 28 States are poised 
to ban abortion outright. Of those, 13 
States already have trigger bans in 
place—activating laws that would ban 
abortion automatically when Roe is 
overturned.

S2394 
May 10, 2022 
These bans and attacks fall hardest 
on those most marginalized, including 
people of color, LGBTQ people, people 
with low incomes, and those in rural 
communities. Many of these States 
would 
criminalize 
abortion. 
Those 
seeking abortions and those performing 
them would face the prospect of prison. 
It is not just at the State level. The 
Republican leader in the Senate has 
said the quiet part out loud: If Repub-
licans gain control of the Senate, they 
could consider Federal legislation that 
bans abortion as passing on the floor of 
this Senate. 
We can’t sit idly by and wait for the 
worst to happen. It is already at our 
doorstep. We must make the right to 
safe and secure reproductive health and 
freedom the law of the land. We must 
do it now. 
I yield the floor.

NOMINATION OF ASMERET ASEFAW BERHE 
Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I 
am pleased to support the nomination 
of Dr. Asmeret Asefaw Berhe to be the 
Director of the Office of Science at the 
Department of Energy. 
President 
Reagan 
famously 
com-
plained that the Department of Energy 
never ‘‘produced a quart of oil or a 
lump of coal,’’ but that was never the 
Department’s job. 
The Department of Energy is as 
much a Department of Science and 
Technology as a Department of En-
ergy. For nearly 50 years, it has been at 
the forefront of scientific discovery 
and technology innovation. As a seed-
bed for science, the Department has 
given us the technologies to increase 
our energy production and use our re-
sources in a cleaner and more efficient 
way, and the Office of Science lies at 
the heart of the Department’s science 
mission. 
It is the Nation’s largest Federal sup-
porter of basic research in the physical 
sciences. Its mission is to deliver the 
‘‘scientific 
discoveries, 
capabilities, 
and major scientific tools to transform 
the understanding of nature and to ad-
vance the energy, economic, and na-
tional security of the United States.’’ 
Leading this important scientific en-
terprise calls for a scientist of great 
ability and vision. I believe Dr. Berhe 
is very qualified for this important job. 
In judging from the long list of aca-
demic honors and awards that she has 
received and the long list of scientific 
papers that she has written, Dr. Berhe 
has the scientific credentials this job 
requires. She is a professor of soil bio-
chemistry at the University of Cali-
fornia, where she is also an associate 
dean of graduate education and holds 
an endowed chair in Earth Sciences 
and Geology. 
The Office of Science itself has long 
engaged in basic research relating to 
soil science and broader ecological 
questions, whether they be tracing ra-
dioactive elements through the atmos-
phere or the flow of energy, water, and 
carbon through the Earth’s natural 
systems. So her background is an asset 
and makes her very well suited to lead 
the Office of Science. 
Dr. Berhe is also an adjunct professor 
at the Salk Institute for Biological 
Studies, and she has been a visiting 
professor at ETH Zurich, where Albert 
Einstein studied physics. She didn’t 
teach him, but he studied there. She 
has authored over 100 scientific papers 
and has received over two dozen honors 
and awards for her scientific achieve-
ments. 
She is incredibly well qualified for 
this important post of leading the Of-
fice of Science. I strongly support her 
nomination, and I urge a favorable vote 
on her nomination. 
I yield back all time.

WOMEN’S HEALTH PROTECTION ACT 
Ms. WARREN. Madam President, I 
rise today to urge the Senate to take 
action to protect abortion rights and 
defend our constitutional rights. 
A far-right, extremist Supreme Court 
wants to force their views on every 
American. Roe v. Wade has protected 
the right to a safe, legal abortion for 
nearly 50 years. Though Republicans 
have tried to challenge it in court 
many times, the Supreme Court has re-
affirmed Roe over and over and over 
again—until now. 
So what changed? Why is something 
that is repeatedly referred to as ‘‘set-
tled law’’ on the threshold of being 
swept away like so much dust? Why is 
a law that literally tens of millions of 
people have depended on to protect ac-
cess to a safe, legal abortion suddenly 
about to evaporate? 
We don’t arrive here accidentally. We 
are here because Republican politicians 
have spent decades plotting for this 
moment. They have cultivated extrem-
ist judges. Groups like the Federalist 
Society have screened possible can-
didates and drawn up lists of which 
possible candidates could and could not 
be counted on. Extremist donors spent 
billions in dark money so that their 
preferred ideologues could chip away at 
people’s fundamental rights and do it 
from the Bench. Republican candidates 
for office pledged to support Justices 
who would get rid of Roe v. Wade. And, 
finally, when all of that still wasn’t 
enough, Republicans stole two seats on 
the Supreme Court, all to force their 
unpopular minority agenda on the rest 
of America. 
I am here to sound a warning. Repub-
lican extremism has been carefully 
nurtured for years. Now Republican ex-
tremism is spreading, and now it is ob-
vious 
that 
Republican 
extremism 
knows no bounds. 
Let’s talk about the facts—the facts 
of Republican extremism—and let’s 
begin with who pays the price for Re-
publican extremism. Changes in abor-
tion 
laws 
will 
have 
terrible 
con-
sequences, but those consequences will 
not fall equally on everyone. No, those 
with money will always have the op-
tion to leave the State or leave the 
country to travel where abortion is 
safe and legal. No, the people who will 
pay the biggest price will be the most 
vulnerable among us—the mama al-
ready working two jobs to help make 
ends meet to support the children she 
has; the women working jobs who have 
no paid leave and who can’t take 3 days 
off work to go to another State; the 
women in South Dakota scrambling to 
make an appointment at the only abor-
tion clinic in the entire State; the 12- 
year-old who has been molested; the 
person who has been raped; the women 
in Texas who need lifesaving care their 
doctors can’t provide; and the women 
all 
across 
the 
country, 
especially 
women of color, already facing shame-
fully high maternal mortality rates— 
because in America, carrying a preg-
nancy to term is 43 times riskier than 
a legal abortion. 
These are the facts about over-
turning Roe v. Wade, and these are the 
people—disproportionately low-income 
women, women of color, and women in 
rural communities—who will pay the 
price for Republican extremism. 
Overturning Roe is just the begin-
ning. Republican State legislatures all 
across the country have already been 
emboldened by this Supreme Court, in-
troducing hundreds of anti-abortion 
bills this year alone. States are now in-
troducing bills to declare it a crime for 
someone to obtain an abortion, for 
someone to provide an abortion, or for 
someone just to help someone locate 
where they might get an abortion. 
And where will the Republican ex-
tremists turn next? Will they inves-
tigate every miscarriage? Will they put 
every obstetrician and gynecologist on 
the watch list? Will they monitor loca-
tion data for every person who pulls 
into the parking lot of a Planned Par-
enthood clinic? 
Let’s be absolutely clear about what 
will happen if this decision stands. Re-
publicans want to do more than crim-
inalize abortion; they want to crim-
inalize women for making decisions 
about their pregnancies and their own 
health. This isn’t theoretical. It is al-
ready coming to pass. 
In Texas, where abortion has been 
virtually inaccessible to millions of 
Texans for the last 8 months, a young 
woman has been charged with murder 
for an alleged self-induced abortion. 
An Oklahoma law has passed that 
would outlaw abortion even in the case 
of rape or incest. But what Republicans 
are really after is criminalizing wom-
en’s very bodies. 
In Louisiana, Republicans are push-
ing for the most extreme bill yet, legis-
lation that would classify abortion as a 
homicide. If enacted, this bill could 
criminalize women for using certain 
forms of birth control or even for hav-
ing a miscarriage that she had no con-
trol over. 
And we know who will be the most 
affected by the overcriminalization of 
women’s bodies. It will be women of 
color who are already overpoliced and 
face the greatest barriers to accessing 
healthcare. 
The intrusiveness of these State laws 
is vile. Efforts to give fertilized eggs 
‘‘personhood’’ rights and to criminalize 
abortion could make IVF procedures 
criminal, depriving someone who wants 
to get pregnant the only option avail-
able to her. 
As some States get more and more 
aggressive about intruding into the pri-
vate lives of millions of women, just 
this weekend, the Republican leader, 
MITCH MCCONNELL, signaled he is open 
to even more extremism. He said that a 
nationwide abortion ban was ‘‘pos-
sible’’ if Republicans retake the major-
ity—a nationwide abortion ban applica-
ble in every State, including those 
States that are currently working 
overtime to protect access to abortion; 
a nationwide abortion ban applicable 
to girls who have been molested and to 
people who have been raped and to 
women who are already working three 
jobs to support the women they have. 
Republican extremism is spreading. 
Republican 
extremism 
knows 
no 
bounds. 
For me, this isn’t about politics; this 
is personal. I have lived in a world 
where abortion was illegal. I learned 
early on that when the law bans abor-
tions, only safe and legal abortions will 
actually be banned. I lived in a world 
in which women bled to death from 
back-ally abortions, a world in which 
infections and other complications de-
stroyed women’s futures, a world in 
which women’s educations and lives 
were derailed by an unplanned preg-
nancy, a world in which some women 
took their own lives rather than con-
tinuing with a pregnancy they could 
not bear. 
I have also lived in a world where 
abortion is legal. For decades, ex-
panded access to abortion has allowed 
people to make decisions about their 
own bodies and lives, promoting access 
to life-changing opportunities and ca-
reers that have previously seemed out 
of reach. But the Republican extrem-
ists and the extremist Justices they 
have put on the Supreme Court just 
don’t care. They want to send us back 
to the days when women’s rights to 
control their own bodies and their own 
futures simply did not exist.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2396 
May 10, 2022 
American freedoms are under attack. 
The liberty of more than half our popu-
lation is under attack. Republicans 
have planned long and hard for this 
day, and now that it is here, we must 
stand and fight. 
Tomorrow, the Senate will vote on 
the Women’s Health Protection Act to 
enshrine the right to an abortion in 
Federal law. We need the Women’s 
Health Protection Act to prevent rad-
ical rightwing State legislatures from 
ever 
enacting 
extreme 
bills 
like 
Texas’s SB 8 or Mississippi’s 15-week 
ban. With WHPA, we will take the 
steps necessary to protect our human 
rights. It is just that simple. 
And for everyone who says we don’t 
have the votes in the Senate to get this 
done, I say, then get in the fight and 
give us the Senators who will get it 
done. Don’t tell us what we can’t do to 
stop Republican extremism; get in the 
fight to help us beat these abortion re-
strictions into the dirt. Get in the fight 
to recognize the dignity and liberty of 
every American. 
After this vote, there will be no am-
biguity. Every American will know ex-
actly where their elected representa-
tives in Congress stand, and every Sen-
ator will have to explain whether they 
defend the right of every person to 
have control over their own bodies and 
their own futures or whether they will 
stand by as women’s constitutional 
rights are brazenly stripped away. 
Whenever this Court strikes down 
freedoms and rights guaranteed by the 
Constitution, Congress must defend 
Americans every single time. I am 
angry 
that 
a 
group 
of 
unelected 
ideologues on the Supreme Court think 
that they can turn current law upside 
down and dictate to tens of millions of 
people across this country the terms of 
their pregnancies and their lives. 
But the Supreme Court does not get 
the last word on the right to a safe and 
legal abortion. The American people, 
through their leaders right here in 
Congress, can take action. And that is 
why I will vote to support the Women’s 
Health Protection Act. That is why I 
will fiercely oppose any threat to our 
liberty. And that is why I will continue 
to fight with every bone in my body to 
protect the right of every woman to 
control her own future. 
Republican extremism is spreading. 
Republican 
extremism 
knows 
no 
bounds. Tomorrow, we have a chance 
to fight back, and we will fight back. 
I have lived in a world where abor-
tion is illegal, and we are not going 
back—never. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MUR-
PHY). The Senator from Connecticut. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, 
when I introduced the Women’s Health 
Protection Act in 2013—yes, in 2013, al-
most 10 years ago—the idea that Roe v. 
Wade would be overturned by the U.S. 
Supreme Court was virtually unthink-
able. We accepted 50 years of estab-
lished precedent, long-accepted law in 
this country—as something that was 
virtually unimaginable. 
Women relied on it. Our society took 
it as a core principle of our constitu-
tional law, much as Brown v. Board of 
Education, Marbury v. Madison, Roe v. 
Wade, tenets and pillars of constitu-
tional law in this country. And when 
we asked nominees to the U.S. Su-
preme Court, the three most recent of 
them—and I personally asked this 
question—is Roe v. Wade established 
law, they said to us that they would 
rely on stare decisis, which for every-
day Americans is, basically, we will 
follow established precedent as articu-
lated year after year by the U.S. Su-
preme Court. 
The now well-reported Alito draft of 
an opinion overturning Roe v. Wade 
came like a thunderbolt, an earth-
quake, a seismic blow that constitu-
tional scholars thought was unthink-
able. 
The draft itself is strident and brash. 
It is disrespectful in a way that Su-
preme Court opinions never are. It is 
unprecedented in its tone and ap-
proach, saying that Roe v. Wade was 
egregiously wrong, failing to accu-
rately portray what it held and the 
reasons for its holding. 
There is no question in my mind that 
the Court, in its final opinion, will 
smooth the edges of that draft. It will 
try to tone down the rhetoric. It will 
dress it up. But the result will be the 
same. No matter how the Court may 
try to dress it up, it will have the same 
impact on millions of Americans and 
their families because the U.S. Su-
preme Court is poised to issue the most 
radical ruling in recent history—per-
haps in the entire history of the United 
States—the most extreme contraction 
of fundamental constitutional rights in 
the history of the United States. 
Let’s indulge ourselves for a moment 
in a belief in the American dream and 
the exceptionalism of America, which 
is to expand rights and liberties. The 
story of America is expanding freedoms 
and liberties for all of us, not reducing 
it, restricting it. But this Supreme 
Court is poised to eradicate a funda-
mental right that millions of Ameri-
cans have relied on for half a century. 
The Court has signaled that it will in-
flict an enormous leap backwards, with 
incalculable costs and chaos for count-
less women and their families. If the 
Court indeed overturns Roe, 23 States 
have laws that would immediately go 
into effect to be used to restrict the 
legal status of abortion. 
Today, 90 percent of American coun-
ties already lack a single abortion pro-
vider—not one in 90 percent of Amer-
ican counties—and 27 cities have be-
come so-called abortion deserts be-
cause people who live there have to 
travel 100 miles or more to reach a pro-
vider. Without the protections of Roe, 
this situation will become even worse 
for millions of Americans. Women in 
Louisiana, just to take one example, 
will be 630 miles from the nearest abor-
tion clinic. Women in Florida, Texas, 
Mississippi, Utah, and many other 
States would be in a similar position. 
Access to reproductive freedom will de-
pend on a woman’s ZIP Code, not on 
her personal choices or her needs. 
Abortion bans without Roe will dis-
proportionately 
impact 
low-income 
women in those 23 States poised to ban 
abortion. 
Justice Alito—perhaps not surpris-
ingly—fails to address the ways that 
the Court’s ruling will disproportion-
ately impact communities of color all 
around the United States. There is an 
issue here of racial justice because 
these restrictions disproportionately 
affect Black women and other racial 
minority communities. Today, fewer 
than 1 in 10 abortion providers are lo-
cated in neighborhoods where the ma-
jority of residents are Black. That is a 
simple, straightforward fact of life. 
And the closure of clinics will make it 
only worse. 
The simple fact is that Dobbs will 
turn back the clock. It will roll back 
protections relating to fundamental 
rights. 
May I say that the same people who 
argue that mask requirements designed 
to protect public health infringe on 
their fundamental liberties are per-
fectly happy sending the government 
into a hospital room as a couple makes 
an incredibly difficult, personal life de-
cision. The same people who see masks 
as an infringement on bodily autonomy 
are perfectly happy with the govern-
ment telling a woman who comes to a 
hospital, possibly in mortal danger of 
internal bleeding from an ectopic preg-
nancy: You will have to die. No doctor 
can help you. 
That is not bodily autonomy; that is 
not liberty. 
After the Court’s final decision in 
Dobbs, 
today’s 
young 
women, 
the 
young women of 2022, will have fewer 
rights than their grandmothers. Young 
women today will have fewer rights 
than two generations ago. To someone 
who recalls the seminal decision in Roe 
v. Wade in 1973 and the promise of that 
moment, it is unacceptable. 
I was a law clerk to the author of Roe 
v. Wade in the term after he wrote the 
opinion. Justice Blackmun and the 
Court decided by a 7-to-2 majority—7 
to 2; Justice Blackmun was appointed 
by a Republican President—that this 
right is fundamental. Whether you 
criticize the decision—and there have 
been plenty of people who criticized 
that opinion—it has been established 
law, relied on, incorporated in prece-
dent after precedent. And now, in the 
Women’s Health Protection Act, we 
ask that it be incorporated in statute, 
that the Roe v. Wade standard be en-
shrined and embodied in a statute, just 
as Connecticut did in its State statute 
in 1990—a law that I championed when 
I was in our Connecticut State Senate. 
In lieu of well-established Supreme 
Court precedent, Justice Alito relies on 
a 17th-century English jurist who advo-
cated for marital rape and who tried 
women for witchcraft. This isn’t just 
judicial activism; this is extremism. 
This is fringe history cloaked in a 
judge’s robe.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2397 
May 10, 2022 
And do you know what is conspicu-
ously absent from Justice Alito’s rad-
ical draft opinion? What is absent is 
women. Justice Alito gives absolutely 
no credence to the empirical evidence 
before the Court—evidence offered by 
health experts and economists who 
demonstrate the ways in which women 
have relied upon abortion access to 
make decisions about their health, 
their lives, their careers, and their fu-
ture. Instead, he gestures at the fact 
that women have the right to vote as 
evidence they don’t need the right to 
control their lives and their own bod-
ies. I am sorry, but the right to vote is 
where rights begin; it is not where they 
end. 
And we know the truth, whether or 
not Justice Alito acknowledges it: The 
Court’s world without Roe would not 
just impact one segment of society, one 
demographic, one geographic area; it 
will affect all of us. One in four Amer-
ican women will undergo an abortion 
in her lifetime—one in four. 
To the men of America, all of you 
love someone, you know someone, you 
treasure someone who has had an abor-
tion, who has needed an abortion. You 
can’t sit this one out. 
It is all of us, men as well as women. 
We all have a stake in this radical deci-
sion that will affect all of America and 
make us a lesser nation with fewer 
rights and liberties. 
The Court’s draft opinion in Dobbs is 
just the next step in a multidecade 
fight which the Court has waged on 
abortion access. It has already shown 
willingness to dramatically curtail the 
right of a pregnant person to decide 
whether and when to have a child. Just 
ask women in the State of Texas. They 
are living in a State without the pro-
tections of Roe v. Wade, with a dan-
gerous anti-abortion law, SB 8, which 
contains a 6-week abortion ban. Six 
weeks is far before many women even 
know they are pregnant, as all of us in 
this Chamber know. 
Texas’s dangerous law deputizes pri-
vate citizens to enforce the State’s on-
erous abortion law. In Texas, a rapist 
can sue a doctor if they provide an 
abortion to a rape survivor. Someone 
who drove their sister to a healthcare 
clinic where she has an abortion could 
be sued, again, by anyone in the United 
States—anybody—with a $10,000 gov-
ernment prize money waiting for that 
bounty hunter. This is extremism—ex-
tremism—in a judge’s robes. 
I am proud to say that the State of 
Connecticut today has a law—literally, 
the Governor signed this law today— 
making sure that people are protected 
in Connecticut against those kinds of 
bounty hunters. My hope is that other 
States will follow Connecticut in pro-
viding that kind of basic protection. 
It has never been more urgent for the 
Congress at the Federal level to pass 
the Women’s Health Protection Act. 
The Women’s Health Protection Act 
would protect rights established by 50 
years of Court precedent, protecting 
the right to an abortion prior to fetal 
viability. It would put an end to laws 
like the 15-week ban on abortion that 
is now before the Court in the Dobbs 
case. 
Importantly, as well, the Women’s 
Health Protection Act would put an 
end to medically unnecessary restric-
tions posing as health restrictions that 
single out abortion care with one goal 
in mind: to block and impede access to 
safe, needed healthcare—laws like the 
so-called TRAP law, or targeted regu-
lation of abortion providers; such as 
minimum measurements for room size 
or hallway width that have no ration-
ale other than the transparent desire 
to curtail access; laws that require pro-
viders to offer medically inaccurate in-
formation when providing abortion 
care, like in Alaska, Kansas, Mis-
sissippi, Texas, and West Virginia, 
where 
healthcare 
professionals 
are 
forced to tell women—give them medi-
cally inaccurate information about 
links between abortion and breast can-
cer. It would put an end to a reality 
where our doctors are required by law 
to lie and mislead about the risks of a 
safe medical procedure, and it would 
restore an evidence-based approach to 
informed consent. 
In short, it would essentially guar-
antee the right that exists now, and it 
will exist until the Supreme Court 
rules that you can decide whether and 
when to have children. 
Let us be very clear about what the 
Women’s Health Protection Act does 
and what it doesn’t do. It does not 
force any unwilling medical provider to 
perform abortions if they wish not to 
do so. It says that doctors, nurses, and 
hospitals may provide abortion care, 
not that they must do so. 
This measure is an evidence-based, 
scientific approach to the protection of 
women’s healthcare, and it restores a 
future where all of us are free to make 
personal decisions that shape our lives, 
our futures, and our families with dig-
nity and respect, without political in-
terference in a decision made between 
a patient and a doctor, much as all 
healthcare decisions should be. 
The implications of the Court’s draft 
decision in Dobbs and what we are ex-
pecting from the Court in coming 
weeks simply can’t be overstated or ex-
aggerated, but it would be foolish to 
believe that the Court’s conservative 
supermajority will stop even at Roe. 
Justice Alito’s draft opinion, even if 
it is never issued by the Court, is the 
road map where this Court will go in 
the future. It is permeated with sup-
port 
for 
the 
notion 
that 
‘‘fetal 
personhood,’’ 
a 
dangerous 
theory 
furthered by States like Louisiana that 
seek to make abortion a crime of homi-
cide from the moment of fertilization, 
if adopted, the Court’s novel, invented 
theory of personhood could and may 
well lead to nationwide prohibitions on 
abortion. And most recently, just over 
the weekend, the minority leader of 
the Senate has made clear that in a 
post-Roe world, a Federal ban on abor-
tion is on the table; so did State offi-
cials who spoke over the weekend. 
It is more than a cloud on the hori-
zon; it is an impending, real, imminent 
storm upon us. A ban nationwide on 
abortion, that would override even the 
States like Connecticut that are seek-
ing to legislate protections for women 
that will make us a safe harbor and 
haven. 
The draft opinion also invites chal-
lenges to a host of fundamental rights 
that were also not widely recognized in 
1868, the moment in which Justice 
Alito freezes us in time. He literally 
freezes constitutional rights regarding 
reproductive liberties in that long-gone 
moment. 
The draft opinion cast invites chal-
lenges to a host of fundamental rights, 
including contraception, Griswold v. 
Connecticut; 
interracial 
marriage, 
Loving v. Virginia; same sex marriage, 
Obergefell v. Hodges; and sexual inti-
macy between consenting adults, Law-
rence v. Texas. 
You don’t need to be a constitutional 
scholar to understand the clear and 
present danger to American democracy 
in this draft opinion. 
This Court may dress it up, but the 
results and the reasoning will be the 
same: radical extreme fringe—and di-
rectly contrary to what three nominees 
testified in their confirmation hearing. 
Oh, we respect established precedent, 
of course, stare decisis, fundamental 
principle. 
The legitimacy and credibility of this 
Court is deeply in peril at this mo-
ment, and our democracy really de-
pends on the credibility and respect 
that the American people accord the 
Supreme Court of the United States. It 
has no armies or police force. It has no 
power of the purse. Its authority de-
pends directly on trust and credibility, 
the sense of legitimacy that the Amer-
ican people accord it. 
In the United States, public support 
for legal access to abortion is at the 
highest it has been in two decades, a 
cruel irony for this Court. And today 
the overwhelming majority of voters 
believe that everyone should have ac-
cess to the full range of reproductive 
healthcare, including annual screening, 
birth control, pregnancy tests, and 
abortion. It is a matter of health. 
And at the same time, millions of 
Americans across this country are ab-
solutely terrified. They are angry and 
horrified about what the Supreme 
Court is poised to do because they de-
pend on accessible women’s healthcare. 
If the Supreme Court overturns Roe 
and we have taken no legislative ac-
tion, we will find ourselves in a nation 
where young women of this country, 
not only have fewer rights than their 
grandmothers, they have fewer rights 
than any of them thought possible. 
We have to resolve that we are not 
backing down, we are not going away, 
we are not going back in time. It has 
never been more urgent to elect people, 
Members of this body, who will protect 
fundamental rights. And I guarantee 
that in elections to come, reproductive 
rights will be on the ballot. The women

They will be galvanized on this issue 
because the Women’s Health Protec-
tion Act will be on the ballot, and we 
will have more votes in this body so 
that Members will be held accountable 
for what they do or fail to do. And, ul-
timately, the American people and the 
world are watching. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana. 
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, at the 
National Prayer Breakfast in 1994, 
Mother Teresa famously said: 
I feel that the greatest destroyer of peace 
today is abortion, because it is a war against 
the child, a direct killing of the innocent 
child. 
She went on to say: 
Any country that accepts abortion is not 
teaching the people to love but to use any vi-
olence to get what they want. That is why 
the greatest destroyer of love and peace is 
abortion. 
That was Mother Teresa at the Na-
tional Prayer Breakfast here in DC in 
1994. I agree with those words. Frankly, 
it is shameful that the Democrats and 
pro-abortion activists have resorted to 
despicable tactics—some even illegal, 
some violent—in a last-ditch effort to 
intimidate the Justices in the Dobbs 
case to get the outcome that they 
want. 
What began with the unprecedented 
leak of the majority draft opinion last 
Monday has quickly devolved into pro-
testing at the Justices’ homes, threat-
ening and disrupting church services, 
vandalizing pregnancy resource centers 
that offer support services to pregnant 
moms, and even throwing Molotov 
cocktails at the offices of a pro-life or-
ganization. Frankly, it is chilling. It is 
unacceptable. We cannot let the far 
left’s outrageous behavior obscure the 
fact that the Dobbs draft opinion au-
thored by Justice Alito is a triumph of 
the Constitution and the rule of law. 
There is no right to abortion in the 
text, in history or structure of our Na-
tion’s founding document, and the 
draft opinion masterfully marshals 98 
pages of argument and evidence to 
demonstrate that very fact. 
This watershed decision would be a 
tremendous victory for the fight for 
life and turn the page on a dark chap-
ter of our Nation’s history in which 
more than 62 million unborn children 
have been tragically killed. If the draft 
opinion stands—and I pray that it 
does—it transfers that power from 
unelected judges and gives it back to 
the American people, back to legisla-
tures and elected representatives to 
enact compassionate laws that protect 
unborn babies and their mothers. 
If the Democrats exploiting the un-
precedented leak of the majority draft 
opinion, if it is to stir up the far left 
base and intimidate Justices, that is 
not bad enough, they are now trying to 
pass a radical bill to impose abortion 
on demand without limits across the 
entire country, even up to the moment 
of birth. Leader SCHUMER
has once 
again scheduled a vote for tomorrow on 
the ‘‘Abortion on Demand Until Birth 
Act.’’ 
Now, 
my 
distinguished 
colleague 
from Connecticut used the words ‘‘rad-
ical’’ and ‘‘extreme’’ a number of times 
in his remarks. Let me tell you what is 
radical and extreme about what is 
going to be voted on tomorrow. This is 
barbaric. It is a radical abortion bill 
that would mandate that every single 
State be a late-term abortion State 
like California or New York, where un-
born children can be brutally aborted 
up to the very moment of birth. 
Let me say that again, the Demo-
crats would allow abortion up until the 
very moment of birth itself. The Demo-
crats’ radical abortion bill would con-
fer special benefits on the predatory 
abortion industry and eliminate pop-
ular State laws that protect both pre- 
born children and their mothers. 
Commonsense laws requiring paren-
tal involvement in abortions for mi-
nors, health and safety standards for 
abortion facilities, informed consent 
laws, late-term abortion limits, bans 
on sex-selective or Down syndrome se-
lective abortions, and conscience pro-
tections for doctors who don’t want to 
perform abortions would be eliminated. 
That is how radical this bill is that will 
be voted on tomorrow. 
Under this radical abortion bill, an 
unhatched sea turtle would have more 
protections than an unborn human 
baby. If you look at Federal law, if you 
were to take or destroy the eggs of a 
sea turtle—now, I said the eggs, not the 
hatchlings, that is also a penalty, but 
the eggs—the criminal penalties are se-
vere, up to a hundred thousand dollar 
fine and a year in prison. 
Now, why? Why do we have laws in 
place to protect the eggs of a sea turtle 
or the eggs of eagles? Because when 
you destroy an egg, you are killing a 
pre-born baby sea turtle or a pre-born 
baby eagle. Yet when it comes to a pre- 
born human baby, rather than a sea 
turtle, that baby would be stripped of 
all protections, in all 50 States, under 
the Democrats’ bill that we will be vot-
ing on tomorrow. 
Is that the America the left wants? I 
would ask my Democratic colleagues if 
the pre-born child in the womb is not a 
living human being, then what is it? 
Unborn babies feel pain, unborn babies 
have a heartbeat, they smile, they 
yawn, in fact, just last week in a tell-
ing slip of the tongue, President Biden 
himself admitted that abortion in-
volves a child. A child. That is correct. 
This is, in fact, the truth and the 
brutal reality of abortion that every 
abortion kills a precious child, the 
Democrats have tried for decades to 
avoid admitting this. And the science 
is clear, it has come a long way since 
1973. It is time for the law to catch up 
with great advances that have been 
made in science and technology, in 
medicine, that indisputably show the 
humanity of an unborn child. 
Instead, however, the Democrats’ 
radical abortion bill denies the science. 
It would completely erase pre-born 
children from the law. That is chilling. 
Under the Democrats’ bill, a pre-born 
child simply for the crime of being un-
wanted, inconvenient, or unplanned 
could 
be 
subjected 
to 
brutal 
dis-
memberment procedures in which the 
unborn child bleeds and feels excru-
ciating pain as she dies from being 
pulled apart limb from limb. 
The Democrats’ abortion bill would 
codify an extreme abortion regime that 
is aligned with seven Nations that 
would have the most brutal—the most 
brutal laws that relates to abortion, 
also includes China and North Korea. 
That puts the United States in that 
category if this were passed. 
It would impose abortion up until the 
moment of birth, without any limits, 
in all 50 States. In a nutshell, this rad-
ical bill would make the United States 
of America one of the most dangerous 
places in the world to be a pre-born 
child. 
As I asked my colleagues in the hall-
way on the Democrats’ side, give us 
just one restriction you might put in 
place for abortion, you just don’t hear 
a response for that. 
In tomorrow’s vote, I pray that my 
colleagues will reject this horrific and 
barbaric legislation and take a stand 
for the most vulnerable among us. As 
the Justices continue to deliberate in 
the Dobbs case, I pray the Court will 
resist the intimidation tactics of the 
far left. By sticking to the Constitu-
tion, and repudiating the unprincipled 
and abominable Roe and Casey deci-
sions, the Court has the opportunity to 
make history and strike a blow for jus-
tice for the most defenseless among us. 
The American people, those born, and 
millions yet unborn, deserve nothing 
less. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, late 
last Monday, an unprecedented leak of 
a draft Supreme Court document opin-
ion in the case of Dobbs v. Jackson 
Women’s Health was published. 
In reaction, SCOTUSblog, a leading 
Supreme Court blog stated: 
This leak is the gravest, most unforgivable 
sin. 
Chief Justice Roberts called the leak 
‘‘absolutely appalling.’’ Yet the White 
House is mute on this point. 
And folks back home in Kansas? 
Well, they are aghast as well. They all 
agree—at least every Kansan I have 
talked to—this leak is a blow to the in-
tegrity of the Court and a blow to our 
faith in this hallowed institution. 
In the days since the leak, we have 
also seen Democrats and their activists 
utilize another frequent strategy they 
deploy when things don’t go their way: 
violence and disruption. 
We have all seen the disgusting mul-
titude of images of pro-life offices 
being vandalized and bombed, and we 
all bear witness of Catholic masses dis-
rupted on Mother’s Day—on Mother’s 
Day, of all days. Is nothing sacred in

May 10, 2022 
this country anymore? We have seen 
the threatening violence at the per-
sonal homes of Supreme Court Jus-
tices. Yet, for days, the White House 
was quiet. And just like the riots of the 
summer of 2020 and the looting that 
continues today, the White House 
turns a deaf ear to violence, and they 
swallow their tongue when the violence 
supports their own agenda. 
Listen, these threatening so-called 
protests at the Justices’ homes are a 
violation of the law of this land. They 
are not valid protests. These are at-
tempts to intimidate and influence the 
Court to destroy the independence of 
this judiciary. 
This violence is wrong. It is evil. It is 
an attack on Christianity. It is an at-
tack on the faith and values that this 
Nation were founded upon. Americans 
know it. We all feel the hatred. 
I have to note, Americans understand 
the majority leader has provided no 
such condemnation but, rather, has de-
cided to once again bring back his 
‘‘Abortion on Demand Act’’ to the Sen-
ate floor. This bill is the most egre-
gious, the most horrific attack on the 
lives of unborn children and the health 
of moms in American history. If Demo-
crats had their way, these babies— 
these twin babies I delivered more than 
a decade ago—could have been aborted 
the moment prior to the C-section. 
The overturning of Roe v. Wade sim-
ply returns this emotional issue back 
to the States, to the elected voices of 
the people—no more, no less. 
The Mississippi Dobbs case simply 
protects life after 15 weeks, when a 
baby can feel pain, when a baby can 
recognize its mom’s voice, when a baby 
can recognize the voice of its sibling. 
But let me tell you exactly what the 
Democrats’ extreme ‘‘Abortion on De-
mand Act’’ would do. It goes far beyond 
Roe v. Wade. 
This bill invalidates any and all 
State laws that protect not just the un-
born child but the health and well- 
being of the mom as well. 
It likely leads to American taxpayer 
dollars funding abortions at home and 
around the world. 
Next, it is truly an attack on our 
faith. This bill will tie up faith-based 
hospitals in courts for not offering 
abortion services. 
This bill allows sex-based abortions. 
It eliminates the requirement for in-
formed consent of the patient or paren-
tal consent. 
This bill eliminates conscience pro-
tections. As an obstetrician myself, 
this hits near and dear to my heart. 
This bill is an attack on my faith and 
an attack on the faith of many doctors 
and nurses who refuse to take part in 
abortions. They would be forced out of 
their professions. They would be forced 
out of medical schools, out of residency 
programs. So many aspiring students 
would decide not to go into medicine. 
This bill is a total disregard to the 
mother’s health by placing no value on 
the mom’s life and well-being. This 
radical 
bill 
eliminates 
the 
health 
standards of a surgery center for this 
procedure to be performed in a surgery 
center. In fact, this bill would allow 
these services to be offered in a garage 
or a back-room apartment. 
Shockingly, it provides the right to 
provide abortions to any healthcare 
provider—not necessarily a physician 
but to certified nurse-midwives, nurse 
practitioners, a physician assistant. 
This bill will lead to the death and in-
fertility of many, many women. This 
procedure is not a simple procedure. It 
should not be placed in the hands of in-
experienced people. This type of proce-
dure is only done after 4 years of un-
dergraduate, 4 years of medical school, 
and probably 2 or 3 years of residency. 
In the most skilled of hands, this type 
of procedure can lead to serious loss of 
life. 
Finally and more specifically, this 
bill strikes down State laws that re-
strict telehealth abortions. These are 
chemical abortions, and they would be-
come a common means of birth con-
trol—again, leading to many, many 
more visits to the emergency rooms for 
these women who are taking medicines 
unsupervised. 
Finally, I have to correct something 
one of my friends across the aisle said. 
He stated that we from the pro-life 
community would not treat women 
with ectopic pregnancies. Nothing is 
further from the truth. This case of 
Roe v. Wade has nothing to do with 
treating ectopic pregnancies. I person-
ally have treated hundreds of women 
with ectopic pregnancies. I believe that 
life begins at conception, but treating 
an ectopic pregnancy is a life-threat-
ening situation for the mom. And the 
Catholic Church supports the treat-
ment of ectopic pregnancies. But that 
is the type of scare tactic my col-
leagues across the aisle want to use. 
Finally, let me just conclude with 
this: I never imagined I would be fight-
ing harder to save the lives of moms 
and babies on the floor of the Senate 
than I did in the emergency room or 
the delivery room in my obstetrics 
practice for some 30 years. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, my col-
leagues and I are here today to high-
light the fact that our Democratic col-
leagues have shown the American peo-
ple how truly radical they are when it 
comes to abortion. 
The 
Women’s 
Health 
Protection 
Act—what I believe should be better 
known as the ‘‘Abortion on Demand 
Until the Moment of Birth Act’’—casts 
a vision of abortion in America, one ut-
terly without limitation. 
Federalism is one of the truly genius 
ideas behind the U.S. Constitution. 
Federalism means that we make the 
majority of our decisions at a more 
local level rather than at the national 
level. When we rely on the principle of 
federalism, more people across the 
country have more reason to be con-
tent with the laws they have. People 
have a greater say in the legislative 
process at the local level, which means 
they get more of the kind of govern-
ment they want and less of the kind of 
government they don’t want. 
For nearly the last half-century, the 
decisions in Roe v. Wade and Planned 
Parenthood v. Casey have abused the 
Constitution by reading into the Con-
stitution a right that exists nowhere in 
the Constitution. 
These wrongly decided cases have 
wreaked havoc on public trust in gov-
ernment, on the republican nature of 
our government, on the public’s under-
standing of the Constitution. More 
gravely, these decisions have permitted 
the euphemistically described ‘‘termi-
nation’’ of 63 million American lives. 
That is more than 45 times the number 
of American lives lost in war since the 
founding of our Nation—every war 
combined. Forty-five times that. Let 
that sink in for a minute. 
Abortion is a tragedy. It is one that 
is scarring our Nation’s history be-
cause of what it says about how we re-
spect human life. Those scores of mil-
lions of lives represent—each and every 
one of them—unique and unrepeatable 
genetic makeups and identities and po-
tentials. They represent the loss of 
Americans of all races, varying phys-
ical and mental abilities, all political 
affiliations and professions, with many 
targeted because of their race, sex, or 
disability. Their termination is a loss 
of ideas, of innovation, and of compas-
sion. Those abortions erase all poten-
tial families and communities. Those 
abortions represent the loss of infinite 
potential, connection, and love. Abor-
tion is a tragedy that scars our history. 
So when I read Justice Alito’s draft 
opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s 
Health Organization, I was elated— 
elated—because it relies on federalism 
and a sound reading of the Constitu-
tion to reassert that there is no con-
stitutional right to an abortion. Just 
because a combination of lawyers wear-
ing robes 48 years ago decided that 
would be the case does not make it so. 
Our Constitution is difficult to amend, 
and it is deliberately that way. They 
didn’t follow this procedure; they tried 
to circumvent it, and they were wrong. 
Regulating abortion is a matter re-
served for the American people and 
their elected representatives, not nine 
unelected Justices. For that very rea-
son, a number of people have turned 
against it, and because they can’t char-
acterize it the way that it actually is, 
they mischaracterize it. 
Then they go so far as to encourage 
people to show up to the homes, the 
private residences, of the Supreme 
Court Justices in question. There is no 
reason to do this that doesn’t involve 
an implicit threat of violence. When 
you show up at someone’s home, you 
are sending an unmistakable message: 
We know where you sleep. That is why 
this is expressly prohibited under Fed-
eral law. There is a Federal criminal 
law prohibiting this under 18 U.S.C. 
section 1507.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2400 
May 10, 2022 
Now, stunningly, the White House— 
the White House—the President’s per-
sonal spokesperson, Jen Psaki, just in 
the last few hours, has repeated this 
charge, has encouraged people to do 
this, saying: 
We certainly continue to encourage pro-
tests outside of judge’s homes. 
This is wrong, and I call on the Presi-
dent of the United States personally to 
undo this. He is encouraging unlawful 
behavior that is inherently dangerous 
and is inherently threatening. 
This radical bill that has emerged in 
the days immediately following the 
leak of the Dobbs draft opinion is 
shrouded in the lie of protecting wom-
en’s health while allowing for killing 
babies by any means, however grue-
some, violent, atrocious, heinous, or 
cruel, right up until the moment of 
birth, preempting any State laws that 
might choose to protect life. Those 
late-term abortions not only kill viable 
babies, but they are unreasonably 
needlessly cruel, and they are ex-
tremely dangerous procedures for the 
mothers themselves. 
Unlimited abortion is also widely un-
popular. Only 17 percent of Americans 
believe that is the right policy. Among 
medical professionals, the feelings are 
similar. Research shows that over one- 
third of OB–GYNs in America would 
not even refer a patient for an abor-
tion. But this bill as written would re-
quire those same doctors not only to 
refer but also to provide abortions or 
risk 
their 
employment, 
notwith-
standing any ethical objection they 
may have to it, notwithstanding any 
religious objection they may have to 
it. 
By waiving the Religious Freedom 
Restoration Act, carving it out—the 
Religious Freedom Restoration Act, or 
RFRA, as it is known, a religious lib-
erty protection enacted by an over-
whelming supermajority of Democrats 
and Republicans—this bill would re-
quire hospitals and healthcare workers 
to perform abortions in violation of 
their own religious convictions. 
With this bill, Democrats in the 
House and the Senate are attempting 
to take this issue away from the peo-
ple, away from the States, and force 
their radical abortion agenda on the 
American people as a whole. Now, 
make no mistake, this is their vision 
for America, fully funded by the abor-
tion industry. It also perpetuates the 
tragedy of abortion—one that is a scar 
on our country’s history. 
I hope and pray that State legisla-
tures across the country will follow the 
example of the State of Utah and pass 
laws to protect the lives of preborn ba-
bies and their mothers. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana. 
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, every 
year in schools around our country, 
students are taught about the Declara-
tion of Independence. This remarkable 
document outlines the ideals on which 
the United States was founded and the 
principles on which our government 
and our very identity as Americans are 
based. 
Perhaps the best known and most 
quoted line from the Declaration is 
that line about all being endowed by 
their Creator with certain unalienable 
rights, that among these are life, lib-
erty, and the pursuit of happiness. 
From our earliest days—when such a 
concept truly was revolutionary—to 
the present day, as Americans, we be-
lieve in the dignity and value of every 
human person. This is an ideal that we 
should always aspire to. And in the 
spirit of that conviction, I believe that 
our Nation has a moral responsibility 
to protect unborn children—to protect 
life. 
Through 
amazing 
advances 
in 
science, families and medical profes-
sionals now know that at 15 weeks, a 
baby can feel pain; a baby can move 
fully formed fingers and toes; a baby 
has a fully developed heart, pumping 26 
quarts of blood per day. 
Despite what these advances in mod-
ern science tell us, the current abor-
tion policy in the United States is 
more in line with communist China 
and North Korea. We are only one of 
seven countries around the world that 
allow abortion to take place past the 
point at which a baby can feel pain in 
the womb—one of seven countries in 
the world. Some Americans might be 
surprised to learn that even in progres-
sive Europe, 47 out of 50 countries have 
limits on abortion after 15 weeks. 
Yet the legislation before the U.S. 
Senate would block States from pro-
tecting the unborn and enshrine late- 
term abortion into our Federal law. 
Going beyond codifying Roe v. Wade, 
this sweeping legislation would strike 
down commonsense, broadly supported 
laws that many States have adopted 
since that decision, including laws 
meant to protect the health and safety 
of mothers. This bill does nothing to 
protect 
the 
health 
and 
safety 
of 
women, and it would certainly not pro-
tect the unborn. And it would make 
these sweeping changes contrary to the 
wishes of the majority of Americans. 
In fact, recent polling found that 61 
percent of Americans say abortion 
should be either illegal or that the pol-
icy decisions associated with abortion 
should be left up to the States. 
So I would urge my colleagues to 
vote against this bill, given our in-
creased knowledge and understanding 
of how babies develop, given our under-
standing of the science. This is simply 
the wrong direction to take public pol-
icy. 
I also want to take a moment and ac-
knowledge that the issue of abortion is 
a very tough one for so many Ameri-
cans, and, given recent developments, 
this is a topic on the minds of many 
Hoosiers and many Americans. I under-
stand that. I want to reiterate my com-
mitment to helping mothers and fami-
lies choose life and supporting them in 
that choice. We must ensure mothers 
and unborn children are cared for, 
loved, and supported, and this includes 
increasing the resources available to 
help women facing unexpected preg-
nancies. We must support America’s 
2,700 pregnancy centers that provide 
vital services to millions of people each 
year at virtually no cost as well as pro-
vide more support for adoptive serv-
ices. 
These steps are vital as we seek to 
further promote a culture that pro-
motes values and protects life. Now, 
let’s remember and live up to that 
founding American ideal. We believe in 
the dignity and value of every human 
person. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MAR-
KEY). The Senator from Mississippi. 
Mr. WICKER. I commend the Senator 
from Indiana and join him and my 
other colleagues in decrying the legis-
lation that we will be asked to move to 
the floor tomorrow. But before I speak 
on the substance of the bill, it needs to 
be reiterated why this bill is even be-
fore us. 
The only reason we are debating this 
bill today is because of the extreme 
and unprecedented breach of protocol 
that took place at the Supreme Court. 
The leaked draft in the Dobbs case was 
a full-blown assault on the U.S. Su-
preme Court and on the independence 
of our judiciary. It was an attempt to 
incite mob pressure against the Jus-
tices, which has, in part, succeeded by 
inciting pressure against the Justices 
in an attempt to bully them into 
changing their final votes. 
And I do trust, based on the informa-
tion that we have about the nine Jus-
tices, that that attempt will not be 
successful. 
We saw over the weekend disturbing 
videos of protesters outside the homes 
of Supreme Court Justices. There is 
growing concern for the safety of our 
Supreme Court Justices and the safety 
of their families. 
This is shameful. A Supreme Court 
Justice should never have to fear for 
his or her safety or the safety of their 
families for doing their jobs. We, as 
elected Members of the Congress, are 
subject to public opinion. The Supreme 
Court is not supposed to be subject to 
public opinion and should never have 
to fear for their safety. 
The leak and the mob reaction 
should be condemned by both parties in 
the strongest possible terms, and yet 
there have been very few voices on the 
other side of the aisle addressing this 
matter. Certainly, the majority leader 
of the Senate has not said a word about 
the outrage of the leak or the mob pro-
tests, nor has the President of the 
United States. 
What happened to respect and care 
for our institutions? 
Instead of protecting the Court, our 
Democratic friends seem to be, whether 
inadvertently or not, legitimizing this 
attack on the Court by moving to con-
sider extreme legislation which is out 
of touch with the mainstream of Amer-
icans. 
So now let me speak briefly about 
the legislation. It has been said that

May 10, 2022 
this is a mere codification of the 
Court’s holding in Roe v. Wade. That 
is, in fact, not the case. Instead, the 
bill that we will be asked to move to 
the floor tomorrow is an attempt to ex-
pand abortion dramatically across this 
country, to expand abortion in a way 
that only a small handful of the most 
repressive governments on the face of 
the Earth permit. 
The bill would eliminate even the 
most modest protections for unborn 
children across all 50 States. It would 
force all 50 States to allow gruesome 
late-term abortions that even the po-
litical left all over Europe have long 
ago outlawed. 
As my friend from Indiana said ear-
lier, some 47 European countries gen-
erally ban abortion after the first 15 
weeks. Banning abortion after 14 weeks 
are our allies of France and Spain; ban-
ning abortion after 13 weeks, Finland; 
banning abortion after 12 weeks, Ger-
many, Belgium, Italy, Switzerland— 
certainly not governments that are 
thought of as prisoners of the extreme 
right. The nation of Portugal generally 
bans abortion after 10 weeks. 
Of course, as we know, the Mis-
sissippi law that brought this case to 
the Supreme Court, the Dobbs case, has 
a slightly more permissive provision 
than even these friends that I just 
mentioned from Western Europe. It 
would be a 15-week ban. 
But this bill that we are asked to 
vote on tomorrow, which certainly will 
fail, would push America further out-
side of the global mainstream than we 
already are—and we already are way 
outside this mainstream. 
Because of scientific advances, we 
know that an unborn child’s heartbeat 
begins at 6 weeks. We know a child can 
feel pain as early as 20 weeks. Many of 
us, including my wife and I, have put 
the sonograms of our grandchildren, 
have displayed them on our refrig-
erators in our homes. What we know 
about the development of children— 
their 
faces, 
their 
eyelashes—has 
brought about a change in the minds of 
many Americans. 
In 1996, 56 percent of Americans 
called themselves pro-choice. Only 33 
percent said they were pro-life. But be-
cause of science and because of those 
sonograms and because of what we 
know about their ability to feel pain— 
their movements, their eyes blinking, 
their eyelashes—today the two sides 
are just about evenly split, pro-choice 
and pro-life. But even those who iden-
tify themselves as pro-choice are deep-
ly opposed to late-term abortions. And 
make no mistake about it, if somehow 
the Schumer bill tomorrow were to 
pass, late-term abortions would be 
legal in all 50 States. 
Eighty-one 
percent 
of 
Americans 
think that late-term abortions should 
be illegal. Our friends on the Demo-
cratic side should think about that. 
This bill goes against 81 percent of 
American public opinion in that re-
gard. Sixty-five percent say abortions 
should be illegal in the second tri-
mester—not the third trimester, in the 
second trimester—65 percent of Ameri-
cans. 
I hope our Democratic friends across 
the aisle think about that before they 
vote for this extreme piece of legisla-
tion brought by the Democratic leader, 
which would put us in league with the 
People’s Republic of China with all of 
their respect for life, with North Korea 
with its deplorable record of respecting 
human life. With those two countries 
and five others on the extreme left, it 
would put us in league with them. That 
is not where the American people want 
us to be. 
If a State has a 24-hour waiting pe-
riod, for example, the Schumer bill to-
morrow would outlaw that. Taxpayer 
funding of abortion, the Hyde amend-
ment, which prohibits this and has 
done so for decades and decades, would 
be abolished. The parental rights of 
teenage girls to have a say and to be 
able to counsel their daughters on the 
pivotal decision about having an abor-
tion would be eliminated by this. 
Religious exemptions. A practicing 
Catholic, who deep in their soul under-
stands this to be infanticide, would be 
required, if they are a physician, to 
perform an abortion with no religious 
exemption. 
Is that what my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle are hoping for? It 
is what they would get if the Schumer 
bill were to pass. 
This is not a serious attempt at con-
sensus building. This bill simply re-
flects, regrettably, the iron grip that 
Planned Parenthood has on one of our 
major political parties in this country. 
We will reject this effort tomorrow. I 
commend my colleagues who intend to 
stand with the American people and 
vote no on this attempt to rank us 
with the worst regimes on the face of 
the globe and impose late-term abor-
tions on the entire country. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wisconsin. 
Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I am 
on the floor here today to address the 
same topic as my colleague who just 
spoke. And before I jump into prepared 
remarks, I wanted to offer just a few 
points of rebuttal because on this topic 
it seems so frequently that we all talk 
past each other and don’t generally lis-
ten to one another. 
The Women’s Health Protection Act 
of 2022, which I lead with Senator 
BLUMENTHAL, would, indeed, codify Roe 
v. Wade, but it would additionally give 
clarity to the States about what fur-
ther restrictions they could put in 
place. 
I hail from the State of Wisconsin, 
where 
our 
State 
legislature, 
over 
many, many years, has brought forth 
all sorts of measures—some of which 
have been signed into law, many of 
which have been challenged in court, 
and some of which have been vetoed— 
but these are restrictions on access to 
comprehensive 
reproductive 
healthcare, including abortion care, 
that limit access, that make it much 
more difficult, which is what Roe v. 
Wade intended to prevent. They have 
nothing to do with the health or the 
life of the mother. In fact, in some 
cases, they actually do harm to mater-
nal life and health. 
There are measures in places across 
the United States that deal with the 
corridor width of clinics—the corridor 
width. It would force, if these laws 
were to go into effect, many clinics to 
have to either reconstruct themselves 
or move. This is clearly something 
meant to limit access. 
There are laws and bills that relate 
to admitting privileges at local hos-
pitals, which are absolutely not medi-
cally necessary and will allow all the 
area hospitals to team up to deny those 
privileges, and then the clinic won’t 
have a physician able to work there. 
There are 24-hour waiting periods. 
I listened to what my colleague had 
to say about the blanket overturning 
of Roe v. Wade. It would mean, when a 
woman’s life is in jeopardy at some 
point in her pregnancy, she wouldn’t 
have the ability to save her life and her 
reproductive 
health 
because 
she 
wouldn’t have access to abortion care. 
Then to characterize this bill as ex-
treme, in my mind, is so opposite the 
truth because, to me, what is extreme 
is forcing, say, a teen to bring a rap-
ist’s child to term or forcing a young 
woman to give birth to her sibling in 
cases of incest. 
My colleague talked about the polls. 
I don’t know what he was looking at. 
He was talking about pro-choice versus 
anti-choice. Everything I have seen 
shows that the overwhelming majority 
of Americans believes that Roe v. Wade 
is settled law and should remain in 
place and that only a small percentage 
believes it should be overturned in its 
entirety. 
In going on to my prepared remarks, 
I rise today to join my colleague Sen-
ator RICHARD BLUMENTHAL in support 
of the Women’s Health Protection Act 
of 2022—a bill that would protect a 
woman’s right to access safe abortion 
care throughout the United States, no 
matter where she lives, without unnec-
essary and unwanted political inter-
ference. 
Congress is responsible for enforcing 
every American’s fundamental rights 
guaranteed 
by 
our 
Constitution. 
Throughout history, when States have 
passed laws that make it harder or 
even 
impossible 
to 
exercise 
those 
rights, Congress has taken action to 
put in place Federal protections. 
I want to remind my colleagues of 
this responsibility. I also want to share 
a story from one of my constituents. 
Angela and Abby, her wife, knew 
they wanted to start a family, so they 
sought treatment at a fertility clinic 
in Wisconsin. In 2019, after years of try-
ing, Angela became pregnant. It was a 
pregnancy they had wanted more than 
anything, but Angela soon found out 
that she had what is called a molar 
pregnancy. This occurs when a tumor

forms instead of a healthy placenta. 
Her pregnancy was not viable. Her doc-
tors moved quickly, and Angela had a 
safe and legal abortion. 
She wrote to me earlier this week: 
Had abortion been illegal, I would have 
died. 
Access to a safe abortion saved 
Angela’s life. For others, an abortion 
kept a family out of poverty or allowed 
them to complete their educations or 
start careers. Abortions have protected 
women from being tied to their rapists 
and have spared them of the emotional 
and physical trauma of carrying an 
unviable pregnancy to term. 
I was only 10 years old when Roe v. 
Wade was decided. For 50 years, just 
about, this decision has stood. In the 
words of Justice Kavanaugh, it is ‘‘set-
tled as a precedent of the Supreme 
Court,’’ 
but, 
apparently, 
precedent 
means nothing. Access to safe and legal 
abortion is under direct attack as an 
activist Supreme Court appears poised 
to legislate from the bench and take a 
constitutionally protected right away 
from tens of millions of Americans. 
For women like Angela, the gravity 
of this draft decision from the Supreme 
Court cannot be overstated. Americans 
can remember when back alley abor-
tions 
killed 
and 
sterilized 
women 
across the country. This decision, if fi-
nalized, will not stop abortions from 
happening; it will only prevent safe 
abortions from happening. It will dis-
proportionately impact poor women 
and women of color, who will not have 
the privilege of making their own 
healthcare decisions. If Roe is over-
turned, 13 States would immediately 
ban abortions, and others, of course, 
would move to do so. 
If Roe is overturned and we don’t 
pass the Women’s Health Protection 
Act, Wisconsin women will be taken 
back to the mid-1800s. What do I mean 
by that? We have a law on our books in 
Wisconsin which criminalizes abortion 
procedures. If Roe is overturned, doc-
tors in Wisconsin would be charged 
with felonies for performing abortions 
and face up to 6 years in prison and 
$10,000 in fines. The rights of victims of 
rape and incest would be taken away. 
The right for women to choose for 
themselves and their families would be 
taken away. 
I sure am not taking women in Wis-
consin back to 1849, and we cannot 
allow an activist Supreme Court to 
leave this generation of women behind 
with fewer rights than their mothers 
and their grandmothers enjoyed. 
The Women’s Health Protection Act 
is the only bill that can put an end to 
the restrictive State laws that have al-
ready put thousands of women in jeop-
ardy. The legislation meets the urgent 
need to protect the provider, patient 
relationship; to protect the healthcare 
professionals who provide care; and to 
protect the freedom and constitutional 
rights of women to access this care. 
I believe a woman’s right to choose is 
protected under the Constitution, and 
so does a clear majority of Americans 
want Roe v. Wade to be upheld. It is 
our responsibility to take action for 
women like Angela and on behalf of the 
American people. 
I urge my colleagues to vote yes on 
the motion to proceed to the Women’s 
Health Protection Act of 2022. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Minnesota. 
Ms. SMITH. I thank Senator BALD-
WIN for her thoughtful remarks. 
Mr. President, I rise today in support 
of the Women’s Health Protection Act, 
and I urge my colleagues to join us in 
standing up for fundamental rights to 
freedom, 
autonomy, 
and 
self-deter-
mination. 
Make no mistake: That is what this 
vote is about—who has the power; who 
has the freedom to decide when your 
own health, livelihood, and life are on 
the line. 
There is nothing more American 
than the values of freedom and indi-
vidual autonomy; yet the U.S. Supreme 
Court is about to declare that women 
in this country are not guaranteed the 
freedom to make their own private de-
cisions about abortion. 
Justice Alito, MITCH
MCCONNELL, 
Senate Republicans, and radical Repub-
lican State legislators around the 
country believe that they should have 
the power—that they know better than 
American women, whose lives and sto-
ries they will never know. 
To that, I say: How dare they? 
When I worked at Planned Parent-
hood, I saw firsthand the capacity of 
women to make good decisions about 
their health, their bodies, and their 
lives. To suggest otherwise is insulting 
to the dignity of women as full, adult 
human beings and as equal citizens of 
this Nation, but that is where we are. 
Justice Alito’s draft opinion is a wake- 
up call and a call to action. Reading 
his opinion was like a gut punch, but it 
was not a surprise, and it didn’t just 
happen. 
This is the result of a decades’ long 
campaign by Republicans and their 
dark money donors to put anti-choice 
Justices on the Supreme Court, to 
overturn Roe, and to strip women of 
their constitutional rights. This is why 
this vote is so important. For the first 
time in my living memory, the Su-
preme Court is about to take away a 
fundamental constitutional right, and 
it is important that Americans see who 
is on their side and who is responsible 
for this. 
Extremist Republicans have been 
working for this goal for decades; yet, 
now that this moment is almost here, 
they keep trying to change the subject. 
In fact, they want to talk about any-
thing but, including when they spread 
misleading information about what the 
Women’s Health Protection Act would 
really do, which is to put the protec-
tions of Roe into statute. 
So why are Republicans running from 
this issue after having campaigned on 
it for years? 
Well, it is because Americans don’t 
want to overturn Roe, and anti-choice 
Republicans know this. They know 
that they are on the wrong side of his-
tory and on the wrong side of public 
opinion and of over half the American 
electorate. That is why this vote is so 
important. We will not let them dodge 
their responsibility for this outrageous 
attack on women’s freedom. 
Now, some Republicans are saying 
that this is all a bit of a tempest in a 
teapot. They say: Don’t worry. All the 
Supreme Court is about to do is to 
hand power back for the States to de-
cide on abortion. 
Colleagues, do not believe this. The 
American 
people 
deserve 
to 
know 
where this goes next. 
Today, we are fighting on the Senate 
floor to preserve in law the basic pro-
tections of Roe v. Wade, but extremist 
Republicans have been clear. Their end 
goal is to secure a nationwide ban on 
abortion. As Senator MCCONNELL said 
this weekend: It is not a secret that 
the Senate Republican caucus is op-
posed to reproductive rights and that, 
if Senate Republicans win the major-
ity, a nationwide ban is ‘‘worthy of de-
bate.’’ 
That is the post-Roe future if Repub-
licans are in charge. 
Even though a majority of Americans 
in all States believes that abortion 
should be legal, Republicans have been 
clear that a nationwide ban is their 
goal. At the same time, Republican 
State legislators are brazenly moving 
forward. They are moving forward with 
extremist policies that go way beyond 
depriving women of their essential 
freedoms—they punish and criminalize 
women. 
Take, for example, a Missouri mother 
of two, facing a high-risk pregnancy, 
who travels to Illinois for an abortion 
because she is worried about being 
there for her existing children. Mis-
souri Republicans want her to be la-
beled as a felon when she returns 
homes. 
Take a woman in Louisiana who has 
an abortion after her IUD failed and 
she had an unexpected pregnancy. Lou-
isiana Republicans want her convicted 
of homicide. 
Take the Texas woman, who hoped 
and prayed for years for a baby, only to 
have her doctor find a fatal fetal anom-
aly at 22 weeks. Texas Republicans 
want her to carry that pregnancy for 
another 18 weeks, no matter the risk to 
her life and no matter the trauma she 
faces as people congratulate her on her 
upcoming baby when she knows she 
will never know that child. 
So I say again, how dare these Re-
publicans think that they know better 
than the women who live these stories. 
This is the post-Roe world that Re-
publicans want, and we won’t stand for 
it. If you think this struggle doesn’t af-
fect you or someone you care about, 
think again. 
One in four American women will 
have an abortion—women who are 
Democrats, Republicans, Independents, 
women from all places and all religious 
faiths. For these women, abortion isn’t

about politics; it is about healthcare. 
Most of them never expected to be part 
of this statistic, but life doesn’t always 
go as we plan. Every day, women deal 
with situations they never imagined, 
and they deserve the freedom and the 
autonomy to decide for themselves 
what to do and what is best for them. 
With this vote to pass the Women’s 
Health Protection Act, we are showing 
whom we stand with and what we be-
lieve—the fundamental freedom of peo-
ple to make the best decisions for their 
health, their families, and their fu-
tures. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent for the following 
Senators to be permitted to speak prior 
to the scheduled vote: myself for 20 
minutes, Senator TOOMEY for 5 min-
utes, and Senator BROWN for 5 minutes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I am 
not sure I will use all 20 minutes, but 
you never know on a subject this im-
portant and this vital to women and 
families across the America. It may 
take a little more than a few minutes 
to talk about this issue, and that is 
that 70 percent of Americans believe 
that we should not overturn Roe v. 
Wade or a woman’s right to her own re-
productive choice. 
This is so critical that 70 percent of 
Americans are in agreement. This was 
part of a Pew Research report. Twenty- 
five percent don’t agree, and about 5 
percent are not sure what they think. 
But anybody who thinks this isn’t 
about settled law or about mainstream 
views in America is wrong because it is 
about almost 50 years of settled law, 
and it is about what mainstream Amer-
icans believe are their constitutional 
rights. That is why it is so important 
for us to listen to those Americans and 
their long-held beliefs, starting with 
the laws that we got from England and 
baked into our Constitution, the right 
to privacy. 
Yes, people are right. The word ‘‘pri-
vacy’’ isn’t mentioned, but it is in var-
ious amendments believed to be rights 
within the Constitution. But we have a 
Supreme Court made up of men and Ivy 
League institutions who now discuss in 
a decision—we don’t really know ex-
actly where it came from—this notion 
that privacy and a woman’s right to 
her own reproductive choice somehow 
doesn’t deserve stare decisis—that is, 
predicated on previous law—and some-
how isn’t in the Constitution. 
Well, I have got news for a lot of peo-
ple. If you have a Supreme Court that 
is going to take a run and run from pri-
vacy in the Constitution, as this deci-
sion does—as this decision does—it 
barely mentions the case law predi-
cated that made decisions about a 
woman’s right to privacy based on 
those issues. It is barely mentioned. 
Now, I am sure it is because those 
Justices decided, if they had to agree 
that privacy was really there as a 
right, which we as Americans believe it 
is—against the government’s unwar-
ranted search and seizure on you, the 
government spying on you, the govern-
ment taking action against you that 
has not been followed in law—you 
know, I spent 2 years on the Judiciary 
Committee, and I really couldn’t be-
lieve this. 
Somebody told me—actually, a con-
servative judge passed this information 
on. If you ask them whether they be-
lieve in Roe v. Wade or settled law, 
they will tell you: Oh, yeah, it has been 
there. But if you ask them whether 
they believe in rights to privacy enu-
merated in the Constitution and do 
they believe in the penumbra of rights 
that basically give us this right that 
Griswold v. Connecticut, that Casey v. 
Planned Parenthood was decided on, a 
true, true conservative who wasn’t 
going to uphold the law will tell you 
they didn’t believe in that. 
So that is the conundrum. We had a 
bunch of the smartest guys in the room 
from Ivy League schools who came 
here and hoodwinked the Senate, say-
ing things like: Oh, I will follow or I 
think stare decisis is very important. 
Yet the same people are about to put 
their name on a document that says we 
don’t really think there is any strong 
holding here. We don’t think there is 
any strong case. Well, there is a case. 
There is a case for privacy. 
I remember my first days on the Ju-
diciary 
Committee, 
when 
John 
Ashcroft, then-Attorney General, tried 
to come before the committee and 
make light of the fact that the govern-
ment was spying on Americans. When I 
said to him: Mr. Ashcroft, this is a seri-
ous issue of the FBI and others using 
software technology to spy on the lives 
of Americans, he said: You remind me 
of a joke. 
I couldn’t believe it. I remind him of 
a joke? And he went on to tell the 
story about how a little boy sat on 
Santa Claus’s lap, and he said: I know 
whether you have been bad or good. 
And he says: Oh, you are not a Santa 
Claus; you are John Ashcroft. He 
thought this was hilarious, and I re-
minded him that not everybody in 
America was laughing. 
Now look at where we are, 20-some 
years later, fast-forwarding on the 
rights to privacy that we have in the 
United States and how every day we 
have to fight for those rights to pri-
vacy. 
I know the Presiding Officer knows 
this because he has joined me on these 
issues, particularly as it relates to 
children’s online privacy issues and so 
many other issues that this body and 
this institution are going to have to 
decide on, but Americans know—70 per-
cent of them agree that this is a main-
stream, settled issue and now are 
shocked to find that, somehow, some-
body is proposing something to over-
turn it. 
I am not even sure people under-
stand. I just had a conversation with 
somebody who said: Oh, you mean they 
are going to give some rights to men in 
determining the pregnancy and some 
rights for women? 
I said: No. They are talking about 
making abortion illegal. They are talk-
ing about passing a law that takes the 
reproductive rights and choices of 
women and turns them back into the 
dark ages. 
This person got it right away. They 
said: Who do you want caring for 
women—someone in a back alley or a 
trained healthcare professional? 
That is really what we are talking 
about here. American healthcare tech-
nology has come to the point that 
women who do not want an unwanted 
pregnancy can have the choice of a 
morning after pill. There are lots of 
different ways for them to deal with 
planned and unplanned pregnancies. 
Yet this institution wants to tell them, 
by the Supreme Court, that they don’t 
have a privacy right; that it doesn’t 
exist; that Connecticut v. Griswold, 
which, if you think about it, was about 
contraception—it 
was 
really 
about 
whether women at the time had the 
right to have contraception and plan 
pregnancies. 
I know the Presiding Officer knows 
about this time period. We both come 
from big families. We know all about 
big families. 
All of a sudden, in that decision, in 
Connecticut v. Griswold, the right to 
privacy—the penumbra of rights within 
the Constitution—was determined to 
say that women have the right to con-
trol their bodies and have contracep-
tion. The fact that this is not the basis 
of upholding the law after almost 50 
years—I can’t even explain how unbe-
lievable it is that somebody would not 
fully discuss and cite it. And if they 
don’t believe in the penumbra—but I 
am guessing the reason they don’t 
want to even discuss the penumbra of 
rights is because they know darn well 
we live in an age and time in which pri-
vacy needs utmost protection, and in-
dividuals need people like us to be vot-
ing for things that are going to protect 
individuals’ rights of privacy in the era 
of big government, of big corporations, 
of undue intrusions in, yes, even our 
own healthcare. We need protection. 
We are now here talking, though, 
about overturning these rights that af-
fect the healthcare lives of women. We 
are not talking about the healthcare of 
men. We are not sitting here—I can’t 
tell you how many times in the last 15 
years that I have been here that every 
budget decision, every major almost- 
going-over-the-fiscal-cliff when John 
Boehner was the Speaker—oh, if we 
don’t have a vote to get rid of a wom-
an’s right to choose—every budget 
issue down to the last wire is always 
about whether you are going to get rid 
of a woman’s right to choose. It has 
been the fight of the other side of the 
aisle all along to try to say they are 
going to control women’s bodies and 
women’s healthcare choices. 
We know that you are not going to 
get rid of abortions if you pass this

May 10, 2022 
law. You are not going to get rid of 
them. When we passed Connecticut v. 
Griswold and Casey, that is when we 
basically went down the road of mak-
ing sure that women weren’t killed in 
back alley abortions. We actually 
saved lives of women, and we started 
getting people to take care of planned 
pregnancies and make progress of hav-
ing people on contraception. 
We are not going to get rid of abor-
tions by listening to the Supreme 
Court or passing something. They will 
happen. It will go back to any back 
alley approach or other issues to try to 
deal with it. 
So I ask my colleagues: What are you 
thinking when you are advocating for a 
return to pre-Roe? What exactly do you 
think is going to happen in the United 
States of America? I can tell you, you 
are going to leave women without the 
ability to control their own bodies, 
without the ability for them and their 
doctor to make decisions. 
So many of these issues are about 
that woman and her doctor making a 
decision. You know, we make laws to 
deal with the parameters and the ex-
ceptions to the rule. This is a process 
by which we have laid out what we 
think is reproductive healthcare choice 
and then directed people to deal with 
their physician on these issues. But the 
other side would like to take these 
issues to the extreme and say that 
women have gone too far on their own 
healthcare choices. 
I guarantee you, there are many 
times where it is a decision between 
the life of the mother and the life of a 
child. Do we really want government 
making that decision, or do we want 
the 
physician 
and 
the 
individual 
woman making that decision? 
I ask my colleagues: Do you believe 
the right to privacy exists within the 
Constitution or are you like the Su-
preme Court? You don’t believe in the 
decisions of previous Supreme Court 
Justices? You don’t think they have 
solid standing because you don’t be-
lieve that privacy is a long-held view of 
the United States? I guarantee you, it 
is fundamental to who we are as a 
country, and it is fundamental to who 
we are today and why individual 
women should have that right and have 
that protection. 
But people aren’t even thinking 
about the broader impacts. Secretary 
Yellen testified today: 
Eliminating the right of women to make 
decisions about when and whether to have 
children would have very damaging effects 
on the economy and would set women back 
decades. Roe v. Wade . . . enabled many 
women to finish school and increase their 
earning potential. 
No one has even talked about exactly 
how this would work. I am confused 
about how it would work State by 
State. I will also tell you, this Supreme 
Court really—I don’t even know what 
to say about it except for when I inter-
viewed one of the Supreme Court Jus-
tices, who I am pretty sure is making 
this decision—I said: This is very im-
portant to the State of Washington be-
cause the people of the State of Wash-
ington have voted to make Roe v. Wade 
the law of our State. 
And he said: Oh, Senator, Senator, 
you are mistaken. 
I said: I am mistaken about my 
State, about what happened? 
He said: You mean your legislature 
voted. 
I said: No, sir, the people in my State 
voted by initiative in the nineties to 
codify these rights into our State law 
because that is what the people of my 
State believe. 
So the arrogance of this Court, you 
can see, continues not to listen to the 
views of 70 percent of Americans. 
I believe that you should be able to 
ask Justices what their judicial opin-
ion and philosophy is. They should tell 
you. If these Justices did not believe 
that this was the law of the land and 
should be upheld, if they didn’t believe 
in these rights of privacy, they should 
have told everybody clearly. 
But it is hardly in the mainstream 
view of Americans. 
Tomorrow we will have a chance to 
say whether we believe in these privacy 
rights, whether we believe in a wom-
an’s reproductive choices, whether we 
believe that 50 years—just about 50 
years—and 70 percent of the American 
people are worth listening to. I would 
listen and pass this legislation tomor-
row because I guarantee you, if it is 
not just this privacy right, why are you 
going to trust them on any other pri-
vacy decision in the future if they are 
not going to be fighting to uphold your 
privacy rights on women’s reproductive 
health? 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania. 
NOMINATION OF LISA DENELL COOK 
Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise 
today to speak on the nomination of 
Professor Lisa Cook to serve as a Gov-
ernor of the Federal Reserve Board. 
Two weeks ago, Senate Democrats 
tried to cancel the vote that was sched-
uled on Professor Cook’s nomination. 
In his floor remarks, the chairman of 
the Banking Committee stated that 
Senate Republicans have been ‘‘AWOL 
in the fight against inflation for 
months.’’ The irony of that, of course, 
is that it was Democrats who wanted 
to cancel the vote. Republicans were 
ready to vote and not just on Professor 
Cook, mind you. We wanted to vote on 
the other Fed nominees as well. I ob-
jected to canceling the vote because we 
were ready to vote, and we wanted to 
vote, so the vote took place. 
Professor Cook’s nomination failed 
that day on a procedural vote by a 
margin 47 to 51. Then, immediately 
after that, I asked consent to vote on 
the two remaining Fed nominees who 
have been processed in the committee 
but haven’t been voted on. Those would 
be Chairman Jerome Powell, who has 
been nominated to be Chairman again, 
and Professor Philip Jefferson, who 
both could have been confirmed to the 
Fed that day, as they could have been 
confirmed months ago. 
But the Democrats objected to us 
having a vote a couple of weeks ago. It 
is really pretty amazing. Let me just 
be clear for the record. The Democrats 
hold the majority. The Democrats con-
trol the schedule on the Senate floor. 
And our Democratic colleagues have 
tied up for months the nominations of 
multiple nominees, including two— 
two—Fed nominees who have either 
unanimous or very nearly unanimous 
support. That is Jerome Powell and 
Philip Jefferson. 
So if confirming Fed nominees is so 
important 
to 
our 
Democratic 
col-
leagues in the fight against inflation, 
it makes you wonder about this strat-
egy of canceling votes and not holding 
votes when Republicans have been try-
ing to confirm the nominees. 
But I have a theory as to why this is, 
and I think it is because our Demo-
cratic colleagues know that Professor 
Cook is simply unqualified to serve as 
a Governor of the Federal Reserve 
Board. They don’t want to leave her 
stranded as the final Fed nominee after 
all the other nominees get confirmed, 
so they are holding the nominations of 
Chairman Powell and Professor Jeffer-
son hostage in order to push through 
their preferred candidate, their top pri-
ority. 
I want to address this specific point 
that the chairman has made in the past 
because he has made this several times. 
He has suggested that somehow Repub-
licans oppose Professor Cook’s nomina-
tion because she is a Black woman. Let 
me just be as clear as I can. That is a 
very offensive charge to make. It is ac-
tually outrageous. It is also blatantly 
and demonstrably false. 
In this Congress alone—a little over 1 
year—Banking 
Republicans 
have 
unanimously supported eight Black 
nominees, six of whom were women: 
Cecilia Rouse, the first Black woman 
to serve as Chair of the CEA; Nuria 
Fernandez; Alexia Latortue; Adrianne 
Todman; Alanna McCargo; Ventris Gib-
son, the first Black woman to serve as 
Director of the U.S. Mint. Republican 
Banking Committee members voted 
unanimously in favor of confirming 
each of those six Black women, but we 
still hear this absurd and outrageous 
charge. 
Philip Jefferson—if our Democratic 
colleagues ever allow us to have a vote 
on him—will be the fourth Black man 
to serve as a Fed Governor. He was 
voted out of the committee 24 to 0. 
Let me just be very clear. Banking 
Committee Republicans didn’t support 
these nominees because of the color of 
their skin; that is not the criteria by 
which we evaluate candidates. We sup-
ported them because each of them was 
qualified for the roles to which they 
were nominated. Frankly, that ought 
to be the criteria for evaluating any 
nominee, if you ask me, including Pro-
fessor Cook. 
So let me address some of the argu-
ments you are likely to hear regarding 
Professor Cook’s qualifications.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2405 
May 10, 2022 
First of all, my Democratic col-
leagues like to point to Professor 
Cook’s extensive educational attain-
ments as evidence of her qualifications. 
She was a Marshall Scholar and a Tru-
man Scholar, she was. She attended 
Spelman College, Oxford, and obtained 
a Ph.D. in economics from UC Berke-
ley. 
There is no question, these are im-
pressive credentials, but they do not, 
by themselves, qualify her—or anyone 
else for that matter—to serve as the 
governor of the Fed, especially at a 
time when we need a Fed that is able 
and willing to tackle 40-year-high in-
flation that is devastating American 
families every single day. 
Now, our Democratic colleagues have 
claimed that Professor Cook is ‘‘a lead-
ing economist’’ with years of experi-
ence in ‘‘monetary policy, banking, and 
financial crises.’’ But those claims are 
simply untrue. 
First of all, 75 percent of Professor 
Cook’s assignment at Michigan State, 
including her tenure, is in the inter-
national relations department; it is not 
even in economics. Second, her experi-
ence in monetary policy is literally 
nonexistent. Not a single one of her 
publications concerns monetary eco-
nomics. 
When asked to highlight for the 
banking committee her top works on 
monetary policy, she provided one, a 
book chapter on Nigerian bank reforms 
published 11 years ago. According to 
the White House, her main qualifica-
tion on monetary policy is her service 
as a member of the Chicago Fed’s 
Board of Directors. 
She joined the Chicago Fed’s Board 2 
weeks before President Biden nomi-
nated her to serve as a Fed governor. 
Third, her experience handling finan-
cial crisis has basically been limited to 
writing a cursory overview of the 
Eurozone crisis during a brief stint 
working in the Obama White House and 
working in Africa over 20 years ago. 
Now, you don’t need to be a trained 
economist to serve on the Fed Board, 
necessarily; but if you are going to 
serve on the Fed Board, you do need to 
have some views on monetary policy. 
You would think that would be espe-
cially the case for someone who is an 
economist. 
Given 
Professor 
Cook’s 
glaring lack of experience in monetary 
policy, it perhaps is not surprising that 
Professor Cook has been unable to ar-
ticulate any opinion at all on how the 
Fed should tackle inflation. 
Throughout the nomination process, 
she repeatedly refused to endorse the 
Fed decision to pull back its ultra-easy 
money policy. She also refused to sug-
gest any alternative policy. And only 
on the actual day, while at her hearing, 
did she finally begrudgingly say that 
she agreed with the ‘‘Fed’s path right 
now as we are speaking.’’ 
Professor Cook’s answers to very 
basic questions about what the Fed 
should do to tame inflation—to para-
phrase the late Justice Scalia—amount 
to nothing more than logical apple-
sauce. Professor Cook has continued to 
insist she would need to be confirmed 
to the Fed Board before she can have a 
view on inflation, because in her words: 
‘‘We don’t have access to all the data 
that the Fed has.’’ And she also said: 
‘‘We don’t have access to the delibera-
tions at the time they are being 
made.’’ 
Now, these things are just bewil-
dering for someone who has been nomi-
nated to address the most pressing in-
flationary threat in nearly two genera-
tions. And let’s be clear, the Fed has no 
secret data as Professor Cook seems to 
believe. 
In fact, monetary policy, including 
the recent 41 percent increase in the 
money 
supply 
is 
extremely 
trans-
parent. Anyone who wants to know has 
all the data available to him or herself. 
Just about every economist in the 
country right now has an opinion about 
inflation. Every other nominee to the 
Federal Reserve has an opinion about 
inflation, including what to do about 
it. 
And since we know very little about 
her views on inflation, my grave con-
cern is that Professor Cook will serve 
as an inflation dove on the Fed at a 
time when American families continue 
to be ravaged by these price increases. 
But you don’t have to take it from 
me, Bloomberg Economics expressed 
concern with Professor Cook’s wishy- 
washy answers also, and they wrote: 
Asked if she would endorse the current 
rates trajectory, she did not provide a 
straight answer but said she would look at 
data once the decision point arrives. 
Another quote from their analysis: 
When asked how she would get inflation 
under control, she answered: By eliminating 
the risk of financial crisis. 
The American people deserve better 
than this. They deserve a serious nomi-
nee who understands monetary eco-
nomics, has a firm grasp on how to 
combat inflation and restore stable 
prices, and will serve without a polit-
ical agenda. 
So if Lisa Cook doesn’t have any ex-
pertise in monetary policy, then why 
would Democrats want her on the Fed 
Board? Well, that brings me to my sec-
ond point: Professor Cook’s history of 
extreme leftwing political advocacy 
and hostility to opposing viewpoints, 
which I think make her unfit to serve 
on the Fed. 
It is exceptionally important to keep 
politics out of monetary policy, but un-
fortunately, we have seen the en-
croachment of politics at the histori-
cally independent Federal Reserve. 
There are people on the left, includ-
ing in the Biden administration, who 
openly advocate that the Fed use its 
supervisory powers to resolve complex 
political issues, like what to do about 
global warming and social justice, even 
education policy. 
These are all very important issues, 
but they are wholly unrelated to the 
Fed’s limited statutory mandates and 
expertise. Professor Cook’s record indi-
cates that she is likely to inject fur-
ther political bias into the Fed Board 
at a time when we need the Fed to be 
focused on fighting inflation. 
In 
her 
statements 
or 
tweets, 
retweets, Professor Cook has supported 
race-based reparations, promoted con-
spiracies about Georgia voter laws, and 
sought to cancel those who disagree 
with her, with her views. She specifi-
cally and publicly called for the firing 
of an economist and colleague who 
dared to tweet that he was opposed to 
the idea of defunding the Chicago po-
lice. 
The fact is the Fed is already suf-
fering from a credibility problem be-
cause of its involvement in politics and 
its departure from its statutorily pro-
scribed role and its failure to keep in-
flation under control. I am concerned 
that Professor Cook will further politi-
cize an institution that really needs to 
get back to being apolitical. 
I urge my colleagues to vote against 
the nomination of Lisa Cook. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PETERS). The Senator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I have 
kind of heard it all today. I am not 
going to engage with the ranking mem-
ber when he calls her unqualified. We 
know this is about a history of this 
committee’s 
Republicans 
voting 
against very qualified African-Amer-
ican women. We have won that debate; 
we have won it with the American peo-
ple. 
And I was just handed—because I re-
membered this. I remembered hun-
dreds, literally hundreds, of prominent 
people in the economics field and out-
side the economics field that supported 
Lisa Cook, they wrote letters. We got 
more letters, I believe, for Lisa Cook 
than any nominee for the Fed. 
The ranking member knows, and he 
has voted for some pretty unqualified 
people, and that he would decide this is 
one he is voting against is just kind of 
sad. Let me give you some examples, 35 
Marshall and Truman Scholars are sup-
porting her—35; the National Bankers 
Association; Ben Bernanke, a Bush 
nominee who was chair of the Federal 
Reserve; all kinds of organizations, 
some political, some not political, 
many of them bank-based. 
I will send these to the ranking mem-
ber so he can get a look at them. I 
know he has already seen them before, 
but they seem to have slipped his mind. 
I urge my colleagues to support Dr. 
Cook. She teaches at Michigan State, 
the presiding officer’s proud institu-
tion. She would be a historic confirma-
tion to the Board of Governors, we 
know that. She understands how eco-
nomic policy affects all kinds of dif-
ferent people in different parts of the 
country, from the rural south where 
she grew up to the industrial Midwest 
where she built her career. One of the 
things I like about her, the Federal Re-
serve—I mean, I understand that eco-
nomic conservatives in this body—and 
I think the ranking member would 
probably define himself that way; I ad-
mire his courage in voting against—

voting for the removal of President 
Trump, so I admired his courage. I just 
think he is wrong on these kind of 
nominees. But I just—I look at her, and 
I see how—what I like—one of the 
things I like about her is the Fed, for 
years, has just practiced this top-down 
economic policy. The people that sit on 
the Fed, they almost all look like me, 
historically. 
In fact, Lisa Cook will be the first 
Black woman in 109 years ever to sit on 
the Fed, seven members of the Fed at 
any one time, and the terms are—usu-
ally they stay 5 to 10 years—so you can 
see how many people cycle in and out. 
But they almost all believe in this 
trickle-down economics that you give 
tax cuts to rich people and it will 
trickle down and the economy will be 
better. 
Well, Lisa Cook is different. She 
doesn’t come from the coast. She 
comes from what some people on the 
coast would call ‘‘flyover country,’’ 
Michigan or Ohio. She grew up in a 
small town in Georgia. 
She went to college at Spelman, one 
of the best schools in the country. She 
was a Marshall and a Truman Scholar 
in England. She got her Ph.D. at 
Berkeley, and now she is teaching at 
Michigan State. And that tells me she 
has a sense of this country. 
And he criticized her because of her 
emphasis on international relations. I 
like it that we have somebody at the 
Fed that not only knows the country, 
knows the great industrial Midwest in 
Michigan or Ohio—sort of the same in 
some ways. I like it that she studied on 
the west coast. I like it that she stud-
ied abroad. I like it that she spent time 
overseas learning about banking in ec-
onomics and other countries, instead of 
the cookie-cutter people we always get 
on the Federal Reserve. Someone very 
important, speaks very seriously, has a 
good Ivy League education, but they 
don’t know real people. And Lisa Cook 
knows real people. 
She has years of research and inter-
national experience with monetary pol-
icy, banking, and financial crises. She 
has served as an economist under ad-
ministrations to both parties, and as I 
said, she has support from across the 
political spectrum. All kinds of people 
endorsed her. They sent more letters 
supporting her than any Fed nom that 
I remember in front of this Banking 
Committee, and I have been on the 
Banking Committee a decade and a 
half. 
She has demonstrated her commit-
ment to Fed independence, the impor-
tance of making decisions based on 
fact. She agrees with Chair Powell that 
the Fed’s most important task right 
now is to tackle inflation. She believes: 
A strong and resilient financial system 
supports American families, businesses, and 
our economy. 
Those are her words. 
Take a moment again and let me go 
back to why this is historical: the first 
Black woman in 109 years to serve in 
the Federal Reserve. Think about that. 
Think about that: the first Black 
woman in 109 years. This country is 12 
percent Black. We have had dozens and 
dozens and dozens of Fed noms, yet we 
are going to need—probably need the 
Vice President to come in here and 
cast the tie-breaking vote because 
every single Republican, everybody on 
this side of the aisle, sitting behind 
every one of these desks is voting 
against 
the 
first 
African-American 
woman ever on the Federal Reserve. 
Spelman 
College, 
Truman 
Scholar, 
Marshall Scholar, Ph.D. at Berkeley, 
tenure at one of America’s great uni-
versities, Michigan State University— 
and they say she is not qualified? And 
Judy Shelton was? Really. 
She will protect the Fed’s independ-
ence. She knows that workers drive our 
economic growth. She, like this Presi-
dent, understands you focus on work-
ers, you put workers at the center of 
our economy. That is the kind of Fed 
governor she is going to be. She under-
stands when everyone participates in 
our economy, it grows faster and 
stronger for all Americans. 
We need her on the job today. I would 
add the other Senator from Michigan is 
here who has been a strong, strong sup-
porter of Professor Cook. I join my two 
colleagues from Michigan and every-
body on this side of the aisle to support 
Lisa Cook for the Federal Reserve.

Month’’ and honoring the significance of 
Irish Americans in the history and progress 
of the United States. 
There being no objection, the com-
mittee was discharged, and the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolution. 
Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the resolution being agreed 
to; that the Murphy amendment at the

preamble, was agreed to as follows: 
(Purpose: To amend the preamble) 
In the preamble, in the eighth whereas 
clause, strike ‘‘Chuck Feeney’’ and insert

The 
preamble, 
as

was 
agreed to. 
The resolution with its preamble, as 
amended, reads as follows: 
S. RES. 552 
Whereas, from the earliest days of the 
United States, the United States has in-
spired the hopes and dreams of countless in-
dividuals from around the world in search of 
a better life for themselves and their chil-
dren; 
Whereas more than 31,500,000 United States 
citizens trace their ancestry to Ireland; 
Whereas, since before the United States 
was founded, Irish men and women under-
took the perilous journey across the Atlantic 
Ocean to make a home in the United States, 
a place of hope and promise, and made ines-
timable contributions to the United States, 
both during the struggle for independence 
and after the founding of the republic; 
Whereas 9 of the 56 signatories of the Dec-
laration of Independence, 4 associate justices 
of the Supreme Court of the United States, 
and 22 Presidents proudly claim Irish herit-
age; 
Whereas Irish immigrants who came to the 
United States during the Great Famine of 
the 1840s helped transform cities in the 
United States, building them into dynamic 
centers of commerce and industry; 
Whereas the cultural, economic, and spir-
itual contributions of Irish immigrants con-
tinue to be evident today throughout the 
United States; 
Whereas Irish Americans have become 
deeply integrated into communities with 
strength, courage, wit, and creativity, mak-
ing significant contributions in all areas of 
life; 
Whereas Irish-American writers such as 
Eugene O’Neill, John O’Hara, and F. Scott 
Fitzgerald transformed literature in the 
United States, entrepreneurs like William 
Russell Grace helped revolutionize industry 
and philanthropy in the United States, per-
formers such as Gregory Peck, Lucille Ball, 
and Gene Kelly enriched the arts, and social 
reformers such as suffragist Leonora Barry 
and labor organizer Mary Kenney O’Sullivan 
fought for the rights of others; 
Whereas Irish Americans have served ably 
in communities in numerous capacities, in-
cluding in public safety and government at 
the Federal, State, and local levels, and in 
the Armed Forces in every war in which the 
United States has fought since the Revolu-
tionary War, including patriots such as 
Audie Murphy, the most decorated soldier of 
World War II; 
Whereas, more than 200 years ago, John 
Barry, who was born in Ireland, was the first 
naval hero of the Revolutionary War and be-
came known as the Father of the Navy; 
Whereas the United States played a promi-
nent role in support of negotiations of the 
Good Friday Agreement (also known as the 
Belfast Agreement), done at Belfast, April 10, 
1998, and has taken a leading role in pro-
moting peace on the island of Ireland more 
broadly; 
Whereas Congress greatly values the close 
relationships the United States shares with 
both the United Kingdom and Ireland and is 
steadfastly committed to supporting the 
peaceful resolution of any and all political 
challenges in Northern Ireland; and 
Whereas, on February 28, 2022, President 
Joseph R. Biden, Jr., proclaimed March 2022 
as Irish-American Heritage Month: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates March 2022 as ‘‘Irish-Amer-
ican Heritage Month’’; 
(2) recognizes the significant contributions 
of Irish Americans in the history and 
progress of the United States; and 
(3) supports the full implementation of the 
Good Friday Agreement (also known as the 
Belfast Agreement) and subsequent agree-
ments or arrangements for implementation 
of that Agreement to support peace on the 
island of Ireland.

WOMEN’S HEALTH PROTECTION 
ACT 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I 
rise to express the urgent need to pass 
the Women’s Health Protection Act 
and put an end to the constant attacks 
that have chipped away at women’s 
constitutional rights in this country. 
Now more than ever, it is vital to cod-
ify reproductive rights and protect 
other hard-won civil rights as they face 
renewed threats.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2408 
May 10, 2022 
draft opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson 
Women’s Health, which, while not 
final, would strike down Roe v. Wade. 
This would have an immediate and dev-
astating consequence for the health 
and well-being of tens of millions of 
women of reproductive age across the 
Nation. Women in low-income families 
who could not overcome the financial 
and logical barriers to travel to States 
with abortion access will suffer the 
most, increasing existing health dis-
parities. 
While this draft opinion is a reminder 
of what is at stake, we have seen the 
erosion of reproductive rights for dec-
ades. Despite the clear constitutional 
rights the Supreme Court established 
almost 50 years ago in the landmark 
Roe v. Wade decision, each year, legis-
latures across the country have passed 
harmful abortion restrictions in an ef-
fort to impede a woman’s fundamental 
right to make the best informed 
healthcare decisions for herself and her 
family. This goes against what I be-
lieve to be one of the fundamental re-
sponsibilities of the Court, which is to 
expand rights, not restrict them. 
Implementing the Bill of Rights, we 
have seen the Federal courts over a pe-
riod of time protect Americans against 
the abuse of power, including the power 
exercised by our government. Should 
this opinion go into effect, this would 
be the first time in memory that the 
Court would act to take away the con-
stitutional rights of Americans. It 
would also be the first time in our 
country’s history when women now 
would have fewer rights than their 
mothers. 
The reasoning used in this draft deci-
sion could also be used to undermine 
other dearly held civil rights in the fu-
ture. Justice Alito’s leaked draft opin-
ion laid out a roadmap to overturn 
other landmark decisions that ex-
panded rights, including Obergefell v. 
Hodges, 
which 
affirmed 
marriage 
equality. 
Justices Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and 
Barrett all testified under oath before 
the Senate Judiciary Committee that 
Supreme 
Court 
precedents 
should 
stand—a bedrock principle of jurispru-
dence known as stare decisis—but they 
clearly arrived with an agenda to over-
turn Roe, and now, they are making 
that a reality. 
Senate Republicans and former Presi-
dent Donald Trump bear responsibility 
for nominating and confirming Jus-
tices far outside of the legal main-
stream and damaging our confirmation 
process and the public’s faith in the 
Supreme Court as an impartial arbiter 
of our Nation’s laws. 
Senate 
Republicans 
deliberately 
stole the seat that President Barack 
Obama nominated Merrick Garland to 
fill, and they delayed even having a 
hearing for 1 year, effectively shrink-
ing the size of the Supreme Court. Sen-
ate Republicans then turned around 
and rushed the confirmation of Justice 
Amy Coney Barrett after the death of 
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, even 
though early voting had already begun 
in the 2020 Presidential elections. 
Overturning Roe goes against public 
opinion. A recent poll of the Wash-
ington Post-ABC showed that 70 per-
cent of Americans believe that the 
Court should uphold Roe and that deci-
sions regarding abortion should be left 
to a woman and her doctor. 
Now more than ever, it is essential 
for the Senate to pass the Women’s 
Health Protection Act, of which I am 
proud to be a cosponsor. The legisla-
tion would protect the right to abor-
tion free from medically unnecessary 
restrictions and create a statutory 
right for providers to provide and pa-
tients to receive care. This would cod-
ify Roe v. Wade and prevent States 
from continuing to enact restrictions 
on reproductive freedoms. 
Despite the opinion just being a draft 
and abortion still being a constitu-
tional right, States are already seizing 
on the momentum of this draft opinion 
and moving to limit a woman’s con-
stitutional right. Since the leak of this 
draft opinion, legislatures around the 
country are rushing to criminalize 
abortion and outlaw contraception. 
Just last week, the Louisiana State 
Legislature advanced a bill that would 
classify abortion as homicide. This 
adds to the over half of our States that 
have already passed laws to restrict 
and ban abortion access. There are 
more than one dozen States with anti- 
abortion laws set to take effect imme-
diately if the Supreme Court strikes 
down Roe v. Wade. 
The Republican leader, Mr. MCCON-
NELL, stated: 
If the leaked opinion became the final 
opinion, legislative bodies—not only at the 
state level but at the federal level—certainly 
could legislate in that area. 
Thanks to five unelected, activist 
Justices on the Supreme Court, women 
are facing the prospect of a Federal, 
nationwide ban on abortion services. 
We go back to those days where abor-
tions were performed illegally in back 
alleys. We can’t let that happen in this 
country. 
While many States, including my 
home State of Maryland, have acted to 
expand abortion care, we cannot rely 
on a patchwork of State laws to pro-
tect a basic constitutional right. The 
right to choose is fundamental and a 
decision that a woman should make in 
consultation with a doctor or other 
healthcare provider free of political in-
terference from Federal, State, or local 
government. 
I urge President Biden and the De-
partment of Health and Human Serv-
ices, the Department of Justice, and 
other Federal Agencies to use their 
power and to act swiftly to safeguard 
the reproductive rights of Americans. 
There is no denying that this is a 
bleak moment. We know the battle for 
reproductive rights has been an ongo-
ing struggle with previous setbacks. 
We saw this just a few months ago fol-
lowing the anti-choice, pro-vigilante 
law that the Texas Legislature passed 
which threatens providers with jail 
time and fines for administering what 
is still federally and constitutionally 
protected medical care for women. 
We cannot wait any longer. We must 
do everything in our power to ensure 
access to reproductive services now. 
Therefore, I urge my colleagues to pass 
the Women’s Health Protection Act, 
and we will have a chance to do that 
starting tomorrow. 
Throughout my time in Congress, I 
have been a steadfast supporter of re-
productive rights, and this will not 
change. Regardless of the outcome of 
tomorrow’s 
vote 
or 
the 
Supreme 
Court’s final decision, I will continue 
to do everything within my power to 
ensure that women can have access to 
the care they need. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Mr. PETERS. Madam President, I 
also rise to speak about the need to 
pass the Women’s Health Protection 
Act. Certainly, the Senator from Mary-
land outlined a very strong argument 
as to why this fundamental protection, 
this fundamental right, needs to be 
protected. 
We know right now that we may see 
the Supreme Court come out with a de-
cision to basically end Roe v. Wade 
and, in the process, end a fundamental 
right that women in this country have 
had available to them for 50 years. 
We can hear all the arguments—and 
my colleagues will present an awful lot 
of arguments tonight and tomorrow— 
as to why we need to pass this act, but 
for me, this is personal, a personal ex-
perience that I had, and it is an experi-
ence that, unfortunately, many, many 
families have had. The fact is, as I have 
shared this story, I have been really 
overwhelmed by people reaching out to 
me and saying that they, too, have a 
very similar story and how my talking 
about it brought out their willingness 
to share their experience as well. In ad-
dition to that, they understand how 
important it is that we protect Roe v. 
Wade and we protect the right for 
women to make critical decisions for 
themselves, along with their doctor, 
and not have politics interfere with 
those decisions. 
My story involves my first wife. 
When we were married, she was preg-
nant with a child whom we very much 
wanted. We were looking forward to 
having a second child. In the fourth 
month, towards the end of the fourth 
month, her water broke—clearly a very 
dangerous situation. 
She went to go see her physician. Her 
physician examined her and said: With 
this water breaking, the amniotic fluid 
has now left the uterus. There is no 
way a baby can survive in this situa-
tion. 
They examined her. There was a very 
faint heartbeat. 
He said: There is a faint heartbeat 
here, but there is no way this baby can 
survive. 
He said: What I think will happen is 
you are going to have a miscarriage. So

May 10, 2022 
go home tonight, and you will have a 
miscarriage, and come in and see me 
tomorrow. 
Well, you can imagine the anguish, 
the horrible evening, and the despair 
that she was in and I was in. It was a 
long, long night. 
The next morning, nothing happened. 
She went back to the physician—we 
went back to the physician. He exam-
ined her again and said: I am really 
surprised. I don’t know why you didn’t 
miscarry because it is clear that there 
is no way this baby can survive in this 
situation. The amniotic fluid is gone; 
the cushion is gone. 
He said: I don’t think I can do any-
thing because there is still a faint 
heartbeat here. I don’t know why there 
is still a faint heartbeat. So go home 
again tonight. I think tonight is going 
to be the night you have a miscarriage. 
We went back again. It didn’t hap-
pen—another horrible night—horrible. 
The mental anguish is intense, and 
families who have gone through this 
know exactly what I am talking about. 
We went the next day, and, again, he 
examined her. He said: I can’t under-
stand this, but this is going on. I am 
really worried that there is going to be 
an infection here. There isn’t the pro-
tection there. You could go into septic 
shock. Your health is definitely endan-
gered here. The baby can’t survive. 
Without the amniotic fluid, the cush-
ion, the baby could lose its limbs. 
There were horrible, horrible, night-
marish kinds of thoughts in our minds. 
He said: I am going to go to the hos-
pital, and I am going to say, even 
though there is a faint heartbeat, this 
is a medical necessity, that we have to 
do a D&C abortion here to protect your 
health and potentially your life if we 
don’t take care of this. So I will go to 
the hospital. Go home, and I will call 
you and let you know when I can bring 
you in. 
Well, he called. I will never forget 
the voicemail that was left. He said: I 
am really sorry to say this. I went to 
the hospital board. I explained the 
medical necessity here, what you are 
going through, how we have to take 
care of this because it could clearly be 
a serious situation if you go into septic 
shock. 
And the board said: No. As long as 
there is a faint heartbeat, you can’t 
perform the procedure. 
Then he said: There is no reason for 
this decision from the hospital board. 
It is not based on sound medicine. It is 
not based on medical practice. It is not 
based on what is best for your health. 
This is based on politics. Plain and 
simple, this is politics. 
He goes: I am ashamed that this hap-
pened, and I am embarrassed I have to 
call you and tell you I can’t do it be-
cause the hospital will not grant me 
privileges to do it. 
He said: My advice to you is find a 
doctor now, immediately, that can 
take care of this procedure. 
Well, you can imagine how scary that 
is, how frightening that is; and who do 
we call in that situation? We were for-
tunate in the fact that we had a friend 
who was a hospital administrator at 
another hospital. He got us in to see 
the gynecologist, OB–GYN at the hos-
pital to examine her. We went there. 
He examined her and said: Oh, my 
gosh, I have to do this procedure now. 
There is no more time. This is getting 
incredibly dangerous. We have to do 
the D&C abortion. 
He said: You are about to go—the in-
fection is starting. It is going to get 
worse. If I don’t do this quickly, you 
are going to lose your uterus. If we 
don’t deal with it quickly, you could 
very well lose your life with the infec-
tion that could occur here. 
He immediately performed the proce-
dure. 
Just think of that. One, if we didn’t 
have the opportunity to see another 
doctor who was able to perform it and 
understood the severity of it, my wife 
at the time, former wife, could have 
easily lost a uterus, could have had sig-
nificant health impacts, and could have 
lost her life. 
It just kept ringing in my mind what 
that doctor said: This is about politics. 
This is not about good medical prac-
tice. This is not about caring about 
someone’s health and caring about 
their life; it was about politics. And 
that is why we have to protect Roe v. 
Wade. 
We have to protect the right for 
women to control their bodies, to con-
trol their reproductive health. It can-
not be a decision made by politicians 
here in this body or other places. This 
is a real situation that families face. 
As I mentioned, there was an out-
pouring of folks who have come to me 
who had similar situations. 
I think about Michigan right now. 
Michigan has a law on the books that 
was written in 1931 that says all abor-
tion is prohibited in our State. It 
doesn’t matter whether or not it in-
volves the health of the mother, it 
doesn’t matter if it is the life of the 
mother, it doesn’t matter if a woman is 
the victim of rape or incest—it is just 
simply not allowed. I think that is un-
conscionable. That is what will happen. 
It is a real-life situation that could 
happen if the Court decides to go for-
ward and reverse Roe v. Wade. Situa-
tions like what my former wife went 
through and families all across Amer-
ica would not be able to have that kind 
of option. 
If you think about the no exception 
for rape or incest, you will have a 17- 
year-old girl in Michigan who is raped. 
She will have no options. I know a ma-
jority of people in the United States 
believe that is unacceptable. I know a 
majority of people in the United States 
believe that women have the right to 
make these most personal, these most 
intimate decisions themselves, with 
the advice of their physician or who-
ever else that they want to consult. 
This is not about politics. This is not 
about the opinions of folks who think 
that they know better. Let’s preserve 
the right of women to do what they 
think is best. 
That is why we have to pass the 
Women’s Health Protection Act and 
why I would urge all my colleagues to 
search their heart and listen to the sto-
ries that people will tell them and un-
derstand that the right thing to do is 
to protect reproductive freedoms and 
rights in America. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Presi-
dent, first, I want to thank my friend 
and colleague, the Senator from Michi-
gan, for coming to the floor to share 
his own powerful and personal story 
and the stories of his constituents 
about why so many of us are here on 
the Senate floor this evening, and it is 
because 8 days ago, our country re-
ceived a terrible wake-up call. A leaked 
draft opinion from the Supreme Court 
of the United States indicated that a 
majority of five Justices may be on the 
verge of overturning the constitutional 
protections of reproductive freedom set 
forth in Roe v. Wade. 
We don’t know if this draft opinion 
will be the final decision, but we do 
know there is a very high chance that 
the Supreme Court of the United 
States will soon blow up 50 years of 
precedent and strip women of their 
constitutional right to make choices 
about their own body and their own 
self-determination. 
And while the content of this opinion 
is shocking, it is not totally surprising. 
This is the premeditated outcome of 
years—years—of plotting and planning 
by the rightwing legal movement and 
the Republican Party. 
Candidate Donald Trump promised 
the Nation he would handpick Justices 
who would overturn Roe v. Wade. On 
the campaign trail, he even claimed 
that Roe would be overturned ‘‘imme-
diately’’ once he assumed office. And 
he stated on national television that 
women who receive abortions should be 
punished. Leader MCCONNELL and Sen-
ate Republicans made up their own 
rules and then broke their own rules in 
order to play their part in this scheme. 
First, Senate Republicans refused to 
even hold a hearing on President 
Obama’s 
Supreme 
Court 
nominee, 
Merrick Garland, on the grounds that 
it was a Presidential election year. 
Four years later, Senate Republicans 
rushed 
through 
one 
of 
President 
Trump’s own Supreme Court nominees 
just weeks before the 2020 election. 
And in between, Senate Republicans 
carved out an exception to the Senate 
filibuster rule so they could push 
through all three of Trump’s anti- 
choice 
Supreme 
Court 
picks: 
Neil 
Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy 
Coney Barrett. 
Each of these nominees raised their 
right hand before the Senate Judiciary 
Committee and swore under oath that 
they respected the weight of judicial 
precedent. 
In 
fact,

Brett 
Kavanaugh was asked about Roe v.

Wade, he pointed to Planned Parent-
hood v. Casey, which affirmed the core 
holding in Roe establishing a constitu-
tional right to abortion, and he called 
the decision in Casey ‘‘precedent on 
precedent,’’ a double precedent. 
But let’s be very clear, this draft 
opinion has no respect for judicial 
precedent. If the draft holds, all three 
of President Trump’s nominees to the 
Supreme Court, along with some others 
already on the Bench, will have delib-
erately deceived and defrauded the 
American public. 
Rightwing ideologues set out to 
stack the Court with Justices ready 
and willing to overturn Roe v. Wade. 
Now, this rightwing establishment, 
this machinery, is on the verge of 
achieving their goal, even though their 
win will be a horrible loss for the rep-
utation of the Supreme Court, a hor-
rible loss for the integrity of our Con-
stitution, and most of all, a horrible 
loss for the American people. 
More than half of the women and 
girls of reproductive age in our country 
live in States that would likely ban or 
severely restrict abortion if the Su-
preme Court overturns Roe v. Wade. 
Thirteen States have so-called trig-
ger laws that will kick into effect auto-
matically the day Roe is overturned. 
Nine States have passed laws that were 
struck down in the past because they 
violated the protections of Roe, but 
those laws could come back if Roe v. 
Wade is overturned. 
Many of these laws we are talking 
about are extreme. One trigger law in 
Kentucky would ban all abortions at 
any point in pregnancy, with no excep-
tions for rape, no exceptions for incest, 
or a situation in which a child could be 
born with a fatal birth defect. 
Another trigger law in Idaho would 
make providing an abortion at any 
point in pregnancy and under almost 
any circumstances a felony crime pun-
ishable by 5 years in prison. A Texas 
law that is on the books right now 
would put doctors in jail or fine them 
up to $10,000 for prescribing pills for 
medication abortions through tele-
health or the mail for women who are 
more than 7 weeks pregnant. 
And a law that has been on the books 
since 1931 in Michigan would snap back 
into effect, making nearly all abor-
tions at any point in pregnancy a fel-
ony. And women who undergo medica-
tion abortions would be made felons, 
even in the case of rape and incest. 
Just last week, State legislators in 
the Louisiana House advanced a bill 
through committee that would allow 
women who obtain abortions at any 
time in pregnancy to be prosecuted for 
murder—for murder. 
Experts say that this extreme law 
could also be used to restrict emer-
gency contraception and in vitro fer-
tilization, which is a critical process 
that helps customers with infertility 
build their families. 
Like many of our colleagues, I have 
been hearing from my constituents, my 
constituents in the State of Maryland, 
who have learned just how dangerous 
this situation is for women and fami-
lies across the country. One con-
stituent named Connie shared her 
story of taking emergency contracep-
tion after she was attacked and raped 
by a stranger at the age of 18. 
She told me about the importance of 
being able to make that choice about 
her body and her future instead of po-
tentially becoming pregnant because of 
a rape. Today, Connie is a social work-
er, a therapist, and has a wonderful 
son. 
I have received other testimonials 
from constituents across the State of 
Maryland who have shared their stories 
and expressed their deep concern and 
fear about the Court striking down Roe 
v. Wade. 
If Roe was overturned, women living 
in States where safe and legal abortion 
is banned will have to travel away from 
their homes, away from their commu-
nities, away from their families simply 
to exercise control over their own bod-
ies. 
Those who lack the money or the 
time will either be forced to carry an 
unwanted pregnancy to term or find 
somebody performing abortions in the 
shadows in their States, a throwback 
to the dangerous back-alley abortions. 
In 1965, 8 years before the Roe v. 
Wade decision, illegal abortion ac-
counted for 17 percent—17 percent—of 
all deaths attributed to pregnancy and 
childbirth. That past could soon be our 
present. 
So, you see, this Supreme Court deci-
sion doesn’t just turn back the clock 
on precedent, it turns back the clock 
on public health as it strips women of 
their reproductive freedoms. 
And in a world where Roe has been 
overturned, as you drive across our 
great country, your rights will change 
from State to State as you cross each 
State border. That is the result of tak-
ing away a constitutional right, and 
that is why polling shows the great 
majority of the American people do not 
want the Supreme Court to take away 
the rights under Roe v. Wade. 
Now, I am proud to represent a State 
that has codified a woman’s right to re-
productive choice. In fact, during my 
very first campaign for public office, 
the right to reproductive choice was 
the defining issue in my election to the 
Maryland General Assembly. It was an-
other time when there was great fear 
that a Supreme Court might overturn 
Roe v. Wade. 
And so I ran on the pro-choice ticket, 
and after I was sworn in, in a matter of 
months, my colleagues and I passed a 
bill in 1991 codifying Roe v. Wade as a 
matter of Maryland State law. 
But here is the thing, laws like the 
one we have in Maryland, laws like the 
one we passed back in 1991, will be on 
the chopping block if this decades-long, 
rightwing project continues to go ac-
cording to plan because the Repub-
licans’ ultimate objective isn’t just to 
overturn Roe v. Wade; it is to enact a 
Federal law passed in this Senate and 
in the House banning abortion nation-
wide. 
Last week, Leader MCCONNELL
ac-
knowledged that a national ban on 
abortion was a real possibility during 
an interview with USA TODAY. That 
should sound alarm bells all over 
America. 
This has been a two-step process. 
Step No. 1, strike down the constitu-
tional protections of Roe v. Wade that 
prohibit elected officials, whether it is 
State legislatures or in Congress, from 
enacting laws that prohibit or restrict 
unnecessarily the right to choose. That 
is step No. 1. It seems we are on the 
verge of that happening. 
Once you clear the way, step No. 2, 
enact a Federal law in Congress ban-
ning abortion everywhere in the coun-
try, and we have seen exactly how ex-
treme those laws can be from the State 
examples I cited earlier. That could 
happen here if this Republican, right-
wing project sees its logical end; that 
Federal law would supersede Mary-
land’s law. If Congress passed that law 
and it was enacted, State laws like 
those in Maryland protecting the right 
to 
choose 
in 
Maryland 
would 
be 
knocked off the books. That is true of 
other State laws, statutes, that protect 
a woman’s right to choose. 
No woman in America would be safe 
to obtain a safe and legal abortion if 
such a national law were enacted. 
Now, everyone should also under-
stand another huge danger posed by 
the draft. Its flawed logic not only 
would dismantle the right to an abor-
tion, it could also be used to strip away 
other rights protected by the Constitu-
tion. 
I have read Justice Alito’s draft opin-
ion. I have read all 98 pages of it. 
In this opinion, Justice Alito tries to 
distinguish this case on abortion from 
other cases involving other individual 
rights. Alito claims that this case is 
special because it involves abortion 
and the State’s interest in protecting 
life, while other cases do not. Well, 
that is obvious on its face, but it 
misses the bigger danger in Alito’s 
opinion. 
Because it doesn’t change the fact 
that Justice Alito’s reasoning for dis-
mantling the right to obtain an abor-
tion can be used to dismantle many 
other rights that we currently take for 
granted as well. Justice Alito claims 
that, even as you look at the entire 
Constitution, you cannot find a right 
to choose for women; that you cannot 
derive that from the Constitution. 
In fact, on page 5 of the draft opin-
ion, Justice Alito writes: 
The Constitution makes no reference to 
abortion, and no such right is implicitly pro-
tected by any constitutional provision. 
And if we follow Justice Alito’s 
flawed logic, the same could be said of 
a host of other rights that are not spe-
cifically named in the Constitution. 
The Constitution doesn’t have the word 
‘‘contraception’’ in it. The Constitu-
tion doesn’t talk about consenting 
adults engaged in sexual relations.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2411 
May 10, 2022 
Look, this is the thing: Over time, 
the Supreme Court has recognized com-
ponents of liberty through a close anal-
ysis of the Bill of Rights and the 14th 
Amendment, and that includes the 
right to use contraception, the right of 
consenting adults to have sexual rela-
tions with who they choose, and the 
right to marry who you love. 
These are rights the American people 
don’t want elected officials to take 
away, whether they are State legisla-
tures or Members of the Senate or the 
House. But they are all at peril too if 
the logic of Alito’s reasoning is played 
out. And the terrible irony—the ter-
rible irony—here is those who most 
claim to oppose government regula-
tions of any kind are now the ones 
rushing to regulate the most intimate, 
personal, and private aspects of Amer-
ican life. They say they don’t want 
government having any role in their 
life—get out of my way—except for 
when it comes to them taking away 
this right and planning to pass laws 
that would ban abortion nationally, 
and as I said, open the door to going 
after other liberties as well. 
So those are the stakes that we are 
facing as we gather here this evening 
in anticipation of tomorrow’s vote. 
And that is why we are taking this 
vote tomorrow. That is why we need to 
pass the Women’s Health Protection 
Act, but even if we fall short this time, 
having a vote now is important. It is 
important to the country. Democracy 
requires accountability, and it is im-
portant that the American people 
know where each of the Senators 
stands on this issue. It is a funda-
mental question. 
So as we move into November toward 
the midterm elections, the American 
people will be watching closely how 
Members of this body vote on this fun-
damental constitutional question. And 
they will look to see who voted to strip 
away constitutional rights and who 
rose to protect them. And I believe 
that the majority of this country—the 
overwhelming majority of this coun-
try—wants to stand up to protect fun-
damental liberties in the Constitution 
of the United States. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, I 
will probably get in trouble with some-
body for saying this, but the question 
of when life begins, the deeper question 
of what defines life, which biological 
entities are alive or possess inde-
pendent existence versus which biologi-
cal entities are simply part of some-
thing else that is alive—man, those are 
really hard questions. 
I heard my colleague Senator DAINES 
on the floor earlier tonight talking 
passionately about his belief that life 
begins at conception and that humans 
have an obligation to defend a day-old 
fetus equally to our obligation to de-
fend the life of someone who has been 
born. 
Now, I disagree. I believe that life be-
gins at birth. I believe that our legal 
obligation towards a born human is dif-
ferent than our legal obligation toward 
an unborn fetus. But on that narrow 
question of when life begins, I don’t 
cast any particular judgment on Sen-
ator DAINES for believing what he be-
lieves. His belief system is shared by 
millions of Americans—not the major-
ity of Americans, but a significant 
share. 
This disagreement that he and I have 
over when legally protected life begins, 
though, is as significant and as impor-
tant a disagreement as exists—right— 
because 
it 
is 
about 
the 
most 
foundational questions in human exist-
ence: What is life? Who decides whether 
a woman bears a child? Who has con-
trol over that woman’s body? Who has 
control over the most sacred and crit-
ical function of a human being, the act 
of giving birth? It just doesn’t get any 
more important than that set of ques-
tions. 
And given this fundamental disagree-
ment, given the weightiness of these 
questions, given the large number of 
Americans who sit on either side of 
these questions, I come to one simple 
conclusion: No government, no group 
of politicians, should make this deci-
sion for anyone else. This decision 
about whether to abort a pregnancy, so 
morally complicated, so socially divi-
sive, should and must be left to individ-
uals—in this case, to women—to de-
cide. 
Over the course of history, millions 
have 
died 
in 
fights 
over 
another 
weighty moral issue—the question of 
whether God exists, and if a God exists, 
exactly what form that being takes and 
what it requires of humans. Disputes 
over religion have eradicated entire 
civilizations. 
What does this have to do with Roe v. 
Wade? 
Well, our Founding Fathers decided 
that there were some topics that were 
so personal, so subject to disagreement 
and 
controversy, 
that 
government 
should just be barred from registering 
judgment. 
That is part of the reason why our 
civilization has not been plagued by 
wars between religious groups—a re-
ality that continues to paralyze soci-
eties to this day in other parts of the 
world—because we keep government 
out of the question of which God is the 
right God. That is up to every Amer-
ican to decide for themselves, even 
though many Americans believe that 
the consequence of observing or fol-
lowing the wrong God is serious—eter-
nal damnation, for some. The stakes 
are huge when it comes to religion, but 
government sits on the sidelines. 
To me, that is an imperfect but in-
structive corollary to the debate over 
choice 
and 
abortion. 
The 
decision 
about whether to have an abortion is so 
personal, and the lack of consensus in 
the country on the question is so un-
avoidable, as to make government 
intervention just as illegitimate as it 
would be if government tried to dictate 
to someone which religion they should 
follow. 
Now, that is not the exact route that 
the Supreme Court traveled to get to 
the Roe decision, but it helps me un-
derstand why, from 1973 until today, 
the decision about whether or not to 
have an abortion has been a constitu-
tional right of the individual, not the 
constitutional right of the government 
to decide. 
Frankly, it has always been really 
hard for me to square how Republicans, 
who so readily evangelize about small 
government, about the importance of 
putting families and their decision- 
making processes first, about the evil 
of public sector overreach, are so en-
thusiastic 
about 
the 
government 
micromanaging 
personal 
decisions 
about pregnancy or marriage or adop-
tion. 
Small government is great, I guess, 
for corporations, but it is not so great 
when it comes to the most intimate de-
cisions that families make. 
And as I have said on this floor be-
fore, it is also hard to take seriously 
Republicans’ passionate pleas for this 
body to defend the existence of an un-
born fetus when they seem to care so 
little about many of the existential 
threats that are posed to every Amer-
ican after they are born. 
Today, this day, over 100 Americans 
are going to die from gunshot wounds, 
from 
murders, 
and 
suicides. 
And 
whether 
my 
Republican 
colleagues 
agree with me or not that stricter gun 
laws is part of the solution to this 
uniquely 
American 
epidemic 
that 
plagues those that are born, I don’t 
know that I have ever heard a Repub-
lican speech dedicated to this crisis on 
the floor of the Senate. I have heard 
dozens dedicated to the cause of those 
before birth. It seems that after birth, 
life matters a little bit less to some 
people in this body. 
So that is what I think. And as I said, 
I will probably get into some hot water 
for admitting that I understand the ar-
guments 
that 
people 
like 
Senator 
DAINES make. I don’t agree with his 
views, but I understand them. And my 
hope is, is that as we begin this debate 
over the future of reproductive choice 
and health in this country, as this de-
bate heats up—because it is not going 
away. We are taking a vote tomorrow, 
but this is a debate that is going to 
consume this Nation if the Alito opin-
ion becomes law, which I believe it 
will. 
My hope is that we are honest about 
the complexity of this debate, but the 
Republicans are equally honest in the 
claims that they make. 
Let me just briefly tell you what I 
mean. 
Today, I heard Republican Senators 
making a whole bunch of claims that 
are just so ungrounded in truth as to 
diminish the quality of what should be 
a very important debate on a very 
weighty subject. 
For instance, I heard Senators make 
the claim that the protesters who were 
protesting outside or near Supreme 
Court Justices’ homes threatened vio-
lence against those Justices. That was

May 10, 2022 
an explicit claim made by people who 
came down to this floor who might 
have heard it on some unreputable 
website, but it is not true. 
You can object to protesters being 
outside of public officials’ homes. It 
has happened to all of us, by the way, 
but don’t make up threats of violence 
just because it makes for a better 
story. 
I heard one Senator say that the 
Women’s Health Protection Act, for 
which I will proudly vote tomorrow, al-
lows for garage abortions. That is not 
true. That is just plainly not true. 
Every State requires that abortions 
be performed in licensed healthcare fa-
cilities and nothing in the bill changes 
it. Don’t say that just because it 
makes a better story. 
Many Republicans claim that the bill 
we are taking up tomorrow allows 
abortions up to the date of birth. That 
is not true either. 
The Women’s Health Protection Act 
does codify Roe v. Wade, but Roe only 
protects a woman’s right to have an 
abortion without restriction until via-
bility and then afterward protects for 
the woman’s health or risk of death. 
The bill simply does not expand the 
circumstances under which an abortion 
can be performed beyond what cur-
rently exists in case law. 
So I am going to be honest with my 
colleagues about the admitted com-
plexities—the political, moral complex-
ities of this debate. But I expect oppo-
nents of the bill that we are debating 
tomorrow to be equally honest in the 
arguments they make as well. 
So I will have a lot more to say about 
this topic as we begin what I think is a 
debate that will consume this Nation, 
rightfully, over the course of the com-
ing weeks and months, but for today I 
will leave it there. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
f 
U.S. SUPREME COURT 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, I am here for the 14th time to 
keep unmasking the scheme to control 
our Supreme Court—a scheme that is 
now poised to destroy a woman’s right 
to make her own reproductive health 
choices and to smash foundational Su-
preme Court precedent to get there. 
Last week, Politico confirmed a fear 
that many of us have had for years. We 
now see that the Supreme Court has at 
least five votes to eradicate Roe v. 
Wade, one of the most important deci-
sions in the Court’s history. For nearly 
half a century, women in this country 
have relied on Roe’s recognition that 
our constitutional right to privacy in-
cludes the right to decide when to have 
a child. This is one of the most pro-
foundly personal and life-changing de-
cisions anyone can make. Now, the 
draft opinion from Justice Alito shows 
in black and white how the Court plans 
to steamroll over that right—and after-
ward probably many others that are 
anchored in that same American right 
to privacy. 
If Justice Alito’s draft opinion be-
comes law, women in this country will 
have a well-established constitutional 
right stripped away. That has not hap-
pened before. 
Already 13 States have trigger bans 
that will snap into place the moment 
Roe is overturned, and 13 more are ex-
pected to ban or severely restrict abor-
tions in the future. And it won’t stop 
there. For example, Louisiana’s Repub-
lican lawmakers just advanced a bill 
that would criminalize abortion as 
homicide and allow prosecutors to 
charge women seeking abortions as 
criminals. 
In the week since the news broke, a 
lot of Americans have expressed just 
how strongly they disagree with the 
path this Court is headed down. They 
are disappointed, stunned, outraged, 
and they are right. When you take a 
second to remember what these same 
Justices told us in the past about Roe, 
you can be doubly outraged. I know 
Democrats on the Senate Judiciary 
Committee are. We saw the last three 
Republican Justices come through that 
committee and look us in the eye as we 
asked what they thought about Roe. 
Let’s be clear: Each of these Repub-
lican Justices came before the com-
mittee; each was specifically asked 
about Roe v. Wade. 
Here is what they told us: 
Neil Gorsuch: 
Roe v. Wade, decided in 1973, is a precedent 
of the United States Supreme Court. It has 
been reaffirmed. 
Brett Kavanaugh: 
It is settled as a precedent of the Supreme 
Court, entitled to respect under principles of 
stare decisis. 
Amy Coney Barrett: 
Roe is not a super-precedent because calls 
for its overruling have never ceased. But 
that doesn’t mean that Roe should be over-
ruled. It just means that it doesn’t fall with-
in a small handful of cases like Marbury v. 
Madison and Brown v. Board that no one 
questions anymore. 
Add in Alito himself: 
Roe v. Wade is an important precedent of 
the Supreme Court. 
Yet here is what Alito’s draft opinion 
says: 
Roe was egregiously wrong from the start. 
Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and 
the decision has had damaging consequences. 
Well, there was no mention of ‘‘egre-
giously’’ at the confirmation hearings. 
There was no mention of ‘‘wrong from 
the start’’ when we asked about Roe. 
Does anyone seriously think that this 
was a sudden, new epiphany that came 
over the Federalist Society Justices in 
the last few weeks? None—none—man-
aged to mention their belief that Roe 
v. Wade was ‘‘egregiously wrong from 
the start.’’ Whether that was outright 
lying or confirmation hearing hide-the- 
ball tricks, it is dishonorable, and it 
was dishonest. 
If that is what you believe as a judge, 
own it. Don’t keep your views secret 
until you have the votes to make your 
move. That may be clever politics, but 
it is politics, not judging. It is a big 
tell about this captured Court. 
Since the news broke, Republicans 
have tried desperately to change the 
subject. The minority leader says: 
The real outrage is not the obliteration of 
women’s rights but that we found out about 
it a month early. 
He says: 
This lawless action should be investigated 
and punished as quickly as possible. 
Other Republicans called for the FBI 
to prosecute the leaker criminally or 
civilly. Some even purport to identify 
the leaker. 
Chief Justice Roberts called the leak 
‘‘a singular and egregious breach of 
. . . trust’’ and an ‘‘affront to the com-
munity of public servants who work 
here.’’ 
Look, as to the leak, Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, go for it. Investigate away. Send 
the Marshals. But to my Republican 
colleagues, sharpening their pitchforks 
and calling for criminal prosecution: 
Spare me the high dudgeon. Spare me 
the faux outrage. As former White 
House Ethics Counsel Walter Shaub ex-
plains, ‘‘[T]he Supreme Court has no 
code of ethics—which is the place you 
would normally put a ban on misusing 
nonpublic 
information. 
[So] 
what 
crime would [the] FBI . . . inves-
tigate?’’ 
As for the ‘‘affront’’ to the institu-
tion, I suggest everyone consider the 
real rot at the core of the Supreme 
Court. 
If you care about the independence 
and integrity of the Court, it is not 
this leak you should be outraged about; 
it is that for the first time in the his-
tory of the U.S. Supreme Court, the se-
lection of Supreme Court Justices was 
farmed out, handed off to a private or-
ganization, and Justices were selected 
in some backroom with zero trans-
parency into how the selections were 
made, how the lists were assembled, 
and zero transparency into the dark 
money that flowed into that private or-
ganization while the selections were 
being made. Who paid what to have a 
seat at the Federalist Society’s judi-
cial selection turnstile? 
We know from new reporting that it 
was the Federalist Society’s Leonard 
Leo who ‘‘laid out [the] road map for 
Trump on the Federal court system’’ 
with the goal of ‘‘transforming the 
foundational understanding of rights in 
America.’’ 
So much for balls and strikes, huh? 
Leo came up with the list of ‘‘judges 
that would please the Republican base’’ 
from among what he called the ‘‘dec-
ades of conservative lawyers in the 
pipeline.’’ He became a ‘‘team’’ with 
Don McGahn, Trump’s White House 
Counsel, and MITCH
MCCONNELL
to 
‘‘keep the judicial nominations effort 
moving.’’ It was Leo who took to the 
White House where he had ‘‘extensive 
access,’’ to the revised nominees list 
that included Kavanaugh and Barrett. 
The picks were made by advisers, said 
Senator MCCONNELL, with Trump’s role

merely ‘‘signing off on them,’’ and he 
‘‘never veered from the lists of can-
didates suggested by Leo and others.’’ 
Again, this was not about calling 
‘‘balls and strikes.’’ 
If you want ‘‘to have the longest pos-
sible impact on the kind of America 
you want,’’ said Leader MCCONNELL, 
‘‘you look at the courts.’’ That is their 
goal, to change the kind of America we 
have—more accurately, the kind of 
America 
the 
far-right 
megadonors 
want, I would say. 
Trump noticed. ‘‘MITCH MCCONNELL. 
Judges. Judges. Judges. The only thing 
he wants is judges,’’ said Trump. 
We know this happened because the 
Trump White House, right up to Trump 
himself, said so. Trump’s own White 
House Counsel joked that he ‘‘in- 
sourced’’ the Federalist Society into 
the selection process. As one promi-
nent conservative explained, this was 
an 
‘‘enterprise’’—an 
‘‘enterprise 
of 
building a Supreme Court that will 
overturn Roe v. Wade.’’ 
Once the anonymous donors behind 
the Federalist Society Justice-picking 
operation got the nominees they want-
ed, then came the dark money front 
groups rolling out ad campaigns to 
help ram those Justices through the 
Senate. Anonymous donations of $15 
million, $17 million, $19 million went to 
phony front groups like the so-called 
‘‘Judicial Crisis Network’’ to promote 
those backroom-chosen Federalist So-
ciety nominees. 
Then, once the Federalist Society 
Justices were stacked onto the Court, 
flotillas of dark money front groups ap-
peared before them, both as litigants 
and as amici curiae, orchestrated by 
the dozens in little groups to signal the 
Republican Justices how to rule. And it 
is pretty likely that the same donor 
network was behind the nomination 
turnstile, the propaganda machine, and 
the flotillas. And by the way, they are 
winning—winning—with 
these 
hand-
picked 
Justices 
at 
an 
astonishing 
rate—80 to 0 by one count. 
We see the results of the scheme in 
this very case. The sponsors of the Mis-
sissippi abortion law admitted that 
they passed the law because they 
thought the new Supreme Court Jus-
tices would uphold it, just like a new 
legislative body had come in. After 
Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination was 
rushed through the Senate, the State 
of Mississippi even changed its position 
to ask the Supreme Court to overrule 
Roe in its entirety. It all smells of 
‘‘fixery.’’ 
No 
wonder 
Justice 
Sotomayor asked during oral argument 
whether the Court will ‘‘survive the 
stench that this creates in the public 
perception that the Constitution and 
its reading are just political acts?’’ 
So, if colleagues want to talk about 
demolition of the integrity and inde-
pendence of the Court, then they better 
have something to say about turning 
the Supreme Court over to dark money 
special interests, about special inter-
ests capturing the Court to serve their 
rightwing ‘‘enterprise.’’ A captured 
Court, that is delivering for the special 
interests that stacked it and helping to 
keep their secrets has had its integrity 
and independence pretty well demol-
ished already. 
The last gasp of the scoundrels is to 
pretend that it is Democrats calling 
out this dark money mess who are the 
ones undermining the integrity of the 
Court. They even point to a brief of 
mine where several colleagues and I 
quoted to the Court a poll showing that 
a majority of Americans feel the Court 
is ‘‘mainly motivated by politics’’ and 
that it ought to be ‘‘restructured in 
order to reduce the influence of poli-
tics.’’ 
That is a poll, not a threat. 
And the Court better start paying at-
tention to why the American people 
feel that way, rather than quarreling 
that anyone that is ‘‘threatening’’ or 
‘‘bullying’’ the Court by pointing that 
out. 
By the way, if threatening is what 
you want to fuss about, have the de-
cency to be consistent. Here is a quote 
from FOX News’ host Laura Ingraham 
discussing this actual abortion case 
after the oral arguments were done. 
Forgive my bad language to the 
pages who are here. I am actually 
quoting her verbatim. 
We have six Republican appointees on this 
Court after all the money that has been 
raised, the Federalist Society, all these big 
‘‘fat cat’’ dinners. I’m sorry. I’m pissed about 
this. If this Court with six Justices cannot 
do the right thing here, the constitutional 
thing, then I think it’s time to do what Rob-
ert Bork said we should do, which is to cir-
cumscribe the jurisdiction of this Court, and 
if they want to blow it up, then that’s the 
way to change things finally. 
Far from pushing back on that threat 
to ‘‘blow it up’’ and ‘‘change things fi-
nally,’’ the Senate colleague she was 
talking to said: 
. . . in a heartbeat. 
When you are treating an accurate 
quotation of a poll as a threat and ig-
noring a public threat to blow up the 
Court and change things finally—after 
all the ‘‘fat cat’’ money spent on the 
Federalist Society, no less—forgive me 
for doubting your sincerity. 
As Senator PADILLA said in the Judi-
ciary Committee last week, have the 
decency to be consistent at least. 
Justice Alito spent over 98 pages try-
ing and failing to justify overturning 
the decision protecting these rights— 
overturning a decision he told the U.S. 
Senate was an ‘‘important precedent of 
the Supreme Court.’’ 
His opinion isn’t persuasive to me at 
all as it reads as snide and cruel, but 
that is not going to stop these Justices 
from trying to throw us back into an 
age where women aren’t free to make 
their own choices about their own bod-
ies and their own futures. It looks like 
the fix went in on that a while ago, and 
we just weren’t told about it in the 
hearings. 
So, tomorrow, the majority leader 
will bring before this Chamber legisla-
tion to protect those rights nation-
wide, to protect that freedom across 
this country, and I am eager to vote for 
it. We have got to stand against this 
assault 
on 
women’s 
constitutional 
rights, and I hope some Republican col-
leagues will join us. 
Particularly, I hope, in the weeks 
and months ahead, that we can find 
ways to unravel the dark money 
scheme that has brought this Court 
and our country closer to the brink be-
cause the Court that dark money 
built—it is not done. It is not done try-
ing to reshape America against our will 
to suit the extreme ideology of the 
rightwing 
billionaires 
behind 
the 
scheme. 
There is one good thing in all this 
darkness, and that is that the Amer-
ican people see this nonsense and have 
had enough. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
f 
WOMEN’S HEALTH PROTECTION 
ACT 
Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, 
the recently leaked draft opinion in 
Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Or-
ganization signals what many of us 
have feared would happen: At least five 
rightwing 
Supreme 
Court 
Justices 
seem poised to overturn Roe v. Wade 
and abolish the constitutional right of 
women to have an abortion. 
In my view, the U.S. Senate cannot 
and must not allow that to happen. We 
cannot go back to the days when 
women had to risk their lives to end an 
unwanted pregnancy. We cannot go 
back to the days of back alley abor-
tions. We cannot go back to the days of 
forcing a woman to carry a pregnancy 
or go through a childbirth that could 
cause her illness or death. That, we 
cannot go back to. 
In America today, it is estimated 
that one out of every four women will 
choose to have an abortion by the time 
she turns 45. In 2019, over 625,000 women 
in America chose to have an abortion. 
While no one can say with any degree 
of certainty how many deaths there 
will be if abortion is made illegal and 
women are forced to carry unsafe preg-
nancies to term, there is no doubt that, 
over a period of time, many thousands 
of American women will die. 
Now, I get very tired of hearing the 
hypocrisy from the extreme rightwing, 
who say to ‘‘get the government off our 
backs.’’ How often have we heard 
that—‘‘get the government off our 
backs; we want small government’’? 
Well, I say to those rightwingers: If 
you want to get the government off the 
backs of the American people, then un-
derstand that it is women who control 
their own bodies, not politicians. 
During the COVID crisis, how many 
times had we heard on this floor and 
throughout this country the extreme 
rightwing say: The government must 
not force us to wear a mask. How dare 
the government do that. Government 
must not force us to have a vaccine. We

have the right to do what we want with 
our bodies? 
Well, hypocritically, these very same 
rightwing politicians who worry so 
much about their masks and vaccines 
now want the Federal Government, the 
State governments, and their own local 
governments to mandate what women 
cannot and can do with their bodies. 
How hypocritical can you be? 
The decision about an abortion must 
be a decision for the woman and her 
doctor to make, not the government. 
That is why I rise this evening in 
strong support of the Women’s Health 
Protection Act. 
This legislation would make Roe v. 
Wade the law of the land. This legisla-
tion would begin to put an end to the 
relentless assault on the reproductive 
rights of women that is taking place 
all across this country. 
But let me be as clear as I can be: It 
is not good enough to just talk about 
passing this bill. If there are not 60 
votes in the Senate to pass this legisla-
tion—and there are not—we must end 
the filibuster and pass it with 50 votes. 
You know, I hear a lot of talk from 
my Democratic colleagues about the 
need for unity. Well, if there were ever 
a time for unity, now is that time. 
According to poll after poll, year 
after year, 60 percent of the American 
people believe that Roe v. Wade should 
be upheld. Moreover, according to a re-
cent Washington Post-ABC poll, 75 per-
cent of Americans say decisions on 
abortion should be left to a woman and 
her doctor, including 95 percent of 
Democrats, 81 percent of Independents, 
and 53 percent of Republicans. 
In other words, if the U.S. Senate 
were truly a representative body of the 
American people—which for a variety 
of reasons, clearly, it is not—we would 
easily have 60 votes to pass this bill, 
and women would be protected. 
It is important for us to remember 
how we got to where we are today. 
Five 
years 
ago, 
Senator 
MITCH 
MCCONNELL—the Republican leader— 
and the Republican Party in the Sen-
ate ended the filibuster for Supreme 
Court nominees in order to do what 
they could not do legislatively, which 
was to make abortion illegal. They 
didn’t have the votes to do that. So, in 
order to get Supreme Court Justices 
nominated, they ended the filibuster. 
Candidate Donald Trump promised 
that he would only nominate Supreme 
Court Justices who supported over-
turning Roe v. Wade. Unfortunately, 
out of the many lies—endless number 
of lies—that Trump made during his 
campaign and Presidency, it turns out 
that this is the one promise that he 
kept, the one honest statement that he 
made. 
Further, while it looks like, in this 
rare instance, Trump kept his promise, 
the Republican Supreme Court Jus-
tices, during their Senate confirmation 
hearings, did not. In fact, Justice Alito 
and the three Justices nominated by 
President Trump, all called Roe v. 
Wade an ‘‘important precedent’’ during 
their confirmation hearings. 
Let me quote Justice Alito at his 
Senate confirmation hearing on Janu-
ary 11, 2006: 
Roe v. Wade is an important precedent of 
the Supreme Court. It was decided in 1973, so 
it has been on the books for a long time. It 
is a precedent that has now been on the 
books for several decades. It has been chal-
lenged. It has been reaffirmed. 
That was Alito. 
In 2017, Justice Gorsuch said at his 
confirmation hearing: 
Roe v. Wade, decided in 1973, is a precedent 
of the United States Supreme Court. It has 
been reaffirmed. A good judge will consider 
it as precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court, 
worthy of treatment as precedent like any 
other. 
In 2018, Justice Kavanaugh said at his 
confirmation hearing: 
I said that [Roe v. Wade] is settled as a 
precedent of the Supreme Court, entitled the 
respect under principles of stare decisis. And 
one of the important things to keep in mind 
about Roe v. Wade is that it has been re-
affirmed many times over the past 45 years, 
as you know, and most prominently, most 
importantly, reaffirmed in Planned Parent-
hood v. Casey in 1992. 
That was Justice Kavanaugh. 
But, today, it has become increas-
ingly clear that, despite these state-
ments to the contrary, the three Jus-
tices nominated by Trump were hired 
specifically to overturn Roe v. Wade, 
and with Justice Alito at the helm, 
nominated by President George W. 
Bush, that is precisely what it appears 
they are set to do. 
These are four Justices, all appointed 
by Presidents who lost the popular 
vote. Is it any wonder why Americans 
all over our country are losing faith in 
their democracy? 
Well, you know what I believe: If Re-
publicans can end the filibuster to in-
stall rightwing Justices—nominated by 
Presidents who lost the popular vote— 
in order to overturn Roe v. Wade, 
Democrats can and must end the fili-
buster to make abortion legal and safe. 
Let’s be clear: If the Supreme Court 
strikes down Roe v. Wade, abortion 
bans will immediately go into effect in 
22 States throughout America, with 4 
others likely to follow suit. In 10 of 
these States, it will be illegal to have 
an abortion even in cases of rape or in-
cest. 
For example, in the State of Texas, if 
Roe v. Wade is struck down, it will be 
considered a felony for any Texas doc-
tor to perform an abortion on a woman 
who is raped or impregnated by a fam-
ily member. Furthermore, that law 
would actually criminalize abortion, 
punishing both women and doctors, 
who could face years in prison if they 
are found guilty. 
Other States have passed similar 
types of legislation. Mississippi’s Gov-
ernor has even refused to rule out the 
banning of contraception as a next 
step—the banning of contraception. 
Let us be clear: The Supreme Court, 
no matter how it ends up ruling, will 
not be able to ban abortion. 
If you are wealthy and if you have 
the means to get on an airplane or 
drive hundreds of miles to a clinic, you 
will have access to a safe abortion. But 
if you are poor or a member of the 
working class, it is likely that you will 
not. The reality is that overturning 
Roe v. Wade would be devastating to 
low-income and working-class women, 
who do not have the means to travel 
long distances to get an abortion. 
The issue we are discussing tonight is 
often framed as a ‘‘woman’s issue.’’ I 
disagree. This is a human rights issue. 
And if there has ever been a time in 
American history when the men of this 
country must stand with the women of 
this country, this is that moment. 
I do find it somewhat amusing that 
the loudest voices in the Republican 
Party demanding that women be forced 
to give birth against their will are ex-
actly the same people who oppose vir-
tually every effort here in Congress de-
signed to improve life for children and 
their mothers. 
These Republicans are opposed—and 
some Democrats are opposed—to paid 
family and medical leave in America. 
They literally believe that it is accept-
able for an employer to force a mother 
to go back to her job a week after giv-
ing birth. Some Republican colleagues 
want women, regardless of what they 
believe, to have a baby, but they could 
care less about those babies once they 
are born. 
These same Republicans, without ex-
ception, are opposed to extending the 
$300 a month child tax credit that ex-
pired in December and went a long, 
long way to making it easier for work-
ing-class families to raise their chil-
dren with dignity. These same Repub-
licans 
are 
opposed 
to 
universal 
childcare and free pre-K. 
It is no great secret that women 
throughout the history of our country 
have had to fight valiantly for their 
basic human rights against all forms of 
patriarchy. Let us never forget that 
when our country was formed, women 
were not just second-class citizens; 
they were third or fourth class citizens. 
Women have been fighting for equal 
rights in this country since the 1800s. 
They didn’t receive the right to vote 
until 1920. If you can believe this—and 
people don’t know this—women needed 
a male cosigner on bank loans until 
1974. Women had to get a male cosigner 
for a bank loan until 1974. 
Throughout the 1960s and 1970s—and 
way, way before that—women had to 
fight for entry into certain professions 
from which they were barred. The fight 
for equal pay continues to this day. 
Let us be clear. When it comes to the 
rights of women, we cannot go back-
ward. We must go forward. We cannot 
go back to the days when women could 
not have full access to birth control. 
We cannot go back to the days of wide- 
scale 
domestic 
violence 
against 
women. The time has come for all of us 
to protect and expand women’s rights 
in America. 
I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2415 
May 10, 2022 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Madam Presi-
dent, we are living in the twilight of 
Roe v. Wade and the incredibly impor-
tant protections for Americans that 
flow from it. For almost 50 years, the 
Supreme Court held that the Constitu-
tion safeguarded women’s access to 
critical reproductive healthcare, in-
cluding abortion, and rightly so. Most 
American women have never lived 
without the ability to control their 
bodies, their health, and their families’ 
economic well-being. 
As we learned last week from a draft 
opinion, the Supreme Court is poised to 
strip away these fundamental freedoms 
from women around the United States 
by overturning its own precedents. 
This would be one of the very few times 
in American history when the Court 
has taken away rights rather than ex-
panding them. If this draft stands, 
young women today will have fewer 
choices than their mothers and grand-
mothers had. 
The Senate has an opportunity to 
pass Federal law to protect the right to 
choose across this country. I urge my 
colleagues to take and pass this legis-
lation and do what a large majority of 
Nevadans and Americans want: to let 
women make their own decisions. 
Here is what could happen if the Su-
preme Court draft becomes law. If the 
Supreme Court overturns longstanding 
precedent in June, the right to choose 
will immediately cease to exist in 
about 18 States, and others will act 
quickly to pass new bans on critical 
care. And within months, restrictions 
on reproductive choice will be in place 
in approximately half of the States, 
meaning that around the world, half of 
the women around the country, half of 
the women of child-bearing age will 
not be able to get critical care where 
they live. 
The women who have the money and 
the time will travel to States like mine 
that have legal protections for repro-
ductive healthcare. In Nevada, we are 
already seeing women traveling from 
Texas, where an extreme law offers a 
$10,000 reward to vigilantes targeting 
anyone who ‘‘aids and abets’’ abor-
tions. 
If Roe falls, it would automatically 
trigger abortion bans in neighboring 
Idaho and Utah as well. We will see 
women traveling from Nevada to those 
States too. 
But the vast majority of women 
seeking reproductive care won’t even 
have the option to travel for care. We 
know what happens to these women. 
The research shows that when people 
cannot get essential reproductive care, 
their physical, their emotional, and 
their economic health suffers, as does 
the health of their families. They can 
face life-threatening pregnancy com-
plications and long-term health im-
pacts. 
This Court decision will strip away 
women’s power to make the best deci-
sions for themselves and their families. 
That means women will not have the 
same control over their lives and bod-
ies as men do, and that is just wrong. 
Nevadans understand something fun-
damental about the right to choose. 
The fact is that you can never know 
what circumstances another person 
faces until you walk in their shoes. 
That is why most Nevadans want to 
preserve women’s freedom to decide 
what healthcare they receive. They 
know it is not right to impose their 
own beliefs on others when Americans 
have such divergent religious views, 
economic and family circumstances, 
and medical histories. 
This is why family planning is so im-
portant. We have seen it again and 
again over the years. Far-right, ex-
treme Republican lawmakers want to 
target the entire spectrum of reproduc-
tive healthcare and family planning 
services. 
The laws they are proposing in 
States like Louisiana and Tennessee 
would keep women who want to be-
come pregnant from getting fertility 
treatments. They could stop women 
who are raped from getting the morn-
ing-after pill to prevent a potential 
pregnancy. These laws could block ac-
cess to contraception for women who 
have painful menstrual cycles or other 
health conditions or who simply don’t 
want to have a child. 
It seems that these effects on women 
don’t matter to many on the far right, 
including MITCH MCCONNELL, who is al-
ready discussing a nationwide abortion 
ban that could threaten even Nevada’s 
legal protections. 
That is why my colleagues and I are 
standing up for legislation that will 
codify women’s reproductive freedoms 
into Federal law. The Women’s Health 
Protection Act will preserve the right 
to choose nationally and ensure that 
women have access to critical care. 
If we want our daughters to grow up 
with the same freedoms we have had 
for 50 years, we have to act now. We 
need to stand up for women in America 
and trust them to make their own deci-
sions about their health, their families, 
and their lives. 
I believe in American women, and 
that is why this fight for us is now. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from California. 
Mr. PADILLA. Madam President and 
colleagues, this past week, following 
the leaked Supreme Court opinion that 
threatens to overturn Roe v. Wade, 
thousands of Californians have reached 
out to my office in the form of phone 
calls, in the form of letters, and in the 
form of emails, all to voice their sup-
port for the right to choose. 
It is abundantly clear that Congress 
must pass the Women’s Health Protec-
tion Act and codify the right to an 
abortion into Federal law. 
Countless 
Californians 
and 
other 
Americans have spoken up—many in 
public, many in private—to share their 
own abortion stories. 
Think about the students who want 
to finish high school before starting a 
family. Think of survivors of sexual as-
sault, whose abortion reaffirmed their 
right to choose for their own bodies. 
Think 
of 
parents 
who 
desperately 
wanted a child but, upon becoming 
pregnant, learned the devastating news 
about dangerous health risks associ-
ated with that pregnancy. Think of the 
women whose lives were saved by an 
abortion, because abortion is often 
critical medical care. And think about 
women who remember a time a half a 
century ago, before Roe v. Wade se-
cured this right, a time when—don’t 
get me wrong—abortion still happened, 
but they were unsafe secrets at the 
time, when women risked their lives 
for the choice that they needed. 
I believe that the right to an abor-
tion is a fundamental right, and I am 
proud to represent a State that fiercely 
defends abortion access. California is 
committed to safe, respectful abortion 
care for all who need it. That is why 
Californians have stepped up this year, 
with some even traveling to aid women 
who were threatened by SB 8, the 
Texas law that prohibits abortion at 6 
weeks. This is the very law that Sen-
ator CORTEZ MASTO just referenced a 
few minutes ago, and it is why so many 
Californians are speaking up now. 
We know that your right to choose 
should not end at a State border, and it 
certainly shouldn’t rely on your in-
come or your transportation options or 
whether or not you can afford to take 
time off from work. 
All across America, a strong major-
ity support a woman’s right to make 
her own healthcare decisions. We can’t 
stand by and watch while rightwing 
politicians and judges seem to roll 
back the clock on women’s rights. That 
is why I am voting for the Women’s 
Health Protection Act and why I urge 
each and every one of you to do the 
same. 
We must secure the right to abortion 
nationwide. We must protect the fun-
damental rights of women across the 
country—not just in a few States but 
across the country. 
Congress can and must do this by 
passing the Women’s Health Protection 
Act.

UNANIMOUS

AGREE-
MENT—EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
Mr. PADILLA. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that notwith-
standing rule XXII, at a time to be de-
termined by the majority leader in 
consultation with the Republican lead-
er, the Senate proceed to executive ses-

NOMINATION OF ERIC M. 
GARCETTI 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
intend to lift my objection to pro-
ceeding to the consideration of the 
nomination of Mayor Eric Garcetti, of 
California, to be the U.S. Ambassador 
to India. 
Today, I released the findings of a 
staff review examining whether Mr. 
Garcetti was aware of allegations of 
misconduct by a former senior adviser. 
I am making these findings public in 
the interest of transparency and for 
the benefit of my colleagues as the 
Senate fulfills its advice and consent 
duties. I intend to lift my hold on the 
nomination, but based on what I have 
learned, I intend to vote no if the nom-
ination is considered by the full Sen-
ate.

port

f 
MEMORIAL DAY 
Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I 
rise today to honor and remember the 
veterans throughout Michigan’s his-
tory who have given their lives on be-
half of our country. 
Even before Michigan was a State, 
these brave patriots have been willing 
to risk everything—even their lives—in 
order to defend our Nation, our people, 
and our way of life. 
Perhaps the stakes were never higher 
than in World War II. Totalitarianism 
threatened free countries and free peo-
ple, echoes of which we are tragically 
seeing today in Ukraine. Americans— 
and Michiganders—would not stand by 
and watch democracy die. 
We planted victory gardens. We pur-
chased war bonds. And we built an Ar-
senal of Democracy strong enough to 
defeat dictators and defend freedom 
around the world. 
More than half a million Michigan 
men and women served in our Armed 
Forces. For more than 15,000 of them, 
it was the last thing they ever did. 
We can never repay them for their 
sacrifice. But we can remember them, 
honor them, and share their stories. 
That is the aim of the Michigan 
World War II Legacy Memorial in 
Royal Oak. Ground was broken for this 
special place just last month. 
The memorial will feature statues 
representing life on the battlefront and 
the homefront. A series of pillars will 
stand for Michigan’s contributions to 
the war. A brick walkway will tell the 
stories of those who fought and sac-
rificed. And a wall of stars will com-
memorate the lives that were lost. 
Each one of the 1,300 stars will rep-
resent more than 10 Michigan men and 
women who gave their lives for our 
country. One of those stars shines for 
Pfc. Walter Wetzel of Roseville. 
On the morning of April 3, 1945, Pfc. 
Wetzel was guarding his platoon’s com-
mand post when it came under fire. 
German troops fought their way close 
to the building and threw two grenades 
into the room Pfc. Wetzel was defend-
ing alongside his fellow soldiers. Pfc. 
Wetzel shouted a warning and threw 
himself on top of the grenades, sacri-
ficing his own life so that others could 
fight on. 
For this supreme act of bravery, Pfc. 
Wetzel was awarded the Medal of 
Honor, which is now on display at the 
Michigan 
Heroes 
Museum 
in 
Frankenmuth. 
Pfc. Wetzel deserves to be remem-
bered, as does everyone who laid down 
their lives for our country. It is incred-
ibly fitting that Michigan would honor 
their sacrifice in such a lasting way. 
This Memorial Day, we remember all 
Michigan veterans who gave their lives 
in service to our country. And we sa-
lute all of our veterans who are still 
with us. It is only because of their sac-
rifice that our democracy endures.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING EDWARD LEONARD 
MARCUS 
∑ Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise today with a heavy heart to 
pay tribute to Edward Leonard Marcus, 
an extraordinary public servant who 
passed away on May 5, 2022, at the age 
of 94. 
Born in Brooklyn, NY, Ed was a shin-
ing star from an early age in the class-
room and on the sports field. He at-
tended Yale University as an under-
graduate, where he also played foot-
ball, baseball, and basketball, as well 
as managed the wrestling team. In 1950, 
he obtained his LLB and LLD from 
Yale Law School. Inspired by the com-
munity involvement he enjoyed while 
at law school, Ed successfully ran for 
the board of alders, and, demonstrating 
his tremendous leadership skills, he 
quickly was elected majority leader. 
At the same time, Ed established the 
Marcus Law Firm, which would gain 
recognition 
for 
legal 
excellence 
throughout New England. 
Following his initial city political 
success, Ed was elected to the Con-
necticut Senate, where, again, his lead-
ership acumen and political prowess re-
sulted in him serving as the majority 
leader of the Connecticut State Senate 
for an impressive six terms. In 1992, he 
became the Democratic State chair-
man. 
Throughout his time in public serv-
ice, Ed thrived most when given the op-
portunity to debate with his peers and 
learn from those around him. He had a 
reputation as an obstinate, tough lead-
er, a credit to his well-earned con-
fidence and determination to help the 
people of Connecticut. Outside of work, 
Ed was a caring and compassionate 
man who valued his family above all 
else. 
Ed’s wife and three daughters exem-
plify the same generous spirit he em-
bodied. His wife, Jill, was elected chair 
of the Branford Police Commission in 
2015; his daughter, Shelley, is a judge 
on the Connecticut Superior Court; his 
daughter, Susan, enthusiastically sup-
ports the work of Ed’s law firm; and his 
daughter, Nicole, is a dedicated teach-
er. I have had the privilege of knowing 
the Marcus family and witnessing first-
hand their unstinting work to better 
Connecticut and the Nation. Ed’s tire-
less efforts will be an enduring legacy, 
and his wife and daughters continue 
this remarkable lifetime of service. 
My wife Cynthia and I extend our 
deepest sympathies to Jill, Shelley, 
Susan, Nicole, and all of Ed’s loved 
ones during this difficult time. May 
their many wonderful memories of Ed 
provide them solace and comfort in the 
days ahead. I hope my colleagues will 
join me in remembering Edward L. 
Marcus.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, 
Mr. RUBIO, Mr. HICKENLOOPER, 
Ms. MURKOWSKI, Mr. BENNET, 
Mrs. BLACKBURN, Mr. MANCHIN, 
Mr. PORTMAN, Mr. SCOTT
of 
Florida, 
Mr. 
PADILLA, 
Mr. 
BRAUN, and Mr. CORNYN): 
S. 4179. A bill to establish the Space 
National Guard; to the Committee on 
Armed Services. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise to speak in support of the Space 
National Guard Establishment Act of 
2021, which Senator RUBIO and I intro-
duced today. I thank Senator RUBIO 
along with our 10 bipartisan cosponsors 
for joining me on this important bill. 
When the Space Force was estab-
lished in 2019, Active-Duty space units 
were moved out of the Air Force and 
into the new Space Force, but National 
Guard space units were left behind in 
the Air National Guard under the Air 
Force. 
Active-Duty and Guard units per-
forming space missions are supposed to 
work together seamlessly, but they 
cannot do so if we leave them in sepa-
rate services. Today, we have 16 Air 
National Guard units with 1,000 mem-
bers performing space missions in a dif-
ferent service than their Active-Duty 
counterparts. 
This misalignment creates a number 
of problems. It inhibits the efficient 
and consistent provision of funding, 
equipment, 
talent, 
education, 
and 
training to our space units. 
This disconnect makes mobilization 
more complicated and separates them 
with different service processes and 
cultures. This is not how to construct a 
cohesive force, and if Congress is going 
to create a Space Force, then Congress 
should complete the job. 
The 
current 
misalignment 
is 
unsustainable. If it is not repaired, 
then National Guard units performing 
the space mission will wither on the 
vine. Those Air National Guard units 
will eventually be forced to give up the 
space mission and undertake a costly 
transition to another mission, or those 
units will be dissolved. 
This bill would shift our National 
Guard units performing space missions 
from the Air National Guard, which is 
part of the Air Force, to a Space Na-
tional Guard, which would fall under 
the Space Force. This bill does not au-
thorize new construction, bases, or per-
sonnel. It is a realignment, not an ex-
pansion. Future growth will be deter-
mined by mission needs as determined 
by the Pentagon, the administration, 
and Congress. 
This bill, which already has a com-
panion in the House, is the best way to 
preserve the talent and resources found 
in the National Guard’s space enter-
prise. We have invested a great deal in 
the training and experience held by the 
Guard’s space professionals. Many of 
them hold civilian jobs with leading- 
edge companies in relevant industries, 
and they put their experience to work 
for the Nation and their States every 
time they put on their uniform. We 
must not leave a bureaucratic wall be-
tween the Space Force and the Na-
tional Guard that will degrade our 
space capabilities. 
Just as important, the loss of these 
units would rob our Governors of crit-
ical National Guard personnel and re-
sources they need to respond to disas-
ters at home. 
In sum, this bill will fix a major dis-
connect in our Nation’s space enter-
prise by putting our National Guard 
space units in the same service as their 
Active-Duty counterparts. This is im-
portant for our Nation and for those 
that rely on the National Guard in our 
States. 
I hope my colleagues will join me in 
support of this bill.

system that improves patient outcomes and 
safety; 
Whereas the Future of Nursing report of 
the Institute of Medicine has highlighted the 
need for the nursing profession to meet the 
call for leadership in a team-based delivery 
model; 
Whereas, when nurse staffing levels in-
crease, the risk of patient complications and 
lengthy hospital stays decreases, resulting in 
cost savings; 
Whereas nurses are experienced research-
ers, and the work of nurses encompasses a 
wide scope of scientific inquiry, including 
clinical research, health systems and out-
comes research, and nursing education re-
search; 
Whereas nurses provide care that is sen-
sitive to the cultures and customs of individ-
uals across the United States; 
Whereas nurses are well-positioned to pro-
vide leadership to eliminate health care dis-
parities that exist in the United States; 
Whereas nurses are the cornerstone of the 
public 
health 
infrastructure, 
promoting 
healthy lifestyles and educating commu-
nities on disease prevention and health pro-
motion; 
Whereas nurses help inform, educate, and 
work closely with legislators to improve— 
(1) the education, retention, recruitment, 
and practice of all nurses; and 
(2) the health and safety of the patients for 
whom the nurses care; 
Whereas there is a need— 
(1) to strengthen nursing workforce devel-
opment programs at all levels, including the 
number of doctorally prepared faculty mem-
bers; and 
(2) to provide education to the nurse re-
search scientists who can develop new nurs-
ing care models to improve the health status 
of the diverse population of the United 
States; 
Whereas nurses touch the lives of the peo-
ple of the United States through every stage 
of life; and 
Whereas nursing has been voted the most 
honest and ethical profession in the United 
States: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the goals and ideals of Na-
tional Nurses Week, as founded by the Amer-
ican Nurses Association; 
(2) recognizes the significant contributions 
of nurses to the health care system in the

IN RECOGNITION OF THE MEN 
AND WOMEN WHO HAVE SERVED, 
OR ARE PRESENTLY SERVING, 
IN THE FOREIGN SERVICE OF 
THE UNITED STATES, AND HON-
ORING THE MEMBERS OF THE 
FOREIGN 
SERVICE 
WHO 
HAVE 
GIVEN THEIR LIVES IN THE LINE 
OF DUTY 
Mr. SULLIVAN (for himself, Mr. VAN 
HOLLEN, Mr. DURBIN, Mrs. SHAHEEN, 
Mr. KAINE, and Mr. MERKLEY) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which 
was considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 627 
Whereas the Foreign Service of the United 
States (referred to in this preamble as the 
‘‘Foreign Service’’) was established through 
the enactment of the Act entitled ‘‘An Act 
for the reorganization and improvement of 
the Foreign Service of the United States, 
and for other purposes.’’, approved May 24, 
1924 (43 Stat. 140, chapter 182) (commonly 
known as the ‘‘Rogers Act of 1924’’), and is 
now celebrating its 97th anniversary; 
Whereas the Rogers Act of 1924 established 
a career organization based on competitive 
examination and merit promotion; 
Whereas, in 2022, just less than 16,000 men 
and women of the Foreign Service are serv-
ing at home and abroad; 
Whereas Foreign Service personnel are 
supported by more than 60,000 locally en-
gaged staff in nearly 300 embassies and con-
sulates, who provide unique expertise and 
crucial links to host countries; 
Whereas Foreign Service personnel com-
prise employees from the Department of 
State, the United States Agency for Inter-
national Development, the Department of 
Commerce, the Foreign Agricultural Service, 
the Animal and Plant Health Inspection 
Service, and the United States Agency for 
Global Media; 
Whereas the diplomatic, consular, commu-
nications, trade, development, security, pub-
lic diplomacy, and numerous other functions 
that Foreign Service personnel perform con-
stitute the first and most cost-effective in-
strument of the United States to protect and 
promote United States interests abroad; 
Whereas the men and women of the For-
eign Service and their families are increas-
ingly exposed to risks and danger, even in 
times of peace, and many have died in the 
service of the United States; 
Whereas employees of the Foreign Service 
work daily— 
(1) to ensure the national security of the 
United States; 
(2) to provide assistance to United States 
citizens overseas; 
(3) to preserve peace, freedom, and eco-
nomic prosperity around the world;

United States, internationally recognized

racy; 
(5) to promote transparency, provide accu-
rate 
information, 
and 
combat 
disinformation; 
(6) to cultivate new markets for United 
States products and services and develop new 
investment opportunities that create jobs in 
the United States and promote prosperity; 
(7) to promote economic development, re-
duce poverty, end hunger and malnutrition, 
fight disease, combat international crime 
and illegal drugs, and address environmental 
degradation; and 
(8) to provide emergency and humanitarian 
assistance to respond to crises around the 
world; 
Whereas, in response to the unprecedented 
global COVID–19 pandemic, all of the foreign 
affairs agencies of the United States have 
worked tirelessly to support the people of 
the United States, often placing their own 
safety and well-being at risk; 
Whereas the foreign affairs agencies and 
the American Foreign Service Association 
have observed Foreign Service Day in May 
for many years; and 
Whereas it is both appropriate and just for 
the United States as a whole to recognize the 
dedication of the men and women of the For-
eign Service and to honor the members of 
the Foreign Service who have given their 
lives in the loyal pursuit of their duties and 
responsibilities representing the interests of 
the United States and of its citizens: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) honors the men and women who have 
served, or are presently serving, in the For-
eign Service of the United States for their 
dedicated and important service to the 
United States;

present, and future employees of the Foreign 
Service of the United States, wherever they

Whereas, on Kids to Parks Day, individuals 
from rural, suburban, and urban areas of the

and public land, often with free access, to in-
dividuals seeking outdoor recreation;

JEFFERSON HIGH SCHOOL 50TH 
ANNIVERSARY 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 10, 2022 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and celebrate Jefferson 
High School’s Class of 1972 on their 50th 
High School reunion. 
After being rivals for many years, the 
Edgewater Mustangs and the Mountain Wild-
cats combined their student bodies to form the 
newest high school in Jefferson County. From 
its inception, Jefferson High School has been 
a focal point for the northern Lakewood, 
Edgewater and eastern Wheat Ridge commu-
nities. The new school’s name, mascot, colors, 
and song were voted on by both student bod-
ies in 1955, with Saint Jeff becoming the mas-
cot of the school. The image of Saint Jeff was 
created by Bob Harvey, an Edgewater grad-
uate, and symbolizes the honorable qualities 
of a fighting spirit. Today, that spirit of coming 
together continues as Jefferson High School 
honors all who come together for our school, 
our community, and our world. 
As an alumni of Jefferson High School, I’m 
a proud ‘‘Saint’’ and know that many other 
‘‘Saints’’ come from all over Jefferson County. 
The commitment to the students and the com-
munity has remained a top priority. Jefferson 
High School alumni have gone on to work in 
various industries ranging from public service, 
healthcare, law enforcement, entrepreneur-
ship, to name a few. The song for the Class 
of 1972 class was, ‘‘You’ve Got a Friend’’ 
which is fitting for the many long-lasting friend-
ships that came from that graduating class yet 
the diverse career paths and endeavors which 
continue to make the world a better place. 
From one Saint to another, congratulations 
to Jefferson High School’s Class of 1972 on 
their 50th High School Reunion. I thank them 
for their numerous contributions to our com-
munity and state. We are lucky to have them 
in our community and wish them best of luck 
in the coming years.

RECOGNIZING CHAD SCHMIDT OF 
NUTRIEN AG SOLUTIONS 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 10, 2022 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Chad Schmidt of Nutrien Ag So-
lutions, an agricultural business that was hon-
ored by achieving a national certification from 
the ResponsibleAg Certification Program. 
ResponsibleAg is a non-profit organization 
founded in 2014 to promote public welfare. It 
is a successful voluntary initiative that pro-
vides a comprehensive assessment of agricul-
tural facilities that store and handle farm input 
supplies such as fertilizer, crop protection 
products, seed, and fuel. Certification requires 
that a facility meet stringent regulatory-based 
criteria, implement industry leading safety and 
security measures, and uphold facility safety 
as one of its highest priorities. 
Nutrien Ag Solutions provides full-acre solu-
tions through a network of trusted crop con-
sultants at more than 1,700 global locations. 
They help growers achieve the highest yields 
with the most sustainable solutions possible, 
offering a wide selection of crop seed, protec-
tion and nutrition that help farmers across the 
world. 
It is because of industry leaders such as 
Chad that I am especially proud to serve Illi-
nois’ 17th Congressional District. Madam 
Speaker, I would like to again formally con-
gratulate Chad Schmidt and Nutrien Ag Solu-
tions on receiving national certification from 
the ResponsibleAg Certification Program.

H.R. 5615 would require the Federal Emer-
gency Management Agency (FEMA) to sub-
mit a plan to the Congress to ensure that 
federal assistance is available to certain 
urban jurisdictions under the Urban Area Se-
curity Initiative (UASI). UASI provides 
grants to state and local law enforcement 
agencies in urban areas that are at high-risk 
for acts of terrorism to cover the costs of 
planning, equipment, and training. Specifi-
cally, the act would require that grants be 
made available under the program for at 
least three consecutive years to jurisdictions 
that did not receive UASI funding in the cur-
rent fiscal year. 
In developing the plan, FEMA would be re-
quired to survey urban jurisdictions to con-
firm the need for federal assistance. Based on 
the cost of similar plans, CBO estimates that 
implementing H.R. 5615 would cost less than 
$500,000 over the 2022–2026 period; any spend-
ing would be subject to the availability of 
appropriated funds. 
The CBO staff contact for this estimate is 
Jon Sperl. The estimate was reviewed by H. 
Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Director of Budg-
et Analysis.

HONORING THE MEMORY OF 
HORACE MILTON TAFF 
HON. BARRY MOORE 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 10, 2022 
Mr. MOORE of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
today, I recognize the life of Mr. Horace Milton 
Taff, who passed away peacefully on April 20, 
2022, at his home in Montgomery, Alabama. 
At a young age, Milton answered his coun-
try’s call to action and joined the United States 
Army, where he bravely served throughout 
World War II and the Korean War. Following 
his service during World War II, Milton at-
tended Auburn University to study electrical 
engineering and grew as a leader in the Alpha 
Tau Omega (ATO) Fraternity. 
While studying at Auburn, Milton met his fu-
ture wife, Eloise ‘‘Sis’’ Jordan. He soon fell 
head over heels, and following his graduation 
with honors in 1951, Milton and Sis were mar-
ried. 
Soon after, Milton began his career at the 
Alabama Power Company, initially working as 
its lead engineer in Montgomery and later as 
its Auburn District Manager in 1957. In 1971, 
Milton was promoted to the position of Mont-
gomery District Manager, overseeing oper-
ations in the largest district in the State of Ala-
bama. 
During his time in Auburn, Milton served as 
the President of the Auburn Chamber of Com-
merce, the President of the Alabama State 
Jaycee, the Vice President of the National 
Jaycee, 
and 
the 
President 
of 
the 
Saugahatchee Country Club.

May 10, 2022 
A devout Auburn fan, Milton also faithfully 
served as the official timekeeper of the Auburn 
Men’s Basketball team for over thirty years. 
Milton retired from the Alabama Power 
Company in 1989; however, he remained ac-
tive in his local community—elected to serve 
on the Alabama Silver Haired Legislature and 
the Montgomery County Republican Executive 
Committee. 
Milton was also a committed member of the 
Capital City Kiwanis Club, and he was a legis-
lative volunteer for the Alabama Children’s 
Trust Fund. Due to his extensive record of 
serving the men, women, and children of Ala-
bama, Milton was later inducted into The Ala-
bama Senior Citizens Hall of Fame. 
Milton spent much of his retirement with his 
family at their vacation home on Lake Martin, 
Alabama. He and his wife Sis enjoyed hosting 
their friends and family—often taking their chil-
dren and grandchildren boating on Milton’s 
pontoon boat. 
Milton was preceded in death by his be-
loved wife of sixty-six years, Eloise ‘‘Sis’’ Jor-
dan Taff; his parents Freeman and Elizabeth 
Short Taff; his brothers Clarence, Hillary, and 
Foy Taff; and his beloved granddaughter, 
Lauren Nicole Taff. 
He is survived by his seven children: Terry, 
Jerry, Mickey, Kathy, Joey, Betsy, and Davy; 
thirteen grandchildren; and four great-grand-
children. 
Milton’s lifetime of service and passion for 
his community has without a doubt created a 
lasting legacy for his friends, his family, and 
the entire state of Alabama. On April 20, 2022, 
Milton passed away at the age of 95, and he 
will be sorely missed.

SUPPORTING 
H.R. 
1437, 
THE 
PRECIP ACT OF 2021 AND H.R. 
5324, THE NWR MODERNIZATION 
ACT 
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 10, 2022 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I rise in support of H.R. 1437, the ‘‘Providing 
Research and Estimates of Changes in Pre-
cipitation’’, or ‘‘PRECIP Act’’. I also rise in sup-
port of H.R. 5324, the ‘‘NWR Modernization 
Act of 2021’’. 
I am proud to be an original cosponsor of 
Representative SHERRILL’s bipartisan PRECIP 
Act. As Chairwoman of the Science Commit-
tee’s 
Environment 
Subcommittee, 
Ms. 
SHERRILL has been a leader in improving our 
understanding how to plan for excess precipi-
tation, which can often lead to severe flooding 
in inland areas. This bipartisan bill is a direct 
result of significant stakeholder engagement to 
understand the needs of local governments, 
dam safety officials, floodplain managers, and 
more, who use precipitation estimates regu-
larly. Precipitation estimates are critical for life- 
and-death decisions, like whether to issue an 
evacuation order, and also inform flood maps 
and zoning restrictions. 
Current 
estimates 
for 
precipitation 
fre-
quency, or precipitation atlas, and PMPs are 
outdated, inconsistent across the country, and 
infrequently updated. The PRECIP Act directs 
NOAA to update precipitation estimates on a 
regular basis, and to ensure these estimates 
consider the effects of future climate change. 
In order to address this knowledge gap, this 
bill directs the NOAA Administrator to enter 
into an agreement with the National Acad-
emies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 
to conduct a consensus study on best prac-
tices for estimating precipitation. These best 
practices will be useful for updating Probable 
Maximum Precipitation, or PMP, estimates. 
This bill also directs NOAA to update pre-
cipitation frequency estimates, including PMP 
estimates, no less than every 10 years, but we 
encourage them to consider more frequent up-
dates when feasible. NOAA is also required to 
develop a National Guidance Document for 
precipitation methodologies. While the results 
of the Academies’ study should inform the de-
velopment of this National Guidance Docu-
ment, we encourage NOAA not to delay any 
updates to PMPs, and the creation of a Na-
tional Guidance Document for the final study, 
and to undertake these activities concurrently 
upon enactment of this bill. 
Changes in precipitation are already being 
felt across the country, and it is critical for our 
local decision makers to have the most accu-
rate information on hand to protect our com-
munities. The activities authorized in the 
PRECIP Act will take a big step forward in 
doing this. I want to thank Representative 
SHERRILL for her work on this thoughtful, bipar-
tisan, legislation and I urge my colleagues to 
support its passage. 
I also rise in support of the bipartisan NWR 
Modernization Act of 2021 led by Representa-
tives BICE and SHERRILL, the Ranking Member 
and Chairwoman of the Environment Sub-
committee on House Science. NOAA Weather 
Radio, or NWR, is a critical lifeline for Ameri-
cans across the country. It provides contin-
uous coverage of weather information and 
broadcasts National Weather Service warn-
ings, watches, forecasts. It also provides infor-
mation after natural disasters and other haz-
ardous events. 
This important bill will expand NOAA Weath-
er Radio coverage by directing NOAA to ac-
quire additional transmitters. It will ensure that 
underserved communities are within range to 
receive the important alerts. The bill will also 
update telecommunications infrastructure and 
software that are critical to the system. I want 
to thank Representatives BICE and SHERRILL 
for their bipartisan work on this bill that will 
bring the NOAA Weather Radio into the 21st 
century. 
Both of these bipartisan bills will provide 
benefits to Americans across the country, and 
are the product of good bipartisan work by 
Members of the Science Committee. I urge my 
colleagues to support their passage.

LUISA WILSON 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 10, 2022 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Luisa Wilson 
for her creative and unique drawing, earning 
her first place in the 2022 Congressional Art 
Competition. 
As a participant in the art show and student 
at Golden High School, Luisa created a work 
of art entitled, ‘‘Stretched’’ which depicts a 
white face on a black background being pulled 
back by three hands. It is created with ink on 
paper. 
Luisa spent countless hours and used nu-
merous tools to learn new techniques and re-
fine her painting skills and education in the 
arts. I appreciate her participation in the com-
petition and the support provided by her 
teachers at Golden High School. 
Congratulations to Luisa Wilson for her hard 
work and participation in the 2022 Congres-
sional Art Competition. I am certain she will 
exhibit the same dedication and character in 
her future accomplishments, and I wish her 
the best of luck going forward.

CONGRATULATING 
HALEY 
STE-
VENSON FOR BEING THE FIRST 
FEMALE FIREFIGHTER IN THE 
HISTORY 
OF 
THE 
GALESBURG 
FIRE DEPARTMENT 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 10, 2022 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate City of Galesburg Firefighter 
Haley Stevenson on being sworn in as the first 
female firefighter in the history of the Gales-
burg Fire Department. 
Growing up in Galesburg, Illinois, Haley Ste-
venson was enamored with the prospect of 
one day becoming a firefighter. Her father, re-
tired Galesburg Fire Department Deputy Chief 
Brad Stevenson, was her role model, an admi-
rable individual who served with honor. As she 
progressed through life, she continued to 
apply herself with diligence as she strived to-
ward this goal, despite the Department never 
having had a female firefighter before her. On 
May 2, 2022, that changed when Stevenson 
was sworn into the Galesburg Fire Department 
at 22 years old. Firefighter Stevenson’s father 
taught her how to pass the written test and 
oral interview. She also handily passed the 
physical agility test on her way to fulfilling her 
lifelong dream. Firefighter Stevenson is a trail-
blazer. Her presence in the Department will 
serve as a constant reminder to her peers and 
community to be unafraid of breaking barriers. 
It is because of selfless leaders such as 
Firefighter Haley Stevenson that I am espe-
cially proud to serve Illinois’ 17th Congres-
sional District. Madam Speaker, I would like 
to, again, formally recognize Firefighter Haley 
Stevenson on being sworn in as the first fe-
male firefighter in Galesburg Fire Department 
history.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
HON. CHRIS STEWART

HONORING THE LATE SECRETARY 
NORMAN MINETA 
HON. ROBERT C. ‘‘BOBBY’’ SCOTT 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 10, 2022 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, as 
a proud member of the Congressional Asian 
Pacific American Caucus, I rise today to pay 
tribute to the founding Chair of our caucus and 
a dedicated public servant, the late Secretary 
Norman Mineta, who passed away on May 3, 
2022. 
It was an honor to serve my first term in 
Congress alongside Congressman Mineta. 
Norman was the son of Japanese immigrants 
who were held in an internment camp during 
World War II, and he would later became one 
of our country’s highest-profile Asian American 
political leaders. In 1971, Norman was the first 
Asian American to lead a major U.S. city when 
he was elected Mayor of San Jose, California. 
In 1974, he was elected to the United States 
House of Representatives from California’s 
13th congressional district. He went on to 
serve ten terms in Congress and served as 
the Chairman of the House Committee on 
Transportation and Infrastructure. 
In 2000, President Bill Clinton appointed 
Norman to be U.S. Secretary of Commerce 
and he became the first Asian American to 
hold a cabinet position. President George W. 
Bush appointed him U.S. Secretary of Trans-
portation in 2001, making him just the fourth 
person to serve in the cabinet of two presi-
dents from different political parties. He was 
highly influential in creating the Transportation 
Security Administration (TSA) in the wake of 
the September 11th terrorist attacks. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that all my col-
leagues join in paying tribute to an extraor-
dinary American and public servant.

HONORING COLONEL IGWEKALA 
EDWIN NJOKU 
HON. BARBARA LEE 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 10, 2022 
Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today as we celebrate the retirement of 
Colonel Igwekala Edwin Njoku after 28 years 
of service with the United States Army and 27 
years of federal civil service with the Depart-
ment of Energy. Colonel Njoku’s decades of 
leadership and commitment to excellence 
have helped to set the strategic direction of 
the federal government and ensure the secu-
rity and prosperity of our country. 
Originally from Nigeria, Col. Njoku arrived in 
the United States in 1971 on a student visa. 
He attended the University of Massachusetts 
where he received a Bachelor of Science De-
gree in Applied Biology and a Masters Degree 
in Health Physics and Nuclear Science. He 
later attended the New York Institute of Tech-
nology where he earned a second Masters 
Degree in Industrial Hygiene and Environ-
mental Engineering Technology. 
Col. Njoku eventually moved from the East 
Coast to California where he worked for the 
state Department of Health Services as a Sen-
ior Health Physicist. Shortly after, he joined 
the California Army National Guard and later 
the U.S. Army Reserve. He served 28 years in 
the U.S. Army where he provided oversight on 
emergency response systems to the use of 
Weapons of Mass Destruction on the battle-
field. 
In addition to his consultant capacity, Col. 
Njoku gave on the ground support abroad. He 
spent a year deployed in Iraq as the Com-
bined Joint Task Force–7 Radiation Protection 
and Laser Safety Officer. He also traveled to 
the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to 
implement the 1994 Agreed Framework, which 
suspended North Korea’s nuclear power pro-
gram in exchange for U.S. energy aid. When 
he retired from the U.S. Army as a Colonel, he 
was awarded the Legion of Merit for his work 
with the Joint Forces in Iraq, and his work on 
non-proliferation efforts in the Korean Penin-
sula. 
On the civilian side, Col. Njoku served as a 
Certified Health Physicist with the National Nu-
clear Security Administration within the U.S. 
Department of Energy. During his 27 years of 
service, he ensured that radiological oper-
ations were implemented safely and improved 
federal oversight for various facilities and of-
fices without expanding the oversight footprint. 
Edwin Njoku’s decades of service to the 
U.S. Army and the Department of Energy has 
truly had a global impact and has helped rein-
force the security of our country and the world. 
I know that his impact and commitment to ex-
cellence will continue to reverberate in the 
years to come. 
On a personal note, I’ve had the privilege of 
knowing Col. Njoku for more than 20 years 
and greatly admire his scientific brilliance and 
unwavering commitment to public service. I’m 
honored to have had his support over the 
years and wish him a wonderful and well-de-
served retirement. One behalf of the 13th 
Congressional District of California, I com-
mend Col. Igwekala Edwin Njoku for his tire-
less service and dedication.

CELEBRATING THE ROCK ISLAND 
ARSENAL’S 160TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 10, 2022 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the Rock Island Arsenal’s 160th 
Anniversary. The Rock Island Arsenal is a 
major Army installation and a home to more 
than 80 organizations that provide important 
products and services to our Armed Forces. 
The arsenal is a prominent employer in the 
Rock Island area with over 6,000 military, civil-
ian and contractor personnel. 
The Rock Island Arsenal was established in 
1862 by an Act of Congress, with a mission to 
deliver base support and enhance readiness 
for a globally-responsive Army. Major Charles 
P. Kingsbury was the first Commanding Offi-
cer of the Rock Island Arsenal and during his 
tenure he located and designed three build-
ings for the arsenal. The second officer to 
command the arsenal was Brevet Brigadier 
General Thomas J. Rodman, also called the 
‘‘Father of Rock Island Arsenal,’’ who rede-
signed the arsenal on a much grander scale. 
After his passing in 1871, Lieutenant Colonel 
Daniel Flagler oversaw the construction of 
much of the arsenal buildings. 
It is because of vital organizations such as 
the Rock Island Arsenal that I am especially 
proud to serve Illinois’ 17th Congressional Dis-
trict. Madam Speaker, I would like to again 
formally celebrate the Rock Island Arsenal’s 
160th Anniversary.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF DR. MAUDA L. MONGER 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 10, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the service of 
a remarkable individual, Dr. Mauda L. Monger. 
Dr. Mauda Monger is a native of Jackson, 
Mississippi. She has a Bachelor of Arts in Ec-
onomics/Business 
Administrations 
from 
Tougaloo College, and a master’s degree in 
Public Health, Health Policy & Management, 
and most recently, her doctoral degree in 
Higher Education Leadership from Jackson 
State University. With more than 16 years of 
experience in HIV/AIDS, Monger has pre-
sented on both the local and national level. 
Her experience spans technical assistance 
and curriculum development and facilitation. 
Her presentation style is both personable and 
innovative with a structure that is focused on 
eliminating health disparities. 
Dr. Monger has provided training to health 
care professionals in various settings to in-
clude primary care, Ryan White, federally 
qualified health centers and social services. 
Her key areas of focus are to build effective 
relationships between community and clinical 
partners while developing trainings that are 
comprehensive and informative while devel-
oping regional and national partners in getting 
Mississippi to reduce the number of persons 
infected with HIV and increase retention in 
care and viral suppression. 
Communities 
of 
special 
focus 
include 
women, persons of color, specifically African 
Americans and marginalized communities to 
include persons who are Lesbian, Gay, Bisex-
ual and/or Transgender. Her passionate and 
data-focused style of education reinforces her 
goal ensuring the clinical community recog-
nizes how stigma and social determinants of 
health impact access to care, thus the impor-
tance of creating welcoming and inclusive clin-
ical environments. She is author and co-author 
on numerous papers, abstracts and has pre-
sented extensively on HIV prevention, social 
determinants of health, special populations, 
HIV stigma. 
In addition to her current, ongoing respon-
sibilities, Monger is an active alumnus of La-
nier High School’s Health Initiative and board 
President OurTime Adult Day Care, Inc. 
In 2014, Dr. Monger founded The SHE 
Project, a mentoring/community service pro-
gram; focused to build young African Amer-
ican women to be leaders in the community. 
She is driven by the mantra ‘‘To whom much 
is given, much is required’’. It’s in this space 
that Dr. Monger provides a roadmap to 
women seeking to achieve their personal and 
professional goals. 
When she is not educating, mentoring, or 
speaking, Dr. Monger enjoys journaling, trav-
eling and just a lazy day on the beach. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life, legacy, and service of 
Dr. Mauda L. Monger.

MAN AND BROTHER BELOVED 
HON. DANNY K. DAVIS 
OF ILLINOIS

Tuesday, May 10, 2022 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, I include in the RECORD the following 
Proclamation: 
Whereas, the Almighty God has called to 
his eternal rest our friend and brother Mr. 
David Ware; and 
Whereas, David was a delightful, well-bal-

humanitarian spirit, a great work ethic, a high 
energy level and love for humanity; and 
Whereas, David never forgot his roots and 
spent a great deal of time in and around the 
community where he grew up and went to 
school, especially Farragut, where he, my wife 
Vera, Heavy Weight Boxing Champion Ernie 
Terrell, our good friend Frank Lipscomb and 
Howard Saffold, a founder of the Afro Patrol-
men’s League were school mates. I always 
knew David to be a man of principle, he was 
a good man, creative, always had an idea, a 
new venture, he contributed to my political 
campaign efforts, and I am sure to others as 
well. David was a connector and kept me 
abreast of his church activities, as a matter of 
fact it was, he who introduced me to his Pas-
tor and her husband, he took us to lunch, and 
paid for it. The bible says that the steps of a 
good man are ordered by the Lord. 
I am so grateful that the Good Lord blessed 
me to know the Good Man, David Ware and 
my family and I extend our heart-felt condo-
lences to this wife, family, and friends.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF 
ARTHUR CLEVELAND HESTER 
HON. SHARICE DAVIDS 
OF KANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 10, 2022 
Ms. DAVIDS of Kansas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to celebrate the life of Mr. Arthur 
‘‘Art’’ Cleveland Hester. Mr. Hester led an ac-
complished life, serving his nation during a 
time of war, and influencing the next genera-
tion. He leaves behind a large family and com-
munity that will miss him greatly. 
Mr. Hester was dedicated to serving this na-
tion diligently throughout his life, and this is 
well exemplified by his military service. After 
graduating The United States Military Acad-
emy with a degree in mechanical engineering, 
Mr. Hester served two campaigns in Vietnam 
where he was a commissioned officer in the 
U.S. Army. He earned several commendations 
for his service, including the Silver Star, 
Bronze Star, and the Purple Heart. But of 
course, he was most proud of his time as an 
Airborne Ranger. After returning to the United 
States, he received a master’s degree in Fi-
nance from New York University and a mas-
ter’s degree in industrial engineering from 
Stanford University. When he retired from ac-
tive duty in 1981, he became a reservist in the 
Army and began working at the General Mo-
tors Fairfax Assembly Plant in Kansas City, 
Kansas. He would devote much of his career 
to automotive manufacturing, working in plants 
across the country as a manager and super-
visor. Even when he eventually left GM in 
1998, he continued to work in automotive 
manufacturing as a founding partner of engi-
neering firm CHB and as a program manager 
who provided technical support to automotive 
and manufacturing organizations. 
Mr. Hester was generous with his time, 
often choosing to help mentor young people at 
his church and in his local community. I will al-
ways be grateful to Mr. Hester for serving on

INTRODUCTION 
OF 
THE 
PRO-
MOTING 
HEALTHIER 
LIFELONG 
IMPROVEMENTS 
IN 
FOOD 
AND 
EXERCISE ACT OF 2022 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 10, 2022 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise to in-
troduce the Promoting Healthier Lifelong Im-
provements in Food and Exercise Act of 2022, 
or the LIFE Act, which would authorize a na-
tional initiative to combat a major health prob-
lem in the United States that cannot be rem-
edied through the health care system alone. 
Increasing rates of overweight and obesity are 
found among Americans of every age, race 
and major demographic group, and threaten 
the health of Americans like no other condition 
or disease. In fact, the key to eliminating many 
of the most serious health conditions is not 
only to reduce overweight and obesity, but 
also to encourage exercise of all kinds. 
This bill would provide $25 million to the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) for a coordinated national effort to re-
verse increasingly sedentary lifestyles and 
diets that are high in fat and sugar. Specifi-
cally, this bill would require the CDC to estab-
lish the first national strategy to combat the 
overweight and obesity epidemic. The CDC, 
either directly or through grants to states and 
local organizations, would train health profes-
sionals to recognize the signs of overweight 
and obesity early in order to educate Ameri-
cans about proper nutrition and regular exer-
cise; conduct public education campaigns 
about how to recognize and address over-
weight and obesity; and develop intervention 
strategies for use in everyday life, such as in 
the workplace and community settings. 
The National Survey of Children’s Health 
found that 16.2 percent of children ages 10 to 
17 had obesity in 2019–2020. The CDC Na-
tional Center for Health Statistics reports that 
Type 2 Diabetes, once considered an adult 
disease, is now widespread among children. 
The rising cost of the health care system, in-
cluding insurance premiums, reflects this epi-
demic. Today, chronic diseases, many of 
which are caused or exacerbated by over-
weight and obesity, account for 70 percent of 
all deaths in the U.S. and 75 percent of U.S. 
medical care costs, according to the National 
Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and 
Health Promotion. A focused national health 
initiative would provide guidance to state and 
local governments to engage in similar pro-
grams. 
A national focus could lead to changes, 
such as greater participation in high school 
physical education classes, which dropped 
from 42 percent in 1991 to 23 percent in 2020, 
according to the Youth Risk Behavior Surveil-
lance System. Changes in nutrition are equally 
critical because more than half of all young 
people consume too much fat, a factor in the 
increase of overweight youth. Data also show 
an increase in unhealthy eating habits for 
adults and no change in physical activity. 
To cite an example of the need for action, 
the District of Columbia is one of the fittest cit-
ies in the U.S., according to a 2019 study by 
the American College of Sports Medicine, yet, 
even here, obesity continues to be a severe 
problem. Approximately one-fifth of District 
residents are considered obese. Most of the 
obesity epidemic is exercise- and food-related. 
I urge support for this important bill to mobi-
lize the country before entirely preventable 
health conditions, which often begin in child-
hood, overwhelm the Nation’s health care sys-
tem.

HON. ED PERLMUTTER

Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Peyton 
Duplessis for his creative and unique photo-
graph, earning him the top photography award 
in the 2022 Congressional Art Competition. 
As a participant in the art show and student 
at Wheat Ridge High School, Peyton created 
a work of art entitled, ‘‘Beyond the Glass’’. 
The artwork uses digital photography and is 
meant to show the reflection of an eye through 
a glass. 
Peyton spent countless hours and used nu-
merous tools to learn new techniques and re-
fine his photography skills and education in 
the arts. I appreciate his participation in the 
competition and the support provided by his 
teachers at Wheat Ridge High School. 
Congratulations to Peyton Duplessis for his 
hard work and participation in the 2022 Con-
gressional Art Competition. I am certain he will 
exhibit the same dedication and character in 
his future accomplishments, and I wish him 
the best of luck going forward.

HONORING THE LIFE OF GEORGE 
WASHINGTON REEVE 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 10, 2022 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the life of George Washington Reeve. 
George was a great man who worked hard for 
everything he earned in life. He grew up poor 
with a single mom. His first job was sweeping 
shop fronts. He had to work at a gas station 
to pay for college. He was a landscaper. 
Living the American dream is an overused 
phrase. But I cannot help but use that phrase 
with 
George. 
George 
moved 
up 
from 
landscaper to Vice President at the Del Webb 
Corporation in a period of only six years. 
And it was in the completion of the little 
things—small tasks that are often overlooked 
that led to George’s professional break. The 
owner of the company, Mr. Webb, made an 
off-hand comment on a possible improvement 
for the property. By the next day, George had 
implemented the suggestion. He was not even 
asked. He just did it. We should all learn a 
lesson from George that the competent fulfill-
ment of our daily duties can lead to human 
success, but more importantly—and as a man 
of faith also, I know George is nodding his 
head in heaven—God sees and appreciates 
all our small efforts no matter how things turn 
out. 
George went on to found a very successful 
real estate company, George W. Reeve Enter-
prises. The diligence, care, and competence 
George placed in his professional work over-
flowed into his personal life. George mentored 
a whole host of people seeking real estate ex-
perience. What they got was way more than 
just professional knowledge. They were ex-
posed to the kindness and thoughtfulness of a 
man who cared more about their personal 
happiness than anything else. 
George started the George W. Reeve Foun-
dation for the purpose of teaching children to 
share his love of nature. George was very 
close to his children, Renee and Derek, as 
well as his grandson Hadden and grand-
daughter Tatum. 
George built a chapel on his lonely, beau-
tiful ranch in Cornville, AZ, where he spent so 
much time. Through all the business of his life, 
George never forgot to honor God, who he ap-
preciated and saw in nature. To Renee, 
Derek, Hadden, and Tatum, I know your father 
and grandfather is watching over you. I hope 
his children and grandchildren especially re-
member him when life gets tough and those 
little duties become so hard. I hope they take 
a moment and step outside when it especially 
hurts, and remember their dad and grand-
father in the nature he loved so much. God 
Bless them all.

RECOGNIZING 
GUAM’S 
STAR-
GAZERS 
DANCE 
TROUPE 
AS 
THEY CELEBRATE 30 YEARS IN 
THE DANCE INDUSTRY 
HON. MICHAEL F. Q. SAN NICOLAS 
OF GUAM 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 10, 2022 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Guam’s Stargazers Dance 
Troupe for their extraordinary talents, awarded 
performances, and continued commitment as 
ambassadors of our island community. I would 
like to further congratulate Mr. Mark Gonzales 
for thirty years of leadership in fostering the 
talents, skills, and passions of rising Guam 
dancers through his company. 
As a young freshman in high school, Mark’s 
passion for dance fueled his desire to invest in 
himself and others. When the original founder 
of Stargazers was faced with the choice to 
permanently close its doors, Mark committed 
to re-establishing the dance group and pro-
moting its growth in 1992. With humble begin-
nings traced back to rehearsals in Mark’s ga-
rage and on Guam’s beaches, the company 
has dramatically emerged as a vital force in 
our dance and larger island communities. In 
addition to hosting countless company produc-
tions and workshops for the public to enjoy, 
our people have had the opportunity to wit-
ness a wide range of performances from the 
group at local festivals and other events held 
in places like the Guam Premier Outlets, Mi-
cronesia Mall, and Agana Shopping Center.

Moreover, the Stargazers Dance Troupe has 
successfully collaborated with other organiza-
tions. This notably includes work with the 
Guam Allied Dance Force in producing a 2020 
virtual Christmas dance festival to celebrate 
the season of giving, benefit the Salvation 
Army Guam, and uplift the spirits of the Peo-
ple of Guam amid the challenges and uncer-
tainties imposed by the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Over the years, Stargazers have used their 
gifts and talents to elevate our island’s pres-
ence abroad. From performing on national tel-
evision in the Philippines, to earning numerous 
national championships in the U.S. and Can-
ada, and taking the stage at California 
Disneyland and Disney World, Florida, they 
have proudly represented Guam, garnered 
many national and international awards, and 
showcased to the rest of the world the great-
ness to be discovered in our small region of 
the Pacific. Their recent accomplishments in 
the 2019 Luv 2 Dance Competition have dis-
tinctly lengthened an already extensive list of 
accolades. After facing off against a wealth of 
other experienced competitors, Guam’s Star-
gazers rose to the top as Large Group Na-
tional Champions while simultaneously obtain-
ing the Top National Sapphire Studio Award, 
Best Choreography Award, and the first-ever 
Legacy Award—an award created to recog-
nize an outstanding dance group that made an 
impact, demonstrated showmanship and stu-
dio spirit, and developed meaningful connec-
tions with other dancers throughout the week 
of competition. 
On behalf of the People of Guam, I would 
like to extend a proud congratulations to our 
Stargazers for their success in earning na-
tional and international recognition across 
competition 
and 
entertainment 
platforms. 
Dancing is a form of art and expression that 
truly provides the opportunity to connect with, 
empower, and inspire others, and I applaud 
the Stargazers Dance Troupe for continuously 
accomplishing these objectives. I further com-
mend Mr. Mark Gonzales for his dedication to 
encouraging generations of Guam’s youth with 
the space to learn the value of hard work, cul-
tivate their passions, and pursue their dreams. 
It is truly an honor to watch the Stargazers 
Dance Troupe story unfold, and I look forward 
to seeing the next chapter of their journey as 
they set out to represent our island once again 
in Atlantic City’s That’s Entertainment Per-
forming Arts Competition in July.

Brooklyn spent countless hours and used 
numerous tools to learn new techniques and 
refine her painting skills and education in the 
arts. I appreciate her participation in the com-
petition and the support provided by her 
teachers at Ralston Valley High School. 
Congratulations to Brooklyn Hector for her

COLONEL JEFFERY B. EDWARDS 
HON. CLIFF BENTZ 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 10, 2022 
Mr. BENTZ. Madam Speaker, I rise to rec-
ognize Colonel Jeffrey B. Edwards, United 
States Air Force, for his exceptional dedication 
and distinguished service to the United States 
of America. Colonel Edwards will retire on 
May 15, 2022, from his current assignment as 
the Commander of the 173rd Fighter Wing at 
Kingsley Field in Klamath Falls, Oregon. We 
thank him for his commitment to our country 
over the past 27 years. 
Colonel Edwards graduated from the United 
States Air Force Academy in 1995. His first 
mission took him to Elmendorf Air Force Base 
in Alaska, then to Tyndall Air Force Base in 
Florida, and then Osan Air Base in the Repub-
lic of Korea. During his time in Alaska, he was 
deployed twice to defend our nation, which in-
cluded 
52 
combat 
sorties 
in 
Operation 
SOUTHERN WATCH in Iraq and Operation 
ALLIED FORCE, over eastern Europe. In 
2000, he was assigned to Tyndall Air Force 
Base in Florida, where he served as an F– 
15C fighter pilot instructor, training the next 
generation of fighter pilots. In 2003, Colonel 
Edwards was stationed in Osan Air Base in 
the Republic of Korea as the Chief of Air De-
fense Plans for the 7th Air Force. After his 
service in Korea, in 2004, he joined the Or-
egon National Guard at Kingsley Field. In 
2006, 
Colonel 
Edwards 
attended 
United 
States Air Force Weapons School. In 2019, 
after serving in several positions at Kingsley 
Field, he earned the Command of the 173rd 
Fighter Wing. Colonel Edwards has been 
awarded the 173rd Fighter Wing Instructor 
Pilot of the Year award, the USAF Weapons 
School F–15 Academic Award, the 19th Air 
Force Air-to-Air Fighter Pilot Instructor of the 
Year, the Meritorious Service Medal, Aerial 
Achievement Medal, and the Air Force Com-
mendation Medal. His service has included 
over 3,200 flight hours. Colonel Edwards em-
bodies the Air Force Core Values of Integrity 
First, Service Before Self, and Excellence In 
All We Do as a Commander, leader, and Air-
man. 
Kingsley Field is a critical asset for Amer-
ican national security. It serves as an out-
standing training center for the Air National 
Guard and active-duty pilots. In Colonel 
Edwards’ time as Commander, Kingsley Field 
was designated as first in line to function as 
a formal training unit for the Boeing F–15EX 
fighter jet. A critical part of domestic defense 
missions, the first operational F–15EX squad-
ron was designated to operate in the Oregon 
Air National Guard. Additionally, Colonel 
Edwards led Kingsley Field effectively through 
the COVID–19 pandemic. Plans were formal-
ized for Kingsley Field’s dedicated men and 
women to support their families while carefully 
maintaining the overall mission. In 2021, he 
seamlessly balanced the activation of over 
250 Airmen for COVID–19 and hospital sup-
port. In 2022, over 145 members were acti-
vated to help the State of Oregon’s deal with 
the Omicron variant. During this time, never 
once did Colonel Edwards’ leadership waver. 
He stands on the front line, supporting innova-
tion in aircraft, managing issues as they arise, 
and holding fast to a vision of a better future. 
Furthermore, Colonel Edwards extends his 
focus on the future beyond his service to the 
men and women of Kingsley Field as a mem-
ber of my Military Service Academy Nomina-
tion Board, which includes other exceptional 
active and retired officers. His experience as 
an Air Force Academy graduate, a pilot and a 
leader provides invaluable help as he, and the 
other military officers of my annual nomination 
board, interview students to assess their char-
acter, leadership, physical aptitude, motivation, 
academic preparation, extracurricular, and 
community service activities. 
For a man who has demonstrated such 
strong leadership, allegiance, and sacrifice 
during his service to our Nation, recognition is 
a very modest attempt to thank him. 
We indeed owe a serious debt of gratitude 
to Colonel Edwards, because, though tech-
nology, time, and power may change, the at-
tributes of a good leader remain unchanged. 
Colonel Edwards has dedicated his life to this 
nation, and we thank him for the service, vi-
sion, and leadership he has demonstrated 
both at home and abroad. 
Madam Speaker, as we reach the culmina-
tion of his distinguished career, I join my col-
leagues 
today 
in 
congratulating 
Colonel 
Edwards for his lifetime of service to our coun-
try. We wish him, his wife, Teresa, and their 
six children: Matthew 22, Anna 20, Andrew 17, 
Rachel 14, Sarah 12, and James 10 best 
wishes as he retires from the United States Air 
Force.

CONGRATULATING

Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate Rock Island High School boys’ 
head basketball coach Marc Polite for being 
named ‘‘Coach of the Year’’ for 2022 by the Il-
linois Basketball Coaches Association. 
When Marc began coaching at Rock Island 
High School, he decided he wanted to build a 
strong and solid team both on and off the 
court. The student-athletes that he coaches 
are able to set academic, athletic, personal, 
and professional goals, and play basketball 
while having fun. And just one year into his 
coaching career at Rock Island High School, 
coaches from across the State of Illinois voted 
Marc ‘‘Coach of the Year.’’ As a former ath-
lete, I appreciate Marc’s dedication to his 
team, and I commend him for receiving this 
honor from the Illinois Basketball Coaches As-
sociation. 
It is because of community leaders like 
Marc Polite that I am especially proud to serve

RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE AND 
RETIREMENT OF MARCIA GAR-
RETT OF TACOMA, WASHINGTON 
HON. DEREK KILMER 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 10, 2022 
Mr. KILMER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Marcia Garrett of Tacoma, Wash-
ington for her decades of service and to cele-
brate her upcoming retirement. 
Marcia is a lifelong Washingtonian with a 
dedication to public service. She began her 
career serving as a staff member in the Wash-
ington State legislature and served our country 
as a White House aide during President 
Carter’s Administration. After returning to the 
Pacific Northwest, Marcia joined the team at 
Washington State University, where she has 
worked for the past 26 years. 
As the Director of Regional Relations in the 
Office of External Affairs and Governmental 
Relations for Washington State University, 
Marcia has been a pillar in our community, 
tirelessly working to build bridges between 
higher education, the community, and local 
government. In addition to her work at the Uni-
versity, Marcia is involved in several boards, 
organizations, and working groups within the 
Puget Sound region. She is a vocal and tena-
cious advocate for higher education in the 
state of Washington and we are all better off 
thanks to her work advancing the research 
and work of public universities. 
Madam Speaker, beyond her many accom-
plishments, I would also like to express grati-
tude for the friend that Marcia has been to me. 
Not only do I appreciate the work she has 
done; I appreciate the person that she is. 
Please join me in congratulating Marcia Gar-
rett on her service to Washington State Uni-
versity and the state of Washington. I wish her 
all the best in her retirement.

RECOGNIZING THE FORT WALTON 
BEACH CHAMBER OF COMMERCE 
FOR 
THEIR 
INVALUABLE 
CON-
TRIBUTION TO COMMEMORATING 
THE DOOLITTLE RAIDERS 
HON. MATT GAETZ 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 10, 2022 
Mr. GAETZ. Madam Speaker, I rise to rec-
ognize the Fort Walton Beach Chamber of 
Commerce for the historical contribution they 
have made in commemorating the Doolittle 
Raiders. 
The mission of the Doolittle Raiders was to 
strike back at the Japanese military after their 
attack on Pearl Harbor. Lt. Colonel James 
Doolittle began training the Doolittle Raiders at 
Eglin Air Force Base just weeks before their 
historic raid. Before leaving Eglin, the Doolittle 
Raiders would become some of the greatest 
and most capable fighting pilots of all time. 
In April of 1942, the Doolittle Raiders began 
their historic flight. However, they were re-
ported by a Japanese vessel off the coast of 
California. They decided to launch their mis-
sion early in order to surprise the Japanese 
fleet that had been notified of their attack. Un-
fortunately, this early launch meant they would 
not have enough gas to make it to their des-
ignated landing place. As a result, many would 
have to either bail or perform a crash landing. 
Despite this, the historic Doolittle Raid was 
invaluable to American morale in the early 
stages of WWII, which inevitably changed its 
course. 
In the years following WWII, the Raiders 
held reunions commemorating the Doolittle 
Raid and all it stood for. Each reunion they 
would toast the Raiders who had passed since 
their last meeting. In 2013, the last reunion 
took place in Fort Walton Beach, and in 2019, 
the last Doolittle Raider, Bud Cole, passed 
away. 
This year, the Fort Walton Beach Chamber 
of Commerce sponsored a final commemora-
tive toast to Bud Cole and the Doolittle Raid-
ers at Northwest Florida State College. The 
distinguished honor bestowed upon these 
great servicemen by the Fort Walton Beach 
Chamber will never be forgotten. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the United 
States Congress, I am privileged to recognize 
Fort Walton Beach Chamber of Commerce 
and their commitment to preserving the mem-
ory of these national heroes. I thank them for 
their service and dedication to the legacies of 
these historic U.S. Servicemembers.

Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Rachel San-
chez for her creative and unique drawing, 
earning her third place in the 2022 Congres-
sional Art Competition. 
As a participant in the art show and student 
at Golden High School, Rachel created a work 
of art entitled, ‘‘Father Figure’’. The artwork is 
a charcoal portrait of her father. 
Rachel spent countless hours and used nu-
merous tools to learn new techniques and re-
fine her painting skills and education in the 
arts. I appreciate her participation in the com-
petition and the support provided by her 
teachers at Golden High School. 
Congratulations to Rachel Sanchez for her 
hard work and participation in the 2022 Con-
gressional Art Competition. I am certain she 
will exhibit the same dedication and character 
in her future accomplishments, and I wish her 
the best of luck going forward.

ASHEBORO POLICE DEPARTMENT 
HON. TED BUDD 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 10, 2022 
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the exceptional public service pro-
vided by Officers of the Asheboro, North Caro-
lina Police Department. 
On March 2, 2022, one of my constituents 
was scheduled for an important medical pro-
cedure. As his wife was driving him to his ap-
pointment, she suddenly began experiencing 
serious medical symptoms. This forced the 
couple to make an emergency stop at a local 
convenience store. Dismayed, my constituent 
believed he would miss the appointment for 
his critical operation. 
Upon observing the distress of a total 
stranger, a good Samaritan called 9–1–1. Offi-
cers Olivia Hicks and Courtney Crisco were 
nearby, and they were quickly dispatched to 
the convenience store. Although Officer Crisco 
was in training that day, both she and Officer 
Hicks sprang into action. As the EMTs cared 
for the gentleman’s wife, the officers person-
ally drove my constituent to his appointment. 
Not content to merely ensure he had transpor-
tation for his trip home, the officers also ar-
ranged for the man to have a caretaker until 
the effects of the anesthesia had subsided. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in thanking 
Officers Olivia Hicks and Courtney Crisco, 
along with the entire Asheboro Police Depart-
ment, for admirably responding to the call to 
protect and serve their community. Through 
their actions, these officers demonstrated their 
genuine concern for those they serve. At a 
time when some have called for the defunding 
of 
police 
departments, 
residents 
across 
Asheboro should be proud of such exemplars 
of policing and public service.

HONORING DR. MARK JUSTIN 
APFEL 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 10, 2022 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of Dr. Mark Justin Apfel 
as he retires from Anderson Valley Health 
Center and an extraordinary 45–year career in 
health care in rural Mendocino County. 
Born in New York in April 1949, Dr. Apfel 
earned an undergraduate degree at Syracuse 
University and graduated from medical school 
at SUNY Upstate Medical University Norton 
College of Medicine. He went on to become 
an emergency room physician with Kaiser, 
serving Oakland, Vallejo, and Redwood City, 
California, and then a physician for East Oak-
land Family Health Center. In 1976, he was 
selected to be an emergency room physician 
for Hillside Hospital in Ukiah, California. That 
same year, Dr. Apfel began serving as a vol-
unteer physician with a newly formed health 
clinic in Boonville, California, soon to become 
the Anderson Valley Health Center. Dr. Apfel 
stepped into the role of the first full time doctor 
at Anderson Valley Health Center (AVHC) in 
rural Mendocino County, where he worked for 
the next 45 years. 
While working at AVHC, Dr. Apfel took on 
additional roles as an emergency room physi-
cian and medical director of palliative care for 
Ukiah Valley Medical Center in Ukiah, Cali-
fornia; and he served as a staff physician at 
the Mendocino Community Hospital in Fort 
Bragg, California. This work required Dr. Apfel 
to commute frequently throughout Mendocino 
County, travelling year-round over the windy 
country roads that connect these communities. 
In addition to Dr. Apfel’s professional serv-
ice to Mendocino County, he was an active

and he provided medical service training for 
members of the Anderson Valley Volunteer 
Fire Department and Anderson Valley Ambu-
lance Services. Dr. Apfel also continued to 
pursue professional development, broadening 
his expertise in palliative care. 
Dr. Apfel shared his skills and knowledge 
with the medical community in the extended 
region and state through his leadership in the 
Coalition for Compassionate Care of Cali-
fornia, and by helping establish the Physician 
Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST) 
Program. Furthermore, his efforts to ensure 
appropriate palliative medical care and end-of- 
life care resulted in improved access to critical 
information for patients and their loved ones. 
Madam Speaker, the breadth and depth of 
Dr. Apfel’s dedication and generosity of serv-
ice to ensure access to affordable, high-qual-
ity, 
and 
compassionate 
health 
care 
in 
Mendocino County, the state, and Nation are 
unparalleled. He is appropriately regarded as 
a local healthcare hero, but his service and 
contributions extend far beyond his commu-
nity. Please join me in recognizing Dr. Mark 
Apfel for his near half-century of good work 
and wishing him the best in his next endeav-
ors.

RECOGNIZING JUDGE HUGH REED 
OF CLAUDE, TEXAS 
HON. RONNY JACKSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 10, 2022 
Mr. JACKSON. Madam Speaker, today I am 
proud to recognize Judge Hugh Reed of 
Claude, Texas as he gathers with friends, 
family, longtime colleagues, and members of 
the community to celebrate his retirement and 
70th birthday. After nearly 34 years of distin-
guished service to the fine people of Arm-
strong County as County Judge, I know I 
speak for the whole county when I say we are 
grateful for his service and wish him well in re-
tirement. 
When asked about the best part of the job 
in a 2015 interview, Judge Reed expressed 
gratitude to his constituents for giving him the 
honor to serve them. Representing the people 
of Armstrong County is a clear passion for 
Judge Reed, and I am confident that he will 
be missed in his retirement as he served Arm-
strong County with diligence and honor. 
In addition to his service as County Judge, 
Judge Reed also served our country in the 
U.S Marine Corps for 21 years. He is some-
one who truly knows what it means to make 
sacrifices for the betterment of his community 
and country. 
Judge Reed is an incredible leader with an 
unwavering commitment to West Texas. His 
legacy will be remembered in Armstrong 
County for generations to come. I stand here 
today to thank Judge Reed for his contribution 
and service to the people of Armstrong Coun-
ty, and to wish him a happy 70th birthday.

As a participant in the art show and student

a work of art entitled, ‘‘#NoFilter’’. It was cre-
ated with colored pencils and is meant to con-
vey a social-media-centric culture and its im-

Zayne spent countless hours and used nu-

HONORING DAVID BLANCO 
RAMIREZ 
HON. DARRELL ISSA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 10, 2022 
Mr. ISSA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Border Patrol Agent David 
Blanco Ramirez. 
Mr. Ramirez served in the U.S. Border Pa-
trol for 18 years. While serving in the San 
Diego Sector’s Intelligence Unit during the mi-
grant surge in September 2021, Agent Rami-
rez passed away in the line of duty. 
Mr. Ramirez was born and raised in Chula 
Vista, California. In 1993, he enlisted in the 
National Guard, beginning his long career of 
protecting our country. 
In 2003, Mr. Ramirez joined the Border Pa-
trol’s San Diego sector, located near his 
hometown. After 18 years of service for the 
CBP’s forensic office, Agent Ramirez suc-
cumbed in 2021 to COVID–19 complications. 
He contracted the disease working in the 2021 
surge in illegal aliens during our country’s un-
precedented border crisis. 
He is survived by his loving wife Rosemary, 
who has served the San Diego community as 
a teacher’s assistant to children with special 
needs, as well as his three sons, his eldest 
following in his father’s footsteps and rising to 
the rank of lst Lieutenant in the U.S. National 
Guard. 
We owe a debt beyond words to David 
Blanco Ramirez and his family. I am proud to 
rise today to honor his service to our nation. 
HONORING 
NON-PROFITS 
AND 
NGO’S FOR PROVIDING CRITICAL 
INTERNATIONAL AID TO FIGHT 
THE 
COVID–19 
PANDEMIC 
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD 
HON. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 10, 2022 
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Madam Speaker, 
as a proud co-founder of the Global Vaccine 
Caucus and member of the Special Select 
Committee on the Coronavirus Crisis, I wish to 
honor and celebrate the efforts of NGOs who 
have provided robust international aid and 
other forms of critical humanitarian assistance 
to combat the COVID–19 pandemic around 
the world. 
In our nation, rapid advances in vaccine 
technology and COVID–19 treatment have 
turned the virus into a more manageable 
threat. But in countries throughout the world 
without equitable access to the benefits of 
these advancements, the economic, social, 
and public health ramifications of COVID–19 
have remained troublingly prevalent; to date, 
over 6 million deaths resulting from COVID–19 
have been reported to the World Health Orga-
nization 
across 
the 
world. 
Furthermore, 
COVID–19 anywhere is a threat to people ev-
erywhere, and efforts to curb the spread of 
deadly variants abroad helps saves American 
lives here at home. 
In response to the spread of COVID–19, 
volunteer-based 
organizations 
and 
NGOs 
have stepped up in a meaningful way to ad-
dress this crisis, bringing critical support to un-
derserved communities facing untold suffering 
as a result of the pandemic. For example, ac-
cording to PR Newswire, the organizations 
Sewa International, eGlobal Doctors, and 
American Association of Physicians of Indian 
Origin (AAPI) partnered to provide ‘‘Medical 
advice for COVID–19 patients from India via 
telehealth,’’ with the objective to ‘‘keep pa-
tients with mild symptoms out of the ER and 
identify those who need to go to the hospital 
sooner,’’ and to ‘‘decrease the burden on hos-
pitals to lower panic and decrease misinforma-
tion about the pandemic.’’ Further, these orga-
nizations assisted countries like India, Ban-
gladesh, Nepal, Pakistan, Guyana, Iraq, South 
Africa, Suriname, and Trinidad by sending ox-
ygen concentrators and other necessary 
COVID supplies. These much-needed humani-
tarian efforts served people of all races, col-
ors, religions, genders, sexual orientations, 
and nationalities. 
Other organizations have invested in de-
ploying people on the ground in foreign coun-
tries to strengthen education and outreach ini-
tiatives. As outlined in Borgen Magazine, fol-
lowing the initial outbreak of COVID–19 in 
2020, the non-profit organization Doctors With-
out Borders ‘‘supported hospitals at the epi-
center of the COVID–19 outbreak’’ in Italy, 
and ‘‘sent teams to educate populations [in 
Hong Kong] about the importance of pre-
venting the spread of COVID–19.’’ 
These are just some examples of the tre-
mendous work undertaken by non-profits and 
NGOs across the United States to expand ac-
cess to healthcare and fight COVID–19 across 
the world. In totality, such organizations have 
raised millions of dollars for COVID–19 relief 
efforts, distributed hundreds of thousands of

Madam Speaker, while our battle with this 
virus is not yet finished, I want to recognize 
the exemplary efforts of these organizations 
for their heroic efforts. Their work to provide

HONORING ELOISE CAMPBELL 
BARFIELD-FIGGS 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 10, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable 
hero, Mrs. Eloise Campbell Barfield-Figgs. 
Eloise was born on December 10, 1944, in 
Marks, MS, to Louise ‘‘Mama Lou’’ Hankins 
and Charlie Campbell. She grew up in a home 
with seven siblings—two sisters and five 
brothers in Marks, MS. 
Eloise is a 1963 graduate of Quitman Coun-
ty High School; and she later attended 
Coahoma Community College where she ma-
jored in Early Childhood Education. She uti-
lized her educational background and started 
her career in the early childhood field by serv-
ing as Center Director for Head Start in Lam-
bert, MS. She also served as Parent Center 
Coordinator for the Quitman County School 
District. She established a name for herself by 
working in the public sector as a Justice Court 
Clerk, a Clerk in the Chancery Clerk’s Office; 
Customer Service Representative at Shreve-
port Credit Union (now Red River), and Delta 
Burial Funeral Association. She is currently re-
tired but felt the need to return to work to 
share her skills and talents by cooking and 
serving three ‘‘Hot & Nutritious’’ meals to the 
County Inmates. 
Eloise later married James R. Figgs (former 
Civil Rights Activist) and they had three chil-
dren: Wynetta, Anja, and Dwight; four grand-
children and one great grandson. 
Eloise a strong pillar in her community and 
is the matriarch of her family. She continues to 
care for her children, her grandchildren, her 
great grandson and two of her disabled broth-
ers. She is devoted to ensuring that her broth-
ers are well taken care of and provides them 
with meals daily. 
Over the course of her life, she has contrib-
uted to her community tremendously. She as-
sists with distributing food boxes to needy 
families, disabled adults and the elderly 
throughout the community. As a pillar of her 
community, she has continued to help others 
through her many organizational affiliations, 
(Current & Past) such as the Heroine of Jeri-
cho; The National Council of Negro Women, 
Inc.; the NAACP (Local, State & National), 
where she has received numerous awards in 
her work related to Civil Rights; and the Les 
Grandes Souers, where her organization pro-
vides charitable services that are beneficial to 
the community and particularly for the chil-
dren. Her organization in the past was very in-
strumental in hosting pageants for the girls 
and boys of Quitman County, teaching them 
etiquette, helping to build self-confidence, in-
crease community involvement, and build last-
ing friendships. 
Eloise has been instrumental in helping to 
organize the Annual Christmas Parades for 
the City of Marks, providing Annual Scholar-
ships for High School Seniors and she renders 
herself to any other charitable event in which 
the Organization is asked to assist. 
Eloise is a faithful, longtime member of Si-
lent Grove Missionary Baptist Church where 
she serves as Assistant Secretary/Treasurer. 
Her favorite scripture is Psalms 23, because 
she says, ‘‘the Lord is her Shepherd and I 
shall not want.’’ She is very active and sup-
portive in her community, church and the 
school district in which she has resided all of 
her life. Eloise is never hesitant to help any-
one in any way that she possibly can. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Mrs. Eloise Campbell 
Barfield-Figgs for she is the epitome of an un-
sung hero.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
HON. AMI BERA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 10, 2022 
Mr. BERA. Madam Speaker, I missed the 
following votes because I was traveling as part 
of the official Presidential Delegation to the In-
auguration of the President of the Republic of 
Korea. 
Had I been present, I would have voted 
NAY on Roll Call No. 142, YEA on Roll Call 
No. 143, and YEA on Roll Call No. 144. 
In addition, had I been present, I would 
have voted YEA on Roll Call No. 145 (Pas-
sage of H.R. 7691). As the world’s leading de-
mocracy, the United States has the solemn 
duty to demonstrate strong humanitarian prin-
ciples, democratic values, and good govern-
ance. I strongly support the nearly $40 billion
