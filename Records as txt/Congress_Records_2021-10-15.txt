SPEECH OF 
HON. CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 12, 2021 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, 
against the backdrop of President Biden’s de-
mand that Congress immediately pass an un-
precedented $3.5 trillion tax and spend budget 
package that constitutes the largest tax hike 
since 1968 and massive new unsustainable 
debt, the House votes today to extend the 
debt ceiling until December 3rd. 
I will vote no. 
One analysis shows that Biden’s budget— 
championed by Senator BERNIE SANDERS— 
could cost up to $5.5 trillion after accounting 
for several budget gimmicks that artificially 
lower the price tag. 
Despite the fact that approximately $1.3 tril-
lion of previously appropriated COVID funds 
remain either unobligated (about $800 billion) 
or obligated but unspent (about $500 billion)— 
sitting idle in the government coffers—the 
Biden administration is demanding more 
power to borrow. 
There has also been a serious lack of trans-
parency as to how COVID funds are spent. 
In a July report, the Government Account-
ability Office (GAO)—the federal government’s 
‘‘watchdog 
agency’’—recommended 
‘‘that 
Health and Human Services (HHS) improve 
transparency over tens of billions of dollars in 
unspent relief funds.’’ 
The GAO also recommended that ‘‘the Of-
fice of Management and Budget and Depart-
ment of Treasury issue timely guidance for au-
dits of hundreds of billions in state and local 
COVID relief funds.’’ 
Nothing but political will—and a genuine 
commitment to responsible governance and 
spending within our means—precludes re-
directing some or all of the $1.3 trillion unobli-
gated and unspent COVID funds to mitigate 
the debt, instead of new borrowing. 
There was a time when then-Senator Biden 
was concerned with the detrimental impact of 
debt on the economy and on those—our chil-
dren and grandchildren—who will someday 
pay a huge price for today’s profligate govern-
ment spending and the borrowing needed to 
sustain it. 
In a Senate speech in 2004, then-Senator 
Biden opposed raising the debt ceiling and 
condemned the ‘‘threat of massive deficits’’ 
and said, ‘‘the bill for our decisions will be sent 
to our children and grandchildren, in the form 
of the additional debt we authorize today.’’ 
In 2006, Biden said: ‘‘ . . . I am voting 
against the debt limit increase . . . the tsu-
nami of debt created by the policies of this ad-
ministration (George W. Bush) has to go 
somewhere . . . But as the rest of the world 
copes with the waves of U.S. debt, we are 
now all in the same leaky boat. There is just 
so much of our debt other nations want to 
hold . . . We need both more awareness, and 
more understanding, of this fundamental threat 
to our economic well being and the global 
economy.’’ 
Today, with our national debt far worse than 
ever—it was $8.5 trillion in 2006, today it’s 
$28.4 trillion—the President ought to heed his 
own words.

HONORING MS. SARAH YOUNG 
GLACKIN 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 15, 2021 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize and thank Sarah Young Glackin on 
her long and distinguished career as a mem-
ber of staff on the House Appropriations Com-
mittee as she prepares to leave us for new 
endeavors. 
Myself and my fellow colleagues—on both 
sides of the aisle—have relied extensively on 
Sarah’s expertise in many appropriations mat-
ters, most notably in the areas of defense and 
military construction. 
Sarah’s career began on the Subcommittee 
on Defense, with a portfolio that included 
Tricare and Defense Health Programs. 
Four years later, she moved to the Sub-
committee on Military Quality of Life and then 
Subcommittee on Interior and Environment. 
She soon returned to Defense, where she 
worked on Counterdrug and Narcotics, Missile 
Defense, Defense Health Programs, Military 
Medical Research, and TRICARE. For the last 
decade, Sarah has served on the Sub-
committee on Military Construction, Veterans 
Affairs, and Related Agencies. 
She was responsible for military construc-
tion across all components and services, the 
improvement 
of 
housing 
for 
our 
servicemembers and their Families, and the 
NATO security investment program. Often-
times congressional staffers are not appro-
priately recognized for their service. However, 
they are the Americans from all over our na-
tion that represent the fabric of our country. 
Sarah has served in more ways than one. 
Madam Speaker, Sarah has been an institu-
tion on the Appropriations Committee since 
the moment I arrived there. My Colleagues 
and myself will miss her dedication, her pa-
tience, and her deep reservoir of knowledge. 
I want to wish Sarah all the best as she pur-
sues new adventures.

IN 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
SOUTHERN 
WAYNE 
COUNTY 
REGIONAL 
CHAMBER 
UNSUNG 
HEROINE 
AWARD 
RECIPIENT 
JESSICA 
WORKMAN 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 15, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Jessica Workman, Vice 
President of Member Experience at Advantage 
One Credit Union as she is awarded the Un-
sung Heroine Award at the Southern Wayne 
County 
Regional 
Chamber’s 
5th 
annual 
Women of Achievement Awards. Her signifi-
cant contributions to our downriver community 
are worthy of commendation. 
Ms. Workman began her career at Advan-
tage One Credit Union over 12 years ago as 
a teller and has worked her way up to her cur-
rent role as Vice President of Member Experi-
ence. A native of Romulus, Michigan, she 
studied Political Science at University of Michi-
gan—Dearborn. As a leader in her office, Ms. 
Workman is always looking for ways to im-
prove the credit union for employees and 
members alike, and she meets each new chal-
lenge with enthusiasm. Even during a core 
conversion in the midst of a pandemic, Ms. 
Workman remained dedicated to making a 
positive change in her workplace—even when 
things got tough. 
Her colleagues know her as someone who 
always has an upbeat attitude and looks on 
the bright side. A true team player, she chal-
lenges everyone to find new ways to help oth-
ers and to go above and beyond in serving 
their members. She takes on every task with 
grace and optimism, and for that her entire 
team is thankful. Ms. Workman lives in 
Maybee, Michigan with her family. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Jessica Workman and in 
congratulating her for being the recipient of 
the Unsung Heroine Award. We are grateful 
for her service to our community in Wayne

for her tireless work in making our community 
a better place for everyone. Her hard work 
has not gone unnoticed.

‘‘Jon G’’ and Kelly Kirkman, the proprietors of 
Jon G’s Barbecue in Peachland, North Caro-
lina. After only a year in business, Jon G’s has 
already become a local institution, as evi-
denced by the consistently long line of cus-
tomers who are readv to enjoy good bar-
becue. For the Kirkmans, barbecue is truly a 
labor of love and the establishment of their 
restaurant took many years of hard work and 
experimentation. 
Small business owners have been ravaged 
by the government response to the pandemic, 
and it is tremendously important during this 
time to highlight entrepreneurship and to sup-
port small businesses in our local commu-
nities. Jon G and Kelly, I hope your hard work 
will continue to pay off and that your barbecue 
restaurant will be a Peachland institution for 
years to come.

Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I ask my col-
leagues to join me in honoring my distin-
guished constituent, a recipient of the 2021 
Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, 
Stanford 
University 
Professor 
Guido 
W.

will. Dr. Imbens is being honored with his col-
league Joshua D. Angrist of the Massachu-
setts Institute of Technology for methodo-
logical contributions to the analysis of causal 
relationships. 
Guido Imbens is the Applied Econometrics 
Professor and Professor of Economics at the 
Stanford Graduate School of Business (GSB). 
He is a senior fellow at the Stanford Institute

versity, where he earned his Ph.D., he taught 
at Harvard, UCLA and UC Berkeley before 
joining the GSB in 2012. His research focuses 
on developing methods for drawing causal re-
lationships in observational studies, using 
matching, instrumental variables and regres-
sion continuity designs. 
Madam Speaker, I ask the entire House of 
Representatives to join me in congratulating 
Dr. Guido W. Imbens on receiving this most 
prestigious award, recognizing his contribu-
tions to the field of economics. It’s my privi-
lege to represent him, pay tribute to his bril-
liance, and thank him for making every Amer-

RECOGNIZING THE 20TH ANNIVER-
SARY 
OF 
HOPE 
ANIMAL 
AS-
SISTED CRISIS RESPONSE 
HON. JACK BERGMAN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 15, 2021 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor to recognize the 20th Anniversary of the 
HOPE Animal Assisted Crisis Response. 
Through their dedicated service and steadfast 
devotion to their communities, HOPE AACR 
has become an indispensable part of Michi-
gan’s First District and the United States. 
Since 2001, HOPE AACR has tirelessly 
worked to provide mental and emotional sup-
port to Americans during individual or national 
crises. Their organization has brought needed 
assistance to many local community groups 
including first responders, schools, hospitals, 
and churches. In addition, they often work di-
rectly with mental health professionals and 
counselors to bring the maximum level of care 
for those experiencing personal hardship. 
HOPE AACR has also brought vital support 
to our nation during numerous tragic events 
such as 9/11, Hurricane Katrina, and the 
wildfires in California. Their help has improved 
the lives of countless Americans and their 
families and their dedication to the well-being 
of our communities cannot be overstated. 
Madam Speaker, it is my honor to recognize 
HOPE Animal Assisted Crisis Response for 
decades of success and service to Michigan 
and the United States. Michiganders can take 
great pride in knowing the First District is 
home to such dedicated citizens. On behalf of 
my constituents, I wish them all the best in 
their future endeavors.

HONORING CBP’S FALLEN 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 15, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, the mission of U.S. Customs and 
Border Protection (CBP) is broad and diverse. 
The more than 60,000 men and women of 
CBP protect our borders at and between the 
ports of entry and help boost our economic 
security and prosperity by facilitating trade and 
travel. While the roles they play may differ, 
CBP personnel are tasked with keeping our 
country a safe, secure, and resilient place 
where the American way of life can thrive. 
In carrying out this critical role, CBP per-
sonnel provide a great service to our country. 
They put their uniforms on every day and kiss 
their families goodbye, not sure what the next 
shift may bring. Tragically, some have not re-
turned home. 
I wish to pay tribute to the brave officers 
and agents who made the ultimate sacrifice in 
service to our Nation. We commemorate them, 
celebrate their lives, and offer their families 
and loved ones our continued support. They 
have earned the respect and appreciation of a 
grateful nation, and their service and sacrifice 
will never be forgotten. 
Today, on the occasion of CBP’s 2021 Valor 
Memorial and Wreath Laying Ceremony, I in-
clude in the RECORD the names of these offi-
cers and agents as follows:

ENTREPRENEUR 
AWARD RECIPIENT AYANA KING 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 15, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Ayana King, CEO at Max-
imum Communications as she is awarded the 
Entrepreneur Award at the Southern Wayne 
County 
Regional 
Chamber’s 
5th 
annual 
Women of Achievement Awards. Her signifi-
cant contributions to our community are wor-
thy of commendation. 
Ms. King founded Maximum Communica-
tions, LLC in 2018 after working as Corporate 
Communications Manager at American House 
Senior Living Communities in Bloomfield Hills, 
Michigan where she worked for over 4 years. 
A graduate of University of Michigan—Dear-
born, Ms. King is a consultant and a leader in 
diversity, equity, and inclusion. She began her 
journey assisting business in social media 
management, but found her calling in giving 
diversity, equity, and inclusion workshops. To 
her, inclusion is more than a word to be 
thrown around, she is unafraid to have tough 
conversations about difficult topics. She helps 
everyone do better and look inwards to recog-
nize their own unconscious bias.

Her expertise in communications and diver-
sity, equity, and inclusion is sought after in our

economy. In starting her own business, she 
discovered her enthusiasm for helping others 
by providing an inclusive education to busi-

HONORING DR. GARY AND 
KAROLYN CHAPMAN 
HON. TED BUDD 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 15, 2021 
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
honor of Dr. Gary and Karolyn Chapman as 
they celebrate 50 years of ministry at Calvary 
Baptist Church in Winston-Salem, NC. 
When Gary and Karolyn Chapman began 
their ministry at Calvary in 1971 at the invita-
tion of Dr. Mark Corts, they didn’t land imme-
diately within the business of strengthening 
marriages. It was only after the Chapmans 
had been faithfully leading the college and sin-
gle adult ministries of the church that God 
opened a door for them to reach those en-
countering relational difficulties, primarily fo-
cusing on married couples and families. 
Karolyn has long been involved in encour-
aging other pastors’ wives, a hugely important 
work to minister to the behind-the-scenes sup-
porters that she’s uniquely suited to care for. 
In addition to this, Calvary and all its members 
have been blessed through Karolyn’s beautiful 
voice and her devotion to the church’s choir 
ministry. 
Millions of relationships have experienced 
healing and restoration through Gary’s work 
as a pastor, marriage counselor, and author of 
over fifty books including his best-selling The 
Five Love Languages, which has sold over 20 
million copies and been translated into more 
than 50 different languages. While Gary for-
mally retired from his position as Senior Asso-
ciate Pastor of Calvary Baptist Church at the 
end of July, he continues to write and teach, 
and neither he nor Karolyn have any plans of 
retiring from ministry altogether. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in con-
gratulating Gary and Karolyn on a half-century 
of faithful service invested in sharing Christ’s 
love with the world. Their example has been 
an inspiration to me, my family, and to so 
many. May we all continue to grow closer to 
Christ as we follow their example.

HONORING MR. ARTHUR M. 
NEWELL 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 15, 2021 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Mr. Arthur M. Newell, of Struthers, Ohio, 
on the awarding to him of the French Legion 
d’honneur. 
The government of the French Republic, 
since the end of the Second World War, hon-
ors those liberators, who restored those lib-
erties with determination, sacrifice, duty, and 
honor, with the presentation of the Ordre na-
tional de la Le´gion d’honneur. 
Conceived over two centuries ago by 
Napole´on Bonaparte, First Consul of the First 
Republic of France, his Order was devised to 
reward eminent military and civil merits in the 
service of France. The award is still the high-
est distinction that can be bestowed upon a 
citizen of France or a foreigner who has done 
great deeds for France. 
Of his service, then Private First Class New-
ell recalls, ‘‘After arriving in Metz, France, our 
regiment joined others from Patton’s 3rd Army 
in an attempt to breach the Siegfried Line. 
Just to the east of Metz, we approached our 
first enemy pillbox. It appeared to be out of 
action until we were within about 100 feet from 
it. At that moment the Germans opened fire. A 
few of our men got hit and a few more 
stepped on mines or set off booby traps. We 
took cover. Our heavy weapons platoon came 
up to the front and with their machine guns 
and bazookas they took direct aim at the 
bunkers slotted openings and opened fire. As 
the battle progressed my buddies and I got 
close enough to lob grenades towards the for-
tification. The enemy within the pillbox fell si-
lent.’’ 
There is no doubt that Mr. Newell is a true 
American hero, emblematic of the service that 
characterizes the Veterans of Ohio’s 13th 
Congressional District, the state of Ohio, and 
the United States of America. 
I want to personally congratulate Arthur on 
this milestone and offer my sincerest gratitude 
for his unwavering dedication to our country. It 
is members of his generation upon which our 
nation is built.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 15, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Mia Harnos, Chief Strategy 
and Innovation Officer at Wayne Metropolitan 
Community Action Agency as she is awarded 
the Kyle F. Stack Leadership Award at the 
Southern Wayne County Regional Chamber’s 
5th annual Women of Achievement Awards. 
Her significant contributions to our community 
are worthy of commendation. 
Raised in Allen Park, Mrs. Harnos has 
called southeast Michigan home for her whole 
life. Committed to the betterment of her com-
munity, she joined Wayne Metro in 2013 and 
has risen through the ranks to become Chief 
Strategy and Innovation Officer. She is the vi-
sionary behind numerous successful events, 
programs, and fundraisers that benefit the 
residents of Wayne County. In her current 
role, she is working on redesigning Wayne 
Metro’s programs and services using a racial 
equity and inclusion lens. Described by co-
workers as a natural leader who always puts 
people first, she’s inspired her team to find 
new and improved ways to help residents in 
challenging times. 
A tireless advocate for the people of her 
community, Mrs. Harnos led efforts to pass 
the Pay As You Stay legislation and helps 
raise money for Wayne Metro’s Save the Day 
fund, two programs that provide financial relief 
to those facing tough times. Known for her 
ambitious spirit and positive attitude, she 
never stops striving to make a difference in 
her community. Mrs. Harnos lives in Wyan-
dotte with her husband Brian and their three 
sons. Along with participating in Wayne Met-
ro’s many community events, Mrs. Harnos and 
her husband are supporters of the Wyandotte 
Rotary Club. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Mia Harnos and in con-
gratulating her for being the recipient of the 
Kyle F. Stack Leadership Award. We are 
grateful for her service to our community in 
Wayne County and beyond. We join with Mia’s

today, Friday, October 15, through Sunday, 
October 17, 2021. 
The National Law Enforcement Officers Me-
morial is the nation’s monument to law en-
forcement officers who have died in the line of 
duty. 
Dedicated on October 15, 1991, the Memo-
rial honors federal, state and local law en-
forcement officers who have made the ulti-
mate sacrifice for the safety and protection of 
our nation and its people. 
Carved on its walls are the names of 22,611 
officers who have been killed in the line of 
duty throughout U.S. history, dating back to 
the first known death in 1791. 
Added to the Wall this year will be the 
names of the 295 police officers who lost their 
lives in the line of duty in 2020 and an addi-
tional 99 officers who died in previous years 
but whose stories of sacrifice had been lost to 
history until now. 
Also to be added are the names of 182 offi-
cers who were lost to the COVID–19 pan-
demic in 2020. 
Madam Speaker, enshrined on the Memorial 
Wall of Honor also are the names of 1,831 
fallen peace officers from the state of Texas, 
the most of any state, including 115 members 
of the Houston Police Department who gave 
their lives to keep their city safe. 
To this Roll of Honor will be added the fol-
lowing heroes from Texas:

Madam Speaker, today there are more than 
800,000 law enforcement personnel serving 
the people of our country, the highest amount 
ever. 
About 12 percent of them are female. 
These brave men and women risk their lives 
to keep the peace and keep us safe, but they 
are too often taken by the violence they are 
working to prevent. 
Every year, a law enforcement officer is 
killed somewhere in the United States every 
55 hours, and there are also 58,170 assaults 
against our law officers each year, resulting in 
17,560 injuries. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to represent 
the people of the 18th Congressional District 
of Texas in paying tribute to the 394 fallen he-
roes who will be joining the 22,611 gallant 
men and women who gave the last full meas-
ure of devotion to the communities they took 
an oath to protect and serve. 
Madam Speaker, I ask for a moment of si-
lence in memory of the 295 officers who died 
in the line of duty in 2020 and the additional 
99 officers who died in previous years but 
whose story had been lost to history, the 
names of all of whom will be added to the Na-
tional Peace Officers Memorial Wall of Honor.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE ALEXIS 
COMPANY 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 15, 2021 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, today I rise to 
recognize an African American-owned small 
business, the Alexis Company, based in De-
troit in Michigan’s 13th Congressional District, 
as they celebrate their thirty-fifth anniversary. 
The Alexis Company is the culmination of 
the hard work of its founder Regina Dubose. 
Born and raised in Detroit, Ms. Dubose 
dreamed of one day running her own business 
when she was a child. She credits her finan-
cial and business acumen to the mentorship 
she received in one of her earliest jobs work-
ing at a local accounting firm. Ms. Dubose 
was drawn to a career in psychology and 
counseling after earning her Bachelor’s and 
Master’s degrees from Wayne State Univer-
sity, but she found herself drawn to entrepre-
neurship when she began working as a ven-
dor at concerts and events in the mid-1980s. 
By 1986, Ms. Dubose was able to open the 
Alexis Company. Over the years, she has 
grown the business with expanded product 
lines and by engaging with local events and 
organizations. The early initial successes so-
lidified the Alexis Company’s reputation as a 
reliable partner in community events. Ms. 
Dubose was able to leverage this work into a 
distributorship for the company, which in-
creased their access to promotional products 
and broadened their competitive edge in new 
markets at the local, state, national, and inter-
national levels. 
Under Ms. Dubose’s leadership, the Alexis 
Company has adapted to the changing de-
mands of the business. Most recently, she has 
shifted her focus to sharing her knowledge by 
writing and publishing a book about her expe-
riences. Ms. Dubose and the Alexis Company 
reflect the grit and adaptability needed to suc-
ceed as an entrepreneur. Small businesses 
are the backbone of local economies, and it is 
especially meaningful when minority-owned 
businesses succeed and thrive. 
Please join me in recognizing Regina 
Dubose and the Alexis Company as they cele-
brate thirty-five years in business as we wish 
them well in the years to come.

HONORING ISABEL MARTINEZ 
SANTOS AS IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 15, 2021 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Isabel Martinez Santos as Iowan of the 
Week. Isabel immigrated to the United States 
and has lived in Iowa for 28 years. Isabel has 
become a staple of advocacy within her com-
munity. Isabel has committed herself to ad-
dressing the conflict that exists in our world 
through her position with the Iowa Coalition 
Against Domestic Violence and with Nuestras 
Danzas sin Fronteras, a community-focused 
dance group she founded. 
Isabel started her very accomplished career 
as a member of a community group that 
worked directly with women who faced vio-
lence in different aspects of their lives. 
Through this, and the values that were instilled 
in her from her parents, Isabel began to am-
plify the voices of those in need. This year, 
Isabel was promoted as the co-director of 
Iowa Coalition Against Domestic Violence’s 
Legal Clinic as the Bi-Lingual DOJ Accredited 
Representative. She provides legal services, 
consultations, resources, and support to sur-
vivors of partner violence. She also offers 
technical assistance, mentorship to Spanish- 
speaking bi-cultural advocates, and training. 
Her commitment to advocacy on behalf of sur-
vivors is evident in her extensive track record 
of 22 years in the victim services field. 
In addition to her role with the Iowa Coali-
tion Against Domestic Violence, Isabel found 
another way to give back to her community. 
Isabel founded Nuestras Danzas sin Fronteras 
almost six years ago hoping to create a place 
for self-care for other advocates. Since its 
opening, Isabel has welcomed a broader 
spectrum of members of her community to 
highlight individual cultures, have fun, and 
overcome the barriers of trauma. Through her 
group, Isabel strives to provide change that 
will last for generations. 
Not only has Isabel been an incredible ad-
vocate for the women of Iowa, but Isabel is 
also the 2021 recipient of the Diane Reese 
Excellence in Advocacy in the Movement 
(DREAM) Award from the National Network to 
end Domestic Violence. This national award is 
granted to individuals who incorporate and 
demonstrate the spirit and promise of true ad-
vocacy in all aspects of their life—one who 
emulates Ms. Reese’s commitment to clear 
and ethical communication, her eagerness to 
collaborate in the spirit of true partnership, and 
her deep respect for the dignity, worth and hu-
manity in each one of us. 
Isabel hopes to be a role model and leave 
a legacy for her three children, her community, 
and immigrant women around the world by 
continuing to actively work to end the violence 
that exists in our world. It is my pleasure to 
name Isabel Martinez Santos Iowan of the 
Week.

Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Deidre Crockett, volunteer 
at Beaumont Health as she is awarded the 
Distinguished Young Woman Award at the 
Southern Wayne County Regional Chamber’s 
5th annual Women of Achievement Awards. 
Her significant contributions to our community

Ms. Crockett attended high school in Taylor, 
Michigan. She is currently studying Biomedical 
Physics at Wayne State University in Detroit, 
Michigan as Wayne Med-Direct scholar. The 
competitive Wayne Med-Direct program aims 
to educate students about urban health dis-
parities and help future physicians lead the 
way in improving the health and wellness of 
urban and underserved communities. In the 
future, Ms. Crockett wants to become a ge-
neticist specializing in treating sickle cell dis-
ease and offer low-cost treatments to families

in need. As a volunteer at Beaumont Hospital 
in Taylor she has given over 180 hours of 
services to staff and patients in the surgical 
lounge, radiology, wound care, welcome desk, 
and bariatric surgery areas. 
Her colleagues at Beaumont describe her 
as kind, compassionate, smart, and hard-
working—truly a distinguished young woman. 
They have no doubt that she will make an im-
mense difference in the lives of her future pa-
tients. Even as a busy student, in her spare 
time she is active in her church, helps children 
learn to play soccer, and volunteers at a local 
food distribution center. It is safe to say that 
Ms. Crockett has a bright future ahead of her 
and we will all benefit from her drive and pas-
sion for helping others. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Deidre Crockett and in con-
gratulating her for being the recipient of the 
Distinguished Young Woman Award. We are 
grateful for her exemplary service to our com-
munity in Wayne County and beyond. We join 
with Deidre’s friends, family, and colleagues in 
thanking her for her hard work and dedication 
to her field and wish her the best in the future.

CONGRATULATING RABBI MICAH 
GREENSTEIN 
HON. STEVE COHEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 15, 2021 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate Rabbi Micah Greenstein of 
Temple Israel in Memphis for his 30 years 
leading the historic, 167-year-old congrega-
tion. 
Rabbi Greenstein is the most recent in a 
long line of rabbis leading a congregation 
whose history is entwined with the history of 
the city of Memphis, from the Civil War and 
yellow fever epidemic, through both World 
Wars and the Civil Rights movement. 
One of Rabbi Greenstein’s predecessors, 
Rabbi James Wax, led the Memphis Ministe-
rial Association during the Memphis Sanitation 
Workers strike and the assassination of Dr. 
Martin Luther King Jr., in 1968. 
Rabbi Greenstein has been instrumental in 
working with the Memphis Interfaith Coalition 
for Action and Hope (MICAH), his namesake, 
a group dedicated to dealing with social issues 
and economic and educational disparities in 
our community. Rabbi Greenstein returned 
Temple Israel to Midtown Memphis when he 
dedicated Temple Israel Crosstown, an auxil-
iary branch in Crosstown Center, an important 
move for Judaism in Memphis. 
Rabbi Greenstein is a great orator and the 
congregation looks forward to hearing his High 
Holy Days remarks each year. He is also the 
Jerry West of rabbis for his ability to select 
phenomenal cantors and associate rabbis to 
complement his talents and present an All 
Star team at Temple Israel, from Rabbi Katie 
Bauman to Rabbi Bess Wohlner to cantorial 
soloist Happie Hoffman and many others, in-
cluding a husband-wife team. 
Rabbi Greenstein has brought together 
Memphis religious leaders addressing Mem-
phis’ crime problems and helped calm anxi-
eties after the September 11 terrorist attacks 
by linking arms with Muslim and Christian 
leaders. I commend Rabbi Greenstein—my 
rabbi—for his 30 years of service in Memphis 
and wish him many more productive years in 
our community.

RECOGNIZING MR. PATRICK B. 
LOFTUS ON HIS RETIREMENT 
HON. MIKE QUIGLEY 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 15, 2021 
Mr. QUIGLEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to join TTX Company CEO, Tom Wells, and 
his colleagues in honoring Mr. Patrick B. 
Loftus. Pat recently retired from his position as 
the company’s Senior Vice President, Law and 
Administration. 
Pat’s retirement marks the end of a distin-
guished career as a leader in his company 
and in the railroad industry, including years as 
a spokesman and strategist for TTX and the 
industry here in Washington. 
Pat has been with TTX for 35 years, begin-
ning as a litigator when the company was 
known as Trailer Train, rising to General 
Counsel in 2001, Corporate Secretary a year 
later, and assuming his most recent wide- 
ranging responsibilities as Senior Vice Presi-
dent in 2013. 
Pat was a leader in legislative fights for fair 
competition in surface transportation and 
spearheaded the company’s successful rela-
tionship with its regulator, the Surface Trans-
portation Board. 
Pat’s many friends on Capitol Hill, in the rail 
industry, and in his company will miss his in-
sight, skills as an advocate, and trademark 
good humor. We wish Pat all the best. 
Madam Speaker, please join me and all our 
colleagues in the House of Representatives in 
recognizing Mr. Loftus’ years of service and 
congratulating him on his retirement.

HONORING DON REID 
HON. DAN BISHOP 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 15, 2021 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, today I rise to honor my good friend 
Don Reid and to wish him a very happy 90th 
birthday. Don, a stalwart conservative, served 
on the Charlotte City Council from 1991 to 
1999. There, he established a reputation as a 
zealous defender of the taxpayer—demanding 
accountability, asking tough questions, and 
standing against imprudent and ill-advised big 
spending projects, even if that meant standing 
alone. Among those big spending projects: a 
proposed taxpayer-funded NBA stadium and 
an expensive light rail system. 
Twenty years off the Council, the passage 
of time has proven Don right again and again. 
In addition to his service on the Council, Don 
helped found the watchdog group Citizens for 
Effective Government and hosted weekly 
breakfast meetings in Charlotte that were 
must-attend events for those interested in 
local politics. Don, you continue to be an im-
portant voice on behalf of fiscal responsibility, 
and Charlotte is grateful for your service. 
Happy birthday. 
HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF SERGEANT KAILA SULLIVAN 
HON. BRIAN BABIN 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 15, 2021 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life and sacrifice of Sergeant Kaila 
Sullivan, a 16-year veteran of the Nassau Bay 
Police Department. 
On December 10, 2019, Sergeant Kaila Sul-
livan was killed in the line of duty while assist-
ing an arrest in the Clear Lake area. Her trag-
ic death is a grim reminder that the job of a 
police officer protecting our streets can be 
dangerous and deadly, even on the most rou-
tine of days, and that our law enforcement offi-
cers deserve our gratitude and respect. 
Her friends and colleagues remember Kaila 
as the ‘‘rock’’ of her police force, a hero, and 
a ‘‘peace officer’s peace officer.’’ She was an 
enthusiastic advocate for victims of domestic 
violence and a natural leader revered by her 
community. She always strived to excel at her 
job as a police officer, and her long list of 
roles within the force reflects that; Sullivan 
served as a bike patrol instructor, a mental 
health officer, a field training officer, crime pre-
vention specialist, and Rape Aggression De-
fense (RAD) instructor in addition to her duties 
as Sergeant. 
But Kaila was not just a police officer. She 
was a devoted mother and loving wife, a 
friend to all, and quite the entertainer with ‘‘the 
voice of an angel.’’ She enjoyed playing the 
guitar, riding horses, and was often seen 
around town in her overhauled, monster truck- 
like pickup. She loved hiking, being outdoors, 
and spending time with her family, but most of 
all, people remember her being totally dedi-
cated to the community she served. 
Sergeant Kaila Sullivan was Nassau Bay 
Police Department’s first death in the line of 
duty. Her loss continues to reverberate in the 
Nassau Bay community, as it will for many 
years. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to honor Ser-
geant Kaila Sullivan and her family for her 
service. God bless Texas, Nassau Bay, and 
Sergeant Kaila Sullivan.

RECOGNIZING CARLI LLOYD 
HON. ANDY KIM 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 15, 2021 
Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize and congratulate Carli 
Lloyd on her retirement from a sixteen-year 
international career in professional soccer as a 
member of the United States Women’s Na-
tional Team. 
Carli grew up in Delran, New Jersey, and 
while she participated in numerous sports, she 
always gravitated towards soccer. She began 
playing at 5 years old and quickly excelled as 
a youth player. Later she even recalled some 
of her fondest memories were when she 
played on the Medford Strikers. From the mo-
ment she returned home from school, Carli 
could be found on any patch of grass big 
enough to kick a ball. Whether she was play-
ing against men in pickup games or with

younger siblings in her family’s upstairs hall-
way, Carli’s competitive nature and ambition to 
be the best player on the field was always on 
display. 
After playing on Rutgers University’s team, 
Carli’s removal from the Under 21 Women’s 
National Soccer Team forced her to re-exam-
ine her approach to achieving her ultimate 
dream of being on the Women’s National 
Team. As we all know, for Carli simply being 
on the team wasn’t enough. She has gone on 
to compete in 312 international games, the 
second highest tally in U.S. soccer history. 
She played in 25 World Cup matches and 22 
Olympic matches. She is the highest scoring 
midfielder in U.S. history and just a few 
months ago scored after playing for just 23 
seconds, the second fastest goal scorer at the 
start of a match in Women’s National Team 
History. A team general manager described 
Carli as, ‘‘the embodiment of the DNA of a 
U.S. Women’s National Team player.’’ 
For those of us watching in stadiums or on 
television, we only see a fraction of what is 
truly required to compete at the highest 
level—the hard work, perseverance, self- 
taught-confidence that each player must have. 
While Carli leaves behind a legendary record, 
truly a legacy, her adherence to self-improve-
ment and love for the sport is perhaps what 
she will forever be remembered. 
Madam Speaker, Carli is an inspiration to all 
of us in New Jersey, particularly our daugh-
ters, and represents the best of us. Her integ-
rity, humility and dedication to her teammates 
inspires us to become the best version of our-
selves, and I wish her the best of luck in the 
next chapter of her life.
