PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Eternal God, we approach this new 
day, in this new year, serving in this 
new Congress, keenly aware of the 
challenges all this newness brings. We 
have new rules and new colleagues, in 
some cases new offices, and new deci-
sions, each of which threaten to test 
our resilience and try our patience. 
Remind us then, that on each new 
morning, we are renewed with Your 
mercies, grounded in Your steadfast 
love for us, and inspired by the great-
ness of Your faithfulness to each of us. 
We wait on You, the one who has cre-
ated this day, to refresh not just our 
strength, but to renew the spirit of our 
minds, that so fortified, we would yield 
ourselves to You throughout the day. 
Transform our attitudes that we would 
not allow our debate, our actions, our-
selves to be conformed by any other 
purpose or perspective than Your own. 
As we encounter the choices that will 
be laid before us, give us discernment 
to know and to do Your will—to seek 
to do what is good and acceptable and 
perfect. 
For by the grace given to us this new 
day, we give You thanks. 
We pray these things in the strength 
of Your holy name. 
Amen.

Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that all Members may have 5 
legislative days in which to revise and 
extend their remarks and include ex-

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there

Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New

I thank Representatives CONNOLLY 
and COMER for working on this impor-
tant bipartisan issue. 
A version of this bill passed the 
House in the last Congress, and it has 
been improved after receiving tech-
nical assistance from the General Serv-
ices Administration. The Federal Risk 
and Authorization Management Pro-
gram Authorization Act would codify 
and improve the existing FedRAMP in 
the General Services Administration. 
First established in 2011, FedRAMP is 
an important program that certifies 
cloud service providers who wish to 
offer services and products to the Fed-
eral Government. 
The FedRAMP certification process 
outlined in this bill is comprehensive,

facilitates easier agency adoption, pro-
motes agency reuse, and encourages 
savings. The FedRAMP process uses a 
risk-based approach to ensure the reli-
ability of any cloud platform that 
hosts unclassified government data. 
A significant provision of this bill is 
the Federal Secure Cloud Advisory 
Committee. This committee would be 
tasked with key responsibilities, in-
cluding providing technical expertise 
on cloud products and services and 
identifying ways to reduce costs associ-
ated with FedRAMP certification. 
The Director of the Office of Manage-
ment and Budget would be required to 
issue 
regulations 
pertaining 
to 
FedRAMP and would ensure that agen-
cies are not using cloud service pro-
viders without authorizations. This bill 
supports a critical effort to keep our 
Nation’s information secure in cloud 
environments. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to 
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
21, the FedRAMP Authorization Act, 
introduced by my distinguished col-
league 
and 
friend, 
Representative 
GERRY CONNOLLY. 
Cybersecurity and technology mod-
ernization are both vital issues to en-
sure this government runs efficiently 
and effectively. This is even clearer in 
light 
of 
the 
unprecedented 
recent 
cyberattack that compromised both 
the private and public sectors’ critical 
information systems. Congress must 
work to further the Federal Govern-
ment’s cybersecurity while moving 
Federal agencies to more modern solu-
tions, which will help keep our public 
data safe and provide improved serv-
ices to our Nation’s citizens. 
The Federal Risk and Authorization 
Program, or FedRAMP, is the main 
Federal program focused on helping 
agencies procure secure cloud com-
puting services. The FedRAMP pro-
vides a consistent process for agencies 
to procure modern cloud systems in ac-
cordance with established Federal cy-
bersecurity standards. Recent Federal 
policies make the focus on securing 
cloud services especially important. 
With both the Cloud First initiative 
in 2011 and the Cloud Smart initiative 
from President Trump’s administra-
tion, the government continues to 
focus on adopting modern, cost-effec-
tive cloud technology solutions. 
The Federal Government is plagued 
by reoccurring problems in information 
technology, such as low asset utiliza-
tion, duplicative systems, and frag-
mented resources. Shifting to the cloud 
provides for improved asset utilization, 
increased innovation, and more agile 
and responsive technology capabilities. 
These improved efficiencies have led to 
significant cost savings. 
In fiscal year 2018, the government 
spent roughly $6.5 billion on cloud com-
puting, with 84 percent coming from 
FedRAMP authorized cloud computing 
providers. 
The centralized security authoriza-
tion process offered by the FedRAMP 
program has saved agencies over $250 
million in cost avoidance, according to 
the General Services Administration. 
Recognizing these cost benefits, this 
legislation aims to increase the Fed-
eral Government’s use of the con-
sistent, centrally managed cloud com-
puting security authorizations pro-
vided by the FedRAMP program. Codi-
fying this successful program into law 
is an important step towards encour-
aging Federal agencies to take full ad-
vantage of this program and all the se-
curity benefits that it offers. 
Mr. Speaker, again, I thank my col-
league, Representative CONNOLLY, for 
introducing this bill. I urge my col-
leagues to support the bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to 
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CON-
NOLLY). 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the distinguished chairwoman of 
our committee for her graciousness in 
not only bringing this bill back to the 
floor, but making it the first legisla-
tive bill we are going to consider in the 
new Congress. I thank my good friend 
from New York. I also thank my friend 
from Alabama for his gracious words 
and his partnership on so many issues 
on our committee on a bipartisan 
basis. 
I want to thank the majority leader 
for bringing this bill to the floor. I also 
want to thank the ranking member of 
the full committee, Mr. COMER; and the 
ranking member of our subcommittee, 
Mr. HICE, for cosponsoring this bill, 
making it as bipartisan as we get. 
H.R. 21, the FedRAMP Authorization 
Act, would finally provide a statutory 
framework—which we currently lack— 
for the Federal Risk and Authorization 
Management Program, FedRAMP. 
FedRAMP is a standardized approach 
to certifying and assessing in an ongo-
ing manner the security of cloud com-
puting technologies used across the 
Federal Government. FedRAMP seeks 
to reduce the redundancies of Federal 
cloud migration by creating a ‘‘certify 
once, reuse many times’’ model for 
cloud products and services that pro-
vide cost-effective, risk-based approach 
to cloud adoption. Enabling the effi-
cient and secure procurement of cloud 
computing technology is an important 
part of Federal IT modernization ef-
forts and essential to the Federal Gov-
ernment’s transition to a more virtual 
posture amid the pandemic. 
In the first 4 years of FedRAMP, the 
program authorized only 20 cloud prod-
ucts. Today, there are 211 FedRAMP 
authorized cloud products that Federal 
agencies can use and more than 240 
cloud service providers participating in 
FedRAMP, 30 percent of which are 
small businesses—female-owned, mi-
nority-owned, and veteran-owned busi-
nesses. In fiscal year 2020, FedRAMP 
saw a 50 percent increase in agencies 
reusing authorized cloud products. 
This bill already passed the House in 
the last Congress with bipartisan sup-
port not once, but twice; once under 
suspension by voice vote and once as 
an amendment to the House version of 
the National Defense Authorization 
Act. 
After incorporating technical assist-
ance that the chairwoman mentioned 
from the General Services Administra-
tion and other key stakeholders, I rise 
again to offer the FedRAMP Authoriza-
tion Act. 
For nearly 4 years, we have worked 
with the Office of Management and 
Budget, GSA, industry stakeholders, 
and our friends on both sides of the 
aisle to make the needed improve-
ments so FedRAMP can be codified in 
law. 
This bill is essential, and it will dem-
onstrate a universal commitment to 
FedRAMP and the accelerated adop-
tion of secure cloud computing tech-
nologies, a vital component of the 
broader Federal IT modernization ef-
fort. And we know it is needed after 
the cyber hack, probably led by the 
Russians, in the last few weeks. 
The FedRAMP Authorization Act 
would codify the program and address 
many of the concerns raised by indus-
try and government stakeholders. 
First, the bill reduces duplication of 
security assessments and other obsta-
cles to agency adoption of cloud prod-
ucts by establishing a presumption of 
adequacy for cloud technologies that 
have received FedRAMP certification. 
This is important so that companies 
are not spending millions of dollars 
simply to get the same certification 
over and over again. 
b 1215 
The bill would also facilitate agency 
reuse of cloud technologies that have 
already received an authorization-to- 
operate by requiring agencies to check 
a centralized and secure repository. 
It requires that GSA work toward 
automating their processes, which will 
lead to more standard security. It will 
establish a Federal secure cloud advi-
sory committee to ensure dialogue 
among GSA, agency cybersecurity and 
procurement officials, and industry 
representatives for effective and ongo-
ing coordination. 
Finally, it authorizes $20 million in 
annual appropriations for the program, 
providing sufficient resources to in-
crease the number of secure cloud tech-
nologies available and to allow free and 
fair competition, especially for our 
small and minority-owned businesses. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge that the House 
act on this first bill on the first day of 
our legislative activity. Again, I thank 
our 
distinguished 
chairwoman 
for 
being so generous in bringing this bill 
up again. 
Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers. I am prepared to 
close, and I yield myself the balance of 
my time.

valuable information by improving the

history as a strong advocate of trans-
parency in the operations of the Fed-
eral Government. 
This bill builds on the work of the 
committee 
to 
improve 
government 
transparency by allowing the public to 
more easily learn how Federal agencies 
spend their taxpayer dollars. 
Mr. Speaker, I support this bill, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
22, the Congressional Budget Justifica-
tion Transparency Act. 
The Congressional Budget Justifica-
tion Transparency Act is a long-over-
due reform that would ensure Congress 
and the Nation’s taxpayers can under-
stand the full scope and context of the 
annual Federal budget. 
I thank my colleagues, Congressman 
MIKE
QUIGLEY
and Ranking Member 
JAMES COMER, for working together on 
this important bipartisan legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 22 will truly open 
up the executive branch annual budget 
request and provide needed trans-
parency of each agency’s detailed budg-
et justifications. The American public 
and each of their congressional Rep-
resentatives deserve full access to the 
annual agency plans to spend their 
hard-earned tax dollars. 
This past year alone, the Federal 
Government spent more than $6.5 tril-
lion. Public spending transparency re-
sources, like USAspending.gov, are cur-
rently helping the public track ongoing 
agency spending activity. However, the 
annual congressional budget justifica-
tions provide detailed and plain lan-
guage explanations of how each Fed-
eral agency plans to spend congres-
sional appropriations. 
Currently, these valuable budget doc-
uments are sent directly to congres-
sional appropriators and are then post-
ed across hundreds of disconnected 
agency web pages. This makes them ex-
tremely hard to track down. 
H.R. 22 simply requires the budget 
justifications of every agency to be 
made publicly available on a single 
website. To do this, the bill requires 
the Office of Management and Budget 
to issue a full listing of agency budget 
justifications and the individual agen-
cy web pages where they are posted. 
This will assure the public that they 
have access to the complete publica-
tion of these authoritative budget re-
sources. 
The bill also requires the U.S. Treas-
ury Department to centrally publish 
all the materials on USAspending.gov 
as open data. 
As established in 2014 by the DATA 
Act, USAspending.gov is quickly be-
coming the primary public resource for 
the public to track how the govern-
ment is using their tax dollars. Adding 
congressional budget justifications to 
USAspending.gov will provide even bet-
ter context to agency spending activ-
ity. 
Thanks to another House Committee 
on Oversight and Reform-produced law, 
the 2018 Good Accounting Obligation in 
Government Act, congressional budget 
justifications 
also 
now 
list 
unimplemented inspector general audit 
and 
GAO 
report 
recommendations. 
This means H.R. 22 will also help Con-
gress and the public annually track 
open 
IG 
and 
GAO 
oversight 
rec-
ommendations. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague 
from Illinois (Mr. QUIGLEY). I urge my 
colleagues to support this legislation, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Illinois 
(Mr. 
QUIGLEY). 
Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, I proud-
ly rise in support of my Congressional 
Budget 
Justification 
Transparency 
Act, H.R. 22. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman will put on his mask. 
Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, it is a 
bipartisan bill that addresses the lack 
of transparency around the documents 
that explain why executive agencies 
are requesting funds from Congress. 
These justifications shed light on the 
work and priorities of the Federal Gov-
ernment far more effectively than 
high-level spending figures. 
Mr. Speaker, in 2018 and 2019, Con-
gress encouraged OMB to publish all 
executive branch congressional budget 
justification materials on a centralized 
web portal. However, there is no legal 
requirement for congressional budget 
justifications to be posted on a central-
ized portal or on agency websites. 
For these reasons, agencies are in-
consistent in posting congressional 
budget justifications online, making 
them difficult to access because they 
are either not publicly available or are 
scattered across the internet. 
Mr. Speaker, my bill will strengthen 
Federal Government transparency by 
requiring Federal agencies to publish 
their annual budget justifications on-
line in a central location. This will bet-
ter allow oversight of our government 
and allow the American people to 
verify that their taxpayer dollars are 
being used wisely to invest in their 
communities. 
All Illinoisans and Americans should 
get the transparency they deserve on 
government spending, and the bill does 
just that. 
Mr. Speaker, I recognize Chairwoman 
MALONEY and Ranking Member COMER 
for their unwavering support for this 
bill and for prioritizing this legislation 
early on in the 117th Congress. I thank 
them again for their leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bipartisan bill. 
Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers, and I am prepared to 
close. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. I strongly urge my 
colleagues to support this common-
sense transparency legislation, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. 
JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the chairwoman for her leader-
ship and continued respect for the 
oversight of this body. And I particu-
larly thank the gentleman from Illi-
nois and his cosponsors for this very 
astute legislation. 
I join with my bipartisan colleagues 
to indicate that the transparency of 
funding by way of the budget process is 
absolutely crucial to be able to be 
guided by what is right, as well, to en-
sure that we, the Congress, have a 
knowledge of the importance of the 
funding process, the importance of the 
programs that are used for taxpayer 
dollars. 
Mr. Speaker, let me just take a mi-
crocosm of what I believe will be an 
important aspect of this. Why don’t I 
take COVID–19 as an example? 
Mr. Speaker, I believe that we have 
been hearing from all over the Nation 
that the Federal Government needs to 
be in charge. The agency that I think 
would be most effective as a national 
coordinator of vaccine transport and 
delivery is FEMA. 
For safe and effective supply chain 
transport, delivery, and site use of vac-
cines, FEMA has the ability to tell 
other agencies what to do or to be able 
to be part of the success of the dis-
tribution of these vaccines. They have 
broad stakeholder engagement. FEMA 
has personnel all over the Nation, and 
they are not in the business of picking 
business winners or losers. And imple-
menting CDC COVID–19 vaccine rec-
ommendations, they know how to do 
that. 
Mr. Speaker, I say thank you to all 
the private-sector volunteers, all the 
pharmacies located in grocery stores 
and well-known chains, but that is not 
working. It is not going to work. 
This particular legislation would let 
us know the budget plan of an agency, 
like FEMA, which really looms large in 
our lives because whether you have ex-
perienced a fire in California, or wheth-
er or not you have experienced Hurri-
cane Harvey in Texas, or whether or 
not you have experienced tornadoes, 
FEMA has been on the ground. They 
know how to put large efforts together. 
They can lead the effort for vaccine de-
livery so that we don’t have these 
kinds of episodes. 
‘‘One American dies from COVID–19 
every 33 seconds.’’ Mr. Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD an article.

ROLLOUT
HITS 
SNAGS 
(By Holly Yan and Madeline Holcombe) 
While hopes of vaccinating 20 million peo-
ple by New Year’s Day sputtered out, the US 
now faces staggering new challenges in the 
fight against Covid–19. 
Over the past week, the US has averaged 
2,637 coronavirus deaths every day, according 
to Johns Hopkins University. 
That’s an average of one Covid–19 death 
every 33 seconds. 
December was the deadliest month yet of 
this pandemic, with 77,572 lives lost. And

deaths are likely to accelerate as new infec-
tions and hospitalizations rise. 
On Monday, more people were hospitalized 
with Covid–19 than any other day in this 
pandemic—128,210, according to the Covid 
Tracking Project. 
The US averaged 213,437 new infections 
every day over the past week, largely fueled 
by holiday gatherings, health experts say. 
But while daily new infections soared 16% 
over the past week, testing has actually de-
creased 11.65% over the past week, according 
to the Covid Tracking Project. 
Doctors worry this rampant spread of 
Covid–19 will push more hospitals beyond ca-
pacity and lead to more deaths as the vac-
cine rollout staggers along. 
THE POSSIBILITY OF GIVING HALF-DOSES OF A 
VACCINE 
About 15.4 million vaccine doses have been 
distributed in the US, but only 4.5 million 
people have received their first doses, the US 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
said Monday. 
That’s far behind what officials had hoped 
for by now. And it means herd immunity is 
still many months away. 
‘‘We agree that there is a lag. We’ll work 
with the states,’’ said Moncef Slaoui, chief 
scientific adviser of the federal Operation 
Warp Speed vaccination effort. 
To help expedite vaccinations, the US 
might start giving half-doses of Moderna’s 
Covid–19 vaccine to people age 18 to 55, which 
could make the vaccine available to twice as 
many people in that age group, Slaoui said. 
Slaoui said Sunday the US Food and Drug 
Administration would meet this week to 
consider the idea. 
But the FDA commissioner and its vaccine 
division chief said in a joint statement that 
people need to get two full doses instead of 
two half-doses. 
‘‘At this time, suggesting changes to the 
FDA-authorized dosing or schedules of these 
vaccines is premature and not rooted solidly 
in the available evidence,’’ said FDA Com-
missioner Dr. Stephen Hahn and Dr. Peter 
Marks, who heads the agency’s vaccine divi-
sion. ‘‘Without appropriate data supporting 
such changes in vaccine administration, we 
run a significant risk of placing public 
health at risk, undermining the historic vac-
cination efforts to protect the population 
from Covid–19.’’ 
It’s understandable that people may want 
to stretch the vaccine supply, they said. But 
it’s not advisable. 
‘‘If people do not truly know how protec-
tive a vaccine is, there is the potential for 
harm because they may assume that they 
are fully protected when they are not, and 
accordingly, alter their behavior to take un-
necessary risks,’’ they said. 
The two 100-microgram Moderna vaccine 
doses are intended to be spaced 28 days 
apart. 
CNN has reached out to Moderna for com-
ment. 
Dr. Jonathan Reiner, a professor of medi-
cine at George Washington University, said 
he does not agree with the idea of half-doses. 
‘‘We have about 13 million doses that have 
been shipped out to the states, and only 
barely 4 million doses that have gone into 
arms. So the bottleneck is not the lack of 
availability of vaccine. The bottleneck is ac-
tually the logistics of vaccinating people in 
this country.’’ 
It’s difficult enough to get some patients 
on board with getting a vaccine, he said. 
Going against the recommended dosing could 
hurt patients’ confidence. 
‘‘When I see people in clinic, I talk about 
the vaccine every single day. I’m trying to 
reduce vaccine hesitancy,’’ Reiner said Mon-
day. 
‘‘And the strongest weapon I have is the 
data. I can tell people that these two vac-
cines have been studied in 70,000 people— 
more than 70,000 people—in this two-dose 
strategy. And when given that way, they’re 
both 95% effective, and basically no one gets 
critically ill if you get this vaccine. . . . 
Once you break from the data, I can no 
longer say that.’’ 
STUDY SAYS HOLDING BACK FEWER DOSES 
COULD CUT CASES BY 29% 
Right now, the federal government is allo-
cating about half of the vaccines being pro-
duced. The other half is held in reserve to be 
used as a second dose or as replacements in 
cases where doses are unusable. 
But by reducing the amount withheld to 
10% for the first three weeks and supplying a 
steady dose of 6 million doses per week, the 
US could avoid up to 29% more coronavirus 
cases over eight weeks, a study published in 
the Annals of Internal Medicine found. 
‘‘We find that under most plausible sce-
narios, a more balanced approach that with-
holds fewer doses during early distribution 
in order to vaccinate more people as soon as 
possible could substantially increase the 
benefits of vaccines, while enabling most re-
cipients to receive second doses on sched-
ule,’’ write the study’s authors, who were 
supported by the Canadian Institutes for 
Health Research and the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention. 
The researchers modeled several scenarios, 
with variables including vaccine supply, pro-
tection provided by the first dose, and wan-
ing efficacy of a first dose if a second dose is 
delayed. 
AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT EMPLOYEE DIES 
OF COVID–19 
In California, health care workers are 
treating an unprecedented number of Covid– 
19 patients. Sometimes, those patients are 
colleagues. 
At Kaiser Permanente San Jose Medical 
Center, 44 emergency department employees 
tested positive for Covid–19 between Decem-
ber 27 and January 1, said Irene Chavez, sen-
ior vice president and area manager. 
On Monday, the hospital said one employee 
who was working on Christmas has died of 
Covid–19. 
‘‘Our thoughts and prayers are with those 
affected by this terrible loss,’’ the hospital 
said in a statement. ‘‘We are providing sup-
port to our employees during this difficult 
time,’’ according to a statement from the 
hospital. 
Over the weekend, Chavez said the medical 
center is investigating whether an inflatable, 
air-powered costume may have played a role 
in the spread. 
‘‘A staff member did appear briefly in the 
emergency department on December 25th 
wearing an air-powered costume,’’ she said. 
‘‘Any exposure, if it occurred, would have 
been completely innocent, and quite acci-
dental, as the individual had no Covid symp-
toms and only sought to lift the spirits of 
those around them during what is a very 
stressful time.’’ 
Chavez said air-powered costumes will no 
longer be allowed at the facility. 
‘‘If anything, this should serve as a very 
real reminder that the virus is widespread, 
and often without symptoms, and we must 
all be vigilant,’’ she said. 
‘A ROUGH START TO 2021’ 
On Sunday, five states reported their high-
est number of new infections ever in one 
day—Arizona, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, 
South Carolina and Washington. 
And over the past week, at least five states 
have average test positivity rates higher 
than 40%—meaning more than 40% of people 
who take a Covid–19 test get a positive re-
sult. 
Those states include Idaho (57%), Alabama 
(46.7%), Iowa (44.6%), Pennsylvania (44%) and 
South Dakota (43.8%). For perspective, the 
WHO has recommended governments not re-
open until the test positivity rates stays at 
or below 5% for 14 days. 
In South Carolina, which had a 29.6% test 
positivity rate Sunday, officials in four 
counties said their hospitals were at 100% ca-
pacity, according to the South Carolina De-
partment of Health and Environmental Con-
trol. 
‘‘We’re in for a bit of a rough start to 
2021,’’ said Maria Van Kerkhove, the World 
Health Organization’s technical lead for 
Covid–19 response. 
But it’s possible daily life in the US could 
be closer to normal by the summer or fall, 
she said. Other countries are already well on 
their way—thanks to quarantining, testing, 
isolation and contact tracing. 
‘‘We’ve seen countries bring this virus to 
its 
knees, 
without 
vaccination,’’ 
Van 
Kerkhove said. ‘‘We have the tools at hand 
right now to actually bring this virus under 
control.’’ 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. The city of 
Houston has done a phenomenal job by 
trying to open up these centers, but 
guess what? They are looking for their 
next delivery. We should not be looking 
for the next delivery. The delivery 
should be organized, logistically. It 
should be stored on the ground. 
‘‘Houston, have you finished your 
utilization? Are you ready for your 
next?’’ 
‘‘L.A., have you finished your utiliza-
tion? Are you ready for your next?’’ 
That is not happening. 
‘‘COVID vaccine rollout is going 
about as well as you’d feared.’’ Mr. 
Speaker, I include in the RECORD that 
article, along with an article regarding 
the opening of Houston’s first public 
COVID–19 vaccine location. 
COVID VACCINE ROLLOUT IS GOING ABOUT AS 
WELL AS YOU’D FEARED 
Texans are beginning the new year the 
same way we spent much of the last one: 
straggling through a devastating pandemic 
with a patchy public health infrastructure, a 
confusing mishmash of rules and procedures, 
and an ominous absence of effective state-
wide leadership. 
We have a COVID–19 vaccine now: that’s 
the good news. Two of them, actually, one by 
Pfizer and the other by Moderna, both devel-
oped as part of the federal Operation Warp 
Speed and approved by the Federal Drug Ad-
ministration for emergency use last month. 
We knew that distributing hundreds of mil-
lions of vaccines would be a challenge. Each 
requires two doses and careful handling—in-
cluding ultra-cold storage for the Pfizer vac-
cine. Each is being distributed to a popu-
lation that includes potential recipients 
skeptical of vaccines in general, and the 
COVID vaccine in particular. 
But we had several months to figure this 
out. And it’s quickly become painfully clear 
that we didn’t. 
In Phase 1A of the plan put forward by the 
Texas Department of State Health Services, 
the first doses of the vaccine were distrib-
uted to front-line health care workers and 
residents of long-term care facilities, begin-
ning last month. On Tuesday, the state an-
nounced that vaccine providers could begin 
immunizing Texans in group 1B—those over 
age 65 and those with pre-existing condi-
tions.

January 5, 2021 
The experiences of Texans in that group 
gives you the impression that we’ve re-
sponded to an ongoing crisis with a mad-
dening, high-stakes scavenger hunt. In Har-
ris County, for example, there are dozens of 
providers that have partnered with the state 
to distribute vaccines, but making an ap-
pointment at any of them seems to require 
persistence, endless phone calls, and a hefty 
dose of luck. 
Overall, the distribution process has been 
inefficient and confusing. As of Dec. 31, ac-
cording to DSHS, some 283,000 people across 
Texas—roughly 45,000 in Harris County—had 
received the first dose of the vaccine. That’s 
of the 773,000 doses the state had shipped to 
various providers, up to that point. 
And it’s a worrisomely low figure, accord-
ing to public health professionals, given that 
we’ll need to vaccinate up to 80 percent of 
the population to achieve the herd immunity 
that will allow normal life to resume. Dr. 
Peter Hotez, professor and dean of the Na-
tional School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor 
College of Medicine, has pointed to the 
straightforward back-of-the-envelope math: 
with roughly 30 million people in Texas, we 
should be aiming for a million immuniza-
tions a week to achieve herd immunity by 
mid-year. 
Last week, as these difficulties began com-
ing to light, Gov. Greg Abbott pointed the 
finger at the state’s hospitals and other vac-
cine providers. 
‘‘A significant portion of vaccines distrib-
uted across Texas might be sitting on hos-
pital shelves as opposed to being given to 
vulnerable Texans,’’ Abbott said on Twitter. 
‘‘The state urges vaccine providers to 
quickly provide all shots,’’ he continued. 
‘‘We get plenty more each week.’’ 
In the Houston area, at least, providers say 
they’re doing just that. And Texans are hav-
ing unpleasant memories of the early days of 
the pandemic, when state leaders such as Ab-
bott took a largely hands-off approach to the 
public health response—intervening only 
when local leaders in cities such as Houston 
and Austin crossed what he deemed to be a 
red line. 
‘‘Here we are, once again, hoping that pri-
vate companies will figure out a decent vac-
cine distribution system since the State of 
Texas sure hasn’t,’’ said state Rep. Erin 
Zwiener, a Democrat, on Twitter. ‘‘But that 
means it will be disparate and confusing and 
hard for our constituents to navigate.’’ 
These issues aren’t unique to Texas. Even 
states with relatively robust public health 
systems have seen what Massachusetts Gov. 
Charlie Baker described this week as a 
‘‘lumpy and bumpy’’ rollout. 
An exasperated U.S. Sen. Mitt Romney of 
Utah vented in a statement on New Year’s 
Day. 
‘‘That comprehensive vaccination plans 
have not been developed at the federal level 
and sent to the states as models is as incom-
prehensible as it is inexcusable,’’ Romney 
said. 
‘‘It was unrealistic to assume that the 
health care workers already overburdened 
with COVID care could take on a massive 
vaccination program,’’ he continued. ‘‘So too 
is the claim that CVS and Walgreens will 
save the day: they don’t have excess per-
sonnel available to inoculate millions of 
Americans. Nor are they equipped to deal 
with the rare but serious reactions which 
may occur.’’ 
The distribution of COVID vaccines is, 
without question, a matter of urgency. We 
begin the new year with more than 12,000 
Texans hospitalized due to the virus, and 
public health experts fretting about the im-
pact of holiday gatherings and travel on 
those statistics—as well as reports that 
cases of a more transmissible variant of the 
virus have been confirmed in the United 
States. 
The state’s plan to rely on public/private 
partnerships to distribute the vaccine may 
be sensible, given Texas’s extant public 
health infrastructure. But, at the minimum, 
we need better communication from state 
leaders about how Texans who are eligible 
for the vaccine can access it—not finger- 
pointing and politics. 
HOUSTON’S FIRST PUBLIC COVID–19 VACCINE 
LOCATION OFFICIALLY OPENS 
HOUSTON.—On Saturday, Houston’s first 
public COVID–19 vaccine location opened on 
the city’s Southside. City and state leaders 
believe this could be one of the first public 
Coronavirus vaccine locations to open in the 
country. ‘‘Houston may be the very first city 
of this size to setup a massive distribution of 
vaccines,’’ said Congresswoman Sheila Jack-
son Lee. ‘‘I believe that deserves an ap-
plause.’’ 
The site, located off Knight Road in South 
Houston, had a long line of cars surrounding 
the parking lot early Saturday morning. 
‘‘The goal will be to get these vaccines out 
as quickly as we get them’’ said Houston 
Mayor Sylvester Turner. 
The free Coronavirus shots were originally 
planned to be given to people who made ap-
pointments over the phone. However, the 
Houston Health Department quickly had to 
change their plan after being overwhelmed 
with calls. 
Within an hour of opening their call cen-
ter, 
the 
Houston 
Health 
Department 
tweeted, ‘‘The volume of calls to our COVID– 
19 call center overwhelmed the system and 
it’s currently experiencing technical issues 
. . .’’ 
‘‘Call-in centers across the board received 
about 250,000 calls today,’’ said Mayor Tur-
ner. ‘‘The system was literally overwhelmed, 
so we went to Plan B. Plan B was on-site reg-
istration.’’ 
‘‘Seven out of 10 people who die from 
COVID are 65 years and older,’’ said Houston 
Health Department Director Stephen Wil-
liams. ‘‘If you look in line, we’re actually 
seeing those folks, and I’m grateful for 
that.’’ 
Texas recently started Phase 1B of the 
state’s COVID–19 vaccine distribution plan. 
Now, front-line medical works, people at 
least 65 years-old, or adults with chronic 
health issues can get vaccinated. 
‘‘Even though there’s a lot of vaccine hesi-
tancy, there’s still a strong desire from peo-
ple to get the vaccine,’’ said Mayor Turner. 
According to Mayor Turner, he hopes to 
have the City of Houston open a mass dis-
tribution location for Coronavirus shots by 
the end of the week. 
‘‘The New York Mayor announced that 
they were going to try to do 1-million vac-
cines in the month of January,’’ said Mayor 
Turner. ‘‘I think we can do the same thing in 
the month of January. I’d like to do even 
more than that.’’ 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, 
FDA 
is 
considering 
to 
halve 
the 
amount of vaccines going to Ameri-
cans. This haphazard way will not 
work. And the budget bill that is before 
us gives Congress the insight into how 
agencies plan their work. 
So, is FEMA well-funded to take care 
of a pandemic? Were they funded the 
way they should have been in case a 
pandemic came and they were the right 
agency to do it? 
Please remember, when we were flag-
ging around and flustering around at 
the beginning of COVID–19, the PPE 
had to be taken over by FEMA. 
That is what happened. We were 
struggling. People were fighting over 
PPE. Governors were out on the mar-
ket. They were making negotiations 
individually with China while their 
health professionals were dying or 
reusing masks or reusing PPE. FEMA 
came in and did it. 
Mr. Speaker, I will be discussing this 
even further, but I support this legisla-
tion because it gives Members of Con-
gress the ability to know budget and 
appropriations so that if a pandemic 
comes, what agency can handle it? 
FEMA, because it has the funding. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
support the underlying legislation, and 
I look forward to this further discus-
sion. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of 
H.R. 22, the Congressional Budget Justifica-
tion Transparency Act, which requires con-
gressional budget justifications to be posted 
online in a centralized, searchable database, 
as well as on a Federal agency’s websites. 
The bill also would require the Office of 
Management and Budget to maintain and reg-
ularly update a public list of agencies ex-
pected to submit congressional budget jus-
tifications, the date they are submitted to Con-
gress, and when they are posted online. 
This bill is identical to one that passed the 
House under suspension in the last Congress. 
As a member of the Budget Committee, I 
applaud this progovernment budget trans-
parency legislation because it will make sure 
that the people we represent know and under-
stand how each agency is spending taxpayer 
dollars. 
Budget transparency is important during or-
dinary time but is much more important during 
extraordinary times like a global pandemic. 
I am particularly focused on federal pan-
demic response that FEMA is engaged in as 
it relates to the COVID–19 Pandemic. 
Since the beginning of the pandemic, I have 
worked on community access to testing and 
through this effort have opened over 40 test-
ing centers in and around Houston, Texas. 
Now that there are vaccines it is time to 
pivot to vaccinations. 
For this reason, I will be introducing a new 
bill that will address vaccine delivery to every 
community across the nation. 
Making FEMA the lead agency is the first 
step, the next important is making sure the 
American people have access to information 
on how the agency is accomplishing the task 
and at what cost. 
My bill would establish: FEMA as the Na-
tional Coordinator of vaccine transport and de-
livery; Safe and effective supply chain trans-
port, delivery, and site use of vaccines; Broad 
Stakeholder Engagement; No picking business 
winners or losers; and Implementing CDC 
COVID–19 Vaccine Recommendations. 
FEMA will be empowered to: 
Lead the effort for vaccine delivery from the 
receipt from manufacturing facilities to delivery 
to designated inoculation sites (hospital, clinic, 
doctors’ offices, schools, places of worship, 
community centers, parks, or neighborhood 
gathering locations, etc.) 
Develop and deploy a fully staffed and 
resourced 24–7 advanced real-time tracking 
system that allows FEMA to monitor ship-
ments of vaccine units that can provide end- 
to-end transparency on the temperature, real-

ticipated time of arrival, and update recipients 
on the progress of their delivery and report on 
changes that may impact expected delivery or 
the viability of the vaccine while in transit; 
Provide an advanced communication sys-
tem that allows public health departments to 
communicate their vaccine readiness, their ca-
pability of receiving vaccines, delivery loca-
tions, details of facility capability of storing, se-
curing, personnel authorized to receive deliv-
eries, logistics for delivering vaccines to pa-
tients, report on vaccine receipts, condition of

Design custom Apps for use by public 
health agencies, doctors’ offices, etc. to be 
provided to patients to communicate informa-
tion on the vaccine being received and the 
date and location of a second dose if required. 
The App should generate a token that cor-
responds to their vaccination record to ensure 
that the right vaccine is administered should a 
second inoculation be required and to ensure 
that a person is not vaccinated with different 
vaccines, additional information such as vac-
cine effectiveness period may be addressed 
as more is learned about this; 
Secure transportation for delivery or use of 
vaccines, and, when requested, security for 
the vaccine delivery sites or inoculation loca-
tions to ensure the life and safety of personnel 
and patients who seek to provide or receive 
vaccinations are free of interference or threat; 
Provide public education and patient en-
gagement through the provision of inoculations 
of persons in areas and locations where vul-
nerable populations are under performing in

Waive authority of the states to share vac-
cination data with HHS; 
Provide HHS with the capacity to manage 
the inoculations data on persons and tracking 
the second vaccination to ensure full immunity 
and to determine when enough vaccinations 
have been administered to unique persons to 
achieve herd immunity. HHS shall protect Vac-
cination Data as HIPAA protected data, and 
under the Privacy Act, which shall not allow a 
waiver of any provision of that law; and the 
Freedom of Information Act shall not apply to 
the records maintained. 
Provide civil fines of up to $10,000 per vio-

immunity goals being achieved. Include a data 
retention limitation—all records shall be de-
stroyed after 5 years—Sunset this provision 
after 5 years. 
Provide an ombudsman to support: public 
(tribal, territorial, state, and local government); 
stakeholder input on the work being done; pro-
vide advocacy and advice for those who elect 
not to be vaccinated; and champion the pri-

ican people. 
Waive state laws regarding management of 
inoculation data; 
Provide HHS with the capacity as evidenced 
by the agency’s prior experience in managing 
healthcare.gov, to manage the inoculations 
data on persons; for the purpose of tracking 
the second vaccination to ensure full immunity 
and the management of national inoculation 
goals. The protection of inoculation medical in-
formation is provided by the: Federal HIPAA 
medical information privacy law; the Privacy 
Act and eliminate access to that information

from, federal, state, and local governments, 
businesses, 
colleges, 
universities, 
K–12 
schools, hospitals, clinics, professional med-
ical associations. Others as deemed essential 
to the success of a national vaccination pro-
gram. 
Lead government collaboration with Stake-
holders in establishing vaccine inoculation 
centers in locations that shall include: Sta-
diums; Arenas; K–12 schools; Colleges and 
Universities; Places of Worship; and Other lo-
cations determined to be conducive to reach-
ing the greatest number of person who are in 
need of inoculations. 
EMPOWERING FEMA 
FEMA will be empowered to engage all 
stakeholders and marshals the resources of 
the federal government where needed to ac-
complish the objectives. 
FEMA employs about 20,000 people nation-
wide who are stationed in 10 regional offices 
and the Washington DC headquarters. 
FEMA has the authority during times of 
emergency to leverage its tremendous capac-
ity to coordinate within the federal govern-
ment, pull federal agency personnel from 
agencies throughout the federal government to 
make sure America is equipped and prepared 
to respond to disasters. 
I ask that my Colleagues join me in support 
of H.R. 22, and greater accountability to the 
American public on what the federal govern-
ment is doing and the budget justification that 
supports expenditures. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of 
H.R. 22, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. 
CAROLYN B. MALONEY) that the House

SEC. 4. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS. 
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the 
purpose of complying with the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
New York (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY) 
and the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. 
PALMER) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that all Members may have 5 
legislative days in which to revise and 
extend their remarks and include ex-
traneous material on the measure be-
fore us. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the Inspector General 
Protection Act was introduced by Rep-
resentatives TED LIEU and JODY HICE. 
An identical measure passed the House 
in the last Congress. 
I am proud to support this bipartisan 
measure, which would improve the 
independence of inspectors general. 
The bill would also address the disturb-
ingly slow nomination of IGs that has 
been the norm across multiple admin-
istrations. 
The bill would require notification of 
Congress 30 days prior to an IG being 
placed on leave. Such notification is al-
ready required prior to an IG being re-
moved from duty. 
The bill also would require the Presi-
dent to report to Congress if he has not 
nominated an IG after 210 days of a va-
cancy occurring. This report must in-
clude the reasons for failing to make 
the nomination and a target date for 
doing so. The requirement will hope-
fully prod the executive branch to 
nominate IGs in a more timely man-
ner. 
IGs provide critical oversight and ac-
countability within Federal agencies, 
and the positions need to be filled more 
quickly than is currently the case. 
I urge Members to support this bipar-
tisan bill, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
23, the Inspector General Protection 
Act. I want to thank Representatives 
TED LIEU and JODY HICE for working 
together on this legislation. 
H.R. 23 will help Congress track Fed-
eral agency inspectors general vacan-
cies and make sure they are filled by 
the President in a timely manner. 
Inspectors general help combat Fed-
eral fraud, waste, and abuse and im-
prove the operations of the executive 
branch departments and agencies. In-
spectors general help Congress shine 
light on areas of the government that 
need improvement and oversight. How-
ever, both Republican and Democratic 
administrations have experienced nu-
merous and prolonged inspector gen-
eral vacancies. 
The Inspector General Protection 
Act would simply require the President 
to notify Congress of any change to a 
current inspector general’s employ-
ment status. The bill would also re-
quire the President to notify Congress 
if a nomination to replace an inspector 
general does not take place within 210 
days. 
These provisions will improve con-
gressional oversight of the executive 
branch by providing transparency to 
the 
President’s 
inspectors 
general 
nominations. 
Inspectors general are an indispen-
sable resource to Congress and to the 
American people, and Congress can re-
affirm our responsibility to combating 
government waste, fraud, and abuse by 
assuring consistent Federal agency in-
spector general office leadership. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. 
COHEN). 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of Representative LIEU’s In-
spector General Protection Act. 
The inspector general system has 
been invaluable in rooting out waste, 
fraud, and abuse in our Federal pro-
grams, and sometimes even criminal 
activity. It has also instilled con-
fidence in Federal agencies by ensuring 
accountability. That, however, doesn’t 
mean the system is perfect. 
Since the initial passage of the In-
spector General Act of 1978, we have 
seen what works and what doesn’t. We 
have added inspectors general and re-
fined their processes. 
On January 20, a new President will 
be sworn into office and a new adminis-
tration will lead our Federal agencies. 
Before they begin, now is a good time 
to update some of our inspector general 
requirements. 
This bill makes important improve-
ments by requiring disclosure to Con-
gress when an IG is put on nonduty sta-
tus and why a President has not nomi-
nated a permanent IG for a vacant po-
sition. These updates are necessary, 
and we must also do more. 
Last Congress, I introduced the Ap-
pointments Clause Enforcement Act. 
That bill included several important 
changes to the IG system that would 
help make inspectors general more 
independent and instill confidence in 
them. 
For example, rather than the Presi-
dent appointing an acting IG when a 
position is vacant, my bill would have 
the Council of the Inspectors General 
on Integrity and Efficiency develop a 
list of qualified candidates and share 
those with the chief judge of the dis-
trict court in the District of Columbia, 
who would make the appointment. 
That way, a President could not install 
political allies as acting inspectors 
general, even ones who didn’t receive 
the advice and consent of the Senate, 
as a way to reduce oversight. 
We should also clarify provisions to 
make sure that IGs forward legitimate 
whistleblower complaints to Congress 
without political interference and that 
those 
whistleblowers 
are 
protected 
from political retribution. 
I thank Representative LIEU for spon-
soring the Inspector General Protec-
tion Act and Speaker PELOSI for bring-
ing it to the floor as one of our first 
bills. 
I hope that this is the beginning of 
the 117th Congress’ efforts to improve 
the inspector general system that 
works to improve our Federal Govern-
ment’s systems of administration and 
protects policies that are important for 
transparency and integrity of govern-
ment. 
Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield as 
much time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. JORDAN). 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, the integ-
rity of the inspector general process 
and the ability of the President of the 
United States to appoint inspectors 
general is dependent on the integrity of 
the Presidential election. 
During the campaign, Vice President 
Biden would get 55 people at an event. 
President Trump got 55,000 at just one 
rally. President Trump increased his 
vote with African Americans, increased 
his vote with Hispanic Americans, won 
19 of 20 bellwether counties, won Ohio 
by 8, Iowa by 8, Florida by 3, got 11 mil-
lion more votes than he got in 2016, and 
House Republicans won 27 of 27 toss-up 
races. 
But somehow Joe Biden, the guy who 
barely left his house, won the election? 
Maybe. 
But 80 million Americans, both Re-
publicans and Democrats, have their 
doubts, and 60 million Americans think 
the election was stolen—60 million peo-
ple, over one-third of the electorate. 
But no one in this town seems to 
care. Democrats don’t care. The media 
doesn’t care. Eighty million of our fel-
low citizens have their doubts about 
the election 2 months ago, and the 
media and the Democrats say: Nothing 
to see here. 
Of course, this town has been out to 
get the President since July 31, 2016, 
before he was elected the first time. 
Four years and $40 million on the Rus-
sia hoax, but we can’t look into an 
election that 60 million Americans 
think was stolen? 
Nine weeks since election day, not 
one investigation, not one hearing in 
the House of Representatives. We asked 
for it. We asked Chairwoman MALONEY. 
Mr. COMER and I asked for it. We asked

Chairman NADLER. Nope, not going to 
do it. 
We would welcome an inspector gen-
eral investigation, for goodness sake. 
Over 200 affidavits and declarations of 
wrongdoing, but no investigation in 
the Congress—no subpoenas, no deposi-
tions, no chance for questioning or 
cross-examination of witnesses. 
Why? Why won’t they look into it? 
Why no hearings? Why no investiga-
tion? 
I think it is because deep down they 
know there were big problems with this 
past election. They know the Constitu-
tion was violated. 
Article I, Section 4: Time, place, and 
manner for holding elections shall be 
determined in each State by the legis-
lature thereof. 
Article II, Section 1: ‘‘Each State 
shall appoint, in such manner as the 
legislature thereof may direct. . . . ’’ 
Look at Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania 
law says mail-in ballots by 8 o’clock on 
election day. Election day ends at 8 
o’clock. Mail-in ballots have to be in 
by 8 o’clock on election day. The Dem-
ocrat State Supreme Court said: No, we 
are going to extend the election day 
till Friday, till 5 o’clock on Friday. 
Pennsylvania State law says mail-in 
ballots require signature verification. 
The Democrat secretary of state said 
no. For 2.6 million ballots, she said: We 
are not going to follow the law. 
Pennsylvania law says mail-in bal-
lots can’t be processed until election 
day, but some county commissioner 
said no and allowed ballots to be cured, 
to be fixed, to be changed before elec-
tion day. You can imagine which coun-
ties allowed that, you can just imag-
ine. Democrat counties allowed it; Re-
publican counties didn’t. 
The legislature determines the time, 
place, and manner of elections, not 
State supreme courts, not secretaries 
of states, not county commissioners. 
All of those entities took actions that 
directly violated the law, the law that 
State legislatures enacted, and thereby 
violated the Constitution. 
But Democrats don’t care. They 
don’t want to look into it. They would 
rather just belittle 60 million of our 
fellow citizens, call them names, say it 
is a conspiracy, make fun of the very 
people we are all supposed to represent. 
Well, guess what. Tomorrow, those 
people will get a chance to hear the 
truth. Tomorrow, those 60 million peo-
ple, those 80 million people who have 
their doubts, will not be treated with 
disrespect; they will be treated with 
the respect they deserve. 
Tomorrow, there will be a debate in 
the people’s House. Tomorrow, the 
Constitution will be defended, and the 
American people will see the truth. 
They will see how Democrats changed 
the rules in the days and weeks leading 
up to the election and created chaos in 
our election process. Tomorrow, they 
will see what the late Justice Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg said: The ultimate date 
of significance is January 6. Tomorrow, 
the citizens of this great country will 
see why.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H69 
January 5, 2021 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Representatives 
COMER and KHANNA for their work on 
this bipartisan bill, and I thank Sen-
ators PORTMAN and PETERS for their 
work on last year’s Senate companion. 
This measure would correct a provi-
sion of the Consolidated Appropria-
tions Act for fiscal year 2021 that was 
incorrectly inserted into the law. 
The language of this bill had been 
carefully crafted by the House Over-
sight and Reform Committee and the 
Senate Committee on Homeland Secu-
rity and Governmental Affairs over 
many months prior to the agreement 
to include it in last year’s Consolidated 
Appropriations Act. The bill you see 
before you today honors that agree-
ment and resolves the drafting error. 
The bill would prohibit the use of re-
verse auctions for the procurement of 
complex, specialized, or substantial de-
sign and construction services procured 
by the Federal Government. 
Such services would include site 
planning, architectural and engineer-
ing services, interior design, construc-
tion or substantial alteration of public 
buildings or public works, and substan-
tial construction work for facility, in-
frastructure, and environmental res-
toration projects. 
Reverse auctions are generally a val-
uable tool to ensure the responsible 
stewardship 
of 
taxpayer 
dollars 
through the acquisition process. 
b 1245 
In a reverse auction, a buyer seeking 
a good or service—in this case the Fed-
eral Government—solicits bids. Mul-
tiple sellers offer bids and the seller 
with the lowest bid wins the competi-
tion. 
However, in the specific instance of 
complex, specialized, or substantial de-
sign and construction services, the use 
of reverse auctions can be problematic. 
While the lowest price is often the goal 
for standardized goods and services, it 
is not the only factor that should be 
considered for these unique projects. 
Quality is also an important evalua-
tion factor, especially for complex 
services, like design-build contracts for 
major public buildings or works. 
This bill would not prevent con-
tracting officers from considering price 
in evaluating proposals for complex 
construction services, just the use of 
reverse auctions designed to achieve 
the lowest price without regard to 
quality. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to sup-
port this bill, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
26, the Construction Consensus Pro-
curement Improvement Act of 2021. 
This bill would prohibit the Federal 
Government’s use of reverse auctions 
for complex design and construction 
services. A reverse auction is one 
where the sellers bid down the price in-
stead of the buyers driving up the 
price. Most often, the contractor with 
the lowest bid wins the contract. While 
we all wish for the Federal Government 
to get the lowest price, it is important 
that these complex projects are done 
properly, on time, and on budget. 
Reverse auctions are not always ap-
propriate for the types of services this 
bill deals with because design-build or 
complex construction projects often 
have variables which cannot be con-
templated during the original bidding 
process. 
The use of reverse auctions can often 
result in products that are subpar and, 
ultimately, over budget. Often, the 
winning low bid is nowhere near the 
final cost to the government after un-
anticipated factors lead to time and 
budget overruns. 
Specifically, the Office of Federal 
Procurement Policy found that, for 
complex design and construction con-
tracts, the expertise required to com-
plete these projects was not built in to 
reverse auction bids. 
Construction projects have a high de-
gree of variability and the reverse auc-
tion process often does not yield the 
low costs intended for the taxpayer. 
This legislation is tailored to ensure 
that products and services which do 
not benefit from the reverse auction 
process will not be affected. 
Going forward, we must continue to 
fight for the best possible products at 
the best price to the taxpayer. That in-
cludes ensuring benefits are brought to 
our constituents on time and on budg-
et. This legislation will help to achieve 
that. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, 
Representative RO
KHANNA, for his 
work and support on this legislation. I 
urge my colleagues to support the bill, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Ken-
tucky (Mr. COMER). 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of my bill, H.R. 26, the 
Construction Consensus Procurement 
Improvement Act of 2021. 
It is vitally important that the Fed-
eral Government procure complex de-
sign and construction services that re-
main on time and on budget. This bill 
would prevent the Federal reverse auc-
tions procurement process from being 
used for complex projects. Using re-
verse auctions for major construction 
projects only causes problems, such as 
delays and wasteful spending. 
Who pays the price? 
The taxpayer. 
The Federal Government must be 
good stewards of taxpayer dollars and 
get the best possible services for the 
best price. As ranking member of the 
Committee on Oversight and Reform, I 
want to continue to deliver savings to 
the taxpayer and make stakeholder 
interaction with the government much 
easier, and H.R. 26 does just that. 
This bill is the result of strong bipar-
tisan, bicameral negotiations and the 
hard work of many private sector 
groups. I thank Senator PORTMAN for 
his hard work on this legislation last 
Congress. I am also thankful for the 
support of my Committee on Oversight 
and Reform colleague, Mr. KHANNA. 
Mr. Speaker, I would also like to par-
ticularly thank the Construction In-
dustry Procurement Coalition, the As-
sociation of General Contractors, the 
Design-Build Institute of America, the 
American Subcontractors Association, 
and numerous others for their hard 
work on this legislation. 
I look forward to continuing to work 
with the majority to advance common-
sense legislation to make government 
more efficient and effective. I encour-
age the Senate to quickly consider this 
bill and send it to the President’s desk. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my House col-
leagues to support H.R. 26. 
Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a sensible and 
needed bipartisan reform. I am hopeful 
to see similar bipartisan procurement 
reform bills this Congress, and I urge 
my colleagues to support this legisla-
tion. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of 
H.R. 26, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. 
CAROLYN B. MALONEY) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 26. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New

consent that all Members have 5 legis-

dates on which the settlement agree-
ments were agreed to. 
The information about the settle-
ment agreements would remain public 
until 5 years after the termination of 
the agreements. The information in the 
agreements would remain subject to 
the Freedom of Information Act; but if 
the head of the agency decided to keep 
an entire agreement confidential, he or 
she would be required to provide an ex-
planation of that action. 
This bill would improve the trans-
parency surrounding settlement agree-
ments, which in the past have been dif-
ficult for the public to access. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
27, the Settlement Agreement Informa-
tion Database Act. Transparency and 
public participation are vital to ensure 
the public’s continued trust in our gov-
ernment. Increasingly, Federal agen-
cies are using legally binding settle-
ment agreements to resolve litigation 
without going through lengthy public 
trials. 
However, it is impossible for Con-
gress and the public to determine the 
comprehensive impact of these settle-
ment agreements on the State and 
local governments and private sector 
entities, which must continue to follow 
the mandated requirements. Such se-
cret negotiations and agreements es-
sentially prevent the public from par-
ticipating in important policy deci-
sions. 
The burden of Federal settlement 
agreements can be difficult to see and 
understand, but State and local gov-
ernments, industry stakeholders, and 
taxpayers can be directly affected by 
the settlements for years, and yet they 
are unable to provide input. This legis-
lation seeks to correct that problem. 
The Settlement Agreement Informa-
tion Database Act, or SAID Act, re-
quires Federal agencies to submit in-
formation regarding consent decrees 
and settlement agreements to a public 
electronic database. This public re-
source, to be overseen by the Office of 
Management and Budget, would in-
clude dates, payments, attorney fees 
awards, and a list of State and local 
governments and entities impacted by 
the settlement. 
Currently, agencies release informa-
tion about settlements at their discre-
tion and will only publicize the facts 
that reflect favorably upon the agency. 
Furthermore, the terms of settlement 
agreements are often deemed confiden-
tial. 
Under the requirements of the SAID 
Act, if the agency believes that the in-
formation 
regarding 
an 
agreement 
should remain confidential, the agency 
head must publish an explanation of 
why it is confidential. This will in-
crease the transparency of the Federal 
Government and shine a much-needed 
light on settlement agreements. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues, 
Representatives JIM
COOPER, GERRY 
CONNOLLY, and VAN TAYLOR, for sup-
porting this important legislation. I 
am happy we could expedite its consid-
eration again in the House after pass-
ing this bill unanimously in the 116th 
Congress. I thank the chairman for 
bringing this bill and making it part of 
this first legislative day package. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to support this 
commonsense legislation, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman 
has no further speakers, I am prepared 
to close, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, I hope we 
can continue to find bipartisan ways to 
increase transparency of the Federal 
Government. I strongly urge my col-
leagues to support this commonsense 
legislation, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of 
H.R. 27. I am strongly in support of this 
bipartisan legislation, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The

HONORING THE SERVICE OF 
DAVID TWA 
HON. MARK DeSAULNIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 5, 2021 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today with Congressman MIKE
THOMPSON, 
Congressman JERRY MCNERNEY, and Con-
gressman ERIC SWALWELL to recognize the 
service of an esteemed leader in Contra Costa 
County, David Twa. 
David began his career as a public servant 
in Minnesota where he served as a county 
manager and county attorney. With significant 
experience under his belt, David moved to 
California and was appointed as the Contra 
Costa County Administrator in 2008. In this 
role, David has managed 24 departments, 
agencies, and special districts; over 10,000 
employees; and a multibillion-dollar budget. 
During his tenure as County Administrator, 
David worked to implement the County’s goals 
and improve the lives of its residents. One of 
David’s many accomplishments is helping the 
County achieve a AAA bond rating from 
Standard and Poor’s in 2013. David’s legacy 
extends beyond his job description. He was 
dedicated to career development for County 
staff and worked to create leadership opportu-
nities for employees, including helping estab-
lish the Contra Costa Local Government Lead-
ership Academy in 2014. Throughout his many 
years with Contra Costa County, David has in-
spired his colleagues and peers to continue 
working to improve our community. In 2018, 
David won the Distinguished Service Award 
from the California Association of County Ex-
ecutives, a testament to his career and serv-
ice. 
David is known by his colleagues as a dedi-
cated and respected leader. Please join me 
and Congressman MIKE THOMPSON, Congress-
man JERRY
MCNERNEY, and Congressman 
ERIC SWALWELL in thanking David for his serv-
ice to our County and wishing him the best in 
his retirement.

HONORING THE LIFE OF THE 
HONORABLE MARK MYERS 
HON. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 5, 2021 
Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise to 
honor the life of former City of Weston Com-
missioner, Mark Myers. 
I was heartbroken to learn of his passing 
and join my community in celebrating his life. 
Commissioner Myers was one of the original 
founders of my hometown of Weston, FL, 
serving on the first City Commission in 1997. 
In November 1991, Mr. Myers was elected to 
serve as Treasurer on the Board of Super-
visors, the panel that helped to incorporate the 
City of Weston in 1996. His life is part of the 
fabric of our South Florida history, and we are 
grateful for his service. 
Mark always emphasized supporting our 
community’s young people as well as improv-
ing access to the arts. He was instrumental in 
expanding cultural and economic opportunities 
for a new community and even helped design 
the City of Weston seal. Mr. Myers was an 
avid art collector and advocate supporting nu-
merous organizations whose work helped im-
prove our surroundings. 
Commissioner Myers was a graduate of 
Cornell University and also served our nation 
with distinction as a pilot in the U.S. Air Force. 
I join Mark’s children, grandchildren, great 
grandchildren, and my friends and neighbors 
in mourning the loss of an incredible advocate, 
visionary, and devoted public servant. May his 
memory be a blessing.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF DOCK 
GABBERT 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 5, 2021 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life of Dock 
Gabbert who passed away on December 30. 
Dock dedicated his life to serving the people 
of Mississippi and his legacy will be long re-
membered. 
Born on July 30, 1942 in Banner, MS to 
Dock and Rena Gabbert, Dock went on to 
graduate from Bruce High School. In 1960, he 
married Gloria Kay Ramage and spent 25 
years with Willis Engineering. He also served 
in the Mississippi Army National Guard. Dock 
was known for his deep love for the outdoors. 
He went on hunting trips with friends that took 
him across the country. He could often be 
found fishing or working in his yard. His love 
for his community was at the forefront of all he 
did. 
Dock began his career in public service in 
1967 on the Derma Board of Alderman. In 
1969, he was elected mayor of Derma, where 
he ultimately served 51 years making him Mis-
sissippi’s longest serving mayor. He won 14 
elections, one by only a two-vote margin. He 
took pride in his contributions to the city infra-
structure and his part in making Denna an en-
joyable city to live in. His tenure allowed con-
tinuity in local projects and his impact on the 
quality of life in Derma will endure. 
Dock Gabbert was an outstanding Mississip-
pian who exemplified a commitment to public 
service. He dedicated his life to making life 
better for his community. I am grateful for men 
like Dock who so humbly served our great 
state, and my deepest condolences are with 
those who loved him. 
STEM OPPORTUNITIES ACT 
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 5, 2021 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
today I am pleased to be joined by Ranking 
Member LUCAS in introducing the STEM Op-
portunities Act. 
The need for full engagement in science, 
technology, engineering, and mathematics 
(STEM) by women and other underrep-
resented groups goes beyond enabling individ-
uals to fulfill their dreams of becoming a sci-
entist. As the global competition in science 
and technology continues to intensify, the lack 
of diversity in the U.S. STEM workforce cre-
ates a significant drag on our own capacity to 
innovate. Our future prosperity depends on 
what we do now to nurture the STEM talent 
that will be necessary to keep pace with our 
competitors and deliver benefits to all Ameri-
cans. 
Study after study has shown that the under-
representation of women, and racial and eth-
nic minorities is not attributable to a lack of in-
terest or talent. Institutional and cultural bar-
riers, including discrimination, harassment, un-
conscious bias in hiring and promotion, limited 
access to the internet, poor mentoring, and 
limited support networks serve to disadvan-
tage, marginalize, and push talented individ-
uals at all education and career levels to 
abandon their interest in pursuing STEM ca-
reers. Unfortunately, the COVID–19 crisis has 
only exacerbated these challenges. 
The goal of the STEM Opportunities Act is 
to develop and implement evidence-based 
policies to promote the advancement of 
women, minorities, and other groups under-
represented in STEM studies and research ca-
reers. This bill is focused on identifying and 
lowering barriers for those who have already 
chosen a STEM path. First, so that we better 
understand the nature and scope of the chal-
lenges, the STEM Opportunities Act requires 
more comprehensive demographic data collec-
tion on the recipients of federal research 
awards and on STEM faculty at U.S. univer-
sities. These data would be available to re-
searchers to study the participation and trajec-
tories of women and underrepresented minori-
ties in STEM so that policy makers can design 
more effective policies and practices to reduce 
barriers. 
Next, this bill requires the development of 
consistent federal policies, such as no-cost 
award extensions, for recipients of federal re-
search awards who have caregiving respon-
sibilities, including care for a newborn or newly 
adopted child and care for a sick family mem-
ber. The bill also requires consistent federal 
guidance to grant reviewers and program offi-
cers on best practices to minimize the effects 
of implicit bias in the review of federal re-
search grants. It requires OSTP to develop 
guidance for universities and Federal labora-
tories to aid them in identifying any cultural

and institutional barriers limiting the recruit-
ment, retention, and achievement of women, 
minorities, rural students, and other underrep-
resented groups in academic and government 
STEM research careers and in developing and 
implementing current best practices for reduc-
ing such barriers. Finally, the legislation au-
thorizes NSF to award grants to universities to 
implement or expand research-based prac-
tices targeted specifically at increasing the re-
cruitment and retention of minority students 
and faculty. 
The STEM Opportunities Act has been a 
priority of mine for well over a decade. Every 
Congress since 2007 I have worked to raise 
awareness among my colleagues about the 
urgent challenges this bill addresses. While 
we were successful in passing this bill out of 
the House last year, we have yet to garner the 
necessary support to advance this bill in the 
Senate. I am hopeful that this year will be dif-
ferent. I am honored to be joined by my good 
friend, Ranking Member LUCAS, again in this 
effort and I look forward to working with my 
colleagues in the Senate to get this bill to the 
President’s desk. 
I want to thank Ranking Member LUCAS for 
his 
continued 
partnership 
in 
advancing 
thoughtful solutions to the challenges we face 
in maintaining our standing as the global lead-
er in science and innovation. The STEM work-
force is the bedrock of this effort and, in the 
wake of the COVID–19 crisis, the need to act 
is more urgent than ever. I encourage the rest 
of our colleagues to join us and to help us 
move this bill forward into law.

IN RECOGNITION OF DANIEL 
PALETKO 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 5, 2021 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
acknowledge the legacy of public service and 
commitment to our communities of the late 
Mayor of Dearborn Heights, Michigan, Daniel 
Paletko. 
Dan Paletko served as mayor of Dearborn 
Heights from 2004 until his death in 2020. 
Paletko served one term as a Michigan State 
Representative and more than two decades as 
a Dearborn Heights City Councilman. He 
prioritized making Dearborn Heights a wel-
coming place for all its residents to call home 
and was especially proud of the city’s rich cul-
tural diversity and recreational resources. His 
pride in Dearborn Heights was evident in his 
dedication. 
Beyond his public service, Mr. Paletko vol-
unteered his time to many community-based 
organizations. He was particularly involved 
with his church community at St. Linus 
Church, where he served as an usher. He 
also proudly gave his time to Volunteer In-
come Tax Assistance (VITA) programs and to 
the American Legion. 
Please join me as we recognize Mayor Dan-
iel Paletko’s many contributions to the families 
of Dearborn Heights and the 13th Congres-
sional District as we give honor to his mem-
ory. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF FIRST 
LIEUTENANT JAMES B. MILLER 
HON. TOM RICE 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 5, 2021 
Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor the life of First Lieu-
tenant James B. Miller of Marion, South Caro-
lina. 
First Lieutenant Miller honorably served his 
country in the Army during the Korean War. 
He was awarded the Purple Heart twice while 
serving with the 179th Infantry Regiment, 45th 
Infantry Division in Korea. He was seriously 
wounded by enemy fire in North Korea on 
March 6, 1953. First Lieutenant Miller returned 
to duty only a week later. On July 26, 1953, 
First Lieutenant Miller was tragically killed in 
action while fighting the enemy in North 
Korea. 
Madam Speaker, I join his family and 
friends in recognizing the life of First Lieuten-
ant James B. Miller of Marion, South Carolina. 
We honor him and thank him for his service 
and sacrifice for our nation.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF 
QUTHEL MCNATT 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 5, 2021 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life of Quthel 
McNatt of Tishomingo who passed away De-
cember 14 at North Mississippi Medical Center 
in Tupelo. 
Mr. McNatt was a beacon of kindess and 
generosity to all who had the opportunity to 
know him. He served as a Deacon at 
Tishomingo Baptist Church. In his free time, 
Mr. McNatt enjoyed fishing, hunting, and 
spending time with family and friends. He was 
a member of IBEW Local 474. From 1989 to 
1993 Quthel McNatt served as the mayor of 
Tishomingo. 
Left to cherish his memory are his wife of 
67 years, Sara Haines McNatt; sons, Edward, 
Wesley, and Joshua; and grandchildren, gage, 
Brady, Belle, Karmen, and Maddyx. 
Quthel McNatt was a man of faith and a 
servant to family, state, and country. He was 
a blessing to those who knew him and an out-
standing Mississippian.

DEDICATED PATRIOTS IN 
WASHINGTON 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 5, 2021 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, thousands of dedicated patriots will 
be in Washington tomorrow to Stop The Steal 
peacefully protesting the irregularities of the 
2020 election. I will welcome the Stedmans of 
New Jersey, the Durhams of South Carolina, 
and the Carons of Florida. They are already 
winners with Republican gains in Congress 
with 19 additional Republican women, and all 
Republican House incumbents re-elected as 
15 incumbent Democrats lost, and The Epoch 
Times, December 2nd by Pete Svab high-
lighted Republican gains in the state legisla-
tures: 
‘‘Republicans expanded their control of 
state legislatures in the 2020 election, flip-
ping both chambers in one state while gain-
ing more than 160 seats overall.’’ 
‘‘Their lead over Democrats thus increased 
to more than 700 seats (about 67 percent) 
from over 400.’’ 
‘‘The 2020 gains bring the GOP to a total of 
more than 4,000 seats.’’ 
‘‘The balance of power has major con-
sequences. States decide much of the policy 
that affects people’s daily lives, in areas 
such as education, law enforcement, health 
care, housing, and infrastructure.’’ 
I especially appreciate in South Carolina the 
leadership of President Donald Trump has 
produced the largest Republican majorities in 
140 years at all levels of government. 
In conclusion, God Bless our Troops and we 
will never forget September 11th in the Global 
War on Terrorism.

HONORING REV. JAMES C. 
BIRDSONG, JR. 
HON. DAVID SCOTT 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 5, 2021 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor an extraordinary 
Georgian and a great American, Reverend 
James C. Birdsong, Jr. 
Rev. Birdsong is a multi-talented preacher, 
gospel musician, nationally published author, 
motivational 
speaker, 
and 
entrepreneur. 
Through 
his 
faith-based 
outreach, 
Rev. 
Birdsong has reached thousands of Georgians 
with his message of perseverance and trust in 
God’s plan. 
Rev. Birdsong was born into a family of tal-
ented artists in Richmond, California. From a 
young age, he knew that his mission in life 
was to share the word of God with others. 
Rev. Birdsong exhibited courage and resil-
ience in overcoming a developmental disability 
to pursue his goals and further his education, 
culminating in a degree in Biblical Education 
from Beulah Heights University in Atlanta. 
In recent years, Reverend Birdsong has 
kept busy, conducting numerous media inter-
views, accepting awards across the country, 
authoring a moving autobiography, and con-
tinuing to preach the gospel. He remains 
deeply involved in his community, founding the 
Birdsong Association of Broadcasting and 
Arts, to provide young voices with the platform 
and guidance to refine their talents and follow 
their dreams. He has further helped young 
Georgians to find their path in life through his 
continued youth advocacy efforts, leaving a 
positive impact on so many young people. 
Madam Speaker, I congratulate Reverend 
Birdsong on his impactful career, and extend 
my sincerest wishes for his continued health 
and success, as he inspires people across the 
United States. 
May God continue to bless Reverend James 
C. Birdsong, Jr.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF NOLAN 
METTETAL 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 5, 2021 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life of Nolan 
Mettetal who passed away Monday, Decem-
ber 28, 2020 at the age of 75. As a fellow leg-
islator, I am grateful for Mr. Mettetal’s dedica-
tion to family, state, and country. 
Mr. Mettetal was born on November 19, 
1945 in Baton Rouge, Louisiana to Wayne 
and Georgia Mettetal. He began his career as 
a registered pharmacist, but soon realized his 
gift for public service when he ran for Mis-
sissippi legislature. Mr. Mettetal served as 
Mississippi District 10’s representative, serving 
constituents across Panola, Lafayette and 
Tallahatchie Counties. He handily won two 
elections for this seat and enjoyed meaningful 
relationships with members and staff at the 
Mississippi Capitol. Mr. Mettetal also valued 
his free time with his wife, affectionately 
known by their community as ‘‘Mrs. Kay.’’ The 
two took daily walks around Sardis Lake 
where he enjoyed watching for hummingbirds 
and feeding the deer. 
Nolan Mettetal is survived by his wife, Kay 
Ford Mettetal; daughter, Kim; son, Carey; and 
five grandchildren, gracie, Julien, Nolan, Ade-
laide and Sadie. 
Nolan Mettetal was a light unto all who had 
the opportunity to know and love him, and he 
will be deeply missed. My deepest condo-
lences are with his family and friends.
