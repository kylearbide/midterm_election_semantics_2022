Vol. 167 
WASHINGTON, WEDNESDAY, JULY 28, 2021 
No. 132 
House of Representatives 
The House met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Speaker. 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Almighty God, in these halls of 
power, where decisions change lives 
and shape national policy, we pause to 
acknowledge Your sovereignty over us 
and over our Nation. 
In Your infinite mercy, You have laid 
on the shoulders of these lawmakers 
the mantle of Your own authority, and 
we pray for both the wisdom and the 
humility to wield it carefully. 
When they are inclined, as we all are, 
to take sole credit for the achieve-
ments You have orchestrated, call 
them away to a quiet place, away from 
the enticement of the world’s approba-
tion, and reveal to them Your involve-
ment in their activities and inspire in 
them again their call to servant leader-
ship. 
When any of us are hesitant to use 
the positions and the possibilities You 
lay before us, we pray Your blessing 
over even the most meager of our gifts. 
Multiply their impact exponentially. 
May they be sufficient to meet the 
needs of the people and the country 
You have given us opportunity to 
serve. 
God, You did not give us a spirit of 
fear—or of pride—but of power derived 
from Your own love for all of creation. 
Give us also spirits of love and self- 
control that on this day we would live 
faithfully into Your gracious plan. 
In the strength of Your name we 
pray. 
Amen.

THE JOURNAL 
The SPEAKER. Pursuant to section 
11(a) of House Resolution 188, the Jour-
nal of the last day’s proceedings is ap-
proved. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman 
from New York (Mr. MORELLE) come 
forward and lead the House in the 
Pledge of Allegiance. 
Mr. MORELLE led the Pledge of Alle-
giance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
The SPEAKER. The Chair will take 
this occasion to update her announced 
policies of January 4, 2021, regarding 
the requirement to wear masks in the 
Hall 
of 
the 
House 
during 
the 
coronavirus crisis. 
Consistent with the newly updated 
guidance from the Office of the Attend-
ing Physician related to the increased 
threat from the delta variant of the 
virus, the Chair wishes to inform all 
Members and staff that masks will 
once again be required in the Hall of 
the House. However, Members will be 
permitted to remove their masks tem-
porarily while under recognition. 
To be clear, Members and staff must 
wear masks in the Hall of the House at 
all times except that a Member may 
remove his or her mask when recog-
nized by the Chair. In addition, Mem-
bers presiding as Chair may remove 
their mask when speaking. 
This announcement is incorporated 
within the policy on conduct during a 
covered period of January 4, 2021, and 
supersedes any other announced policy 
that is in conflict. The Sergeant at 
Arms is directed to enforce mask re-
quirements consistent with this an-
nouncement. Members are reminded 
that under House Resolution 38, the 
Sergeant at Arms is authorized and di-
rected to impose a fine against any 
Member acting in violation of this pol-
icy. 
The Chair appreciates the continued 
attention of all Members and staff to 
these health and safety protocols, par-
ticularly in this changing health envi-
ronment. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
The SPEAKER. The Chair will enter-
tain up to 15 requests for 1-minute 
speeches on each side of the aisle. 
f 
HOT FERC SUMMER 
(Mr. CASTEN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CASTEN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to continue our celebration of Hot 
FERC summer. As climate activist 
Fergie would certainly say: The FERC- 
alicious definition is to make our plan-
et cooler. 
So listen up, y’all, ‘cause this is it. 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Com-
mission, or better known as the F to 
the E to the R to the C, is one of the 
most important Federal agencies to 
fight climate change. And if I am doing 
this right, one that a few more of you 
are now keeping tabs on. 
Having a well air-conditioned home 
when 
it 
is 
‘‘hot-hot’’? 
That 
is 
FERCalicious. 
Getting your electricity from the 
lowest 
cost 
reliable 
source? 
FERCalicious. 
An electric transmission system that 
keeps everything from electric vehicles 
to steel mills running with zero carbon 
electricity? FERCalicious. 
With record-setting heat waves al-
ready 
causing 
deadly 
droughts, 
wildfires, 
and 
overwhelmed 
power 
grids, we have run out the clock and 
must transition to a clean energy econ-
omy—and we need FERC’s help. 
So, today, I am proud to introduce 
the Right to Timely Rehearings at 
FERC 
Act 
with 
my 
friend, 
Mr. 
MALINOWSKI, a bill to ensure everyone 
has access to fair and timely hearings 
at the Commission.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4094 
July 28, 2021 
But Congress can’t do this alone. 
Moving at the pace demanded by the 
climate crisis will take all hands on 
deck. And a fully staffed FERC is going 
to be critical to that success. 
Mr. Speaker, I will now go work on 
my fitness. 
f 
BUDGET MUST INCLUDE HYDE 
AMENDMENT 
(Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in strong support 
of the nearly 2.5 million children whose 
lives have been saved by the Hyde 
amendment. 
This landmark legislation has been a 
part of every budget in Congress that 
we have passed since 1976. Now, this 
amendment is threatened by liberals in 
Congress who want to force taxpayers 
to pay for abortions. This is wrong. 
As a doctor, I know that the dignity 
of life is a fundamental truth. To turn 
our backs on this amendment would 
not only subvert the will of the Amer-
ican people, it will cost lives. 
By eliminating the Hyde amendment, 
Democrats want to expand unlimited 
access to abortion services at tax-
payers’ expense. Any budget that we 
pass must include the Hyde amend-
ment. 
f 
RECOGNIZING 
MINNESOTA 
FARM 
BUREAU 
FEDERATION’S 
KEVIN 
PAAP 
(Mr. EMMER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Minnesota Farm 
Bureau Federation President Kevin 
Paap, who will be retiring in Novem-
ber. 
Kevin has been president of the Min-
nesota Farm Bureau for 16 years, dur-
ing which time I and my team have 
been fortunate enough to work with 
him very closely on many occasions. 
In addition to being a selfless servant 
leader, Kevin Paap walks the walk. He 
and his wife, Julie, own and operate a 
fourth-generation family farm in Blue 
Earth County, Minnesota, where they 
grow corn and soybeans. 
Whenever I speak to Kevin, I am im-
pressed by his commitment and focus 
to improving the lives of Minnesota’s 
farmers and advancing American agri-
culture. He has been the advocate that 
our State’s farm and ranch community 
deserves, and we will be forever grate-
ful for his work. 
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Kevin on 
his well-earned retirement. I look for-
ward to seeing him and his family 
again soon. 
f 
PAYING TRIBUTE TO MARGIE RICE 
(Mrs. STEEL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. STEEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to a well-known 
figure in our Orange County commu-
nity, Margie Rice. 
Rice served on the Westminster City 
Council for 22 years and as mayor of 
Westminster for 12 of those years. Be-
fore that, she served as a member of 
the Westminster School District Board 
of Trustees for 171⁄2 years. 
She dedicated her time to making 
life better for those she served and was 
an outspoken force in our community. 
A cornerstone of her legacy is the Rose 
Center Theater in Westminster, which 
she spearheaded and secured funding 
for. 
Rice is survived by two of her four 
children, 19 grandchildren, 23 great- 
grandchildren, 
and 
12 
great-great- 
grandchildren. 
Margie Rice was a leader in West-
minster for more than six decades, and 
she will be so missed by family, friends, 
and our community. 
f 
REJECTING MINORITY MEMBERS 
FOR SELECT COMMITTEE 
(Mr. NEHLS asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. NEHLS. Mr. Speaker, 1 week ago 
today, Speaker PELOSI made history. 
For the first time in more than 230 
years of the United States House of 
Representatives, the Speaker of the 
House rejected the minority party’s 
picks for a select committee. 
This House has seen partisan fights. 
This House has seen turmoil. This 
House has seen deep division. But never 
in the history of its existence has it 
seen a Speaker reject the minority’s 
picks for a select committee until 
Speaker PELOSI. 
Her historic move cemented the Jan-
uary 6th Select Committee as com-
pletely partisan from top to bottom. 
Every committee member was hand-
picked by Speaker PELOSI for a specific 
purpose. And we know what that pur-
pose is: to push her narrative and her 
agenda. 
Despite Speaker PELOSI’s attempts to 
obstruct the truth, Republicans will 
continue our own investigation and fol-
low the facts where they take us be-
cause we owe it to the American people 
to ensure this never happens again. 
f 
b 1015 
CRIME RISING ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I no-
ticed this morning that in the last 
week there were a couple more homi-
cides in the city of my birth, Mil-
waukee, Wisconsin. Milwaukee right 
now is on pace to exceed the record 
number of homicides they had last 
year. This did not happen in a vacuum. 
There are some people who blame 
guns, but other crimes are up as well, 
which shows guns have nothing to do 
with it. The reason is that law enforce-
ment is under attack and has been pas-
sive, not only in Milwaukee, but in 
Chicago, in Baltimore, in Philadelphia, 
and Washington. 
And why are they passive? Because 
politicians in this Chamber and politi-
cians around the country have tried to 
blame the police for incarceration 
rather than blame the criminal. And as 
a result, police are scared to act, afraid 
to be aggressive, and we have murder 
rates higher than we have seen in quite 
a while, and we recently hit 90,000 
deaths a year from illegal drug use. 
These additional deaths, to me, the 
blood is on the people who ignore the 
studies that show that police are not 
racist and continue to push the police 
into a more passive fashion. We must 
stop this cheap politicking. 
f 
HONORING BOB GASTONGUAY 
(Mr. AMODEI asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. AMODEI. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the career of Bob 
Gastonguay, who has been with my of-
fice since I was elected in 2011. 
Prior to his first retirement, Bob had 
a long and successful career in tele-
communications as the executive di-
rector of the Nevada State Cable Tele-
communications Association. 
Why did he come out of retirement? 
He wanted a Federal job. 
No matter the difficulties that came 
with serving as the face of my front of-
fice, Bob has been the perfect person to 
greet people or take their calls. He 
greets everyone with a warm welcome, 
and shows them respect, and makes 
them feel heard. 
As a new member of the octogenarian 
club, Bob hasn’t let his age slow him 
down. He is always the first one in, 
constantly on the move, and always 
striking up a conversation with whom-
ever he meets. 
In addition to his long career, Bob 
raised a family of two sons, a grand-
daughter, 
and 
three 
great-grand-
children with his loving wife of 60 
years, Barbara. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Bob for his 
service to Nevada and to the country. 
f 
HONORING THE CAREER AND 
LEADERSHIP OF NANCY NORR 
(Mr. STAUBER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to thank Nancy Norr for the in-
credible work she has done on behalf of 
northern Minnesota, and to congratu-
late her on a well-deserved retirement. 
In addition to the 30-plus years that 
Nancy has spent at Minnesota Power, 
she has taken leadership roles in a va-
riety of organizations throughout the 
Northland. 
Most notably, Nancy led Jobs for 
Minnesotans, a group that advocates

for job creation and investment in our 
State. 
In Minnesota’s Eighth Congressional 
District, we have rich deposits of crit-
ical minerals, along with other great 
projects, like the Line 3 Replacement 
Project. 
Nancy has long understood what 
these opportunities could mean for our 
region and spearheaded this locally- 
driven movement to fight for good-pay-
ing mining and energy jobs. Through 
her exceptional work and advocacy, 
Nancy has helped to make great 
progress in our local communities. 
Since arriving in Congress, it has 
been my pleasure to work alongside 
Nancy to unleash the economic engine 
in Minnesota’s Eighth Congressional 
District. 
She has served as an incredible re-
source to me, and while I will miss her 
expertise and leadership, I wish her 
nothing but the best in this next chap-
ter of her life.

REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 18, NO 
TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABOR-
TION ACT 
(Mrs. BOEBERT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to speak in defense of those who cannot 
defend themselves, the voiceless, the 
unborn. 
I rise to say what we all know to be 
true, that human life begins at concep-
tion, because we know science is real. 
The more than 60 million babies that 
have been ripped from their mother’s 
womb since Roe v. Wade were no less 
valuable or worthy of life than any of 
us here today. No taxpayer should ever 
be forced to pay for abortion. 
Abortion is not healthcare, it is mur-
der. I will not stand by quietly. I say 
Planned Parenthood can go fund them-
selves. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Committees on Energy 
and Commerce, Ways and Means, and 
the Judiciary be discharged from fur-
ther consideration of H.R. 18, No Tax-
payer Funding for Abortion Act, and 
ask for its immediate consideration in 
the House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
CUELLAR). Under guidelines consist-
ently issued by successive Speakers, as 
recorded in section 956 of the House 
Rules and Manual, the Chair is con-
strained not to entertain the request 
unless it has been cleared by the bipar-
tisan floor and committee leaderships. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF CHARLES 
ROSE 
(Mr. BURCHETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Charles Rose, 
a good friend of mine. He was a brave 
veteran who passed away on July 24 at 
97 years old. 
Charles was a corporal in the United 
States Marine Corps during World War 
II. He fought in the Battles of Tarawa, 
Saipan, and Tinian in the Pacific, and 
was awarded a Bronze Star with valor 
for his bravery. 
In 1953, Charles married the love of 
his life, Jane, and they had four sons: 
Steve, Tim, Mark, and Dennis. 
I was honored to speak about Steve 
on the House floor a few months ago 
after he passed away. He was a great 
veteran, just like his dad. 
Charles also had 12 grandchildren and 
28 great-grandchildren, who loved him 
dearly, and they were his pride and joy. 
Charles worked hard all his life. In 
1969, he decided to go into business for 
himself. He founded his own septic 
tank business where the motto is ‘‘A 
Flush Beats a Full House Every Time.’’ 
It is still going strong today, being run 
by his sons and grandsons. He also be-
came a Baptist minister and inspired 
everyone he knew with his love for the 
Lord. 
Charles always used to say, ‘‘plain 
talk is easy understood.’’ He hit me 
with that nugget of wisdom several 
times, and I won’t forget it. It was an 
honor to call him my friend, and he 
will be missed by those who knew him. 
Rest in peace, brother.

Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, for the 
purpose of debate only, I yield the cus-
tomary 30 minutes to my friend and 
colleague 
from 
the 
Committee 
on 
Rules, the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania (Mr. RESCHENTHALER), pending 
which I yield myself such time as I

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
be given 5 legislative days to revise and 
extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, this 
morning, the Committee on Rules met 
and reported a rule, House Resolution 
567. The rule provides for consideration 
of H.R. 4346, the Legislative Branch Ap-
propriations Act, under a structured 
rule. The rule provides 1 hour of debate 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of 
the Committee on Appropriations or 
their designees. 
The rule self-executes a manager’s 
amendment 
from 
Chairman 
RYAN, 
makes in order 12 amendments, pro-
vides en bloc authority for Chair-
woman DELAURO or her designee, and 
provides one motion to recommit. 
The rule also provides for consider-
ation H.R. 4373, the Department of 
State, Foreign Operations, and Related 
Programs Appropriations Act, under a 
structured rule. The rule provides 1 
hour of debate equally divided and con-
trolled by the chair and ranking minor-
ity member of the Committee on Ap-
propriations or their designees. 
The rule self-executes a manager’s 
amendment from Chairwoman LEE, 
makes in order 36 amendments, pro-
vides en bloc authority for Chair-
woman DELAURO or her designee, and 
provides one motion to recommit. 
Finally, the rule provides for consid-
eration of H.R. 4505, the Commerce, 
Justice, Science, and Related Agencies 
Appropriations Act, under a structured 
rule. The rule provides 1 hour of debate 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of 
the Committee on Appropriations or 
their designees. 
It self-executes a manager’s amend-
ment 
from 
Chairman 
CARTWRIGHT, 
makes in order 61 amendments, pro-
vides en bloc authority for Chair-
woman DELAURO or her designee, and 
provides one motion to recommit. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise and 
speak in favor of critical investments 
that my colleagues on the Appropria-
tions Committee have worked tire-
lessly to secure for the American peo-
ple. First, I would like to congratulate 
Chairwoman DELAURO
on her exem-
plary leadership in bringing us a pack-
age of legislation that we can be proud 
to support and as well commend Chairs 
CARTWRIGHT, RYAN, and LEE on their 
dedication 
to 
ensuring 
America’s 
greatest needs are reflected in this 
year’s appropriations bills. 
The underlying package we are con-
sidering today includes fiscal year 2022 
funding for the Commerce, Justice, and 
Science; Legislative Branch; and State 
and Foreign Operations appropriations 
bills that invest in the future of Amer-
ica’s hardworking families and Amer-
ica’s engagement around the globe. 
These investments are more than 
just a commitment to our districts, 
they are firm action items that will 
help Americans throughout our coun-
try grow and heal as we emerge from 
this pandemic. 
The Commerce-Justice-Science bill 
supports good-paying American jobs, 
fosters groundbreaking scientific re-
search, and helps to make our commu-
nities safer. These critical programs 
include investments in economic devel-
opment in distressed communities with 
support for small businesses, including 
small- 
and 
medium-sized 
American 
manufacturers. 
This package also increases funding 
to address gender-based violence in our 
communities, supports programs to re-
duce gun violence, and helps us tackle 
the opioid crisis. 
I, for one, know that my community 
in Rochester, New York, will benefit 
greatly from the priorities secured in 
the CJS appropriations bill, and I look 
forward to delivering on our promise to 
support safer communities with fund-
ing for local law enforcement while 
bolstering police and criminal justice

reform, increasing funding for commu-
nity-based violence intervention initia-
tives, and expanding gun violence pre-
vention efforts. 
The Legislative Branch appropria-
tions bill strengthens congressional ca-
pacity to recruit a diverse and talented 
workforce while investing in efforts to 
protect our Capitol. After hearing first-
hand yesterday from the brave officers 
who protected all of us on January 6, it 
is our duty to return the favor by doing 
our job and showing full support for 
our Capitol Police force. 
The insurrection on January 6 left 
widespread physical damage to the 
Capitol Complex and emotional trauma 
for Members, congressional employees, 
and Capitol Police. This measure is es-
sential to protecting the Capitol and 
ensuring that we can continue to do 
the work of the American people. It 
provides funding to support training, 
recruitment, retention, and readiness 
of the Capitol Police force. 
The State and Foreign Operations 
Appropriations 
bills 
supports 
the 
world’s most vulnerable with foreign 
assistance to meet urgent humani-
tarian needs, many of which have been 
exacerbated by the COVID–19 pan-
demic. 
This appropriations bill will promote 
democracy with funding to support al-
lies and partners of the United States, 
particularly to counter governments 
that undermine the core values of our 
democracy and of democracy around 
the world. 
Additionally, it confronts climate 
change with funding for global efforts 
to reduce emissions, advances women’s 
rights by increasing funding for family 
planning, 
increases 
United 
Nations 
Population Fund funding, and repeals 
restrictions on safe and legal abortion. 
This is a package I am proud to take 
home to my constituents, and I urge 
my colleagues on both sides of the aisle 
to reflect on whom we are here to rep-
resent and support, make good on our 
promises to the American people, and 
pass this rule and these critical appro-
priations bills. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank the distinguished gen-
tleman and my friend from New York 
for yielding me the customary 30 min-
utes, and I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the rule before us today 
provides for consideration of three ap-
propriations measures for fiscal year 
2022. I first would like to start off by 
thanking Chair DELAURO and Ranking 
Member GRANGER and their committee 
staff for their tireless work on these 
measures. It is truly an honor to be 
part of the appropriations process on 
the committee, and I am very grateful 
for their efforts. 
Unfortunately, though, Mr. Speaker, 
like the package of seven funding 
measures considered yesterday, the 
majority marked these three bills to 
unworkable 302(b) allocations, and the 
package before us today stands abso-
lutely no chance of becoming law. 
Collectively, these three bills provide 
for $147 billion in spending, which is a 
13 percent increase from fiscal year 
2021. 
Overall, 
the 
majority’s 
proposed 
spending levels increase nondefense 
discretionary spending by 17 percent 
while only increasing defense spending 
by 1 percent. That is not even enough 
to keep up with inflation. 
This is at a time when our Nation 
and when our military faces threats 
from China, Russia, and Iran. Because 
of these threats, we should be investing 
in the U.S. and our partner nations, 
not underfunding our military and na-
tional security programs and obliga-
tions abroad. 
While H.R. 4373, which funds the De-
partment of State and Foreign Oper-
ations, does include support for our al-
lies, Israel, Jordan, and Taiwan, it also 
places conditions on our strategic part-
ner Egypt. These conditions will under-
cut national security efforts which is 
another hit to our defense operations. 
Further, H.R. 4373 removes long-
standing bipartisan policies including 
the Helms amendment which prohibits 
foreign aid from being used for abor-
tions. It also doubles funding to the 
United Nations Population Fund. This 
organization has historically supported 
coercive abortion and involuntary ster-
ilization. 
Finally, this bill provides for more 
than $3 billion for climate change pro-
grams, including $1.6 billion for the 
Green Climate Fund. Even Secretary 
Yellen acknowledged the Green Cli-
mate Fund has oversight issues and has 
been mismanaged. 
The rule before us today also pro-
vides for consideration of H.R. 4505, the 
Commerce, Justice, Science, and Re-
lated 
Agencies 
Appropriations 
Act. 
Like H.R. 4373, this bill removes long-
standing bipartisan language restrict-
ing 
the 
Justice 
Department 
from 
spending taxpayer dollars on abortion. 
The measure also fails to include four 
bipartisan Second Amendment protec-
tions including two provisions that 
have been in the CJS bill since fiscal 
year 2006. 
Finally, H.R. 4505 imposes new, unau-
thorized conditions on many State and 
local law enforcement programs, in-
cluding Byrne JAG and COPS. Many of 
these conditions require legislation to 
be passed by States and localities and 
are outside the control of law enforce-
ment agencies. These requirements 
will effectively defund programs relied 
on by our Nation’s police officers, in-
cluding initiatives that support train-
ing and equipment purchases, active 
shooter response training, and suicide 
prevention. 
This measure also fails to address the 
real challenges facing our Nation, in-
cluding 
cyberattacks 
on 
American 
companies, extortion plots on critical 
infrastructure, and the flow of deadly 
fentanyl at the southern border. 
At the end of the day, if my col-
leagues across the aisle are serious 
about enacting appropriations meas-
ures before funding runs out at the end 
of September, it is absolutely critical 
they remove their far-left, radical pol-
icy riders to restore longstanding bi-
partisan provisions; otherwise, we will 
face a continuing resolution or a Dem-
ocrat-driven shutdown. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
oppose this rule, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to in re-
sponse, and I appreciate the comments 
from my friend, include in the RECORD 
a 2013 American Progress article titled, 
‘‘How the Hyde Amendment Discrimi-
nates Against Poor Women and Women 
of Color.’’ 
[May 10, 2013] 
HOW THE HYDE AMENDMENT DISCRIMINATES 
AGAINST POOR WOMEN AND WOMEN OF COLOR 
(By Jessica Arons and Lindsay Rosenthal) 
In 1973 the Supreme Court decided in the 
landmark case Roe v. Wade to recognize the 
constitutional right to abortion for all 
women. Forty years later, however, this 
guarantee remains an empty promise for 
thousands of poor women and women of color 
thanks to the Hyde Amendment, an annual 
appropriations measure first passed in 1976. 
This provision intentionally discriminates 
against poor women by prohibiting Medicaid, 
the health-insurance program for low-in-
come individuals and families, from covering 
abortion care. 
Because of the intersection in our country 
between race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic 
status, this restriction also has a dispropor-
tionate impact on women of color. Due to a 
number of root causes related to inequality, 
women of color are more likely to qualify for 
government insurance that restricts abor-
tion coverage, more likely to experience 
higher rates of unintended pregnancy, and 
less likely to be able to pay for an abortion 
out of pocket. The Hyde Amendment there-
fore does not only undermine gender equity, 
but it also violates principles of racial and 
economic justice. 
The 
Hyde 
Amendment 
discriminates 
against poor women. 
Congress passed the Hyde Amendment in 
order to deny poor women access to abor-
tion. Former Rep. Henry Hyde (R–IL), the 
law’s sponsor, admitted during the debate of 
his proposal that he was targeting poor 
women. ‘‘I certainly would like to prevent, if 
I could legally, anybody having an abortion, 
a rich woman, a middle-class woman, or a 
poor woman,’’ he said. ‘‘Unfortunately, the 
only vehicle available is the Medicaid bill.’’ 
1 in 10 women of reproductive age in the 
United States relies on Medicaid for their 
health coverage. By prohibiting Medicaid 
from covering abortion services, the Hyde 
Amendment has used the primary source of 
health care for low-income women to restrict 
access to abortion. 
Poor women face significant disparities 
when it comes to reproductive health. Com-
pared with higher-income women, poor wom-
en’s rates of unintended pregnancy and abor-
tion are each five times as high, and their 
unplanned birth rate is six times as high. 
These disparities are rooted in deeply en-
trenched inequities in the areas of health-in-
surance coverage, health care, and medically 
accurate sex education, as well as other 
health-promoting resources. 
Abortion costs between $300 and $950 in the 
first trimester, making it unaffordable for 
poor women without insurance coverage. In

July 28, 2021 
2009 more than half of nonelderly adult 
women enrolled in Medicaid had family in-
comes below the poverty level; one-quarter 
had incomes below 50 percent of the poverty 
level. The monthly income for a family of 
three living at half the current poverty level 
is $813.75. 
One in four Medicaid-qualified women who 
seek an abortion is forced to carry her preg-
nancy to term because of cost. Many more 
are forced to delay their procedure for as 
long as two to three weeks while they raise 
money, with the costs and risks of the proce-
dure increasing the longer they wait. 
The 
Hyde 
Amendment 
discriminates 
against women of color. 
A dissenting Supreme Court opinion recog-
nized that the Hyde Amendment was dis-
criminatory. 
Supreme 
Court 
Justice 
Thurgood Marshall’s dissenting opinion in 
Harris v. McRae noted that the law was ‘‘de-
signed to deprive poor and minority women 
of the constitutional right to choose abor-
tion.’’ 
Women of color are disproportionately 
poor and therefore less likely to be able to 
pay out of pocket for their health care. Ac-
cording to 2011 census data, 25.5 percent of 
African Americans and 25 percent of Latinas 
are living below the poverty level, compared 
to only 10.4 percent of whites and 12.2 per-
cent of Asians. Moreover, certain groups of 
Asian and Pacific Islander women face much 
higher poverty rates than are reflected in 
the aggregate census data. For example, 67 
percent, 66 percent, and 47 percent of people 
of Laotian, Hmong, and Cambodian descent, 
respectively, live in poverty in the United 
States. 
Women of color are more likely to be en-
rolled in government insurance. In 2011, 40.9 
percent of African American females and 36.3 
percent of Latinas had government-based in-
surance, including 29.2 percent and 29.6 per-
cent participation, respectively, in Medicaid. 
In contrast, 32.6 percent of white females and 
24.4 percent of Asian American females got 
their insurance through a government pro-
gram. While Asian and Pacific Islander 
women use Medicaid at lower rates for a va-
riety of reasons—only 6 percent were en-
rolled in the program in 2004—participation 
is quite high among various subgroups. For 
example, 20 percent of women of Southeast 
Asian descent are covered by Medicaid. 
Women of color are disproportionately 
more likely to need an abortion. Black 
women had the highest unintended preg-
nancy rate of any racial or ethnic group and 
more than double that of non-Hispanic white 
women. The unintended pregnancy rate of 
Latinas is 78 percent higher than the non- 
Hispanic rate. These high unintended preg-
nancy rates are part of the reason women of 
color seek abortion at higher rates than non- 
Hispanic whites. Although they represent 
much smaller segments of the population as 
a whole, black and Latina women comprise 
30 percent and 25 percent of women who have 
abortions, respectively. Data on Asian and 
Pacific 
Islander 
women’s 
utilization 
of 
health services, including abortion, is ex-
tremely limited, but one study has shown 
that 35 percent of pregnancies for Asian and 
Pacific Islander women end in abortion, 
compared to 18 percent for non-Hispanic 
white women. 
These 
health 
disparities 
mirror 
other 
health disparities that women of color expe-
rience. In addition to higher rates of unin-
tended pregnancy and abortion, women of 
color face higher rates of reproductive can-
cers, HIV and other sexually transmitted in-
fections, 
premature 
births, 
low 
birth 
weights, and maternal and infant morbidity 
and mortality. They also encounter poorer 
health outcomes for diabetes, cardiovascular 
disease, and obesity, among other health 
conditions. 
Root causes of inequality drive the health 
disparities women of color face. Differential 
access to treatment, lower levels of respect 
and competency from health care providers, 
lack of trust in the medical establishment, 
lack of accurate information, and a host of 
other socioeconomic factors lead to poorer 
outcomes along racial and ethnic lines for 
overall health indicators, specifically with 
regard to reproductive health. 
The Hyde Amendment treats the rights of 
women in this country according to two dif-
ferent standards: whether you can afford to 
pay for your rights or not. That is not equal-
ity. 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I do 
note that in my home State of New 
York we have made the decision for 
many years to support women in pov-
erty who seek reproductive rights. 
Rights are granted to us under the 
Constitution. Those rights are as fun-
damental as any other right guaran-
teed to us under the Constitution, but 
we don’t have economic tests for rights 
in the United States. So if you have a 
right, Mr. Speaker, you have a right. 
We don’t say you have the right to free 
speech as long as you can pay for it. We 
don’t suggest that the right to assem-
ble, the right to have your grievances 
addressed by your government, the 
right to petition, the right to press or 
to select the religion and support the 
religion that you choose is subject to 
some kind of economic test. We believe 
the same should be true for reproduc-
tive rights. 
So I would just say that in New York 
it is something that we have supported 
for many, many years, and we continue 
to urge support, public dollars for re-
productive rights and for women’s 
health, which is very much at stake, 
particularly in communities of color. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
distinguished gentleman from Colorado 
(Mr. PERLMUTTER), who is my friend on 
the Committee on Rules. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank Mr. MORELLE for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support 
the rule and the underlying bills. I am 
pleased to see the House make signifi-
cant progress this week by passing 
these appropriations bills which in-
clude important funding for my dis-
trict, our communities, and for people 
all across the country. 
I do want to highlight two bipartisan 
amendments made in order under this 
rule which I have offered to H.R. 4505, 
the Commerce, Justice, and Science 
Appropriations bill. 
First is amendment No. 43, which I 
introduced with Representatives BRIAN 
BABIN, CHRISSY HOULAHAN, and DONALD 
NORCROSS. Our amendment would ele-
vate the Office of Space Commerce by 
moving it out of the National Oceanic 
and Atmospheric Administration and 
into the Office of the Secretary of 
Commerce. This relatively small office 
has growing responsibilities to license 
remote sensing activities or satellite 
imagery of the Earth and implement a 
pilot program on space situational 
awareness. 
Elevating this office would better le-
verage the expertise of the entire de-
partment to support their work and 
improve 
interagency 
collaboration, 
which is critical to their responsibil-
ities. This proposal has been discussed 
for years, and it is time to finally 
make this move. I look forward to 
working with my colleagues on the 
Science, Space, and Technology Com-
mittee to further define these new 
roles and responsibilities. 
I also want to highlight another bi-
partisan amendment No. 44, which I in-
troduced with Representatives KEN 
BUCK, JOE
NEGUSE, DOUG
LAMBORN, 
DIANA DEGETTE, and JASON CROW from 
the Colorado delegation. Our amend-
ment is a plus-minus amendment to 
NASA’s exploration account to show 
our support for additional funding for 
the Orion Multipurpose Crew Vehicle 
totalling $1.45 billion. 
b 1045 
Orion is America’s deep space explo-
ration spacecraft which will carry our 
astronauts back to the Moon and on to 
Mars as part of the Artemis program. 
This additional funding for Orion will 
reduce costs in the program over the 
long term by maximizing reuse of Ori-
on’s systems and establish efficient 
production flows for the Artemis III 
Orion spacecraft and beyond. 
Our amendment would fully fund 
Orion while also supporting full fund-
ing for the Space Launch System and 
Exploration Ground Systems, as all 
three are critical to the Artemis pro-
gram. The entire NASA Exploration 
program should be increased to meet 
these standards, and I hope to work 
with Chairman CARTWRIGHT
and our 
Appropriations Committee to do just 
that and support NASA’s important 
work without cutting other programs. 
I encourage all of my colleagues to 
support these amendments, the rule, 
and the underlying bills. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield such time as he may con-
sume to the gentleman from Oklahoma 
(Mr. COLE), my good friend, my men-
tor, and the ranking member of the 
Rules Committee. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
very good friend from Pennsylvania for 
yielding. 
I rise today in opposition to the rule, 
Mr. Speaker. I have two matters I wish 
to discuss today. 
First, I want to speak to the Repub-
lican motion to recommit on H.R. 4502, 
on which the House will be voting in 
the coming days. While I have many 
concerns with the bills reported out of 
the Appropriations Committee, none is 
more alarming than the systematic re-
moval of longstanding provisions to 
protect the lives of unborn children 
and preserve the conscience rights of 
American taxpayers. This has been 
done in bill after bill after bill. 
If my motion to recommit passes, Re-
publicans will restore essential pro-life 
protections that have been stripped 
from these bills. 
We will restore the Hyde amendment, 
which prohibits Federal tax dollars

from funding abortions on demand and 
has been included in appropriations 
bills for every year for the past 45 
years. 
We will restore the Weldon amend-
ment, which protects American doc-
tors, nurses, and other healthcare pro-
fessionals from participating in or pro-
viding an abortion if they have a moral 
objection to that procedure. 
We will restore the Dornan amend-
ment, which prevents District of Co-
lumbia resident taxpayer moneys from 
being used for abortions on demand. 
We will restore the Smith amend-
ment, which prevents the Federal Em-
ployee Health Benefit Plan from sub-
sidizing abortions on demand for Fed-
eral workers. 
We will restore the Helms amend-
ment, which prevents American tax-
payers from financing abortions to for-
eign organizations or countries. 
Regardless of one’s personal views, 
lawmakers and Presidents of both par-
ties have always agreed that Ameri-
cans should not be forced to pay for 
abortions on demand with their hard- 
earned tax dollars. 
It is not too late for Democrats to 
change course, abandon their radical, 
far-left policies, and restore these im-
portant protections before a final vote 
on this measure. Every Democrat who 
is not a freshman has voted to support 
this language and these amendments 
on this floor, and we know they must 
again if any of these appropriations 
bills are ever to become law. 
All Republicans in the House stand 
united with the American people on 
this issue, and none will support appro-
priations bills that do not include 
these important pro-life protections. 
We urge Democrats to accept the mo-
tion to recommit, restore these bipar-
tisan compromises, and allow appro-
priations bills to move forward toward 
a final negotiation in good faith. Ulti-
mately, failure to do so will result in 
either a continuing resolution or, even 
worse, a government shutdown later 
this year. Neither outcome should ever 
be acceptable to any Member on this 
floor. 
Let me now turn, Mr. Speaker, if I 
may, to an issue that is more parochial 
but where the outlook is more prom-
ising. That is the Federal response to 
the so-called McGirt decision by the 
United States Supreme Court. 
Many Members will not be aware of 
this, but last year, the Supreme Court 
decided that much of Oklahoma, for 
the purposes of criminal prosecution, 
remains Indian Country. 
In Indian Country, only the Federal 
Government and Tribal law enforce-
ment officials can prosecute Indians 
who commit crimes, again, on Indian 
reservations. That, obviously, in the 
State of Oklahoma, will now call for 
enormously robust Federal law en-
forcement and Tribal law enforcement 
capabilities. 
I am happy to report that in one of 
the measures that we face today, that 
reality has been taken into account. 
Frankly, our friends, the Biden admin-
istration, asked for an additional $70 
million for the Department of Justice 
to finance additional U.S. attorneys, 
additional Federal marshals, and addi-
tional FBI for Oklahoma to respond to 
the McGirt decision. 
Sadly, our friends did not request 
similar funds for Tribal law enforce-
ment officials, and none of the bills in 
front of us actually deal with that 
issue. 
Last night, we placed an amendment 
dealing with this before this House. It 
was part of an en bloc amendment. I 
actually believe if it had come on its 
own, it would have passed. But it 
failed. 
However, the appropriations process 
is a long process, and I think negotia-
tions in good faith with the full com-
mittee will eventually result in addi-
tional Federal dollars for law enforce-
ment. 
Regardless, that Supreme Court deci-
sion, the McGirt decision, means the 
Federal Government and Tribal law en-
forcement officials must do more in 
this area. Again, one of the bills in 
front of us helps with regard to the 
Federal Government. I am hopeful, in 
the final negotiations, we can do more 
on McGirt. 
My last point, Mr. Speaker, is simply 
to say we need to look at all of these 
bills collectively. Just as a piece of 
friendly advice to my friends, if we are 
going to get to a deal, three things ab-
solutely have to happen. 
The first is, the amount of money we 
spend on defense simply must go up. 
There is not enough money in the bills 
passed out of the Appropriations Com-
mittee to adequately fund our defense 
in a dangerous world. 
Second, the outrageous domestic ex-
plosion of spending must come down. 
We simply, as my friend from Pennsyl-
vania pointed out, can’t afford a spend-
ing spree. 
Finally, and most importantly, and 
my friends need to realize this politi-
cally, for any of these bills to pass the 
United States Senate and ultimately 
become law, all the pro-life provisions 
that they have systematically stripped 
out of these bills have to be restored. 
Otherwise, my friends will get Donald 
Trump’s last negotiated budget for the 
second year of the Biden administra-
tion. I don’t think that is what they 
want, but that is exactly where we are 
headed unless they change course and 
work with us to preserve these long-
standing, pro-life protections that have 
been in these bills for, in many cases, 
decades. 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
First, I do want to respond to my dis-
tinguished colleague from Oklahoma 
and friend from the Rules Committee 
as it relates to the McGirt decision. I 
share his concerns for the challenges 
being faced by the people in the State 
of Oklahoma. I know his amendment 
has been made in order. Without regard 
to how that vote takes place, I would 
love to work with him—and, I am sure, 
others would—to address the real con-
cerns by the people of the State of 
Oklahoma. I look forward to that con-
versation. 
I do want, before I yield to my friend, 
to mention that I talked, in my open-
ing comments, about some of the 
things that are in the bill. I do want to 
highlight some of the important things 
in the Legislative Branch appropria-
tions, which provides $4.8 billion, an in-
crease of nearly 14 percent. 
I mentioned earlier that we hope to 
build 
upon 
the 
emergency 
supple-
mental bill, which we passed in May, 
that would continue to support the 
Capitol Police, National Guard, et 
cetera. In this bill, we put money to 
improve training and bolster wellness 
support for the Capitol Police, who 
were attacked on January 6, and pro-
vide funding to hire up to over 2,100 
sworn officers and 450 civilian members 
of the Capitol Police and more re-
sources for recruitment, retention, and 
readiness for them. 
We strengthened congressional ca-
pacity. It increases funding for con-
gressional offices to help recruit and 
retain a talented and diverse staff and 
supports mental health and wellness 
for Members and staff. 
We always talk about being Article I 
of the Constitution, and we really need 
to support that legislative branch and 
make sure we have the resources to be 
able to provide balanced, thoughtful 
support for the American public. 
I wanted to highlight some of the 
really important things. I appreciate, 
certainly, Chairman RYAN
and the 
work that he, the ranking member, and 
the members of that subcommittee did 
in getting that bill before the House 
and the rule that we are debating right 
now. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the 
distinguished gentlewoman from Flor-
ida (Ms. LOIS FRANKEL), my colleague 
and friend. 
Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. 
Speaker, I am proud to support this 
SFOPs bill, which, in the words of 
President Biden, says that the United 
States is back on the world stage. 
The bill reflects the importance of 
diplomatic and development assistance 
and cooperation with valuable partners 
to advance peace and prosperity around 
the world. It rebuilds public health in-
frastructure, confronts climate change, 
and advances basic education in unde-
veloped nations. 
On a subject I know that we can 
agree on, on both sides of the aisle, the 
bill is proudly pro-Israel. It fulfills our 
commitment to Israel, whose security 
in a very, very dangerous region of the 
world is America’s security, too. We 
expand our development partnership 
between our two countries to work to-
gether and improve lives around the 
world in poor areas. 
I say to my colleagues, let’s maintain 
this bipartisan support to our very 
good friend, Israel. 
Mr. Speaker, the bill also recognizes 
that when girls and women succeed,

the world succeeds. The bill invests in 
education, health and maternal care, 
economic opportunity, and combating 
barriers to success like gender-based 
violence and child marriage. It sup-
ports 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
‘‘Women, Peace and Security’’ strat-
egy. 
Mr. Speaker, most importantly, this 
bill removes the harmful Helms amend-
ment, which restricts U.S. funding for 
abortion services around the world, and 
removes the global gag rule, which 
forces healthcare providers to choose 
between U.S. global health assistance 
and the ability to counsel and provide 
clients with accurate and a full range 
of safe and legal reproductive options. 
The gag rule has resulted in good and 
honest healthcare providers turning 
down United States financial assist-
ance, forcing the closure of clinics 
around the world, leaving more than a 
million 
women 
without 
access 
to 
healthcare, 
including 
reproductive 
care. 
Yesterday, I heard my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle talk about 
restricting abortion in the United 
States. Now, today, it is Ghana and the 
rest of the world. I want to say to my 
colleagues, let me respectfully clue you 
in that in poor, undeveloped countries, 
you are not stopping abortions. You 
are stopping safe abortions. Unsafe 
abortions are responsible for 13 percent 
of maternal deaths around the world. 
Let me give you another clue. The 
best way to stop abortions is with ac-
cess to family planning and contracep-
tion, which is in this very, very good 
bill. 
I heard my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle talk about polling, and 
I say polling, schmolling. Polls say one 
thing; polls say another thing. I want 
to ask you, has any woman or even 
man in the world taken a poll to decide 
whether or not they should become a 
parent? I don’t think so. 
I am talking about past bills that 
have had these terrible provisions, the 
gag rule, the Helms amendment, and so 
forth. You know that sometimes you 
go along not because you want to go 
along. This has been the case for many 
of us with these provisions. 
Let me just say as loud as possible, 
women cannot live their full potential 
unless they get to make their own deci-
sions about parenthood. So, removing 
the global gag rule and the Helms 
amendment makes this such a very, 
very good bill that I celebrate today. 
This is an important bill, and I support 
it. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
The Biden administration has ex-
tended border shutdowns with Mexico 
and Canada, extended European and 
other international travel restrictions, 
and has reimposed mask mandates for 
fully vaccinated people, contradicting 
previous CDC guidance and, sadly, 
choosing 
to 
follow 
the 
political 
science, not the science. 
But, Mr. Speaker, the chaos at our 
southern border, where illegal immi-
grants have been apprehended from 
over 160 countries, undermines any ef-
forts to prevent the spread of COVID– 
19. That is why, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, I will personally offer 
an amendment to the rule to imme-
diately 
consider 
Congresswoman 
YVETTE HERRELL’s PAUSE Act of 2021. 
This legislation would provide for 
stringent enforcement of Title 42, a 
public health order allowing illegal im-
migrants to be quickly expelled from 
the United States, and would prohibit 
HHS and DHS from weakening Title 
42’s implementation. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to insert the text of my amend-
ment in the RECORD, along with any ex-
traneous material, immediately prior 
to the vote on the previous question. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
b 1100 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 5 minutes to the gentle-
woman 
from 
Iowa 
(Mrs. 
MILLER- 
MEEKS), a doctor and my good friend, 
who is here to explain the amendment. 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank my colleague for yielding me 
time. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
defeat the previous question so we can 
take up H.R. 471, the PAUSE Act, 
which was introduced by my colleague 
and 
friend, 
Representative 
YVETTE 
HERRELL. As a physician and former 
Director of Public Health for the State 
of Iowa, I am proud to cosponsor this 
legislation, and I believe we must bring 
this to the floor today. 
This legislation would prohibit the 
Federal Government from ceasing or 
lessening 
the 
implementation 
of 
COVID–19 
border 
health 
provisions 
until the COVID–19 public health emer-
gency is no longer in effect, both at the 
Federal level and all 50 States. 
At the start of the pandemic last 
year, through the Centers for Disease 
Control, President Trump implemented 
Title 42 border health restrictions. 
These commonsense restrictions ensure 
that people crossing our northern and 
southern border do not present a public 
health risk to our country. President 
Biden, to his credit, had left some of 
these restrictions in place as our coun-
try works to eradicate the COVID–19 
pandemic, until now. 
Now, the Biden administration is 
considering eliminating Title 42 border 
health restrictions and allowing indi-
viduals who pose a health risk to enter 
into our country. 
This comes in the same week where 
the President is considering requiring 
Federal employees to be vaccinated be-
cause of the delta variant, and this 
comes a day after this Chamber is re-
implementing a mask policy due to ris-
ing cases of COVID–19 across the coun-
try, and the Senate is not. 
Mr. Speaker, the President is right-
fully concerned about the rising num-
ber of COVID cases across the country, 
the vast majority of which are among 
the unvaccinated. While the President 
and I have different ideas on the best 
way to stop this virus, it is clear we all 
want Americans to be safe and healthy 
from this virus. 
Yet, while this administration is con-
sidering more COVID restrictions for 
American citizens on one hand, it is 
planning to loosen restrictions on mi-
grants at the border on the other. This 
has opened our borders to an unparal-
leled surge that is not diminishing and 
is also risking bringing north the lamb-
da variant, just as the Texas House 
Democrats brought north the delta 
variant. 
This administration is considering 
ending Title 42 restrictions in the mid-
dle of a public health crisis at our 
southern border. Last week, reports in-
dicated that the number of migrants 
who tested positive for COVID–19 in the 
Rio Grande Valley sector has increased 
by 900 percent. Last month alone, over 
188,000 migrants were encountered at 
the border, and 105,000 of those were 
turned away under Title 42 restric-
tions. 
If we are going to eradicate COVID, 
we cannot afford to repeal Title 42. 
Lifting these restrictions would threat-
en the health and safety of U.S. citi-
zens and could lead to higher levels of 
migration. Our Border Patrol agents 
and CBP officers are already dealing 
with migration surges, they support 
the continuance of Title 42, and we 
must ensure that they have the tools 
and processes needed to protect them-
selves and our country. This includes 
the ability to process migrants under 
Title 42 health restrictions until the 
public health emergency ends. 
Additionally, testing for COVID–19 
should be done at all airports or other 
ports of entry. 
Eliminating Title 42 would only exac-
erbate the current administration’s 
crisis at our southern border and likely 
lead to an increased public health cri-
sis. Failure to either close the border 
or continue Title 42 puts all American 
lives at risk, both vaccinated and 
unvaccinated. 
I urge Americans to get vaccinated 
so we can eradicate this virus. 
I urge the President not to repeal 
Title 42 restrictions. 
And I urge my colleagues to defeat 
the previous question so we can bring 
the PAUSE Act to the floor and keep 
Title 42 border health restrictions in 
place until the end of the COVID–19 
public health emergency. 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I do want to commend 
the previous speaker for her encourage-
ment of all Americans to be vac-
cinated. We certainly want to continue 
to promote that message and urge ev-
eryone in the United States to be vac-
cinated.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4101 
July 28, 2021 
Mr. Speaker, in my previous com-
ments, I talked about the congres-
sional and legislative appropriations. 
I include in the RECORD a July 13 
Business Insider article entitled: ‘‘Cap-
itol Hill staff take second jobs with 
Postmates, Starbucks, and J. Crew to 
make up for their low salaries.’’ 
I continue to repeat that men and 
women who work here shouldn’t strug-
gle to make ends meet just because 
they have dedicated their careers to 
public service. 
[July 13, 2021] 
CAPITOL HILL STAFF TAKE SECOND JOBS WITH 
POSTMATES, STARBUCKS, AND J. CREW
TO 
MAKE UP FOR THEIR LOW SALARIES 
(By Kayla Epstein) 
With no choice but to accept low pay, Cap-
itol Hill staffers often have to pick up second 
jobs. 
Retail, gig-economy, and service-industry 
jobs are frequent options. 
Staffers told Insider the second jobs add to 
an already stressful workload and lead to 
burnout. 
The next time you order takeout in the DC 
area, your delivery person might work for 
Congress. 
Given no choice but to accept startlingly 
low salaries in exchange for the privilege of 
working on Capitol Hill, many interns and 
junior staffers to America’s most powerful— 
and wealthy—politicians take second jobs to 
survive in Washington, DC, one of the most 
expensive cities in the country. 
Some staffers and interns go for gig-econ-
omy 
roles 
like 
Postmates, 
Uber, 
and 
DoorDash, while others work as baristas and 
bartenders. For those who struggle to afford 
a professional wardrobe, retail jobs help pro-
vide additional wages and a discount on 
clothes. 
While it’s common for people in the US to 
work second jobs to make ends meet, civic 
groups and staffers say that low pay on Cap-
itol Hill pushes out talented staff and cre-
ates an environment in which employees 
from privileged backgrounds have an edge in 
building long-term careers. 
‘‘You could tell when certain people kind 
of came from money and didn’t have to’’ 
work second jobs, one former staffer to a 
House Republican said. ‘‘I have some friends 
that didn’t need to because they came up 
from a wealthy upbringing . . . They were 
comfortable. Others were kind of like, ‘OK, 
yeah, I need to really do some extra jobs be-
cause this is not livable.’’’ 
Insider spoke to five current and former 
staffers who had worked second jobs as a way 
to compensate for what one former senior 
Democratic 
House 
aide 
called 
‘‘poverty 
wages.’’ They described exhaustion and burn-
out from pulling double duty, their only days 
off eaten up by delivering takeout or grab-
bing graveyard shifts at clothing stores. 
Some spoke on the condition of anonymity 
because they feared losing their jobs or hurt-
ing their careers by speaking out. 
‘‘It’s tough for the normal traditional 
staffer because that is easily a 50- to 60–hour 
week,’’ said one former House and Senate 
aide who started out at $27,000 a year and 
had to take a second job at apparel company 
J.Crew. 
When you add on the additional hours for 
a second job, he said, ‘‘you just burn yourself 
out to stay afloat.’’ 
Do you have a tip about Capitol Hill work-
place issues to share? Bad bosses, toxic of-
fices, or questionable behavior toward con-
gressional staffers? Insider is continuing to 
cover Congress as a workplace. 
AN OPEN SECRET 
The fact that many congressional employ-
ees take on second jobs has been an open se-
cret on the Hill for years. But when some 
staffers do seek outside work, they face re-
percussions. 
Audrey Henson, who was a Republican 
House aide making $25,000 before she founded 
the internshipplacement program College to 
Congress, said she faced pushback from her 
manager when she took a bartending job 
near the Hill. 
‘‘I would work until 2, 3 in the morning on 
a Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday night. I’d 
come into Congress absolutely exhausted,’’ 
she said of her job, which she held from 2013 
to 2014. 
‘‘Whenever I was having to pick up more 
shifts at the bar, and then when I ended up 
getting a weekend job, I was talked to by my 
chief of staff about priorities,’’ she told In-
sider. ‘‘And he was like, ‘This job should be 
your priority.’’’ 
‘‘I said, quite frankly, it is. I’m only doing 
these other jobs so that I can give you 
more,’’ Henson said. ‘‘Trust me, this is my 
only priority. Those jobs allow me to afford 
this job.’’ 
She worked at Union Pub, a popular water-
ing hole on Capitol Hill. 
‘‘I was like, I’m up here to work in Con-
gress, and I’m putting in equal hours at 
Union Pub. There’s an issue with this pic-
ture,’’ she said. ‘‘And I wasn’t alone.’’ 
Union Pub spokesperson Sam Sanchez said 
that, ‘‘pre-pandemic, Capitol Hill staffers 
made up a good portion of our staff working 
as part-time servers or bartenders—more 
than 50% at times.’’ 
One current Democratic House staffer, who 
started in DC before eventually making her 
way back to a district office, worked at a law 
firm and a retail store to make it through 
her part-time, unpaid Senate internship. 
‘‘I would do a shipment shift at like 3:30 in 
the morning, go to the law firm, and go to 
my internship,’’ she said. ‘‘I was working 
seven days a week . . . I wanted to work 
somewhere I could buy work clothes because 
it’s very expensive.’’ 
After her predawn store shift, ‘‘I would 
leave at 7, go catch the Metro’’ to her law 
firm gig, she said. 
As a part-time Senate intern, she didn’t 
get any travel benefits. 
‘‘I spent $260 a month on my Metro,’’ she 
said. 
Even after getting a full-time role with a 
committee, she continued to work her $10– 
per-hour retail job on the weekends to have 
enough spending money and afford work 
clothes. 
‘‘It was exhausting all the time. But in my 
mind it’s what I had to do for the job on the 
Hill,’’ she said. ‘‘I didn’t have much of a so-
cial life. I kind of missed out on a few years 
of my 20s just working myself to death.’’

‘I was giving up a lot’. 
Other Hill veterans echoed the detrimental 
impact of holding a second job while working 
full-time in Congress. Instead of using week-
ends to recuperate from weeks of late-night 
votes, political chaos, and a stressful office 
environment, they had to spend their time 
finding ways to make money. 
The former Republican House staffer start-
ed driving for Postmates to bolster his 
$30,500 salary. 
‘‘I would typically do it Friday evening, 
Saturday, Sunday,’’ he said. He could make 
about $200 to $300 a month from Postmates 
but had to ‘‘really grind to make those num-
bers.’’ 
‘‘I was making money, to have extra 
money, but I was also giving up a lot,’’ he 
said. ‘‘And it was just really hard sometimes 
to do my second job because I wanted to go 
out, I wanted to have fun, I wanted to just be 
lazy on a Saturday or Sunday. I wanted just 
to be able to relax.’’ 
Sometimes, the staffers said, the stress af-
fected their physical health, too. One current 
staffer told Insider that the exhaustion of 
working sunrise Starbucks shifts on top of 
her Hill internship made her hair fall out. 
‘‘I wasn’t getting a lot of sleep. I was look-
ing very tired,’’ she said. ‘‘I was breaking out 
a lot. My hair was not in great shape—it was 
thinning out.’’ 
‘They’re missing out on the most talented 
people’. 
House and Senate offices and committees 
have only so much money to spend, and that 
allotment must fund everything, including 
travel, office supplies, direct mail, and staff 
salaries. Each office functions like its own 
business, determining pay and the number of 
workers and interns. There is no formal 
human resources office on Capitol Hill that 
can help regulate pay for certain jobs, and 
the pay band system that exists across the 
federal government to standardize salaries 
doesn’t apply to Congress. 
On June 14, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez 
of New York and more than 100 Democratic 
lawmakers sent a letter to the House Appro-
priations Committee to demand an increase 
in the Members’ Representational Allow-
ance, the pool of funding that is distributed 
equally among all House offices. 
‘‘For years, pay and benefits for the staff 
of Member offices, leadership offices, and 
committees have fallen farther and farther 
behind what is offered in the private sector,’’ 
the lawmakers wrote. 
A few days later, the House Appropriations 
Committee released its legislative funding 
bill that calls for a $134 million increase to 
the MRA. It would also increase the spending 
for intern pay and committee budgets. 
But there’s no guarantee that the extra 
money to the MRA would go toward bol-
stering staff salaries. And many House of-
fices still don’t properly use the money 
available for internships, said Carlos Vera, 
executive director of the advocacy group Pay 
Our Interns. 
Low pay is simply accepted as the cost of 
admission into the legislative branch, and 
many job candidates fear attempting to ne-
gotiate with hiring managers because of the 
scarcity of these opportunities. 
But Henson, who bartended, said it’s long 
past time for that to change. Forcing staff-
ers to work themselves to the point of burn-
out hinders their ability to do their jobs for 
the American people, she said. 
‘‘What other profession do we ask full-time 
professionals to be a barista on the side?’’ 
Henson said. ‘‘What if you had professional 
athletes leave practice every day to work at 
Starbucks? Would they be winners? Would 
the teams be getting the best talent? No.’’ 
‘‘That’s what’s happening in Congress,’’ 
she added. ‘‘They’re missing out on the most 
talented people because they’re not paying 
them.’’ 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, having 
talked about the legislative branch, let 
me take just a moment now to talk 
about where we are globally with this 
appropriations bill. 
The State, Foreign Operations, and 
Related Programs Subcommittee asks 
for an increase of more than 12 percent, 
an appropriation of $62 billion to sup-
port the displaced and vulnerable, re-
build public health infrastructure, con-
front climate change, advance women’s 
health, and promote democracy. 
If I could take just a moment, Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to highlight some

of these things, particularly as it re-
lates to rebuilding the public health in-
frastructure. 
The rule which supports the under-
lying bill would dramatically increase 
funding 
to 
confront 
the 
current 
COVID–19 pandemic, prevent future 
pandemics, and shore up gains made in 
global health. It includes $10.6 billion 
to support the health of families and 
communities around the world. The 
total includes a billion dollars for glob-
al health security to prevent future 
pandemics through both bilateral and 
multilateral mechanisms, something 
that is critical to stop the spread of fu-
ture pandemics. 
It also places a premium on con-
fronting climate change and the cli-
mate crisis by expanding global efforts 
to address environmental threats and 
reduce emissions, with over $3 billion 
to address the climate crisis and other 
environmental programs and includes 
the first direct appropriations for the 
Green Climate Fund, to the tune of a 
$1.6 billion investment. 
It also promotes democracy around 
the world, provides funding to support 
allies and partners of the United States 
with a $1.6 billion appropriation to pro-
mote a free and open Indo-Pacific and 
help counter the growing influence of 
the People’s Republic of China in de-
veloping countries, something that I 
think people on both sides of the aisle 
know is a growing threat to freedom 
and democracy around the world. It 
also funds a $2.517 billion effort to in-
crease democracy programs and pro-
vides $300 million for the National En-
dowment for Democracy. 
For those of us who care deeply 
about the world in which we live and 
care deeply about those countries that 
seek to limit democratic institutions 
and democracy, this is welcome news 
and I think very, very appropriate to 
the American values which we hold so 
dear. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I am absolutely dis-
appointed that an amendment offered 
by my good friend, Mr. MICHAEL WALTZ 
from Florida, was not made in order 
under today’s rule. 
This amendment would support a dip-
lomatic boycott of the 2022 Olympic 
Games in Beijing. I would actually sup-
port a total boycott of the Olympic 
Games in Beijing. But just looking at 
the diplomatic boycott, China has an 
abysmal record on human rights. They 
currently are housing Uighurs in con-
centration camps in western China, 
they are using slave labor, and even 
forced organ harvesting. 
The CCP, the Chinese Communist 
Party, exports fentanyl to the United 
States, steals our trade secrets, and 
constantly threatens to invade the free 
and independent nation of Taiwan. 
The last thing we need to do is to re-
ward the CCP with the economic ben-
efit and, frankly, the cachet on the 
world stage by hosting the Olympic 
Games. I just wish that my liberal col-
leagues across the aisle had allowed us 
to debate at least a diplomatic boycott 
of the Beijing Olympic Games. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Michigan 
(Mrs. 
MCCLAIN). 
Mrs. MCCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in opposition to the radical, par-
tisan, and polarizing appropriations 
bill 
the 
Democrats 
are 
ramming 
through this Chamber. 
It wasn’t enough for the Democrats 
to disregard the opinion of an over-
whelming majority of Americans who 
do not want their tax dollars being 
used to bankroll abortions here in the 
U.S. In this appropriations bill, they 
want to take it a step further and ex-
port abortion around the world. You 
heard it right. 
The Helms amendment, which pre-
dates the Hyde amendment, ensures 
that U.S. tax dollars do not fund abor-
tion through foreign assistance pro-
grams. Foreign assistance programs 
should help defend our country. Demo-
crats felt the need to strip it from this 
bill. 
My constituents do not want their 
hard-earned tax dollars shipped over-
seas to kill unborn children. And you 
know what? Neither do 77 percent of 
Americans, according to a January 2021 
Marist poll. Yet, Democrats are saying 
they are giving people what they want. 
Well, that is a flat-out lie. 
Who exactly are they catering to 
with this radical move? Far left-wing 
activists? 
I am disgusted by some in this Cham-
ber and the President for their shame-
ful disregard of taxpayer wishes; their 
hypocritical double standards; and, 
most importantly, their shameful dis-
regard for human life. 
As a reminder to this administration 
and my colleagues, I am wearing flip- 
flops today so they can be reminded of 
this administration’s ability to flip- 
flop on issues. This administration 
could not be consistent if their life de-
pended on it, or worse, ours. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President. 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to just take a 
moment to dive a little deeper in the 
Commerce, Justice, Science, and Re-
lated 
Agencies 
appropriation, 
and 
thank, again, the chairman of the sub-
committee, Mr. CARTWRIGHT, for the 
great work that he did in getting the 
appropriations bill before the House. 
Overall, the appropriation bill pro-
vides $81.6 billion, an increase of 14 per-
cent, to create jobs, support safer com-
munities, and confront the climate cri-
sis here at home. 
I would like to take just a moment to 
highlight some of the specifics, because 
it is important, as the American public 
observes the conversation going on 
here in the Congress about what our 
priorities are. Budgets always describe 
our priorities and our values. 
For instance, this bill provides $25 
billion, an increase of $1.77 billion for 
NASA, with strong funding and a total 
effort to gain scientific knowledge 
about the Earth’s changing climate. 
It includes $6.46 billion for the Na-
tional Oceanic and Atmospheric Ad-
ministration for climate research and 
mitigation efforts, including improve-
ments to weather forecasting, under-
standing the impact and degree of sea 
level rise, supporting offshore wind en-
ergy, fisheries management, and STEM 
education. 
It fosters innovation in U.S. eco-
nomic competitiveness with $9.63 bil-
lion for the National Science Founda-
tion to support climate science and 
sustainable research, as well as re-
search on artificial intelligence, quan-
tum 
information 
science, 
advanced 
manufacturing, 
cybersecurity, 
and 
other critical research efforts, which I 
might say, parenthetically, is criti-
cally important, not only for economic 
security, not only for the climate cri-
sis, but for national security as we con-
front these threats across the globe. 
In this bill we also address gender- 
based violence, providing $753.8 million 
for Violence Against Women’s Act pre-
vention and prosecution programs and 
includes $60 million for grants to re-
duce the backlog of unprocessed rape 
kits, which is critically important. 
This bill also provides support to cre-
ate good-paying jobs for Americans, in-
cluding providing $10.95 billion for the 
Department of Commerce, an increase 
of $2.03 billion, with investments in 
economic development in distressed 
communities and support for small 
businesses, including small- and me-
dium-sized American manufacturers, as 
we continue to be concerned about the 
supply chain and the value chain as it 
relates to not only competitiveness by 
American companies but also, again, to 
make 
sure 
that 
we 
support 
our 
warfighters, and to make sure the sup-
ply chain for critical components and 
parts is ready for the defense of our Na-
tion. 
It invests directly in our commu-
nities, with $433.1 million for the Eco-
nomic Development Administration, 
an increase of $87 million, to boost eco-
nomically recovering areas and launch 
innovative community development ef-
forts, as well as $275 million for the 
very important Manufacturing Exten-
sion Partnership Program, which we 
utilize in my community and others 
across the country, and an increase of 
$125 million to help small- and me-
dium-sized United States manufactur-
ers create and preserve jobs. 
Much of this will also be involved 
with making sure that people who have 
been displaced because of the pandemic 
economically will have opportunities 
to go into new industries and be 
trained, as well as make sure that in-
cumbent workers continue to upgrade 
their skills so they can be competitive

in what is a very, very competitive 
global economic environment. 
So I want to highlight those, Mr. 
Speaker. I know that I just talked 
about a lot of things that are not be-
fore the House, but I thought I would 
spend just a few moments talking 
about what is actually before the 
House and some of the critical invest-
ments that we are making in the bills 
that are before us. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
b 1115 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. ROY), my good friend. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
what my colleague earlier offered as 
the previous question with respect to 
Title 42, because what we are seeing at 
the border is an absolute travesty, and 
my colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle are going to do nothing, literally 
nothing about that today, even as we 
see people spilling across the border 
who are clearly testing positive for 
COVID. 
We have a hotel in La Joya, Texas, 
that is literally filled right now with 
individuals who are heavily testing 
positive for COVID. These are the facts 
on the ground. 
I know my friend, the Speaker, 
knows how bad it is at the border, 
knows how bad it is in Laredo, knows 
how bad it is in Del Rio, knows how 
bad it is in McAllen. 
I have got a text here from a sheriff 
in a small Texas town saying, ‘‘We are 
passing an emergency declaration to-
night at city council that no illegal im-
migrants can be released in the city of 
Uvalde per the CDC guidelines of coun-
tries on their list without a negative 
COVID test. We have had our health 
authority write orders that give us the 
authority to have them, government, 
Border Patrol, and immigrants, quar-
antine for 10 to 14 days. 
We have a crisis at our border, and 
we are playing footsie with mask man-
dates in the people’s House. I mean, it 
is absolutely absurd what this body is 
doing, the people’s House. It is an em-
barrassment. It is a mockery. 
The American people are fed up. 
They want to go back to life. They 
want to go back to business. They want 
to go back to school without their chil-
dren being forced to wear masks, to be 
put in the corner, to have mental 
health issues. 
We are running around here, and the 
Speaker comes down here at 10 a.m. 
saying we have got to wear masks in 
the people’s House while we have got 
thousands of people pouring across our 
border, and Democrats don’t do a darn 
thing about it. 
Heavily infected with COVID. 
We have The New York Times today. 
What a mess. CDC about to reverse on in-
door masking for the vaccinated. 
This is some serious nanny-state 
stuff that will only breed resentment. 
No kidding. 
Consider resentment being magnified 
right here on the floor of the House of 
Representatives. We are absolutely 
sick and tired of it. So are the Amer-
ican people. This sham of an institu-
tion is doing nothing for the American 
people. Nothing for the betterment of 
the people that send their Representa-
tives here. 
I just met this morning with an orga-
nization that tries to take care of peo-
ple from human trafficking; met with 
an elected official from Mexico while 
cartels are raping and pillaging and 
killing. And we have people infected 
with COVID coming across our south-
ern border into Texas. And you all put 
masks, masks up front here? Here in 
the people’s House? We have got to go 
around and see, okay, I can’t come to 
the floor, I can’t execute my constitu-
tional duty unless I wear a mask. 
Which is it, vaccines or masks? Do 
the vaccines work or don’t they work? 
Do the masks work or don’t they work? 
I would like to know which it is. I 
would like Dr. Fauci to come down and 
answer a single question about natural 
immunity. If you have been infected 
with the virus, do you have immunity? 
Or are they just going to go around 
poking people saying: You must take a 
vaccine. Oh, but sorry, the vaccine 
doesn’t work. You must wear a mask. 
This institution is a sham, and we 
should adjourn and shut this place 
down. 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I just remind folks that 
the Members of the House who are on 
the floor today are working very hard 
to make sure that we pass appropria-
tions to support the American people, 
to create jobs, to make America safe, 
to make our interests around the world 
known. 
I do want to talk a little bit about 
making our communities safer, be-
cause there are substantial resources 
in the appropriations bill to do just 
that, providing resources for local law 
enforcement who are facing a period of 
great challenge: $360 million for Byrne 
Justice Assistance Grants; $156.5 mil-
lion for COPS hiring grants, it takes 
concrete actions and provides resources 
for meaningful police reform initia-
tives, including requiring recipients of 
Federal law enforcement funding to 
comply 
with 
requirements 
in 
the 
George Floyd Justice in Policing Act; 
provides $100 million for community- 
based violence intervention initiatives; 
addresses the epidemic of gun violence 
in the United States with $100 million 
to strengthen the National Instant 
Criminal Background Check System; 
$40 million to incentivize States to es-
tablish or refine red flag and gun li-
censing laws; and $10 million to develop 
and expand gun buy-back and relin-
quishment programs. 
We are working very, very hard, Mr. 
Speaker. We are trying to move ahead 
for the American people who have been 
through one of the most difficult times 
in the history of our country, in the 
history of the world, a pandemic which 
has killed hundreds of thousands of 
Americans. We do see rising rates of in-
fection. If you look at and do the cor-
relation of those States who have the 
lowest vaccination rates, that is where 
the greatest numbers of those infec-
tions are occurring. 
And we are working hard. We are try-
ing to move forward an agenda that 
will serve all Americans from a public 
health perspective, from an economic 
recovery perspective, and how to move 
forward and build this country back 
better and make sure that all people in 
America, every American citizen has 
the right, the opportunity, the poten-
tial to meet their dreams and aspira-
tions. 
That is our work before the House, 
and we are not going to be distracted. 
We are not going to be taken down the 
proverbial rabbit hole. We have work 
to do, and that is the work before the 
House. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON), my good 
friend. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, to 
comment on my Democrat colleague’s 
comments that they are just trying to 
build America back better, nobody in 
the United States of America in their 
right mind believes that what is hap-
pening in this country—the disastrous 
economic policies, the spike in crime 
in the neighborhoods from sea to shin-
ing sea, the chaos that burns out of 
control at the border—believes that 
you are trying to make America bet-
ter. 
I associate myself with the com-
ments of Representative ROY from the 
Lone Star State. It is absurd for us to 
be 
mandating 
and 
restricting 
the 
American people when we have hun-
dreds of thousands of people pouring 
into this country, and in the last 2 
weeks we had a 900 percent increase in 
COVID-positive people illegally cross-
ing our sovereign border into the 
United States. 
We can’t take anybody seriously, not 
the President, and with all due respect, 
not our colleagues who think they are 
trying to make our country better, 
stronger, and safer. That is just absurd. 
It is ridiculous. 
I can hardly get through my com-
ments about the appropriations on ac-
count of some of this rhetoric that is 
empty. It is absolutely hollow in the 
ears of those who hear it who live on 
the border and who are experiencing 
the devastating effects; not the least of 
which are the poor, vulnerable people 
who are coming over here and paying a 
high price by the cartels who we, be-
cause of the policies of this administra-
tion, are enriching and empowering 
every day. 
I rise in strong opposition and great 
concern as a result of the proposed 
massive 
and 
irresponsible 
spending 
bills that reflect, Mr. Speaker, the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4104 
July 28, 2021 
Democrats’ insatiable desire to expand 
the Federal Government beyond rec-
ognition, beyond the recognition not 
only of our Founders, but of our citi-
zens here today, and to, once again, 
jam through their partisan priorities. 
These spending levels are beyond fis-
cally unsustainable. They are going to 
push us to the brink of bankruptcy, 
into a place where we can see the sov-
ereign debt crisis from the precipice 
upon which we stand. We won’t be able 
to print money or borrow to bail out of 
that crisis, Mr. Speaker. 
American families have worked hard. 
They have made sacrifices, tightening 
up their belts. And by the way, dealing 
with the every-man tax of inflation 
while our Democrat colleagues con-
tinue to push these massive spending 
bills. It is completely irresponsible. 
It is unbelievable that my Democrat 
colleagues would ask the American 
people for a 21 percent pay raise, $100 
billion. The White House wants a 40 
percent pay raise for the crimes fight, 
for the chaos at the border, for the in-
flation, for the fact that their policies 
have locked people into unemploy-
ment, and the policies they are pro-
posing will trap them in poverty for 
the rest of their lives, and generations 
to follow. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield an additional 1 minute to my 
good friend. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, aside 
from the insulting disregard for our na-
tional debt for our children and grand-
children, this is the greatest threat. It 
is not the existential threats. It is our 
insatiable appetite to expand the gov-
ernment, government’s power, and the 
costs associated. 
If these bills, these supposed funding 
bills are enacted, here are the policies 
that will follow: 
Abortion providers will be funded and 
abortion, and the abortion manufactur-
ers that abort, terminate unborn chil-
dren at a rate of almost 1,000 a day. 
Allow illegal immigrants to receive 
our tax dollar financial aid and Federal 
employment. What a disrespect to the 
law-abiding American citizens. 
Choke out our ag and energy pro-
ducers with extreme environmental 
policies, disrupt the supply chain, un-
dermine our ag and energy independ-
ence. 
The list is too long, Mr. Speaker. 
Give contraceptives to students with-
out parental knowledge. 
Fund sex changes at the VA. 
These are the priorities, these are the 
values reflected in the budget of my 
colleagues? 
Mr. Speaker, this is a radical re-
imagination of government’s role in 
the life of its citizens and a drastic de-
parture from America’s values and in-
terests, and I oppose it. I pray to God 
I can get a Democrat to oppose it. I 
doubt it. 
MOTION TO ADJOURN 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I offer a privi-
leged motion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will report the motion. 
The Clerk read as follows:

journ.

question is on the motion to adjourn 
offered by the gentleman from Texas

The question was taken; and the 
Speaker announced that the noes ap-
peared to have it. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, on that I de-
mand the yeas and nays.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New York has 6 minutes 
remaining. The gentleman from Penn-
sylvania has 31⁄2 minutes remaining. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. Speaker, the three bills made in 
order by today’s rules are overfunded 
to the expense of our Nation’s military. 
They strip longstanding bipartisan pro-
visions and include far left, radical poi-
son pills, they will not be taken up by 
the Senate, and they will not become 
law. 
Given the looming September 30 
deadline to fund the government, I 
would just hope that my colleagues, 
my liberal colleagues across the aisle, 
would work with Republicans to craft a 
bipartisan appropriation measure that 
can make it to the President’s desk. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous question and 
‘‘no’’ on the rule. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
I note a great irony. We face enor-
mous challenges in our country and in 
our world. But the Members who refuse 
to wear masks on the floor in the face 
of rising infections of a deadly delta 
variant, particularly in States with 
low vaccination rates, respond to all of 
this by making a motion to adjourn, to 
go home, to quit, to stop working. How 
ironic. 
My father, who was a proud pipe-
fitter, Local 13, back in Rochester, New 
York, said, You never quit. You never 
quit until the job is done. 
Mr. Speaker, in addition to not quit-
ting, I note another irony. My col-
leagues across the aisle are suddenly 
troubled by deficits. Never mind that 
nearly $2 trillion has been added to the 
national debt by cutting the taxes of 
billionaires. Aiding the rich, but not 
investing in the lives of middle class 
and working Americans? We reject that 
notion entirely. 
Mr. Speaker, many of my Republican 
colleagues speaking on the rule today 
painted a dystopian view of our coun-
try. Yes, we have challenges: a climate 
crisis, a public health crisis, economic 
concerns, and great racial inequities. 
That is why the investments we are 
proposing are so critically important 
today. 
But, 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
reject 
the 
dystopian view. I believe America is 
the greatest country in the history of 
humankind, and my colleagues, we 
share an optimistic view. We want to 
invest in an America where everyone 
has a chance to realize their potential, 
and to achieve their dreams. 
We want to invest our resources and 
energies to create a safer, more secure, 
more prosperous world, and to strive 
mightily to build a more perfect union. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on 
the rule and the previous question. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mr. RESCHENTHALER is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION H. RES. 
567 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 13. Immediately upon adoption of this 
resolution, the House shall proceed to the 
consideration in the House of the bill (H.R. 
471) to prohibit the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services from lessening the strin-
gency of, and to prohibit the Secretary of 
Homeland Security from ceasing or lessening 
implementation of, the COVID–19 border 
health provisions through the end of the 
COVID–19 pandemic, and for other purposes. 
All points of order against consideration of 
the bill are waived. The bill shall be consid-
ered as read. All points of order against pro-
visions in the bill are waived. The previous 
question shall be considered as ordered on 
the bill and on any amendment thereto to 
final passage without intervening motion ex-
cept: (1) one hour of debate equally divided 
and controlled by the chair and ranking mi-
nority member of the Committee on Energy 
and Commerce; and (2) one motion to recom-
mit. 
SEC. 14. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not 
apply to the consideration of H.R. 471. 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time, and I 
move the previous question on the res-
olution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
BROWN). The question is on ordering 
the previous question. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 217, nays 
208, not voting 5, as follows:

(A) such foreign government or entity has an

tions at least 15 days prior to exercising the au-
thority of this subsection with regard to any for-

ARAB LEAGUE BOYCOTT OF ISRAEL 
SEC. 7036. It is the sense of the Congress 
that—

peace in the region and to United States invest-
ment and trade in the Middle East and North 
Africa; 
(2) the Arab League boycott, which was re-
grettably reinstated in 1997, should be imme-
diately and publicly terminated, and the Cen-
tral Office for the Boycott of Israel immediately 
disbanded; 
(3) all Arab League states should normalize 
relations with their neighbor Israel; 
(4) the President and the Secretary of State 
should continue to vigorously oppose the Arab 
League boycott of Israel and find concrete steps 
to demonstrate that opposition by, for example, 
taking into consideration the participation of 
any recipient country in the boycott when de-
termining to sell weapons to said country; and 
(5) the President should report to Congress 
annually on specific steps being taken by the 
United States to encourage Arab League states 
to normalize their relations with Israel to bring 
about the termination of the Arab League boy-
cott of Israel, including those to encourage al-
lies and trading partners of the United States to 
enact laws prohibiting businesses from com-
plying with the boycott and penalizing busi-
nesses that do comply.

Bank and Gaza, including the dismantling of

working with other countries in the region to 
vigorously pursue efforts to establish a just, 
lasting, and comprehensive peace in the Middle 
East that will enable Israel and an independent 
Palestinian state to exist within the context of 
full and normal relationships, which should in-
clude—

chairwoman of this critically impor-
tant subcommittee. Indeed, it is an 
honor to be entrusted with the respon-
sibility of managing the SFOPS bill 
which has been a key component of 
United States foreign policy since 
World War II. 
The resources provided in this bill 
are based on the fundamental gen-
erosity of the American people, but 
they also protect and advance our na-
tional security, economic prosperity, 
and global leadership. I commend the 
Biden-Harris administration and our 
chair, ROSA DELAURO, for recognizing 
the importance of the State and For-
eign Operations budget, and I urge my 
colleagues to follow suit by supporting 
this bill. 
With unprecedented levels of human 
suffering and so many complicated 
challenges around the world, the bill 
rightfully increases funding for global 
health and the prevention of future 
pandemics and for migration, refugee, 
and disaster assistance, and continues 
our support for key allies and partner 
organizations such as the United Na-
tions. These are just a few of many 
ways the SFOPS bill meets urgent hu-
manitarian needs, many of which have 
been exacerbated by the COVID–19 pan-
demic. 
The COVID pandemic has caused sig-
nificant economic and social harm. 
That is why the development invest-
ments in this bill are especially crucial 
as we strive to achieve the Sustainable 
Development Goals by 2030, including 
eliminating extreme poverty, achiev-
ing an AIDS-free generation, and sup-
porting efforts to build inclusive, equi-
table, and accountable societies for ev-
eryone. 
Now, let me address directly some of 
the questions I have heard about what 
the SFOPS bill does and does not in-
clude. 
To my friends who focus, as I do, on 
women’s global health, the fiscal year 
2022 SFOPS bill substantially increases 
funding for bilateral family planning 
for the first time in a decade to $760 
million, which is an $185 million in-
crease over last year. It also more than 
doubles our contribution to UNFPA to 
$70 million, which we know was com-
pletely 
cut 
off 
and 
politically 
scapegoated during the previous ad-
ministration. 
Just as important, the bill does not 
include previous years’ policy riders 
like the harmful Helms amendment 
and the global gag rule which only 
served to undercut our programs’ effec-
tiveness and ability to provide women, 
especially women of color, around the 
world with comprehensive healthcare. 
To our friends committed to fighting 
the climate crisis, this year’s SFOPS 
bill provides a $1.6 billion contribution 
to the Green Climate Fund, which is 
the first direct appropriation that this 
House has provided for the fund. Along 
with an additional $1.4 billion for our 
other environmental programs, this 
bill invests $3 billion to combat the cli-
mate crisis which will help ensure that 
the United States resumes its leader-
ship in this global fight and work in 
partnership with other countries. 
To my friends who have requested in-
creased funding for our own hemi-
sphere, this year’s bill includes a 25 
percent increase for the Caribbean, in-
cluding $10 million in new funding for 
projects in the Caribbean to promote 
inclusive economic growth.

The bill also includes $350 million 
more than last year for assistance to 
Central America, which is urgently 
needed in the Northern Triangle, to ad-
dress the root causes of migration and 
to help combat corruption and impu-
nity which are so endemic among local 
government officials. We all have met 
and are haunted by the experiences 
that migrants have conveyed to us de-
spite all the odds about their dan-
gerous journey across Mexico. We must 
do better so that the United States 
border is not their last and best hope 
for survival. That is why the House bill 
makes targeted investments in local 
communities through trusted NGOs 
while holding national governments 
accountable. 
The bill also provides critical support 
for vulnerable communities in Africa 
and upholds our abiding commitments 
to the security of our allies, such as 
Israel, Jordan, Ukraine, and Colombia. 
Many of our partners continue to 
struggle with growing economic chal-
lenges at home resulting from conflicts 
in their region, migration, and the im-
pact of COVID–19. 
The SFOPS bill and report make 
clear our support for a two-state solu-
tion to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, 
and we have increased assistance to the 
Palestinian people by $150 million over 
last year’s bill and eased the burden-
some requirements on the administra-
tion’s ability to contribute to UNRWA. 
Crucially, and of great importance to 
me, the bill also helps ensure that our 
Nation’s diplomatic and development 
workforce reflects the diversity of the 
American people by increasing funding 
and providing authority and guidance 
to equip the Secretary of State and 
USAID administrator to make mean-
ingful progress in increasing diversity 
and inclusion in the Nation’s inter-
national affairs workforce. 
Lastly, to my friends who passion-
ately advocate for human rights, de-
mocracy, and the rule of law, I share 
your 
goals 
and 
your 
values. 
The 
SFOPS bill may not solve all of the 
world’s problems, but it certainly 
makes new and significant gains on 
many different fronts. We include new 
oversight and accountability require-
ments on our security assistance which 
will better align such aid with our na-
tional security policy before it is pro-
vided, and we provide support to civil 
society leaders around the world who 
are making their communities and so-
cieties more equitable and inclusive. 
We also include $18 million for the 
Tibetan people. I especially want to 
thank our Speaker and good friend, 
Chairman MCGOVERN, for their work on 
this issue. 
I have many more examples, but my 
time is limited. I will conclude by urg-
ing my colleagues to consider the very 
positive and considerable progress we 
have made in this year’s SFOPS bill in 
reversing the devastating consequences 
from the last administration’s foreign 
policy failures. Restoring American 
credibility and leadership on the world 
stage is no easy task, but this bill 
makes unequivocal commitments to di-
plomacy and development in addition 
to improving the lives and livelihoods 
of millions of people around the world. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask your support of 
the SFOPS bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1415 
Mr. 
ROGERS 
of 
Kentucky. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
I rise in opposition to the bill. At the 
outset, though, I want to congratulate 
our subcommittee chair on shepherding 
her very first bill to the House floor. 
The bill before us provides $62.2 billion 
for the Department of State, Foreign 
Operations, 
and 
Related 
Programs. 
That is a 12 percent increase, Mr. 
Speaker, over the fiscal year 2021 en-
acted level. 
The bill provides important funding 
for our national security, including $3.3 
billion for Israel. The recent conflict 
between Israel and Hamas, and the 
looming shadow of Hezbollah and Iran, 
remind us all of the threats Israel faces 
to its security every day. 
The fighting in Gaza stopped when it 
did, in part, due to the diplomatic ef-
forts of Egypt. As Secretary of State 
Blinken told the committee, Egypt was 
vital to helping arrange the cease-fire 
and remains an essential partner for 
the United States in the region— 
Egypt. 
While the bill maintains funding for 
Egypt at the current level, I strongly 
disagree with the additional conditions 
that this bill places on Egypt. 
The bill continues critical funding 
for Jordan, supports countries facing 
Russian aggression, and provides re-
sources to meet our commitments in 
the Indo-Pacific, including $300 million 
for the Countering Chinese Influence 
Fund. 
The bill provides funding for Colom-
bia, our good ally and friend, at last 
year’s level. This is a critical moment 
for that country, and we should be 
doing all we can to support them. How-
ever, I regret that new conditions that 
this bill places could undermine our 
counternarcotics efforts, which are 
critical in Colombia. 
Our programs there are in our own 
self-interest, 
especially 
given 
the 
amount of cocaine that still floods 
American streets and causes so much 
destruction in our communities back 
home. 
Another drug problem sowing chaos 
back home is the opioid epidemic. The 
bill includes new language that directs 
the State Department to expand their 
current efforts to tackle the opioid cri-
sis and better address this terrible 
problem. 
Mr. Speaker, I wish I could stop there 
and say this is a good bill. Unfortu-
nately, the spending increases outside 
of these critical areas are just too 
great, and the policy riders are too ex-
treme. 
First and foremost are changes made 
to the longstanding measures that pro-
tect the sanctity of life. These are com-
monsense provisions that have enjoyed 
bipartisan support for decades. Of 
greatest concern is the removal of the 
most 
important 
condition 
in 
any 
State-Foreign Operations bill, that no 
funds can be used to pay for abortion. 
The removal of that language is un-
precedented, but it doesn’t stop there. 
The bill also includes a permanent 
prohibition of the Mexico City policy, 
weakens the Kemp-Kasten restrictions 
on coercive abortion, and increases 
funding to the U.N., among many other 
controversial changes. 
Another tough pill for the American 
taxpayer to swallow is the more than 
$3 billion included in this bill for envi-
ronmental programs that bring a high 
potential 
for 
duplication, 
wasteful 
complexity, and substantial oversight 
challenges. 
The bill also increases funding for 
the United Nations and other inter-
national organizations while ignoring 
the need for long-overdue and des-
perately needed reforms. 
The absence of conditions on the 
World Health Organization is particu-
larly concerning, given what we all 
know about their complicity in cov-
ering up the COVID–19 outbreak. 
Despite some areas of agreement, the 
unrestrained spending and unprece-
dented partisan riders require that I 
oppose this legislation. I, therefore, 
urge my colleagues to oppose this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Connecticut (Ms. DELAURO), our 
very distinguished chair who serves for 
the first time this year as the chair of 
the Appropriations Committee and has 
done a phenomenal job in helping us 
get this bill to the floor. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman. With both of us, this 
is a maiden voyage, so it is wonderful 
to be with her. I thank her for the work 
that she has done. 
I thank our ranking member as well 
for the work on this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, the past 4 years have 
seriously eroded our Nation’s position 
in the world. Under President Trump, 
our government was more disruptive 
than constructive and more absent 
than present on the world stage. This 
has been especially true in the midst of 
the worst public health and economic 
crisis in a generation. 
President Biden has made it clear 
that America is back. The State, For-
eign Operations, and Related Programs 
funding bill puts those words into ac-
tion. It makes America stronger at 
home and respected again in the world. 
It restores American leadership by re-
sponding to global health threats, in-
cluding the ongoing coronavirus pan-
demic. It addresses urgent humani-
tarian needs while confronting the cli-
mate crisis. 
As we speak, the global pandemic is 
far from over. Around the world, we are 
still seeing over 400,000 new cases per

day and over 8,000 deaths. To confront 
this continuing crisis, this bill invests 
in global health and the prevention of 
future pandemics with $10.6 billion to 
support the health of families and glob-
al communities, including $1 billion in 
global health security to bolster the 
public health surveillance, detection, 
and response capabilities of countries 
around the world. 
Given the global economic devasta-
tion wrought by the pandemic, this bill 
provides $8.5 billion to meet urgent hu-
manitarian needs. It empowers women 
to build a brighter future for their fam-
ilies and communities by providing $760 
million for family planning and $70 
million for the United Nations Popu-
lation Fund while repealing the restric-
tions that make it more difficult for 
women across the world to access safe 
and legal abortions. 
Finally, this bill prepares us for the 
existential threat of climate change. It 
provides more than $3 billion to ad-
dress the climate crisis and other envi-
ronmental programs, including $1.6 bil-
lion for the Green Climate Fund. 
With this bill, we are proving that 
America is back and ready to confront 
the biggest challenges facing our Na-
tion and the world. 
I thank Chairwoman LEE
for her 
work, and I urge support for the bill. 
Mr. 
ROGERS 
of 
Kentucky. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Texas (Ms. GRANGER), 
the ranking member of the Appropria-
tions Committee. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong opposition to H.R. 4373, 
the fiscal year 2022 State-Foreign Oper-
ations appropriations bill. 
This bill has many fatal flaws, in 
spite of Republican efforts to improve 
it. The concerns raised during markup 
were not addressed, and many of the 
amendments we offered at the Rules 
Committee have not been made in 
order on the floor today. 
I will begin with our list of major 
complaints. To put it simply, the 
spending level is too high, and the poli-
cies are too controversial. 
This bill alone includes a 12 percent 
increase over current levels, with $3 
billion directed into climate change 
programs like the Green Climate Fund. 
For the sake of generations to come, 
we can’t afford to spend like this. 
In 
addition 
to 
these 
unrealistic 
spending levels, the majority has made 
policy decisions that will complicate 
any attempts to come to a bipartisan 
agreement. 
Most concerning, this bill includes 
alarming changes to longstanding lan-
guage to protect the unborn. Language 
that prohibits foreign aid from being 
used to pay for abortions was dropped 
entirely. 
The bill also includes other con-
troversial changes, such as a perma-
nent repeal of the Mexico City policy, 
which prohibits organizations who re-
ceive 
foreign 
assistance 
from 
per-
forming abortions. 
As the former chair of this sub-
committee, I am very disappointed to 
see lifesaving global health activities 
put in jeopardy because of partisan pol-
itics. We must develop top-line spend-
ing levels that both sides can support, 
and we must agree to drop controver-
sial policy provisions. 
If we want to avoid a long-term con-
tinuing resolution or, worse, a govern-
ment shutdown, we must get serious 
and do the work our constituents sent 
us here to do. I urge my colleagues to 
vote against this bill. 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from 
Florida 
(Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ), my good friend. 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
yielding, and I congratulate the gentle-
woman on presenting her first bill as a 
cardinal on the Appropriations Com-
mittee. This is a long time coming, and 
it is a pleasure to work with her. 
The bill invests in health and upholds 
American global values abroad. 
The fiscal year 2022 State-Foreign 
Operations appropriations bill, in a his-
toric move, removes the Helms amend-
ment, which has prohibited safe abor-
tions and healthcare services for poor 
and vulnerable women in low-income 
countries for decades. That is a signifi-
cant decision and one that enables ac-
cess to healthcare for millions of 
women across the globe. 
I am pleased that this bill includes 
language to support countries, like Co-
lombia, 
who 
have 
welcomed 
Ven-
ezuelans fleeing the humanitarian cri-
sis. It also funds prodemocracy and 
human rights programs in Venezuela, 
as well as in Cuba. This funding is crit-
ical to ensure access to broadcasting 
and the internet in Cuba. These plat-
forms will provide support to the 
Cuban people as they struggle for free-
dom and true self-governance. 
Finally, this bill continues support 
for the critical U.S.-Israel partnership 
by fully funding U.S. security assist-
ance to Israel and cooperative missile 
defense programs. Ensuring that Israel 
maintains 
her 
qualitative 
military 
edge is essential for stability in the 
Middle East and our own national secu-
rity. 
I truly thank Chairwoman LEE for 
working closely with me and others on 
this bill. 
As we always say in the Appropria-
tions Committee, Mr. Speaker, the 
spending decisions that we make are an 
expression of our values. This bill tele-
graphs that expression of our values, of 
America’s values, and the strengths 
that we have, at the same time pro-
viding us the ability to provide assist-
ance to millions of vulnerable people 
across the globe. I am proud to support 
it and to work with Chairwoman LEE 
going forward so we can see it become 
law. 
Mr. 
ROGERS 
of 
Kentucky. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr. SMITH). 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, by executive order, President 
Biden reversed the Protecting Life in 
Global Health Assistance policy, which 
was a reiteration and expansion of 
President Ronald Reagan’s Mexico City 
policy. Announced by Ronald Reagan 
at a U.N. conference on population 
growth in Mexico City in 1984, hence its 
name, the policy was designed to en-
sure that U.S. taxpayer money was not 
funneled to foreign, nongovernmental 
organizations that perform or promote 
abortion. 
My amendment, which was not made 
in order, would have inserted new text 
that reinstates the Mexico City policy 
which was rendered inoperative by the 
President, and it also would have taken 
out new pro-abortion language that 
says that no President in the future 
can promulgate any iteration of the 
Mexico City policy. 
b 1430 
The Mexico City policy established 
pro-life safeguards; benign, humane 
conditions on global health assistance. 
For years, foreign nongovernmental or-
ganizations have been subsided and em-
powered by taxpayer funds—and let’s 
not forget, this is grant money—to 
weaken, undermine, or reverse pro-life 
laws in other nations, especially in Af-
rica, and to destroy the precious lives 
of unborn children. 
The Mexico City policy mitigates 
U.S. taxpayer complicity in global 
abortion and underscores our deep 
commitment to protecting the weak 
and most vulnerable. 
According to a recent Marist poll, 77 
percent of Americans are opposed to 
using tax moneys to pay for abortions 
in other countries. Only 19 percent sup-
port it. 
The Marist poll found that 55 percent 
of Democrats, 85 percent of Independ-
ents, and 95 percent of Republicans 
were against using taxpayer funds to 
pay for abortions in other countries. 
U.S. foreign assistance, Mr. Speaker, 
and foreign entities that we fund with 
billions of dollars of grant money 
should consistently affirm, care for, 
and tangibly assist women and all chil-
dren—all children, including unborn 
babies—regardless of their age or con-
dition of dependency. 
Second, Mr. Speaker, since 1973, the 
Helms amendment has prohibited using 
taxpayer funds to directly pay for abor-
tions in other countries. Helms is the 
Hyde amendment for the rest of the 
world. The bill before us today, how-
ever, completely reverses the Helms 
amendment. 
I had offered in Rules a second 
amendment that would have reinstated 
Helms. It was not made in order. 
Taxpayers should not be forced to 
pay for child dismemberment, includ-
ing severing arms and legs and actual 
decapitation of the baby with sharp 
knives, or deadly poisons or drugs like 
RU–486, which starves the baby to 
death. 
Children alive but not yet born who 
are killed by abortion after 20 weeks or 
later experience excruciating suffering 
and pain. And until they are rendered

unconscious or dead by these hideous 
procedures, the baby feels the pain of 
every cut. 
Years ago, Senator Biden said, and he 
wrote to constituents, that opposition 
to abortion funding would: ‘‘Protect 
both the woman and her unborn child.’’ 
He said: ‘‘Those of us who are op-
posed to abortion’’—again this is Joe 
Biden—‘‘should not be compelled to 
pay for them.’’ 
Finally, my amendment on the U.N. 
Population Fund was not made in 
order, as my good friend and colleague 
HAROLD ROGERS had said, this legisla-
tion weakens the Kemp-Kasten lan-
guage significantly. 
I would point out to my colleagues— 
because I offered the first amendment 
on this floor back in 1984 on the com-
plicity of the U.N. Population Fund in 
forced abortion and forced sterilization 
in China. For over four decades, the 
U.N. Population Fund has vigorously 
supported, funded, defended, promoted, 
even 
celebrated 
the Chinese Com-
munist Party’s coercive population 
control program. 
I met with the head of the Chinese 
program, Peng Peiyun, back in 1991 in 
Beijing, almost a 3-hour meeting. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. 
ROGERS 
of 
Kentucky. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute 
to the gentleman from New Jersey. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, Peng Peiyun told me over and 
over again, there is no coercion in the 
Chinese program, even though every-
one who has followed it knows that 
there is, because she said the UNFPA 
was there, on the ground whitewashing 
and falsifying the truth. 
We are missing maybe 60 million fe-
males, women of all ages now, because 
it has been a systematic extermination 
of the girl child in China. It is one of 
the reasons why human sex trafficking 
has exploded in China, because the girl 
child has been killed, exterminated, 
and the UNFPA has been at best silent 
on that issue, again, giving the Chinese 
Communist Party a clean bill of 
health. 
Doubling the amount of money that 
was in previous bills from $35 million 
to $70 million while simultaneously 
weakening 
Kemp-Kasten 
trivializes 
these crimes against women and these 
crimes against children. 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I 
would just like to respond to the gen-
tleman from New Jersey and read a 
section of this bill. 
It says: ‘‘None of the funds made 
available in this Act nor any unobli-
gated balances from prior appropria-
tions Acts may be made available to 
any organization or program which, as 
determined by the President of the 
United States, directly supports or par-
ticipates in the management of a pro-
gram of coercive abortion or involun-
tary sterilization: Provided, That any 
determination made pursuant to this 
paragraph must be made not later than 
6 months after the date of enactment 
of this Act, and must be accompanied 
by the evidence and criteria utilized to 
make the determination: Provided fur-
ther, That none of the funds made 
available under this Act may be used 
to lobby for or against abortion.’’ 
Finally, I will just say that Hart Re-
search recently conducted a poll of 
Americans across the political spec-
trum and found that over 60 percent of 
the American public supports reproduc-
tive freedom for women. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from California (Mrs. 
TORRES), who serves as a very valued 
member of the State, Foreign Oper-
ations, and Related Programs Sub-
committee and has had tremendous 
input into this bill. 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in support of this legis-
lation, and I thank Congresswoman 
DELAURO
and Chairwoman LEE
for 
their hard work and support of the pri-
orities that I have included in this bill 
as it relates to the Central American 
region. 
We must ensure our aid to Central 
America helps the people it is intended 
to help and advance our policy goals, 
including reducing migration. 
My Republican colleagues yesterday 
noted that what we have done in the 
past is not working and has not 
worked, and I agree with them 100 per-
cent. 
The Trump administration turned a 
blind eye to corruption in the region 
and emboldened predatory, corrupt 
government officials. 
For the last 4 years, we effectively 
looked at the symptoms and not at the 
systematic failures that forced the re-
gion’s most vulnerable asset, their 
young people, to flee to our border. 
So 
if 
Guatemalan 
President 
Giammattei truly does believe in the 
rule of law, he should show us with his 
actions. Recently, they have fired 
Francisco Sandoval. He needs to be re-
instated. The Guatemalan people in 
Guatemala deserve a judicial sector 
and leaders with his credibility to ad-
vance his cases of corruption. 
I am so glad to report that my prior-
ities in this bill include restricting 75 
percent of the funding that has gone to 
all three governments—El Salvador, 
Honduras, and Guatemala—to ensure 
that the money is actually reaching 
the people that it is intended. 
Furthermore, we have never in the 
past restricted or put conditions on 
funding to their attorney general’s of-
fice. In this bill, we have included an 
amendment that restricts all funding 
to the attorney general. 
Our goal here is to reduce migration 
and to ensure that the young people in 
the region can see a future for them-
selves and take their governments 
back. 
Mr. Speaker, I support this bill. I 
thank our brand new congresswoman 
and her staff for the hard work that she 
has put before us in this committee. 
Mr. 
ROGERS 
of 
Kentucky. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Indiana 
(Mrs. 
WALORSKI). 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to once again stand for life and 
to prevent American taxpayers from 
paying for abortion services overseas. 
Americans should never be forced to 
fund 
abortions 
against 
their 
con-
science, period. 
I have long supported the Hyde 
amendment, which prohibits taxpayer 
funding from paying for abortions do-
mestically. Yesterday, I proudly spoke 
in support of this key pro-life protec-
tion, which the Democrats stripped 
from these appropriations packages. 
Now, Democrats are trying to force 
Americans to foot the bill for abortions 
abroad. For decades, the Helms amend-
ment has prohibited abortion services 
from being included in our Nation’s 
foreign aid. 
Driven by a radical agenda, Demo-
crats and the Biden administration 
have removed this longstanding, com-
monsense prohibition from the State 
and Foreign Operations bill on the 
floor today. 
To 
make 
it 
clear, 
congressional 
Democrats and the Biden administra-
tion are trying to force the American 
taxpayer to fund abortions in foreign 
nations. 
The facts are on our side. Seventy- 
seven percent of Americans oppose 
using taxpayer dollars for this purpose. 
It is deeply disappointing, but not sur-
prising, that Democrats are continuing 
to attack our pro-life values and Amer-
icans’ fundamental conscience rights. 
Taxpayers in Indiana and around the 
country should never be forced to 
bankroll abortion services here at 
home, and we most certainly should 
not be forced to bankroll abortions 
abroad. 
This is a dangerous path of destruc-
tion. I urge my colleagues to oppose 
the bill. 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
ROGERS 
of 
Kentucky. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Louisiana (Mr. SCALISE), 
the Republican whip. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong opposition to the bill, but I spe-
cifically want to talk about a provision 
that is being gutted that for decades 
has been bipartisan, Mr. Speaker, that 
is the Hyde amendment. 
Back in the 1970s, when Henry Hyde 
came to Congress from Illinois, one of 
his main objectives was to protect life. 
He started on a quest to do that on a 
number of different fronts, and he ulti-
mately found a bipartisan consensus 
put into law back in 1976 to say that no 
taxpayer funds should be used for abor-
tion. It was actually something that 
Republicans 
and 
Democrats 
rallied 
around. 
Since that time, every appropriations 
bill that has moved through Congress, 
for over 40 years, has included Hyde 
protections, until today. 
This is a sad day when you see how 
the Democratic Party has changed 
from the party back then.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4144 
July 28, 2021 
I want to read a quote, Mr. Speaker. 
This is from 1994. A prominent United 
States Senator said: ‘‘Those of us who 
are opposed to abortion should not be 
compelled to pay for them.’’ 
You know who said that? Joe Biden 
said that, Mr. Speaker. 
Where is that Joe Biden today? 
Where is that Democratic Party today 
that has changed and moved so far 
away from those principles that were 
bipartisan? By the way, most Ameri-
cans today, including many people who 
consider themselves pro-choice, think 
it is wrong to use taxpayer funds for 
abortion. Yet, this bill guts that dec-
ades-long tradition. 
Again, I will read from Joe Biden 
himself. ‘‘Those of us who are opposed 
to abortion should not be compelled to 
pay for them.’’ 
Why would we be abandoning that 
decades-long tradition that is also held 
by most Americans across this coun-
try? 
Not only, Mr. Speaker, are they gut-
ting Hyde protections in this bill, they 
actually put millions of taxpayer dol-
lars in this bill to fund Planned Par-
enthood facilities. So that is how far 
the party of old on the Democrat side 
has gone, to this Democrat socialist 
party that now supports taxpayer fund-
ing of abortion, including directly to 
the largest provider of abortions in 
America. 
This must stop. We will fight to stop 
the gutting of the Hyde amendment 
and the break from this bipartisan tra-
dition. 
Before this process is over, let’s get 
back to those principles that unite 
most Americans and should unite all of 
us in Congress, that no taxpayer funds 
should go to provide for abortions. 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
b 1445 
Mr. 
ROGERS 
of 
Kentucky. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr. SMITH). 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, this needs to be clarified for 
all Members who are listening. 
The Kemp-Kasten language—is and 
has been—the law and has been sup-
ported in a bipartisan way for years, 
because we are so unalterably opposed 
to coercive population control. It says 
that we will not support any organiza-
tion that supports or comanages a co-
ercive population control program. The 
new language takes out ‘‘supports and 
comanages’’ and puts direct, ‘‘directly 
involved with abortion.’’ 
China is an absolutely closed society. 
It is run by a dictatorship under Xi 
Jinping. I have chaired 72 congres-
sional hearings over the years on 
human rights in China, and many wit-
nesses were women who have been forc-
ibly abducted. Usually only the ones 
that escape and get here and become 
asylees and get asylum by our law here 
in the United States can speak out 
about it. 
So how will you ever ascertain if it is 
‘‘direct’’ because Xi Jinping is not 
going to let you in to investigate. We 
can’t even get answers on Wuhan, and 
this is even more closed than that, 
quite frankly. 
I do hope Members will realize this is 
a gutting of the Kemp-Kasten lan-
guage. No matter how you feel about 
population control, we should be abso-
lutely opposed to coercion. Nobody 
should be forced. 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
ROGERS 
of 
Kentucky. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I urge a rejection of the bill, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
First of all, let me just say, in re-
sponding to Mr. SMITH, it is really long 
overdue to stop partisan attempts to 
scapegoat and score political points 
over UNFPA. 
The fact remains that UNFPA vigor-
ously opposes any and all coercive 
practices and only supports access to 
safe and voluntary family planning. 
Any suggestion to the contrary is sim-
ply false. 
Mr. Speaker, I am very proud of the 
resources and programs in this bill 
which provide us the unique oppor-
tunity to restore America’s global 
leadership that has been missing in re-
cent years. 
Together we can address the greatest 
challenges facing the United States 
and provide vital support to the world’s 
most vulnerable people. 
I want to take a minute to just thank 
our staffs on both sides of the aisle. As 
a former staffer, I know how these bills 
get put together, the length of time 
that they put in, and the real forth-
right and straight-up honest negotia-
tions, given our differences. I think the 
bill is a very good bipartisan bill, and 
I think it is, in many respects, due to 
our staffs’ relationships and their re-
spect for each other. 
I specifically want to mention Craig 
Higgins and Erin Kolodjeski, Jason 
Wheelock, Jean Kwon, Marin Stein, 
Clelia Alvarado, Lacy Kilraine, Greg 
Adams, of course, in my office and 
Julie Nickson, Susan Adams, Jamie 
McCormick, John Muscolini, and all of 
the members of our staffs that haven’t 
been mentioned, because I know a heck 
of a lot goes into this in terms of our 
support staff day and night and for 
their diligence and their brilliance and 
their respect for the process. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support H.R. 3473. I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, this year’s 
State/Foreign Operations appropriations bill in-
cludes hundreds of billions of dollars in IMF 
giveaways to China, Russia, and state spon-
sors of terrorism. It’s an abomination that the 
spending bill which funds our foreign policy 
priorities writes massive checks for America’s 
adversaries. 
Under this legislation, the Treasury Depart-
ment would be required to support an alloca-
tion of more than one-and-a half trillion Spe-
cial Drawing Rights (SDR)—trillion with a T. 
These SDRs represent no-strings-attached li-
quidity that will be lavished on some of the 
worst regimes in the world. 
The Democrats’ bill would send over $140 
billion in hard currency to the Chinese govern-
ment to use as it wishes. Russia would get its 
hands on nearly $60 billion. State sponsors of 
terrorism like Iran and Syria would find them-
selves with more than $17 billion in support 
that they can use to kill civilians and desta-
bilize the world, while Venezuela and Belarus 
would receive billions more. 
Like last year, House Democrats have in-
cluded these dollars for dictators in the base 
text of this bill so that it can’t be struck. 
They’re so ashamed of financing America’s 
adversaries that they don’t want to require 
their Members’ votes on this issue to be pub-
lic. Perhaps they suspect that their Members 
don’t want billions in hard currency going to 
the Chinese Communist Party, Vladimir Putin, 
and the ayatollahs. 
There are responsible ways to help the 
world address the COVID–19 pandemic with-
out showering billions on genocidal regimes 
and other human rights abusers—this is not it. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired.

OF CALIFORNIA 
Page 224, beginning line 10, strike ‘‘, in-

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 567, the gen-
tlewoman from California (Ms. LEE) 
and the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. 
ROGERS) each will control 10 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California. 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in support of amendments en bloc 
No. 1 and yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Let me just thank my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle for these amend-
ments. Now I would like to yield to the 
gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. ROG-
ERS), our ranking member. I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
ROGERS 
of 
Kentucky. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I claim time in support of the 
amendments, and I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
This amendments en bloc contains a 
number of good proposals by both sides 
of the aisle. I want to highlight just a 
few. 
It includes language offered by the 
gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. HILL) 
and the gentleman from Florida (Mr. 
DEUTCH) to increase funding for the Of-
fice of the Special Presidential Envoy 
for Hostage Affairs. This will help en-
sure that this office has resources we 
need to ensure that U.S. citizens un-
lawfully or wrongfully detained abroad 
receive priority attention from our 
government. 
It also includes a provision supported 
by the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. 
TIFFANY) that is in support of our close 
friend and partner Taiwan. At a time 
when the Chinese Communist Party 
has Taiwan in its crosshairs, we need 
to do all we can to support our demo-
cratic friends on that island. I, there-
fore, urge Members to support the 
amendment, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from North Carolina (Ms. MANNING). 
Ms. MANNING. Mr. Speaker, my 
amendment, amendment No. 5, seeks to 
draw attention to the need to resolve 
the significant delays in passport serv-
ices at the Department of State. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has wreaked 
havoc on international travel. Accord-
ing to the Department of State’s Pass-
port Services, Americans who submit 
new passport applications today may 
not receive their new passports for an-
other 18 weeks, well into the fall. 
Even customers who pay an addi-
tional fee for expedited service may 
not receive their passports for another 
12 weeks. 
In response, the State Department’s 
Passport Services recommends Ameri-
cans planning to travel internationally 
apply for a passport at least 6 months 
in advance. 
These delays are simply unaccept-
able. 
In North Carolina’s Sixth Congres-
sional District, my constituents have 
been unable to travel to visit family, to 
seek important medical care, and to 
conduct important business meetings. 
It is essential that Congress send the 
message loud and clear. We must have 
better service on passports. We need to 
address passport delays so that Ameri-
cans can get their passports in a timely 
manner. 
Mr. 
ROGERS 
of 
Kentucky. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Wisconsin (Mr. TIFFANY). 
Mr. TIFFANY. Mr. Speaker, my 
amendment, which is included in this 
en bloc, would prohibit the use of any 
funds to create, procure, or display any 
map which depicts Taiwan as part of 
the People’s Republic of China. 
This is a commonsense measure. As 
we all know, Taiwan has never been 
part of Communist China. 
The Taiwanese people elect their own 
leaders, raise their own Armed Forces, 
conduct their own foreign policy, and 
maintain their own international trade 
agreements. 
By every measure, Taiwan is a sov-
ereign, democratic, and independent 
country. Any claims to the contrary 
are simply false. 
Since the 1970s, America’s so-called 
One China policy has acknowledged 
Beijing’s bogus argument that Taiwan 
is part of Communist China. 
This is a dishonest policy, and it is 
one that America should abandon. 
While we cannot end this policy with 
my amendment today, we can at least 
require honest maps that stop perpet-
uating the One China lie. 
Communist 
China 
is 
Communist 
China, Mr. Speaker, and Taiwan is Tai-
wan. I ask for a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the 
amendment. 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Virginia (Ms. SPANBERGER). 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Speaker, I 
stand in support of my amendment de-
manding action in response to the Ha-
vana 
syndrome 
incidents 
affecting 
Americans around the world. 
The recent string of mysterious at-
tacks on U.S. diplomats and personnel, 
often called Havana syndrome, is a se-
rious threat to our national security.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4146 
July 28, 2021 
Having spoken directly with individ-
uals impacted, I know these attacks 
are having lasting and detrimental im-
pacts on the health of our Nation’s 
public servants. 
I stand here today to call for a ro-
bust, interagency response, one that 
reflects the severity and urgency of the 
situation. 
The State Department must play an 
active role in this response, share rel-
evant information with Congress, par-
ticularly the House Foreign Affairs 
Committee, and make sure all affected 
personnel receive prompt and appro-
priate care. It is our duty to ensure our 
public servants get the care and an-
swers they deserve. 
As a former Federal employee, I in-
tend to keep pressing the administra-
tion to better protect our diplomats 
and Federal employees serving at home 
and abroad. 
I know firsthand their commitment 
to their missions, their devotion to our 
country, and the promises we have 
made to them. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
this cause. 
Mr. 
ROGERS 
of 
Kentucky. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. SPEIER). 
Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of my amendment to highlight 
the urgent humanitarian crisis in Af-
ghanistan. 
We have taken action with the AL-
LIES legislation to make sure that the 
persons who have assisted us as drivers 
and interpreters find a pathway to free-
dom, but conditions for others are 
quite trying at this time. 
Conditions for women, civil society, 
journalists, human rights defenders, 
and others continue to deteriorate, 
with vulnerable Afghans facing threats 
of violence and death, and heightened 
restrictions 
in 
Taliban-controlled 
areas. 
Many Afghans are so terrified for 
their lives and their children’s safety 
that they will not leave their homes. A 
recent wave of targeted slayings, more 
than 700 killed and 540 wounded in 2020, 
represents a 45 percent increase from 
2019. The number of women killed dou-
bled between 2012 and 2020. 
The withdrawal of U.S. troops and 
the raging expansion of Taliban terri-
torial offenses in our wake requires ur-
gent action. Our failure to help those 
who help us and those who are in the 
crosshairs of the Taliban would, frank-
ly, make us complicit in any further 
bloodshed. 
That is why I have introduced this 
amendment, and I am introducing 
today the Improving Access for Afghan 
Refugees Act, to provide vulnerable Af-
ghans with priority 2 refugee status to 
expand access to our refugee system. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
supporting this bill because we do have 
a moral obligation to do so. 
b 1500 
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam 
Speaker, I urge support of the amend-
ment, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I reiterate my support for the 
amendment, and urge my colleagues to 
support it, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of this En Bloc Amendment to H.R. 
4373, the State and Foreign Operations Ap-
propriations Act for FY2022, which incor-
porates Jackson Lee Amendments Nos. 15, 
16, and 17. 
I thank the Rules Committee for making 
these amendments in order and State and 
Foreign 
Operations 
Appropriations 
Sub-
committee Chair DELAURO for including them 
in this En Bloc Amendment. 
Jackson Lee Amendments No. 15 and No. 
16 have been approved several times by the 
relevant subcommittee, made in order by the 
Rules Committee, and adopted by the full 
House; Jackson Lee Amendment No. 17, 
while being offered for the first time, makes a 
very important contribution to the health and 
safety of the global community. 
Jackson Lee Amendment No. 16 will des-
ignate $1,000,000 to combat the trafficking of 
endangered species. 
The amendment makes a good bill better by 
providing a $1 million focus to combat the 
transportation of the remains of endangered 
species, to confront the transport of the re-
mains of killed endangered species. 
The brutal killing of Cecil the lion after being 
lured off a protected preserve was an indica-
tion that we needed to do more to protect en-
dangered species at risk of being killed. 
At that time, I introduced and sought the 
support of my colleagues as original cospon-
sors of my legislation, Cecil the Lion Endan-
gered and Threatened Species Act of 2015. 
This bill sought to strengthen partner coun-
tries’ capacity in , countering wildlife trafficking 
and designating major wildlife countries for 
protection. 
The Jackson Lee Amendment No. 16 is 
again offered in the same spirit: to prohibit the 
taking and transportation of any endangered 
and threatened species as a trophy to the 
United States. 
Currently, the Endangered Species Act does 
not protect most wildlife animals killed. At this 
point, we can choose to make wise decisions 
that will sustain the global population, or we 
can ignore the warning signs. 
Jackson Lee Amendment No. 16 is one that 
the House has strongly supported in the past 
because it would bring greater awareness and 
protection to these beautiful and vital popu-
lations that are too often taken for granted, by 
allowing this amendment to address the 
senseless trafficking in trophy killings of all en-
dangered and threatened species. 
Jackson Lee Amendment No. 15 provides 
funds to be allocated for Global Health Pro-
grams to the fight against the practice of Fe-
male Genital Mutilation. 
I have been a dedicated champion against 
this practice for a long while, working closely 
with former Congressman JOE CROWLEY of 
New York to introduce legislation targeted at 
supporting the elimination of this ludicrous 
practice of mutilating young women. 
Female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) 
comprises all procedures that involve partial or 
total removal of the external female genitalia, 
or other injury to the female genital organs for 
non-medical reasons. 
This practice is rooted in gender inequality 
and is often linked to other elements of gen-
der-based violence and discrimination, such 
as child marriage and recognized internation-
ally as a violation of the human rights of 
women and girls. 
Unfortunately, this means an estimated 200 
million girls and women alive today have been 
victims of FGM/C, with girls 14 and younger 
representing 44 million of those who have 
been cut. 
For example, consider that around the 
world, at least five girls are mutilated/cut every 
hour and more than 3 million girls are esti-
mated to be at risk of FGM/C, annually. 
The impacts of FGM/C on the physical 
health of women and girls can include bleed-
ing, infection, obstetric fistula, complications 
during childbirth and death. 
Other significant barriers to combatting the 
practice of FGM/C include the high concentra-
tion in specific regions associated with several 
cultural traditions, that is not tied to any one 
religion. 
According to UNICEF, FGM/C is reported to 
occur in all parts of the world, but is most 
prevalent in parts of Africa, the Middle East, 
and Asia. 
Due to the commonality of this practice 
many migrants to the U.S. bring the practice 
of FGM/C with them, increasing the impor-
tance of combatting FGM/C abroad. 
Jackson Lee Amendment No. 15 prioritizes 
funding for foreign assistance to combat Fe-
male Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C), an 
internationally recognized violation of the 
human rights of girls and women comes to an 
end. 
Finally, I thank the Rules Committee for 
making in order, and Chairwoman LEE for in-
cluding in this En Bloc Amendment, Jackson 
Lee Amendment No. 17, which increases and 
decreases the Global Health Programs fund 
by $1,000,000 to emphasize the national com-
mitment for USAID to provide unused vac-
cines that would otherwise be destroyed to 
countries in need around the world. 
Increasing the availability to those countries 
in need of superfluous but life-saving vaccines 
is what a great nation does; not only is it the 
right thing to do, but it also builds goodwill and 
rebuilds important global relations that were 
ruptured by the previous Administration. 
With the spread of Covid–19 variants on the 
rise, Jackson Lee Amendment No. 17 will help 
our neighbors in this hemisphere, and our 
friends and allies around the world cope with 
this ongoing global public health crisis. 
I urge all members to vote for the En Bloc 
Amendment and the underlying legislation, 
H.R. 4373, the State and Foreign Operations 
Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2022. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Chair, my amend-
ment will direct $4,000,000 within the Inter-
national Border and Water Commission to 
clarify the responsibility for the operations and 
maintenance of the International Outfall Inter-
ceptor (IOI). This is in addition to, and sepa-
rate from, the funding that currently exists for 
the long overdue repairs to the IOI. 
The International Outfall Interceptor is the 
infrastructure that transports wastewater from 
Sonora, Mexico and Arizona to the Nogales 
International Wastewater Treatment Plant. 
The IOI pipeline covers approximately 8.5 
miles. Under a 1944 water utilization treaty,

Mexico can treat water in the United States. 
The International Border and Water Commis-
sion is tasked with managing international in-
frastructure negotiations and operates the 
Nogales International Sanitation Project. 
On average, 92 percent of the water treated 
daily at the Nogales International Wastewater 
Treatment Plant is from Mexico and 8 percent 
from the surrounding community. 
Unfortunately, due to damage and aging in-
frastructure, the International Outfall Inter-
ceptor needs costly and urgent repairs. 
Wastewater constantly emerges from the IOI 
and pollutes surrounding rivers and streams. 
Rains carry the polluted stormwater into 
Nogales, Arizona and exposes downstream 
populations to extraordinary public health risk. 
In 2017, I called on the Governor of Arizona 
to commence the Disaster Declaration process 
for the State of Arizona to secure immediate 
federal assistance to remedy and prevent raw 
sewage exposure to Arizona residents. 
Every year during the monsoon season the 
health of residents along the Arizona southern 
border are put at risk, due to this ongoing 
issue. While Arizona residents are very famil-
iar with this issue, other communities along 
the United States—Mexico border experience 
similar health risks due to similar issues. 
The IBWC recently awarded a contract to 
initiate the urgent repairs of more than 5 miles 
of the deteriorating pipeline using existing 
funds from the $34.2 million IBWC has already 
allocated. My amendment further directs 
$4,000,000 within the International Border and 
Water Commission to clarify the responsibility 
to sustain the operations and maintenance of 
the International Outfall Interceptor (IOI). 
This has been an ongoing international 
issue that impacts the safety and well-being of 
communities across Southern Arizona. In the 
past, Senators and Member of Congress on 
both sides of the aisle of the Arizona delega-
tion have collaborated to remedy the situation. 
I would like to thank the Chairwoman and 
the committee for their work on this bill. I ap-
preciate the opportunity to speak on this 
amendment, and I would urge all my col-
leagues to support this amendment. We must 
finally find a solution to protect the health of 
residents along the United States—Mexico 
border.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 567, the gen-

and the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. 
ROGERS) each will control 10 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California. 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise in opposition to amend-
ments en bloc No. 2, and I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 
This amendment includes changes to 
the bill that I believe would be coun-
terproductive, and I ask my colleagues 
to oppose this amendment. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. I rise in support of the 
amendments en bloc. Madam Speaker, 
the amendments en bloc before us in-
cludes seven amendments that would 
significantly improve the quality of 
this bill. 
It includes an amendment that would 
prohibit funding to the U.N. Popu-
lation Fund and strike funding for fam-
ily planning and reproductive health. I 
am gravely concerned about the long-
standing pro-life provisions that were 
stripped from the bill this fiscal year, 
all of them. Allowing the bill to pro-
ceed without protections for the un-
born, like those in this amendment, is 
unprecedented and a direct hit to the 
sanctity of life around the world. 
Also included in this en bloc is an 
amendment that would prohibit con-
tributions to various climate organiza-
tions, such as the Green Climate Fund. 
The underlying bill provides over $3 
billion for climate change programs, 
including nearly $2 billion for ill-ad-
vised contributions to international 
climate funds. At a time when Amer-
ican families continue to struggle to 
make ends meet and foreign aid is 
under great scrutiny, proposing such 
politically motivated misuses of tax-
payer funding adds insult to injury. 
The en bloc also includes an amend-
ment that would prohibit funds for 
U.S. membership and/or contributions 
to the World Health Organization. The 
underlying bill, as currently written, 
includes no reforms of the WHO, even 
though they are complicit in covering 
up the COVID–19 pandemic. Without 
necessary safeguards in place to im-
prove WHO transparency, American 
taxpayer funds should not be used for 
this organization. 
Similarly, the amendments en bloc 
includes a proposal to reduce funding 
for the Contributions to International 
Organizations account. The base bill 
includes an increase for international 
organizations, but without conditions 
or requirements for reform, this is sim-
ply too much funding. 
The amendments included in this 
amendment give the bill a far greater 
chance of being signed into law. It in-
cludes longstanding pro-life provisions 
that enjoy support from the majority 
of the American public and common-
sense safeguards to ensure taxpayer 
dollars are used in the most efficient 
manner. 
Madam Speaker, I urge support for 
the amendment, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The

bers are under recognition.

California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Florida 
(Ms.

FRANKEL). 
Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Congress-
woman LEE for yielding and for her 
great work on this bill. Madam Speak-
er, all I can start with saying is my, 
my, my. It is not enough that Repub-
licans are trying to block safe, legal 
abortions in every nook and cranny on 
Earth, now they want to defund the 
world’s finest health agency and cut 
funding for family planning. 
For those who don’t follow it, the 
UNFPA is the United Nations’ sexual 
and reproductive health agency. Here 
is what it does: It supports reproduc-
tive healthcare for women and youth in

more than 150 countries, home to more 
than 80 percent of the world’s popu-
lation; it supports the health of preg-
nant women as well as reliable access 
to modern contraceptives and the 
training of thousands of healthcare 
workers; it supports the prevention of 
gender-based violence, including the 
abandonment of female genital mutila-
tion; and it supports the prevention of 
teen pregnancy complications and ef-
forts to end child marriage. 
I want to make it very clear, UNFPA 
has never supported forced abortions 
anywhere. Where I have heard that, it 
is a lie. 
This en bloc also seeks to cut family 
planning. Are you kidding? Really? 
You are trying to stop abortions, and 
then my friends on the other side of 
the aisle think you are going to stop it 
by stopping access to contraception 
and blocking the work of healthcare 
providers 
who 
deliver 
reproductive 
care? To me that is just crazy, Madam 
Speaker. Crazy, crazy, crazy. 
Madam Speaker, I have said this be-
fore, and I say this again, for women 
and their families to be safe, for com-
munities to be prosperous, for the 
world to be peaceful, women must suc-
ceed. And that means they have to be 
healthy, free from sexual violence, and 
free to make their own personal deci-
sions about whether and when to be-
come a parent. 
I oppose the amendments en bloc, 
and I urge my colleagues to do the 
same. 
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Texas 
(Mr. 
TONY 
GONZALES). 
Mr. TONY GONZALES of Texas. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to include the text of my amend-
ment in the RECORD immediately prior 
to the vote on the motion to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TONY GONZALES of Texas. 
Madam Speaker, as you know, our ally 
Israel was forced to defend itself in 
May from Hamas and the Palestinian 
Islamic jihad, who over the course of 11 
days indiscriminately fired over 4,000 
rockets from Gaza into Israel. 
My motion to recommit would pro-
vide $1 billion to Israel to replenish and 
maintain its Iron Dome defense sys-
tem. 
We must continue to stand with our 
ally Israel. We must continue to show 
that the United States believes in the 
right to existence and defend them-
selves. We must do everything within 
our power to ensure they are equipped 
to defend against these heinous attacks 
and defeat these terrorists. 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from California (Ms. JA-
COBS). 
Ms. JACOBS of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to oppose my col-
league 
Congresswoman 
CLAUDIA 
TENNEY’s amendment No. 34, which 
would maintain the arbitrary 25 per-
cent cap on U.S. contributions to U.N. 
peacekeeping operations. 
I recently introduced legislation, the 
U.S. Commitment to Peacekeeping Act 
that would, among other things, per-
manently repeal this cap and ensure 
that the United States is fulfilling its 
commitments to the United Nations. 
As someone who used to work at the 
U.N. Department of Peace Operations, I 
know firsthand how the cap and result-
ing arrears have harmed our interests. 
It damages our standing and credibility 
at the U.N. making it difficult to effec-
tively advocate for human rights. 
It reduces our ability to conduct 
proper oversight and accountability 
through needed reforms, something my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle 
agree is important. 
It also impairs peacekeeping mis-
sions’ ability to operate and delays 
funding to peacekeepers. 
All of this makes it harder for the 
United States to advocate for and se-
cure its interests. In order to fully lead 
on the global stage, we need to fully 
commit to our international obliga-
tions. 
Tenney amendment No. 34 is counter-
productive. I oppose it in the strongest 
terms, and urge my colleagues to join 
me in rejecting these efforts to weaken 
our standing at the U.N. and around 
the world. 
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr. PAL-
LONE). 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Chairwoman BARBARA LEE and 
her team for putting together such a 
robust State-Foreign Operations bill. 
I think this was a major achieve-
ment. 
I come here as the co-chair of the 
Congressional Caucus on Armenian 
Issues, and I am extremely pleased to 
see $50 million in assistance to help 
bolster Armenia’s ongoing democratic 
and economic transformations. 
This unprecedented commitment in 
funding will go a long way in helping 
continue economic governance and rule 
of law reforms while further strength-
ening America’s strategic partnership 
with this young democracy. 
The language included in this bill 
also helps address the humanitarian 
needs in Artsakh as a result of the 44- 
day war perpetrated by Azerbaijan and 
Turkey last fall and directs an addi-
tional $2 million for demining pro-
grams. 
I also thank Chairman MCGOVERN for 
his steadfast commitment to the Arme-
nian people and share my appreciation 
for the cosponsors of my amendment, 
which will pass as part of this package. 
This amendment prevents U.S. secu-
rity funding to Azerbaijan through the 
International Military Education and 
Training, IMET, and Foreign Military 
Financing, FMF, programs, which is 
sorely needed to combat Azerbaijan’s 
aggression in the region. 
Let me be clear, Madam Speaker, 
this bill sends a clear signal that we 
will not aid or tolerate authoritarian 
regimes that threaten peace and secu-
rity, especially when those actions are 
aimed at a fellow democracy. 
Again, I thank Chairwoman LEE. I 
know she has been a supporter of the 
Armenian people for many years. I 
have been to her district to see some of 
the Armenian Americans who really 
love her. 
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam 
Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this 
amendment, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1515 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Madam Speak-
er, I yield myself the balance of my 
time. One of the reasons that I oppose 
this amendment is because it proposes 
to eliminate all funding for family 
planning. 
Now, a woman’s ability to thrive is 
dependent on her health and participa-
tion in society. The House bill we are 
considering will improve her opportu-
nities. 
Let me review what countless studies 
have 
already 
shown: 
reproductive 
health 
services 
prevent 
unintended 
pregnancies, 
maternal 
deaths, 
and 
abortions; reduce rates of infant and 
child mortality; empower women to 
stay in school and join the workforce; 
create stronger and healthier families; 
and improve economies. 
But as we sit here today, more than 
200 million women around the world 
still lack access to modern contracep-
tives. If we want to build on the self-re-
liance of countries, one of the most 
cost-effective measures is to increase 
access to family planning. 
Attacks on women’s health must 
stop. 
Now, to oppose family planning and 
contraceptives and birth control, then 
to oppose abortions, that doesn’t make 
any sense. Of course, my colleague 
from Florida said it very clearly, that 
it is just downright crazy. 
Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to 
this en bloc amendment, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 567, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendments en bloc offered by the 
gentlewoman 
from 
California

The question is on the amendments 
en bloc. 
The question was taken; and the

the noes appear to have it. 
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam 
Speaker, on that I demand the yeas 
and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are

Madam

Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
amendments en bloc No. 3. Let me first 
thank my colleagues for raising these 
important issues. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms.

Ms. JACOBS of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in support of this en 
bloc package and thank the gentle-
woman for including my amendment 
today. 
Madam Speaker, before coming to 
Congress, I served at the State Depart-
ment working on countering and pre-
venting violent extremism and address-
ing the real drivers behind it. What we 
know is that it is not possible to solely 
rely on security assistance and mili-
tary tools to counter violent extre-
mism. In fact, one of the common driv-
ers of local recruitment into these ex-
tremist groups is abuses by state secu-
rity forces. 
When the United States provides se-
curity assistance to militaries tasked 
with countering violent groups, we 
need to acknowledge the possible con-
sequences and ensure that the assist-
ance we do provide is not going to peo-
ple who will abuse their own citizens 
and, in turn, exacerbate the very prob-
lem we are seeking to address in the 
first place. We need to properly allo-
cate resources to actually address the 
drivers of violence and conflict, which 
means more funding to efforts like the 
Global Fragility Act. 
Madam Speaker, I look forward to 
working with my colleagues on these 
efforts. 
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam 
Speaker, I claim the time in opposition 
to the amendment, and I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, this amendments en 
bloc contains several measures that 
could have enjoyed broad support. Un-
fortunately, it also includes several 
amendments that some on our side are 
unable to accept. One is by the gentle-
woman from Minnesota (Ms. OMAR), 
which would transfer funds from for-
eign military financing to the develop-
ment assistance account. 
At a time when the United States is 
facing serious national security chal-
lenges around the globe, including from 
China and Russia, we should be in-
creasing U.S. security assistance rath-
er than holding it flat or, worse yet, re-
ducing it to increase an account that 
this bill already increases by 15 per-
cent. 
We simply face too many challenges 
to be cutting national security funding 
at this time. 
Madam Speaker, finally, I also need 
to mention the self-executing man-
ager’s amendment offered by our dis-
tinguished subcommittee chair relat-
ing to the expansion of global currency 
reserves by the International Monetary 
Fund. This amendment would require 
the Secretary of the Treasury to sup-
port the issuance of an additional $2.1 
trillion of special drawing rights, an 
IMF reserve asset, to all member coun-
tries of the fund. This is in addition to 
a whopping $650 billion that was al-
ready issued earlier this year. 
This is a highly controversial pro-
posal that appears to run counter to 
other administration policies, includ-
ing claims of prioritizing efforts to 
counter the maligned influence of Rus-
sia and China. 
This plan could result in many bil-
lions in additional reserves being sent 
to the world’s most notorious dictator-
ships and state sponsors of terror, such 
as Iran, Venezuela, Russia, and China. 
Not only does this unwise scheme go 
against the stated goals and objectives 
of the White House, but it also could 
hinder Treasury’s efforts to penalize 
and pressure these malign state actors 
through extensive U.S. sanction re-
gimes. 
Why go to all the trouble of putting 
in place and enforcing these sanctions 
when this proposal for the IMF to issue 
trillions in additional liquidity could 
significantly undercut years of pres-
sure carefully designed to advance our 
national interest? 
Madam Speaker, for these reasons, I 
urge my colleagues to oppose this 
amendments en bloc, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from New York (Ms. OCASIO- 
CORTEZ). 
Ms. 
OCASIO-CORTEZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman 
from California for the time. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
my amendment in order to increase 
and decrease funds in the State Depart-
ment to highlight the need for stronger 
congressional oversight, robust human 
rights measures, and transparency in 
U.S. arms sales to countries. 
The fact of the matter is, despite 
leaky laws in place, the United States 
has quietly trained and armed actors 
who eventually engage in human rights 
abuses all over the world through a 
State Department program known as 
direct commercial sales. 
This program allows the State De-
partment to sell up to $100 to $300 mil-
lion in military training, weapons, and 
services without so much as notifying 
Congress. 
It was through this policy that the 
U.S. provided paramilitary training to 
Saudi operatives that later went on to 
kill Jamal Khashoggi, as well as for 
the sales of arms later used in the ab-
duction and killing of more than 300 
Colombians in the May 2021 protests 
over labor rights. 
The U.S. must stop arming and fund-
ing human rights violators. We must 
have stronger congressional oversight, 
robust human rights standards, and 
transparency in all U.S. arms sales. 
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Wisconsin 
(Mr. 
GROTHMAN). 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
would like to talk about this bill over-
all, as well as potential amendments to 
the bill.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4150 
July 28, 2021 
Above all, this time around, after the 
massive increase of spending due to 
COVID, I think we ought to look as to 
whether this budget is frugal and 
whether the increases in the budget are 
actually necessary. 
I am going to address the line in the 
budget for international organizations, 
contributions to international organi-
zations. The bill, as proposed on the 
floor today, is a 10 percent increase 
over last year. A lot of that money is 
going to the United Nations, a body 
that seems to delight in being critical 
of the United States and a body in 
which the clear majority of members 
operate governments in which you 
would not want to live there at all, 
human rights abuses and otherwise. 
In any event, I think we should go 
back to the last en bloc. There is an 
amendment in there. Rather than in-
crease the amount to these inter-
national organizations by 10 percent, 
decrease the amount by 10 percent. 
We are putting so much pressure on 
the value of the dollar, so much debt 
on our children and grandchildren. 
The idea of going back, not to a dra-
conian level, but the idea of going back 
to somewhere between where we were 
in 2019 and 2020, not a radical number, 
I think would be prudent. 
I think, in this line as well as other 
lines of the budget, we should be look-
ing to hold things about even or a mild 
step back, not another massive 10 per-
cent increase, which will largely fund 
an organization that takes delight in 
making fun of the United States and 
the freedoms that we have. 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. DIN-
GELL). 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the distinguished subcommittee 
chair for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
the en bloc, which includes my impor-
tant 
amendment 
highlighting 
the 
United States’ continued enabling of 
the Saudi Arabia-led coalition’s ongo-
ing blockade of Yemen. 
The war in Yemen is now in its sixth 
year, and it is clear that there is no 
military solution to the conflict. 
While the Biden administration an-
nounced earlier this year that it would 
limit U.S. involvement in the conflict, 
it has never been authorized by Con-
gress, and more needs to be done. 
This begins by pushing for an end to 
the Saudi blockade of Yemen, which 
has exacerbated what continues to be 
the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, 
with at least 400,000 Yemeni children 
facing starvation and potential death. 
The blockade limits delivery of food, 
fuel, and other critical supplies to the 
Yemeni people. This is unconscionable 
when Yemen is already facing the dev-
astation of civil war and an ongoing 
public health crisis caused by COVID. 
Madam Speaker, we have to do bet-
ter. I encourage my colleagues to sup-
port this en bloc to send a message 
that the blockade of Yemen needs to 
end. 
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Minnesota (Mr. PHILLIPS). 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of my amendment, which affirms 
President Biden’s budget request of $2 
million for the purposes of supporting 
the planning for the 2025 World Expo in 
Osaka, Japan. 
My amendment sheds light on a win- 
win situation for both our country and 
my home State of Minnesota. 
When I took my oath of office 21⁄2 
years ago, my team and I set out on an 
ambitious goal to visit every city and 
town in Minnesota’s Third District 
within the first 6 months of my service 
to listen and learn from the local lead-
ers who know our community best be-
cause I believe representation begins 
with listening. 
In the city of Bloomington, home of 
the 
famous 
Mall 
of 
America, 
we 
learned that city leaders were deter-
mined to bring the eyes of the world to 
Minnesota by bidding for host city of 
the 2027 World Expo, and there is good 
news. I am proud to share with you 
that Bloomington was selected as the 
United States’ designee to compete on 
the world stage for hosting rights. 
Bloomington, the Twin Cities metro 
area, the State of Minnesota, and the 
United States will benefit from show-
casing American innovation on the 
world stage. With the funds highlighted 
in this amendment, we will ensure that 
Bloomington has the financial support 
it needs to put the full strength of 
American ingenuity on display. 
I want to take a moment to thank 
the city of Bloomington, Global Min-
nesota, and the entire Minnesota dele-
gation for supporting efforts like these. 
This is how democracy should work, 
Democrats and Republicans in Con-
gress working together with constitu-
ents and government agencies to craft 
legislation to benefit localities and our 
entire country. 
Madam Speaker, I look forward to 
working with the Biden administra-
tion, just as we did with the Trump ad-
ministration, to bring the World Expo 
home to Minnesota. 
b 1530 
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Florida 
(Mr. 
DIAZ- 
BALART). 
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Speaker, 
for more than 2 weeks, we have seen 
the horrors of repression taking place 
on the island of Cuba by the com-
munist regime. 
Let me tell you, I am outraged that 
the Democratic majority refused to 
make in order two amendments, bipar-
tisan amendments, which I cospon-
sored, that were led by two of my 
Democratic colleagues who, by the 
way, are passionate about the cause of 
a free Cuba and the freedom of the 
Cuban people. 
The Murphy amendment would have 
provided an additional $7.5 million in 
democratic assistance to support the 
free flow of information to the island 
in this moment. 
The Sires amendment would have 
provided an additional $15 million to 
USAGM for the Office of Cuba Broad-
casting, at a time when the Cuban peo-
ple had their internet cut. 
They are struggling with this incred-
ible oppression: getting murdered, get-
ting killed, getting dragged out of their 
homes. The fact that we are inad-
equately funding radio broadcasting to 
the island is hard to accept and hard to 
believe. It is disgraceful. 
Now, while the Cuban people are 
risking everything for freedom, the 
Democrat majority refused to allow 
these amendments to even be debated 
here on the floor of the House. 
I want to thank the Republican lead-
ership and our Conference for their 
steadfast support for years for the 
cause of a free Cuban. 
But I want to thank those Demo-
cratic colleagues who are true defend-
ers of freedom in the cause of the 
Cuban people: Representatives MUR-
PHY, WASSERMAN SCHULTZ, and SIRES, 
who fought hard to try to get these 
amendments here on the floor. 
As I stated in full committee, it is 
unconscionable that in this moment 
when the Cubans are doing everything 
they can, and they have hit the streets 
and they are getting bludgeoned and 
murdered and imprisoned, that this 
majority would not even allow those 
amendments to be heard on the floor of 
the House. 
Madam Speaker, history will remem-
ber those who stood with the cause of 
freedom, freedom for the Cuban people, 
and those who aligned themselves with 
the oppressive murderous regime that 
represses them now and for more than 
62 years. 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from Minnesota (Ms. OMAR). 
Ms. OMAR. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the chairwoman for her leadership and 
for including my amendment in the en 
bloc. 
Madam Speaker, as a member of the 
Foreign Affairs Committee, I travel 
around the world and hear so many of 
our diplomats emphasize the impor-
tance of balancing development, diplo-
macy, and defense. But in so many 
places, I don’t see that balance. 
My amendment is about restoring 
balance to our foreign policy by mov-
ing away from military assistance and 
arms sales and toward development 
and addressing the root causes of con-
flict. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this en bloc. 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, first of all, let me 
just say I am very proud of the re-
sources and programs in this bill,

which provide us the unique oppor-
tunity to restore America’s global 
leadership that has been missing in re-
cent years. 
Together, we can address the great-
est challenges facing the United States 
and provide vital support to the world’s 
most vulnerable people. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support these amendments 
en bloc and the underlying bill. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam 
Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the 
amendment, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of this En Bloc Amendment to H.R. 
4373, the State and Foreign Operations Ap-
propriations Act for FY2022, which incor-
porates Jackson Lee Amendments Nos. 15, 
16, and 17. 
I thank the Rules Committee for making 
these amendments in order and State and 
Foreign 
Operations 
Appropriations 
Sub-
committee Chair DeLauro for including them in 
this En Bloc Amendment. 
Jackson Lee Amendments No. 15 and No. 
16 have been approved several times by the 
relevant subcommittee, made in order by the 
Rules Committee, and adopted by the full 
House; Jackson Lee Amendment #17, while 
being offered for the first time, makes a very 
important contribution to the health and safety 
of the global community. 
Jackson Lee Amendment No. 16 will des-
ignate $1,000,000 to combat the trafficking of 
endangered species. 
The amendment makes a good bill better by 
providing a $1 million focus to combat the 
transportation of the remains of endangered 
species, to confront the transport of the re-
mains of killed endangered species. 
The brutal killing of Cecil the lion after being 
lured off a protected preserve was an indica-
tion that we needed to do more to protect en-
dangered species at risk of being killed. 
At that time, I introduced and sought the 
support of my colleagues as original cospon-
sors of my legislation, Cecil the Lion Endan-
gered and Threatened Species Act of 2015. 
This bill sought to strengthen partner coun-
tries’ capacity in countering wildlife trafficking 
and designating major wildlife countries for 
protection. 
The Jackson Lee Amendment No. 16 is 
again offered in the same spirit: to prohibit the 
taking and transportation of any endangered 
and threatened species as a trophy to the 
United States. 
Currently, the Endangered Species Act does 
not protect most wildlife animals killed. At this 
point, we can choose to make wise decisions 
that will sustain the global population, or we 
can ignore the warning signs. 
Jackson Lee Amendment No. 16 is one that 
the House has strongly supported in the past 
because it would bring greater awareness and 
protection to these beautiful and vital popu-
lations that are too often taken for granted, by 
allowing this amendment to address the 
senseless trafficking in trophy killings of all en-
dangered and threatened species. 
Jackson Lee Amendment No. 15 provides 
funds to be allocate funds provided for Global 
Health Programs to the fight against the prac-
tice of Female Genital Mutilation. 
I have been a dedicated champion against 
this practice for a long while, working closely 
with former Congressman Joe Crowley of New 
York to introduce legislation targeted at sup-
porting the elimination of this ludicrous prac-
tice of mutilating young women. 
Female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) 
comprises all procedures that involve partial or 
total removal of the external female genitalia, 
or other injury to the female genital organs for 
non-medical reasons. 
This practice is rooted in gender inequality 
and is often linked to other elements of gen-
der-based violence and discrimination, such 
as child marriage and recognized internation-
ally as a violation of the human rights of 
women and girls. 
Unfortunately, this means an estimated 200 
million girls and women alive today have been 
victims of FGM/C, with girls 14 and younger 
representing 44 million of those who have 
been cut. 
For example, consider that around the 
world, at least five girls are mutilated/cut every 
hour and more than 3 million girls are esti-
mated to be at risk of FGM/C, annually. 
The impacts of FGM/C on the physical 
health of women and girls can include bleed-
ing, infection, obstetric fistula, complications 
during childbirth and death. 
Other significant barriers to combatting the 
practice of FGM/C include the high concentra-
tion in specific regions associated with several 
cultural traditions, that is not tied to any one 
religion. 
According to UNICEF, FGM/C is reported to 
occur in all parts of the world, but is most 
prevalent in parts of Africa, the Middle East, 
and Asia. 
Due to the commonality of this practice 
many migrants to the U.S. bring the practice 
of FGM/C with them, increasing the impor-
tance of combatting FGM/C abroad. 
Jackson Lee Amendment #15 prioritizes 
funding for foreign assistance to combat Fe-
male Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C), an 
internationally recognized violation of the 
human rights of girls and women comes to an 
end. 
Finally, I thank the Rules Committee for 
making in order, and Chairwoman LEE for in-
cluding in this En Bloc Amendment, Jackson 
Lee Amendment No. 17, which increases and 
decreases the Global Health Programs fund 
by $1,000,000 to emphasize the national com-
mitment for USAID provide unused vaccines 
that would otherwise be destroyed to countries 
in need around the world. 
Increasing the availability to those countries 
in need of superfluous but life-saving vaccines 
is what a great nation does; not only is the 
right thing to do, but it also builds goodwill and 
rebuilds important global relations that were 
ruptured by the previous Administration. 
With the spread of Covid–19 variants on the 
rise, Jackson Lee Amendment No. 17 will help 
our neighbors in this hemisphere, and our 
friends and allies around the world cope with 
this ongoing global public health crisis. 
I urge all members to vote for the En Bloc 
Amendment and the underlying legislation, 
H.R. 4373, the State and Foreign Operations 
Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2022. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 567, the pre-
vious

(c) CLASSIFICATION
OF REPORT.—The report 
accompanying this section shall be submitted in

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Legislative 
Branch Appropriations Act, 2022’’ 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill, 
as amended, is debatable for 1 hour 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of 
the Committee on Appropriations or 
their respective designees. 
The gentleman from Ohio (Mr. RYAN) 
and the gentleman from Florida (Mr. 
DIAZ-BALART) each will control 30 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Ohio. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Ohio? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of the Legislative Branch Appro-
priations Act. 
While this subcommittee may be 
small, it has a very important role. I 
very much appreciate the hard work 
and collegial attitude of all the mem-
bers of this subcommittee, particularly 
the contributions and cooperation of 
our ranking member, Ms. HERRERA 
BEUTLER. 
This is a good bill. I am proud of this 
bill and I am proud that it makes a 
substantial investment to expand re-
cruitment 
and 
retention 
of 
staff, 
prioritizes funding to expand diversity 
and inclusion campus-wide, and funds 
needed investments to support the day- 
to-day operations of the House so that 
we can support our constituents. 
Included within this bill is a 21 per-
cent increase for the Members’ Rep-
resentational Allowance, which covers 
staff, district office space, and day-to- 
day operations for lawmakers to best 
serve our constituents. This has been a 
priority for me as I recognize the im-
portant role of expanding pay and ben-
efits for our staff as we strive to re-
cruit a more diverse workforce in our 
offices, and then to retain these staff, 
instead of losing them to the private 
sector. 
Additionally, this year’s bill makes 
important steps in exploring other 
areas where we can expand benefits for 
staff to compete with the private sec-
tor. And so, this year’s report directs 
the Chief Administrative Officer to 
conduct a benefit and retention study 
to look at possibilities such as tuition 
credits, the creation of 529 accounts, a 
House-wide leave policy, and childcare 
subsidies so that we can continue to 
meet the needs of existing and future 
staff. 
It is vital that we prioritize initia-
tives to expand a diverse and talented 
workforce here on Capitol Hill. The re-
port provides an additional $350,000 to 
establish a task force within CAO to 
include the Office of Diversity and In-
clusion, the Office of Congressional 
Workplace Rights, and any other House 
office as may be necessary, to develop 
a methodology for regularly surveying 
the House workforce on pay and benefit 
issues, to provide guidance and support 
for the content and development of a 
centralized human resources hub and 
to make policy recommendations. 
Additionally, while the bill continues 
the prohibition of cost-of-living adjust-
ment increases for Members, in order 
to ascertain all the facts on this issue 
we also require the CAO to provide a 
report comparing Members’ pay with 
executive and managers’ pay in the pri-
vate sector who have similar levels of 
experience and responsibility. 
In a year full of trauma and hurt, 
with the apex being the insurrection on 
January 6, our human resources enti-
ties within the Capitol complex have 
adapted to the evolving and increasing 
mental health needs of our campus. 
The bill includes $2.3 million, a $635,000 
increase for the Office of Employee As-
sistance, and a $1.7 million allocation 
for the Office of Well-Being to ensure 
that people here on Capitol Hill have 
the resources to support the needs of 
our community and to fund culturally

sensitive mental health services so ev-
eryone feels comfortable seeking the 
support they need. 
We have also included $2 million for 
the House Modernization Initiatives 
account to build off last year’s efforts 
to make Congress more effective, effi-
cient, and transparent on behalf of the 
American people. 
Second, the bill provides $15.4 million 
to expand the paid internship program. 
This will increase the amount to $35,000 
per Member office to pay interns. We 
have also extended this funding to 
committees, and continue to support 
these funds being used for interns both 
in D.C. and in district offices. 
We want to make sure that any cit-
izen in this country, any young person 
in this country who wants to come to 
Washington, D.C., is able to do that. 
We are trying to eliminate those eco-
nomic barriers so that people can come 
here and get the experience they need 
to improve their lot in life, and to 
serve their country. 
But we also recognize the ongoing in-
equities in congressional internships, 
so we included language directing the 
Office of Diversity and Inclusion work-
ing in conjunction with the Chief Ad-
ministrative Office to conduct a feasi-
bility study on recreating a centralized 
House internship program—similar to 
the old LBJ intern program from many 
years ago—which could provide various 
support services, such as housing, 
training, 
professional 
development, 
and focus outreach on students attend-
ing historically Black colleges and uni-
versities, Tribal colleges and univer-
sities, 
Hispanic-serving 
institutions, 
and other minority-serving institu-
tions. I believe this is a vital step for 
us to create a pipeline for students 
from all backgrounds, all economic 
areas, to come and work on Capitol 
Hill. 
The bill also includes $3 million for 
the Office of Diversity and Inclusion 
and directs the CAO to increase their 
staff cap from 7 to 10 staffers to allow 
them the additional workers that they 
need. 
Additionally, once again, this year’s 
bill includes language to permit DACA 
recipients, Dreamers, to be able to 
work for Congress and other legislative 
branch agencies. 
Turning to other legislative branch 
agencies, the bill provides strong sup-
port for the security and operational 
needs of the House and surrounding 
Capitol complex. 
H.R. 4346 includes $600 million for the 
Capitol Police, which is an almost $90 
million increase above the fiscal year 
2021 bill. This provides vital resources 
for training, recruitment, retention, 
and readiness efforts. This funding will 
provide for a total of 2,112 sworn offi-
cers. 
Additionally, this continues to build 
off previous efforts in ensuring a robust 
trauma and resiliency program for our 
sworn and civilian officers. This is an 
extremely important investment as 
they continue to heal from the events 
of January 6 and Good Friday. And we 
saw further testimonials yesterday in 
the hearing as to why exactly this in-
vestment is needed. 
The bill includes an increase of $37 
million from 2021 for the Library of 
Congress, as it is this subcommittee’s 
duty to protect the valuable collec-
tions and preserve the Library’s ability 
to chronicle this great Nation and pro-
vide access to our history for genera-
tions to come. 
And it includes $3.8 million to con-
tinue the Library’s work on the Vet-
erans History Project to collect and 
preserve 
the 
personal 
accounts 
of 
American war veterans. 
The bill also increases funding for 
the Architect of the Capitol over 2021 
by $152 million to address necessary 
construction activities, such as the 
Cannon Office Building renovation. 
Also included are various other provi-
sions to ensure the Capitol Visitor Cen-
ter and Capitol complex are accessible 
for individuals with disabilities and all 
visitors who wish to tour the Capitol or 
meet with their Members of Congress. 
And, finally, the bill includes lan-
guage for the removal of statues or 
busts in the Capitol of those who tried 
to overthrow the Government of the 
United States or were white suprema-
cists. 
Before I finish, I would like to recog-
nize the staff for all their hard work 
and time they have put into this bill. 
From the majority committee staff, I 
would like to thank my clerk, Steve 
Marchese and Rachel Jenkins from my 
personal office. From the minority 
committee staff, I would like to thank 
Michelle Reinshuttle. And, again, to 
the Chair of the full committee, ROSA 
DELAURO, 
Ranking 
Member 
KAY 
GRANGER, and Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. 
This was a great team effort to put this 
thing together, and we are proud to 
submit it to the body today. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Washington (Ms. HER-
RERA BEUTLER) controls the time and is 
recognized. 
b 1545 
Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, first, let me com-
mend Chairman RYAN for his coopera-
tion on this bill. He has worked in good 
faith with me and my staff to include 
requests in this bill every step of the 
way, and I really appreciate it. I think 
it is a good model for the rest of how 
Congress should work, and I would 
work with him anytime. I want to say 
thank you to his staff and to the staff 
under Chairwoman DELAURO, Steve 
Marchese. I want to thank my staff, 
Michelle Reinshuttle for getting us to 
this point, although, I don’t believe we 
are quite there yet. I am going to ex-
plain why. 
Madam Speaker, I have to rise in op-
position to H.R. 4346, the fiscal year 
2022 Legislative Branch Appropriations 
Act. This bill does include some provi-
sions that I support, including criti-
cally needed funding to address the re-
quirements of the Capitol complex. 
It provides funding that allows Mem-
bers and our staff to better serve our 
constituents by providing better soft-
ware to improve the accessibility of 
casework forms that our offices use to 
help constituents resolve problems and 
issues with Federal agencies. It imple-
ments measures to increase staff reten-
tion, and it allows offices to acquire 
new technologies to strengthen the 
protection and productivity of our IT 
infrastructure. 
This bill also supports the critical 
mission of the Capitol Police by pro-
viding funding for additional personnel 
to 
replenish 
their 
really 
depleted 
ranks, new leadership training initia-
tives, and additional resources so they 
can continue to protect Members, staff, 
and visitors who come and occupy the 
Halls of Congress on a daily basis. 
In the aftermath of an incredibly dif-
ficult and challenging year for the men 
and women of the Capitol Police, these 
measures are really an important step 
toward improving the police force. 
However, 
Madam 
Speaker, 
while 
there are many parts of this bill that I 
do support, this bill, like the others 
that the majority has put forward, is 
based on what I believe is a flawed fis-
cal foundation. The majority is forging 
ahead with massive increases to non-
defense spending. The bill we are con-
sidering today includes a nearly 13 per-
cent increase over current levels. I am 
going to explain why that in context 
creates some problems. At a time of 
record high deficits and debt, we need, 
I believe, a more measured fiscal re-
sponse. 
In addition, the majority has also in-
cluded controversial policy riders that 
our side of the aisle opposes. With the 
approach that the majority is taking 
with this bill—and really all of them in 
the appropriations packages we are 
considering here today—we are on the 
path to yet another continuing resolu-
tion. If we are to break this cycle, our 
majority counterparts need to be more 
willing to work with the minority on 
all the bills to create a more bipartisan 
support that garners more of a bipar-
tisan thumbs up. 
Furthermore, the majority has not 
put forward any of the Capitol Police 
reforms to the board that governs the 
Capitol Police or its leadership struc-
ture, and that is a real sticking point, 
Madam Speaker. Including funding to 
hire more officers and to get more 
equipment is a necessary step. I would 
go to bat for that any day of the week. 
We will never see lasting improvement 
to the operation of the force or officer 
morale without these necessary re-
forms. We are going to continue to see 
the erosion of the force until those 
changes are made. 
As we grapple with the trillions in 
new spending that the majority has 
passed and is proposing already 6

months into this year, I want to em-
phasize this point, we must course cor-
rect now rather than wait until our Na-
tion has passed the point of no return. 
The Democrat majority got out of the 
gates by pushing through a $1.9 trillion 
package that includes bailouts for 
States like California that were al-
ready raking in billions more in State 
revenue than was previously forecast. 
My colleagues across the aisle and 
this administration are insisting on 
using reconciliation to force through $4 
trillion more on a gigantic wish list. 
For perspective, the spending I out-
lined is above and beyond the normal 
congressional appropriations. Specifi-
cally, it is nearly four times what the 
Democrats are proposing to spend on 
this and these appropriations bills that 
we are considering. 
Last year when the entire Nation was 
grappling with COVID-related shut-
downs, when hospitals were down to 
their last box of surgical gloves, and 
Congress had to step in to make sure 
that our health system and our com-
munities didn’t collapse, those were 
needed dollars. But we should not 
make the mistake that national emer-
gencies 
like 
the 
COVID 
pandemic 
should green-light and invite further 
spending that is going to usher in 
record inflation, trillions more in debt, 
and, honestly, a reckless increase in 
spending. 
I fear that some here are simply not 
aware of how spiking the prices are of 
food, of gas, and of other everyday 
items impacting families. Unbridled 
spending brings on the kind of inflation 
that increases prices exponentially. 
When we talk about saddling the next 
generation with crushing debt, we are 
talking 
about 
your 
kids, 
Madam 
Speaker, my kids, and their grandkids, 
and they are going to have to pay for 
these decisions. 
I believe that we can do better. The 
funding increases in this bill I think 
are going to fuel that fire. I think we 
need to recalibrate. 
Madam Speaker, for all these reasons 
I urge my colleagues to join me in op-
posing this bill at this time, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Con-
necticut (Ms. DELAURO), who is the 
chair of the full Committee on Appro-
priations. 
Ms. DELAURO. I thank the gen-
tleman, Madam Speaker, for yielding. I 
just might say that just as this is his 
first 
time 
in 
chairing 
the 
sub-
committee—and congratulations—it is 
my first time chairing the full com-
mittee. So we are on the same page. I 
want to thank both the chair and the 
ranking member for their work on this 
bill. 
Madam Speaker, as the oldest mod-
ern democracy in the world, the United 
States exemplifies the success and 
long-term sustainability of democratic 
governance and of the great American 
experiment. If we fail in this experi-
ment, then we fail to honor our sacred 
duty not only to our own citizens, but 
to America as an ideal. 
The events of January 6 threatened 
that ideal. The brutal, violent assault 
on our Capitol was an attack on the 
cradle of our democracy and against 
liberty. It was a determined and vio-
lent insurrection aimed at stopping the 
peaceful transfer of power; something 
that the United States has exemplified 
in its history. It was an attack not just 
against this building, but on America’s 
example to the world. 
This bill also honors the sacrifices of 
the brave women and men in uniform 
who risked their lives defending this 
institution shockingly on display at 
the first hearing of the Select Com-
mittee to Investigate the January 6th 
Attack on the U.S. Capitol. It gives 
these heroes the funding, the resources, 
and the training they need to ensure 
what happened on January 6 never hap-
pens again. It also says: We respect 
what you do. 
It includes measures to provide more 
transparency, diversity, and leadership 
training for the Capitol Police to 
standardize vetting and routinely re-
view staff for employment suitability, 
to provide for the wellness and the 
well-being of our Capitol Police. 
While securing the Capitol Police 
must be our top priority, we must also 
ensure the institution within these 
walls remains strong. I am proud that 
this bill provides increased funding for 
the Members’ Representational Allow-
ance, for standing committees, for se-
lect committees, and for leadership of-
fices to help retain and recruit a tal-
ented and a diverse workforce. To grow 
opportunity and create a diverse hiring 
pipeline, it expands paid internship op-
portunities while providing the author-
ization for Dreamers to work in con-
gressional offices. 
Together, Madam Speaker, the ini-
tiatives in this bill will not only pro-
tect the Congress and our democracy, 
they also strengthen and sustain it. I 
urge support for the bill. 
Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Texas (Ms. GRANGER), 
who is the distinguished ranking mem-
ber. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 
4346, the fiscal year 2022 Legislative 
Branch Appropriations bill. I wish I 
could support this important piece of 
legislation, but unfortunately, it has 
too many flaws, and it does not reflect 
the type of bipartisan agreement that 
we must have to complete the appro-
priations process this year. 
At a time of record–high deficits and 
debt, now is not the time to double 
down on increasing domestic spending. 
This bill alone includes a nearly 13 per-
cent increase over current levels. 
The bill also includes riders that are 
more appropriately addressed by au-
thorizing committees specifically re-
lated to immigration policy. 
In addition, the committee report is 
loaded with unnecessary partisan re-
quirements for the Capitol Police that 
will make it more difficult for them to 
carry out their missions. The com-
mittee report also expands data collec-
tion efforts on individuals working in 
the Capitol and testifying before Con-
gress, including sensitive payroll and 
financial information. That is not the 
way to do business if we want to enact 
full-year appropriations bills this year. 
We must develop top-line spending 
levels that both sides can support, and 
we also must agree to drop controver-
sial policy provisions. If we want to 
avoid a long-term continuing resolu-
tion or worse, a government shutdown, 
we must get serious and do the work 
our constituents sent us here to do. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote against this bill. 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. PELOSI). 
Ms. 
PELOSI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. I am 
pleased to come to the floor to salute 
him for his leadership as chair of this 
very important subcommittee of the 
Committee 
on 
Appropriations 
that 
makes things happen for us in the Cap-
itol to do the people’s business. 
The United States Capitol has always 
been a beacon of freedom, liberty, and 
justice to America and to the entire 
world. Here, lawmakers and staff, insti-
tutional workers, the Capitol Police, 
and members of the press enable the 
functioning of our very democracy. It 
is vital that we ensure that this insti-
tution has the funding and resources 
needed to serve the people. 
The most exciting part of it is when 
children come to the Capitol safely and 
curiously and excited about seeing 
where laws are made and what our 
Founders’ vision was and what our men 
and women in uniform fight for as we 
see in their eyes their aspirations to 
the future which is our charge for the 
children. 
That is why today I am proud to rise 
in support of the Legislative Branch 
appropriations bill which meets these 
needs. I thank the committee chair-
woman, 
Ms. 
DELAURO, 
and 
sub-
committee chair, TIM RYAN, for their 
leadership. This takes a lot of atten-
tion and a lot of specificity and metic-
ulous attention to detail, and I thank 
the distinguished chair of the com-
mittee for his brilliant attention to all 
of that. 
b 1600 
This funding bill not only funds the 
legislative branch, it strengthens it. It 
does so by advancing a more diverse 
and inclusive congressional workforce. 
It has long been a priority for many of 
us to ensure that the Halls of the Cap-
itol reflect the beautiful diversity of 
our Nation at every level. 
The bill provides for strong funding 
for paid internships to support more 
hardworking interns from middle-class 
families. This has been such a priority

for many of us because these intern-
ships are an opportunity for young peo-
ple. But if they are unpaid, they al-
ready self-select as to who can partici-
pate. We have seen this over time, 
where that opportunity cannot be 
taken advantage of unless there is 
funding for it. 
It also provides funding for the 
Wounded Warrior program, which gives 
our heroes who served in uniform an 
opportunity to serve in congressional 
offices. 
Proudly, it allows Dreamers to work 
in the legislative branch. Our Dreamers 
make America more American, and it 
is vital that their voices are heard here 
in the Capitol. 
Most importantly, this bill is about 
security, and that is a moral impera-
tive, 
funding 
and 
supporting 
our 
United States Capitol Police force, the 
heroes. In this legislation, we secured 
strong increases in funding for the Cap-
itol Police force, which will provide for 
the hiring of over 2,100 sworn officers 
and 450 civilian members of the Capitol 
Police. 
It also improves training and bolsters 
wellness support for the Capitol Police, 
many of whom are still suffering from 
the January 6 domestic terrorist at-
tack on the Capitol complex. 
Just yesterday, we heard from four 
heroic members of law enforcement 
who suffered horrible injuries and trau-
ma that day. That trauma continues, 
not just among the Capitol Police, not 
just among Members of Congress, not 
just among Capitol staff, congressional 
staff, but those people who maintain 
the Capitol, who make it all work for 
us, custodial and maintenance people 
in the Capitol. 
Every hero of that day needs and de-
serves our support. Now that the Sen-
ate has announced their agreement on 
a security supplemental, we will work 
to ensure that the need of the Capitol 
and congressional community, as com-
pleted in the Honore report, and in-
cluded here, are met. I thank the chair-
man for the work that was done on 
that supplemental. 
Of course, what we sent to the Senate 
is much stronger than the response we 
will get from them, but we must start, 
and we must continue. 
This legislation honors our heroes. It 
respects our values. It directs removal 
of statues or busts in the Capitol of 
Confederate traitors, as well as statues 
of white supremacists. 
As I have said many times, the Halls 
of Congress are the very heart of our 
democracy. The statues on display 
should embody our highest ideals as 
Americans, expressing who we are and 
who we aspire to be as a Nation. 
Removal of these statues is long 
overdue. That is why, as Speaker, I 
have led the passage of legislation now 
twice to do so. In fact, I took down the 
pictures 
in 
the 
Speaker’s 
Lobby 
months ago as an example. 
At the same time, this afternoon, we 
are considering the foreign ops bill. I 
call it the foreign ops bill. When I was 
the ranking member it was called for-
eign ops. Now it has a bigger name and 
a Democratic chairman. 
The bill makes important invest-
ments to strengthen Congress and, 
therefore, strengthen America, and it 
should be passed. 
In that spirit, I also support another 
appropriations 
bill 
to 
strengthen 
America, H.R. 4373, which advances our 
leadership in the world, as it defends 
our values. 
As a former ranking member of the 
State and Foreign Operations Appro-
priations Subcommittee, I am proud of 
this bill, and I salute the chair, BAR-
BARA LEE, a lifelong champion of glob-
al health and human rights, including 
through her leadership on PEPFAR 
and the Global Fund to Fight Aids. 
This funding bill makes clear that, as 
President Biden has said, ‘‘America is 
back.’’ It is a strong statement of 
America’s leadership in the world. 
With this legislation, America is 
once again taking the lead in the cli-
mate fight, with over $3 billion to ad-
dress the climate crisis, including 
through first-ever appropriations to 
the Green Climate Fund. 
We are setting an example for the 
world on public health, providing over 
$10 billion to support families’ health 
around the world and prevent future 
pandemics, focusing on surveillance, 
detection, and response capabilities. 
Also, in terms of public health, we 
are proud to be permanently repealing 
the global gag rule, a dangerous rule 
that deprives the poorest families in 
the world of basic healthcare and fam-
ily planning services. 
We are investing billions in initia-
tives for maternal and child health and 
fighting infectious diseases, including, 
still, HIV/AIDS through PEPFAR. 
This funding honors our values by in-
vesting in human rights with the Glob-
al Equality Fund and other initiatives 
to support the LGBTQ community and 
support for disability rights, gender 
equality, and protecting persecuted re-
ligious minorities; humanitarian as-
sistance, with billions for migration 
and refugee initiatives and disaster as-
sistance; and protecting democracy and 
the rule of law around the globe. It 
contains billions in security and eco-
nomic support to partners and allies to 
advance peace, prosperity, and sta-
bility. 
We are proud of its strong support for 
Israel, which is in our national secu-
rity interests. 
We are also proud that this legisla-
tion helps implement the ALLIES Act, 
passed last week by the House to expe-
dite Afghan Special Immigrant Visas. 
The local Afghan partners who have 
worked shoulder to shoulder with the 
American military and our diplomatic 
personnel are heroes. They have been 
vital to the safety of American lives 
and the success of our mission. We 
made a promise, and now we are keep-
ing it. We must be there for them as 
they were for us. 
These two funding bills demonstrate 
and defend American leadership at 
home and around the world. I urge a 
strong bipartisan ‘‘aye’’ vote for both. 
I thank the leadership of ROSA 
DELAURO, BARBARA LEE, and TIM RYAN. 
Ms. 
HERRERA 
BEUTLER. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Arkansas (Mr. WOMACK). 
Mr. WOMACK. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent to include the text 
of the amendment in the RECORD im-
mediately prior to the vote on the mo-
tion to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
BLUMENAUER). Is there objection to the 
request of the gentleman from Arkan-
sas? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. WOMACK. Mr. Speaker, I offer 
this motion to recommit for one simple 
reason: so our defenders, the National 
Guard and the Capitol Police, can have 
the funding they need to continue pro-
tecting Americans day in and day out. 
This motion does what Congress has 
been unable to do for months, and that 
is support our guardsmen and our Cap-
itol Police. 
Each and every one of these brave 
men 
and 
women 
have 
voluntarily 
raised their hands and sworn an oath to 
protect our institution and our coun-
try. And we can’t do our most basic 
duty of providing funding for them to 
complete this sacred task. 
For both the Guard and the Capitol 
Police, this funding is essential to 
maintaining operations. We are talking 
about something as basic as keeping 
the lights on. 
These gaps were caused by the Cap-
itol security mission. They came here 
to protect us, and it should be this 
Congress, 
through 
the 
Legislative 
Branch Appropriations bill, which foots 
the bill. 
Without this funding, the National 
Guard will be forced to cancel annual 
training and drill weekends through 
the end of the fiscal year. They will 
have to defer 75 armory and training 
site upgrades. The Air National Guard 
will see an 8-flying day standdown, and 
there is much, much more. 
This imperils unit readiness. That is 
obvious. It is also a pretty grave out-
come. But individual soldiers and air-
men, and their families, will see the 
dire impacts as well. These training 
cancelations will take an expected 
check out of their monthly budgets. 
Unlike Congress, these families have to 
operate within their means. There is no 
option for them to raise their debt ceil-
ing. 
These guardsmen and -women are in 
your States, in your districts, in your 
hometowns. They volunteered to serve 
our country, and they did so with only 
a single expectation in mind, that Con-
gress will have their backs. We need to 
live up to that commitment, just as 
they have for us. 
My MTR will also ensure the Capitol 
Police have the resources they need 
after the valiant efforts on January 6 
and in the days since.

It also provides targeted, necessary 
funding to enhance the physical secu-
rity of the Capitol. Without this fund-
ing, they, too, will see training delays 
and furloughs. 
Like the National Guard, the Capitol 
Police are always ready and always 
there. They stand watch for us when-
ever we need them. 
Mr. Speaker, I am encouraged by the 
progress Senators LEAHY and SHELBY 
have made. I hope we vote on their sup-
plemental before we leave for the week. 
But let me be crystal clear: This 
should have been accomplished the day 
after we learned of the Guard and Cap-
itol Police budget shortfalls. Instead, 
we have let silly partisan games and 
unrelated provisions leave our defend-
ers high and dry. 
To my colleagues, when you come to 
the floor later to vote on this MTR, 
and you put your voting cards in the 
machine, I want you to think about the 
guardsmen in your hometown, the cop, 
the teacher, the small business man 
who put on the uniform to defend us 
and protect us at home and abroad. I 
want you to think about that person 
and commit to supporting them and to 
supporting their family. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of my 
motion to recommit. 
Mr. RYAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self 30 seconds. Just a quick response, 
Mr. Speaker. 
We have passed a bill, the rescue 
package, that sent billions of dollars to 
the local communities to pay for po-
lice, fire, and first responders, State 
support for teachers. We passed a sup-
plemental bill out of this Chamber that 
reimbursed the National Guard and 
made huge investments into the Cap-
itol Police. In both instances, we didn’t 
get one Republican vote. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER), 
our distinguished leader. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for making that point, 
although I am somewhat sorry because 
I was going to make the same point. 
But I am going to make another point. 
First of all, let me say to those who 
may be watching, the gentleman who 
just spoke from Arkansas is one of my 
best friends in the Congress. He is a 
wonderful, wonderful person. He is dead 
flat wrong, however, in this assertion. 
His motion will not give a single cent 
to the National Guard, not a single 
cent to the police, not a single cent to 
anybody. 
All it will do is send the bill back to 
committee. It will delay this bill to do 
all the other things that it does from 
being enacted. 
It is sad that the Republicans in the 
Senate haven’t passed a single appro-
priation bill. And, golly day, it took a 
long time to get them to some agree-
ment on the supplemental, and then, 
when they agreed on the supplemental, 
they left the money for the National 
Guard out. 
So, I say to my friend from Arkansas, 
who is my dear, dear friend and a won-
derful person, your amendment, with 
all due respect, first of all, as you 
know, is not going to go anywhere. All 
you will do is return the bill to com-
mittee and slow this process down and 
not give a single cent to the National 
Guard or policemen, either Capitol Po-
lice or any other police. That is the re-
ality. 
Now, I wanted to rise and speak on 
behalf of this bill. I want to thank the 
chairman, Mr. RYAN, and I want to 
thank my good friend, who is also an-
other dear friend of mine. Unfortu-
nately, sometimes people think every-
body dislikes one another. I happen to 
like the gentlewoman who is the rank-
ing member, who is, I think, one of our 
best Members in the House on your 
side of the aisle. 
I know that this is a difficult bill in 
some cases for your side of the aisle. 
b 1615 
I have been here a long time. We just 
honored Jerry Lewis, who was the gen-
tleman from California who had your 
position and had the chairman’s posi-
tion. He was back and forth. They 
came to this House in a bipartisan way 
to say, let’s build this institution into 
the kind of institution that Americans 
want. 
That is what this bill does. This bill 
gives us the opportunity to hire, re-
tain, and pay competitively our staff, 
who are extraordinary people. The 
American people are getting more than 
their money’s worth with our staff, be-
cause they are extraordinarily able 
people, well-educated people, experi-
enced people, who make a difference 
for America. This bill seeks to com-
pensate them, not as much as they get 
in the private sector, but competi-
tively, at least with the executive de-
partments, so the executive depart-
ments are not taking all of our people. 
That is reason enough to be for this 
bill. 
Now, there is something in this bill I 
don’t like, and no other Member prob-
ably will come to this floor and say it. 
Members of the Congress of the United 
States have not received a cost of liv-
ing adjustment—forget about a raise— 
a cost of living adjustment since, I be-
lieve, 2009, for 11 or 12 years. And this 
bill says, oh, we are not going to take 
one this year either. 
Now, let me tell you something. The 
result of this irresponsible demagogic 
action—and I don’t say any personal 
aspersions on anybody—is that only 
rich people will be able to serve in the 
House of Representatives. 
Now, very frankly, I live alone. My 
wife died. I am in good shape. I don’t 
need the COLA. It will make no dif-
ference in my life. But there are a lot 
of people who come to this Congress 
with three or four children, and they 
have got to open a second residence, ei-
ther rent or buy here, and keep a resi-
dence at home, and they are strug-
gling. 
I know it doesn’t sound like you are 
going to struggle at $174,000. I don’t 
blame people who are making $60,000, 
$80,000 who say: What do you mean you 
are struggling? 
But the fact of the matter is, all I 
ask is, keep us even. Don’t give us a 
raise. Just keep us even. As the cost of 
living goes up, just keep us even in 
terms of our purchasing power. 
I am going to vote for this bill, but I 
sure don’t like that provision. Now, we 
Democrats have put it in; the Repub-
licans have put it in. I get it. I get the 
politics of it. 
But I will tell you, for a long period 
of time I worked with Trent Lott, with 
Tom DeLay, with ROY BLUNT, and with 
other Republican leaders—I seem to be 
the one that has been here consistently 
working on this—to make sure that at 
least 50 percent of us on each side 
voted to give us a COLA, to keep us 
even, so that we did not expect people 
who had their housing costs go up, 
their healthcare costs go up, their edu-
cational costs for children go up, to be 
frozen. 
It is tough on families. It is not 
tough on me, so I am not arguing from 
a personal standpoint. Very frankly, I 
am just fine. 
But I say this because I want the 
public to know that there is at least 
someone who is saying: Look, the job is 
worth it. You may not think we are 
worth it, but the job is worth at least 
keeping even. 
But this is a good bill. I am going to 
vote for it. There are provisions in 
other bills that I don’t like, but I vote 
for them, because on the whole, I think 
this is an excellent bill for this institu-
tion and for the American people. 
I urge everybody to vote ‘‘yes.’’

Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I wanted to speak on 
the motion to recommit that the gen-
tleman from Arkansas offered. I know 
it sounds like, with the majority, we 
are just going to have to agree to dis-
agree on this. 
I think that there are a lot of good 
things in this bill that I support. But 
the biggest challenge for me, having 
spent this year, like the rest of us, try-
ing to help our families, our constitu-
ents move on through COVID, help our 
small businesses survive, and then 
starting off this year in the manner 
that we did and recognizing the impact 
on not just the Capitol campus, but the 
men and women who protect us, the 
Capitol Police, I really feel like in this 
bill, the Legislative Branch appropria-
tions, there needed to be some signifi-
cant reforms to some of the failures in 
response that we experienced. 
Now, I know that there are other ef-
forts, not related to this bill, that are 
looking at other actors, other players. 
I am setting all of that aside because I 
don’t have control over that. But I do 
have a say here, with my voting card, 
on the Legislative Branch appropria-
tions bill. 
What is frustrating to me—and I 
heard, you know, my good friend from

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4163 
July 28, 2021 
Ohio and the Speaker mention: Well, 
we did this supplemental and put all of 
this other stuff in here for the Capitol 
Police. Well, there are things that were 
left out of that supplemental that are 
so crucially significant to reforms that 
will help prevent another January 6, 
and they are in the motion to recom-
mit. 
Let me explain a couple of those. One 
of those that we have in the Repub-
lican motion to recommit is a reform 
to the Capitol Police Board. We know 
that there was a major failure and 
breakdown in communication on the 
Capitol Police Board, which inhibited 
the response, the coordinated, collec-
tive response of the law enforcement 
here. 
Talk to any police officer who brave-
ly defended us, and they will tell you 
that they weren’t getting clear direc-
tives in their headpieces. They will tell 
you that the coordination effort from 
the leadership broke down, and they 
were doing everything they could on 
the front lines themselves. So a ration-
al response to that would be: Why did 
that break down and what can we do to 
fix it? 
One of those things is to provide 
oversight, 
congressional 
oversight, 
over that Capitol Police Board by re-
quiring that board, who made those de-
cisions, who left a lot of our police offi-
cers on their own, to meet together in 
front of congressional committees, the 
committees of oversight. 
As it stands now, we can’t get the en-
tire police board together in one room 
for a hearing. The gentleman and I—on 
Legislative Branch appropriations—we 
got to meet with different members of 
the police board in different hearings 
at different times. It was helpful. But 
to really correct the problem—and 
when you ask each of them: Where was 
your failing on January 6? They all do 
this—or they did this. There are now 
new actors in there. 
But I look at the function of that 
board, and I think, okay, common 
sense would be to put the Architect of 
the Capitol, the two Sergeants at 
Arms, and the Capitol Police chief all 
on a witness panel in front of the Leg-
islative Branch Appropriations Sub-
committee or the House Administra-
tion Committee or the Senate Rules 
Committee. 
That wasn’t in your supplemental, 
that is not in this Legislative Branch 
appropriations bill, or in any of Presi-
dent Biden’s rescue plans. We do throw 
a lot of money at it, but we are not fix-
ing a structural, fundamental problem 
that helped complicate our response. 
Our motion to recommit fixes that. 
It simply changes the language, and it 
requires them to come before the com-
mittees of jurisdiction together and an-
swer questions of oversight capacity 
from Members of Congress. That is a 
simple fix. It shouldn’t be partisan. It 
is not in the underlying bill, and it 
should be. Our motion to recommit 
does that. 
Another thing that we do in our mo-
tion to recommit to improve the under-
lying bill is, we require an improved 
and streamlined response, and we give 
that authority to the Capitol Police 
chief to call in the National Guard on 
a quick, developing emergency. 
One of the things that we heard in 
the aftermath of January 6 was he said, 
she said. I called them in, they said 
they couldn’t come. This person said 
they couldn’t come. I mean, we just got 
very convoluted responses into why the 
National Guard wasn’t here quickly. 
Again, I recognize there are other ef-
forts looking into other actors on that 
front. I am not getting into that. What 
I am talking about is what we have 
control over right here. 
The underlying Legislative Branch 
bill does not improve that streamline 
process. In fact, it leaves in place the 
process whereby the chief of police has 
to go through this bureaucratic, arcane 
process to get permission from every 
member of that board before they can 
respond to an immediate emergency 
and request the National Guard. Well, 
that was part of the problem on Janu-
ary 6. 
Our motion to recommit fixes that. 
It says that the Capitol Police chief, in 
an emergency, a quick, developing 
emergency, can call in the National 
Guard and have the authority to re-
quest them to come. It also has a 
failsafe in there that says, if the Cap-
itol Police Board gets their act to-
gether and meets quickly and sees the 
issue differently, they can rescind that 
authority. But what it does, it is an 
opt-in. Automatically, the police chief 
has authority to call in the reserves 
when there is an emergency. 
Just like you see where a chief in a 
major metropolitan area has the au-
thority to call in things, and then they 
are accountable to the mayor or to the 
city council, but they have that au-
thority. Right now the Capitol Police 
chief doesn’t have that authority, that 
was a problem on January 6. Unfortu-
nately, if this bill passes as it is, it will 
still be a problem today, 7 months 
later. 
Again, there are things in the under-
lying bill that I like and support, but it 
is like having the salt for your steak, 
but you don’t actually have the beef. 
You have got to have that sizzling 
steak and you add the salt to it and it 
is a wonderful meal. That is how I look 
at this. 
We do want to put the money forward 
to make sure that we are adding to the 
force and we are putting in training 
programs and that is in this underlying 
bill. Those are good things. But we 
have to change the fundamental flaws 
with how the Capitol Police Board op-
erates. 
This is the Legislative Branch appro-
priations bill. This is the appropriate 
place. I would have yielded if the House 
Administration Committee wanted to 
do that. Had they done it, you wouldn’t 
hear me piping up about it, but they 
haven’t. It needs to be done so that we 
are taking responsibility for failures 
here on our campus that we can cor-
rect. So I urge adoption of the motion 
to recommit. 
One more thing that I think is really 
significant, and this is where I differ 
from the gentleman from Maryland, 
who I also have great respect for, is the 
underlying bill talks about pay and 
making sure that we are adding more 
police officers to the force. I am there 
every day of the week and twice on 
Sunday. The problem is, they are going 
to hit a cap. 
So when a police officer, which we 
saw in January, February, March, they 
would work their regular hours, and 
then because they were short-staffed 
and there weren’t enough officers on 
the force, they would be called to work 
overtime. They are accruing that over-
time, and at some point, they will have 
earned too much money to get paid all 
of it because there is a cap in law that 
says they can only make so much. 
The underlying bill does not fix that 
cap. However, our motion to recommit 
does. Our motion to recommit removes 
that cap so that those officers who are 
owed that overtime, because they 
worked their tails off weeks on end, 
will be able to get that pay and not 
risk being furloughed as we get to the 
end of the year. 
Again, there are good things in the 
underlying bill, but it is not quite good 
enough. We can make it better. We can 
make it better by adopting the motion 
to recommit. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. RYAN. Mr. Speaker, I am pre-
pared to close, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. 
HERRERA 
BEUTLER. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume for the purpose of clos-
ing. 
Again, I just want to say it has been 
a privilege to be in this process. 
You know, it is ironic to me, because 
the Legislative Branch appropriations 
bill is generally one that significantly 
only impacts the Capitol community. I 
serve an amazing district in southwest 
Washington, 2,500-plus miles away from 
this campus. Generally, the Legislative 
Branch appropriations bill isn’t high 
on their radar, until this year, until we 
saw that there are events and there are 
actors who we are going to have to pro-
tect against. 
We are going to have to protect the 
guests and the visitors. This is the peo-
ple’s House, and I want the people from 
my district to have the right and the 
trust to come here and feel safe, to be 
able to have their voices heard. That is 
why this bill went from kind of being 
one that most people didn’t pay atten-
tion to, to a lot more attention, a lot 
more front and center. 
b 1630 
It is such an honor and privilege to 
get to work on this because I believe, 
in a very strong spirit of bipartisan-
ship, we can make sure that we are lift-
ing up and girding up the Capitol Po-
lice force, making sure that the Ser-
geant at Arms is working together

with the Architect of the Capitol to en-
sure the safety and continuity of the 
work of the people’s House. 
This is the Constitution in action. It 
is a privilege to get to work on this. I 
think that we can improve this under-
lying bill. I think that we need to 
adopt the motion to recommit. I think 
we need to introduce some of these 
ideas so that we can stave off a con-
tinuing resolution in the eleventh 
hour. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the 
motion to recommit, and in its ab-
sence, I do believe we need to send this 
bill back in order to get it completely 
right. I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. RYAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume to 
close. 
This is a good bill, and we have put a 
lot of work into this bill. The essence 
of the Legislative Branch appropria-
tions bill is an understanding that ev-
erybody that works on Capitol Hill is a 
public servant. 
The Capitol Police, those on the dais, 
the people who clean the offices, the 
people who do all of the construction, 
the young staffers, the middle-age 
staffers, the older staffers have spent 
sometimes decades trying to make this 
government run and help this govern-
ment run. 
This bill is an opportunity for us to 
continue to invest into those people, 
making sure that they can stay here, 
they can work here, they have com-
petitive wages, competitive benefits 
compared to the executive branch, 
compared to the judicial branch, com-
pared to the private sector; and also 
knowing and understanding that we 
have an obligation to protect this Cap-
itol. 
That is what we have done in this 
bill. We have made increases to Mem-
bers’ allowances so that they can main-
tain their staff and the talent that 
they have. We are making sure that we 
have a paid internship program here so 
that some young person from Youngs-
town, Ohio, or some small town or city 
across the United States can actually 
take advantage of the opportunity to 
stay for a summer or semester in one 
of the most expensive housing markets 
in the whole United States. 
I am very proud of the investments 
we are making in this bill. I am proud 
of all of the efforts to protect this Cap-
itol, the first branch of our democracy, 
and I am very much looking forward to 
voting on this. This will provide the 
needed funding for the day-to-day oper-
ations of the House. I urge all Members 
of this body to support this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance

I urge my colleagues to support the

Ms.

Mr. 
Speaker, I claim time in opposition, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. RYAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Illi-
nois (Ms. KELLY). 
Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in support of the Center for 
Audit Excellence and its mission in 
supporting and assisting auditing orga-
nizations 
domestically 
and 
inter-
nationally. 
A part of the Government Account-
ability Office, the Center for Audit Ex-
cellence provides training and assist-
ance to auditing organizations, fos-
tering accountability from local gov-
ernments in the United States and for-
eign governments across the globe. 
One of the Center’s most essential 
missions is aiding supreme audit insti-
tutions of nations that receive U.S. for-
eign assistance. This helps instill good 
governance and ensures that U.S. tax 
dollars are being used efficiently. 
Currently, the Center for Audit Ex-
cellence is funded almost exclusively 
by fees. They do not have dedicated 
funding and must rely on USAID mis-
sions or local and foreign governments 
approaching them for their services. 
Providing dedicated funding will allow 
for the Center to have more predictable 
budget cycles and will expand their 
reach in helping governments establish 
sound audit practices. 
Not only is there a need for dedicated 
funding, but there is also a need for 
more funding at the Center for Audit 
Excellence. Providing more funding 
will expand the Center’s global foot-
print and reach more countries’ su-
preme audit institutions. This critical 
funding would help ensure that govern-
ments around the globe and here at 
home in the United States have the 
training and assistance to strengthen 
oversight capacity and reduce govern-
ment waste. 
Helping to build auditing capacity 
cuts down on government corruption 
and promotes good governance. Within 
the U.S., enhanced auditing capacity

strengthens local government practices 
so they better respond to their citizens’ 
needs. Internationally, greater audit-
ing capacity helps low-income and de-
veloping 
nations 
increase 
account-
ability and the responsible use of pub-
lic funds. 
The United States provides billions 
of dollars of foreign assistance each 
year, and even more is sent to State 
and local governments. Providing dedi-
cated funding for the Center for Audit 
Excellence will help ensure that U.S. 
tax dollars are spent wisely and as in-
tended. 
Ms. 
HERRERA 
BEUTLER. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. MCCAR-
THY), the minority leader. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in opposition to the amendments and 
to this bill. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
earlier 
today 
the 
Speaker of the House said that people 
who are fully vaccinated but don’t sup-
port wearing a mask are morons. She 
went on to say that the House should 
follow the science. 
Madam Speaker, you don’t know the 
facts nor the science, so let’s talk 
about it. 
The Speaker is referring to the CDC 
current recommendation. I just left 
speaking with Dr. Monahan from the 
House. He said he used the CDC rec-
ommendation on a report that hasn’t 
been printed yet. He did not know that 
the report is based upon India, about a 
vaccine that is not approved in Amer-
ica. And now he did not know that it 
didn’t even pass peer review. 
That is why vaccinated people in this 
House now have to wear a mask. There 
is no science. But I guess the Speaker 
must have not known that. 
Why wouldn’t the Speaker know the 
facts? Do you know what frustrates 
Americans the most? Hypocrisy. They 
hate the idea that you tell people if 
you get vaccinated, you don’t have to 
wear a mask. First, they tell us don’t 
wear a mask, wear a mask, wear two 
masks, then take the mask off. 
They said if Americans got vac-
cinated, we would get our lives back. 
And we did, thanks to Operation Warp 
Speed and the past administration. 
But what they also hate about hypoc-
risy is when you break your own rules. 
It is kind of like telling America you 
can’t go get your hair cut, but you get 
caught on camera because you do it. Or 
you tell people you can’t go out to din-
ner, but in my same State, the State 
that the individual got the haircut, 
that Governor went out to dinner with 
a lot of people. 
Today the Speaker, who didn’t know 
her own science and said names to peo-
ple, broke her own rules. Twice today I 
saw the Speaker in a crowded room 
without a mask, less than 24 hours 
after imposing the mask mandate, 
which, again, is not based upon a 
study. It is based upon a study in India, 
based upon a vaccine that isn’t ap-
proved in America, and it didn’t pass 
peer review. 
Could this be a plan to try to keep 
our schools closed? 
Worst of all, this administration and 
now this House has broken the coun-
try’s trust. One size fits all. 
You know, if you read the CDC rec-
ommendation, it said you only should 
wear the mask for the hot spots. I am 
sure the gentleman on the other side 
knows which States and which cities 
are hot spots, because those are the 
facts. You can see the facts. You can 
read the facts. You can understand the 
facts. 
So what is Washington? The vaccina-
tion rate for the Members of Congress 
is over 85 percent, and as of today the 
transmission rate on the Capitol cam-
pus is less than 1 percent. Well, the 
facts will tell us this isn’t a hot spot, 
so the CDC recommendation doesn’t 
apply to us. 
Meanwhile, the hospitalization rate 
for the people who are vaccinated is 
0.003. As Washington Post columnist 
Henry Olsen points out, you are more 
likely to get struck by lightning than 
be hospitalized with the vaccine. It 
must be a stormy day in the House. 
You know what is interesting? We 
serve in this Chamber, we represent 
our districts, and we have Senators 
who represent our States just down the 
hall. The science based upon the 
Speaker of this House changes some-
where around the rotunda. 
You see, you have to wear your mask 
here, otherwise you are fined; because 
that is what government should do, 
they should punish people. You get 
vaccinated. But if you walk across the 
hall, you get somewhere around the ro-
tunda, you don’t have to wear it any-
more. Somehow the science is dif-
ferent. 
One thing we do know about COVID, 
it affects older people different than 
younger. Facts tell us people who serve 
in the Senate on average are older than 
the people in the House. But the 
science and the health over there is dif-
ferent than in here. 
It is interesting, too, because I re-
member a short time ago when we had 
the mask mandate during one of the 
impeachments the Democrats brought 
up, the managers wore their masks 
here, but as they walked to the Senate, 
they were able to take them off. 
I am not quite sure how much COVID 
lives on this side of the building. That 
must be science. That must be what 
the Speaker was talking about. 
b 1645 
The past administration worked hard 
for Operation Warp Speed. I am proud 
of the fact of what we voted for. When 
we brought up bills on this floor that 
talked about working toward a vac-
cine, that is where the money went, 
not the trillions of dollars that were 
wasted that now gave us inflation. 
Americans want to get back to work, 
back to school, and back to health. But 
we now have a majority that doesn’t 
want to base anything on science. They 
want to base something on a report 
that is not printed, that can’t pass peer 
review, based upon the country of 
India, based upon a vaccine that is not 
even approved in America, because the 
facts and the science are that the vac-
cines in America work. They are effec-
tive. They are free. 
I got a vaccine in December. I rec-
ommend all Americans get a vaccine. 
It is a concern we all have. We go 
every day trying to get more people 
vaccinated. What do you think the 
message is today? Those who run this 
side of this building believe now if you 
are vaccinated, you have to wear a 
mask even though the science doesn’t 
say you should. I am not sure how 
many more people are going to rush to 
get vaccinated. 
But it is just like their philosophy. 
They want to mandate. They want to 
impose. They want to tell you when 
you can go to school, when you can eat. 
Do you know what they are going to 
do if you walk into this building with-
out a mask? They are going to charge 
you $500. Why? Because they have the 
power to do it. 
You walk across the hall, not quite 
sure where they morph it into a dif-
ferent science, you don’t have to. 
Mark my words, this is just the be-
ginning. In a few weeks, schools are 
supposed to open again. We know what 
the science says about COVID with 
children. I think you are going to start 
seeing new reports. They won’t be 
printed, but they will try to keep the 
schools closed. 
Maybe if I whisper, the President will 
listen. He tries it. 
Then, they will try to shut our busi-
nesses down one more time. Operation 
Warp Speed provided vaccines that 
were tested, that worked, that are ef-
fective. The study, the science, proves 
it so. The hospitalization rates prove it 
so. 
I don’t know of one person in this 
Chamber that is going to get struck by 
lightning today. But I do know, even 
though the odds are better you get 
struck by lightning than being hos-
pitalized if you are vaccinated, we are 
all going to have to wear a mask, or we 
have to pay $500. 
I don’t know, the gentleman over 
there is going to run for the Senate. 
Maybe he wants to do that so he 
doesn’t have to wear a mask. The 
science over there is better. 
Mr. RYAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. TAKANO), the distinguished 
chairman of the Veterans’ Affairs Com-
mittee. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Ohio for yielding. I 
am pleased to join my colleagues in 
supporting this en bloc, which includes 
a symbolic amendment in support of 
the Office of Technology Assessment, 
otherwise known as OTA. 
The reestablishment of OTA has been 
a top priority of mine since I first came 
to Congress in 2013. Since then, debates 
around emerging technologies and con-
cepts have caught this Congress by sur-
prise as we struggle to legislate on

complex issues of technological and so-
cietal importance. 
Before OTA was defunded in 1995, the 
office served a critical role in providing 
Members of Congress and staff with 
nonpartisan and expert advice on com-
plex scientific and technical issues. 
OTA served as a model of good govern-
ance and innovation in government, 
and believe me, we could use OTA now 
in this environment of dissembling and 
shading of the truth around vaccines. 
Today, OTA would be invaluable as 
we 
debate 
issues 
related 
to 
cryptocurrencies; nonfungible tokens, 
or NTFs; cybersecurity; artificial intel-
ligence; and other developing tech-
nologies throughout our society. 
We understand the importance and 
value of CRS and GAO when it comes 
to researching and understanding com-
plex issues. That is not up for debate. 
Yet, OTA is necessary to ensure Con-
gress is informed and knowledgeable on 
some of the most complex issues facing 
our society today. 
Staff who will work alongside CRS 
and GAO to provide this expertise will 
help this legislature not only catch up 
with the rest of our economy but truly 
understand how these new forms of 
technology affect our economy in ev-
eryday life. 
The foundation of good policy is ac-
curate and objective analysis, and the 
reestablishment of the Office Tech-
nology Assessment is how we will pass 
new and forward-thinking laws for our 
country. 
Ms. 
HERRERA 
BEUTLER. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. RYAN. Mr. Speaker, may I ask 
how much time I have remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 51⁄4 minutes remaining. 
Mr. RYAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time. 
I am prepared to close on this bill, 
but since my name was invoked, I want 
to make a couple of comments to what 
the minority leader was saying, maybe 
much to the chagrin of staff who is 
here. 
Fear, fear, fear. The Attending Phy-
sician of the United States Capitol, the 
top doctor for Congress, asked us to 
put on masks when we come to a 
Chamber with 435 people. I hate these 
things. It is absolutely terrible having 
to put this back on. We do it because 
the top doctor for all of us asked us to. 
I may not be from a hotspot. The 
Speaker may not be from a hotspot. 
Speaker PELOSI may not be from a 
hotspot. Somebody in this Chamber is 
coming from a hotspot. Somebody rep-
resents the hotspots. They get in a 
plane, and they fly here, and they 
interact with all of us. Then, we leave 
here, and we go home to our families. 
Some take care of their sick parents. 
Some take care of kids who may have 
an autoimmune disorder. 
I find it absolutely immature and ap-
palling to somehow diminish it to try 
to score cheap, political points. That is 
exactly what we saw a few minutes 
ago. That is beneath a minority leader 
of one of the major political parties in 
the United States of America, saying 
we should take no caution that some-
one from a hotspot is working in this 
Chamber and could potentially get 
someone infected that could go home 
to 
a 
sick 
parent 
or 
an 
immunocompromised kid. 
That is beneath us, and it is cer-
tainly 
beneath 
leadership 
here 
in 
Washington, D.C. 
I am sorry, I had to comment on that 
because it is very frustrating. We are 
dealing with a complicated pandemic, a 
new strain, and we are trying to figure 
everything out. 
The Attending Physician says, since 
you are a group from all over the coun-
try, be a little bit cautious. And he 
gets mocked. This is the doctor we all 
go to. You are denigrating the Attend-
ing Physician? Has it gotten this bad 
here? We will be the first ones to go 
down there when we are sick, need an 
antibiotic, or to get a checkup. 
I mean, come on. Stop. Just stop 
with this craziness. We are trying to be 
safe. We are trying to protect our fam-
ily members, our kids, our parents, 
close relatives. 
The minority leader mocks that and 
mocks the top doctor, who has a very 
distinguished record and a very distin-
guished career and spends his life mak-
ing sure we are healthy. It is shameful. 
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the amend-
ments en bloc, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

ant to House Resolution 567, the pre-

The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Ohio. 
Mr. RYAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self 45 seconds. 
The amendments en bloc include a 
number of proposals by my colleagues. 
This is a bipartisan amendment. 
It includes funding to prioritize the 
removal of accessibility barriers on the 
Capitol complex, conduct a study on 
security risks and technical limita-
tions of the Capitol switchboard sys-
tem, and provides for a collaborative 
drafting program to help Members’ of-
fices work better with the House Office 
of Legislative Counsel. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
important proposals contained in this 
amendment, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Madam 
Speaker, I rise to speak to the amend-
ments. 
Madam Speaker, I specifically call 
out the gentleman from Rhode Island’s 
amendment. It increases funding by 
$3.5 million for the Capitol Grounds ac-
count, and it is offset within the bill. 
The intent of these funds is to be used 
to prioritize the removal of accessi-
bility barriers on the Capitol complex. 
I am thrilled about this amendment. 
Parts of this building and the sur-
rounding complex were built over 100 
years ago, so, obviously, there are ac-
cessibility issues that today we are 
saying we are going to remove those 
barriers. 
I commend both of the bipartisan 
amendments in the amendments en 
bloc. I urge Members to please support 
it. I think this does good work. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I urge a 
‘‘yes’’ vote, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the en bloc which includes 
my amendment, #10, to increase funding for 
the Capitol Grounds account to prioritize the 
removal of accessibility barriers. 
Madam Chair, the Capitol Complex was not 
built with accessibility in mind, and as the first 
quadriplegic to serve in Congress, I’m re-
minded of this every day. 
For the past two decades, I’ve worked 
closely with the Architect of the Capitol to ad-
dress these barriers, and I’m grateful for the 
progress we’ve made so far. Yet many phys-
ical barriers still remain, and we need to re-
move them proactively so that all Members of

I thank Chairman RYAN and the Legislative 
Branch Subcommittee for including report lan-
guage under the Capitol Grounds account di-
recting the Architect of the Capitol to prioritize 
the removal of accessibility barriers. 
Yet the reality is, proactively achieving this 
requires dedicated funding, which is what my 
amendment provides. l thank the Chair and 
Ranking Member for supporting it, and I urge 
my colleagues to support the en bloc and the 
underlying bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms.

The question is on the amendments

gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. 
HERRERA BEUTLER) each will control 10 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Ohio. 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I have offered this 
en bloc for purposes of legislative effi-
ciency. I strongly oppose it. 
This amendments en bloc makes se-
vere and harmful changes to the bill 
under consideration. This amendment 
would strike language that will enable 
noncitizens who meet requirements 
under DACA to be employed by the 
United States Congress and to cut 
funding from the Office of Diversity 
and Inclusion. 
Let’s address the first point around 
DACA. 
This is allowing Dreamers to work 
for the legislative branch. I can’t figure 
out for the life of me why the minority 
would like to refuse the American 
Dream to people who came to the 
United States as children, for people 
who are, for all intents and purposes, 
Americans. 
I have met these recipients, these 
Dreamers, and they have personally 
told me their stories. I encourage each 
of my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle to talk with a Dreamer, to listen 
to their stories. It is absolutely heart-
breaking. They have done absolutely 
nothing wrong. 
They were brought to this country by 
no choice of their own. Their parents 
brought them here. The United States 
is their home. They have built their 
lives here, whether that means getting 
an education, raising a family, or con-
tributing to our economy. 
We are a generous and compassionate 
Nation always looking to form a more 
perfect Union, a country that has em-
pathy for a struggling family in a new 
country, in a country that lifts up our 
younger generation so that they can 
have a better future. 
The vast majority of Americans over-
whelmingly 
support 
allowing 
these 
young people to continue their relent-
less pursuit of the American Dream be-
cause they knew in their hearts that 
they are American. As Americans, 
there is no better place for them to 
continue to serve their country than 
here in the United States House of Rep-
resentatives, the people’s House. To 
deny them this opportunity is about 
the most un-American thing we could 
do here today. 
Madam Speaker, again, their parents 
brought them here, and they have been 
here for years and years and years. 
They should have an opportunity to 
give back to this country. 
Madam Speaker, I am opposed, on 
the second point, to decreasing funding 
for the Office of Diversity and Inclu-
sion by $1.5 million. 
The Office of Diversity and Inclusion 
is committed to maintaining a diverse 
and inclusive workforce in the House of 
Representatives. Their mission is to as-
sist in developing practices to recruit 
and retain a diverse workforce. 
I am proud of this year’s bill. It pro-
vides $3 million for the office in fiscal 
year 2022 and increases their staff cap 
from 7 to 10. The $1.5 million in addi-
tional funding for 2022 and expanding 
staff cap would give them the needed 
funding to support ongoing operations 
while providing additional flexibility 
to expand their work. 
Additionally, this increase in funding 
will enable ODI to implement various 
other provisions that are included in 
the Legislative Branch bill, such as as-
sisting the Chief Administrative Offi-
cer in the Office of Congressional 
Workplace Rights to establish a task 
force about the workforce in the House. 
As I mentioned in my opening re-
marks, this task force will develop a 
methodology for regularly serving the 
House workforce on pay and benefits 
issues and provide guidance to us on 
how we could create a centralized 
human 
resources 
hub 
to 
improve 
human resource management practices 
throughout the House. 
Finally, this increase in funds will 
allow the Office of Diversity and Inclu-
sion to conduct a feasibility study on 
re-creating a centralized House intern-
ship program. We have citizens in this 
country, 
young 
students—White, 
Black, Brown—who can’t afford to 
come here to work. They can’t afford 
to get an internship here. They work 
hard, do everything right, try to climb 
the ladder. We want to provide oppor-
tunity. 
This money will help reach out to 
those people and bring them into the 
legislative branch to give them the ex-
perience they need, the contacts they 
need to develop, the education that 
they need to move forward. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud of what 
we have in this bill, and I will oppose 
this 
amendment. 
It 
is 
vital 
we 
prioritize initiatives to promote diver-
sity and the opportunity for people 
from all over the country to come work 
in the legislative branch and intern in 
the legislative branch. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
oppose 
this 
amendments en bloc, and I urge my 
colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Madam 
Speaker, I yield such time as he may 
consume to the gentleman from Wis-
consin (Mr. GROTHMAN). 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, as 
part of this en bloc, we have two sepa-
rate amendments. I will address them 
separately. 
The one amendment that was just ad-
dressed concerns DACA recipients and 
whether they should be hired here. 
In 2018, we had 830,000 Americans 
sworn in to be new citizens. I don’t 
think anybody can accuse the United 
States of being shy about letting other 
people in this country. 
Obviously, if we make permanent the 
policy that any young person who is 
brought here automatically can work 
their way to be a United States citizen, 
we will have what we currently see at 
the southern border. We will have, 
again and again and again, parents 
coming here either asking for asylum 
or sending their children here by them-
selves, knowing that we are not going 
to enforce the immigration laws. 
Now, I think everybody here knows 
that the day will probably come where 
something is done with some DACA re-
cipients, but it shouldn’t be all DACA 
recipients. The idea of establishing 
right now that if you came here, you 
automatically are—I think the infer-
ence is you are going to become a cit-
izen by saying that you can work in 
the Capitol when these jobs are highly 
in demand for many of our own citizens 
is a little ridiculous. 
One of my amendments removes the 
provision that says that people who are 
still in this country illegally can wind 
up working for the legislature. 
The second amendment concerns the 
Office of Diversity and Inclusion. I 
think the gentleman from Ohio kind of 
mischaracterized the amendment. We

July 28, 2021 
are not cutting anything here. We are 
leaving things in the same place they 
were in the last budget. 
We have spent money in the last 12, 
14 months of this institution like never 
before. We went through trillions of 
dollars. That is one of the reasons why 
we have such high inflation, one of the 
reasons why young people are going to 
find it so difficult to buy a house com-
pared to the older generation, one of 
the reasons why the cost of food is up. 
We cannot, as we go line by line 
through this budget, create a situation 
in which we are doubling lines in the 
budget. That is what we are doing here. 
The other things that are particu-
larly irritating about this, if you go 
through the Office of Diversity and In-
clusion, almost all the things they pur-
port to do are done somewhere else in 
the legislative branch. They are really 
not adding a lot. 
Obviously, it is one of these groups 
that I think is going to train people to 
view themselves not as individuals but 
more as a group, which I don’t think is 
helpful for America as a whole. But, 
again, after going so overwhelmingly 
in debt, we have a Legislative Branch 
budget that is up 13 percent. 
It would be interesting to ask how 
many Americans out there, how many 
of their individual salaries or com-
pensation went up by 13 percent in the 
last year. But for Congress, no big deal. 
Legislative Branch is up 13 percent, 
House Office of Diversity and Inclusion 
doubled. On its face, preposterous. I bet 
if you polled the American public, I 
wonder if there are any lines in this 
budget they want doubled, but particu-
larly in an agency that, like I said, 
their function can be dealt with by 
other groups. 
Madam Speaker, in any event, I en-
courage passage of this en bloc and the 
two amendments.

FY 2020 Project Summary 
The General Services Administration (GSA) proposes a repair and alteration project for 
4600 Silver Hill North and 4600 Silver Hill South at the Suitland Federal Center in 
Suitland, Maryland. The proposed project will upgrade building systems and renovate 
space to support the co~location of three agencies. This project will provide a more 
efficient layout that both improves agency utilization and allows for the recapture and 
backfill of approximately 367,000 rentable square feet (RSF) of underutilized federally 
owned space. The 4600 Silver Hill North and 4600 Silver Hill South buildings are 
currently occupied by the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Economic Analysis {BEA). 
Approximately 367,000 RSF of the space occupied by these agencies will be 
reconfigured to allow for the co-location of the Department of Labor-Bureau of Labor 
Statistics (BLS), currently located in 710,330 RSF (508,000 usable square feet [USF]) of 
leased space at the Postal Square Building, 2 Massachusetts Ave. NE in Washington, DC. 
Additional work will be undertaken to refresh the space occupied by Census to improve 
overall efficiency and to accommodate the staff relocated to make space available for the 
BLS personnel. BLS,s 48-percent decrease in RSF and relocation to 4600 Silver Hill 
North and South will provide a Federal annual least cost avoidance of approximately 
$19,400,000 and an agency rent savings of approximately $9,700,000.

Committee on Environment and Public Works approving this prospectus will constitute approval to extend 
the lease at Postal Square as described herein.

To accommodate this consolidation, GSA will perfonn building demolition, interior 
alterations, and electrical, HV AC, plumbing, and life safety upgrades. 
GSA currently leases space in the Postal Square Building for BLS. This lease expires on 
May 14, 2022. In order to allow for the proposed alterations and relocation to the 
Suitland Federal Center, GSA may need to extend the existing lease for a limited amount 
of time. GSA will execute such interim leasing actions as necessary to ensure continued 
housing of the tenant agency and will ensure the term of the lease extension coincides 
with the schedule of occupancy. It is in the best interest of the Government to avert the 
financial risk of holdover tenancy.

BLS's current location in the Postal Square Building houses 1,801 personnel who are 
responsible for carrying out the Bureau's mission of collecting, analyzing, and 
disseminating essential economic information to support public and private decision-
making. The current lease expires on May 14, 2022, and BLS requires continued housing 
to carry out its mission. 
The proposed investment in and space optimization of the North and South buildings at 
the Suitland Federal Center will facilitate the achievement of more efficient utilization 
rates for all three Federal organizations, and reduce rental payments made by BLS, 
Census, and BEA. BLS will improve its utilization by downsizing its real estate footprint 
by almost half, from the current 710,330 RSF to approximately 367,000 RSF, a decrease 
of over 340,000 RSF. A portion of the project budget will fund alterations at the Center to 
facilitate BLS's occupancy of this space. This project will allow GSA to reduce private-
sector lease payments by an estimated $19 million.

Prospectus Number: 
PCA-0001-MU22 
FY 2022 Project Summarv 
The General Services Administration (GSA) proposes the reconfiguration and renovation of space 
within Government-mvned and leased buildings during fiscal year (FY) 2022 to support GSA's 
ongoing consolidation efforts to improve space utilization, optimize inventory, decrease reliance 
on leased space, and reduce the Government's environmental footprint. 
Since the inception of the Consolidation Activities Program in FY 2014, · GSA has 
received $327,334,000 in support of the program and, through FY 2021, has funded 87 
projects. When complete. these 87 projects will result in more than a 1.8 million usable square 
foot space reduction, thereby reducing agency rental payments to GSA by $76 million annually 
and generating more than S 163,000,000 in annual Govemment lease cost avoidance. These 
projects will more than recover the initial capital investment after just two years of project 
completion and will continue to accme additional savings over the life of these assets. 
FY 2022 Committee Approval and Appropriation Requested ............................... $25,000,000 
Program Summarv 
As pan of its ongoing effort to improve space utilization, optimize invei1tory, decrease reliance on 
leased space, and reduce the Government's environmental footprint, GSA is identifying 
consolidation oppoitunitics within 'its inventory of real property assets. These opportunities are 
presented through surveys and studies, pai1nering with customer agencies and agency initiatives. 
Projects will vary in size by location and agency mission and operations: however, no single 
project will exceed $20 million in GSA costs. Funds will support consolidation of customer 
agencies and will not be available for GSA intemal consolidations. Preference will be given to 
projects that result in an office utilization rare of 130 USF per person or less and a total project 
payback period of 10 years or less. 
Typical projects include the following: 
• 
Reconfiguration and alteration of existing Federal space to accommodate incoming agency 
relocation/consolidation. (Note: may include reconfigurations of existing occupied Federal 
tenant space); and 
• 
Incidental alterations and system upgrades, such as fire sprinklers or heating, ventilation, 
and air conditioning, needed as part of relocation and consolidation. 
Projects will be evaluated using the following criteria: 
• 
Preference will be given to projects that are identified as a reduction opportunity by both 
GSA and the subject agency, and that meet the other criteria.

• Proposed consolidation projects will result in a reduction in annual rent paid by the 
impacted customer agency. 
• 
Preference is given to consolidations within or into federally owned buildings over 
consolidations within or into leased space. 
• 
Consolidation of expiring !eases into federally owned buildings will be given preference 
over those business cases for lease cancellations that include a cancellation cost. 
• 
Co~location with other agencies v,:ith shared resources and special space will be given 
preference. 
• 
Links to other consolidation projects will be given preference. 
Justification 
GSA continually analyzes opportunities to improve space utilization and realize long-tenn cost 
savings for the Government. Funding for space consolidations is essential so that GSA can execute 
those opportunities. 
Projects funded under this program will enable agencies to consolidate within Govemment-
conlrolled leased space or relocate from either Government-controlled leased or federaliy O\vned 
space to federally owned space that more efficiently meets mission needs. These consolidations 
will result in improved space utilization, cost savings for the American taxpayers and a reduced 
environmental impact.

Justification 
On an average day, 13,800 POVs and approximately 9,500 pedestrians enter the U.S. 
through this LPOE. The existing facilities arc undersized relative to existing traffic loads 
and obsolete in terms of inspection officer safety and border security. The space required 
to accommodate modem inspection technologies is not available in the existing facility. 
\Vhen completed, the project will provide the port operation with adequate operational 
space, reduced traffic congestion, and a safe environment for port employees and visitors. 
Summarv of Encrgv. \Vater. Sustainabilitv. and Climate Risk Compliance 
This project will be designed to conform to requirements of the Fcu:ifities Standards for 
the Public Buildings Service. GSA encourages design opportunities to increase energy and 
water efficiency (including renewable energy and fossil free measures), adherence to 
sustainable design principles, and minimizing climate risk liabilities above the minimum 
perfom1ance criteria in a manner that is life cycle cost-effective.

The General Services Administration (GSA) proposes a repair and alteration project at the 
histo1ic Tacoma Union Station (TUS) located at 1717 Pacific Avenue, Tacoma, WA, to 
address seismic deficiencies and undertake targeted buildjng system modernizations. GSA 
exercised the purchase option committing the Government to the $1 purchase when the 
existing lease agreement expires on September 20, 2022. GSA's Seismic Rating System 
Report, released on March 31, 2016, lists TUS as having one of the highest seismic risk 
ratings in the GSA portfolio. In addition to the critical structural repairs and upgrades, the 
proposed project will modernize the building's outdated systems, address life-safety 
upgrades, alter interior space, and undertake exterior repairs. The facility is ctmently 
owned by the City of Tacoma. When the facility comes into the Federal inventory, the 
Government will realize an annual lease cost avoidance of approximately $6,400,000.

Construction of Union Station began in 1909 and was completed in May 1911 in the Beaux-
Arts style of architecture. The historic building was completely renovated and restored, 
and a three-story addition \Vas constructed. The United States District Court for the 
Western District of Washington began occupancy in 1992 under a 35-year renovation lease 
purchase transaction authorized by Congress in 1987. 
TUS is made up of 3 buildings: the historic building, the com1s' addition building, and the 
link building. The focal point of TUS is the 90-foot high central dome, which rests on a 
central pavilion with large arched openings on each side. Flat-roofed synm1etrical wings 
flank the pavilion to the north and south. Ten courtrooms are provided for the federal courts 
in the 219,000 gross square foot facility, two within the north and south wings of the 1911 
building and eight in the addition. Union Station is listed in the National Register of 
Historic Places.

Justification 
The PJKK Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse complex houses about 60 agencies and 
serves as a main Federal location that covers Hawaii and Southern Pacific areas. Prior to 
2008, many of the PJKK Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse's existing building 
equipment and systems were original to the buildings and were near the end of their useful 
service. Through funding provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 
2009, a full modernization and renovation design was completed for both buildings in the 
complex, but a major renovation of only the courthouse was completed. The Federal 
Building has not undergone a major renovation since its construction in 1977. 
Elevator work will replace equipment that has met its useful life and will now meet current 
safety standards. The fire sprinkler system does not have rapid response heads that are 
now required, and the fire and life-safety devices do not meet current safety codes. The 
mechanical, electrical, and plumbing work \Vil! be addressed as part of the downsizing of 
the cafeteria, saving energy costs, and equipment will be replaced. Restroom floor flood 
drains will be installed (a toilet fixture failure caused extensive water damage due to a lack 
of floor drains in the original restrooms), and partition work will be completed on all floors, 
except on the recently renovated second floor, to meet cun·ent accessibility standards. 
Summarv of Energv, Water. Sustainabilitv, and Climate Risk Compliance 
This project will be designed to conforn1 to requirements of the Facilities Standards for 
the Public Buildings Service. GSA encourages design opportunities to increase energy and 
water efficiency (including rene\vable energy and fossil free measures), adherence to 
sustainable design principles, and minimizing climate risk liabilities above the minimum 
performance criteria in a manner that is life cycle cost-effective.

Proposed Project 
The proposed project replaces the failed roof system, flashing, and sealants with a new 
membrane roofing system coupled with high-efficiency insulation. 111e existing solar hot 
water/photovoltaic system will be temporarily removed and reinstalled after the new roof 
installation. The new roof system will meet high-perfonnance build,ing envelope design 
criteria and will also include the foll refurbishment of all original seals, gaskets, and glass 
panels to the existing public central lobby atrium skylight system. A roof anchor/fall arrest 
system will be installed throughout, including a skylight-specific system to provide 
increased personnel safeguards for all future exterior roof and skylight access. Interior leak 
repairs, removal of obsolete fire protection equipment, and an LED retrofit of atrium 
lighting are also included in the project.

The building's roofing system has not only reached the end of its useful life, but it has also 
experienced multiple catastrophic failures, including a significant billowing event 
requiring emergency repair action to refasten back to the substrate. Changing wind 
dynamics resulting from two ne\vly constructed adjacent 40+-story high-rise buildings 
could pose novel wind loading events that could exacerbate future failures. The building 
has limited fall protection anchors, risking personnel safety, especially related to the 
building's expansive atrium skylight, which currently has no dedicated fall protection 
system.

designed in the neo-classical style. It is one of the most significant strucnires in Cleveland's 
dO\vnt0\\11 cityscape and is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. 
The 
courthouse is approximately 227,000 gross square feet with 13 inside parking spaces. The 
facade is clad with granite and remains essentially the same as when it was originally 
constructed. Between 2002 and 2005, the courthouse was modernized for the primary use 
of the Bankruptcy Courts after the District Courts relocated to the newly constructed Stokes

Proposed Proiect 
The proposed project will replace the plaza's concrete slabs, restore the plaza's stmctural 
steel support system, replace the plaza and perimeter foundation wall's waterproofing 
systems, repair basement walls damaged from years of water infiltration, recondition the 
basement lift that serves the mail screening room, and replace the stmctural support system

$17,572,000 
The plaza's concrete, waterproofing membrane, and most of its supporting steel framing 
was last replaced in 1972, and the top slab was replaced in 1987. Sh ming was installed 
over a decade ago to support the sidevvalk vault structurally and to prevent the public 
sidewalk from collapsing. Maintenance and repairs are no longer sufficient for preventing 
water leaks through the plaza. 
The plaza's concrete structural slab is failing. Widespread deterioration under the p Iaza' s 
structural slab ranges from small spalls to large areas of complete delamination. The 
damage has gone beyond concrete and reinforcing deterioration to significant loss of 
strndural steel sections. The steel can be restored in some areas but will have to be replaced 
in others. The elevator lift that serves the mail screening room in the basement must remain 
operational during the project and will be used by the construction contractor for vertical 
conveyance. Refurbishment of the lift will be required after the plaza work is completed. 
The foundation wall's lack of waterproofing allows moisture and water to infiltrate through 
several cracks. Waterproofing that was applied in previous slab replacement projects only 
go down a few feet below grade and has worn away. The remainder of the foundation wall 
has no waterproofing. The wall moisture has corroded the full height of the vertical steel 
channels at the inside face of the wall that are likely a key part of the wall's strength.

There are two significant Daniel Chester French statues on the south elevation of the 
building. The statues are supported by both the building exte1ior wall and the sidewalk 
slab. Movement and deterioration of the sidewalk slab create a 1isk of cracking in the 
statues. The original clay tile floor slab supporting the base of the statues has fallen away. 
leaving only unreinforced cement topping between the steel beams and the statue base. A 
new support system needs to be installed to isolate the statues from the sidewalk slab.

the exterior concrete stairs will also be repaired. The project also includes improvements 
to the storm drain, mechanical infrastructure, including the exhaust ventilation system, 
electrical and lighting and fire and life-safety systems, and replacement of signage. Due to 
the extensive and disruptive nature of the proposed repairs, the garage will be closed for 
the duration of the project, and all of the official Government vehicles will be relocated to 
temporary, leased, off-site parking. Shuttle service will be provided to and from the

Justifica.tion 
The garage provides mission-critical parking for Federal agencies housed in the adjacent 
McNamara Federal Building, including secure parking for Federal law enforcement 
agencies. Original to the construction of the garage, the existing concrete slab strncture is 
rapidly deteriorating with spalling concrete and rnsted reinforced steel visible where 
sections of concrete have fallen from slabs. The asphalt-topped concrete decks are in very 
poor condition, with large potholes that have the potential to damage vehicles and injure 
pedestrians. Portions of the garage have been temporarily closed due to spalling concrete 
and water-related degradation. Plastic sheeting is in place in areas throughout the garage 
to protect Government vehicles, which have been damaged by leaking, con-oded pipes. 
Interim repairs put in place over the years are also susceptible to spalling due to the 
continued water penetration and de-icing salts. 
In addition to the needed structural repairs, the storm drain, fire and life-safety, electrical 
and mechanical, and emergency lighting systems are all failing and are noncompliant \Vith 
current codes. The majority of storm drains are cracked and inoperable, ,vhich forces water 
to seep through cracks in the concrete, causing further degradation of the structure. 
Sprinkler pipes and drain lines arc corroded throughout the garage, and the incidence of 
fr1ilurc is increasing over time. Water cannot drain properly causing vvatcr damage in 
occupied space of the Federal Building's basement. 
Shutting do\vn the parking structure for the durati<;m of the project allows for the 
completion of the repairs in one phase, thereby accelerating the schedule, reducing. 
coordination efforts, and reducing overall project costs. 
Summarv of Encrgv. \Vater. Sustainabilitv. and Climate Risk Compliance 
This project will design to confo1111 to requirements of the Facilities Standards.for the 
Public Buildings Service. GSA encourages design oppo1tunities to increase energy and 
water efficiency (including renewable energy and fossil free measures), adherence to 
sustainable design principles, and minimizing climate risk liabilities above the minimum 
perfom1ance criteria in a manner that is life cycle cost-effective.

The garage is over 40 years old and is in urgent need of a major renovation. The garage is 
suffering from multiple concrete-related failures, including delamination on the floor slabs 
and beams and slab reinforcement with extensive section loss; concrete spalling and 
delamination at some column facades; \Vater leakage on the underside of the supported 
level; and deteriorated expansion joints. 
The current electrical infrastructure will be 
upgraded/replaced to meet ctment codes. The installation of bollards on both the entrance 
and exit ramps of the garage will enhance security. 
Interim short-tem1 repairs have been undertaken with Minor Repair and Alteration program 
funds over the past decade in an attempt to address immediate safety measures. The 
corrosion, spalling, and delamination of the structure are threatening tenant and property 
safety. Sections of the garage have been closed due to the risk. Currently, 18 spaces are 
closed in the lower level of the garage due to foiling concrete and water leaks from the 
upper level that have damaged several vehicles. Additionally, fom spaces arc closed on the 
upper level due to deteriorated concrete and exposed rebar that pose a significant safety 
hazard. Until a major repair is completed, tenant safety will continue to be threatened, 
continued and expanded closures or SCL'.tions or the garage will be required, and continued 
degradation of the garage deck will continue.

The Holloway CT is located at 200 Northwest Fourth Street in dO\vntown Oklahoma City. 
The site is located immediately to the south of the former Alfred P. Murrah Federal Office 
Building that was destroyed in the 1995 bombing. 
Constructed in 1960, the 5•sto1y building contains 316,360 gross square feel and is eligible 
for listing in the National Register of Historic Places. The exterior wans are cornposed of 
cast co.ncrete panels with limited ornamental detailing and marble veneer at the upper 
pottion of the front facade. A full basement includes a small parking garage. A steel-framed 
skywalk connects this building to the PO-CT at the third-floor level. 
The PO-CT, located at 215 Dean A. McGee Avenue, opened in 1912. It was the first 
monumental building in Oklahoma City and was designed in the Beaux-Arts style. The 
building ,.vas expanded in 1919 and again in 1932. Tn 1988, GSA restored the public areas, 
including the fonner postal lobby, second floor courtroom ( 1912), and sixth floor 
courtroom ( 1932). 
The 220.438 gross square foot building was listed in the National Register of Historic 
Places in 1974 and is an early symbol of the Federal presence in the State of Oklahoma. It 
is a massive, nine-story (plus basement) structure. 
Tenant Agencies {both buildings) 
Judiciary, Department of Justice-U.S. Marshals Service, Department of the Interior, 
Department of Labor, Department of Agriculture, Department of Defense, GSA, and other 
smaller agencies. 
Proposed Project 
Desib:rn funding was received in FY 2020. The first constrnction phase is the full repair 
and alteration of the Holloway CT and exterior repairs to the PO~CT. The Holloway CT 
requires modernization of outdated building systems, including a complete HV AC 
replacement. Proposed interior constrnction in this building includes the replacement of

first phase. The HY AC systems have exceeded their useful lives and need to be replaced 
for tenant comfort and efficient operation. Outdated HV AC control systems and related 
electronic components need frequent repairs, and parts are no longer available. In addition, 
new controls will support separate control of air on different floors, which will improve 
tenant comfort and satisfaction. The supply, return, ventilation, and exhaust fans are all 
original to the buildings and nearing the end of their useful lives. In both buildings, public 
restrooms, elevator lobbies, and common areas need upgrades for A BAAS compliance. 
A replacement of lighting systems and electrical system components is needed to increase 
efficiency and comply with current code. Together, the buildings obtain only marginal 
energy performance. Inefficient and leaking windows are original to both buildings. 
Correction of window system deficiencies, along with repair to plaster. woodwork, and 
stone damaged by window leaks, is essential to the project. The fire alam1 systen1 is 
outdated and needs to be replaced. Scisrnic upgrades arc included to address increased 
seismic activity in the area. 
Plumbing components have exceeded their useful lives, and replacement parts are difficult 
to locate. Site work is needed to eliminate tripping hazards and comply with A BAAS. 
Summarv of Energv, \-Yater. Sustainabilitv. ancl Climate Risk Compliance 
This project will be designed to conform to requirements of the Facilities Standards for 
the Public Buildings Service. GSA encourages design opportunities to increase energy and 
water efficiency (including renewable energy and fossil free measures), adherence to 
sustainable design principles, and minimizing climate risk liabilities above the minimum 
performance criteria in a manner that is life cycle cost-effective.

AMERICANS NEED TO GET 
VACCINATED 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise to-
night to speak on the ongoing threat 
posed by COVID–19, particularly the 
delta variant, which is highly con-
tagious 
and 
is 
rapidly 
spreading 
throughout our country. 
After 18 months of this pandemic we 
are all yearning for a return to nor-
malcy, but we must get vaccinated to 
prevent further spread of this virus. 
Recent data show that 99 percent of 
deaths due to COVID–19 are among 
those who are unvaccinated. 
In Ohio, fewer that 50 percent of resi-
dents have received their first dose of 
the vaccine. 
We have the tools to emerge from 
this crisis, but we must use them. 
These vaccines are safe. They are effec-
tive. And we must all do our part to get 
our loved ones, our friends, and our-
selves vaccinated as quickly as pos-
sible. 
Finally, 
I 
want 
to 
thank 
our 
healthcare sheroes and heroes in Cuya-
hoga, Erie, Lorain, Lucas, and Ottowa 
Counties. They are doing courageous 
work saving lives every day. 
Get vaccinated. 
f 
CRISIS AT THE SOUTHERN 
BORDER 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the 
alarming and growing crisis on our 
southern border. 
Despite the rhetoric surrounding this 
issue, the reality is families and unac-
companied children are arriving at our 
southern border in greater numbers 
than in the past decades. 
June of this year alone saw a 450 per-
cent increase in border encounters 
compared to a year ago, and this fiscal 
year has seen more than 1.1 million il-
legal crossings. 
Additionally, Customs and Border 
Protection have seized more fentanyl 
so far this year than in all of 2020, and 
high 
positivity 
rates 
of 
COVID–19 
among illegal migrants threaten to 
undue much of the hard work our coun-
try has done in combating the pan-
demic. 
The Biden border crisis is turning 
deadlier by the day. 
This crisis is a direct result of the 
policies coming from the Biden-Harris 
administration. 
When Vice President HARRIS finally 
visited the border last month, she 
claimed the administration has made 
progress, but the numbers don’t lie, 
and with roughly 3,000 migrants cross-
ing each day, little progress has been 
made. 
I believe securing our borders is the 
first step in a broader discussion of 
much-needed comprehensive immigra-
tion reform. 
Ensuring the safety of American citi-
zens will allow us to address that and 
is the best chance for a prosperous fu-
ture.

INVESTING 
IN 
JOBS, 
OPPOR-
TUNITY, WORKING FAMILIES 
(Ms. JACOBS of California asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. 
JACOBS 
of 
California. 
Mr. 
Speaker, this past year exposed deep 
inequities in our society, but it did not 
create them. 
In San Diego County, 60 percent of 
families couldn’t access the childcare 
they needed before the pandemic. We 
know it has only gotten worse. 
It isn’t enough to just get back to 
normal. For too many families, ‘‘nor-
mal’’ wasn’t working. 
That is why I am so proud that, this 
week, we will pass appropriations legis-
lation that increases funding for edu-
cation, 
healthcare, 
childcare, 
and 
more. I am proud that the package in-
cludes $3 million in local project fund-
ing for my district, including funding 
to boost early learning and multimedia 
education in Linda Vista and City 
Heights and to make Balboa Park more 
accessible. 
I am also grateful that the package 
includes my request for $1 million for 
San Diego County’s Child Care Expan-
sion Fund to help providers increase 
available spots for care. 
There is so much work to be done to 
build the future we deserve, and I am 
grateful to be here doing it on behalf of 
the community that I love.

WATER FOR OUR FARMLANDS 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, recent 
aggressive moves by California water 
and 
environmental 
regulators 
now 
threaten very long-held water rights, 
pre-1914, the gold standard in my home 
State. Why? The mismanagement of 
water during a short rainfall year has 
led to hundreds of thousands of acres of 
farmland being cut off from water due 
to Federal and State regulators that 
prioritize fish over people’s needs. 
A California State agency is now 
ready to cut off water to crops in just 
6 days, midsummer, mid-crop year. 
Imagine, over halfway through the 
year, and they just cut it off. This is in 
favor of failed environmental policy 
that allows the water to flow out to the 
sea and doing so ostensibly to help a 
fish population that it really is not 
helping. 
Our infrastructure that we are con-
templating needs to include water stor-
age projects. For the American con-
sumer, don’t count on these fruit and 
vegetable products coming from some-
where else in the world, except at a 
much higher price. They will not get to 
your table with the same high quality 
you expect. 
We need water storage. We need to be 
included in any infrastructure bill. 
Otherwise, we all suffer as Americans. 
This is everybody’s problem. 
f 
RISING COVID CASES 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, 
COVID cases in America are rising. 
They are rising in almost 25 States. 
Texas happens to be one of the States 
with the largest number of COVID 
cases. 
The United States has over 31 million 
cases and, of course, over 600,000 who 
have died. 
Hospitals today in certain areas are 
full, and the plague or the impact, 
tragically, 
on 
those 
who 
are 
unvaccinated. But the story goes on. 
As we begin to enter school, children 
under 12 cannot be vaccinated, even 
though research is going on. 
Here is my plea: To those in the 18th 
Congressional District, in Houston, 
Texas, in Harris County, in Texas, and 
in the Nation, the unvaccinated should 
get vaccinated. The surge is creating a 
rise in the pandemic again. 
If we are to get back to normal, find 
someone that you agree with that com-
forts you—your faith leader, your best 
friend—and talk about the importance 
of getting vaccinated. 
People are dying. Children will be-
come infected and/or carriers when 
they go back to school. Everyone in 
school should be vaccinated. Yes, in 
the schools today, going back, you 
must be masked. You should wear a 
mask, and wear a mask inside, even if 
you are vaccinated. We are trying to 
save lives. 
Get vaccinated. It will save lives.

Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, yes, 
it is one of those last names. I have 
family members that have trouble pro-
nouncing it. 
PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY 
Mr.

July 28, 2021 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, my 
question is, just because the Democrat 
leadership 
here 
changed 
the 
rules 
sometime last night, do I have to wear 
this thing while standing here alone 
during my 1-hour Special Order? May I 
take it off when I am at the mike? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy, the 
gentleman may remove his mask while 
under recognition. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the clarification. I know we 
are all trying to get our heads around 
it because things keep changing around 
here. 
Mr. Speaker, the gentlewoman from 
Oklahoma had a couple of things she 
wanted to share tonight. This is the 
first time she and I have had a chance 
to talk. She is really smart and incred-
ibly charming. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from Oklahoma (Mrs. BICE). 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank my colleague from Arizona. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address 
the ongoing crisis happening at our 
southern border. Since President Biden 
took office, he has stopped building the 
wall, brought back catch and release, 
and ended the remain in Mexico policy. 
As a result, this administration has 
created the worst humanitarian, na-
tional security, and public health crisis 
ever seen at our Nation’s southern bor-
der. 
In the past 3 months, each month, we 
have seen more than 170,000 border en-
counters, a new 21-year high, totaling 
over half a million illegal border cross-
ings. These numbers are resulting in 
overcrowded 
shelters, 
human 
traf-
ficking, drug smuggling, and violence. 
In addition, the surge of unaccom-
panied children coming across the bor-
der shows no signs of slowing down. 
In June, the number of children ar-
riving daily rose to 530. A journey like 
this is not only unsafe; it could lead to 
sexual exploitation or forced labor. 
Despite the continuing increase of 
border encounters each month, House 
Democrats want to defund Customs 
and Border Protection and Immigra-
tion and Customs Enforcement by 
nearly $1 billion. Our CBP, ICE, and 
DHS officers have been putting their 
lives at risk protecting Americans. 
Calling to defund them during the 
worst immigration crisis in U.S. mod-
ern history is deeply troubling. 
Mr. Speaker, the open border rhet-
oric from the Biden administration has 
encouraged hundreds of thousands of 
people to make the dangerous trek to 
the U.S. We must secure the border. We 
must protect our border cities. We 
must support the men and women who 
honorably protect our border. We must 
end this heartbreaking crisis. 
In addition to the immigration crisis 
that we are seeing on the southern bor-
der, we are now dealing with a COVID 
crisis that is not being addressed. The 
number of individuals crossing into 
this country with COVID has increased 
exponentially. 
These individuals are not being test-
ed. They are not being offered vaccina-
tions. They are being put on buses and 
shipped across this country. 
With the number of cases on the in-
crease, it is imperative that this ad-
ministration addresses the border cri-
sis issue immediately. 
Mr. Speaker, I again thank my col-
league from Arizona. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, to 
the gentlewoman from Oklahoma, I 
only got this in an alert just about 2 
hours ago, and I will send her a copy of 
it. 
Apparently, we now have a whistle-
blower, a formal whistleblower com-
plaint. They were there to help take 
care of these children, and they were 
instructed not to disclose how many of 
these people in the housing unit had 
COVID. 
If that is true, once again, we are 
back to the duplicity of what has been 
going on at the border. 
As we talk about just what this is 
doing, the impact to the country—and 
I am going to talk a little bit about 
what it does to the working poor—that 
might be a really interesting thing, be-
cause you touched on it, this whistle-
blower complaint that may expose that 
they are being told not to disclose the 
level of COVID that is in this popu-
lation crossing the border illegally. 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. I had not 
heard that, so that is incredibly inter-
esting information. 
I think that with the mandates that 
are being put in place by the adminis-
tration, asking for vaccinations of Fed-
eral employees, vaccinations of our 
military, how about we test and vac-
cinate people who are illegally coming 
into this country if we are going to 
ship them all over the U.S.? 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. It is a great 
irony, isn’t it? 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. It is an in-
credible irony. 
I will say I appreciate this whistle-
blower coming forward and providing 
that information to us because you are 
right, we are not being given accurate 
or timely information about what is 
happening on the border currently. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. What do you 
think the likelihood is that the Demo-
crat majority here, in their constitu-
tional oversight responsibility, will 
take that whistleblower complaint se-
riously and look into the fact that, if it 
is true, we have been lied to? 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. I guess it re-
mains to be seen. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman and wish her a 
great evening. 
Mr. Speaker, we are going to do a 
couple of things this evening, and I am 
going to try to tie it together. Hope-
fully, some of this makes sense. I am 
going to start off with just a one-off. 
Last week, I had a gentleman knock 
on my front door of my home. For all 
of us who are elected in this sort of 
time where things are a little anxious, 
you always stand up a bit when some-
one you don’t know is at your front 
door. 
Turns out, it is a really smart gen-
tleman. He has a Ph.D. in amphibians 
and lives down the street from me. He 
had something he wanted to share, and 
this was something I didn’t expect. It 
was a complete one-off. 
He told me the story of what had 
happened just a couple of weeks ear-
lier. He had this beloved dog. I am 
going to screw up the breed. I think it 
was some type of malamute, just this 
big, beautiful, fuzzy white dog. Appar-
ently, the canine had gotten his wife’s 
purse and chewed up some gum. 
I know this seems like a weird thing 
to do on the floor of the House, but it 
killed the dog. I think the more tech-
nical term is a sugar alcohol that is 
used. It is pronounced xylitol, which 
we see in certain gum products and 
candy products. It is an artificial 
sweetener. Apparently, it kills our ca-
nines. 
We have drafted a letter to the FDA 
and the appropriate agencies, asking if 
there is knowledge of this. If there is 
also knowledge of this, should there at 
least be some warning put on these 
packages? Because I had never heard of 
this. 
Then, when I went to the internet 
and looked, there was story after story 
after story after story of just heart-
break about people with their puppies 
getting some gum, getting one of these 
artificially 
sweetened 
candies, 
and 
dying. I guess it shuts down the liver 
incredibly aggressively. 
As almost a public service announce-
ment, but also I am hoping that my 
colleagues on the left and right—if the 
FDA, if the bureaucracy doesn’t really 
respond to us—would be willing to do a 
piece of legislation creating a directive 
that there needs to be some sort of 
warning on these products that if your 
puppy gets loose with this, it may lose 
its life. 
That is a little different than talking 
about economics, but the gentleman 
was just heartbroken because this dog 
was truly one of his best friends, a real-
ly important family member. To go 
from being out there playing to, sev-
eral hours later, having him pass away, 
I think all of us would understand the 
impact of that. 
I had not heard about this. I think if 
we have gum with that sweetener sit-
ting around our house—and I have a 
puppy coonhound that will munch on 
anything. We quickly got that in the 
shelves, away from the dog. 
For all of us, it is something that we 
are thinking. Hopefully, the FDA and 
others will do the right thing. 
Mr. Speaker, let’s talk about what is 
going on in our Nation. We are going to 
touch a little bit—and it is going to be 
a little sarcastic and a little cranky. I 
am sorry about that, but I don’t know 
another way to try to tell the story of 
just the absurdity of what is going on 
in some of our tax policy and economic 
policy. 
Mr. Speaker, the theme I really want 
to try to weave through today is not

being understood, I don’t think, by ei-
ther Republicans or Democrats, lib-
erals or conservatives. 
So much of the public policy that is 
being pushed right now is just crushing 
to the working poor. We are going to 
do some really crappy things to the 
working poor, and it is not necessary. 
There is rational economic policy. 
You don’t cater to certain of your ac-
tivist constituencies as much, but it is 
much more effective to helping those 
we say we care about here in our soci-
ety. 
b 2045 
I do this slide as often as I can. What 
is the greatest threat in this country 
right now to my 5-year-old daughter, 
to your retirement? 
The fact of the matter is our demo-
graphics. This slide is before all the 
crazy spending proposals that have 
been produced so far this year. This is 
where we are structurally. 
And the fact of the matter is, as a so-
ciety, we are getting old really fast. So 
think of this in 30 years in today’s dol-
lars. So I will adjust for inflation. In 
today’s dollars, we will be $101 trillion 
in publicly borrowed money. Only 
about $3 trillion of that is what you 
would think of as general spending. All 
the rest of it is purely Social Security 
and Medicare. 
Medicare is about $71 trillion of bor-
rowed money. The spend is much, 
much, much, much larger than that, 
but that is how much we are going to 
have to borrow to finance the shortfall. 
Because, once again, for those who 
don’t pay attention to this, Medicare is 
a promise. We have made that promise 
to American workers and American re-
tirees. But only part A, which is the 
hospital portion, is actually the trust 
fund. And the trust fund is gone in 3 to 
5 years, we wiped out that money. 
The rest of Medicare spending, when 
you see the doctor, when you get a 
pharmaceutical, 
those 
things 
come 
right out of the general fund. There is 
no trust fund for that spend. 
If we don’t get serious about sort of 
the holistic theory of how you save 
this country, and it turns out really 
aggressive economic growth, you have 
got to embrace technologies and new 
methods 
to 
crash 
the 
price 
of 
healthcare, these sorts of things. If we 
don’t have that type of vision, these 
numbers become what drives all policy. 
If you care about the environment, if 
you care about education, if you care 
about this, there will be no money be-
cause we will spend every dime we have 
just financing the retirement promise 
that we have made as a government, as 
a society to each other. But yet this 
isn’t particularly sexy. It is really 
scary. It is really hard. It requires a 
calculator. And God knows, we all 
work in a place that doesn’t own cal-
culators. 
So let’s walk through a little bit of 
the reality that part of the solution to 
what we are doing to the working poor, 
part of the solution to what we are 
doing to these massive, massive un-
funded promises is economic growth. 
And one of my intense frustrations is 
the amount this place is willing to, 
what do you call it, oh, yeah, lie, about 
basic revenues. We call them receipts 
in Ways and Means, tax revenues, and 
these things. Remember, post tax re-
form a number of my brothers and sis-
ters on the left got up behind these 
microphones and told stories: We are 
going to go into massive recession, the 
revenues are going to collapse, this is 
going to happen. 
Well, what ended up happening? 
Remember 2018—because remember 
we passed tax reform at the end of 
2017—2018 and 2019 were the second and 
third highest, adjusted for inflation, so 
we are talking real math, receipts, tax 
collections in U.S. history. But what 
was more phenomenal about it is it 
created such an economic lift. So many 
of our brothers and sisters were work-
ing, particularly from the working 
poor. We saw things—and we are going 
to look at a couple of those boards— 
where the working poor became dra-
matically less poor. And because they 
are working, the trust funds we were 
just touching on, what we showed for 
Social Security and Medicare, their 
longevity 
revenues, 
because 
people 
were working, their lives got longer. 
This was actually, I thought, the Holy 
Grail for both those on the left and the 
right, we were going to try to find a 
way to mathematically make the num-
bers work so we can keep our promises. 
Well, it turns out, post tax reform, 
the receipts were incredibly robust, 
and they were the second and third 
highest in U.S. history. And the only 
reason they weren’t number one, by a 
sliver, was in 2015 we had some really 
unusual, what they call, timing effects, 
when certain things happened just be-
fore the end of the fiscal year that were 
posted in a certain fiscal year. So I 
won’t geek out too much on that. 
But often you will hear Members of 
the majority party here get behind the 
microphone, and say, well, the tax 
scam. It is really actually a pretty 
dark thing to say, because those couple 
of years before the pandemic were 
some of the most robust—actually, the 
most robust years in modern economic 
times for the poor in this country. The 
working poor became dramatically less 
poor. 
But there are those that will stand 
behind the microphone and call it a tax 
scam. And the willingness to keep 
lying—and I am sorry, I know that is a 
crappy word to use, but I am so frus-
trated because they can’t seem to stop. 
A couple of Members, just this last 
week, once again, got behind these 
microphones, and said: Well, 83 percent 
goes to the top 1 percent. That is a lie. 
As a matter of fact, even the Wash-
ington Post—which is not really par-
ticularly friendly to those of us on the 
free market economic side—has gotten 
so frustrated with Democrats getting 
behind microphones and lying. They 
are even now saying, the zombie claim 
that 2017 tax cuts gave 83 percent to 
the top 1 percent. Even the leftist 
newspapers are just bewildered with 
the left not telling the truth. I don’t 
mind having policy arguments, but 
don’t make crap up, over and over and 
over. 
We see now even the left-wing media 
is having to correct the Democrats, 
saying, no, it turns out post tax reform 
that 2018 and 2019 were sort of miracle 
years; incredible wage growth, incred-
ible 
productivity 
growth, 
savings 
growth, and particularly for the popu-
lations that we claim we care about. 
Remember, they were the first 2 
years in modern economic history 
where income inequality really shrank, 
and I thought that was the Holy Grail, 
that the wealthy got wealthier, but the 
poor got much less poor much faster, 
actually closing the income differen-
tial gaps and the wealth gaps. I always 
thought that that was the Holy Grail 
around here. 
And when it happened—but it didn’t 
happen with social engineering, it 
didn’t happen with big spending pro-
grams that you get to basically extort 
votes with. It happened by opening up 
the economy and creating investment 
in productivity that made it so you 
could pay people more. It gets vilified 
with misinformation. It is just real 
hard to make honest government pub-
lic policy when one side won’t actually 
own a calculator. 
So to beat this a little bit more, you 
take a look at what happened to, par-
ticularly, working, unmarried women. 
The wage growth was remarkable. Just 
remarkable. I think it was in 2019, we 
had African-American females, I think, 
who were having like a 7–8 percent 
growth in wages in a single year in a 
time with almost no inflation. Some of 
these numbers were remarkable. 
And if the goal here is to make the 
poor less poor, I actually believe those 
who were on the free market side have 
demonstrated there is a path where it 
works, and it is sustainable. And we 
are going to come back to that theme, 
because this year we will probably see 
income and equality shrink, but it is 
going to shrink in a way—because we 
have pumped so much cash out the 
door—it is not sustainable. As soon as 
that money goes away, we go back to 
the bad old days and the really crappy 
policies of the previous decade. 
So let’s actually walk through some-
thing that we started to touch on when 
we opened this up. The violence—and I 
am going to use the term, economic vi-
olence—that we are committing to the 
working poor in this country seems to 
get no press. I mean, if you read some 
of the really geeky economic journals, 
they are shaking their heads trying to 
get their heads around why the left is 
doing what they are doing. 
But if I came to you tomorrow and 
said, tell me the number one policy sin 
that is going on right now that crushes 
the working poor. The classic defini-
tion of the working poor is they may 
not have finished high school. That is

their labor is their value, it is what 
they sell. 
It turns out, when you open up the 
borders—we have some amazingly de-
tailed studies, and these are studies 
from years ago, back when Democrats 
actually believed in locking down the 
borders to protect working men and 
women. Remember these days, it was 
only like a decade and a half ago, 
where Republicans were accused of 
being owned by the Chamber of Com-
merce and wanting cheap labor, and 
Democrats were going to protect work-
ing men and women? Until all of a sud-
den it seems to reverse. 
And I just desperately wish this place 
actually used basic economic theory to 
create policies instead of sort of having 
a meeting and saying, okay, this year 
you guys take that side, we will take 
this side. It is just absurd what is going 
on. 
We have a number of studies that 
talk about when you flood the market 
with folks with similar skill sets. So 
you basically—if you are part of the 
working poor, what do you sell? You 
sell your labor. And this is the right 
board, sorry. 
When you open up the border, we are 
actually looking at a reduction in 
wages by 6.2 percent. But why this is so 
harsh is some of the papers say it is 
going to last for a decade. What is 
going on at the U.S. border right now 
is, you are kicking the heads in of the 
working poor in this country for the 
next decade. 
I know that doesn’t fit the talking 
heads’ language that you see on cable 
television or the rhetoric around here, 
but you can’t sort of give speeches and 
say you care and then engage in poli-
cies that crush the value of their labor 
because 
you 
make 
them 
compete 
against potentially millions of those 
with similar skill sets. 
And you start to take a look at what 
we did this last year, where there was 
peak unemployment for those skill 
sets. Now, if you happen to be a com-
puter programmer this last crappy 
year, actually you did just fine. If you 
are someone who your skill set was you 
could work from home, you survived. 
If you happened to be part of the pop-
ulation that you had not finished high 
school, you were in the 21-plus-percent 
unemployment area. It turns out the 
very 
populations 
that 
were 
most 
crushed by the pandemic are the very 
ones we are turning around and kick-
ing their heads in again by opening up 
the border. 
Is it compassionate? Is it truly lov-
ing? 
When I hear speeches from my 
friends on the left saying, well, we are 
opening up the borders to be compas-
sionate. How about the millions and 
millions and millions of our brothers 
and sisters here who may not have had 
the opportunities that those in this 
body have had? And we are going to 
make them compete with similar skill 
sets and millions of new arrivals. 
And it turns out, if you actually look 
at the math, it is African Americans, 
particularly in urban areas, that you 
have just—that this body has just—by 
this President’s policies, have crushed 
their future earning power, have made 
the value of their labor much less and 
it is not short term. 
If you read the studies, we have a 
whole decade now of loss from where 
we were in 2018 and 2019, we have just 
wiped out that progress and the pre-
vious several years of progress. You 
would think this place would actually 
care about things like that. 
No. Because what is going to happen 
is the left’s economic policies aren’t, 
hey, we need revenues for this spend-
ing, and being extra creative with 
where those revenues come from. 
Remember, I have come to this floor 
multiple times and said, if we need a 
trillion dollars for infrastructure, I can 
show you where you can cut a trillion 
dollars in spending, stop subsidizing 
the rich. 
b 2100 
Stop subsidizing the very top 1 per-
cent. Stop subsidizing their flood insur-
ance on their third home on the beach. 
Stop buying them subsidies for their 
Teslas, for their electric car, and for 
their solar panels. 
If you take a look, Mr. Speaker, this 
is one of the great perversities we have 
here in policy, is the left wants to raise 
taxes on the rich and then on the other 
hand, hand it back to them in subsidies 
for other things they buy. I assume 
this is purely political. 
This is, hey, I am giving you some-
thing, vote for me. Then you are able 
to tell your base, hey, look here, I went 
out and taxed the rich. 
But from an economic standpoint, 
this is an absurd thing to do. This is 
economically distorting, and this is al-
most a type of political exploitation. 
Why don’t you just go straight, Mr. 
Speaker? 
Don’t do the economic extortions. 
Stop subsidizing, and stop sending the 
money out the door. 
What is fascinating is I have done 
that speech now three times on the 
floor. I have sat down with a couple of 
my Ways and Means Democrat friends, 
walked them through the binder on all 
the things we do to subsidize the 
wealthy, and they just look at me, 
shrug, and say, Well, I don’t know how 
we would sell that. 
It is crazy. But it shows you, Mr. 
Speaker, the perversity of policy here. 
So this becomes the policy being of-
fered by the left: Let’s raise corporate 
taxes. 
Okay. Well, besides the international 
tax that we seem to be signing onto 
that is going to make the United 
States one of the most uncompetitive 
nations in the world, we are also about 
to do something where raising the cor-
porate tax in the first 24 months we 
lose 1 million jobs. 
So, Mr. Speaker, do you remember 
how we were talking about we need 
that robust economy and we need the 
robust labor market, but Democrats 
get their tax policies, just the cor-
porate tax will unemploy in the first 24 
months 1 million Americans. 
So we start to take a look at—and 
this is a little complex to try to show 
on a board, we are going to have to 
spend more time on it to try to ex-
plain. But this is a whole bunch of the 
revenue side that the Democrats are 
proposing, and this is the spending. 
The problem is much of the revenue 
here is a fraud. It is not real. So, Mr. 
Speaker, you start looking at the tax 
compliance. We can give you some pro-
posals, and we have been trying for 
years, saying use data. You can cover 
much that of that tax gap by using 
data, not hiring 80,000—think of that, 
80,000, that is twice as many as the en-
tire Coast Guard—80,000 new unionized 
IRS employees to go out and chase peo-
ple for the taxes when it turns out we 
have these supercomputers in your 
pocket, and there is data out there 
that would let you match instantly 
saying: Is this person telling us the 
truth? 
It would be dramatically less intru-
sive, because for this to work, the 
Democrats actually have a proposal 
where you are going to turn every bank 
account into an IRS employee. Mr. 
Speaker, you do understand, if you 
look at the Democrats’ revenue pro-
posal, my transactions, my bank bal-
ances, my ins and outs, go to the IRS. 
This march towards totalitarianism 
is on every one of these aspects. So it 
is not enough to just make up fake 
numbers of what the revenues are 
going to be. It is inherently intrusive, 
and it won’t work. You will get lots of 
data, Mr. Speaker, that you can func-
tionally use against the American peo-
ple, but it is not the data that is actu-
ally going to get you the revenues, be-
cause for these who are really rich, to-
morrow they will just move their 
money or their currency, they will do a 
crypto, they will do that type of token 
type of transaction, and it will be the 
rest of the American public that just 
gets crushed by this intrusion. 
So let’s actually sort of dig a little 
bit more into this so it is understood. 
Lots and lots of the experts out there, 
many are just the columnists. If you 
take a look, Mr. Speaker, some of them 
who are actually on the left are mak-
ing it very clear that the Democrats’ 
revenue proposals are a fraud. They are 
making things up. 
These are just some snippets of many 
of the articles that are out there, and 
they are calling it bipartisan. But 
there was a promise. 
Do you remember? The big promise 
from the President and Speaker PELOSI 
is: We are going to pay for these 
things. 
No, they are not. Let me show you, 
Mr. Speaker, how devious this stuff is. 
So President Trump a couple years 
ago—and many of us weren’t thrilled 
with the model—proposed a rebate 
back to the consumers.

So you buy a pharmaceutical, the 
purchasing managers in the back-
ground who buy it from the manufac-
turer and get it to your pharmacy get 
a rebate. They take that rebate and use 
part of it to buy down the price of the 
drug. Then it is sold at the retail 
counter, and you get a lower price. 
President Trump’s proposal was to 
take that and not buy down the price 
of the drug; therefore, it would actu-
ally raise the drug cost a little bit to 
Government, but the consumer would 
get that rebate at the retail counter. 
This is the simplest way to describe it. 
It is a little complex. 
This is the way it works over here. 
The Democrats said: Oh, no. We hate 
this. 
I have a whole list of quotes from 
Speaker PELOSI and the Biden team 
saying that this will never become pol-
icy and this will never become law. 
Well, if it was never going to become 
law, how can the Democrats turn 
around and tell us that they are going 
to use the money from that program as 
one of their pay-fors? 
It was like $180 billion. This is not 
law, and it is not policy. It was a pro-
posal. But somehow if you look at the 
list of the pay-fors from the left, Mr. 
Speaker, they put $180 billion and say: 
Hey, we will just take this fake, mag-
ical money and use that to buy our 
friends. 
Is this the new and improved way? 
Mr. Speaker, you wonder why the 
American people when they start to 
understand the scam that are so many 
of these spending tax proposals why 
they are becoming so cynical. 
I put up this board, because I want to 
call it the cliff that it is. Here is one of 
the other great scams that is in the 
Democrats spending proposals, how 
they get the scores to work. 
Mr. Speaker, may I ask for my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Arizona has 29 minutes re-
maining. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. I am sorry if I 
sound a little cranky, but I have had a 
lot of coffee. As you know, Mr. Speak-
er, at a certain point when you start to 
stack this stuff up it just breaks your 
heart, because we are better than the 
games we are playing right now. Please 
trust me, if Republicans were doing 
this, I would be, and I have been, when 
we have tried doing these sorts of 
things I have been every bit as aggres-
sive. 
So here is the scam so the public un-
derstands this: There are things like 
PAYGO where, hey, if a program goes 
more than 5 years, it has to be paid for. 
So, Mr. Speaker, what if you create a 
multi-multi-multibillion 
dollar 
pro-
gram, and then on the fifth year you 
just pretend it comes to an end? 
Hey, we are just going to drop it. It 
doesn’t really exist. Wink, wink, nod, 
nod. 
We know a future Congress will have 
to extend it, because it have will have 
a constituency, but that way when it is 
scored, it scores within—and we don’t 
have to pretend that we just created 
another program that has no funding 
and, therefore, continues to explode 
that debt. 
This is actually what the Democrats 
are doing, and much of the spending is 
the creating games. 
So earlier this year we created things 
like the childcare tax credit extension. 
Republicans really want to work on 
this, because particularly if we can tar-
get it to help the working poor there is 
a much more uncomfortable conversa-
tion, but we need to have it because, as 
you know, Mr. Speaker, the United 
States has a collapsing fertility rate. 
We actually now functionally don’t 
have enough children to cover our 
debts. Oddly enough, that has a huge 
impact on future economic robustness. 
How do we make it so you can afford 
to have a family? 
So the left has actually created a 
thing here where it costs functionally 
$100 billion this year. In the proposal, 
it would cost $1.3 trillion to do this the 
way 
the 
Democrats 
are 
spending 
money over the 10 years. 
So how do they make that score 
work? 
How do they not have to say: Well, 
just the childcare credit is $1.3 trillion 
of spending over 10 years. They just 
pretend it stops. They get a few years 
out, and then they just drop it. 
You are really going to take the pop-
ulace of the United States, start send-
ing them a check every month, and 
then pretend it is going to stop? 
That is the example. There are 
bunches of these examples. As a matter 
of fact, they did it with SCHIP years 
ago where on the sixth year the pro-
gram was just supposed to disappear, 
and that is how they were so giddy 
they could get it to work with PAYGO. 
b 2110 
You wonder why the public realizes 
this place is almost operating like 
scam artists. If we allowed someone 
outside this building to do things like 
that, we would put them in jail. 
Mr. Speaker, there are a couple of 
other things here. There are ways to 
find revenues to cover the infrastruc-
ture spending. I believe those of us on 
the more conservative side, we can 
show you places to cut spending and, 
therefore, not create the distortions. 
You all saw the report, though I am 
sure my brothers and sisters on the left 
will avoid ever saying it out loud, that 
the actual capital gains tax hike on its 
own loses $33 billion in the 10 years, 
that it is not until you start to play 
games with something called bases. 
Well, Mr. Speaker, have you ever 
thought about what a capital gains tax 
actually is? Okay. We are going to tax 
you for the gain you have in your 
value, the profit you made. What hap-
pens when the house you have, the 
piece of real estate, the other things 
you own—it is not appreciation. It is 
called inflation. 
You do realize that is one of the 
great scams going on at this moment. 
As your house goes up in value, as 
other things go up in value, and we are 
going to get this much larger capital 
gains tax, then we are going to remove 
a bunch of what they call the bases. We 
are going to cap what you can subject 
to the lower tax rate. 
You do realize that we are going to 
tax Americans on the higher price from 
inflation, not the actual purchasing 
power of it getting more valuable. 
Let’s do an example of your home. 
Now, you are a single person. You own 
a home, and it goes up by half a million 
dollars. You have just done incredibly 
well. That first $250,000 of gain—it is 
called once in a lifetime though you 
get to use it, I think, every 5 years—is 
exempt. But that other $250,000, you 
will have to pay capital gains tax on. 
How much of that gain is apprecia-
tion? You bought a house in the right 
neighborhood. You exploded in value. 
But the next house you are going to 
buy, didn’t it also go up similar in 
value, similar in cost? Was it inflation? 
You will pay tax and now extraor-
dinarily high tax rates, if the Demo-
crats get their proposal, on that gain. 
It is a certain level of cruelty. 
The last thing I want to touch on is, 
if our body here really wants to have 
an honest discussion about infrastruc-
ture and its true needs in our society— 
I have not seen the details of the so- 
called bipartisan agreement in the Sen-
ate, but the devil is always in the de-
tails. 
I have a couple of examples here. If 
we are really going to do this, we need 
to sort of figure out if the Democrats 
really want infrastructure, particu-
larly even green infrastructure. Do we 
really want it, or do we just want to 
put up a whole lot of cash that, ulti-
mately, basically goes to environ-
mental groups and that, ultimately, 
just goes to lawyers? 
Let me give you an example. For us 
out in the Southwest, there is this area 
of New Mexico—I guess the way it is 
phrased is that they have this tremen-
dous wind asset. It is one of the great-
est wind production areas in all of 
North America. 
Fifteen years ago, California said, 
hey, we really want some of that clean 
energy from that wind area in New 
Mexico. We will help invest in it. We 
will buy a forward on it. We will con-
tract to buy this. We are at 15 years 
now, and the power line still isn’t per-
mitted because of all the environ-
mental reviews, all the different juris-
dictions. 
If 
you 
are 
really 
trying 
to 
decarbonize the power grid, are the 
Democrats willing to stop funding the 
lawyers and the environmental groups 
that make their living off the litiga-
tion and NEPA study after NEPA 
study? Those are environmental stud-
ies. 
We have a case here. It is referred to 
as SunZia power line. You can go on-
line and look it up. It started in 2006, 
and some of the documents out there 
say they will finally get their permits 
in 2023 or 2025.

This isn’t unique. There are lots of 
occasions like this where an area where 
you want to build wind, solar, even 
some geothermal, you can’t get it per-
mitted. 
Don’t you see the absurdity? We are 
going to put up all this money for in-
frastructure, particularly even from 
the Democrats, the green infrastruc-
ture, but we are not going to change 
the laws because the left is the bene-
ficiaries of so much money from the 
environmental left and the trial law-
yers and the lawyers that sue on this 
stuff. 
We need to put a clock on this. Look, 
I know this hits a little close to home 
for some of our East Coast folks. But 
when it becomes an upheaval over 
doing ocean-based windmills off part of 
the East Coast here—and a lot of the 
very, very wealthy leftists are the very 
ones who cry and complain, saying you 
can’t put this in part of our view, 
which really isn’t part the view if you 
actually looked at the data. 
We have to decide. Things like this 
Vineyard Wind project, which, I guess, 
is—actually, I am embarrassed to say 
that I have the map on my wall. I guess 
it is off the coast of Rhode Island. They 
have been fussing over that for a dec-
ade now. 
Do the Democrats truly want this 
clean energy? For us in the desert 
Southwest, in the afternoons, because 
of 
our 
photovoltaic 
inventory, 
we 
produce too much power. We are now 
having to have really creative discus-
sions of, in the afternoon, when power 
rates crash to almost nothing, should 
we convert it into hydrogen and make 
that storage? 
You all saw the incredible article last 
week in The Wall Street Journal about 
the new iron to rust batteries. They are 
very, very heavy, so they don’t work in 
vehicles but could be incredibly inex-
pensive, efficient storage. This is won-
derful. But that is for those of us who 
live in the desert, where we have lots of 
sunshine and photovoltaic is pretty ef-
ficient. 
But if you want to transmit that 
power someplace, are the Democrats 
going to step up and help someone like 
myself, who is just trying to do a piece 
of legislation that would put this per-
mitting on a clock for it to get capital, 
for you to raise money, for investors to 
participate, for you to plan the power 
grid? 
You can’t have it where the power 
line for that wind farm you wanted 
takes 15 to 20 years to get the power. 
I guess my little passion here is I am 
incredibly skeptical on the pay-fors. 
Even if it passes, unless we are willing 
to change the bureaucratic bottlenecks 
that have been created, you are not 
seeing much of this change in the 
power grid for a couple of decades. 
Do we continue to tell the public the 
fantasy? Or do you step up and say: 
Hey, I am going to do the hard things. 
I am going to change these timelines. I 
am going to have to say no to some of 
my trial lawyer contributors. I am 
going to have to put this on a clock so 
everyone gets a chance to share their 
concerns for it to be properly environ-
mentally reviewed. 
It doesn’t take 20 years to do a line 
siting. If the left is willing to do that, 
then they will get some credibility 
that they really are serious. If they are 
not willing to do that, then you under-
stand much of the talk about the green 
revolution and the energy base is a 
fraud. It is theater. It is pandering be-
cause we will say: Hey, look at all this 
money, but you can’t move the genera-
tion. 
It is real, and we have example after 
example after example. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate you toler-
ating a bit of my tirade tonight. As we 
often joke to whoever is in the chair, I 
used to get put in that chair when I 
made John Boehner mad, so I got to be 
in the chair a lot at night. 
But the things I shared tonight, they 
don’t need to necessarily be partisan. 
They are math. They are process. They 
are the bottlenecks that keep many of 
the things we actually can agree upon 
from happening. 
But this place is so weaponized right 
now that if I say it is black, the other 
side has to say it is white. It has just 
become a dysfunctional body. 
If our goal is to make the working 
poor less poor, if it is to make our soci-
ety much more prosperous, if it is to 
provide optionality in our energy, we 
know it has to be done, but we have to 
be willing, not to necessarily engage in 
the theater side but maybe actually en-
gage in the proof we have of what has 
worked and what hasn’t. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

July 28, 2021

stitution 
By Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois: 
H.R. 4754. 
Congress has the power to enact this legis-
lation pursuant to the following:

By Mr. DOGGETT:

lation pursuant to the following: 
Clause 1 of Section 8 of Article I of the

By Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Penn-
sylvania: 
H.R. 4758. 
Congress has the power to enact this legis-
lation pursuant to the following: 
Article l, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitu-

By Mr. GOMEZ:

Congress has the power to enact this legis-
lation pursuant to the following: 
The Congress enacts this bill pursuant to 
Clause 1 of Section 8 of Article 1 of the 
United States Constitution and Amendment 
XVI of the United States Constitution. 
By Mr. GOSAR: 
H.R. 4760. 
Congress has the power to enact this legis-
lation pursuant to the following: 
Article I. Section 8, clause 4, (the Natu-
ralization Clause) gives Congress sovereign 
control over immigration. In Chirac v. Les-
see of Chirac (1817), the Supreme Court af-
firmed that the Constitution grants Congress 
Plenary power on immigration policy. Fur-
ther, in Galvan v. Press (1954) the court 
found ‘‘that the formulation of policies [per-
taining to the entry of aliens and the right 
to remain here is entrusted to Congress has 
become about as firmly imbedded in the leg-
islative and judicial tissues of our body poli-
tic as any aspect of our government.’’ 
Finally, in Sessions v. Dimaya (2018), when 
discussing the aggravated felony definition 
in section 101(a)(43)(F) of the Immigration 
and Nationality Act (INA), Justice Neil 
Gorsuch issued an opinion stating, ‘‘Congress 
remains free at any time to add more crimes 
to its list. It remains free, as well, to write 
a new residual clause that affords the fair 
notice lacking here. Congress might, for ex-
ample, say that a conviction for any felony 
carrying a prison sentence of a specified 
length opens an alien to removal. Congress 
has done almost exaclty this in other laws 
. . .’’

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, we find rest in the shad-
ow of Your protection. Shield our law-
makers in their work with Your love so 
that they may grow in wisdom. 
Lord, show them how to use today’s 
fleeting minutes for Your glory, be-
coming Your instruments to permit 
Your Kingdom to thrive on Earth. 
Sanctify their thoughts as they re-
member that, because of You, they live 
and move and have their being. 
We praise You this day, O God, for 
You are the alpha and omega, the be-
ginning and the end. 
We pray in Your great Name. Amen.

f 
CAPITOL SECURITY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, yes-
terday, our colleagues Chairman LEAHY 
and 
Ranking 
Member 
SHELBY
an-
nounced a bipartisan agreement on 
emergency funding for several pressing 
security matters. 
The Appropriations Committee set 
out to address three key priorities: 
First, reimbursing the costs incurred 
by the Capitol Police, the National 
Guard, and other law enforcement for 
their assistance during and after the 
January 6 attack on the Capitol; and 
providing for necessary repairs and se-
curity updates to the Capitol Complex. 
Second, addressing a shortfall from 
the efforts to keep Congress a safe and 
functional workplace during the pan-
demic this past year and a half. This is 
everything from PPE to overtime pay 
for staff. 
And, third, some urgent support for 
our Afghan partners who have assisted 
in the fight against terrorism and now 
seek to flee the deteriorating situation 
brought about by the administration’s 
literally disastrous decision to abandon 
that country. 
We owe a real debt to the men and 
women of the Capitol Police, DC Metro 
Police, National Guard, and other 
agencies who helped secure and protect 
our workplace. We are grateful to sup-
port staff, from the Architect of the 
Capitol’s team to the Attending Physi-
cian’s office, to the Sergeant at Arms, 
who have worked day and night keep-
ing us functioning safely throughout 
the pandemic. 
And we intend to keep our Nation’s 
promises to brave Afghans who have 
taken great risks to help Americans 
and our partners fight the terrorists. 
So I applaud the bipartisan work of 
our colleagues. I am sure neither side 
finds the compromise perfect, but I be-
lieve that both sides should and will 
agree it is absolutely necessary. 
f 
VOTING RIGHTS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, now 
on a different matter, the massive, 
massive taxing-and-spending spree that 
Democrats want to ram through this 
summer has problems that go even be-
yond inflation, rising costs, and mas-
sive tax hikes. 
The problem is not just Democrats’ 
jaw-dropping $3.5 trillion pricetag. It is 
also the long list of bad liberal policies 
that this reckless taxing-and-spending 
spree is supposed to purchase. 
I spoke yesterday about just a few of 
those bad ideas. They are talking about 
amnesty for illegal immigrants, social-
ist price-fixing that would leave us 
with fewer new prescription drugs, 
fewer new treatments, and fewer new 
cures. 
They want to permanently change 
the child tax credit into welfare with 
no—no—work requirements; smuggle 
in big chunks of the Green New Deal. 
And in case all of this were not 
enough, some Senate Democrats want 
to use this taxing-and-spending spree 
to grab control over all 50 States’ elec-
tion laws. I thought we just had that 
debate a couple of weeks ago. 
Remember, for several years now, our 
Democratic friends have claimed that 
every successive election proved they 
needed to grab partisan control over 
our democracy. In 2016, 2018, and 2020, 
win or lose—win or lose—when foreign

interference occurred and when it did 
not occur, every possible result has 
been claimed as proof that Washington 
Democrats should rip up our democ-
racy’s rule book and write a new one 
that benefits them. 
The latest phony justification has 
been the false notion that a few States’ 
mainstream voting laws equal some 
kind of assault on democracy as we 
know it. Of course, that is absolutely 
utter nonsense. Americans want it to 
be easy to vote and hard to cheat. 
Voter ID protections are hugely pop-
ular. Basic voter roll maintenance is 
common sense. 
The new law in Georgia, for example, 
provides for more flexible early voting 
and absentee voting than many blue 
States, including New York. But the 
facts weren’t about to stop the Demo-
crats’ big lie. The absurd comparison 
to Jim Crow segregation and all kinds 
of other horrors have continued apace. 
To provide a little more context 
about this fake hysteria, we can also 
look internationally. As one columnist 
recently observed in the Washington 
Post, the balance struck by the State 
of Georgia amounts to ‘‘one of the 
most expansive voting access laws in 
the world. Most other countries do not 
allow no-excuse absentee voting, and 
dropboxes are also virtually unknown 
elsewhere,’’ other democracies around 
the world. ‘‘If Georgia’s elections are 
undemocratic, then almost all of our 
democratic allies are also undemo-
cratic.’’ 
If liberal activists and woke corpora-
tions believed their own rhetoric, they 
wouldn’t 
stop 
at 
boycotting 
and 
threatening the State of Georgia. They 
couldn’t possibly. They would be busy 
trying to divest from most of our 
NATO allies and essentially the rest of 
the entire developed world. 
Some European countries allow mail- 
in voting, but most do not. We con-
stantly hear from our socialist friends 
how we should be emulating Norway, 
Sweden, Finland, and Denmark. Well, 
none of them allow in-country postal 
voting—not a one. Bring on the boy-
cotts, I guess. 
And you don’t even want to hear 
about early voting. Goodness gracious. 
But France, Spain, Germany, Italy, the 
UK, Ireland—not a day of in-person 
early voting in any of those countries, 
none of them. That is according to an 
international NGO that studies democ-
racy. 
So, remember, the Texas and Georgia 
laws codify a whole lot of early voting, 
mail-in voting, and lots of election-day 
voting. 
And this is supposed to be the death 
of democracy? Some outrage on a glob-
al and historic scale? 
Give me a break. What nonsense. 
Even going by Texas’s new proposals, 
there will be voting by mail in Paris, 
TX, but not in Paris, France. There 
would be almost 2 weeks of in-person 
early voting in New Berlin, TX, but 
zero days in Berlin, Germany. I am 
sure Democrats will be yelling at the 
Fortune 500 to boycott Europe any day 
now—any day now. 
Of course, the reality is that these 
moving goalposts are absolutely fake. 
The frantic outrage is phony. It is all 
meant to justify a political power grab 
that Democrats have had written and 
waiting since years before any of these 
new State laws, which are supposedly 
prompting it—yet another awful plank 
that my colleagues across the aisle 
want to hide in the reckless taxing- 
and-spending spree they hope to ram 
through Congress. 
f 
TERRORISM 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, now 
on one final matter, last week, some of 
our colleagues expressed disapproval of 
U.S. strikes against al-Shabaab terror-
ists in Somalia. I find their views dif-
ficult to understand. 
Al-Shabaab poses a significant threat 
to U.S. interests. But you don’t have to 
take my word for it. Late in 2019, the 
leader of al-Shabaab, an al-Qaida-affili-
ated terrorist group based in Somalia, 
said: 
Our biggest target today is the Americans 
. . . The only reason we have exerted all this 
effort and undertaken all this preparation 
today is to attack the American troops. 
In the assessment of the commander 
of U.S. Africa Command, U.S. General 
Stephen Townsend, that is coming 
from ‘‘the largest, wealthiest, and most 
violent Al Qaeda-associated group in 
the world’’ and ‘‘the primary African 
violent extremist organization threat 
to American interests.’’ 
This is not a new threat. Al-Shabaab 
was designated a foreign terrorist orga-
nization back in 2008. Its leaders de-
clared allegiance to al-Qaida in 2012, a 
year 
before 
their 
attack 
on 
the 
Westgate Mall in Kenya that killed 67 
people. The Obama administration des-
ignated the group as an al-Qaida-asso-
ciated force in 2016. That made it sub-
ject to the 2001 AUMF. 
At the time, it was a difficult but 
telling acknowledgement that the al- 
Qaida terrorist threat was growing. 
The raid that killed Bin Laden had 
clearly not ended the threat his terror-
ists posed to our country. 
As a result of its declared and dem-
onstrated allegiance to al-Qaida, al- 
Shabaab is clearly subject to the 2001 
authorization for the use of military 
force, no question. President Obama 
knew it. General Townsend knows it. 
Al-Shabaab themselves tell us they 
want Americans dead. What more, 
what more do the skeptics need? 
If our colleagues do not want the 
U.S. 
military 
to 
conduct 
strikes 
against the al-Qaida terrorists respon-
sible for killing Americans and threat-
ening our interests, I would be inter-
ested to hear how they propose we de-
fend against these threats. 
So, by the way, with the administra-
tion’s rushed withdrawal from Afghani-
stan, there are well-founded concerns 
that al-Qaida may be roaring back in 
that country. 
So which al-Qaida affiliate should we 
stop 
pressuring—al-Shabaab, 
AQAP, 
ISIS? Should we stop hunting for al- 
Zawahiri, the leader of al-Qaida? 
Administrations of both parties have 
identified and supported local partners 
who share an interest in combating 
terrorists. By and large, this approach 
has succeeded in keeping pressure on 
the terrorists while keeping more 
Americans out of harm’s way. 
But despite the best efforts of local 
partners to keep the terrorists at bay 
and the best efforts of U.S. diplomats 
to broker peace, some terrorists do re-
quire direct action by the U.S. military 
to be stopped. These hard-core extrem-
ists pose a serious threat to American 
national security. They seek to attack 
our interests all around the world, in-
cluding our homeland, if we let them. 
The threat they pose will not recede 
if we lose focus. In fact, the exact oppo-
site is the case. So I hope the Com-
mander in Chief will exercise the au-
thorities the Congress has provided 
him and the tools Congress has funded 
to keep America safe against the ter-
rorists who continue to target our 
homeland and our interests abroad. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask

LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-

INFRASTRUCTURE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Now, Mr. President, 
with respect to infrastructure, Sen-
ators continue to make good progress 
on both tracks of legislation. Members 
should be prepared to vote again on 
cloture on the motion to proceed to the 
bipartisan infrastructure bill as early 
as tonight. 
f 
CAPITOL SECURITY 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, on an-
other matter, yesterday, the Senate 
Appropriations 
Chairman, 
Senator 
LEAHY, announced a bipartisan agree-
ment to provide $2.1 billion in emer-
gency supplemental funding to support 
the Capitol Police, reimburse our Na-
tional Guard, and make sure all the 
critical functions of the Capitol Com-
plex are properly funded. 
The toll of January 6 and the impact 
of COVID had meant that funding for 
the Capitol Police, the Capitol Com-
plex, and even for our National Guard 
was running low.

July 28, 2021 
Capitol Police have been forced to 
cancel critical training and health 
services and have had to hold off on 
buying 
new, 
potentially 
lifesaving 
gear, like helmets and body armor and 
respirators. 
Thankfully, the bipartisan agree-
ment between the chair and ranking 
member of the Appropriations Com-
mittee will replenish these critical 
funds and support the hard-working 
men and women who keep this build-
ing, Senators, staff, media, and Capitol 
employees safe. 
I was pleased to hear the Republican 
leader support this supplemental ap-
propriations bill this morning, and I 
look forward to working with our Re-
publican colleagues to swiftly passing 
this legislation through the Senate. 
And I must give accolades to the 
Rules Committee, led by Senators KLO-
BUCHAR and BLUNT. Their hearings and 
focus on this issue—the safety of the 
Capitol—has helped pave the way for 
the agreement, and we thank them for 
their continued diligence. 
f 
NOMINATIONS OF GWYNNE A. 
WILCOX AND DAVID M. PROUTY 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now, 
one final matter, by the end of today, 
the Senate will confirm two nominees 
on the NLRB, the National Labor Rela-
tions Board: Gwynne Wilcox and David 
Prouty. Both are champions for work-
ing Americans. 
Ms. Wilcox, who hails from my home 
State of New York—I am proud to 
say—has spent her career representing 
workers and unions seeking to exercise 
their rights to organize. She is one of 
the Nation’s leading experts on labor 
law, and if confirmed, she would make 
history as the first African-American 
woman to ever serve on the NLRB. 
Like Ms. Wilcox, David Prouty has 
also spent a lifetime defending the 
rights of organized labor across the 
country, recently serving as the gen-
eral counsel of the SEIU, one the Na-
tion’s largest unions. 
Over the course of American history, 
the labor movement has been the sin-
gle most powerful force in lifting 
Americans out of poverty and into the 
middle class. It was by coming to this 
country and joining a union that my 
grandfather entered the middle class 
and passed on even more opportunity 
to his children and then to me and my 
brother and sister. 
So it is no mistake that as labor 
union participation has declined over 
the past few decades, wages have 
stalled as well, and folks are finding it 
harder and harder to stay in the middle 
class. 
If we are going to strengthen the 
backbone of the middle class, we need 
to reinvigorate the labor movement 
and protect the rights of workers ev-
erywhere to organize and bargain col-
lectively for their wages. Appointing 
these two labor champions to the 
NLRB is a great way to start. 
And, to the American people, the 
confirmation today of these two NLRB 
labor champions is a direct result of 
having a Democratic majority in the 
Senate versus having a Republican ma-
jority. 
Under Leader MCCONNELL and Repub-
licans, the NLRB, which is typically di-
vided between two parties, had only 
Republican appointees for the first 
time in its 85-year history. None of 
them had any experience in labor pol-
icy. They are almost atavistically 
against working people and helped 
management—the big bosses—to pre-
vent people from organizing and mak-
ing it harder to stay organized if you 
were. It was awful, and it is one of the 
reasons that middle-class incomes have 
not accelerated in the last 2 decades. 
In fact, the Republicans were so in-
tent on not having the NLRB defend 
the rights of working people that under 
Leader MCCONNELL a Democratic seat 
on the NLRB was held vacant for near-
ly 3 years. If the American people want 
to know which side each party is on, 
just look at the NLRB: Democrats ap-
pointing pro-labor people who fight for 
higher salaries, higher pensions, higher 
health benefits; Republicans making 
sure the NLRB doesn’t function and al-
lowing the big bosses to take a domi-
nant role in negotiations with their 
workers. 
Even during the years when Presi-
dent Trump was in the White House 
and Republicans had a majority on the 
NLRB, 
Leader 
MCCONNELL
blocked 
Democrats from appointing a minority 
member to the Board. They didn’t want 
a minority member on the Board even 
though they would have the majority, 
the Republicans. It is not a stretch to 
say if Democrats had not taken the 
majority in January, these important 
posts to the NLRB might never have 
been filled. 
So, 
look, 
Senate 
Democrats 
are 
working with the Biden Administra-
tion to make sure the National Labor 
Relations Board does what it is in-
tended to do: stand up for working 
Americans; make sure they have a 
much better chance of getting better 
wages, better benefits, better pensions. 
I look forward to confirming these two 
outstanding nominees later today. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll.

INFRASTRUCTURE 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I 
wanted to just literally pop into the 
discussion here this morning. There is 
a great deal going on here in the Cap-
itol. 
The discussions on the bipartisan in-
frastructure bill are continuing in a 
good, productive way, and we are hope-
ful we will be able to move to that 
great deal of work that has gone on by 
folks on both sides working in extraor-
dinary good faith. 
And to be able to proceed on this 
matter, I think, will be an important 
policy initiative but also good for our 
process in this body. 
f 
CONGRATULATING LYDIA JACOBY 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I 
don’t come here this morning to speak 
to that at this moment but to just give 
a strong Alaska ‘‘attagirl’’ shout-out 
to Lydia Jacoby. 
A few days ago, most people outside 
of the State of Alaska had probably 
never heard of Lydia, 17 years old, from 
Seward, AK. Seward is a pretty small 
community in the south central part of 
the State. It is a coastal community. It 
is a fishing community. It is a hard- 
working community. 
Lydia is a typical high school stu-
dent at Seward High School, except she 
is a swimmer, and is she an extraor-
dinary swimmer. To see the news the 
other night of her gold, of her unex-
pected and spectacular win, was a mo-
ment of pride for all Alaskans, a mo-
ment of pride for Americans that just 
makes your heart swell. So I wanted to 
come to the floor and share that. 
I actually was able to start my morn-
ing off early, but in a good way, by 
being able to call Lydia—she is over in 
Japan, obviously—and to speak with 
her directly and offer my congratula-
tions. Mr. President, you can tell when 
people are grinning ear to ear, even 
though you are separated by thousands 
of miles and you are talking over a 
telephone. This morning, Lydia Jacoby 
was grinning ear to ear as I was shar-
ing my words of congratulations and 
she, just her exuberance and delight for 
being able to represent the United 
States at these Olympics in this way. 
We are extraordinarily proud. Lydia 
has put Seward and certainly Seward 
High School on the map. Folks are 
coming up to me saying: Gosh, I didn’t 
realize you didn’t have Olympic-meter 
swimming pools in most of your com-
munities. Well, that is true. Lydia did 
some training that I think most would 
say: It is going to be a long, hard slog 
to get to any Olympics. 
I think the dedication of this young 
woman has certainly played out. The 
support that she has received from her 
parents over the years, the support she 
has received from her community, is an 
example of just good, strong Alaska 
roots: everybody working hard and just 
doing your best on a daily basis. 
Lydia Jacoby has absolutely done her 
best. She set the gold standard, and we 
are just extraordinarily proud of this 
young Alaskan woman.

July 28, 2021 
EXECUTIVE SESSION 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Under the previous order, the 
Senate will proceed to executive ses-
sion and resume consideration of the 
following nomination, which the clerk 
will report. 
The legislative clerk read the nomi-
nation of Gwynne A. Wilcox, of New 
York, to be a Member of the National 
Labor Relations Board for the term of 
five years expiring August 27, 2023. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican whip. 
THE ECONOMY 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, not con-
tent with their $1.9 trillion so-called 
COVID relief bill—paid for entirely 
with money borrowed from younger 
generations of Americans and our chil-
dren and grandchildren—Democrats are 
readying another partisan spending 
spree. 
Democrats are preparing to consider 
a $3.5 trillion tax-and-spending pack-
age, this one at least partially paid for 
by massive tax hikes—tax hikes on 
small businesses, tax hikes on large 
businesses, tax hikes on investment, 
tax hikes on well-off Americans, and 
tax hikes on the middle class. That is 
right, tax hikes on the middle class. 
Now, President Biden is fond of re-
peating that he won’t raise taxes on 
anyone making under $400,000 a year, 
but the new death tax he is proposing 
will definitely hit some middle-class 
Americans. Let’s talk about that new 
tax. 
President Biden and congressional 
Democrats are proposing to eliminate a 
part of the Tax Code known as ‘‘step-up 
in basis’’ or referred to often as 
‘‘stepped-up basis.’’ Under our current 
Tax Code, when you inherit something 
from an estate, whether that is stocks 
or a house, the value of that item is 
stepped up from its original value to 
its current market value when you re-
ceive it. This prevents you from having 
to pay capital gains taxes on the 
amount that your parents’ house in-
creased in value when it was owned by 
your parents. 
Let’s say you inherit a house that 
your parents bought for $100,000, but it 
is now worth $500,000. Under current 
law, when you inherit that house, you 
are not liable for taxes on the increase 
in value from the time your parents 
bought it. The house is transferred to 
you at its current market value of 
$500,000. So if you sell the house right 
when you inherit it, you will receive 
the full value of the house instead of 
having to pay taxes on the amount 
that the house increased in value while 
your parents owned it. If you sell that 
house 2 years later for $650,000, you are 
only required to pay taxes on the 
$150,000 in value it gained while it was 
in your possession. 
Under the Democrats’ proposal, how-
ever, capital gains taxes would auto-
matically be triggered upon death if 
the increase in value of an individual’s 
estate has exceeded a certain amount. 
So, if your parents’ house or the family 
farm or other assets have increased in 
value more than Democrats deem de-
sirable, you would now owe capital 
gains taxes on the amount of that in-
crease immediately after your parents’ 
death minus the amount Democrats 
choose to exempt. 
There are plenty of middle-class 
Americans around this country who 
would be paying this tax. You wouldn’t 
be protected just because you make 
under $400,000 a year. 
Now, the President has tried to get 
around this by arguing that Democrats 
would be taxing dead individuals, not 
living ones. So if your parents die and 
pass on their estate, the argument sug-
gests the tax that you have to send to 
the Federal Government isn’t a tax on 
you but on your parents. Well, who 
does he think he is fooling? Who is 
going to experience the loss of that 
money—you or your parents? Who is 
going to be writing the check to the 
Federal Government? You will. 
Let’s imagine that a woman’s par-
ents die and leave her their estate, and 
2 weeks later, a thief comes in and 
steals part of that inheritance. Who are 
people going to think was robbed—the 
daughter or her deceased parents? I 
think all of us would recognize that it 
was the daughter who was robbed. The 
same thing applies to Democrats’ pro-
posed new death tax. It is not dead 
Americans 
who 
would 
be 
writing 
checks to the Federal Government. 
Sure, the tax is owed by the decedent 
or transferor, but for all practical pur-
poses, the costs would be borne by 
their descendants. 
The truth is, even if we accept the ar-
gument that Democrats’ new death tax 
is a tax on deceased Americans and not 
their descendants, this tax would still 
hit some middle-class Americans. After 
all, it is perfectly possible to work hard 
your whole life and invest wisely and 
see your estate appreciate in value by 
more than $1.25 million—the proposed 
individual exemption level—over the 
course of your life without ever exiting 
the middle class. We are not talking 
about confining this taxation to indi-
viduals with a yearly income of $1.25 
million; we are talking about the in-
crease in value on an estate over a per-
son’s lifetime. There is no question 
that this tax would fall on the estates 
of some thoroughly middle-class Amer-
icans. 
The problems with this new death 
tax aren’t limited to the fact that it 
breaks President Biden’s pledge not to 
raise taxes on individuals making 
under $400,000 a year. There are a lot of 
additional problems, starting with the 
administration and compliance costs of 
this tax. 
Congress actually passed a similar 
proposal in the 1970s but repealed it be-
fore it went into effect because it was 
so complicated and unworkable. That 
is right. Congress repealed the proposal 
before it was even implemented be-
cause it was clear that collecting this 
tax was going to be too complicated. 
Forty-odd years later, collecting this 
tax would still be an enormously com-
plicated matter. It would put incred-
ible new recordkeeping requirements 
on a lot of American families, and it 
would strain the capabilities of the 
IRS, although those 87,000 new IRS em-
ployees President Biden wants to add 
to the Agency would certainly increase 
the available manpower to levy new 
tax hikes. 
Plus, I can only imagine the litiga-
tion that would arise over the valu-
ation of assets. What happens if the 
IRS disagrees with the estimate of the 
value of your family farm or business? 
Do you have to take the IRS to court? 
Will the IRS take you to court? 
In addition, there is a very real dan-
ger that Americans would be paying 
taxes on nonexistent gains, in part due 
to inflation and the natural expansion 
of the economy. Recent economic re-
ports are raising concerns that, with 
the administration’s robust new enti-
tlement spending, Americans could be 
shouldering the burdens of significant 
inflation now and long into the future. 
But Democrats’ new death tax would 
not account for inflation on an asset, 
like a family-owned farm or business, 
which means Americans could be pay-
ing a lot of money in taxes on non-
existent gains. 
Finally, I want to talk about the 
threat this tax poses to family farms 
and businesses. 
Now, Democrats claim that they will 
defer this tax for family farms and 
businesses as long as a member of the 
family inherits and then runs the farm 
or business, but it is completely un-
clear what this will look like in prac-
tice. Will ‘‘family members’’ refer only 
to sons and daughters? What if a step-
son wants to take over the farm, or a 
niece? Will the inheritors still be sub-
ject to the tax then, which could result 
in their having to sell that farm the 
niece wants to run? What happens if 
two or more of the children want to 
run the farm? There are a lot of unan-
swered questions. 
Of course, it is important to remem-
ber that Democrats will only be defer-
ring the tax. So if the time ever comes 
when the family wants to sell the 
farm—maybe it is getting hard to run 
and a neighboring family is willing to 
buy it—the family would have to pay 
those taxes that were deferred when 
their mom or dad died. If that family 
farm has been handed down through a 
few generations already, it is com-
pletely possible that paying those 
taxes would consume a big part of that 
legacy. 
There is a reason 13 House Democrats 
sent a letter to House Democratic lead-
ers expressing their concern about the 
proposed step-up in basis repeal. It is 
because this tax would pose a real 
threat to the continued existence of 
family farms and businesses. It is the 
same reason that those in agriculture 
and small business communities oppose 
this new death tax.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5119 
July 28, 2021 
I was proud to lead all 50 Senate Re-
publicans in a letter last week, urging 
President Biden to drop this misguided 
proposal, and I will continue to do ev-
erything I can to protect family farms 
and businesses from this new tax. 
There should be a limit on how many 
times the Federal Government can tax 
you. Americans’ bank accounts should 
not be regarded as a bottomless barrel 
of money to pay for Democrats’ pre-
ferred government programs, because 
that is exactly what is happening here. 
Democrats want to massively and per-
manently 
expand 
government, 
and 
they are looking to Americans and 
American businesses to pay for their 
social experiments. They apparently 
haven’t spent much time considering 
how our economy or American families 
would suffer as a result of their tax- 
and-spending spree. 
Middle-class Americans should not 
have to see their inheritances shrink to 
pay for Democrats’ spending, and fam-
ily farms and businesses that already 
face challenges from our current death 
tax should not have to be worrying 
that a new death tax will spell the end 
of their hard-earned legacies. 
I hope the Democrats will think 
twice before moving forward with this 
new tax increase on Americans. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to complete my re-
marks before the vote starts. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
NOMINATIONS OF GWYNNE A. WILCOX AND DAVID 
M. PROUTY 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, over 
the past 4 years, the National Labor 
Relations Board, which was founded to 
protect workers’ rights, has again and 
again tipped the scales in favor of very 
large corporations. 
While Democratic nominees to the 
NLRB were blocked and anti-worker 
nominees were jammed through, we 
saw decades of worker protections re-
versed. This has had a devastating im-
pact on workers in our country, who 
are not only struggling through this 
pandemic but who have also seen their 
rights to strike and organize and bar-
gain collectively undermined and con-
strained in ruling after ruling. 
But, today, the Senate has the oppor-
tunity to begin healing this damage by 
confirming two exceptionally qualified 
individuals. That is why I am urging 
all of our colleagues to join me in sup-
porting David Prouty and Gwynne 
Wilcox to serve on the NLRB. 
Mr. Prouty’s career is defined by his 
commitment to workers, with a long 
record representing textile workers, 
hotel 
workers, 
restaurant 
workers, 
baseball players, and now as a lawyer 
for the SEIU Local 32BJ, property serv-
ice workers. 
Ms. Wilcox’s experience as a field at-
torney for the NLRB, as a lawyer rep-
resenting workers before the Board, 
and defending healthcare workers and 
protecting their rights makes clear 
that she has the right qualifications 
and values for this job. 
Ms. Wilcox is not only a high-quali-
fied nominee, she will be a historic one. 
She will be the first Black woman to 
serve on the Board, and her confirma-
tion will bring us a step closer to en-
suring our worker protections Agencies 
represent the diverse workforce they 
serve. 
It is clear to me we need David 
Prouty and Gwynne Wilcox on the 
NLRB to reverse the damage done by 
years of anti-worker attacks and get us 
back on the right track of building 
back an economy that works for every-
one, not just huge corporations and 
those at the top. 
Now more than ever, we need to join 
with workers and defend their rights. 
Today, that means voting to confirm 
Gwynne Wilcox and David Prouty. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
CLOTURE MOTION 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair 
lays before the Senate the pending clo-
ture motion, which the clerk will state. 
The legislative clerk read as follows:

ance with the provisions of rule XXII of the

ORDER OF PROCEDURE 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
stand in recess from 1:10 p.m. until 1:55 
p.m. today. I further ask that all

JANUARY 6 SELECT COMMITTEE 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, yester-
day, Congressman BENNIE
THOMPSON 
called to order the first hearing of the 
special committee that most of our Re-
publican 
colleagues 
have 
tried 
to 
block, the Select Committee to Inves-
tigate the January 6 Attack on the 
U.S. Capitol. 
It continues to amaze me that an 
independent, bipartisan committee to 
investigate the worst assault on our 
democracy since the War of 1812, an as-
sault that left one police officer dead 
and more than 140 injured, was filibus-
tered and stopped in its tracks by the 
Republican leader of the Senate, MITCH 
MCCONNELL. 
That is exactly what he did. He tried 
to conceal the truth about what hap-
pened on January 6. He tried to hide it 
from the American people and to do 
this without police officers in this 
building 
noticing, 
many 
of 
whom 
risked their lives on that day. Well, we 
saw yesterday that he failed. Senator 
MCCONNELL failed to stop the inves-
tigation. We are going to learn what

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5120 
July 28, 2021 
happened on January 6, despite his ef-
fort to stop it. 
During the first hearing of the select 
committee yesterday, we heard testi-
mony from four police officers who bat-
tled the mob for hours on January 6. 
Many of us witnessed it. Two members 
of the Capitol Police Force and two 
from the Metropolitan Police Depart-
ment of Washington, DC, testified. 
These officers were brutalized in hand- 
to-hand combat. Some thought they 
were going to die. And they are still 
grappling with the physical and emo-
tional trauma they suffered. 
Officer Harry Dunn recounted yester-
day how the mob of the former Presi-
dent’s supporters chanted the N-word 
in his face. 
Metropolitan Police Officer Michael 
Fanone testified that members of the 
mob attempted to steal his service 
weapon and kill him with it. He was 
dragged into the mob, tasered repeat-
edly, and beaten unconscious. He suf-
fered a heart attack and a traumatic 
brain injury. This is what Officer 
Fanone said yesterday: ‘‘My fellow citi-
zens, including so many of the people I 
put my life at risk to defend, are 
downplaying or outright denying what 
happened. I feel like I went to hell’’ he 
said, ‘‘and [came] back to protect them 
and the people in this room. But too 
many are now telling me that hell 
doesn’t exist or that hell wasn’t ex-
actly that bad.’’ 
Is that how we are going to treat po-
lice officers in the Capitol? I ask that 
of the Senators and the House Mem-
bers. 
They risk their lives every day to de-
fend us, to defend this building, to de-
fend what it stands for. Instead of 
thanking them, are some of my col-
leagues going to deny the brutality 
that they faced? That cannot be. These 
brave officers deserve better. At the 
very least, they deserve that the truth 
be told. 
One of the most searing images from 
January 6 was that of a police officer 
screaming in agony as he was pinned 
against the metal door and beaten by 
this insurrectionist mob. 
Yesterday, that man, Metropolitan 
Police Officer Daniel Hodges, told the 
select committee: ‘‘There can be no 
moving 
on 
without 
accountability. 
There can be no healing without mak-
ing sure this will never happen again.’’ 
To all of the police officers who held 
the line on January 6, let me say clear-
ly: You defended the American democ-
racy. You didn’t just defend this build-
ing and the Members of Congress. And 
if not for your heroism and sacrifice, 
the terrible toll of that day would have 
been far worse. Take solace in the fact 
that you did your duty. 
But there are Members of the Senate 
and the House who are failing to do 
theirs. Right now, this Senate has a 
chance to finally do right by our police 
officers. 
Yesterday, Chairman LEAHY and Vice 
Chairman SHELBY announced a bipar-
tisan $2.1 billion security supplemental 
funding package that will not only pay 
the salaries of our Capitol Police offi-
cers, it will increase security at the 
Capitol. It will reimburse the National 
Guardsmen who were deployed to de-
fend this building after January 6—a 
great sacrifice. 
That package would also provide re-
lief to another group of heroes who 
risked their lives for America and who 
did so on foreign soil: our civilian part-
ners in Afghanistan. This package 
would provide an additional 8,000 spe-
cial immigrant visas to Afghan inter-
preters who supported our diplomats 
and troops on the frontlines of Amer-
ica’s longest war. 
As we begin to finally bring our 
troops home from Afghanistan, let’s 
not forget the heroes who supported 
them and risked their lives to help 
them. Many of these individuals and 
their families are no longer safe if the 
Taliban takes control. We need to give 
them a new home in America. I am 
glad this bill provides the means to do 
so. 
I thank Senator LEAHY for leading 
the negotiations. I hope every Senator 
will support it. 
Yesterday, Officer Harry Dunn told 
the Select Committee about the anx-
iety he and other officers felt when the 
remaining security fence around the 
Capitol was taken down, but little else 
has been done to protect this building 
from another mob insurrection. 
Officer Dunn said: ‘‘When that fence 
came down—when we lost that last 
layer of protection—that was hard. . . . 
The fence came down and still nothing 
has changed. Everything is different, 
but still nothing has changed.’’ 
This is the time to show the officers 
who protected us and the world that 
when you defend America in our time 
of need, we will stand by you. I urge all 
my colleagues to support the security 
supplemental bill. It is the least that 
we can do. 
Mr. President, there is one other 
thing I would like to say. It is just too 
close to call. I thought about it long 
and hard, and it is just too close to 
call. 
In an effort to plumb the depths of 
political 
meanness 
and 
irrespon-
sibility, it is just hard to choose be-
tween 
Tucker 
Carlson 
and 
Laura 
Ingraham. First, they became our Na-
tion’s leading anti-vax quacks, making 
their specious arguments against life-
saving COVID–19 vaccines and sowing 
doubt among their viewers, who were 
literally putting their lives at risk be-
cause of the lies that these two individ-
uals are spouting. And now—and now— 
they are creating a braying chorus fo-
cused on defaming the police who de-
fended this building on January 6. 
Their mockery of the bravery of the 
Capitol and DC police, who risked and 
some lost their lives on the January 6 
attack on the Capitol Building, is cow-
ardly and shameful. 
It took courage for the police to face 
the Trump mob. It takes no courage for 
these FOX talking-heads to belittle 
these officers. It takes no courage to 
practice their well-worn smirks react-
ing to the bravery of these policemen. 
It is hard to imagine reading a press 
account of what they said yesterday 
and last night about the hearing that 
took place, the things that they did. 
Ingraham gave the ‘‘best performance 
in an action role’’ to Washington Met-
ropolitan 
Police 
Officer 
Michael 
Fanone, who, during the testimony, re-
called fearing he would be shot with his 
own gun. 
Ingraham said: ‘‘Well, there was cer-
tainly a lot of violence that day, but it 
was not a terrorist attack. It wasn’t 9/ 
11. It wasn’t the worst thing that ever 
happened to America. It wasn’t an in-
surrection.’’ 
And then Tucker Carlson responded 
with a smirk to the footage of Fanone 
telling the hearing he had experienced 
post-traumatic stress disorder. 
Throughout the monologue, Carlson 
piled onto his previous claims about 
the violence just being a ‘‘political pro-
test that got out of hand.’’ 
First the vaccines and now defaming 
the police—this is irresponsible from 
start to finish. I would ask those at 
FOX network, not exactly my friends 
and allies in politics, to show common 
decency and common sense—common 
sense when it comes to these vaccines, 
which we know if more people were 
vaccinated we wouldn’t be facing this 
resurgent need for masks and fear of 
this new variant. And common decency 
when it comes to the men and women 
in uniform when it comes to risking 
their lives for this Capitol, this democ-
racy, and this government. Certainly, 
there is freedom of speech, but let’s 
hope that good sense will dominate 
this discussion over at the FOX net-
work as to whether these two ought to 
be allowed to continue their rant. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is my 
understanding that prior to my re-
marks on the floor, we were going to 
recognize the Senator from Minnesota 
for 10 minutes or so. So if that is still 
desired by the Senator from Minnesota, 
I would be glad to yield. 
And since the Senator from Min-
nesota is not present, I will go ahead 
and make my remarks. 
I do ask unanimous consent that I be 
recognized as if in morning business for 
such time as I shall consume. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
LIGADO 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of 
all, I am here today to share some news 
about a key subject we have been talk-
ing about for quite some time, and that 
is Ligado. It is a complicated thing. It 
is something where one company was 
able to get rushed over a weekend in 
April of 2020 and get recognized and get 
an agreement from the FCC to have an 
operation that deals with the individ-
uals that are wanting to be involved in 
this group.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5121 
July 28, 2021 
The 15 government Departments and 
Agencies signed a petition for reconsid-
eration of a flawed decision. Keep in 
mind that this is a decision by the FCC 
with the NTIA, the National Tele-
communications 
and 
Infrastructure 
Administration, because they manage 
Federal spectrum. 
Now, when the new administration 
was sworn in this January, the peti-
tions were still pending. The NTIA, 
which I just now used the initials of, is 
very well-known. This is the one that 
has the responsibility to take care of 
the Department of Commerce, some of 
their instructions, some of their activi-
ties. So I spoke with Secretary Gina 
Raimondo, who is the Secretary of 
Commerce for the new administration, 
about the importance of continuing the 
petition for reconsideration. I also fol-
lowed up with a letter. 
What is a petition of reconsideration? 
What we are talking about here is that 
a decision was made by the FCC, and 
they have been petitioned by almost 
every bureaucracy and many, many in-
dividuals—over 100—to have a reconsid-
eration. And this has not happened yet. 
And so we changed administrations, 
and, of course, the new administration 
came in and Secretary Gina Raimondo 
did a great job with the importance of 
continuing the petition for reconsider-
ation. 
I wanted to make sure that even with 
the change in administration, the gov-
ernment Departments and Agencies 
still wanted to see the harmful order 
repealed. And here is the breaking 
news. I just got a letter from Secretary 
Raimondo, confirming now that ‘‘there 
has been no change to the Department 
of Commerce’s or [the] NTIA’s opposi-
tion to the FCC’s Ligado Order.’’ 
And that says it all. It says this ad-
ministration is in full agreement with 
the previous administration, and they 
will be acting accordingly. 
She also pledges that the NTIA will 
continue to pursue the petition for re-
consideration—the petition that rep-
resents the Departments of Commerce, 
Defense, Interior, Justice, Homeland 
Security, 
Energy, 
Transportation, 
NASA, FAA, and more—virtually, the 
entire government. 
Now, this is huge. This shows, once 
again, that there is bipartisan concern 
about the Ligado order and that it is 
continuing into the Biden administra-
tion. 
It is not an exaggeration when I say 
that the Ligado order would be dev-
astating to public safety, our national 
defense, and even our way of life. And 
everybody knows that. 
The reliability of GPS and satellite 
communications is necessary for the 
safety of life operations, national secu-
rity, and economic activity. 
Here are some of the day-to-day 
things people might not think of as 
being a part of the users of GPS and 
how it affects our daily lives. A big one 
is using your credit card or debit card 
when you are making a purchase or 
anything in terms of making trans-
actions. 
Another one is making a phone call— 
even making a phone call. Cell phone 
networks rely on GPS to synchronize 
the cell towers so calls can be passed 
seamlessly. Otherwise, they could get 
bogged up, and if they experience inter-
ference, your call could be dropped 
when moving from tower to tower. 
Here is one that most people don’t 
expect, and that is energy. Why would 
energy be dependent upon an accurate 
and reliable GPS system? Well, wheth-
er that is filling up your tank at the 
pump or managing electrical grids to 
light our homes, we rely on GPS tim-
ing to safely operate underground pipe-
lines and our electricity grid. 
Farmers and ranchers depend on GPS 
and satellite communications when 
planting crops, applying fertilizer, and 
during our harvest operations, to move 
large critical machinery from place to 
place. 
I was back in my State of Oklahoma 
last week and met with a bunch of 
farmers, and I learned myself how 
farmers are using GPS now. This is a 
thing that wasn’t true just a few years 
ago, but it is true now. 
Working out. A lot of healthy people 
are out there doing what they ought to 
be doing with their bodies, and that is 
working out. A study last year found 
that one-fifth—that is 20 percent—of 
all Americans use a fitness tracker or 
smart watch, the majority of which use 
the GPS to count steps and track dis-
tances. 
Taking a flight. Commercial and ci-
vilian aviation relies on GPS naviga-
tion and satellite communications to 
operate safely. 
Driving around. Each day, countless 
Americans rely on Google Maps, Waze, 
Apple Maps, and other forms of naviga-
tion systems to get them from point A 
to point B. And they rely on GPS to do 
that. 
And while no one hopes that they 
ever need a firetruck, an ambulance, or 
other emergency services, 9–1-1 opera-
tors and EMS use GPS and satellite 
communications to locate a caller and 
navigate as quickly as possible. 
We had a hearing just a few weeks 
ago, and we had the Helicopter Opera-
tors Association talk about their emer-
gency runs and what would happen to 
them if they lost the reliability of 
GPS. 
And there is more: weather fore-
casting, the movement of goods on our 
highways, surveying maritime harbors 
and channels, operation with construc-
tion and mining equipment. The list 
goes on and on. 
I had a personal experience about 20 
years ago with one of the uses; that is, 
I had occasion with three individuals 
and participants to fly an airplane 
around the world. 
I am from Oklahoma. Of course, we 
are all familiar with Will Rogers. Some 
people are not quite as familiar with 
Wiley Post. Wiley Post flew around 
with Will Rogers. They flew around the 
world. So what I was doing was repli-
cating that flight in my plane around 
the world. I was using a Trimble—that 
is the manufacturer—a Trimble TNL 
2000. That was the first time, I think— 
I haven’t checked since then—that it 
has been used for private use for flying 
around the world. Nonetheless, that is 
a GPS system. 
Because the FCC order allows Ligado 
to repurpose spectrum to operate a ter-
restrial-based network, Ligado signals 
on Earth’s surface will be much more 
powerful than GPS, causing substan-
tial and harmful interference. 
How do we know Ligado will cause 
interference? 
The FCC told us when they approved 
the 
Ligado 
order. 
They 
said—you 
should listen to the FCC statement: 
Ligado shall expeditiously repair or re-
place as needed any U.S. Government GPS 
devices that experience or are likely to expe-
rience harmful interference from Ligado’s 
operations. 
That is a quote. Remember that 
quote. I will tell you about a bill we 
will introduce to correct this problem 
that is serious to so many people. 
Last year, we also held a hearing on 
the Armed Services Committee to hear 
how the Ligado order would impact the 
military and warfighter. All of the wit-
nesses—Dana Deasy, Michael Griffin, 
General Raymond—they are all united. 
Dana Deasy, the former Chief Infor-
mation Officer at the DOD, said it best 
when asked if he thought the Ligado 
order would have an impact on DOD or 
the Federal spectrum. He said: 
Yes, the fact that we’re sitting here today, 
and you have General Raymond here rep-
resenting our military, would clearly suggest 
that . . . 
We wouldn’t be sitting here today if 
it didn’t have a heavy impact on our 
military operations. 
There has been multiple testimony 
about that. The NTIA petition filed in 
April of 2020—and, again, signed by the 
Departments of Commerce, Defense, 
Interior, Justice, Homeland Security, 
Energy and Transportation, as well as 
agencies like NASA and the FAA—is 
also clear and united. There is no divi-
sion of opinion on this. 
That alone should be enough to over-
turn the order. If not, we need to make 
sure Federal agencies, State govern-
ments, and all others negatively im-
pacted by the actions of Ligado are not 
left holding the bag when it comes to 
costs and, worse, aren’t put in the posi-
tion where they have to push the costs 
onto the American consumers. 
Everyone is on our side with this. 
The whole of government and over 100 
private-sector groups all agree, and 
they all agree no one else is on the side 
of Ligado except paid lobbyists. 
Ligado said this order is about win-
ning the race to 5G and beating China. 
Those who claim Ligado’s proposal is 
necessary to beat China’s 5G push are 
deliberately mixing up two different 
and important spectrum issues in order 
to sell their product: the sharing of 
mid-band 5G spectrum by DOD with in-
dustry and harmful interference of 
Ligado’s signal with the low-band GPS

signals used in nearly every aspect of 
daily life. 
Ligado’s 
spectrum 
they 
are 
repurposing is not in prime mid-band 
spectrum being considered for 5G, and 
Ligado’s low-band spectrum was not a 
part of the FCC’s own plan to accel-
erate 5G development released in Sep-
tember 2018, called the 5G FAST Plan. 
Reliable GPS and satellite commu-
nications are important to everyone in 
America and drives much of our Na-
tion’s economy. We should not sacrifice 
GPS reliability. In the event the peti-
tions for reconsideration are not suc-
cessful—I can’t imagine they would not 
be because almost every bureaucracy 
in most of the private sector are behind 
these. This is happening all over the 
country. But in the event that the peti-
tions for reconsideration are not suc-
cessful, I have introduced legislation, 
and I won’t give you the name of that 
because it is one of these things where 
there are too many words involved. We 
refer to it as the RETAIN Act to pro-
tect the users of GPS when, by approv-
ing the Ligado order, the FCC did not. 
Just last week, companion legisla-
tion was passed by the House of Rep-
resentatives, by JIM COOPER, MIKE TUR-
NER, FRANK LUCAS, GT Thompson, KEN 
CALVERT, NYDIA
VELA´ ZQUEZ, ABIGAIL 
SPANBERGER, and DON BEYER. They in-
troduced companion legislation to that 
legislation that we are currently intro-
ducing. 
As of last week, we had more than 100 
organizations who have signed a letter 
supporting the RETAIN GPS Act to 
hold Ligado accountable for the inter-
ference that they cause. 
Clearly, the momentum is with us 
and 
the 
letter 
from 
Secretary 
Raimondo I announced earlier is a 
great example of that. Clearly, today’s 
announcement is a big step for the 
good guys. 
Let me make sure people understand 
what we are talking about. We are 
talking about those who are respon-
sible—that is Ligado—for the use of 
that spectrum, if and when, as most 
people are predicting, it does some-
thing that damages the GPS system. 
We are talking about the system that 
every user in America uses—that if 
they do that, then they have to pay for 
it. That is all. They have to pay for it 
rather than have the public pay for it. 
Now, that is really the end of what I 
am trying to get across to people how 
serious this is. 
I want to put down in the RECORD all 
the agencies that are strongly sup-
porting this. We have the Department 
of the Army, Department of Defense, 
Department of the Air Force, Depart-
ment of the Navy, Department of Com-
merce, NASA, Department of Interior, 
Department of Justice, Department of 
Homeland Security, Department of En-
ergy, National Science Foundation, De-
partment of Transportation, U.S. Coast 
Guard, and the Federal Aviation Ad-
ministration. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that, at the conclusion of my re-
marks, these organizations be printed 
in the RECORD. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. INHOFE. I would add to that 
group the NTIA, which represents a lot 
of government in addition to what I 
just read. I would like to add the 
names—I have a list here of well over 
100—talking about Aerospace Associa-
tion, Agricultural interests, the Amer-
ican Farm Bureau, all of these—vir-
tually every recognizable organization 
in America is among the 105 organiza-
tions that are supporting this. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that this letter also be printed in 
the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
The undersigned IRAC agencies endorse 
and support the position stated by the De-
partment of the Air Force and the Depart-
ment of Defense:

DEAR SENATORS: The undersigned compa-
nies and organizations strongly endorse the 
Recognizing and Ensuring Taxpayer Access 
to Infrastructure Necessary for GPS and Sat-
ellite Communications Act or the ‘‘RETAIN 
GPS and Satellite Communications Act’’ in-
troduced today. This legislation would en-
sure that the costs incurred by the public 
sector, businesses and consumers as a result 
of the FCC’s decision to permit Ligado Net-
works LLC to use spectrum in a way that 
would cause interference to GPS and sat-
ellite communications would be covered by 
Ligado—the licensee benefiting from the de-
cision. 
The FCC’s Ligado Order already recognizes 
the potential for interference to GPS receiv-
ers and requires that, ‘‘Ligado shall expedi-
tiously repair or replace as needed any U.S. 
Government GPS devices that experience or 
are likely to experience harmful interference 
from Ligado’s operations.’’ But the Order 
failed to go far enough in three key ways. 
First, it did not provide an adequate descrip-
tion of the potential costs to federal agencies 
and thus the American taxpayer. Federal 
agencies are responsible for ensuring reliable 
GPS and satellite communications necessary 
for all manner of safety of life operations. 
Second, while recognizing the potential costs 
associated with interference to Federal agen-
cy owned devices, the FCC order inexplicably 
fails to require that Ligado also bear the 
costs of interference to other government 
and private owners of devices and applica-
tions that may be disrupted by Ligado’s pro-
posed operations. Third, the Order improp-
erly applies interference limits that are fun-
damentally insufficient to protect critical 
satellite communications and navigation 
signals from unknown millions of Ligado de-
vices operating over wide geographic areas. 
Ninety-nine percent of GPS receivers are 
used in critical applications by non-Federal 
government users, businesses and consumers. 
In addition, the Order similarly threatens 
the satellite communications networks that 
can enable technologies used to complement 
and support GPS. The reliability of GPS and 
satellite communications is necessary for 
safety of life operations, national security 
and economic activity; critical communica-
tions capabilities; commercial and civil avia-
tion; first responders, 9–1–1 and other public 
safety operators; military readiness and 
communications; weather forecasting; the 
movement of goods on our highways; the 
marking maritime harbors and channels; 
farmers planting and harvesting crops; oper-
ation of construction and mining equip-
ment—and the list goes on and on. 
The Retain GPS and Satellite Communica-
tions Act acknowledges the harm to GPS 
and satellite communications end users 
caused by the Ligado order and ensures the 
burden of cost sits squarely where it be-
longs—on Ligado, rather than our first re-
sponders, farmers, pilots, boat owners, sur-
veyors or construction companies. We com-
mend you for recognizing the expense and 
burden the Ligado order places on federal 
agencies, American taxpayers, businesses 
and consumers, and for providing clear and 
immediate relief to critical stakeholders 
with this legislation. Thank you for your 
leadership on this important issue.

Mr. INHOFE. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Minnesota. 
JANUARY 6 SELECT COMMITTEE 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to speak about 
how we must pass emergency security 
supplemental appropriations legisla-
tion to deliver needed funding to the 
Capitol Police and the National Guard. 
Anyone who watched yesterday the 
moving testimony of the officers who 
protected this Capitol, I think, under-
stands that we cannot wait. 
I appreciate the efforts by my col-
leagues both over in the House as well 
as here in the Senate, Appropriations 
Chairman LEAHY and Ranking Member 
SHELBY, as well as Senator BLUNT who 
works with me on the Rules Com-
mittee, to reach a bipartisan proposal 
on this critical funding issue, and we 
should pass this agreement without 
delay. 
But after passing this important leg-
islation, we must also continue to 
work to ensure that all the funding 
needs in the aftermath of January 6 are 
met, including with respect to funding 
for the Justice Department to bring 
those who participated in the insurrec-
tion to justice and to ensure there is 
sufficient funding for security improve-
ment for the Capitol. 
When an angry, violent mob staged 
an insurrection on January 6 and dese-
crated this Chamber, the temple of our 
democracy—what they did over in the 
House, what they did in the hallways, 
spray-painted on the columns, the Par-
liamentarian office in shreds—it was 
an attack on our Republic itself. 
As chair of the Rules Committee, I 
knew that we had to respond imme-
diately in two ways: One was imme-
diately finishing our job that day and 
getting the ballots counted; and then, 2 
weeks later, making sure that inau-
guration took place on that platform, 
which they had also desecrated only 2 
weeks before. 
But the second piece was to get to 
the bottom of what happened. I am 
glad that the House, with their bipar-
tisan Select Committee, is continuing 
this work. Our focus in the Senate was 
more limited, but Senator BLUNT and 
Senator PETERS and Senator PORTMAN 
and I combined our committees to 
look, to get some immediate answers 
so we could achieve this funding, as 
well as do some other things that 
couldn’t wait for a year, that we had to 
get done right away. 
That is why we convened immediate 
hearings with both officials who are re-
sponsible for security at the Capitol, 
including people who are no longer in 
their positions and with representa-
tives from key Federal agencies. 
We held the first hearing of the event 
of that horrific day. Our bipartisan re-
port focused on security, planning, and 
response failures related to the violent 
and unprecedented insurrection that 
includes key findings and recommenda-
tions that should be put in place with-
out delay. 
We learned about one Capitol Police 
officer who could be heard on the radio 
that day asking a tragically simple 
question: Does anyone have a plan? 
Sadly, there was no plan. 
We found out there was no depart-
mentwide operational plan in place be-
fore January 6. We are pleased we have 
a new police chief who has started this 
last week, who I know will be com-
mitted to getting that plan and work-
ing with our Sergeant at Arms, with 
our new employees here who are com-
mitted to work on this, as well as all of 
those police officers who stood with us 
that day and protected us from harm. 
We found out in that report that, al-
though Capitol Police activated seven 
Civil Disturbance Unit platoons, only 
four were trained in advanced civil tac-
tics and had access to full riot gear. Of-
ficers in one platoon couldn’t access 
equipment that was locked on a bus. 
Less than 10 percent of officers—160 of 
1,840 sworn officers—were trained in 
advanced civil disturbance tactics. 
With respect to intelligence, neither 
the FBI nor the Department of Home-
land Security issued a threat assess-
ment or intelligence bulletin warning 
of the potential for violence on the 
Capitol on January 6. They admitted at 
the hearing they didn’t adequately 
look at social media or take it seri-
ously. 
At the same time, Capitol Police in-
telligence reports in advance of the at-
tack conflicted with each other. One 
warned of the Capitol being a target for 
home violence on January 6, and an-
other rated the likelihood of civil dis-
turbance as ‘‘remote’’ to ‘‘improbable.’’ 
It appeared nothing was actually re-
solved. 
We also found out that, while the Na-
tional Guard should have been called 
sooner, they began arriving at the Cap-
itol at 5:20 p.m., more than 4 hours 
after the barriers were first breached 
and nearly 3 hours after the Defense 
Department got a request for support 
from the Capitol Police. 
In light of these findings, our report 
made 
many 
recommendations 
per-
taining to both Capitol Police and Fed-
eral agencies. These are measures that 
could be acted on without delay while 
important oversight continues. 
With respect to security here at the 
Capitol, progress has already been 
made, as I mentioned, with the ap-
pointment of the new police chief. We 
said that should be done immediately. 
I have also introduced legislation 
with Senator BLUNT to put in place an-
other one of our recommendations, 
which is to empower the Capitol Police 
Chief to directly request assistance 
from the DC National Guard in emer-
gency situations. 
One of the many absurd and trag-
ically sad situations was that day 
when, of course, there had been mess- 
ups in not requesting the Guard ear-
lier, which could have changed things 
dramatically. 
But on that day, the Chief had to try 
to call the Sergeant at Arms of both 
Chambers, both of whom were leading 
the fight against the insurrectionists 
with the police. He had to make those 
phone calls because he felt that he 
needed that permission to be able to 
call in the National Guard. 
What our bill simply does is it gives 
the Capitol Police Chief, in those dire 
emergency situations, the power to do 
that. 
The agreement announced yesterday 
would also go a long way toward imple-
menting another of our recommenda-
tions, which is one of the most crucial: 
to ensure that the Capitol Police has 
sufficient personnel with appropriate 
training and equipment to fulfill its 
mission. 
Crucially, yesterday’s agreement in-
cludes essential funding for the Capitol 
Police and National Guard, including 
funding for exactly what is called for in 
our report. This comes at a critical 
time when the Capitol Police is ex-
pected to run out of funding for sala-
ries in August, and the National Guard 
is considering having to cut upcoming 
training 
without 
having 
additional 
support. 
The agreement also includes Capitol 
Police funding for improved equipment 
and training to ensure officers have the 
resources they need to fulfill their mis-
sion of protecting the Capitol. Impor-
tantly, the Capitol Police funding also 
includes money for mental health sup-
port, something I specifically called 
for.

It also fully reimburses the National 
Guard for their costs in deploying to 
the Capitol, which was essential to se-
curing the Capitol following the at-
tack. 
By the way, we all know we need to 
recruit more officers, and I believe the 
stability of having a police Chief in 
place, particularly one from this re-
gion, and also having the funding and 
the benefits and the things we need 
will be helpful in our major effort that 
must be done to recruit more Capitol 
Police. People have been working too 
many shifts; they have been working 
too late; and they have been away from 
their families for too long. 
While this proposal will deliver need-
ed funding for these urgent priorities, 
there are other priorities that we must 
not forget. 
First, it remains imperative that the 
criminal insurrectionists who overtook 
the Capitol on January 6 are held ac-
countable to the fullest extent of the 
law. The Justice Department has done 
incredible work to see that justice is 
done following the horrific events of 
that day, with more than 500 people 
now facing criminal charges. That is, 
by the way, very important that we 
fund that. That is something we may 
have to take up in the future as some 
of these cases may be very complex. 
Secondly, at the same time, the in-
surrection also made clear—and we all 
know this—the need to improve the se-
curity of the Capitol Complex itself. 
This includes funds requested to up-
grade the windows and doors that were 
destroyed by the violent mob that day 
and for new security measures. As we 
move forward, while I appreciate the 
funding in this bill, there may be need 
for additional funding. 
We heard again yesterday about the 
horrific events of January 6 during 
that hearing. We heard that harrowing 
testimony, once again, from brave offi-
cers who performed heroically under 
unimaginable circumstances. We all 
know the stories of staff hiding in clos-
ets. We all have seen the videos of how 
close it was for so many Members. We 
owe it to those who are with us today, 
for those we have lost, and for those 
whom we want to hire in the future to 
keep us safe. We owe it to them to pass 
this legislation to fund the Capitol Po-
lice and National Guard, but we also 
will owe it to them in the future to 
fund these ongoing prosecutions and 
other security improvements. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
working to ensure that we pass this 
bill and also that the critical funding 
needs are met as we move forward, for 
nothing is more important to this 
place than our democracy. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana. 
Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that my remarks 
may conclude shortly after 1:10 p.m. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I have 
good news for the people of Louisiana 
and good news for the American people: 
We have an agreement on an infra-
structure package. 
Now, OK, an ‘‘infrastructure pack-
age’’; what does that mean? Let’s just 
talk. 
There will be $110 billion for roads 
and bridges nationwide—$40 billion for 
bridges. By the way, Louisiana has the 
third most bridges in poor condition. 
So, if you are stuck right now in traffic 
trying to get over the Sabine River or 
the Calcasieu River or the Mississippi 
River or any of our other rivers which 
have bridges in poor condition, there is 
relief for you. There is $47 billion for 
resiliency. 
Now, my State is flooded more than 
other States, but every State, it seems, 
has had an issue with flooding. There is 
$47 billion; a significant portion of it is 
for flooding issues, for coastal restora-
tion, and other things regarding resil-
iency. 
There is permitting reform. Right 
now, we know it can take 6 to 10 years 
for a bridge project—an Army Corps of 
Engineers project—to be permitted. 
Sometimes it takes so long to permit 
that the facts on the ground have actu-
ally changed, and the permit almost is 
inaccurate. In building upon pilot 
projects which have shown that per-
mitting can be shortened from 6 years 
to 2 years, this infrastructure package 
has that permitting reform. There will 
be less money for bureaucrats and at-
torneys, and there will be more money 
for construction—what a major ad-
vance. 
By the way, some people have con-
fused this bill with the $3.5 trillion 
Democratic 
tax-and-spend 
extrava-
ganza. They are two different bills. 
This bill is for roads and bridges and 
broadband and resiliency and flood con-
trol and coastal restoration. The other 
is for who knows what. 
This bill, the infrastructure bill, has 
been judged by economists as to not 
contribute to inflation. The $3.5 tril-
lion bill, obviously, is going to make 
the inflation we have now worse. The 
bill we have does not raise taxes. The 
$3.5 trillion bill is estimated to raise 
hundreds of billions of dollars in taxes. 
One bill I love; the other bill I hate. 
The infrastructure bill that is going to 
shorten 
someone’s 
commute 
time 
across a bridge, to make their home 
less 
likely 
to 
flood, 
to 
extend 
broadband to areas of our country 
which are not served at all or are poor-
ly served is the bill I love, and I think 
that it is the bill that the American 
people desperately need. 
Let me conclude by saying, again, if 
you are stuck in bridge traffic in my 
State or in any other State right now, 
wondering why this bridge in poor con-
dition can’t get fixed, help is on its 
way. If you are in a place in our coun-
try, but particularly in my State, 
which has either flooded or is at risk of 
flooding or if you live near a coastline, 
and that beachfront, which 30 years 
ago when you bought that home was 
hundreds of feet out and now waves are 
lapping up on the road in front of your 
house and coastal erosion has endan-
gered your property and your life sav-
ings, help is on its way. If you have 
seen an initiative to build a bridge but 
have been so frustrated that it has 
taken so long to get the permits, that 
is about to change. This is legislation— 
bipartisan, paid for—that will address 
all of those issues. 
I conclude the way I started. 
We have good news. There is a bipar-
tisan infrastructure bill that begins to 
address the needs of the American peo-
ple—to create jobs, to take away frus-
trations, and to provide more secu-
rity—that all Americans should sup-
port. 
I yield the floor.

EXECUTIVE CALENDAR—Continued 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
DEBT CEILING 
Ms. ERNST. Madam President, we 
have all experienced a bit of buyer’s re-
morse this past year. The uncertainty 
caused by the pandemic had folks 
stockpiling too much or just doing a 
little online retail therapy for things 
they may never use. But when it comes 
to impulse buying, no one can compete 
with Democrats in Washington. If run-
ning up the taxpayers’ tab was an 
Olympic sport, Democrats would easily 
take home the gold. 
Over the past 6 months, the Demo-
crats have run up trillions of dollars in 
new spending. And as we are just days 
away from hitting the Nation’s debt 
limit, these same Democrats are pre-
paring to charge trillions more to the 
Nation’s credit card, paid for by tax-
payers, of course, to purchase more of 
their pricey, partisan pet projects and 
other items on their progressive wish 
list. 
Their reckless spending spree started 
in March with their strictly partisan 
$2.1 trillion, a so-called COVID bill. 
The Democrats assured us the $1,400 
stimulus checks and $300-a-week en-
hanced 
unemployment 
benefits 
in-
cluded in the bill would get America 
back on its feet. Well, folks, this July 
28, we have 10 million unfilled jobs. 
Last week, jobless claims increased. 
And hard-working Americans are feel-
ing the pinch and paying more for al-
most everything, from gas to groceries. 
The Democrats’ poisonous progressive 
policies are failing us, and Iowans and 
the rest of Americans know it. Yet

Democrats—they just keep on spend-
ing. 
Right now, the majority leader is 
plotting to fast-track an everything- 
but-the-kitchen-sink tax-and-spending 
bill that could cost more than $31⁄2 tril-
lion. So what is in this latest bill? 
More poisonous progressive policies. 
One of the most harmful provisions 
to families everywhere and especially 
farm families in Iowa is what I like to 
call the farm-to-table tax hike. The 
Democrats want to pay for part of 
their radical agenda by increasing the 
tax on family farms being passed from 
one generation to the next. But that 
tax won’t only hit farmers and ranch-
ers; it will increase the cost of pro-
ducing and purchasing food for all of 
our families. 
Americans 
recognize 
President 
Biden’s budget-busting bills are a key 
factor in the skyrocketing costs; yet 
the Democrats keep packing their bills 
with 
progressive 
pet 
policies 
and 
projects they know won’t make your 
life better but that will appease their 
political base. And their answer when 
things don’t get better is always: Wait, 
we didn’t spend enough. 
Folks, it is laughable to argue that 
Washington hasn’t spent enough when 
our national debt now exceeds $28 tril-
lion. The shopaholics who control the 
purse strings in Congress are addicted 
to spending other people’s money on 
things we don’t need or that we can’t 
afford. 
Let’s 
review 
the 
receipt 
for 
Bidenomics: $2.1 trillion for Biden’s so- 
called American Rescue Plan, which 
includes $200 billion for enhanced un-
employment payments, $1.7 billion for 
Amtrak, $135 million for the National 
Endowment for the Arts, $50 million 
for environmental justice grants, plus 
$3.5 trillion for the proposed reckless 
tax-and-spending spree. 
We still don’t even know what 
goodies are included in this grab bag, 
but it is likely to include parts of the 
socialist Green New Deal and doubling 
the size of the IRS by hiring an army 
of new auditors. Add on nearly $10 bil-
lion for swampy earmarks to pay for 
pork projects. 
The list goes on and on and on, like 
the world’s longest CVS receipt; except 
you don’t expect any savings here, 
folks. 
And when you add it all up, the grand 
total: $6.8 trillion. 
As these bills come due, President 
Biden’s reckless spending spree will 
leave us with buyer’s remorse for years 
to come. It is time to cut up Washing-
ton’s credit card and make DC start 
living within its means, just like every 
hard-working family across Iowa and 
America do. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, when 
President Biden was campaigning last 
year, he made the pledge over and over 
again that he wouldn’t raise taxes on 
any 
American 
making 
less 
than 
$400,000 a year. 
Frankly, I think that is a good 
pledge, and it is one that he keeps 
making. But right now, it seems that 
the facts would prove that he and, 
frankly, our Democrat colleagues here 
in the Congress are pushing for this 
reckless tax spree, this reckless spend-
ing spree in a way that makes it impos-
sible for him to keep that pledge. 
The Tax Foundation—and people can 
check this if they want to verify these 
numbers—looked at President Biden’s 
10-year plan, the plan he outlined in his 
2022 budget. This is not a plan that the 
Tax Foundation or any other group 
came up with on their own. They found 
that his plan would mean a higher av-
erage tax burden nationwide, including 
for middle-class Americans. 
In some States, the average taxpayer 
would see increases immediately; in 
others, tax hikes would grow over time 
as the various provisions change in the 
way that the President’s plan says they 
would change. 
You know, no matter what the Presi-
dent says, the tax burden is getting 
heavier under his plan for middle-class 
families in every State. 
In Missouri, the tax burden on the 
average filer would be $618 higher in 
2026 than it is today. In New Hamp-
shire, it would be $1,072 higher than it 
is today. And maybe most importantly, 
in Nevada, it would be $1,293 higher 
than it is today for the average tax-
payer. 
And if that doesn’t convince you, 
there was another analysis recently. 
This one was from the reliably liberal 
Tax Policy Center. It predicted that 
three out of every four taxpayers earn-
ing $75,000 to $100,000 a year would be 
worse off next year under the Biden 
plan. 
By 2031, that organization estimates 
that 95 percent of the people making 
between $75,000 and $100,000 would suf-
fer losses on their tax bill. 
The tax-and-spending spree envisions 
monster tax hikes on business, but we 
all know when you raise taxes on busi-
ness, they have to get the money from 
somewhere. 
In fact, there are only a couple places 
to get the money, and one is from 
workers and one is from customers. 
And trying to figure out that balance 
where you don’t lose customers and 
you don’t lose workers is pretty hard 
to figure out. You really can’t isolate 
middle-class workers from these tax 
impacts. You also can’t isolate middle- 
class customers from these impacts. 
You can’t keep those families from 
paying higher prices when a chunk of 
the business tax that the President and 
Democrats talk about have to get 
passed on to customers. 
So President Biden’s tax increases 
are likely to boost inflation even more 
than we have seen already, and we have 
seen a lot of it already. Go to the gas 
pump, go to the grocery store, go to 
buy clothes, go to have the basic neces-
sities you have to have, and you are 
going to see that they are substan-
tially higher than they were a year ago 
or 2 years ago before COVID, a year ago 
during COVID. 
The President’s budget effectively re-
peals the individual tax cuts enacted 
by Republicans in 2017. The cuts that 
were enacted in that law for Ameri-
cans, really, across income levels, have 
rate reductions that have to be ex-
tended in 4 years. The President’s plan 
doesn’t call for extending any of those 
rate reductions. 
Under 
the 
President’s 
proposal, 
someone making $94,000 per year will 
see her marginal tax rate jump from 24 
percent to 28 percent in 2026. 
Added to that, you have got higher 
taxes that Democrats plan to impose 
on family farmers and ranchers who 
are hoping to pass along their family 
business to the next generation. 
And, frankly, instead of advocating 
for these middle-class Americans I 
have just talked about, our Democratic 
friends seem to be fixated on restoring 
the tax break that overwhelmingly 
benefits wealthy Americans in high-tax 
States. They are pushing to allow peo-
ple to deduct more than $10,000 in State 
and local taxes on their Federal re-
turns. 
That scheme, by the way, would 
allow the top 1 percent of earners to in-
crease their after-tax income by about 
2.5 percent, 2.8 percent, while the bot-
tom 60 percent of all filers—if that law 
is changed back to what it used to be, 
the bottom 60 percent of all filers 
would gain less than one one-hun-
dredth percent on average. 
It is clear that President Biden’s tax 
hikes will hit a lot of Americans and a 
lot of Americans that make less than 
$400,000. 
The higher tax costs will hurt people 
who are already struggling with higher 
prices at the pump and everywhere 
they shop, and it will hurt our eco-
nomic recovery. 
My friends may not want to admit— 
and I wouldn’t either if I was them— 
that they are going to raise taxes on 
middle-class families, but that is ex-
actly what they are doing. And if any-
body doesn’t know it now, they will 
know it if Democrats in the Senate and 
the House get their way. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, in less than 72 hours, the suspen-
sion on the Federal Government’s debt 
ceiling will expire. That leaves Con-
gress with two options: continue with 
the reckless, wasteful spending it is ac-
customed to without any account-
ability to the American people; or fi-
nally face reality, make some tough 
choices, and chart a path forward that 
lowers the Federal debt and gets spend-
ing under control. 
Washington is constantly spending 
more money and taking on new debt 
without any plan to ever reduce the 
debt. 
Since 1960, Congress has raised or ex-
tended the debt limit more than 70 
times. Washington’s choice to keep

raising or suspending the debt ceiling 
is like raising the limit on your credit 
card month after month with no plan 
to pay it off. 
It is reckless, and it is this kind of 
fiscal irresponsibility that is hurting 
American families and causing the ris-
ing inflation we are seeing. 
As you can see here, 87 percent of 
Americans are worried about infla-
tion—87 percent. Low- and fixed-in-
come families are having to cut on pur-
chases because of rising costs. 
Look at these numbers: Gas up 52 
percent in 12 months; milk, 11; bacon, 
16 percent; eggs, 6 percent; used cars, 45 
percent; utilities, 6 percent. 
I am hearing from families all across 
Florida who are worried. Read you a 
couple stories. 
A father of three in Jacksonville, 
who is temporarily helping to take 
care of two other kids because their fa-
ther is out of work, has started work-
ing a second job driving Uber just to 
pay for groceries that are rapidly in-
creasing in price. Now, his Uber job is 
becoming less and less profitable be-
cause the rising price of gas. 
Mother of four in Wauchula said she 
used to be able to go to the grocery 
store and spend a certain amount of 
money for an entire month’s groceries; 
now she can’t. Two hundred dollars in 
meat is not—is no longer enough to 
feed her family of five. She is being 
forced to choose between gas to get to 
work and groceries for her family, and 
is picking up extra jobs just to get by. 
I can relate to all this. I grew up in 
a family that struggled for money. My 
mom would take in ironing for extra 
money. She would send me or my older 
brother to the grocery store with exact 
change, but she told us: You have got 
to check the prices. The prices keep 
going up. And if it does, you have got 
to figure out how to get the food we 
need with less—with the money we 
have. 
I have spoken to the owner of a con-
struction company in West Palm Beach 
who says materials are going up. Twen-
ty-four dollars for a sheet of plywood is 
now $80 a sheet. Drywall is going up a 
dollar a board. Prices of hardware, like 
screws, are going up 10 to 15 percent 
per month. Delivery prices are going up 
due to gas and the shortage of truck 
drivers. His employees are complaining 
about gas and are afraid what it might 
mean if the price continues to rise. 
A restaurant owner in Tampa told 
me the cost of meat has gone up from 
$9 a pound to $18. Gas prices and food 
prices, coupled with the struggle to 
find workers, has been very hard on his 
business. 
Another family in Kissimmee told 
me how hard it is to keep food on the 
table because everything is so expen-
sive. They are having trouble keeping 
the car because of the cost of mainte-
nance and gas, but if he doesn’t have a 
car, he wouldn’t have a way to get to 
work to take care of his family. 
The price of gas affects nearly every-
one, and right now average gas prices 
are up nearly $1 since last year. 
For a family that fills up their tank 
once a week, if you drive a car, that 
means Joe Biden raised your expenses 
$600 a year; if you drive a truck, that 
means Joe Biden raised your expenses 
by more than $1,000 a year. 
Biden and the Democrats say they 
care about people, but they have done 
absolutely nothing to help families 
struggling to keep up with inflation. 
Their plan is to spend more, more, 
more money, not less. 
We have nearly $30 trillion in debt, 
and there are no plans to slow down. 
Now Biden and the Democrats want to 
spend another $5.5 trillion on their lib-
eral priorities, with no consideration 
as to how this might impact families. 
Right now, this message that Presi-
dent Biden and the Democrats in Wash-
ington are sending to the American 
people is clear: We don’t care about in-
flation. We don’t care about reckless 
spending that is causing prices to sky-
rocket. 
If they say that is the cost of getting 
our liberal—their liberal wish list done, 
so be it. 
I think it is a disgusting approach 
and I am not going to stand for it. I am 
here to say that enough is enough. It is 
time to wake up to reality. Eighty- 
seven percent of Americans are con-
cerned about inflation. We have to take 
action to get government spending 
under control, which is why we have 
introduced the Federal Debt Emer-
gency Control Act. 
My bill prevents Washington from 
mindlessly spending by requiring that 
two-thirds of the Senate vote to in-
crease the debt before approving any 
bill with deficit spending. 
It would also terminate any unobli-
gated funding from the American Res-
cue Plan and any previous spending 
bills—sending it back to the Treasury 
general fund for deficit reduction. 
Finally, it would ensure that any bill 
reducing the debt by at least 5 percent 
over 10 years is fast-tracked through 
the legislative process. 
I have also introduced an amendment 
to the Senate rules to require that all 
committee reports include inflationary 
impact statements so Americans can 
see the true impacts of government 
spending. 
Americans deserve to know how their 
hard-earned dollars are being spent and 
how Washington’s spending is affecting 
inflation. This will ensure they do. 
I welcome all my fiscally responsible 
colleagues to join me to say we don’t 
accept status quo. We won’t watch in 
silence as people try to spend us into 
oblivion. We won’t stand by while in-
flation wreaks havoc on our families 
and businesses. 
We can get spending under control. 
While I was Governor of Florida, we 
paid down one-third of our State debt 
by living within our means, all while 
cutting taxes and fees about 100 times. 
We can do it here, but we have to 
start acting responsibly today, and the 
time to do that is now. It is time to 
stand up for our grandkids, whose fu-
ture is being mortgaged for out-of-con-
trol Washington spending. This isn’t 
political. It is good government, and it 
is commonsense. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Madam President, 
America has seen a number of horren-
dous financial crises before, but none 
that have so quickly developed as the 
fiscal crisis this White House created 
with trillions of dollars’ worth of 
drunken spending and tax proposals in 
just the first 7 months of control. 
The most glaring, almost parody- 
level, example is the administration’s 
$3.5 trillion and growing, newly la-
beled, human infrastructure package, 
which is nothing more than a rosy- 
sounding title for socialism. 
The results of these radical tax-and- 
spending policies, what are they? A 
sluggish economy, inflation, and one of 
the most dramatic expansions of the 
welfare state in recent history. Re-
cently, the Department of Labor re-
ported that consumer prices climbed 
for the third straight month, jumping 5 
percent in June, the largest increase in 
13 years. 
Every day, we see inflation impact-
ing hard-working Americans. In fact, 
this past weekend, we held five town-
hall meetings in Kansas, and thanks to 
this administration’s economic poli-
cies, runaway inflation has replaced 
COVID at the top of the mountain of 
concerns for people of my home State. 
In Kansas, we are paying more than 
$1 more per gallon at the gas pump, 40 
cents more per gallon of milk, and al-
most 20 percent more for a home than 
we were at this time last year. While 
wages have increased, inflation con-
tinues to outpace them by more than 
two-to-one. I have heard loudly and 
clearly the concerns from Kansans, and 
especially from small business owners, 
the backbone of our economy, about 
the impact of the Democrats’ reckless 
summer tax-and-spending spree. 
One tax proposal, the elimination of 
stepped-up basis, would be devastating 
to small businesses and family farms, 
as that provision allows them to hand 
down their family business from one 
generation to the next without paying 
a costly tax burden. 
Under the administration’s plan, the 
average farmer would have a new tax 
obligation of nearly a quarter of a mil-
lion dollars, as cropland values in Kan-
sas have risen 220 percent since 1997, 
not to mention the economy-killing 
policy of eliminating 1031 exchanges 
and taxing capital gains at ordinary in-
come levels. 
On the spending front, this adminis-
tration 
continues 
to 
pursue 
unsustainable and irresponsible spend-
ing policies that are actually ruining 
our economic recovery. Further, they 
want to increase the debt limit without 
implementing any spending reforms. 
This is going to crush our children and 
grandchildren, leaving their generation 
to pay for the social sins of this gen-
eration.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5127 
July 28, 2021 
Instead of getting our fiscal house in 
order and curbing back on massive gov-
ernment spending, this administration 
and Democrats in Congress are work-
ing to pass trillions more in reckless 
spending under the guise of infrastruc-
ture. 
Pre-COVID, we had the greatest 
economy in my lifetime. That came 
about because we lowered people’s 
taxes, we lowered regulations, and we 
lowered energy prices. We need smart, 
targeted 
investments, 
not 
radical 
spending that leaves this country at a 
disadvantage and kills jobs. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, for far 
too long, the Federal Government has 
been borrowing and then spending 
money that it simply doesn’t have. 
This is something we have long under-
stood as a problem for the future, for 
future generations. But now it is not 
just a problem for the future any more. 
We 
are 
already 
feeling 
the 
con-
sequences right now. Americans of this 
generation are paying the price today. 
Why is this the case? Well, politi-
cians in Washington vote for enormous, 
reckless spending packages, and they 
do so for short-term political gain and 
praise. Now, we all know that does hap-
pen, and we all know that, whether it 
is a spending bill that is soon to come 
before this body or another, if it spends 
a lot of money, it probably will bring 
people a lot of praise. 
But it is the people—the hard-work-
ing families in Utah and in every other 
State 
across 
the 
Nation—who 
are 
forced to pay the price, the price for 
the praise and the political gain of the 
politician who votes for that sort of 
thing. They are the ones who bear the 
brunt of inflation’s consequences. It is 
making day-to-day life more expensive. 
More than anyone, it is the poor and 
middle class of America who are hit 
the hardest. 
Every single day, it is getting more 
expensive to fill cupboards, refrig-
erators, and bellies. Every day, it is 
getting more expensive to drive to 
work or drive to the doctor or drive 
your kids to the school. Every day, it 
is getting harder to buy a house or buy 
a car or pay for the heat and the air 
conditioning in your home. 
To give a few specific examples, gas 
prices are up over 50 percent from last 
year. This hurts people not only at the 
pump but with everything they buy, 
because everything they buy is more 
costly to transport and, therefore, 
more costly to purchase. 
Chicken prices are soaring. Boneless, 
skinless chicken breast is trading at $2 
per pound, compared to the $1.30 per 
pound it has averaged over the last two 
decades. Some diapers that in recent 
years have cost around $25 per package 
now cost around $40, and there are 
fewer diapers in each package. 
We, in Utah, are certainly feeling the 
crunch. According to a recent survey, 
85 percent of Utahns are worried about 
inflation, as well they should be. 
Now, 
what 
does 
the 
Democrats’ 
spending package amount to? A multi-
trillion-dollar inflation bomb. So far, 
we haven’t seen text, and we haven’t 
seen estimates about how much the bill 
will cost, exactly. We haven’t even seen 
what Democrats in the White House 
would like in the bill. But recent esti-
mates suggest that it will spend about 
$4 trillion, maybe more. The last thing 
we need for our already frightening in-
flation is to spend that amount of 
money. It is taking an already bad sit-
uation and making it far, far worse. 
In fact, this is the first time we have 
seen a spending package of this kind— 
one that spends the amount that it 
does. I don’t just mean the first time 
we have seen something like this in the 
Senate this year. I mean, when we are 
talking about a spending bill that is 
likely to cost $4 trillion, maybe more, 
that is more money than we in this 
body have ever spent. In fact, I would 
dare say it is more money than has 
ever been spent at any one time for one 
legislative proposal in the history not 
just of the United States of America 
but in the history of the world. 
I mean, look at it this way. There is 
no entity in the history of the planet 
that has amassed more economic power 
than the U.S. Government—the U.S. 
Government, which in recent years has 
been spending at a rate of about $4 tril-
lion a year. This bill, in one bill, could 
well spend that in one single legisla-
tive package. This is an astounding 
amount of money. No one has ever 
spent money in such a large quantity 
in the history of the world. 
What is more, this type of legislation 
has great potential—in fact, a darn 
near certainty—to carry out a reverse 
Robin Hood mission that is especially 
perverse, where we essentially rob the 
poor to give to the rich. Make no mis-
take. When we pass spending legisla-
tion like this, a small handful of well- 
connected people will get rich. They 
will get very rich. Why? Well, because 
they see it coming. They know how to 
play it. They know how to benefit from 
it, and they know how to capitalize on 
it. That is a very small group of people, 
and that is a small comfort to those 
who will be hurt by it. We will get to 
them in a minute. So that is the first 
category of people. 
You have a second category of people 
who are well-to-do. Maybe they don’t 
capitalize off of it, but they do end up 
paying a price. They find goods more 
expensive. But this small category of 
people, consisting of well-off people, 
might not actually feel the pinch be-
cause, perhaps, they have enough saved 
up; they have enough assets. It doesn’t 
really, 
meaningfully 
impact 
their 
standard of living or their quality of 
life. But even those first two cat-
egories—those who will get rich off of a 
bill like this and those who won’t feel 
much of an impact—make up a really 
small segment of the U.S. population, 
quite possibly, percentagewise, in the 
low single digits. But poor and middle- 
class Americans, many of whom live 
paycheck to paycheck, will be most 
hurt, as they will be the ones to feel 
their paychecks—their limited pay-
checks—stretched thinner and thinner 
each and every week. You see, the U.S. 
economy doesn’t suddenly make more 
goods simply because Congress decides 
to spend more. Quite to the contrary, 
it can’t. We don’t have the ability to 
create wealth. All we have the ability 
to do is channel existing wealth. So if 
we just add more dollars to an econ-
omy that already has access to a rel-
atively finite group of goods and serv-
ices in any given year, you are just 
going to increase the cost. That is 
what happens, and that is how poor and 
middle-class Americans get stuck with 
the bill. That is why poor and middle- 
class Americans end up being harmed 
in this bad bargain that is really good 
for a small handful of wealthy and well 
connected. It may be good for the mo-
ment for a small handful of politicians 
who will get praise and political gain 
for voting for it. It is really bad for 
poor and middle-class people, and that 
is wrong. 
Look, at the end of the day, govern-
ment is not the one hurt by massive, 
reckless spending packages like this 
one. People are. Real, breathing human 
beings are. The government doesn’t go 
hungry at the end of the month. The 
government doesn’t worry about pay-
ing rent when the kids need braces. 
The government isn’t forced to choose 
between buying groceries and paying 
medical bills. The government doesn’t 
forgo family reunions when it is time 
to tighten the belt. Taxpayers do. Fam-
ilies do, especially poor and middle- 
class families. The reckless spending 
must stop. This inflation bomb is ex-
ploding. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, my colleague said it so very well. 
The inflation bomb is exploding, and 
people in Tennessee are incredibly con-
cerned about that. I hear about this 
every single day from Tennesseans. 
They are also concerned about the 
fact that it seems that the Democratic 
majority has been unable to push for-
ward a budget that would be bipar-
tisan, that would have appropriate 
spending, and that would prioritize the 
needs and the concerns of the Amer-
ican people. 
Until just a few hours ago, we didn’t 
have any insight into an infrastructure 
bill that would be bipartisan, and I ap-
plaud those who have worked so dili-
gently to reach a bipartisan agree-
ment. But the American people have 
started to lose a lot of their trust and 
a lot of their patience with Wash-
ington, DC, and I think we can say 
‘‘rightfully 
so’’ 
because 
they 
are 
watching the cost of government go up. 
They are watching the hesitancy to 
move forward on their concerns, and 
they are speaking out to us. I had a 
Tennessean this week ask me why 
Washington was wasting so much time, 
because time is money, and they want 
to see things done.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5128 
July 28, 2021 
We know we need to see what these 
bills are going to look like. We are 
hearing that the majority wants to 
bring forward this tax-and-spend spree 
of legislation that would be trillions of 
dollars, and we know that what would 
end up happening is this would be 
something that—I call it lie, cheat, 
steal. You don’t say exactly what you 
are going to use the money for. You 
don’t say exactly where the money is 
going to come from within the budget. 
Eventually, all of it comes out of the 
taxpayers’ pocket. And you are steal-
ing hopes and dreams from future gen-
erations who are going to—they are 
going to have to pay the bill for this. It 
is our children and our grandchildren 
and future generations that are going 
to have to find a way to pay for all of 
this. 
That is why I brought this chart back 
to the floor. I have used it recently 
here on this floor to remind us of Ron-
ald Reagan’s words: 
Freedom is never more than one genera-
tion away from extinction. It has to be 
fought for and defended by each generation. 
Very true words. And what a good re-
minder to us because as we give gov-
ernment more control over our lives, as 
we give them more control in the Fed-
eral budget, as the government takes 
more money out of the pocket of hard- 
working taxpayers, what do we see? We 
see less freedom. 
There is such concern that the Demo-
cratic majority has refused to come 
forward and say how they want to 
spend these trillions of dollars. I think 
part of that is because there is not a 
way to pay for it, and they don’t plan 
to pay for it. Instead, they are going to 
send that bill to future generations. 
This is dangerous. We are upside 
down on this national debt when you 
look at how that debt clock is ticking. 
But we have to choose to spend tax-
payer money where it matters, and it 
still matters. It matters to Ten-
nesseans what their tax dollars are 
spent for, and it matters how they are 
spent. Another thing that matters to 
them is what we are spending it for and 
the driving of inflation across this 
country. 
If my Democratic colleagues con-
tinue to dig this hole, future genera-
tions will be in so deep that it will be 
very difficult for them to compete on 
the global stage. They will be vulner-
able to the deathtraps our adversaries 
in Beijing set for nations that have 
made the same mistakes that the 
Democratic 
majority 
wants 
us 
to 
make: spending more money than you 
have to spend for programs that you 
cannot afford. 
I would argue that existing in a state 
of dependence and vulnerability cre-
ated by our own government is the op-
posite of freedom. It is the opposite of 
freedom. Is that really what we want 
for our children and grandchildren, to 
leave them with so much Federal debt 
that they are covered in debt; that 
most of their paycheck is going to go 
to the Federal Government to pay for 
programs that have long outlived their 
usefulness? I think not. 
That is why it is so important that 
we look at what is happening right 
now, as there are these conversations 
about budgets and as there are these 
conversations about the tax-and-spend 
spree that my colleagues across the 
aisle would seek to propose. 
I would also offer that that type of 
spending is not governing. What it is, 
is a power grab. What it is, is taking 
care of your friends and not those who 
elected you to serve. The American 
people can see what is coming at them 
from a mile away, and they are ex-
pressing their concerns about DC’s out- 
of-control tax-and-spending spree. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The

OFFICER. 
The

The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read the nomination of David M. 
Prouty, of Maryland, to be a Member of 
the National Labor Relations Board for 
the term of five years expiring August 
27, 2026. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
EGYPT 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, right-
fully, this body is consumed with pend-
ing votes on infrastructure, but I want 
to draw my colleagues’ attention to an-
other matter of both importance and 
urgency. 
One of Vladimir Putin’s favorite tac-
tics during the Chechen rebellion was 
to kidnap the innocent relatives of 
rebel leaders and hold them captive 
until the leaders surrendered. Some-
times, if the rebel leader never gave 
himself up, the family members would 
just disappear forever. Thousands of 
these cases were documented over the 
course of the war, all in gross, blatant 
violation of human rights laws. It is 
one of the many reasons that Russia is 
an adversary, not an ally of the United 
States. We don’t do business with na-
tions that prey upon the innocent. We 
don’t align ourselves with nations that 
use kidnapping or torture as a tool to 
stay in power. 
A few months ago, Moustafa Soltan 
and Khairi Soltan were startled by a 
hard knock on their door in the wee 
hours of a February Sunday morning. 
It was the Egyptian authorities, there 
to detain them again simply because 
their cousin happened to be a man 
named Mohamed Soltan, an American 
citizen and vocal Egyptian human 
rights advocate. Rightly, Moustafa and 
Khairi were not surprised because for 
the past year, the Soltan family has 
been the subject of consistent, coordi-
nated harassment and detention by the 
agents 
of 
Egyptian 
dictator 
Abdelfattah Elsisi. 
Now, Sisi would probably argue that 
he uses the tactic of harassing and de-
taining family members of his political 
opponents in a more judicious manner 
than does Vladimir Putin, but he can’t 
deny that he does it. He further cannot 
deny the systematic method by which 
he has used the judicial system in 
Egypt to eliminate his political opposi-
tion. 
Now, a reliable estimate is hard to 
come by because the political arrests 
have come at a dizzying pace since 2013, 
but it is believed that there are 60,000 
people in jail today in Egypt because 
they are political opponents of the Sisi 
government. 
Now, Putin jails his political adver-
saries, too, but his number of around 
400 doesn’t come close to Sisi’s. But 
that is just the tip of the iceberg when 
it comes to the Egyptian regime’s 
treatment of political opponents. Only 
China and Iran execute more people 
every year than Egypt, and many of 
these 
executions 
are 
for 
political 
crimes. Journalists are currently under 
constant threat in Egypt. The country 
rates 166 out of 180 by the press free-
dom group Reporters Without Borders 
compared against other nations. 
In the 2018 Presidential election, Sisi 
had his main opponent arrested and 
had his campaign manager beaten up, 
causing all the other credible can-
didates to drop out of the race. 
Shockingly, Sisi won with 97 percent of 
the vote. That same year, Putin was 
less greedy. He gave himself only 70 
percent in his Presidential election. 
So why, you might ask, is Egypt our 
partner and Russia our adversary if 
their behavior is so malignantly simi-
lar? Why does Russia get sanctioned 
and Egypt get showered with $1.3 bil-
lion in military aid each year? 
Now, yes, there are important lines 
of cooperation between Egypt and the 
United States, and this explains some 
of that difference. Egypt’s 1979 peace 
treaty with Israel remains one of the 
most significant diplomatic achieve-
ments for the promotion of Arab- 
Israeli peace. For the last 40 years, 
Egypt has been a peace broker between 
the Israelis and the Palestinians. We 
rely on them historically. Egypt con-
tributed forces to the first gulf war in 
1990. The United States and Egypt 
often cooperate on counterterrorism 
work. Our ships often get preference in 
going through the Suez Canal, al-
though we pay for that privilege. 
All that is important, but none of it 
is enough to justify the damage done to 
U.S. power and prestige when the 
whole world watches America deliver 
this giant blank check each year to 
Egypt while Sisi engages in this re-
peated, brazen violation of human 
rights. How do you tell Russia and 
China to stop their campaigns of polit-
ical repression when we so openly en-
dorse the grandiose scale of Sisi’s? 
No, Egypt has come to believe that it 
can act any way that it wants, that it 
can carry out a massive campaign of 
political repression and that the Con-
gress and the American President, 
whether he be a Republican or a Demo-
crat, will just keep the money coming. 
And it is a stunning amount of money. 
The $1.3 billion security assistance 
package that Egypt gets every year 
from U.S. taxpayers is bested by only 
one other country in the world, and 
that is Israel. 
Most outrageous of all in light of this 
policy, Egypt arrests and imprisons 
American citizens with near impunity. 
Mohamed Soltan is not the only Egyp-
tian American to be arrested and tor-
tured as a political prisoner. Mustafa 
Kassem from Long Island, NY, was ar-
rested in 2013 while visiting family, 
just visiting family in Cairo. He died in 
an Egyptian prison in January of last 
year. There have been dozens of other 
American citizens. 
It is unacceptable that we would be 
providing over $1 billion in assistance 
to Egypt while they are holding a sin-
gle American in prison for political 
crimes. When countries accept our 
money and continue to thumb their 
noses at our values, it makes America 
look like a patsy. It makes us weaker 
as a nation. 
So many of us cheered when Presi-
dent Biden took office declaring that 
there would now be ‘‘a foreign policy 
that unites our democratic values with 
our diplomatic leadership, and one that 
is centered on the defense of democ-
racy and the protection of human 
rights.’’ President Biden’s team has 
been outspoken on human rights in our 
foreign policy by calling out abusive 
dictatorships who imprison their crit-
ics and muzzle free speech, reuniting 
our democratic allies in Europe against 
Russian election interference and Chi-
nese misinformation, and sanctioning 
corrupt oligarchs all over the world. 
That is great news. 
The Biden administration has chosen 
to make democracy and human rights 
a priority because they see this coming 
fight between Chinese- and Russian- 
modeled autocracy and American-led 
democracy. And over the last 4 years, 
Donald Trump’s affection for dictator-
ship, it gave our adversaries in the 
autocratic world a headstart. President 
Biden knows the future of the world de-
pends on our willingness as a nation to 
take a strong, immediate stand right 
now for democracy everywhere. 
And so let’s be clear. An administra-
tion that wants to lead on democracy 
and human rights cannot send another 
$1.3 billion to Egypt with no strings at-
tached. To do so would be to endorse 
Sisi’s crackdown and send a bright, 
blinking message to the world that 
America talks a big game on democ-
racy but isn’t willing to do much about 
it. 
Luckily, Joe Biden doesn’t have to 
take the heat when it comes to a 
change in Egypt policy. He can simply 
blame Congress and tell Sisi that he is 
just upholding the law. 
Why? 
For more than a decade, Congress has 
been conditioning some of the aid we

give to Egypt on its human rights 
record, hoping that if we tied a portion 
of the $1.3 billion to things like holding 
free and fair elections, or releasing po-
litical prisoners, allowing the media 
space to operate, that the Egyptian 
Government would make progress. 
But nearly every single year, the 
State Department waives those condi-
tions and just gives Egypt the money, 
even when the conditions aren’t close 
to being met. Only once—and I will 
give them credit for this—in 2017, Sec-
retary Tillerson cut $95 million and 
temporarily held up another $195 mil-
lion of Egypt’s aid money, but even 
that $195 million was released before 
all the conditions were met. 
Never has the State Department just 
said 
the 
obvious: 
The 
conditions 
weren’t met. We are not going to waive 
them. You are not getting the money. 
And we are talking about a portion of 
the money, this year, $300 million of 
the $1.3 billion. 
It is painfully clear that the lesson 
Egypt has learned over the years is a 
simple one: America is not serious 
about human rights, and so we don’t 
need to invest in improvements; we are 
going to get the money anyway. 
This year, Congress has said that the 
Secretary of State should withhold $300 
million of military aid to Egypt if Sisi 
doesn’t substantially reverse his cam-
paign of political repression and in-
timidation. What we know, unequivo-
cally, is that no meaningful progress 
has been made. The latest arrests of 
Mohamed Soltan’s family were done in 
February of this year. That was kind of 
like a thumb in the eye of the new ad-
ministration and the new Congress. 
Like clockwork every year, right be-
fore the annual waiver is given by the 
State Department, Egypt normally 
does release a few of the most egre-
giously 
detained 
prisoners 
or 
an-
nounces some minor change in policy, 
but it is always window dressing. The 
trend from year to year is always the 
same: more human rights violations, 
more intimidation, less free speech, 
less democracy. 
This year, the United States must 
withhold the $300 million, in accord-
ance with the law passed by this Con-
gress. It will send a message to Egypt 
that we are serious about reform and, 
maybe more importantly, it will send a 
message to the world that we are will-
ing to walk the walk, not just talk the 
talk. 
Now, this town freaks out whenever 
the security assistance gravy train 
goes off the rails, even for a moment. 
Keeping the pipeline of American arms 
flowing to brutal regimes, it makes a 
lot of people rich in Washington. And 
those people are whispering in the ears 
of Congress and the administration 
right now, making the claim, as they 
do every single year, that the sky is 
going to fall if Egypt doesn’t get its 
$1.3 billion—all of it, all of the $1.3 bil-
lion—as they have every year since 
1987. They will say that all the lines of 
cooperation that I mentioned earlier 
will disappear. 
But in reality, the return on invest-
ment for our military aid to Egypt, it 
has been diminishing for a long time 
now. And there is no reason that the 
things that we get from Egypt—Suez 
access, overflight rights, continued up-
holding of the peace treaty with 
Israel—will be overturned should they 
get only $1 billion rather than $1.3 bil-
lion this year. 
Why is that? 
Well, because in 1987, those benefits 
Egypt provides were arguably conces-
sions to our requests. But, today, 
Egypt does those things not because we 
pay them to do it, but because they 
have their own reasons to do them. 
For years, the United States looked 
the other way while another regional 
power, Saudi Arabia, carried out its 
own dizzying campaign of repression 
against its own people. We did vir-
tually nothing. We said virtually noth-
ing. Instead, we rewarded Saudi Arabia 
with record amounts of armed sales. 
And then one day, they kidnapped a 
U.S. resident and they chopped him to 
pieces. And America was made a fool in 
the eyes of the world, and, in some 
ways, we have had a hard time recov-
ering from that day. 
Mohamed Soltan, just like Jamal 
Khashoggi, believes that there is no 
other nation in the world that cares 
more about standing up for democracy 
and civil rights than America. Egypt 
doesn’t care. They harass and imprison 
his relatives at will—the relatives of a 
high-profile American citizen—because 
they can. Let’s not make the same mis-
take with Egypt that we made with 
Saudi Arabia. 
Egypt notices when we talk tough 
and do nothing, so does the rest of the 
world. And so withholding $300 million 
of their $1.3 billion until Egypt makes 
real concessions on reform, it won’t 
fundamentally harm U.S. interests in 
the Middle East. It will only make us 
more safe. 
It is the best opportunity for the 
Biden administration to show that we 
mean it when we say that the stakes in 
the fight between autocracy and de-
mocracy are sky high and that we are 
willing to do more than just talk about 
our values. America has the capacity 
to live them as well. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, it was 1 
week ago that the Senate held a proce-
dural vote on a bill that hadn’t even 
been written. And to no one’s surprise, 
it failed. 
Republicans, for our part, said it 
made no sense to advance to a more 
than $1 trillion infrastructure plan be-
fore knowing what was in the plan and 
how it would be paid for. 
Our Democratic colleagues argued 
that the big text was imminent, com-
ing any moment, any second, and it 
was critical to get the process started. 
Well, here we are, 1 week later. I 
guess the bill text wasn’t imminent be-
cause we still haven’t seen it yet. 
Earlier today, we heard that there 
was an agreement, I assume in prin-
ciple, on the major portions of the pro-
posed plan, which I concede is a major 
sign of progress. I want to commend all 
of our colleagues, including Senators 
PORTMAN, COLLINS, ROMNEY, and CAS-
SIDY, who have been working hard on 
our side of the aisle to achieve con-
sensus, and on the Democratic side, 
Senators like Senator MANCHIN
and 
SINEMA and others. 
But this infrastructure plan that we 
haven’t seen yet is no more ready for 
action today on the floor than it was 
last week. We made clear last week 
that we wanted to see the details be-
fore voting on a trillion-dollar bill that 
will impact every community across 
this country. 
Until this bill is actually written and 
we have a chance to review it, includ-
ing all the details, the costs, the pay- 
fors, and the impact it will have on our 
States, I will not support it. And I 
imagine the majority of my Republican 
colleagues feel the same way. 
Now, I say that also believing that it 
is important for us to get a bipartisan 
infrastructure bill. I actually want us 
to. But part of the challenge is these 
groups of gangs that operate outside of 
what we would call regular order here; 
that is, the committees of jurisdiction, 
where all Senators get to participate in 
the final product, including on the 
floor of the Senate, that is really not 
possible when you have a group—a 
small group, a subset of the Senate ne-
gotiating a deal among themselves, and 
then they present it to us as a fait 
accompli and say: You have to accept 
it. 
Well, it doesn’t work very well, ordi-
narily, but I am willing to give them a 
chance because I know they have com-
mitted a lot of time and effort into 
this. But it is going to depend on a cou-
ple of things. My vote, ultimately, is 
going to depend on a couple of things. 
First of all, we fund our highways, 
our roads, and bridges mainly through 
the gas tax. That is the amount of 
money that goes into the gallon of gas 
that is dedicated for the highway trust 
fund. Well, because our cars are getting 
more mileage now and because we are 
seeing alternatives, like electric vehi-
cles, the highway trust fund is simply 
inadequate to fund the demand of our 
infrastructure: roads and bridges and 
the like. 
But that is no excuse for us to get 
away from what has heretofore been a 
pay-for model or a user-fee model. In 
other words, infrastructure should be 
paid for by the people who use it, not 
people who don’t use it. And that is 
why the gas tax, at least as originally 
conceived, made a lot of sense. 
But we made a couple of mistakes. 
One, we didn’t index it to inflation. 
And, secondly, we just couldn’t ac-
count, back when the gas tax was 
adopted, for the innovation we have 
seen in transportation—natural gas- 
driven vehicles, electric vehicles, and 
the like—that pay nothing for our 
roads and infrastructure.

July 28, 2021 
And I think it is a very serious prob-
lem for us from a fiscal point of view to 
get away from the user-fee model. First 
of all, we know that we have had to 
spend a lot of money to fight the 
COVID–19 virus, to deal with the public 
health and the economic consequences 
associated with it. 
That is why we passed, I believe it 
was, a total of five bills last year alone 
on a bipartisan basis to defeat this 
virus. And you could tell from some of 
the face masks being worn here in the 
Chamber right now, we have not yet 
been able to defeat it finally, notwith-
standing the discovery and broad use of 
vaccines and other treatments. 
But an infrastructure bill is different 
than a pandemic because we actually 
should be in the position of paying for 
our spending rather than borrowing 
from future generations. 
I appreciate the good work that has 
been done by the bipartisan negoti-
ating group to try to come up with 
some 
credible 
pay-fors, 
but 
they 
haven’t been able to use the traditional 
user-fee model because President Biden 
and his administration took it off the 
bargaining table, which means you 
have to use other pay-fors outside of a 
user-fee model in order to pay for it or 
else you just merely add to our debt 
and pass on the responsibility to pay 
those bills back to future generations. 
Well, I don’t think any of this is news 
to the majority leader, who, once 
again, has scheduled a vote before we 
have a bill that we can actually read, 
discuss with our constituents. 
I, for example, would like to be able 
to discuss the contents of the bill with 
my friends at the Texas Department of 
Transportation and the Governor and 
other people who are very much en-
gaged in what the infrastructure in my 
State looks like, what it should be, and 
what we need in terms of investments 
in the future. But I can’t do that if the 
bill text hasn’t even been released yet, 
and the majority leader knows that. 
So the question I have is: Why in the 
world would the majority leader sched-
ule another vote before the bill is even 
released, before we can read it and con-
sult with our staff and outside experts, 
like my friends at the Texas Depart-
ment of Transportation? 
We have seen contradictory signs 
about what our Democratic colleagues 
really hope to do. When asked about 
the fate of the bipartisan infrastruc-
ture plan, the Democratic majority 
whip said talks have gone on long 
enough, and he would support rolling it 
into the Democrats’ reckless tax-and- 
spending bill that NANCY PELOSI said 
she would not pass in the House a bi-
partisan infrastructure bill unless, at 
the same time, she was able to pass 
what has nominally been called a $3.5 
trillion spending bill, but we know it is 
actually spending a whole lot more 
money than that. 
President Biden spilled the beans 
when this bipartisan group was at the 
White House a few weeks ago, where he 
said he would not sign the bipartisan 
bill into law unless, at the same time, 
he could sign the partisan, reckless 
tax-and-spending bill that is passed 
purely on a partisan basis. In other 
words, they are linked both by Speaker 
PELOSI and by President Biden. 
Now, President Biden did walk that 
back, or at least he tried to, but Speak-
er PELOSI has remained adamant that 
she will not pass any bipartisan infra-
structure bill in the House unless she 
can get the votes in the House and, pre-
sumably, in the Senate in order to put 
pressure on some of the Democrats who 
are resistant to seeing us continue to 
add to our national debt and fuel infla-
tion by more reckless spending, as well 
as the huge tax increases that would 
necessarily go along with it. 
So I am beginning to wonder if there 
was actually a sincere desire on the 
part of our Democratic leaders here in 
the Senate whether they actually 
wanted to pass a bipartisan bill or 
whether their goal was really to pass 
the 
reckless 
tax-and-spending-spree 
bill that Speaker PELOSI said had to 
pass if we were going to pass a bipar-
tisan bill. 
We also need to know whether Sen-
ator SCHUMER will honor requests for 
people who were not part of the negoti-
ating group, the gang—I guess they 
call themselves G–10 or G–20 or G–21— 
whatever they are called. But it is a 
subset of Senators who have been nego-
tiating the bill. The question is wheth-
er the majority will permit other Sen-
ators who are not part of that negoti-
ating group to offer amendments to the 
bill and whether they will permit us to 
have debate and votes on those amend-
ments because I didn’t delegate the re-
sponsibilities I have as a Senator, rep-
resenting 29 million Americans, to 
them to negotiate a bill for my State. 
That is my responsibility, and I insist 
on having a chance to read the bill, to 
consult with them, and to see what the 
impact is going to be on my State and 
to consult with my Governor and the 
head of the Texas Department of 
Transportation 
and 
others 
to 
see 
whether this is something they believe 
that earns my support and that Texas 
should support. 
None of this is mysterious. This is 
the normal way of doing business 
around here. Moving bills through com-
mittee, Democrats and Republicans get 
a chance to shape those bills in com-
mittee, and then the majority leader 
brings it to the floor, and then every-
body else gets to participate in the 
process. 
I hope in his rush to get this bill out 
the door, that the majority leader will 
allow a reasonable amendment process. 
This isn’t like the early days of the 
pandemic, when we were experiencing a 
global emergency. We need to deal with 
our infrastructure needs, but this isn’t 
emergency spending. This is part of the 
daily or annual bread and butter of 
what the legislative process should be 
about, and that is another reason why 
we shouldn’t pass a bill without re-
sponsible pay-fors. 
Well, we have seen this kind of polit-
ical maneuvering before. In fact, Sen-
ator SCHUMER’s designed-to-fail agenda 
practically dominated the work of this 
Chamber last month. He scheduled 
votes on some of the most controver-
sial bills out there in order to orches-
trate Republican opposition: legisla-
tion that exploits the cause of pay fair-
ness to line the pockets of trial law-
yers, a bill to seize States’ power to 
regulate their own elections, as pro-
vided for in the Constitution, and to 
cement the Democratic majorities in 
the Congress for the foreseeable future. 
And now the majority leader is 
threatening to tank an infrastructure 
bill so he can go on to another partisan 
tax-and-spending-spree 
bill, 
which 
makes me think that is really what 
they care the most about. Rather than 
give the negotiators time to succeed 
and the rest of us time to understand 
what is in the bill and to consult ap-
propriately with our constituents, Sen-
ator SCHUMER turned what should be a 
unifying process to build consensus 
into a divisive one, all in order to tee 
up his desire to see us pass a multitril-
lion-dollar tax-and-spending bill. That 
is on top of all the spending that we 
have done on a bipartisan basis for 
COVID–19, at least until the first part 
of this year, when our Democratic col-
leagues insisted on pushing through 
another 
$1.9 
trillion 
of 
unpaid-for 
spending, all in the name of COVID–19, 
when we all know that only about 10 
percent of it was addressed at the pan-
demic, which causes all of us to recall 
Rahm Emanuel’s famous statement 
that ‘‘an emergency is a terrible thing 
to waste.’’ And in the name of COVID– 
19 relief, another $1.9 trillion was added 
to our children and grandchildren’s 
debt burden. 
Well, for the reckless tax-and-spend-
ing bill that Speaker PELOSI so des-
perately wants, the pricetag has been 
put on that legislation at another $3.5 
trillion, and I don’t think most of us 
can really get our head around what a 
trillion is. It is more than a billion, we 
know. It is a whole lot more than a 
million. But this kind of reckless 
spending is really unprecedented, ex-
cept in a national emergency, like 
COVID–19 relief. 
Some budget experts have estimated 
that the reckless tax-and-spending- 
spree bill that Speaker PELOSI so des-
perately wants could actually cost $5.5 
trillion, and if our Democratic col-
leagues insist on rolling the bipartisan 
infrastructure bill into that plan, it 
will cost taxpayers even more. 
Well, as a reminder, our Democratic 
colleagues spent more than $2 trillion 
earlier this year alone, as I mentioned, 
and the result of this reckless spending 
spree speaks for itself. 
Democrats have sent big incentives 
to workers to remain at home, not 
back at work, through September of 
this year by enhancing their unemploy-
ment benefits with an additional Fed-
eral Government bonus, which provided 
that in my State about 80 percent of

the people collecting unemployment 
insurance were making more on unem-
ployment insurance than they were 
going back to work. So it is no wonder 
that we had trouble getting people 
back to work, and businesses had to 
cut back on their open hours. Res-
taurants had to close down because 
they simply couldn’t find the workers, 
or the businesses couldn’t compete 
with the Federal Government for these 
essential workers. 
We are a long way from reaching 
prepandemic 
unemployment 
rates. 
And, surprisingly, job openings are at 
record highs. 
But here is one of the biggest con-
cerns that is borne out by polling that 
people are beginning to have, and that 
is inflation. We are seeing inflation at 
a 13-year high. Consumers are feeling 
the sting of rising prices for virtually 
everything they buy. That is what hap-
pens when too much money chases too 
few goods and services. Prices go up. 
And we are seeing the cause of that in-
flation, its impact on gasoline, on gro-
ceries, and on appliances. Folks are 
shelling out more money for these 
products today than they have been as 
recently as a year ago. 
And if you have gone to the used car 
lot recently, you are bound for some 
serious sticker shock. And you can’t 
even get a new car because of the semi-
conductor shortage caused by the pan-
demic. But over the last year alone, 
used car prices have gone up an eye- 
popping 45 percent. 
As I said, there is another reason why 
new cars aren’t available, and that is 
because the semiconductors that make 
these computers on wheels actually 
run have not been available because 90 
percent of them are made overseas, in 
Asia. 
Now, we have taken an important 
step to try to deal with this vulnerable 
supply chain of semiconductors, which 
affects both our economy and our na-
tional security, when we passed the 
U.S. Innovation and Competition Act 
last month here in the Senate. So we 
are capable of doing things on a bipar-
tisan basis if given the opportunity. 
The Wall Street Journal recently 
called this bill, the Innovation and 
Competition Act, the ‘‘third infrastruc-
ture initiative’’ and noted that while 
smaller, it is ‘‘freighted with just as 
much long-term economic and stra-
tegic importance.’’ 
So as Congress debates infrastructure 
investments, we can’t let the one that 
passed the Senate last month slip 
through the cracks. There is a lot on 
the line for our economy and national 
security, and we need the CHIPS pro-
gram up and running, which is a $52 
billion investment in domestic manu-
facturing 
of 
advanced 
semiconduc-
tors—something that we rely on Asia 
for, and principally Taiwan, which pro-
duces 63 percent of advanced semi-
conductors. And we can only imagine if 
that supply chain from Taiwan or Asia 
was disrupted by another pandemic, a 
natural disaster, or, Heaven forbid, a 
military conflict. 
I want to make sure that our col-
leagues know that I appreciate the 
work they have put into this bill, but I 
know they also appreciate the indi-
vidual responsibility that we have as 
Senators to participate in the process, 
particularly when it comes to spending 
$1 trillion on infrastructure. 
We need to have the text of the bill, 
not just a summary. I appreciate our 
colleagues giving some of us a note-
book. It is a bipartisan infrastructure 
investment and jobs act summary. 
That is helpful, but that is not legisla-
tive text. And then we need an open 
amendment process so that those of us 
who weren’t party to the bipartisan ne-
gotiations can participate in the proc-
ess. Hopefully, it will make the bill 
better. I would like to see us actually 
substitute some of the spending pay- 
fors with a user-fee model that has 
been traditional, using the gas tax. As 
I said earlier, the gas tax has become a 
little outmoded and insufficient to pay 
for the infrastructure that we all want 
and need. 
There is a real need to invest in 
America’s infrastructure, and it has 
never been more important for us to 
actually pay for those investments in a 
responsible way. 
As it stands today, our debt-to-GDP 
ratio—gross domestic product—is at 
the highest level since World War II. 
This is not the time to continue spend-
ing and spending and spending until 
our grandkids are left sitting in a pit of 
debt so deep they will never climb out 
of it. 
I am encouraged that our colleagues 
have gotten us this far, but the bill is 
not ready, and we need to see the text 
and be given adequate time to read it 
and consult with our constituents 
about it and to satisfy ourselves that 
the summaries they provided us and 
the pay-fors are real. 
Senator SCHUMER would be wise to 
postpone today’s vote until Members 
on both sides have had a chance to 
evaluate the details of this legislation. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that at certain 
times during my remarks I be allowed 
to address the Senate in Spanish. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CUBA 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
rise today to urge leaders across the 
United States and governments around 
the world to stand in solidarity with 
the people of Cuba as they cry out for 
freedom—for ‘‘libertad’’—and for an 
end to decades of dictatorship. 
What is happening in Cuba today is 
nothing short of historic. Yes, we have 
seen protests take place in years past, 
but the demonstrations that began on 
July 11 stand apart. 
What began as one small pro-democ-
racy protest in San Antonio de los Ba 
os spread across the island in a matter 
of hours. Cubans from all walks of life 
took to the streets in a courageous call 
for democratic change. Among those 
clamoring for freedom were Afro-Cu-
bans demanding an end to discrimina-
tion and injustice, young people dream-
ing of a brighter future in their coun-
try, artists and activists from the San 
Isidro Movement singing ‘‘Patria y 
Vida’’ and ordinary citizens facing 
widespread food shortages, poor access 
to healthcare, and little to no protec-
tion from the ravages of COVID–19. 
The people of Cuba are crying out for 
freedom, and we must hear them. 
(English translation of the statement 
made in Spanish is as follows:) 
The Cuban people are asking for what is 
fair, which is freedom, and we must listen to 
their cry. 
This is not about politics or ideology. 
The free world has a responsibility to 
stand with those who are not yet free, 
and the people of Cuba are anything 
but free. 
Let’s dispel the myths about what 
life is under the Cuban regime. For dec-
ades, the regime’s ruthless and repres-
sive tactics have systemically silenced 
the Cuban people while party insiders 
and cronies enrich themselves at their 
expense. 
Today, Cuba remains a one-party 
communist state, where the basic prin-
ciples of political pluralism and rep-
resentative democracy are outlawed— 
outlawed. There are no free and fair 
elections in Cuba. Miguel Diaz-Canel 
may have appeared on a ballot, but 
there were no other candidates. He was 
not chosen by the people but hand-
picked by the Castros as their suc-
cessor. He has the same ideology. He 
says the same things. He talks about 
‘‘la continuation,’’ the continuation— 
continuation of oppression. 
There is no freedom of the press in 
Cuba. Independent journalists are rou-
tinely targeted with violence, harass-
ment, imprisonment, and raids on their 
homes and offices. 
There is no internet freedom in Cuba. 
The regime monitors online traffic, 
blocks sites, and charges so much 
money for data that most Cubans can-
not afford access. And when the regime 
gets scared about what the Cuban peo-
ple are saying and doing, they shut 
down the whole internet. Yes, they 
shut down the whole internet. The only 
reason a government shuts down the 
internet is because they fear their own 
people. 
But this has consequences. I recently 
had a Catholic priest visiting here in 
Washington from Cuba. He told me an 
incredibly powerful story. He said this 
young man came to see him in church 
and said: I would fight. I would give my 
life for the cause of freedom if only 
someone would know that I died. 
If only someone would know that I 
died. 
There is no freedom of expression in 
Cuba. Hundreds of activists, artists, 
and political dissidents are taken pris-
oner every year without due process. 
Others are beaten in the streets or ter-
minated from their jobs for daring to

express a contrary opinion. Cubans can 
even be imprisoned for the Orwellian 
offense 
of 
‘‘precriminal 
dangerous-
ness.’’ You heard me right, precriminal 
dangerousness. Let that sink in. The 
political police can arrest you if they 
decide you might commit a political 
crime in the future. 
Fortunately, the regime’s brutality 
has failed to extinguish the flame of 
liberty alive in the hearts of the Cuban 
people. Their courageous call for free-
dom is truly awe-inspiring. Yet the re-
gime responded to these protests—as 
all authoritarian governments do— 
with repression, with censorship, with 
violence. The regime’s internet outages 
tried to stop the Cuban people from 
using social media to open the eyes of 
the world to the repression and injus-
tice they live with each and every day. 
Yet it was too late. The truth went 
viral. 
Images 
of 
everyday 
Cubans 
chanting 
‘‘abajo 
la 
dictadura’’ 
or 
‘‘down with the dictatorship’’ and sing-
ing ‘‘Patria y Vida’’ or ‘‘Homeland and 
Life’’ spread around the world. 
And so did countless videos of the re-
gime’s violent crackdown. Make no 
mistake, the incitement of violence 
came from the very top itself. It was 
Miguel 
Diaz-Canel, 
ostensibly 
the 
President of Cuba, who encouraged sup-
porters to attack peaceful protesters, 
declaring in a televised address: ‘‘The 
order to fight has been given—into the 
streets,’’ and he pledged his supporters’ 
lives: ‘‘Over our dead bodies. We are 
prepared to do anything.’’ 
What leader of a country invokes the 
people of the country to turn against 
their brothers and sisters in the coun-
try in violence? Who does that? Diaz- 
Canel did that. 
The regime has confirmed just one 
death. Yet independent reports suggest 
additional lives were lost as well as nu-
merous cases of violence and even tor-
ture. I have seen many of the videos. 
We can’t show videos here on the Sen-
ate floor, but I tell you, if we could, it 
would be incredibly compelling and in-
credibly graphic and incredibly violent. 
International human rights groups 
believe that more than 500 people have 
likely been detained, most facing arbi-
trary charges. Likewise—don’t take 
my word for it—the U.N. High Commis-
sioner for Human Rights, Michelle 
Bachelet, expressed her concern about 
‘‘the 
excessive 
force 
against 
dem-
onstrators in Cuba and the arrest of a 
large number of people, including jour-
nalists. It is particularly worrying,’’ 
she said, ‘‘that these include individ-
uals allegedly held incommunicado and 
people whose whereabouts are un-
known.’’ 
And, in fact, we have seen many vid-
eos and many stories of families trying 
to find out, Where are their loved ones? 
Where are their loved ones? 
Already the regime is preparing sum-
mary trials for protesters that deny 
them access to legal representation, 
subject them to sham sentences, and 
make a mockery of due process. 
Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara, a lead-
er of the San Isidro Movement of art-
ists, known globally for their efforts to 
promote freedom of expression, has 
been jailed and charged with ‘‘resist-
ance’’ and ‘‘public disorder.’’ For what? 
For merely announcing on social media 
that he intended to join the peaceful 
protests—for merely announcing that 
he intended the join the peaceful pro-
tests. This artistic leader, this indi-
vidual, as one of the leaders of the San 
Isidro Movement, jailed. For what? For 
nothing. 
Jose Daniel Ferrer, head of the Patri-
otic Unit of Cuba, or UNPACU, is al-
ready behind bars. He is a renowned 
civil society leader who spent 8 years 
in prison for organizing an entirely 
legal electoral referendum under the 
existing Cuban constitution and was 
declared a ‘‘prisoner of conscience’’ by 
Amnesty International. 
The regime has also unjustly de-
tained multiple journalists for coura-
geously reporting on the events of July 
11, 
including 
Camilla 
Acosta, 
Luz 
Escobar, and Henry Constantin. Re-
gime security forces also violently as-
saulted Ramon Espinosa, a photog-
rapher for the Associated Press. 
Arrests have surged in recent days, 
but the politically motivated arrests 
have taken place throughout 2021. Rap-
per and Afro-Cuban artist Maykel 
Osorbo has been in prison since May. 
He is one of the artists featured in the 
protest’s 
anthem 
‘‘Patria 
y 
Vida. 
Patria y Vida.’’ Yes, in Cuba, you can 
be arrested for singing. 
Today’s protest movement builds on 
decades of efforts by Cuban patriots to 
advance the cause of freedom. 
(English translation of the statement 
made in Spanish is as follows:) 
In the decades of the Castro oppression, 
the Cuban people have never stopped looking 
for their freedom. Despite the little atten-
tion some heroes have received, they have 
made possible this moment in Cuban’s his-
tory. 
From the Patriotic Union of Cuba’s 
efforts to unite activists in support of 
democracy to Berta Soler and the in-
trepid leaders of the Ladies in White— 
these are the spouses, daughters, moth-
ers of political prisoners who repeat-
edly 
faced 
violence 
for 
attending 
church services and walking peacefully 
in white to Havana’s streets with a gla-
diola in their hands, beaten, beaten, for 
walking peacefully along the streets of 
Havana dressed in white with a gla-
diola in her hands; I was privileged to 
have Berta here at the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee—to the Christian 
Liberation Movement’s work exploit-
ing tools afforded by the regime’s own 
constitution to advance democratic 
change. 
This month marks 9 years since the 
movement’s leader, Oswaldo Paya, died 
in a suspicious car crash that has never 
been fully investigated due to the re-
gime’s obstruction. I believe he was as-
sassinated. 
Decade after decade, Cuban patriots 
have dedicated their lives and given 
their lives to the cause of democracy 
and freedom. They have struggled to 
rebuild communities and preserve val-
ues relentlessly attacked by Cuba’s 
Communist leaders. They have worked 
tirelessly to alleviate the hardships 
that forced hundreds of thousands of 
Cuban families to abandon their home-
land in search of opportunities abroad. 
The suffering that the Cuban regime 
inflicts on its own people extends be-
yond its borders. For over two decades, 
Cuba has provided military and intel-
ligence assistance to Venezuela’s dicta-
torship. It has exploited its repressive 
tactics from Havana to Caracas. It has 
shared its failed economic model with 
Venezuela’s kleptocrats. And it should 
be no surprise that Venezuela is now a 
failed state with a devastating humani-
tarian crisis. 
Cuba also provides safe haven to 
members of Colombia’s ELN guerrilla 
group, designated by the United States 
as a ‘‘foreign terrorist organization.’’ 
The regime continues to deny extra-
dition requests from the Colombian 
Government. 
In addition, Cuba has also harbored 
and still harbors American fugitives 
evading the U.S. justice system. They 
include Joanne Chesimard, who re-
mains on the FBI’s Most Wanted List 
for her role in the murder of New Jer-
sey State Trooper Werner Foerster; 
and William ‘‘Guillermo’’ Morales, a 
terrorist who took part in several 
bombings in the United States, includ-
ing Fraunces Tavern in Manhattan in 
1975. 
As it exports criminality and repres-
sion across the Americas, the Cuban re-
gime is a cancer that spreads insta-
bility across our hemisphere. 
Against this backdrop, the people of 
Cuba cry out for freedom, and I urge 
our partners in the international com-
munity to listen to their voices, hear 
their cries of desperation. 
(English translation of the statement 
made in Spanish is as follows:) 
It is time the international community lis-
tens to the Cuban people and act. Not only to 
say they’re sympathetic to their cause, but 
to take action. 
They want freedom from a system 
that denies them basic human rights 
and control over their own destiny. 
They want freedom from an economic 
model that places the interests of cor-
rupt 
party 
and 
military 
oligarchs 
above those of the people. 
But there is no freedom today in 
Cuba. There is no economic oppor-
tunity. There is no justice. The regime 
has turned a blind eye to reports docu-
menting a disturbing rise in femicide 
and violence against women. It con-
tinues to treat Afro-Cubans as second- 
class citizens unworthy of political rep-
resentation 
and 
opportunity, 
even 
while they are the leaders of the free-
dom movement inside of Cuba. 
And it continues to deploy Cuban 
doctors to foreign countries against 
their will and under conditions that 
meet the definition of human traf-
ficking. The regime sends Cuban doc-
tors abroad, takes away their pass-
ports, monitors their activities, threat-
ens retribution against their families,

all the while garnishing 75 percent of 
the wages that that country is paying 
for that doctor. These medical missions 
aren’t humanitarian aid; they are 
forced labor. 
The regime continues to engage in 
gross 
economic 
mismanagement. 
Money that could be spent caring for 
the sick or vaccinating people against 
COVID–19 instead goes to new hotels 
and tourist destinations. 
Despite the growing number of inter-
national companies there, Cuban work-
ers cannot be hired directly by those 
companies. So you own a hotel, like 
the Spaniards do, in Cuba. You don’t 
hire the worker directly; you go to the 
state employment agency, and they 
send you the worker. You pay the state 
employment agency, which means the 
regime, in dollars, and they pay the 
worker a fraction of what the regime is 
getting paid. They have no rights. If 
you have a problem with that em-
ployee, send him back to us, and we 
will send you someone else. Fire them 
at will. They have no rights. Cuban 
workers cannot be directly hired by 
them. Instead, they are contracted by 
state-owned employment agencies that 
garnish their wages and, ironically, 
deny them the right to organize out-
side of the Communist Party-con-
trolled union. 
As the Cuban people push for a new 
dawn in their country, a vibrant 
Cuban-American community here has 
never wavered in their support for 
their brothers and sisters on the island. 
They have worked tirelessly to support 
family members in Cuba to ensure 
their cries for help are heard around 
the world. In rallies and demonstra-
tions in my home State of New Jersey, 
in Florida, and, yes, here in Wash-
ington, Cuban Americans are standing 
with loved ones on the island and dias-
pora living around the world and call-
ing for an end to a system that has 
robbed generations of Cuban families of 
their dignity. 
For me, in my 30 years in Congress, 
this has been a constant struggle, from 
my days in the House of Representa-
tives, helping pass the Cuban Democ-
racy Act; to the tragic downing of the 
Brothers to the Rescue, civilians who 
were just flying over the Straits of 
Florida between Cuba and the United 
States, looking for those people who 
had taken to the to try to seek freedom 
and were shot down, which led to the 
LIBERTAD Act, otherwise known as 
Helms-Burton, which I helped write; 
from my visit to Guantanamo, our 
base, with former Congresspeople Lin-
coln 
Diaz-Balart 
and 
Ileana 
Ros- 
Lehtinen, where thousands of Cubans 
were being held at one time when the 
boatlifts were making their way to the 
United States and where we eventually 
brought them back to the United 
States; from presentations in Geneva, 
at the U.N. Human Rights Council, 
leading to a resolution there con-
demning the regime and here, as the 
chairman of the Senate Foreign Rela-
tions Committee, leading to a resolu-
tion, a bipartisan resolution—a bipar-
tisan 
resolution—that 
unanimously 
passed out of the Senate Foreign Rela-
tions Committee today; and so much 
more. So I marvel at some of my Cuban 
brothers and sisters with their insult-
ing remarks toward me. 
Since July 11, President Biden and 
Secretary Blinken have repeatedly spo-
ken in support of the Cuban people and 
made clear the United States stands 
with them in their call for freedom. 
More importantly, the administra-
tion is backing up its words with ac-
tion. Last week, President Biden in-
voked 
the 
Global 
Magnitsky 
Act, 
which is a law that we use, passed by 
the Congress of the United States, to 
sanction human rights violators across 
the globe. The President invoked the 
Global Magnitsky Act to sanction 
Cuban Defense Minister General Lopez 
Miera and the Black Berets SWAT unit 
for their violent and repressive actions 
against peaceful protesters. Secretary 
Blinken, the Secretary of State, has 
made clear the administration will 
continue to hold human rights abusers 
accountable. 
I urge the administration to consider 
additional Global Magnitsky designa-
tions and also to revoke the existing 
visas of senior Cuban officials. Such 
steps are greatly needed. 
With the Diaz-Canel regime wielding 
internet connectivity as a political 
weapon against its citizens, the admin-
istration is also pursuing ways to help 
Cubans gain unrestricted access to the 
internet. They need unfettered access 
to information. They need to be able to 
communicate with each other. They 
need to be able to tell each other what 
is happening in their country. They 
need to be able to organize peacefully 
to create change in their country, and 
we must accelerate our efforts to pro-
vide them with the tools they need to 
do so, whether that is satellite feeds, 
whether that is tethered global bal-
loons, whether that is a multiplicity of 
options. 
Because 
a 
beam 
can 
be 
jammed, we need to find a way to get 
the people of Cuba internet connection. 
The United States also must con-
tinue working with international part-
ners in support of democracy and 
human rights in Cuba. 
Last week, I was proud to lead a joint 
statement for the first time ever in 
support of the Cuban people with my 
counterparts who chair the Foreign Af-
fairs Committees of the United King-
dom, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Lat-
via, and Lithuania. This week, the For-
eign Ministers of 20 nations joined Sec-
retary Blinken to ‘‘condemn the mass 
arrests and detentions of protestors in 
Cuba and call on the government to re-
spect the universal rights and freedoms 
of the Cuban people.’’ Many of these 
countries have never ever expressed 
themselves 
in 
solidarity 
with 
the 
Cuban people. 
I am proud to see Secretary Blinken 
and the administration make that hap-
pen. I applaud those governments that 
joined Secretary Blinken, but I also 
note the absence of those, including 
Canada and Spain and the European 
Union. Does Spain care more about 
Spanish hotel investments than it does 
about the human rights of the Cuban 
people? 
(English translation of the statement 
made in Spanish is as follows:) 
Is it more important the business you con-
duct on the island than the freedom and de-
mocracy of the oppressed people? Do you 
care more about those investments? 
Does Canada place more priority on 
mining investments than it does on 
fundamental freedoms? I would hope 
not. 
These universal principles should 
unite all of us. 
The administration is also convening 
a working group to study options for 
the restoration of some remittances. 
For too long, the Cuban military’s eco-
nomic conglomerate has managed the 
remittances 
that 
Cuban 
Americans 
send their families on the island, using 
fees and currency conversion to enrich 
itself. The United States would never 
allow the Spanish, the Mexican, or the 
Argentine military to control the flow 
of remittances to their countries. It is 
time that we insist that Cuban Ameri-
cans be able to freely and directly sup-
port their loved ones. 
(English translation of the statement 
made in Spanish is as follows:) 
It’s only fair that the hard working Cuban 
American families can send money to their 
families instead of that money being used to 
enrich the elite of the Cuban Communist 
Party. 
The steps taken thus far by the Biden 
administration are important, but we 
must do more. 
Today, the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee approved my resolution, 
along with colleagues on both the Re-
publican and Democratic sides, ex-
pressing our solidarity with the Cuban 
people and condemning the regime’s 
abuses. This bipartisan, bicameral ini-
tiative deserves the support of the full 
Senate, and I hope we will pass it on 
the floor this week. 
It is also time for the Biden adminis-
tration to issue a new Executive order 
to provide direction for U.S. policy to-
ward Cuba. The order should hone our 
accountability measures for persons in-
volved in human rights abuses and 
those who materially support them. It 
should solidify our strategies on inter-
net access and support for the Cuban 
people. Congress should review options 
to increase funding for U.S. democracy 
programs as well as internet freedom 
initiatives. 
(English translation of the statement 
made in Spanish is as follows:) 
We must continue putting pressure on who 
violate human rights and elevate our support 
to the Cuban people. 
The United States must also find new 
ways to work with trusted, impartial 
international partners, including inter-
national organizations, to provide vac-
cines and other aid directly to the 
Cuban people. The Cuban regime has 
grossly mismanaged its pandemic re-
sponse. It has refused to participate in

COVAX and continues to promote its 
own vaccine, which is either ineffective 
or unavailable because people in Cuba 
are dying. As a result, everyday Cubans 
continue to suffer. 
The United States must lead a seri-
ous effort to push for the demilitariza-
tion of the Cuban economy. The mili-
tary-owned umbrella company GAESA 
reigns supreme over the Cuban econ-
omy. It is run by whom? By Raul Cas-
tro’s son-in-law, Luis Alberto Lopez- 
Callejas, fueling the rise of a new gen-
eration of regime oligarchs. The Cuban 
people will never achieve economic 
prosperity while regime military com-
panies control the economy. 
After years of efforts by the Trump 
administration to slash funding for 
programs that we continuously had to 
fight to bring back that provide life-
lines to Cuban activists and civil soci-
ety, I am very pleased to see that the 
Biden administration has requested $20 
million for these programs and made 
clear that America will continue stand-
ing with those on the frontlines of 
Cuba’s pro-democracy movement. 
It is time also for the United States 
to launch a campaign in support of 
labor rights inside of Cuba. There is no 
acceptable explanation for why Cuban 
men and women are unable to be di-
rectly hired and directly paid by inter-
national companies and organizations 
that are present in Cuba. If we are seri-
ous about empowering the Cuban peo-
ple, they must have a direct say in 
their livelihoods. 
The Biden administration should pur-
sue the success of past campaigns, such 
as the Sullivan Principles in South Af-
rica, to lead efforts that require busi-
nesses to engage directly with the 
Cuban people and their employment. 
The Biden administration should also 
maintain the State Department’s Cuba 
Restricted List, which can help busi-
nesses and organizations directly en-
gage with the Cuban people instead of 
regime conglomerates. 
Additionally, the United States and 
our allies must send a message to 
members of the Cuban military. The 
Cuban military’s slogan is that it 
draws its power from the people. Well, 
the people are protesting. In reality, 
you should not use your power against 
the people. 
(English translation of the statement 
made in Spanish is as follows:) 
The Cuban Army has to understand that if 
their mandate comes from the people, the 
people is protesting; the people wants free-
dom. Don’t use your arms against your 
brothers and sisters if you want to have a fu-
ture in Cuba. 
Additionally, let’s be clear. When we 
send that message to the Cuban mili-
tary not to turn its arms against its 
brothers and sisters, the world is 
watching what is happening in Cuba. 
There is a future in a democratic Cuba 
under civilian control for members of 
the military who refuse to repress their 
fellow citizens, but if you are involved 
in human rights abuses and have blood 
on your hands, you will be held ac-
countable. 
It is also worth noting to Cuba’s 
military leaders that their future with 
this regime is anything but certain. In 
the last 10 days—in the last 10 days— 
five Cuban generals have died under 
highly suspicious conditions that the 
regime seems intent on covering up. 
All of a sudden, five Cuban generals, in 
10 days, have died. I don’t know at this 
time that I would want to be a general 
in Cuba. 
To those who want to blame Cuba’s 
misery on the U.S. embargo, I would 
say that it is the Cuban regime that 
needs to lift its embargo on its own 
population. It is the regime’s own re-
strictive policies that have left the av-
erage Cuban destitute while oligarchs 
enjoy state-run stores that are brim-
ming with dollar-denominated goods 
out of reach to the general population. 
(English translation of the statement 
made in Spanish is as follows:) 
The real embargo is the one the com-
munist regime has imposed against its own 
people who are not able to access food, medi-
cine or basic needs without its consent. 
The steps to end the embargo are laid 
out clearly in title II of the LIBERTAD 
Act, which is the law of the United 
States, which I wrote. Those steps in-
clude releasing political prisoners, le-
galizing political activity, and holding 
democratic elections. 
If the regime ends its iron-fisted rule 
over the Cuban people, title II of the 
LIBERTAD Act lays out what the 
United States stands ready to do to 
pursue a different relationship with the 
people of Cuba. The United States 
would work directly with a democratic 
government to take steps to remove 
the embargo, to engage in direct trade 
with Cuba, to support its return and 
membership to international financial 
organizations, and so much more. It is 
all there in U.S. law. This is not a 
promise of something that could hap-
pen; it is a promise of what would hap-
pen if there is a change in Cuba. 
It is time for the Cuban regime to 
take the steps and accept the demands 
of the Cuban people. 
Let me close on a personal note. 
I stand here on the floor of the U.S. 
Senate as the son of Cuban refugees 
who came to this country in search of 
freedom and opportunity. 
Today, we are bearing witness to 
something in Cuba that my parents 
never got to see. 
(English translation of the statement 
made in Spanish is as follows:) 
The day they dreamt about is the day mil-
lions of Cubans around the world dream 
today, the day Cuba is set free. 
We are bearing witness to a historic 
moment in which Cubans from all 
walks of life are coming together to de-
mand that same freedom. We are bear-
ing witness to a deep discontent within 
the Cuban people with the status quo 
and life under one of the most repres-
sive regimes ever known. 
For more than 60 years, they have 
lived without liberty and justice, with-
out freedom of expression, without 
human rights and the ability to deter-
mine their own future. 
(English translation of the statement 
made in Spanish is as follows:) 
Don’t be fooled. When the people went out 
to protest, they are not asking for food, vac-
cines, or work. No. 
One word, and only one. Freedom, freedom, 
freedom. 
Freedom, because with freedom, ev-
erything else comes. 
Let us not repeat the mistakes of the 
past. Let us not fall victim to tired 
myths. Let us embrace the facts over 
the fiction. Most importantly, let us 
hear the Cuban people’s cries for free-
dom. 
It is our job to stand with them, to 
empower them, to ensure that the 
international community helps them 
achieve their dreams and aspirations. 
(English translation of the statement 
made in Spanish is as follows:) 
Because without freedom and democracy, 
there is no ‘‘Patria y Vida.’’ But with free-
dom and democracy, there is a homeland of 
life and many opportunities. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
SMITH). The Senator from Wyoming. 
THE ECONOMY 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today to oppose 
Democrats’ reckless tax-and-spending 
spree. 
If Democrats pass the bill, every 
American will end up paying more, and 
clearly pay more in taxes, also pay 
more for the costs that people are see-
ing today at home—goods, gas, gro-
ceries. These prices all continue to go 
up. 
First, let’s talk about taxes. This bill 
would be the largest tax increase in the 
history of the United States—actually, 
in the last half century. 
The bill raises taxes on small busi-
nesses, and that means higher prices on 
everyone and also fewer jobs. 
The bill raises taxes on farmers and 
ranchers, who will have a harder time 
in terms of passing down the family 
farm 
or 
ranch 
to 
their 
kids 
or 
grandkids. 
The bill raises taxes on savings and 
investments. So seniors will either 
have to work longer or retire with less. 
It includes trillions of dollars in tax 
increases, yet Democrats seem to be 
pandering to their elite donors. They 
made sure to include special exemp-
tions for rich people in blue States and 
for the owners of electric vehicles. 
Now a study from the University of 
California Berkeley—clearly not a con-
servative university—they say that 9 
out of 10 electric vehicle subsidies go to 
the rich—go to the rich. Nine out of 
ten, according to Berkeley, go to the 
rich. 
Democrats 
also 
would 
give 
tax 
breaks for people making up to $400,000 
a year for all sorts of things, including 
sending their kids to summer camp. 
Is that what the Democrats want to 
vote for: Tax breaks for people making 
up to $400,000 a year to send their kids 
to summer camp? 
Well, the contrast with Republicans 
could not be clearer. Where Democrats

S5136 
July 28, 2021 
are making more handouts for their 
friends, 
Republicans 
actually 
sim-
plified the Tax Code. Where Democrats’ 
increases are going to eliminate jobs, 
our tax cuts increased job growth, in-
creased employment, lowered unem-
ployment, raised wages. 
The 2017 tax cut was an across-the- 
board tax cut. It helped businesses and 
working families, and the result was 
the best economy in my lifetime. 
In the months after the tax cuts, 
nearly 200 companies—200 companies— 
announced raises for their employees. 
Six million American workers re-
ceived either a bonus or a raise or an 
increased retirement contribution—6 
million Americans after we passed that 
law. 
Now, before the pandemic, unemploy-
ment was at a 50-year low. Wages were 
growing at the fastest pace in a decade, 
and the biggest wage gains were for 
people at the bottom of the economic 
ladder. 
On average, American household in-
come rose by more than $4,000 a year. 
Well, this is more than the increase 
over the entire 8 years of the Obama- 
Biden administration. 
We had the lowest poverty rate in a 
half a century. Child poverty was 
down; income inequality went down. 
The top 1 percent’s share of taxes went 
up, so the richer folks were actually 
paying more in taxes. 
After Republicans cut taxes, we saw 
the lowest unemployment rates ever 
recorded for African Americans, for 
Hispanic Americans, and for Asian 
Americans. 
When we began to reopen the econ-
omy last year, it was the fastest recov-
ery in American history. That was be-
cause we had such a strong economy 
before the pandemic. 
What a contrast to what we have 
with the Democrats over the last 6 
months. Since Democrats took control 
of Washington, we have seen the fast-
est rise in core inflation in 40 years— 
the fastest rise in core inflation in 40 
years. 
And we have also seen the most un-
filled jobs in Americans history. The 
American people are already paying 
more at the grocery store, paying more 
at the gas station; now the American 
people are bracing for the fact that 
they are going to pay a lot more on tax 
day as well. 
Yet just as bad as the Democrats’ tax 
increases, on top of that, we see reck-
less spending. Democrats tell us the 
bill costs $3.5 trillion. This is nearly 
the cost of what America spent in 
World War II. Yet the bill is actually 
much more expensive than $3.5 trillion, 
because Democrats continue to use ac-
counting gimmicks to hide the real 
cost of the legislation. 
Last week, a nonpartisan group re-
leased a study showing the real cost is 
likely $5.5 trillion. This is on top of the 
$6 trillion we have already spent on 
coronavirus relief. Five and a half tril-
lion dollars is larger than the entire 
economy of Japan, which is the third 
largest economy in the world. 
This is clearly a recipe for inflation. 
So now Democrats are waving around a 
report from a single discredited econo-
mist who says: Oh, don’t worry about 
inflation. 
Well, the people in my home State of 
Wyoming are worried about inflation 
because they are living it. 
Now, this same economist has been 
wrong over and over and over again in 
his career. He predicted a recession 
under President Trump. Instead, we 
saw the best economy of our lifetime. 
He wasn’t even close. His work was an 
influence on President Obama’s stim-
ulus plan, which gave us the slowest re-
covery in 70 years. 
So hard to know why the Democrats 
would want to even turn to this person 
other than he is saying what they want 
him to say. 
Who are you going to believe? Him or 
your own two eyes? 
And the people of Wyoming believe 
their own two eyes when they go and 
fill up with gas or they go to the gro-
cery store or other stores and see their 
paycheck being eaten away. 
Now, Democrats now tell us they can 
spend their way out of inflation. Spend 
their way out of inflation? 
This isn’t just wishful thinking. This 
is radical. It is extreme. It is dan-
gerous. It is scary. Our economy 
doesn’t need a dime of stimulus. We 
don’t even need stimulus. We didn’t 
need it 4 months ago, when Democrats 
borrowed and spent an additional $2 
trillion. 
Prices are going up because Demo-
crats spent too much already. The 
money supply hasn’t gone up this fast 
since World War II. 
One Democrat Senator, this weekend, 
said inflation is happening because of 
money we have already spent. 
Well, if this is true, then why would 
we want to add fuel to the fire and 
spend more? Why would we want to do 
that? 
Democrats are printing more money 
without creating more goods and serv-
ices. So if you print more money with-
out creating more goods and services, 
this is almost a textbook definition of 
inflation. 
The two bills coming to the floor now 
would bring Democrats’ total for the 
year to $8 trillion in additional govern-
ment spending. 
According to an estimate from the 
Manhattan Institute, this is enough to 
give every American household $60,000; 
or it is enough to cut income taxes by 
one-third. 
Instead, Democrats are preparing 
more payoffs for their friends and do-
nors. This bill is a full giveaway to 
union bosses, trial lawyers, leftwing 
professors. It includes taxpayer funding 
for full-time professional climate ac-
tivists. It includes corporate welfare 
for connected companies. 
This tax-and-spending spree is ut-
terly reckless. Not one Republican will 
vote for this bill. This means all it 
takes is one Democrat in the Senate or 
a handful in the House to stop this 
freight train to socialism. All it takes 
is one Democrat concerned about our 
future, willing to say: We shouldn’t 
weigh down our children with debt or 
our economy with massive tax in-
creases. 
President Biden and the Democrat 
party are in charge of this runaway 
train. Each and every Democrat is 
going to be held responsible for the 
consequences. This includes more infla-
tion, more worker shortages, more 
debt, and more dependency. 
Look, Democrats did enough damage 
with their last spending spree. This 
new spending spree is much worse. 
Unlike their last spending spree, this 
bill includes massive tax increases. It 
is one more reason why the American 
people 
are 
already 
speaking 
out 
against this reckless tax-and-spending 
spree. 
People across the country and cer-
tainly home in Wyoming are fed up, 
and the poll numbers are showing it. 
Seventy-four percent of Americans—we 
are talking Republicans, Democrats, 
Independents—74 percent of Americans 
are concerned this spending spree will 
accelerate inflation; 78 percent are 
rightly concerned about their own 
wages going up at a time when—with 
their own taxes going up at a time 
when their wages have been getting 
eaten into by inflation. 
The people are going to remember 
how you vote on this bill. They are 
going to remember it. They remember 
it every time they go to the gas sta-
tion, every time they go to the grocery 
store, and they are clearly going to re-
member it when they go to vote. 
So election day will come, people will 
make their votes as citizens, and they 
will realize what the Democrats have 
done with this reckless tax-and-spend-
ing spree and how it has impacted 
them as they are paying more in taxes, 
having a greater national debt, and in-
flation eating away at their paycheck.

MOTION TO PROCEED 
The clerk will report the motion. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
Motion to proceed to H.R. 3684, a bill to au-
thorize funds for Federal-aid highways, high-
way safety programs, and transit programs, 
and for other purposes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I want 
to commend the group of Senators who 
worked with President Biden to reach 
an agreement on a bipartisan infra-
structure bill. The Senate has just 
come together and, in a strong bipar-
tisan fashion, voted to begin the legis-
lative process here on the Senate floor. 
For the past few months, I have laid 
out a two-track strategy on infrastruc-
ture: a bipartisan bill, focused on tradi-
tional, brick-and-mortar infrastructure 
projects, and a budget reconciliation 
bill, where Democrats plan to make 
historic investments in American jobs, 
American families, and efforts to fight 
climate change. 
In order to start work on a reconcili-
ation bill, the Senate must pass a 
budget resolution first. As I have said 
repeatedly, our goal was to pass both 
bills in this session—hopefully, in July. 
My goal remains to pass both the bi-
partisan infrastructure bill and a budg-
et resolution during this work period— 
both. 
It might take some long nights. It 
might eat into our weekends. But we 
are going to get the job done, and we 
are on track. 
Again, the vote tonight means we are 
on track to reach our two-track goal 
before the Senate adjourns for the Au-
gust recess.

TRIBUTE TO ROCKY AND LISA 
EADES 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise 
today in celebration of Rocky and Lisa 
Eades, the 2021 honorees of the Boys 
and Girls Clubs of Central Wyoming. 
Since 1978, the Boys and Girls Clubs 
of Central Wyoming has made a posi-
tive difference in the lives of children. 
Their mission is to inspire all youth, 
especially those who need them the 
most. They strive to help young people 
reach their full potential as productive, 
responsible, and caring citizens. The 
programs, leagues, and activities serve 
the children in our community by cul-
tivating academic success, healthy life-
styles, and good character and citizen-
ship. 
On September 8, 2021, the Boys and 
Girls Clubs of Central Wyoming will 
host their 23rd annual awards and rec-
ognition breakfast. At this breakfast,

the organization honors members of 
the community who have made a sig-
nificant difference in the lives of oth-
ers. It is an inspiring celebration. 
This year’s honorees are Rocky and 
Lisa Eades. They are an ideal choice 
because of their tremendous role in 
helping families. Their story of gen-
erosity and compassion is inspiring. 
Rocky and Lisa cofounded the Ja-
son’s Friends Foundation, a nonprofit 
organization based in Casper, WY. Ja-
son’s Friends provides financial and 
moral support to families with children 
fighting cancer. The couple took on 
this charge after experiencing first-
hand the hardships associated with 
childhood cancer. Their 8-year-old son 
Jason was diagnosed with a brain stem 
tumor in January 1995. 
Rocky and Lisa dedicated their all to 
Jason’s recovery. They upended their 
lives, traveling to Denver and New 
York for care and treatment. Jason’s 
brave fight ended in November 1995. To 
honor Jason’s life and help Wyoming 
families in similar situations, they 
founded Jason’s Friends Foundation in 
1996. 
Jason’s Friends has crafted an inspir-
ing legacy, providing over $5.8 million 
in financial assistance to families deal-
ing with the added stress and financial 
burden of a child with cancer. Cur-
rently, 145 families are enrolled in the 
program. The foundation helps cover 
nonmedical expenses such as travel and 
household bills. Their work allows fam-
ilies to fully commit to their fight 
against cancer. 
The Bowl for Jason’s Friends fund-
raiser, in its 23rd year, is a highly an-
ticipated event, drawing in the entire 
community. The foundation also hosts 
Camp Courage, a no-cost summer camp 
for childhood cancer patients and their 
families. 
Family is the highest priority for the 
Eades. In addition to Jason and the 
countless families they have helped 
throughout Wyoming, they have two 
grown daughters, Brooke and Skylar. 
Lisa serves as the volunteer president/ 
CEO of Jason’s Friends, cochairs the 
Wyoming Cancer Coalition, serves on 
the Wyoming Department of Health’s 
Institutional Review Board, and was 
appointed by then Governor Mead to 
the Wyoming Palliative Care Advisory 
Council. Rocky is the president of 
Eades Construction in Casper and has 
built hundreds of custom homes in 
Natrona County. 
Rocky and Lisa live a life of heart 
and perseverance. They are the first to 
offer a helping hand to those experi-
encing 
tremendous 
challenges. 
The 
Code of the West charges us to live 
each day with courage. Not only do 
Rocky and Lisa embody this principle, 
they give everyone around them the 
courage needed to do the same. Casper 
and Wyoming are fortunate to have 
them. 
It is with great honor that I recog-
nize these outstanding members of our 
Wyoming community. My wife Bobbi 
joins me in extending our congratula-
tions to Rocky and Lisa Eades upon 
their selection for this special award. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL 
SPRAYBERRY 
Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize the distinguished 
service of Michael ‘‘Mike’’ Sprayberry 
who will be retiring as director of 
North Carolina Emergency Manage-
ment on August 1, 2021. Every citizen of 
North Carolina is indebted to Mike for 
his tireless efforts over the last 16 
years to respond and rebuild following 
the countless disasters big and small 
that the State has faced. 
Since his appointment as deputy di-
rector for North Carolina Emergency 
Management in 2005 and subsequent 
elevation to director in 2013, his de-
partment has been called upon to re-
spond to 32 Federal emergency and dis-
aster declarations, ranging from hurri-
canes and tornadoes to fuel shortages 
and a global pandemic. Throughout his 
time, he has served under four Gov-
ernors and provided steady leadership 
to ensure that the State of North Caro-
lina is prepared to respond to any crisis 
at all times. 
While being charged with running 
emergency management operations for 
a large State is never easy, the last 5 
years would have been an insurmount-
able challenge to almost anyone except 
to Mike Sprayberry. In 2016, Hurricane 
Matthew slowly crawled up the south-
eastern coast bringing record setting 
rain across nearly half of the State. 
While many had termed Hurricane 
Matthew a once in a generation event, 
less than 2 years later Hurricane Flor-
ence stalled along the coast once again 
bringing historical rains. In some areas 
of southeastern North Carolina over 30 
inches of rain fell, cutting off Wil-
mington, NC, and other communities 
from 
the 
outside 
world 
for 
days. 
Through it all, Mike oversaw the res-
cue and sheltering of thousands of dis-
placed North Carolinians while also en-
suring that information continued to 
flow to Senator TILLIS, myself, and 
other Federal agencies to allow for bet-
ter federal coordination. 
While communities across the State 
are thankful for North Carolina Emer-
gency Management’s quick response at 
the height of the storms to rescue hun-
dreds trapped in their homes due to 
flood waters, Mike Sprayberry’s lasting 
legacy will be his dogged effort to re-
build North Carolina better and more 
resilient than before. Understanding 
that billions of Federal aid would be 
coming to support recovery, Mike ad-
vocated for the creation of the North 
Carolina Office of Recovery and Resil-
iency, including the establishment of 
the State’s chief resilience officer, one 
of the first such positions in the coun-
try. He is a fierce proponent of the de-
velopment of affordable housing and 
challenges his team daily to think 
about the long-term impacts they can 
make in storm preparation, storm re-
covery, and everything in between. 
Mike Sprayberry has lived a life of 
service first as a U.S. marine, then 25 
years in the North Carolina National 
Guard as a field artillery and infantry 
officer, and finally serving as director 
of North Carolina Emergency Manage-
ment. While he will be missed, his rep-
utation and the culture of preparedness 
he has built in the organization and 
across the State will live on.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO DARRELL HUETH 
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, today I 
have the distinct honor of recognizing 
Darrell Hueth of Valley County as 
Montanan of the Month for his devo-
tion to the Glasgow community and 
passion for Montana agriculture and 
education. 
Darrell has been a staple in Glasgow 
since his high school football and bas-
ketball days. He went on to become a 
star athlete for the Montana State 
University Bobcats from 1956–1959—‘‘Go 
Cats!’’ During his time at MSU, Darrell 
studied agriculture economics. 
Darrell brought his athletic experi-
ence and agriculture knowledge back 
to Glasgow a a teacher and coach. 
Under his leadership, the Scotties’ 
football team went undefeated for 2 
years and won three State champion-
ships. Darrell also led the Scotties’ 
wrestling team to three state cham-
pionships. When he wasn’t on the field 
or in the gym, Darrell taught consumer 
economic accounting and bookkeeping, 
a course that is crucial for the next 
generation of Montana ag leaders. 
Teachers serve an important role as 
they shape the minds of young Mon-
tanans and have the opportunity to in-
fluence the next generation and help 
prepare them for future careers. Mon-
tana has a rich legacy of agriculture, 
and it is our No. 1 economic driver. 
There is no doubt that Darrell’s pas-
sion for teaching about agriculture 
helped encourage young Montanans to 
pursue careers in this important field. 
His educational impact extends be-
yond the great State of Montana. As 
professor emeritus at the University of 
Maryland’s Department of Agricultural 
and Resource Economics, Darrell has 
had many academic articles, working 
papers and books published throughout 
his professional career. 
It is my honor to recognize Darrell 
for dedicating his life to education and 
making a positive impact on young 
Montanans through athletics and agri-
cultural studies. Keep up the great 
work, Darrell.∑

dreams by providing them with special-
ized prosthetics. 
A lifelong athlete, Noelle was re-
cruited to play Division 1 lacrosse at 
UMass Lowell. In her freshman year, 
Noelle was in a moped accident that 
severed her left leg. 
Noelle did not let this devastating 
accident stop her from finishing out 
her college lacrosse career. With the 
help of nonprofit organizations, Noelle 
received a specialized prosthetic for 
running that allowed her to continue 
competing. A specialized prosthetic 
like the one Noelle needs can cost up to 
$50,000 and is rarely covered by insur-
ance, so the help Noelle received from 
these charities was essential in her re-
turn to competition. 
Inspired by the nonprofits who helped 
her compete at an elite collegiate level 
and determined that others in need of 
prosthetics receive the help that they 
need, Noelle started her own nonprofit 
to help other children and young adult 
amputees. 
Already, the Born to Run Foundation 
has donated specialized prosthetics to 
14 individuals, including one as young 
as 4 years old. With the assistance of 
prosthetics provided by Born to Run, 
individuals have been able to run, 
weightlift, or simply take a walk on 
the beach again. 
If her work leading Born to Run 
wasn’t enough, Noelle is also a world- 
class athlete and national record hold-
er 
who 
qualified 
for 
the 
U.S. 
Paralympic Team and is competing at 
the Tokyo Paralympics in the 100- 
meter dash in the T63 division. 
Noelle’s grit, perseverance, and com-
passion for others represent the best of 
the Granite State. Her ability to turn a 
traumatic experience into an oppor-
tunity to help others is an inspiration 
to us all, and I am honored to recognize 
her.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. 
MERKLEY, Mr. BROWN, Mr. VAN 
HOLLEN, Ms. SMITH, Mr. BOOK-
ER, 
Mr. 
BLUMENTHAL, 
Mr. 
SCHATZ, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, Mr. 
WARNOCK, Mr. LEAHY, and Mr. 
WYDEN): 
S. 2508. A bill to amend the Truth in 
Lending Act to extend the consumer 
credit protections provided to members 
of the Armed Forces and their depend-
ents under title 10, United States Code, 
to all consumers; to the Committee on 
Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am 
reintroducing the Veterans and Con-
sumers Fair Credit Act (VCFCA) along 
with Senator MERKLEY, Senate Bank-
ing Committee Chairman BROWN, and 
many of my colleagues. This important 
legislation would extend the bipartisan 
Military Lending Act’s (MLA) protec-
tions for active-duty servicemembers 
and their families to all Americans by 
imposing a nationwide 36 percent cap 
on the annual percentage rate (APR) 
for most extensions of consumer credit. 
The MLA was enacted on a bipartisan 
basis in 2006 to rein in payday and 
other unscrupulous lenders that tar-
geted American troops with abusive 
and predatory loans. Unfortunately, 
the MLA does not protect veterans or 
Gold Star families from these exploita-
tive practices. Our servicemembers and 
their families should not lose impor-
tant consumer protections simply be-
cause they retire, separate from honor-
able service, or lose their loved ones. 
As such, our legislation would extend 
the MLA’ s protections to veterans and 
Gold Star families as well as ensure 
that all Americans are shielded from 
predatory loans. 
Hundreds of millions of American 
consumers could benefit from a 36 per-
cent APR cap. In states that do not 
have such a cap, predatory lenders are 
permitted to offer loans with triple- 
digit APRs that trap individuals in cy-
cles of debt. For instance, the Con-
sumer Financial Protection Bureau 
found that 80 percent of payday loans 
are rolled over or renewed within two 
weeks. This practice can cause bor-
rowers to pay more in fees than the 
amount of money they originally bor-
rowed, which is a sign of predatory 
lending and poor underwriting. 
According to a coalition of commu-
nity organizations, payday lenders are 
known to target the most vulnerable, 
including seniors, veterans, and low-in-
come borrowers. Many in these com-
munities were already struggling to 
make ends meet before the pandemic, 
and continuing to pay exorbitant APRs 
may cause them to fall deeper into eco-
nomic insecurity. This is why it’s im-
portant to extend strong protections 
against unscrupulous lenders to all 
Americans. 
The MLA’s successful track record 
demonstrates that providing for rea-
sonable, responsible limits on interest 
rates does not cut off consumers’ ac-
cess to credit. According to a May 2021 
report from the Department of Defense, 
‘‘credit cards, auto loans, and personal 
loans are widely available at risk-based 
rates under the 36 percent [military] 
APR’’ and ‘‘[s]ervice members continue 
to have ample access to necessary cred-
it.’’ 
Moreover, this legislation would fol-
low the trend in many states towards 
greater protections against predatory 
loans. Eighteen states and the District 
of Columbia have enacted APR caps of 
36% or lower for payday loans or 
banned them altogether. Lenders in 
these states have incentives to offer 
more affordable loans that borrowers 
have an ability to repay. The same in-
centives should apply across the na-
tion. 
I thank the bill’s supporters, includ-
ing the Consumer Federation of Amer-
ica, the National Consumer Law Center 
(on behalf of its low income clients), 
the Center for Responsible Lending, 
Americans for Financial Reform, Vet-
erans Education Success, the Military 
Officers Association of America, and 
the National Military Family Associa-
tion. 
I urge our colleagues to join us in 
supporting this important legislation.

Mr. RUBIO): 
S. 2509. A bill to authorize the New 
Partnerships Initiative to expand and 
diversify the partner base of the United 
States Agency for International Devel-
opment and to provide more entry 
points for organizations to work with 
USAID; to the Committee on Foreign 
Relations. 
Mr. 
KAINE. 
Mr. 
President. 
The 
United States Agency for International 
Development’s (USAID) New Partner-
ships Initiative (NPI) was formed to 
help small and local nonprofit organi-
zations partner with the agency on hu-
manitarian work, and was inspired in 
part by requests from Congress for 
USAID to cooperate more closely with 
these organizations. The program was 
founded on the principle that greater 
diversity and competition among the 
USAID partner base would lead to bet-
ter and more effective development

work. Since its creation, NPI has 
helped USAID expand its collaboration 
with local nonprofits to undertake crit-
ical work overseas, but this vital pro-
gram needs a clearly defined founda-
tion in statute and long-term author-
ization 
of 
funding 
to 
sustain 
its 
progress well beyond 2021. 
Today, I am pleased to introduce the 
New Partnerships Initiative Authoriza-
tion Act with Senator RUBIO. This leg-
islation would cement USAID’s com-
mitment to diversifying its nonprofit 
partner base by authorizing the pro-
gram and necessary funding through 
Fiscal Year 2026. Additionally, the New 
Partnerships Initiative Authorization 
Act would improve outcomes at the 
NPI program by outlining in statute 
core elements of the program, and re-
quiring the USAID Administrator to 
adhere to certain criteria regarding 
program management and nonprofit re-
cruitment. 
This bipartisan legislation is an op-
portunity to ensure that the New Part-
nerships Initiative continues to be an 
effective tool for diversifying USAID’s 
partner base through the inclusion of 
locally based and underutilized part-
ners. I look forward to working with 
USAID leadership and my colleagues 
on the Foreign Relations Committee to 
swiftly consider and implement the 
New Partnerships Initiative Authoriza-
tion Act. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
By Ms. CORTEZ MASTO (for her-
self and Mr. BOOZMAN): 
S. 2513. A bill to amend title 38, 
United States Code, to improve the ap-
plication and review process of the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs for cloth-
ing allowance claims submitted by vet-
erans, and for other purposes; to the 
Committee on Veterans’ Affairs. 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
I rise today to tell you about Brian 
Neuman, an Iraq combat veteran who 
was wounded while serving our Nation 
overseas in 2004. 
Brian has spent years working with 
the Wounded Warrior Project to help 
other veterans get the benefits that 
they need. 
Years after returning home, Brian 
applied for an annual clothing allow-
ance of $841. This allowance should be 
available to veterans like Brian when a 
medication or a medical device causes 
irregular wear or damage to their 
clothing. 
As many vets with service injuries 
will tell you, their clothes wear down 
much faster than other people’s, and 
the prosthetics can rip or tear clothes 
as well. Some veterans need tailoring 
to make clothing fit more comfortably 
around their injuries. Others have to 
treat skin conditions with creams that 
damage their clothes. 
These veterans get compensation for 
the expenses associated with their inju-
ries—and rightly so. Our veterans have 
given this country so much, and Con-
gress has a responsibility to hold up its 
end of the bargain, to care for them 
when they are injured during their 
service to our Nation. 
But right now, this benefit isn’t ac-
cessible for many veterans, and that is 
wrong, and we need to change it. 
In the case of the clothing allowance 
benefits, as Brian discovered, the VA 
currently requires veterans to be eval-
uated for this benefit in person, every 
year. One year, Brian physically went 
to a VA clinic to submit the clothing 
allowance application, and his request 
was denied because the VA had no 
record that he received a prosthetic at 
that specific clinic. At that point, like 
many vets, Brian gave up on the proc-
ess in frustration. 
That is just unacceptable. These are 
brave men and women who are living 
with severe burns or who wear pros-
thetic devices as a result of their serv-
ice. In many cases, the VA already 
knows these veterans have a medical 
condition that isn’t going to change 
year from year. 
And that didn’t make any sense to 
Brian, so he did something about it. He 
reached out to see if Congress could 
solve the problem. He did. He did it, he 
says, less for himself, but more for the 
many veterans in rural States, like 
mine in Nevada, who live hours away 
from the nearest VA. Brian knows that 
many of them are so worn out by the 
process of applying for what is owed 
them that they just give up. 
These men and women are tired of 
jumping through hoops to access their 
earned benefits. So why are we forcing 
them to navigate this complicated bu-
reaucracy? There are certainly places 
to cut costs, but this isn’t one of them. 
The Senate can fix this problem eas-
ily, and I have introduced a bipartisan 
bill to do just that. I am glad to be 
working across the aisle with my col-
league Senator BOOZMAN to support in-
jured and disabled veterans. Our bill 
makes it easier for them to get cloth-
ing that works for their specific needs. 
My legislation requires the VA to auto-
matically renew this clothing allow-
ance. Veterans can get it until they 
say they don’t need it anymore or until 
the VA’s records indicate that they 
don’t require it. This will make sure 
they aren’t forced to drive long dis-
tances to access a VA benefit they are 
owed. 
I am looking forward to moving this 
legislation through Congress so we can 
make life a little easier for the 40,000 
wounded warriors who currently re-
ceive this benefit and for the thousands 
more who qualify. There shouldn’t be 
any redtape stopping veterans from 
getting their benefits, so let’s pass this 
bill and fix this problem. 
I am going to continue to work in 
every way I can to make sure that vet-
erans in Nevada and across the country 
get the Federal resources they need.

resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee 
on 
Health, 
Education, 
Labor, and Pensions: 
S. RES. 325 
Whereas polycystic ovary syndrome (re-
ferred to in this preamble as ‘‘PCOS’’) is a 
common health problem among women and 
girls involving a hormonal imbalance; 
Whereas there is no universal definition of 
PCOS, but researchers estimate that be-
tween 5,000,000 and 10,000,000 women in the 
United States are affected by the condition; 
Whereas, according to a 2004 study, the an-
nual burden of PCOS in the United States is 
an estimated $4,360,000,000, and this figure 
pertains to only the reproductive years of 
women and does not consider the cost of 
other comorbidities, including obstetrical 
complications, or the cost of metabolic 
morbidities in post-menopause or adoles-
cence; 
Whereas PCOS can affect girls at the onset 
of puberty and throughout the remainder of 
their lives; 
Whereas the symptoms of PCOS include in-
fertility, irregular or absent menstrual peri-
ods, acne, weight gain, thinning of scalp 
hair, excessive facial and body hair growth, 
numerous small ovarian cysts, pelvic pain, 
and mental health problems; 
Whereas women with PCOS have higher 
rates of mental health disorders, including 
depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and 
eating disorders, and are at greater risk for 
suicide; 
Whereas adolescents with PCOS often are 
not diagnosed, and many have metabolic 
dysfunction and insulin resistance, which 
can lead to type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular 
disease, 
obstructive 
sleep 
apnea, 
non-
alcoholic 
fatty 
liver 
disease, 
and 
endometrial cancer at a young adult age; 
Whereas PCOS is the most common cause 
of female infertility; 
Whereas PCOS in pregnancy is associated 
with increased risk of gestational diabetes, 
preeclampsia, 
pregnancy-induced 
hyper-
tension, preterm delivery, cesarean delivery, 
miscarriage, and fetal and infant death; 
Whereas women with PCOS are at in-
creased risk of developing high blood pres-
sure, high cholesterol, stroke, and heart dis-
ease (the leading cause of death among 
women); 
Whereas women with PCOS have a more 
than 50 percent chance of developing type 2 
diabetes or prediabetes before the age of 40; 
Whereas women with PCOS may be at a 
higher risk for breast cancer and ovarian 
cancer, 
and 
their 
risk 
for 
developing 
endometrial cancer is 3 times higher than 
women who do not have PCOS; 
Whereas research has found genetic evi-
dence of a link between depression and 
PCOS;

traits, as evidenced by genetic correlations 
between PCOS and obesity, fasting insulin, 
type 2 diabetes, lipid levels, and coronary ar-
tery disease; 
Whereas adolescents with PCOS are at 
markedly increased risk for type 2 diabetes, 
fatty liver disease, and heart disease; 
Whereas PCOS negatively alters metabolic 
function independent of, but exacerbated by, 
an increased body mass index (BMI); 
Whereas an estimated 50 percent of women 
with PCOS are undiagnosed, and many re-
main undiagnosed until they experience fer-
tility difficulties or develop type 2 diabetes 
or other cardiometabolic disorders; 
Whereas the cause of PCOS is unknown, 
but researchers have found strong links to a 
genetic predisposition and significant insulin 
resistance, which affects up to 70 percent of 
women with PCOS; and 
Whereas there is no known cure for PCOS: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes polycystic ovary syndrome 
(referred to in this resolution as ‘‘PCOS’’) as 
a serious disorder that impacts many aspects 
of health, including cardiometabolic, repro-
ductive, and mental health, and quality of 
life; 
(2) expresses support for the designation of 
September 
2021 
as 
‘‘PCOS 
Awareness 
Month’’; 
(3) supports the goals and ideals of PCOS 
Awareness Month, which are— 
(A) to increase awareness of, and education 
about, 
PCOS 
and 
its 
connection 
to 
comorbidities, such as type 2 diabetes, 
endometrial cancer, cardiovascular disease, 
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and mental 
health disorders, among the general public, 
women, girls, and health care professionals; 
(B) to improve diagnosis and treatment of 
PCOS; 
(C) to disseminate information on diag-
nosis, treatment, and management of PCOS, 
including prevention of comorbidities such 
as type 2 diabetes, endometrial cancer, car-
diovascular disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver 
disease, and eating disorders; and 
(D) to improve quality of life and outcomes 
for women and girls with PCOS; 
(4) recognizes the need for further research, 
improved treatment and care options, and a 
cure for PCOS; 
(5) acknowledges the struggles affecting all 
women and girls afflicted with PCOS in the 
United States; 
(6) urges medical researchers and health 
care professionals to advance their under-
standing of PCOS to improve research, diag-
nosis, and treatment of PCOS for women and 
girls; and 
(7) encourages States, territories, and lo-
calities to support the goals and ideals of 
PCOS Awareness Month.

RESOLUTION 
326—COM-
MEMORATING THE 200TH ANNI-
VERSARY 
OF 
THE 
INDEPEND-
ENCE 
OF 
THE 
REPUBLIC 
OF 
PERU 
Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself, Mr. 
RUBIO, and Mr. KAINE) submitted the 
following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Foreign 
Relations: 
S. RES. 326 
Whereas July 2021 marks two centuries of 
Peru’s independence from Spain, an occasion 
also referred to as ‘‘Las Fiestas Patrias’’; 
Whereas Peru’s proclamation of independ-
ence in July 1821 marked a historical turning 
point at a time when countries in the hemi-
sphere were collectively on a quest for inde-
pendence and freedom; 
Whereas Peru’s Act of Independence was 
written by Manuel Pe´rez de Tudela—a promi-
nent Peruvian attorney and patriot—and 
took place in Lima on July 15, 1821; 
Whereas, on July 28, 1821, Jose´ Francisco 
de San Martı´n—an Argentine General who 
helped propel independence movements in 
the region and who played a pivotal role in 
Peru’s 
independence—proclaimed 
at 
the 
Plaza de Armas, ‘‘Since this moment, Peru is 
free and independent by the general will of 
the people and by justice of their cause that 
God defends. Long live the Homeland! Long 
live freedom! Long live independence!’’; 
Whereas the road to Peru’s independence 
consisted of a long and arduous process, ini-
tiated decades prior through the various 
uprisings of mestizo and indigenous popu-
lations who protested their oppression and 
sought to improve their rights and liveli-
hoods; 
Whereas Peru’s proclamation of independ-
ence marked the beginning of the people of 
Peru’s quest to establish a government com-
mitted to advancing the democratic rights 
and prosperity of its citizens; 
Whereas the United States established dip-
lomatic relations with Peru in 1827 and 
today both countries enjoy a strategic part-
nership based on shared democratic values 
and interests of democratic governance, the 
rule of law, security, economic prosperity, 
and human rights; 
Whereas the bonds of association and 
friendship between the peoples of the two 
countries have been strengthened by the 
large number of Peruvians who have mi-
grated to the United States where they make 
significant contributions to both the United 
States and Peru; and 
Whereas Peruvians and Peruvian-Ameri-
cans residing in the United States have en-
riched and added to the United States way of 
life in the social, economic, and political 
arenas, and Peru’s rich identity and heritage 
have become an integral part of the cultural 
tapestry of the United States: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) commemorates the 200th anniversary of 
the independence of Peru; 
(2) recognizes the historical significance of 
Peru’s independence in the Western Hemi-
sphere and reaffirms its commitment to sup-
porting the people of Peru in their quest for 
further development, stability, and pros-
perity; 
(3) expresses support for the principles of 
democratic governance to which the people 
of Peru are committed; and 
(4) celebrates the contributions that Peru-
vians and Peruvian Americans have made in 
the United States.

which was referred to the Committee

creased budget authority, outlays, or rev-
enue produced by the enactment of the bill

inserting ‘‘subparagraphs (a), (b), and (c)’’.

REMEMBERING MR. CALVIN 
LAMAR MCDONALD, JR. 
HON. MICHAEL GUEST 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 28, 2021 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, Calvin Lamar 
McDonald, Jr. was a distinguished Navy vet-
eran who was loved by everyone who had the 
pleasure of meeting him. Born in Meridian, 
MS, he graduated from Meridian High School 
during World War II, which motivated him to 
enlist in the United States Navy. He loved his 
country and was honorably discharged from 
the Navy twice. After his time in the Navy was 
completed, he graduated with an engineering 
degree from Mississippi State University. 
During his second enlistment into the Navy, 
Lamar was placed in Gulfport, MS. He hitch-
hiked home nearly every weekend to see his 
future wife, Betty Jean Speed. They married, 
moved home to Meridian, and raised three 
children together. 
It has been said that Lamar McDonald was 
the most popular man in the City of Meridian. 
Going out to eat or to the grocery store was 
no small task because he had friends to talk 
to everywhere he went. As much as the town 
loved him, he loved it right back. When the 
Civil Rights movement was underway, Lamar 
was on the City Council and received threats 
regularly. Despite this, he continued to act in 
the best interest of all citizens. In the 1990s, 
when Congress considered closing the Naval 
Air Station in Meridian, Lamar stood up once 
more and defended the community that he 
loved. He truly believed that every single per-
son was made in the image of God, and he 
treated people as such. 
For all the great stories of how Lamar cher-
ished his community, there are many more to 
share about how he loved his family. He was 
a great man, husband, father, grandfather, 
and friend who left a lasting impact on count-
less lives, not just in Mississippi, but every-
where he went. Lamar will be greatly missed 
by his family, friends, and community, but the 
positive impact he made on Meridian, our 
state, and Nation will not soon be forgotten.

HONORING THE LIFE OF CAROL 
MILLS 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 28, 2021 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Carol Mills. Carol passed 
away on July 20, 2021 after battle Lou 
Gehrig’s Disease (ALS). Carol was a mother, 
daughter, and dear friend. 
Carol was the daughter of hard-working par-
ents and was the first in her family to graduate 
from college. She graduated from the Univer-
sity of California, Riverside and earned a Juris 
Doctorate from the University of Pacific, 
McGeorge School of Law. 
In 1996, Carol was employed as a Lead Ap-
pellate Court Attorney to the Fifth District 
Court of Appeal. Before working with the 
court, Carol worked for five years in a branch 
of the U.S. Department of Justice. 
Carol was first elected to serve as a board 
trustee for Fresno Unified School District in 
2004. For 17 years, Carol served as trustee 
for Area 5. During her career, she was an ad-
vocate for student programs such as the Inter-
national Baccalaureate program, Career Tech-
nical Education, art, and athletics. During the 
coronavirus pandemic, Carol advocated for 
after-school programs to be made available to 
every student. 
Carol fought and served as an advocate for 
those with disabilities and served as a role 
model for those around the Central Valley. 
She was dedicated to her role and put her 
heart into every school policy and matter. 
Carol would give the board a historical view-
point on current systems and practices with 
Fresno Unified Schools and would frequently 
offer her knowledge on legal matters. Her 
commitment to serving others and making the 
District the best it could be will continued to be 
felt throughout the Valley. 
She was a member of the Delegate Assem-
bly for the California School Boards Associa-
tion and was an active member of the Fresno 
High Neighborhood Association. She is sur-
vived by her family, and her son, Sam. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life of Carol Mills. Her 
service and contributions to the Central Valley 
and the State of California will be missed. I 
join her family and friends in celebrating Car-
ol’s life.

HONORING THE CAREER AND AC-
COMPLISHMENTS 
OF 
DALE 
ZUCHLEWSKI 
HON. BRIAN HIGGINS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 28, 2021 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor the career and ac-
complishments of the Executive Director of the 
Homeless Alliance of Western New York, 
Councilman Dale Zuchlewski, for the long-last-
ing impact he’s sure to have had on many 
lives. 
Graduating from SUNY Buffalo State Col-
lege in 1977, Dale started his career as a leg-
islative aide for the Buffalo Common Council, 
eventually becoming a compliance monitor for 
the City of Buffalo. During his tenure as a 
compliance monitor, Dale worked to ensure 
that applicable federal laws and policies were 
followed, that women and minority workers 
were hired and treated fairly, and much more. 
In 1991, he was elected to the Buffalo Com-
mon Council, serving four terms. During his 
time on the Council, he chaired the Commu-
nity Development and Education Committees, 
and was instrumental in kickstarting the revi-
talization of Elmwood Avenue in Buffalo. In 
2000, Councilman Zuchlewski became a 
project manager for the City, working exten-
sively with nonprofit organizations and the fed-
eral government to secure grants for helping 
the homeless and otherwise disadvantaged 
populations of Buffalo. 
In late 2010, Dale became the Executive Di-
rector for the Homeless Alliance of Western 
New York. I’ve had the pleasure of working 
with Mr. Zuchlewski extensively during my 
time in Congress and have thankfully been 
successful in directing federal funds towards 
the organizations dedicated towards alleviating 
homelessness in Western New York. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
join me in thanking Mr. Dale Zuchlewski for 
his dedicated service towards those less fortu-
nate, the Buffalo area, and the greater West-
ern New York Community.

RECOGNIZING THE BICENTENNIAL 
OF THE TOWN OF CLYMER, NEW 
YORK 
HON. TOM REED 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 28, 2021 
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, today I rise to 
recognize the bicentennial of the Town of 
Clymer and congratulate the town for reaching 
this milestone. 
The Town of Clymer is a tight-knit, well-es-
tablished community nestled in Chautauqua 
County with a rich and vibrant history. Clymer 
was formed from the mother town of Chau-
tauqua and was organized on February 9, 
1821. The town also has deeper roots, as far 
back as the founding fathers of our Nation. 
The town’s name shows the patriotic spirit of 
the early settlers as it bears the name of one 
of the signers of the Declaration of Independ-
ence, George Clymer. 
During the time when it was founded, the 
town consisted of twelve families. The commu-
nity has grown since then, but the small-town 
charm has not faded. Farming and agriculture 
remain a staple industry, including dairy farm-
ing and poultry farming. Neckers Company 
General Store has been located in the main 
intersection in town since 1910 as a fourth- 
generation family-owned business. 
The people of Clymer have continued the 
legacy of community, kindness and together-
ness that have bound the town together now 
for two-hundred years. We applaud their ef-
forts toward cultivating, celebrating, and con-
tinuing their traditions of small-town living in 
such a prolific way. 
Given the above, I ask that this Legislative 
Body pause in its deliberations and join me to 
recognize the bicentennial of the Town of 
Clymer and congratulate the town for reaching 
this milestone. 
RECOGNIZING THE 150TH ANNIVER-
SARY 
OF 
THE 
FOUNDING 
OF 
LONGMONT, COLORADO 
HON. KEN BUCK 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 28, 2021 
Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
commemorate the 150th anniversary of the 
founding of Longmont, Colorado. 
In 1870, a group of Chicagoans established 
a new settlement in northern Colorado. Calling 
themselves the Colorado-Chicago Colony, the 
new settlers sold memberships in their adven-
turous enterprise, using those funds to finance 
the construction of a town hall and the pur-
chase of 60,000 acres of land for their new 
town. By mid-1871; the settlers had decided 
on a name for their town—Longmont, after the 
nearby Longs Peak. Since then, immigrants 
from around the world have flocked to 
Longmont. 
Longmont has thrived amid rapid population 
growth and the arrival and expansion of both 
its agricultural and technological industries. 
Today, more than 94,000 individuals call 
Longmont home. Not only is the city full of his-
tory, but it remains a popular place to live. 
With many major STEM employers, miles of 
recreational trails, a thriving dining and bev-
erage scene, and stunning views of Longs 
Peak, Longmont has been ranked by numer-
ous publications as one of the top cities in the 
United States. 
On behalf of the 4th Congressional District 
of Colorado, I am honored to celebrate this 
special occasion alongside the tens of thou-
sands of my constituents who call Longmont 
home.

SPEECH OF 
HON. PATRICK T. McHENRY 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 27, 2021 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
strong opposition to the $6 million appro-
priated in Division D of this bill that will be 
used to carry out postal banking pilot projects 
across the country. Let’s be clear, imple-
menting postal banking is one of progressives’ 
top priorities. 
In 2018, the previous Administration created 
a special task force to specifically review the 
Post Office and identify necessary reforms. 
The Treasury Department was directed to re-
lease the Task Force’s recommendations, 
which it did in its report, ‘‘United States Postal 
Service: A Sustainable Path Forward.’’ 
The Task Force’s recommendations were 
clear: ‘‘given the USPS’s narrow expertise and 
capital limitations, USPS should not pursue 
expanding into new sectors, such as postal 
banking, the USPS does not have a dem-
onstrated competency or comparative advan-
tage, or where balance sheet risk would be 
added.’’ 
The Post Office agreed. In response to a 
widely criticized and highly unusual report by 
the United States Postal Service Office of In-
spector General (OIG), the Post Office made 
clear that despite any recommendations to the 
contrary from the OIG, the Post Office core 
mission ‘‘is delivery, not banking.’’ Postmaster 
General DeJoy reiterated this position earlier 
this year. 
The Task Force said no. The Post Office 
said no. Yet progressives want it. 
Why? Postal banking is one step closer to 
overhauling our banking system. It’s one step 
closer to creating a public bank option. It’s one 
step closer to the federal government knowing 
everything about a consumer’s financial his-
tory—from each credit card transaction to 
each deposit and withdrawal. Big brother will 
be watching you. 
Not to mention this would stifle private sec-
tor innovation by banks and fintech firms that 
have already shown promise for reaching 
underbanked and rural consumers. 
Progressives argue postal banking is need-
ed to address the decreasing number of bank 
branches and the rise in the number of people 
without access to a checking account or short- 
term credit. Democrats automatically believe 
that means that the government should pro-
vide these banking services, including through 
the Post Office. 
What Democrats fail to acknowledge is 
branch closures and consolidations result from 
overly burdensome government regulation. It 
can’t be solved with more government. 
Postal banking has been tried before. From 
1911 to 1967, the United States had the 
‘‘Postal Savings System,’’ run by the USPS’ 
predecessor. The system provided savings ac-
counts with interest rates set by the USPS 
and funds deposited in national banks near 
depositors post office. The system failed. 
Postal banking couldn’t compete with private 
sector banking institutions. It did not have the 
flexibility to meet the needs of customers. 
Private sector financial institutions are highly 
regulated and operate competitively and flexi-
bly in a market-based system. The ensures 
consumers’ demands for financial products 
and services are met, and they receive the 
best pricing for them. 
Postal banking is harmful to the financial 
system and ultimately harmful to consumers. It 
will crowd out private sector financial innova-
tion and ultimately fail to reach the very under-
served communities Democrats claim they 
want to reach.

IN HONOR OF MICHAEL JOSEPH 
REED 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 28, 2021 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, it 
is with deep gratitude and great admiration 
that I rise today to honor and commend an ex-
traordinary public servant, husband, and friend 
of long standing, Mr. Michael Joseph Reed. 
Michael, my Chief of Staff and Senior Policy 
Advisor, will be retiring from federal public 
service effective August 3, 2021. He will leave 
behind a stellar career and a void in my office 
that will be hard to fill. A retirement reception 
will be held for him at 5:00 p.m. on July 28, 
2021 in Washington, D.C., attended by numer-
ous friends, family, colleagues, and others 
with whom his life and career have inter-
sected. 
Michael Joseph Reed is a native of Buffalo, 
N.Y. He earned his Bachelor’s degree in Busi-
ness Administration from Oakwood College in 
Huntsville, Alabama. He also earned a Mas-
ter’s degree in Urban and Regional Planning 
from Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee. 
Michael’s career in public service began as 
a Presidential Management Intern (PMI) at the 
U.S. Department of Transportation, Office of 
Budget Policy. This experience led him to his 
first Capitol Hill position as an intern for former 
Congressman Louis Stokes of Ohio, who was 
a member of the House Appropriations Com-
mittee. After leaving Congressman Stokes, he 
joined the staff of Congressman William Gray, 
Chairman of the House Budget Committee 
and a member of the Appropriations Com-
mittee, as Legislative Director. 
After leaving Congressman Gray’s office, he 
was Vice-President for Marketing at the United 
Negro College Fund. He was also the Director 
of Regional Card Marketing and Vice-Presi-
dent for Government Affairs for the American 
Express Company. 
In 2003, when I was selected to serve on 
the House Appropriations Committee and was 
searching for a seasoned Appropriations Spe-
cialist and Legislative Policy Advisor, I was 
blessed to hire Michael as my Special Assist-
ant for the Appropriations Committee. He 
served in that capacity for twelve (12) years 
until he was appointed Deputy Chief of Staff in 
2011 and Chief of Staff in 2015. 
For eighteen (18) years, I have been matric-
ulating in ‘‘The Michael Reed School of Budg-
etary Policy.’’ He has been a master teacher 
of the process and its nuances. While he ini-
tially had no working knowledge of agriculture 
issues, he worked hard to learn these issues 
and used his skills to help my growth and ef-
fectiveness in the Agriculture Subcommittee of 
Appropriations and facilitate my securing the 
Chairmanship. Michael drove the Congres-
sional response in the form of agriculture dis-
aster relief over the past three (3) years to in-
clude typhoons, volcanic eruptions, wildfires, 
hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, droughts, and 
other exigencies. Georgia and American Agri-
culture were able to get relief because of his 
significant work. Georgia agriculture producers 
and rural communities benefited mightily from 
his efforts. Michael led my staff with great 
aplomb. He never told me only what I wanted 
to hear but always told me what I needed to 
hear. Because of him, we have been able to 
serve the people better. 
Former Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm 
once said, ‘‘Service is the rent we pay for the 
space we occupy on this earth.’’ Michael has 
paid his rent and paid it well. 
Having served in the public sector, cor-
porate sector, and the nonprofit sector, he has 
truly made a difference. But none of this would 
have been possible without the grace of God, 
the love and support of his loving wife, Attor-
ney Diane Fields Reed, his father-in-law, 
Judge Richard Fields, and their beloved dog, 
Alexandra. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues here 
in the House of Representatives, to join my 
wife, Vivian and me, along with our entire 
Congressional staff, past and present, and the 
730,000 residents of the Second Congres-
sional District of Georgia in honoring and com-
mending Mr. Michael Joseph Reed on his out-
standing career and upon the occasion of his 
retirement. We wish him well as he begins a 
new chapter in his life.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
CAREER 
OF 
NARDIN ACADEMY ART TEACHER 
GAILE AMIGONE 
HON. BRIAN HIGGINS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 28, 2021 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize the retirement of 
Gaile Amigone. Gaile has been an art teacher 
at Nardin Academy Elementary in Buffalo 
since 1993. Her 30-year tenure has left an in-
delible imprint on Nardin Academy. 
A 1975 graduate of SUNY Buffalo State 
College, Gaile spent much of her career 
teaching 
elementary 
art 
to 
kindergarten 
through eighth grade students. As a result of 
her encouragement to develop their creativity 
and talent, many of her students have gone 
on to study art at the high school and college 
level. 
Aside from her classroom duties, Gaile was 
actively involved in the school community. She 
served as the director for yearly theatre pro-
ductions presented to the Nardin Community 
and their families. She also dedicated her time 
to conducting After School Art Enrichment 
Programs for students who were interested in 
additional studio art immersion and instruction. 
Gaile routinely welcomed her former stu-
dents back into her classroom where they 
shared their growth and development with her, 
as 
well 
as 
their 
appreciation 
for 
her 
foundational role in their success as artists. It 
is clear that she has made a significant impact 
on many students’ talents, creative abilities, 
and passion for the arts. 
Wife of attorney Nicholas P. Amigone III, 
mother of three sons, and grandmother to nine 
grandchildren, Gaile is retiring with a legacy of 
dedication to the artistic and cultural enrich-
ment of young minds. 
I ask that my colleagues join me in thanking 
Mrs. Gaile Amigone for her service to the 
Nardin Academy community and the positive 
impact she has had on generations of Nardin 
students.

HONORING THE LIFE OF JOHN 
‘‘JAY’’ KALPAKOFF 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 28, 2021 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of John ‘‘Jay’’ Kalpakoff. Jay 
passed away on June 16, 2021. Jay was a 
selfless husband, father, grandfather, and 
friend. 
Jay was born on November 8, 1948 in Los 
Angeles, California where he was raised. He 
became a third-generation garbage collector, 
as part owner of Metropolitan Waste. Jay was 
a boss who enjoyed helping his employees 
through sponsoring many local sports teams 
and would help with scholarships to encour-
age continuing education. 
When Jay decided to move to the Central 
Valley with just one truck, he had a dream. 
Jay hoped to one day own his own garbage 
collection company. Through dedication and 
perseverance his goal was achieved, and Mid 
Valley Disposal was established. His dream 
was to have the ability to continue to give 
back to his community. Jay cherished his busi-
ness and was an integral part of its day to day 
operations. Jay treated all his employees like 
his own family, and he cherished each of the 
local communities that his company served. 
Jay was known for having a huge heart and 
always giving back to others, whether through 
this philanthropy or just lending a helping 
hand. He lived to see the community around 
him thrive and it was apparent as he gave 
back to local charities and food banks, to 
name a few. He made friends everywhere he 
went and loved to tell stories. 
Jay was truly an inspiration and he moved 
many with his wisdom, character and humor. 
But the most important thing to him, was his 
family. He is survived by his loving wife of 53 
years, Natalie; children Joshua, Jonathan, Jo-
seph, Tatiana, Justin; his daughter-in-law 
Wendy and his grandchildren Harrison, Remy 
and Cash. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life of John ‘‘Jay’’ 
Kalpakoff. He will be greatly missed by all who 
knew him. I join his family and friends in hon-
oring and celebrating his life.

brilliant mind, a vast well of patience, and 
boundless compassion. He spent most of his 
30-year career with the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration and served most 
recently as the Director of NOAA’s Budget Of-

NOAA’s mission. Through it all, Chris was 
unfailingly kind and humble. His gentle leader-
ship inspired his team—and those around 
him—to be better people, leaders, and public 
servants. 
Chris was a proud graduate of Syracuse 
University’s Maxwell School of Citizenship and

SPEECH OF 
HON. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 27, 2021 
Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of 
my amendment number 131 to En Bloc 5 of 
H.R. 4502. 
My amendment to the Financial Services 
and General Government division addresses 
the lack of transparency for applicants and re-
cipients of the Paycheck Protection Program 
(PPP), Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL), 
Shuttered Venue Operators Grant (SVOG), 
and other critical SBA programs. 
These SBA loans saved thousands of jobs 
and stopped businesses from shuttering their 
doors throughout this crippling pandemic. 
But all too often, I hear from my constituents 
that they have been left in the dark as they try 
to access and apply for these programs. 
Currently, the loan application process does 
not allow constituents to view the status of 
their application. 
Especially in such a challenging year, the 
last thing small business owners need is con-
fusion and uncertainty. 
My office was able to step in and help hun-
dreds of constituents access their cash, but 
the lack of transparency and access to real- 
time updates on their status from the SBA 
slowed the process down. 
This amendment will help cut through red 
tape and get folks the money they need to 
keep their doors open and their employees on 
payroll. 
As we look ahead and work toward con-
tinuing our economic recovery, it’s time to 
bring the SBA into the 21st Century. 
We created these SBA programs to support 
Americans in their greatest time of need. This 
amendment will continue to respond to the di-
rect needs of small businesses in the Hudson 
Valley and in every district across the Nation. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in support 
of this amendment.

HONORING 
THE

OF 
NYPD 
SERGEANT MICHAEL ST. CHRIS-
TOPHER FULLER 
HON. NICOLE MALLIOTAKIS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 28, 2021 
Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Sergeant Michael St. 
Christopher Fuller. Sergeant Fuller was born 
on the island of Jamaica and immigrated to 
the United States with the dream of becoming 
a police officer. That dream became a reality 
in 1995 when he graduated from the police 
academy at the age of 33 years old, Over the 
course of his career, Sergeant Michael S. 
Fuller served in the following posts and units: 
The 13th Precinct located in the Southern por-
tion of Midtown Manhattan, the Cabaret Unit 
which focused on vice crimes, the 94th Pre-
cinct located in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, The In-
spections Unit, The Chief of Patrols Office, 
Manhattan South Task Force, and Manhattan 
South Evidence Collection. 
On September 11, 2001, Sergeant Fuller 
was enjoying a day off from work when he re-
ceived the news about the terror attacks that 
were occurring across the nation. He imme-
diately changed into his uniform, picked up his 
children from school, and jumped into a police 
van to respond to the attacks in Lower Man-
hattan. His heroic actions of that day and the 
rescue/recovery mission over the following 
weeks would prove to be fatal as he was diag-
nosed with Pancreatic Cancer due to his serv-
ice on December 31, 2019. Despite being di-
agnosed with a deadly form of cancer, Ser-
geant Fuller continued to be positive and was 
steadfast in his decision to respond to the at-
tacks on September 11, 2001. 
In the 90’s, Sergeant Fuller received an FBI 
Commendation for aiding in the rescue of a 
kidnapped girl by recognizing the vehicle 
which the girl had last been seen in while he 
was on duty. 
Sergeant Fuller was a decorated law en-
forcement officer who served proudly for twen-
ty years receiving a ‘‘Good-guy Letter’’ upon 
retirement in 2015. He had never received a 
command discipline or had disciplinary actions 
taken against him. 
Sergeant Fuller is survived by his loving 
wife Sunni Beth Fuller, loving son Jesse Ethan 
Fuller, and loving daughter Becky Cara Fuller. 
He will always be remembered as a hero, a 
fantastic father, a man dedicated to his work, 
and a proud immigrant who lived out his 
American dream as he was always so proud 
to call himself an American. 
Sergeant Fuller’s end of watch has come, 
but he has served faithfully, proudly, and with-
out hesitation. His family and friends are for-
ever grateful for his love and dedication. May 
he rest peacefully.

HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA

Wednesday, July 28, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to congratulate Colonel Greg-
ory Gibbons on his appointment to command 
the Letterkenny Army Depot. 
A New York native, Colonel Gibbons is a 
graduate of the Army War College, where he 
received a Master’s in Strategic Studies. 
His first military assignment was in 1997 as 
a platoon leader, and later executive officer of 
A Company, 123rd Main Support Battalion, 1st 
Armored Division, Germany. Upon completing 
his tour in Germany, Colonel Gibbons served 
at multiple posts, including Okinawa, Japan 
with the Special Operations Command, and in 
Istanbul, Turkey with the NATO Rapid Deploy-
ment Corps. 
During his career, Colonel Gibbons has de-
ployed to areas of critical interest for our na-
tional security around the globe including, 
Bosnia, Iraq, and Afghanistan. 
Throughout his time in the Army, Colonel 
Gibbons has led the soldiers under his com-
mand with honor and distinction. He is a re-
cipient of the Bronze Star with Oak leaf cluster 
and has qualified as an Army Ranger after 
completing the grueling eight-week leadership 
course to earn his Ranger Tab. 
I am grateful for Colonel Gibbons’ service to 
defend our nation. On behalf of the people of 
Pennsylvania’s 13th Congressional District, I 
congratulate Colonel Gibbons on his appoint-
ment to lead the Letterkenny Depot, and I 
wish him, and the soldiers stationed at

to the community. While their name has 
changed over the years, the organization’s im-
pact has never been more important to Chau-
tauqua County. 
CBA Vision Rehabilitation Services provides 
a variety of vital services to the community, in-
cluding vision screenings for children, vision 
rehabilitation services, and orientation and mo-
bility services. The organization also engages 
in advocacy and education services to spread 
awareness. These services are all built around 
CBA Vision Rehabilitation Services’ mission— 
‘‘To enable visually impaired people to be ac-
tive members of their community, and to pro-
vide education and services to prevent vision 
loss.’’ 
Without these services, many residents in 
Chautauqua County would greatly feel the im-
pact. We appreciate the hard work and dedi-
cation the staff at CBA Vision Rehabilitation 
Services put into their work each day and are 
proud to join in the celebration of this wonder-
ful milestone. 
Given the above, I ask that this Legislative 
Body pause in its deliberations and join me in 
recognizing the one hundredth anniversary of 
the Chautauqua Blind Association, now known 
as CBA Vision Rehabilitation Services.

INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT 
OF COLUMBIA COURTS VACANCY 
REDUCTION ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 28, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the District of Columbia Courts Va-
cancy Reduction Act. This bill would allow 
local District of Columbia court nominees to be 
seated after a 30-day congressional review 
period unless a resolution of disapproval is en-
acted into law during that period. Currently, 
nominees cannot be seated without affirmative 
Senate approval. The congressional review 
process for nominees would be the same as 
used for legislation passed by the D.C. Coun-
cil. It is therefore a reliable process, long-rec-
ognized by Congress. My bill is prompted by 
the unique requirement that judges for the 
local D.C. courts be confirmed by the Senate, 
where nominees for the federal courts and ex-
ecutive branch, understandably, get the pri-
mary focus and priority. There has been a 
longstanding vacancy crisis facing the Dis-
trict’s local criminal and civil courts, and the 
local D.C. courts have raised serious concerns 
about these longstanding vacancies. 
Whether Democrats or Republicans control 
the Senate, the local D.C. courts regularly 
face vacancy crises, which harm the oper-
ations of the local judicial system in the Dis-
trict. Congress created the D.C. Judicial Nomi-
nation Commission (JNC) to recommend can-
didates to the President, and Congress should 
generally defer to its judgment. This bill is a 
compromise, useful to all concerned, that re-
tains a congressional role while saving the 
Senate time by removing the need for com-
mittee and floor action on local judges and in-
creasing the odds that D.C. will have a full 
complement of local judges. 
Currently, there are 12 vacancies out of 62 
authorized judges on the D.C. Superior Court 
and three vacancies out of nine authorized 
judges on the D.C. Court of Appeals. 
Both pre- and post-home rule, the District 
has never had control over the nomination and 
approval of local D.C. judges. My bill would 
not alter the role of the JNC or the President 
in the nomination process. Under the Home 
Rule Act, the JNC recommends to the Presi-
dent a list of three candidates for each va-
cancy on the Superior Court and the Court of 
Appeals. The President must nominate a can-
didate recommended by the JNC within 60 
days to the Senate for advice and consent. If 
the President fails to nominate such a person 
within 60 days, the JNC must nominate a rec-
ommended person directly to the Senate for 
advice and consent. The Senate has no obli-
gation to provide its advice and consent. 
Under this bill, once a nomination has been 
transmitted to Congress, the nomination would 
be deemed approved unless a resolution of 
disapproval is enacted into law during a 30- 
day review period. 
I urge my colleagues to support this impor-
tant legislation.

CRISIS AT THE BORDER 
HON. ROBERT E. LATTA 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 28, 2021 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, the humani-
tarian and national security crisis occurring at 
our southern border continues to worsen by 
the day. In June, Border Patrol stopped 
188,829 illegal immigrants, which is a 450 per-
cent increase from June of 2020. Earlier this 
year, I went to the border and saw first-hand 
how cartels are using innocent children as de-
coys to bring illegal narcotics into our country. 
Because of the policies—or lack thereof— 
from our current Administration, this crisis is 
being allowed to grow, cartels are taking ad-
vantage of our weak borders, and narcotics 
are flowing into our country like never before. 
In June alone, 1,053 pounds of fentanyl 
were seized at our southwest border. This is 
more than the last 3 Junes combined, and is 
enough to kill 238 million Americans. 
And to imagine—this is only the amount of 
fentanyl that was seized last month—what 
about deadly drugs that are slipping through 
the cracks and make their way into the coun-
try? 
Last week, the CDC reported the national 
overdose death rates for 2020. Overdose 
deaths across the country were the highest 
they have been over the last 50 years. In 
2020, in the United States alone, 93,331 peo-
ple died from a drug overdose. To put this 
number into perspective, 70,980 people died 
from a drug overdose in 2019. Nearly 75 per-
cent of fatal overdoses were attributed to 
opioids, a 5 percent increase from 2019, that 
was largely driven by fentanyl. In Ohio, opioid 
overdoses reached record levels rising 16 per-
cent in the second quarter of 2020, which had 
been declining over 24 months prior to the 
pandemic. 
Madam Speaker, Americans are dying be-
cause of the crisis at the border. We must act 
to stop the illegal flow of narcotics and protect 
our country. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF OFFICER 
RYAN BIALKE, RED LAKE NA-
TION POLICE FORCE 
HON. BETTY McCOLLUM 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 28, 2021 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today with a heavy heart to honor the life of 
Officer Ryan Bialke of the Red Lake Nation 
police force, who was shot and killed in the 
line of duty this week. My thoughts and pray-
ers are with Officer Bialke’s family, especially 
his young children, and with Chairman Darrell 
Seki and all members of Red Lake Nation. 
Their grief is shared by all Minnesotans during 
this very difficult time. 
Officer Bialke was responding to a call 
about a mental health emergency when the 
scene turned violent, and he was struck by 
gunfire. He was rushed to the Indian Health 
Service Hospital where he then passed away. 
This terrible tragedy reminds us that our dedi-
cated law enforcement officers put their lives 
on the line every day to serve our commu-
nities as they work to keep us safe, and my 
thoughts are with the rest of the Red Lake Na-
tion police force. 
A native of Buffalo, Minnesota, and a six- 
year veteran of the Red Lake Nation police 
force, Officer Bialke was described by his 
loved ones as having a big heart and a love 
of helping others, a desire to serve which led 
him to police work. My hope is that his family 
will find peace and comfort in the many cher-
ished memories they have of him in the weeks 
and months ahead. I offer my deepest condo-
lences to his family, friends, and community. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in paying 
tribute to Officer Ryan Bialke.

SPEECH OF 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO

Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of my amendment number 
101 included in En Bloc Amendment No. 3 to 
increase funding for the Energy Efficiency and 
Renewable Energy Facilities and Infrastructure 
account by $15 million to match the Presi-

This funding increase will help the National 
Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), lo-

products directly impacting the way we use 
energy. The lab has helped dramatically lower 
the cost of solar, wind, and biofuel tech-
nologies and pioneered energy efficient build-
ing technologies to reduce energy consump-
tion. 
Full funding for the Facilities and Infrastruc-
ture account will support NREL’s cross-cutting 
research, maintenance upgrades, and support 
the growing staff at the lab. NREL’s economic 
impact on our nation totaled $1.4 billion in 
FY19 while the lab supported nearly 7,000 
jobs nationwide. Supporting NREL not only 
supports Colorado, it supports our nation’s 
continued scientific and economic competitive-
ness and supports high-quality, good-paying 
jobs nationwide. 
I urge all my colleagues to support this 
amendment.

INDIA’S 75TH INDEPENDENCE DAY 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 28, 2021 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to commemorate India on its 75th 
Independence Day, which will be celebrated 
this year on August 15. On that date, its first 
Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru proclaimed 
that his country, in casting off its British rule, 
had ‘‘made a tryst with destiny.’’ He said that 
‘‘[at] the stroke of the midnight hour, when the 
world sleeps, India will awake to life and free-
dom. A moment comes, which comes but 
rarely in history, when we step out from the 
old to the new, when an age ends, and when 
the soul of a nation, long suppressed, finds ut-
terance . . .’’ 
Of course, India’s history stretches back 
thousands and thousands of years. Its civiliza-
tion and its contributions to the world are 
countless—from literature to philosophy to 
mathematics. India today is continuing in that 
tradition by extending a hand to other nations 
in their fight against the pandemic as the 
country itself manages its own severe COVID– 
19 outbreak. In addition, Indian Americans are 
making countless contributions here in the 
United States as doctors, lawyers, scientists, 
business owners, artists, and even in the 
White House in the person of Vice President 
KAMALA HARRIS whose mother was Indian. 
Of course, I would be remiss if I didn’t men-
tion the fact that India’s own struggle for inde-
pendence greatly influenced the United States’ 
own civil rights movement. America’s civil 
rights leaders, from Reverend Dr. Martin Lu-
ther King to my late colleague and friend Con-
gressman John Lewis, were inspired by the 
revered leader of Indian independence Ma-
hatma Gandhi. They followed in his footsteps 
by embracing Mahatma Gandhi’s non-violent 
approach to achieving social and political jus-
tice. 
In fact, when Dr. King left for India in Feb-
ruary 1959, he was just beginning to make his 
mark as a leader of the national movement for 
civil rights. He had organized the successful 
boycott of Montgomery, Alabama’s public 
transportation system in 1955, and founded 
the Southern Christian Leadership Conference 
two years later. His burgeoning success had 
provided his non-violent movement with the 
momentum and potential to become a truly 
powerful force in the pursuit of equal rights for 
all Americans. This momentum became en-
trenched during Dr. King’s trip to India, where 
his immersion in the world of Mahatma 
Gandhi’s own non-violent success led King to 
commit himself in his philosophical entirety to 
the principle of meeting hate and injustice with 
persistent non-violence. 
Though Gandhi had passed away eleven 
years prior to Dr. King’s journey, King was no 
less attentive to the followers of the great 
shanti sena—the ‘‘non-violent army’’ that Gan-
dhi led in his successful effort to free his coun-
try from the grasp of colonialism. He encoun-
tered those who had stood with Gandhi 
through the long, arduous struggle for India’s 
sovereignty, and came to deeply understand 
the necessary commitment and purpose of 
which believers in non-violence must never 
lose sight. Dr. King came to believe that if 
India can assert its independence from the 
bonds of the British Empire without violence, 
then the United States of America can achieve 
racial equality with the same approach. He 
took the lessons of a people half a world away 
and applied them to the struggle of his own 
nation, illustrating that a righteous cause pur-
sued by means which justify its ends holds 
universal promise. Perhaps it is best articu-
lated by Dr. King himself: ‘‘As I delved deeper 
into the philosophy of Gandhi, my skepticism 
concerning the power of love gradually dimin-
ished, and I came to see for the first time its 
potency in the area of social reform.’’ 
India and the United States share many 
deep and historic ties. I want to congratulate 
India and its people on the 75th Anniversary 
of its independence. I wish it many more years 
of peace and prosperity.

SPEECH OF 
HON. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 27, 2021 
Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of 
my amendment number 224, to En Bloc 5 of 
H.R. 4502. 
This appropriations bill is a historic and 
groundbreaking effort to address the urgent 
need for serious investments in working fami-
lies, people serving in our Armed Forces, 
urban and rural development, our healthcare, 
transportation systems and beyond. 
My amendment seeks to build on the good 
work of this Committee by investing critical 
dollars to assist in the abatement and removal 
of environmental hazards from homes that are 
set to be renovated. 
Beneficiaries include organizations like the 
local Habitat for Humanities in my district, 
which has a ‘sweat equity’ component that re-
quires new homeowners to assist in the des-
perately needed renovations for these homes. 
In today’s competitive housing market, low- 
income buyers are left with little options to 
reach the American dream of owning a home. 
That is why these funds and this amend-
ment are so important. They would provide 
critical assistance to organizations working to 
increase homeownership among low-income 
families and ensure that volunteer-based 
homeownership programs are able to make a 
lasting impact on their communities. 
Most importantly, they would ensure that 
homes are safe to be renovated. My ask is 
simple: let’s provide the necessary resources 
to outstanding organizations that already do 
great work in so many districts across the 
country. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in support 
of this amendment.

RAISING 
CONCERNS 
WITH 
EVI-
DENCE SELECTION BY THE JAN-
UARY 6TH SELECT COMMITTEE 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 28, 2021 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise to ad-
dress matters concerning the House Select 
Committee to Investigate the January 6th At-
tack on the United States Capitol. Others have 
addressed how the Committee was formu-
lated, and how the Democrats vetoed all the 
Republican nominees for the Committee, and 
instead chose two jack-Republicans. Allowing 
the Democrats to control who the Republicans 
can pick to serve on their side is like having 
the Milwaukee Bucks choose the starting line-
up of the Phoenix Suns. That is not my con-
cern today. 
Today, I want to point out the travesty of 
evidence selection. If we want the American 
public to get to the truth of January 6th, you 
must be able to handle the truth, that means 
all the truth, including facts you don’t like or 
facts that may reflect poorly on people you 
like. 
In that regard, I object to the failure to re-
lease all the evidence regarding January 6th. 
The 14,000 hours of surveillance video has 
been suppressed. Thousands of hours of body 
camera footage has been suppressed. Video 
and still photographs from official and home 
security systems have been suppressed that 
would have, and did, record the Republican 
National Committee pipe bomber. The inves-
tigation and report of the officer who shot and 
killed Ashli Babbitt has been suppressed. All 
we have seen is one video, which clearly 
shows an unlawful killing by the officer. If 
there are other videos exonerating him, why 
haven’t they been released? We know that 
Rep. MULLINS has stated publicly that the offi-
cer who unlawfully shot Ashli Babbitt felt re-
morse and guilt for his wrongful actions. But 
we do not have his own words of contrition. 
Moreover, many criminals show remorse and 
guilt after the event, yet we still prosecute 
them. 
That brings me to the most well-funded per 
capita police force in the world, the United 
States Capitol Police. With 2,500 officers, pro-
tecting the Capitol should have been obtain-
able. What happened? Why were there so

many breaches so quickly? Well, we know 
that the rank-and-file officers want to tell us 
why, but they were not invited to testify. We 
need the truth, and these men and women 
need to be able to tell their stories, the story 
of how their own leadership, and the political 
leadership in Washington, D.C., failed them 
and led to the breaches. I include in the 
Record the press release dated July 28, 2021 
from the Capitol Police Labor Committee 
whose voice, like so many, has been silenced 
by this Committee. They need to be heard and 
the truth needs to come out, even if the truth 
makes political leadership look inept. 
Capitol Police Union to House Committee: 
‘‘Hear All Our Voices’’ 
United States Capitol Police Labor Com-
mittee 
Washington, D.C.—Capitol Police Officers 
are suffering a whole-of-force effect from the 
January 6th attacks on the U.S. Capitol, 
says the union representing those officers. 
The Capitol Police Officers’ Union wel-
comed today’s testimony from two Capitol 
police officers and two MPD officers to the 
House Committee investigating the Jan 6th 
insurrection. 
Union Chairman Gus Papathanasiou said: 
‘‘Their testimony is a crucial start to under-
standing the broad and far-reaching effects 
on all our officers from the violence that 
day.’’ 
‘‘In support of all our officers, our Union 
stands ready to provide the Committee with 
the depth needed to fully grasp the enormity 
of the events that day and provide the con-
text for how events went so terribly, and 
tragically, wrong.’’ 
‘‘The police response to January 6th rep-
resents a disastrous collapse of leadership 
that was not simply an aberration confined 
to that one day. It was months and years in 
the making.’’ 
‘‘To fully understand why our officers felt 
so abandoned, requires an understanding of 
how they came to be left uninformed and 
lacking in defenses when it mattered most— 
when an attack on the U.S. Capitol was 
being fully realized.’’ 
‘‘Most importantly, we arrived at that po-
sition of vulnerability because the voices of 
the rank-and-file-officers had been ignored 
for years. There was no collaboration from 
Capitol Police leaders with the frontline offi-
cers, instead it was a top-down approach 
that left a void of information and planning. 
As an officer working that day, I can attest, 
there was NO plan, and certainly no contin-
gency plans by the Chiefs.’’ 
‘‘That lack of leadership had tragic con-
sequences. The riots led to the deaths of offi-
cers, and injuries to an estimated 140 Capitol 
Police and MPD officers, some of whom will 
never return to service.’’ 
‘‘As individual officers testified today, 
they did their best and succeeded in their 
mission to protect all members of Congress 
and their staff that day. The Committee 
needs all the facts to understand why the 
U.S. Capitol was so vulnerable, and why it 
will remain vulnerable if the broader rank- 
and-file officers are not heard.’’ 
‘‘The most urgent challenge, is to keep the 
officers we have right now and that requires 
a renewed faith in their mission and a re-
stored belief that Congress has their backs.’’ 
‘‘Poor morale, inequitable pay and condi-
tions, and a leadership that refuses to en-
gage—these are contributing factors to the 
events of January 6th and they remain fac-
tors still, today.’’ 
‘‘The Union asks that the Committee lis-
ten to the active-duty police officers who 
have been chosen by the rank and file to rep-
resent them.’’

RECOGNIZING LEWIS H. WEBBER, 
A TRUE WORKING-CLASS CHAM-
PION 
HON. BRIAN HIGGINS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 28, 2021 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Lewis Webber, 
the President of Steelworkers Organization of 
Active Retirees (SOAR) Chapter 4–6, for a 
lifetime of fighting for the working class. 
Lewis Webber was born days before the 
Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 
of 1941 so he was always ready for a good 
fight. Advocating for the workers at Bethlehem 
Steel was in his blood, as many of his rel-
atives, including his father, were employed 
there. Growing up in a union household, he 
and his brother heard all the stories from their 
father about the strikes at Bethlehem Steel, in-
cluding the famous 53-day 1952 Steelworkers 
strike, ending with a victory for the hard-work-
ing Steelworkers. 
It was not a surprise that Lewis Webber and 
his brother would also go on to work many 
years of their lives at Bethlehem Steel. Lewis 
started working at Bethlehem Steel in October 
of 1964. He was of a member in three sepa-
rate unions: United Steelworkers, Truckdrivers 
Union Local, and the United Autoworkers. As 
a member of the United Steelworkers, he re-
calls fighting to make sure that the proper 
withholding was taken out of the employees 
checks. Later, in 1985, Mr. Webber officially 
won a grievance against Bethlehem Steel, 
providing 22 workers an additional $238 a 
week for two years, and a pension for the rest 
of their lives. 
When Bethlehem Steel shut its doors, the 
Western New York community was dev-
astated; however, that didn’t stop Lewis 
Webber from continuing to fight for those who 
had worked there. He joined the Steelworkers 
Organization of Active Retirees (SOAR), 
Chapter 4–6 and put the skills he learned from 
earlier battles to work as he rose in the ranks 
of leadership becoming Trustee in 1997, Vice 
President in 2007, and President of the Steel-
workers Organization of Active Retirees in 
2008. There are 430 members of SOAR who 
rely on his leadership today. 
Lewis Webber always says that you can 
never fight these battles alone. His number 
one supporter was his wife, Beverly who un-
fortunately passed away in 2011. She was 
also Secretary of the Steelworkers Organiza-
tion of Active Retirees, Chapter 4–6. His chil-
dren Rosemary, LuAnn, and Kathleen, grand- 
children, and great-grandchildren are always 
by his side, fighting the good fight. 
Mr. Webber joined our fight over a decade 
ago to help former Bethlehem Steel employ-
ees receive compensation under the Energy 
Employees Occupational Illness Compensa-
tion Program (EEOICP) and he continues to 
work with my office to ensure eligible retirees 
receive the benefits they deserve. Over $300 
million has been paid out to workers and their 
families after they were exposed to radiation 
while working at Bethlehem Steel. 
Lewis Webber offered many words of ad-
vice, including ‘‘I am not doing this to make 
people millionaires; I am doing this to get 
them what they need to get by in this world. 
I am not doing this to help just the Steel-
workers; I am doing this to help all Ameri-
cans,’’ and, ‘‘Always fight using your brains, 
not your fists. At, the end of the day your 
knowledge of the contract will be more likely 
to help you win the battle.’’ His words dem-
onstrate his commitment to his fellow workers 
and his lifetime of experience advocating for 
the interests of Steelworkers. 
Many Bethlehem Steel retirees and their 
families who live in Western New York are 
better off because Lewis Webber has never 
stopped and will never stop fighting for them. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join 
me in honoring the lifelong commitment that 
Lewis Webber has shown to the former em-
ployees of Bethlehem Steel, the greater West-
ern New York community, and the United 
States as a whole.

HONORING DETECTIVE DAVID 
MITCHELL 
HON. TOM REED 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 28, 2021 
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, today I rise to 
honor Detective David Mitchell, a Jamestown 
Police Department detective who was gravely 
injured in the line of duty on September 15, 
1999, while serving the public and their safety. 
David should be celebrated and honored for 
his bravery and sacrifice. 
Detective David Mitchell was shot on the 
evening of September 15, 1999 while meeting 
up with a drug informant. Since that time, 
David has recovered from his near-fatal injury, 
beating all odds, but still contends with hear-
ing and memory loss. His injury could have 
proven fatal, but he pulled through and con-
tinues to be an active member of society. 
David served the city not only as a detec-
tive, but also as an undercover narcotics offi-
cer, showing great dedication and courage. 
His service to Jamestown and the community 
is priceless, and it has been recognized by the 
residents, the police department, and others, 
including his current employer, Rand Machine, 
over the years. His service should not be for-
gotten, and we are honored to be able to rec-
ognize him in this way for his bravery and per-
severance.

rounding communities during a time of great

David for his courage, resolve and bravery,

ber of the Jamestown Police Department and

HONORING THE LIFE OF GE 
XAOCHAY THAO 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 28, 2021 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Ge Xaochay Thao. Thao Ge 
passed away on June 24, 2021. He was a vet-
eran, a father, grandfather, and husband to his 
wife Pa Moua. 
Thao Ge was born on July 31, 1935, in a 
region known as Roob Tshuaj or Medicine 
Mountain in the Xiengkhouang Province in 
Laos to Phoutong Xaochay Thao and Chong 
Moua. Growing up, Thao Ge had five brothers 
and three sisters, 
As Thao Ge grew older, he was part of the 
military and was recruited in 1953 by the 
French Guerilla Commando Military Army 
(GCMA) and trained as a Paratrooper and 
Radio Operator in the French Military Camp in 
Cap Saint Jacques in South Vietnam. 
After his training, Thao Ge was one among 
many in 1954 to march towards Dien Bien 
Phu to provide military support to the French 
Army. He returned after learning that the 
French had lost the battle to the North Viet-
namese Army. Thao Ge was then later com-
missioned as the Chief of ‘‘Partisans Militaire’’, 
a Military Support Unit in Xiengkhouang. 
During his time as Chief, Thao Ge was best 
known for saving the life of the late General 
Vang Pao, then Major, from an assassination 
attempt by their military rivals. The attempt 
took place in the Plain of Jars in Laos. Be-
cause of his bravery and help in protecting 
Major Vang Pao, Thao Ge and his troop, the 
‘‘Partisans Militaire’’, played a significant role 
in helping reinstate Major Vang Pao back into 
military power. 
In 1961, Thao Ge continued his military 
services in the Royal Lao Army, holding the 
rank of Two-Star Lieutenant. He served in the 
Batallion Voluntaire 21 (BV 21) and fought 
side-by-side with the United States in the Se-
cret War of Laos from 1961–1975. Thao Ge 
was one of the very few people who were lit-
erate, allowing him to serve as an Officer of 
Disbursement for BV 21. 
Extending from his military contributions, 
Thao Ge paved the way for many Thao clan 
members and friends to get an education. 
From 1954 to 1958, Thao Ge and his wife, Pa 
Moua, opened their home to nearly 30 stu-
dents, allowing them to attend school in the 
City. 
In 1976, Thao Ge and his family fled Laos 
to come to the United States as refugees. 
They first came to Madison, Wisconsin and in 
1983 moved to Fresno, California. 
He is survived by his wife, Pa Moua, chil-
dren, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and 
his brother James Koua Xaochay Thao. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life of Ge Xaochay. His 
service and contributions to the nations and 
the State of California will be missed. I join his 
family and friends in celebration of Thao Ge’s 
life.
