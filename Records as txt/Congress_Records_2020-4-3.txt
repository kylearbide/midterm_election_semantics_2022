MIDDLE CLASS HEALTH BENEFITS 
TAX REPEAL ACT OF 2019 
SPEECH OF 
HON. JAHANA HAYES 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 27, 2020 
Mrs. HAYES. Mr. Speaker, the novel 
coronavirus, has become a global pandemic 
that has brought us to the brink. Connecticut 
has been hit particularly hard by this virus, 
with more than 1,000 confirmed cases to date. 
Nonessential businesses in my state have 
been shuttered, crippling our local economy, 
squeezing small businesses, and causing 
painful layoffs. Our hospitals, frontline health 
workers, and first responders are over-
whelmed working without enough resources, 
personal protective equipment, and tests to 
combat the rapid spread of this unrelenting 
disease. 
There is no more time to waste. Congress 
must act now to combat this virus and get the 
states and the American people the support 
and resources they need. I applaud House 
leadership for their hard work on this bill and 
for getting a deal for the American people. I 
was indeed frustrated that big business seem-
ingly stepped to the front of the line in earlier 
proposals, but I commend my colleagues for 
pushing back against toxic provisions that 
would bail out those corporations, no strings 
attached, without providing the requisite sup-
port to hospitals and everyday Americans. 
This bill is not perfect, and does not include 
everything I advocated for, but it does include 
critical funding that will save lives and help my 
constituents in Connecticut’s 5th District re-
cover from the economic fallout of this public 
health crisis. It includes $150 billion for our 
health care system, nearly $16 billion for vet-
eran health care, over $20 billion for SNAP, 
WIC, and other nutrition programs, direct pay-
ments to Americans to help with the financial 
burden this virus has caused, over $350 billion 
in funding for small businesses and nonprofits, 
$150 billion in grants for states and local mu-
nicipalities, the expansion of unemployment 
benefits to make sure workers everywhere can 
land on their feet after losing their job. Finally, 
it provides over $35 billion for early childhood 
education programs, K through 12 schools, 
and higher education institutions in response 
to the severe disruptions caused by the pan-
demic—including funds that will help students 
and teachers with distance learning. 
This third relief package is a monumental 
step forward, but more work needs to be done 
to respond to this public health and economic 
emergency. When future legislation is being 
discussed, I hope to include more relief for 
volunteer firefighters and EMS personnel, who 
are the first responders in many of the com-
munities in my district. Their work is so vitally 
important, now more than ever, and we must 
ensure they have the proper equipment and 
protections in place to do their jobs. I hope 
more funding will be made available for rural 
health providers in the Northwestern Corner of 
Connecticut. We must help the Postal Service 
and its employees, which have been hit hard 
by the effects of the virus. I want to see more 
support for teachers as they adapt to a new 
reality of distance learning, and more relief for 
student loan borrowers. I hope that we will see 
an expansion in funding for the Centers for 
Medicare and Medicaid Services. This is par-
ticularly important as we look to combat the 
alarmingly high rates of infection in nursing 
homes. 
The impact that this virus is having on my 
district, Connecticut, and our nation, cannot be 
understated, and we must do everything to 
help Americans overcome the challenges we 
are facing. Now is the time for unity, coopera-
tion and immediate action. For these reasons 
I support this bill and look forward to it being 
signed into law.

MIDDLE CLASS HEALTH BENEFITS 
TAX REPEAL ACT OF 2019 
SPEECH OF 
HON. DAVID B. McKINLEY 
OF WEST VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 27, 2020 
Mr. MCKINLEY. Mr. Speaker, in times of cri-
sis the American people look to their elected 
officials to step up and work together to do 
what is best for the country. The CARES Act 
is an unprecedented response to a public 
health and economic emergency unlike any 
we’ve seen before. 
Americans are facing something many of 
them have never encountered before. The 
coronavirus is threatening the health of their 
loved ones as well as their financial liveli-
hoods. Leaving them feeling worried and 
scared. This bill will give the health care pro-
fessionals and researchers on the front lines 
the resources they need to fight the virus and 
ultimately develop a vaccine and cure. It will 
help individuals feeling financial hardship by 
providing economic assistance and expanding 
unemployment benefits for those who have 
lost their jobs. It will help small businesses 
stay alive and maintain payroll during this pe-
riod of distress. It will ensure children receive 
the nutrition they need while schools are 
closed. 
Now is a time for all Americans to pull to-
gether to help fight this invisible enemy. This 
is the third time Congress has acted in re-
sponse to this crisis. More action will likely be 
needed, but this legislation represents an im-
portant step to give Americans confidence that 
the government can meet this public health 
and economic challenge. 
MIDDLE CLASS HEALTH BENEFITS 
TAX REPEAL ACT OF 2019 
SPEECH OF 
HON. JEFF FORTENBERRY 
OF NEBRASKA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 27, 2020 
Mr. FORTENBERRY. Mr. Speaker, this is 
an unprecedented crisis, requiring an unprece-
dented response. People are suffering, and 
America is uncertain. This legislation acts to 
protect America’s health care system, protect 
individuals and families, and protect small 
business. 
With this battle plan from our government— 
and the sacrifice and courage of the American 
people—we will fight back, we will help our 
sick, and we will restore our great nation. I 
support the bill.

MIDDLE CLASS HEALTH BENEFITS 
TAX REPEAL ACT OF 2019 
SPEECH OF 
HON. PATRICK T. McHENRY 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 27, 2020 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, this unprece-
dented time in our nation’s history calls for an 
unprecedented response. This is not like any 
economic or health issue we’ve faced. This is 
a voluntary shut down of vast parts of the 
economy in an effort to save American lives, 
and, as a result, we need the CARES Act. 
It’s important to remember, this is not a 
stimulus package, this is emergency relief. 
And this is not a bailout for bad business deci-
sions or one specific industry. The CARES 
Act, while not perfect, is the appropriate action 
to provide necessary resources to get Ameri-
cans and our economy through this national 
emergency. 
My ultimate goal for this legislation is to 
keep Americans employed. Specifically, this 
bill will provide relief to our small businesses 
to help them keep employees on payroll and 
prepare those businesses to be up and run-
ning as soon as America is open for business 
again. 
The CARES Act provides $377 billion in 
small business loans. This will allow a small 
business to go to any federally insured finan-
cial institution to access those loans—many of 
which will be forgiven if used to support keep-
ing employees on payroll, another important 
provision to help keep folks employed. 
This bill also provides Treasury Secretary 
Mnuchin and Fed Chairman Powell with the 
resources they need to address the liquidity 
crisis facing the main street businesses that 
employ millions of Americans. The CARES Act 
allows them the flexibility to meet the needs of 
American businesses in the coming weeks 
and months by allocating $500 billion to an 
Exchange Stabilization Fund, or ESF. This

critical funding will allow the Treasury Sec-
retary to provide loans and loan guarantees to 
businesses of all sizes. 
Of that $500 billion, $454 billion assists the 
Treasury Department and Federal Reserve in 
loan facilities and programs to help distressed 
businesses. This funding has the potential to 
unleash more than $4 trillion in lending to 
businesses of all sizes, consumers, local gov-
ernments, and money market funds. 
We know Americans can’t wait for this relief. 
I’m glad the CARES Act is soon headed to the 
President’s desk for his signature and to the 
aid of families across our country.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF EMILY 
HARRIS-ESCAMILLA 
HON. DAN NEWHOUSE 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, April 3, 2020 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, Emily 
Harris-Escamilla was a shining light through-
out her community of Selah, Washington. Her 
smile would illuminate rooms, and she was a 
bright and graceful soul who nobody could for-
get. 
To the people of Selah, Emily was a loving 
mother, daughter, friend, and coach. Trag-
ically, she was taken from her family and 
loved ones as a victim of domestic violence. 
However, her community has chosen not to 
let this tragedy overshadow and darken their 
memories of Emily. Shortly following the news 
of her death, over 100 members of the com-
munity gathered at a local park to hold a can-
dle light vigil to honor her and provide comfort 
and support to those affected by her death. 
Perry Technical Institute, a local college, es-
tablished a scholarship in her name, which will 
continue Emily’s legacy and passion for help-
ing others. 
In lieu of flowers, her family requested that 
donations be made to the YWCA to assist 
those fleeing domestic violence. Emily’s love 
and appreciation for her friends and family and 
her desire to help others continues to live on, 
with people urging each other to ‘‘live like 
Emily’’. 
I urge my colleagues to send their prayers 
to the Harris family and may we all seek to 
‘‘live like Emily’’.

HONORING THE HEROIC LIFE OF 
GENERAL LE MINH DAO 
HON. HARLEY ROUDA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, April 3, 2020 
Mr. ROUDA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the heroic life of General Le Minh 
Dao, who passed away on March 19, 2020. 
General Dao spent his 87 years of life fighting 
for freedom and serving his community. 
Born in 1933 in Sai Gon, Vietnam, Le Minh 
Dao would go on to serve in the Army of the 
Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam War. 
Outnumbered and fighting against the odds, 
General Dao made a heroic stand in what is 
now known as the Battle of Xuan Loc, the last 
major struggle before Saigon’s fall on April 30, 
1975. For 13 days, the General and his men 
of the 18th division of the ARVN withstood an 
unrelenting barrage from Communist forces. 
The battle would be a showcase of General 
Dao’s military brilliance and a testament to his 
unimpeachable courage. 
Due to his passionate and inspirational lead-
ership, General Dao will forever be recognized 
as a hero, both within the Vietnamese commu-
nity and to all of us who hold the ideals of 
freedom and democracy above all else. 
I ask that all Members join me in honoring 
the extraordinary life of General Le Minh Dao.
