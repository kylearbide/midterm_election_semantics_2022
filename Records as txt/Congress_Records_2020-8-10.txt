The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, who rules the raging of 
the sea, we seek Your face in these tur-
bulent times. 
Lord, help us to so live that the gen-
erations to come will know of Your 
mighty acts.

ceive a bountiful harvest if they per-
severe.

I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God,

The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
CRAPO). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute as in morning business, please. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. 
GRASSLEY. 
Mr. 
President, 
today our national public health and 
economic crisis continues without ad-
ditional 
legislative 
action. 
Reports 
over the weekend indicate that the 
Senate minority leader believes that 
he can hold out for a massive, unwieldy 
bill that even includes unrelated poli-
cies, yet refuse to consider action 
where there is already consensus. The 
New York Times reported that the 
Speaker ‘‘believes she has the upper 
hand’’ and ‘‘does not intend to lose it.’’ 
The other side refuses to support 
even the relief measures where there is 
broad bipartisan agreement, such as 
providing additional funds for unem-
ployment benefits, the Paycheck Pro-
tection Program, education, State and 
local governments, recovery checks, 
and hiring and employee-retention in-
centives. This shows us where their pri-
orities are—politics, not people. That 
is a shame. 
I yield the floor. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
had hoped that this week the Senate 
would 
be 
busy 
providing 
more 
coronavirus aid and that the chairmen 
and ranking members would be work-
ing overtime across the aisle to finalize 
another major pandemic relief package 
for the American people. After all, 
there are so many important ways in 
which American families need help and 
which Democrats say they see as big 
priorities, just like Republicans do— 
priorities like continuing a Federal 
add-on to unemployment insurance, 
more tools for schools to safely reopen, 
more access to testing and diagnostics, 
more resources to develop vaccines and 
treatments, a new round of checks to 
put cash in families’ hands ASAP, and 
another round of the hugely successful 
Paycheck Protection Program that 
small businesses have relied on, which 
was left out of the Democrats’ pro-
posal. 
All of these things and many more 
were in Senate Republicans’ trillion- 
dollar proposal for another coronavirus 
rescue package focused on kids, jobs, 
healthcare, and legal protections to 
help our country reopen. 
So I had hoped the Senate would be 
spending this week turning a major 
agreement into law, but sadly for the 
country, sadly for struggling Ameri-
cans, the Speaker of the House and the 
Senate Democratic leader decided we 
would not deliver any of that—none of 
it. 
For weeks, Speaker PELOSI and the 
Democratic 
leader 
in 
the 
Senate 
stalled and stalled in backroom nego-
tiations 
with 
the 
administration’s 
team. For weeks—weeks—they held up 
important aid over non-COVID-related 
demands. They stayed true to their

S5360 
August 10, 2020 
comments from very early on in this 
pandemic. 
This is the way they looked at it: 
They saw this pandemic as ‘‘a tremen-
dous opportunity to structure things to 
fit our vision.’’ That was the House 
Democratic whip. Speaker PELOSI her-
self put it this way: ‘‘This is an oppor-
tunity. Every crisis is.’’ Working fami-
lies call this pandemic a crisis. They 
call it a nightmare. But leading Demo-
crats call it ‘‘an opportunity.’’ 
Just listen to some of their demands. 
These are the Democrats’ demands 
that stood between all of this help and 
the Americans who need it. 
Here is one: Democrats say nobody 
gets another dime of relief unless State 
and local governments get about $1 
trillion in extra money. Let me say 
that again. Democrats are saying no-
body gets another dime of relief unless 
State and local governments get $1 
trillion in extra money. 
Let’s put a few facts on the table. 
No. 1, State and local governments 
have spent only about one-fourth of the 
huge sums we sent them back in the 
springtime—$150 billion. 
No. 2, the economists who have cal-
culated 
the 
likely 
COVID-related 
shortfalls for State and local govern-
ments have mostly produced estimates 
that are entire multiples less—entire 
multiples less—than what Democrats 
are demanding. 
No. 3, in our HEALS Act, Repub-
licans tried to give States and local-
ities 
extra 
flexibility 
around 
the 
unspent funds they already had—extra 
flexibility around the unspent funds 
they already had. In my State, for ex-
ample, 94 percent of the money we sent 
them has not been spent. 
We wanted to send huge sums to help 
with schools, which are one of the 
States’ biggest expenses. Typically, in 
a State budget, the two biggest items 
are education and Medicaid. 
But forget all that. Democrats are 
demanding that we send State and 
local governments a colossal amount of 
money, with no relationship to actual 
need, while they have only spent a 
quarter—25 percent—of the money they 
have already gotten. 
Clearly, this isn’t about COVID. 
Democrats think they smell an opening 
they have wanted for years—to make 
Uncle Sam bail out decades of mis-
management and broken policies in 
places like New York, New Jersey, and 
California. So they have decided that 
no working family anywhere in Amer-
ica can get another cent—not one 
cent—unless they get to create a tril-
lion-dollar slush fund for mismanaged 
States, completely and totally out of 
proportion to pandemic needs. 
Here is another one of those far-left 
demands: Nobody gets another dime 
unless we indefinitely pay people more 
to stay home than to go back to work. 
Republicans agree we ought to con-
tinue additional Federal jobless bene-
fits during this extraordinary time. 
Senate Republicans tried several times 
to stop them from expiring. The Demo-
cratic leader blocked us. 
Our view, which a majority of Ameri-
cans 
share, 
is 
simply 
that 
it 
disincentivizes rehiring and reopening 
to pay people more to stay home. It is 
a 
statement 
of 
the 
obvious. 
It 
disincentivizes rehiring and reopening 
to pay people more to stay home. 
Plenty of Democrats said they saw 
the point and were happy to negotiate 
on this. Speaker PELOSI’s own No. 2, 
the House majority leader, said: ‘‘It is 
not $600 or bust.’’ That was the No. 2 
Democrat in the House. The senior 
Senator from Maryland said: ‘‘We cer-
tainly understand. We don’t want to 
have a higher benefit than what some-
one can make working.’’ Oh, no. But 
the Speaker and the Democratic leader 
overruled them. No deal. No deal unless 
we pay people more to stay home. 
That is not about COVID. It is not 
about a real reopening. It is about far- 
left ideology. They preferred for the 
jobless benefits to go down to zero— 
zero—unless they could pay people 
more to stay home. 
Does anyone in this country really 
believe 
that 
relief 
for 
Americans 
should be totally contingent on bailing 
out States for mismanagement that 
predated the pandemic by decades? 
Does anyone really think it was better 
for jobless benefits to completely ex-
pire unless we pay people more not to 
work? And does anyone really think 
that Congress should walk away from 
countless subjects where a bipartisan 
agreement should be possible over 
these fringe positions? Do Americans 
think Democrats should walk away 
from school funding, testing, cash to 
households, preventing a spike in sen-
iors’ Medicare premiums, legal reform, 
and more, over this? 
I think almost every family in Amer-
ica would answer these questions the 
same way, but unfortunately Speaker 
PELOSI and the Democratic leader have 
answered them the opposite way. They 
think they have political leverage over 
the President of the United States, and 
so they are willing to personally in-
crease the pain for vulnerable families 
unless they get their way on matters 
not related to COVID. 
Republicans wanted to agree on the 
things we could agree to. Democrats 
said: Our way or the highway. 
Republicans wanted to send cash 
now—right now—for schools, testing, 
and unemployment benefits and argue 
over State bailouts later. Democrats 
said nobody gets a penny unless Texas 
and Florida bail out New Jersey. That 
is their position. Nobody gets a penny 
unless Texas and Florida bail out New 
Jersey. 
So this is where we are. The previous 
UI benefits expired. The PPP closed its 
doors. 
Over the weekend, President Trump 
took steps to soften the blow of the 
Democrats’ hostage tactics on Amer-
ican families who need help most. His 
decisions will help spare some Ameri-
cans some of the pain from the Demo-
crats’ hostage-taking. 
From the beginning—from the very 
beginning—our side has tried every-
thing possible to find common ground 
and deliver more help, but the Demo-
crats have said no. At least the Amer-
ican people know the score. At least 
they know the score. 
f 
HONG KONG 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, on 
a totally different matter, this week-
end brought more unsettling news in 
the ongoing struggle for Hong Kong to 
preserve any shred of its civil liberties 
and self-governance. 
One of the region’s most prominent 
pro-democracy advocates, Jimmy Lai, 
was arrested yesterday for alleged vio-
lations of the so-called national secu-
rity law imposed by Beijing. 
Last year, after a historic election 
that saw millions flock to the polls to 
overwhelmingly reject President Xi’s 
preferred candidates, the Chinese Com-
munist Party moved quickly to choke 
Hongkongers’ free expression. 
Mr. Lai has been at the vanguard of 
the vibrant Hong Kong-based media 
and publishing world. 
Jimmy Lai was arrested for an al-
leged violation of the so-called na-
tional security law imposed by Beijing. 
He has devoted much of his life to ad-
vancing precisely—precisely the sort of 
values that the CCP finds most repul-
sive: freedom of thought and freedom 
of speech. 
The Senate, the country, and free-
dom-loving nations across the world 
stand with Mr. Lai and with all the 
peaceful demonstrators who have met 
the business end of the CCP’s repres-
sion.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will be

sence of a quorum.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5361 
August 10, 2020 
achieved an ignominious milestone. 
Five million Americans are confirmed 
to have contracted COVID–19—by far, 
the most in the world. 
Our country went from 4 million 
Americans having had the disease to 5 
million in 17 days—only 17 days. One 
million Americans were infected in 
just 17 days. We have lost American 
businesses, American wealth, and an 
unbearable number of American lives— 
a number that will inevitably increase 
as the number of infections continues 
to rise. 
The brutal economic effect of the 
pandemic has spared no corner of our 
country. We are living through the 
greatest economic crisis since the De-
pression and the greatest health crisis 
since the Spanish flu in 1918. So it 
should not be hard to convince Repub-
licans in the Senate and the White 
House to provide urgent and necessary 
relief to the American people. 
The $3.4 million in the Heroes Act 
was based on the country’s needs, 
which is so large and so diverse. It is 
not a political position; it is what our 
country needs—its schools, its busi-
nesses, its renters, its homeowners, its 
essential workers, its post office, its 
elections, State and local governments, 
our healthcare system. Leader MCCON-
NELL doesn’t seem to understand this. 
He sees everything through a political 
lens. 
But we Democrats are looking at the 
real needs of people. They are large, 
and they come from many different 
places. That is why we called for a 
large bill because it was needed be-
cause the American people demanded 
it. At this point, the American people 
are on our side. By survey data, two- 
thirds support the $3.4 billion Demo-
cratic plan, not the skimpy Republican 
plan that doesn’t deal with people’s 
needs. 
But at the end of last week, after 
days of arduous negotiations, Speaker 
PELOSI and I continued to run into Re-
publican intransigence. They didn’t see 
people’s needs the way we did. They 
didn’t see the depth and breadth of this 
crisis. So, like in any normal negotia-
tion, we offered to move in their direc-
tion if they would move in ours. Let’s 
meet in the middle, we said—in the 
middle. 
That 
is 
how 
negotiations 
occur. That is how you get something 
done. The White House said no. 
It was difficult for us to offer that 
compromise. The Democratic position 
is that we want to devote enough re-
sources to defeat the virus and see the 
American people through this crisis. 
The Republican position is to give 
much less than what is needed. Demo-
crats don’t want to leave large portions 
of the country and the economy to fend 
for itself, but the reason we want to 
meet in the middle is that getting 
major legislation through Congress is 
the only way to achieve something sig-
nificant for the American people. 
Rather than compromise, our Repub-
lican counterparts said: ‘‘Take a hike.’’ 
Quite literally, they said virtually this 
in the room: No, it is going to be our 
way or no way. We are not going to 
meet you in the middle. 
Why? Why wouldn’t they, when the 
needs are so great, when there are so 
many people suffering and so many 
more who will suffer if we don’t act? It 
is because this Republican Party is so 
tied in a knot that it can’t agree to 
anything. It can only spute the same 
political speech every day. 
Republican Leader MCCONNELL
has 
admitted that 20 Republican Senators 
will not vote for any more relief for the 
American people. The Senate bill that 
the Republican leader keeps referring 
to lacks the support of Senate Repub-
licans. He can’t bring it to the floor be-
cause so many of them will vote 
against it. 
The President himself called the Re-
publican bill ‘‘semi-irrelevant’’—one of 
the few things he said about this crisis 
that had some truth to it. 
It was not some possibility that 
Democrats 
blocked. 
Senate 
Repub-
licans spiked it the moment it came 
out. Why? Maybe they thought that 
these Executive orders would be a way 
out. They are so tied in a knot they 
can’t legislate or even bring them-
selves to join us in the middle. They 
were clinging to the hope that the 
President could do something on his 
own through Executives orders, but as 
we have seen, Executives orders in gen-
eral aren’t going to get the job done, 
especially the incompetent ones issued 
over the weekend. 
President Trump’s recent Executive 
orders are so unserious, in terms of 
meeting the large needs of America, as 
to be pathetic. Take, for example, the 
payroll tax deferral. It makes no sense. 
Even Republican Members of Congress 
and, according to reports some mem-
bers of the administration, opposed a 
payroll tax deferral because it would do 
next to nothing to help our workers or 
the economy. Remember, the President 
did not cancel payroll taxes—he can’t— 
he just deferred them. Most employers 
will continue to withhold the payroll 
tax so that their employees will not be 
hit with a very large tax bill in Decem-
ber when the deferral expires. ADP, a 
nonpolitical payroll processing com-
pany, said: It ‘‘may take months to im-
plement’’ the President’s new policy. 
It feels like forever ago, but Can-
didate Trump promised he was dif-
ferent from Republicans and would 
never touch Social Security or Medi-
care. Well, guess what. Deferring the 
payroll tax is a backdoor way of weak-
ening Social Security and Medicare. In 
case the President’s intentions weren’t 
clear, he said that after the election he 
may permanently cut the payroll tax, 
which would deplete the trust funds 
and destroy Social Security and Medi-
care as we know it. If you are a senior 
or have paid into Social Security or 
Medicare and are waiting for it, watch 
out—watch out. Seniors throughout 
the decades, since we have had Social 
Security, have jealously regarded the 
trust fund, and now Donald Trump 
says: Well, maybe we should get rid of 
it because we should defer; we should 
get rid of the payroll tax altogether. 
This Executive order is an example of 
many 
false 
promises 
that 
Donald 
Trump has made and, just as impor-
tantly, it is so put together with spit 
and glue that in all likelihood many 
States will not implement it at all— 
some have said so. And many more, 
even if they want to implement it, will 
take months—several months—while 
people will not get their unemploy-
ment benefits. 
The easiest thing to do for the good 
of the economy, for keeping millions 
out of poverty, which the President’s 
pandemic unemployment insurance has 
done, is simply to renew the existing 
unemployment insurance. But because 
of the hard right, because so many Re-
publicans don’t want to spend the 
money, even for people who have lost 
jobs through no fault of their own, it 
doesn’t happen. 
The idea that the American worker is 
looking for an out is demeaning to the 
American worker, Leader MCCONNELL. 
Americans want to work. There is 
pride in work. The overwhelming ma-
jority of Americans, if given the choice 
of a job or unemployment insurance for 
a period of time, even if that unem-
ployment insurance is not exactly 
what they got paid, will take the job. 
We know that. 
America believes in the work ethic. 
So how demeaning to the American 
worker to say they are looking for a 
way out; that they are looking for a 
way to ‘‘skeeve’’ the system. That is 
not the American worker I know. That 
is not the New York worker I know. 
But, of course, when unemployment is 
over 10 percent, you can be looking for 
a job, but you may not get one. That is 
the reason so many people are on pan-
demic unemployment insurance. 
The President’s plan there was noth-
ing short of a disaster in terms of its 
inability to be implemented, its effect 
on Social Security and Medicare, and 
the demeaning way in which it looks at 
the American worker. The President’s 
Executive orders, therefore, are a dis-
aster. 
The President’s Executive order on 
evictions is the best example of all siz-
zle and no steak. It does not even guar-
antee a moratorium on evictions. It 
merely instructs Federal Agencies to 
‘‘review’’ and ‘‘consider’’ whether it is 
appropriate to halt evictions, let alone 
people who have fallen behind on their 
rent. 
Three of the things the President has 
done don’t work. The deferral of the 
payroll tax hurts Social Security and 
does not pump money into the econ-
omy. Cutting the unemployment insur-
ance will take weeks and months to 
implement and hurts American work-
ers and demeans them. The Executive 
order on evictions says: Let’s consider 
something. We know what that means 
in jargon around here: Let’s not do it. 
Let’s just talk about it. 
President Trump’s Executive orders 
are hardly worth the paper they are

printed on. You don’t have to take my 
word for it. Go ask Republican Sen-
ators from South Carolina and Ne-
braska who aren’t too thrilled with it 
either. 
Of course, the biggest problem with 
these Executive orders is not what 
they do but what they don’t and can’t 
do. The orders don’t address testing, 
tracing, and treatment of COVID–19— 
desperately needed to curb the health 
crisis which, in turn, is hurting the 
economy so badly. 
The orders leave out money to safely 
reopen our schools and provide the 
PPE and other help to keep the kids, 
teachers, and staff safe. The orders will 
not give food assistance to hungry kids 
and families. 
The orders will not aid State and 
local governments, firefighters, sanita-
tion workers, bus drivers, healthcare 
workers. All the people who keep our 
communities running could lose their 
jobs. 
The orders leave out funds to ensure 
elections can be carried out safely 
amid COVID–19, and the orders do 
nothing to keep our post offices open 
and make sure our elections are con-
ducted in a safe and sound manner dur-
ing this COVID crisis. 
The fact is, we are facing an unprece-
dented crisis. The government is going 
to have to commit resources to fight 
this disease and the economic devasta-
tion it has wrought. Executive orders 
cannot do that and, therefore, will al-
ways be insufficient, especially those 
crafted in such a poor way as these. 
The only way to crush the virus and 
truly protect American working fami-
lies is to pass a comprehensive bill in 
Congress that is equal to the chal-
lenges facing our country. Democrats 
remain ready to return to the table. We 
need our Republicans to join us there 
and meet us halfway and work together 
to deliver immediate relief to the 
American people. We are ready as soon 
as our Republican colleagues have 
come off this view that it is their way 
or no way and meet us in the middle. 
Now, before I yield the floor, I want 
to take a step back and talk about the 
core problem in our negotiations over 
the past few weeks. President Trump 
and the Republican Party—certainly in 
the Senate—are not alive to the suf-
fering of the American people. The re-
sponse from the White House to the 
greatest domestic challenge of the 21st 
century can be summed up in five 
words issued by President Trump in an 
interview last week: ‘‘It is what it is.’’ 
President Trump was challenged to 
defend his claim that COVID–19 is 
under control. ‘‘How?’’ he was asked. 
‘‘A thousand Americans are dying a 
day.’’ President Trump’s response: ‘‘It 
is what it is.’’ 
‘‘It is what it is.’’ That is how the 
President of the United States of 
America responds to the harrowing 
fact that more than 1,000 Americans 
are dying every single day from a virus 
his administration has failed to con-
tain—not a morsel of empathy, not an 
ounce of sorrow, not a shred of remorse 
for the many mistakes his administra-
tion has made. The President says: ‘‘It 
is what it is.’’ 
What a shocking admission of Presi-
dential failure. We live in the wealthi-
est and most powerful Nation on Earth. 
Yet countries around the world manage 
to test their citizens, isolate cases, 
stop the spread of the disease—coun-
tries with bigger populations than ours 
and countries with a mere fraction of 
our resources and know-how. President 
Trump’s response to this crisis is a na-
tional and an international embarrass-
ment. The President says: ‘‘It is what 
it is.’’ 
President Trump is not the only one 
who dismisses the gravity of COVID–19. 
The 
lack 
of 
empathy 
and 
under-
standing starts at the top, but it goes 
all the way down. The President’s Chief 
of Staff said COVID–19 isn’t such a big 
deal for schoolchildren compared to 
the flu. Leader MCCONNELL
put the 
Senate on ice for 4 months in the mid-
dle of a global pandemic because his 
party ‘‘didn’t feel the urgency of act-
ing’’—his words. Now, by the leader’s 
own admission, more than a third of 
the Senate Republican caucus doesn’t 
want to vote for anything—anything— 
to help the American people. 
The economy is failing. Small busi-
nesses are closing. State and local gov-
ernments are cutting essential serv-
ices. Americans can’t pay the rent and 
will be thrown out of their homes. 
Families can’t afford to feed their chil-
dren. Essential workers don’t have 
PPE. We are sending our kids back to 
school without a plan. The number of 
Americans we are testing is going 
down. The disease is ravaging our nurs-
ing homes. Americans are dying—so 
many in so short a time that funeral 
homes and morgues are storing the 
dead in refrigerated 18-wheelers. 
Yet the President says: ‘‘It is what it 
is.’’ The President, his aides, his party, 
and Congress are not even awake to 
what is happening in this country. 
That is the reason Senate Republicans 
delayed for 4 long months, and that is 
the reason we have been unable to find 
agreement with the White House. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
thank you. I want to thank the minor-
ity leader—the Democratic leader, Mr. 
SCHUMER—for his remarks. 
There are not many of us around here 
in the Senate today. It is pretty quiet. 
If you walk through the halls, there is 
virtually nobody around. That is what 
it was like last Thursday afternoon. 
That is what it was like here in the 
Senate on Friday and again on Satur-
day and again on Sunday. Here we are 
again on Monday, and this Senate is 
virtually a ghost town—a few people 
here, but for the most part, everybody 
was sent home by the majority leader, 
by Senator MCCONNELL. 
He told Senators: Go home until fur-
ther notice. Go home. We are going to 
put the Senate on standby. No need to 
be here doing the people’s business. 
Well, the coronavirus is not on stand-
by. The coronavirus is very much alive 
and well and spreading throughout the 
country—more severely in some parts 
than others but spreading throughout 
the country—and with it has come the 
spread of economic pain and economic 
harm. So COVID–19 is not on standby, 
and neither is the economic pain and 
fallout that it has caused. 
But here in the U.S. Senate, the Re-
publican leader, the majority leader, 
has said: Go home and be on standby. 
That is not leadership at any time. It 
is certainly not the kind of leadership 
that the American people need and 
should expect during a global pandemic 
and recession-era unemployment lev-
els. 
So why did the majority leader tell 
people to just go home and be on stand-
by? It is because he wanted the Trump 
administration to negotiate an agree-
ment. Last I checked, the U.S. Senate 
was a separate branch of government 
with its own responsibilities. Yet we 
have the Republican leader, who runs 
the U.S. Senate from the floor, telling 
people to go home and be on standby 
because he wants the President of the 
United States, the Trump administra-
tion, to negotiate an agreement and 
then come back to us. In other words, 
the Republican leader wants to con-
tract out his responsibilities and the 
responsibilities of the U.S. Senate to 
the executive branch. 
If you look at the U.S. Constitution, 
there are three separate branches of 
government. Yet the Republican leader 
has decided to give his proxy to the 
President of the United States, to the 
executive branch, rather than stay 
here in the U.S. Senate and do our 
work. 
Now, why is that? Why is it that the 
majority leader has decided to contract 
out his responsibilities and those of the 
Senate to the executive branch of gov-
ernment? Well, we don’t have to guess 
because Mr. MCCONNELL has told us. He 
told PBS NewsHour: ‘‘About 20 of my 
Members think that we have already 
done enough.’’ Let me read that again. 
This is from the Republican leader: 
‘‘About 20 of my Members think that 
we have already done enough.’’ 
He is obviously referring to Repub-
lican Members of the Senate caucus. 
These are Members of the Senate Re-
publican caucus. They think all is well; 
we have done enough; we don’t need to 
do any more to expand access to test-
ing, don’t need to expand access to per-
sonal protective equipment, don’t need 
to do anything to help our schools. We 
have done enough. We don’t need to do 
anything more on unemployment in-
surance, where the additional $600 a 
week has expired. 
Senator MCCONNELL said that 20 of 
his Members thought they have al-
ready done enough. The eviction mora-
torium is coming to an end, both na-
tionally and in many States, but 20

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5363 
August 10, 2020 
Members of the Senate Republican cau-
cus, their leader says they have done 
enough. 
Here is what Senator LINDSEY GRA-
HAM said on FOX: ‘‘I think, if MITCH 
can get one-half of the conference, that 
would be quite an accomplishment’’— 
referring to the Republican conference. 
So Senator GRAHAM of South Carolina 
is saying that if MITCH MCCONNELL—if 
Mr. MCCONNELL, the Republican leader, 
can get half the Members of the Repub-
lican Senate caucus to do anything, 
that would be quite an accomplish-
ment. 
I want all of us to think about what 
that means. What it means is that 
many of our colleagues are happy to 
have packed up and gone home and 
that we are not doing anything because 
they don’t think we need to be doing 
anything. That is really why we are 
not here. 
That is also why you saw the Trump 
administration emissaries, Secretary 
Mnuchin and Chief of Staff Mark Mead-
ows, walk away from the negotiating 
table. They understood that, if they 
reached what was truly a compromise, 
a principal compromise, Senator GRA-
HAM said that half the Republican cau-
cus would oppose it because they would 
oppose anything. 
So that is why you had the Trump 
administration walk away from the ne-
gotiating table and refuse to come to a 
sensible agreement. What did we get 
instead? Because they walked away 
from an agreement, we had the Presi-
dent of the United States throw to-
gether a press conference at his golf 
club in New Jersey. He put the Amer-
ican flags up at his golf club, put out a 
podium with the Presidential seal, in-
vited club members to witness the 
signing of an Executive order and some 
memos. 
Here is the really sad truth about the 
matter: It was mostly show rather than 
real substance. It was something that 
we would come to expect from some-
body who is really good at reality TV 
but somebody who did not understand 
the painful realities being experienced 
by Americans throughout this country 
during this health pandemic and the 
economic pandemic. I say that because, 
if you begin to look at what the Presi-
dent actually signed, it is both inad-
equate and also unworkable in almost 
all its parts. 
Let’s put aside for now the question 
of whether or not the President had the 
legal authority to do what he did be-
cause, clearly, in some parts of his Ex-
ecutive order and his memos, he does 
not have the constitutional authority 
to do that. We have heard that from 
some of the Senate Republican Mem-
bers already. But let’s set that aside 
and just see whether it will actually 
deliver meaningful relief to Americans 
or whether it is more like the degree 
that was given to folks who attended 
so-called 
Trump 
University, 
which 
turned out to be a fraud and is now 
shuttered. Let’s take a look at what 
the President did. 
First, with respect to extending the 
$600 a week of unemployment insur-
ance benefits—and let’s remember the 
starting point for this is that neither 
the President of the United States, 
Donald Trump, nor the Republican 
Senate want to extend the $600-a-week 
unemployment 
compensation. 
They 
say it is too much for Americans who 
are out of work, through no fault of 
their own, because of this pandemic 
and even though there are poor people 
looking for work right now in America 
for every job that is available. I hear 
from constituents every day—I read 
some of their stories last Thursday on 
the floor of the Senate—people who 
badly want to get back to work, but 
their former job is gone, and there is 
no new job to replace it, and they need 
that additional $600 a week to make 
ends meet. 
In fact, I want to read to the Senate 
some additional letters I received from 
constituents on this point: Please act 
to extend the $600-a-week unemploy-
ment enhancement. I am requesting it 
both in my name and on behalf of my 
wife. We both lost our jobs. And the ad-
ditional $600 is significantly helping 
keep us afloat and purchase the needs 
of life. My job was supposed to restart 
in late June, but the owner has pushed 
it back to November, December, to be 
determined. My wife was put on fur-
lough and told the company hoped to 
bring everybody back but has heard 
nothing yet. Without the additional 
$600, a time will come in the next few 
months when we will be unable to pay 
our bills. 
Here is a note I received from an-
other constituent: Respectfully, Sen-
ator CHRIS VAN HOLLEN, I would like to 
write to you about the $600 unemploy-
ment. I understand that the other 
party is fighting you all the way. This 
is painful because I am a diabetic, and, 
at this point, because that benefit was 
taken away, I have to choose between 
paying my bills or my insulin. I applied 
sometime in June, since I was thinking 
I would be back to work. Gone are my 
savings to pay rent, car loan, insur-
ance, and other bills. From this week 
on, because of losing the $600, I will 
have to stop paying bills so I can pay 
for my insulin. I never thought that I 
would be in a situation like this in 
America, where if you work hard, pay 
your taxes—to be able to have a roof 
over your head, health insurance, and 
human dignity. 
I, like I am sure many of my col-
leagues, have received hundreds—hun-
dreds of notes like that from our con-
stituents, people who will not be able 
to make ends meet without the addi-
tional $600 a week, but the President 
doesn’t want to continue that, nor do 
Senate Republicans. 
And so what did the President say up 
in New Jersey? He came up with this 
plan that, unfortunately, will not de-
liver. Essentially, what he said was: 
Take the funds that were provided in 
the CARES Act to the States—the U.S. 
Congress provided about $150 billion to 
States to help during the early stages 
of this pandemic, both to help purchase 
things like PPE and also to address the 
economic fallout. 
I should remind my colleagues that 
Senator MCCONNELL was dead against 
that, even in the earlier version. If you 
go back and look at the debate in the 
RECORD, you will find that he was dead 
set against providing any funds to 
State and local governments. That was 
the result of a compromise that he suc-
ceeded in pushing in those negotia-
tions. But in these most recent nego-
tiations—these most recent negotia-
tions—both 
the 
White 
House 
and, 
again, Senator MCCONNELL and Senate 
Republicans took the position of no 
funds for State and local governments. 
I remember a few months back when 
asked, the Republican leader, Senator 
MCCONNELL, said: Let them go bank-
rupt. Let them go bankrupt. Well, 
there is a productive solution. He may 
have walked those comments back a 
little bit, but he did not walk back his 
opposition to any funds for State and 
local governments. 
What did the President say in New 
Jersey the other day? OK, States, take 
the earlier emergency funds that Con-
gress provided and use those as a 25- 
percent match to the 300 Federal dol-
lars so we can provide $400 per week in 
additional employment insurance. 
Here is the problem with that. We 
provided that $150 billion emergency 
assistance to the States because of the 
emergencies they were facing then and 
continue to face because they are fac-
ing both increased costs with respect 
to helping frontline healthcare pro-
viders and hospitals and providing 
them with personal protective equip-
ment. 
The Federal Government has been 
pretty much AWOL when it comes to 
testing. The President said to the 
States, you-all set up testing regimes. 
And so they are using some of those 
funds we provided for that. They are 
using those funds to try to open 
schools safely or help provide distance 
learning when schools can’t be open 
safely. 
Many of the States—especially those 
hardest hit—have already allocated the 
great majority, if not all, of those 
funds. And now the President is saying: 
Oh, well, use those funds that we pro-
vided to you earlier for this other pur-
pose. 
No. 1, those States and other areas 
have already allocated most of those 
funds. I noticed that if you look at the 
Treasury tables, the data they re-
leased, it was for the end of June, and 
that money was already spent—not 
today. The money was already allo-
cated. 
So, first of all, for many States, that 
money is already spoken for, but let’s 
say in some cases there is some money 
left over. What is the President of the 
United States saying? He is saying he 
wants to take from one American to 
give to another one. The President 
wants to pit these needs against one

another. He wants to rob constituent 
Peter to pay constituent Paul. Those 
moneys went to the States. Those mon-
eys went to States to pay for real 
needs. 
OK, Governor; OK, State legislature, 
you are going to have to fire that 
emergency responder who will now 
both be out of a job and unable to pro-
vide emergency assistance so that you 
can give a $100 match to help somebody 
who has lost their job a little bit more. 
That is what the President is saying to 
those States that do have something 
leftover. We don’t even know how 
much that is. 
If you think about it, that is not how 
a country should be responding in the 
middle of a pandemic. Governors, you 
have to hurt that person to help that 
one. That is what the plan of the Presi-
dent of the United States says, and 
that is when it is working the way he 
wants it. That is if it works as adver-
tised. 
From the President’s perspective, 
best case scenario, when this plan is 
working, he is asking Governors to 
take from one set of constituents of 
Americans who are hurting badly, 
could lose a job—they need the PPE; 
they need testing; they need to open 
the schools, but take it from over 
there, and put it over here. That is 
what the President is saying. 
That is assuming it works at all, 
whether that money is available and 
whether there is a way you can actu-
ally do all of this through what is a 
pretty 
cumbersome 
administrative 
process. 
I don’t know if any of my colleagues 
saw the Sunday shows in realtime or 
reruns or read about them, but here is 
what Larry Kudlow was asked on the 
CNN ‘‘Morning Show’’ by Dana Bash, 
simple question: Have you checked 
with the States? How many of the 50 
States and DC and other territories say 
that they are going to be able to pony 
up $100 a week per unemployed citizen? 
Larry Kudlow: Good question. Good 
question. We will probably find that 
out today or tomorrow as we make our 
canvas. 
If there wasn’t another sign that 
what happened in New Jersey was a 
total show, this tells it all. They laid 
out a plan asking States that have run 
out of money, but if they have some 
money, to rob Peter to pay Paul, but 
they didn’t even ask the States if it 
was doable. They didn’t even ask the 
States if it was doable. That is a reflec-
tion of this entire plan. 
Let’s look at what the President said 
about the second piece—payroll tax de-
ferral. A lot of Americans might have 
heard that and thought: I am an em-
ployee. I am working, and now the por-
tion of my check that is withheld for 
payroll taxes—like Social Security—I 
am not going to have to pay that any-
more, and that will be money in my 
pocket. 
That is not what it did. What it did 
was say to these people who are work-
ing—by the way, as we all know, de-
ducting payroll taxes from paychecks 
doesn’t help the 30 million who don’t 
have a job. They are not getting a pay-
check. They have nothing to deduct 
something from. People who are work-
ing and thought this was going to be 
extra money that they can pocket for-
ever, that is not the case. 
What the President was saying is 
that we will withhold those payroll 
taxes from your paychecks through the 
end of the year, but it is going to come 
due and owing. 
These are people who are working. 
These are people who have their jobs. 
Maybe they want to defer that for a lit-
tle while or not, but at the end of the 
day, they are going to have to pay it 
back to Uncle Sam. 
Here is the other problem. Employers 
are the ones who are legally respon-
sible for the delivery of those payroll 
taxes, not just for the employer but for 
the employee as well. They are going 
to have to take the risk that if one of 
their employees doesn’t want their So-
cial Security taxes paid—in other 
words, they want them withheld—ulti-
mately, they will be paid back. But 
what we are hearing from lots of em-
ployers is they can’t guarantee that. 
First of all, what if that employee 
leaves? How am I going to repay that 
portion of the payroll taxes? 
Here is another example of some-
thing that may have sounded good to 
some people when they heard it, but it 
really is a shell game in the first in-
stance and, in many ways, a sham. 
By the way, whether it is a deferral 
or if it is ultimately forgiven—that 
would require an act of Congress—then, 
the Social Security system takes a hit. 
Then the Social Security system takes 
a hit unless you refund it, but that is 
not in the President’s plan. The Presi-
dent’s memo doesn’t talk about refund-
ing it if, in fact, it were ever forgiven, 
which he can’t do either. 
Let’s look at the eviction morato-
rium. That is a real mirage. I urge my 
colleagues just to read the Executive 
order. The Executive order tells Health 
and Human Services and the Centers 
for 
Disease 
Control 
to 
‘‘consider’’ 
whether an extended eviction morato-
rium is reasonably necessary to protect 
the public health. He is asking two 
Federal agencies to consider a question 
he posed to them. 
I imagine a lot of people who may 
have watched the President with the 
American flags up in his country club 
thought: Wow, the President just said 
that no one can get evicted. 
That is not what he said at all. It was 
a sham. He said HHS and CDC should 
‘‘consider’’ whether an extended evic-
tion moratorium is reasonably nec-
essary to protect the public health. 
Then he asked HUD and Treasury to 
look around in their bank accounts to 
see if they have money to help people 
who might be evicted. 
Do you know the way to help people 
who may be evicted? First of all, don’t 
let them be evicted in the first place, 
and help them and the landlords by 
passing the rental assistance provision 
that is in the Heroes Act that passed 
the House. 
Whether you look at the unemploy-
ment insurance provision or the pay-
roll tax provision or the so-called evic-
tion moratorium provision, this really 
is show and not substance. I am only 
talking about what the President put 
into the plan, not everything that got 
left out—everything that got left out 
that is in the Heroes Act: helping peo-
ple go back to schools safely; helping 
to expand realtime testing so that we 
can open our economy and schools safe-
ly; food assistance for those who are 
struggling; rental assistance; money 
for State and local government, whose 
needs have only risen dramatically 
since the last down payment that Con-
gress passed in the CARES Act. 
Now the President is saying that we 
want you to go poach that fund and 
hurt people by taking things away 
from them in order to help other Amer-
icans. Those are some of the things 
that were totally left out of here. 
I have often heard, when talking 
about State and local governments, 
that the President tweets all the time 
that this is just a question of blue 
States wanting to be bailed out for bad 
economic decisions or bad budget prob-
lems they had and that red States are 
just doing great. Anybody who looks at 
the State financial affairs knows that 
is not true. Take a look at my State of 
Maryland. Most people would consider 
us a blue State. We have the AAA bond 
rating. The last I checked, the State of 
Kentucky was a single A bond rating. 
This isn’t a question of whether we 
want to help States that somehow had 
difficult financial situations before the 
coronavirus hit. The reality is that 
right now this is not a red State or 
blue State issue. This is an American 
issue. We all know that the virus has 
spread throughout the country. Nobody 
can totally escape it. It doesn’t matter 
whether you are a red State or a blue 
State. This is a red, white, and blue 
moment, and we need to treat it as a 
national effort, not a State by State ef-
fort but one also where the Federal 
Government plays a very important 
role and is not AWOL in the middle of 
a pandemic, and not playing politics in 
the middle of a pandemic. Listen to the 
healthcare experts about whether or 
not to wear a mask instead of making 
that a political statement that puts 
people at greater risk who follow the 
President’s political advice rather than 
the healthcare advice of the healthcare 
experts. 
I hope we will get back to the negoti-
ating table. But to do that, the Presi-
dent has to be serious about reaching a 
conclusion, and he is going to need help 
from the Republican leader, Senator 
MCCONNELL, and from that more than 
half of the Senate Republican con-
ference that both Senator MCCONNELL 
and Senator GRAHAM say do not want 
to do anything at all. Let me clarify 
that. The Republican leader said 20 
Members don’t want to do anything at

all, and it was Senator GRAHAM who 
said about half. If that is the case, our 
country is in even bigger trouble than 
we might have thought because there 
is a failure to recognize the immediacy 
of the need and the depth of the prob-
lem that we face. Let’s get back to the 
negotiating table. 
I remember some of the President’s 
top priorities when he first presented 
his plan. He wanted that tax break for 
three-martini lunches for business ex-
ecutives—no food assistance for needy 
families but yes to tax breaks for 
three-martini lunches. That is what 
the President said. I think we were all 
surprised to see he wanted $1.6 billion 
or $1.7 billion to build a new FBI head-
quarters at its current site, rather than 
follow through with the original plan, 
which was to move that headquarters 
to a suburban campus for security 
needs and to consolidate. But I guess if 
you rebuild it at its current site, there 
really is no risk that someone will buy 
that land and end up building a hotel 
that competes with the nearby Trump 
hotel. That was part of the President’s 
set of priorities in the middle of an 
emergency. American people need to 
understand that. 
Let’s get back to the negotiating 
table. What the President did was show 
and not substance. We need to work to-
gether in order to do something mean-
ingful. Don’t walk away. Come on back 
and let’s work. 
And, finally, when I say come on 
back—again, I will end where I started. 
It is awfully quiet around here. We are 
in the middle of a pandemic. The virus 
hasn’t taken a vacation. The virus 
hasn’t taken any time off. The eco-
nomic harm isn’t taking a vacation or 
any time off. Yet here we are in the 
Senate, all quiet. Talks break down 
with the administration. We are a sepa-
rate branch of government under the 
Constitution of the United States. 
Let’s get back here and do our job for 
the American people. 
I yield the floor.

(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The M1126 Stryker is an infantry carrier 
vehicle transporting nine soldiers, their mis-
sion equipment, and a crew of two, con-
sisting of a driver and vehicle commander. It 
is equipped with armor protection, M2 ma-
chine guns, and M6 smoke grenade launchers 
for self-protection. The Stryker is an eight- 
wheeled vehicle powered by a 350hp diesel en-
gine. It incorporates a central tire inflation 
system, run-flat tires, and a vehicle height 
management system. The Stryker is capable 
of supporting a communications suite, a 
Global Positioning System (GPS), and a high 
frequency and near-term digital radio sys-
tems. The Stryker is deployable by C–130 air-
craft and combat capable upon arrival. The 
Stryker is capable of self-deployment by 
highway and self-recovery. It has a low noise 
level that reduces crew fatigue and enhances 
survivability. It moves about the battlefield 
quickly and is optimized for close, complex, 
or urban terrain. The Stryker program 
leverages 
non-developmental 
items 
with 
common subsystems and components to 
quickly acquire and filed these systems. 
2. The AN/VAS–5 Driver’s Vision Enhancer 
is a compact thermal camera providing ar-
mored vehicle drivers with day or night time 
visual awareness in clear or reduced vision 
(fog, smoke, dust) situations. The system 
provides the driver a 180 degree viewing 
angle using a high resolution infrared sensor 
and image stabilization to reduce the effect 
of shock and vibration. The viewer and mon-
itor are ruggedized for operation in tactical 
environments. 
3. The highest level of classification of de-
fense articles, components, and services in-
cluded in this potential sale is SECRET. 
4. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the specific 
hardware and software elements, the infor-
mation could be used to develop counter-
measures that might reduce weapon system

POLICY JUSTIFICATION 
Belgium—MK 54 Lightweight Torpedoes 
(LWT) 
The Government of Belgium requests to 
buy twenty-nine (29) All Up Round MK 54 
LWT Mod 0. Also included are two (2) Fleet 
Exercise Section conversion kits, torpedo 
support equipment, training and publica-
tions, U.S. Government and contractor engi-
neering, technical, and logistics support 
services, and other related elements of logis-
tics and program support. The total esti-
mated program cost is $33.3 million. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy and national security objectives of 
the United States by improving the security 
of a NATO Ally which is an important force 
for political stability and economic progress 
in Europe. 
The Belgian Navy is phasing out its inven-
tory of MK 46 torpedoes. The MK 54 will give 
them the ability to engage submarines from 
its fleet of NH–90 helicopters and the new 
generation of Multi-Mission Frigates. Bel-
gium will have no difficulty absorbing this 
equipment into its armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The principal contractor will be Raytheon 
Integrated Defense System, Portsmouth, 
Rhode Island. There are no known offset 
agreements proposed in connection with this 
potential sale. 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
not require the assignment of any additional 
U.S. Government or contractor representa-
tives to Belgium; however, U.S. Government 
Engineering and Technical Services may be 
required on an interim basis for installations 
and integration. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of 
Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the 
Arms Export Control Act 
Annex Item No. vii 
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The MK 54 Torpedo is a conventional 
torpedo that can be launched from surface 
ships, helicopters, and fixed wing aircraft. 
The MK 54 is an upgrade to the MK 46 Tor-
pedo, which is currently in-service in Bel-
gium. The MK 54 replaces MK 46’s sonar and 
guidance and control systems with modern 
technology. The new guidance and control 
system uses a mixture of commercial-off- 
the-shelf and custom-built electronics. The 
warhead, fuel tank and propulsion system 
from the MK 46 torpedo are re-used in the 
MK 54 configuration with minor modifica-
tions. There is no sensitive technology in the 
MK 54 or its support and test equipment. 
Belgium has not requested nor will it be pro-
vided with the source code for the MK 54 
operational software. The highest classifica-
tion of items to be transferred by this pos-
sible sale is SECRET. 
2. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the hardware 
and software elements, the information 
could be used to develop countermeasures or 
equivalent systems which might reduce sys-
tem effectiveness or be used in the develop-
ment of a system with similar or advanced 
capabilities. 
3. A determination has been made that the 
Government of Belgium can provide substan-
tially the same degree of protection for the 
sensitive technology being released as the 
U.S. Government. This sale is necessary in 
furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and 
national security objectives outlined in the 
Policy Justification. 
4. All defense articles and services listed in 
this transmittal have been authorized for re-
lease and export to Belgium.

Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of 
Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the 
Arms Export Control Act 
Annex Item No. vii 
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The MV–22 Osprey is a U.S.-military, 
multi-mission, Tilt-Rotor aircraft with both 
a Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) and 
Short Takeoff and Landing (STOL) capa-
bility. 
It 
is 
designed 
to 
combine 
the 
functionality of a conventional helicopter 
with the long-range, high-speed cruise per-
formance of a turboprop aircraft. 
2. The AN/AAQ–27A Forward Looking In-
fraRed (FLIR) is a third-generation, mid- 
wavelength infrared (MWIR) imaging system 
that allows aircrews to see through dark-
ness, smoke, haze, and adverse weather. The 
system incorporates a state-of-the-art MWIR 
indium-antimonide (InSb) staring focal plane 
array with 480 x 640 detector elements. It has 
demonstrated superb image quality and 
range performance using non-developmental, 
in-production components to provide higher 
resolution imagery than current long wave-
length infrared systems. 
3. The AN/APR–39 Radar Warning Receiver 
(RWR) System monitors the environment for 
pulsed radar signals, characterizes and iden-
tifies them, and alerts the crew to the exist-
ence of emitters. The AN/APR–39 contributes 
to full-dimensional protection by improving 
individual aircraft probability of survival 
through improved aircrew situational aware-
ness of the electromagnetic threat environ-
ment. These systems have specific aircraft 
applications providing varying levels and 
types of warning to allow aircrews to ini-
tiate evasive maneuvers or deploy active 
countermeasures. 
4. The AN/ALE–47 Countermeasure Dis-
penser System (CMDS) is an Electronic War-
fare (EW) System providing combat aircrews 
with enhanced survivability in all threat en-
vironments. This on-board, self-protection 
capability stems from the integration of 
RWR hardware with a system for the dis-
pensing of expendable countermeasures. The 
AN/ALE–47 CMDS provides the aircrew with 
a ‘‘smart’’ countermeasure dispensing sys-
tem, allowing the aircrew to optimize the 
countermeasures employed against anti-air-
craft threats. The systems consists of five 
major components and several sub-compo-
nents. 
5. The AN/AAR–47 is an Electronic Warfare 
(EW) system designed to protect aircraft 
against Infrared-Guided (IR) missile threats, 
laser-guided/laser-aided 
threats, 
and 
unguided munitions. Upon detection of the 
threat, the system will provide an audio and 
visual sector warning to the pilot. For IR 
missile threats, the system automatically 
initiates countermeasures by sending a com-
mand signal to the CMDS. The AN/AAR–47 
includes sensor pre-processing for improved 
performance in high-clutter environments. 
6. AN/APX–117 is a commercially available 
Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) trans-
ponder that incorporates all of the advanced 
features required in today’s global military 
and civil air traffic control environments. 
The transponder’s open-system architecture 
design and high-density field-programmable 
gate 
array 
technology 
ensures 
ongoing 
versatility and future utility through soft-
ware growth, without the risk and cost asso-
ciated with hardware modifications. The AN/ 
APX–117 supports IFF modes 1, 2, 3/A, C. It is 
Automatic Dependent Surveillance—Broad-
cast (ADS–B) complaint and is compatible 
with Multifunctional Information Distribu-
tion System (MIDS) and Joint Tactical In-
formation Distribution System (JTIDS). 
7. The AN/ARN–153 is a full-featured Tac-
tical Air Navigation (TACAN) system capa-
ble of supporting the operational require-
ments of high performance aircraft in a 
lightweight compact design. The AN/ARN– 
153 supports four modes of operation: receive 
mode; transmit-receive mode; air-to-air re-
ceive mode; and air-to-air transmit-receive 
mode. 
8. The AN/ARN–147 systems combines all 
Very High Frequency (VHF) Omni Ranging/ 
Instrument Landing System (VOR/ILS) func-
tions into once compact, lightweight, low- 
cost set. It is the first militarized VHF navi-
gation receiver to provide optional internal 
MIL–STD–15538 capability. The solid-state 
system is MIL–E–5400 class II qualified and 
meets 
international 
operability 
require-
ments by providing 50-kHz channel spacing 
for 160–VOR and 40-localizer/glideslope chan-
nels. Digital and analog outputs of the AN/ 
ARN–147 ensure compatibility with high-per-
formance flight control systems and both 
digital and analog instruments. Modular 
construction techniques give quick access to 
all cards and modules to reduce repair time. 
9. The AN/ARC–210 629F–23 (non-COMSEC) 
multimode integrated communication sys-
tem is designed to provide multimode voice 
and data communications in either normal 
or jam-resistant modes in line-of-sight mode. 
The system is capable of establishing 2-way 
communication links over the 30 to 512MHz 
frequency range in tactical aircraft environ-
ments. 
10. The AN/APN–194 Radar Altimeter Re-
ceiver-Transmitter is a high-resolution de-
vice which measures altitude from 0 to 5,000 
feet Above Ground Level (AGL). The radar 
altimeter measures the time (analogous to 
distance) required for a pulse of electro-
magnetic energy to travel from the aircraft 
to the ground and back to the aircraft. The 
AN/APN–194 employs a narrow-pulse trans-
mission in the C-band range with leading 
edge tracking of the echo pulse. Altitude 
range information is obtained by comparing 
the received echo pulse with a timed ramp 
voltage generated simultaneously with the 
transmitted pulse. The output of the AN/ 
APN–194 is fed into the autopilot of the tar-
get to control the altitude of low-flying tar-
gets. 
11. The AN/ASN–163 is a 5-channel Minia-
ture Airborne GPS Receiver (MAGR) that 
provides Over-The-Horizon and secure navi-
gation capabilities using satellite informa-
tion. 
12. The M240 Machine Gun (7.62mm) is a de-
fensive weapon system used to support troop 
insertion and medical evacuation missions. 
13. The Joint Mission Planning System 
(JMPS) is a PC-based common approach for 
aircraft mission planning. It is a system of 
common and host-platform-unique mission 
planning applications for Navy and Marine 
Corps aircraft. Using a ‘‘building block’’ ap-
proach, developers integrate and assemble a 
JMPS Mission Planning Environment (MPE) 
from a set of software sub-components to 
meet the needs of a particular aircraft type. 
An MPE consists of a framework, one or 
more common components/federated applica-
tions, and a Unique Planning Component 
(UPC). The foundation of an MPE is the 
framework, which allows the host operating 
system to interface and interact with the 
MPE. The second level of an MPE consists of 
the common components and/or federated 
applications; 
these 
applications 
provide 
functionality that is common to multiple 
aircraft platforms (i.e. weather or GPS mu-
nitions). The final level of software is the 
UPC, 
which 
provides 
platform-specific 
functionality and integrates the common 
components functions and the framework 
interface to produce the overall mission 
planning software environment for the plat-
form. When bundled, the three levels of soft-
ware become an MPE that is specific to a 
single aircraft type. Depending on the air-
craft model, a JMPS MPE might operate on 
a stand-alone, locally networked, or domain 
controlled, or a mixture of all three oper-
ating environments. 
14. The highest level of classification of de-
fense articles, components, and services in-
cluded in this potential sale is SECRET. 
15. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the hardware 
and software elements, the information 
could be used to develop countermeasures or 
equivalent systems which might reduce sys-
tem effectiveness or be used in the develop-
ment of a system with similar or advanced 
capabilities. 
16. A determination has been made that 
the Government of Indonesia can provide 
substantially the same degree of protection 
for the sensitive technology being released 
as the U.S. Government. This sale is nec-
essary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign pol-
icy and national security objectives outlined 
in the Policy Justification. 
17. All defense articles and services listed 
in this transmittal have been authorized for 
release and export to Indonesia.

TRANSMITTAL NO. 20–18 
Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of 
Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the 
Arms Export Control Act 
Annex Item No. vii 
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The F–35A Conventional Take Off and 
Landing (CTOL) aircraft is a single-seat, sin-
gle-engine, all-weather, stealth, fifth-genera-
tion, multirole aircraft. The F–35B Short 
Take-Off and Vertical Landing (STOVL) var-
iant is capable of operating from short air-
fields and ships. Both variants contain sen-
sitive technology including the low observ-
able airframe/outer mold line, the Pratt and 
Whitney F135 engine, AN/APG–81 radar, an 
integrated core processor central computer, 
a mission systems/electronic warfare suite, a 
multiple sensor suite, technical data/docu-
mentation, and associated software. Sen-
sitive elements of the F–35A and F–35B are 
also included in operational flight and main-
tenance trainers. Sensitive and classified 
elements of the F–35A CTOL and F–35B 
STOVL aircraft include hardware, acces-
sories, components, and associated software 
for the following major subsystems: 
a. The Pratt and Whitney F135 engine is a 
single 40,000-lb thrust class engine designed 
for the F–35 and assures highly reliable, af-
fordable performance. The engine is designed 
to be utilized in all F–35 variants, providing 
unmatched commonality and supportability 
throughout the worldwide base of F–35 users. 
The STOVL propulsion configuration con-
sists of the main engine, diverterless super-
sonic inlet, a three (3) Bearing Swivel Mod-
ule, Roll Posts and Duct Assembly System, 
and Lift Fan. 
b. The AN/APG–81 Active Electronically 
Scanned Array (AESA) is a high processing 
power/high transmission power electronic 
array capable of detecting air and ground 
targets from a greater distance than me-
chanically scanned array radars. It also con-
tains a synthetic aperture radar (SAR), 
which creates high-resolution ground maps 
and provides weather data to the pilot, and 
provides air and ground tracks to the mis-
sion system, which uses it as a component to 
fuse sensor data. 
c. The Electro-Optical Targeting System 
(EOTS) provides long-range detection and 
tracking as well as an infrared search and 
track (IRST) and forward-looking infrared 
(FLIR) capability for precision tracking, 
weapons delivery, and bomb damage assess-
ment (BDA). The EOTS replaces multiple 
separate internal or podded systems typi-
cally found on legacy aircraft. 
d. The Electro-Optical Distributed Aper-
ture System (EODAS) provides the pilot with 
full spherical coverage for air-to-air and air- 
to-ground threat awareness, day/night vision 
enhancements, a fire control capability, and 
precision tracking of wingmen/friendly air-
craft. The EODAS provides data directly to 
the pilot’s helmet as well as the mission sys-
tem. 
e. The Electronic Warfare (EW) system is a 
reprogrammable, integrated system that 
provides radar warning and electronic sup-
port measures (ESM) along with a fully inte-
grated countermeasures (CM) system. The 
EW system is the primary subsystem used to 
enhance situational awareness, targeting 
support and self-defense through the search, 
intercept, location and identification of in- 
band emitters and to automatically counter 
IR and RF threats. 
f. The Command, Control, Communica-
tions, Computers and Intelligence/Commu-
nications, Navigation, and Identification 
(C4I/CNI) system provides the pilot with un-
matched connectivity to flight members, co-
alition forces, and the battlefield. It is an in-
tegrated subsystem designed to provide a 
broad spectrum of secure, anti-jam voice and 
data communications, precision radio navi-
gation and landing capability, self-identi-
fication, beyond visual range target identi-
fication, 
and 
connectivity 
to 
off-board 
sources of information. It also includes an 
inertial navigation and global positioning 
system (GPS) for precise location informa-
tion. The functionality is tightly integrated 
within the mission system to enhance effi-
ciency. 
g. The aircraft C4I/CNI system includes 
two data links, the Multi-Function Advanced 
Data Link (MADL) and Link 16. The MADL 
is designed specifically for the F–35 and al-
lows for stealthy communications between 
F–35s. Link 16 data link equipment allows 
the F–35 to communicate with legacy air-
craft using widely-distributed J-series mes-
sage protocols. 
h. The F–35 Autonomic Logistics Global 
Sustainment (ALGS) provides a fully inte-
grated logistics management solution. ALGS 
integrates a number of functional areas, in-
cluding supply chain management, repair, 
support equipment, engine support, and 
training. The ALGS infrastructure employs 
a state-of-the-art information system that 
provides real-time, decision-worthy informa-
tion for sustainment decisions by flight line 
personnel. 
Prognostic 
health 
monitoring 
technology is integrated with the air system 
and is crucial to predictive maintenance of 
vital components. 
i. The F–35 Autonomic Logistics Informa-
tion System (ALIS) provides an intelligent 
information infrastructure that binds all the 
key concepts of ALGS into an effective sup-
port system. ALIS establishes the appro-
priate interfaces among the F–35 Air Vehicle, 
the warfighter, the training system, govern-
ment information technology (IT) systems, 
and supporting commercial enterprise sys-
tems. Additionally, ALIS provides a com-
prehensive tool for data collection and anal-
ysis, decision support, and action tracking. 
j. The F–35 Training System includes sev-
eral training devices to provide integrated 
training for pilots and maintainers. The 
pilot training devices include a Full Mission 
Simulator (FMS) and Deployable Mission 
Rehearsal Trainer (DMRT). The maintainer 
training devices include an Aircraft Systems 
Maintenance Trainer (ASMT), Ejection Sys-
tem Maintenance Trainer (ESMT), Outer 
Mold Line (OML) Lab, Flexible Linear 
Shaped Charge (FLSC) Trainer, F135 Engine 
Module Trainer, and Weapons Loading Train-
er (WLT). The F–35 Training System can be 
integrated, where both pilots and maintain-
ers learn in the same Integrated Training 
Center (ITC). Alternatively, the pilots and 
maintainers can train in separate facilities 
(Pilot Training Center and Maintenance 
Training Center). 
k. Other subsystems, features, and capa-
bilities include the F–35’s low observable air 
frame, Integrated Core Processor (ICP) Cen-
tral Computer, Helmet Mounted Display Sys-
tem (HMDS), Pilot Life Support System, Off- 
Board Mission Support (OMS) System, and 
publications/maintenance 
manuals. 
The 
HMDS provides a fully sunlight readable, bi- 
ocular display presentation of aircraft infor-
mation projected onto the pilot’s helmet 
visor. The use of a night vision camera inte-
grated into the helmet eliminates the need 
for separate Night Vision Goggles (NVG). 
The Pilot Life Support System provides a 
measure of Pilot Chemical, Biological, and 
Radiological Protection through use of an 
On-Board 
Oxygen 
Generating 
System 
(OBOGS); and an escape system that pro-
vides additional protection to the pilot. 
OBOGS takes the Power and Thermal Man-
agement System (PTMS) air and enriches it 
by removing gases (mainly nitrogen) by ad-
sorption, thereby increasing the concentra-
tion of oxygen in the product gas and sup-
plying breathable air to the pilot. The OMS 
provides a mission planning, mission brief-
ing, and a maintenance/intelligence/tactical 
debriefing platform for the F–35. 
2. The Reprogramming Center is located in 
the United States and provides F–35 cus-
tomers a means to update F–35 electronic 
warfare databases. 
3. The highest level of classification of in-
formation included in this potential sale is 
SECRET. 
4. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the specific 
hardware and software elements, the infor-
mation could be used to develop counter-
measures that might reduce weapon system 
effectiveness or be used in the development 
of a system with similar or advanced capa-
bilities. 
5. A determination has been made that 
Japan can provide substantially the same de-
gree of protection for the sensitive tech-
nology being released as the U.S. Govern-
ment. This sale is necessary in furthering 
U.S. foreign policy and national security ob-
jectives outlined in the Policy Justification. 
6. All defense articles and services listed in 
this transmittal have been authorized for re-
lease and export to Japan.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION 
Jordan—U–60M Black Hawk Helicopters 
The Government of Jordan has requested 
to buy one (1) UH–60M Black Hawk heli-
copter in standard U.S. Army configuration 
with standard Government Furnished Equip-
ment (GFE), including two (2) T7OO–GE–701D 
engines and one (1) Common Missile Warning 
System. Also included is one (1) AN/APR–39 
Radar Signal Detecting Set; one (1) AN/AVR– 
2B Laser Detecting Set; two (2) AN–ARC–231 
Radios; two (2) AN–ARC–201D Radios; one (1) 
AN/APX–123A Identification Friend or Foe 
(IFF) Transponder; two (2) Embedded Global 
Positioning System with Inertial Navigation 
(EGIs); one (1) Common Missile Warning Sys-
tem User Data Module; Aviation Mission 
Planning System (AMPS); AMPS software 
development and support services; and other 
related elements of logistical, engineering, 
and program support. The estimated total 
cost is $23 million. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy and national security of the United 
States by helping to improve the security of 
a Major Non-NATO Ally that is an important 
force for political stability and economic 
progress in the Middle East. 
The UH–60M will supplement Jordan’s ex-
isting Royal Squadron fleet of Black Hawk 
helicopters and be used to facilitate the 
movement of the Jordanian Royal Family in 
a safe and efficient manner. Jordan already 
has the UH–60M capability and will have no 
difficulty absorbing this equipment and serv-
ices into its armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The principal contractors will be Sikorsky 
Aircraft Company, Stratford, CT and Gen-
eral Electric Aircraft Company, Lynn, MA. 
There are no known offset agreements pro-
posed in connection with this potential sale. 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
not require the assignment of any additional 
U.S. Government or contractor representa-
tives to Jordan. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The UH–60M Black Hawk is an assault/ 
utility helicopter. The UH–60M weapon sys-
tem contains communications and identi-
fication equipment, navigation equipment, 
aircraft survivability equipment, displays, 
and sensors. 
2. The AN/APR–39 Radar Signal Detecting 
Set is a system that provides warning of a 
radar directed air defense threat to allow ap-
propriate countermeasures. This configura-
tion is 1553 data bus compatible. 
3. The AN/AVR–2B Laser Warning Set is a 
passive laser warning system that receives, 
processes, and displays threat information 
resulting from aircraft illumination by la-
sers on a multi-functional display. 
4. The AN–ARC–231 is an airborne Very 
High Frequency/Ultra High Frequency (VHF/ 
UHF) Line-of-Sight (LOS) and Demand As-
signed Multiple Access (DAMA) satellite 
communications 
(SATCOM) 
system. 
The 
ARC–231 
provides 
airborne, 
multi-band, 
multi-mission, secure antijam voice, data, 
and imagery network capable communica-
tions in a compact radio set. 
5. 
The 
AN–ARC–201D 
Single 
Channel 
Ground 
and 
Airborne

System 
(SINCGARS) is a tactical airborne radio sub-
system that provides secure, anti-jam voice 
and data communication. 
6. The AAR–57(V) Common Missile Warning 
System (CMWS) detects threat missiles in 
flight, evaluates potential false alarms, de-
clares validity of threat, and selects appro-
priate Infrared Countermeasures (IRCM). 
The system includes Electro-Optical Missile 
Sensors, an Electronic Control Unit (ECU), 
Sequencer, and Improved Countermeasures 
Dispenser (ICMD).

or Foe (IFF) Transponder is a space diversity 
transponder and is installed on various mili-
tary platforms. When installed in conjunc-
tion with platform antennas and the Remote 
Control Unit (or other appropriate control 
unit), the transponder provides identifica-
tion, altitude, and surveillance reporting in 
response to interrogations from airborne, 
ground-based and/or surface interrogators. 
9. The Common Missile Warning System 
(CMWS) User Data Module (UDM) is a re-
movable Personal Computer Memory Card 
International Association (PCMCIA) module 
that is installed in the UDM housing on the 
CMWS ECU. The UDM contains the Oper-
ational Flight Program (OFP), aircraft, 
threat/countermeasure file library, and mis-
sion specific information used in the embed-
ded system. 
10. The Aviation Mission Planning System 
(AMPS) is a hardware and software solution 
that provides state of the art mission plan-
ning tools to enhance situational awareness, 
command and control, and safety of aircraft 
pilots and aviation commanders. The system 
provides a suite of applications that allow 
users to perform task such as plot flight 
path waypoints, compute distance and fuel 
requirements, calculate aircraft configura-
tion against weight and balance limits and 
perform flight safety validations, and gen-
erate briefing materials or pilot information 
kits. 
11. The highest level of classification of de-
fense articles, components, and services in-
cluded in this potential sale is SECRET. 
12. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the specific 
hardware and software elements, the infor-
mation could be used to develop counter-
measures which might reduce weapon system 
effectiveness or be used in the development 
of a system with similar or advanced capa-
bilities. 
13. This sale is necessary in furtherance of 
the U.S. foreign policy and national security 
objectives outlined in the Policy Justifica-
tion. A determination has been made that 
Jordan can provide substantially the same 
degree of protection for the sensitive tech-
nology being released as the U.S. Govern-
ment. 
14. All defense articles and services listed 
in this transmittal have been authorized for 
release and export to Jordan.

copters to Lithuania will significantly in-
crease its capability to provide troop lift, 
border security, anti-terrorist, medical evac-
uation, search and rescue, re-supply/external 
lift, combat support in all weather. These 
UH–60 helicopters will allow for interoper-
ability with U.S. and NATO forces in rapid 
response to a variety of missions and quick 
positioning of troops with minimal heli-
copter assets. 
Lithuania intends to use these defense ar-
ticles and services to modernize and expand 
its armed forces to provide multi-mission 
support in its region and combat terrorism 
threats. Lithuania will have no difficulty ab-
sorbing these helicopters into its armed 
forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment will 
not alter the basic military balance in the 
region.

hardware and software elements, the infor-
mation could be used to develop counter-
measures that might reduce weapon system 
effectiveness or be used in the development 
of a system with similar or advanced capa-
bilities. 
4. A determination has been made that the 
Republic of the Philippines can provide sub-
stantially the same degree of protection for 
the sensitive technology being released as 
the U.S. Government. This sale is necessary 
in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and 
national security objectives outlined in the 
Policy Justification. 
5. All defense articles and services listed in

(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The Patriot Air Defense System con-
tains classified SECRET components and 
critical/sensitive technology. The Patriot 
Advanced Capability–3 (PAC–3) Missile Four 
Pack is classified CONFIDENTIAL. With the 
incorporation of the PAC–3 missile, the Pa-
triot system will continue to hold a signifi-
cant technological lead over other surface- 
to-air missile systems in the world. 
2. The PAC–3 Missile sensitive/critical 
technology is in the area of design and pro-
duction know-how and primarily inherent in 
the design, development, and/or manufac-
turing data related to certain components. 
Information on system performance capabili-
ties and effectiveness, select software docu-
mentation, and test data are classified up to 
SECRET. 
3. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of hardware and 
software elements, the information could be 
used to develop countermeasures or equiva-
lent systems, which might reduce system ef-
fectiveness or be used in the development of 
a system with similar or advanced capabili-
ties. 
4. A determination has been made that the 
recipient can provide substantially the same 
degree of protection for the sensitive tech-
nology being released as the U.S. Govern-
ment. This sale is necessary in furtherance 
of the U.S. foreign policy and national secu-
rity objectives outlined in the Policy Jus-
tification. 
5. All defense articles and services listed in 
this transmittal have been authorized for re-
lease and export to the recipient.
