CONGRATULATING 
EUGENE 
‘‘GENE’’ MOY ON BEING AWARD-
ED THE CONGRESSIONAL GOLD 
MEDAL 
HON. ADAM SMITH 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 21, 2020 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, 
I rise to honor and recognize Eugene ‘‘Gene’’ 
Moy for his courageous service to our country 
during World War II and celebrate him being 
awarded the Congressional Gold Medal. 
Gene Moy is a Chinese American veteran 
who accepted the call to serve his country 
without hesitation. Gene served in the Pacific 
on New Caledonia, Guadalcanal, and the Phil-
ippines. However, like so many minorities, 
Chinese American veterans did not receive 
the recognition they deserved for their service. 
Gene, who the Chinese American Citizens 
Alliance said is the oldest living Chinese 
American World War II veteran, recently 
turned 103 years old and was finally awarded 
the Congressional Gold Medal, an honor he 
should have received long ago. He had 
planned on traveling to Washington DC to at-
tend a ceremony to receive his medal. Unfor-
tunately, the global health crisis has caused 
the ceremony to be postponed. 
Madam Speaker, it is with great admiration 
and gratitude that I recognize Gene Moy on 
being awarded the Congressional Gold Medal 
and honor all Chinese American veterans for 
their distinguished service to our country dur-
ing World War II. 
f 
RECOGNIZING MARY BALDWIN 
HON. LOIS FRANKEL 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 21, 2020 
Ms. FRANKEL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Mary Baldwin, a local hero 
from Florida’s 21st Congressional District who 
has gone above and beyond for students in 
our community. 
Mary has worked at Wellington Landing 
Middle School since 1999, and currently 
serves as their Exceptional Student Education 
(ESE) Administrator and Assistant Principal. 
As an educator of over 35 years, Mary is 
known for going the extra mile with her stu-
dents, often counseling her kids all the way 
through their time at Wellington Landing and 
sometimes even keeping in touch with them 
through high school and beyond. During the 
COVID–19 public health crisis, Mary has gone 
even further to support our local students by 
establishing a summer school program de-
signed to support 8th graders who struggled 
with the new distance learning protocols im-
plemented during the spring semester. Mary 
worked one-on-one with each student in the 
program and everyone enrolled was able to 
pass and move on to high school. 
Mary’s selflessness and compassion during 
this difficult time is truly humbling. Her out-
standing work has touched countless lives, 
and I am so thankful for her dedication to our 
community. I am proud to honor her today. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF ROLAND JOHNSON 
HON. DEBRA A. HAALAND 
OF NEW MEXICO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 21, 2020 
Ms. HAALAND. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great pride and deep sadness that I rise to 
honor my dear friend and former Governor of 
the Pueblo of Laguna, Roland Johnson. I join 
his family and our shared Laguna Pueblo 
community in honoring his memory and life’s 
work, which he always dedicated to helping 
others. 
Throughout his career in public service, Ro-
land led by example, always doing the most to 
elevate the Laguna Pueblo culture and tradi-
tions that he cherished. At age 22, he was 
elected Secretary of the Pueblo and was the 
youngest person yet elected to office. In the 
years that followed, he went on to join the 
Federal Service, serving the Southwest Bu-
reau of Indian Affairs region intermittently for 
30 years. In between this service, Roland led 
his people as Governor for three terms (1975 
through 1977, 1995 through 1998, and 2003 
through 2006). 
While in office, Governor Roland Johnson 
bolstered Laguna’s economic standing and 
supported job creation by opening an elec-
tronics component manufacturing plant. Ro-
land also worked diligently to preserve Laguna 
traditions through his fluency of our Native 
Keres language. Governor Johnson incor-
porated this gift into the work he did with out-
side partnerships so that the tribe’s interests 
were always at the center of decision-making 
processes. 
A born leader, Roland Johnson has left a 
lasting impression on our Laguna Pueblo and 
has inspired a long and growing list of current 
and future tribal leaders. This is thanks not 
only to his ability to make respectful and prac-
tical decisions, but also to his use of traditional 
values to guide his professional career. 
His legacy is rooted in the importance of 
education: by cultivating a solid foundation in 
the Pueblo tradition, he dedicated his career 
to both preserving Pueblo culture and creating 
opportunities for the Laguna people close to 
home. Additionally while in office, Governor 
Johnson responded to the need for graduate 
education support by implementing the La-
guna Graduate Scholarship Program. 
He will be remembered as an historical vi-
sionary—someone who always looked to the 
past to guide his plans for the future. I send 
my deepest condolences to Roland Johnson’s 
family and friends. 
CONGRATULATING DR. MULATU 
LEMMA AND MS. MEGAN HEBERLE 
HON. EARL L. ‘‘BUDDY’’ CARTER 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 21, 2020 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to congratulate two incredible 
teachers and mentors, Dr. Mulatu Lemma of 
Savannah, Georgia, and Ms. Megan Heberle 
of Savannah, Georgia. 
Dr. Lemma received a Presidential Award 
for Excellence in Science, Mathematics, and 
Engineering Mentoring, or PAESMEM, and 
Ms. Megan Heberle received one of the Presi-
dential Awards for Excellence in Mathematics 
and Science Teaching, or the PAEMST. 
PAESMEM and PAEMST are both adminis-
tered by the National Science Foundation on 
behalf of the White House Office of Science 
and Technology Policy. 
These awards recognize outstanding teach-
ing and mentoring efforts that enhance the 
participation and retention of individuals who 
might not otherwise have considered or had 
access to opportunities in science, technology, 
engineering, and mathematics, or STEM. 
Each awardee receives a certificate signed 
by the President, a $10,000 award from NSF, 
and a trip to Washington, DC. 
Because of his wealth of knowledge, Dr. 
Lemma was designated as a Distinguished 
Professor through Savannah State University 
in 2011. 
In 2013, he received the prestigious title of 
Georgia Professor of the Year and recently 
became one of the most awarded professors 
in the state of Georgia. 
Ms. Heberle has also excelled at teaching 
science and coordinated the scientific re-
search program at Islands High School for six 
years. 
Currently, she teaches Scientific Research 
and Zoology to 9th through 12th grade stu-
dents. STEM fields are critical to our nation’s 
health and prosperity, so it is imperative to 
have leaders like Dr. Lemma and Ms. Heberle 
guiding and supporting our leaders of tomor-
row. 
They both have made an everlasting impact 
on countless students, and I know they will 
continue to inspire many more. I am thankful 
for Dr. Lemma and Ms. Heberle’s steadfast 
commitment to their students. 
I wish them both the best of luck in the 
years to come.

REMEMBERING AND HONORING 
PAUL OSTERMAN 
HON. EARL L. ‘‘BUDDY’’ CARTER 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 21, 2020 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in remembrance of Paul Osterman 
of Savannah, Georgia, who passed away at 
the age of 58. 
Paul was born in Utica, New York, and 
earned his Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in 
music. He earned a degree in computer 
science from SUNY IT, Utica, as well. 
After school, he went on to work for General 
Electric, Utica, and the United States Air Force 
Research Lab. 
Music was the epicenter of Paul’s life start-
ing from a young age when he took his first 
music lessons. 
He brought joy, inspiration, and peace to ev-
eryone he performed for with his exceptional 
gift in playing the piano and organ. 
Paul was extremely dedicated to local and 
professional theatre groups, and even worked 
briefly in New York City where he worked with 
renowned musicians like Gene Simmons. 
He was also dedicated to serving the church 
as an organist for both the United Methodist 
Church in New Hartford, New York, and Wes-
ley Oaks Methodist Church in Savannah. 
Paul met his lovely wife, Jacquelin Jones, 
through theatre, and they ran the Hartford 
Players Youth Theatre in Utica for many 
years. 
He was known for his encouragement of 
others, countless wry jokes, his love of cross-
word puzzles, and his optimistic view and love 
of life. 
Paul was a family man and loved his family 
deeply. Although he is not with us any longer, 
his light will continue to shine. 
IN CELEBRATION OF DEDE ABTS’ 
100TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. GREG PENCE 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 21, 2020 
Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor a mother, friend and fellow Hoosier, Vir-
ginia ‘‘Dede’’ Abts, who will be celebrating her 
100th birthday on August 20, 2020. 
After graduating from Indiana University in 
1942 with a degree in Spanish, Dede became 
a cultural asset in my hometown community of 
Columbus, Indiana. 
Dede is a true philanthropist and a pillar of 
the community. As the co-founder of Uncom-
mon Cause, Dede inspires hope in others 
while supporting the Columbus Area Arts 
Council. 
Columbus is a better place to live because 
of the work that Dede has done throughout 
her life. I am proud to join the Columbus com-
munity in recognizing Dede’s accomplishments 
and I wish her many more healthy years. 
Happy 100th Birthday, Dede.

HONORING 
FREDERICK 
‘‘FRED’’ 
WILLIAM 
KRAMER III 
HON. EARL L. ‘‘BUDDY’’ CARTER 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 21, 2020 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in remembrance of Frederick, or 
Fred, William Kramer III of Georgia’s First 
Congressional District, who passed away on 
June 26th. 
Fred was a born and raised Savannahian 
who loved Coastal Georgia and spent as 
much time as he could on the water. 
Because he was the son of a veteran, Fred 
cherished the opportunities he had to travel 
post-war Europe as a boy and live in Zargoza, 
Spain. 
Fred turned down Ivy League colleges to at-
tend the University of Georgia and become a 
Georgia Bulldog like his mother. After college, 
he received his Juris Doctorate from the Uni-
versity of Georgia. 
He often spoke of his time in Athens—in-
cluding walking to the Varsity, living in the Joe 
Brown dorm, and the fun times he had in col-
lege and in law school. Fred started his law 
career in private practice and then moved to 
the Chatham County District Attorney’s office. 
He joined the esteemed Department of Justice 
in 1980. 
Fred was a leader in his practice of law, and 
trained many young attorneys in his role as 
senior litigation counsel. In recent years, he 
was a docent at the Mighty Eighth Air Force 
museum, and he deeply enjoyed educating 
the public about the experience of soldiers, 
the value of understanding history, and the 
value of a vote. 
He lived a life deeply caring for others, and 
was generous in caring for orphans and wid-
ows—and he did it humbly. 
Everyone who knew him will miss his sense 
of humor, eccentric ways, colorful stories, pas-
sion for learning, and encouragement. 
He will be greatly missed, but his legacy will 
continue for countless years to come. 
My thoughts and prayers are with his family 
and friends during this most difficult time.

HONORING THE LIFE OF CLAIRE 
SHULMAN 
HON. GRACE MENG 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 21, 2020 
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, l rise today to 
honor the life of Claire Shulman for her tire-
less work in leading the people of Queens. 
Claire was the first woman to serve as the 
Queens Borough President. As borough presi-
dent, she fought to champion a quality life for 
all people in Queens. Claire made sure we 
had access to good jobs, quality infrastructure, 
safe housing, and so much more. Her work 
had a tremendous impact on the lives of 
countless individuals and she continued to im-
prove Queens beyond her capacity as the 
Borough President. Claire Shulman was noth-
ing short of a trailblazer. 
Not only was Claire impactful to Queens, 
she was an outstanding mentor and friend to 
me as well. She believed strongly in empow-
ering women and fighting for our representa-
tion in public service and leadership—before it 
was popular to do so. Claire believed in me, 
and I am forever grateful for her encourage-
ment and kindness. 
I was fortunate to speak to Claire recently. 
The last thing she said to me was, ‘‘I want to 
thank you for your excellent work in Wash-
ington and tell you how proud I am of you.’’ I 
cannot explain how touching it was to hear 
these words from an amazing woman like 
Claire, who fought for the lives of every one of 
my constituents. I hope we can all learn a les-
son from the empathy and care she exhibited 
every day. 
Claire was born in Brooklyn in 1926 and 
graduated from Adelphi University on Long Is-
land. She worked as a registered nurse and 
met her husband, the late Dr. Melvin Shulman, 
at Queens Hospital Center. While living in 
Bayside in the 1960s, she led both Community 
Board 11 in Bayside and the Queens Commu-
nity Boards. Claire passed away this week 
from pancreatic cancer, surrounded by her 
family. 
Claire’s 
leadership 
undoubtedly 
made 
Queens a better place. I urge my colleagues 
to rise with me to celebrate the life of Claire 
Shulman.

away on August 2nd at the age of 65. 
Terry and I graduated from the University of 
Georgia’s College of Pharmacy together, and

macies, where he always served others with a 
kind and selfless heart.

Terry took his heart for serving others out-
side of his work as a pharmacist, as well. He 
was an avid supporter of the Habersham 
YMCA where he volunteered as a lifeguard 
and was active in the Leadership Club. 
One of his greatest passions was scuba div-
ing, and he went to some of the most incred-
ible diving locations. 
I always loved hearing about his trips and 
discoveries. 
Terry was a true Georgia Bulldog fan 
throughout the years, and I was glad to have 
him by my side to cheer on the Dawgs to-
gether. 
He was also a member of the Georgia Phar-
macy Association, and was a true leader in 
the pharmacy field. 
His lovely wife, Susan, two amazing chil-
dren, Alexander and Addison, are especially in 
my thoughts and prayers during this time as 
they grieve the loss of such a wonderful man.

IN MEMORY OF PAUL MCEACHERN 
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 21, 2020 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Paul McEachern, a Navy veteran, 
lawyer, and public servant who passed away 
this week at 82. A lifelong resident of Ports-
mouth, Paul will be remembered as a pillar of 
his community and a tireless fighter for social 
and economic justice. 
Paul served in the Navy from 1956 to 1960 
before returning home to attend college at the 
University of New Hampshire. He then at-
tended law school and went on to practice law 
for over fifty years, litigating numerous pivotal 
public access cases. Paul was a founding 
member of the New Hampshire Young Demo-
crats, an organization that has become instru-
mental in training and electing young, progres-
sive Granite Staters. A dedicated public serv-
ant, Paul served as a five term New Hamp-
shire State Representative, Portsmouth City 
Councilor, legal counselor to Governor Hugh 
Gallen, and a two-time Democratic guber-
natorial nominee. As a leader, Paul never sac-
rificed his integrity and exemplified the best of 
what our public officials should strive to be. 
Paul was engaged across the full spectrum 
of public life, serving as President of the New 
Hampshire Bar Association, Chair of the New 
Hampshire Bar Foundation, Chair of the Ports-
mouth Library Board of Trustees, Trustee of 
the Trust Funds of the City of Portsmouth, and 
member of the Board of Directors of the USS 
Albacore Museum. He demonstrated an out-
standing commitment to his community and is 
remembered for his courage, conviction, and 
integrity. 
On behalf of all my constituents in New 
Hampshire’s First Congressional District, I 
share my gratitude for Paul’s decades of de-
voted public service and offer my condolences 
to Paul’s wife Shaun and their five children. 
May Paul McEachern’s memory be a blessing. 
CONGRATULATING TROY BLAND 
HON. EARL L. ‘‘BUDDY’’ CARTER 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 21, 2020 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize and congratulate Troy 
Bland with Bland Farms, LLC for being ap-
pointed to the USDA Fruit and Vegetable In-
dustry Advisory Committee. He and 12 others 
join 12 other members who were re-appointed. 
The Fruit and Vegetable Industry Advisory 
Committee advises the secretary of agriculture 
on issues that affect the industry. 
Headquartered in Glennville, Georgia, Bland 
Farms is the largest grower, packer, and ship-
per of sweet onions in the United States. They 
represent roughly one quarter of the entire 
Vidalia sweet onion volume and have the larg-
est controlled-environment storage capacity in 
the industry. Additionally, Bland Farms was 
the first company in the industry to market 
sweet onions year-round. 
Troy grew up working the farm with both his 
father and grandfather and he knew from a 
very young age that his dream, like his fa-
ther’s, was to carry on the family business. He 
now serves as Chief Operating Officer, and 
works alongside his brother, Landis. 
His hard work, dedication, and commitment 
has allowed the family business to thrive. Con-
gratulations, again. I wish Troy the best in his 
new position.

HONORING THE LIFE OF WILLIAM 
HAROLD ‘‘SONNY’’ FLOWERS, JR. 
HON. JOE NEGUSE 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 21, 2020 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, last month, 
Colorado lost one its most brilliant legal minds, 
a mentor treasured by generations of lawyers 
and Coloradans, Mr. William Harold ‘‘Sonny’’ 
Flowers, Jr. 
Sonny was raised in Boulder, Colorado by 
his mother Ruth and father William Harold, Sr. 
Since his days as a university student in the 
1960’s, Sonny was a fierce, vocal advocate for 
social justice and racial equality. This was a 
commitment he kept throughout his life by 
traveling our state to recruit students of color, 
helping to establish CU Boulder’s Black Alum-
ni Association, and creating an endowed 
scholarship for students of color at both Colo-
rado Law and the University of Denver. 
Sonny is remembered not only for his intel-
ligence and commitment to justice, but also 
his great kindness, radiant laughter, and the 
kinship he formed with those great many peo-
ple he encouraged and guided throughout his 
lifetime. I count myself so lucky to have been 
among the countless individuals that Sonny 
supported, and can say with certainty that I 
would not be where I am today without both 
the great many paths he forged on my behalf 
and his caring, devoted mentorship. 
Sonny’s legacy will be felt by those through-
out the Boulder community and the whole of 
Colorado. I share my deepest condolences 
with Sonny’s wife Pam, his entire family, and 
all those whom he impacted throughout his 
lifetime. 
Let us remember Sonny by one of the last 
messages he sent to a friend: ‘‘With enough 
voices, mountains may indeed be moved!’’ 
Sonny certainly moved mountains for each 
of us, and it is in his honor that we continue 
to champion the justice and equality for which 
he dedicated so much.

Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to remember and honor Martin L. 
‘‘M.L.’’ Coffer, who passed away on June 23 
at the age of 83. 
M.L was a lifelong resident of Fleming who 
loved the Lord, his family, and farming with his 
whole heart. He was a faithful member of Mt. 
Olivet United Methodist Church, and held sev-
eral positions. M.L. always served others with 
such kindness and sincerity everywhere he 
went. 
He met his lovely wife, Beverly Black, in 
Clarkesville when he attended the North Geor-
gia 
Trade 
and 
Vocational 
School 
in 
Clarkesville on a baseball and basketball 
scholarship. M.L. worked at Savannah Electric 
and Power Company for 15 years and retired 
from Coastal Utilities after 33 years of service. 
He was the first President and charter mem-
ber of the Liberty Coastal Lions Club, First 
Citizens Bank Board of Directors, Soil and 
Water Conservation Board, Resource Con-
servation and Development Board, and Liberty 
Hunting Club. 
M.L. was also Chairman of the Liberty 
County Commissioners for 16 years and Sec-
retary and Treasury of the Coastal EMC Board 
of Directors. He owned BevMar Logging and 
BevMar farms, as well. 
He was a fearless leader and a cowboy at 
heart. He will be greatly missed, but his legacy 
will live on for countless years to come. 
My thoughts and prayers are with his family 
and friends during this most difficult time.

a time when our country is reeling from racial 
injustice and seeking to address police bru-
tality, Mr. Johnson and his team marched side

This past June, DeeJay organized a Black 
Lives Matter protest for marchers to walk in 
support of the movement in North County San 
Diego. During the protest, marchers raised 
concerns to DeeJay of a young white male in 
military-style gear carrying a knife and acting 
uneasy while walking with the group. DeeJay

a few minutes of defusing the situation, the 
16-year-old handed over the knife from his 
pocket. 
We are seeing millions of Americans all 
over the nation demanding accountability and 
comprehensive reform to a system that has al-
lowed police brutality and injustice against 
people of color for generations. Amidst the 
united uprising across the country, peaceful 
protesters voices are being drowned out by 
those seeking to dismantle the movement with 
unrest and violence. DeeJay’s mission is to 
not only inspire young people to get involved 
in change, but to emphasize using their voices 
and actions peacefully. 
With these goals in mind, the scenario that 
occurred with the young man was a lesson for 
many involved. The defused scene created a 
learning opportunity to display how we can all 
work cohesively together, and most impor-
tantly, to work towards a better and more just 
future for all Americans. 
I launched a Constituent of the Month pro-
gram to recognize individuals who have gone 
above and beyond to make our region and our 
country a stronger place for everyone to live 
and thrive. As our nation and community 
works toward long overdue racial change and 
healing, voices like DeeJay’s must be lifted 
and heard. I am honored to recognize Mr. 
Johnson as my Constituent of the Month, and 
I thank him for being a prominent role model 
in amplifying racial justice in our community 
during a critical time of change for America.

Friday, August 21, 2020 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to remember and honor Emma 
Morel Adler, who passed away on July 12 at 
the age of 90. 
Emma was a native Savannahian and at-
tended the Pape School, where she estab-
lished a firm foundation in the Arts and Hu-
manities as well as developing many life-long 
friendships. She later attended Bryn Mawr 
College in Pennsylvania, where she received 
a BA in French in 1952. 
After returning back to Savannah, Emma 
was a reporter at the Savannah Morning 
News. She married her beloved husband, Lee, 
who was also a native Savannahian, in 1953 
and they had two children. 
Lee and Emma were married for more than 
50 years before Lee passed away in 2012. 
Emma loved her family with all of her heart, 
and was a faithful mother and wife. She also 
loved her city of Savannah, and was devoted 
to advocating for it and its preservation. Emma 
was a volunteer for numerous boards, includ-
ing The Junior League of Savannah, the Sa-
vannah-Chatham County Board of Public Edu-
cation, the Georgia Humanities Council, the 
National Federation of Humanities Council, 
Historic Savannah Foundation, the Telfair Mu-
seum, and the Ossabaw Island Foundation. 
She was also a member of the Georgia His-
torical Society and The National Trust for His-
toric Preservation. Emma was a natural born 
leader, and she served as President of the 
Friends of Massie Committee, Savannah’s old-
est public school. 
Her love for history, art, music, and her fam-
ily made Savannah better. I am immensely 
grateful for all the work she did to preserve 
Savannah’s beautiful history. She will be 
deeply missed.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE INTER-
NATIONAL 
ASSOCIATION 
OF 
DRILLING CONTRACTORS 
HON. HENRY CUELLAR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 21, 2020 
Mr. CUELLAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to commend the International Association of 
Drilling Contractors on its 80th anniversary as 
a trade association. 
In 1940, the International Association of 
Drilling Contractors, commonly known as 
IADC, was formed to address the need for a 
collective voice advocating for the interests of 
the oil and natural gas contract drilling indus-
try. Since then, IADC has been the world’s 
leader in developing drilling safety protocol 
and standard operating procedures. 
Over the past 80 years, IADC has been in-
strumental in shaping the upstream oil and 
gas industry. In 1947, IADC began sponsoring 
industry training for college students, and by 
1962 had developed the Incidents Statistics 
Program (ISP), an industry-leading safety inci-
dent reporting program that is still in operation 
today. In 1968, IADC led the publication of the 
Accident Prevention Manual and standardized 
the color-coding of oilfield servicing equip-
ment. In 1983, IADC held the first joint Society 
of Petroleum Engineers/IADC Drilling Tech-
nology Conference, which persists today as an 
annual event, and in 1994 introduced the 
RigPass program to help service companies 
assure their field personnel are properly 
grounded in the basics of rig operations and 
safety. IADC also introduced the industry’s 
Competence Assurance Accreditation (CAA) 
program, circa 2004, which assures field per-
sonnel possess the necessary knowledge, 
skills and abilities required to function safely in 
the oilfield. These are just a few examples of 
the initiatives IADC has undertaken to make 
the oil field a safe and prosperous place to op-
erate. 
Today, IADC continues to exemplify the 
ideal model of leadership and remains com-
mitted to teaching the core values of safety, 
environmental stewardship, and continuous 
improvement of technology to generation after 
generation of America’s energy workforce. 
Over the years, IADC has maintained 1,000 
plus members worldwide, seventeen regional 
chapters, seven student chapters, and has ac-
credited the training of nearly 2 million per-
sons employed in the oil and gas industry, the 
vast majority of which have been hardworking 
Texans. Headquartered in Houston, IADC 
itself is part of Texas’ vibrant energy sector. 
With nearly 300 members companies in-state, 
IADC plays a critical role in the production of 
Texas’ 3.6 million barrels of oil per day. 
Additionally, IADC’s compendium of indus-
try-leading reference media and periodical re-
sources informs more than 1.5 million industry 
stakeholders each year and the global dis-
tribution of these materials has been crucial to 
informing national authorities charged with de-
veloping vital compliance initiatives for oil and 
gas industry activities worldwide. 
I would like to extend my gratitude to the 
International Association of Drilling Contractors 
for eighty years of unwavering competence, 
professionalism, and commitment in support of 
the transformational drilling industry that sus-
tains the energy intensive demands of our 
modem society. 
Madam Speaker, again I recognize the 80th 
anniversary of the International Association of 
Drilling Contractors.

pharmacy’s closing in 2009. 
He took his leadership skills to new heights 
when he served as President of Georgia Phar-
macy Association from 1995 to 1997. He also 
served as Vice-chair of the Whitfield County 
Board of Health. 
I had the honor of working alongside him for 
a few years when he served as a Georgia 
State Representative. Although pharmacy was 
his core focus, he loved his family more than 
anything. He was affectionately known as 
‘‘Papa Bruce’’ to his 7 grandchildren, and was 
a dedicated father and husband, as well. 
As a pharmacist myself, I can attest to 
Bruce’s heartfelt dedication to his work as a 
pharmacist. He truly cared about the profes-
sion, and served every patient with the best of 
his abilities. Bruce will be deeply missed. My 
thoughts and prayers go out to his friends, 
family, and patients during this most difficult 
time.

RECOGNIZING MELISSA DAVISON 
HON. LOIS FRANKEL 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 21, 2020 
Ms. FRANKEL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Melissa Davison, a local 
hero from Florida’s 21st Congressional District 
who has gone above and beyond as a 
healthcare worker both before and during the 
COVID–19 pandemic. 
Melissa began her nursing career nearly 35 
years ago at Humana Hospital, which would 
later become JFK Medical Center. After tem-
porarily leaving to get her master’s degree, 
Melissa came back to JFK in 2006 as their In-
fection Prevention Coordinator. Since being in 
this role, Melissa has overseen JFK’s entire 
infection control programming through H1N1, 
Ebola, and now COVID–19. From March 
through May, Melissa worked for two months 
straight, including nights and weekends, mak-
ing sure hospital policies and procedures fol-
lowed the most up-to-date regulations per

Melissa’s selflessness and compassion dur-

and I am so thankful for her dedication to our 
community. I am proud to honor her today.

RECOGNIZING PEPSICO 
HON. EARL L. ‘‘BUDDY’’ CARTER 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 21, 2020 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize PepsiCo for being 
awarded the Excellency in Disability Inclusion 
Award from the U.S. Department of Labor. 
They were given the highest level of 
achievement under this program—the Gold 
Award. PepsiCo was chosen because it 
showed the company proactively recruits, 
hires, retains, and advances individuals with 
disabilities not only to comply, but excel by 
making this a part of the PepsiCo brand. They 
truly set a positive example for companies 
across the U.S. 
It is imperative that companies foster the 
spirit of disability inclusion, and I am encour-
aged 
by 
their 
efforts. 
This 
momentous 
achievement was made possible by ‘‘Pepsi 
Achieving 
Change 
Together,’’ 
or 
the 
PepsiACT. 
The PepsiAct is Pepsi’s formal partnership 
with Disability Solutions at Ability Beyond, 
which is a nonprofit specializing in corporate 
disability recruiting programs. 
In the year ahead, PepsiCo will participate 
in a ‘‘Year of Engagement’’ program to share 
their best practices and encourage other em-
ployers to adopt them.

REMEMBERING 
AND 
HONORING 
JUDGE ASBURY QUILLIAN BALD-
WIN, JR. 
HON. EARL L. ‘‘BUDDY’’ CARTER 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 21, 2020 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
in such a time as this, we need to honor and 
remember the people who have made our 
country great. Judge Asbury Quillian Baldwin 
Jr. of LaGrange, Georgia was certainly one of 
them. 
Judge Baldwin was a man of many gifts and 
talents. He was a highly respected attorney 
who eventually became partner and owner at 
the law firm Baldwin & Mallory in LaGrange. 
He was also named Juvenile Court Judge of 
Troup County. 
A lifelong love of law and politics culminated 
in his election to the Georgia State Senate 
where he held numerous important positions 
like assistant floor leader, chairman of the 
Senate Judiciary Committee, and vice chair-
man of the Rules Committee. Judge Baldwin 
was eventually appointed as Judge of the Su-
perior Court for the Coweta Judicial Circuit. 
He was committed to every position he 
held—from judge and state senator to friend 
and loving family man. All the esteemed posi-
tions he held and his amazing accomplish-
ments allowed him to positively impact many, 
but it was his impeccable character and heart 
for others that marked his life. 
His family, friends, and all those impacted 
by him will be in my thoughts and prayers dur-
ing this most difficult time.
