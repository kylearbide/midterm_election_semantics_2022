PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick 
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: 
Merciful God, we give You thanks for 
giving us another year. 
We ask Your blessing upon the Mem-
bers of this people’s House as they re-
convene for the Second Session of the 
116th Congress. May they anticipate 
the opportunities and difficulties that 
are before them, and before so many 
Americans, with steadfast determina-
tion to work together toward solutions 
that will benefit their countrymen. 
Grant that they be worthy of the re-
sponsibilities they have been given by 
their constituents and truly be the peo-
ple You have called them to be. May 
the walls of disagreement that have di-
vided this assembly be put aside and 
replaced by a spirit of respect and dig-
nity and, where needed, cooperation. 
May Your spirit, O God, be in all of 
our hearts and minds and encourage us 
to do the works of peace and justice, 
now and always. 
May all that we do be done for Your 
greater honor and glory. 
Amen.

RESIGNATION FROM THE HOUSE 
OF REPRESENTATIVES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following resigna-
tion from the House of Representa-
tives: 
JANUARY 7, 2020. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MADAM SPEAKER: I write to inform 
you of my resignation, effective close of 
business on January 13, 2020. as United 
States Representative for the 50th District of 
California. Attached is a copy of the letter I 
submitted to the Governor of California. 
Since the day I joined the Marines in the 
aftermath of 9/11, I have had the honor of 
serving my country, both at home and 
abroad. After three tours of duty in Iraq and 
Afghanistan, I was elected to the House and 
brought with me the lessons I learned during 
my service in the Marine Corps and the val-
ues instilled by my father who held this seat 
before me. Growing up in East County San 
Diego, I learned from an early age the impor-
tance of liberty, the value of patriotism, and 
what a strong and secure border can bring to 
a community. 
During my time in Congress. I had the 
privilege of helping thousands of individuals 
in my district—from making sure veterans 
received the benefits they earned, to helping 
Social Security and Medicare recipients cut 
through red tape, to assisting immigrants 
seeking legal citizenship, and countless oth-
ers going up against the IRS, ATF or other 
government agencies. 
I also sought to enact policies that will 
make our country better off. As Chairman of 
the Early Childhood, Elementary and Sec-
ondary Education Subcommittee, I worked 
to enhance student outcomes and empower 
parents with greater choice in where they 
send their children to school. I was also a 
strong advocate for college transparency and 
introduced the Student Right to Know Be-
fore You Go Act, which would give parents 
and students a better understanding of col-
lege costs and possible outcomes. 
As Chairman of the Coast Guard and Mari-
time 
Transportation 
Subcommittee, 
I 
worked to protect the Jones Act and ensure 
that our country has a strong maritime in-
dustrial base, including a skilled pool of 
American shipyard workers and mariners 
that would form the backbone of our re-
sponse to any maritime conflict. I pushed 
the Coast Guard to act like the military 
service that it is, and made it a priority to 
modernize our nation’s ice breaker fleet, 
which is critical for our nation’s continued 
access to the artic. 
Perhaps the contribution I am most proud 
of is giving a voice to our men and women in 
uniform. As a Member of the House Armed 
Services Committee, I brought attention to 
inefficient military programs and worked to 
make sure our war fighters had the resources 
they needed to carry out their mission. I 
helped shine light on a broken military 
awards process that failed to recognize true 
heroism, and I fought for warriors like Clint 
Lorance, Eddie Gallagher and Matt Golsteyn 
that were treated unjustly by an abusive 
military justice system. I will always be 
proud to stand with the men and women who 
protect our freedoms. 
It has been an honor to serve the people of 
California’s 50th District, and I greatly ap-
preciate the trust they have put in me over 
these last 11 years. 
Sincerely, 
DUNCAN HUNTER, 
Member of Congress.

PRAISING UNSUNG HEROES OF 
JERSEY CITY SHOOTING 
(Mr. PAYNE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to praise the unsung heroes of 
the terrible shooting in Jersey City, 
New Jersey, last month. 
When tragedy strikes a community, 
we all hear about the criminals who 
committed the horrible acts. Only now 
and then do we hear about the heroes 
who risked their lives to save others. 
In Jersey City, it was heroes like 
Sergeant Majorie Jordan. She walked 
into the line of fire to pull a wounded 
police officer to safety. 
Heroes like Anayah Bey; she cared 
for one of the shooting victims until 
help arrived. 
These are two of the many stories of 
individual bravery, from officers and 
civilians alike, that happen during na-
tional tragedies like Jersey City. These 
unsung heroes represent the best of 
America during the worst of times, and 
they deserve our thanks and praise. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
join me in recognizing these brave and 
honorable citizens and their care for 
their fellow man. 
f 
TRANSMIT ARTICLES OF 
IMPEACHMENT TO SENATE 
(Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to ask the Demo-
cratic leadership to answer the ques-
tion from my constituents as to why 
the Articles of Impeachment were not 
yet transmitted to the Senate. 
It was urgent enough to have the 
first-ever partisan articles pass this in-
stitution almost 3 weeks ago but not 
urgent enough to follow our Constitu-
tion by walking them from this House, 
out that door, through Statuary Hall, 
under the Capitol dome, and to the 
Senate floor. 
It will take only a matter of minutes 
to get them there, and it will codify 
the first-ever partisan impeachment 
process in our Nation’s history.

H6 
January 7, 2020 
History will not judge this process 
and this impeachment favorably. If you 
don’t like who gets elected, work to 
elect someone else. 
Instead, Democrats will ask them-
selves years from now, ‘‘Why did we 
allow partisanship and hatred of this 
President to change history and prece-
dent?’’ when this institution is para-
lyzed by future partisan impeachments 
of duly elected Presidents of both par-
ties. 
f 
TIT-FOR-TAT IS NOT A POLICY 
(Ms. NORTON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. 
NORTON. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
the 
House cannot sit still and allow Trump 
to become an imperial President, an-
swerable to no one. 
Without consultation with House 
leadership or even leaders in the Re-
publican Senate, Trump ordered the 
killing of a major military leader, Ira-
nian General Qasem Soleimani. 
Like countless officials worldwide, 
Soleimani was a bad actor whose forces 
were responsible for the deaths of 
Americans. However, Soleimani was 
not killed on the battlefield but was 
targeted by President Trump in Bagh-
dad. Trump may have been seeking re-
venge for the storming and damaging 
of the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, the 
largest, most fortified embassy in the 
world. 
Tit-for-tat is not a policy. It is a 
childish and dangerous response that 
could lead to all-out hostilities. 
The U.S. lacks credibility to start 
diplomatic efforts. I hope that our al-
lies will intervene as emissaries before 
it is too late. 
f 
CONDEMNING RECENT ANTI- 
SEMITIC ATTACKS 
(Ms. FOXX of North Carolina asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, over the past year, we have 
seen a troubling rise in anti-Semitic 
crimes and activity across the United 
States and the world. 
In 2019, 229 anti-Semitic hate crimes 
were reported in New York City. There 
was a 46 percent increase in anti-Se-
mitic hate crimes in Chicago. From 
January to October, there were 58 re-
ported anti-Semitic crimes in Los An-
geles. 
The facts are indisputable. These hei-
nous acts of violence were not the re-
sult of random, isolated incidents. 
These acts were deliberately orches-
trated with a clear intent to target and 
harm the Jewish community. 
Attacks of any kind on communities 
of 
faith 
are 
unacceptable. 
Simply 
broaching the issue of anti-Semitic 
crime is not enough to protect these 
communities. Those responsible for 
committing these senseless acts of vio-
lence must be prosecuted to the fullest 
extent of the law. We must foster en-
gagement between law enforcement 
and targeted communities, and we 
must all work together to confront this 
issue. 
f 
CONGRESS NEEDS TO PASS WAR 
POWERS 
RESOLUTION 
IMME-
DIATELY 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, the 
American people and Members of Con-
gress cannot ignore being on the brink 
of war. Nor can we ignore the fact that 
the Constitution indicates in Article I 
that it is the Congress that has the re-
sponsibility and duty to declare war. 
Nor can we ignore the breaking news 
of 10 rockets that have just hit a base 
in Iraq that houses U.S. troops or the 
4,000 troops that have been sent in the 
last 24 hours or the reckless decision 
made by this administration to kill a 
very bad man in a manner that has cre-
ated havoc in the Mideast. 
It is interesting to suggest that our 
allies are supportive when, in the last 
24 hours, Israel said they had nothing 
to do with it. Presidents Obama and 
Bush, competent and prepared, indi-
cated that this was not the right thing 
to do. 
My concern is that we, as a Nation, 
are defenders, and we can defend our-
selves. We are powerful. That is not the 
point. 
The point is that we can do a tactic, 
but where is the strategy? It is crucial 
that we do not send young men and 
women into battle recklessly. 
I believe the Congress needs to pass a 
war powers resolution, an AUMF, im-
mediately. 
f 
PRESIDENT TRUMP’S ORDER WAS 
CORRECT 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday, universally re-
spected Senator Joe Lieberman pro-
vided an extraordinary op-ed in The 
Wall 
Street 
Journal: 
‘‘President 
Trump’s order to take out Qasem 
Soleimani 
was 
morally, 
constitu-
tionally, and strategically correct. . . . 
No 
American 
can 
dispute 
that 
Soleimani created, supported, and di-
rected a network of terrorist organiza-
tions that spread havoc in the Middle 
East.’’ In Syria, ‘‘more than 500,000 
Syrians have died.’’ 
‘‘During the Iraq war, Soleimani 
oversaw three camps in Iran.’’ These 
trained fighters have killed more than 
600 American troops. 
The claim that President Trump 
‘‘had no authority to order this attack 
without congressional approval is con-
stitutionally untenable and practically 
senseless. Authority to act quickly to 
eliminate a threat to the U.S. is inher-
ent. . . . Democrats should leave par-
tisan politics at ‘the water’s edge’ and 
. . . stand together against Iran and 
dangerous 
leaders 
like 
Qasem 
Soleimani.’’ 
Senator Joe Lieberman tells the 
truth. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
and we will never forget September the 
11th in the global war on terrorism, 
with the courage and leadership of 
President Donald Trump.

b 1915 
PRESIDENT TRUMP VISITS OHIO 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, this 
week, President Trump will travel to 
the great and compassionate city of 
Toledo, Ohio, my lifelong home. Like 
all people, the President is welcome in 
Toledo. 
Toledo is a city of industry, where 
the mighty Jeep has rolled off the as-
sembly line every year since 1941. We 
are also the city that embraces the fu-
ture and launched America’s leading 
solar energy company, First Solar. Our 
diverse city and people truly make 
America great. 
I urge the President to bring a mes-
sage of unity to our city, not one of di-
vision. 
I also urge President Trump to keep 
his promises to our people: Make medi-
cine and healthcare more affordable; 
save our Great Lakes; negotiate en-
forceable trade agreements that actu-
ally stop job outsourcing. Protect, 
don’t gut, Social Security, Medicare, 
and Medicaid. Get MITCH MCCONNELL 
to pass the Butch Lewis Act to save the 
pensions of 60,000 Ohioans, and select 
our 180th Fighter Wing for the F–35 
tranche planes that they have so duly 
earned. 
Let us work on a bipartisan basis to 
improve the lives of all people. And, in 
furtherance of that, this Thursday, I 
urge all Toledo area religious leaders 
to offer prayers for nonviolence and 
peace, and I urge all of our citizens to 
light a candle in their home and put on 
a porch light to shine a ray of hope 
skyward for a new year of peace and 
prosperity for all. 
May God bless our troops.

Mr. WILLIAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise

the 2019 Blum High School Bobcats 
football team on winning their first

January 7, 2020 
The young men and coaches on our 
teams spend countless hours running 
drills, watching film, and getting ready 
for their moment in history. During 
the 2019 season, Blum High School’s 
dedication paid off as they rose from 
behind and secured a 58–52 win over the 
McLean Tigers at AT&T Stadium. 
On behalf of the 25th District of 
Texas, I congratulate the Bobcats on 
their first State championship victory, 
and I wish them the very best in their 
bright futures. 
In God we trust. 
Bless our troops. 
Go Bobcats.

PRESIDENT TRUMP UNITES FAC-
TIONS IN IRAN AGAINST THE 
UNITED STATES 
(Mr. BLUMENAUER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, 
President Trump has demonstrated the 
limitation of his reality show, go-it- 
alone, 
incoherent 
approach, 
which 
helped him eke out an electoral college 
victory while losing the popular vote 
by 3 million votes, but is spectacularly 
ill-equipped to govern, let alone re-
spond to a crisis that he has made 
worse. 
Maybe there was a reason that Bush 
and Obama didn’t kill Soleimani when 
they could. Evidently, his advisors put 
General Soleimani’s assassination on 
the 
list 
of 
options 
because 
they 
thought it was so outrageous they 
didn’t think he would choose it. 
If you thought abandoning our Kurd-
ish allies who helped us fight ISIS was 
a heartless disaster, now Trump has 
managed to unite factions in Iran 
against us, delaying reform for years, 
while pushing us to the brink of war 
and making it more likely that Iran 
develops nuclear weapons after Iran 
followed the nuclear agreement that 
the President broke. 
Reportedly, 
Iranian 
missiles 
are 
launched on Americans in bases that 
the Iraqi Parliament said we should 
abandon. 
Congress must act to rein in this 
reckless President. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President.

DISTRICT 
16 
LITTLE 
LEAGUE 
BASEBALL 
CHAMPIONSHIP 
FOR 
NORTHFIELD, NEW JERSEY 
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. 
VAN 
DREW. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
Northfield, New Jersey’s Little League 
baseball team, a little while back, won 
their second straight District 16 Little 
League baseball title. 
Their pitcher, Finn Haines, who was 
selected to compete in the Little 
League Derby in Atlanta, pitched their 
final two innings to clinch the win. 
Brady Arena, their leadoff hitter, 
scored their winning run, ensuring that 
Northfield beat Ocean City 3–2. 
The District 16 baseball teams are 
made up of 11-and 12-year-olds in At-
lantic and Cape May Counties in south 
Jersey, and winning this title means 
that Northfield advanced to the Sec-
tion 4 tournament. 
When they won, the Northfield team 
ran a victory lap around the field hold-
ing the District 16 championship ban-
ner in pride, along with the United 
States flag. 
So to all players on the team: Con-
gratulations on your win. You have ex-
citing futures ahead of you. I am sure 
you have many, many more wins to 
come. 
f 
FASTEST GROWING CITY IN 
AMERICA, SUGAR LAND, TEXAS 
(Mr. OLSON asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, my home-
town of Sugar Land, Texas, keeps set-
ting records and leaving all the others 
in the dust. Today, we found out we are 
the fourth fastest growing city in 
America, growing 49.3 percent over the 
last decade. 
That growth would not have hap-
pened without Philip Savko. Philip ran 
Sugar Land Regional Airport for near-
ly 21 years. Under his leadership, his 
two decades of leadership, our airport 
went from flying Cessna 152’s and crop 
dusters to being the go-to airport in 
the Houston region for Fortune 500 cor-
porate jets. One hundred of these jets 
use our airport on a regular basis. 
Philip delivered these birds by ar-
ranging to have on-call U.S. Customs 
service at our airport. Philip brought 
692 jobs to Sugar Land, with the im-
pact of $93 million. 
Philip took his last flight from our 
airport. He flew up to heaven over the 
holidays. We imagine Philip, on ap-
proach, God in the control tower, say-
ing: ‘‘Philip, you are on course, on 
glide slope. You are cleared to land. 
Welcome home, dear man.’’ 
Rest in peace, Philip, with our many, 
many thanks. 
f 
SUPPORT FOR GUN RIGHTS 
(Mr. COMER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to reaffirm my strong support 
for the Second Amendment and stand 
up for the constitutional right for all 
Americans to keep and bear arms. 
At a time when efforts are underway 
across the country to restrict gun own-
ership, patriotic Americans are rising 
up in strong defense of the Second 
Amendment. This is especially true in 
my home State of Kentucky, where 
there is significant grassroots energy 
on the side of defending a right that 
our Founding Fathers considered to be 
of critical importance. 
Whether it be red flag laws or other 
proposals aimed at limiting access to 
firearms or ammunition, politicians 
across the country are seeking to roll 
back the basic rights of law-abiding 
Americans. As a member of the Con-
gressional Second Amendment Caucus, 
I pledge to strongly oppose these pro-
posals as well as any effort to infringe 
on the fundamental freedom of gun 
ownership. 
f 
HONORING VETERAN OF THE 
MONTH OLIVER GREEN 
(Mr. SPANO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
bring attention to a distinguished vet-
eran from my district. 
At the age of 17, Private Oliver Green 
enlisted in the Army just before the 
Korean war; and on his 18th birthday, 
Private Green landed at Wonsan, North 
Korea, in a tank landing ship. 
As a machine gunner assigned to the 
Third Infantry Division, Seventh Regi-
ment, First Battalion, D Company, Oli-
ver Green was quickly put into the 
fight, experiencing a number of combat 
engagements with the enemy. After 
being seriously wounded, Private Green 
was awarded the Bronze Star, the Sil-
ver Star, and the Purple Heart for his 
combat heroism. 
Oliver Green went on to attend the 
University of Alabama and Stetson 
School of Law. He later became a Polk 
County judge, rising to become chief 
judge of the tenth judicial circuit in 
1979. 
Oliver Green is a patriot. His com-
mitment and service to our Nation and 
our community have been outstanding. 
I am grateful for brave individuals 
like Oliver Green who go, and have 
gone, above and beyond the call of duty 
to serve their fellow man and to serve 
our Nation.

(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-

Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor 
Scott Winters, the readjustment coun-
selor at the DuBois Veterans Center in 
Pennsylvania’s 15th Congressional Dis-
trict. 
Mr. Winters provides a wide range of 
psychosocial services offered to eligible 
veterans, servicemembers, and their 
families. His efforts assist our veterans 
in making a successful transition from 
the military to civilian life. 
Recently, Mr. Winters was recognized

IMPORTANT ISSUES OF THE DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. GARAMENDI) is recognized 
for 60 minutes as the designee of the 
majority leader. 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, obvi-
ously, it is a new year, and we return 
to Washington with an agenda that is 
completely full and, in many, many 
ways, a tragic and an extremely dan-
gerous agenda out ahead of us. 
Last December, this House undertook 
the issue of how to deal with the issue 
of a President who was not paying at-
tention to his oath of office, and so we 
passed an impeachment resolution. 
That issue is now over in the Senate 
and in their hands. I could spend some 
time talking about that. 
Then, last Friday, another issue oc-
curred, and I will spend more time 
talking about that a little later. 
But what I came to the floor tonight 
for is to talk about what our Demo-
cratic Caucus, our leadership, and the 
230-plus members of our Caucus have 
been working on diligently over the 
last year for the people, a series of leg-
islative initiatives that address the 
fundamental concerns that America 
has, that Americans talk about, as we 
like to say, at their breakfast table or 
dinner table: the concerns about their 
family’s education, about their job, 
about their retirement, and, as I 
learned yesterday from my neighbor, a 
rancher, about the extraordinary cost 
of health insurance. 
I come to the floor tonight for that 
purpose, but I am going to delay my 
discussion of that and ask the chair-
man of the Education and Labor Com-
mittee, BOBBY SCOTT, to talk about the 
extraordinary work that his committee 
has done on the issue of education and 
for the working men and women of 
America. 
Mr. Speaker, I know the gentleman 
from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT) represents 
one of the largest military districts in 
the Nation, and I know that the 
thoughts of his constituents are on our 
minds. I also know that it is time for 
America to recognize the work that he 
has done on the Education and Labor 
Committee. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT). 
b 1930 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman from California 
for yielding, and, yes, we have a lot of 
military installations in the Hampton 
Roads area, and we are very concerned 
about the present situation in the Mid-
dle East. 
We want to talk about what is going 
on in the Committee on Education and 
Labor, and I just want to share a few 
things that we have been doing over 
the last year. 
Comments have been made of what 
Congress is or is not doing. Well, we 
have been protecting the income of 
hardworking Americans by the House 
passing the Raise the Wage Act, which 
will gradually increase the Federal 
minimum wage from $7.25 to $15 an 
hour by 2025, giving 33 million workers 
a raise and lifting over a million people 
out of poverty. 
We haven’t had an increase in the 
minimum wage for over a decade. The 
last minimum wage was over 10 years 
ago, and inflation has eroded the value 
of that minimum wage so much to the 
point where one study concluded that a 
full-time, 40-hours-a-week, minimum- 
wage worker cannot afford a modest 
two-bedroom apartment in any county 
in the United States. 
We are not talking about San Fran-
cisco or Manhattan. Not a single coun-
ty in the United States can a full-time 
minimum-wage worker afford a modest 
two-bedroom apartment. So we voted 
in the House to increase the minimum 
wage. 
The Paycheck Fairness Act addresses 
pay inequity by holding companies ac-
countable for gender-based wage dis-
parities and protecting a worker’s 
right to challenge systemic pay dis-
crimination. We passed that bill. 
The 
Rehabilitation 
for 
Multiem-
ployer Pensions Act, or Butch Lewis 
Act, will prevent the imminent col-
lapse of our multiemployer pension 
system, saving over 1 million hard-
working 
Americans 
their 
pension, 
while protecting those benefits and the 
taxpayer’s dollars. 
We also passed the Workplace Vio-
lence Prevention for Health Care and 
Social Service Workers Act to prevent 
violence and the injuries that occur be-
cause of that. 
In addition, the committee has re-
ported the PRO Act, the Protecting the 
Right to Organize Act, which will en-
able workers to negotiate for better 
wages and better working conditions. 
We also passed the legislation to help 
in the area of children’s access to qual-
ity education and a safe learning envi-
ronment. 
We passed in the committee the Re-
build America’s Schools Act which will 
invest $100 billion to repair our public 
schools’ crumbling digital and physical 
infrastructure and will create 1.9 mil-
lion jobs. 
We passed two important civil rights 
bills in the area of education: the Eq-
uity and Inclusion Enforcement Act 
and Strength in Diversity Act, which 
will empower students, parents, and 
communities to challenge discrimina-
tory education policies and increase 
school diversity. 
The committee passed the College 
Affordability Act, which will com-
prehensively overhaul our higher edu-
cation system so that students will be 
able to achieve a college degree with-
out incurring crushing debt. 
We also passed legislation to protect 
children from school shootings. 
In the area of healthcare, the House 
has passed legislation to protect con-
sumers from junk health plans by try-
ing to overturn the Trump administra-
tion’s short-term, limited duration in-
surance rule, as well as passing the 
Lower Drug Costs Now Act which will 
reduce out-of-pocket costs for cus-
tomers, lower prescription drug prices, 
and increase transparency. 
We passed legislation that will pro-
tect children from child abuse, the 
Stronger Child Abuse Prevention and 
Treatment Act. 
We protected seniors by passing leg-
islation, the Protecting Older Workers 
Against Discrimination Act. 
All of those bills have passed the 
House. None have been taken up by the 
Senate, and so we need to make sure 
that the hard work of our committee is 
rewarded by the passage of those bills 
in the Senate. 
But as I have said, our committee 
has been busy. All of the committees 
have been busy doing the people’s 
work. We are doing the people’s agen-
da, and I thank the gentleman for the 
opportunity to do a little bragging 
about what we have done. 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, the 
gentleman can use the word ‘‘brag,’’ 
but I would recommend that it is not 
bragging. It is simply a fact; not an al-
ternate fact, but it is a fact that the 
gentleman’s 
committee 
and 
this 
House—now under Democratic con-
trol—has passed well over 250 bills that 
are for the people. 
The work that the Committee of 
Education and Labor has done for the 
working men and women of this Nation 
is an extraordinary example of what 
can be done when we focus on legisla-
tion that is for the people. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman for the oppor-
tunity to mention these bills for the 
people. The people will be much better 
off if we can get a little cooperation 
down the hall and improve education, 
improve healthcare, and improve work-
ing conditions. 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, the 
gentleman did mention the grim reap-
er, I don’t think by name, but, clearly, 
the Senate leader intends to delay leg-
islation that would be in the interest of 
the American people: higher wages, 
better healthcare, better 
insurance 
products, jobs, making it in America, 
all of the things that I know the gen-
tleman and his committee have worked 
so hard on.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H9 
January 7, 2020 
So I thank the gentleman for that, 
and I look forward to the days ahead 
when I know that the gentleman has an 
additional agenda of legislation that he 
is going to be putting on the floor of 
the House. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
we are continuing to work. 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I am 
sure the gentleman will. I thank the 
gentleman very much. 
Mr. Speaker, I am really torn. I want 
to continue discussing the legislation 
that is out there, but I really stand in 
front of this Chamber—which at the 
moment is empty—with a very, very 
heavy heart and extraordinary con-
cern. 
I am looking at where we are as a na-
tion this evening, and I am going to 
really ponder tomorrow what fate may 
behold our men and women in the mili-
tary. 
A couple of hours ago the inevitable 
happened. I think I was a freshman in 
high school and my science teacher was 
trying to give me some of the prin-
ciples of physics. He was talking about 
for every action, there is an equal and 
opposite reaction. 
He was showing various examples of 
that and, of course, I was then playing 
football and I could really understand. 
I hit somebody, and they would hit me 
back; or I would push somebody and 
they would push back. I would like to 
think that I was more than equal. 
Last Friday, our President took an 
action and launched missiles at the 
highest commander of the Iranian mili-
tary and killed him, along with one of 
the major, if not the major commander 
of the militia units in Iraq. 
That attack took place just outside 
the Baghdad International Airport. 
That was an action, presumably, to 
prevent some future action that might 
be taken by the Iranians and by their 
leader or directed by their leader, 
Soleimani. 
My high school science teacher could 
not have been more correct. For every 
action, there is a reaction. And we will 
undoubtedly engage in a debate here on 
the floor and in the Congress and 
across the United States about whether 
the first action taken by the President 
to take out the leader of Iran’s Revolu-
tionary Guard was an appropriate ac-
tion. 
I think not, for a variety of reasons. 
And then we will also debate whether 
the Iranian reaction to that action 
which occurred a couple of hours ago 
was appropriate. 
I am quite sure that our military on 
the base in Iraq at Al Asad views the 
Iranian action as a very serious threat. 
We don’t yet know the results of the 
bombardment of missiles, but we can 
assume that there was certainly de-
struction of buildings or airfields and 
we pray that there was no destruction 
of life. 
But perhaps we may find that prayer 
unanswered. Where do we go from here? 
Where do we go from here? We are not 
on the verge of war. In a very, very un-
fortunate, tragic sense, we are in a war 
and some would claim that war is now 
40 years old and started way back with 
the embassy in Tehran being occupied, 
and we could say that is correct. 
This is different. I am on the Armed 
Services Committee, and I have had 
the briefings and I know, as do our gen-
erals and our intelligence community, 
the capabilities of the Iranian mili-
tary. Furthermore, we know the capa-
bilities of their proxies, the various 
military units that they have set up, or 
quasi-military units that they have set 
up: 
the 
militias, 
Yemen, 
Houthis, 
Hezbollah, and others. 
It is really a moment this evening for 
us to hold our anger, which is a normal 
and natural thing that certainly I, and 
I am sure every one of my colleagues 
possesses: anger at the attack on our 
military base. 
I suppose we should also think that 
perhaps Iran should hold its anger, al-
though they certainly expressed it in 
the streets, in the funeral ceremonies, 
and in the launching of ballistic mis-
siles at an American air base. 
We should hold our anger. We should 
say: Where does this go from here? 
What is the next tit for tat? Unfortu-
nately, I don’t believe our President 
thought about the next move, about 
the equal and opposite reaction when 
he ordered the launching of the mis-
siles that took out a very dangerous, 
bad, bad person. 
I don’t think he thought about the 
next order, nor do I think he thought 
about the third, fourth, fifth, or sixth 
order. Where does it go from there? 
But we have a chance this evening 
and tomorrow, and in the days ahead, 
to stop and think about the next event, 
the next tit for tat. What does it mean 
now for those of us in Congress, 435—I 
guess 434 since one of our colleagues re-
signed 
today—and 
the 
Senate—un-
doubtedly occupied with impeachment? 
It is time for us to reach into our 
desk drawer and pull out the Constitu-
tion of the United States and read Ar-
ticle I, and for the American people to 
do the same. When we read that, we 
will find that only Congress can de-
clare war; not the President, not the 
Secretary of State, not the Secretary 
of Defense, and not a general, but only 
Congress. 
b 1945 
Maybe we could argue that it is al-
ready starting, in which case, stop, 
come to Congress, Mr. President, and 
tell us why you must, why we must, 
why America must, and why our mili-
tary must pursue the next tit for tat. 
Stop and tell us where it leads. Tell us 
how you think it might end. 
I know that our Secretary of Defense 
says that we are not going to start a 
war but that we will end it. Okay, then 
you come here. You come to the floor 
of this House as Roosevelt did and as 
others have done, and you tell us why 
we should have a war with Iran. Tell us 
how you intend to pursue that war and 
at what cost in human lives and the 
treasury of this Nation. 
Then, let us ponder your wisdom or 
lack of wisdom. Let us ponder—no, not 
‘‘let us.’’ This is not a matter of the 
President letting us. This is a matter 
of the Congress of the United States as-
serting its constitutional obligation. 
At this moment and on this day, 
when it is easy to argue that America 
has been attacked, on this day, stop, 
come to us, Mr. President, and tell us 
why you want to pursue a war with 
Iran. Tell us what equipment you will 
need. Tell us the number of troops that 
will be dispatched. 
Then it is our responsibility—535 of 
us—to say that, yes, we will go to war 
with Iran, or, no, we will not. 
This is a critical moment. This is a 
moment when I am thinking about 
that science teacher who said that for 
every action, there is an equal and op-
posite reaction. We have seen an action 
and a reaction. Yes, we attacked Iran 
by taking out their top general, and, 
yes, they attacked us by launching 
their missiles into our airbase and 
quite possibly harming our military 
personnel and others. 
Now stop. Come here, Mr. President. 
Stand before us. Stand before the 
American people, and tell us why, how, 
and what it will cost to pursue this. 
That is his responsibility. Then it is 
our responsibility on behalf of the 
American people and people beyond 
this Nation to say that, yes, we will 
pursue a war, or, no, we will not. 
Keep in mind, Mr. President, that the 
existing authorizations to use force do 
not apply to this situation, not the au-
thorization to use force that was estab-
lished for al-Qaida and Afghanistan, 
not the authorization to use force to go 
after Saddam Hussein in Iraq. No. 
Those don’t apply. 
This is different. This is demon-
strably different. This requires the 
President to come to the Congress and 
explain why we should conduct a war 
with Iran. 
It is not to say we cannot protect 
ourselves. But the next action by our 
military likely would be far more an 
action of protection but, rather, an ac-
tion in response to what happened a 
couple of hours ago. 
I would have loved and would have 
desired not to be here at this moment, 
talking about this issue but, rather, 
following what Mr. SCOTT
had said 
about what has been done this last year 
for the American people, about the ef-
forts that we have made to bring down 
healthcare costs, to provide pharma-
ceuticals that people can afford, and to 
guarantee that Americans do not lose 
their right to health insurance, as the 
President and our Republican col-
leagues are attempting and have at-
tempted to do for the last 10 years. 
I would love to have spent this 
evening talking about that. I would 
have loved to talk about the education 
programs that Mr. SCOTT has already 
brought to our attention and to talk 
about raising the minimum wage. But 
that is not where I am tonight. 
My thoughts are with those military 
personnel, the airmen, many of whom

are from my district and probably at 
the bases there in the Middle East. My 
thoughts are with them and their fami-
lies. I pray that all are safe. 
And I pray that tonight or tomorrow 
morning a tweet says: ‘‘I, the President 
of the United States, will come to Con-
gress and explain why we should or 
should not pursue a war with Iran.’’ 
It is a good time for all of us to pray. 
It is a good time for all of us to take a 
deep breath and realize the path that 
we are on and where it might lead. 
I am deeply, deeply disturbed by 
what has happened. I am willing to 
take up my responsibility here, and I 
anxiously await what the President of 
the United States of America has to 
say as he stands here in the Congress 
and explains to a joint session of the 
Senate and the House why we should 
pursue a war with Iran. That is his re-
sponsibility, and then it is our respon-
sibility—elected by the people of Amer-
ica—to go to war or not to go to war. 
We shall see. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair.

You have been our protection. Shelter 
us until the violent storms are passed. 
Let Your glory shine on Your law-
makers. May their thoughts, words, 
and deeds prompt people to glorify 
You. Inspire our Senators to place 
their confidence completely in You. 
Eternal God, You are our salvation. We 
will trust and not be afraid, for You are 
our strength and song. 
We pray in Your loving Name. Amen.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-

f 
IRAN 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I spoke yesterday about President 
Trump’s decision to remove the chief 
architect of Tehran’s terrorism from 
the battlefield, and I discussed the Sen-
ate’s obligation to approach this in a 
manner that is serious, sober, and fac-
tual. 
It is right for Senators to want to 
learn more about the President’s major 
decision. Once again, I encourage all of 
our colleagues to attend the classified 
briefing which the administration will 
provide tomorrow. The Secretary of 
Defense, the Secretary of State, the 
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
and the CIA Director will give a classi-
fied context behind the President’s de-
cision, and they will discuss the admin-
istration’s strategy to protect our per-
sonnel and defend our Nation’s inter-
ests in the new landscape. I would ask 
every Senator on both sides to bring an 
open mind to this briefing. 
In particular, we should all remem-
ber that the history of Iranian aggres-
sion began long, long before this news 
cycle or this Presidency. In the decades 
since the Islamic revolution of 1979, as 
the White House has changed parties 
and our administrations have changed 
strategies, Tehran’s simmering anti- 
American hatred, proxy violence, and 
steady support for terrorism worldwide 
have 
remained 
entirely 
constant 
through all of these years. 
In effect, Iran has been at war with 
the United States for years. While it 
has taken pains to avoid direct con-
flict, Iran’s authoritarian regime has 
shown no compunction about kidnap-
ping, torturing, and killing Americans 
since its earliest days—or Iraqis or fel-
low Iranians, for that matter. From 
the 52 diplomatic personnel held hos-
tage in Tehran for 444 days back in 
1979, to the hundreds of U.S. service-
members killed in bombings carried 
out by Iran’s proxies—Beirut in 1983, 
Riyadh in 1995, Khobar in 1996—to the 
hundreds more killed or maimed in 
Iraq by the explosives and indirect fire 
attacks ordered by General Soleimani 
himself, to the constant flows of re-
sources and equipment that prop up 
despots 
and 
terrorist 
organizations 
throughout the region, Iran’s game 
plan has been an open book: Use third- 
party terrorism to inflict death and 
suffering on its enemies while avoiding 
direct confrontation. 
The threat Iran poses is, certainly, 
not new. Its violence is not some 
unique reaction to President Trump or 
to Prime Minister Netanyahu or to any 
other current leader. Violence runs in 
the bloodstream of this evil regime. 
In particular, our colleagues who ap-
parently want to blame President 
Trump for Iranian provocative foreign 
policy should reflect on the previous 
administration’s recent history. 
Iran exploited President Obama’s 
withdrawal from Iraq. Soleimani and 
his agents filled the void and dramati-
cally expanded Iranian influence inside 
Iraq. They were able to impose a sec-
tarian vision on Iraq that disenfran-
chised the Sunnis, fueled the rise of 
ISIS, and plunged the region into 
chaos. 
Over in Syria, more weakness from 
the Obama administration opened yet 
another door for Iran. The Democratic 
administration failed to confront the 
Iranian-backed Assad regime as it 
slaughtered literally hundreds of thou-
sands of Syrians and displaced millions 
more. Once again, amid the chaos, 
Soleimani worked and thrived. 
Of course, all of this was the back-
drop for the brazen, legacy-shopping

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S32 
January 7, 2020 
nuclear arrangement that sent billions 
of dollars to fuel Iran’s further vio-
lence. 
Even my friend the current Demo-
cratic leader knew it at the time. Be-
fore he himself voted for a resolution of 
disapproval on President Obama’s deal, 
Senator SCHUMER said: ‘‘After 10 years, 
if Iran is the same nation as it is 
today, we will be worse off with this 
agreement than without it.’’ That was 
the Democratic leader, who opposed 
President Obama’s Iran nuclear deal, 
and the Democratic leader was pre-
scient, for that is exactly what hap-
pened. 
The previous administration failed to 
confront Iran when necessary. So the 
mullahs used their windfall from the 
disastrous nuclear deal to double down 
on hegemonic aspirations all across the 
Middle East. A Democratic administra-
tion just had 8 years to deal with the 
growing threat posed by Iran, and it 
failed demonstrably. Iran was stronger 
and more lethal at the end of the 
Obama Presidency than at the begin-
ning. 
So I would ask my Democratic col-
leagues today not to rush to lash out at 
President Trump when he actually 
demonstrates that he means what he 
says—when he enforces his redlines, 
when he takes real action to counter 
lethal threats against Americans. 
Wishing away tensions with Iran is 
really not an option. The Iranians have 
spent decades making that perfectly 
clear to all of us. The question is 
whether we as a body would prefer the 
administration to stand by as Iran 
kills Americans or whether we are pre-
pared to work with the President to 
stand up to Tehran’s terrorism and 
shadow wars. 
f 
IMPEACHMENT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
on another matter, every day that the 
House Democrats refuse to stand be-
hind their historically partisan im-
peachment, it deepens the embarrass-
ment for the leaders who chose to take 
our Nation down this road. You can’t 
say we didn’t warn them. You can’t 
even say they didn’t warn themselves. 
It was less than 1 year ago that 
Speaker PELOSI said: ‘‘Impeachment is 
so divisive . . . unless there’s some-
thing so compelling and overwhelming 
and bipartisan, I don’t think we should 
go down that path.’’ That was the 
Speaker a year ago. 
Back during the Clinton impeach-
ment, it was Congressman JERRY NAD-
LER who said: ‘‘An impeachment sub-
stantially supported by one of our 
major political parties and largely op-
posed by the other . . . will lack legit-
imacy.’’ Chairman NADLER was right 20 
years ago. 
At this point, they may wish they 
had taken their own advice. 
Instead, what the country got was 
the most rushed, least thorough, and 
most unfair Presidential impeachment 
in American history, and now the pros-
ecution seems to have gotten cold feet. 
Nearly 3 weeks after the rushed vote 
they claim was so urgent, they are still 
debating whether or not they even 
want to see the trial proceed. They 
voted for it 3 weeks ago. 
The House Democrats say they are 
waiting for some mythical leverage. I 
have had difficulty figuring out where 
the leverage is. Apparently, this is 
their proposition: If the Senate does 
not agree to break with our own unani-
mous, bipartisan precedent from 1999 
and agree to let Speaker PELOSI hand- 
design a different procedure for this 
Senate trial, then, they might not ever 
dump this mess in our lap. 
It is one cynical political game right 
on top of another. It was not enough 
for the House to blow through its own 
norms and precedents and succumb to 
the partisan temptation of a subjective 
impeachment that every other House 
had resisted for 230 years. Now it needs 
to erode our constitutional order even 
further. Those in the House want to in-
vent a new, sort of pretrial hostage ne-
gotiation wherein the House gets to 
run the show over here in the Senate. 
Meanwhile, they are creating exactly 
the kind of unfair and dangerous delay 
in impeachment that Alexander Ham-
ilton specifically warned against in the 
Federalist Papers. This is already the 
longest delay in American history be-
tween the impeachment vote and the 
delivery of the House’s impeachment 
message. It is almost as though this 
House Democrat majority systemati-
cally took all of the Framers’ warnings 
about partisan abuses of the impeach-
ment 
power—took 
everything 
the 
Founders said not to do—and thought: 
Now, there is an idea. Why don’t we try 
that? 
Impeaching a President is just about 
the most serious action that any House 
of Representatives can ever take. How 
inappropriate and how embarrassing to 
rush forward on a partisan basis and 
then treat what you have done like a 
political toy. How contemptuous of the 
American people to tell them, for 
weeks, that you feel this extraordinary 
step is so urgent and then delay it in-
definitely for political purposes. How 
embarrassing, but also how revealing. 
Speaker PELOSI’s actions over the 
past 3 weeks have confirmed what 
many Americans have suspected about 
this impeachment process all along— 
that the House Democrats have only 
ever wanted to abuse this grave con-
stitutional process for partisan ends 
right from the beginning. 
Well, here is where we are. The Sen-
ate is not about to let the Speaker cor-
rode our own Senate process and prece-
dents in the same way. The first orga-
nizing registration resolution for the 
1999 Clinton trial was approved unani-
mously, 100 to nothing. It left midtrial 
questions to the middle of the trial 
where they belong. 
If that unanimous bipartisan prece-
dent was good enough for President 
Clinton, it should be our template for 
President Trump. Fair is fair. The 
Speaker of the House is not going to 
handwrite new rules for the Senate. It 
is not going to happen. 
Look, these are serious matters. At 
some point in time, the Democrats’ 
rage at this particular President will 
begin to fade, but the sad precedent 
they are setting will live on. The 
American people deserve a lot better 
than this.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Democratic leader is recog-
nized. 
IRAN 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
now, in the aftermath of the U.S. mili-
tary operation that took out Iranian 
General Soleimani, we need to be ask-
ing the right questions and remain 
clear-eyed about what might happen 
next. 
I have grown increasingly concerned 
about the strike against Soleimani and 
what it might mean for the safety of 
American troops in the region and the 
future of America’s involvement in the 
Middle East. The President has prom-
ised that he would not drag the Amer-
ican people into another endless war in 
the Middle East. The President’s ac-
tions, however, have seemingly in-
creased the risk that we could be 
dragged into exactly such a war. 
Unfortunately, this contradiction is 
far too typical of how the President 
has conducted foreign policy over the 
last 3 years. The President’s decision 
making has been erratic, and it has 
been impulsive, without regard to the 
long-term consequences of America’s 
actions abroad. He prefers reality show 
diplomacy and photo ops with foreign 
leaders to substantive progress. As a 
result, the President’s foreign policy 
has been dangerously incompetent. 
When you look at nearly every 
hotspot around the globe, he has made

the situation worse, not better. North 
Korea—3 years after failed ‘‘negotia-
tions,’’ North Korea remains bellig-
erent, defiant, and intent on developing 
ICBMs. Syria—after years of sacrifice 
and struggle against ISIS, one impul-
sive decision to withdraw our troops 
risks undoing all our progress. Russia— 
every meeting the President holds with 
Putin always seems to result in Putin’s 
coming out ahead. We are now at risk 
of the situation with Iran heading for a 
similar deterioration. 
The President’s foreign policy ac-
tions so far in North Korea, in Syria, in 
Russia, and just about everywhere else 
can be described in two words: ‘‘er-
ratic’’ and ‘‘impulsive.’’ I am worried 
that a few months from now his Iran 
policy will be described in exactly the 
same way. 
As the President’s circle of advisers 
has gotten smaller and more insular 
and as nearly all of the dissident voices 
have been forced out of the administra-
tion, there seems to be no one left to 
tell the President no. At times like 
this, skeptical voices need to ask the 
right questions, and Congress—Con-
gress must provide a check on the 
President and assert our constitutional 
role in matters of war and peace. 
In my view, President Trump does 
not—does not—have authority for a 
war with Iran. There are several impor-
tant pieces of legislation by both Sen-
ators KAINE and SANDERS to limit fur-
ther escalation with Iran and assert 
Congress’s prerogative on these mat-
ters. Both should receive votes in the 
Senate. 
I plan to ask pointed questions of 
this administration at a briefing for 
the Gang of 8 later this afternoon. We 
need answers to some crucial ques-
tions, and there are many. Here are the 
two that are most on Americans’ 
minds: What are Iran’s most probable 
responses to the strike on Soleimani? 
Are we prepared for each of these re-
sponses, and how effective will our 
counterresponses be? 
There was some alarming confusion 
yesterday about the military’s position 
on the future of U.S. troops in Iraq. 
What, in truth, does the Soleimani 
strike mean for the long-term stability 
of Iraq and our presence there? How 
does the administration plan to pre-
vent an escalation of hostilities and 
the potential for large-scale confronta-
tion with Iran in the Middle East? 
These are just some of the questions 
the administration has to answer. The 
safety and security of our American 
troops and of the American people are 
at stake. 
IMPEACHMENT 
Madam President, on impeachment, 
this morning, I return to the most 
pressing question facing my colleagues 
at this moment: Will the Senate con-
duct a fair impeachment trial of the 
President of the United States of 
America? 
The Framers suspected that any im-
peachment would ignite the passions of 
the public and naturally would create 
partisans who are either sympathetic 
or inimical to the President’s interests. 
That is why the Framers gave the Sen-
ate the responsibility to try impeach-
ment cases. When it came to a matter 
as serious as the potential removal of a 
President, they believed the Senate 
was the only body of government with 
enough independence to rise above par-
tisan considerations and act with the 
necessary impartiality. Will we live up 
to that vision? 
Right now, the Republican leader and 
I have very different ideas about what 
it means to conduct a fair trial. Demo-
crats believe a fair trial considers all 
the relevant facts and allows for wit-
nesses and documents. We don’t know 
what the evidence will say. It may ex-
culpate the President. It may further 
incriminate him. We only want a trial 
that examines all the facts and lets the 
chips fall where they may. 
The Republican leader, in contrast, 
apparently believes that a trial should 
feature no witnesses, no relevant docu-
ments, and proceed according to the 
desires of the White House, the defend-
ant. The Republican leader seems more 
concerned with being able to claim he 
went through the constitutional mo-
tions than actually carrying out our 
constitutional duty. 
Because the Republican leader has 
been completely unwilling to help get 
the facts for a Senate trial, the ques-
tion will have to be decided by the ma-
jority of Senators in this Chamber. 
That means four Republican Senators 
at any point can compel the Senate to 
call the fact witnesses and subpoena 
the relevant documents that we know 
will shed additional light on the truth. 
I have heard several arguments from 
the other side as to why we shouldn’t 
vote on witnesses and documents at 
the outset of the trial. The Republican 
leader and several Republican Senators 
have suggested that each side complete 
their arguments, and then we will de-
cide on witnesses. 
This idea is as backward as it sounds. 
Trials should be informed by witnesses 
and documents; they are not an after-
thought. Their reasoning and MCCON-
NELL’s reasoning has an ‘‘Alice in Won-
derland’’ logic to it: Let’s have each 
side make their case, he says, and then 
vote on whether the prosecutors and 
defense should have all the available 
evidence to make those cases. 
We know what is going on here. Our 
Republican colleagues, even Leader 
MCCONNELL, knows that the American 
people want witnesses and documents. 
Sixty percent of Republicans do. They 
are afraid to say no, but they don’t 
want to vote on them because that 
might offend the defendant in this 
trial, President Trump, so they are try-
ing to kick the can down the road. 
It is a strange position for Repub-
lican colleagues to take. They are will-
ing to kick the can down the road, as I 
said, on questions of witnesses and doc-
uments, but they are not willing to say 
when or if they will ever support it. 
Just yesterday, one of the four wit-
nesses we have requested, former Na-
tional Security Advisor Bolton, said he 
is ready to testify and has new infor-
mation to share related to the case at 
hand. Republicans were dodging and 
twisting themselves into pretzels try-
ing to explain why someone with direct 
knowledge of what the President did 
shouldn’t testify under oath imme-
diately. 
I believe that illustrates the funda-
mental weakness of the Republican po-
sition. None of our Republican col-
leagues 
can 
advance 
an 
argument 
about why this evidence shouldn’t be 
part of a trial from the beginning. 
To put it another way, none of our 
Republicans have advanced an argu-
ment about why it would make sense 
for the Senate to wait until the end of 
the trial to obtain all the evidence. 
Make no mistake, on the question of 
witnesses and documents, Republicans 
may run, but they can’t hide. There 
will be votes at the beginning on 
whether to call the four witnesses we 
have proposed and subpoena the docu-
ments we have identified. America and 
the eyes of history will be watching 
what my Republican colleagues do. 
Another argument I have heard from 
the other side is that it is not the Sen-
ate’s job to go outside of the record es-
tablished by the House impeachment 
probe. I would reply that it very much 
is the Senate’s job. The Constitution 
gives the Senate the sole power to try 
impeachment cases, not review im-
peachment cases, not go over impeach-
ment cases but the sole power to try 
them. It is not the Senate’s job to put 
the House impeachment proceedings on 
a weeklong rerun on C–SPAN. Our job 
is to try the case, to hold a real, fair, 
and honest trial. That means exam-
ining the arguments. That means let-
ting the prosecutors request witnesses 
and documents to make their case. 
This is not just my view. It has been 
the view of every Senate facing im-
peachment trial in our history. Every 
single impeachment trial of a Presi-
dent has featured witnesses. Andrew 
Johnson’s impeachment trial had 41 
witnesses. Several of my Republican 
colleagues here today voted for wit-
nesses in the Clinton trial. Except for 
one solitary case, every impeachment 
trial of any official, in the history of 
the Senate—and there have been a 
bunch—had witnesses. 
A trial isn’t a trial without evidence. 
A trial without all the facts is a farce. 
If the President is ultimately acquitted 
at the end of a sham trial, his acquittal 
will be meaningless. That is why the 
President himself should demand a full 
and fair trial. 
President Trump, if you have nothing 
to hide, if you think the case is as flim-
sy as you say, call your Chief of Staff. 
Tell him to release the documents. Call 
Leader MCCONNELL and tell him what 
you already told the country; that you 
would ‘‘love’’ for your aides to testify 
in a Senate trial. President Trump, if 
you believe you have done nothing 
wrong, you have nothing to be afraid of 
from witnesses and documents. To the

contrary, if you are afraid of witnesses 
and documents, most Americans will 
believe you have something to hide and 
that you fear you have done something 
very, very wrong. 
If my Republican colleagues believe 
the President has done nothing wrong, 
they should have nothing to fear from 
witnesses and documents. In fact, they 
should welcome them. What better way 
to prove to the American people that 
we are treating this matter with the 
gravity it requires. What better way to 
prove to their constituents that they 
are not just doing the President’s bid-
ding and not just making this a sham 
trial because of obeisance to the Presi-
dent of the United States. 
If every Senate Republican votes to 
prevent witnesses and documents from 
coming before the Senate, if every Re-
publican Senator votes for a rigged 
trial that hides the truth, the Amer-
ican people will see that the Repub-
lican Senate is part of a large and 
awful coverup. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Tennessee. 
JAPAN TRADE DEAL 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, I have come to the floor today to 
start this new year by really encour-
aging my friends on each side of the 
aisle to approach this coming legisla-
tive session with some optimism be-
cause there are some good things we 
can do. 
We come to the floor and we hear 
about 
Iran 
and 
we 
hear 
about 
Soleimani. There are differences of 
opinion there. I am one of those. I rep-
resent a major military post, and I 
know that so many of our men and 
women in uniform said: You know 
what, this should have been done long 
ago. This is a known terrorist who has 
conducted terrorist attacks on six con-
tinents, even tried it here in the United 
States. They felt like the President 
was justified. 
We hear about impeachment, and of 
course we know it has been widely re-
ported that our friends across the aisle 
and over in the House started 3 years 
ago trying to find something they 
could impeach Donald Trump on—just 
something. It was going to be emolu-
ments, or it was going to be collusion, 
or it was going to be coercion, or it was 
going to be Russia, or it was going to 
be bribery. There had to be something 
there because, you know what, they 
just don’t like the guy. They don’t like 
him. So they have been at it nonstop. 
They let that get in the way of some 
good things that people would like to 
get done. 
For the next few minutes, I would 
like to encourage us to think beyond 
subpoenas and trial and negativity and 
witness statements and instead focus 
in on three things that are right in 
front of us: two successfully negotiated 
trade deals that will benefit farmers, 
manufacturers, 
and 
small 
business 
owners and producers not only in my 
State of Tennessee but across the en-
tire country. 
In the Volunteer State alone, we 
have 967 foreign-based businesses, and 
they have invested $37.3 billion in cap-
ital improvements, and currently they 
employ more than 147,000 Tennesseans. 
That is good for our State. Trade is im-
portant to us in Tennessee, insourcing 
these jobs. 
Of particular importance to us is 
maintaining great trade relations with 
Japan. Do you know what is so amaz-
ing? We have so many people who 
didn’t even know that the Japan trade 
agreement went into effect on January 
1. The mainstream media was so busy 
focused on impeachment and other 
things that they didn’t even realize 
this was a deal that will do a good job 
for us. 
Our 
former 
U.S. 
Ambassador 
to 
Japan, who is a Tennessean, Ambas-
sador Hagerty, had negotiated this be-
fore he left. This recently agreed-to 
Japan trade deal will support 40,000 
jobs that are already provided by Japa-
nese companies. The new deal will also 
solidify Tennessee’s relationships with 
Japanese partners like Nissan North 
America, Toyota, Bridgestone, Nidec, 
and Denso Manufacturing—all with a 
presence in Tennessee and all employ-
ing Tennesseans. 
It is going to create greater market 
access to Tennessee’s agriculture prod-
ucts, specifically pork, cheese, and 
wine. It will eliminate or lower tariffs 
on 7.2 billion dollars’ worth of U.S. ex-
ports, including beef, which will put 
Tennessee and American farmers on a 
level playing field with their competi-
tors. That is a good thing for our agri-
cultural community. I cannot over-
state how big a win this is for Ten-
nesseans and for Americans, and there 
is more on the horizon. 
CHINA TRADE DEAL 
Madam President, later this month, 
President Trump will solidify a trade 
deal with China that will eliminate or 
roll back the section 301 tariffs and 
provide some much needed protection 
for our patents and trademarks and 
copyrights that will allow innovators 
in our creative community, like our 
Tennessee songwriters, screenwriters, 
TV producers, and our actors, to enjoy 
the benefits of a free market. This has 
been a long time coming. There is a lot 
more to do. 
UNITED STATES-MEXICO-CANADA TRADE 
AGREEMENT 
Madam President, you may recall at 
the end of 2018—not 2019 but at the end 
of 2018—President Trump notified Con-
gress that he would soon provide us 
with implementing legislation for the 
newly signed United States-Mexico- 
Canada trade agreement. We call it the 
USMCA. 
At that moment, at the end of 2018, 
our colleagues in the House were put 
on notice that this highly anticipated 
and desperately needed legislation was 
on its way. Get ready. It is coming to 
you. At that moment, the House ma-
jority leadership was presented with 
the opportunity to prioritize American 
workers 
over 
partisan 
politicking. 
What was their choice? Their choice 
was to choose partisan politicking and 
leave the American workers on the 
sideline, leave these auto manufac-
turing workers on the sideline while 
they focused in on partisan bickering. 
We all know what happened. 
In 2019, petty revenge schemes took 
priority and trade relations with our 
closest allies were shoved aside to ac-
commodate a yearslong campaign. As I 
said at the beginning of my remarks, 
for 3 years they have wanted to undo 
the 2016 election. 
In May, instead of prioritizing the 
creation of nearly 176,000 jobs, House 
Democrats decided to spend their time 
drafting subpoenas. In June, instead of 
focusing on the 12 million jobs already 
depending on good trade relations with 
Canada and Mexico, House Democrats 
held four votes on these subpoenas. 
It was the same story in July, in Au-
gust, and in September. House Demo-
crats pushed forward with their im-
peachment ambitions at all costs. They 
had to do it. They had made a promise 
that they were going to go get him. 
They neglected the owners of over 
120,000 American small businesses that 
export goods throughout North Amer-
ica. They put themselves and their pri-
orities before the needs of the Amer-
ican people. 
Even as late as October, the Speaker 
of the House continued to stall, invent-
ing excuse after excuse when it came to 
pushing the USMCA negotiations to 
the sidelines in favor of partisan at-
tacks. Even Members of her own cau-
cus sought to distance themselves from 
those attacks. 
By the end of the year, the House 
majority’s resolve to ignore their duty, 
finally began to splinter. 
They struck a deal with the White 
House, but even then, the compromises 
they pushed for were barely, hardly 
worth wasting an entire year’s worth of 
potential economic opportunity. There 
was a lot of opportunity cost to busi-
nesses to make way for House Demo-
crats’ partisan bickering. 
We have brokered successful trade 
deals with Japan, with China—deals 
that America’s farmers, manufactur-
ers, producers, and small businesses 
have waited for, for a very long time. 
Now, after a year’s worth of delays, ex-
cuses, and outright obstruction on the 
part of House Democrats, we are forced 
to ask those farmers and workers to 
wait just a little bit longer. It isn’t 
fair, and it certainly is not what is best 
for our Nation’s economy and certainly 
not what is best for Tennessee. 
In the coming weeks, I encourage my 
colleagues to stay focused on policies 
that may not dominate the headlines 
but that are dominating the thoughts 
of Tennesseans from one end of the 
State to the other and certainly of 
Americans all across this country who 
are looking for trade opportunities and 
opportunities to grow their businesses 
in this robust and growing economy. 
I yield the floor.

pore. The Senator from Illinois.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S35 
January 7, 2020 
IRAN 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, this 
morning, 
the 
Republican 
majority 
leader took to the floor and spoke at 
great length about the execution of 
General Soleimani. General Soleimani, 
who was the head of the military forces 
in Iran, was killed by a drone strike at 
the authorization of the President of 
the United States, Donald Trump. 
Senator MCCONNELL, this morning, 
made a lengthy case about the back-
ground of General Soleimani. It is hard 
to argue with the facts he brought to 
the floor. In fact, I would concede and 
most 
would 
agree 
that 
General 
Soleimani, in his time, was an archi-
tect of terrorism and that, in the 
course of his career, there has been 
American blood on his hands. That is 
fact, but it wasn’t a fact just discov-
ered in the last few weeks. The Presi-
dents of both political parties have 
known this about General Soleimani 
for a long period of time. They have 
had opportunities to end his life, yet 
they didn’t seize those opportunities. 
Presidents of both parties decided it 
was prudent not to do it. 
The question that has been raised 
now is why this President, at this mo-
ment, made the decision to execute the 
general. We know this general and his 
past activity have had an impact not 
only on the United States but on the 
Middle East and many other innocent 
people. The question that has been 
raised is, Why at this moment? Why 
did it make sense at this moment? 
But for a few Members of the Senate, 
most of us have not had extensive 
briefings or an opportunity to ask 
questions of this administration about 
the timing of this critical decision. We 
will get our chance tomorrow. There is 
a classified briefing in which represent-
atives at the highest level of this ad-
ministration will come before us and 
explain why they believe the Presi-
dent’s decision at that moment was the 
right thing to do for America. So many 
of those who come to the floor and de-
fend the decision or criticize those who 
question that decision really have not 
had the benefit of a classified briefing, 
which will be offered to Members to-
morrow. 
I am going to withhold any com-
ments about those elements, as much 
as I can possibly say publicly, until I 
get the chance to have more informa-
tion. But this much I do know: Regard-
less 
of 
that 
decision 
on 
General 
Soleimani, we know for certain the 
Constitution of the United States em-
powers the American people, through 
their elected Representatives in the 
Senate and the House, to make the ul-
timate decision about whether the 
United States will go to war with Iran 
or any other country on Earth. We 
have learned, bitterly, that the igno-
rance or refusal of Congress to exercise 
that constitutional right can be disas-
trous. 
Many of us have memories of the war 
in Vietnam, where 58,000 American 
lives were lost, 2 million Vietnamese 
were killed, and $170 billion—now, in 
today’s terms, $1 trillion—was spent on 
a conflict that divided America and 
cost so many American lives. Congress 
did not exercise the authority given to 
it under the Constitution to make the 
initial decision about that war in Viet-
nam. Many times thereafter, people 
said: Why didn’t you step up and make 
the decision before this costly mistake 
was made? 
If there is to be a war with Iran, I 
join with Senator KAINE of Virginia in 
saying that the American people, once 
again, need to make this decision 
under the Constitution through Con-
gress, article I, section 8, which pro-
vides, in clause 11, that only Congress 
has the power to declare war. 
If we are going to proceed down a 
path to war with Iran, the American 
people have the right to know and the 
right to hear the fulsome debate. In the 
time I have served in the Senate, I 
have seen Presidents in the past who 
have come before the American people 
with flimsy evidence or even mis-
leading evidence to justify military ac-
tion. I know the bitter consequences of 
war. Even the best American troops are 
going to suffer casualties and deaths in 
the execution of a war. 
Let us make certain that if we are 
going to move forward with hostilities 
against Iran, we do it under our con-
stitutional requirement to have a ful-
some debate before the American peo-
ple and have an official declaration of 
war before we move forward. We owe 
the American people nothing less. 
IMPEACHMENT 
Madam President, secondly, I would 
like to address the issue of the im-
peachment trial, which the Senate ma-
jority 
leader, 
Senator 
MCCONNELL, 
raised this morning. 
Before I was elected to Congress, I 
made a living as a lawyer. I took many 
cases to trial. Few, if any, ever moved 
to a final decision without the intro-
duction of evidence. The evidence, of 
course, 
consists 
of 
documentation, 
sometimes physical evidence, but often 
the testimony of people who were wit-
nesses to events critical to a jury’s 
final decision. 
This impeachment trial should be 
nothing less. This is an opportunity for 
us—a rare opportunity in American 
history—to come forward and to dem-
onstrate that we are going to handle a 
trial in the U.S. Senate in a profes-
sional manner. For the Senate major-
ity leader, Senator MCCONNELL, to an-
nounce that there will be no witnesses, 
there will be no evidence, there will be 
no documents in advance is to deny the 
very basis of a trial, as I understand it 
and as most Americans understand it. 
If this President believes, as he has 
said so often, the charges in the im-
peachment articles do not rise to any 
serious or credible level, then, cer-
tainly, there is evidence that could 
prove his case. He will have his man-
agers on the floor of the Senate when 
the articles are presented to us. They 
can certainly call witnesses. They can 
bring evidence before us. But so far, 
the record is not very strong for that 
to happen. 
One of the Articles of Impeachment, 
the second one, relates to the Presi-
dent’s refusal to cooperate with the in-
vestigation in the House, refusal to 
provide documentation and witnesses. 
For a President who is arguing that 
there 
is 
really 
nothing 
to 
these 
charges, he has refused to provide even 
the most basic evidence to prove his 
point, if it exists. 
What we are saying on the Demo-
cratic side is that if there is to be a 
trial for impeachment in the U.S. Sen-
ate, common sense and the Constitu-
tion require that it be a fair trial with 
evidence for not only the Senators but 
the American people themselves to see. 
What we have asked for so far is lim-
ited in terms of what we are looking 
for: four witnesses and documents that 
can be clearly identified. Those are 
things I think should be part of this 
trial record so that regardless of the 
outcome of the trial, the American 
people will believe it was handled fair-
ly, in a dispassionate and nonpartisan 
way. 
FOR-PROFIT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES 
Madam President, I have come to the 
floor many times to speak to the 
American people about an industry, 
the most heavily federally subsidized 
industry in America today. No, it is 
not a defense contractor. It has noth-
ing to do with American agriculture. 
What I am speaking of are the for-prof-
it colleges and universities of the 
United States. These colleges and uni-
versities, sadly, have written a noto-
rious record when it comes to the 
treatment of their students. They have 
often cheated their students, luring 
them into signing up for expensive, 
often worthless college courses with 
false promises and inflated outcomes if 
they graduate. 
At the end, the students are left with 
massive student debts, a diploma that 
is worthless, credits that can’t be 
transferred to any other reputable col-
lege or university, and the prospects of 
a job that is almost impossible to find. 
In many cases, these sham operations 
actually go out of business in the mid-
dle of the student’s education. 
As an industry, for-profit colleges 
need to be remembered for two num-
bers—two numbers that tell the story 
of this industry. Nine percent of all 
postsecondary students go to for-profit 
colleges and universities in the United 
States. The University of Phoenix, 
DeVry—you have heard their names. 
They advertise quite widely. Nine per-
cent of students are attracted to these 
for-profit colleges and universities. But 
33 percent of all of the federal student 
loan defaults in the United States are 
by the students who chose to attend 
those colleges and universities. 
What is going on here, with 9 percent 
of the students and 33 percent of the 
student loan defaults? The answer is 
obvious. The cost of education at for- 
profit colleges and universities is too

high. Students incur more debt than 
they would by attending community 
colleges, city colleges, or other univer-
sities and colleges that have good rep-
utations. 
Secondly, 
the 
education 
is 
sub-
standard. You can advertise everything 
online about this great education. I can 
recall an ad that was on television in 
the Washington, DC, area a few years 
ago, and it showed a young woman— 
probably a teenager, not much be-
yond—in her pajamas, on her bed, say-
ing: I am going to college on my laptop 
here. 
Well, that kind of easy education, 
many times, is no education at all. At 
for-profit colleges and universities, too 
many students end up taking these ex-
pensive courses that are meaningless. 
It turns out that none of these courses 
can be transferred to some other school 
or university. When you take these 
courses and you spend your money and 
you spend your time and you end up 
with so-called college credits by for- 
profit colleges and universities, no one 
else will take them. No one else ac-
cepts them. They laugh at them. Then 
the students, if they can hang in there 
long enough with massive student debt, 
end up with a diploma that is a joke, a 
diploma that can’t even lead to a job. 
That is what the for-profit colleges and 
universities are all about. Despite the 
fact that they have been pretty wide-
spread across the United States, many 
of them have gone bankrupt. 
What happens to you as a student if 
you have gone to one of these univer-
sities that has made all these promises 
to you along the way about taking col-
lege courses and how it is going to end 
up being an education that will lead to 
a job, and it turns out they were all 
lies, fraud, deceit, deception? You have 
the debt, right? You have the student 
debt, but you can’t find a job. You went 
through 4, 5 years of these so-called 
courses at for-profit colleges and uni-
versities, and the only thing you have 
to show for it is a debt that is going to 
decide the rest of your life. 
It is not just the for-profit college in-
dustry that is burdening and exploiting 
our students. I come to the floor this 
morning because, sadly, at this mo-
ment in time, an agency of our govern-
ment is complicit. Secretary Betsy 
DeVos and the U.S. Department of 
Education have made a fateful decision 
for hundreds of thousands of American 
students that I have just described. Let 
me explain. 
After a for-profit college defrauds a 
student—lies to the student—Federal 
law gives that student the right to 
have his or her Federal student loan 
discharged under a provision known as 
borrower defense. Follow me. I have 
gone to a school and incurred a debt. 
They lied to me about their courses 
leading to a certain degree or to a job. 
Now the college is going out of busi-
ness, and I still have the debt, but, 
under American law, I am protected as 
a student. 
The law says that if you were de-
frauded, you can use something called 
a borrower defense to discharge the 
student debt, wipe it clean, and get an-
other chance at life. Congress has 
rightly decided with this law that we 
shouldn’t leave students holding the 
bag when these schools should be held 
responsible. 
Is that something most Americans 
agree with? Take a look at this New 
America poll. Americans agree that 
students should have their Federal stu-
dent loan debt canceled if their college 
deceived them. For Republicans, 71 per-
cent agree with that statement; Demo-
crats, 87 percent. Seventy-eight per-
cent of the American people say that if 
these colleges lied to them, the stu-
dents shouldn’t end up holding the bag. 
It is pretty obvious. 
But sadly, Secretary of Education 
Betsy DeVos is trying to make it dif-
ficult, if not impossible, for defrauded 
student borrowers to get the relief. 
Secretary DeVos has allowed a backlog 
of—listen to this—more than 223,000 
claims of students with student debt 
who claimed they were defrauded by 
these colleges and universities. There 
are 223,000 queued up, waiting in line 
for the Department of Education to im-
plement the law. For more than a year, 
she has also failed to approve one sin-
gle claim of the 223,000 who say they 
were defrauded—not one. She couldn’t 
help one student who was defrauded 
out of 223,000. 
Now she wants to change the rules to 
make it impossible for future student 
borrowers to be relieved from their stu-
dent debt when the schools have de-
ceived them and defrauded them. She 
has put forward a new rule that places 
unreasonable burdens on student bor-
rowers to seek and receive relief. Under 
this rule, the applicants looking for 
discharge of their student debt must 
prove that the school intentionally 
misled them. How is the student sup-
posed to prove intention on the part of 
the school? Borrowers must also file a 
claim within 3 years of leaving the 
school, even though the conduct is 
often not discovered until many years 
later. The new rule also requires bor-
rowers to apply individually instead of 
receiving automatic discharge when 
they are part of a group who has been 
harmed by similar widespread mis-
conduct. 
We have seen it before. Some of these 
names may ring a bell with you: Corin-
thian Colleges. They were all over the 
United States. They went bankrupt. It 
turned out they were defrauding stu-
dents, saying: Go take these courses, 
and you can end up being qualified for 
these jobs. 
It turned out it was a lie. After they 
went bankrupt, under the Obama ad-
ministration, many of the students, as 
a group, were protected by this law, 
the borrower defense rule. Secretary 
DeVos says: Every student, you are on 
your own at this point. Lawyer up. You 
are going to have to prove your case as 
an individual. 
This new rule requires borrowers to 
apply individually, instead of receiving 
this automatic discharge, which was 
the case under the Obama administra-
tion. With this new rule, Secretary 
DeVos is saying to borrowers: We are 
not on your side. You are on your own. 
In addition, if a borrower’s claim for 
relief is denied, they would not be al-
lowed 
to 
appeal 
under 
Secretary 
DeVos’s new rule. Even if more evi-
dence of deception and misconduct is 
found. 
This new rule also puts taxpayers on 
the hook for relief, shielding schools 
from being held directly accountable 
by students. The DeVos rule eliminated 
the current prohibition on institutions 
using class action restrictions and 
mandatory arbitrations as conditions 
of enrollment. 
These practices, which you have seen 
over and over again by Corinthian and 
ITT Tech and others, require borrowers 
to sign away their rights when they go 
to school. Think about that. You are 19 
years old, and you are starting your 
college education. You are going before 
one of these schools. They push in 
front of you that you have to sign up 
for $10,000 or $20,000 in tuition and sign 
the following contract. There you are, 
at age 19 without much life experience, 
being asked to sign up. Do you know 
what the fine print says? The fine print 
says that if I am lying to you, you 
can’t go to court. Most students don’t 
even understand that. They sign it be-
cause they are off to college, thinking, 
finally, here is our opportunity to be 
educated and have a life, a future. They 
don’t know they are being deceived by 
these schools. 
Secretary DeVos has said: Sorry stu-
dents, you signed that paper when you 
were 19, and now you are stuck with it. 
It is impossible for student borrowers 
to get relief under this new rule by 
Secretary DeVos. According to an anal-
ysis by the Institute of College Access 
& Success, the new Secretary DeVos 
rule will end up forgiving, at most, 3 
percent of the loans associated with 
school misconduct. They will be able to 
recoup just 33 percent of that relief 
from the schools themselves, and tax-
payers will foot the difference. The 
current rule is estimated to forgive 53 
percent of loans associated with mis-
conduct and recoup a greater percent-
age of the relief from schools. Sec-
retary DeVos has loaded up the U.S. 
Department of Education with people 
who were in the for-profit college in-
dustry. These are folks who are devis-
ing rules good for their industry but 
not good for the American student bor-
rowers. The bottom line is, the DeVos 
rule makes it harder for borrowers to 
receive relief, and the schools who 
commit the misconduct will pay for a 
lower portion of the relief that is 
given. 
I introduced S.J. Res. 56 last Sep-
tember to overturn Secretary DeVos’s 
borrower defense rule. Representative 
SUSIE LEE of Nevada introduced a com-
panion resolution in the House. Many 
organizations have endorsed my bill, 
including the Leadership Conference on

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S37 
January 7, 2020 
Civil and Human Rights, the AFL–CIO, 
American Federation of Teachers, Na-
tional 
Education 
Association, 
Con-
sumer Federation of America, Student 
Veterans of America, and the NAACP, 
but there is one most recently that I 
want to share with you because I think 
it is important that Members of the 
Senate of both political parties realize 
that we now have a major organiza-
tion—a nonpartisan organization—that 
speaks for the veterans of America who 
have endorsed this effort. 
I have in my hand a letter submitted 
to me by James Oxford, who goes by 
the nickname ‘‘Bill,’’ national com-
mander of the American Legion of the 
United States of America, sent to me 
on December 18, 2019. He tells the story 
of veterans who were exploited by 
these for-profit colleges and univer-
sities. They ended up serving our coun-
try, earning their GI bill of rights, then 
losing their benefits to these schools— 
these worthless schools—and going fur-
ther in debt to pay for their education. 
Commander Oxford sent this letter. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that this letter be printed in the 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
DECEMBER 18, 2019. 
DEAR SENATOR DURBIN: On behalf of the 
nearly 2 million members of The American 
Legion, I write to express our support for 
Joint Resolution 56, providing for congres-
sional disapproval of the rule submitted by 
the Department of Education relating to, 
‘‘Borrower Defense Institutional Account-
ability.’’ The rule, as currently written, is 
fundamentally rigged against defrauded bor-
rowers of student loans, depriving them of 
the opportunity for debt relief that Congress 
intended to afford them under the Higher 
Education Act. Affirming this position is 
American Legion Resolution No. 82: Preserve 
Veteran and Servicemember Rights to Gain-
ful Employment and Borrower Defense Pro-
tections, adopted in our National Convention 
2017. 
Thousands of student veterans have been 
defrauded over the years—promised their 
credits would transfer when they wouldn’t, 
given false or misleading job placement rates 
in marketing, promised one educational ex-
perience when they were recruited, but given 
something completely different. This type of 
deception 
against 
our 
veterans 
and 
servicemembers has been a lucrative scam 
for unscrupulous actors. 
As veterans are aggressively targeted due 
to their service to our country, they must be 
afforded the right to group relief. The De-
partment of Education’s ‘‘Borrower Defense’’ 
rule eliminates this right, forcing veterans 
to individually prove their claim, share the 
specific type of financial harm they suffered, 
and prove the school knowingly made sub-
stantial misrepresentations. The preponder-
ance of evidence required for this process is 
so onerous that the Department of Edu-
cation itself estimated that only 3 percent of 
applicants would get relief. 
Until every veteran’s application for stu-
dent loan forgiveness has been processed, we 
will continue to demand fair and timely de-
cisions. The rule that the Department of 
Education has promulgated flagrantly denies 
defrauded veterans these dignities, and The 
American Legion calls on Congress to over-
turn this regulatory action. 
Senator Durbin, The American Legion ap-
plauds your leadership in addressing this 
critical issue facing our nation’s veterans 
and their families. 
For God & Country, 
JAMES W. ‘‘BILL’’ OXFORD, 
National Commander, The American Legion. 
Mr. DURBIN. Let me read one para-
graph from Commander Oxford: 
As veterans are aggressively targeted due 
to their service to our country, they must be 
afforded the right to group relief. The De-
partment of Education’s ‘‘Borrower Defense’’ 
rule eliminates this right, forcing veterans 
to individually prove their claim, share the 
specific type of financial harm they suffered, 
and prove the school knowingly made sub-
stantial misrepresentations. The preponder-
ance of evidence required for this process is 
so onerous that the Department of Edu-
cation itself estimated that only 3 percent of 
applicants would get relief. 
Whether you are a Democrat or Re-
publican, don’t go waving that flag and 
tell everybody how much you love our 
veterans and ignore this letter. The 
leader of the largest veterans group in 
the United States of America—a non-
partisan group—told us these schools 
exploited 
veterans, 
and 
Secretary 
DeVos’s new rule means that these vet-
erans will never get relief. Ninety- 
seven percent will never get any relief. 
In a matter of a few days—maybe 
weeks—I will be calling this matter to 
the floor. I am asking my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to put the party 
labels outside, hang them up in the 
cloakroom, come on inside here, and 
stand up for students across America 
who did their best to get a college edu-
cation and were deceived in the proc-
ess, stand up for students who were 
loaded up with student debt, which 
could destroy their lives, and give 
them a fighting chance for a future by 
saying that Secretary DeVos’s bor-
rower defense rule is unfair to vet-
erans, unfair to students, and unfair to 
American families. 
I ask my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to do the right thing when the 
time comes and give these borrowers a 
second chance at being financially 
independent Americans who can con-
tribute to their families and our na-
tional economic growth. For our vet-
erans, please join me in making sure 
that Secretary DeVos’s borrower de-
fense rule is disapproved by both the 
House and the Senate. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
SCOTT of Florida). The Senator from 
Connecticut. 
IRAN 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, at a 
time of international turmoil and cri-
sis like this, all of us, I think, are 
sometimes prone to hyperbole. I count 
myself as part of that club. I endeavor 
to do better. 
It doesn’t serve this body well to 
warn of bad decisions that could lead 
to war if we are only doing it to serve 
political ends or to bloody up a polit-
ical opponent. Crying wolf also anes-
thetizes the public and risks dulling 
the country’s senses at a moment when 
the peril is real. Anytime we are con-
sidering asking the men and women of 
our Armed Forces and their families to 
make further sacrifices for their coun-
try, we have to treat those moments 
with the gravity they deserve. 
Let me state at the outset of my re-
marks that there are important rea-
sons why I believe that both Iran and 
the United States do not want to enter 
into a conventional conflict that would 
likely involve the United States taking 
steps to remove the Supreme Leader 
from power and which would likely in-
volve an invasion that would make 
Iraq in 2003 look like child’s play. 
The United States, of course, remem-
bers the Iraq war—at least, I think we 
do. Our military leaders know that a 
short-term fight in Iran would be much 
bloodier and would be much more cost-
ly than the initial invasion of Iraq. 
Iran, for instance, has twice the popu-
lation of Iraq. A long-term counterin-
surgency in Iran would be endless, po-
tentially costing hundreds of thou-
sands of lives. 
The Iranian leadership also knows 
that the United States might never de-
fensively defeat a drawn-out insur-
gency on Iranian turf, but Iran’s lead-
ers also know they likely wouldn’t be 
around to see that eventual conclusion 
because the United States would, at 
the very least, likely be successful in 
ending the existing regime. 
So neither side is likely war-gaming 
for victory. Even those of us who are 
deeply critical of President Trump’s 
Iran policy should acknowledge this, 
but as a student of history, I know that 
the annals of war are replete with cata-
clysmic conflicts that began not by 
choice but by accident, negligence, and 
incompetence. 
So today, when I warn of the United 
States being on a potential path to war 
with Iran, that is my concern, that the 
utter lack of strategy, the complete ab-
sence of nuance, the abandoned com-
munication and coordination with our 
allies, and the alarming deficiency of 
experienced counsel will end up getting 
thousands 
of 
Americans 
needlessly 
killed. 
This is not the first warning of this 
kind I have presented. A year and a 
half ago, the President ignored the ad-
vice of his first Secretary of State and 
his first Secretary of Defense, and he 
unilaterally pulled the United States 
out of the Iran nuclear agreement, de-
spite the fact that every expert agreed 
that Iran was in compliance. Then, to 
make things worse, President Trump 
enacted a series of devastating unilat-
eral sanctions on Iran. No other na-
tions joined with us. In fact, most of 
our allies actively and aggressively 
worked against us, trying to under-
mine and work around those sanctions 
in order to save the nuclear agreement. 
That fact, in and of itself, is simply ex-
traordinary and a sign of how weak 
President Trump has made America 
abroad.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S38 
January 7, 2020 
The sanctions still took a dramatic 
toll on Iran’s economy, and like every-
body predicted, the Iranian Govern-
ment didn’t sit still. They began to 
push back, attacking Saudi oil pipe-
lines, capturing European oil tankers, 
and ratcheting up threats against U.S. 
forces in Iraq. During this time, the 
President changed his story every 
week. Some days he said he would sit 
down and negotiate with the Iranians 
without preconditions. Other days his 
top people said they wouldn’t sit down 
unless Iran met an absurdly long list of 
preconditions. Other days, President 
Trump said he wanted to blast Iran off 
the map. It was a comedy of diplomatic 
errors, compounded nearly weekly with 
conflicting message after conflicting 
message that made it difficult for Iran 
to approach negotiations with us, even 
if they wanted to. 
By this winter, the situation was spi-
raling out of control. Iranian-backed 
militias launched a rocket attack that 
killed a U.S. private contractor in Iraq. 
The United States responded by killing 
at least 24 Iraqi militia members. Then 
Iraqi 
militia, 
supported 
by 
Iran, 
stormed our Embassy, culminating, for 
now, in the drone strike that killed 
General Qasem Soleimani last week in 
Iraq. There is no reason things had to 
get to this point. When President 
Trump came into office, Iran had 
stopped their quest for nuclear weap-
ons capabilities, and Iran was com-
plying with an intrusive inspections re-
gime that made sure they didn’t cheat. 
Iranian-backed militias had stopped 
firing rockets at U.S. personnel in Iraq. 
In fact, they were actually working on 
a U.S.-led project in Iraq—the eradi-
cation of ISIS. 
President Obama had united the en-
tire world against Iran. Even Russia 
and China were working side by side 
with the United States to constrict 
Iran’s nuclear weapons program. And 
with the nuclear agreement secured, 
this global coalition was teed up and 
ready to be mobilized by President 
Trump to pressure Iran to make the 
next set of concessions on their bal-
listic missile program and their sup-
port for terrorist proxies across the re-
gion. 
But Trump’s bizarre and nonsensical 
Iran policy threw all that leverage 
away willingly, voluntarily. Despite 
the economic sanctions, Iran today is 
more powerful, is more menacing than 
ever before. Just weeks ago, Iran had 
been wracked by anti-government pro-
tests, but President Trump’s recent ac-
tions have united the country against 
America and against our allies in one 
fell swoop. One only needs to look at 
yesterday, when millions of Iranians 
took to the streets for Soleimani’s fu-
neral—a mass outpouring of support 
that the Iranian regime could never 
have hoped to inspire on its own. 
Compared to 3 years ago at the end of 
the Obama administration, today Iran 
is closer to restoring its proxy state in 
Syria, Iran is more influential in 
Yemen, Iran is more threatening to 
U.S. troops in Iraq and across the Mid-
dle East, and Iran is closer to a nuclear 
weapon. 
The simple truth is that Iran is 
stronger and we are less safe today 
than when President Trump was inau-
gurated, but it gets, implausibly, even 
worse. 
Because the strike on Soleimani is so 
destabilizing and so unstrategically 
provocative, the U.S. position in Iraq— 
where we are still battling ISIS—is un-
raveling. All U.S. civilians have been 
ordered to evacuate. All U.S. counter- 
ISIS operations have been suspended. 
NATO has stopped its ongoing efforts 
to fight ISIS. The Iraqi Parliament has 
begun the process of kicking out all 
U.S. forces from the country—exactly 
what Qasem Soleimani had worked for 
years to achieve. 
All of that, on the back of Iran’s new-
found strength in the region, is the rea-
son there is so much head-shaking hap-
pening right now about why President 
Trump has so willfully bungled Iran 
policy, emboldening Iranian hard-lin-
ers and putting our Nation’s safety at 
risk. 
With that for context, we come back 
to the crisis moment of today and the 
real possibility that more of President 
Trump’s stumbling will lead us into a 
world-changing conflict with Iran. 
We, the Senators, have seen no evi-
dence 
that 
the 
assassination 
of 
Soleimani was necessary to prevent an 
imminent attack on the United States. 
I remain open to seeing that intel-
ligence, but 5 days later, Congress has 
not received a briefing from the admin-
istration. We are apparently going to 
get that tomorrow. But both President 
Obama and President Bush had the 
ability to kill Soleimani. They didn’t 
because their experts believed that exe-
cuting the second most powerful polit-
ical figure in Iran—no matter how evil 
he was, no matter how many American 
deaths he was responsible for—would 
end up getting more, not fewer, Ameri-
cans killed. 
We don’t know in what form the re-
prisal from Iran will come or when, but 
it will come. And, listen, we shouldn’t 
be afraid of reprisals in the wake of 
truly necessary military actions by the 
United States to protect our interests 
abroad. But when that attack arrives, 
President Trump has telegraphed that 
he is preparing to respond by commit-
ting war crimes against the Iranian 
people. He says he will bomb cultural 
sites, filled with civilian visitors, in re-
taliation. I can’t believe this needs to 
be said on the floor of the U.S. Senate, 
but that is something terrorists do, not 
the United States. 
Although this administration keeps 
saying they don’t want war, there is no 
logic to their circular theory of Iran 
policy. Trump believes that to change 
Iran’s behavior, we need to escalate our 
own actions. Then when our escalation 
begets more escalation from Tehran, 
Trump and his Iran hawks come to the 
conclusion that this must be due to the 
fact that our escalation wasn’t serious 
enough. 
The 
theory 
becomes 
unprovable because the Iran hawks just 
contend, failure after failure, that we 
just need one more escalation and one 
more escalation and one more esca-
lation. This is the exact behavior that 
could land us in a kinetic conflict with 
Iran that costs American lives. 
As I said at the outset, this is likely 
not going to be a full-on conventional 
war—at least I hope it is not. It may be 
that Iran sends missiles into Israel or 
ramps up the temperature in Yemen. 
They may try to assassinate American 
military or political leaders or use 
cyber warfare to go after critical infra-
structure. And maybe we don’t invade 
Iran. Maybe we just blister their coun-
tryside with bombs or try to disable 
their military from above. 
Of course, no matter the scope of the 
conflict, no matter how long this 
escalatory cycle lasts, the one thing we 
know is this: None of this has anything 
to do with making us safer. This cycle 
started with Trump’s rejection of a dip-
lomatic agreement with Iran that he 
didn’t like just because it had Barack 
Obama’s name on it. 
A political grudge set off a series of 
events that now has us lodged in a cri-
sis of harrowing scope, a crisis that 
this President—so unstable, so reck-
less, so capricious—likely cannot han-
dle. Unfortunately, his rejection of di-
plomacy and lack of concern for our al-
lies has left America more isolated 
than at any other perilous time in our 
history. At a moment when we cannot 
afford to be out on a limb, out on our 
own, we are. 
Politics is part of what got us here, 
but maybe politics is part of how we 
get out of this mess. Congress can cut 
off funding for President Trump’s war 
of choice with Iran. We can make clear, 
Republicans and Democrats, that the 
President cannot take military action 
without congressional consent. And of 
course the American people can have 
their say too. They can rise up, as they 
did in many cities this past weekend, 
and cry out in protest over President 
Trump’s decision to put politics over 
our Nation’s security. That public pres-
sure may push allies of the President’s 
here in the Senate to stand with Demo-
crats in opposition to this reckless risk 
to our Nation’s security. It is not too 
late to put a stop to this madness. 
Iran is an adversary. I don’t want 
anything I have said today to paper 
over all of that nation’s misdeeds in 
the region. It is in our national inter-
est to conduct a foreign policy that 
weakens Iran’s ability to threaten us, 
our allies, and our interests. But for 
the last 3 years, President Trump has 
done exactly the opposite. Iran’s nu-
clear program is back on. Iran has re-
started attacks against the United 
States. Iran is more influential in the 
region. Everything the President has 
done has worked to degrade our Na-
tion’s safety and has worked to make 
Iran stronger. 
The order to strike Soleimani has al-
ready been given, but what happens

next is not predetermined. My fear— 
my belief—is that last week’s killing of 
Qasem Soleimani will end up fitting 
into this pattern. But we have serious 
choices to make in this body, and we 
can choose to get off this path of esca-
lation and make decisions that correct 
this President’s recklessness and keep 
America safe. I hope we step up to that 
challenge. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, Qasem 
Soleimani, the commander of the Quds 
Force, was killed by U.S. forces last 
week. That has already been well dis-
cussed and well understood. The failing 
regime in Iran has done everything it 
could, between his death and right 
now, to make the most of it, to make 
him a martyr to the cause of terrorism. 
I think we should all understand that 
the cause of terrorism was his cause. 
He is not a general in any traditional 
sense of what that would mean. He has 
been described a number of different 
ways. He has been referred to as Iran’s 
top general. Don’t think for a minute 
that means anything like almost any 
other country’s top general. 
One newspaper called him Iran’s 
‘‘most revered military leader.’’ That 
might be true, but remember Iran’s 
purpose as a State is to encourage ter-
rorism all over the world. 
I heard one news broadcast where he 
was referred to as ‘‘an irreplaceable 
figurehead,’’ though they went on to 
explain that he was a significant per-
son. There apparently are no editors 
anymore because the term ‘‘figure-
head’’ doesn’t mean what they were 
suggesting. If they meant he was an ir-
replaceable figure, I hope that he is. I 
think he is hard to replace, and I hope 
he is hard to replace. I would like to 
think that in many ways he will not be 
able to be replaced, but that doesn’t 
mean he deserves our sympathy, re-
spect, or our grief. 
He was, in fact, a bad person. He 
spent his career largely outside the 
boundaries of what any civilized nation 
would consider a military context. He 
led Iran’s terrorism agenda around the 
world. 
Iran funded and provided weapons to 
the Shia militias in Iraq. They pro-
vided arms depots and military forces 
to the Assad regime in Syria. They 
supported Hezbollah terrorists in Leb-
anon. They provided advanced weapons 
to the Houthi rebels in Yemen. Hun-
dreds of U.S. military personnel in Iraq 
were either killed or injured by the 
IED attacks encouraged and funded by 
Iran 
in 
Iraq. 
That 
is 
what 
the 
Soleimani agenda was all about. 
Over this past year, Iran has contin-
ued its campaign of aggression against 
the United States and our allies. In al-
most every report of these activities, 
Soleimani was one of the persons men-
tioned as, again, structuring, master-
minding, encouraging, or taking credit 
for these things as they happened in 
some cases and denying responsibility 
in others for activities for which he 
and Iran were responsible. 
Last June, Iran shot down a U.S. in-
telligence drone flying in international 
space. In July, the Iranian Revolu-
tionary Guard Corps captured a Brit-
ish-flagged commercial vessel in the 
Strait of Hormuz. Iran was behind the 
attack on Saudi oilfields last Sep-
tember using drones and cruise mis-
siles. Iran was been behind an earlier 
attack on a Saudi airport used by civil-
ians. The Quds Force also launched a 
crackdown on Iranian citizens who pro-
tested oil prices and are vigorously 
seeking out others who are com-
plaining about the failing economy in 
Iran’s failing system. 
Someone has already been named to 
replace Soleimani as the head of the 
Quds Force, but hopefully no one really 
can fully replace him. 
I am not at all sympathetic to the 
idea that this action to eliminate this 
individual somehow came out of the 
blue. I think the President has been 
presented multiple times with this op-
tion as one of the things we could do if 
we wanted to send the clearest possible 
message to Iran. The President was 
criticized last year because when going 
down the list of things I mentioned, he 
was hesitant to act—until last week. 
The same exact critics in many cases 
decided, after a year of thinking what 
would be the best response, that when 
the President did act it was suddenly a 
hasty action. They went from calling 
his actions hesitant to calling this 
hasty, looking for a way to criticize 
the President. 
The President took this action after 
an American contractor was killed by 
forces 
associated 
with 
Iran 
and 
Soleimani, after the U.S. Embassy in 
Baghdad was attacked and weapons 
were used to get into the building. 
There have even been some sugges-
tions that we shouldn’t have done this 
because we should be afraid of how Iran 
will react. We do have to be thinking 
about how Iran would react. We need to 
be thinking about what their next ag-
gressive act might be. It would not be 
their first aggressive act, and I have al-
ready gone down a pretty long list that 
others can expand upon of the aggres-
sive acts Iran has done up until the 
last few days. 
We do have to be thinking about 
what is an appropriate response, but 
maybe it is now time for Iran to be 
thinking about what our next response 
may be to their next aggression. The 
aggressive list is long, the response 
that the U.S. Government took was 
significant, but we can’t fail to act de-
cisively just because it might upset our 
terrorist enemies. We can’t fail to act 
decisively just because it might upset 
the No. 1 state sponsor of terrorism, 
Iraq. 
Soleimani was not a high-ranking 
military official in any acceptable 
military structure. If your idea of a 
leading general is a general who leads 
in terrorist efforts, I think you have 
the wrong idea of what a military lead-
er is supposed to do. 
Soleimani was not a high-ranking 
government official in any job that a 
responsible government would have. 
Soleimani was the mastermind of ter-
rorist activities of the No. 1 state spon-
sor of terrorism in the world today. 
Soleimani has been eliminated and 
hopefully will be impossible to fully re-
place. 
I would say, in response to that deci-
sion, good job to the U.S. forces that 
executed the strike, and good job, Mr. 
President, in being willing to make the 
call. A bad person and a determined 
enemy of freedom and democracy in 
the United States of America has been 
eliminated. It is time for the Iranians 
to be thinking about what our next ac-
tion might be instead of quietly and 
vigorously planning on what their next 
action might be. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
IMPEACHMENT 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, many of 
us here in the Senate thought we would 
be opening the new year with an im-
peachment trial, but that is not what 
is happening this week because the 
Senate is still waiting—waiting for 
Speaker PELOSI to actually send over 
the Articles of Impeachment. 
Democrats 
rushed 
impeachment 
through the House, throwing fairness 
and due process to the winds in their 
haste to impeach the President, but 
now they are apparently content to 
just sit on the Articles of Impeachment 
for the foreseeable future. If Democrats 
really believe that this impeachment is 
a serious matter, that there is literally 
a crime spree in progress, as they have 
claimed, they would have already sent 
over the articles. The truth is, Demo-
crats’ impeachment efforts, which basi-
cally started before the President had 
even taken the oath of office, have 
been politically motivated from the 
start. Democrats thought they could 
damage the President politically by 
rushing to impeach him, and now they 
think they can damage the President 
politically by stalling a trial. 
Speaker PELOSI is also attempting to 
force the Senate to conduct the trial 
she would like it to conduct in hopes of 
getting the outcome she would prefer— 
demonstrating once again the fun-
damentally political nature of the 
Democrats’ impeachment quest. Here 
in the Senate, we will continue work-
ing on the business of governing until

IRAN 
Mr. President, on Friday, we learned 
that Iranian General Qasem Soleimani 
had been killed in a U.S. airstrike. 
Iran’s terrorist activities throughout 
the Middle East are well known. Iran is 
a key backer of Hamas and Hezbollah 
and has fomented conflict throughout 
the entire Middle East—escalating sec-
tarian conflict in Iraq, fueling civil war 
in Yemen, and supporting Syrian Presi-
dent Bashar al-Assad’s brutal regime. 
At the end of December, the Iran- 
backed militia Kataib Hezbollah, or 
KH, as they are called, fired more than 
30 rockets at an Iraqi military base, 
killing an American contractor and 
wounding 4 U.S. troops. Days later, 
Iran-backed protesters stormed the 
U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, conducting a 
2-day siege of the Embassy before with-
drawing—although not without setting 
fire to parts of the Embassy’s exterior. 
The list of Iranian terror activities is 
long, and at the center of all these ac-
tivities 
has 
been 
General 
Qasem 
Soleimani. As head of the Quds Force 
of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps, 
General Soleimani has been master-
minding Iran’s terrorist activities for 
two decades. Iran has been linked to 
one in six military deaths in Iraq, no-
tably through the IEDs that have be-
come so emblematic of the War on Ter-
ror. This was Soleimani’s work. He is 
responsible for the deaths of hundreds 
of Americans and thousands of inno-
cent civilians throughout the Middle 
East. It is a good thing that his reign 
of terror is over. 
While I hope we can all agree that 
Soleimani was a just target, there are 
naturally questions about the timing 
of the strike and what options were 
laid before President Trump. The Sen-
ate will be briefed tomorrow, and I 
hope my colleagues and I will be given 
a clear intelligence picture of the im-
minent and significant threat Sec-
retary of State Pompeo and other ad-
ministration officials have described. 
Soleimani’s death provides Iran with 
an opportunity to change course and to 
rethink its participation in terrorist 
activities throughout the Middle East 
and its aggression against the United 
States. Unfortunately, Iran doesn’t 
seem ready to take that opportunity, 
and there are rightfully concerns about 
how 
Iran 
might 
retaliate 
for 
Soleimani’s death. 
Iran has vowed severe revenge, but I 
hope Iran’s leaders recognize that the 
United States will not tolerate Iran’s 
aggressions. The United States is obvi-
ously closely monitoring any Iranian 
response or escalation, from attempted 
cyber attacks to threats against U.S. 
troops or citizens or our allies. The 
chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General 
Milley, has cautioned that there re-
mains a significant risk, and we have 
seen the Department of Defense and 
the State Department adjust their pos-
tures accordingly. 
As I said, with Soleimani’s removal, 
Iran has the opportunity to change 
course. In both Iran and Iraq, we have 
seen protests bravely displaying the de-
sire for a new way forward and, in the 
case of Iraq, for freedom from Iran’s 
malign influence. The path to that new 
day is a difficult one. Soleimani’s dec-
ades of work building terrorist net-
works will not easily be undone, and 
his 
replacement 
has 
already 
been 
named and has vowed revenge. 
In addition, under pressure from 
Iran, Iraq’s Parliament advanced a 
nonbinding resolution calling for the 
removal of U.S. troops from Iraq. I 
hope that cooler heads will prevail in 
Iraq and that we can come to an agree-
ment that upholds our mutual security 
interests and is beneficial to both the 
United States and to the people of Iraq. 
We have invested a lot in regional secu-
rity efforts that we should see through. 
As we know all too well from the rise 
of ISIS, the consequences of leaving a 
power vacuum can be dire. I hope that 
power vacuum will not be resurrected 
as the United States suspends counter- 
ISIS operations in order to defend our 
installations. 
The world may enjoy a degree of clo-
sure 
with 
the 
killing 
of 
Qasem 
Soleimani. Citizens of the Middle East 
who suffered at the hand of Soleimani’s 
terror may have hope for a safer fu-
ture, but this will require the Iranian 
regime to recognize the opportunity it 
now has to rid itself of Soleimani’s 
agenda and chart a new course. 
Iran’s leadership knows full well the 
consequences of maintaining its ven-
detta against America, our allies, and 
those who seek to live in peace and 
freedom. It got a preview of our mili-
tary and intelligence capabilities last 
week. This is not a call for escalation 
but a frank acknowledgment that the 
United States will stand resolutely 
against those who threaten American 
lives. 
While the initial reaction from Iran 
has not been promising, I hope General 
Soleimani’s death will encourage Iran 
to think carefully before it proceeds 
any further on its path of terror. I look 
forward to talking with the Defense 
Secretary, the CIA Director, and others 
tomorrow about what we need to do to 
minimize the threat of retaliation and 
to keep Americans and our allies safe. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF JOVITA CARRANZA 
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I am very 
happy that our first votes, not only of 
the session but of this decade, are 
going to be focused on supporting small 
businesses. 
In America, we tend to speak about 
businesses with a sense of reverence 
that I think is absent in other coun-
tries, and there is good reason for that. 
So many of the great companies in this 
Nation started out as small businesses, 
and some of the greatest companies in 
America today are small businesses. 
We also have just under 60 million indi-
viduals who are employed by over 30 
million small businesses throughout 
the country. 
The Small Business Administration 
can play a very important role in our 
success and in the success of these 
businesses by providing entrepreneurs 
and firms with technical assistance and 
access to capital, so it is critically im-
portant for the country. 
Today, as we consider the nomina-
tion of Jovita Carranza to serve as the 
SBA Administrator, I thought it was 
an important point to make. There are 
some additional points I would like to 
make. 
First of all, the position of Adminis-
trator is really crucial to ensuring that 
the agency is functioning well and is 
successful. It is also important that 
the Administrator be someone who is 
open to and supportive of the need to 
modernize the Small Business Admin-
istration and its many programs. 
As we move into this new decade, it 
is really important that the agency 
evolve to meet the unique and special 
needs of the entrepreneurs of today at 
a time in which we have ever-changing 
and increasing global and business cli-
mate adjustments that are occurring. 
I think we sometimes forget that 
businesses today face a very different 
environment than we saw 10, 20, or 30 
years ago. So as we are aware of these 
changes, it is important that, as pol-
icymakers, we have an obligation to 
identify the goals that achieve our na-
tional interests and that provide for 
our national defense, that create good 
jobs for American workers, and then 
that organize the laws that we propose 
and the reforms that we propose 
around those important items of na-
tional interest and how to achieve fur-
thering them. 
The last time the Small Business Ad-
ministration was fully reauthorized 
was 20 years ago, in the year 2000, when 
just 42 percent of households, for exam-
ple, had internet access. Nearly every-
one was still using dial-up phones for 
access. It would be another 6 years be-
fore the iPhone even existed. Back in 
2000, Americans bought fewer than 
10,000 hybrid electric cars. From 2000 to 
2020, those are the changes we have un-
dergone, and that was the last time the 
SBA was reauthorized. 
By the way, it also happens to be the 
year when China became a member of 
the World Trade Organization. I say 
that because, today, American small 
businesses—if you think our big busi-
nesses face unfair competition, imag-
ine the unprecedented threat in com-
peting against the Chinese Government 
and its Communist Party’s systematic 
industrial espionage and coercion, its 
large-scale subsidies for their own in-
dustries, and its sweeping obstruction 
of market access to its own country.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S41 
January 7, 2020 
The challenges are extraordinary, and 
they require resources that allow our 
small 
business 
sector 
to 
compete 
against these conditions and to operate 
dynamically, to grow, to be innovative, 
and to be creative. 
Small businesses need access to serv-
ices and programs that better position 
them to support not just our Nation’s 
competitiveness on an international 
scale but particularly with regard to 
Beijing’s continued economic aggres-
sion toward our Nation. 
Just as the SBA was critical in build-
ing the technologies and helping to 
spur the creation of the technologies 
that allowed us to be successful both in 
the space race and, ultimately, in the 
Cold War, I believe the SBA can play 
an important role in our efforts to 
compete with Chinese economic hos-
tility. 
In that regard, it is important to 
note that the status quo is just not 
enough. We need an agency that incor-
porates new and creative programs, 
that focuses on spurring investment, 
supporting advanced manufacturing, 
promoting innovation, and expanding 
our export opportunities. 
It is important to note, as I said ear-
lier with regard to the SBA’s role dur-
ing the space race and the Cold War, 
that innovation breakthroughs we have 
often seen in our history have often 
been contingent on private-public col-
laboration, especially in the space pro-
gram that also happens to have a com-
mercial obligation and also furthers 
our national security. 
Small businesses and startups have 
historically always been essential to 
developing the technologies and the 
commercialization of products that 
often come out of those partnerships. 
But unlike what we have seen in Sil-
icon Valley—startups that venture cap-
ital firms tend to gravitate toward 
over 
there—these 
technologies—the 
ones that are in our national interests, 
which I just spoke about—require sig-
nificant time and resources to finance. 
So on the Small Business and Entre-
preneurship Committee, we are going 
to continue to work toward a com-
prehensive 
reauthorization 
of 
the 
Small Business Act and the Small 
Business Investment Act to achieve 
these ends that I have just outlined. 
But the leadership and the guidance of 
a forward-thinking SBA Administrator 
is going to be essential, not just to get 
it passed but to make sure that mod-
ernization works. 
As the chairman of the committee, I 
am very eager to see the position of 
Administrator 
be 
filled. 
President 
Trump nominated Ms. Carranza to 
serve in this critical role back in Au-
gust of last year. She has a long and 
successful career, having spent many 
years in both the private sector and 
government service. 
She started her service at UPS. After 
29 years, she retired from there as vice 
president of air operations. Then she 
was nominated by President George W. 
Bush and was confirmed by this body— 
the Senate—to serve as SBA’s Deputy 
Administrator back in 2006. She served 
there for 2 years and then went back 
into the private sector until returning 
in June of 2017, when President Trump 
named her Treasurer of the United 
States. 
Last month, the Senate Small Busi-
ness and Entrepreneurship Committee 
held a hearing to consider this nomina-
tion, and we voted favorably to report 
her nomination to the Senate floor. 
In that hearing, Ms. Carranza made a 
commitment to work with Congress— 
to work with each of us—on the press-
ing issues that are facing the SBA and 
the program. She assured us—myself, 
ranking member, Senator CARDIN, and 
other members of the committee—that 
she would address the management 
challenges in the Office of Investment 
and Innovation to ensure the integrity 
of its programs but, most importantly, 
that she would appear before the com-
mittee after her confirmation to pro-
vide an update on how she is addressing 
these challenges. 
She has committed to do other 
things that are important: to assess 
the far-reaching rule governing the 
agency’s critical access to capital pro-
grams so that it is not restricting ac-
cess to capital for small businesses; to 
be 
communicative 
and 
transparent 
with us on the subsidy models and cal-
culations they are using for the Fed-
eral credit programs; to fill the back-
log of staff that is needed to properly 
run the SBA’s innovation programs; to 
ensure that Federal grant dollars are 
being properly used—the dollars espe-
cially associated with the entrepre-
neurial development programs to mod-
ernize the agency’s disaster loan pro-
grams; and to establish better controls 
to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse. She 
committed to expeditiously establish a 
women-owned small business certifi-
cation program and to provide re-
sponses to Congress on several of our 
past communications to the agency 
outlining proposals to aid small busi-
nesses against cyber threats, which is a 
critical threat facing many of the 
small businesses in this country today. 
In the business meeting we had after 
the hearing, we considered her nomina-
tion. I was pleased to see that the over-
whelming majority of our members on 
both sides of the aisle, including the 
ranking member, supported sending 
the nomination to the full Senate be-
cause there is a lot of work to be done. 
Restoring and expanding the SBA’s his-
toric legacy of assisting businesses and 
meeting the international challenges 
at hand are very important and very 
crucial. 
I look forward to working with Ms. 
Carranza to modernize our existing 
programs to meet the challenges we 
have before us and working toward so-
lutions that ensure that small busi-
nesses have access to the resources 
they need to start, to grow, and to em-
power our Nation at large. 
I urge all of my colleagues to support 
this nomination when we have a vote 
in a few minutes. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor.

IMPEACHMENT 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, be-
fore Congress adjourned for the holi-
days, our colleagues in the House of 
Representatives carried out their sole 
priority for 2019, which was to impeach 
President Trump. That was their No. 1 
objective in 2019. While it is no secret 
that this is something they have been 
dreaming of since the day President 
Trump was inaugurated on January 20, 
2017, it certainly took our colleagues in 
the House on a roller coaster ride and 
the country as well. I liken it, really, 
not to a roller coaster ride, but to a 
three-ring circus. It did not reflect par-
ticularly well on their body or on the 
seriousness of the process. 
From March of last year, here is an 
important quote to remember. Speaker 
PELOSI cast a lot of doubt that an im-
peachment vote would even happen. 
This is from March 2019. She said: 
Impeachment is so divisive to the country 
that unless there’s something so compelling 
and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don’t 
think we should go down that path, because 
it divides the country. And he’s just not 
worth it. 
That is what Speaker PELOSI said in 
March of 2019. 
As we have seen, it was only a matter 
of time before the radical Members of 
her caucus forced Speaker PELOSI’s 
hand and sent the House down a par-
tisan impeachment rabbit hole. That is 
where they ended up. House Democrats 
dove head first into—as something our 
majority leader has said here in the 
Senate—the most rushed, least fair, 
and least thorough impeachment in-
quiry in American history. We have 
only been through this three times be-
fore in American history. This is an ex-
traordinary 
undertaking 
under 
our 
Constitution, to seek to impeach and 
remove a President less than a year be-
fore the upcoming election over some-
thing that does not even allege any 
crime but rather a disagreement with 
the way the President has conducted 
foreign policy, which is his role under 
our Constitution. 
For as long as Democrats have been 
dreaming about this moment, you 
would think they would be well pre-
pared for a thorough investigation and 
a presentation of their case to the Sen-
ate. Well, as it turns out, that is not 
even close. They moved through closed 
door depositions, public hearings, and a 
vote at an alarming pace, all to ensure 
that they could wrap up the process by 
the end of the year. Before the clock 
struck midnight, they managed to get 
it done. 
Despite Speaker PELOSI’s insistence 
less than a year ago that impeachment 
should be a bipartisan process, the 
House passed Articles of Impeachment 
with votes from just one party, which 
is the definition of partisan, not bipar-
tisan. 
In spite of the partisanship that has 
ensnared this process in the House of 
Representatives, we in the Senate have 
vowed to follow the framework set by 
the only modern precedent for an im-
peachment trial in the Senate, and 
that is of President Bill Clinton. In 
1999, all 100 Senators, including both 
the current majority and minority 
leaders, voted in support of a pretrial 
resolution that laid the foundation for 
the trial ahead—this was in fairness to 
all concerned—so that the Senate could 
know how this would proceed and what 
they would be called upon to do. 
Back in 1999, all 100 Senators decided 
to begin with opening arguments, to 
move to Senators’ questions, and then 
to vote on a motion to dismiss. This 
would provide an opportunity to hear 
the case presented by the parties before 
the decision was made whether to hear 
from additional witnesses. I might add 
that I believe the House heard from 17 
different witnesses. 
All of the testimony certainly could 
be presented by the impeachment man-
agers in the Senate. Sometimes, I hear 
people talking about whether we are 
going to have any witnesses or not. 
Well, of course, but witnesses come in 
different shapes, sizes, and form. There 
could be a live witness. There could be 
a witness’s sworn testimony presented 
in a hearing or at a deposition outside 
of the Chamber and excerpts are read 
into evidence in the impeachment 
trial. This is not a question of whether 
we are going to have any witnesses or 
no witnesses. This is going to be a 
question of whether we are going to 
allow the impeachment managers from 
the House and the President’s lawyers 
to try their own case. In an ordinary 
civil or criminal case, you don’t have 
the jury trying the case for the pros-
ecution or the defense or for the plain-
tiff or the defendant. The role of the 
jury is to sit and listen and then to de-
cide after the evidence is presented. 
Well, when the time came to vote on 
the motion to dismiss, during the Clin-
ton trial, every single one of our Demo-
cratic colleagues who were here in 1999 
voted to dismiss the charges—every 
single one. That was the Clinton trial 
in 1999. Then, when Members voted on 
whether or not to hear additional wit-
nesses, every single one of our Demo-
cratic colleague who were here in 1999 
voted no—no additional witnesses. Ev-
eryone voted no. That includes our 
friend the minority leader, Senator 
SCHUMER, who said on the Senate floor 
yesterday that everyone who is op-
posed to additional witnesses is partici-
pating in a coverup. Talk about a 
change of heart. You know that is the 
danger here in the Senate. If you have 
been here long enough, you can find 
yourself on the opposite side of almost 
any question that could come up. Cer-
tainly, Senator SCHUMER
has found 
himself, first, saying in President Clin-
ton’s case no additional witnesses and, 
now, in the case of President Trump, 
he has changed the standard and says, 
if you don’t vote for additional wit-
nesses, you are somehow engaged in a 
coverup. 
Well, 
I 
think 
people 
are 
smart 
enough to understand what that rep-
resents. It represents not only a change 
of heart, but it represents hypocrisy 
and a double standard. 
When President Clinton was on trial, 
Democrats had zero interest in hearing 
from additional witnesses beyond that 
presented by the impeachment man-
agers and the President’s lawyers or 
spending more time on the trial. The 
way they saw it, all the information 
had been presented, and so they voted 
to throw the charges out. Now, I am 
not faulting them for that, per se. All 
100 members agreed to the process that 
gave them the opportunity to make 
that vote, and they had every right to 
do so. Now that a Republican President 
is on trial, instead of a Democrat, our 
Democratic colleagues say the same 
process is not good enough. In other 
words, what was good enough for Presi-
dent Clinton is not good enough, in 
their opinion, for President Trump. 
Instead of following the exact same 
framework used in the Clinton im-
peachment trial, they want to set the 
rules for the entire trial before we have 
even had a chance to hear the opening 
arguments. Here, again, I realize we 
have a lot of type-A personalities 
here—people who like to take charge— 
but that is not the role of the Senate 
during an impeachment trial. We are 
here to listen to the case presented by 
the impeachment managers from the 
House and the President’s own lawyers, 
not to try to take over the process. In 
fact, the hardest thing a Senator is 
going to have to do during this im-
peachment trial is to sit and be quiet 
and let the parties present their case. 
Well, our Democratic colleagues are 
even going so far as requesting specific

witness lists even before NANCY PELOSI 
has sent the Articles of Impeachment 
over. They obviously are having buy-
er’s remorse about voting out Articles 
of Impeachment now and essentially 
admitting that the evidence is so flim-
sy that it needs to be bolstered by addi-
tional witnesses here in the Senate. 
Well, I am sure it comes as no surprise 
that Senate Republicans are not on 
board with this partisan approach to 
impeachment. 
As you can imagine, NANCY PELOSI 
isn’t happy that the power to make 
this decision is in the Senate’s hands. 
One thing I have learned here in the 
Senate and in the Congress is that the 
Senate and the House are pretty jeal-
ous about the prerogatives of their 
body to be able to make decisions for 
themselves. The last thing the House 
ordinarily wants to do is have the Sen-
ate tell them what to do. Certainly, the 
opposite is true. The last thing the 
Senate wants to do is to have the 
House try to direct how the impeach-
ment trial is conducted here in the 
Senate. Well, that is not the way it 
works, and that is not going to happen. 
The Speaker has pulled the emer-
gency brake on this rushed impeach-
ment process and is refusing to send 
the Articles of Impeachment over here 
to the Senate because she doesn’t 
think the framework used in the Clin-
ton trial is good enough. She is now 
trying to use her role as Speaker of the 
House—admittedly, a very powerful po-
sition in our Congress—to try to make 
the rules of the Senate. She wants to 
set the parameters for what the Sen-
ate’s trial will look like, which is not 
in her job description. I know it is a 
terrible revelation, but it is beyond her 
authority, beyond her power, and it 
ain’t going to happen. 
The way I see it, this dogged deter-
mination to interfere in the Senate 
process isn’t because the framework we 
are planning to use is unfair or par-
tisan. Obviously, all the Democrats 
who were here during the Clinton trial 
agreed to a similar process then, and 
now they want to change the rules for 
President Trump. 
Speaker PELOSI also wants the Sen-
ate to do the work that Members of her 
caucus were either too rushed or too 
lazy to do for themselves. Ordinarily, if 
the charges are going to be brought, 
let’s say, in a criminal case, there 
would be an indictment, and then the 
case would be presented. It would rise 
or fall based on the presentation of the 
prosecutors. 
Well, here, I think the analogy is apt 
that it is the responsibility of the 
House to prove the Articles of Im-
peachment that they have charged. It 
is their responsibility, not ours. We are 
supposed to be the jury. 
Speaker PELOSI knows, as we do, that 
the House did not do a good job in in-
vestigating the facts, and she thinks 
the Senate should mop up after the 
House created the mess that they did. 
That is not going to happen. 
The House had ample opportunity 
and time to look at all the facts. The 
problem the House has is that the facts 
they have discovered and alleged sim-
ply don’t represent a high crime and 
misdemeanor, much less bribery or 
treason, which are the constitutional 
standards for an impeachment. What 
they have is a disagreement on the 
manner in which foreign policy was 
conducted with a President whom they 
hate. That is the reason they have im-
peached President Trump. It is not be-
cause of any bribery, treason, or high 
crimes and misdemeanors. As a matter 
of fact, they don’t even charge a crime. 
What they do is charge obstruction of 
Congress. 
Here is what happened. ADAM SCHIFF, 
the chairman of the Intelligence Com-
mittee, issued subpoenas to certain 
witnesses. The White House said: Hey, 
wait a minute. We believe we have a 
valid claim of executive privilege. Ordi-
narily, that would then go to a court, 
and the court would say yes or no or 
cut the baby in half. 
But when the witnesses said we need 
to go to court for direction, ADAM 
SCHIFF dropped them like a hot potato 
and didn’t even bother to call the wit-
nesses or go to court to pursue the tes-
timony he said was important. Now, 
that is on him. That is not on Presi-
dent Trump. To claim that their own 
mismanagement of the impeachment 
inquiry is grounds to impeach the 
President for obstruction of Congress 
would be laughable if it weren’t so seri-
ous. 
At their own volition, they rushed 
through the impeachment inquiry with 
reckless abandon, and it is not the Sen-
ate’s job to reopen and redo their inglo-
rious investigation. 
The Senate’s role, as I said, is to take 
the evidence compiled by the House 
and presented by the impeachment 
managers and conduct a trial based on 
the evidence that they present, not to 
somehow initiate a new investigation 
before we have even heard from the im-
peachment managers from the House, 
or to somehow say: Well, we are going 
to essentially become the impeach-
ment managers ourselves, a role that 
the Constitution gives to the House 
and not to the Senate. 
The Senate’s role is to listen and to 
decide, not to try to hijack the process 
and to try to do something for the 
House that they have been unable to do 
themselves. Once the Speaker trans-
mits the Articles of Impeachment to 
the Senate, the House’s role as a body 
is done, and they speak and act 
through the impeachment managers, 
who will be presenting the case on be-
half of the House. 
When the Speaker decides to send the 
Articles of Impeachment to the Senate, 
we will be prepared to do our job. And 
unlike the House, we will do so in a se-
rious and deliberative fashion and per-
form our constitutional duties under 
the Constitution and the rules of the 
Senate with regard to impeachment 
trials. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
FOREIGN POLICY 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, 
for over 3 years now, everyday Ameri-
cans, Members of this body, our diplo-
matic corps, and our allies and adver-
saries alike have wondered whether 
there is any sort of coherent strategy 
guiding the national security and for-
eign policy of President Donald Trump. 
If the events of recent days are any in-
dication, the answer is a resounding 
no. 
The Trump administration has no vi-
sion for how we might build a world 
that is more stable, peaceful, and pros-
perous for future generations. To be 
sure, the administration has some seri-
ous reports outlining global challenges 
and nicely drafted statements pro-
claiming their ‘‘America First’’ strat-
egy. In practice, the President’s erratic 
leadership and failure to invest in the 
very institutions we need to promote 
American national security have sowed 
chaos and increasingly left America 
alone. Our Nation has faced great chal-
lenges before. Yet, having served near-
ly three decades in Congress, I cannot 
recall a time when so many of them 
were of our own making and as predict-
able as they were avoidable. 
Simply put, President Trump’s for-
eign policy, like President Trump him-
self, is completely shortsighted, self-in-
terested, and transactional. 
The President’s abandonment of our 
core values has already eroded Amer-
ica’s standing abroad. Near the end of 
the last administration, the Gallup or-
ganization found that 48 percent of re-
spondents in more than 100 countries 
worldwide had confidence in the United 
States. Today, it has gone from 48 per-
cent to—it hovers around 31 percent. 
Furthermore, more people around the 
world likely trust—according to the 
poll—China or Russia rather than the 
United States. 
I know that national security is not 
a popularity contest, but the erosion of 
America’s standing in the world mat-
ters because it makes it less safe for 
Americans. It undermines our diplo-
macy. 
It 
hinders 
economic 
oppor-
tunity. It undercuts our ability to pro-
mote our values, betraying our cen-
turies-long vision of our Nation as a 
city on a hill. 
Our Nation was founded on noble 
ideals. It is those ideals more than our 
unrivaled economic strength and more 
than our unparalleled military might 
that have rallied the world to our 
side—from the defeat of fascism in Eu-
rope, to the rise of international insti-
tutions and security partnerships, and 
to the fall of the Berlin Wall and be-
yond. 
President Trump has squandered this 
precious resource of our values—our 
‘‘soft power’’—through actions that be-
tray our ideals, abandon our allies, and 
appease our enemies. Far from Amer-
ica First, this administration is leav-
ing America isolated, corrupted, and 
behind. We see it again and again— 
from Ukraine, to Syria, to Iran and be-
yond.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S44 
January 7, 2020 
Consider Russia. Even as our intel-
ligence community and bipartisan con-
gressional reports point to ‘‘incon-
trovertible’’ proof of Russia’s inter-
ference in our 2016 elections and plans 
to do so this year in 2020, to this day, 
the President’s own fragile ego still 
prevents him from even acknowledging 
the threat, let alone standing up to 
continued Russian aggression. 
Turn to North Korea. Two years ago, 
the President said that he had achieved 
a breakthrough and that we didn’t 
have to worry about North Korea any-
more and we could sleep well at home. 
Yet, despite all the made-for-TV mo-
ments, his poorly conceived and poorly 
executed effort has left North Korea a 
greater threat in 2020. Under President 
Trump’s watch, North Korea has ex-
panded its nuclear arsenal, successfully 
tested its first intercontinental bal-
listic missile, and conducted its most 
powerful nuclear testing. His adminis-
tration has undercut our critical defen-
sive alliance with South Korea and 
Japan and walked away from serious 
sanctions enforcement. 
Nearby in China, the administra-
tion’s efforts have failed to change Chi-
na’s actions in the South China Sea, 
resolve the structural issues at play in 
our trade relationship, or address its 
worsening human rights and govern-
ance behavior—from the crackdown in 
Hong Kong, to the oppression of the 
Uighurs, to China’s growing economic 
and technological influence, used to 
spy and oppress. 
Turning to the Western Hemisphere, 
a year ago, the President rightly de-
nounced Maduro but misleadingly de-
clared the success of his Venezuela pol-
icy. Today, the President sits silently 
as millions of Venezuelans fleeing a 
massive humanitarian crisis and the 
hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans 
already in the United States remain in 
desperate need of temporary protected 
status. 
President Trump says he wants to 
confront the root causes of migration. 
He says he wants to combat drug traf-
ficking and the opioid epidemic. Yet he 
has repeatedly weakened our counter-
narcotics, law enforcement, and devel-
opment operations in the Northern Tri-
angle and Mexico, while continuing to 
push for a border wall he promised the 
American people Mexico would pay for. 
The 
administration’s 
abhorrent 
treatment of asylum seekers—from 
separating children from their parents 
to placing people in cruel and inhuman 
conditions—has only further weakened 
America’s moral standard. Likewise, 
President Trump’s functional destruc-
tion of our Refugee Resettlement Pro-
gram and the slashing of refugee ad-
missions to the United States not only 
damage America’s reputation as a bea-
con of hope for vulnerable people 
around the world but deprive us of the 
contributions refugees have always 
brought to our economy and our com-
munities. 
We also face immense challenges like 
climate change. Yet, even as our close 
ally Australia faces the most deadly 
conflagration, this administration con-
tinues to deny a threat that is already 
costing American taxpayers billions of 
dollars in the wake of increasingly se-
vere storms, fires, and floods. 
Withdrawing from the Paris climate 
agreement was a gross abdication of 
American leadership, one that has al-
lowed China—yes, China—to position 
itself as the world leader on clean en-
ergy. 
The Trump administration has also 
ceded ground at the United Nations to 
China and Russia. Recently, China beat 
us out for a leadership seat at the Food 
and Agriculture Organization, while 
Russia won out support for its cyber 
crime treaty. 
While the administration may seek 
to explain away these losses on an indi-
vidual basis, this is, in fact, the steady 
drip, drip, drip of the loss of American 
power and influence due to President 
Trump’s abject mismanagement. 
Turn now to Africa. At a time when 
our allies, as well as adversaries like 
Russia and China, are ramping up their 
engagement, the United States is pull-
ing back. Indeed, Secretary Pompeo 
has visited Kansas on multiple occa-
sions during his tenure, but he has yet 
to visit a single sub-Saharan country. 
Likewise, we see a complete absence 
of diplomatic strategies for challenges 
across Africa, from preventing a return 
to conflict in South Sudan, to sup-
porting the democratic transition in 
Ethiopia, to curbing terrorism in the 
Sahel. The recent tragic deaths of 
Americans in Kenya demonstrate a 
lack of progress in weakening terrorist 
organizations 
like 
al-Shabaab 
and 
Boko Haram. 
Likewise, for a year, the administra-
tion failed to waive human trafficking 
sanctions so that USAID could ade-
quately respond to the deadly Ebola 
epidemic in the Democratic Republic of 
Congo. 
On human rights, the Trump admin-
istration’s approach is, in one word, 
abysmal. The administration supported 
the Saudi-led campaign in Yemen amid 
credible 
reports 
of 
despicable 
war 
crimes. It stood silent on the killing of 
Washington 
Post 
reporter 
Jamal 
Khashoggi at MBS’s direction. It has 
downplayed human rights and demo-
cratic backsliding in Honduras, Guate-
mala, the Philippines, Burma, Turkey, 
and beyond. 
Likewise, the Trump administration 
has rolled back the rights of women 
and girls worldwide, from cutting off 
funding for lifesaving maternal care 
they falsely claim promotes abortions 
to reinstating the global gag rule. It 
has also set back the clock on equality 
and protection for LGBTQ citizens in 
international instruments at the U.N. 
and elsewhere. 
I want to remind my colleagues why 
America 
must 
champion 
human 
rights—not just because it is right, al-
though it certainly is right, but be-
cause 
democracy 
and 
respect 
for 
human freedom are the foundation of a 
safer, better world for the American 
people to thrive in. 
As the President abdicates our lead-
ership and undermines the institutions 
we worked decades to help build, we 
have witnessed attacks on some of 
America’s closest friends. President 
Trump’s verbal broadside against the 
United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, 
and South Korea, just to mention a 
few—the latter during the ongoing nu-
clear standoff with North Korea—are 
deeply 
regrettable 
and 
completely 
counterproductive. This is not how 
America leads the world; this is how 
America finds itself alone, isolated, 
and more vulnerable. 
This administration has attacked the 
very idea of diplomacy. They proposed 
enormous cuts to the State Depart-
ment’s budget, removed senior diplo-
matic leaders with no replacements, 
and marginalized the State Depart-
ment’s input on key decisions. 
Finally, nowhere in the world is 
President Trump’s reckless foreign pol-
icy and total lack of strategy more 
painfully obvious than the Middle East. 
Let me be clear: I do not shed a tear 
for Qasem Soleimani. As a commander 
of the IRGC Quds Force, he was respon-
sible for the deaths of hundreds of 
Americans and supporting terrorism 
throughout the Middle East. Previous 
administrations 
kept 
tabs 
on 
Soleimani’s whereabouts, both Repub-
lican and Democratic alike, but they 
always chose not to act against him be-
cause the decision was that the action 
against him—the value of that was of 
less value than the consequences of re-
taliation and long-term military ac-
tion. 
The President must come to Congress 
and present clear and compelling intel-
ligence as to why this strike against 
Soleimani was absolutely necessary. 
What 
was 
the 
imminent 
threat 
Soleimani uniquely possessed? We need 
to know if the threats we face have ma-
terially changed. 
In the wake of all of its misleading 
statements, we must make clear to the 
administration that the President by 
himself does not—does not—have the 
authority to launch a war against Iran. 
Let me send the President a message. 
Attack on cultural sites are war 
crimes. They are war crimes. We ob-
serve international law not only be-
cause it is right but because then we 
can demand other countries to observe 
international law as well. 
The 
consequences 
of 
President 
Trump’s strike on Iranian Commander 
Qasem Soleimani are unfolding as we 
speak. Already, the Iraqi Parliament 
has called for an expulsion of American 
forces. Now there is confusion about 
what U.S. policy is. Are we keeping 
troops to fight ISIS? Are we going to 
start sanctions on Iraq? Confusion. 
Contradiction. Chaos. Amid such con-
fusion, the one thing that has taken 
place for sure is that instead of our 
mission there to fight ISIS, we are now 
having to recalibrate to use that mis-
sion to protect our own forces there. 
What a reprieve ISIS gets.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S45 
January 7, 2020 
Despite what the President may say, 
Iran is not a different country than it 
was 2 years ago. Iranian-backed pro-
testers just stormed our Embassy. Pre-
viously, they were storming Iranian 
Embassies. 
The 
Iraqi 
people 
were 
storming Iranian Embassies because of 
Iran’s influence in Iraq. Now they are 
out massively protesting against us. 
A regime that continues to oppress 
its own people and its proxies now has 
a 
solidified 
populous 
behind 
it. 
Soleimani’s legacy, ultimately, is that 
what he could not achieve in life, he 
may very well have achieved in death— 
pushing the United States out of Iraq. 
It is no secret that I did not support 
the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Ac-
tion, but let’s be clear: Today, Iran is 
closer to a nuclear breakout than when 
President Trump took office, and we 
have isolated ourselves from the inter-
national alliance that we have built to 
constrain Iran’s ambitions. 
Meanwhile, in Syria, the President’s 
greenlight for Turkey’s incursion has 
weakened American interest in the re-
gion, allowed Russia to grow its influ-
ence, and opened the door for ISIS to 
reconstitute. 
By turning our backs on the Kurds, 
we signaled to the world that we will 
abandon our allies on the battlefield. 
And while the President promised to 
stop endless wars in the Middle East, 
over the weekend, thousands of mili-
tary family members are unexpectedly 
saying goodbye as their loved ones re-
ceive orders to do just the opposite. 
President Trump has not brought the 
American people a more peaceful, a 
more stable, and a more prosperous 
world. On the contrary, the President 
has brought us closer to war, closer to 
facing a nuclear-armed Iran, closer to 
facing an existential threat to Israel, 
and closer to witnessing a destabilizing 
arms race and greater conflict in the 
entire Middle East region, fueled by 
emboldened Iranian proxy forces. 
A show of strength with no strategy 
in place is no show of strength at all. 
President Trump spent the better 
part of 3 years on the golf course, evis-
cerating the clear lines between a 
President’s 
responsibilities 
to 
the 
American people and his devotion to 
his own wallet. The President and his 
family continue to put their business 
interests over America’s interests. 
The President has flouted the Con-
stitution’s 
emoluments 
clause 
and 
shredded decades of ethical norms by 
refusing to divest himself from the 
Trump Organization. He and his family 
maintain unprecedented business inter-
ests in real estate projects in about 20 
foreign countries that undoubtedly en-
tangle him with foreign governments 
whenever local cooperation or financ-
ing is needed. It is clear that that cre-
ates a conflict that does not put the 
Nation’s interests first. 
He operates with no moral compass. 
Indeed, the President’s pursuit of his 
own personal profit at the expense of 
America’s national security interests 
in Ukraine led to his impeachment by 
the House of Representatives. 
I urge my colleagues to remember 
why America’s conduct on the world 
stage matters, why our values matter, 
and why our leadership matters. 
We strive to create a more peaceful 
and a more stable world so that we can 
protect the security of Americans at 
home, so that we can create greater 
prosperity and economic opportunity 
for our people, and, at the end of the 
day, avoid at all costs a need to send 
our sons and daughters to war. 
Every President faces new threats 
that challenge our quest for this 
brighter future. We have worked hard 
to create institutions and provide re-
sources to help every administration 
navigate 
this 
increasingly 
complex 
world. We pray that the moral char-
acter of every President provides them 
with the foresight and judgment nec-
essary to protect American security 
and our strategic interests when it 
matters the most. Instead, President 
Trump has taken difficult security 
challenges and made them even harder 
to resolve. That is why Congress’s role 
in shaping and advancing U.S. foreign 
policy has never mattered more. That 
is why I will continue to advance stra-
tegic legislation from Turkey to cli-
mate change, to new Ukraine support 
to conduct oversight, and to speak on 
behalf of the American people and the 
values and norms that define us and 
our place in this complicated world. 
Here in the Senate, we have an obli-
gation. We cannot cynically look the 
other way or be silent or enable that 
which we know to be wrong, risky, and 
morally reprehensible. History will not 
judge us kindly if we do. I, for one, will 
not stand idly by and be judged that 
way. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today following the 
U.S. airstrike in Iraq, the airstrike 
that killed Iranian’s terrorist master-
mind. 
I fully support President Trump’s de-
cision. As Commander in Chief, I be-
lieve he had an obligation to do what 
he did to act when American lives were 
at stake. With the death of Iran’s Gen-
eral Soleimani, the American people 
and people around the world are much 
safer. 
This general was an emboldened, 
blood-thirsty terrorist. He was a killer. 
He has the blood of countless people 
around the world on his hands. 
In the last 2 months, we have seen 11 
attacks—11 attacks—on U.S. forces and 
bases, including the killing of an Amer-
ican citizen. 
He became bolder and more aggres-
sive in both his actions and his ambi-
tions, and he was stepping up his at-
tacks on Americans. In fact, General 
Soleimani was at war with the United 
States his entire career, and it was a 
military career. He was the commander 
of Iran’s terrorist network. 
In recent months, we watched as he 
personally directed brazen attacks on 
our Embassy and our personnel in Iraq. 
We knew that more attacks were com-
ing, so the United States took action. 
Soleimani’s death makes America 
safer in the long run. Taking out this 
war criminal will help us avoid war in 
the future. 
Let me be clear: I don’t want war 
with Iran. The United States does not 
want war with Iran, but we know that 
appeasement 
does 
not 
work. 
The 
Obama administration’s strategy of 
wishful thinking failed. 
Soleimani’s terrorist network was 
made more powerful by U.S. money. 
The Obama administration gave bil-
lions and billions of U.S. dollars as part 
of that Iran nuclear deal. What did 
they do with the money? They used the 
money to support terrorists around the 
world. Without a doubt, appeasement 
brought only failure. It made Iran 
stronger, and it hurt the United States 
and our allies. 
We know that the winning strategy is 
peace through strength. We knew it 
through Ronald Reagan, and we know 
it today. Already, U.S. sanctions on 
Iran have been crushing and crippling. 
We must continue President Trump’s 
maximum-pressure 
campaign. 
Now 
Iran knows the United States means 
what it says. We are prepared for retal-
iations, should they come. 
This past weekend, Joe Biden actu-
ally said that Iran is in the driver’s 
seat. Iran is not in the driver’s seat; 
Iran is in the center of the bull’s-eye. 
U.S. forces will respond. We will re-
spond to any future attacks on Ameri-
cans or Americans’ safety, and we will 
do it swiftly and with a punishing re-
sponse. 
It will be a grave mistake for Iran to 
further 
escalate 
tensions. 
Instead, 
what Iran ought to do is dial down its 
aggressive nature and posture. 
The 
facts 
are 
these: 
General 
Soleimani was a blood-thirty terrorist. 
He had the blood of innocent civilians 
on his hands, and he would have killed 
many more if given the chance. 
This general spent his entire career 
at war with the United States. He was 
responsible for the deaths of American 
soldiers—hundreds 
of 
deaths 
with 
IEDs—and for the maiming of Amer-
ican soldiers with roadside bombs. 
Thousands of Americans have been per-
manently disabled because of him. 
Thankfully, 
the 
general’s 
20-year 
reign of terror has now ended, and 
there is broad condemnation all around 
the world over the mass destruction 
and the death that he caused. It is now 
time for Iran to take a step back, away 
from nuclear weapons, away from ter-
rorism, away from aggressions, and to 
come to the table. It is time for them 
to discuss peace. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.

S46 
January 7, 2020 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
BLACKBURN). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
WAR POWERS RESOLUTION 
Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I rise 
today to discuss the War Powers Reso-
lution that I filed on Friday, January 
3, with Senator DURBIN. 
I spoke yesterday at some length 
about the painful history of relations 
between Iran and the United States 
and the escalating tensions in the last 
3 years that have brought us to the 
brink of war. As we stand at the brink, 
with military actions by Iran and the 
United States causing battlefield cas-
ualties on the other side, I believe that 
it is imperative for Congress to re-
assert itself and make plain that no 
President should have the ability to 
take the Nation to war on his or her 
own. 
Let me talk about the Constitution 
and about the value judgment under-
lying the allocation of war powers in 
the Constitution and then the resolu-
tion that is now pending, having been 
filed in the Senate. 
First, on the Constitution, the Con-
stitution as drafted in 1787 has a series 
of provisions. Some are somewhat 
vague. In the Bill of Rights, what is an 
unreasonable search? Some are ex-
tremely precise. You have to be 35 
years old to be President. If you look 
at the Constitution, you can see a vari-
ety of provisions, some more specific 
and some a little more open-ended. 
Actually, the war powers part of the 
Constitution—though not completely 
without ambiguity—is one of the clear-
est parts of the Constitution. In article 
I, the power to declare war is given to 
Congress, not to the President and not 
to the Judiciary—to Congress. 
In article II, the President is declared 
to be the Commander in Chief of the 
military. If you read the constitutional 
debates at the time, what emerges is a 
fairly clear understanding by those 
who were at the Constitutional Con-
vention in Philadelphia that was both 
clear but also quite unusual. The un-
derstanding was that for a war to start, 
Congress should vote for it to be initi-
ated, but then, once started, the last 
thing you would need is 535 com-
manders in chief. So once Congress had 
voted to start a war, at that point the 
prosecution of the war becomes for the 
President and the military command, 
not to be micromanaged by 535 Mem-
bers of Congress. 
This was fairly clear, and it was very 
unusual. It was very unusual because 
at that point in history, in 1787, war 
and the declaration of war was not pri-
marily legislative. It was for the execu-
tive. It was for the King, for the Mon-
arch, for the Pope, for the Emperor, or 
for the Sultan. War had been, through-
out history, an executive function, not 
a legislative function. But the Framers 
of the Constitution and the constitu-
tional debates made plain that they 
were really trying to change human 
history, at least in so far as the United 
States went. Then, in this country, the 
initiation of war would be done by Con-
gress. 
Why was it done that way? Well, we 
have the virtue of a Virginian who was 
not only one of the drafters of the Con-
stitution but who kept notes of the 
Constitutional Convention and then 
wrote letters about what they in-
tended. Ten years after the Constitu-
tion was written in 1787, James Madi-
son wrote a letter to Thomas Jefferson 
and directly addressed why it is that 
the power to declare war is something 
for Congress. He said this: ‘‘The Con-
stitution supposes, what the History of 
all Governments demonstrates, that 
the Executive is the branch of power 
most interested in war, and most prone 
to it.’’ For this reason, we have ‘‘with 
studied care, vested the question of war 
in the Legislature.’’ 
They 
recognized 
that 
Executives 
were prone to war, and they wanted the 
legislature to have to sign off on the 
initiation of war. It was unusual then, 
and it is unusual now that the initi-
ation of war is to be left to the legisla-
ture. Why is that provision in the Con-
stitution? Why would we want to leave 
the question about whether war should 
be started to Congress rather than let 
the President do it as would be the case 
in other nations? It is about a value 
judgment. 
As important as the constitutional 
provision is, I would argue that what is 
more important is the value judgment 
that underlies this requirement of con-
gressional authorization, and the value 
judgment is about the men and women 
who serve in our military. Any war 
runs the risk that the young men and 
women who serve in our military could 
lose their lives or could be injured or 
could see their friends lose their lives 
or be injured. When we send troops into 
war, they may suffer an injury—trau-
matic 
brain 
injury, 
post-traumatic 
stress disorder—that will affect the en-
tire remainder of their lives in dra-
matic ways. If we affect their lives in 
that way, we affect the lives of their 
families and friends. 
The value judgment that sort of 
served as the pillar behind the provi-
sion that says Congress has to author-
ize war is this: If we are going to force 
young men and women to risk their 
lives, it should be based on a consid-
ered and open debate and a vote in full 
view of the American public. Then, 
there should be a vote about whether 
we are at war. If at the end of that de-
bate—with 
the 
questions 
that 
get 
asked and the trading of perspectives— 
before the people’s elected legislative 
branch, the legislature says that this is 
in the national interest and we should 
be at war, then, for those men and 
women who serve—yes, they are going 
to serve and risk their lives and risk 
their health and risk what might hap-
pen to them for the rest of their life— 
we will only ask them to do that if 
there is a considered judgment that 
war is in the national interest. 
That is the value judgment that 
underlies the most unusual part of the 
Constitution, that war can’t be started 
except by Congress. If we have that de-
bate and vote, then, it is a fair request 
to ask that of people—like my boy in 
the Marines or the 1 million-plus peo-
ple who serve in the military. It is a 
fair request to deploy them and have 
them risk their lives. 
But how dare we order troops into 
harm’s way, where they could risk 
their lives or health possibly for the 
rest of their life, if we in Congress are 
unwilling to have a debate and have a 
vote. Sadly, throughout the history of 
this country—and this is a completely 
nonpartisan 
statement—with 
Whigs 
and Federalists, Democrats and Repub-
licans, and with different parties in 
control of the legislative bodies and 
different parties represented in the 
White House, Congress has managed to 
figure out a way to avoid debate and 
avoid voting if they can. 
War votes are tough. I have had to 
cast two during the time I have been in 
the Senate as a member of the Foreign 
Relations Committee. I have cast thou-
sands of votes in my life as a city coun-
cil member and as a Senator. I will tell 
you that a war vote is categorically 
different than any other vote you will 
ever cast. They are hard. They can be 
unpopular. There are going to be bad 
consequences of a war vote. There may 
be an understandable human tradition 
in Congress to try to avoid it, but it is 
a responsibility that cannot be avoid-
ed. How can we order people to risk 
their lives when we are unwilling to 
risk the political challenges of a vote 
on war? That is the constitutional his-
tory. That is why the article I branch— 
the first among equals—is charged with 
the responsibility of initiating war, 
and that is the value judgment that 
underlies that constitutional provision. 
What does our resolution do? Our res-
olution is filed pursuant to the War 
Powers Act. The War Powers Act was 
passed at the tail end of the Vietnam 
war. Senator DURBIN did a good job 
yesterday of sort of going into the his-
tory of the passage of the War Powers 
Act. The War Powers Act was trying to 
do two things. In the aftermath of the 
Vietnam war, they were analyzing 
what had gone wrong during it. There 
were a number of points along the way 
where the President did not keep Con-
gress informed. There was a bombing 
campaign that started in Laos, for ex-
ample, during the Vietnam war, about 
which Congress wasn’t informed, and 
there were activities in Cambodia 
about which Congress wasn’t informed. 
Then, the second thing we were try-
ing to do was not just to require Presi-
dents to inform Congress but also to 
give Congress the ability to have a de-
bate and have a vote on the floor in 
case the President started hostilities 
without coming to Congress. The Presi-
dent should keep Congress informed 
and not hide the ball from Congress, 
and Congress needs a procedure to stop 
a war that is initiated by a President 
who doesn’t come to Congress. 
Here is the procedure under which we 
have filed our resolution. If a President

puts U.S. troops into hostilities with-
out a congressional authorization— 
even if the President claims a legal 
right to do so—self-defense, article II 
power—but if the President puts U.S. 
troops into hostilities without a con-
gressional authorization, any Member 
of Congress can file a resolution to re-
move the U.S. troops from hostilities 
and force a vote on that resolution 
within a prompt period of time. That is 
the resolution Senator DURBIN and I 
filed last Friday. 
President Trump has engaged the 
United States in hostilities with Iran. 
People have different points of view 
about whether that is a good thing or 
bad thing, but now that there are bat-
tlefield casualties on both the U.S. and 
Iranian sides, it is clear that this pro-
vision of the statute has been met. We 
are engaged in hostilities with Iran. 
Not only are the United States and 
Iran engaged in hostilities that have 
inflicted casualties on the other side, 
but the President is essentially ac-
knowledging that we are in hostilities 
because he is sending War Powers no-
tices to Congress—one in November 
and one last Saturday—reporting on 
his actions and saying that the reports 
are consistent with the War Powers 
Act. He recognizes that hostilities are 
underway. 
The current hostilities are not pursu-
ant to a previously passed congres-
sional authorization. The 2001 author-
ization for use of military force author-
ized military action against the per-
petrators of the 9/11 attack. Iran was 
not a perpetrator of the 9/11 attack, 
and there is no argument that they are 
covered by that authorization. There 
was a separate authorization passed by 
Congress in 2002. That is the most re-
cent one that has been passed. It au-
thorized action to topple the Iraqi Gov-
ernment of Saddam Hussein. That gov-
ernment is long gone, and that author-
ization does not permit attacks on Iran 
or on the current Iraqi leadership, such 
as the individuals who were killed in 
the two sets of U.S. strikes. With these 
two threshold questions met, hos-
tilities are underway as defined by the 
War Powers Act, and they are not sub-
ject to a previous congressional au-
thorization. 
We have now filed a resolution to get 
Congress to reassert its constitutional 
role. The resolution demands that U.S. 
forces be withdrawn from hostilities 
against Iran unless Congress affirma-
tively passes a declaration of war or 
authorization, or the United States 
needs to defend itself from an immi-
nent attack. 
If my resolution passes, Congress 
would still have the ability to pass an 
authorization, if it chose to, and the 
United States would still be able to de-
fend itself against imminent attack, 
but the President could not act on his 
own to start a war with Iran except in 
those circumstances. 
The resolution does not require that 
U.S. troops withdraw from the region. 
We are doing many things in the re-
gion. Thousands of Americans are 
there partaking in missions that in-
crease the security of the United 
States and our allies. There is no re-
quirement that we withdraw from the 
region. These missions include security 
cooperation with partner forces, fight-
ing against elements of al-Qaida, ISIS, 
and the Taliban, and ensuring the safe 
passage 
of 
commercial 
vehicles 
through freedom of navigation oper-
ations. All those activities that are 
being conducted by the United States 
in the region can continue. 
The resolution does not hold those 
forces into question or question their 
mission. 
The only thing the resolution would 
accomplish, if passed, is to back the 
U.S. troops away from engagement and 
hostilities with Iran unless for immi-
nent defense or pursuant to a separate 
authorization. 
I would hope to have the support of 
all my colleagues on this resolution. 
Its passage would preserve the option 
of U.S. military action for self-defense. 
It would preserve the ability of Con-
gress to declare war or pass a war au-
thorization. It would only prohibit this 
President or any President from taking 
us to war on his own. 
I heard one colleague say: ‘‘The last 
thing America needs is 535 Com-
manders in Chief.’’ I completely agree. 
Once Congress authorizes a war, it 
should be up to the Commander and 
the military leadership to wage that 
war and make the tactical decisions 
about how to fight it, but the question 
of whether we should be at war at all is 
one that is specifically left to Con-
gress. 
Let me finish by again focusing on 
our troops. So many members of the 
military were home for the holidays, 
enjoying time with their families, and 
then received surprise notices that 
they must redeploy to the Middle East 
yet again. 
Imagine the cost of two decades of 
war on these troops and their families. 
Some of these folks have deployed over 
and over and over again. Imagine being 
at home at Christmas and receiving the 
notice you have to deploy yet again to 
the Middle East. 
We are living in a challenging time. 
Many Americans know nothing but 
permanent war. We have been at war 
since 2001. There are Americans, in-
cluding Americans in the military, 
that that has been their whole life. 
That is all they know. Yet, at the same 
time, many Americans know nothing 
about war. Because we have an all-vol-
unteer service, many American fami-
lies are completely untouched by the 
war. Only 1 percent of our adult popu-
lation serves in the military. 
We have an interesting dynamic that 
may be sort of unique to our history, 
whether we have been at war for 20 
years and some only know permanent 
war, while many other American fami-
lies know nothing about war because 
members of their families don’t serve 
in the military. 
We put war on a footing where it can 
go on forever, sort of like on ‘‘Execu-
tive autopilot’’ by Presidential order, 
and Congress, in my view—and, again, 
this is bipartisan—has hidden from its 
responsibilities. 
At this moment of very grave danger, 
where both Americans and Iranians are 
losing their lives in hostilities, it is 
time for Congress to shoulder the bur-
den of making the most important de-
cision we will ever face. That is why I 
intend to bring this resolution to the 
floor of the Senate and ask my col-
leagues to debate and vote on it in the 
coming weeks. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST— 
S. CON. RES. 32 
Mr. 
MARKEY. 
Madam 
President, 
Members of the Senate, I rise first to 
express my grave concern over Presi-
dent Trump’s recent actions and words 
that have brought us to the brink of an 
unauthorized war with Iran. 
Today I am introducing a resolution 
with Senator WARREN
and Senators 
LEAHY
and REED
and BOOKER
and 
WYDEN because, on Saturday, President 
Trump tweeted that his administration 
is targeting 52 sites, some of which are 
cultural sites treasured by the Iranian 
people. 
My resolution is very simple. It says 
that attacks on cultural sites in Iran 
are war crimes. It is as straightforward 
as that. 
The President would compound the 
mistake he has made and turn it into 
something that could be catastrophic 
for that region, for our country, for the 
world. 
President Trump’s repeated threats 
to add Iranian cultural sites to his 
military target list is a betrayal of 
American values. It is wrong. It is a 
needless 
escalation 
which 
ignores 
international law and the Defense De-
partment’s own policies. Attacking 
cultural sites is a violation of inter-
national law. 
Article 53 of protocol 1 to the Geneva 
Conventions prohibits any act of hos-
tility against cultural objects, includ-
ing making cultural sites the target of 
reprisals. 
The 1954 Hague Convention for the 
Protection of Cultural Property in the 
Event of Armed Conflict, which has 
been ratified by this body, also pro-
hibits the attack or destruction of cul-
tural sites. 
Attacking cultural sites would also 
violate the Defense Department’s own 
policies. The Department of Defense 
Law of War Manual states that cul-
tural property, the areas immediately

surrounding it, and appliances in use 
for its protection should be safeguarded 
and respected. 
The fact that President Trump’s 
threatened attacks of cultural sites in 
Iran violate international law and De-
partment of Defense policies may be 
why, 
yesterday, 
Defense 
Secretary 
Mark Esper appeared forced to con-
tradict the President. 
When asked if cultural sites would be 
targeted as the President had sug-
gested over the weekend, Secretary 
Esper stated that the United States 
‘‘follow[s] the laws of armed conflict.’’ 
Well, the U.S. Senate then should 
speak clearly with one voice to tell 
President Trump it does not condone 
attacks on cultural sites in Iran. Given 
Secretary Esper’s comments yesterday, 
I cannot see why my friends on the 
other side of the aisle would not sup-
port this resolution to make that 
statement very clear and to make it 
now before Iran potentially retaliates 
against us, and the President begins to 
select the targets inside of Iran. 
Attacking cultural sites is what ISIS 
does. It is what al-Qaida does. It is 
what the world’s most heinous terror-
ists do. There is no excuse for the 
President to threaten war crimes by in-
tentionally targeting the cultural sites 
of another country. This is not who we 
are. We are the United States of Amer-
ica. We are better than this. We actu-
ally fight against this. We condemn 
ISIS. We condemn others who destroy 
the culturally sacred objects in other 
countries. 
Just a few years ago, in 2017, the 
Trump administration itself opposed 
and condemned the unlawful destruc-
tion of cultural heritage at the hands 
of ISIS. As a top U.S. official to the 
United Nations, U.S. Deputy Perma-
nent 
Representative 
to 
the 
U.N. 
Michele Sison said on the President’s 
behalf: 
The unlawful destruction or trafficking of 
cultural heritage is deplorable. We unequivo-
cally oppose it and we will take all feasible 
steps to halt, limit, and to discourage it. 
Now the President himself is threat-
ening to engage in exactly these sorts 
of illegal and reprehensible attacks on 
Iran. 
The United States had a choice to 
make during World War II because our 
military kept putting Japan’s ancient 
capital Kyoto back on the target list 
for the atomic bomb. Kyoto is home to 
more than 2,000 Buddhist temples, 
Shinto shrines, including 17 world her-
itage sites. 
It was Secretary of War Henry 
Stimson who went directly to Presi-
dent Truman to argue that Kyoto 
should be removed because ‘‘the bitter-
ness which would be caused by such a 
wanton act might make it impossible 
during the long post-war period to rec-
oncile the Japanese to us.’’ 
So if we want any ultimate reconcili-
ation with Iran, we cannot allow Don-
ald Trump to order the destruction of 
the cultural history of Iran so that rec-
onciliation may never be possible. 
Imagine the outcry the American peo-
ple would have if our symbols of cul-
tural 
heritage 
were 
destroyed—the 
Statue of Liberty destroyed; Independ-
ence Hall, where the Declaration of 
Independence 
and 
the 
Constitution 
were drafted, destroyed; the memorials 
along the National Mall destroyed. 
These places house and embody our 
collective history and the culture of 
the United States of America. 
The 
assassination 
of 
General 
Soleimani was a massive, deliberate, 
and dangerous escalation of conflict 
with Iran. What conditions prompt us 
to go to war? The U.S. Constitution 
and the War Powers Act leave little 
ambiguity. 
The 
Congress, 
not 
the 
President, has the power to make or 
authorize the war. The Congress has 
the authority to determine when and 
how we go to war. 
We cannot and must not get drawn 
into a costly war with Iran. We need to 
deescalate now. But President Trump’s 
threat to illegally attack cultural sites 
in Iran only aligns us with the world’s 
most sinister and draws us further 
along the path to war. 
Some might say: Well, Secretary of 
Defense Esper says that President 
Trump will not do this. Let me read 
you President Trump’s tweet at 5:52 
p.m. on Saturday evening. Here is what 
he said: ‘‘targeted 52 Iranian sites . . . 
some at a very high level & important 
to Iran & the Iranian culture, and 
those targets, and Iran itself, WILL BE 
HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD.’’ 
That was by the President of the 
United States just Saturday night at 
5:52 p.m., and we are supposed to be as-
sured by Secretary of Defense Esper 
that we don’t have to worry? 
Well, here is what we have learned in 
just the last couple of days. The gen-
erals were stunned. The generals were 
shocked that President Trump ordered 
the assassination of Soleimani. So we 
can’t depend upon the representations 
of Secretary Esper. 
We have to make a statement our-
selves because no one in his adminis-
tration controls Donald Trump. If he 
says that he is going to target the most 
valuable cultural sites inside Iran, we 
should believe him. He does what he 
says he is going to do. He wanted to 
kill Soleimani. Even if the generals 
were shocked, he did it. 
He doesn’t understand the long-term 
consequences. From his perspective, 
just get over it. Well, if we sow the 
wind, we are going to reap the whirl-
wind in Iran. 
If the President decides to take the 
next step after Iran retaliates—and 
they say that they are—and these sa-
cred cultural sites are on the list, then 
taking 
Secretary 
Stimson’s 
advice 
from World War II, our ability to ever 
reconcile may be impossible. 
This is the moment that we have to 
speak as a Senate because we do not 
know how much time will elapse before 
Iran strikes back at us, as they have 
promised. We should make our state-
ment right now to Donald Trump in 
the Oval Office that we do not want 
him under any circumstances to order 
the destruction of the most sacred cul-
tural sites inside Iran. It would be a 
war crime. It would be a violation of 
the Geneva Convention. It would be a 
violation of the Hague Convention. It 
would have catastrophic consequences 
for our country and for the Middle East 
for a generation. So this is the time for 
us to speak—before it happens, before 
the President fulfills his promise to de-
stroy those sites. 
He is the Commander in Chief. He 
said that he wants to do this. He just 
killed—assassinated—the top military 
official, the second most powerful per-
son in Iran, to the shock of his own 
generals. So do not think for a second 
he will not do this. 
This is a potential tragedy for our 
country. This is a potential source of 
eternal friction between our two coun-
tries. Reconciliation with Iran would 
become nearly impossible. So let’s 
make this statement as the U.S. Sen-
ate. Let’s follow up on what Secretary 
of Defense Esper represents as the posi-
tion of President Trump and of the ad-
ministration—that they don’t want to 
destroy it. But let’s make the state-
ment because we know that the De-
fense Secretary just may not speak for 
Donald Trump. No one speaks for Don-
ald Trump. Only his tweets speak for 
Donald Trump, and we know what his 
tweet said: ‘‘at a very high level & im-
portant to Iran & the Iranian culture, 
and those targets, and Iran itself, 
WILL BE HIT VERY FAST AND VERY 
HARD.’’ 
We have a chance here to make a 
statement before this happens. Fore-
warned is forearmed. We have been 
forewarned, and our ability to act is 
with a unanimous resolution here from 
the floor of the U.S. Senate, saying to 
the President as Secretary Stimson 
said to President Truman in 1945: Do 
not do this, Mr. President. It will be a 
mistake of historic proportions and a 
war crime. Do not order a war crime to 
be conducted in the name of the Amer-
ican people. 
So the resolution that I bring to the 
floor is intended to have this body vote 
and vote unanimously for him not to 
take that action. This is our moment 
to speak before he compounds his origi-
nal mistake—the assassination of Gen-
eral Soleimani—and turns it into a 
tragedy, which we will have to live 
with for a generation. 
Madam President, as in legislative 
session, I ask unanimous consent that 
the Senate proceed to the immediate 
consideration of S. Con. Res. 32 sub-
mitted earlier today. I further ask that 
the concurrent resolution be agreed to, 
the preamble be agreed to, and the mo-
tion to reconsider be considered made 
and laid upon the table with no inter-
vening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection?

listening to this, and a lot of the Amer-
ican people do too. My good friend from 
Massachusetts has said things that I 
know he actually believes. He actually 
believes it. 
Here we are with the President of the 
United States, who has given us, over 
the objections of the gentleman, my 
friend from Massachusetts, the best 
economy we have had maybe in my 
lifetime. You could argue that. He has 
been able to do this two ways. One was 
a way that was designed first by a 
Democrat—by John Kennedy—when he 
said that the best way to increase rev-
enue is to reduce marginal rates, and it 
worked. Unfortunately, President Ken-
nedy died after that. 
Then we have the judges right now; 
we have, right now, over 170 judges. 
The unique thing about this is that 
these are judges who are really con-
stitutional judges. They have read the 
Constitution. That is a unique notion. 
Then the military—again, it is hard 
to sit here and listen to someone who 
has that level—you hear so much ha-
tred about this President, but he is get-
ting so many great things done. If you 
look at the military, not many people 
know this—now, I chair the Armed 
Services Committee—but we know that 
during the Obama administration, dur-
ing the last 5 years—this would have 
been from 2010 to 2015—he reduced the 
budget for the military by 25 percent in 
constant dollars. That has never hap-
pened before, even after World War I 
and World War II when reductions took 
place. This was even more than that at 
a time when you can argue it was the 
most dangerous time in history. So, 
here the President has been responsible 
for that, yet there is so much hatred 
out there. 
The 
issue 
at 
hand 
now 
with 
Soleimani—this gentleman’s resolution 
is rather interesting. He is talking 
about cultural sites. I can remember at 
the very beginning of the Trump ad-
ministration, he went out of his way to 
protect cultural sites. If you talk to 
different people of minority religions 
in different countries, they talk about 
what he has done to protect minority 
rights and sites—churches that have 
been torn down. So here is a guy, our 
President, who has been right in the 
middle of the very thing he has been 
accused of offending. 
I note that Secretary Esper has made 
it quite clear that the United States 
will follow the laws of armed conflict. 
I appreciate the spirit of Senator 
MARKEY’s resolution opposing attacks 
on cultural sites. I agree with that. 
However, since our votes carry the 
force of law, we need to be specific in 
our resolutions. It is simply not true 
that attacking cultural sites is always 
a war crime because there are many in-
stances in which cultural sites have 
been used as staging grounds for hos-
tilities. We all know that. I can give 
you examples for that. 
President Clinton noted in his mes-
sage to the Senate when he sent the 
Hague cultural property convention 
over for ratification almost exactly 21 
years ago on January 6, 1999, and I am 
quoting from it: 
Cultural property is protected from inten-
tional attacks so long as it is not being used 
for military purposes or otherwise may be 
regarded as a military objective. Misuse may 
subject such property to attack. 
That is a direct quote. 
To be clear, I am not saying that we 
should target cultural sites, but we 
certainly should not restrict our mili-
tary’s ability to defend itself with 
rogue actors appropriating cultural 
sites for attacks or strategic reasons. 
The use of a cultural site to construct 
IEDs, launch missiles, or give snipers 
carte blanche against our forces is not 
accounted for in this resolution. 
I therefore object to this resolution 
on those grounds and hope that the res-
olution will be amended to acknowl-
edge an exception for when cultural 
sites are used for staging military at-
tacks or other improper purposes. 
I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Massachusetts. 
MEASURE REFERRED—S. CON. RES. 32 
Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the con-
current resolution be referred to the 
appropriate committee. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, just 
in response to the Senator from Okla-
homa, it is deeply disheartening when, 
on the floor of the U.S. Senate, we can-
not agree to a simple commitment that 
the United States of America should 
never engage in military actions that 
are war crimes by attacking cultural 
sites in Iran. 
When ISIS attacks cultural sites in 
the Middle East, we condemn that be-
cause we know what the impact on the 
cultures of those countries will be. 
When al-Qaida attacked us on Sep-
tember 11, 2001, which targets did they 
select? They selected the World Trade 
Center, the symbol of capitalism in the 
United States. They selected the Pen-
tagon, the symbol of our defense. And 
but for those brave passengers on that 
plane in Pennsylvania, when they said 
‘‘Let’s roll,’’ that target could have 
been the Capitol Building of the United 
States of America where we are stand-
ing right now, the symbol of Democ-
racy. They knew what they were 
doing—they 
were 
striking 
at 
cap-
italism, at our Defense Department, 
and at our democracy—and they knew 
what the impact would have been on 
our country. 
So we have a choice to make right 
now out here on the floor of the Sen-
ate, and that is to make a statement 
before we do that to the Iranians be-
cause we ourselves experienced it, and 
we know what our reaction was. They 
will rise up in a way that will make it 
impossible to reconcile. We will be in 
eternal war in the Middle East. 
My request to the Members is to have 
this resolution come back out here on 
the floor. I understand the gentleman’s 
objection, but the President could be 
ordering additional retaliatory strikes 
against the Iranians within a week if 
the Iranians are good for their word 
that they are going to hit us. We have 
to be sure that if the President does 
that, he does so in a way that does not 
commit a war crime and that does not 
destroy these culturally significant 
parts of the Iranian culture that go 
back thousands of years. It would be 
something that ultimately would be 
catastrophic. 
We are better than this. We are the 
United States of America. President 
Trump has already made one mistake 
in assassinating General Soleimani. We 
should not allow him to compound that 
mistake. 
Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I re-
quest a parliamentary inquiry. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the 
Senator yield for a parliamentary in-
quiry? 
Mr. MARKEY. I yield to Senator 
INHOFE. 
Mr. INHOFE. I am just asking, are 
we in a period of morning business? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are 
not. 
Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that at the conclu-
sion of the remarks of my friend from 
Massachusetts, I be recognized for such 
time as I shall consume. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. MARKEY. Madam President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Massachusetts. 
Mr. MARKEY. I yield back. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, 5 
days ago, President Trump made the 
boldest defensive policy decision of his 
Presidency to date. He authorized the 
airstrike against the leader of Iran’s 
Quds Force, Soleimani, in accordance 
with his authorities as Commander in 
Chief of the United States under article 
II of the Constitution. 
Let’s remember who Soleimani was. 
He was a terrorist. He was responsible 
for training and funding militias across 
the Middle East—the very militias that 
have targeted American personnel, our 
facilities, and our partners for decades. 
He was behind the plot to assassinate 
the Saudi Ambassador in Washington. 
That was back in 2011. He has been 
doing this for a long time now. He was 
responsible for the brutal repression of 
democratic protests within Iran. The 
terrorist groups he armed and trained 
attacked our partners, including Israel. 
Some of the people out there are 
more focused on criticizing President 
Trump for taking out Soleimani than 
they are on protecting American dip-
lomats and American troops, conven-
iently forgetting that Soleimani is the 
architect of Iran’s terrorism and is re-
sponsible for over 600 American deaths 
during the Iraqi war. When you stop 
and think about how bad he is, it just 
doesn’t get any worse than that.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S50 
January 7, 2020 
We hear a lot recently about get-
ting—I am very happy this President 
was able to put together something and 
take out al-Baghdadi, but this guy was 
worse 
than 
al-Baghdadi—you 
can 
argue, even worse than bin Laden. 
Their justification for criticizing the 
President for killing a terrorist who 
wanted to destroy America—stated it 
many times—they think it was reck-
less and represents a rush to war. Noth-
ing could be further from the truth. 
Just remember how we got where we 
are today. 
Remember the Obama apology tour? 
I remember it well. When he first came 
into office, he went around talking 
about—all around to our adversaries 
and our friends alike talking about 
how bad America was. We remember 
that, and it was a game changer for our 
behavior throughout the world at that 
time. 
First, American credibility hit an 
all-time low under the Obama adminis-
tration. President Obama set a redline 
in Syria. We all remember that redline 
in Syria. That was because Syria was 
using weapons of mass destruction, and 
President Obama said: If you continue 
to do that, we will, you know, take you 
out—words to that effect. Well, then 
the redline occurred when Syria start-
ed dropping weapons of mass destruc-
tion on its own people there. Now, that 
kind of, I think, changed the thinking 
of does America mean what they say? 
To make matters worse, Obama 
signed a deal with Iran that didn’t ad-
dress Iran’s support for terrorism at 
all. It gave Iran over $100 billion, in-
cluding $1.7 billion in cash. That was a 
John Kerry thing. That was when John 
Kerry was the Secretary of State and 
President Obama was the President. At 
that time, $1.7 billion was given to this 
terrorist group in small bills, in foreign 
currency, 
for 
obvious 
reasons—you 
don’t have to stop and think that 
through—but then, in addition, over 
$100 billion, and they even admitted at 
that time that that could be used to 
expand terrorist activities. 
One of the quotes in 2016—and I wrote 
it down, and I have used it many times 
since then—I want you to listen to 
this. This is a quote from John Kerry 
in 2016. He said: ‘‘I think that some of 
it will end up in the hands of the IRGC 
or other entities, some of which are la-
beled terrorists.’’ John Kerry also said: 
‘‘You know, to some degree, I’m not 
going to sit here and tell you that 
every component of that can be pre-
vented.’’ 
So is it any wonder that Iran’s re-
gional aggression has only gotten bold-
er and bolder? Look what has happened 
just in the last few months. In May of 
this year, the Iranians attacked oil 
tankers with land mines. We know 
about that. In June, they shot down a 
U.S. drone. It is a U.S. drone. By the 
way, the cost of that was classified for 
a while. It is not classified anymore. It 
was in excess of $100 million. That is 
what they did. What did our President 
do? He sat back, and it didn’t cause 
him to get all excited. He handled it in 
a very diplomatic way. Then, in Sep-
tember, they attacked the Saudi oil-
fields, taking some 50 percent of Saudi 
Arabia’s oil production capability off-
line. 
President Trump showed incredible 
restraint after each one of those provo-
cations. He responded by increasing 
pressure on Iran—ramping up economic 
sanctions and increasing their diplo-
matic isolation but not anything that 
would suggest getting into any type of 
violence at that time. 
The President avoided military ac-
tion while setting a very clear redline. 
And what was the redline? He said: So 
long as you don’t kill an American—if 
you kill an American, we are going to 
come after you. That is the redline. 
That is a redline that 95 percent of the 
people in America agree with. 
On December 27, Iran crossed that 
redline. Soleimani directed the attack 
that killed an American and wounded 
four other servicemembers. President 
Trump made it clear that there were 
consequences for spilling American 
blood. He said: You kill an American, 
we are going to come after you. And he 
is dead now. 
Iran never believed there would be 
consequences. After all, Obama never 
enforced his redline, and even Presi-
dent Trump was hesitant to use mili-
tary force. Only a day before the strike 
that killed Soleimani, Iran’s Supreme 
Leader tweeted at our President—in 
fact, you have to read this. This is a 
tweet that came from him to the Presi-
dent: ‘‘That guy has tweeted that we 
see Iran responsible for the events in 
Baghdad & we will respond to Iran. 1st: 
You can’t do anything.’’ This is a guy 
telling our President ‘‘You can’t do 
anything.’’ That is a quote. That whole 
thing is a quote that came from him. 
They never believed there would be 
consequences, but there were con-
sequences. 
Only a day before the strike, he said: 
‘‘You can’t do anything.’’ We are talk-
ing 
about 
Iran’s 
Supreme 
Leader 
tweeting to our President of the United 
States ‘‘You can’t do anything.’’ Obvi-
ously, they know better than that. 
Well, President Trump could, and he 
did. He actually restored America’s 
credibility 
around 
the 
world. 
He 
showed that we mean what we say. 
You tell me what is reckless—they 
talk about this as reckless—a Presi-
dent who means what he says and 
takes the protection of American lives 
seriously or the fringe Democrats who 
want to tie the President’s hands and 
deny him the tools to uphold his con-
stitutional responsibility to defend our 
citizens? 
You know, right now before this Sen-
ate, there is a resolution—not the one 
my friend from Massachusetts was 
talking about but another one that 
would take away a lot of the Presi-
dent’s powers of negotiation. We are 
talking about powers that are there as 
a result of article II of the Constitu-
tion. That is what our President has— 
those constitutional powers. Yet the 
President did not use military force 
until they crossed the redline, and that 
is not a rush to war. 
Listen to folks like former Demo-
cratic Senator Joe Lieberman. I served 
here in the Senate with Senator Joe 
Lieberman. He is a Democrat. I have 
one of the quotes that he said just re-
cently in analyzing this. I don’t recall, 
but I think he was here probably about 
25 years. This is a quote from Demo-
crat Joe Lieberman, a former Senator: 
President Trump’s order to take out 
Qasem Soleimani was morally, constitu-
tionally and strategically correct. It de-
serves more bipartisan support than the be-
grudging or negative reactions it has re-
ceived thus far from my fellow Democrats. 
That is a quote. 
We have another one from about the 
same timeframe, just recently. Listen 
to Obama’s Secretary of Homeland Se-
curity. I got to know him. His name is 
Jeh Johnson. He was one who was emi-
nently qualified for that position and 
did a good job while he was there. This 
is what he said about the action with 
Soleimani, which the President is 
being accused of all these terrible 
things about. This is from the Sec-
retary of Homeland Security under 
President Obama. Jeh Johnson said: 
He was a lawful military objective, and the 
president, under his constitutional authority 
as commander in chief, had ample domestic 
legal authority to take him out without an 
additional 
congressional 
authorization. 
Whether he was a terrorist or a general in a 
military force that was engaged in armed at-
tacks against our people, he was a lawful 
military objective. 
Everything that this President did 
was perfectly appropriate, and these 
are two prominent Democrats who 
have come out with this. 
So, you know, there are a lot of peo-
ple out there who are pretty fed up 
with what has been going on with at-
tacking the president and impeach-
ment. I keep hearing that something is 
going to happen this week in terms of 
sending over the articles, and I don’t 
know—I have a personal opinion that a 
lot of people don’t agree with, I am 
sure. I don’t think even the Speaker 
knows right now just what is going to 
happen. Are the articles going to come 
over? I think a lot of her far-left 
friends are saying: Yeah, let’s go over 
there and let’s continue this thing. 
Let’s continue beating up the Presi-
dent. But she also has a bunch of her 
liberal friends who are saying: Look, 
the polls don’t look too good. People 
are onto this. They realize that there is 
a problem. Maybe we shouldn’t be send-
ing them at all. 
We will find out tomorrow. I under-
stand there is a big Democratic meet-
ing. I am not invited. There is one over 
in the House. They are going to make 
a determination, and we will all find 
out at that time what is going to hap-
pen to the Articles of Impeachment. 
But again, Soleimani was a lawful 
military objective—one that President 
Trump took out under article II au-
thority. More to the point, nobody is

talking about war. Nobody is calling 
for an invasion. Nobody is calling for a 
ramp-up. We all know what that looks 
like here, and it is very plainly not 
what is happening. An airstrike is not 
war. Defending American lives is not 
war. The President has made it clear 
that he does not desire war, which is 
why he has continued to call for nego-
tiations with Iran to end the standoff, 
and that is the very thing some people 
are trying to take away from him. It is 
not just a constitutional right; it is a 
constitutional responsibility. 
Nobody here wants war, but at the 
same time, nobody should want a pol-
icy that would leave Americans vulner-
able to the whims of Iran’s terrorist- 
supporting regime. If we do that, if we 
tie the President’s hands so that he 
cannot defend American lives, we leave 
ourselves more vulnerable and there-
fore make war imminently more like-
ly. That would be reckless. 
I would just be anxious for this time 
period to get by so we don’t have to be 
facing this on a daily basis. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CAS-
SIDY). The Senator from Arkansas. 
75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BATTLE OF THE 
BULGE 
Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize members of the 
Greatest Generation who courageously 
helped to defeat the German Army at 
the Battle of the Bulge and who dealt 
a critical blow to the Nazi regime. 
On this day 75 years ago, American 
soldiers continued the resilience they 
had demonstrated for 4 weeks. On De-
cember 16, 1944, in the Ardennes Forest 
of the Luxembourg and Belgium area, 
American soldiers were unexpectedly 
attacked by the Germans. Allied forces 
were 
unprepared. 
They 
were 
out-
numbered and facing record-low tem-
peratures and dwindling supplies, but, 
still, the men on the frontlines dug in 
to defend against the enemy. 
Arkansan Bill Strauss was one of the 
brave men who faced the bitter cold 
and dire conditions. With lack of sleep 
and shortage of food, he and his fellow 
troops endured this extreme test of will 
and resolve. 
I met with Bill in 2019 to help him 
celebrate 
his 
100th 
birthday 
and 
thanked him for his service and contin-
ued commitment to sharing his experi-
ences with others. It has been 75 years, 
but Bill’s recollection of the details of 
the unimaginable circumstances he 
faced was still very clear. He talks 
about his memories as part of the Bat-
tle of the Bulge in order to honor his 
fellow soldiers who weren’t so fortu-
nate, as well as to teach succeeding 
generations about the realities of war 
and the remarkable perseverance of 
American troops. 
The 6-week battle demonstrated the 
commitment, courage, and resilience of 
Bill and all the American soldiers. It 
was the largest battle ever fought by 
the U.S. Army. British Prime Minister 
Winston Churchill called it ‘‘the great-
est American battle of the war.’’ It 
came at a considerable cost. More than 
89,000 American soldiers were casual-
ties, including 19,000 soldiers who were 
killed, 47,500 who were wounded, and 
23,000 who were captured or missing in 
action. 
The people of Belgium and Luxem-
bourg have a close place in their hearts 
for American soldiers who sacrificed 
their lives on foreign soil. They con-
tinue to display that gratitude today. 
A couple of weeks ago, I led a group 
of my fellow Senators to both coun-
tries to commemorate the 75th anni-
versary of the Battle of the Bulge. We 
experienced how the town of Bastogne, 
Belgium, observes this anniversary. 
The tremendous community support 
was welcoming of American veterans 
whom fate had brought together in 1944 
there in the town and in the nearby 
forest to defend Bastogne and hold off 
the German advance. 
I was honored to visit with American 
veterans who fought in the battle and 
were returning to the land they had de-
fended. There are fewer and fewer who 
are able to join, but that doesn’t di-
minish what they did there or the 
steadfast way they fought and sac-
rificed in the name of freedom. 
My colleagues and I also had the 
unique opportunity to witness the cere-
mony by the 101st Airborne Division 
among the foxholes in Belgium. These 
foxholes, once occupied by soldiers, in-
cluding those from Easy Company, the 
heroes immortalized in the celebrated 
‘‘The Band of Brothers’’ book and mini-
series, remain preserved. They stand as 
a stark reminder of the bitter cold and 
inhospitable conditions our soldiers 
withstood for so many days. This sol-
emn ceremony was a special way to re-
member those who had fought and to 
honor those whose lives were taken too 
early. 
Following World War II, the Belgium 
people raised money to build a memo-
rial to show their appreciation for the 
selfless sacrifice of Americans troops. 
The Mardasson Memorial was dedi-
cated in 1950. The walls of the star- 
shaped structure commemorate the 
battle, paying tribute to the units that 
fought there and representing the 
States where those wounded or whose 
lives were lost hailed from. 
This memorial is in need of repairs. 
That is why I support legislation that 
Senator TILLIS introduced that would 
let experts at the American Battle 
Monuments Commission oversee its 
restoration. 
Maintaining this memorial is critical 
to making sure what the monument 
stands for: the service and the sac-
rifices made by Americans at the Bat-
tle of the Bulge, and that will continue 
to be remembered for generations to 
come. I encourage my colleagues to 
support this bill so future generations 
can reflect on the heroism and bravery 
of our troops. 
We can be proud of the unwavering 
bravery of the American servicemem-
bers and the Allied forces whose efforts 
defeated the German attack and led to 
the end of the Nazi regime. 
It is fitting that we recognize the 
75th anniversary of a battle that both 
shaped the future of combat and ush-
ered in a new year of comity between 
Europe and the United States. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, 
first, I thank the Senator from Arkan-
sas for his wonderful remarks. We had 
a similar event in Rhode Island with 
veterans of the Battle of the Bulge who 
recounted their stories and who were 
celebrated by our State leaders, our ad-
jutant general, and a crowd of admir-
ers. It was a wonderful moment and a 
wonderful memory. So I thank him for 
calling it up on the Senate floor. 
CLIMATE CHANGE 
Mr. President, here we are in 2020, 
and I am still coming to the floor to 
try to wake this Chamber up to the 
perils of climate change—pathetic. 
Why do I have to be doing another 
one of these speeches? Why don’t we 
heed the warnings of our foremost sci-
entists, of our military, of top financial 
institutions—heck, of our own home 
State universities? What does it take 
to get our attention around here? 
Why is the fossil fuel industry’s un-
limited dark money still flooding our 
politics? Why are the biggest lobbying 
forces in Washington, like the U.S. 
Chamber of Commerce, rated as Amer-
ica’s worst climate obstructors? Where 
are those trade group members who 
claim to support climate action when 
their own groups are leading the ob-
struction? What is going on? 
Who around here is so cynical as to 
still take fossil fuel money and block 
climate action? In 2020, how is that a 
legitimate deal? 
Who hasn’t noticed the world spin-
ning toward climate catastrophe—the 
forests burning, the seas rising, the 
ocean water acidifying, the glaciers 
melting? How can you miss that? 
To the liars, the deniers, the con-
nivers, and the stooges, I predict 2020 is 
going to be a bad year for you. The 
sand beneath your castle of lies is erod-
ing fast. Now, 2019 was a tough year for 
you, and 2020 will be worse. We are 
going to bring down your castle of lies. 
The fossil fuel industry campaign of 
obstruction hides behind an armada of 
phony front groups. In 2020, we will out 
you and your fossil fuel funding, too. 
To big oil companies that pretend to 
want progress, while still using that 
climate denial and obstruction appa-
ratus to attack the very progress you 
claim to want, we will out that truth. 
We will expose your two-facedness. 
The fossil fuel industry spoons up the 
biggest subsidy in the history of the 
planet. The International Monetary 
Fund estimates their global subsidy in 
the trillions of dollars every year— 
globally. In the United States alone, 
the fossil fuel industry was subsidized 
to the tune of $650 billion in 2015—the 
last year the IMF has calculated. We 
will out that massive subsidy and their 
dark money schemes to protect it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S52 
January 7, 2020 
The fossil fuel industry’s biggest 
schemers against climate action in 
Congress are the big corporate trade 
associations. The worst two are the 
U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Na-
tional Association of Manufacturers. 
The 
watchdog 
InfluenceMap 
outed 
NAM and the chamber in a virtual tie 
as the two most obstructive forces on 
climate change in America. That is 
some prize. 
The chamber works its evil in legisla-
tion, through regulatory action, in 
courts, in elections, even fighting 
State-level progress on carbon pollu-
tion. 
The chamber funded the phony de-
bunked report that President Trump 
used to disparage the Paris Agreement. 
The chamber stooged for the fossil 
fuel industry for years and got away 
with it, but 2019 saw an end to that. 
My colleagues and I took to social 
media, to op-ed pages, and to the Sen-
ate floor to out the chamber for its dis-
graceful record on climate change. We 
pushed on chamber members to de-
mand change within the organization. 
We countered the chamber with amicus 
briefs, laying out its dirty history, 
when its evil little head popped up in 
climate lawsuits. 
Senator WARREN and I lodged a com-
plaint with the Clerk of the House and 
the Secretary of the Senate over the 
chamber’s refusal to disclose who is be-
hind its lobbying activities—disclo-
sures, by the way, required by law. 
Senators 
even 
got 
hashtag 
‘‘ChamberofCarbon’’ trending on Twit-
ter, and I made a little yearend visit to 
the chamber to make, for no charge, a 
little correction to their sign out front, 
so that it says ‘‘Welcome to the U.S. 
Chamber of Carbon.’’ So we have been 
after them. 
By year’s end, there were signs of dis-
comfort over at the chamber. Up 
popped a post on its website that said 
that on climate ‘‘inaction is not an op-
tion.’’ Hell, for years, inaction had 
been their purpose. Now they say it is 
not an option. 
The chamber formed a new internal 
climate change working group. The 
‘‘Chamber of Carbon’’ even quietly 
posted that it reversed itself on the 
Paris Agreement and now was for stay-
ing in—OK, baby steps but in the right 
direction. 
I think the chamber and NAM be-
came America’s two worst climate ob-
structors because they were paid with 
fossil fuel dark money, and in 2020 I in-
tend to find that out. If the chamber is 
still taking fossil fuel money, it is hard 
to take those baby steps very seri-
ously. They are probably just PR to 
placate the chamber members who are 
embarrassed that their organization 
got caught and outed as a top climate 
obstructor. 
For that prize, by the way, chamber 
members have a lot to be embarrassed 
about. Allstate, MetLife, IBM, FedEx, 
Bayer, Ford Motor, United Airlines, 
Delta, American—they all funded and 
directed a top climate obstructor. 
Really? 
Really? Did they know it? Did they 
know the chamber—their own organi-
zation—was secretly getting fossil fuel 
money 
to 
become 
a 
top 
climate 
obstructer? 
If they did know, by God, they have 
got some explaining to do. If they did 
not know, what standard of governance 
makes it OK for a board member to not 
even know who is funding your organi-
zation? So, look out, board members. 
We are not letting that go either. The 
year 2020 is when we intend to get to 
the bottom of all of this nasty mess. 
The real test for the chamber—not 
baby steps—will be whether it puts its 
back into passing a real comprehensive 
climate bill. Will the chamber stop 
scheming with climate denial organiza-
tions? Will the chamber stop opposing 
climate action candidates? Those are 
the tests. This, by the way, is not a PR 
test. It is not a PR test of how little 
you can get away with. This is a 
science test. It is a science test of how 
we keep our planet below 1.5 degrees 
Celsius, global warming. If we fail the 
science test, how well we did on the PR 
test is going to look pretty silly. 
Help us meet that 1.5 degrees Celsius. 
We will be talking, gladly. I look for-
ward to working with you. Until then, 
expect the pressure on you to rise in 
2020. 
We called out one other miscreant in 
2019: Marathon Petroleum. This gaso-
line refiner orchestrated the Trump at-
tack on fuel economy standards for 
automobiles. As I laid out in testimony 
in a House Oversight Subcommittee 
hearing last year, Marathon pressured 
Members of Congress, Governors, and 
the Trump administration. The corrupt 
Trump administration was only too 
eager to oblige, issuing an error-riddled 
proposal to freeze the fuel economy 
standards. 
The 
Trump 
administration 
went 
after California’s authority under the 
Clean Air Act to set fuel standards. 
Trump’s DOJ cooked up a bogus anti-
trust investigation, I believe, to punish 
the automakers that had worked with 
California to hammer out a separate 
deal on fuel economy standards that 
defeated Marathon’s scheme. 
It looks like the Trump administra-
tion also pressured automakers to sup-
port the administration’s legal battle 
with California, and 2020 is the year I 
hope we expose all this. 
In 2019, investors started noticing 
Marathon’s bad behavior on climate. In 
fact, in September, 200 investors with 
$6.5 trillion in assets under manage-
ment sent a letter to 47 U.S. compa-
nies, including Marathon, to urge those 
companies to align their lobbying with 
the Paris Agreement 2 degrees Celsius 
climate goal and to warn that their 
lobbying against that goal is an invest-
ment risk. 
Well, the four biggest shareholders in 
Marathon are BlackRock, JPMorgan, 
State Street, and Vanguard. They 
claim to care about climate. We will 
see, in 2020, if they keep condoning all 
this Marathon misbehavior. 
Happily, there are some things the 
crooked fossil fuel industry apparatus 
can’t stop. Even with its massive sub-
sidy for fossil fuel, renewables are 
starting to win on price. New green en-
ergy technologies are powering up, like 
offshore wind and battery storage. 
Electric vehicles are driving cost down 
and performance up for consumers. Old 
coal plants are closing—546 since 2010. 
New coal plants are unfinanceable, and 
2019 saw Murray Energy become the 
eighth coal company in a year to file 
for bankruptcy and the biggest drop in 
coal consumption ever. 
Another trend the industry couldn’t 
stop was economists, central bankers, 
Wall Street, real estate professionals, 
and asset managers waking up to the 
crash risks that climate change poses 
to the global economy. It is not just 
that it is wrecking our atmosphere and 
oceans 
and 
climate. 
Our 
economy 
stands on those pillars, and at some 
point there will be economic crashes. 
Climate crash warnings used to be 
scarce. 
Now 
they 
are 
everywhere. 
Freddie Mac warns that rising sea lev-
els will prompt a crash in coastal prop-
erty values worse than the housing 
crash that caused the 2008 financial cri-
sis. 
First Street Foundation found that 
rising seas have already resulted in $16 
billion in lost property values in coast-
al homes from Maine to Mississippi. 
Moody’s warns that climate risk will 
trigger downgrades in coastal commu-
nities’ bond ratings. BlackRock esti-
mated that, by the end of the century, 
climate change will cause coastal com-
munities annual losses that could aver-
age up to 15 percent of local GDP—av-
erage up to 15 percent of local GDP— 
with the hardest hit communities hit 
far worse. Look out, Florida. By the 
way, Louisiana is not too far from 
Florida. 
The Bank of England, the Bank of 
France, the Bank of Canada, and the 
European Central Bank—backed by 
top-tier, peer-reviewed economic pa-
pers—are all warning of systemic eco-
nomic risk—‘‘systemic economic risk’’ 
is economist-speak for risk to the en-
tire economy—from stranded fossil fuel 
assets, the so-called carbon asset bub-
ble. On top of that, the Commodity Fu-
tures Trading Commission here in the 
United States has launched a climate 
risk review. Even the Trump Fed is 
starting to echo those warnings with 
reports out of local Federal Reserve 
banks. 
It is not just big institutions that are 
grasping the risks of climate change. I 
visited Louisiana, Wyoming, and Colo-
rado last year to hear about climate 
change and see what red- and purple- 
State Americans are doing about it. 
The answer is: plenty. 
In Louisiana, sea level rise and sub-
sidence are megathreats. I met a hun-
ter and fisherman whose personal ef-
forts to restore marshland have al-
lowed his local delta wetlands to re-
bound from mismanagement. A sci-
entist with the National Wildlife Fed-
eration counted over 30 species of birds

just while we were standing around 
waiting to board the boat. 
The sights and sounds of a healthy 
marsh were an encouraging reminder of 
nature’s ability to find a way to not 
only survive but to flourish if we give 
her a chance. 
In Wyoming—well, don’t get me 
wrong—climate change isn’t always a 
popular subject. The State is basically 
run by the fossil fuel industry, but 
there I met a younger generation that 
really gets it. I will not forget the de-
termination of leading winter sports 
athletes in Jackson fighting to pre-
serve their winters; nor, in Lander, the 
impassioned argument for climate ac-
tion from a young outdoor instructor 
from NOLS, National Outdoor Leader-
ship School; nor, out at their campsite, 
the fire-lit, passionate faces of Central 
Wyoming College students on their 
way up to take glacier measurements, 
who well understand the stakes of cli-
mate change for their future and the 
future of the State they love. 
Typically, these climate road trips 
that I do land me in States where the 
fight for climate change may need a 
little, say, boost. The opposite was true 
in Colorado. It is a State on a major 
climate winning streak: a State of good 
climate bills passed during the last leg-
islative session; their biggest public 
utility transitioning to renewable en-
ergy, building impressive renewable en-
ergy and electric vehicle infrastruc-
ture; and leading research institutes 
bringing new renewable energy tech-
nologies to the marketplace. 
The year 2019 also showed polling 
that showed climate action was becom-
ing a top issue for American voters ev-
erywhere. A big part is young voters— 
and 
especially 
young 
Republicans. 
More 
than 
three-fourths 
of 
all 
millennials and a majority of millen-
nial Republicans agree on the need for 
climate action. Last year, a Republican 
former Member of Congress wrote 
about climate change: My party will 
never earn the votes of millennials un-
less it gets serious about finding solu-
tions. 
It is not just younger voters. Ameri-
cans of all ages and political stripes 
favor many of the solutions that sci-
entists and economists say are needed 
to tackle climate change. An October 
2019 Pew poll found that two-thirds of 
Americans believe the Federal Govern-
ment needs to do more to combat cli-
mate change. The same poll showed 77 
percent 
of 
Americans 
believe 
the 
United States ought to prioritize devel-
oping alternative energy over fossil 
fuels. 
So the decades-long fossil fuel cam-
paign of obstruction and lies and denial 
will not be tolerated much longer. 
In New England, in the springtime, a 
moment comes when the roof of your 
house warms up enough to send the 
snow sliding down off the roof in a big 
whumpf. The snow may have piled up 
slowly, over weeks and months, but it 
comes down all at once in a whumpf. 
The fossil fuel industry and its net-
work of front groups and trade associa-
tions have spent years piling up their 
crooked apparatus of climate obstruc-
tion. Increasingly, their evil behavior 
is facing blowback from the public and 
from regulators and from investors. 
Alarm bells are ringing ever louder 
from all quarters about the economic 
risks. 
Renewable energy and other green 
technologies are ever more cost com-
petitive. Awareness of climate change 
dangers is ever growing among the 
American people. These are all signs 
that the thaw, the whumpf, is near, and 
2020 could be the moment. 
I know things in Washington can 
seem hopeless, but 2019 gave me some 
reasons to hope. For 2020, well, it is 
game on to tear down the crooked cas-
tle of climate denial and solve this 
problem while still we can.

RMEMBERING DAVID BLEE 
Mr. RISCH. Madam President, I wish 
to commemorate the life of David Blee, 
who tragically passed away on Decem-
ber 29, 2019, at the age of 66. David was 
the founder and president of the United 
States 
Nuclear 
Industry 
Council, 
USNIC. During his long and distin-
guished career in the nuclear industry, 
David concentrated on nuclear supply 
chain and reactor technology and ac-
tively worked to increase support for 
nuclear power in the United States and 
abroad. David also worked with the Na-
tional Laboratories, including Idaho 
National Laboratory, often running 
conferences in conjunction with them. 
At the time of his passing, David held 
an appointment to the U.S. Depart-
ment of Commerce’s Civil Nuclear 
Trade Advisory Committee, CINTAC, 
an achievement that spoke to his in-
credible expertise. 
David graduated from Dickinson Col-
lege in Pennsylvania with a degree in 
economics, but he soon began working 
in politics and public service. After 
managing several political campaigns, 
David became chief of staff to former 
Representative and Senator Connie 
Mack while Mack served in the House 
of Representatives. David then served 
as a Deputy Assistant Secretary and, 
later, Director of Public Affairs for the 
U.S. Department of Energy during the 
Reagan administration. He also served 
as the executive vice president for NAC 
International, 
a 
U.S.-based 
energy 
services 
and 
technology 
company, 
where he directed the company’s world-
wide consulting group and marketing 
and business development portfolios. 
One of David’s best attributes was his 
ability to work with people and bring 
organizations together. Composed of 
over 80 companies, USNIC represents 
the ‘‘who’s who’’ of the nuclear energy 
supply chain, including technology de-
velopers, fuel cycle companies, and 
others that demonstrate the impor-
tance of maintaining the nuclear in-
dustry. These companies working in 
conjunction would not have been pos-
sible without the dedicated effort of 
David Blee. In July of last year, I was 
honored to be presented with the U.S. 
Nuclear Energy Distinguished Leader-
ship Award by USNIC. The coalition of 
groups attending that award ceremony 
personified the great unifying effect 
that David had on the nuclear indus-
try. He was a leader and a motivator, 
and his advocacy for the nuclear indus-
try will be remembered. I am grateful 
for the work that he completed during 
his lifetime and his lasting legacy as a 
respected leader in the nuclear field. 
f 
RECOGNIZING THE USS 
‘‘PITTSBURGH’’ 
Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I 
wish to recognize the service of the 
USS Pittsburgh and her crew for our 
country since the ship’s commissioning 
on November 23, 1985. 
A Los Angeles-class, fast-attack nu-
clear submarine, the Pittsburgh served 
for 35 years as an anti-submarine, 
strike, and anti-surface ship warfare 
vessel that also specialized in surveil-
lance and reconnaissance. The Pitts-
burgh 
deployed 
during 
Operation 
Desert Storm in 1991 and again during 
Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2002, con-
ducting Tomahawk missile strikes in 
both campaigns. While most of the ves-
sel’s missions remain classified, the 
Pittsburgh logged over 1,000 dives all 
over the world, including in the Arctic, 
Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans. 
The Pittsburgh was the U.S. Navy’s 
fourth ship to be named after the Steel 
City and during its time in service re-
tained a number of connections to its 
namesake. Over the years, multiple 
civic organizations have used the ship 
for outreach efforts, fundraisers, and 
crew visits to increase the public’s ap-
preciation for the Navy and the sub-
marine service. Local groups, such as 
the Pittsburgh Council of the Navy 
League and the Leetsdale, PA, chapter 
of the U.S. Submarine Veterans Incor-
porated, have kept in regular contact 
with the ship’s crew. Another local or-
ganization, called the Pittsburgh Foun-
dation, even administers a scholarship 
fund for the Pittsburgh’s crew and their 
families. 
The vessel’s motto, ‘‘Heart of Steel,’’ 
paid homage to the city’s cultural and 
industrial roots. The slogan is apt 
given that researchers at the Bettis 
Atomic Power Laboratory in West 
Mifflin, PA, just outside of Pittsburgh, 
are credited with designing portions of 
the nuclear technology outfitted on nu-
clear-propelled Navy vessels, including 
the Pittsburgh. 
On February 25, 2019, the submarine 
completed her final deployment, during 
which she traveled over 39,000 nautical 
miles and conducted three foreign port 
visits. Subsequently, the Pittsburgh de-
parted Groton, CT, for Bremerton, WA, 
for her final homeport change. On this 
final voyage, she became the first sub-
marine of her variant to complete an 
arctic transit. She is now undergoing 
the months-long decommissioning and 
inactivation process that will cul-
minate in a ceremony on January 17, 
2020. I send everyone involved in the 
ceremony the best of wishes. 
After 35 years of distinguished serv-
ice, I commend the USS Pittsburgh and 
her crew for their sustained commit-
ment to upholding our Nation’s de-
fense. I ask all of my colleagues to join 
me in recognition of the USS Pittsburgh 
upon her inactivation from the Navy.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING ROBERT L. ‘‘RED’’ 
MCKINNEY 
∑ Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise today with a heavy heart to 
pay tribute to Robert ‘‘Red’’ McKin-
ney, an outstanding friend and public 
servant. Sadly, Mr. McKinney passed 
away on December 24, 2019, at the age 
of 72. He will be remembered for his de-
votion to East Hampton and his bright, 
loving nature. 
Born in Hartford, CT, Red spent his 
entire life in East Hampton. He earned 
his higher education degrees in the 
State, as well, with an associate’s de-
gree from Mitchell College and a bach-
elor’s degree from Central Connecticut 
State University. Red spent five dec-
ades as a chemical specialist, focused 
in metal working fluids. For 40 years, 
he and his wife, Anne, co-owned a com-
mercial and residential property acqui-
sition and management company, HTA, 
LLC. 
Outside of his work, Red dedicated 
himself to supporting his community. 
Giving back to those around him 
brought Red an unparalleled joy, dat-
ing back to his role as a member of 
East Hampton Parks and Recreation in 
the 1970s. He was the youngest member 
of the East Hampton Board of Select-
men ever elected and proudly served 
for 4 years. Notably, Red also served as 
chairman of the East Hampton Demo-
cratic Town Committee for 10 years 
and remained a member for his entire 
life since 1974. 
That same year, he joined the East 
Hampton Rotary Club, making him the 
longest tenured member. His impres-
sive level of involvement is also evi-
dent through his over four-decade-long 
role as a charter member of the Old 
Home Days Association. The associa-
tion 
coordinates 
the 
annual 
East 
Hampton Old Home Day parade—a sig-
nature celebratory tradition attended 
by hundreds of people. As a regular 
participant in the parade, I saw first-
hand the professionalism and dedica-
tion that Red brought to that event. He 
was always a joy to talk with. 
Red was especially pleased to have 
the opportunity to celebrate the people

of his town and surrounding commu-
nities. He treasured the residents of 
East Hampton the same way he valued 
his close friends and family. 
Through his active role in these orga-
nizations and many others, including 
the Middle Haddam Library and Mid-
dlesex Hospital, Red positively im-
pacted countless members of his com-
munity. His commitment to supporting 
those 
around 
him 
was 
recognized 
through 
three 
Paul 
Harris 
Fellow 
Awards and numerous other honors. 
Red’s remarkable legacy of service is 
an inspiration to all of us and sets a 
model of service that will continue in 
East Hampton for years to come. 
My wife, Cynthia, and I extend our 
deepest sympathies to Red’s family 
during this difficult time, particularly 
to his wife, Anne, along with their chil-
dren and grandchildren. May their 
many wonderful memories of Red pro-
vide them solace and comfort.∑

RECOGNIZING POCATELLO 
ELECTRIC 
∑ Mr. RISCH. Madam President, as a 
member and former chairman of the 
Senate Committee on Small Business 
and Entrepreneurship, each month I 
recognize and celebrate the American 
entrepreneurial spirit by highlighting 
the success of a small business in my 
home State of Idaho. Today I am 
pleased to honor Pocatello Electric lo-
cated in Pocatello as the Idaho Small 
Business of the Month for January 2020. 
Max Schaefer opened Pocatello Elec-
tric in 1902 and sold the business to Ed 
Hall in the 1930s. The business became 
well known for its ‘‘free air and water 
at the curb,’’ which meant air for auto-
mobile tires and water for horses. Al 
Vigliaturo began working at Pocatello 
Electric in 1947 and eventually bought 
the 
business 
from

RECOGNIZING 
DELICATE 
PERI-
ODONTICS AND IMPLANT DEN-
TISTRY 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, as 
chairman of the Senate Committee on 
Small Business and Entrepreneurship, 
each week I highlight a small business 
that exemplifies the value of dignified 
work and the unique entrepreneurial 
spirit of our Nation. It is my privilege 
to recognize a Florida small business 
that is dedicated to its patients, as 
well as the surrounding community. 
Today, I am proud to honor Delicate 
Periodontics and Implant Dentistry of 
Wellington, FL, as the Senate Small 
Business of the Week. 
Founded in 2017 by owner Dr. J’Nelle 
Delica, Delicate Periodontics and Im-
plant Dentistry is a friendly, wel-
coming dental practice that provides 
quality dental care with a specializa-
tion in laser periodontics. A first-gen-
eration Jamaican-American and native 
Floridian, Dr. Delica dreamed of open-
ing a dental practice since she was 13. 
Years later, Dr. Delica has achieved 
her dream and has dedicated her career 
to treating patients and educating in-
dividuals on dental health. In addition 
to 
services 
such 
as 
exams 
and 
cleanings, Delicate Periodontics pro-
vides surgical and laser periodontal 
therapy, soft tissue and bone grafts, 
dental implants, and sinus lifts. With 
the help of her staff, Dr. Delica ensures 
that each patient receives personalized 
attention. When faced with large and 
complicated cases, Dr. Delica ensures 
that the process remains collaborative 
so patients feel at ease. 
Delicate Periodontics is also involved 
in giving back to the community 
through events like health fairs where 
Dr. Delica provides dental screenings 
for Palm Beach County residents. The 
dental practice has also been a dedi-
cated sponsor for events in the Wel-
lington community such as the Meet 
Me at the Race Sunset Stride Family 
5K. Additionally, Dr. Delica has dedi-
cated much of her time to educating 
local middle and high school students 
about careers in dentistry as part of an 
annual health symposium. 
Dr. Delica’s passion for educating 
others on dental hygiene has extended 
far beyond the walls of Delicate Peri-
odontics. As a student, Dr. Delica 
partnered with the Jamaican Ministry 
of Health to educate families on dental 
health in early childhood. After earn-
ing her degree in dentistry, Dr. Delica 
maintained her relationship with Ja-
maica and currently serves as an ad-
junct faculty member at the University 
of West Indies Dental School. In recent 
years, Dr. Delica has brought her den-
tal expertise to Saint Ann, Jamaica, 
where she and other health profes-
sionals volunteer their dentistry skills 
for patients in need. 
Dr. Delica and her team’s dedication 
to quality dental services and commu-
nity service, both in the United States 
and abroad, makes Delicate Periodon-
tics and Implant Dentistry an integral 
member of the South Florida economy. 
Congratulations to the entire team at 
Delicate 
Periodontics 
and 
Implant 
Dentistry. I look forward to watching 
your continued growth and success.∑

UNITED STATES-MEXICO-CANADA 
TRADE AGREEMENT 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, 31⁄2 
years or so ago, I live in Cleveland, and 
I was in my State watching the Presi-
dential campaign. I heard Candidate 
Trump repeatedly talking about re-
negotiating NAFTA or getting rid of 
the North America Free Trade Agree-
ment. While I did not support his can-
didacy and have generally disagreed 
with most of what he has said and 
done, it was a bit of music to my ears 
to hear Candidate Trump talk about 
renegotiating or getting rid of NAFTA. 
I have voted, in my time in the Sen-
ate and before this, every single trade 
agreement starting with the North 
America Free Trade Agreement of two- 
plus decades ago, I have voted no in 
these trade agreements. I never voted 
for a trade agreement because, frankly, 
every trade agreement coming in front 
of the House or Senate has been a cor-
porate trade agreement. It has been 
written by corporate lobbyists to serve 
corporate executives to serve their big-
gest stockholders. That is what these 
trade agreements are about. In every 
case, it was an attack on the middle 
class. In every case, it undermined 
worker protections. It depressed wages. 
It meant loss of jobs. 
I know what these corporate trade 
agreements did to my hometown of 
Mansfield. I know what it did in Mans-
field, OH. I know what they have done 
to my adoptive city of Cleveland, OH, 
and I know what they have done to the 
entire industrial Midwest—well beyond 
that, too, in places like Arizona and 
elsewhere. I have seen what these cor-
porate trade deals do. 
So Candidate Trump is elected Presi-
dent. He then says he is going to do 
away, back out, or renegotiate NAFTA. 
I looked at that with optimism. I 
talked to the U.S. Trade Representa-
tive, Ambassador Lighthizer, a number 
of times. I spoke with the President 
about it. I offered my assistance, and 
then, lo and behold, about a year ago, 
the President came out with a renego-
tiated NAFTA. It was the same old, 
same old. It was another corporate 
trade agreement that served his cor-
porate interests, that served the drug 
companies, and that served those com-
panies that are looking for cheap labor 
across the Rio Grande River. 
Under the President’s new NAFTA— 
he called it USMCA—United States- 
Mexico-Canada 
Trade 
Agreement— 
under the President’s new NAFTA, it 
was the same corporate template, the 
same corporate trade agreement that 
helps corporate investors, that under-
mines workers, that gives incentives to 
companies to shut down production in 
Zanesville, in Gallipolis, in Marietta, 
in Cleveland, in Lima, in Toledo, and in 
Bryan and move their jobs to Mexico. 
So what did we do? Instead, initially, 
I continued to talk to the U.S. Trade 
Representative, as did some of my col-
leagues, knowing this first NAFTA 
draft was unacceptable and was not 
nearly what the President said he 
would do for workers. In fact, it was 
more than that. It was another be-
trayal of workers. This same President 
has betrayed low-income workers by 
refusing to raise the minimum wage. It 
has been more than a decade. This 
same President took away the new 
overtime rule, costing at least 50,000 
Ohioans—that is just 50,000 in my 
State, thousands in Arizona, probably 
100,000 in California, tens of thousands 
around 
the 
country 
and 
different 
States—cost them their overtime pay, 
meaning they would work 50 hours a 
week, and they would only get paid for 
40. We saw that this President again 
was betraying workers. 
It has taken us months and months 
and 
months 
of 
fighting 
alongside 
Speaker PELOSI and Senator WYDEN— 
the senior Democrat of the Finance 
Committee—and unions and organized 
labor to secure the Brown-Wyden pro-
visions that now, with USMCA, amount 
to the strongest labor enforcement in a 
U.S. trade agreement ever. 
It means that wages will go up in 
Mexico, which is good news for Amer-
ican workers because fewer jobs will 
move to Mexico. A worker in Mexico 
now will be able to report a company 
that violates her labor rights or worker 
rights. Within months, we can deter-
mine whether worker rights have been 
violated and can take action against 
that company. 
Now, for the first time in my whole 
career, I will vote for a trade agree-
ment. I wouldn’t have voted for the 
Trump trade. I didn’t vote for NAFTA, 
the 
Central 
American 
Free 
Trade 
Agreement, PNTR with China and 
South Korea, and all these other trade 
agreements. I would not have voted 
against the Trump USMCA because it 
didn’t look out for workers. 
Instead of putting workers at the 
center of trade agreements, which is 
what we should do, it was a trade 
agreement written by and for corporate 
interests. What Senator WYDEN and I 
did and others is we are now about to 
pass a trade agreement that puts work-
ers in the center of the trade agree-
ment, meaning a stronger middle class 
and meaning workers will get a fair 
shake. It means that Ohio workers will 
be able to compete. 
We know why companies took advan-
tage of these corporate trade agree-
ments. They shut down production in 
Ohio and moved to Mexico so they can 
pay lower wages and they can take ad-
vantage of workers who don’t have 
rights. American workers can’t com-
pete with that when it is a race to the 
bottom on wages. Brown-Wyden will 
work to stop that, and for the first 
time ever, as I said, it will put workers 
in the center of a trade agreement. 
We must be straight with American 
workers. This isn’t a perfect trade 
agreement. One trade deal the Demo-
crats fixed—even though the President 
resisted it, finally gave in—a trade deal 
that Democrats fixed will not undo the 
rest of Trump’s economic policies that 
puts corporations over workers and ap-
points judges who put their thumbs on 
the scales of justice to support corpora-
tions over workers and to support Wall 
Street over consumers. I voted yes. I 
voted yes today in the Finance Com-
mittee. It is the first time I ever have 
on a trade deal because, by including 
Brown-Wyden, Democrats have made 
this agreement much more pro-worker, 
and, equally as important, we set an 
important 
precedent 
that 
Brown- 
Wyden must be included in every fu-
ture trade agreement that comes in 
front of this body. 
I yield the floor.

COMMENDING 
NAVY 
QUARTER-
BACK MALCOLM PERRY ON HIS 
PERFORMANCE 
IN 
THE 
120TH 
ARMY-NAVY GAME 
HON. MARK E. GREEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 7, 2020 
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to commend Malcolm Perry of 
Clarksville, Tennessee for his extraordinary 
performance as the quarterback for the Naval 
Academy in the 120th Army-Navy game. 
From the time he was a student at Kenwood 
High School, Malcolm knew he wanted to play 
college football and join the military. As the 
star quarterback at the Naval Academy, he 
has the rare opportunity to do both. The son 
of two career Army enlistees with over forty 
combined years of service, Malcolm enrolled 
at the U.S. Naval Academy, and he will com-
mission as a second lieutenant in the Marine 
Corps after graduation. 
As the senior quarterback and team captain 
for the Midshipmen, Malcolm capped off the 
regular season with a spectacular 31–7 win 
against Army, rushing for a career-high 304 
yards—the most rushing yards by any player 
in the history of the Army-Navy game. 
With his outstanding performance in this 
game, he set the school records for rushing 
yards (1,804) and yards of total offense 
(2,831) in a season—quite a feat considering 
the many great teams that the Naval Academy 
has fielded in its long and proud history of ath-
letic excellence. 
I ask my colleagues in the United States 
House of Representatives to join me in con-
gratulating this young man on his outstanding 
leadership and accomplishments at the Naval 
Academy, and we wish Malcolm great success 
in the years to come.

CONGRATULATING AMERICA’S 
NEWEST CITIZENS 
HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 7, 2020 
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great pleasure and sincerity that I take this 
time to congratulate thirty individuals who will 
take their oaths of citizenship on January 10, 
2020. This memorable occasion will be held at 
the United States Courthouse and Federal 
Building in Hammond, Indiana. 
America is a country founded by immi-
grants. From its beginning, settlers have come 
from countries around the world to the United 
States in search of better lives for their fami-
lies. Oath ceremonies are a shining example 
of what is so great about the United States of 
America—that people from all over the world 
can come together and unite as members of 
a free, democratic nation. These individuals 
realize that nowhere else in the world offers a 
better opportunity for success than here in 
America. 
On January 10, 2020, the following people, 
representing many nations throughout the 
world, will take their oaths of citizenship in 
Hammond, Indiana: Melissa June Licupa 
Pineda, 
Alexis 
Almaraz 
Fierro, 
Katelyn 
Alyousif, Rosaura Virginia Gonzalez, Blanca 
Carrasco, Maria Guadalupe Murillo, Jac-
queline Angelica Terry Palacios, Jovanny Las 
Pinas Minton, Samuel Obiora Izuora, Alicia 
Cerda, Brenda Cerda, Ignacio Cerda Avalos, 
Horacio Joseph Vazquez, Kelly-Sue Stone, My 
Thi Hoa Pham, Maria Elisa Tirado, Arturo Mi-
randa, Jr., Komo Yawa Ouattara, Victoria 
Izuora, Olena Gorbatenko Therrien, Yulia 
Vladimir 
Vorobiev, 
Alexander 
Nicholas 
Vorobiev, Oscar Esteban Magallanes, Liz 
Chacon, Gerardo Miranda, Edsys Nohemy 
Yoder, Nga Thu Pham, Myra Espinosa 
O’Lena, Gertrude N. Manda, and Carl Peter 
Zmijewski. 
Although each individual has sought to be-
come a citizen of the United States for his or 
her own reasons, be it for education, occupa-
tion, or to offer their loved ones better lives, 
each is inspired by the fact that the United 
States of America is, as Abraham Lincoln de-
scribed it, a country ‘‘. . . of the people, by the 
people, and for the people.’’ They realize that 
the United States is truly a free nation. By 
seeking American citizenship, they have made 
the decision that they want to live in a place 
where, as guaranteed by the First Amendment 
of the Constitution, they can practice religion 
as they choose, speak their minds without fear 
of punishment, and assemble in peaceful pro-
test should they choose to do so. 
Madam Speaker, I respectfully ask you and 
my other distinguished colleagues to join me 
in congratulating these individuals who will be-
come citizens of the United States of America 
on January 10, 2020. They, too, will be Amer-
ican citizens, guaranteed the inalienable rights 
to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. 
We, as a free and democratic nation, con-
gratulate them and welcome them.

IN RECOGNITION OF SOC (SEAL) 
EDWARD GALLAGHER, USN 
HON. DUNCAN HUNTER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 7, 2020 
Mr. HUNTER. Madam Speaker, since the 
inception of our great Nation, our freedoms 
were conceived and protected by those willing 
to defend it with their own blood. It is in the 
spirit of those warriors that I rise today, to cel-
ebrate 20 years of distinguished and faithful 
military service by one of the greatest warriors 
our Country has ever known, Special Oper-
ations Chief Petty Officer (SEAL) Edward Gal-
lagher, USN. 
In 1999, Gallagher enlisted into the United 
States Navy from Fort Wayne, Indiana, grad-
uating from Basic Training at Navy Recruit 
Training Command Great Lakes, Illinois. After 
successfully completing Navy Hospital Corps-
man ‘‘A’’ school in 2000, he was assigned to 
1st Battalion, 8th Marines Company, 2nd Ma-
rine Division in Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. 
He also graduated from the Marines Corps 
Scout Sniper Course in 2002. While assigned 
to the Marine Corps, Gallagher completed two 
deployments that included service in Africa, 
Albania, Iraq and Kosovo. 
Always desiring to push himself beyond the 
normal limits of others, Gallagher joined Basic 
Underwater Demolition/SEAL (BUD/S) class 
252 in 2005 for 24 weeks of arduous training. 
After BUD/S, he immediately attended SEAL 
Qualification Training and Special Operations 
Combat Medic Course. Upon completion of 
those courses, Gallagher earned his Navy 
SEAL Trident and was selected to be sta-
tioned at SEAL Team ONE. Later, he was 
hand chosen to train new SEAL candidates as 
a BUD/S Instructor at Naval Special Warfare 
Center. This was followed by orders to be sta-
tioned at SEAL Team SEVEN, where he was 
promoted to the rank of Chief Petty Officer. 
For his service in the Naval Special Warfare 
community he has received two Bronze Stars 
with ‘‘V’’ for Valor, a Navy and Marine Corps 
Commendation Medal, three Navy and Marine 
Corps Achievement Medals with ‘‘V’’ for Valor, 
a Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary 
Medal and a Combat Action Ribbon. 
In 2017, Chief Gallagher returned home 
after completing his eighth combat deploy-
ment. Instead of receiving a hero’s welcome, 
he became the target of a tyrannical witch- 
hunt. This witch-hunt was led by a few junior 
SEALs, a completely incompetent NCIS Agent 
and Navy Judge Advocate General (JAG) law-
yers that were hoping to make their careers 
off court-martialing Gallagher. Despite the nu-
merous illegal and underhanded tactics by the 
prosecution, Chief Gallagher was found not 
guilty of all major charges by a jury of his 
peers on July 1, 2019. Later, President Donald 
Trump personally intervened to stop the 
Navy’s harassment towards Gallagher and re-
stored his rank to Chief Petty Officer. Real-
izing the poor treatment and errors that they 
had made, the United States Navy allowed 
Chief Gallagher to officially retire on Novem-
ber 30, 2019. 
While no one could blame Chief Gallagher 
if he was angry about the horrible manner in 
which he was treated at the end of his career, 
he instead has decided to live free of anger 
and has forgiven the individuals who have 
wronged him. I believe this is due to Eddie’s 
faith in God and an amazing woman that 
keeps him grounded, his loving wife, Andrea. 
She and their three beautiful children, Treven, 
Ava and Ryan, have faithfully supported Eddie 
throughout his numerous deployments and 
were his biggest advocates during the Navy’s 
foolish witch-hunt. Their love along with his 
brother, Sean Gallagher, and his parents, 
Lieutenant Colonel (Retired) Joseph and Me-
lissa Gallagher have strengthened Eddie 
throughout his military service; and I congratu-
late them as well on this special occasion. I

IN HONOR OF JAMES PURTEE, 
CITY MANAGER 
HON. JULIA BROWNLEY 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 7, 2020 
Ms. BROWNLEY of California. Madam 
Speaker, after 31 years of public service, 
Palmdale City Manager James ‘‘Jim’’ Purtee 
announced his retirement effective at the end 
of 2019. Jim began his diverse career in pub-
lic service with the City of Simi Valley in 1988. 
He spent over 27 years working for several 
city departments in Simi Valley and was in-
volved in improving access to affordable 
house, ensuring continued economic develop-
ment, and contributing to city planning efforts. 
In addition, Jim spent his free time doing com-
munity services. 
In July 2012, Jim was named as the City of 
Simi Valley’s Assistant City Manager, where 
he was responsible for intergovernmental rela-
tions and served as the City’s public informa-
tion officer. While serving as the Assistant City 
Manager, Jim obtained S&P rating upgrade of 
AAA for the City of Simi Valley. He sponsored 
a $5 million citywide investment in replacing 
technology services and turned a $2.4 million 
budget deficit to a $2.4 million budget surplus 
in just three years. Jim took the lead on work-
ing with city departments to complete a biogas 
fueling project for the City’s transit buses and 
implement a $15 million energy savings and 
production project. During his time in public 
service, Jim managed a $160 million invest-
ment portfolio and increased investment re-
turns by 400 percent over the benchmark and 
earned an additional $9.7 million on City funds 
over a six-year period. Jim was instrumental in 
securing $780,000 in grant funding to invest in 
citywide 
energy 
efficiency 
programs 
and 
oversaw countless affordable house programs 
to benefit thousands of families. 
In October 2015, Jim became the City Man-
ager for the City of Palmdale. While serving as 
City Manager in Palmdale, Jim amassed a 
number of significant achievements and suc-
cesses. As City Manager for the City of 
Palmdale, Jim obtained an S&P rating up-
grade to AA- and engaged in community part-
nerships, which contributed to reducing the 
City of Palmdale’s Part 1 crime rate by over 
40 percent in just 5 years. Under Jim’s leader-
ship, the City of Palmdale was named as the 
44th Safest City in the US, was ranked in the 
top 15 percent of fiscally responsible cities in 
California and as a top 25 city in the U.S. to 
Live the American Dream. 
Jim implemented initiatives to assist thou-
sands of families in obtaining safe, decent, 
and affordable housing. He carried out fiscal 
and legislative actions that provided over $100 
million in positive fiscal impacts to commu-
nities and worked on cutting edge sustain-
ability projects such as waste to energy, 
groundwater recharge, and acquisition/conver-
sion of 18,000 Streetlights to LED. 
During his career, Jim served on multiple 
boards governing water, transportation, medi-
cine, and regional planning. He served on the 
League of California Cities Fiscal Trans-
parency, Revenue and Tax, and City Manager 
Committees. Jim supported the success of Air 
Force Plant 42 through maintaining strong re-
lationships with all stakeholders. Jim worked 
tirelessly to ensure Palmdale, California will be 
California’s High Speed Rail connection to the 
Western U.S. and partnered with academic 
stakeholders to educate and train the next 
generation of aerospace employees. 
Jim obtained over $300 million in grants, tax 
credits, and other financial resources to invest 
in transportation, housing, water, energy, and 
quality of life improvements for the City of 
Palmdale. He oversaw the development of 
strategic plans for increasing access to public 
arts, 
encouraging 
economic 
development 
throughout the city, and restoring air service to 
Palmdale. While serving as City Manager, Jim 
invested in local parks, building the City of 
Palmdale’s first dog park, developing new City 
parks, and improving existing parks. 
Jim was honored by the International City/ 
County Management Association (ICMA), the 
premier local government leadership and man-
agement organization, at its annual con-
ference in Baltimore earlier this year for his 
significant contributions and achievements in 
the advancement of local government adminis-
tration for 30 years. 
An avid supporter of military veterans, Jim 
has volunteered countless hours with local 
veteran organizations. He is also an advocate 
for supporting mental health programs, espe-
cially with our local youth population, and has 
also served on the Board of Directors for 
Palmdale Regional Medical Center. Jim holds 
both a bachelor’s and master’s degrees from 
California State University, Northridge, and is 
a graduate of the Harvard Kennedy School 
Executive Education for senior executives in 
state and local government program. 
Jim has been happily married for the past 
33 years to Tina, whom he has known since 
high school, and they are the proud parents of 
four children: Erika, Elyssa, Ariana, and Ethan.

REGARDING THE TRUMP ADMINIS-
TRATION’S TARGETED KILLING 
OF 
MAJOR 
GENERAL 
QASEM 
SOLEIMANI, HEAD OF THE IS-
LAMIC REVOLUTIONARY GUARD 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 7, 2020 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as a 
senior member of the House Committees on 
the Judiciary and on Homeland Security, I rise 
to address the Trump Administration’s tar-
geted killing of Qasem Soleimani, head of the 
Islamic Revolutionary Guard, and the impact 
of this decision on American national security 
interests and the safety of American armed 
forces personnel and civilians in the region 
and around the world. 
The decision to kill Major General Qasem 
Soleimani, the head of Iran’s Islamic Revolu-
tionary Guard Corps, may have rid the world 
of a major architect of terror but leaves unan-
swered the critically important question of why 
the action was taken at this time. 
In addition, we do know whether the action 
taken was the product of a carefully developed 
geopolitical strategy developed after extensive 
discussion within the national security appa-
ratus of the short and longterm consequences 
for the security of the region and our nation 
and its people. 
Similarly, we do not know whether it was 
taken in consultation and agreement with our 
regional and international allies; and whether 
there is now in place a strategy to ensure that 
the action taken does not lead to a greater es-
calation of tensions between Iran and the 
United States or in the worst case, another 
war in the Middle East placing at risk the lives 
and safety of millions of persons. 
Qasem Soleimani appears to be the appar-
ent mastermind behind last week’s attack on 
the U.S. embassy in Baghdad. 
Soleimani as long-time chief of the Quds 
Force, the elite special forces battalion of the 
Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), 
assisted Syrian strongman Bashar al Assad 
slaughter hundreds of thousands of his own 
people in the Syrian civil war. 
Soleimani also incited the Houthis in Yem-
en’s civil war and oversaw the brutal killing of 
hundreds of Iraqi protesters recently dem-
onstrating against Iranian influence in their 
country. 
Iran’s Quds Force, under Soleimani’s lead-
ership, has long been suspected by the U.S. 
Government of involvement in a 2011 plot to 
assassinate the Saudi ambassador to the 
United States. 
According to the U.S. Department of State, 
Soleimani was responsible for the 608 Ameri-
cans killed by Iranian proxies since the 2003 
inception of the war in Iraq. 
But Qasem Soleimani was more than a mili-
tary leader, he was a highranking political 
leader, second only in power and influence to 
the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. 
In fact, Soleimani was regarded as a future 
president of Iran. 
It was foreseeable that the killing of 
Soleimani by American forces was likely to in-
vite retaliation by Iran putting at risk American 
military and civilian personnel, as well as its 
allies in the region and across the globe. 
That is why it was essential that the Admin-
istration have in place a sound and well-con-
sidered and meticulously developed strategy 
for managing disputes with Iran. 
That does not appear to be the case. 
There is no evidence that the Administration 
consulted with Congress or the Gang of 8, no 
evidence that it enlisted or even consulted our 
allies in NATO or the region, no evidence that 
the Administration has a working and well- 
functioning national security council apparatus. 
This is a critical Pottery Barn failure in deal-
ing with the Middle East for as former Sec-
retary of State Colin Powell stated before the 
Iraq War, ‘‘If you break it, you bought it.’’ 
Iran Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei 
has vowed that a ‘‘harsh retaliation is waiting’’ 
for the United States as a consequence of the 
action taken yesterday by the Administration. 
It is imperative that the Administration have 
in place a strategy to counter and deescalate 
any Iranian response and have in place meas-
ures to protect the safety of Americans resid-
ing or travelling abroad and to protect the se-
curity of the homeland. 
We must be prepared and ready because 
the assassination of Qasem Soleimani has the 
potential to be the most consequential assas-
sination of a political leader since the assas-
sination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand Carl

E5 
January 7, 2020 
Ludwig Joseph Maria of Austria, the heir pre-
sumptive of the throne of Austria-Hungary in 
1914, which set in motion the Great War. 
The decision to send American men and 
women into harm’s way is the most con-
sequential decision the Constitution vests in 
the President and the Congress. 
That is why the Administration must consult 
with and seek and secure from Congress au-
thorization to use military force (AUMF) 
against Iran. 
Any vote on an AUMF for engagement with 
Iran must be preceded by meaningful, sub-
stantive, and thoughtful dialogue and robust 
debate. 
Members of Congress must be apprised of 
all facts material to the decision and have ac-
cess to relevant documentation, classified and 
otherwise, and afforded the opportunity to 
meet in small groups and in secure locations 
with senior members of the Administration’s 
national security team who can answer de-
tailed and pointed questions and provide re-
quested information. 
The Constitution wisely divides the responsi-
bility of deciding when to use military force to 
protect the nation and its interests between 
the President and the Congress, the rep-
resentatives of the American people. 
The war in Iraq taught this nation the impor-
tance of having accurate and reliable informa-
tion when deciding whether to use military 
force and the painful costs in lives and treas-
ure of acting precipitously. 
We cannot and dare not repeat that mis-
take. 
That is why it is essential that all Members 
of Congress have access to the relevant infor-
mation and the responsible Administration offi-
cials before any vote to authorize the use of 
military force be scheduled.

IN HONOR OF OXFORD WINNING

Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
I rise to recognize the Oxford High School

REMEMBERING LISA POWERS 
COOPER 
HON. STEVE COHEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 7, 2020 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to pay a heartfelt tribute to Lisa Powers Coo-
per, wife of my good friend and former Ten-
nessee State Senator Jerry Cooper, who died 
last Friday at her home in McMinnville. As 
chief of the Consumer Services Division of the 
Tennessee Public Utilities Commission since 
2009, Lisa Cooper showed her dedication to 
public service. As a law student over seven 
years, she showed her perseverance, grad-
uating from the Nashville School of Law in 
2009 while working full time. But as the in-
separable wife of Jerry, she showed the kind 
of love and support that inspired all of us who 
knew them. Their marriage was bigger than 
the sum of its parts and showed that two real-
ly can become one. As a valued friend, Lisa 
was always supportive of me when I served in 
the state Senate and since I have been in 
Congress. She often offered wise counsel 
over the phone, but also sent her love and 
prayers. A graduate of Trevecca Nazarene 
University, Lisa worked in government rela-
tions before going into state government, all 
while raising a family and doting on her grand-
children. I want to express my deep condo-
lences to Jerry; Lisa’s parents, Larry Powers, 
Sr. and Linda Pritchett; her daughter Holly and 
her husband Ward Bushart of Nashville; step-
daughters and their spouses Elisa and Barry 
Luna, Sally and Mike Pack and Faith and 
Chase McGee; her grandchildren; her ex-
tended family and her many, many dear 
friends and colleagues. She lived a good, vir-
tuous and remarkable life and will be missed.

RECOGNIZING CHYANNE THOMAS 
AS CONSTITUENT OF THE MONTH 
HON. MIKE LEVIN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 7, 2020 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam Speaker, 
this Holiday season, I am proud to recognize 
Chyanne Thomas, a postal worker from Vista, 
as my Constituent of the Month. Chyanne is a 
hero for two children, their families, and our 
entire community. 
Chyanne’s vigilance while on her regular de-
livery route resulted in the identification of two 
children who had been reported missing. Her 
quick and caring response allowed these two 
local children to be safely reunited with their 
concerned families. 
When Chyanne spotted Abby, a 15-year-old 
with autism, she sprang into action. She used 
the skills she had learned in a previous job 
working with children with disabilities to keep 
Abby calm and safe until police arrived. Two 
weeks later, Chyanne saw a missing 4-year- 
old girl alone during her route and didn’t hesi-
tate to approach her and make sure she was 
okay until police and her parents arrived. With-
out Chyanne’s awareness, compassion, and 
quick action, these two kids might still be 
missing. 
I launched a Constituent of the Month to 
recognize individuals in the 49th District who 
have gone above and beyond to help their 
neighbors and support our community. I know 
the families of those two missing children 
would agree that Chyanne is well-deserving of 
this recognition. I am proud to recognize her 
as my Constituent of the Month. 
INTRODUCTION OF THE ENSURING 
CHILD HEALTH COVERAGE COM-
PENSATION IN DIVORCE ACT OF 
2019 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 7, 2020 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the Ensuring Child Health Coverage 
Compensation in Divorce Act of 2019. This bill 
would require that when a court directs a non- 
custodial parent (including a stepparent) to 
provide health insurance to a child, the other 
parent can get reimbursed directly from the in-
surer for any out-of-pocket medical expenses 
for the child incurred by such parent, regard-
less of the source of insurance. 
Typically in a divorce, one parent is court- 
ordered to provide health insurance for the 
child to prevent the child from going unin-
sured. However, the other parent may pay for 
out-of-pocket medical expenses for the child 
that are reimbursable by the insurer. Under 
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act 
of 1974, group health insurers are required to 
directly reimburse a parent who pays for reim-
bursable 
out-of-pocket 
medical 
expenses 
when the other parent has been court-ordered 
to provide health insurance for the child. How-
ever, other health insurers are not required to 
directly reimburse the other parent. 
This bill would provide the same require-
ments for all health insurers to ensure that the 
parent who pays for the out-of-pocket medical 
expenses is reimbursed. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to support this 
bill.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF MAS-

SERGEANT 
DOUGLAS 
WONACOTT 
HON. MARK E. GREEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 7, 2020 
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor the service of Master 
Sergeant Douglas Wonacott of the U.S. 
Army’s 160th Special Operations Aviation 
Regiment (Airborne). 
MSG Wonacott enlisted in the United States 
Army in 2000 and he has served with great 
honor and distinction in the 160th Special Op-
erations Aviation Regiment (Airborne) through-
out his entire career. As a special operations 
flight medic with the famed Night Stalkers, 
MSG Wonacott provided life-saving medical 
treatment for scores of U.S. soldiers who were 
wounded in combat operations. Time and 
again he demonstrated peerless courage 
under enemy fire as he sought to provide 
emergency care for the wounded—even when 
a helicopter he was providing medical care on 
was shot down by enemy fire in Iraq. 
MSG Wonacott served with distinction and 
valor in the War on Terror, with over a dozen 
deployments to Iraq in a decade of conflict, as 
well two deployments to Afghanistan in Oper-
ation Enduring Freedom. In the course of his 
deployments, MSG Wonacott took part in Op-
eration Red Dawn, a crucial mission which 
culminated in the capture of Iraqi dictator Sad-
dam Hussein.

January 7, 2020 
In 2013, MSG Wonacott was named the 
Regiment Operation Assessment Element 
flight medic, and in 2016 he was selected as 
the Regiment Senior Medic. As the senior 
medic of the 160th SOAR, he supervised the 
regiment’s special operations flight medics, 
medical officers, and physicians’ assistants, 
and he has consistently gone above and be-
yond to ensure that the soldiers of the unit 
have access to the physical and mental care 
that they need. His merit and courage bring 
great credit to the United States Army, and I 
am honored to have served alongside him. 
Among his many awards and citations, MSG 
Wonacott has received two Distinguished Fly-
ing Crosses, a Bronze Star Medal, a Purple 
Heart, a Meritorious Service Medal, and two 
Air Medals. On behalf of the United States 
Congress, I commend MSG Wonacott for his 
faithful and patriotic service to our nation, and 
I congratulate him on the occasion of his well- 
earned retirement from active duty.

Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-

Gerry Eckenrode upon his induction into the 
Adams County Chapter of the Pennsylvania

Throughout his coaching career at Delone 
Catholic in McSherrystown, Coach Eckenrode 
has established a strong record of excellence.

has won 466 games, including leading the 
Squirettes to three straight PIAA Class 2A 
state championships from 2003 to 2005 and a 
Class 3A state championship in 2019. 
Coach Eckenrode not only stands out for his 
winning record, but also his dedicated service 
and leadership as he teaches his team what 
it takes to succeed both on and off the court. 
It is my pleasure to congratulate fellow Bishop

HUMAN TRAFFICKING AWARENESS 
MONTH 
HON. LOIS FRANKEL 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 7, 2020 
Ms. FRANKEL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to bring attention to Human Trafficking 
Awareness Month, which serves as an oppor-
tunity to reaffirm our country’s commitment to 
preventing trafficking and supporting victims. I 
would also like to express my sincere grati-
tude to the Human Trafficking Coalition of the 
Palm Beaches for their tireless efforts to edu-
cate community members, build trust, and re-
store hope for survivors. 
Over 40 million people worldwide are im-
pacted by human trafficking. Unfortunately, my 
home state of Florida ranks third in the nation 
for reported cases. While many victims face 
challenges finding appropriate services, early 
intervention empowers victims and provides a 
pathway 
to 
recovery. 
Human 
Trafficking 
Awareness Month is a time to ensure that vic-
tims of this horrific crime are offered acces-
sible and appropriate services in the aftermath 
of being trafficked. 
I would like to thank all the advocates, vic-
tim service providers, and criminal justice pro-
fessionals committed to improving our re-
sponse to all human trafficking victims and 
helping them find the support, justice, and 
peace they need.

HONORING 
THE 
TOWN 
OF 
BEEKMANTOWN ON THE BICEN-
TENNIAL ANNIVERSARY OF ITS 
FORMATION 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 7, 2020 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today on behalf of the residents of the Town 
of Beekmantown, New York as they celebrate 
the Bicentennial anniversary of the town’s for-
mation. 
The land that would become Beekmantown 
was first settled around 1783 and is located 
five miles north of the City of Plattsburgh, in 
Clinton County. The town was officially formed 
in 1820 and was named after one of the origi-
nal landowners. In 1814, just prior to its forma-
tion, the area was the scene of skirmishes be-
tween American and British forces at the bat-
tle of Culver Hill during the War of 1812. 
Beekmantown’s oldest monument is the Point 
au Roche Lighthouse which was built in 1858 
as commerce through Lake Champlain ex-
panded. Many other historic sites fill this pic-
turesque community, highlighting the rich his-
torical legacy of the North Country. 
To this day, Beekmantown remains a vi-
brant and beautiful community that exemplifies 
the best qualities of the North Country and our 
Nation as a whole. On behalf of New York’s 
21st Congressional District, I want to con-
gratulate the residents of Beekmantown on 
this momentous occasion. It has been an 
honor to represent this community and I know 
that its future looks bright.

sition as Priest In Charge of St. Ann’s Epis-
copal Church in my district, I want to take a 
moment to honor her for her decades of com-
passionate service and tireless work to im-
prove the lives of our Bronx residents. 
Rev. Overall was born in 1947. She re-
ceived a Bachelor of Arts with Honors from 
Harvard University, a J.D. from New York Uni-
versity, and was admitted to the Bar in 1976. 
She practiced law with prominent trial attor-

from her legal career in the mid-eighties to at-
tend Union Theological Seminary and was or-
dained an Episcopal priest in 1991. 
Rev. Overall began serving as the Priest of 
St. Ann’s Episcopal Church in 1993. Built in 
1841, the Parish is the oldest continuously 
used church in the Bronx and it has a storied 
history. During her tenure as priest, Mother 
Martha has expanded upon that legacy. The 
church holds weekly services in English and 
Spanish, and members of the church help 
serve meals to homeless seniors and families 
in the surrounding community. The food pantry 
program operates twice a week and feeds 
over 6,000 people a month. The church also 
has an after-school program to enhance skills 
for children and provide them healthy meals 
and nutritional education. Reverend Overall 
also provided job opportunities to young adults 
interested in teaching through the Children’s 
Defense Fund Freedom School at St. Ann’s 
Episcopal Church. Many of these programs, 
and Reverend Overall’s work, have been fea-
tured in books and in the press. 
Through all of this, Mother Martha has been 
a passionate advocate for our community, 
from children to seniors. She has worked 
every day to improve our borough, and the 
lives of those who live here. Her compassion 
and dedication have positively affected the 
lives of thousands of people. 
The Bronx is a better place because of the 
work Rev. Overall has done over the years. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join 
me in honoring The Reverend Dr. Martha R. 
Overall for her extraordinary work and her 
lasting legacy.

INTRODUCTION 
OF 
THE 
DORIS 
MILLER MEDAL OF HONOR ACT 
OF 2020 
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 7, 2020 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to introduce a bill titled the Doris 
Miller Medal of Honor Act of 2020. This bill 
would waive the statute of limitations to up-
grade Doris Miller’s Navy Cross to a Medal of 
Honor—an upgrade that is long overdue and 
exceedingly appropriate. 
On December 7, 1941, we experienced one 
of the most calamitous territorial attacks in our 
nation’s history at Pearl Harbor. On this day, 
the dedication and courage of many of our 
service members were tried and proven true— 
one of which whose story I would like to tell. 
Doris Miller was born on October 12, 1919, 
in my hometown of Waco, Texas, to parents 
Henrietta and Conery Miller. He worked on his 
father’s farm until 1938, after which he en-
listed in the Navy to earn money for his family. 
At the time the Navy did not allow sailors of 
color to enlist in combat roles, leaving Miller 
relegated to a service-based role as a mess 
attendant on the USS West Virginia—where 
he was stationed during the attack on Pearl 
Harbor. 
The USS West Virginia’s Action Report ac-
knowledged Miller and his shipmates’ bravery 
for having ‘‘carried out every order promptly 
and enthusiastically, even when it meant dan-
ger to themselves. They did not attempt to 
abandon the bridge until ordered to do so,’’ 
and was described as ‘‘instrumental in hauling 
people along through oil and water to the 
quarterdeck, thereby unquestionably saving 
the lives of a number of people who might oth-
erwise have been lost.’’ For his actions aboard 
the West Virginia, Miller was awarded the 
Navy Cross, cited for ‘‘distinguished devotion 
to duty, extraordinary courage and disregard 
for his own personal safety during the attack 
on the Fleet in Pearl Harbor, Territory of Ha-
waii, by Japanese forces on December 7, 
1941.’’ 
Miller’s actions during the attack on Pearl 
Harbor reflect unquestionably what the Medal 
of Honor represents; to honor those who dis-
tinguish themselves conspicuously by gallantry 
and intrepidity at the risk of their own lives 
above and beyond the call of duty. It is also 
important to note that of the 15 sailors who 
were awarded the Medal of Honor for similar 
actions during the attack, not a single one was 
African American. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to support this 
bill to award Doris Miller the highest honor that 
our nation can bestow upon a service mem-
ber.

OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 7, 2020 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of West Stockholm 
Chief Robert White, Jr. 
On the evening of Thursday, December 5th, 
Chief White saw flames engulfing the home of 
one of his neighbors just a few houses away. 
He responded to the fire and was coordinating 
the response when he suffered a medical 
emergency at the scene and passed away 
that evening. 
Robert White had been a dedicated public 
servant, serving the West Stockholm Fire De-
partment for more than 33 years. In addition to 
being the chief of West Stockholm, he was 
also the Saint Lawrence County fire coordi-
nator and trainer, playing a crucial role region-
ally. Outside of his roles in the fire depart-
ment, Robert ran a local youth sports league 
and was very involved in the community. To 
his wife Trudy, the rest of his family and the 
West Stockholm community, I offer my sin-
cerest condolences during this difficult time.

Tuesday, January 7, 2020 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
I rise to recognize Betty Carr. Betty has been 
an iconic fixture in Anniston for decades and 
an inspiration and advocate for local youth. 
Betty grew up in Anniston in a family that 
placed an importance on their community and 
grew up in church at First United Methodist 
Church. Betty now attends Grace Episcopal 
Church. 
She worked at the University of Alabama, 
ran Camp Grandview in Montgomery and was 
a Soda Jerk at the end of World War II. 
Betty is best known for her work with many 
generations of area youth. She worked as the 
youth and program director at the YMCA from 
1967 to 1985. This month, the Anniston City 
Council unanimously supported that the sec-
tion of West 14th Street in front of the YMCA 
will be named ‘‘Betty Carr Way.’’ 
After the YMCA, Betty also worked at the 
Chamber of Commerce.
