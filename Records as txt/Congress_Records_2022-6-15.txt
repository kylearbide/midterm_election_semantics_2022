BUILDING A BETTER AMERICA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. GARCIA) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize President 
Biden’s and House Democrats’ work in 
reducing the budget deficit, fighting 
inflation, and lowering the cost of 
goods in America. 
Madam Speaker, it is no secret Rus-
sia’s cruel war against Ukraine is driv-
ing up prices not only here in America 
but all over the globe. Putin’s price 
hike has increased gas prices by $2 a 
gallon in many places since Russian 
troops began to threaten Ukraine, and 
families are seeing higher prices in the 
grocery aisles also. 
But 
President 
Biden 
and 
House 
Democrats won’t stand by and watch 
rising costs and inflation continue to 
burden 
our 
hardworking 
families. 
Putin may raise prices temporarily, 
but President Biden and House Demo-
crats are fighting back with key legis-
lation, and we will win. 
This week alone, Democrats acted to 
lower costs and crack down on out-
rageous ocean shipping fees by passing 
the bipartisan Ocean Shipping Reform 
Act. These shipping fees have made 
goods more expensive for American 
small businesses and American con-
sumers. This bill will correct this in-
equity and make sure that American 
consumers are not being overcharged. 
Democrats soon will pass the Lower 
Food and Fuel Costs Act, which aims 
to lower prices for American families 
in the grocery aisle and at the gas 
pump by giving American farmers and 
ranchers the support they need to 
thrive. This bill will take massive 
steps, 
including 
lowering 
fertilizer 
costs in the field to lower prices at the 
grocery store; lowering meat and poul-
try costs by increasing meatpacking 
competition and capacity; and lowering 
prices at the pump by making cheaper, 
cleaner Unleaded 88 more available. 
These are meaningful and practical 
steps we are taking to ensure lower 
prices and to lower inflation. But that 
is not all. 
This week, Democrats have delivered 
for the American people and will con-
tinue to do so. Last March, we passed 
the COMPETES Act. Now it is in con-
ference, and we are negotiating with 
the Senate. The COMPETES Act will 
strengthen our supply chain and lower 
costs big time. 
This bill also will help us make more 
products right here in America. We will 
see ‘‘Made in the USA.’’ 
It also will include my bill, which has 
language to provide critical grants for 
maritime centers that would ensure 
our supply chain is not interrupted by 
work shortages and to ensure a pipe-
line of the future workforce. This will 
lower prices for our districts, like mine 
in Texas-29, and it will also create 
many good-paying local jobs for people 
in my district and all hardworking 
Texans. 
Madam Speaker, I am hopeful that 
our negotiations with the Senate while 
we are in the conference committee 
will soon end and that we can find final 
passage of this very critical bill be-
cause this bill will make sure that 
America competes and that America 
will see products that say ‘‘USA.’’ 
Madam Speaker, one major accom-
plishment less talked about but so im-
portant to all of us today and tomor-
row is President Biden’s historic Fed-
eral deficit cut. In a nutshell, Presi-
dent Biden has delivered the largest 
Federal deficit cut in the past 16 
months than any other President’s 
first 16 months. 
You see, Democrats understand that 
building a better America is not only 
about today, but it is also about our fu-
ture generations. It is about building a 
better America for all of us here today 
but also for generations to come. That 
is why Biden is on track to drop the 
budget deficit by more than $1.6 tril-
lion this year alone. 
In contrast, the Trump administra-
tion and my Republican colleagues 
raised the deficit every year that Mr. 
Trump was in office. 
President Biden and House Demo-
crats will remain committed to low-
ering costs for working families, and I 
promise we will make good on that 
promise. We will continue delivering 
results for today and for generations to 
come.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5550 
June 15, 2022 
EXCESSES OF JANUARY 6 AND 
THE JANUARY 6TH COMMITTEE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, 
on February 27, 1933, the Reichstag, 
Germany’s capitol building, was set on 
fire. Who was responsible remains in 
dispute even today. 
But what is undisputed is that the 
Nazis, barely holding on to power in a 
coalition government, used the attack 
to besmirch their political opponents, 
consolidate their grip on the govern-
ment, arrest hundreds of political op-
ponents, and, ultimately, rescind the 
due process rights and fundamental 
freedoms of the German people. It re-
mains a cautionary tale, for obvious 
reasons. 
The January 6 riot at the Capitol has 
become the centerpiece of the Demo-
crats’ agenda. No other issue facing our 
country, not the worst inflation in 40 
years, not the highest gasoline prices 
in history, not the fastest increase in 
homicides ever recorded, not the his-
torically unprecedented illegal mass 
migration across our southern border, 
none of these crises has commanded 
prime-time 
congressional 
hearings 
from the Democrats. 
What happened here on January 6 
was an affront to our Constitution and 
a national disgrace. Those who entered 
the Capitol with the intent to disrupt 
the counting of electoral votes de-
served to be denounced by their fellow 
citizens and prosecuted to the fullest 
extent of the law. 
More importantly, questions involv-
ing the authority of Congress to refuse 
to count electoral votes, or why ade-
quate security was not present to pro-
tect the Capitol, or whether there were 
conspiracies to break into the Capitol 
are all important to resolve to ensure 
that this never happens again. 
What is unfolding, instead, is a sick 
mockery of the principles of fairness 
and due process that this House is 
founded upon. It promises to discredit 
those proceedings and to dishonor its 
participants. 
Congress has a time-honored process 
to get at the truth. It guarantees the 
right of both sides to appoint their rep-
resentatives, who then question and de-
bate the facts, offer conflicting evi-
dence, and hold an issue to every light. 
For the first time in the history of 
this institution, the Speaker arrogated 
to herself not only the selection of the 
majority members but the minority 
members as well, thus assuring only 
one side, her side, could be heard. 
Without 
having 
both 
sides 
rep-
resented, it becomes impossible to test 
the accuracy of facts, the truth of the 
narratives, and the soundness of opin-
ions. It robs the process of the credi-
bility that is a necessary prerequisite 
to legitimacy. 
Instead of the sober inquiry that 
should have been undertaken a year 
and a half ago, we have a Soviet-style 
show trial, all carefully choreographed 
by an ABC television producer. 
To add hypocrisy to outrage, some of 
the Speaker’s representatives played a 
crucial role in developing and fanning 
the Russia collusion hoax that ground-
lessly challenged the legitimacy of the 
Trump election and Presidency. Some 
were themselves involved in chal-
lenging electoral votes counted after 
the 2016 election. Some were apologists 
for the violent riots that consumed 
this country in 2020. Some have been 
eerily silent as Supreme Court Justices 
have been intimidated in their own 
homes. 
Now, the FBI thoroughly examined 
the riot last year. They found no evi-
dence that President Trump conspired 
with protesters to enter the Capitol, 
nor have the Democrats offered any 
now. They instead repackage and re-
hash the snap impeachment trial in 
which the President was acquitted by 
the Senate. 
Indeed, this committee knows but 
has deceptively suppressed the stun-
ning fact that 4 days before the riot, 
President Trump offered the use of Na-
tional Guard troops to keep the peace. 
The Democrat leadership turned it 
down. 
Do they really expect us to believe 
that the same guy who meticulously 
planned the riot also authorized the 
National Guard to prevent the riot? 
This is insane. 
Insurrection? 
The 
constitutional 
process 
immediately 
resumed 
once 
these yahoos were kicked out of this 
building. Do the Democrats actually 
expect us to believe that some lunatic 
wearing buffalo horns was moments 
away from seizing control of our gov-
ernment? 
The narrative cannot survive in open 
debate, and the Democrats know it. 
That is why they are not permitting 
one. 
Our institutions are strong because 
they are backed by the common sense 
of the American people. Our traditions 
of due process and fairness are too 
deeply ingrained in the American char-
acter to succumb to this madness. 
After Americans have reported their 
verdict in the upcoming election, per-
haps we can forge a bipartisan con-
sensus on the measures necessary to 
assure that the excesses of both Janu-
ary 6 and the January 6th Committee 
never threaten us again. 
f 
SUMMIT OF THE AMERICAS AND 
CARIBBEAN TRADE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
the Virgin Islands (Ms. PLASKETT) for 5 
minutes. 
Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Speaker, I 
have just returned from the Ninth 
Summit of the Americas in Los Ange-
les, which gathered the heads of state 
and senior government officials from 
nearly every country in the Western 
Hemisphere, as well as hundreds of 
businesses, civil society, and youth 
leaders from across the region. 
Members of a 20-person congressional 
delegation met with leaders from many 
of our neighboring countries, Chile, Ja-
maica, Canada, Haiti. 
I had the opportunity to speak with 
the heads of state of many of our Car-
ibbean neighbors. From these conversa-
tions, one thing was clear: Now more 
than ever, it is necessary for the 
United States to deepen its relation-
ship 
with 
Latin 
America, 
Central 
America, and the Caribbean. 
With threats of the COVID–19 pan-
demic, democratic erosion, and climate 
change, my constituents in the Virgin 
Islands know all too well the collective 
challenges facing the hemisphere. 
I thank the Biden administration for 
its commitment to productive engage-
ment with Latin and Central America 
and the Caribbean. In Los Angeles, the 
administration announced the Amer-
icas Partnership for Economic Pros-
perity, which calls for sustainable and 
inclusive 
trade; 
the 
U.S.-Caribbean 
Partnership to Address the Climate 
Crisis 2030; and the Los Angeles Dec-
laration on Migration. 
I strongly urge this administration 
to follow up on these commitments and 
promises with concrete actions that 
will deliver tangible results, particu-
larly in the Caribbean because the Car-
ibbean is facing an economic crisis. 
The pandemic has exacted a harsh toll 
on the region, with regional economic 
activity falling by 9.9 percent in 2020, 
significantly worse than the rest of the 
region. 
Climate change poses a particularly 
dire threat to the lives, livelihood, and 
businesses in the Caribbean. For years, 
the harmful trend of financial de-risk-
ing by banks has economically stran-
gled the Caribbean islands. 
The Caribbean, which is our third 
border, is essential to U.S. national 
and economic security. From the early 
days of the American Revolution to the 
Cold War, the Caribbean has played a 
vital role in U.S. defense. It, alone, is 
the United States’ sixth largest trade 
partner, with $35.3 billion of trade in 
2018. And 13 million people in the U.S. 
share Caribbean ancestry. 
Despite these common interests be-
tween the U.S. and the Caribbean, 
China is making significant inroads in 
this area. Indeed, total Chinese trade 
with Latin America and the Caribbean 
rose from $18 billion in 2002 to $449 bil-
lion in 2021, and China is now South 
America’s largest trade partner. 
Therefore, improving the U.S.-Carib-
bean relationship and strengthening 
the U.S.-Caribbean trade and economic 
partnership must be a priority for the 
administration and this Congress. 
First, we must follow up on our com-
mitments made at the summit with 
tangible results and concrete invest-
ments that correspond to the Carib-
bean’s needs and for our national secu-
rity.

Second, this Chamber must pass H. 
Res. 1047, which will reaffirm the eco-
nomic partnership between the United

States and the Caribbean nations, rec-
ognizing the need to strengthen trade 
and investments. 
Third, we must authorize a general 
capital increase for the Inter-American 
Development Bank to ensure that the 
premier lending institutions for South 
America and the Caribbean have the 
resources to support the region in this 
difficult time. 
I have introduced H.R. 7726 to do so, 
and the Senate has already approved 
such a capital increase in the United 
States Innovation and Competition 
Act. It is essential that this capital in-
crease be included in the final version 
of the House COMPETES Act. 
Fourth, 
the 
administration 
must 
work to counter the misguided trend of 
de-risking from U.S. banks, which has 
unfairly cut Caribbean nations off from 
access to capital and credit and eco-
nomically harmed the region. 
Madam Speaker, the Caribbean is in-
extricably linked to the security, eco-
nomic prosperity, and cultural heritage 
of the United States. It is time for us 
to 
recognize 
this 
importance 
and 
prioritize U.S.-Caribbean relationships.

HONORING THE LIFE OF JOHN 
WALTER REVELL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
SCHRIER). The Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. 
NORMAN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. NORMAN. Madam Speaker, as a 
Member of the 117th Congress, I rise 
today to celebrate the life of John Wal-
ter Revell. John is the son of Jeanie 
Tanner Revell and Dr. Walter J. Revell, 
Jr., and the brother of Letty and Marie 
Revell. 
John was born on March 8th, 1980, 
and tragically died on June 19th, 1993, 
as a result of being hit by a car as he 
was riding his bicycle on his way to his 
family farm. The driver of the car was 
a person under the influence of drugs, 
which are ravaging our Nation today. 
John was 13 years old at the time of 
his death. However, his life epitomizes 
the words, ‘‘While he was alive, he 
lived.’’ 
The fond memories our family has of 
John include his Rollerblading around 
the neighborhood, the family ski trips, 
the sleepovers he had with our children 
and friends at our house, the words 
others would have this 13-year-old boy 
tell me during the children work week, 
‘‘Ralph, we want to take today off to 
swim at Shiland Pool and play,’’ the 
sight of him standing in our back door 
when dinner was being served with that 
smile, indicating I am hungry. 
He was an athlete. He was a Boy 
Scout. He was an honor student. He 
was a musician. He was a child who 
loved to laugh and brought a ray of 
sunshine to everyone he encountered. 
June 19, 2022, will mark the 29th year 
of John’s passing. On March 8 of this 
year, he would have been 42 years of 
age. 
The biblical passage that gives com-
fort to all those left behind who knew 
and loved John Revell can be found in 
Romans 8:38–39, ‘‘For I am persuaded, 
that neither death, nor life, nor angels, 
nor principalities, nor powers, nor 
things present, nor things to come, nor 
height, nor depth, nor any other crea-
ture, shall be able to separate us from 
the love of God, which is in Christ 
Jesus our Lord.’’ 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF DR. 
PRESTON PHILLIPS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Washington (Ms. JAYAPAL) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor Dr. Preston Phil-
lips. 
Dr. Phillips was a gracious and lov-
ing husband, father, and brother who 
dedicated his life to his family, his 
community, and to saving lives. 
Earlier this month, Dr. Phillips was 
murdered during a tragic mass shoot-
ing at a hospital in Tulsa, Oklahoma, 
by a shooter who purchased an AR–15 2 
hours before the shooting and a hand-
gun less than 2 days before the shoot-
ing. 
Nothing we say can bring back a de-
voted father who did so much to save 
the lives of others as a doctor. Nothing 
will ease the pain of his wife and his 
three children who have to bury him 
far too soon. My heart goes out to all 
the families of the four people killed 
and the community in Tulsa that still 
grieves. 
This tragedy has also struck close to 
home for me. Dr. Phillips was the fa-
ther of Elise Phillips, a valued member 
of my staff here in D.C., a member of 
our House of Representatives family 
who has spent the last year tirelessly 
serving the people of Washington’s Sev-
enth Congressional District as my leg-
islative counsel. I, and our whole of-
fice, grieve with Elise and her family. 
This past weekend, I was honored to 
attend Dr. Phillips’ funeral service in 
Tulsa at the invitation of the family. It 
was immediately clear to me what an 
exceptional community Dr. Phillips 
and his strong and courageous wife, 
Melody, have built around themselves 
over their life together. Everyone I met 
described Dr. Phillips as a man of ex-
traordinary warmth, brilliance, and 
compassion. 
Dr. Phillips came from humble begin-
nings, and his life is a testament to 
what can be achieved with determina-
tion. He got his first job at the age of 
8 shining shoes and gathering shopping 
carts. He used this money to pay for 
veterinary bills for his family’s dog, 
Blackie. 
In high school, he discovered his love 
for medicine and focused on his studies 
with great dedication. Dr. Phillips was 
then granted admission to Emory Uni-
versity where he graduated with bach-
elor’s degrees in religion and chemistry 
and a master’s degree in organic chem-
istry. 
He continued his education at Har-
vard Medical School and then com-
pleted his residency at Yale University 
School of Medicine. Dr. Phillips began 
his formal medical career in my home 
district of Seattle in 1997, and he prac-
ticed there for 8 years before moving to 
Tulsa, Oklahoma. 
As the Representative for Seattle’s 
Seventh Congressional District, I want 
to convey how proud we are of Dr. Phil-
lips and his significant contributions 
to our community. 
During his career, Dr. Phillips em-
phasized giving back to community. At 
Yale, he founded the Yale Minority 
Medical Association, which focused on 
recruitment, mentorship, and retention 
of minority students in the medical 
field. 
His generosity was boundless, and he 
touched 
countless 
lives 
here 
and 
abroad. A prime example were his an-
nual trips to Togo in Africa to perform 
pro bono surgeries for underserved 
communities and where a clinic oper-
ating room still bears his name. 
For many of his patients, Dr. Phillips 
was not just a medical professional. He 
was family. Throughout his decades of 
orthopedic practice, his patients be-
came informal grandparents, aunts, un-
cles, and lifelong friends for him and 
his three children, whose childhoods 
were defined by these relationships. I 
am so honored to have met so many of 
these people at the funeral service. 
Even more so, his son and two daugh-
ters were defined by living in a house-
hold where love, warmth, and patience 
were the norm from Dr. Phillips and 
his wife, Melody. 
I, and all those I represent, have ben-
efited from their love and warmth both 
during his time practicing medicine in 
Seattle 
and 
through 
his 
brilliant 
daughter, Elise. 
I am incredibly grateful to have Elise 
as part of my D.C. staff, and I see in 
her the same virtues that made her fa-
ther such a respected and loved man in 
his community. 
Those at Dr. Phillips’ service asked 
me to ensure that Congress passes sen-
sible gun reforms to honor Dr. Phillips 
and to do all we can to ensure that 
tragedies like this never happen again. 
Last week, the House of Representa-
tives passed the Protecting our Kids 
Act, a lifesaving package of gun safety 
legislation to raise the age of purchase 
for assault rifles to 21, control the sale 
of ghost guns, limit the number of 
rounds in a magazine, and require the 
safe storage of firearms. 
Legislation won’t bring Dr. Phillips 
back or the thousands of gun violence 
victims back, but I hope that it brings 
a degree of comfort to Dr. Phillips’ 
family and to all the families of the 
ones we lost that we, in Congress, will 
not stop until we bring an end to the 
gun violence crisis that has plagued 
our country for far too long. 
Rest in power. Rest in peace, Dr. 
Preston J. Phillips.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5552 
June 15, 2022 
California (Mr. LAMALFA) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, so 
what have we had so far under the 
Biden plan? Well, what we have heard 
about lately is that for Republicans 
trying to be more fiscally responsible, 
we hear that he is complaining that we 
are worried about deficits and spend-
ing. 
He says we are affecting lives. Boy, 
are we affecting lives with the policy 
coming out of Washington, D.C. Infla-
tion. Energy crisis. But that is part of 
the incredible transition, we are told, 
that is being forced upon us to put us 
out of our vehicles or not being able to 
use gas appliances, if they have their 
way. 
On the Republican side, crisis acting 
is the new term. We are crisis acting. 
Well, I guess if we want to talk about 
crisis acting, let me remind everybody 
that carbon dioxide is only 0.04 percent 
of our atmosphere, right. You would 
think it is 40 or 50 percent by the way 
the hype is on that, and everybody has 
to change their lives in this incredible 
transition as we get forced into electric 
cars and have our appliances taken 
away, and who knows what else, as 
part of the Green New Deal that is 
being forced upon us, indeed, by execu-
tive action because it is not passing 
Congress. 
So when you are looking at the 
American people out there, they think 
of you in Washington, D.C. as the great 
reset. You are the spring in the great 
reset button. You are not being lis-
tened to. Your pain is not being felt by 
Washington, D.C. 
Inflation? Oh, not a big deal. It was 
8.6 percent this month, right. Wages— 
though some of them have gone up for 
some people or are being forced up by 
legislation—are being outstripped by 
inflation. Wages up a little bit, infla-
tion up a lot more. 
Why? Trillions and trillions of spend-
ing and policies that take energy op-
tions away from Americans being pro-
ductive. Oh. Well, let’s get it from Rus-
sia—until we finally banned that. Let’s 
get more from Saudi Arabia. 
Why don’t we get it here? Why don’t 
we do more here instead of cutting off 
leases, cutting off permits for known 
reserves we have in this country? No, 
no. We are going to have the incredible 
transition forced upon us by these poli-
cies. 
It doesn’t matter what it costs. It 
doesn’t matter what it is taking off the 
table. So live with it. Inflation and 
wages. Let them eat cake, as Senators 
drive past in an electric car, laughing 
at what the costs are at the gas sta-
tions. 
Well, not everybody can turn around 
and go buy an electric car at $50,000 or 
$70,000, or even any new car right now 
with the way they are living paycheck 
to paycheck, and it is going to be more 
and more so. 
So what is the Federal Government’s 
answer? Well, we are doing something 
about inflation and the deficit. Yeah. 
Instead of borrowing trillions and tril-
lions, I guess by not borrowing the tril-
lions, it makes the deficit go lower. 
So let’s put things back on track, 
have our energy policy be one that ac-
tually produces in the United States of 
America by our American workers pro-
ducing more things in the USA. 
Food, for example. In my home State 
of California, as the water gets cut off 
more and more so they can flush water 
out to the ocean, hundreds of thou-
sands of acres of food crops are being 
left out, not grown. 
It isn’t all because of a drought. We 
still get lots of rainfall. We had an in-
credible amount of rainfall and snow in 
December. Of course, the planters de-
cided well, we are going to go ahead 
and let all the water run out through 
the delta in northern California instead 
of being able to cut back some of it and 
keep it in storage, although our lakes 
were at record lows last year. No, no, 
no. We will keep doing the environ-
mental thing on that, saving non-
existent fish. 
In the meantime, the price for food 
keeps going up. In America, we see 
empty store shelves in the land of plen-
ty. It is an incredibly dumb policy that 
has been put in place, piled on by en-
ergy that is almost unaffordable. 
Ask any trucker when the price of 
diesel has gone basically from 3 bucks 
a gallon to 6 or 7, even, in my home 
State, what does that mean? 
That means all the input costs of 
bringing fertilizer and seed to a field to 
grow your food and bringing the fin-
ished product from the harvest to the 
mill and from the mill to the store 
shelf, it all has to be passed along. 
There is no free lunch. 
So we haven’t even seen the full ef-
fects of this yet because in 2022, some 
of the people had these inputs carried 
into the crop year. It hasn’t been fully 
felt yet. 
Wait until 2023 when the price of a 
bale of hay, that you need in order to 
feed cattle or what have you, kicks 
into place. Wait until that all happens 
because then, chicken might triple in 
price from today, beef, or maybe even 
just a loaf of bread. 
So what are we supposed to think 
about that? Oh, Americans can afford 
that. We can just cut back on other 
disposable income or disposable items, 
you know, maybe less frivolous spend-
ing. 
Well, is your government telling you 
what you can spend on? Basically, they 
are dictating that by these policies, 
yes. 
When your energy goes up, when your 
water gets taken away, you will feel it 
all the way through, all the way 
through your whole economy, and your 
wages will be outstripped by inflation.

THE LCS IS A LEMON 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. SPEIER) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, every-
one knows what a lemon car is, but we 
have a fleet of lemon ships. They are 
called littoral combat ship, except it is 
a misnomer because it is not survivable 
in combat. 
Today, we are calling them the leak-
ing, cracked ships, and let me tell you 
why. If the LCS was a car sold in 
America today, they would be deemed 
lemons, and the automakers would be 
sued into oblivion. But in the Federal 
Government it is big business as 
usual—$50 billion over the lifetime of 
the program. That is a lot of rotten 
lemons. 
My concerns and warnings about the 
LCS go back a decade, along with the 
late Senator John McCain. It is costing 
taxpayers billions of dollars, yet has 
failed to produce a reliable ship. So I 
was stunned and outraged to see that 
the proposed 2023 defense appropria-
tions bill only decommissions four 
LCS, when it should be nine, as Presi-
dent Biden and the Navy have pro-
posed. The annual cost of five LCS 
ships could pay for eight childcare cen-
ters in the military, four barracks, or a 
$1,000 bonus for every enlisted E–3 and 
below. 
The LCS program’s legendary fail-
ures have made it the subject of two 
Government Accountability Office re-
ports. Those reports found each LCS 
costing an astounding $59 million a 
year to operate. Or actually, not to op-
erate because they are, more often 
than not, in dock because they aren’t 
working. That is three-quarters of the 
cost of operating a destroyer, which 
has three times the crew and a much 
greater capability, such as antisub-
marine warfare. 
LCS 
is 
notoriously 
unreliable, 
plagued by breakdowns that have seen 
some ships spend more time in the re-
pair yard than in deployment. On this 
chart, you will see the USS Little Rock, 
commissioned in 2017, lost power at sea 
in 2022. In March 2018, it was stranded 
in ice for 3 months on its maiden voy-
age. 
Or how about the USS Milwaukee? 
Commissioned in November 2015. In De-
cember 2015, it broke down due to soft-
ware malfunctions and was towed 40 
miles. 
Or how about the USS Freedom? Com-
missioned in 2008; in 2011, had a 6-inch 
crack in the hull; in 2013, immobilized 
during trial run; in February 2016, cou-
pling cracked; in August of 2016, engine 
replacement needed. 
What do we have going here? The 
GAO found that the LCS experienced 
engine failure in 10 of the 11 deploy-
ments reviewed. The aluminum hull of 
the Independence-class punctures eas-
ily. I mean, this is not funny. This is 
real money. And the combining gear 
for all Freedom-class ships must be re-
placed. 
One major reason for the excessive 
cost of LCS? Contractors. Unlike other 
ships where sailors do the mainte-
nance, LCS relies almost exclusively 
on contractors who own and control

the technical data needed to maintain 
and repair. 
So what is this ship’s mission and 
what does it contribute to national se-
curity? Nothing. 
The Navy says it plans to use the 
LCS for partner engagement, as a re-
placement for obsolete minesweepers 
for long-range fire capability, and for 
counterdrug activities. But the LCS 
are not well-suited for minesweeping 
due to their lack of endurance, and 
their already years-late mine counter-
measure 
package 
isn’t 
even 
oper-
ational. 
Our top priority in national defense 
strategy is China and Russia. We can’t 
waste scarce funds on costly LCS when 
there are more capable platforms like 
destroyers, attack submarines, and the 
new Constellation-class frigate. Most 
importantly, the cost of sustaining 
LCS isn’t just felt in lost dollars, but 
lost lives. 
The Navy has a severe undermanning 
problem. Our surface fleet is 15 percent 
undermanned compared to required 
levels for safe operation. The average 
sailor is overworked and gets 6 hours 
or less of sleep per night. A recent GAO 
report on pierside maintenance found 
undermanning was so bad on some 
ships that half of the electrician slots 
were empty. On others, the crew mem-
bers had to work 80 to 100 hours per 
week to prepare to deploy. 
On 
these 
ships, 
the 
operational 
tempo is so high, several sailors have 
left due to behavioral health needs. At 
least one has died from suicide. This is 
unacceptable, especially in the wake of 
the deadly McCain and Fitzgerald colli-
sions that killed 17 sailors 5 years ago. 
The key contributors? Undermanning 
and fatigue. 
We can and must prevent this. Let’s 
decommission all nine ships.

GOD BLESS FIRST RESPONDERS 
AND MENTAL HEALTH PROFES-
SIONALS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. TONY GONZALES) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. TONY GONZALES of Texas. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to recog-
nize the first responders in Uvalde. It 
has been 22 days since the terrible inci-
dent in Uvalde occurred, and many of 
the discussions have been about the 
victims. I will talk about some of the 
survivors. Some of those survivors are 
first responders. 
In particular, one gentleman, Javier 
Martinez, is a lieutenant for the Uvalde 
Police Department. He was one of the 
first people on the scene. He engaged 
with the shooter. He was actually 
wounded. He goes in there and he 
clears the room. 
But afterwards he wasn’t done. There 
are a lot of copycat threats, and Javier 
Martinez, even though he was going 
through all that, went down to the 
high school, and he secured the high 
school. The next day, he was on duty. 
He put his uniform on, and he went to 
work the next day and the next day. 
There are many stories just like this. 
When the fire happened, everyone ran 
to the incident, and they didn’t stop. 
Some of the law enforcement officers, 
Border Patrol agents, after they got 
done clearing that room, they went to 
other elementary schools. There are 
seven elementary schools in Uvalde. 
This happened days on. 
I mention that because while the 
community of Uvalde, while my dis-
trict is healing, there are all these he-
roes that are walking among us. 
Another person I will mention is 
Ann. Ann is the director of the ER 
there in Uvalde. She helped save lives. 
There are so many people that have 
just helped. After the cameras are 
gone, after everyone stops listening or 
even remembering what happened in 
Uvalde, we will be there as one commu-
nity coming together. 
Over a year ago, my community 
asked me for a mental health hospital. 
Last year, we secured $2 million for 
that. When I hosted the President a 
couple weeks ago, we asked for $23 mil-
lion on that. Mental health is at the 
core of all of this. There is a mental 
health crisis not only in Uvalde, but I 
would argue across the country. We 
have to make sure that we are devoting 
the resources necessary to protect our 
children, to protect ourselves. 
My whole community of Uvalde, I 
would argue, needs mental health as-
sistance right now. A lot of us are get-
ting that. My own staff, essentially, we 
turned into a FEMA office, and we 
were dealing with all these crises. 
Someone 
reminded 
me 
yesterday 
that I essentially have relived this cri-
sis 22 days now. A lot of us are in that 
exact same boat. I mention that to say, 
we have to get rid of this stigma be-
hind mental health. We have to realize 
all of us, from a young age to an old 
age, go through things in life, and we 
need mental health professionals in 
order to get through that. 
Today, I thank all the first respond-
ers in Uvalde for everything they are 
doing, the men and women, just like 
Javier Martinez, who put their uniform 
on, go to work. There are heroes walk-
ing among us that sometimes get for-
gotten. They are not forgotten today 
nor every other day. God bless them.

RECOGNIZING OAK HILL CHARTER 
SCHOOL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
congratulate the staff, volunteers, and 
board members of Oak Hill Charter 
School in Caldwell County, North Caro-
lina. 
The school was unanimously ap-
proved by the North Carolina Charter 
Schools Advisory Board, and its doors 
will officially open this August. 
This accomplishment is amplified by 
the fact that Oak Hill is one of only 
two accelerated schools to earn this op-
portunity this year. Let me tell you, 
Madam Speaker, this is no small feat. 
Recently, I received a heartfelt email 
from Kelly McIntyre, the board chair 
of the school. She marveled at how God 
has guided the journey of everyone in-
volved at Oak Hill and how along the 
way the right people and resources 
came together in perfect harmony. 
Kelly, 
I 
agree 
with 
you 
whole-
heartedly. God’s hand has been in your 
work every step of the way. 
Right now, nearly every single class 
at Oak Hill has a waiting list. Families 
are beyond enthusiastic at this oppor-
tunity for their children. 
The outpouring of support from the 
surrounding community must also be 
recognized. 
Donations 
of 
furniture, 
school supplies, and other essential 
items continue to stream in on a week-
ly basis, and volunteers continue with-
out delay to see projects through. 
Madam Speaker, there is a quote 
from American anthropologist Mar-
garet Mead that encapsulates the story 
of Oak Hill perfectly: ‘‘Never doubt 
that a small group of thoughtful, com-
mitted citizens can change the world; 
indeed, it’s the only thing that ever 
has.’’ 
It is clear that these committed citi-
zens are also working in the will of 
God. In Kelly’s email to me, she re-
marked that, ‘‘It’s the most amazing 
thing to see this mission that started 
as just a thought, a spark, grow into a 
force that I believe will be life-chang-
ing for many.’’ 
Madam Speaker, that sentiment is 
profound, and it is a direct reflection of 
the opportunity that charter schools 
provide across the country. 
Parents, teachers, and communities 
recognize the value of charter schools 
because they challenge a failing status 
quo. Charter schools are guaranteed 
operational autonomy to provide rich 
alternatives to students and families. 
Most importantly, they provide edu-
cational freedom and choice, two fun-
damental 
principles 
that 
are 
des-
perately needed in education right 
now. 
Instead of being held accountable to 
the education bureaucracy, charter 
schools are accountable to students, 
families, and their communities, as 
they should be, Madam Speaker. 
Congratulations again to everyone at 
Oak Hill Charter School. The work you 
will undertake and the opportunities 
you will provide to our next generation 
of leaders in the coming months and 
years will be nothing short of spectac-
ular. 
May God continue to bless you in 
your mission of serving the Caldwell 
County community.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5554 
June 15, 2022 
in 2023, I rise today to deliver the elev-
enth installment of my farm bill im-
pact series, where I am highlighting 
various aspects of the farm bill that de-
serve Congress’ awareness and support. 
We need robust biosecurity in America 
not only because we need to eat in 
order to survive, but also because 
strong American agriculture will help 
keep our country free and self-deter-
mining as a Nation. 
Manhattan, Kansas, the home of my 
alma mater, Kansas State University, 
is also home of the National Bio and 
Agro-Defense Facility or NBAF. This 
state-of-the-art 700,000-square foot fa-
cility will be a national asset that 
helps protect our Nation’s agriculture 
against the threat and potential im-
pact of serious animal diseases. Ex-
perts believe that 75 percent of new and 
emerging infectious animal diseases 
can be transmitted from animals to hu-
mans. NBAF will be home to the only 
maximum biocontainment space in the 
country, where USDA will conduct 
comprehensive research, develop vac-
cines and antivirals, and explore en-
hanced diagnostic and training capa-
bilities. 
The United States Department of Ag-
riculture is currently working with the 
Department of Homeland Security to 
bring NBAF online by December and to 
begin 
establishing 
partnerships 
be-
tween two key sectors heavily invested 
in animal health: academia and indus-
try. Working with scientists and other 
industry professionals, NBAF will cre-
ate new safety and security guidelines 
that will be critical for the prevention 
of future pandemics. Currently, sci-
entists are conducting this very impor-
tant research in New York at the Plum 
Island Animal Disease Center, which is 
more than 60 years old. NBAF will re-
place this aging facility, create 400 
local jobs for Kansans, generate over 
$100 million in total economic benefit 
for our State, and make Kansas the 
home of internationally recognized 
animal disease experts. NBAF isn’t just 
an exciting development for Kansas, it 
also marks the future of biodefense re-
search that will protect the United 
States and the rest of the world. 
b 1045 
The 2018 farm bill contained special 
authorization for biosecurity planning 
and 
response, 
which 
helped 
make 
NBAF possible. That version of the 
farm bill explicitly mentioned the co-
ordination of ‘‘tactical science activi-
ties . . . that protect the integrity, re-
liability, sustainability, and profit-
ability of the food and agricultural sys-
tem of the United States against bio-
security threats from pests, diseases, 
contaminants, and disasters.’’ NBAF is 
a concrete example of the impact that 
we can have when we authorize the 
farm bill in careful and creative ways. 
During National Agriculture Month 
in March, I brought House Agriculture 
Committee 
Republican 
leader 
GT 
Thompson on an ag tour of Kansas, 
where I was proud to show him NBAF. 
The 
technology, 
scale, 
and 
inter-
national significance of the facility are 
truly second to none. Once fully oper-
ational in December, NBAF won’t just 
support and protect agriculture; it will 
protect our country and the world. 
I will be back on the floor soon to de-
liver another installment of my farm 
bill impact series and highlight more 
programs and titles within the bill that 
I believe Congress must understand and 
support to ensure that agriculture 
thrives in America. 
IMPORTANCE OF LIVESTOCK INDEMNITY 
Mr. MANN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to follow up on a speech that I 
gave in March about the importance of 
the farm bill emergency assistance pro-
grams like livestock indemnity. 
Agriculture is a risky business, and 
Mother Nature is a tough business 
partner. Over the past couple of weeks, 
Kansas producers have been losing cat-
tle due to extreme temperatures, and 
qualified producers will be able to re-
coup some of their losses through the 
livestock indemnity program. 
Just like the flooding and wildfires 
we saw in Natoma and the surrounding 
areas last year, this is another example 
of how essential the farm bill emer-
gency assistance programs are to our 
country’s food supply and the people 
who produce it. 
Emergency programs like livestock 
indemnity are investments in the fu-
ture of our country, and they help en-
sure that America remains food secure 
and self-determining as a Nation. 
Natural 
disasters, 
diseases, 
and 
weather emergencies happen, and we 
can’t afford to let them cripple the 
business of the men and women who 
keep us fed, fueled, and clothed. That is 
why emergency assistance programs 
like livestock indemnity must remain 
strong in the 2023 farm bill.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Sovereign God, we pray to You again 
on behalf of the Ukrainian people. 
They continue to call to You, O Lord, 
in their distress. They call to You, our 
God. Hear their voices. 
Relieve them of the hardship of their 
oppression. 
Free them from the abuse of their 
captors. 
Loose them from the chains of their 
enemy and give them the freedom of 
their own sovereignty and the blessing 
of peace in their homeland. 
Then gracious God, allow us, we who 
are observers to this travesty, to be in-
spired by the faith of the Ukrainians in 
the face of their adversity. Open our 
eyes to the spiritual warfare being 
waged which has called forth their 
unshakable faith in You. They are liv-
ing proof of the victory they have al-
ready won in You. 
For they are hard-pressed on every 
side, but not crushed. They are per-
plexed, but not in despair; persecuted, 
but not abandoned; struck down, but 
not destroyed. 
Almighty God, may we receive their 
testimony of Your saving grace. Then 
may we be found as steadfast in the liv-
ing of our days. 
In Your merciful name we pray. 
Amen.

URGING SENATE PASSAGE OF THE 
HONORING OUR PACT ACT 
(Mr. RUIZ asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to call on the Senate to immediately 
pass the Honoring our PACT Act. 
In 2017, I met a veteran from Cathe-
dral City, Jennifer Kepner, who devel-
oped pancreatic cancer due to her expo-
sure to burn pits during her service in 
Iraq. 
Despite being a young and otherwise 
healthy mother of two with no family 
history of cancer, she and her family 
faced roadblocks to getting the care 
that she needed from the VA. 
At her kitchen table, she asked me to 
lead this fight, and I promised her I 
would. Now, 5 years later, we are closer 
than ever before to fulfilling Jennifer’s 
vision for her fellow veterans. 
With my provision included to get 
veterans the presumptive benefits they 
have earned and deserve, the Honoring 
our PACT Act will ensure that no other 
veteran will have to fight like Jennifer 
did for the care they need. 
I urge the Senate to fulfill our Na-
tion’s promise to our veterans, honor 
Jennifer’s memory, and pass the Hon-
oring our PACT Act without delay. 
f 
WORLD UNIFICATION AGAINST 
PUTIN 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, yet again, the world is unit-
ing against war criminal Putin and his 
murderous invasion of Ukraine. 
The European Union is set to sign an 
agreement with Israel and Egypt which 
will free itself from Putin energy reli-
ance. EU leaders say they will reduce 
Russian oil and gas imports, cutting fi-
nancial resources to the Putin war ma-
chine where young Russians are sac-
rificed by Putin for personal gain of 
oil, money and power, while conducting 
mass murder in Ukraine. 
In the plan, Israel will export natural 
gas in a pipeline to Egypt where it will 
be turned into liquified natural gas, 
then delivered to EU member states. I 
appreciate the service of Egyptian Am-
bassador to the U.S. Motaz Zahran. 
During a trip to Israel this week, Eu-
ropean Commission President Ursula 
von der Leyen said, The Kremlin’s be-
havior only strengthens our resolve to 
break free of Russian fossil fuels. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops 
who successfully protected America for 
20 years in the global war on terrorism 
as it continues to move from the safe 
haven of Afghanistan to America. 
As the co-chair of the EU Caucus and 
the Israel Caucus, I especially appre-
ciate the cooperation we see today.

10TH ANNIVERSARY OF DACA 
(Mr. CORREA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, today I 
rise in honor of the 10th anniversary of 
the Deferred Action for Childhood Ar-
rivals program or DACA. 
Today, Dreamers are doctors, sol-
diers, nurses, frontline workers, police 
officers, and firefighters, and many, 
many DACA recipients have made the 
ultimate sacrifice for this country. 
Here is a picture of one of my con-
stituents, Jose Angel Garibay. Jose 
Angel Garibay was killed in action. He 
was the first marine to make the ulti-
mate sacrifice in Iraq from Orange 
County. 
There are many, many more sol-
diers—DACA 
recipients—that 
have 
made the ultimate sacrifice for their 
new country. It is time to give them 
permanent status in the United States. 
f 
PROTECTING INDEPENDENT 
CONTRACTORS 
(Mr. ALLEN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, with infla-
tion at a 40-year high and a sluggish 
economy, attacking workers’ freedoms 
should be the furthest thing from the 
President’s mind. 
President 
Biden’s 
Department 
of 
Labor is in the process of changing the 
definition of an employee to include 
independent contractors. This would be 
devastating for the 19 million Ameri-
cans who currently enjoy the flexi-
bility that comes with building wealth 
by 
participating 
in 
the 
American 
Dream. 
Under this change, workers classified 
as independent contractors would be 
subject to the same employment-re-
lated restrictions as traditional em-
ployees. This is an assault on the mod-
ern American worker. 
Independent contractors were respon-
sible for over 70 percent of the job 
growth during the last economic ex-
pansion before COVID. If we want to 
spur economic growth, we must remove 
barriers and allow our workforce to 
flourish. 
Fortunately, my legislation, the Em-
ployee Rights Act, would codify protec-
tions 
for 
independent 
contractors, 
shielding 
them 
from 
these 
over-
reaching classifications. 
NATIONAL DAIRY MONTH 
(Mr. VALADAO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Speaker, June is 
National Dairy Month, an opportunity 
to honor the contributions of dairy 
farmers throughout the country. 
I am proud to represent our Nation’s 
largest dairy district and the hard-
working men and women in the Central 
Valley who work tirelessly to provide 
our Nation with milk, cheese, ice 
cream, and all the other dairy products 
we enjoy. 
There are over 30,000 dairy farms 
across the United States, and many of 
those are farmer-owned and operated. 
As a lifelong dairy farmer, I know first-
hand the impact that these burden-
some government regulations have on 
day-to-day operations of these family 
farms and businesses. 
We need to reduce the regulatory 
burdens on our domestic agriculture 
producers and incentivize more produc-
tion here at home. Supporting Amer-
ican agriculture and our dairy industry 
will bring food costs down and provide 
stability to our global food supply. 
Thank you to our dairy farmers and 
manufacturers in the Central Valley 
and across the country for their con-
tributions to our community. Happy 
Dairy Month.

2022 PHILANTHROPISTS OF THE 
YEAR 
(Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. 
HERRERA 
BEUTLER. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to congratulate Ron and 
Terry Prill for being recognized as the 
2022 Philanthropists of the Year. 
For two decades, Ron and Terry have 
dedicated their lives to worthy causes, 
positively impacting residents across 
southwest Washington. 
After retiring and moving to Camas, 
Ron served on the board of the Boys 
and Girls Club of Southwest Wash-
ington, helping make a difference in 
the lives of countless kids in our com-
munities. 
This venture inspired the Prills to 
continue giving back through other or-
ganizations. Among their numerous 
acts of charity, Ron and Terry have 
been 
highly 
supportive 
of 
several 
healthcare-related nonprofits and were 
critical 
in 
expanding 
PeaceHealth 
Southwest Washington’s operations. 
This includes a remodeled cardiology 
unit with state-of-the-art equipment 
and a cardiac education center, which 
provides care to countless patients and 
their families. 
Ron and Terry, thank you for your 
unwavering support of our commu-
nities, and congratulations again on 
this well-deserved recognition.

minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the Liberty Christian 
Academy Bulldogs on winning the 
VHSL baseball Class 3 State title 
game. 
The academy was founded in 1967, 
and in addition to its academic and 
biblical teachings, the school excels in 
sports. Their baseball State title this 
year marked their second State crown, 
as they won the 4A State title in 2017. 
This game all came down to the sev-
enth inning at the field in Spotsyl-
vania, Virginia. Their opponent, the 
Abingdon Falcons, had taken the lead 
in the top of the seventh when Lane 
Duff of the academy walked three 
straight batters, sending home Cole 
Lambert for the go-ahead run. 
The Falcons scored again on a bases- 
loaded walk to Jack Ferguson that 
scored Daniel Fellhauer and made it 5 
to 3. 
Yet, when the Bulldogs got their 
chance in the bottom of the seventh, 
they started a rally as Logan Duff led 
off with a triple. Then a sac fly by Tan-
ner Thomas scored Duff to cut the 
Abingdon Falcons’ lead to 5 to 4. 
Finally, Lane Duff’s two-run, walk- 
off single marked a three-run Liberty 
Christian Academy rally that propelled 
the Bulldogs to a 6 to 5 win last Satur-
day in the coveted VHSL Class 3 State 
title game. 
Congratulations 
to 
the 
players, 
coaches, and parents on a great season.

HONORING KYLE PATTERSON 
(Mr. MAST asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. MAST. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life of Florida Fish and 
Wildlife Senior Investigator Kyle Pat-
terson. 
Just 5 days ago on June 9, Senior In-
vestigator Patterson was involved in a 
fatal crash while on duty. 
Senior Investigator Patterson faith-
fully served the people of St. Lucie 
County for more than 15 years. From 
his first assignment at the age of 19 to 
time spent with the Agriculture Crimes 
Intelligence Unit and Marine Intel-
ligence Unit, he was dedicated. He was 
a public servant, committed to the 
safety of our homes and our commu-
nity. 
Senior Investigator Patterson was 
passionate about baseball, steer, his 
family, and God. He dedicated his time 
to numerous organizations, including 
the St. Lucie County Farm Bureau and 
Christ Fellowship, the church that we 
share. 
His memory will absolutely live on 
with those who knew him and loved 
him best: his wife, Alisha; his children, 
Kole and Kinsley; and his parents and 
sisters. 
Please honor the life of Special In-
vestigator Patterson and salute him 
because he gave a lifetime of service, 
and service did take his life.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF 
RENEE VAN NETT 
(Mr. STAUBER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate and honor the life of 
Renee Van Nett from Duluth, Min-
nesota, who bravely battled her diag-
nosis of terminal cancer and recently 
passed away. 
Renee was well-known and well-loved 
across the northland. She was a dedi-
cated mother, city council member, 
and active community member. Her 
tragic 
passing 
has 
affected 
many, 
showing 
the 
countless 
lives 
she 
touched and made a difference in. 
Though the loss leaves a hole in the 
lives of many, the work Renee accom-
plished has left a legacy that will live 
on beyond any of us. 
As the first Native American person 
to have been elected to the Duluth City 
Council, Renee will always be remem-
bered as an inspiration to her fellow 
Red Lake Nation members and to the 
entire Native American community. 
I am grateful for Renee sharing her 
compassion, dedication, and love for 
Duluth and all its people. May we all 
continue to help carry on her legacy.

CRISIS AT OUR SOUTHERN 
BORDER 
(Mr. ROSE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, our Nation 
is facing a lot of problems: historic in-
flation, sky-high prices at the pump, 
and a shortage of baby formula. 
But it is important not to lose sight 
of another crisis going on more than 
1500 miles southwest of where we are 
gathered right now: 2.6 million illegal 
immigrants have been apprehended at 
our southern border since President 
Biden took the oath of office. 
There were more than 234,000 migrant 
encounters at the border just in April. 
That is the most for any month in his-
tory. That is also a 1,268 percent in-
crease from April of 2020. 
Border 
Patrol 
seized 
more 
than 
340,000 pounds of drugs since last Octo-
ber, including enough fentanyl to kill 
more than 2 billion people. 
Yet, this administration is still fight-
ing to repeal title 42. It is past time to 
put an end to these open border poli-
cies and put the American people first.

REMEMBERING DR. EUGENE 
TALMADGE MADDOX 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today in memory of Dr. Eu-
gene Talmadge Maddox, a veterinarian 
and a remarkable Georgian. 
Mr. Speaker, 1954 was an eventful 
year for Gene, as he graduated from 
Alexander Baldwin Agricultural Col-
lege and married the love of his life, 
Patsy Copeland. He went on to receive 
his veterinary degree from the Univer-
sity of Georgia in 1959. 
Following 
his 
graduation, 
they 
moved to Thomasville, Georgia, where 
he worked at Clanton Veterinary Hos-
pital. He founded his own animal hos-
pital, Cairo Animal Hospital, in 1963, 
and served Grady and surrounding cit-
ies until he retired in 2004 to serve as a 
Georgia State representative for Grady 
and Decatur counties in 2012. 
In 2006, he was honored by the Geor-
gia Veterinary Medical Association as 
Veterinarian of the Year. In 2015, he re-
ceived the prestigious J.T. Mercer Life-
time Achievement Award. 
An active member of his community, 
Gene was the former president of the 
American Veterinary Medical Associa-
tion, the Georgia Veterinary Medical 
Association, and a member of the Geor-
gia Cattlemen’s Association. He also 
served as chief veterinary medical ex-
aminer under four Governors during 
his career. 
A loving father and husband, an out-
doorsman, a community advocate, and 
a dedicated veterinarian, Gene is sure 
to be missed.

Opportunity Act as three separate forms of in-
formation. 
TITLE III—ACCESS TO HOUSING AND 
LENDING 
Subtitle A—Improving Language Access in 
Mortgage Servicing 
SEC. 311. FINDINGS 
The Congress finds the following: 
(1) Housing is the largest portion of most 
household budgets in the United States and 
therefore a foundational component of financial 
access and opportunity. 
(2) Due in part to a legacy of discrimination 
in the United States, people of color are dis-
proportionately experiencing homelessness, are 
disproportionately renting, and disproportion-
ately paying unaffordable rents, which acts as 
a barrier to homeownership. 
(3) Access to fair and affordable housing, both 
rental and homeownership opportunities, is crit-
ical to upward economic mobiity. This includes 
addressing language barriers in mortgage serv-
icing to ensure borrowers have culturally sen-
sitive, in-language access to critical lending in-
formation, can enter into fair and sustainable 
homeownership, and preserve their home equity. 
SEC. 312. LANGUAGE ACCESS REQUIREMENTS 
AND RESOURCES. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Chapter 2 of title I of the 
Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1631 et seq.) is 
amended by inserting after section 129H the fol-
lowing:

Subtitle D—Ensuring Diversity in Community 
Banking 
SEC. 441. SHORT TITLE. 
This subtitle may be cited as the ‘‘Ensuring 
Diversity in Community Banking Act’’. 
SEC. 442. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON FUNDING THE 
LOAN-LOSS 
RESERVE 
FUND 
FOR 
SMALL DOLLAR LOANS. 
The sense of Congress is the following: 
(1) The Community Development Financial 
Institutions Fund (the ‘‘CDFI Fund’’) is an 
agency of the Department of the Treasury, and 
was established by the Riegle Community Devel-
opment and Regulatory Improvement Act of 
1994. The mission of the CDFI Fund is ‘‘to ex-
pand economic opportunity for underserved peo-
ple and communities by supporting the growth 
and capacity of a national network of commu-
nity development lenders, investors, and finan-
cial service providers’’. A community develop-
ment financial institution (a ‘‘CDFI’’) is a spe-
cialized financial institution serving low-income 
communities and a Community Development En-
tity (a ‘‘CDE’’) is a domestic corporation or 
partnership that is an intermediary vehicle for 
the provision of loans, investments, or financial 
counseling in low-income communities. The 
CDFI Fund certifies CDFIs and CDEs. Becom-
ing a certified CDFI or CDE allows organiza-
tions to participate in various CDFI Fund pro-
grams as follows: 
(A) The Bank Enterprise Award Program, 
which provides FDIC-insured depository institu-
tions awards for a demonstrated increase in 
lending and investments in distressed commu-
nities and CDFIs. 
(B) The CDFI Program, which provides Fi-
nancial and Technical Assistance awards to 
CDFIs to reinvest in the CDFI, and to build the 
capacity of the CDFI, including financing prod-
uct development and loan loss reserves. 
(C) The Native American CDFI Assistance 
Program, which provides CDFIs and sponsoring 
entities Financial and Technical Assistance 
awards to increase lending and grow the num-
ber of CDFIs owned by Native Americans to 
help build capacity of such CDFIs. 
(D) The New Market Tax Credit Program, 
which provides tax credits for making equity in-
vestments in CDEs that stimulate capital invest-
ments in low-income communities. 
(E) The Capital Magnet Fund, which provides 
awards to CDFIs and nonprofit affordable 
housing organizations to finance affordable 
housing solutions and related economic develop-
ment activities. 
(F) The Bond Guarantee Program, a source of 
long-term, patient capital for CDFIs to expand 
lending and investment capacity for community 
and economic development purposes. 
(2) The Department of the Treasury is author-
ized to create multi-year grant programs de-
signed to encourage low-to-moderate income in-
dividuals to establish accounts at federally in-
sured banks, and to improve low-to-moderate in-
come individuals’ access to such accounts on 
reasonable terms. 
(3) Under this authority, grants to partici-
pants in CDFI Fund programs may be used for 
loan-loss reserves and to establish small-dollar 
loan programs by subsidizing related losses. 
These grants also allow for the providing recipi-
ents with the financial counseling and edu-
cation necessary to conduct transactions and 
manage their accounts. These loans provide 
low-cost alternatives to payday loans and other 
nontraditional forms of financing that often im-
pose excessive interest rates and fees on bor-
rowers, and lead millions of Americans to fall 
into debt traps. Small-dollar loans can only be 
made pursuant to terms, conditions, and prac-
tices that are reasonable for the individual con-
sumer obtaining the loan. 
(4) Program participation is restricted to eligi-
ble institutions, which are limited to organiza-
tions listed in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal 
Revenue Code and exempt from tax under 501(a) 
of such Code, federally insured depository insti-
tutions, community development financial insti-
tutions and State, local, or Tribal government 
entities. 
(5) According to the CDFI Fund, some pro-
grams attract as much as $10 in private capital 
for every $1 invested by the CDFI Fund. The 
Administration 
and 
the 
Congress 
should 
prioritize appropriation of funds for the loan 
loss reserve fund and technical assistance pro-
grams administered by the Community Develop-
ment Financial Institution Fund.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there

be here today, but I would like the 
RECORD to reflect not only her author-
ship of this bill but also her unwaver-
ing commitment to achieving equity 
and inclusion on behalf of communities 
of color. 
Today’s House consideration of H.R. 
2543 is historic in that for the first 
time in our Nation’s history, the U.S. 
House of Representatives is voting on a 
comprehensive package of legislation 
to finally address inequity with equity 
and inclusion in terms of financial ac-
cess, economic mobility, and fair treat-
ment. 
Today, I boldly and proudly say that 
this would not have been possible with-
out 
the 
Honorable 
Chairwoman 
WATERS’ leadership. This bill is needed 
because racial disparities in lending, 
homeownership, and wealth creation 
are all too real. 
For some, invidious discrimination, 
Mr. Speaker, is only a phrase. However, 
for too many others, it is a fact of life. 
According to the Brookings Institu-
tion, the racial wealth gap between 
White and Black households is more 
than $10 trillion. The onerous wealth 
gap is perpetuated by the toleration of 
ongoing discrimination, redlining, and 
systemic barriers to accessing finan-
cial credit and services. 
Some of my colleagues across the 
aisle may say that the House shouldn’t 
address this important issue. They may 
say that the House should ignore these 
very real, well-documented disparities 
and focus on getting inflation under 
control, to which I say, this bill deals 
with the very real inflationary pres-
sures that people of color experience in 
their daily lives. Too often, Mr. Speak-
er, consumers and businesses from low- 
income communities and communities 
of color suffer invidious discrimination 
as they struggle to access capital and 
credit. 
Chairwoman WATERS said it best, and 
I was there to hear her say it, when she 
spoke before the Rules Committee this 
week. She noted that this type of dis-
crimination is a form of inflation in 
communities of color. She indicated 
that when you add up inflated fees in 
tandem with inflated interest rates, 
simple loans cost more for people of 
color than others taking out the same 
loan in a different community. 
This, of course, assumes that you are 
lucky enough to qualify for the loan in 
the first place. If you are not, then 
your options to build wealth are se-
verely limited because you can’t buy a 
home or start a small business. In fact, 
your only option for credit might be an 
inflated predatory payday loan that 
leaves you worse off, not better. 
This is inflation that people of color 
experience each day, and we should be 
just as outraged and concerned about 
these needlessly inflated high costs as 
we are about the general inflation we 
are experiencing during the pandemic. 
And I would further argue that ad-
dressing this form of inflation will 
bring down costs for everyone because, 
as my colleagues across the aisle are 
fond of saying, a rising tide lifts all 
boats. 
We also know that general inflation 
disproportionately 
hurts 
people 
of 
color, which is why this bill directs the 
Federal Reserve, as it carries out its 
duties to rein inflation in and promote 
full employment, to also consider ra-
cial disparities so that all people—all 
people—will benefit from the Fed’s 
dual mandate. 
Members of the LGBTQIA-plus com-
munity also face discrimination in 
lending. This is why it leads to higher 
costs for them as well. We shouldn’t 
stand for this during any time of the 
year, but I am pleased to be among 
those fighting for LGBTQIA-plus jus-
tice during Pride Month. This is why 
H.R. 2543 includes my bill H.R. 166, the 
Fair Lending for All Act, which fur-
thers fair lending by clarifying that 
lending discrimination is prohibited 
not only on the basis of race, Mr. 
Speaker, but also on the basis of gen-
der identity, sexual orientation, and 
geography. This bill enhances super-
vision and establishes criminal pen-
alties for fair lending violations. 
Let’s take a closer look at fair lend-
ing at this time. Every person who pur-
chases a home should be able to read 
and understand their mortgage docu-
ments. This is why common sense 
should prevail. However, that is not 
the reality for many home buyers in 
our country today. This is why the bill 
includes robust language, robust lan-
guage to access the requirements for a 
mortgage, and these mortgage condi-
tions should be made clear in lan-
guages that people understand. It re-
quires servicers to expand and preserve 
the dream of homeownership for bor-
rowers 
with 
limited 
English 
pro-
ficiency. Chairwoman WATERS’ bill will 
also support the efforts of community 
development financial institutions, or 
CDFIs, and minority depository insti-
tutions, or MDIs, that fill a historic 
lending gap in underserved commu-
nities across this country. And it would 
mitigate banking deserts by allowing 
credit unions to serve areas that banks 
have ignored or abandoned. 
Moreover, this legislation includes 
another bill of mine, H.R. 2516, the Pro-
moting Diversity and Inclusion in 
Banking Act, which would require Fed-
eral banking regulators to evaluate 
policies and procedures banks and cred-
it unions have to promote diversity 
and inclusion. 
I thank Chairwoman WATERS for her 
continued leadership, her bold leader-
ship, as well as my colleagues and 
members of the Financial Services 
Committee for their tireless work, in-
cluding 
Representatives 
MEEKS, 
CLEAVER, BEATTY, GARCIA
of Texas, 
TORRES, and AUCHINCLOSS. 
Mr. Speaker, the pandemic has exac-
erbated and exposed many truths about 
our Nation’s inequitable housing and 
financial systems, as well as its out-
sized impact on low-income families 
and communities of color. It is incum-
bent on this Congress to finally address 
these disparities, and that is precisely 
what Chairwoman WATERS’ bill will do. 
Hence, I urge my colleagues to vote 
‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 2543, the Financial Serv-
ices Racial Equity, Inclusion, and Eco-
nomic Justice Act. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
b 1230 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to H.R. 2543, and I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
This week, Democrats have a bill on 
the floor to ‘‘address inflation and help 
bring costs down for Americans.’’ 
Just last week, President Biden stat-
ed that inflation is his ‘‘top domestic 
priority.’’ So, let’s talk about inflation 
if we are going to talk about the Fed-
eral Reserve. Let’s look at the num-
bers. Let’s look at the stats. 
The President announced that his 
focus is going to be on the economy 
this month. To kick it off, his Treasury 
Secretary, Secretary Yellen, finally ad-
mitted that she was wrong when she 
called inflation transitory last year. 
To the Biden administration and con-
gressional Democrats, I would like to 
say to you: Welcome to the party. You 
are a year late. The American people 
have been feeling this pain of inflation, 
and I am glad you are coming to the re-
alization that we have to do something 
about it. Republicans welcome the con-
versation. 
Inflation has surged to a 40-year 
high. Stats across the board are ter-
rible. Everyday goods and services are 
more unaffordable today, especially for 
low-and middle-income Americans and 
those on fixed incomes. Skyrocketing 
consumer prices are outpacing wage 
gains. U.S. households will spend an 
extra $5,200 this year compared to last 
year for the same basket of goods and 
services they normally buy. 
The national average for the price of 
gasoline has reached a staggering $5 a 
gallon. If that weren’t bad enough, our 
economy is now shrinking. The U.S. 
GDP came in at a negative 1.4 percent 
in the first quarter of this year. That is 
problematic. That is bad. 
Democrats want to blame everything 
from Putin to so-called corporate prof-
iteering for the inflation crisis. They 
are still looking for who did it. Well, 
guess what, folks. The call is coming 
from within the house. They are the 
ones that put this on the American 
people. 
This is all the result of Democrats’ 
bad economic policies, and this crisis is 
of their own making. The American 
people know it. They see it. They feel 
it. They experience it. 
In a recent poll released by The Wall 
Street Journal, 83 percent of respond-
ents rated current economic conditions 
as poor or not good. This is the result 
of Democrat economic policies. Since 
they control the fullness of the Federal 
Government, they have put their eco-
nomic policies into place, and we are 
living with the bad consequences. All 
across the board, inflation is way up.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5569 
June 15, 2022 
In 
another 
poll 
released 
by 
RealClearPolitics, 60 percent of the 
American people disapprove specifi-
cally of President Biden’s handling of 
the economy. 
What is the Democrats’ strategy? It 
is to distract struggling families with 
this bill that we have on the floor 
today, a bill that might sound good but 
does nothing to bring down consumer 
prices or help struggling families. 
Let’s talk about the contents of the 
bill. Republicans support improving di-
versity in financial services, but H.R. 
2543, this bill, misses the mark. Com-
mittee Democrats had the opportunity 
to work with Republicans on a bipar-
tisan legislative package to achieve 
that goal. In fact, five of the bills that 
make up this package received some 
Republican support, either in markup, 
in committee, or on the floor in pre-
vious Congresses. But instead of work-
ing 
with 
Republicans, 
committee 
Democrats injected this package with 
another eight partisan poison pills. 
First, this bill blatantly politicizes 
the Federal Reserve. In fact, it tasks 
the Fed with a third mandate, and that 
third 
mandate 
is 
to 
close 
socio-
economic disparities instead of focus-
ing on what we have asked the Fed to 
focus on, which is price stability and 
maximum employment possible. So 
much for the President saying he is not 
going to politicize the Fed or he is 
going to respect the Fed’s independ-
ence. This bill goes completely counter 
to that. 
This bill will make credit more ex-
pensive and less accessible to those 
who need it the most. 
This bill will also pile regulatory 
costs on small businesses, forcing them 
to divert resources from business oper-
ations to report on diversity and inclu-
sion metrics outlined in this bill. Cur-
rently, businesses can self-assess the 
makeup of their workforce. This bill 
would impose a one-size-fits-all man-
date on all job creators, regardless of 
size, geographic location, or business 
model. 
This bill is a boon for litigious trial 
lawyers, and it is a boon for them be-
cause it expands ECOA, and it opens 
businesses up to new lawsuits. This 
creates uncertainty in the credit mar-
kets, ultimately increasing the cost of 
credit and making it more difficult to 
assess credit risks for financial institu-
tions and businesses. 
Finally, while Americans are reeling 
from higher prices, this bill will make 
it more expensive for families to pur-
chase a home. This bill will impose ad-
ditional 
costs 
on 
creditors 
and 
servicers, which will inevitably be 
passed on to those applying for loans. 
The bottom line, this is just another 
attempt by House Democrats to divert 
voters’ attention from the big issues of 
the day, and that is their dismal eco-
nomic record that they have foisted 
upon the American people. 
If House Democrats are serious about 
addressing inflation, as the Biden ad-
ministration has claimed and as the 
President has specifically said he is fo-
cused on this month, if they were seri-
ous, they would abandon a partisan 
messaging bill like the one we have on 
the House floor. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘no,’’ and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. MEEKS), my dear friend. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Representative 
GREEN
for 
yielding, 
and, of course, I thank Chairwoman 
Waters for bringing this important 
piece of legislation to the floor. 
I heard Ranking Member MCHENRY 
talk today, and I think that the Amer-
ican people understand that inflation is 
all over the world. It is not a United 
States problem; it is a global problem 
predicated by Putin’s aggression in 
Ukraine and coming out of the greatest 
pandemic that we have had in over 100 
years. Democrats are focused on work-
ing with the globe to make a dif-
ference. 
I want to focus on this bill and talk 
about the Improving Corporate Govern-
ance Through Diversity Act and the 
Ensuring 
Diversity 
in 
Community 
Banking Act portions of this bill. On 
that, 
I 
thank 
Ranking 
Member 
MCHENRY
and other Republicans for 
the bipartisan support both bills re-
ceived when they unanimously passed 
out of the Financial Services Com-
mittee. 
We need to continue all efforts to 
promote racial and economic justice in 
our communities, and this package of 
legislation does exactly that. Investors 
want to know whether the C-suites and 
the boardrooms in corporate America 
are actually working in their interests 
and reflecting their ideals. I, along 
with 
Representatives 
CAROLYN
B. 
MALONEY and RITCHIE TORRES, worked 
to enhance the SEC’s disclosure regime 
by requiring public companies to dis-
close race, ethnicity, gender identity, 
sexual orientation, and veteran status 
of these companies. We want these 
spaces to truly reflect the diversity of 
this Nation. 
Also included in this package is my 
bill that emphasizes the importance of 
minority banks and credit unions in 
serving our communities. The Ensuring 
Diversity in Community Banking sec-
tion will address the issue of banking 
deserts and strengthen programs that 
provide capital to these critical and 
crucial institutions. It also creates an 
impact bank designation in order to 
promote banks that predominantly 
serve low-income communities. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Ken-
tucky (Mr. BARR), my colleague and 
friend and the ranking member of the 
National Security, International De-
velopment, and Monetary Policy Sub-
committee of the Financial Services 
Committee. 
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, for over a 
year, Democrats have dismissed the 
historic inflation crushing American 
households. 
First, they said it was transitory. 
Then, they played it down as a high- 
class problem. Now, President Biden ri-
diculously and falsely refers to rising 
prices as Putin’s price hike. 
But the American people know that 
Democrats’ failed policies created this 
inflation crisis. Their overspending 
created excess demand. Their war 
against domestic energy production 
constrained supply. And this supply-de-
mand mismatch pushed prices to a 
four-decade high. 
In March 2021, the Consumer Price 
Index was at 2.6 percent and gas prices 
were $2.70 per gallon. That month, 
President Biden’s American inflation 
plan was signed into law. What hap-
pened as a result? We have 8.6 percent 
inflation on the CPI from last Friday, 
the highest in over 40 years. On top of 
that, we are seeing historic energy 
prices. Fuel oil is up 106 percent, the 
highest ever, and regular gasoline is up 
over 50 percent year over year. For the 
first time ever, gas prices reached $5 
per gallon nationally last week. 
Instead of addressing the cause of in-
flation, such as Big Government spend-
ing, 
radical 
energy 
policies, 
and 
politicization of access to capital, they 
continue to push partisan packages 
that will do absolutely nothing to cor-
rect historic inflation that is plaguing 
the middle class. Case in point is this 
bill, the Racial Equity, Inclusion, and 
Economic Justice Act. 
At a time of historic inflation, the 
central responsibility, the core job, of 
the Federal Reserve is to ensure price 
stability. But instead of responding to 
Democrats’ fiscal policy errors, the Fed 
failed to tighten monetary policy fast 
enough to address this inflation crisis, 
especially at this time when they 
should be focused on price stability. 
What does the Democrat majority 
do? They want to give the Fed more re-
sponsibilities. They want to give them 
responsibilities beyond their core com-
petency or expertise. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
an additional 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from Kentucky. 
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, instead of 
diverting the Fed’s focus away from 
their responsibility of tackling infla-
tion, the Federal Reserve should be fo-
cused on dealing with inflation. 
If Democrats were truly interested in 
helping 
low- 
and 
moderate-income 
households, fixed-income households, 
and communities of color, who are suf-
fering the most under Biden’s inflation 
crisis, they need to keep the Fed’s eye 
on the ball. Don’t have them weigh 
into social policies and controversial 
policies that are in the responsibility 
and jurisdiction of Congress. The Fed 
needs to be focused on helping tame in-
flation. This bill gives the Fed respon-
sibilities it doesn’t need to have. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5570 
June 15, 2022 
Mr. Speaker, we are witnessing now 
why we have the invidious discrimina-
tion that exists in this country. Not 
one word has been said about the invid-
ious discrimination, the high cost in 
loans that people of color suffer. Not 
one word is being said about it. Rather, 
there is always an effort to deflect. 
This has been going on for centuries, 
but not today. It ends today. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. BEATTY). 
Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, let me 
first thank Chairman GREEN for yield-
ing and for his outstanding job of man-
aging the floor today. 
I also thank Chairwoman MAXINE 
WATERS for her leadership in bringing 
diversity and inclusion to the forefront 
of the conversation in the financial 
services industry. It was her vision to 
create the Financial Services Commit-
tee’s Subcommittee on Diversity and 
Inclusion, and I have had the honor to 
serve as its chair since its inception. 
The racial justice equity package be-
fore us today is very much the product 
of the subcommittee’s work over the 
past 3-plus years, and I am proud to say 
that many of its provisions were au-
thored by subcommittee members. Re-
publicans participated in the hearing, 
and today, when we deflect to issues 
like what we are hearing, it is very 
alarming. There is nothing controver-
sial in this package or the bills I am 
going to reference. 
Two of my bills are included in this 
package, the Diversity and Inclusion 
Data Accountability and Transparency 
Act, referred to as the D&I DATA Act, 
that will direct the Office of Minority 
and Women Inclusion to collect data on 
the financial institutions they oversee. 
This will allow us to measure the 
progress that banks and other financial 
institutions are making on diversity 
performance. 
b 1245 
My second bill is the Expanding Op-
portunity for Minority Depository In-
stitutions Act that will codify a pro-
gram at Treasury that pairs mentor 
businesses with protege MDIs, giving 
the smaller lenders access to things 
like technical assistance and con-
tracting opportunities. 
I am so pleased; in my Third Congres-
sional District of Ohio a new MDI has 
been approved. 
I also note that my bill, the Ensuring 
Diverse Leadership Act, has been made 
in order as an amendment and will be 
considered later. That amendment will 
require the Fed to consider candidates 
of diverse ethnicity and gender when 
filling vacancies in the Federal Reserve 
Bank. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Arkan-
sas (Mr. WESTERMAN), the ranking 
member of the Natural Resources Com-
mittee. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the ranking member for yield-
ing. 
I rise today to speak against H.R. 
2543. This bill does not address the un-
derlying causes restricting access to 
credit or inflation that has eroded 
many Americans’ borrowing power. It 
is just a mixed bag of extra mandates 
on the Federal Reserve and new regu-
latory burdens on small businesses. 
I don’t hear my small businesses ask-
ing for more regulation, additional 
compliance burdens, or the imposition 
of a sweeping social agenda. 
Families are struggling to afford food 
and gas. Small businesses are strug-
gling to hire employees, and my local 
banks and credit unions are feeling the 
pinch of inflation and rising interest 
rates every day. 
If the majority was serious about 
helping Americans, they would have 
made my amendments in order to ex-
amine the effects of inflation and bank 
consolidation on access to credit for 
those in low-income census tracts, 
rural 
counties, 
racial 
minorities, 
women, and veterans, the very commu-
nities that Democrat policies have hurt 
the most. My amendments would have 
been a step in the right direction, but 
the Democrat majority blocked them. 
Mr. Speaker, digging the hole deeper 
is no way to get out of the crisis the 
Democrat administration and Demo-
crat majorities in Congress have cre-
ated. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I will read from an article entitled: 
‘‘Examining the Black-White wealth 
gap’’ from the Brookings Institution 
dated February 27, 2020. ‘‘A close exam-
ination of wealth in the U.S. finds evi-
dence of staggering racial disparities. 
At $171,000, the net worth of a typical 
White family is nearly 10 times greater 
than that of a Black family ($17,150) in 
2016. Gaps in wealth between Black and 
White households reveal the effects of 
accumulated inequality and discrimi-
nation, as well as differences in power 
and opportunity that can be traced 
back to this Nation’s inception.’’ 
And this is why it continues, because 
people on that side of the aisle are will-
ing to tolerate invidious discrimina-
tion. They will talk about anything 
but 
invidious 
discrimination. 
They 
have no remedies. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
Missouri 
(Mr. 
CLEAVER), my friend. 
Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Speaker, first of 
all, I thank the floor manager, Mr. 
GREEN of Texas, and I stand with my 
colleagues and Chairwoman MAXINE 
WATERS of California who I know is 
watching this debate in support of the 
Financial Services Racial Equity, In-
clusion, and Economic Justice Act. I 
wish her a speedy return, but I thank 
her for the tremendous amount of work 
put into this piece of legislation, which 
would transform countless American 
lives for the better. 
I specifically highlight the inclusion 
of the CDFI Bond Guarantee Program 
Improvement Act—Community Devel-
opment Financial Institutions—a pri-
ority of the CDFI community. I thank 
Congressman WILLIAM
TIMMONS
from 
South Carolina for his partnership in 
advancing the bill through the Finan-
cial Services Committee by voice vote 
in committee markup last month. 
According to the CDFI Fund in 2019, 
33 percent of CDFI lending was in high- 
poverty areas, but we have got to do 
better. Seventeen percent was in rural 
areas. 
CDFIs are instrumental in providing 
affordable capital to communities typi-
cally excluded or underserved by the 
mainstream financial system. I am 
proud of committee efforts to provide 
additional resources to these mission- 
driven community institutions that 
have faced several challenges in recent 
years. 
Prior to the CDFI Bond Guarantee 
Program, CDFIs were extremely lim-
ited in their ability to access capital to 
make large-scale investments in com-
munity facilities, basic infrastructure 
projects, or job-generating businesses. 
The CDFI Bond Guarantee Program 
was enacted to provide long-term, low- 
cost capital to CDFIs which use the 
funding for economic development ac-
tivities in low-income urban, rural, and 
indigenous communities. 
My bill would authorize the program 
and reduce the minimum issuance from 
$100 million to $25 million, opening up 
the program to smaller CDFIs and to 
support more community development 
projects such as loans to small busi-
nesses, commercial real estate, afford-
able housing, and healthcare facilities 
all across the Nation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of 
this bill. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. DAVIDSON), the ranking member of 
the Fintech Task Force on the Finan-
cial Services Committee. 
Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to oppose this bill. The Fed is not 
meant to be a political weapon. With 
inflation above 8 percent and the econ-
omy on the verge of a recession, this is 
one of the most inopportune times in 
our Nation’s history to suggest that we 
turn the Fed into a political pawn. 
Our Nation is suffering from too 
much government. Inflation is a policy 
choice, and this delivers more govern-
ment to an agency that is supposed to 
be insulated from it. 
We know the recipe. We need more 
freedom, less government, and sound 
money. This thing distracts the Fed-
eral Reserve. 
Inflation doesn’t care about your 
race. The price of groceries, the price 
of 
healthcare, 
education, 
rent, 
it 
doesn’t care about your race or your 
gender. 
We 
have 
to 
stop 
the 
politicization of our government agen-
cies as Democrats—really the radical 
left—stays committed to this long 
march through our Nation’s institu-
tions to try to push an agenda at odds 
with the American public. If this bill 
does anything, it highlights that dis-
connect. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge every one of our 
colleagues to oppose this bill.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5571 
June 15, 2022 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, inflation does care 
about your race if you happen to be a 
person of color and you are applying 
for a loan. 
Inflation does care about your race if 
you happen to have fees added on that 
you shouldn’t have simply because you 
are a person of color. 
People of color have to deal with gen-
eral inflation and the specific inflation 
associated with invidious discrimina-
tion, and it is the intolerance by my 
colleagues across the aisle through the 
centuries that has perpetuated this 
level of inflation. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to direct their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. GARCIA). 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in support of H.R. 2543, the Finan-
cial Services Racial Equity, Inclusion, 
and Economic Justice Act. Let me re-
peat the words, this is what we are 
talking about: racial equity, inclusion, 
and economic justice. 
I thank Chairwoman WATERS
for 
bringing this legislation forward and 
for her leadership on all these impor-
tant issues. I thank Chairman GREEN 
who is the chair of the Subcommittee 
on Oversight and Investigations for 
navigating us through this bill being 
heard today. 
Specifically, I will speak about two 
bills which have been included in this 
important package, such as the Im-
proving Language Access in Mortgage 
Servicing Act. 
According to the U.S. Census, over 20 
percent—that is one out of five—house-
holds in the United States speak a lan-
guage other than English, and nearly 9 
percent of households lack a proficient 
English speaker. 
Homeownership is an opportunity to 
build generational wealth and speaking 
another language should never be a 
barrier in home buying and mort-
gaging. 
This legislation will establish lan-
guage access requirements in the eight 
most commonly spoken languages in 
the United States, besides English, for 
creditors and servicers to ensure that 
Americans 
who 
lack 
English 
pro-
ficiency are not at a disadvantage 
while buying a home. 
Imagine getting something from your 
mortgage company telling you you owe 
something or that you are at risk of 
maybe being foreclosed on, but it is all 
in English, and you speak no English. 
Of course, you will end up being in 
foreclosure because you don’t under-
stand the notice that you are getting. 
This is what my bill is about. 
The second bill is the Studying Bar-
riers to Housing Act, which has also 
been included in this package. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield an additional 20 seconds to the 
gentlewoman. 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
this legislation will require the GAO to 
conduct a study to identify housing 
barriers that contribute to the issue of 
homelessness. 
This study will find laws, regula-
tions, common practices, and funding 
formulas that create barriers to hous-
ing in an effort to pinpoint the prob-
lems in our system that cause home-
lessness to continue and grow. 
I am proud of both of these bills, and 
I hope that both of these bills pass to 
increase expanded language access and 
to find the root causes of homelessness. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Ten-
nessee (Mr. ROSE), my friend and col-
league, and a leader on the Financial 
Services Committee. 
Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for yielding. 
H.R. 2543 will do nothing to resolve 
the long list of crises the Biden admin-
istration’s policies have caused, such 
as 
runaway, 
devastating 
inflation; 
massive Federal debt; unacceptably 
high gas prices; a skyrocketing crime 
rate; and an open border that allows 
millions of illegal immigrants and tons 
of deadly fentanyl into our country. 
This bill, which has no chance of be-
coming law and is dead on arrival in 
the Senate, would impose additional 
and 
burdensome 
reporting 
require-
ments on public companies, reduce ac-
cess to credit, distract the Federal Re-
serve from pursuing its statutory man-
date, and further politicize our regu-
latory agencies. 
Families in middle Tennessee can’t 
find baby formula and are struggling to 
pay for groceries and gas while Demo-
crats are jamming through a partisan 
bill just to score political points with 
their leftwing progressive base. We 
must do better for our constituents and 
for our country. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
People of color are constituents. Peo-
ple of color are Americans. People of 
color deserve the opportunity to have 
equality of opportunity. 
Hundreds of years have gone by, and 
this is what we are getting as a result 
of those who would ignore the concerns 
of Americans of color. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. 
AUCHINCLOSS), a member of the Finan-
cial Services Committee. 
Mr. AUCHINCLOSS. Mr. Speaker, 
our economy has not always worked 
for everyone equally. This is evident in 
the 
glaring 
wealth 
disparities 
for 
American families emphasized in the 
2019 Survey of Consumer Finances Fed-
eral 
Reserve 
report. 
Chairwoman 
WATERS’ Financial Services Racial Eq-
uity, Inclusion, and Economic Justice 
Act is an effort to ease economic dis-
parities 
across 
racial 
and 
ethnic 
groups. The bill will also expand access 
to financial services for consumers and 
small businesses in underserved com-
munities. 
Consumers should have access to af-
fordable banking services, which re-
quires competition in the market. Over 
the last several decades, there has been 
consolidation amongst banks and cred-
it unions. This has effectively limited 
the products available to consumers 
and artificially driven up costs while 
closing banking branches for people 
who 
already 
did 
not 
have 
many 
choices. 
The Financial Services Racial Eq-
uity, Inclusion, and Economic Justice 
Act includes my bipartisan bill, the 
Promoting New and Diverse Depository 
Institutions Act, which is the first step 
to expand competition and increase the 
supply of banking services. My bill di-
rects banking regulators to work to-
gether to address the challenges that 
new depository institutions, including 
MDIs and CDFIs, face when applying 
for a charter. 
Starting and maintaining a new bank 
or credit union is hard work. It is the 
banking regulators’ responsibility to 
measure and mitigate the challenges 
that new banks face. My bill will help 
new banks, and in doing so will expand 
access to affordable services for under-
banked communities. 
The legislation we are considering 
today also includes other necessary eq-
uity bills, such as Congresswoman 
GARCIA’s, which expands language ac-
cess in mortgage services. Congress-
man GREEN’s bill would clarify that 
sexual orientation and gender identity 
are protected classes under credit dis-
crimination. 
I applaud Chairwoman WATERS’ lead-
ership on this bill, and I urge my col-
leagues to support it. 
b 1300 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. BUDD), my friend 
and colleague. 
Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, in the 
month of June, I asked a poll question 
on one of my telephone town halls. I 
asked: Has your family noticed a sharp 
rise in prices? And 94 percent of them 
said: Yes. The crazy part of this is that 
I am not talking about this June, I am 
talking about last June. 
The average family will be spending 
$5,200 more this year because of Joe 
Biden’s inflation. We are not debating 
solutions to this crisis today, we are 
debating economic justice. But for 
most Americans, the most economi-
cally just thing that we can do right 
now is to lower gas prices for everyone, 
and to help seniors on fixed incomes af-
ford their groceries. 
This crisis is real. It is not transi-
tory. It is not a so-called high-class 
problem. It is a tax and a burden on 
every citizen in our country. And as 
long as the Democrat majority in this 
Congress remains plagued by denial 
and distraction, the harder life will be-
come for American families. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself 1 minute.

tion indicates that the Black and

June 15, 2022 
White wealth gap reflects a society 
that has not and does not afford equal-
ity of opportunity to all of its citizens. 
This is evidenced today by the re-
sponses that we are getting. 
No effort to deal with the centuries 
of inequality. No desire to deal with in-
vidious discrimination. Always a rea-
son why we can’t get to it right now. I 
have been in Congress for years—never 
addressing this problem. 
Mr. Speaker, today is a day of reck-
oning for all of those who have been 
hiding behind other issues. Today they 
have to confront the truth. There is in-
vidious discrimination in America, it 
impacts the LGBTQ-plus, it impacts 
people of color, and women as well, and 
today we have legislation because of 
the Honorable MAXINE WATERS’ efforts 
that can deal with these issues. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from Wis-
consin (Mr. STEIL), a leader on the Fi-
nancial Services Committee. 
Mr. STEIL. Mr. Speaker, we are here 
at a point in time when prices are out 
of control. The American people are 
getting punched in the face by higher 
prices every day. 
Gas is over $5 a gallon. The American 
people are paying hundreds of dollars 
more per month because prices are out 
of control. The Federal Reserve has a 
mandate to maintain price stability. 
The Federal Reserve is failing in that 
mandate. My colleagues across the 
aisle—the outgoing majority—continue 
to try to add another mandate to the 
Federal Reserve. 
The Federal Reserve is failing on step 
one—price stability. Let’s address price 
stability so people aren’t getting clob-
bered every day by higher prices; so 
people aren’t getting clobbered when 
they go to fill up their car with gas; 
clobbered when they go to the gas sta-
tion; clobbered when they go to the 
grocery store to get groceries. 
The outgoing majority wants to add 
another mandate to the Federal Re-
serve at a period of time when the Fed-
eral Reserve is failing in their current 
mandate. Nothing could be more illogi-
cal. We need to get prices under con-
trol. 
We can do that by unleashing Amer-
ican energy and we can do that by con-
trolling wasteful spending in Wash-
ington, D.C. This bill is misplaced. This 
bill moves us in another direction. In-
stead, we should be focusing on actu-
ally controlling costs. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself 30 seconds. 
Mr. Speaker, people of color are clob-
bered every day by higher interest 
rates. They are clobbered every day by 
loans that have fees that are higher 
than loans for people of a different hue. 
These are the things that are being 
perpetuated when they tolerate this 
kind of behavior. For centuries they 
tolerated it. 
Now we have the opportunity to do 
something about it. Let’s eliminate 
these costs for some people so that we 
can deal with the costs for everybody. 
Until that is done, we have to have this 
bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. DONALDS). 
Mr. DONALDS. Mr. Speaker, the 
measure in front of us today just 
makes no sense. This measure is actu-
ally going to make inflation worse. 
Why? Because you are going to put a 
third mandate on the Federal Re-
serve—a Federal Reserve that has done 
a poor job of actually managing price 
stability. 
The same price stability that hurts 
poor Americans whether you are Black, 
whether you are Hispanic, or whether 
you are White. The same price stability 
that hurts middle-income Americans 
whether you are Black, whether you 
are Hispanic, or whether you are 
White. 
The only group of Americans who 
might even escape the sting of infla-
tion in the United States are rich 
Americans who happen to be Black, 
rich Americans who happen to be His-
panic, and rich Americans who happen 
to be White. 
The common denominator with mas-
sive inflation is that if you are poor, 
regardless of your race, you are being 
crippled. To have the majority party 
say today that they are going to add a 
third mandate onto the Federal Re-
serve is ludicrous. That does not ad-
dress the systemic disparities that 
exist with respect to wealth in America 
between Black families and White fam-
ilies. 
We all know the history. We under-
stand why there are Black families who 
do not have the same size of net worth 
as White families on an average basis. 
What you do not do is saddle our econ-
omy with more regulation and more 
silly policies, which will actually make 
our economy more efficient. 
How are Black families in the future 
going to actually increase their net 
worth if being able to apply for loans is 
more expensive? How do Black families 
actually increase their wages if our 
economy is saddled with more infla-
tion? It does not help Black people 
going forward, it actually hurts them, 
and it hurts everybody along the way. 
We should be getting the Federal Re-
serve back to one mandate—of sound 
money. That would actually help mat-
ters for poor Americans, regardless of 
their race. That is a bill myself and my 
colleague from Arkansas (Mr. HILL) 
have sponsored to get the Federal Re-
serve back into the right place. 
If you want to seriously have a con-
versation about systemic inequities, if 
you want to have a conversation about 
the difference in net worth between 
Black Americans and White Ameri-
cans, what you cannot do is shut off 
the economy, which would actually 
hurt Black families from growing their 
wealth into the future. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself 10 seconds. 
Mr. Speaker, we have just heard a 
great recitation on how to do nothing; 
how to maintain the status quo; how to 
be proud that you can stand up in the 
House of Representatives and defend 
the status quo for some 300 years. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
LEE). 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, 
first of all, let me thank Congressman 
GREEN who is a lifelong warrior for ra-
cial justice, for his tremendous leader-
ship, and for the time to speak this 
morning. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 2543, and I thank Chairwoman 
WATERS and the full committee and the 
Speaker for bringing this important 
bill to the floor. 
America’s racial wealth gap divide 
directly results from generations of 
slavery, segregation, and institutional 
racism. Black and Brown communities 
have never had—I mean, never have 
had—the same opportunities to build 
wealth as White communities. The gap 
has only increased and widened in re-
cent decades. This is a fact. 
This bill will ensure that Federal 
monetary policy focuses on reducing 
racial and ethnic disparities. It will re-
orient our financial systems to support 
wealth creation in historically under-
served communities. It will support a 
more level playing field for Black and 
Brown families—whether they are buy-
ing a home or building equity. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 
seconds. 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, 
to close the racial wealth gap, we must 
confront the systemic and institutional 
racism that has long stunted wealth 
creation in communities of color. In 
California, my home State, we didn’t 
even have a fair housing law until I be-
lieve it was 1964. Come on. That is gen-
erations of my family who weren’t even 
able to buy a house. They didn’t ac-
quire equity to be able to live the life 
that White people live in this country. 
Come on, please. H.R. 2543 is an im-
portant step in the direction to close 
these racial gaps. I urge my colleagues 
to support it. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Mrs. KIM). 
Mrs. KIM of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise in opposition to H.R. 2543. This 
bill threatens the independence of the 
Federal Reserve and does nothing to 
address the rising cost of living and the 
highest inflation that our country has 
seen in over four decades. In my home 
State of California, gas prices are aver-
aging $6.40 per gallon, and the cost of 
everyday goods continues to rise. 
The way the Fed can address socio-
economic disparities for all groups, in-
cluding our most vulnerable commu-
nities, is by focusing on the existing

dual mandate of price stability and 
maximum employment. Instead of let-
ting the Fed use its existing tools, my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
are attempting to politicize it. 
Congress should be focusing on ad-
dressing real wages being down 4.2 per-
cent and helping the Fed achieve a 
price stability mandate instead of en-
acting partisan policies. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on 
H.R. 2543. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman from 
Oklahoma (Mr. LUCAS), a longtime 
member and leader on the Agriculture 
Committee and the Financial Services 
Committee. 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in op-
position to H.R. 2543. The U.S. economy 
faces tremendous challenges. We have 
40-year high inflation, persistent sup-
ply chain disruptions, and tight labor 
markets. 
The American people are grappling 
with increased costs across every as-
pect of their life. Food is more expen-
sive, energy and gasoline prices have 
skyrocketed, and the cost of housing is 
surging. 
In 1977, when I first started out as a 
young farmer, we slid into the infla-
tionary period of the Carter years, and 
went through Chairman Volker’s dra-
matic tightening of the money supply. 
This period was devastating to my 
neighbors and the entire U.S. economy, 
and left a profound impact on how I 
view fiscal and monetary policy. 
Now is not the time to take the Fed-
eral Reserve’s eyes off the ball. Con-
gress should be focused on the issues 
that currently weigh on the economy 
and aim to strengthen the financial 
well-being of the American people. 
Mr. Speaker, I oppose H.R. 2543. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentleman from Arkan-
sas (Mr. HILL), a great leader on the Fi-
nancial Services Committee. 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I do rise in 
opposition to H.R. 2543. I thank my 
friend from Houston, Texas, and our 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle 
that worked on many of the bills that 
are in the package today. 
b 1315 
It is a shame that that package was 
not put together in such a way that we 
could be here in a bipartisan visit 
about the ones that we actually sup-
port and that we think could be en-
acted into law. Instead, Democrats 
have put together a partisan package 
of bills that politicize our central bank 
and do nothing to address the insidious 
inflation that is hurting all American 
families and workers—Black, Brown, 
and White. 
Mr. Speaker, one thing I know is that 
H.R. 2543 will not become law. Mr. 
Speaker, on Monday, Arkansans woke 
up and as they went to work and filled 
up their tanks for the week, they had 
to pay $5 for gas. That is not as high as 
it is here in Washington, but $5 is hurt-
ing all of the hardworking families in 
my State. 
While 
Treasury 
Secretary 
Janet 
Yellen is still toeing the economically 
illiterate party line on inflation, even 
economists from the left of center 
admit that government spending was 
too much and not targeted. 
Don’t believe me? 
Listen to President Biden’s key ad-
visers. 
Former Treasury Secretary Larry 
Summers predicted, a month after 
President Biden took office, that the 
proposed American Rescue Plan would 
‘‘set off inflationary pressures of a kind 
we have not seen in a generation.’’ 
Now Larry Summers is forecasting a 
recession. 
Steve Rattner, Mr. Obama’s former 
economic adviser on his staff, said Mr. 
Biden was ‘‘wrong to omit the impor-
tant contribution to inflation from ex-
cessive fiscal and monetary stimulus.’’ 
The truth is, after the CARES Act 
and the December appropriations bill 
of 2020, there was plenty of COVID 
money left over, and the economy was 
well on its way to recovery with vac-
cines being distributed. 
But House Democrats supercharged 
demand-side stimulus by adding an-
other $2 trillion in unpaid-for spending 
in that so-called American Rescue 
Plan. Mr. Speaker, Americans aren’t 
feeling rescued. They are feeling like 
hostages—hostages to the daily theft of 
the Biden inflation. 
Now, Mr. Speaker, the President 
fashions himself as a budget hawk, say-
ing last month that he personally re-
duced the deficit last year, and he is 
complaining that we on this side of the 
aisle aren’t giving him any credit. But 
what he doesn’t tell you, Mr. Speaker, 
is that he is taking credit for deficits 
that were falling due to those expiring 
COVID programs. 
The facts are, Mr. Biden has not re-
duced deficits. In fact, he has increased 
them. The Congressional Budget Of-
fice’s latest numbers project $16 tril-
lion in additional debt between now 
and 2032. 
So I hear a lot of talk about deflec-
tion on our House floor today, and the 
deflection of this bill, Mr. Speaker, is 
the deflection from the insidious infla-
tion that our families are facing. If 
House Democrats were serious, then 
they would target and spend less 
money. They would stop blaming Putin 
and accusing American companies of 
price gouging. They would stop cutting 
off capital to American energy compa-
nies through ESG mandates and in-
timidating banks, and they would stop 
threatening trillions in more taxes. 
While government spending and sup-
ply chain constraints have contributed 
to higher prices, this inflation also 
stems from the Fed’s loose monetary 
policy—too loose, too lax, and for too 
long. 
Just as House and Senate Repub-
licans worked to tailor and end the 
COVID funds at the end of 2020, we also 
urged the Federal Reserve to end zero 
interest rates and begin shrinking 
their balance sheet. Instead of doing 
anything to address these root causes 
of inflation, H.R. 2543 on the House 
floor would instead expand the Fed’s 
mandate to address socioeconomic dis-
parities. 
Two weeks ago, Mr. Biden met with 
Fed Chair Jerome Powell in the Oval 
Office where Mr. Biden said that he em-
braced the Fed’s independence. Appar-
ently, House Democrats didn’t get the 
memo. At a time when our central 
bank has failed to carry out its current 
mandate for sound money and price 
stability, Democrats want the Fed to 
not only be a climate regulator but 
also to end racial inequity. Expanding 
the Fed’s mandate to address socio-
economic disparities would further in-
ject uncertainty and risk into the 
Fed’s monetary policy and politicize 
our historically independent central 
bank. 
House Republicans believe Congress 
should return to pre-pandemic debates 
on our spending priorities, abandon 
economic pop science fads like modern 
monetary theory, and urge our Federal 
Reserve to return to its core mission. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
reject this bill, H.R. 2543. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
have no additional speakers, and I am 
prepared to close. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, 80 percent of Americans 
say inflation is the most important 
issue facing the country, that is ac-
cording to ABC News/Ipsos poll. We 
can’t get 80 percent of the American 
people to agree on anything in our po-
litical discussion, but they agree that 
this economy and this inflation are 
problematic. 
We have been given our marching or-
ders. Congress must act to address sky-
rocketing prices and provide relief to 
struggling families. That is what the 
American people are telling us we 
should be focused on. 
Instead, here we are debating a mes-
saging bill that stands no chance of be-
coming law. 
I have already run through a long list 
of bad things in this bill. I did that in 
my opening, so I would rather spend 
the rest of my time discussing what 
western North Carolinians are most 
worried about, what my constituents 
are most worried about. 
In the core part of my district known 
as the Catawba Valley, the cost of 
housing alone has increased more than 
15 percent since last year. Where I live 
in the Lake Norman region, local food 
banks are struggling to keep up with 
the surging cost of food and increased 
demand stemming from those costs. 
One food bank operator said: ‘‘We are 
out of staples.’’ 
That is a frightening thing. 
They also added: We are tired of high 
grocery bills. We are tired of gas prices

going up. One of my constituents from 
Winston-Salem said that on a local Fox 
affiliate. 
North Carolinians are fed up. The 
American people are fed up. They don’t 
like what they see economically, and 
they deserve real answers and real so-
lutions to address that core problem— 
the core issue of inflation. 
So let me be clear. There is no mys-
tery of why we have runaway inflation. 
It is Democrats’ reckless spending that 
is the driver of this. They have man-
aged the fiscal house for a year and a 
half, and they have managed to drive 
our economy into the ditch. 
So we have got to get it out of the 
ditch. We have got to get it back on 
the road. We have to be in the right di-
rection with a growing economy, not a 
shrinking economy, and with wages in-
creasing more than the cost of the 
goods that people need to live. 
So instead of addressing this crisis of 
their own making, Democrats would 
rather distract Americans with a bill 
that does nothing to bring down costs. 
This is yet another attempt to distract 
the American people from that basic 
challenge and that basic fact of high 
inflation. 
But to my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle: you aren’t fooling 
anyone. The American people are on to 
who caused inflation, who started in-
flation, and who is driving up the cost 
of energy bills, both at home and in 
their car. They understand why, and 
there are real consequences for not ad-
dressing the needs of the American 
people. 
Thankfully, I have faith in the Amer-
ican people to get this right. I hope our 
elected officials will follow suit. We, on 
the Republican side of the aisle, are 
hearing this loud and clear, and that is 
why we are trying to return to fiscal 
stability and fiscal sanity and return 
to sound money. That is our focus. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill doesn’t address 
the core problems the American people 
are telling us we should address, and 
that is why we should reject this bill 
that does nothing to answer the call 
the American people have made. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he 
may consume to the gentleman from 
Arkansas (Mr. HILL). 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
good friend, the ranking member on 
the House Financial Services Com-
mittee, Mr. MCHENRY, for his leader-
ship. 
Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to re-
commit. It addresses the core flaw that 
House 
Republicans 
believe 
presides 
today. We hear the voices of those 80 
percent of Americans who say that 
$5,000 extra coming out of our pockets 
is what is hurting the working fami-
lies, Black, White, and Brown, in my 
home State of Arkansas. We know in-
flation is the top issue facing this 
House and facing our families that we 
represent. 
That is why if we were to adopt my 
motion to recommit, we would instruct 
the Committee on Financial Services 
to adopt my amendment to H.R. 2543. 
This 
amendment, 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
is 
straightforward. It would simply focus 
the Federal Reserve, as Representative 
BYRON DONALDS so eloquently outlined, 
on a single mandate: price stability. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to include the text of my amend-
ment in the RECORD immediately prior 
to the vote on the motion to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Arkansas? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I urge a 
‘‘no’’ vote, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, it is painful to hear a 
Member of Congress talk about reck-
less spending when that spending is 
what was necessary during the pan-
demic. 
Is it reckless spending to allow peo-
ple to receive some sort of help when 
they couldn’t go to work, Mr. Speaker? 
My colleagues across the aisle would 
not have helped the American people 
who were out of work during a pan-
demic because it would be reckless 
spending. 
Is it reckless spending to keep people 
in their homes and not allow them to 
be foreclosed on? 
My colleagues across the aisle would 
have allowed people to be evicted and 
their things thrown in the streets be-
cause to them, helping people in a time 
of crisis is reckless spending. 
Is it reckless spending to put food on 
the table of people who can’t go to 
work? 
Is it reckless spending to make sure 
babies and children who are going to 
school get proper schools that can pro-
tect them during a virus and a pan-
demic that was killing people world-
wide? 
We put money into schools. We put 
money into police departments and fire 
departments. 
But 
that 
is 
reckless 
spending to my colleagues across the 
aisle. 
They are the best on the planet at 
doing nothing. Do-nothing politics is 
what that is all about. They find clever 
ways to find an opportunity to do noth-
ing by saying things that mean noth-
ing to the people who need help. 
Reckless spending. How dare they 
call it reckless spending when people 
are suffering and need help. 
Now, let me continue with the 
Brookings Institution with my final 
minutes. 
This is from the Brookings Institu-
tion: ‘‘Efforts by Black Americans to 
build 
wealth 
can 
be 
traced 
back 
throughout 
American 
history. 
But 
these efforts have been impeded in a 
host of ways, beginning with 246 years 
of chattel slavery and followed by con-
gressional mismanagement . . . ‘’ 
Let me repeat that: by congressional 
mismanagement. 
‘‘ . . . of the Freedmans Savings 
Bank, which left 61,144 depositors with 
losses of nearly $3 million in 1874, the 
violent massacre decimating Tulsa’s 
Greenwood District in 1921, a popu-
lation of 10,000 that thrived as the epi-
center of African-American business 
and culture, commonly referred to as 
Black Wall Street, and discriminatory 
policies throughout the 20th century 
including the Jim Crow Eras ‘Black 
Codes’ strictly limiting opportunity in 
many Southern States . . . . ‘’ 
Mr. Speaker, today has been the best 
evidence we need of why invidious dis-
crimination exists in this country, be-
cause there are people across the aisle 
who will tolerate it and who will come 
to this floor and talk about Americans 
as though you have to be White to be 
an American, as though people of color 
don’t count, as though the LGBTQ-plus 
community doesn’t count, and that 
women don’t count. To them, Mr. 
Speaker, if you are a White man, you 
are an American. 
But what about the rest of the people 
in this country who suffer? 
Mr. Speaker, it is a sad day to hear 
my colleagues across the aisle speak of 
reckless spending when people were 
suffering. 
I thank God that we have the courage 
to help people in a time of need. If I 
could do it again, I would do it because 
I saw the suffering. Perhaps they don’t 
see the suffering that I see. But I saw 
it, and I was prepared to do something 
about it. 
I believe that in the final analysis, 
those who refuse to tolerate the kind of 
invidious discrimination that we suffer 
each day in this country, they will be 
vindicated. They will be vindicated. 
I am grateful for the time, Mr. 
Speaker, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, this Pride 
Month we need to both celebrate the 
LGBTQI+ community and take action to fur-
ther LGBTQI+ equality. A vote for today’s bill 
is a vote to do just that. 
The Financial Services Racial Equity, Inclu-
sion, and Economic Justice Act includes a 
portion of my bill—the Equality Act—to explic-
itly prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex-
ual orientation and gender identity in credit. 
I urge my colleagues to support this bill and 
my amendment to explicitly clarify that all 
forms of sex discrimination are prohibited by 
the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. Importantly, 
my amendment makes clear that discrimina-
tion on the basis of sex stereotypes, preg-
nancy, childbirth, sexual orientation, gender 
identity, and sex characteristics, including 
intersex traits, are all forms of unlawful sex 
discrimination under the Equal Credit Oppor-
tunity Act. 
No one should be denied access to credit 
because of who they are or who they love. 
Yet, 7.7 million LGBT adults 18 and older live 
in states without statutes explicitly prohibiting 
LGBT discrimination in credit. 
A vote for today’s bill and my amendment 
will ensure long-lasting explicit nondiscrimina-
tion protections for the LGBTQI+ community 
and others in credit. 
I thank Chairwoman WATERS for introducing 
this bill and ensuring it is inclusive of the 
LGBTQI+ community. I urge my colleagues to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5575 
June 15, 2022 
stand with the LGBTQI+ community this Pride 
Month and vote for my amendment and the 
underlying bill. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of H.R. 2543, the Fi-
nancial Services Racial Equity, Inclusion, and 
Economic Justice Act. 
The Financial Services Racial Equity, Inclu-
sion, and Economic Justice Act would direct 
the Federal Reserve to provide reports on ra-
cial and ethnic disparities in employment, in-
come, wealth, and access to affordable credit. 
It also includes provisions that would establish 
language access requirements for creditors 
and servicers to better serve borrowers with 
limited English proficiency, allow all federal 
credit unions to expand their membership to 
include underserved communities, and clarify 
that financial institutions be required to collect 
their self-identified sexual orientation and gen-
der identity information to help combat dis-
criminatory practices against lesbian, gay, bi-
sexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ+) 
business owners. This bill also includes an 
amendment that I authored with my colleague 
from Rhode Island, Congressman JIM LAN-
GEVIN, to require disparities for individuals with 
disabilities to be published in the Federal Re-
serve’s reports. 
Let me share a brief example of why this 
legislation is necessary. Last year, a local 
news agency led an investigation in my district 
that revealed a long and tragic pattern of dis-
criminatory lending practices in South Dallas. 
It became apparent that several banks refused 
to give home loans to residents in low-income 
areas, in direct contradiction to federal laws 
protecting borrowers regardless of race or 
economic status. This is a failure of both pol-
icy and oversight, and is the exact type of 
issue that this bill would require the Federal 
Reserve to address. 
I want to thank Chairwoman WATERS and 
the members of the Financial Services Com-
mittee for bringing the Financial Services Ra-
cial Equity, Inclusion, and Economic Justice 
Act to the floor. I also want to thank the Chair-
woman for joining my roundtable on the dis-
criminatory lending practices in South Dallas 
last year. These stories are not unique to my 
district—they are found in communities across 
the country. That’s why we need a federal ap-
proach, and I urge all my colleagues to join 
me in supporting this bill.

FAIR
HOUSING

REPORT.—Not later than 18 
months after the date of the enactment of 
this subsection, the Secretary of Treasury, 
jointly with the Secretary of Housing and 
Urban Development, shall issue a report to

wealth-building opportunities within low-in-
come and minority communities that sup-
port collective ownership opportunities, in-
cluding through investments in worker co-
operatives, consumer cooperatives, commu-
nity land trusts, not-for-profit-led shared eq-
uity homeownership, and limited-equity co-
operatives, and to provide recommendations 
to the covered agencies and the Congress in 
the furtherance of these objectives. 
(B) PROGRESS
UPDATES.—Beginning not

enactment of this subsection, and every five

ury and the Secretary of Housing and Urban 
Development shall, after receiving the nec-
essary updates from the covered agencies, 
issue a report examining the progress made

tions to the covered agencies and the Con-
gress in furtherance of the objectives under

AMENDMENT NO. 2 OFFERED BY MRS. BEATTY OF 
OHIO 
Add at the end the following: 
TITLE VI—ENSURING DIVERSE 
LEADERSHIP OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE 
SEC. 601. SHORT TITLE. 
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Ensuring 
Diverse Leadership Act of 2022’’. 
SEC. 602. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS. 
The Congress finds that— 
(1) while significant progress has occurred 
due to the antidiscrimination amendments 
to the Federal Reserve Act, barriers con-
tinue to pose significant obstacles for can-
didates reflective of gender diversity and ra-
cial or ethnic diversity for Federal Reserve 
bank president positions in the Federal Re-
serve System; 
(2) the continuing barriers described in 
paragraph (1) merit the following amend-
ment; 
(3) Congress has received and reviewed tes-
timony and documentation of the historical 
lack of gender, racial, and ethnic diversity 
from numerous sources, including congres-
sional hearings, scientific reports, reports 
issued by public and private agencies, news 
stories, and reports of related barriers by or-
ganizations and individuals, which show that 
race-, ethnicity-, and gender-neutral efforts 
alone are insufficient to address the prob-
lem; 
(4) the testimony and documentation de-
scribed in paragraph (3) demonstrate that 
barriers across the United States prove prob-
lematic for full and fair participation in de-
veloping monetary policy by individuals re-
flective of gender diversity and racial or eth-
nic diversity; and 
(5) the testimony and documentation de-
scribed in paragraph (3) provide a strong 
basis that there is a compelling need for the 
below amendment to address the historical 
lack of gender, racial, and ethnic diversity in 
the Federal Reserve regional bank presidents 
selection process in the Federal Reserve Sys-
tem. 
SEC. 603. FEDERAL RESERVE BANK PRESIDENTS.

appointment of a president, the bank shall 
interview at least one individual reflective of 
gender diversity and one individual reflec-
tive of racial or ethnic diversity.’’. 
(b) REPORT.—Not later than January 1 of 
each year, each Federal reserve bank shall 
submit to the Committee on Banking, Hous-
ing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate, the 
Committee on Financial Services of the 
House of Representatives, and the Office of 
Inspector General for the Board of Governors

reau of Consumer Financial Protection a re-
port describing the applicant pool demo-
graphic for the position of the president of 
the Federal reserve bank for the preceding 
fiscal year, if applicable.

OF GEORGIA 
Add at the end the following: 
TITLE VI—‘‘EXPANDING ACCESS TO CRED-
IT 
THROUGH 
CONSUMER- 
PERMISSIONED DATA’’ 
SEC. 601. SHORT TITLE. 
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Expanding 
Access 
to 
Credit 
through 
Consumer- 
Permissioned Data Act’’. 
SEC. 602. FINDINGS. 
The Congress finds the following: 
(1) Using alternative data in mortgage 
lending (either through alternative credit 
scores or in underwriting) has the potential 
to increase access to credit for individuals 
with little or no credit history with the na-
tional credit reporting agencies (NCRAs), ac-
cording to a review of alternative data use in 
mortgage lending by the Government Ac-
countability Office in December 2021. 
(2) Approximately 45 million consumers do 
not have any credit history with the NCRAs 
or did not have enough credit history to be 
scored, according to a 2015 report by the Bu-
reau 
of 
Consumer 
Financial 
Protection 
(CFPB), 
entitled 
‘‘Data 
Point: 
Credit 
Invisibles’’. The CFPB also reported that 
this population disproportionately included 
low-income consumers, younger consumers, 
and consumers of color. 
(3) The use of alternative data to establish 
a low- or moderate-income borrower’s credit 
history for the purpose of extending mort-
gage credit can help lenders meet goals of 
the Community Reinvestment Act. 
(4) Mortgage underwriting systems that 
allow lenders to use consumer-permissioned 
alternative credit information may help ex-
pand access to mortgages for borrowers with 
lower credit scores and communities of 
color. On September 21, 2021, Fannie Mae up-
dated its automated underwriting system so 
that it notifies lenders that a borrower may 
benefit from the inclusion of consistent rent-
al payment information, and with the con-
sumer’s permission, the underwriting system 
will automatically identify rental payments 
within bank statement data and include this 
in its credit assessment. According to a fair 
lending and credit risk analysis by Fannie 
Mae and the Federal Housing Finance Agen-
cy, the populations most likely to benefit 
from this change are applicants with lower 
credit scores, who are disproportionately 
consumers of color. 
SEC. 603. REQUIREMENT TO CONSIDER ADDI-
TIONAL 
CREDIT 
INFORMATION 
WHEN MAKING MORTGAGE LOANS. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—The Equal Credit Oppor-
tunity Act (15 U.S.C. 1691 et seq.) is amended 
by inserting after section 701 the following: 
‘‘§ 701A. Requirement to consider additional 
credit information when making mortgage 
loans 
‘‘(a) IN GENERAL.—A creditor extending a 
mortgage loan shall, in evaluating the cred-
itworthiness of an applicant, consider credit 
information not reported through a con-
sumer reporting agency, if— 
‘‘(1) the applicant— 
‘‘(A) requests such consideration, and has 
not retracted such request; 
‘‘(B) provides the credit information to be 
considered; and 
‘‘(C) states that the applicant does not be-
lieve 
that 
credit 
information 
reported 
through consumer reporting agencies fully 
or accurately reflects the applicant’s credit-
worthiness in the absence of such informa-
tion; and 
‘‘(2) the credit information relates to the 
types of information that the creditor would 
consider if otherwise reported and includes 
current payment and transaction informa-
tion, such as bank statement information or 
rental payment information. 
‘‘(b) TREATMENT
OF ADDITIONAL INFORMA-
TION.—A creditor shall treat any information 
provided pursuant to subsection (a) in the 
same manner and with the same weight as 
the creditor would treat the same informa-
tion if it were provided by a consumer re-
porting agency, unless the creditor reason-
ably determines that the information is the 
result of a material misrepresentation. 
‘‘(c) NOTICE TO APPLICANTS.— 
‘‘(1) IN
GENERAL.—A creditor described 
under subsection (a) shall provide each appli-
cant for a mortgage loan with a notice that 
includes— 
‘‘(A) an explanation of the applicant’s 
right under this section to provide additional 
credit information to the creditor for consid-
eration, including examples of such addi-
tional information, as well as the benefits of 
providing such information; 
‘‘(B) the right of the creditor to disregard 
any such information if the creditor deter-
mines that the information is the result of a 
material misrepresentation; and 
‘‘(C) the right of an applicant to retract 
the applicant’s request to use such addi-
tional credit information at any point in the 
application process. 
‘‘(2) NOTICE LANGUAGES.—Notices required 
under paragraph (1) shall be made available 
in each of the 8 languages most commonly 
spoken by individuals with limited English 
proficiency, as determined by the Director of 
the Bureau using information published by 
the Director of the Bureau of the Census.

Bureau shall establish form language, which 
shall be used by each creditor when pro-
viding the notices required under this sub-
section, providing— 
‘‘(A) the examples described under para-
graph (1)(A); 
‘‘(B) the description of the benefits de-
scribed under paragraph (1)(A); and 
‘‘(C) the non-English language versions of

‘‘(d) CONSIDERATION OF ALTERNATIVE DATA;

(b) CLERICAL
AMENDMENT.—The table of 
contents for the Equal Credit Opportunity 
Act is amended by inserting after the item 
relating to section 701 the following: 
‘‘701A. Requirement to consider additional 
credit information when mak-
ing mortgage loans.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1170, the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. GREEN) and the 
gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. 
MCHENRY) each will control 10 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Texas. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, the 23 amendments of-
fered in this en bloc are a terrific ex-
ample of a working legislative process, 
a process through which well-consid-
ered legislation is further strengthened 
by the intellect, experience, and values 
of the House Democratic Caucus. 
These 
amendments 
broaden 
this 
package’s commitment to equity by 
ensuring that information is gathered 
regarding loans made to veterans, peo-
ple with disabilities, and the LGBTQ- 
plus community, which will help reveal 
unfair 
or 
discriminatory 
practices 
against these communities. 
We also have amendments that will 
ensure 
economic 
data 
are 
disaggregated within racial and ethnic 
groups, in recognition of the lived ex-
periences 
across 
different 
commu-
nities. 
The package is further bolstered by 
timely and necessary reporting ensur-
ing that communities of color and low- 
income communities have access to 
wealth-building opportunities, includ-
ing purchasing their first home and ac-
cessing capital. 
Furthermore, this package includes 
amendments that will help us to better 
understand and address the country’s 
growing affordable housing and home-
lessness crises that have disproportion-
ately affected people of color. 
For these reasons, I urge my col-
leagues to support these amendments 
being considered en bloc. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I claim 
the time in opposition. 
Mr. Speaker, I oppose the amend-
ment en bloc. We know that Demo-
crats’ reckless spending and bad eco-
nomic policies are hurting the Amer-
ican people. 
Let’s look at the inflation numbers. 
You have fuel oil, gasoline, used cars, 
groceries, and public transit all dra-
matically up. 
Inflation is the big issue. Inflation is 
at a 40-year high of 8.6 percent—a 40- 
year high. Food is up 10 percent, gas 50 
percent, shelter 5.5 percent from just 
last year. This is a result of Democrat 
policies. 
The American people will pay $5,200 
more this year than last year for the 
same goods and services. This is a di-
rect result of bad economic policies. 
Instead of working with Republicans 
to address these crises, Democrats are 
jamming through a partisan messaging 
bill that stands no chance of becoming 
law. This is bad policy. It is bad poli-
tics, bad process, the whole thing. The 
en bloc is more of the same. 
Now, I will say that there are a few of 
the 
amendments 
that 
Republicans 
could support. I will give you an exam-
ple. 
Ms. GARCIA
offered an amendment 
that focused on onerous HUD regula-
tions or unfair funding formulas. Com-
mittee Republicans and House Repub-
licans agree that HUD should not get 
in the way of local public housing au-
thorities’ ability to provide assistance 
to the homeless. 
A recent Government Accountability 
Office study examines—well, there is a 
request in the bill that we have a study 
to examine and report on the impedi-
ments that HUD is putting in place so 
that we can actually better serve the 
very people that we intend for the 
Housing and Urban Development De-
partment to serve and for public hous-
ing authorities to serve. 
But rather than work with com-
mittee 
Republicans 
on 
this 
issue, 
Democrats poisoned the well with par-
tisan amendments to score political 
wins with their progressive base. 
For example, in this en bloc, Demo-
crats want to further politicize the 
Federal Reserve by adding a third man-
date to address socioeconomic issues. 
This will divert the Fed’s attention 
from its dual mandate of maximum 
sustainable employment and price sta-
bility. It will also threaten the sta-
bility of the monetary policy authori-
ties we have given the Fed and add un-
certainty and risk to the Fed’s respon-
sibilities. 
The Federal Reserve is independent 
for a reason. It ensures that it is ac-
countable to the American people and 
long-term economic growth, not to po-
litical whims or serving one party here 
in Washington. Even President Biden 
acknowledged the importance of the 
Fed’s independence in his so-called 
plan for fighting inflation. 
Additionally, this en bloc continues 
Democrats’ government-knows-best ap-
proach. For example, it directs HUD 
and Treasury to create another inter-
agency task force to focus on the state 
of housing in this country. Housing 
doesn’t need another task force. It 
needs results. 
To be clear, HUD’s mission is to ‘‘cre-
ate strong, sustainable, inclusive com-
munities and quality affordable homes 
for all.’’ 
After 50 years, and nearly $2 trillion 
in spending, this amendment says that 
HUD is not getting the job done. An ad-
ditional interagency task force isn’t 
going to fix that. 
Congress needs to reform how HUD 
operates so that it can assist the fami-
lies and individuals it is tasked with 
serving. 
In conclusion, this en bloc is more of 
the same. It will politicize the Fed, ex-
pand the CFPB’s authority, and make 
credit harder to access and more expen-
sive, ultimately harming the very con-
sumers Democrats are claiming to 
help. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
oppose this en bloc, and I urge my col-
leagues to oppose the bill. I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself 15 seconds. 
Mr. Speaker, this is not another 
mandate. This is simply a requirement 
that the Fed fulfill its two mandates, 
the dual mandates to all of its people, 
to make sure that all people have price 
stability. This is what it is about. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from New York (Ms. 
VELA´ ZQUEZ). 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of the en bloc amend-
ment. 
The COVID–19 pandemic exacerbated 
the wealth and economic inequalities 
faced by many individuals, families, 
and small business owners in our Na-
tion’s LMI and communities of color. 
As chair of the House Small Business 
Committee, I fought to ensure our Na-
tion’s women-, LGBTQ-, and minority- 
owned small businesses had access to 
Federal recovery programs and main-
stream sources of credit to the same 
degree as White-owned firms or those 
with preestablished relationships with 
the big banks. Unfortunately, struc-
tural barriers and historical inequities 
in our society continue to cause women 
and small business owners of color to 
face ongoing challenges when applying 
for affordable and timely credit. 
This bill will help break down these 
structural barriers, root out discrimi-
nation where it exists, and promote en-
trepreneurship and other wealth-build-
ing opportunities for women, LGBTQ 
individuals, and people of color. By ad-
dressing these disparities, we can cre-
ate a more resilient economy and one 
that works for everyone. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on 
this bill. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
how much time do we have remaining?

June 15, 2022 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Texas has 71⁄4 minutes re-
maining. The gentleman from North 
Carolina has 6 minutes remaining. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Michigan (Ms. TLAIB). 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I thank our 
incredible Chairwoman WATERS
and 
our committee staff for working with 
me on an amendment and, again, for 
their leadership on the bill as a whole. 
I am proud to represent Michigan’s 
13th Congressional District, a commu-
nity that is incredibly diverse. Our di-
versity, as we all know, is our strength. 
We also know, though, that the way 
our government currently tracks race 
and ethnicity is outdated and defi-
nitely needs to change. Our govern-
ment currently considers all people of 
Middle Eastern and North African de-
scent to be ‘‘White,’’ a categorization 
that myself and many in our commu-
nity consider to be very inaccurate. 
Our government currently has broad 
categories that lump together whole 
continents, ignoring the vast diversity 
of our people living here. 
So my amendment simply builds on 
Congresswoman JAYAPAL’s amendment 
to ensure that we are providing the 
maximum flexibility possible to Ameri-
cans so that they can accurately re-
flect their race and ethnicity on gov-
ernment forms. This, in turn, will help 
us in Congress and our government at 
large to better identify issues affecting 
specific communities so that we can 
have programs that effectively serve 
our diverse communities. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I am 
prepared to close, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Massachusetts (Ms. PRESSLEY). 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Speaker, for too 
long, our policies and financial systems 
have exacerbated inequities and dis-
parities throughout our country. I rise 
in support of our disabled neighbors 
who have been subjected to a second- 
class standard of living. 
By passing the Financial Services 
Racial Equity, Inclusion, and Eco-
nomic Justice Act, the House will 
move one step closer to addressing 
these systemic injustices. 
Today, I rise in support of a series of 
amendments I have offered to advance 
disability justice. My amendments will 
prohibit financial creditors from dis-
criminating against consumers who are 
disabled and increase access to inter-
pretation services, including American 
Sign Language. 
My amendment will also hold cor-
porations accountable to disclose the 
disability status, based on voluntary 
self-identification, of their board of di-
rectors and executive officers. 
The status quo will not change until 
we recognize that disability rights are 
human rights and call out and address 
the barriers the disability community 
faces. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support my amendments and support 
the underlying bill. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Ohio (Ms. BROWN). 
Ms. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank Congressman GREEN for yield-
ing. I thank Chairwoman WATERS for 
her leadership on this bill. 
For far too long, consumers and busi-
nesses in the underserved communities 
have been blocked from accessing safe 
and 
affordable 
capital 
and 
credit. 
These systemic barriers worsen racial 
and economic inequality and cut off op-
portunity for too many Americans. 
This critical bill recognizes these 
changes and supports efforts to elimi-
nate racial disparities in lending. 
My amendment is simple. It requires 
the Federal Reserve’s ‘‘Monetary Pol-
icy Report’’ to include demographic in-
formation on individuals with depend-
ent children in its analysis of labor 
force trends. 
Why is it important? Because while 
the unemployment rate is near historic 
lows, women with children have been 
one of the slowest groups to return to 
work. Solutions like the child tax cred-
it and affordable childcare would help 
working 
families 
better 
balance 
childcare responsibilities and their ca-
reers. This amendment would ensure 
we have the data to understand this 
problem and begin to address it. 
I thank Chairwoman WATERS, again, 
for her leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support my amendment and the under-
lying bill. 
b 1345 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, 
H.R. 2543 represents a seismic and pow-
erful response to racial discrimination 
in financial products. Thank you to 
Chairwoman WATERS, and to my col-
league who is managing, for the leader-
ship given. 
My amendment is very important. I 
am pleased that my amendment is in-
cluded in the en bloc amendment that 
the Financial Services Committee has 
today. 
It requires the Federal Reserve Board 
to submit a report to Congress about 
the prevalence of racial discrimination 
in lending to victims of a Federally de-
clared disaster. I know it well. 
This amendment merits the support 
of all of my colleagues because no dis-
trict is exempt from natural disasters. 
I am reminded of 2017, among others, in 
my district where it was devastated by 
Hurricane Harvey over an area of 41,500 
square miles, 21 trillion gallons of rain-
fall, and one-third of Houston under-
water. 
There 
was 
major 
discrimination 
against Black and Brown Houstonians 
who sought loans or home loans or fi-
nancing to pay for repairs. They faced 
obstacles, delays, and outcomes that 
were different than their neighbors. 
Mr. Speaker, this endemic discrimi-
nation was seen in efforts to gain as-
sistance from the Small Business Ad-
ministration. 
Mr. Speaker, as an outspoken advocate for 
equity in this country’s economy, I rise in sup-
port of the Financial Services Racial Equity, 
Inclusion, and Economic Justice Act. 
This bill requires that financial services reg-
ulators and companies establish procedures to 
ensure racial equity and eliminate racial dis-
parities in all aspects of their operations in-
cluding employment, income, wealth, and ac-
cess to affordable credit. 
In addition to the reforms in H.R. 2543, the 
bill requires regulators to provide reports to 
Congress about economic inequality, espe-
cially within the labor force, and enact plans to 
minimize said inequalities. 
America’s economy has only rarely worked 
to the advantage of working-class people. 
Worse still, there has been an endemic and 
vile trend of implicit and perhaps explicit dis-
crimination against people of color within poli-
cies and overall economic policy. 
However, unfair monetary policy is not just 
an anachronism from long ago or a relic from 
a different era. It is happening now. 
Recent analyses have found that algorithms 
used by lenders often are designed in such a 
way that they result in black and brown Ameri-
cans being charged higher interest rates. 
This legislation takes a major step toward 
fixing 
long-overdue—disparities 
and 
fun-
damentally changing the financial services in-
dustry to make it proactive in fighting eco-
nomic discrimination. 
I am also very pleased that my amendment 
is included in the En Bloc Amendment that the 
Financial Services committee is bringing be-
fore the House today. 
My amendment requires the Federal Re-
serve Board to submit a report to Congress 
about the prevalence of racial discrimination in 
lending to victims of a federally declared dis-
aster. 
This amendment merits the support of all of 
my colleagues because no district is exempt 
from natural disasters, and with the accelera-
tion of climate change, it is increasingly likely 
that these events will occur even in areas of 
the country that previously felt insulated from 
them. 
When disasters occur, our Nation has a 
moral and legal duty to facilitate their recovery 
and rebuilding. It is totally unacceptable and 
abhorrent for racial or ethnic discrimination to 
be injected into decisions on financial factors 
impacting remedial action. 
However, in some instances, discrimina-
tion—whether by intent or effect—has oc-
curred during these moments of greatest 
need. 
For example, in 2017, my district in Houston 
was one of the many in Texas devastated by 
Hurricane Harvey. Over an area of 41,500 
square miles spanning Texas and Louisiana, 
the storm dropped nearly 21 trillion gallons of 
rainfall and damaged 203,000 homes, of 
which 12,700 were destroyed. 
At its peak on September 1, 2017, one third 
of Houston was underwater, and over 300,000 
structures of all types were flooded in south-
eastern Texas, where extreme rainfall hit 
many areas that are densely populated. 
Hurricane Harvey was the largest housing 
disaster to strike the U.S. in our Nation’s his-
tory. When the cleanup began, thousands of 
Houstonians needed loans to help rebuild their 
homes and their lives.

But black and brown Houstonians who 
sought loans or home loan refinancing to pay 
for repairs faced obstacles, delays, and out-
comes that were different from their other 
neighbors. This endemic discrimination was 
seen in efforts to gain assistance from the 
Small Business Administration. 
If there was ever a moment when our finan-
cial systems need to fully support minority 
communities, it is after they have been deci-
mated by a natural disaster. 
For majority Houstonians who applied and 
received a $200,000 loan from the Small Busi-
ness Administration or $25,000 by virtue of a 
government declaration, the process was 
streamlined. They could also apply for and re-
ceive $40,000 from the SBA to replace or re-
pair personal property—such as clothing, fur-
niture, cars, and appliances—that was dam-
aged or destroyed in the disaster. 
The SBA asks applicants for collateral, such 
as a first or second mortgage on the damaged 
real estate, which are common forms of collat-
eral for an SBA disaster loan. 
In the case of majority applicants, it was 
found that the SBA usually would not decline 
a loan for lack of collateral. 
However, for black and brown families, the 
system worked differently. Financing was dif-
ficult to access. Applications for loans from 
black and brown residents were less likely to 
be approved than applications from their white 
counterparts. 
My amendment protects black and brown 
Americans who face the consequences of a 
debilitating natural disaster. It would guarantee 
their protection from unfair policies in their 
most vulnerable moments. 
Fighting economic discrimination should be 
a bipartisan issue. No American deserves to 
be left behind because of antiquated monetary 
policy or a federal government that refuses to 
fight on their behalf. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
recognize the discrimination and to fix 
it by adding the Jackson Lee amend-
ment. 
I include in the RECORD an article ti-
tled: ‘‘Black Communities are Last in 
Line for Disaster Planning in Texas.’’ 
[From the Washington Post, May 12, 2022] 
BLACK COMMUNITIES ARE LAST IN LINE FOR 
DISASTER PLANNING IN TEXAS 
HOUSTON.—Lawrence Hester worries every 
time it rains. During heavy storms, water 
overflows the dirt drainage ditch fronting his 
yard and the bayou at the end of his block— 
flooding the street, creeping up his front 
steps, pooling beneath the house, and trap-
ping his family inside. ‘‘We are always un-
derwater here,’’ said Hester, 61. And yet, the 
state of Texas allocated none of the $1 billion 
in federal funds it received to protect com-
munities from future disasters to neighbor-
hoods in Houston that flood regularly, ac-
cording to an investigation by the U.S. De-
partment of Housing and Urban Develop-
ment. 
HUD has now found the exclusion of those 
majority Black and Hispanic urban commu-
nities to be discriminatory. The state ‘‘shift-
ed money away from the areas and people 
that needed it the most,’’ disproportionately 
benefiting White residents living in smaller 
towns, the agency concluded. Houston has 
faced seven federally declared disasters in 
the last seven years and suffered an esti-
mated $2 billion in damage from Hurricane 
Harvey in 2017. That storm devastated 
Kashmere Gardens, where Hester has lived 
his entire life. The floodwaters from Harvey 
deposited black mold throughout Hester’s 
home and left his daughter chronically short 
of breath. 
The state, which is appealing HUD’s find-
ings, denied discriminating, saying the Texas 
General Land Office administered the federal 
grant program based on HUD approval. The 
situation in Texas illustrates the challenge 
facing the Eiden administration, which has 
pledged to focus on racial equity but is 
struggling to protect low-income commu-
nities of color from the growing threat of cli-
mate change. Even after HUD’s finding of 
discrimination, the agency said it does not 
have the power at this time to suspend the 
rest of the $4.3 billion in disaster mitigation 
money awarded to the state under criteria 
approved by the Trump administration. 
‘‘What is happening here with these federal 
dollars going through the state and not one 
dime coming to the City of Houston post- 
Hurricane Harvey is absolutely crazy, and it 
cannot be justified,’’ said Houston Mayor 
Sylvester Turner. ‘‘What do I say to the peo-
ple in Kashmere Gardens when these storms 
keep coming, and we are not putting in the 
infrastructure that they desperately need to 
mitigate the risk of future flooding?’’ 
Black and Hispanic communities in north-
east Houston, including Kashmere Gardens, 
are especially vulnerable to the more fre-
quent storms and catastrophic flooding ex-
pected due to climate change, according to 
the Federal Emergency Management Agen-
cy. Many of the residential streets lack 
curbs and gutters—common storm drainage 
infrastructure 
in 
predominantly 
White 
neighborhoods in Houston—and rely instead 
on open ditches dating back to the 1930s. 
‘‘Sometimes we can’t get out because the 
water is so high,’’ said Jackie Spradley, Hes-
ter’s wife. ‘‘You’re literally trapped until the 
water starts to subside.’’ She can’t get to 
work. Their 12–year-old daughter can’t get to 
school. The whoosh of traffic and trains per-
meates the triangular neighborhood of mod-
est single-family homes penned between two 
highways and two sets of railroad tracks. 
During large storms, runoff from impervious 
highway surfaces flows onto residential 
streets. 
Piles of trash—old tires, mattresses, fur-
niture, 
home 
insulation—accumulate 
for 
weeks in the drainage ditches along many 
streets, blocking water from flowing through 
the ditches to the bayou. Silt and other de-
bris clog many of the culverts beneath nar-
row driveways and footpaths spanning the 
ditches. In the summers, standing water 
breeds mosquitoes. The city of Houston had 
hoped to use $95 million in federal grants to 
upgrade Kashmere Gardens’ storm drainage 
infrastructure. The proposed improvements, 
including converting some of the ditches to a 
curb and gutter system, would have removed 
the flood risk to nearly 1,400 properties. But 
without the money, the city shelved those 
plans. 
Hester’s daughter Ashlei was 7 years old in 
2017 when Harvey floodwaters breached their 
family room, lapping at the legs of the card 
table on which the family played dominoes. 
Her cough worsened, and doctors prescribed 
four different medications for asthma. She 
was hospitalized in 2018 for more than a 
week. But doctors still did not know what 
was causing her illness. It wasn’t until De-
cember 2019, more than two years after Har-
vey, when Hester and his wife discovered the 
black mold that was making their daughter 
so sick. A city inspector recommended that 
the house be condemned. 
‘‘I was so ashamed,’’ Hester said. ‘‘We 
didn’t have nowhere else to go.’’ 
His mother had purchased the home in 
1960, paying the mortgage with wages from 
her job flipping burgers 16 hours a day. Hes-
ter was born in the house months later. He 
had stayed in the house after Hurricane 
Alicia flooded the home in 1983. And after 
Ike in 2008. Even after Harvey, Hester 
stayed, hoping to someday pass the three- 
bedroom ranch-style home onto his daugh-
ter. But Hester, who is on disability for her-
niated disks in his back and neck from his 
years as a long-haul truck driver, and his 
wife, who sells insurance, never had the 
money to adequately repair the storm-rav-
aged roof and mold-covered walls. Hester 
said the city informed him after Harvey that 
he was ineligible for funding to fix the home 
because of unpaid property taxes ‘‘It’s not 
just about the storm drainage,’’ Hester said. 
‘‘It’s about everything.’’ 
Hester said that the rainbow-hued oily 
waters he had splashed in while playing in 
the drainage ditches as a child had been pol-
luted with cancer-causing creosote used to 
treat wooden railroad ties and utility poles. 
A 2019 state health department investigation 
confirmed elevated cancer rates among resi-
dents in the southern end of Kashmere Gar-
dens, located near two Superfund sites. Resi-
dents fear that flooding will carry toxic de-
posits into their yards. Hester’s mother had 
died of cancer. So had his father. And one of 
his brothers. ‘‘Cancer is killing the whole 
neighborhood,’’ said Hester, who is too afraid 
to visit the doctor about his own health 
problems. 
Federal disaster mitigation grants are sup-
posed to improve the inferior flood infra-
structure in lower income communities. But 
the HUD investigation found that competi-
tion rules set by the Texas General Land Of-
fice unfairly favored smaller towns with less 
urgent needs and where residents are more 
likely to be White and less likely to be lower 
income. The state knowingly adopted scor-
ing criteria that prioritized lower-density 
areas and excluded communities that HUD 
designated as the most impacted by disasters 
from half the grants, HUD said. ‘‘Because the 
criteria had these unjustified discriminatory 
effects, their use failed to comply with 
HUD’s regulations,’’ the agency found. 
No other state adopted Texas’ method of 
distributing the funds, according to HUD’s 
Office of Fair Housing and Equal Oppor-
tunity. The agency concluded that without 
Texas’s discriminatory criteria, nearly four 
times as many Black residents and more 
than twice as many Hispanic residents would 
have benefited from the grants. The General 
Land Office said in its April 1 appeal that the 
state 
‘‘does 
not 
discriminate, 
and 
the 
projects it has funded help minority bene-
ficiaries across Texas.’’ The state said more 
than two-thirds of residents in communities 
that received awards are Black, Hispanic or 
Asian. The state pointed out that its plan 
was approved two years ago and character-
ized HUD’s new objections as ‘‘politically 
motivated.’’ 
In addition to Houston and surrounding 
Harris County, the General Land Office de-
nied grants to the predominantly Black and 
Hispanic cities of Port Arthur, Beaumont 
and Corpus Christi as well as Jefferson and 
Nueces counties—all of which experienced 
significant flooding from Harvey, according 
to the civil rights complaint. Texas Housers, 
a nonprofit focused on housing in low-income 
communities, and Northeast Action Collec-
tive, a grassroots advocacy group of Houston 
residents, filed the complaint with HUD last 
year. Instead, funds were steered toward in-
land, Whiter communities that were far less 
severely impacted by hurricanes and used to 
fund routine infrastructure, the complaint 
said. That includes $17.5 million for a new 
community center in Caldwell County that 
is supposed to double as an evacuation cen-
ter; $10.8 million to install a sewage system 
in the 379–person town of Iola; $6 million for 
a new sheriffs department radio tower and

radios for Gonzales County; and $4.2 million 
for a 2,000-foot-long road in Bastrop County 
to connect a Walmart parking lot and a 
Home Depot, justified as an alternate path 
for emergency vehicles in case the adjacent 
freeway is clogged with hurricane evacuees 
from the Gulf Coast 161 miles away. 
‘‘These mitigation funds are a strategy to 
undo the systemic racism of the past, but 
that’s not what we’re seeing Texas inter-
ested in at all,’’ said John Henneberger, co- 
director of Texas Housers. ‘‘This is a test of 
how serious HUD and the Biden administra-
tion are in enforcing civil rights.’’ HUD’s Of-
fice of Community Planning and Develop-
ment, which oversees disaster mitigation 
aid, wrote to the Texas General Land Office 
in March expressing ‘‘grave concerns’’ over 
the distribution of the first round of grants. 
‘‘The State has not identified a plan to pro-
tect communities while guarding against 
competition criteria that could disadvantage 
minority residents,’’ HUD wrote. If a vol-
untary resolution cannot be reached, HUD 
said it could refer the matter to the Depart-
ment of Justice for enforcement. But advo-
cates worry that could come too late for 
communities like Kashmere Gardens. While 
HUD said it cannot stop the state from 
awarding the rest of the grants ‘‘due to prior 
decisions,’’ it would begin monitoring how 
the money is distributed and warned it could 
claw back the funds if necessary. 
‘‘Texas has a history of sending money to 
those who are politically connected,’’ said 
Shannon Van Zandt, a professor of urban 
planning at Texas A&M University whose re-
search focuses on hazard reduction and hous-
ing. She noted that racial disparities oc-
curred with the distribution of disaster funds 
after Hurricane Ike in 2008. Civil rights advo-
cates say HUD has the authority to suspend 
Texas’s ability to spend federal grant money; 
it has done so under previous administra-
tions. But Sara Pratt, former deputy assist-
ant secretary in HUD’s fair housing office 
who is now representing Texas Housers as an 
attorney, said there is long-standing division 
among HUD staff over enforcing civil rights 
violations when making funding decisions. 
‘‘There is deep disagreement internally,’’ 
Pratt said. ‘‘The secretary’s job is to resolve 
disputes like this.’’ HUD Secretary Marcia L. 
Fudge declined to comment because the 
Texas investigation remains open, HUD 
spokesman Michael Burns said. ‘‘Her com-
mitment to civil rights and fair housing is 
well documented and unwavering, and she is 
committed to ensuring that all HUD funds 
are used in compliance with all relevant laws 
and program requirements,’’ Burns said. In 
response to widespread criticism over how 
the first $1 billion in Harvey disaster grants 
was distributed, Texas now plans to allocate 
$750 million to Harris County. Houston is due 
to receive an additional $9 million out of $488 
million that the state plans to send to the 
Houston-Galveston 
region.

point out that the $9 million amounts to less 
than one tenth of the cost of its proposed im-
provements to Kashmere Gardens. 
In Kashmere Gardens on a recent morning 
after a thunderstorm inundated streetside 
drainage ditches, bulldozers and dump trucks 
worked to widen and deepen Hunting Bayou 
to absorb runoff from future storms. The 
work is a small portion of a $2.5 billion flood 
protection bond that Harris County passed in 
2018. The bulk of the bond money was di-
rected to wealthier neighborhoods because 
the county expected to receive federal dis-
aster funds for poorer ones, according to 
county commissioner Rodney Ellis. But 
without money to upgrade the ditch system 
to drain storm water from neighborhood 
streets, it’s unclear if the bayou expansion 
will be effective. 
‘‘This is the Texas two-step in Houston. 
You have to get the water from the neigh-
borhoods to the bayous. And then you have 
to get the water from the bayous to the Gulf 
of Mexico,’’ said Ellis, who represents the 
area. Residents, too, remain skeptical. ‘‘It’s 
a wait and see situation,’’ said Dorothy 
Wanza, another Kashmere Gardens resident 
whose street turned into a river during Har-
vey and flooded her home with more than a 
foot of water. The experience left the So- 
year-old so traumatized that ‘‘every time it 
rains, I get the hell out of dodge.’’ 
She spent the previous night fully dressed, 
prepared to evacuate to one of her children’s 
homes. ‘‘The ditches overflow, and once they 
are full, the water comes back on you,’’ 
Wanza said. On the other side of the bayou, 
Hester said the city had recently cleaned out 
part of a ditch lining his street for the first 
time he could recall in more than a decade. 
Dirt and bricks still block some of the cul-
verts. 
‘‘Right up under there, look,’’ he said, 
pointing beneath the concrete walkway lead-
ing from the street to his front yard. ‘‘It’s 
stopped up on both sides.’’ He nodded farther 
down the street to another culvert: ‘‘That 
whole drain hole was flooded.’’ He and his 
next door neighbor had removed as many 
bricks as they could to move the water 
through. ‘‘If we don’t do things around here, 
ain’t nothing going to get done. I have to go 
around here and try to help, and I’m in bad 
shape myself.’’ Hester limped around the pe-
rimeter of his home and pointed two feet up 
the siding where Harvey floodwaters had 
reached—a reminder of the catastrophe he 
says he failed to protect his daughter from. 
A nonprofit had removed the mold inside 
when it fixed up the house in 2020, installing 
new cabinets, a new roof and laminate floor-
ing. But the entryway still slopes. The floor 
joists need to be repaired. The porch is lop-
sided, its wood rotted. Hester is stooped from 
years of pain. Yet he remains intent on doing 
what he can to make things right. ‘‘It’s not 
my life I’m worried about. It’s my daugh-
ter’s,’’ Hester said. ‘‘I’m half dead.’’ 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Pennsylvania (Ms. HOULAHAN). 
Ms. HOULAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of my commonsense 
amendments that, one, ensure commu-
nity banking institutions will work 
better to support young women and 
people of color, and two, that credit 
unions help us advance financial lit-
eracy. 
As a businessowner and entrepreneur 
myself, I understand the challenges of 
getting product from the garage or 
trunk of your car into a storefront win-
dow or onto the online sales opportuni-
ties. 
We know that Community Develop-
ment Financial Institutions, or CDFIs, 
are all key partners in successful busi-
ness development, but they cannot do 
it alone. 
My first amendment builds on past 
successes by revising the Young Entre-
preneurs 
Program 
to 
ensure 
that 
women and people of color receive the 
focus and financial support that they 
need. 
Simply put, our local economies 
truly grow and thrive when we support 
all of our budding entrepreneurs. We 
have an established partner to help us 
do that already, which is credit unions. 
That brings me to my second effort, 
which would require credit unions to 
include a description of financial edu-
cation programs in their reports to en-
sure that information is accessible and 
transparent. 
Financial management, budgeting, 
and making informed and effective de-
cisions with resources are keys to busi-
ness success. 
I thank Chairwoman WATERS
for 
bringing this. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, according to a recent 
National Bureau of Economic Research 
report, the racial wealth gap is on 
track to grow wider in the coming dec-
ades. It is estimated that the White-to- 
Black wealth ratio will increase from 
5.6 to 1 in 2019 to 8.4 to 1 by 2200. 
The time to act is now. These amend-
ments will help ensure that everyone 
will have a fair chance, and in too 
many instances, a first chance at eco-
nomic opportunity. 
I thank our colleagues for offering 
their amendments, and I urge my col-
leagues to vote in support of these 
amendments 
because 
these 
amend-
ments are principally about trans-
parency. 
If you have nothing to hide, you cele-
brate transparency. If you have some-
thing to hide, you want to eschew 
transparency. 
These amendments seek to provide 
transparency so that we can get a bet-
ter understanding of how we can better 
cure the invidious discrimination that 
has plagued our country for centuries. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, let’s focus on the main 
thing. The main thing to the American 
people right now is what they see when 
they fill up their tank at the pumps 
and buy gas. It is what they see when 
they go to the grocery store. It is what 
they see in their daily lives. 
What they are seeing in their daily 
lives is inflation at a 40-year high. Here 
are fantastic examples that are hor-
rible, horrible things to see, but they 
are important that we see because this 
is what the American people are facing. 
Inflation is at a 40-year high. Food 
prices are up 10 percent, gas 50 percent, 
and shelter 5.5 percent from just last 
year. The American people will pay 
$5,200 more this year than they did last 
year for the same goods and services. 
This is a direct result of Democrats’ 
fiscal plans. It is a direct result of the 
Democrats’ economic strategy, and we 
are suffering the consequences from it. 
This bill, and the amendments that 
pass on the floor today, will do nothing 
to help struggling American families. 
Nothing. 
Instead, they will politicize the Fed, 
expand the CFPB’s authority, and 
make credit more expensive and harder 
to get. This is bad news. It is bad pol-
icy. It is a bad process. 
We should reject it. We should make 
sure this bill does not become law.

AMENDMENT NO. 24 OFFERED BY MR. TIMMONS 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
Strike title I, title II, title III, subtitle B 
of title IV, and subtitle B of title V. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1170, the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. GREEN) and the 
gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. 
MCHENRY) each will control 10 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Texas. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, the Republican amend-
ments presented here today stand as a 
testament to Republican values; name-
ly, a tolerance for wealth inequality 
and racial discrimination. 
Let’s be clear. The amendment from 
Mr. TIMMONS will strike large portions 
of the bill and make no attempt to im-
prove it. 
As for the amendment from Mr. 
DAVIS, it will strike provisions requir-
ing the reporting of small business 
lending 
data, 
effectively 
allowing 
banks to continue to hide the extent to 
which they are denying small business 
owners of color access to affordable 
credit. 
According to a Fed survey, 46 percent 
of Black-owned firms that applied for 
financing received none of the financ-
ing they sought compared to just 22 
percent of White-owned firms. We need 
more granular data on these trends to 
root out discrimination in lending once 
and for all. 
For these reasons, I urge my col-
leagues to oppose this amendment, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of the Republican en bloc, and 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
The amendments in this en bloc are 
where we should have started this de-
bate. These amendments would im-
prove the bill and provide real solu-
tions for the American people who are 
suffering under the weight of mis-
guided Democrat economic policies. 
In whole, this amendment package 
would make the bill bipartisan and 
give us a real chance to pass the Sen-
ate and become law. These amend-
ments would preserve the sections of 
the bill that Republicans supported 
during committee consideration, such 
as promoting new and diverse deposi-
tory institutions, improving corporate 
governance through diversity, ensuring 
diversity in community banking, ex-
panding opportunity for minority de-
pository institutions, and improving 
the CDFI Bond Guarantee Program. 
These are the bipartisan pieces of the 
bill. These five bills are the result of 
bipartisan discussions and compromise. 
They show that Congress is capable of 
working together and putting the 
American people first rather than real-
ly a far-left agenda that the rest of the 
bill is pushing. 
These bills collectively would help to 
identify and implement solutions to 
support small banks and credit unions 
in the communities they serve. 
Furthermore, this amendment en 
bloc would strike section 1071 of the 
Dodd-Frank Act which requires the 
Consumer Financial Protection Bu-
reau—which is an unaccountable agen-
cy, by the way—to issue a rule to force 
banks and credit unions to collect and 
report demographic data on small busi-
ness loan applications. 
We have seen what the CFPB can do 
under Director Chopra’s scorched-earth 
policies. This proposed rule will make 
small business lending more costly and 
difficult for financial institutions of all 
shapes and sizes. It will also choke off 
the very access to credit those small 
businesses need right now. 
So instead of limiting small business 
credit options and saddling them with 
unnecessary regulations, as the under-
lying bill does, we should focus on fos-
tering growth and help small busi-
nesses succeed. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this en bloc, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time, and I 
am prepared to close. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
In closing, I would just reiterate the 
amendments in this en bloc are how we 
should have started this debate and 
how we should have started this bill. 
These amendments would improve 
the bill and provide real solutions for 
American people who are suffering 
under the weight of misguided Demo-
crat policies. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ 
on this en bloc, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, what we have been wit-
nessing today is the behavior of per-
sons who chose not to help the Amer-
ican people in a time of need. 
When the American people were 
being evicted from their homes, they 
chose not to help. When schools were 
plagued by a virus and needed funding 
so that they could secure our children 
from the virus, they chose not to help. 
When people were out of work and 
needed help to put food on the table, 
fuel in their cars, they chose not to 
help. 
Because they chose not to help, they 
have to call any help that was given 
reckless, and they have to call it bad 
policy. 
But the truth is, if you do nothing, 
you put yourself in a position such that 
you cannot appreciate the suffering of 
people who are in the midst of a world-
wide pandemic. They chose not to help. 
We choose to help, and we continue to 
help. 
Mr. Speaker, it is a sad day when 
people will call saving homes and keep-
ing children safe from a virus reckless 
policy. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution Number 1170, 
the previous question is ordered on the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5584 
June 15, 2022 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Insert after section 524 the following: 
SEC. 525. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION. 
Nothing in this subtitle or the amend-
ments made by this subtitle may be con-
strued to prevent or otherwise impede the 
ability of insured depository institutions (as 
defined in section 3 of the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Act) to establish branches and 
provide banking services in underserved 
areas. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1170, the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. VICENTE GON-
ZALEZ) and a Member opposed each will 
control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Texas. 
Mr. VICENTE GONZALEZ of Texas. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. 
My amendment to H.R. 2543, the Fed-
eral Reserve Racial and Economic Eq-
uity Act, ensures no changes made by 
this 
bill 
will 
prohibit 
community 
banks from expanding into underserved 
areas as defined by the bill. 
Access to credit is a building block 
for aspiring entrepreneurs and small 
business owners and helps create jobs 
and boost local economic power and 
growth. 
My amendment helps increase bank-
ing opportunities in rural and under-
served areas, and I urge my colleagues 
to support it and the base legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I claim 
time in opposition, but I am not op-
posed to the amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the gentleman from North 
Carolina is recognized for 5 minutes. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I appre-
ciate Mr. GONZALEZ’s attempt to help 
community banks. I would say that 
this amendment really doesn’t do any-
thing substantive to the bill. It doesn’t 
help community banks compete and 
survive in the current regulatory envi-
ronment. 
In fact, if we were really serious 
about helping community banks, we 
would be looking at the Dodd-Frank 
Act and the additional regulatory bur-
dens in place on these financial institu-
tions, but we are not. This bill doesn’t 
do that. We would be looking at the 
regulatory burdens that Dodd-Frank 
keeps on institutions that keeps them 
from lending to their consumers, the 
compliance cost burdens that make ac-
cessing credit more difficult, especially 
for hard-to-reach communities. 
Last year, Democrats got rid of the 
true lender doctrine, which focused on 
providing legal certainty to banks and 
fintech partnerships. The true lender 
doctrine would have actually helped 
provide clarity and lower the cost and 
access to credit. It is these partner-
ships between fintechs and community 
banks that harness and scale tech-
nology and provide consumers with the 
financial products that they want and 
need, particularly in underserved com-
munities. 
If we are really serious about reach-
ing underserved communities—and I 
think we should be—we should restore 
the true lender doctrine and rightsize 
overly burdensome regulations on com-
munity banks. 
Those are the important points I 
would like to make in light of this 
amendment. I welcome a discussion 
about those issues. I think we have a 
lot of mutual concerns about the chal-
lenges the American people are facing, 
but I think it is important that we get 
to the big issues that are central in 
this economy, given the economic cir-
cumstances we are currently in as a re-
sult of Democrat policies, and we 
should be working to fix those big 
issues. 
While I am not opposed to the 
amendment—I think it is fine; I am not 
going to oppose it—I think it is impor-
tant that we highlight the big and es-
sential things we should be about. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. VICENTE GONZALEZ of Texas. 
Mr. Speaker, I have no further re-
marks. I am prepared to close, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
I just reiterate that this amendment 
really doesn’t do anything substantive. 
If we are serious about helping commu-
nity banks, rightsizing burdensome 
regulations would be the way to go, 
and reinstating the true lender doc-
trine would be a strong first step. 
There are bigger things that we should 
be doing to help these institutions. 
While I am not opposed to the 
amendment, I think we should be doing 
the big, substantive items that are im-
portant for us to have a competitive 
economic situation for working Ameri-
cans. We should be about these bigger 
items and focus on them. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. VICENTE GONZALEZ of Texas. 
Mr. Speaker, again I urge my col-
leagues to support this amendment and 
the chairwoman’s underlying bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1170, the pre-
vious 
question

the 
amendment offered by the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. VICENTE GONZALEZ).

offered by the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. VICENTE GONZALEZ).

ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution

AMENDMENT NO. 19 OFFERED BY MR. PAYNE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 19 
printed in part B of House Report 117– 
366. 
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I have an

Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows:

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1170, the gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr. PAYNE) 
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encour-
age everyone to support adding our bi-
partisan amendment, the text of the bi-
partisan Payment Choice Act, to the 
bill. 
Recently, the bill passed the Finan-
cial Services Committee on a bipar-
tisan 
vote. 
I 
thank 
Chairwoman 
WATERS for her work in helping to ad-
vance my legislation. I thank the gen-
tlewoman from Texas (Ms. GARCIA) and 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
SMITH) for their leadership and support 
of it. 
The Payment Choice Act guarantees 
that every consumer has the choice to 
pay cash for goods and services. Right 
now, there is an attack on American 
currency. Companies are trying to ban 
cash in their stores, but cash is simple, 
common, and anonymous. And it is the 
necessary form of payment for 55 mil-
lion Americans. That is right, 55 mil-
lion Americans in this country. 
The bill does not prohibit digital or 
other payments. Instead, it protects 
cash as a payment in this Nation, as it 
has been throughout our history. It 
protects Americans from being rejected 
from stores because they can only pay 
in cash. 
Several cities and States have en-
acted their own laws to protect the 
right to pay cash already. This bill 
would provide a single law to protect 
cash nationwide. More important, the 
bill would protect the privacy of Amer-
icans. There is no data collection with 
cash transactions. Cash is a private 
transaction. 
Customers should have the right to 
refuse to hand over their personal in-
formation for a simple purchase. It is 
not a partisan issue because Democrats 
and Republicans support this bill. 
Therefore, it is an American issue to 
protect American currency. I encour-
age all Members to support my amend-
ment. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I claim 
the time in opposition to this amend-
ment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from North Carolina is recog-
nized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, this 
amendment is a solution in search of a 
problem and provides a pathway for 
frivolous lawsuits in Federal court. 
Cash continues to be an important 
form of payment in many communities 
across America. However, businesses 
that have a substantial number of cus-
tomers who wish to transact in cash al-
ready accept cash. 
The amendment’s requirements will 
impact small business owners in par-
ticular, who will be required to accept 
cash payment whether or not it makes 
economic or business sense. 
Additionally, this amendment would 
give preferential treatment to ancil-
lary service providers that may be fac-
ing a downturn in demand for services 
due to an increasing electronic pay-
ment usage desire among consumers. 
Let’s look at the bill. Let me try to 
explain it. The bill would prohibit re-
tail businesses from refusing cash pay-
ments below $2,000. It would prohibit 
the retail business from charging a 
higher price to any customer who pays 
by cash than is customarily going to be 
charged for using other forms of pay-
ment. It provides a private right of ac-
tion—that means that they can sue—in 
Federal court for consumers who are 
aggrieved. 
The amendment provides exceptions 
to these prohibitions, including if the 
business provides a mechanism to con-
vert cash to prepaid cards. 
This is really the desire to force basi-
cally ATMs into retail establishments. 
That is the construct of the bill. So 
imagine you are a small business, and 
now under Federal law, you are re-
quired to take a $2,000 cash payment. 
That seems onerous. Imagine you are a 
small businessperson who is now going 
to be faced potentially with lawsuits in 
Federal court for a failure to provide 
an ATM machine in your establish-
ment. This seems quite onerous. 
We can get into the question of the 
soundness of a fully digitized world. 
There is a serious debate to be had 
here, and there is an economic inclu-
sion debate that is necessary for us to 
have. In a world of digital payments, 
not everyone is digital, so we have to 
make sure that we get to those key 
issues. 
But this bill is rather convoluted, 
and it provides a number of require-
ments for businesses that are not in 
keeping with trying to get at the ques-
tion of cash acceptance. I think we 
should have some serious discussions 
about cash acceptance, especially for 
our communities across America that 
are not online and don’t have credit 
cards or prepaid cards in their pocket. 
I think there are things we can still 
work on in this space. Unfortunately, 
this bill is too convoluted with too 
many mechanisms that would provide 
too many opportunities for new law-
suits, so I oppose it. I think it is impor-
tant that we oppose this amendment, 
as I did in committee. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5586 
June 15, 2022 
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I really ap-
preciate the gentleman’s wonderful 
summary of my bill up until the point 
where he raised the issue around pref-
erential businesses, such as ATMs. 
There is no preferential treatment for 
any industry in this bill. All retail 
transactions are treated the same. 
As the gentleman speaks on busi-
nesses being able to charge a higher 
price, I don’t know about North Caro-
lina, but in New Jersey, when I go to 
the gas station, there is a higher price 
charged for credit, not cash. So I think 
he kind of had that in reverse. 
Mr. Speaker, this is an opportunity 
for 55 million Americans who don’t 
have banking accounts or are under-
banked, to continue to be a part of this 
economy. There is a population in this 
country, believe it or not, who would 
rather not be in the banking system. 
b 1415 
I am just trying to protect the under-
served and the underbanked. I don’t 
know the makeup of the gentleman’s 
district in North Carolina, although I 
think his attire is splendid with the 
bowtie. But back in his district, I don’t 
know if they are affluent or not. I have 
some of the poorest Americans in my 
district, and they are reaching out to 
me saying: What do I do? 
What happens to the grandmother 
who lives in a two-flight walkup and 
the store that she uses is on the first 
floor? Mr. Speaker, now, this business 
decides that they are not going to ac-
cept her cash anymore. You are asking 
this woman to walk another three or 
four blocks to find someone, like a pau-
per: ‘‘Who will take my cash? Who will 
take my cash? Will you take my 
money? Will you take my cash?’’ 
‘‘No, no cash allowed here. Be gone.’’ 
That is what we are looking at. That 
is what we are trying to prevent. 
Mr. Speaker, I just say that we are 
here to fight for the underserved, the 
underbanked, and the unbanked. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, has the 
gentleman’s time fully expired? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman’s time has entirely expired. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I agree with the gen-
tleman from New Jersey. I agree with 
Mr. PAYNE on his choice of attire. I 
think the fact that two of us, who are 
very 
well 
dressed—appropriately 
dressed, I would say—are having a de-
bate and are on different sides of this 
issue is very unbecoming of the bowtie 
community. We stand together more 
closely than this. 
Mr. Speaker, I welcome my col-
league—the fact that he has an under-
taking in this arena to talk about the 
question of cash acceptance, I think, is 
important. 
There are a number of questions that 
I have raised about this bill that I 
think are important. The private right 
of action in Federal court is problem-
atic for us on this side of the aisle. The 
requirement to have a machine on 
site—on page 2 of the bill, it says the 
retail facility, or whatever the facility 
is, that is accepting payment, they 
have to provide customers with the 
means on the premises to convert cash 
into a card that is either a general-use 
prepaid card, a gift card, or an access 
device for electronic funds transfer. So 
it is a very specific requirement to 
have on premises. 
Imagine the same scenario of this 
nice lady that lives in his district, Mr. 
PAYNE’s district, who goes downstairs 
to purchase whatever, whether it is 
from a grocery store or whatever. Now, 
imagine they had an ATM that was two 
doors down. Under the construct of this 
bill, that wouldn’t be sufficient. 
There are important things to get at 
here. I oppose the amendment, but I 
welcome the debate. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1170, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendment offered by the gentleman 
from New Jersey (Mr. PAYNE). 
The question is on the amendment 
offered by the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. PAYNE). 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are 
postponed.

of everyday goods. 
Exacerbated by Putin’s invasion of 
Ukraine, grocery bills are climbing 
higher, gas costs more than $5 per gal-
lon, and tangled supply chains con-
tinue to fuel inflation. 
The 
American 
people 
are 
being 
pushed to the breaking point. The sta-
tus quo is simply unacceptable. 
This bill will provide relief to Ameri-
cans feeling the pain at the pump by 
boosting domestic biofuel production, 
and it will drive down costs at the gro-
cery store. 
Best of all, Democrats have worked 
hand-in-glove with our Republican col-
leagues to advance this bipartisan leg-
islation out of committee and onto the 
House floor. 
Madam Speaker, this legislation is a 
great step in the right direction, but 
we must do more. We must crack down 
on gas companies exploiting this crisis 
for profit. 
Like President Biden suggested, we 
must work with oil companies to ad-
dress supply and capacity shortages. 
Finally, if we don’t want to be back 
to this point ever again, we must accel-
erate our transition away from fossil 
fuels once and for all. The American 
people are counting on us.

GAS PRICES HAVE DOUBLED 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, gas 
prices have doubled under President 
Biden’s failed anti-American energy 
policies. But I don’t know which is 
worse, that the national average per 
gallon of gas is 5 bucks or that—in my 
home State of California, we would 
like to see 5 bucks once again. Prices 
are well over $7, thanks to decades’ 
worth of regulatory assault on Amer-
ican gas in California and now at the 
Washington level. 
While the American people are strug-
gling to keep up financially, the Sec-
retary of Energy and the Secretary of 
Transportation tell them to go buy 
electric vehicles. If American families 
are struggling to afford these out-
rageous gas prices, what makes these 
bureaucrats think that they can afford 
a brand-new $50,000 electric vehicle? 
Enough of this ‘‘let them eat cake’’ at-
titude. 
These gas prices weren’t caused by 
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. They 
were caused by regulatory assault on 
our energy industry and domestic pro-
duction being killed. 
President Biden, take responsibility 
for your failed energy policies. Stand 
down from your war on American en-
ergy, and unleash American energy 
independence and help our people for a 
change.

CELEBRATING 10TH ANNIVERSARY 
OF DACA 
(Mr. CA´ RDENAS asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. CA´ RDENAS. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in celebration of the 10th an-
niversary of DACA, the program that 
has protected nearly 1 million inspiring 
young people and given them the op-
portunity to contribute to our great 
economy. 
Dreamers are our family, friends, and 
neighbors. They are teachers, doctors 
and nurses, small business owners, 
servicemembers, and so much more. 
They work hard and contribute to 
our great economy. They make Amer-
ica a better place for everyone. Yet, 
they face unspeakable hardships and 
witness the ugliness of anti-immigrant 
sentiments in our great country. But 
their resilience has shined through all 
of that. 
Let me be clear. Today is an incred-
ible milestone, but another 10 years 
without permanent protections and a 
pathway to citizenship is simply un-
just. That is why I will continue to 
fight to give every single Dreamer that 
continues to live in our country perma-
nency, because in America, we believe 
that when given that shot at the Amer-
ican Dream, anything is possible.

RECOGNIZING ALZHEIMER’S AND 
BRAIN AWARENESS MONTH 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, June is Alzheimer’s 
and Brain Awareness Month. World-
wide, there are an estimated 47 million 
people living with Alzheimer’s and 
other dementias. Without a change, 
these numbers are expected to grow to 
76 million by the year 2030. 
Alzheimer’s is the sixth leading cause 
of death in the United States and is the 
only leading cause of death that cannot 
be prevented, cured, or even slowed. 
Sadly, one in three seniors will die 
with the disease. 
This disease took my mother’s life. 
Alzheimer’s has a devastating impact 
on those who are diagnosed with the 
disease and their caregivers and loved 
ones. More than 16 million Americans 
provide unpaid care to family and 
friends living with Alzheimer’s and 
other forms of dementia. 
Compared with caregivers for people 
without dementia, twice as many care-
givers for people with dementia indi-
cate substantial emotional, financial, 
and physical stress.

June 15, 2022 
Madam Speaker, the time to act is 
now. This month, let’s wear purple and 
help raise awareness and advance Alz-
heimer’s care. 
f 
SECURITY FOR ALL FEDERAL 
JUDGES 
(Mr. PAYNE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, yester-
day, I opposed the Supreme Court Po-
lice Parity Act. 
I fully support expanded security for 
Supreme Court Justices and their fami-
lies. I also firmly believe that those ex-
panded protections must apply to all 
Federal judges and their families—that 
is right, all Federal judges and their 
families—who face similar threats with 
less protective resources. 
The safety of our Federal judiciary is 
a very personal issue for New Jersey. 
Two years ago, the only child of U.S. 
District Judge Esther Salas was mur-
dered by a man who had previously ap-
peared before her court. 
This bill was an opportunity to im-
prove 
protections 
for 
all 
Federal 
judges. Sadly, the Senate abdicated its 
responsibility when it ignored calls for 
the inclusion of the Daniel Anderl Ju-
dicial Security and Privacy Act, intro-
duced by my colleague MIKIE SHERRILL 
and Senator MENENDEZ, in this bill. 
Democrats are committed, as is 
every member of the New Jersey dele-
gation, to ensuring that all Federal ju-
dicial officials and their families are 
safe.

PAYING TRIBUTE TO THE HONOR-
ABLE 
GRAYDON 
K. 
KITCHENS, 
JR. 
(Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life 
of the Honorable Graydon K. Kitchens, 
Jr., a giant of a man and my former 
law partner and mentor. 
Judges Kitchens’ list of accomplish-
ments is limitless. I could stand at this 
lectern for an hour listing off all of his 
accomplishments and barely scratch 
the surface. 
He was a husband of 62 years; father 
of three; proud grandfather of six; var-
sity pitcher at LSU, our alma mater; 
U.S. Army lieutenant; judge; chief jus-
tice; deacon; and a man of deep, pro-
found faith. 
He provided wise counsel through 
troubling times to me and to so many 
countless others, and he is an irre-
placeable senior statesman in the Lou-
isiana Bar. I am among so many to 
consider him to be truly one of the 
greatest men we have ever known. 
As the patriarch of his family, Judge 
Kitchens planted roots in north Lou-
isiana that will flourish for centuries. 
Our community lost a towering char-
acter and a leader, and we are so much 
better for the time that we had when 
he was here. 
Our prayers are with Roberta and the 
entire Kitchens family and all who 
loved him. 
Rest in peace, Judge Kitchens. God 
bless. 
f 
SUPPORTING ALZHEIMER’S AND 
BRAIN AWARENESS MONTH 
(Ms. BARRAGA´ N asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. BARRAGA´ N. Madam Speaker, I 
rise 
today 
in 
recognition 
of 
Alz-
heimer’s and Brain Awareness Month. I 
am wearing purple in support of the 
millions of Americans, including my 
mom, who are living with Alzheimer’s 
disease. 
The nearly 6 million people with Alz-
heimer’s are our sisters, our brothers, 
our parents, our grandparents, and our 
neighbors—our 
fellow 
Americans. 
Many are suffering in silence because 
there is so much stigma around having 
Alzheimer’s. 
I want every patient, family member, 
and caregiver to know that you mat-
ter. Your quality of life matters. Know 
that you have a champion in Congress 
who knows how hard it is for family 
and caregivers. 
That is why I will continue to push 
for more investments in Alzheimer’s 
research and care and will continue to 
fight so CMS provides equitable access 
to promising Alzheimer’s drugs. 
Our fight against this devastating 
disease is nowhere near done. 
f 
REMEMBERING GUS MACHADO 
(Ms. SALAZAR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. 
SALAZAR. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
today, I rise to honor a titan of Miami, 
Mr. Gus Machado, who passed away 
last month. 
Gus is remembered for his iconic 
leadership as a pioneering marketer 
and owner of car dealerships around 
Miami. Ford Motor Company recog-
nized his leadership by honoring Mr. 
Machado with the President’s Award in 
2003, 2009, and 2010. 
He was a founder of the United 
States-Cuba Democracy PAC, but his 
real legacy will be his heart of service. 
In 2008, he created the Gus Machado 
Family Foundation, and every school 
year, the foundation provides more 
than 400 children with backpacks full 
of school supplies. Another impressive 
example of his generosity was his $5 
million donation to St. Thomas Uni-
versity to establish a business school. 
He was one of the best the Cuban- 
American exile community in Miami 
has produced. I am proud to stand on 
the floor of the United States House to 
pay tribute to Mr. Machado. His life 
was an example of faith, hard work, de-
termination, family, friends, and a 
good community. In other words, he 
was the best example of the American 
Dream. 
Rest in peace. 
f 
DACA FALLS SHORT FOR 
DREAMERS 
(Mr. VARGAS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. VARGAS. Madam Speaker, thou-
sands of young people brought to the 
U.S. at a young age fought for and have 
benefited from DACA. This gave recipi-
ents and their families a little peace 
and resulted in economic gains for our 
country, but the program falls short of 
a pathway to citizenship. 
DACA was a significant achievement 
for many immigrants, but it is by no 
means a substitute for fixing our bro-
ken immigration system. 
Since its inception, DACA has been 
under attack by far-right politicians. 
The reality is that DACA has gone 
back and forth in the courts, leaving 
DACA recipients and DACA-eligible 
youth in a state of limbo. This contin-
ued legal threat leaves the lives of 
DACA recipients, DACA-eligible youth, 
and their families in uncertainty and 
dread. 
Congress introduced and passed H.R. 
6, the Dream and Promise Act, more 
than a year ago, but it is stuck in the 
Senate. We must end the filibuster and 
pass a real solution for the millions of 
people who call the U.S. home. 
f 
HONORING KATHY O’NAN 
(Mr. COMER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to honor the mayor of Mayfield, Kathy 
O’Nan, for all she has done for her com-
munity in the wake of last December’s 
tornado damage. 
In a nod to her recovery efforts, 
Mayor O’Nan was recently 
named 
Woman of the Year by the Mayfield- 
Graves County Chamber of Commerce. 
I can think of no one more deserving of 
this high honor. 
When the storms hit, the mayor led 
by example in getting her community 
back on its feet. She was there for her 
citizens when they needed her the 
most, and she continues to work tire-
lessly to bring all parties together to 
rebuild 
the 
proud 
community 
of 
Mayfield. 
A role model to many, she has em-
bodied servant leadership during her 
time in office, a tenure largely defined 
by persevering through tragedy. 
When the eyes of the world were on 
Mayfield, 
Kentucky, 
Mayor 
O’Nan 
stepped up to the plate and delivered 
the leadership and empathy that west 
Kentucky needed. I am proud to rep-
resent her in Congress, and I look for-
ward to working with her as Graves 
County rebuilds.

CELEBRATING THE GOOD HOUND 
(Mr. AUCHINCLOSS asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. AUCHINCLOSS. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate Pride Month 
by recognizing an LGBTQ-owned local 
business, The Good Hound. 
The Good Hound offers off-leash 
hikes, pet sitting, training, and social-
ization in my hometown of Newton. I 
first met owner Shannon Wood when 
my dog, Donut, joined the group of 
dogs he helps take care of every day. 
Every June, we look forward to seeing 
Donut and all her friends sport pride 
bandanas as they join Haley for jaunts 
around our neighborhood. 
Pride Month is a time to celebrate 
the LGBTQ individuals we all know 
and love who are crucial parts of our 
communities, economy, and families. 
Congress must stand up and support 
small, LGBTQ-owned businesses across 
the country that serve our constituents 
every day. My family and Newton as a 
whole are better for the dedication, 
cheer, and openness Shannon brings to 
The Good Hound. 
f 
INFLATION 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
want to give a story to my good friends 
in the press corps because they always 
feel they have a shortage of interesting 
things in the paper. This concerns the 
excessive inflation we have under the 
current administration. 
The current administration claims 
that inflation last year was 8.6 percent. 
I am going to focus on two different 
parts of that, one is 5.5 percent for 
housing and 16.1 percent for used cars. 
I ask the press corps to call some 
local builders or builders anywhere 
around the country—builders, land-
lords, and assessors—and see if you can 
find anybody who thinks the cost of 
housing has only gone up by 5.5 percent 
in the past year. My goodness, the cost 
of interest by itself has almost doubled 
in that time. The cost of many parts of 
a house has gone up. There is no way 
that it is only 5.5 percent. I think if 
you look around and ask builders and 
Realtors, they will laugh at that num-
ber. 
I would also ask you to call some car 
dealers around the country and see 
what they think about the idea that 
used cars have gone up 16.1 percent in 
the last year. They, as well, laugh at 
that. The number has to be signifi-
cantly higher. 
So there is a gift to my friends in the 
news business. 
f 
CELEBRATING JUNETEENTH 
(Ms. PRESSLEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Speaker, my 
family 
and 
I 
have 
celebrated 
Juneteenth for decades, but this year 
marks only the second year that 
Juneteenth will be observed as a Fed-
eral holiday. 
Some may wonder what is the signifi-
cance of this day and why is national 
recognition long overdue and notable? 
It matters, because as we celebrate 
Juneteenth—the emancipation of my 
enslaved ancestors—it is a truth-tell-
ing reminder of our Nation’s history 
and founding, but also of what is pos-
sible. 
When enslaved Black people and al-
lies began the work of abolition, many 
considered the goal of freedom an im-
probable or impossible one, but because 
of their imaginations and sacrifice it 
did happen. 
While we recognize that our fight for 
equity and justice continues today, on 
this day, we celebrate the Black fam-
ily, our culture, our melanin, our resil-
ience, our brilliance, and our joy. We 
affirm our humanity. We are more than 
hashtags, sobering statistics, deficits, 
disparities, and gaps. We are more than 
our labor, the resistance, and justice- 
seekers. 
From the heart of Texas to kitchen 
tables in Roxbury, we celebrate the 
dedicated coalition of Black folks who 
organize to make this celebration a 
Federal holiday. 
Black lives matter. Black healing 
matters. Black joy matters. Happy 
Juneteenth.

HONORING JEFFREY SHERWIN 
(Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois asked and 
was given permission to address the

Mr. 
GARCI´A 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Mayor 
Jeffrey 
Sherwin 
of 
the 
city 
of 
Northlake, Illinois for 25 years of serv-
ice to that city. 
Mayor Sherwin, a lifelong resident of 
Northlake and Leyden Eagle, has dedi-
cated his life to public service. 
Prior to becoming mayor in 1997, he 
served as trustee for Northlake Public 
Library and Northlake Fire Protection 
District. 
As mayor, he has worked tirelessly 
to transform the community by put-
ting education, housing, infrastruc-
ture, and protecting the environment 
at the forefront of his effort. 
Mayor Sherwin built senior housing, 
established many new green and rec-
reational spaces, and restored wet-
lands. 
In celebration of 25 years of service, 
today, we thank Mayor Jeffrey Sher-
win for his career of service.

HELP FEED OUR KIDS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentlewoman from 
Minnesota (Ms. OMAR) is recognized for 
60 minutes as the designee of the ma-
jority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. OMAR. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude any extraneous material on the 
subject of this Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Minnesota? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. OMAR. Madam Speaker, we are 
on the brink of a hunger crisis, both 
here in the United States and around 
the globe. Right now, more than 38 mil-
lion people, including 12 million chil-
dren, are food insecure in the United 
States. 
Food prices are expected to rise up to 
7.5 percent this year, stretching al-
ready tight family budgets. 
In my home State of Minnesota, doz-
ens of hunger relief organizations are 
warning of the hungriest summer on 
record if the State doesn’t convene a 
special session to combat hunger. 
At the beginning of the pandemic, I 
passed the MEALS Act to let districts 
provide universal meals in the hope of 
preventing a massive hunger crisis. It 
worked. Over 30 million kids are now 
estimated to receive school meals. 
In August 2020, when the waivers 
were on the verge of expiring, Rep-
resentative PINGREE and I joined 119 of 
our colleagues in sending a letter to 
the Secretary of Agriculture urging 
him to extend the school meal waivers. 
Throughout the pandemic, I sent 
three letters and worked tirelessly to 
ensure every child can eat. Though we 
were able to secure these critical waiv-
er extensions, the uncertainty cost 
millions of families and school admin-
istrators to panic and stress. 
Now, we find ourselves in a familiar 
place where at the end of this month— 
in just 15 days—millions of children are 
again at risk of going hungry as the 
school meal waivers are set to expire. 
Let me be clear: We cannot let these 
lifesaving waivers lapse as the pan-
demic rages on. I am working with the 
Education and Labor Committee and 
leadership to ensure that our children 
are continuing to be fed. 
But we can’t stop there. We need per-
manent solutions. As a former commu-
nity nutrition educator, childhood hun-
ger is an issue I know all too well. That 
is why one of the first bills I intro-
duced after I was sworn in was the Uni-
versal School Meals Program Act with 
Senators Sanders and Gillibrand. 
My bill would provide free breakfast, 
lunch, and dinner to every student and 
eliminate school meal debt. No child in 
the wealthiest country in the world 
should experience food insecurity. We 
here in the United States must lead to 
end child hunger here at home and we 
must continue to lead to stop this glob-
al hunger crisis. 
Every night up to 811 million people 
around the globe go to bed hungry. Of 
the 811 million, 276 million people are 
facing acute food insecurity and about 
50 million people are facing what the 
U.N. World Food Programme describes 
as ‘‘emergency levels of hunger.’’ 
While the United States has provided 
$2.6 billion to help other countries with

food shortages, we need other countries 
to step up and do their part. With 49 
million people around the world on the 
verge of famine, we need to rally all 
leaders to increase the supply of food 
and fertilizers; support basic safety 
nets for those without food; and fund 
humanitarian 
operations 
to 
reduce 
famine and hunger. 
We have to remember what got us to 
this point: Putin’s illegal invasion of 
Ukraine has disrupted exports from 
two of the world’s biggest wheat pro-
ducers making wheat unaffordable and 
unattainable for millions. 
Right now, India, Argentina, Aus-
tralia, and Canada collectively have 
the power to make up for most of the 
wheat lost due to the war or the re-
strictions that are being created by 
some other countries. That is why we 
need countries around the world to 
step up and do their part to combat the 
wheat shortage, which is especially 
being felt in the Horn of Africa. 
The U.N. has warned about the immi-
nent ‘‘explosion of child deaths’’ due to 
food insecurity and malnutrition in the 
Horn of Africa. In Somalia, 29 percent 
of children are experiencing acute mal-
nutrition. About 7 million livestock in 
Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia have 
died since last fall due to widespread 
drought. 
This food crisis in the Horn of Africa 
and all parts of the globe will only get 
worse unless we take steps to stop this 
catastrophe from taking hold. 
We have to act to address the nexus 
of inflation, war, and climate change. 
Now is the time to act. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
New 
Mexico 
(Ms. 
STANSBURY). 
Ms. STANSBURY. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to urge this body to pass ur-
gent legislation to help feed our chil-
dren. 
If we do not act, millions of children 
across the United States and across 
New Mexico will lose access to vital 
school meals—breakfast and lunches 
that are helping to address an epidemic 
of food insecurity that is impacting 
every single corner of our State and 
our country. 
Food insecurity has many faces. Like 
so many children from New Mexico, I 
was a school lunch kid. I qualified for 
100 percent free and reduced-price 
lunch throughout my entire childhood. 
In fact, one in four children in New 
Mexico are facing food insecurity and 
hunger, and for many of these kids, 
school meals are the only reliable meal 
of the day. 
In New Mexico food is the center of 
our cultures, of our families, of our 
ways of life, and yet, so many of our 
families are struggling every single 
day to put food on the table. 
For every family food insecurity 
looks different. It may mean skipping 
meals, not being able to buy groceries 
every week, relying on school lunches 
in order to feed children, and getting 
help from a local food pantry and a 
local food bank. 
In many cases, we know the pan-
demic has caused our families to strug-
gle even more, made the situation 
worse, intensified food and hunger inse-
curity across our Nation, and that is 
why the work of this body here in Con-
gress to expand funding for nutrition 
programs to extend these waivers and 
include school meals for every child in 
America is quite literally a lifeline for 
our families and for our children. 
If Congress, and especially the Sen-
ate, do not act, millions of children 
across America will actually lose ac-
cess to school meals that have carried 
them 
through 
the 
pandemic. 
This 
comes as our Nation is grappling with 
disruptions to supply chains, inflation, 
rising costs, and putting stresses on 
families across our country. 
In exactly one month—days from 
now—our country will be facing a hun-
ger cliff as Federal waivers for school 
meals are set to expire and children 
will lose access to 95 million meals 
across the country this summer. 
I have worked on food and hunger 
issues across my entire public policy 
career. In New Mexico, we are working 
every day to reimagine our food sys-
tems, to lift up our State’s diverse and 
crucial food and agriculture traditions 
and support our families who are strug-
gling. 
As a State legislator, I was deeply 
proud to partner with our Governor 
and my colleagues in the State house 
and hunger advocates and agricultural 
entities across the State to address 
food insecurity and to pass a bill to end 
school meal copays. 
Here in Congress, I am proud to con-
tinue this work alongside antihunger 
champions 
like 
yourself, 
Madam 
Speaker, and as part of the Hunger 
Caucus led by Chairman MCGOVERN. 
I am also proud to cosponsor H.R. 
3115, the Universal School Meals Pro-
gram Act, which would address this 
crisis permanently by providing three 
locally sourced meals a day to every 
school child in America. 
The time to act is now. Our kids are 
counting on us. During the pandemic, 
Congress made a game-changing deci-
sion—to feed all children without bar-
riers, without bureaucratic obstacles. 
This is about the dignity and well- 
being of our families and meeting the 
most basic needs of our children. 
We have the opportunity to chart a 
new path forward for our country. Will 
we decide to be a nation that lets our 
kids go hungry or will we decide to be 
a nation where no child should ever 
have to experience food insecurity 
again? 
This is the choice facing this body, 
and this, Madam Speaker, is why we 
must extend school meals.

Ms. OMAR. Madam Speaker, I yield 
to the gentlewoman from North Caro-
lina (Ms. ADAMS). 
Ms. 
ADAMS. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding 
and her great work. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to ad-
dress the hunger crisis in our commu-
nities and in our schools. 
Millions of children will go hungry 
on June 30, just 2 weeks from now, if 
we fail to act. Let me say that again 
for anyone who may not have heard 
me. Millions of children will go hungry 
on June 30 if we do not act. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD an article from the Charlotte 
Observer outlining how the children in 
my district will be affected. 
NO MORE FREE LUNCH FOR SOME CMS 
STUDENTS STARTING NEXT YEAR 
(By Anna Maria Della Costa) 
A program that has provided free meals to 
K–12 
students 
in 
Charlotte-Mecklenburg 
Schools will stop at the end of this school 
year. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s uni-
versally free school meals arose out of pan-
demic-era waivers that allowed all K–12 stu-
dents to get school breakfast and lunch at no 
cost regardless of their family’s income be-
ginning in March 2020. Those waivers are set 
to expire June 30, despite school nutrition 
advocates urging Congress for an extension 
in the federal 2022 spending bill. 
School meal programs will return to pre- 
pandemic procedures for the 2022–23 school 
year, which means free breakfast continues 
and lunch may not. 
‘‘I just want to remind everybody. it’s the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture that this 
falls under, this is not the CMS Board of 
Education trying to give everybody a tough 
time on free and reduced lunch,’’ Interim Su-
perintendent Hugh Hattabaugh said during 
the board’s meeting Tuesday. ‘‘We were 
hopeful that maybe the bill that was set for-
ward would be approved, but it was not ex-
tended out.’’ 
IN CMS, BREAKFAST WILL STILL BE FREE FOR 
ALL STUDENTS 
Cassie Fambro, a media relations spe-
cialist with CMS, told the Observer that 
breakfast will continue to be provided in all 
of the district’s schools at no charge for the 
2022–23 school year. For each of CMS’ sum-
mer camps and programs, free breakfast and 
lunch also will be provided. 
CMS will not raise lunch meal prices for 
2022–23, keeping them at pre-pandemic rates 
for students. For pre-K students, the lunch 
meal price is $2.50; K–8 students pay $2.75 and 
9–12 students pay $3. The reduced price lunch 
meal is 40 cents. 
PARENTS: FILL OUT THE PAPERWORK 
Students attending some CMS schools will 
have to qualify for free or reduced-price 
lunch through direct certification, which 
could include families receiving food stamps, 
students who are homeless or foster children. 
Students can also receive free meals from an 
approved free or reduced-price meal benefit 
application. 
Students not approved for free lunch will 
need to have cash or money on account to 
pay for lunch. Fambro said. 
Applications will be available online or on 
paper beginning August 1. 
‘‘We’re not going to let any child walk 
away without a meal.’’ Hattabaugh said. 
‘‘We need help from parents and the commu-
nity to assist everybody.’’ 
Board member Margaret Marshall said it’s 
concerning that the waiver is not going to be 
extended. 
‘‘We’re going to have a lot of families who 
if they don’t qualify and fill out paperwork 
are going to have some problems with food 
this year,’’ Marshall said. ‘‘Make sure fami-
lies fill out the paperwork so we can have

the funds to feed those students and they 
won’t rack up meal debt which has to come 
due at some point. This is really important.’’ 
68 CMS SCHOOLS NOT AFFECTED 
CMS has 68 schools that fall into the Com-
munity Eligibility Provision, an option for 
schools and districts in low-income areas. 
The program allows schools to serve meals 
at no charge to all enrolled students, and 
families do not have to fill out an applica-
tion. 
Hattabaugh said these schools will not be 
affected by the change in meal service. 
‘‘They will still have what they had during 
the pandemic.’’ he said.

munity Eligibility Provision:

Ms. ADAMS. Madam Speaker, at the 
beginning of the pandemic, this body 
authorized waivers to help make it 
easier for schools to offer meals to 
kids, and we gave access to healthy, 
nutritious foods to 10 million more 
school-age children because finding re-
liable food sources became a problem. 
In case my Republican friends need a 
reminder, President Trump signed that 
legislation into law. Even as the pan-
demic continues and food prices are on 
the rise, these waivers are set to expire 
at the end of the month. 
As a 40-year educator, I know that 
hunger has been a crisis in our schools 
and our communities since long before 
the pandemic. That is also why when I 
came to Congress, I founded the Adams 
Hunger Initiative to help coordinate 
the response to the hunger crisis in my 
community, and why hunger has been 
one of my top priority issues in Con-
gress. 
In my home State of North Carolina, 
food insecurity has been a tragic fact 
of life for our kids and our students. In 
fact, I just heard from members of the 
North Carolina PTA today about their 
ever-present concerns about food inse-
curity and how it will impact our stu-
dents. 
In 2018, 441,000 North Carolina chil-
dren participated in SNAP, and 207,351 
residents participated in the Women, 
Infants, and Children program, or WIC. 
In 2019, 92,010 students participated in 
the summer food service program. Al-
most 100,000 students needed help from 
their school, so they didn’t go hungry— 
again, that was before the pandemic. 
In Charlotte, the hunger crisis led at 
least 24 elementary, middle, and high 
schools in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg 
School District to open food pantries 
to serve students in need during sum-
mer breaks and the vacation. 
For example, at Windsor Park Ele-
mentary in east Charlotte, members of 
the Windsor Park Neighborhood Asso-
ciation donated food to keep the 
shelves stocked for scores of food-inse-
cure and housing-insecure children. 
In west Charlotte, University Park 
Creative Arts School is restocked on a 
regular basis by Friendship Missionary 
Baptist Church, and thanks to local do-
nors it has a refrigerator and a large 
freezer to offer diverse options for stu-
dents and families. The need is real, 
and it is staring us in the face. 
It is also important to note that 
these two schools, along with 66 other 
local schools that will fall into the 
Community Eligibility Provision, will 
still be able to offer meals and food to 
students at the same levels of service 
as the past 2 years. 
However, approximately 114 of our 
district’s schools are not eligible for 
that provision, meaning that access to 
summer nutrition will become a patch-
work. When students return at the end 
of the summer, fewer students will get 
the meals that they need. 
Our choice is clear: we can choose to 
act, or we can let millions of children 
go hungry. As always, I am standing 
with our students. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Congress-
woman OMAR
and the Congressional 
Progressive Caucus for hosting this im-
portant Special Order hour tonight. 
Ms. OMAR. Madam Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from Massachusetts 
(Mr. MCGOVERN), who also chairs the 
Caucus on Hunger. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend from Minnesota, Con-
gresswoman OMAR, for leading this 
Special Order hour, at such a critical 
time for our Nation’s children. 
Congresswoman OMAR
has been a 
champion for expanding access to uni-
versal school meals and ending child-
hood hunger, and indeed, all hunger in 
this country and around the globe, and 
I recognize her for her leadership. 
Madam Speaker, my two sisters are 
schoolteachers in the Worcester public 
school system in Massachusetts. They 
remind me all the time that school 
meals are as important to a child’s 
ability to learn as a textbook or a 
laptop. They wonder all the time why 
Congress, State governments, and the 
Federal Government don’t get that. 
They see children show up to school 
on 
Mondays 
hungry 
because 
they 
haven’t eaten all weekend. It takes a 
while to get them the nutrition that 
they need so they can focus again. If 
you are hungry, you can’t focus. If you 
can’t focus, you can’t learn. If you 
can’t learn, you fall behind. It is that 
simple. 
They also tell me that Fridays are a 
tough day because those same children 
come to them and ask if there is any 
food that they can take home, not just 
for them but for their families. I have 
heard heartbreaking story after heart-
breaking story of children who are food 
insecure, who are hungry in this coun-
try. 
If you ever meet a child or see a child 
who is hungry, it breaks your heart. It, 
quite frankly, angers me because we 
live in the richest country in the his-
tory of the world. Even before the pan-
demic, close to 40 million Americans 
didn’t know where their next meal was 
going to come from. 
I tell people all the time that hunger 
is a political condition. It is not a par-
tisan condition. It shouldn’t be a par-
tisan condition. It is a political condi-
tion. By that I mean we have the food, 
we have the resources, we have the in-
frastructure, we have the knowledge of 
what we need to do. We have every-
thing but the political will. 
As has been pointed out here today, 
we are about to reach a hunger cliff at 
the end of June. Waivers are going to 
run out. Money is going to run out. If 
we don’t do something, millions and 
millions of children will lose their 
school meals and will lose their sum-
mer meals as well. 
During the pandemic, thankfully, 
schools received flexibility and funding 
to make sure their students got a 
healthy breakfast and lunch at school. 
This has been a lifeline for families and 
school districts facing rising costs and 
supply chain shortages. 
We are coming to an end. All those 
safety measures that were put in place 
during the pandemic will expire. I 
think what we are coming to appre-
ciate is that those safety measures 
should have been in place even if there 
wasn’t a pandemic. We can’t go back to 
the days when close to 13 million kids 
went to bed hungry every night in the 
country. 
With the group of leaders who are 
here on the floor, members of the Pro-
gressive Caucus, as well as working 
with Speaker PELOSI, Chairman BOBBY 
SCOTT, Chairwoman ROSA
DELAURO, 
and working with Chairwoman STABE-
NOW over in the Senate, we have been 
trying to figure out ways to extend the 
flexibility and funding needed to get 
healthy food to America’s students. 
I believe that we will get there. The 
amazing leadership of Speaker PELOSI 
will get us all together and we will find 
a way forward. We will avoid this hun-
ger cliff.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5596 
June 15, 2022 
Madam Speaker, I am a liberal Dem-
ocrat. I serve in this Congress, both in 
the House and Senate, with many con-
servative Republicans, and I under-
stand that not everybody agrees on ev-
erything here. For example, I want free 
universal school meals for every kid to 
be part of our educational policy, and I 
want it there forever. I commend 
States like California, Vermont, and 
Maine for taking a lead in their States. 
Their legislatures have passed uni-
versal meals for their students. I want 
Massachusetts to follow. I want every 
State to follow. 
I get it. Not everybody shares my 
view. I also get that in order to get 
anything to the President’s desk we 
are going to have to navigate through 
the Senate, which is always a challenge 
because in the Senate you need 60 votes 
to have a cup of coffee, never mind pass 
a piece of legislation. 
We are going to have to figure out 
what it is we can get done in the next 
couple of weeks. There are some who 
don’t want as big a package as others. 
There are some who are insisting on 
offsets. There are some who are insist-
ing on other things. We have to figure 
it out. We are going to have figure it 
out because our kids are important. 
They are 100 percent of our future, and 
we ought to treat them as such. 
Finally, one last point. America used 
to think big about solving problems 
like hunger. In 1969, we held the first 
and only White House Conference on 
Hunger. It was the same year we land-
ed on the moon. That conference led to 
a major expansion of the school lunch 
program 
and 
the 
creation 
of 
the 
Women, Infants, and Children program, 
among other things. 
As a proud member of the Progres-
sive Caucus, I have long thought that 
it is time for America to think big once 
again to solve problems like hunger. To 
think big the way we used to, not to 
manage problems, but to solve them. 
We have the food to end child hunger in 
America. 
Again, it is a matter of building the 
political will. I personally believe that 
food ought to be a fundamental human 
right here in this country and around 
the world. I say this because I am 
thrilled that President Biden recently 
announced that he will host a White 
House Conference on Hunger, Nutri-
tion, and Health to bring together ex-
perts from across the country, and all 
agencies within the Federal Govern-
ment to create a plan, not to manage 
hunger in America, to end hunger in 
America. 
It will be an opportunity for people 
with lived experiences to have their 
voices heard because sometimes we 
make decisions here and we don’t talk 
to the people who are most affected by 
what we are trying to do. 
We have the opportunity to prevent 
child hunger and to make universal 
free school meals a reality. This is our 
moment to make it happen. In the 
lead-up to this conference, Members of 
Congress have the opportunity to host 
listening sessions to hear directly from 
local educators and families who ben-
efit from free school meals. 
I encourage my colleagues to host 
these sessions and to transmit their 
findings to the White House so that the 
recommendations that come out of this 
conference reflect the power of school 
meals to change lives and improve nu-
trition among children. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage not just 
progressive Members, I encourage mod-
erate Members, and conservative Mem-
bers to do listening sessions in their 
districts to hear about not only the ex-
tent of this problem, which is a costly 
problem, but hear about potential solu-
tions so we can end hunger. If you are 
interested, you can reach out to my of-
fice, and we can point you in the right 
direction. 
Madam Speaker, I, again, thank Con-
gresswoman OMAR for bringing us to-
gether at such a critical moment. 
There are some problems that we are 
faced with that I don’t know what the 
solution is, but hunger is not one of 
them. This is a solvable problem that 
we can solve in a matter of a few years 
if we put our minds to it and if we work 
together. 
Let’s do something big, something 
bold, something that will reflect the 
goodness of the people of this country 
and make a real difference. It may be 
an example for the rest of the world. 
b 1645 
Ms. OMAR. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the chairman for his remarks. 
The chairman is right that when we 
invest in our children, who are assets 
to our future, it pays dividends. It is 
important that we recognize that it 
shouldn’t be a partisan issue to want to 
feed the bellies of our children before 
we try to feed their brains. We know 
from study after study that kids do 
better in school when they are fed. 
When they have adequate nutrition, 
they show up to school much more 
ready to learn, and their behavior in 
itself is much different. 
Example after example, we found, as 
we looked into this, schoolwide free 
meals improve math performance in 
districts where relatively few students 
qualify under the income-based pro-
grams Brookings found. A study found 
that students in schools with universal 
school meals fare better on tests than 
their peers without these meals. That 
is according to Maxwell School of Citi-
zenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse 
University. 
The nutrition quality of school meals 
has improved. Students with universal 
school meal programs are being offered 
more fruits, vegetables, and whole 
grains. That means that they are get-
ting the nutrients that will help with 
their development. New York City, 
where there have been universal school 
meals, a study found that regardless of 
poverty status, the universal school 
meals program improved students’ per-
ception of bullying, fighting, and safe-
ty at their schools. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. BOWMAN). 
Mr. BOWMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Congresswoman OMAR for con-
tinuing to be a champion on this issue, 
and I thank the Congresswoman for 
being here this evening. 
As it was said before, we are the 
wealthiest nation on Earth. We should 
be able to feed every child and every 
person, period, point-blank. We have 
the resources—financial, natural, and 
intellectual—to help feed every child 
on the planet. The fact that we are 
choosing not to do so is a policy choice. 
It is not a choice based on a lack of re-
sources. 
As we focus on school lunches and 
children in our schools, we often talk 
about education. The conversation that 
has been happening over the last sev-
eral decades is a conversation that fo-
cuses on something called the achieve-
ment gap. 
We often look at the achievement 
gap through the lens of race. We say 
that Black and Latino students are 
outperformed by their White and Asian 
counterparts. What we don’t often talk 
about is the achievement gap through 
the lens of economic distress and pov-
erty. 
What we know is children who suffer 
from poverty and live in poverty do 
more poorly in school than their mid-
dle-class and upper-middle-class coun-
terparts. Poverty is obviously related 
to food insecurity and hunger. 
Poverty and everything that comes 
with it is a complex trauma. Hunger is 
also a complex trauma. Children will 
not thrive in a school setting if we con-
tinue to allow them to be hungry. 
This is not just about their academic 
performance. This is about their phys-
ical development. This is also about 
their social and emotional develop-
ment as well. It is also about their 
mental health both in school and out of 
school. 
This is not something that is only 
confined 
to 
what 
happens 
in 
our 
schools. We have to look at, consider, 
and think about what happens in their 
post-graduation environment. Children 
who are hungry and children who suffer 
from the complex traumas that I men-
tioned before will have lower or less 
positive health and economic outcomes 
over the course of their lives. 
It is our duty and responsibility as 
the United States Government, with 
the power of the purse and the power of 
the intellectual and natural resources, 
to 
make 
sure 
we 
have 
preschool 
lunches in our schools and to make 
sure our children are fed. 
I also want to mention a few other 
components that take place in schools 
that we don’t often talk about as it re-
lates to school lunches, poverty, and 
hunger. When we look at the school-to- 
prison pipeline, when we look at school 
suspensions, and when we look at 
school expulsions, when we look at 
these things, when we look at who is 
placed in special education, these are 
children who come from challenging

circumstances rooted in poverty and 
also rooted in hunger and the trauma 
in their communities and in their 
homes. 
Again, it is our duty and responsi-
bility to get this done. To use language 
used by some of my more conservative 
colleagues, this is a national security 
issue because if we are not feeding our 
children, then we are not educating our 
children. If we are not educating our 
children, then we do not have a healthy 
society and we do not have a healthy 
democracy. 
The well-being of our children is a 
pillar of our country going forward, 
and in order for them to receive the 
nourishment and education that they 
need, we must make sure they are fed 
and fed well and are not food insecure. 
Ms. OMAR. Madam Speaker, I yield 
to the gentlewoman from Massachu-
setts (Ms. PRESSLEY). 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Representative OMAR for bring-
ing us together this afternoon and for 
her steadfast leadership on the issue of 
hunger and food insecurity, an issue 
that she has been leading on since she 
was in the Minnesota State Legisla-
ture. We are grateful for her shining a 
light consistently on this and the need 
for us to address rising hunger and its 
impact 
on 
communities 
here 
and 
around the globe. 
Madam Speaker, across Massachu-
setts’ Seventh District and across the 
Nation, families are facing unprece-
dented levels of food insecurity. I am 
reminded of the words of Coretta Scott 
King, who said: ‘‘Starving a child is vi-
olence. Neglecting schoolchildren is vi-
olence.’’ 
We can, in fact, do something about 
this violence. 
I am picking up on the words of Con-
gressman MCGOVERN, a global cham-
pion in the fight against hunger and 
food insecurity, when he said that we 
should stop managing problems and 
solve them. This is a solvable problem. 
A recent survey by the Greater Bos-
ton Food Bank found that nearly 2 mil-
lion adults across the Commonwealth 
struggled to get enough to eat last 
year. It was Black, Latinx, and LGBTQ 
people and their families with children 
who were most likely to struggle. 
No one should know hunger. No par-
ent should know the heartache of put-
ting their baby to sleep with an empty 
belly. 
Our communities were already in the 
midst of a hunger crisis, one that we 
knew would be exacerbated by the pan-
demic. In response, my congressional 
colleagues and I acted to provide crit-
ical resources and flexibilities to sup-
port schools and communities in serv-
ing and meeting the needs of families 
and children in need. Schools across 
the Nation were able to keep school 
meal programs afloat while providing 
free meals to an additional 10 million 
students each day. 
Boston Public Schools, the largest 
school district in my district, was able 
to serve over 330,000 students with free 
breakfasts and lunches across all city 
neighborhoods. 
For many families, these meals were 
the only reliable source of nutrition 
throughout the day. They were a sav-
ing grace and a lifeline for families 
across my district and across the Na-
tion, Madam Speaker. 
In less than 2 weeks, these school 
lunch flexibilities are set to expire. We 
must act with urgency to avoid a hun-
ger cliff that will fall hardest on our 
most vulnerable children. We must act 
to avoid a scenario where children will 
face a loss of 95 million meals over the 
course of the summer alone. 
States and districts have been sound-
ing the alarm. It was these calls from 
the community that prompted my col-
leagues, Representatives MCGOVERN, 
LEE, and me, to send an urgent letter 
to House and Senate leaders, 1 month 
ago now, urging them to do everything 
in their power to extend these essential 
lifelines. 
Senate 
Minority 
Leader 
MCCONNELL continues to block efforts 
to get this done. It is shameful yet 
unsurprising. 
In one of the richest nations in the 
world, it is an absolute disgrace that 
millions of children struggle with food 
insecurity every single day. The clock 
is running out, and we have a mandate 
and a duty to get this done. 
To my Republican colleagues, I urge 
them to join us in getting this done. 
Children, families, and school district 
leaders across the Nation simply can-
not wait. 
Once again, I thank my sister in 
service, Representative OMAR, for her 
steadfast leadership. 
Ms. OMAR. Madam Speaker, I thank 
Representative PRESSLEY for her re-
marks. 
Madam Speaker, I want for us to 
zoom out a little bit when we think 
about the kind of poverty that exists in 
our country. 
There are 37.2 million Americans who 
live in poverty. As I have stated ear-
lier, we have 38 million people, includ-
ing 12 million children, who are food 
insecure. 
One in 25 households in the U.S. expe-
rience very low food security, where 
families regularly skip meals because 
they can’t afford more food. 
One in 15 U.S. seniors faces hunger. 
That is 5.2 million seniors who are food 
insecure. 
Madam Speaker, 2.1 million house-
holds living in rural communities face 
hunger. Americans living in rural com-
munities face hunger at higher rates 
than those in urban areas, and BIPOC 
communities are especially hard-hit by 
hunger. Rural communities make up to 
63 percent of the counties in the U.S. 
and 91 percent of counties with the 
highest rates of overall food insecurity. 
In 2019, SNAP and school meals lifted 
3.2 million people out of poverty. 
If we just look at Minnesota alone, 
432,000 people are facing hunger, and of 
them, 147,000 are children. That is 1 in 
13 people and 1 in 9 children who face 
hunger in Minnesota. 
In April 2022, Minnesotans made 
463,000 visits to their food shelves. That 
is a 70 percent increase compared to 
April 2021. 
Since January 2022, food shelf visits 
statewide have increased by 39 percent. 
Madam Speaker, 2021 was the first 
year since 2014 that Minnesota didn’t 
see an annual increase in food shelf vis-
its. The reason for that, Madam Speak-
er, is because of the pandemic relief 
programs. 
We heard from so many people from 
across Minnesota and across the coun-
try, and I would just like to share some 
of their stories on how some of these 
pandemic relief programs have helped 
them. 
Eric from Willmar, Minnesota, re-
cently shared how he struggles to pro-
vide for himself and his siblings. Right 
before the pandemic, his mother passed 
away, and he became the legal guard-
ian of his younger siblings. Concerned 
about providing enough food to eat, he 
was grateful for the meals his siblings 
could get at school because of the 
MEALS Act. 
Amber, a mother from Duluth, Min-
nesota, shared how putting four kids 
through school has been a financial 
struggle. Both she and her husband 
work, making just above the threshold 
to qualify for the traditional free 
lunches. When my bill was passed out 
of the House, the MEALS Act allowed 
schools to provide school meals to all 
students, including Amber’s four chil-
dren, and she called it ‘‘godsent and a 
blessing.’’ 
Yesterday, we got an email from a 
school food service director for a group 
of 16 school districts in upstate central 
New York. 
She wrote: ‘‘It has been an incredibly 
difficult few years for school food serv-
ice with supply chain issues, rising 
costs of food, virtue, hybrid schedules, 
different serving models, labor short-
ages . . . but it has been a joy and 
privilege to see the direct impact of 
serving breakfast and lunch for free to 
all students. 
‘‘Our program has grown from serv-
ing about 1,500 breakfasts and 5,600 
lunches prepandemic to 3,500 break-
fasts and 7,500 lunches per day this 
school year. The stigma of free meals is 
gone since we are serving all students 
on a truly even playing field.’’ 
She went on to say: ‘‘The end of the 
child nutrition waivers, most signifi-
cantly the one that allows free meals 
for all students, will be a crushing blow 
to our program, our students, and our 
communities.’’ 
b 1700 
‘‘Families have come to appreciate 
and rely on the free meals,’’ she says. 
‘‘We anticipate spending the next year 
having to have hard conversations with 
upset parents who are struggling to 
pay their account balances. 
‘‘The argument that students who 
really need it can apply for free and re-
duced meals just doesn’t cut it. There 
is a huge gap between the income

guidelines and truly being able to cover 
all of life’s expenses, including school 
meals. 
‘‘Our school nutrition program, stu-
dents, and community thrived with 
universal free meals. Without them, 
the future looks dim.’’ 
That is why we are urgently asking 
Minority Leader MITCH MCCONNELL to 
not allow for these waivers to lapse. It 
is detrimental for us not to act and do 
the right thing. 
We also heard from a registered dieti-
tian and the food service director for a 
small rural school district. She wrote: 
‘‘Our enrollment pre-K–12 is only 660 
students, but well over half of them 
live in food-insecure homes. Prior to 
the waivers, in February of 2020, only 
20 percent of our youngest students in 
pre-K–6 ate breakfast with us. 
‘‘They would come in from the buses 
separate from their peers, singled out 
as ‘free breakfast kids’ while the others 
waited to start their day. . . . The last 
21⁄2 years has seen a sea change for our 
tiny school district. 
‘‘Due to free meals for all, we are 
able to transition our students starting 
in September 2020 to a Breakfast in the 
Classroom Program. Every day, they 
have a choice of the hot, nutritious 
meal of the day or cereal, both options 
served with fruit and ice-cold milk. 
‘‘Students take menus home at the 
beginning of the month, decide on 
which days they would like what 
meals. Teachers work collaboratively 
with the food service department to 
preorder 
breakfast daily. . . . Our 
breakfast 
participation 
has 
sky-
rocketed from 20 percent in February 
2020 to 85 percent as of Friday of last 
week. Our numbers continue to grow. 
And even better? Eating breakfast to-
gether as a school community has be-
come part of the woven fabric of our 
little district. . . . What will Sep-
tember look like without these waiv-
ers?’’ she asks. 
‘‘It will be heartbreaking. . . . With 
the inflation we have seen reflected in 
grocery store prices, some of these stu-
dents may well come to school with 
empty bellies. We will lose the sense of 
community, solidarity, and unity we 
have built over these past 21⁄2 years. 
The stigma of ‘needing help’ will be 
stamped upon the kids who are lucky 
enough to qualify while many others 
slip through the cracks, unlucky to 
have adults in their households who 
make enough to disqualify them from 
receiving benefits but poor enough to 
struggle as they balance $5 per gallon 
gasoline, food, and increased rent. 
‘‘We are literally begging all of you 
in Congress to please help us keep our 
kids fed. So many of them depend upon 
us. As we know, it is so hard to learn 
on an empty stomach.’’ 
I will end with where I started. This 
is a crisis. As I have always said, as 
someone who has lived in a war-en-
gulfed country, who has lived in a ref-
ugee camp, who has experienced what 
severe hunger can look like for a child 
who doesn’t have access to food, it is 
baffling to me that we see some of 
these stories coming out of commu-
nities here in the United States, in one 
of the wealthiest countries in the 
world. 
If we truly care about our children, 
and if we truly care about building a 
future generation that is ready to lead 
in our country, we have to care about 
getting them educated and ready. You 
cannot feed the brains of children if 
their bellies are not fed. We must act, 
and we must act now. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
f 
INFLATION AND OUR ECONOMY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Lou-
isiana (Mr. JOHNSON) is recognized for 
60 minutes as the designee of the mi-
nority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members have 5 legislative days to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous materials on the sub-
ject of my Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Louisiana? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, Democrats have enjoyed uni-
lateral control of Washington for the 
last 17 months, and we all know the re-
sults: record inflation, soaring gas 
prices, unhinged crime in our cities, 
and uninhibited illegal immigration. 
In the midst of all this, what issue 
gets their prime-time billing? Very 
simple. 
They 
are 
displaying 
their 
seething hatred for Donald Trump and 
anybody who ever supported him. 
For nearly a year now, they have in-
vested thousands of hours, millions 
upon millions of taxpayer dollars. They 
have interviewed hundreds and hun-
dreds of witnesses. They compiled 
100,000 pages of documents. They hired 
lawyers, consultants, and even big net-
work TV producers. And all for what? 
They are doing this production, this 
rehash, this replay of a moment-by-mo-
ment dissection of a terrible event that 
took place here a year and a half ago. 
They thought the American people 
would be riveted by their production, 
but the ratings have proven what ev-
erybody already knew. The American 
people have lived through all this, and 
they have moved on. 
In fact, we thought it was inter-
esting, according to one report, CBS’ 
decision to bump a ‘‘Young Sheldon’’ 
rerun from its prime-time slot in favor 
of Thursday’s January 6 hearing re-
sulted in fewer viewers than the iden-
tical time slot the prior week. Reruns 
of ‘‘Young Sheldon’’ played better than 
the January 6 drama. 
The American people have moved on. 
They have moved on to caring about 
things that actually affect their daily 
lives. 
Look, the criminals involved in Jan-
uary 6 are being prosecuted. Lessons 
about Capitol security were learned 
here. We will never know the true facts 
about all that, of course, because 
Speaker PELOSI’s partisan committee 
will not look into why we didn’t have 
adequate security here. 
But the Senate produced a bipartisan 
report on all these events a year ago. 
The truth is the Democrats could hire 
an army of broadcast media executives 
and specialists to try to boost their 
ratings, but it will not change the sim-
ple facts. 
The election this fall is going to be 
about three things. It is going to be 
about inflation, immigration, and in-
competence, the staggering levels of 
incompetence that the Democrats in 
charge of Washington put on display 
here every single day. 
If the Democrats want to reverse 
their political fortunes, they need to 
reverse their policies. But we all know, 
of course, they refuse to do that. So 
hardworking American families will 
continue, very sadly, to struggle as our 
country becomes less safe, less secure, 
and less stable by the hour. 
I am grateful to my colleagues for 
joining me tonight to discuss the myr-
iad crises facing our country. They are 
all taking a back seat to the Demo-
crats’ reality show, but we think it is 
important to point out to the Amer-
ican people the realities here, the true 
realities of what is happening and what 
we are facing as a country, these un-
precedented challenges. 
Madam Speaker, I yield first to the 
fine gentleman from the State of Penn-
sylvania (Mr. KELLER). 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Louisiana 
for hosting this Special Order. 
Madam Speaker, this week, President 
Biden visited Philadelphia and at-
tempted to spin a narrative fully de-
tached from the reality Americans face 
every day. Speaking to a group of labor 
unions, the President professed to be 
advancing a pro-worker agenda. He 
proclaimed, ‘‘We are changing people’s 
lives.’’ 
Well, he is right, only not for the bet-
ter. Inflation is at a 40-year high, cost-
ing Pennsylvania families an addi-
tional $517 more per month. 
Gas prices are above $5 a gallon, forc-
ing families to spend $2,800 more at the 
pump than last year. 
Pennsylvanians 
are 
smart, 
hard-
working people. They know that they 
are not better off today than they were 
just 18 short months ago. 
While the President continues to 
blame Republicans in Congress for the 
economic disaster he has created, the 
fact remains that Democrats control 
the House, the Senate, and the White 
House. If the President truly cared 
about stopping skyrocketing inflation, 
he would stop calling for more out-of- 
control spending, stop shutting down 
American energy production, and stop 
blaming others for his failures. 
It is time that he has faith in the 
American people and gets out of the 
way.

H5599 
June 15, 2022 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my friend. That is so 
well said. Just get out of the way. Let 
the American people do it. 
Madam Speaker, I yield next to an-
other great gentleman from the State 
of Pennsylvania (Mr. MEUSER). 
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Louisiana 
(Mr. JOHNSON) for his leadership. 
Madam Speaker, President Biden’s 
plan 
to 
tame 
escalating 
inflation 
passes the buck to Americans once 
again. Costs for driving to work, feed-
ing families, housing, and utilities are 
under 
unimaginable 
increases 
and 
strain on my constituents, thanks to 
the disastrous policies. 
President Biden largely puts respon-
sibility on the Federal Reserve to sta-
bilize inflation. However, the shocks 
that the Biden administration has 
brought to our economy are out of the 
Fed’s control. Sure, they play a role 
here. A majority of the inflation, how-
ever, has been caused by the assault on 
domestic energy, excessive government 
spending, and incentivizing a lack of 
American productivity. 
President Biden then wonders why 
we don’t embrace his plan to reduce in-
flation by tapping the emergency en-
ergy reserves. Somehow that is going 
to lower gas prices. Well, it hasn’t. It is 
a bad idea, and it hasn’t made a dent. 
Shockingly, 
against 
every 
funda-
mental of economics that we are even 
taught back in the seventh grade, 
Madam Speaker, he wants to raise 
taxes on American businesses, which, 
according to the Biden administration, 
will reduce the deficit, slow inflation, 
and create jobs. I am surprised it 
wouldn’t put food on the table as well. 
Americans, in their opinion, need re-
lief right now, not in some far off, far 
out way. Small businesses are right-
fully concerned about surviving after 
having to absorb huge new costs since 
the Biden administration came into of-
fice. And this is factual. The data is 
there, and the graphs are there. 
Bidenomics 
has 
greatly 
worsened 
what was and is a challenging time for 
our economy. But digging a hole much 
deeper than necessary and exacer-
bating pain for Americans who are 
struggling to cope with one economic 
hardship after another is certainly not 
the answer. 
There is no doubt the Federal Re-
serve’s delay in acting did make infla-
tion worse, and America’s overreliance 
on goods made in China also contrib-
uted to inflation, along with the 
COVID supply chain setbacks. How-
ever, we would be nowhere near the po-
sition we are in now if it were not for 
the terrible Bidenomics that they put 
in place. These reckless actions have 
turned economic challenges into a full- 
blown, as some describe, hurricane of 
an economic crisis. 
These policies have spearheaded an 
assault, an absolute assault, on our do-
mestic energy—this is unforgivable— 
over the last 18 months. 
President Biden canceled the Key-
stone pipeline. That was just the start 
of it. He halted issuance of other pipe-
line and drilling permits—far less were 
issued than were ever issued during the 
Obama years; mitigated LNG exports; 
threatened domestic banks and invest-
ment companies against investing in 
carbon fuels. 
Our domestic energy went from a 
state of independence and surplus to a 
high level of dependency. After these 
Biden administration policies kicked 
in, the U.S. became at the mercy, once 
again, to the energy players like OPEC 
and Russia, meaning any geopolitical 
disruption would spike gas prices, lead-
ing to cascades of issues for Americans, 
consumers, and businesses. 
Madam Speaker, we have seen this 
before. This is a rerun. This is why U.S. 
domestic energy independence is so 
crucial. 
However, the administration, and 
many in this Chamber, have a ‘‘go 
green now or else’’ mentality, which 
has generated $5-plus gasoline prices 
and caused natural gas to go so far 
high up in price that fertilizer costs 
have caused farmers’ prices and costs 
to 
skyrocket. 
Of 
course, 
food 
on 
everybody’s table soon followed. 
b 1715 
Biden and the Democrats—and it is 
far too many Democrats, frankly—in 
Congress continued spending trillions 
which exacerbated inflation, leading to 
predictable inflation where even Demo-
crats such as Larry Summers, an econ-
omist, stated, look out for a rapid rise 
and a sustained inflationary period. 
Many others said, Oh, no, Larry’s 
wrong this time. Well, Larry was not 
wrong. Now, with the threat of tax in-
creases and a laundry list of every reg-
ulatory 
antigrowth 
measure 
imag-
inable, this woke, go-broke economy is 
going to continue to fail American 
families. 
Madam Speaker, we must encourage 
responsible domestic energy produc-
tion. We must lower taxes to rev up our 
economy. The United States must have 
the most competitive economy in the 
world, job creation machine and per-
haps a job creation tax credit. 
We must support production of items 
made in America. We must do our very 
best to buy American, and we need to 
pivot from this awful path that we con-
tinue to be on. 
I will wrap up by simply stating that 
we must recognize where the problem 
started, what the problem is, have a 
plan for solutions, and that means hav-
ing the courage to change course now. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Thank 
you for that expertise. You sound like 
a former Secretary of Revenue or 
something from the State of Pennsyl-
vania. 
As you pointed out, my friend, you 
don’t have to be an economist to figure 
this out. Every freshman economics 
student knows if you keep printing 
money and dropping it into the econ-
omy, you are going to cause inflation. 
This is not rocket science, but you 
know what? The President of the 
United States apparently doesn’t get 
it. 
Madam Speaker, I am delighted next 
to yield to the good doctor from Texas 
(Mr. BABIN). 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my friend from Louisiana, the gen-
tleman, for his leadership. I really ap-
preciate it. 
If Joe Biden valued America, if he 
valued our freedoms, our prosperity, 
our success, our influence on the world, 
he would value the security of our 
economy. He would value a balanced 
budget, and he would value your finan-
cial future. 
But, of course, we know he doesn’t. 
Your financial stability gets in the way 
of his agenda. The money that Biden 
asked for and that Democrats in this 
Chamber incessantly spend is not only 
just random dollars and cents from 
who knows where, but also money that 
you have earned from your hard work, 
money that should have been used to 
ensure you and your family see a stable 
and prosperous future. 
Plain and simple, these antigrowth 
and pro-tax policies have us hurtling 
toward a recession and will destroy 
your ability to build the future that 
you want to have. It is no wonder that 
consumer confidence and the Demo-
crats’ agenda is reeling nationwide. 
Last month, inflation increased at 
the quickest pace since December of 
1981—8.6 percent over the past year. 
Those 
aren’t 
just 
words. 
Inflation 
means that everything costs you more. 
Inflation this high, rising that quick-
ly, means that American families are 
now facing the very harsh reality that 
they could be on the brink of financial 
ruin which many respected economists 
now are fearing that the wheels may 
come off of our economy. 
Commonsense solutions could have 
prevented most of this. Reckless so-
cialist spending sparked the fire and 
paying workers to stay home fanned 
that flame. 
The irresponsible policies coming out 
of the Democrat party spurred on a 
manufacturing and supply chain dis-
aster like we have never seen before in 
our history—all for the sake of a woke 
socialist agenda. 
I hope that they are proud of them-
selves. I hope that they are proud that 
they have caused energy prices to rise 
by more than 30 percent. I hope they 
are proud that gasoline is $5 a gallon 
across the country, nearly a 100 per-
cent increase. 
I hope they are proud that we still 
don’t have baby formula on the shelves 
and that people cannot put food on the 
table because prices are way up, over 12 
percent now, and that wages are 
shrinking, and that fewer women and 
minorities are in the workforce, and 
that the stock market is volatile and 
has lost trillions of Americans’ wealth. 
I could go on and on. 
My colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle are responsible for this, and it 
is time that they take responsibility 
and shift course before it is too late. 
Our very future hangs in the balance.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5600 
June 15, 2022 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, that was so well said. 
Dr. Babin, that woke socialist policy 
has brought some real pain to the 
American people. I think they have had 
enough. 
Mr. BABIN. Amen. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Novem-
ber can’t get here soon enough. 
Madam Speaker, I am happy to yield 
next to the gentleman from Wisconsin 
(Mr. GROTHMAN). 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, 
we will talk a little bit about the bor-
der again and what I think is kind of 
an inappropriate way to handle some 
recent events that happened down 
there. 
First of all, we have got to give the 
backdrop, right. We are all familiar 
with the most recent statistics avail-
able. For April of 2022, 184,000 people 
crossed in the country that were not 
appropriately vetted and we do not par-
ticularly want here. 
A year ago, that 184,000 number was 
at 66,000. Two years ago, under the 
prior administration, it was 5,700. So, 
first of all, the American public should 
kind of let that sink in: 5,700 a month 
to 66,000 a month to 184,000 a month. 
Horrific. 
Part of monitoring the border is 
showing respect for the Border Patrol. 
I have been on the border eight times 
over the last 2 years, and I think they 
are the most professional of law en-
forcement agencies I have run into. 
Last September, when potential Hai-
tian immigrants tried to cross the Rio 
Grande and get up on shore, agents on 
horses used reins to protect the Hai-
tians from the horses’ hooves. 
Every agent I have talked to felt this 
was an entirely appropriate way to pro-
tect the Haitians who were trying to 
come into our country. But President 
Biden, 
the 
new 
expert 
on 
horsemanship, felt that the new immi-
grants were strapped, whatever that 
meant, and said that they would have 
to pay. 
Now, the Department of Homeland 
Security claims that the Border Patrol 
agents should be disciplined for pro-
tecting the Haitians from the horses’ 
hooves. 
Since then, President Biden’s budget, 
the last budget which he signed, the 
last appropriation bill, provided mil-
lions of dollars for monitoring and dis-
ciplining the Border Patrol. 
This is kind of a mental problem we 
have seen before in Washington. It re-
minds me when we had record murders 
in our big cities, and Washington re-
sponded by saying that we had to pass 
a bill making it easier to sue the po-
lice. In other words, all these people 
dying, records in the last 2 years in 
Milwaukee—which is adjacent to my 
district, and they think the problem is 
the police. 
In any event, that is what the Biden 
administration did. They claimed the 
police were racist, making it easier to 
sue police. Obviously, that is inappro-
priate. 
The other thing I think is inappro-
priate is we hired a new Border Patrol 
head who used to be a police chief. 
When he was a police chief, he wouldn’t 
cooperate with ICE when they had 
problems with people who they were 
trying to deport or people who were 
here illegally. 
I mean, can you imagine what type of 
effect that has on the Border Patrol 
agents when the person who is sup-
posed to be the boss doesn’t seem to be 
on board with the underlying mission? 
I believe he also had a problem in 
which he was accused of some harass-
ment in his prior job. Now, we have got 
to hire some more Border Patrol 
agents here, and the way to do it is to 
not have the administration treat 
these brave, honorable people inappro-
priately. 
So I call upon Congress to try to 
weigh in with the President. If you 
have taken a trip down to the border, 
tell him how great the Border Patrol 
agents are. 
Make that an attractive job because 
we need top-flight agents to save our 
country from people who don’t belong 
here and also to save our country from 
the sea of fentanyl that is flowing in 
here and that apparently is not some-
thing that concerns Congress a whole 
lot. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Thank 
you, my friend. That border crisis con-
tinues to grow by the hour. Right now 
as we speak, there is the largest cara-
van we think that has ever been spot-
ted currently headed to our southern 
border. 
It was incentivized, of course, by the 
Biden administration’s open border 
agenda. The caravan has as many as 
maybe 15,000 people, most from Ven-
ezuela, Nicaragua, and Cuba. 
Here is the key point. One of the mi-
grants is reported to have told FOX 
News that he hopes President Biden 
will keep his amnesty promise to the 
caravan. You know, that is exactly 
why people from more than 160 coun-
tries have been flooding over that bor-
der since right after Joe Biden took of-
fice. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Tennessee 
(Mr. 
BURCHETT). 
Mr. BURCHETT. Thank you, Vice 
Chairman JOHNSON, for yielding valu-
able time out of your very busy sched-
ule. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
thank 
you, 
ma’am. 
The Biden administration’s response 
to the baby formula crisis has been a 
joke. President Biden has tried to de-
flect the blame by claiming he wasn’t 
aware of the severity of the shortage 
until April of 2022. 
To me, Madam Speaker, Mr. Chair-
man, this claim just shows he either 
has no idea about what is going on in 
his administration or in this country, 
or he is a liar, or maybe both. 
The FDA received a whistleblower’s 
report, as you well know, in October of 
2021 about the sanitation issues at the 
Abbott manufacturing plant, but they 
didn’t do anything about it. They 
didn’t have any intention to do any-
thing about it. 
They only closed the facility in Feb-
ruary of 2022 when two precious little 
babies died after drinking formula 
from that plant, and to me, that is 
criminal. 
Unfortunately, the Biden administra-
tion’s signature move, as always, is see 
a problem, don’t do anything, then 
blame others when things go wrong. 
I always remember the words of 
Harry Truman, ‘‘The buck stops here.’’ 
This President has repeated those, and 
he has yet to follow his own advice, 
and I believe things have certainly 
gone wrong. 
The out-of-stock rate for baby for-
mula was recently 70 percent across 
our great country—70 percent. This 
means that parents across this Nation 
are going to be unable to feed their lit-
tle ones. 
This disproportionately affects our 
low-income families because folks with 
money generally are going to find 
something. They are going to find it on 
the internet, find a friend or some-
where else. 
Of course, House Democrats’ solution 
was to give $28 million to a bloated bu-
reaucracy at the FDA to address the 
shortage. But, of course, $23 million of 
it was for staff salaries and the admin-
istration. 
Of course, the bill that passed that 
was bipartisan cleared up some of the 
bureaucracy, but that was completely 
ignored by the media. 
It is mainly because the media, by 
and large, except for a few exceptions, 
is totally in the tank for this adminis-
tration. They have so much invested in 
him that they can’t stand to see him 
fail, which he is—horribly. 
I believe throwing money at a prob-
lem is not going to make it go away. 
You need a plan to go with it. You need 
to cut some of this red tape and bu-
reaucracy. It gets in the way of enact-
ing real solutions. 
We still likely won’t see any formula 
hitting the shelves until mid-July— 
mid-July. I think that is unacceptable, 
Mr. Chairman. We need to feed our ba-
bies today. 
Mr. Chairman, thank you for your 
leadership, and as you have told me 
many times when I was a freshman, 
that when you are sitting at the table, 
there will be time enough for counting 
when the dealing is done. You, sir, are 
the gambler. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. And you 
have got to know when to fold. 
Madam Speaker, Tennessee is going 
so well, I may as well yield to another 
good friend, another gentleman from 
the State of Tennessee (Mr. ROSE), one 
that is even more reputable than the 
last speaker. 
Mr. ROSE. So true. Thank you, Vice- 
Chairman JOHNSON. I appreciate that. 
Madam Speaker, the average cost of 
a gallon of gas in this country just 
passed $5 per gallon for the very first 
time. I repeat: The average cost of a

gallon of gas in this country just 
passed $5 per gallon for the very first 
time. 
I would like to remind Americans, es-
pecially those on the other side of the 
aisle who may not be affected because 
they drive electric vehicles, that prices 
at the pump started to go up well be-
fore Vladimir Putin’s disgraceful inva-
sion of Ukraine. 
In fact, they started climbing shortly 
after President Biden took office. It is 
not a coincidence. It is not an unin-
tended consequence. It was the Presi-
dent’s intended outcome. 
The President doesn’t beat around 
the bush on the topic of fossil fuels. On 
the campaign trail, he pledged to get 
rid of them. I would say he is well on 
his way to keeping that promise. 
Remember, this country was a net 
exporter of oil. Now we are stuck hop-
ing the President has a good meeting 
with the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, 
the same country he called a pariah, 
one that we hope results in them pro-
ducing more oil and, hopefully, low-
ering global prices. 
This administration has taken many 
steps to make it next to impossible to 
expand drilling here at home. We all 
remember how quickly the President 
killed the Keystone XL pipeline with 
no regard for the impact that would 
have on those jobs or how dependent it 
would make us on foreign oil suppliers. 
This administration has also pro-
posed more than $80 billion in tax in-
creases on energy producers in the first 
two budget cycles since being in office. 
b 1730 
We know the war in Ukraine has im-
pacted fuel prices, but we Republicans 
argue that we didn’t have to be reliant 
on foreign countries. If we just used 
the oil we have here at home, we prob-
ably could have kept prices down. Now, 
we are asking OPEC to produce more. 
It makes no sense. 
The President calls this moment an 
incredible transition. I see nothing in-
credible about it. In fact, the only 
transition I see is the American people 
going from being able to provide for 
their families to being stuck at home 
because of record inflation and gas 
prices that have more than doubled. 
We are not going to go from oil to 
electric consumption overnight. The 
grid isn’t ready for an all-electric fu-
ture. We should pursue an all-of-the- 
above approach that includes oil. The 
Tennessee Valley Authority uses 39 
percent nuclear, 19 percent coal, 26 per-
cent natural gas, 11 percent hydro, and 
3 percent wind and solar to power mil-
lions of homes across the Tennessee 
valley. That is how you make sure you 
are not just energy independent, but 
you are energy dominant. 
The answer isn’t raiding our Stra-
tegic Petroleum Reserve. The answer 
certainly isn’t relying on foreign coun-
tries for supply. The answer is tapping 
into the resources with which our Na-
tion happens to be abundantly blessed. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, my friend is correct. That en-
ergy crisis haunts every American. We 
see no end in sight because the White 
House will not reverse its policies. 
Madam Speaker, I yield next to the 
gentleman from Florida (Mr. BILI-
RAKIS). 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to discuss the misguided pri-
orities of this Chamber. 
At a time when Americans are facing 
extreme hardship—grappling with the 
highest rates of inflation in more than 
40 years; $5 per gallon, at least, gas; 
workforce and food shortages; and un-
precedented crime and illegal border 
crossings—House Democrats continue 
to ignore urgent matters and, instead, 
engage in deflection. 
For example, the majority scheduled 
three irrelevant bills for consideration 
on the House floor. 
The first allocated $1.3 billion in an-
nual 
mandatory 
spending, 
Madam 
Speaker, for a new regulatory agency 
to protect endangered species. This is 
the type of tone-deaf policy proposals 
that show Democrats are out of touch 
with the American people, unfortu-
nately. 
The second bill brought up for con-
sideration targets the Federal Reserve 
at a crucial time. The Federal Reserve 
is supposed to be an independent, non-
political, agency tasked with managing 
our Nation’s monetary policy, yet 
House Democrats want to divert the 
Fed’s attention away from addressing 
an impending recession and instead im-
pose its woke agenda. Out of touch, 
Madam Speaker. 
This truly defies common sense, in 
my opinion. Inflation hurts all Ameri-
cans, regardless of race, and turning 
the Federal Reserve into a social jus-
tice warrior will only serve to com-
pound the hurt for everyone, unfortu-
nately, Madam Speaker. 
The third measure brought to the 
floor this week is more deflection. In 
essence, it adds more costs to U.S. pro-
ducers. That is no way to do it. This 
will only serve to increase the cost of 
doing business. Those increased costs 
will get passed along to the consumer, 
like you and me. 
Another attempted distraction is the 
sham January 6 hearings hosted during 
prime-time TV in a gross display of 
partisan gamesmanship. These are not 
fact checking. 
It is no secret I voted against the cre-
ation of this panel. It was clear from 
the onset that Democrat leaders had no 
interest in an open and unbiased review 
of what occurred that day when they 
denied all Republican-named nominees 
to the panel. 
Any doubt that this would be any-
thing more than a bogus, made-for-TV 
drama was put to rest when footage 
surfaced that the committee was rely-
ing on teleprompters, and when ratings 
weren’t good, they canceled or post-
poned hearings. My goodness. 
Madam Speaker, I will not be dis-
tracted from the real problems facing 
American families. I will keep fighting 
to do the right thing by my constitu-
ents. If House Democrats had any sense 
of urgency, they would put aside the 
political charade and join me and my 
Republican colleagues to get the hard 
stuff done. 
Time is of the essence. The American 
people cannot wait any longer. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, my friend said it well. He is 
right, time is of the essence. Every day 
that we belabor and continue these 
radical leftist policies, the American 
people feel more and more pain. 
Madam Speaker, I yield next to my 
good friend from Georgia (Mr. CLYDE). 
Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, I thank 
Vice Chairman JOHNSON
for hosting 
this Special Order tonight and for al-
lowing us to highlight the various cri-
ses that are affecting our Nation today. 
Last week, inflation hit a whopping 
8.6 percent, the highest since 1981, and 
gas prices have soared to $5 a gallon 
nationwide for the first time in his-
tory. In fact, just last week, for the 
first time in my life, I paid more than 
$100 just to fill up the gas tank of my 
pickup truck. As the good Speaker 
knows, if our own home State had not 
temporarily suspended the gas tax in 
Georgia, it would have been $110 to fill 
up my pickup truck. 
Consumer confidence has plunged to 
a record low, and I don’t blame them. 
Gas, 
groceries, 
utilities, 
common 
goods, they are all going up. Month 
after month, the sticker shock con-
tinues to burden American workers and 
families, with no end in sight. 
Yet 
President 
Biden 
comically 
claims he is, and I quote, changing peo-
ple’s lives. Well, I think he really is, 
but it is not changing for the better. 
Dare I say the President’s policies are 
actually ruining people’s lives, de-
stroying the middle class, and disman-
tling our economy. Our Nation is in 
full buyer’s remorse. 
The American people are increas-
ingly fearful of a recession. What are 
the Democrats here in Congress doing 
about it right now? As of late, their 
focus has been prime time political 
hearings, aimed at smearing President 
Trump and his supporters, as well as 
infringing 
on 
Americans’ 
constitu-
tional right to keep and bear arms. 
Not to mention, earlier this after-
noon, the Subcommittee on Economic 
and Consumer Policy of the Committee 
on Oversight and Reform held our very 
first hearing in 2022. The subject? In-
vestigating tick and flea collars. I just 
can’t make this stuff up. It was not 
Jimmy Carter-era inflation. It didn’t 
make the cut. 
And then we have the news reports 
from this morning that suggest some of 
my Democrat colleagues are focused on 
instituting gender-neutral bathrooms 
throughout Capitol Hill. 
What in the world is going on? I can 
assure my Democrat colleagues that 
my constituents in Georgia’s Ninth 
District are far more concerned about 
putting food on the table and filling 
their gas tanks than any of the liberal 
nonsense that this body is so fixated 
on.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5602 
June 15, 2022 
Democrats’ severely misguided prior-
ities are a disgrace, but maybe they are 
actually intended to be a distraction 
because 
tackling 
inflation 
head-on 
would require Democrats and President 
Biden to face the undeniable reality 
that their Big Government, socialist 
agenda caused this mess in the first 
place. 
The American people deserve better, 
period. Congress must refocus its at-
tention on implementing effective so-
lutions in order to get our economy 
and our country back on track, just 
like it was under President Trump’s 
leadership. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, my friend from Georgia made 
a great summary of the crisis that we 
are in. I thank him for bringing that. 
Madam Speaker, I yield next to the 
gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. 
HARSHBARGER), my dear friend, and the 
third speaker from the good State of 
Tennessee, can’t have enough of those 
Vols. 
Mrs. 
HARSHBARGER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I had a lot of problems to 
choose from tonight, but I rise today to 
talk about the border crisis. 
I remind the American people that 
our national security is still in jeop-
ardy as our southern border remains 
wide open. Since Joe Biden took office, 
over 2.6 million illegal immigrants 
have been apprehended at the southern 
border. 
Because of President Biden’s failed 
open border policies, more drugs have 
been smuggled into our neighborhoods 
than ever before. CBP estimates that 
nearly 5,300 pounds of deadly fentanyl 
analogues have been apprehended, and 
that is enough to kill 2.4 billion people. 
I don’t know of a person that I talk to 
or that I see that hasn’t been touched 
by the loss of somebody concerning 
overdoses. 
As a pharmacist, I know this all too 
well, that the illegal fentanyl ana-
logues flowing through Joe’s open bor-
der have caused unthinkable harm by 
poisoning our communities. 
According 
to 
the 
Metro 
Public 
Health Department in Nashville last 
year, 74 percent of overdose-related 
toxicology 
reports 
detected 
fatal 
fentanyl analogues. 
Wondering how all that fentanyl is 
getting into a State like mine? I am 
not even a border State. 
It is no coincidence that Border Pa-
trol agents reported a 1,066 percent in-
crease in fentanyl seizures at just one 
stretch of the U.S.-Mexico border last 
year. 
The influx of dangerous, illegal drugs 
is making its way through all our 
neighborhoods, and this is no longer a 
geographically tied tragedy. As I said 
before, Tennessee isn’t a border State, 
but we are all border States. The Biden 
administration’s failure has had deadly 
consequences, and my home State has 
not been immune. 
As I stand here today, the largest 
caravan of people intending to illegally 
reside in the United States is heading 
to our southern border. Word has got-
ten around that Joe Biden is soft on 
crime and that he has opened his arms 
and our border to anyone and everyone. 
This caravan could total up to 15,000 
people, and that far outnumbers our 
Border Patrol agents who are already 
struggling 
to 
protect 
our 
borders. 
These thousands are just crumbs com-
pared to the millions who have entered 
our country illegally in the last year. 
I have been to the border more times 
now in my first term in the House of 
Representatives than Joe Biden has in 
nearly half a century in public service. 
What I saw there at both Eagle Pass 
and the Rio Grande Valley Sector was 
heartbreaking and infuriating. 
I had the opportunity to speak with 
our Border Patrol agents who just want 
to do their job and keep our Nation 
safe, but they are struggling under the 
conditions 
this 
administration 
has 
boxed them into. They don’t have 
enough resources, manpower, or sup-
port to turn away the hordes of invad-
ers that come through the border every 
single day, and the illicit and illegal 
criminals that are coming, the got- 
aways, we don’t know who they are, 
where they came from, or where they 
are going. That is of even more con-
cern. 
In fact, they have been encouraged to 
help transport these individuals to 
every corner of the Nation without a 
way of knowing who they are or where 
they are going. What we do know is 
who is paying for all this, and that is a 
simple answer. It is the American tax-
payer. 
This year, Secretary Mayorkas ad-
mitted that Americans are out $72 mil-
lion just from President Biden’s order 
to halt the border wall construction. 
We are paying not to build the border 
wall. Plainly speaking, the American 
people are being charged to ensure they 
are less safe. This crisis greatly bene-
fits the cartels and gravely threatens 
Americans. 
Every State is a border State as Joe 
Biden’s border crisis damages our na-
tional security. This crisis has gone on 
long enough. Americans deserve better, 
and they deserve a closed border. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I have another colleague or 
two on the way. How much time is re-
maining on the clock in this Special 
Order? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 21 minutes remaining. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Thank 
you so much, Madam Speaker. I will 
read a quote here that is very familiar 
to everyone now because it has been re-
peated over and over in the last several 
days. It is from CHUCK SCHUMER. Of 
course, he is the Democrat leader on 
the Senate side. He stood on the steps 
of the United States Supreme Court, 
and he exclaimed to a crowd, to their 
applause, and to all the television cam-
eras, what is now a quote that lives in 
infamy, ‘‘I want to tell you, Gorsuch; I 
want to tell you, Kavanaugh: You have 
released the whirlwind, and you will 
pay the price. You won’t know what hit 
you if you go forward with these awful 
decisions.’’ 
b 1745 
The leader of the Democrats in the 
Senate stood on the steps of the United 
States Supreme Court and threatened 
the Justices by name. 
Now, what is happening? What is hap-
pening now? Well, people are heeding 
that advice. There was a leaked opin-
ion, an unprecedented, terribly tragic 
event there that will harm the institu-
tion permanently, the Supreme Court. 
Some clerk, we suspect—I think it is 
one of the liberal law clerks for one of 
the liberal Justices, the three Justices 
on that Court committed to that ide-
ology. Somebody leaked the draft opin-
ion, and it has caused a whirlwind. 
All of these protesters are criminals. 
They are not really protesters. They 
are criminals because this is blatantly 
against the black letter of the Federal 
law. 18 U.S.C. 1507 openly makes this a 
crime. You can’t protest at the home of 
a judge to try to influence their opin-
ion. Yet, that is exactly what is hap-
pening. 
As we speak right now, there are lib-
eral activists on the lawns of the Jus-
tices of the Supreme Court, the con-
servative Justices. 
Do you know what? Their lives are in 
danger because we now know, just a 
few days ago, a would-be assassin was 
apprehended on the lawn of Justice 
Kavanaugh. He was home with his wife 
and his two young daughters. 
This is a dangerous thing, and this is 
what is wrought when so-called leaders 
tell the American people to get in the 
faces of their political opponents, to 
release the whirlwind, you won’t know 
what hit you, and all the rest. That is 
what is happening right now. 
What are Republicans doing about it? 
What is Congress doing about it? Noth-
ing at all. The Democrat majority 
won’t even acknowledge that this is a 
problem. In fact, on this floor last 
night, we had 27 progressives, 27 of the 
Democrats in this House, vote against 
a simple bill, a measure that would 
provide security and protection for the 
innocent children of these Justices. 
They voted against that. It is unbeliev-
able. 
People back home ask me, my con-
stituents, say: What are they thinking? 
What in the world is going on? Do they 
want people to be harmed? 
Look, I think the motive is that they 
want to send a message to the radical 
left that we like you violating the law. 
We want you on the lawns of conserv-
ative judges. We want you to try to in-
timidate them into changing their 
opinions because they may overturn 
Roe, or they may interpret the Con-
stitution in a way that the radical left 
disagrees with. 
This is a tinderbox. This is a dan-
gerous time in the country. The so- 
called leaders here are encouraging and 
inflaming this. Heaven forbid if some-
one actually gets hurt.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5603 
June 15, 2022 
We filed a resolution here within a 
few days of that leak last month. 
Forty-five Members joined me in that 
resolution. We called upon the Depart-
ment of Justice to enforce 18 U.S.C. 
1507, to enforce the law that makes it a 
crime to picket or parade to influence 
a judge. Do you know what? Crickets. 
The Department of Justice hasn’t done 
anything. 
Can you imagine if a threat was 
made to one of the liberal Justices? 
Can you imagine the outcry? The 
mainstream media and the Democrats 
here, the radical left, they would be de-
manding action. But if it is a conserv-
ative judge, hey, fair game, apparently. 
It is open season on conservative 
judges. That is what we have now. 
We also filed, last month, the Leaker 
Accountability Act that would make it 
a crime to knowingly share confiden-
tial information from the Supreme 
Court. I authored that legislation. I 
think it ought to be punishable by a 
fine or up to 5 years imprisonment. 
We have to send a message. This be-
havior, the leak, the violence that has 
ensued because of it, is unacceptable. 
The idea, again, that our colleagues 
would vote against protection for the 
children of these judges is, to me, un-
conscionable and an unforgivable vote. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. LAMALFA), 
my good friend. 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleague from Louisiana for 
leading these important topics here. 
There is such a broad range of things 
we can be talking about, but one of the 
key issues that finally we got action on 
was the issue with the crazy radicals 
that have illegally protested outside of 
the Supreme Court Justices’ homes, 
threatening them, going so far as even 
implicating that they are going to have 
an assassination attempt on a Supreme 
Court Justice. 
What kind of system of government 
will we have if they have to worry 
about whether they are going to be as-
saulted or even killed over doing their 
job? 
After 
weeks 
of 
twiddling 
their 
thumbs as this violence escalated, fi-
nally, we were able to pass the Su-
preme Court Police Parity Act. 
Meanwhile, inflation rates have sky-
rocketed for months, and prices on ev-
erything are going up dramatically be-
cause of supply chain issues that could 
be fixed if the administration and this 
Congress were focused on the American 
people instead of pie-in-the-sky things 
like the Green New Deal or others. 
We have seen little action from the 
left on these issues. It looks like we 
will be too busy to bring to the floor 
these solutions that we have been 
working on in the Committee on Agri-
culture and others. Instead, we get the 
soap opera, complete with prime time 
and production from ABC News execu-
tives, otherwise known as the January 
6th Select Committee. Select what? 
The hearings are being broadcasted 
in prime time, although the ratings are 
actually going in the toilet for that, as 
reruns from other programs are out-
stripping them, including the TV show 
called ‘‘Young Sheldon,’’ which is actu-
ally kind of entertaining, I guess. What 
it really shows is that viewers would 
rather watch paint dry than watch a 
bunch 
of 
lawmakers 
using 
tele-
prompters in their made-for-TV drama. 
We didn’t need a whole partisan pro-
duction when BENNIE
THOMPSON
ob-
jected to the 2004 Presidential election, 
and we had a Senator join in on that, 
to bring that to a vote. I guess that all 
is different when it is a Republican 
coming in. 
We need to look into the security 
failures of the day, on January 6, and 
ask the real questions that need to be 
asked. The select committee is, in-
stead, doctoring evidence, texts, and 
other things to make it look like a 
one-sided deal. If we had balance on the 
committee, we would actually be get-
ting to ask the real questions and get 
down to real solutions. 
With many reviews conducted of the 
security vulnerabilities in the Capitol, 
we have a lot to do in order to make it 
more secure and something that people 
can have confidence in, in the process 
we are supposed to have here, including 
on that day, January 6, when we were 
supposed to constitutionally complete 
our work, though I had colleagues say-
ing: ‘‘Are we going to actually go back 
in there and complete it?’’ Yes, we 
have to do our job. We have those du-
ties on January 6 following each Presi-
dential election. 
Is it politics or is it solutions? Soar-
ing gas prices; baby formula shortages, 
for crying out loud; sky-high inflation; 
rising crime rates; illegal aliens flood-
ing across our border. 
The only thing the Dems really want 
to run on is bashing President Trump. 
Well, he is not President anymore. 
Even though he is living rent-free in-
side their heads, we need to move on to 
something else, getting the work done, 
the job done, for the American people, 
who are suffering right now because of 
the policies and the inattention to the 
details that would help them. 
Let’s get to work on the real things. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for yielding. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my friend for faith-
fully coming to this floor and speaking 
to his constituents and the American 
people about these very serious issues 
that face us as a country. His voice is 
an important one. 
I am grateful to him and our many 
colleagues for joining us tonight to dis-
cuss all of these crises facing our coun-
try that are taking a back seat to the 
Democrat reality show and the most 
radical set of domestic and foreign 
policies that America has ever seen. 
As we close, I remind everybody—we

claimed in his now infamous speech, he 
said: ‘‘We are changing people’s lives.’’ 
You saw that? 
Mr. LAMALFA. Yes. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. There is 
zero doubt about that, Mr. President. 
Lives are being devastated under your 
policies.

RECOGNIZING CHILDREN’S WEEK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentlewoman from California (Ms. JA-
COBS) for 30 minutes. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. JACOBS of California. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous 
material on the subject of my Special 
Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. JACOBS of California. Madam 
Speaker, I am proud to be here during 
Children’s Week, alongside a number of 
my colleagues, to elevate the ongoing 
need to invest in and support kids. 
This year, Children’s Week comes at 
a time when we are facing critically 
important policy decisions that could 
lift millions of kids out of poverty. 
Over the last 2 years, Congress made 
the most significant investment in kids 
in decades. Legislation passed during 
the pandemic, including the expanded 
and improved child tax credit, which I 
was proud to for vote in the American 
Rescue Plan, increased the share of 
Federal spending on children by nearly 
50 percent. 
But as emergency measures expire, 
children are experiencing a backslide. 
More than 3 million children have been 
pushed back into poverty since the ex-
piration of the child tax credit. More 
than 6 million children are poised to 
lose Medicaid or CHIP coverage when 
the public health emergency is re-
voked. Thousands of school meal pro-
viders could be forced to shut down if 
child nutrition waivers expire at the 
end of this month, leaving millions of 
kids without healthy meals this sum-
mer. 
The expiration of these provisions 
comes at a time when children are 
navigating incredible challenges, in-
cluding an epidemic of gun violence, a 
wave of anti-LGBTQ-plus legislation, 
and a mental health crisis. These ex-
amples serve as a reminder that every 
issue is a kids issue. 
As a member of the Select Com-
mittee on Economic Disparity and 
Fairness in Growth, ending child pov-
erty has been one of my top priorities. 
Children are currently the poorest de-
mographic group in the United States, 
and our child poverty rate remains 
shockingly high compared to our eco-
nomic peers. Even in some of our

wealthiest 
States, 
like 
California, 
which I am proud to represent, and in 
some of our wealthiest areas, like my 
district in San Diego, more than 40 per-
cent of kids were in families experi-
encing poverty before the pandemic. 
America’s kids deserve better, and 
the good news is that we know what 
works. The expanded child tax credit 
showed how much progress we can 
make when families have the cash they 
need to make ends meet. Child poverty 
fell by nearly 30 percent, and families 
overwhelmingly used these funds to 
pay for food and other basic needs. 
Since the start of the pandemic, the 
number of kids receiving vital health 
coverage has soared, and over 10 mil-
lion more students have received free 
school lunches, saving families from 
completing complicated applications 
that can isolate children from their 
peers. 
There is so much more to do to sup-
port children and their families, in-
cluding expanding access to affordable, 
accessible childcare. I am proud to be 
leading a letter, alongside Representa-
tives 
Bonamici, 
Castro, 
Houlahan, 
Himes, and McEachin, in support of in-
cluding childcare in any future rec-
onciliation package. 
As a country, we also need a clear na-
tional goal to reduce child poverty, and 
we need data to inform our decisions 
and make sure no child is falling 
through the cracks. That is why I am 
proud to be an original cosponsor of 
the Child Poverty Reduction Act and 
why I was proud to lead a letter, along-
side Congresswoman DELBENE and Con-
gresswoman JAYAPAL, calling for fund-
ing in the 2023 appropriations bill to 
improve our measures on child poverty 
and family material hardship. 
Investing in children isn’t just the 
right thing to do to give kids and fami-
lies a strong start. It is also the fis-
cally responsible thing to do. 
Child poverty costs our economy up 
to $1.1 trillion a year in lost economic 
output, increased healthcare spending, 
and more. The investments we make in 
kids pay off across a lifetime. 
A study from Harvard’s Opportunity 
Insights found that the investments we 
make in kids consistently have the 
highest returns. For every $1 we invest 
in high-quality early childhood edu-
cation, we save $6 down the road. 
While some of my colleagues might 
say we can’t afford to invest in kids, 
the fact of the matter is, we can’t af-
ford not to. The case for prioritizing 
kids is so strong, and I look forward to 
working with my colleagues not just 
this week but every week to improve 
outcomes for kids and build a better fu-
ture. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. FOSTER). 
Mr. FOSTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to speak as a father and a new 
and excited grandfather to advocate for 
a country that is dedicated to helping 
all of its children thrive. 
As a scientist, I recognize that one of 
the most important issues our children 
face is the fragility of children’s brain 
development. Early brain development 
in children lays the foundation for 
their success in adulthood. During the 
first few years of life, millions of new 
neural connections are formed every 
second. It is during this time that the 
brain is the most flexible but also the 
most vulnerable to the environment 
around it. 
Polluted 
environments, 
chronic 
stress, extreme poverty, or repeated 
abuse are toxic for brain development, 
and this has a lasting negative impact 
on a child’s success in life. 
It is important to continue research 
on the impact of children’s environ-
ment on early brain development and 
then to take action to provide early 
intervention 
services 
for 
children 
whose brain development is at risk. 
In fact, as Representative JACOBS 
mentioned, early childhood interven-
tion has one of the highest returns on 
investment of any investment that our 
country can make. 
Although my grandson is growing up 
in a supportive, loving, and hopefully 
chemically nontoxic environment, I 
recognize that many children in the 
United States are not. But I remain 
hopeful that we will continue to com-
bat the challenges that all of our chil-
dren face and continue to provide them 
with the best future possible. 
Ms. JACOBS of California. Madam 
Speaker, I congratulate the gentleman 
on the birth of his grandchild. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, it is 
very meaningful that we are holding this spe-
cial order today in honor of the First Focus 
Children’s 4th Annual Children’s Week. 
I would like to thank Congresswoman Sara 
Jacobs for leading today’s effort, which serves 
as a reminder that we must always be mindful 
of the needs of our nation’s children in all our 
efforts. 
As a mother and grandmother, I am inti-
mately invested in First Focus Children’s in-
valuable work to bring awareness and atten-
tion to the needs of our nation’s children, and 
I applaud recognition provided by the 4th an-
nual Children’s Week. 
This week, we celebrate the successes 
made in the fight to improve the lives of chil-
dren across the country and lament the many 
heavy burdens still weighing on the shoulders 
of our youth. 
I have been fighting on Capitol Hill for the 
rights and needs of children and families for 
over 25 years. 
Why are we still fighting for so many of the 
same things we were fighting for in 1995? 
Why in one of the richest countries in the 
world are children still going to bed hungry? 
Why are families begging for affordable 
childcare? Why are mothers and fathers 
choosing between making rent and keeping 
the lights on? 
I speak to you today with a heart full of 
grief, anger, and still unrelenting hope. 
Hope, because what are our children if not 
the promise of a better tomorrow—if we can 
only be watchful stewards of today? 
Frederick Douglas once said that ‘‘it is easi-
er to build strong children, than to repair bro-
ken men.’’ 
As the founding Chairperson of the Con-
gressional Children’s Caucus, I overwhelm-
ingly urge Congress—let us work together in 
bipartisan action. Let us build strong children. 
When passing the American Rescue Plan, 
Congress demonstrated its commitment to 
keeping children fed, cared for, and supported. 
The bill provided direct housing assistance 
and nutrition assistance for 40 million Ameri-
cans, expanded access to safe and reliable 
childcare and affordable health care, extended 
unemployment insurance so that 18 million 
American workers could pay their bills, and 
supported 27 million children with an ex-
panded Child Tax Credit. 
As a direct result of this legislation, 7.8 mil-
lion children were prevented from falling into 
poverty. 
Importantly, the American Rescue Plan 
made the provision of safe and affordable 
childcare a priority. 
At the age of 5 most American children are 
ushered into schools where they and their 
families will be provided with community and 
supports. 
And yet children under 5, who have as 
many if not more needs than their older coun-
terparts, have no such universal resources 
available to them. 
How is a caregiver expected to work to pro-
vide for their family if they have a young one 
at home? 
Each of us, whether a parent or not, has a 
stake in the success of child care in this coun-
try. 
High-quality, accessible, affordable childcare 
will allow our early learning system to provide 
opportunities for self-reliance, agency, and 
personal growth for millions of caregivers—ul-
timately leading to the success of our children 
and our national economy. 
I had the pleasure of congratulating a class 
of exemplary high school graduates in Texas 
over the weekend. 
Before receiving their accolades, regalia, 
and diplomas, these young scholars had to 
overcome many obstacles—obstacles that 
many of my fellow Congressmen did not face 
in our childhoods. 
I implore us today to absorb the impact of 
the First Focus Children’s 4th Annual Chil-
dren’s Week. 
Let us remember the core of our responsi-
bility to our nation, to create and preserve a 
future in which our country’s children can 
flourish.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. ROY) for 30 
minutes. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, it is al-
ways good to be here in a nice empty 
Chamber, the definition of debate here 
in the people’s House. But such is the 
way of our current process of debate. 
I always try to remind the American 
people that as they are no doubt all 
gathered around their living rooms 
watching C–SPAN, sitting around talk-
ing about the issues of the day that 
there are two Members of the House of 
Representatives here, and that this is 
somehow what debate looks like.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5605 
June 15, 2022 
We just passed an inauspicious mile-
stone last week in which we had the 6- 
year anniversary of not having offered 
an amendment on the floor of the 
House of Representatives in open de-
bate. Not one Member of the House of 
Representatives for the last 6 years has 
been able to go down to the desk and 
offer an amendment to change a piece 
of legislation. That is not what the 
American people think we do. They 
think we actually sit down here and 
offer an amendment and we debate and 
go through stuff, but that never hap-
pens. I think that really is kind of en-
demic of the problem why people are so 
frustrated with this town, but I think 
there is something deeper going on in 
our country, something deeper that 
merits focus. 
As the Marquis de Lafayette has fa-
mously said something along the lines 
of America is great because America is 
good. I believe that. But I am increas-
ingly curious if all Americans do. We 
have a cultural problem in this coun-
try. We should be honest. We have been 
kind of fat and happy for a while. Ro-
bust economy, generally peaceful and 
secure communities over the last sev-
eral decades, low interest rates, hous-
ing. 
But now the chickens seem to be 
coming home to roost. Interest rates 
are 
rising. 
National 
debt 
is 
sky-
rocketing. Inflation is off the charts. 
Food prices are up. Home prices are up. 
Gas prices are at $5 a gallon and rising. 
Crime is rising in our communities, big 
cities in particular but across the 
country. 
Fentanyl 
is 
pouring 
in. 
RECORD deaths. Opioid poisonings and 
overdoses. Wide open borders. The car-
tels have control of our borders. The 
price of goods and services are crushing 
American families. That is the reality 
of what we are facing right now. 
And I talk about those things a lot, 
and there is something that has been 
on my mind this week. This week for a 
lot of fathers is Father’s Day. This 
week for fans of college baseball is the 
week of the College World Series. I am 
a big fan of college baseball, as is my 
son. I brought him up here to see the 
University of Virginia play in 2014 and 
again in 2015. It is next week. We have 
got the University of Texas, my law 
school alma mater, Texas A&M Univer-
sity, and six other schools playing in 
the College World Series. 
But my pure sports love is golf. I was 
a not very good walk-on at the Univer-
sity of Virginia. Had I been better, 
then I wouldn’t be relegated to this 
Chamber. I would be out and about 
making money playing the tour. But 
alas, here I am as a Member of Con-
gress, and I am going to use floor time 
on the House of Representatives to 
talk about the PGA Tour, something I 
never really thought that I would do. It 
never really seems to rise to the level 
of something you would talk about in 
the people’s House. 
But here is the problem: Today, we 
have a few American players on the 
PGA Tour that are bolting for enor-
mous, guaranteed checks by the Saudi 
Arabian bankrolled LIV Golf league. 
Now, that catches my attention be-
cause it gets to the heart of something 
that is wrong in this country. Those in-
dividuals are doing themselves, their 
reputations, their chosen sport, and 
the American communities in which 
they have previously allegedly in-
vested, a very deep disservice in the 
process. The PGA Tour is absolutely 
right to sanction them for it. 
This week is the week of the United 
States Open Championship. It is at The 
Country Club in Brookline, Massachu-
setts. That is particularly noteworthy 
for golf fans because it is the site of an 
epic story of a young, American man, 
Francis Ouimet, who was able to win 
the United States Open unexpectedly 
back in, I think, 1913—I’m pulling that 
from my memory—over a century ago. 
It was the site of the epic comeback of 
the American Ryder Cup team in 1999 
when University of Texas Longhorn, 
Justin Leonard, sunk a 40-foot putt on 
the 17th hole. It is a historic venue 
right outside of Boston, a historic 
American city deeply rooted in our his-
tory. 
And yet, there is a cloud hanging 
over the United States Open this week. 
And that cloud is the greed and the ab-
surd self-absorbed nature of a handful 
of the PGA Tour’s elites who are will-
ing to sell their athletic soul, their 
professional soul to a Saudi Arabian 
league for their shekels. And it is abso-
lutely an abomination. 
Thankfully, most of the best players 
in the world are proudly and loudly 
holding 
firm, 
players 
like 
Rory 
McIlroy, Jordan Spieth, Justin Thom-
as, to name a few. But this issue is big-
ger than just a few players or a mere 
competition within the game of golf 
that some want to dismiss it as. 
The LIV Golf league, as I said, is be-
holden to the Saudis and helping them 
whitewash their global reputation and 
history of human rights abuses and 
supporting terrorists, the very terror-
ists that attacked America 21 years 
ago. 
The Saudi golf league is bad for pro-
fessional golf for a host of reasons, 
from the Saudi’s human rights abuses 
to the gouging of Americans on gas. 
The Saudis are not our friends. LIV is 
ignoring Saudi Arabia’s connections to 
the national tragedy of 9/11 or the 
many other grave human rights abuses 
that the country has faced over the 
years, and it is disappointing to wit-
ness. 
Handing tens of millions of dollars to 
professional 
golfers 
like 
Bryson 
DeChambeau, Dustin Johnson, and Phil 
Mickelson who can look the other way, 
ignore the questions all for their per-
sonal enrichment. What does that say 
about who we are? 
Let’s talk about the PGA Tour for a 
second. Total charitable dollars from 
the PGA Tour and its tournaments 
have totaled $3.37 billion for thousands 
of charities across this country in most 
States across the Union. $3.37 billion. 
Let me stop for a second for those 
who don’t follow golf and say, Why are 
you talking about golf on the floor of 
the House? 
There are dozens of PGA Tour events 
across this country. There is one in the 
district I represent in central Texas, 
the Valero Texas Open. The Valero 
Texas Open is the sixth oldest profes-
sional golf tournament worldwide, in-
cluding the majors, the third oldest on 
the PGA Tour not counting the majors, 
and the longest tournament held in the 
same city, the hundredth year in 2022. 
Their charitable giving is one of the 
leaders in the clubhouse on the PGA 
Tour with $209 million in total and a 
record $22 million from the 2022 tour-
nament. That is 209 million charitable 
dollars flowing in through the Valero 
Texas Open into the communities I rep-
resent. So many good things come out 
of that. 
Now, let’s talk a little bit about the 
guys that are bolting for the deep 
pockets of the Saudi Arabians. Phil 
Mickelson, famously six-time major 
winner. $133,772,000 in career earnings 
on the PGA Tour. Dustin Johnson, 
$107.5 million. Sergio Garcia, $66 mil-
lion, Bryson DeChambeau, $35 million. 
Tiger Woods, $186 million. 
Now, let me stop. Tiger said no. Tiger 
was offered, I have heard, upwards of a 
billion dollars, certainly something 
like $750 million to attach his brand 
and go join this so-called LIV Golf 
league, and he said no so far. That is 
the right thing to do. How many of us 
would have turned down $750 million or 
a billion dollars? How many of us 
would have turned that down? So far 
Tiger has turned that down, and he 
should be thanked for that. 
Rory McIlroy has had $106 million of 
earnings on the tour. Jordan Spieth 
has had $75.8 million of winnings on the 
tour. They have all said no. But not 
Phil, not Dustin, not Sergio, not 
Bryson, not a handful of others who 
have all said, I am going to go sell my 
soul for $200 million. In the case of Phil 
Mickelson, $200 million of guaranteed 
money that came from the Saudi Ara-
bians. 
How can we condone a league funded 
by the same people who orchestrated 
the 9/11 attacks, murdered journalists, 
promote 
anti-Semitism, 
and 
stage 
mass executions? 
I had family who had to work in 
Saudi Arabia; one in the State Depart-
ment, one in oil and gas. They had to 
be careful about whether they had a 
Bible with them. They had to be care-
ful about what they said, how they 
acted. My female family members had 
to be careful about where they were, 
what they were wearing, what they 
were doing. 
And now you have the 9/11 Families 
United that have spoken out against 
this LIV Golf league due to Saudi Ara-
bia’s role in training and financing the 
9/11 hijackers, 15 of whom were citizens 
of Saudi Arabia. It feels like a be-
trayal, the national chair of the 9/11 
Families United said. My husband, who

died in the 9/11 attacks, was a scratch 
golfer. He was a Phil Mickelson fan. He 
even tried to be a pro before he worked 
on Wall Street. My youngest is the cap-
tain of his golf team. Our family under-
stands the integrity that the sport re-
quires, but these guys are not inter-
ested in any of that. And that is the 
story. 
For those that are watching this or 
this clip, if you are watching this, if 
you are a golf fan, you have lived and 
breathed watching these majors over 
the 
last 
several 
decades. 
Phil 
Mickelson is about my age. When he 
was playing golf out in Arizona I was 
at the University of Virginia. We over-
lapped a couple years. He was good. I 
was terrible. Here I am. But I have 
been watching him his whole career as 
a fan. I have some friends who have 
been on tour. I have friends that are in 
the golf industry. But I am watching 
Phil Mickelson. We all cheered when he 
finally won the Masters in 2004. We 
cheered again when he won again in 
2006, and again when he won in, I think, 
2010. Then when he won the PGA Cham-
pionship last year we thought, Oh my 
gosh, he won this over the age of 50. 
That is extraordinary. He is going to be 
able to sail off into the sunset and go 
out and get the adulation he deserves 
and carry golf forward. 
Then over the last year he and all 
these others say, You know what, no, 
that is not good enough. The whole 
purpose 
of 
the 
PGA 
Tour 
is 
a 
meritocracy. You go out and earn it. 
Nobody gives you anything. It is a 
great American sport because no one 
gives you anything. 
b 1815 
You walk out on the course, you tee 
it up, and you better your peers, and 
for that you win the purse. It is what 
draws people to the sport. An indi-
vidual alone standing on the course, 
standing on a green with thousands of 
people watching, millions on TV, with 
a club in their hand and one ball and 
they have to execute. 
What does Mickelson do? What does 
Sergio do? What does Bryson do? They 
sell their reputations. They sell their 
soul for Saudi blood money, the very 
money, the same wealth funds that are 
being used to challenge our national 
security and our well-being. 
This isn’t competition, as some say. 
What are you afraid of? This is another 
tour competing with the PGA tour. 
Okay. Then go prove an economic 
model and go out and compete, but 
don’t go sell your soul to someone buy-
ing it. 
The Saudi Golf League is exhibition 
golf. As many say, the PGA tour is for 
people who want to earn their success 
in the game of golf and compete 
against the best. Importantly, as I 
said—there is an old adage: Dance with 
the one who brung ya. 
The PGA tour goes back a century. 
The game of golf is moving from the 
aristocracy of the gentlemen’s amateur 
ranks to the world of the mid-20th cen-
tury with Ben Hogan, a Texan; Byron 
Nelson, a Texan; and Sam Snead from 
Virginia, and they built a tour. 
They literally followed the sun: tour-
naments in California, tournaments in 
Florida, Texas, the South, they move 
up and they play up the East Coast. 
They follow the sun—it is a tour—and 
they made peanuts. They did it for the 
love of the game. They did it building 
a league. They came out in the six-
ties—Arnie’s 
Army—Arnold 
Palmer 
and Jack Nicklaus, and they built this 
tour up to what I just said, $3.37 billion 
in charitable giving. 
In communities across the country— 
the Valero Texas Open, which I rep-
resent. All of the great spots around 
this country: Pebble Beach, Riviera, 
Colonial in Fort Worth. These are inte-
gral in our communities. These guys 
just walk away. Whatever. I don’t care 
about building up the next generation. 
I don’t care about what this sport 
means. I don’t care about the fact that 
the PGA tour has to compete against 
the NFL, the Major League Baseball, 
the NBA, NHL, all the other forms of 
entertainment, college football, college 
basketball. 
No. No. I want to look out for me. I 
want to look out for myself. I am going 
to go take $200 million in guaranteed 
money—or $120 million in guaranteed 
money, if you are Dustin Johnson, $20 
to $30 million for Ian Poulter, and $100 
million if you are Bryson DeChambeau. 
Getting guaranteed money so you 
can go play golf with not the best— 
with money that came from Saudi Ara-
bia, the purpose of which is to target 
and disrupt the PGA tour, and nothing 
more. It is an absolute embarrassment. 
As I said before, as I sit here on the 
floor of the House, why am I spending 
time on this? First of all, I have great 
passion for it as a personal matter. I 
have devoted a lot of my life to this 
sport. I love it. I teach my kid this 
sport. It is a sport based on honor. It is 
a sport based on integrity. 
That is why things like The First Tee 
program are valuable. You learn the 
rules. You follow the rules. It is a 
meritocracy. You win by going to the 
course and beating the course. You 
treat each other with respect. It is a 
great sport. Now these guys are just 
throwing that away. Throwing the 
honor of your commitment to an enti-
ty, an organization, that made you 
wealthy for playing a game; you throw 
that away to go kiss the ring of Saudi 
royalty and get your check. Go cash 
your check. 
Is that what life is all about? Is that 
where we are? I started this talking 
about America is great because Amer-
ica is good. Well, what is good about 
that? I am all for competition. I am all 
for people prospering and succeeding 
based on their skills and their talents: 
starting a business, playing a sport, 
whatever they are, artists. Go forward 
and sell your product. 
You want to go start a rival league, 
a Canadian football league that com-
petes with the NFL. We had the USFL 
for a while. Way back in the day we 
had the NBA and the ABA. We had the 
NFL and then we had the AFL, then 
they merged. We got the NFL with an 
NFC and AFC. I get that. Time 
changed. 
But you are going to go sell your soul 
to the Saudis? Have some self-respect. 
Actually stand up for the sport that 
you said you love, and you want to 
share with the world. Stand alongside 
the tour, the sports franchise, that ac-
tually is building up the game, cre-
ating development leagues like the 
Korn Ferry Tour, which was built out 
of the Hogan tour, helping our commu-
nities across the country. 
One last point of all this. I have 
heard the former President, President 
Trump, endorsing the LIV Golf League. 
Could that possibly be because Trump 
National Doral or Trump National Golf 
Club Bedminster in New Jersey will 
host tournaments? I suspect so. Sure as 
heck not because it is an advocacy for 
what is good for the sport. It is not an 
advocacy for the tour that has allowed 
those individuals to be elevated and 
compete against the sports that get, 
frankly, greater notoriety. 
Here is what is interesting about 
what the tour has done. These are the 
highest paid athletes of all time, as re-
ported by Sportico: Number two, Tiger 
Woods, $2.1 billion—this is all in, en-
dorsements and dollars earned; Arnold 
Palmer at $1.5 billion at number 3; 
Jack Nicklaus at number 4 with $1.38 
billion; Phil Mickelson, $1 billion; Greg 
Norman, $815 million. These guys are 
all in the top 15. 
The 
tour 
has 
made 
these 
guys 
wealthy, and they turn around and 
they stab the tour in the back to go 
chase their 30 shekels. It is absolutely 
unconscionable. 
I stand with the tour. I stand with 
the players that I mentioned before, 
the 
Jordan 
Spieths, 
the 
Justin 
Thomases, the Rory McIlroys, the guys 
that are standing up and saying: No 
thanks, I am going to stick with the 
tour, I am going to dance with the one 
who brung ya. 
I stand up for the tour events 
throughout this country that are rais-
ing millions of dollars for charity, pro-
viding jobs, providing economic growth 
and activity. And, importantly, stand-
ing up for this great sport, this great 
institution. As we sit here in U.S. Open 
week, what I believe is the greatest 
golf tournament in the world because 
it is open to anyone who can compete. 
If you can go string together seven 
rounds of golf, you can be the United 
States Open champion. In the spirit of 
the country club right outside of 
Brookline, and the story of Francis 
Ouimet—made into a movie, by the 
way—that is the spirit of what you can 
do in America if you just set out to go 
do it. 
The Good Book in Luke 12:48 says: To 
whom much is given, much is expected, 
much is demanded—depending on your 
translation. 
These guys have made hundreds of 
millions of dollars playing a game.

They owe the respect to the tour and to 
the guys they play alongside. They owe 
to the communities that have enriched 
them and rallied around them, their 
courtesy of defending and standing up 
for the sport and the league and the 
PGA tour in this country that has en-
abled them to prosper and has helped 
grow this game into one of the great 
economic engines and sport franchises 
in the world. 
Shame on them for walking away 
from the PGA tour. God bless the PGA 
tour for pushing back and saying: You 
don’t get to do that. God bless the 
members of the tour that are standing 
strong, standing alongside the commu-
nity members, standing alongside all of 
the sponsors and the people that have 
made that work and have built such a 
great institution. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
f 
SOCIAL SECURITY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. LAR-
SON) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam 
Speaker, it is an honor to be here this 
evening with you and to talk about— 
during this time of the COVID pan-
demic—something that is near and 
dear to the hearts of the people im-
pacted the most by this pandemic. 
Madam Speaker, as you know, more 
than a million people now have per-
ished because of the COVID pandemic, 
and 750,000 of them are American citi-
zens over the age of 65. In addition, be-
cause of the war in Ukraine, because of 
this pandemic, and because of this in-
flation, who is the group in America 
that is most impacted by the pandemic 
and the ensuing inflation? It is the sen-
ior citizens of our country, and it is 
people over the age of 65. They are peo-
ple who are on fixed income. 
These individuals need the help of 
the United States Congress. I commend 
Chairman RICH NEAL, chairman of the 
Ways and Means Committee, and a So-
cial Security recipient himself, who 
knows and understands the necessity 
and the absolute dependence that so 
many of our fellow Americans have on 
the Nation’s number one insurance pro-
gram. 
The insurance program that keeps 
our seniors off of poverty. It also hap-
pens to be the number one insurance 
plan for children. Madam Speaker, it is 
the number one plan for veterans who 
rely more on Social Security Disability 
than they do the VA. 
For more than half of our fellow citi-
zens who are on Social Security, it is 
the only benefit that they have. That 
benefit, on average, is $16,000 per indi-
vidual. Nobody gets wealthy on Social 
Security. Yet, it is our number one 
anti-poverty program for the elderly. It 
is the number one anti-poverty pro-
gram for children. It has incredible 
benefits for people on disability, like 
our veterans. 
Yet, here today, and just last Thurs-
day, and before that, we learn of new 
plans from the Republican Study Com-
mittee and from Senator SCOTT—these 
are plans that will end Social Security. 
These are plans that say in 5 years 
these benefits will disappear. 
The Ways and Means Committee has 
a bill to say: No, this is not the time to 
end Social Security, this is the time to 
enhance the benefits in Social Secu-
rity. This is the time when our fellow 
seniors, who need this money to sus-
tain themselves at base levels, are cry-
ing out for help from their country. 
This is not the time, Senator SCOTT, 
for us to kill Social Security. It is not 
the time, I say to the Republican 
Study Committee, for us to end Social 
Security, cutting its benefits. For 
every year you call upon someone to 
raise the age of Social Security, that is 
a 7 percent cut. 
How in God’s name, in the face of 
this pandemic and with people living 
longer, do they need lesser benefits? 
b 1830 
Madam Speaker, if you listen to the 
logic that people are living longer so 
we have to hike the age, how does that 
possibly benefit someone struggling to 
make ends meet? Those are the same 
people who are putting food back on 
the shelves or can’t afford their pre-
scription drugs. 
How does that allow them to subsist 
by cutting their benefits because they 
are living longer? 
Democrats have a plan, and basically 
that is what Congress should be all 
about: the vitality of ideas and placing 
those ideas side by each. 
While the Republican Study Com-
mittee has said that, yes, they have a 
plan, it is former Congressman Sam 
Johnson’s plan to make sure that So-
cial Security is solvent. I served with 
Sam Johnson. There is no more honor-
able person who served in this body. 
His bill was never allowed to be 
brought forward by the Republican 
leadership. There was never a vote on 
that. The reason there was never a vote 
on it was because it cut benefits. It 
made Social Security solvent by cut-
ting benefits. That is not the way to fix 
Social Security. 
Social Security does not need to be 
cut. The benefits need to be enhanced. 
More than 3 million of our fellow 
Americans receive below-poverty-level 
checks from Social Security after they 
have paid into Social Security for a 
lifetime, Madam Speaker. That is flat- 
out wrong. 
The COLA for Social Security has 
been so ineffective that it is long over-
due to have a change that embraces a 
COLA based on the actual expenses 
that seniors incur, whether that is 
heating and cooling their home or pay-
ing for home heating oil or just simply 
paying for their pharmaceuticals. It is 
long overdue that Congress enhances 
the benefits of Social Security so that 
people can subsist and survive. 
Nobody is getting wealthy on Social 
Security or reserving a condo in Flor-
ida with the money they receive from 
this. These are people who are strug-
gling to make ends meet. 
Congressman NEAL’s committee on 
social equity most recently pointed 
out, as well, that the equity and the 
difference between what people of color 
and specifically women of color receive 
in terms of benefits is appalling. They 
receive 
below-poverty-level 
checks 
after contributing to the program their 
entire life. 
Poverty level is $12,600. 
How would you subsist on less than 
that, Madam Speaker? 
Americans need to rise up. They need 
to understand that what we need now 
during this pandemic and during this 
time of inflation is to assist people so 
that they get the money that they need 
to make the payments they richly de-
serve. 
That is why the proposal before the 
Ways and Means Committee enhances 
benefits. It provides a 2 percent across- 
the-board increase. It makes sure that 
nobody can retire into poverty, and it 
makes the new floor for Social Secu-
rity 125 percent of what the poverty 
level is. It makes sure that a new 
COLA is instituted, and, yes, it also 
makes sure, as President Biden has 
called for, the repeal of WEP and GPO. 
Where is the Republican plan? 
Their committee says that they are 
following Sam Johnson, and yet the 
subcommittee has never received a bill 
in the last 4 years that would indicate 
what their plan of action is—though it 
is detailed here, as Mr. SCOTT has out-
lined, to end Social Security in 5 years. 
Ending Social Security—killing Social 
Security—is not any way to help out 
those citizens—those fellow Ameri-
cans—who need this assistance the 
most. 
It is long overdue in this Chamber 
and also in the Senate. And even 
though MITCH MCCONNELL may stand 
up and deny that they are going to 
take forward Senator SCOTT’s proposal, 
he very smugly says when asked what 
his agenda is that they don’t have an 
agenda. They will tell the American 
voters what their agenda is after they 
win. 
America can take it to the bank, 
Madam Speaker: just like they did 
under the Biden administration, they 
are coming for your Social Security 
and Medicare. They outline it in no un-
certain terms, both in Senator SCOTT’s 
proposal and also in the Republican 
Study Group’s proposal as well. 
They are coming after your Social 
Security at a time when Americans 
need it most. 
There is a difference. Democrats are 
here to recognize that it has been 51 
years since Congress has enhanced So-
cial Security. It has been 51 years since 
Congress has done anything to enhance 
the number one insurance program for 
our elderly and the number one insur-
ance plan for our children. 
It also is the Nation’s most effective 
program. I hail from a part of the coun-
try that is an insurance center, and

there they know what a 99 percent loss 
ratio means. What that means is that 
Social Security has been able to oper-
ate, function, and be the most efficient 
governmental agency because it does 
so with less than 1 percent administra-
tive costs to make sure that Americans 
receive the benefits that they need. 
The truth of the matter is that the 
Social Security Administration needs 
more funding so that they can become 
more efficient because this pandemic 
has also hit both governmental em-
ployees as well as it has our citizens 
and has made servicing more chal-
lenging, which is all the more reason 
for government not to be talking about 
cutting Social Security, as our Repub-
lican colleagues are, but enhancing So-
cial Security so that both administra-
tively and individually people are get-
ting the services that they need and 
that they richly deserve. It has been 51 
years since Congress has taken any 
positive action to enhance people’s 
benefits. 
Madam Speaker, a gallon of milk 
cost 72 cents in 1971. Look at the cost 
today. Look at the burden that people 
on fixed incomes have. 
Help is on the way. The Ways and 
Means Committee will mark up and 
send to the floor Social Security 2100: 
A Sacred Trust. A sacred trust is what 
President Biden labeled Social Secu-
rity because the American people un-
derstand this. 
How do they know? 
It is simple. We don’t have to go back 
to 1935 and Franklin Delano Roosevelt. 
We only have to go back to 2008 and 
2009, during the Great Recession, when 
people saw their 401(k) become a 101(k). 
Yet during that same time period, So-
cial Security never missed a payment— 
not a pension payment, not a spousal 
payment, not a dependent child pay-
ment, and not a disability payment. 
It is America’s number one insurance 
program. It is America’s most efficient 
and effective program, and it needs to 
be enhanced. It needs to be augmented 
with benefits that haven’t been ad-
justed in 51 years. 
During this same time period—and 
we could go back, as Chairman NEAL 
often talks about, to the S&L crisis. 
What happened during that? 
People at the bottom lost everything. 
People at the top managed to protect 
their benefits and pensions. And the 
same was true in 2008 and 2009. People 
who endured that recession saw their 
401(k)s become a 101(k)s. People at the 
top kept their pensions and benefits. 
Thank 
God 
for 
Social 
Security. 
Americans understand this, and that is 
why they overwhelmingly—Democrats, 
Republicans, and Independents—sup-
port enhancing these benefits. 
Madam Speaker, how can you go 
home to your district in this pandemic 
during this time and say to your broth-
ers, your sisters, your mothers, fathers, 
aunts and uncles, the people you work 
with, the people in your community 
whom you go to church with, that no, 
this is the time to cut benefits? 
This is the time we should end Social 
Security in 5 years? 
This is the time we should raise the 
age so that you can’t receive benefits? 
How about we do something simple? 
How about we vote to enhance Social 
Security? The simple thing is to vote. 
If you agree with Senator SCOTT’s 
proposal to end Social Security, then 
by all means vote for it. Put it out 
there. Let’s contrast the programs: the 
Democratic initiative to enhance So-
cial Security and the Republican posi-
tion to cut the benefits. 
It would be great to have people join 
together, as we often do here, and come 
up with a solution; but instead, we 
have been waiting for 4 years now on 
the Social Security Subcommittee and 
haven’t received a single piece of legis-
lation that would address this, that 
outlines these bills, and that says ex-
actly what they would do to enhance 
Social Security. 
Instead, as has been reported in the 
news, what these proposals do is end 
Social Security or cut Social Security. 
That is death by 1,000 slashes. 
Whom are they hurting? 
Whom are they slashing here? 
Our fellow American citizens. 
So if we want to come together, we 
are open. We have accepted many good 
ideas that have come forward with re-
gard to enhancing Social Security. 
Congress hasn’t done its responsi-
bility. There is nothing the President 
can do through executive authority 
and nothing the Supreme Court is 
going to act on. 
b 1845 
This requires congressional action. 
The American people are watching, and 
either these bodies, the House and Sen-
ate, are going to take action or they 
are going to doom people to Senator 
SCOTT’s proposal to end Social Security 
in 5 years. 
The Republican Study Committee 
said this is immoral, that Social Secu-
rity, if nothing was done, would be cut 
by 24 percent in 2034. They propose 
raising the age and cutting people’s 
benefits in order to make Social Secu-
rity solvent. 
That is not the way to make the sys-
tem solvent, on the backs of American 
people who are already overburdened 
and suffering. 
In this time of inflation, let us make 
sure that we are sending the relief to 
the people who need it the most, people 
who have worked all their lives, paid 
into a system, and understand that this 
is an earned benefit. 
Rise up, America. Let your elected 
representatives in the Senate and 
House know that help is on the way, 
and either you are for enhancing bene-
fits to deal with inflation during this 
pandemic or you are for cutting them. 
Let your message ring loud and clear 
to elected officials who are about to 
vote on this very important agenda. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican leader is recog-
nized. 
INFLATION 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
American families are being crushed by 
a giant backdoor inflation tax, and it 
has been fueled, in large part, by 
Democrats’ huge mistakes. 
Month after month, families pick up 
the newspaper, flip on the television, 
and hear that Democrats’ inflation is 
setting new 40-year records. 
Month after month, families find 
themselves shelling out hundreds upon 
hundreds of extra dollars per month 
just to actually tread water. Forget 
about saving and getting ahead. 
In 
this 
Democrat-run 
economy, 
working Americans have to shell out 
hundreds of extra dollars every month 
just to remain standing still. Even 
when you factor in the nominal pay 
raises that workers have earned, the 
average American worker got a 3.9 per-
cent pay cut—pay cut—last year due to 
Democrats’ inflation. 
According to the Joint Economic 
Committee, inflation cost the average 
American household $635 last month 
alone—$635 in 1 month. 
For families in Colorado, combined 
effects of Democrats’ inflation and 
higher household spending put that 
number at a staggering $825. In Ari-
zona, it is $733 extra per month. In Ne-
vada it is $731. For New Hampshire 
families, it is $653. It is $599 in Wash-
ington State, and $598 in Georgia. 
Everybody knows why this is. Food 
costs are up more than 10 percent, year 
on year. Gas is up nearly—listen to 
this—50 percent. Rent is at a 35-year 
high, and would-be home buyers are 
being squeezed between high prices and 
soaring interest rates. 
In my home State, Kentucky, that 
monthly inflation bill comes out to 
more than $500 every month. 
Right before Senate Democrats spent 
$2 trillion last spring, the Democratic 
leader said he wasn’t worried—wasn’t 
worried—about the possibility of infla-
tion. Now, working families are paying 
dearly for that incredibly bad judg-
ment. 
I hear from hard-working Kentuck-
ians who are falling behind on home 
payments or late on their utility bills

S2948 
June 15, 2022 
or cutting back at the grocery store, 
families who are skipping—literally 
skipping—summer vacation. 
Every month, the average Kentucky 
household now spends over $500 more 
than they did before the Biden Presi-
dency. 
One of my constituents from Beaver 
Dam wrote to tell me: 
Things are looking pretty grim for me and 
my family right now. Everything— 
Everything. 
—is too expensive. 
His family was already giving up 
buying chicken and beef at the grocery 
store. Next they may have to stop 
making car payments. They are lit-
erally out of slack. 
Another constituent from Science 
Hill told me that his family is maxing 
out credit cards to stay above water. 
He is watching as the Democrats who 
control Congress continue—continue— 
to advocate for more reckless spending 
and laments that Washington does not 
appear to understand what is hap-
pening—what 
is 
happening—to 
our 
heartland. 
A third constituent from Paint Lick 
is struggling because—clarifies that 
she is not asking for a handout because 
she doesn’t believe it would help. 
‘‘After all,’’ she writes, ‘‘money is not 
free; taxpayers must pay it back.’’ If 
only Washington Democrats had that 
much wisdom. If only our one-party 
government had exercised that much 
common sense back last spring. 
Three of the most basic duties that 
any government owes its citizens are 
stable prices, public safety, and secure 
borders—stable prices, public safety, 
and secure borders. 
Unfortunately for our country, the 
Democrats have struck out—struck 
out—swinging. 
POLITICAL VIOLENCE 
Mr. President, now on a completely 
different matter, yesterday marked 5 
years since the attempted assassina-
tion of numerous Congressmen on a 
baseball field across the river. 
The perpetrator was a far-left activ-
ist who doublechecked that it was Re-
publicans on the field before he started 
shooting. 
Five years on, political violence and 
threats are again making national 
headlines. The far left has spent weeks 
fomenting rage and panic over the pos-
sibility that one or more upcoming Su-
preme Court rulings may not deliver 
the liberal policy outcomes they would 
prefer. 
Last week, the authorities arrested a 
deranged person who traveled to Wash-
ington from California with a premedi-
tated plan to assassinate an Associate 
Justice for ideological reasons—fruit of 
a toxic culture that is fueled by the 
precedent-breaking leak of a draft 
opinion last month and a torrent of 
reckless talk from prominent Demo-
crats. 
It took that assassination attempt 
and then another week of wasted— 
wasted—time for House Democrats to 
stop slow-walking a bipartisan bill to 
beef up Supreme Court security that 
passed the Senate unanimously more 
than a month ago. The same people— 
the same people—fanning the flames of 
fear and anger blocked that non-
controversial bill for more than a 
month—more than a month—before 
they finally sent it to the President. 
Meanwhile, as mobs continue to 
mount angry demonstrations outside 
these Justices’ private family homes, 
President Biden’s Department of Jus-
tice continues to assiduously ignore— 
ignore—the fact that this is totally il-
legal now under existing law. Section 
1507 of the Criminal Code makes it per-
fectly clear: It is flat-out illegal to 
demonstrate at a judge’s private family 
residence to pressure them in a pending 
case. That is the fact set that we have 
here. It is not just immoral; it is not 
just civically toxic; it is literally a 
Federal crime. 
Where is Attorney General Garland? 
As the former chief judge of the DC 
Circuit, he should understand the need 
for judicial security and independence 
as well as anyone. But the same soft- 
on-crime ethos that pervades the mod-
ern Democratic Party apparently ex-
tends even—even—to ignoring illegal 
pressure campaigns aimed at Federal 
judges. 
Two years ago, a New Jersey judge 
had a gunman show up to her front 
door in disguise and murder her son. 
Just recently, somebody murdered a 
retired judge in Wisconsin, and then 
last week’s near assassination. But 
where is President Biden? He won’t 
even denounce the ongoing protests at 
Justices’ private homes, and our sup-
posedly nonpolitical Attorney General 
will not lift a finger—a finger—to en-
force existing Federal law. 
Today, every Republican member of 
the Judiciary Committee and I are 
sending 
another—another—letter 
to 
Attorney General Garland. His derelic-
tion of duty on this subject must come 
to an end. 
The far-left political violence and in-
timidation efforts do not stop with 
judges. In the weeks since the draft 
opinion suggested the Court may— 
may—overturn an abortion decision 
that even Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg 
acknowledged was poorly reasoned, a 
spate of vandalism, threats, and even 
some arson attacks have been un-
leashed upon Catholic churches—upon 
Catholic churches—and pro-life crisis 
pregnancy centers all around the coun-
try. In 2022, simply being a Christian or 
being pro-life seems to be sufficient 
cause for angry radicals to call in 
threats, graffiti your door, or firebomb 
your office. Once again, President 
Biden and his Justice Department have 
been totally silent—not word about 
any of it; unable to even simply de-
nounce the hatred. 
The same Democrats who want to 
make a national spectacle out of their 
supposed opposition to political vio-
lence will not even call out violence 
and intimidation from their own side, 
let alone—let alone—fulfill their oaths 
and put a stop to it. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The majority leader is recognized. 
H.R. 3967 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, we 
continue a productive week here on the 
Senate floor. 
Today, the Senate will take another 
step closer to passing the largest vet-
erans’ healthcare bill in decades, the 
Honoring our PACT Act. In a few mo-
ments, the Senate will vote to adopt 
the substitute amendment and then 
immediately vote on cloture on the 
bill, bringing us to the brink of passing 
this long-sought piece of legislation. 
Frankly, the Senate should come to 
an agreement to finish the PACT Act 
work A-S-A-P. We should pass this bill 
as soon as we can and finally tell our 
veterans that the long wait for their 
well-earned benefits is over. 
Let me say it again. 
There is no reason not to finish the 
PACT Act A-S-A-P. Our Nation’s vet-
erans have waited long enough for this 
bill. Since 9/11, nearly 3.5 million vet-
erans have been exposed to toxic burn 
pits in the line of duty. Scores of 
Americans went off to serve our coun-
try in perfect health only to come back 
home and get sick from toxic exposure, 
and when many of these veterans ap-
plied to the VA for healthcare benefits, 
they oftentimes discovered that they 
didn’t qualify. 
It is a confounding indignity for our 
Nation’s heroes to sacrifice everything 
for our country only to come home, get 
sick, and discover that the VA ain’t 
there for them—they have to fend for 
themselves. 
What kind of message does it send to 
future veterans when we can’t guar-
antee they will get the healthcare ben-
efits they rightfully deserve and when 
the VA will not deal with injuries that 
occurred on the battlefield because of 
toxic burn pits and other issues? With 
the PACT Act, we have a chance to an-
swer that question with a resounding 
yes. 
Question: Well, if I enlist, am I going 
to really be taken care of when my 
service is complete? 
We are going to have a chance to an-
swer that question with a resounding 
yes. Yes, we will take care of you. Yes, 
we will make sure you can live healthy 
and dignified lives. Yes, we will keep 
our promise to protect our veterans 
just as they have sacrificed everything 
for us. 
No great nation can dare afford to 
turn its back on the multitudes who 
have served our country. No veterans

should ever have to carry the burden of 
treating complications from toxic ex-
posure all by themselves, and we can 
change that simply with a vote on this 
bill. 
Let us pass the PACT Act with all 
due haste. We have a moral obligation 
in the Chamber to get this done. 
NOMINATIONS 
Now, Mr. President, on the nomina-
tions front, we are moving ahead with 
confirming President Biden’s critical 
and well-qualified nominees. 
Later today, we will vote on the con-
firmation of Alan Leventhal to serve as 
the U.S. Ambassador to Denmark. 
Later this week, once we conclude 
the PACT Act, we will also move for-
ward on the nomination of Mary Boyle 
for the Consumer Product Safety Com-
mission, whose confirmation would 
give that Agency a Democratic major-
ity. 
We will also soon vote to confirm an-
other historic judicial nominee, Ana 
Isabel de Alba, to serve as a district 
judge for the Eastern District of Cali-
fornia. Judge de Alba will be the first 
ever Latina to serve as a Federal judge 
in California’s Eastern District, joining 
the more than 65 qualified judicial 
nominees that this majority has con-
firmed under President Biden. 
I am proud of the historic progress 
this Senate Democratic majority has 
made in confirming well-qualified and 
diverse nominees to the executive 
branch, to independent boards, and to 
the Federal bench, and we are going to 
keep going. 
GUN LEGISLATION 
Mr. President, on gun safety, Demo-
crats and Republicans continue nego-
tiations over the legislative text for 
the first major gun safety bill to pass 
the Senate in 30 years. 
Just a few weeks ago, such an effort 
would have seemed unimaginable. If 
there were any issue that encapsulates 
the gridlock of the past few decades, 
gun safety would be near the very top 
of the list. For too long, Americans 
have gotten used to a frustrating pat-
tern—tragedy strikes; families grieve; 
but gridlock in the Senate ensues. 
Perhaps this time—hopefully, this 
time—it will be different. Many in this 
Chamber are working, right now, in the 
hopes that it will be different. We are 
not over the finish line yet, but there 
is a real hunger to finally accomplish 
what has escaped the Senate for far too 
long: passing meaningful gun safety re-
form. 
Again, not too long ago, this debate 
would have been hard to have fath-
omed, but despite the long odds, we 
gave negotiators space to do their 
work. I am glad we did because we now 
have the best chance in decades to act 
on gun violence. I spoke to both Sen-
ators MURPHY and CORNYN this morn-
ing. They are eager to get the text 
completed. There will be meetings all 
day long in the hopes that we can get 
the text done so we can put it on the 
floor as soon as possible and get it 
passed. If we can prevent even one 
death from gun violence in the future, 
our efforts at this moment will have 
been worth it. 
Gun safety is near and dear to my 
heart. As the Acting President pro 
tempore knows, three decades ago, I 
was a proud author of the Brady Bill in 
Congress, which won the support of 
many Republicans and even law en-
forcement. Back then, I argued we had 
to get something done because the 
American people were sick and tired of 
the insanity and inaction of gun vio-
lence as much as they are today. After 
years of trying, we succeeded back 
then, but it wasn’t on the first try. Yet 
we enacted a bill that, very likely, 
saved tens of thousands of lives. There 
are many, many people—thousands or 
tens of thousands in all likelihood— 
walking the streets today because we 
passed the Brady Law. 
Today, the American people are simi-
larly sick and tired of the insanity of 
the gun violence happening every day 
across the country. Just thinking 
about all of the shootings we have suf-
fered over the years is exhausting and 
debilitating: 
Columbine, 
Virginia, 
Sandy Hook, Parkland, Las Vegas, Or-
lando, El Paso, Charleston, Atlanta, 
Buffalo, Uvalde. The list keeps going 
on and growing. The American people 
have had enough. They want us to 
move forward. 
If the Senate can come up with a bill 
that embraces the bipartisan frame-
work, we are going to save lives. I 
promise that, once the text is done, I 
will put it on the floor as soon as pos-
sible, so I encourage my colleagues to 
keep working. As I mentioned, our Sen-
ators on both sides of the aisle will be 
working diligently all day to try and 
come up with the final text as soon as 
possible. We don’t know the next time 
we will have a chance to make mean-
ingful progress on gun violence, so we 
have every reason in the world to get 
to yes. 
ELECTIONS 
Mr. President, on the elections of 
last night and election deniers, a year 
and a half after the 2020 election, Don-
ald Trump’s Big Lie is alive and well, 
unfortunately. 
Last night, hard-right candidates 
who believe the last Presidential elec-
tion was stolen—it is so incorrect, with 
no factual basis. But these people with 
these beliefs were elevated into the 
general election. Many of these can-
didates are running in critical swing 
States and running for offices that will 
have outsized influence in managing 
future elections. 
The example of Nevada’s secretary of 
state race is especially bone chilling. 
Jim Marchant—a far-right radical, who 
openly believes that the 2020 election 
results were illegitimate, who believes 
the Big Lie—is now running to be the 
top elections official in Nevada. Mr. 
Marchant 
is 
someone 
who 
openly 
thinks Donald Trump should be the 
President right now, and if he wins in 
November, he will be Nevada’s most 
important election official and would 
pose a direct threat—a direct threat— 
to the democratic process in that 
State. 
He must be rejected by the people of 
every political persuasion. It doesn’t 
matter if you are a Democrat or a Re-
publican or an Independent, a liberal or 
a conservative or a moderate. Democ-
racy is at risk if we elevate individuals 
who don’t believe in the sanctity of 
elections. 
That 
is 
the 
road 
to 
authoritarianism, to dictatorship. This 
isn’t 
a 
partisan 
argument. 
Under-
mining democracy endangers all of us— 
Democrats, Republicans, Independents. 
If the proponents of the Big Lie are 
elected to office, they pose a direct 
threat to our democratic way of life. 
The January 6 hearings have made it 
abundantly clear that even Donald 
Trump’s inner circle knew the Big Lie 
was utter garbage, so it is nothing 
short of horrifying to see that radicals 
who profess the Big Lie are gaining 
strength across the country. 
I urge the American people to reject 
the credo of lies pushed by Donald 
Trump and his cronies and, whatever 
your party, to vote this November for 
men and women who will safeguard our 
democracy and preserve the sanctity of 
our elections. Without it, our country 
could be on the road to ruin. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Affairs Committee and the expanded 
support we are delivering for veterans 
living with illnesses as a result of toxic 
exposure due to their service in our Na-
tion’s uniform through the Sergeant 
First Class Heath Robinson Honoring 
our Promise to Address Comprehensive 
Toxics Act of 2022. This legislation en-
sures veterans who need help now can 
get it. We are all too familiar with the 
challenges that exist for veterans as a 
result of toxic exposure.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2950 
June 15, 2022 
I have been working to improve vet-
eran services and benefits for more 
than 20 years as a member of both the 
Senate and the House VA Committees. 
During that time, I have heard a lot 
about toxic exposure issues and have 
come to understand the immediate 
need to make improvement to benefits 
and care for post-9/11 veterans who 
were exposed to toxic substances as a 
result of burn pits. This exposure is 
known to cause serious illness, includ-
ing rare cancers and respiratory ail-
ments. Those suffering deserve to know 
they have not been forgotten and their 
voices have been heard. 
The promise our Nation made to the 
men and women who served in these 
dangerous conditions must be kept. 
This bill fulfills that promise and de-
livers immediate access to healthcare 
for toxic-exposed veterans. It directs 
the VA to evaluate diseases for pre-
sumption of service connection and 
streamlines the process for toxic-ex-
posed veterans seeking disability com-
pensation for their illnesses without 
overwhelming the VA system. The Ser-
geant 
First 
Class 
Heath 
Robinson 
PACT Act also invests in the tools and 
resources to help the VA process dis-
ability claims in a timely manner and 
deliver quality healthcare to veterans 
living with toxic exposure illnesses. 
With this measure, we continue to 
correct past failures of the VA to pro-
vide healthcare and benefits to pre-
vious generations exposed to Agent Or-
ange as well. These challenges have ex-
isted for decades, and it is time we ful-
fill our promise to Vietnam-era vet-
erans once and for all. 
The legislation we are poised to ap-
prove updates VA policies to provide 
veterans like Bill Rhodes of Mena, 
AK—a marine who served in Thailand 
during the Vietnam war era—provide 
them access to the care he and the oth-
ers who served in that area deserve. 
Mr. Rhodes has been a relentless advo-
cate of toxic exposure benefits. 
The VA accepts that herbicides were 
used along the perimeter of military 
bases in Thailand but does not recog-
nize the impact of the herbicides inside 
the perimeter. This current policy 
makes no sense and is not fair, pre-
venting veterans like Mr. Rhodes from 
accessing benefits as a result of toxic 
exposure. 
After developing illnesses linked to 
herbicide exposure, Mr. Rhodes turned 
to the VA for help, but his claim was 
denied. I have been working with him 
for several years to advance a provision 
that corrects this mistake, and I am 
pleased that this act eliminates the bu-
reaucratic hurdles that have stood in 
the way of veterans getting the care 
they earned. 
This legislation is the result of bipar-
tisan cooperation. We can achieve 
great things for our country when we 
put partisan politics aside. I appreciate 
the leadership of Chairman TESTER and 
Ranking Member MORAN to get this 
bill to the Senate floor. I am proud to 
work with them to address these press-
ing needs that face our veterans and 
their families. 
I would also like to recognize and 
thank the countless veterans, the fami-
lies, advocates, and veteran service or-
ganizations that continued their per-
sistence to ensure Congress fulfills its 
promise to the men and the women 
who served in our Nation’s uniform. 
This legislation is long overdue. We 
have heard the struggles of veterans 
and their families living with toxic ex-
posure-related illnesses. We can end 
the hurdles they experienced and save 
lives by passing this landmark legisla-
tion. I encourage my colleagues to join 
me in supporting it. 
With that, I suggest the absence of a 
quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that I be allowed to 
speak for up to 5 minutes, followed by 
the Senator from Montana, Senator 
TESTER, for up to 5 minutes, prior to 
the scheduled rollcall votes. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, thank 
you for the opportunity to address the 
U.S. Senate and the American people. 
In a few moments, the Senate will 
vote on the Tester-Moran Sergeant 
First Class Heath Robinson Honoring 
our PACT Act. 
For far too long—way far too long— 
our Nation’s veterans have been living 
with chronic illnesses as a result of ex-
posures during their time in uniform. 
Today, we are continuing to take the 
steps necessary to right this wrong 
with our legislation that will provide 
veterans and their families with the 
healthcare and benefits that they have 
earned and that they deserve. 
In March, Secretary McDonough tes-
tified before our committee, the Senate 
Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, and he 
stated that the House toxic exposure 
bill needed additional work before 
being brought to the full Senate for a 
vote. Because of the improvements we 
have made in the House bill, the VA 
Secretary yesterday told our com-
mittee that he can now ‘‘certify’’ this 
legislation will be implemented with-
out negative operational impacts on 
existing 
disability 
claims 
and 
healthcare for veterans. 
All along, I have had concern about 
the consequences of this legislation 
and the volume of cases that the VA 
will now encounter, what it may mean 
for those veterans as well as veterans 
who need VA care and benefits who are 
not 
toxic-exposed. 
Secretary 
McDonough yesterday went on to say: 
‘‘We’re ready for it, we’ve been pre-
paring for this. . . . I think we can do 
this and do it well and in all cases do 
it transparently.’’ 
While I appreciate the Secretary’s as-
surance, our committee must continue 
its oversight of the VA and make cer-
tain that this bill is implemented cor-
rectly and that all those with toxic ex-
posure and all veterans can rely upon 
the 
system 
for 
benefits 
and 
for 
healthcare. We still have our work cut 
out as a Congress, as a Senate, to make 
sure that the promises that are made 
in this bill are promises that are kept 
and that the promises that are made to 
other veterans are kept. 
This bill is designed to fix a broken 
system that has been cobbled together 
over decades of patchwork fixes. Con-
gress has been trying to solve these 
problems. The Department of Veterans 
Affairs has been trying to solve these 
problems. Finally, we bring together a 
solution that should make things sig-
nificantly better for many. 
While I continue to insist my GOP 
colleagues should be allowed to offer 
and debate and to vote on amendments, 
it is time to advance the Tester-Moran 
substitute and bring us one step closer 
to connecting all generations of toxic- 
exposed veterans with the care they 
need and they deserve and to provide 
veterans with certainty and support. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Montana. 
Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I want 
to start my remarks by expressing my 
appreciation 
for 
Ranking 
Member 
MORAN’s leadership. It has been stellar. 
If you combine him with Senator BOOZ-
MAN and Senator HEINRICH, it has been 
a great team. I just want to thank Sen-
ator MORAN for his leadership and his 
continued desire to do the right thing 
for 
the 
servicemembers 
who 
have 
served this country in the military. 
The Senate has a once-in-a-lifetime 
opportunity today to make history in 
passing the Sergeant First Class Heath 
Robinson Honoring our Promise to Ad-
dress Comprehensive Toxics Act. 
Let me be clear. This bill isn’t about 
Democrats versus Republicans. It is 
not about political posturing. It is 
about Americans standing up for those 
who have served and sacrificed on be-
half of this country and the freedoms 
that we have today. In fact, it is even 
more than that. It is about righting a 
wrong that has been ignored for too 
damn long. 
It is about Will Thompson, who 
served our country for 23 years in the 
Army on Active Duty as a West Vir-
ginia National Guardsman. 
After his second tour in Iraq in 2009, 
Will developed pulmonary fibrosis from 
the effect of his exposures to burn pits, 
and he endured two double-lung trans-
plants. He testified in front of our com-
mittee, less than a year ago. He lost 
his battle with his illnesses this last 
December. 
It is about SFC Heath Robinson, who 
answered the call of duty and was de-
ployed to Kosovo and Iraq with the

Ohio National Guard—a picture of 
Heath right here and his daughter. 
While deployed, he was exposed to po-
tent toxins, and 13 years after his de-
ployment—13 short years after his de-
ployment—he lost his life to a rare 
autoimmune disease and stage IV lung 
cancer, conditions absolutely and un-
equivocally caused by burn pits. 
Sadly, it is too late to do right by 
Will and Heath and so many others for 
them personally, but today this body 
has a chance to do the right thing by 
their families and future generations of 
our All-Volunteer military by advanc-
ing the Sergeant First Class Heath 
Robinson Honoring our PACT Act. 
I want to talk a little bit about this 
plaque right here, see the picture of 
Heath in uniform? But you also see 
what is the most important thing to 
Heath, and that is his daughter. His 
daughter was at a press conference 
that the ranking member and I were at 
a little over a week ago. And I said this 
when I first spoke on this bill a little 
over a week ago, the first words out of 
her mouth were: ‘‘I love my daddy. 
Daddy’s not around anymore.’’ But be-
cause of, hopefully, the work that we 
are going to do here today, she will 
have a future. 
This is not only about our service 
men 
and 
women—the 
people 
who 
served in our military—it is about 
their families because when folks go to 
war, it is just not the service person 
who does it; it is everybody in their 
family. 
And what this bill will do, is it will 
address decades of inaction and failure 
by our government, expanding eligi-
bility for VA healthcare to more than 
3.5 million combat veterans exposed to 
burn pits. It supports our post-9/11 and 
Vietnam-era veterans by removing the 
burden of proof for 23 presumptive con-
ditions caused by toxins. 
These conditions include cancers to 
lung disease, and it establishes a 
framework for the establishment of fu-
ture presumptions and service connec-
tions related to toxic exposure, giving 
the VA the tools it needs to bolster its 
workforce, establish more healthcare 
facilities, and improve claims proc-
essing. 
There is always a cost to war, and 
that cost is never fully paid when the 
war ends. Our country didn’t live up to 
its promise to veterans like Will 
Thompson and Heath Robinson, but if 
we do what Senator MORAN and I have 
done, and that is put politics aside, if 
we put our American men and women’s 
bravest first, if we can begin settling 
our debts to millions of other veterans 
and their families by getting this bill 
across the finish line, we will have 
done something great. 
And I would urge my colleagues to 
support this final procedural vote and a 
vote that is critical to moving this bill 
forward. 
AMENDMENTS WITHDRAWN 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent 
that 
the

tant day as a Federal holiday. Though

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2952 
June 15, 2022 
Monday, communities across our Na-
tion have been marking Juneteenth for 
more than 150 years. 
The celebration of Juneteenth dates 
back to June 19, 1865, when Union sol-
diers led by Major General Gordon 
Granger traveled to Galveston, TX, 
with the announcement that the Civil 
War had ended and that the enslaved 
were now free. 
This was 21⁄2 years after the date of 
President 
Lincoln’s 
Emancipation 
Proclamation. Either the news of Lin-
coln’s order had not reached many, in-
cluding those in Texas, or local offi-
cials refused to enforce the Emanci-
pation Proclamation. 
Decades later, I introduced, along 
with my partners in service, Senators 
CORY BOOKER and TINA SMITH and Rep-
resentative SHEILA JACKSON LEE, the 
Juneteenth National Independence Day 
Act to honor the day that these Ameri-
cans took their first steps into freedom 
and finally made Juneteenth a Federal 
holiday. 
On June 17, 2021, I was honored to 
stand with Vice President KAMALA 
HARRIS, Senator SMITH, Representative 
JACKSON Lee, Senator CORNYN, Senator 
WARNOCK, and Ms. Opal Lee, while 
President Biden signed the National 
Juneteenth Independence Day Act into 
law. 
And why do I mention Ms. Opal Lee? 
Well, because she is the grandmother of 
the Juneteenth movement, who fought 
for years to make Juneteenth a Fed-
eral holiday, from Fort Worth, TX, an 
activist, an educator, who walked 21⁄2 
miles every day, fighting for the 
United 
States 
to 
finally 
have 
Juneteenth a Federal holiday. And at 
the age of 94, she saw that become a re-
ality in the White House. 
And in doing so, Juneteenth finally 
took its rightful place amongst other 
Federal holidays so that all Americans 
in all States can celebrate Juneteenth 
just like they celebrate Memorial Day. 
The same way they celebrate Martin 
Luther King Day, they now celebrate 
Juneteenth. 
Juneteenth is a holiday that requires 
us to remember, reflect, and recommit 
to the principles that undergird our 
Nation, liberty and justice for all, but 
that we have never fully embodied. 
We continue to strive to live up to 
these principles today. Systemic dis-
crimination and mistreatment of Black 
and Brown Americans still permeates 
our society—from our criminal justice 
system 
to 
our 
schools, 
to 
our 
healthcare systems, that is why it is so 
important that we can learn from our 
past and honor the heroes in our his-
tory who have bent the moral arc of 
our Nation toward justice. 
We face a long road toward justice 
and equality in the United States, and 
for us to move forward, that path must 
be lit with the recognition of our Na-
tion’s history. 
Juneteenth is our Nation’s history. 
Disparities and injustices reflect the 
unfulfilled promise of a nation built 
upon the notion that all people are cre-
ated equal. 
And it has roots in our Nation’s 
original sin—slavery—a crime against 
humanity that we have for far too long 
failed to fully acknowledge or to ad-
dress. 
In commemorating Juneteenth as a 
Federal holiday, we will not fulfill our 
obligation to right all these wrongs or 
fix what remains broken, but it is the 
truth of our history. We must read 
these missing chapters to understand 
our national story of freedom and inde-
pendence. 
And right now, in red States across 
the country, extremists don’t want us 
to learn from our own history. They 
are burning books and threatening 
schoolteachers in an attempt to stop 
our young people from understanding 
our Nation’s past and how it sheds 
light on our present. 
These extremists are afraid that 
learning about our Nation’s history, in-
cluding many dark chapters as well as 
the many triumphs, is a threat. And in-
stead of empowering our children to 
learn from their example, they wish to 
silence the stories of the brave women 
and men who have fought for racial 
equality, and those who continue to 
fight today follow in that tradition. 
Critics say that this discourse will 
divide us, but that couldn’t be less 
true. More than 150 years since the 
freeing of the last slaves in America, 
our Nation stands at a crossroads on 
our path to racial justice and equality. 
We must recognize our wrongs, ac-
knowledge the pain, acknowledge the 
suffering of generations of slaves and 
their descendants, and understand the 
structures of inequity that continue to 
oppress communities of color and, im-
portantly, learn how the freedom fight-
ers of yesterday and today embody the 
truest values of our Nation. 
We have them to thank for our 
march toward a more perfect Union, 
but there is more work to be done. As 
Ms. Opal Lee said when talking about 
Juneteenth as a unifier, ‘‘I truly be-
lieve that we can do so much more to-
gether rather than apart.’’ 
Together, thanks to the work of this 
Chamber 
and 
so 
many 
Americans 
across our Nation who have fought to 
tell the full story of our past, Ameri-
cans will commemorate Juneteenth on 
Monday. 
In doing so, we will join with one an-
other in honoring our past and recom-
mitting to the work which lies ahead. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
GUN VIOLENCE 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, on Sun-
day, a bipartisan group of Senators an-
nounced principles for addressing the 
concerns over shootings like occurred 
in Uvalde, TX, 3 weeks ago, and other 
places as well. 
And I would say we have been mak-
ing good progress, but we have run into 
a couple of bumps in the road that have 
slowed things down a little bit. 
One of them is over crisis interven-
tion programs, something we agree is 
very important. I believe that we ought 
to put every State in the position of 
seeking and receiving funds for crisis 
intervention programs that they have 
in place already, even if they don’t 
have a red flag law. 
‘‘Red flag’’ has been what has been 
discussed and discussed many times, 
but 19 States have red flag laws, but 
that means 31 States have other crisis 
intervention initiatives that are de-
signed to address the same problem, 
which is people who are a danger to 
themselves and others because of their 
mental health. It includes things like 
assisted 
outpatient 
treatment 
pro-
grams, drug courts, mental health 
courts, and veterans courts. 
The other issue that we are wrestling 
with relates to the domestic violence 
provision and the way nontraditional 
relationships are handled. We need to 
define this in a very crystal clear way. 
It can’t be overly broad or open to in-
terpretation. It needs to be something 
that can actually be applied because we 
are talking about very serious con-
sequences here. 
Of course, with both of these provi-
sions, we must include rigorous due 
process protections. That is a redline 
for folks on my side of the aisle. 
I know Senator SCHUMER, the major-
ity leader, wants to put this bill on the 
floor next week, but unless we can re-
solve these differences over these two 
provisions and do it soon, hopefully 
today, then we won’t have time to pre-
pare the text so Senators can read the 
bill for themselves, which we would ex-
pect them to do. And so that is going 
to require some continued work and 
good faith negotiations on all sides. 
The details of these provisions are 
critical for support from my colleagues 
on this side of the aisle, and I hope 
that our colleagues across the aisle 
will understand, if we continue down 
this path without resolution, that we 
are jeopardizing the timetable that the 
majority leader has set out for us, or 
we are jeopardizing the likelihood we 
can get to 60 votes for anything, and we 
know how hard this is. 
I am eager to wrap up our negotia-
tions, but we are not going to cut cor-
ners or capitulate for the sole purpose 
of passing something. I am not willing 
to compromise on some of my basic 
principles or throw the Constitution 
out the window so we can have some-
thing we can hold up and say: Look 
what we did. 
There is a bipartisan appetite to get 
this done—that is good—and I am opti-
mistic about how far we have come, 
but we are not there yet, and we need 
to continue and do so quickly to reach 
an agreement on language so we can 
then write the text and have the vote. 
From the outset, I said I wanted to 
identify targeted reforms that could 
have prevented the recent tragedies in 
Uvalde and elsewhere. That includes 
stronger 
mental 
health 
resources, 
which could have helped Salvador 
Ramos before he became so sick that 
he killed innocent children, and he

committed suicide, essentially, in the 
process. That includes school safety 
measures, which could have prevented 
the shooter from actually getting in-
side Robb Elementary School. It in-
cludes reforms to prevent violence by 
criminals and other dangerous individ-
uals. 
The National Instant Criminal Back-
ground Check System is one of the 
most effective tools we have to keep 
guns out of the hands of criminals and 
people who suffer from severe mental 
illness, but it is not a perfect system. 
It is only as good as the information 
contained in the system. 
For example, in 2017, in the shooting 
in Sutherland Springs—a little town 
outside of San Antonio, TX, my home-
town—what 
happened 
there 
high-
lighted the gaping hole in the back-
ground check system. Despite the fact 
that the shooter had a long and dis-
turbing history of violence that should 
have prohibited him from purchasing a 
gun, he was able to do so because the 
Air Force in this instance had not 
uploaded his felony convictions, his do-
mestic violence conviction, or his men-
tal health commitment. 
In response to Sutherland Springs, 
Senator MURPHY and I introduced the 
Fix NICS Act to ensure that all Fed-
eral Agencies accurately and correctly 
upload the required conviction records 
on a timely basis. 
Yes, this is the same Senator CHRIS 
MURPHY whom I am working with now 
to try to achieve success here. We have 
done it before, and I believe we can do 
it again. Our bill was signed into law in 
March of 2018, and in the first 3 years, 
111⁄2
million 
more 
records 
were 
uploaded into the three national data-
bases that the FBI checks. The number 
of records in one of those databases in-
creased by more than 30 percent alone. 
So I think I can say with assurance 
that what we did together in 2018 has 
saved lives because if it kept a gun out 
of the hands of somebody who is al-
ready prohibited from getting a gun 
under current law, we will have saved a 
life—maybe even the life of the shoot-
er. Sixty percent of the gun deaths in 
America are suicides. But I know we 
have saved at least those lives and I 
think many others as well. 
But, as the Uvalde shooting dem-
onstrated, there is another hole in the 
background check system, and that is 
juvenile records. 
Salvador Ramos showed up at the age 
of 18 and had a clean record as far as 
the background check system was con-
cerned because it couldn’t look back at 
his troubled history, struggling with 
mental health and law enforcement 
problems. So he showed up as if he had 
been born the day before, and nothing 
else previously mattered because it 
wasn’t in the background check sys-
tem. 
If there are disqualifying criminal or 
mental health records, that informa-
tion should show up in the NICS sys-
tem. In other words, if there are things 
in your life that would disqualify you if 
you were an adult but that happened 
before you turned 18, I think that is the 
information we need and would want to 
have for purposes of determining who 
should be able to purchase or possess a 
firearm. So that wall that prevents the 
lookback into pre-18-year-old records is 
obviously a problem. 
Four years ago, the Uvalde Police 
Department 
received 
information 
about two male juveniles, 13 and 14 
years old, who were plotting a school 
shooting for their senior year. That 
was 4 years ago, and they were plotting 
a school shooting when they graduated 
in—you guessed it—2022. Now, there is 
no way for us to know for sure whether 
one of those individuals was Salvador 
Ramos because those juvenile records 
are not available to us. But I am here 
to say that if it is not Salvador Ramos, 
then we have even a bigger problem. If 
there are two additional, young, 13- 
and 14-year-old boys out there saying 
they are going to shoot up the school 
when they become seniors, we have 
even a bigger problem. 
One of the provisions we are dis-
cussing would encourage the States to 
upload 
similar 
relevant 
juvenile 
records into the NICS. This is standard 
practice in some but not all States, and 
it is easy to see why it is important. 
If an 18-year-old is convicted of ag-
gravated assault—a felony—the record 
will show up in his background check 
and prohibit him from purchasing a 
gun, but if a 17-year-old is convicted of 
the same crime, the record will not 
necessarily be uploaded into the Na-
tional Instant Criminal Background 
Check System. If he tries to purchase a 
gun at 18, the background check is 
likely to come back clean—again, be-
cause the system is only as good as the 
information in it. 
Let me give you another example. An 
individual can be adjudicated mentally 
ill on his 17th birthday and actually be 
civilly committed for multiple months 
in a mental institution, but that same 
person could likely purchase a gun at 
the age of 18 without anything showing 
up on his record. Existing law prohibits 
that purchase, but not all the States 
are sending that information to the 
National Instant Criminal Background 
Check System. 
Those are examples of why it is so 
important to be able to get that 
lookback in the pre-18-year-old history 
for mental health or criminal justice 
encounters. 
This is not actually an expansion of 
the background check system because 
it doesn’t add any new restrictions to 
gun ownership, but it would permit the 
background check system to actually 
have access to relevant and material 
information. It is a commonsense step 
to ensure that the data in the NICS 
system is accurate. 
That is easy enough to say, but we 
need to ensure this idea would work in 
practice, and that is exactly what we 
are examining now. 
No. 1, we need to ensure this provi-
sion would protect due process of law. 
That is a constitutional right that is 
fundamental. Under current law, any-
one who receives a denial has the right 
to appeal that decision or challenge the 
accuracy of the record. Of course, those 
same protections should exist for juve-
nile records as well. 
Secondly, we need to establish an in-
terim plan while these records are 
being uploaded into the background 
check system, a process that will take 
some time. 
Now, my colleagues across the aisle 
suggested a mandatory waiting period 
for all purchasers under the age of 21, 
but we didn’t agree to that. There is no 
reason why somebody who passes a 
background check with all relevant in-
formation in the database should be de-
nied the ability to purchase a gun. In 
fact, we are talking again about a con-
stitutional right. So no mandatory 
waiting period. But we are looking at 
extending the investigatory period for 
juvenile records that are unclear or 
ambiguous. Let me explain what I am 
talking about. 
Under current law, a person who 
wants to purchase a gun from their 
local retailer must complete a back-
ground check. We talked about that. In 
nearly 90 percent of the cases, the 
background check is resolved almost 
immediately because these are comput-
erized records. The average processing 
time is, in fact, less than 2 minutes. In 
those cases, the seller receives an im-
mediate answer—either the sale can 
proceed or it cannot. 
In the remaining roughly 10 percent 
of background checks, the system 
doesn’t return a green light or a red 
light. In short, this happens when there 
are question marks or other things 
that need to be inquired about. This 
could be caused by a number of factors. 
If the buyer has a common name, the 
system could pull records on the wrong 
individual with the same name. It 
could also be caused by incomplete 
criminal history records. For example, 
if somebody was convicted of assault 
but the record doesn’t say whether it 
was a felony or misdemeanor or in 
some cases whether the assault was a 
domestic violence incident, that would 
have consequences in terms of their 
ability to purchase a firearm. So fur-
ther 
review, 
further 
investigation 
sometimes is necessary to see whether 
the light should be green or the light 
should be red. 
Under the current law, the FBI has 
up to 3 business days to complete a 
background check and give the seller a 
clean answer on whether the sale can 
proceed. That is current law, up to 3 
days. In many cases, this review that 
we are talking about adding for persons 
between 18 and 21—this review can 
clarify that the sale can proceed, and 
that is a great thing. That is how we 
safeguard Second Amendment rights 
for law-abiding gun owners. 
We discussed the idea of extending 
that investigatory period when there is 
a question mark surrounding juvenile 
records. Again, this is the exception to

the rule, where more information is re-
quired because the answer that you get 
is ambiguous or unclear. 
Under this enhanced review, an 18- 
year-old with a clean record would be 
able to expeditiously purchase a fire-
arm. The extended investigation period 
would only apply to those rare cases 
and, again, only for those 18 to 20 for 
whom the system does not return a 
clear answer—yes or no, green or red— 
but, rather, a yellow light. 
We believe this is a commonsense 
and straightforward way to improve 
the existing background check system 
without adding new restrictions. 
As I said, negotiations are ongoing, 
but time is of the essence because we 
need to get to an agreement so we can 
get text to our colleagues so that the 
majority leader can bring this bill up 
on the floor next week after giving ev-
eryone a chance to read it and under-
stand it and have their questions an-
swered. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous 
consent 
that 
notwith-
standing rule XXII, the Senate proceed 
to executive session to consider the fol-
lowing nominations en bloc: Calendar 
Nos. 732 and 735; that the Senate vote 
on the nominations en bloc without in-
tervening action or debate; that the 
motions to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table; that any 
statements related to the nominations 
be printed in the RECORD; and that the 
President be immediately notified of 
the Senate’s action and the Senate re-
sume legislative session. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Indiana. 
Mr. BRAUN. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, it has come to my 
attention recently on a couple of the 
nominees whom the Federal Mine Safe-
ty and Health Review Commission is 
entertaining—this body has been rife 
with allegations of abuse of power and 
a hostile work environment, resulting 
in several whistleblower complaints. 
Several of these allegations would have 
occurred during both Mary Lu Jordan’s 
and Timothy Baker’s previous tenures 
at the Agency. 
The Federal Mine Safety and Health 
Review Commission was created under 
the Mine Act, which declared that the 
industry must view the health and 
safety and consider it the most pre-
cious resource of the miner. The Agen-
cy does not have its own Office of In-
spector General to review these consid-
erations. I think it probably needs one. 
This has led to ongoing efforts by both 
House Oversight and Senate Repub-
licans. 
It is important to shine a light on 
Agencies like this, the Federal Mine 
Safety and Health Review Commission, 
that have little to no oversight cur-
rently. 
So, until I am satisfied—and I think 
others as well—that we look into that, 
that we vet those concerns, and have 
some type of interim oversight, I do ob-
ject. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
OSSOFF). Objection is heard. 
The Senator from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I have 
some remarks on the nominations. 
As the Senator from Indiana noted, 
the two individuals talked about are 
Timothy ‘‘T.J.’’ Baker and Mary Lu 
Jordan to serve on the Federal Mine 
Safety and Health Review Commission. 
Mr. Baker and Ms. Jordan are highly 
qualified nominees who were nomi-
nated last year. 
Mr. Baker currently serves as the as-
sociate general counsel of the United 
Mine Workers of America and pre-
viously worked for the Federal Mine 
Safety and Health Review Commission, 
first as an attorney-advisor in the Of-
fice of Administrative Law Judges in 
Pittsburgh and then as attorney-advi-
sor in the Office of the Commissioners 
in Washington, DC. Mr. Baker is also 
the son of a coal miner. 
Ms. Jordan was appointed as a Com-
missioner on the Federal Mine Safety 
and Health Review Commission in 1994 
and has served in that capacity almost 
continuously since then. Her most re-
cent term as Commissioner ended in 
2020, and she has since served as senior 
attorney-advisor at the Commission. 
Given their expertise and commit-
ment to public service, both Mr. Baker 
and Ms. Jordan would be assets to the 
Federal Mine Safety and Health Re-
view Commission. It is past due that 
the Senate confirm their nominations. 
Confirming both would give Democrats 
a majority on the Commission. 
Mr. Baker and Ms. Jordan are among 
the excellent nominees who have been 
put forward by the Biden-Harris admin-
istration. Nominees like Mr. Baker and 
Ms. Jordan will help us represent our 
Nation’s coal miners, and I hope we can 
advance their nominations today. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. OSSOFF. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ROSEN). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
H.R. 3967 
Mr. OSSOFF. Madam President, I 
rise today to urge my colleagues— 
Democrats, 
Independents, 
Repub-
licans—to seize this opportunity that 
we have to pass bipartisan legislation 
to look out for the veterans of wars in 
Iraq and Afghanistan who are suffering 
the terrible consequences of exposure 
to burn pits, toxic fumes, and toxic 
waste. 
When we send Americans to war, car-
ing for them when they return is not a 
favor, it is not a good deed, it is not a 
choice; it is a sacred obligation of the 
U.S. Government. 
I would observe that many of the 
same Senators who voted to send our 
forces into harm’s way in Iraq and Af-
ghanistan are still serving in this body 
today. 
We have a sacred obligation to pass 
this legislation to ensure that those 
who served in those conflicts and any-
where around the world in service to 
the United States, suffering from the 
effects of exposure to toxins, get the 
care they need through the VA. 
This is about folks like COL David 
McCracken of Tyrone, GA, an Army 
Reservist deployed in defense of our 
country after 9/11. Colonel McCracken 
made it home from those deployments. 
He served his country. He did his duty 
with valor and bravery. But at the age 
of 45, when otherwise healthy, Colonel 
McCracken was diagnosed with brain 
cancer—a rare occurrence at his age— 
and 11 months later, he was dead, 
taken from a wife and three children. 
This is about folks like Army SGT 
Jeff Danovich, who fought in Mosul in 
2004, where he lived just 100 yards from 
a burn pit. Like Colonel McCracken, 
Sergeant Danovich did his duty. He 
served in combat. He came home to his 
family, but just 2 years ago, Sergeant 
Danovich was diagnosed with leu-
kemia. And when he filed for disability 
with the VA because of his exposure to 
burn pits, his claim was denied. 
Let me just state again that when 
this government sends its forces into 
harm’s way, caring for them when they 
return is not a good deed. We don’t get 
extra credit for doing this. It is not a 
favor; it is our job. And let me remind 
my colleagues once again that many of 
you in this body voted to send these 
men and women into combat. 
So Senator TESTER
and Senator 
MORAN have presented us with a bipar-
tisan bill to do what is right and look 
after the veterans who did their jobs 
for us when we sent them to do those 
jobs. Let’s do our jobs for them and 
pass this legislation. 
I yield the floor.

PRESIDING 
OFFICER

SMITH). The Senator from Illinois. 
TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF DACA 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, it 
was 10 years ago today that President 
Obama walked into the White House 
Rose Garden and said he had an an-
nouncement to make. 
He made an announcement which 
changed the lives of hundreds of thou-
sands of people living in America. He 
announced the Deferred Action for 
Childhood Arrivals. Now, we call it 
DACA. 
And 
with 
that 
announcement, 
I 
joined with, I guess, thousands of 
young leaders across this country and 
breathed a sigh of relief. 
Over the past decade, DACA has al-
lowed more than 800,000 Dreamers to 
remain in the only home they have 
ever known: America. These young 
people we call Dreamers came to this

country as children, some as young as 
a few months old. They grew up study-
ing in our classrooms. They grew up 
befriending our children and grand-
children. They went to church with us, 
and when they were kids, every morn-
ing they stood up in that classroom 
and pledged allegiance to that flag. 
And the reason they did it, of course, is 
they believed it was their flag. 
In the years since DACA was an-
nounced, a lot has changed in the 
world. Presidents have come and gone, 
wars have ended, and a once-in-a-cen-
tury pandemic has rocked the world. 
But in the face of all these changes 
and 
upheavals, 
one 
thing 
remains 
steady, constant, and predictable: the 
devotion of Dreamers to America. 
These young people have demonstrated 
an unwavering commitment to Amer-
ica. They served as our school teachers, 
first responders, members of the mili-
tary, essential workers in the pan-
demic. 
More than 200,000 DACA recipients 
were classified by our government as 
‘‘essential critical infrastructure work-
ers’’ during the pandemic—200,000 of 
them. And, remember, they don’t enjoy 
the benefit of citizenship yet. Among 
them are 40,000 healthcare industry 
workers, doctors, nurses, paramedics. 
Over the years, I have come to the 
floor of the Senate over 125 different 
times to tell the stories of the Dream-
ers. These stories show us what is at 
stake when we consider the fate of 
DACA and the Dream Act. 
Today, I want to tell you the story of 
Yazmin Ruiz. She is the 130th Dreamer 
story that I have told on the Senate 
floor. 
This is a photograph of Yazmin. 
She arrived in this country at the 
age of 3, along with her twin sister and 
her mom. And even though her ex-
tended family remained in Mexico, she 
said she never felt alone growing up in 
Arizona because ‘‘we were surrounded 
by community.’’ 
But when Yazmin was 16, the family 
suffered a tragedy that ignited her pas-
sion for medicine. Her mother had a 
stroke, and when the family arrived at 
the hospital, they were shocked to dis-
cover that none of the healthcare pro-
viders spoke Spanish. 
At a young age, Yazmin, who was 
grappling with the trauma and fear 
that her mother might die, was forced 
to play the role of interpreter and 
translator to save her mother’s life. 
It was at that moment, even as a ter-
rified 16-year-old, that Yazmin resolved 
to become a healthcare hero if her 
mom needed her. 
She studied hard in high school. She 
graduated with honors. She made her 
way to the University of New Mexico, 
where she earned a bachelor of science 
in biology and Spanish. 
Yazmin then matriculated to the 
University of New Mexico School of 
Medicine, but then she hit a speed 
bump. She discovered that her immi-
gration status was going to stop her 
from receiving a professional license to 
practice medicine. Her dream was in-
terrupted. 
What did she do? She said: No way. 
She wouldn’t accept no for an answer. 
She joined a coalition of like-minded 
students and rallied support in the New 
Mexico Legislature to change the State 
law on licensure. 
Now Yazmin Ruiz is fulfilling her 
childhood dream. Every day she deliv-
ers care and support to families like 
her own and offers the guidance that 
she once sought as a teenager lost in 
our healthcare system. 
Yazmin is in the third year of her 
general surgeon residency at the Uni-
versity of New Mexico. And at the 
height of the pandemic, she was deep in 
the trenches of our healthcare system. 
Back in the summer of 2020, when 
COVID was new and basically un-
known, Yazmin was working 80 hours a 
week, providing daily care to COVID- 
positive patients, performing CPR, and 
wearing protective gear from head to 
toe. 
Like so many Dreamers, Yazmin’s 
commitment to serving her community 
was unshakeable. Even when her own 
family 
members 
came 
down 
with 
COVID, she didn’t stay home and take 
care of them. She went to work. Day 
after day, she put her life on the line to 
save the lives of others. 
And she has continued that journey 
as a healthcare professional against 
improbable odds. 
Yazmin considers it ‘‘a privilege and 
an honor to serve America in the midst 
of an unprecedented public health cri-
sis.’’ 
I want to thank Yazmin Ruiz for her 
service 
on 
the 
frontlines 
of 
the 
coronavirus pandemic. She is an immi-
grant health hero. She is a DACA 
health hero. She has put herself and 
her family at risk to protect American 
lives. She shouldn’t also have to worry 
about whether she is going to be de-
ported tomorrow and whether her fam-
ily will be deported as well. 
Think about that for one moment. 
This young woman, against all the 
odds, is pursuing her residency in sur-
gery. She is determined to serve this 
Nation and to make people’s lives bet-
ter. 
And what is our response, our official 
government response? Sorry. You are 
not a citizen, and under the current 
law, you never will be. 
So you ask yourself, what are we 
thinking? If a quality, contributing 
person like Yazmin Ruiz is willing to 
defy the odds and to risk everything to 
be a doctor, why aren’t we applauding 
that, rewarding that, giving her an in-
centive and others like her to be a gen-
eration of service to America? 
Basic question we have to ask, would 
we be a better nation, a better country, 
if we deported Yazmin Ruiz? I hope the 
answer is pretty obvious. It is to me. 
Over the past 20 years or more, I have 
had the privilege of sharing more than 
100 stories like Yazmin’s on the floor of 
the Senate—the stories of Dreamers 
who have given everything they can to 
America and who have more than 
earned their place in America’s story. 
Yet these brilliant young people are 
still waiting on us, on Congress, to fin-
ish the job that President Obama start-
ed with DACA. This program was al-
ways supposed to be a temporary solu-
tion. Ten years ago we knew that. The 
permanent solution was enacting a 
piece of legislation that I introduced 20 
years ago called the DREAM Act. It 
provides a path to citizenship for 
Dreamers, including young immigrants 
eligible for DACA. 
Congress has been on the cusp of 
passing the DREAM Act for years. In 
2013, we included it in a larger immi-
gration package that passed the Senate 
with 68 votes. It was a glorious day. 
Can you imagine it—68 votes in the 
Senate for anything? 
And that broad bipartisan support re-
flected America’s public opinion; that 
the Dream Act was the right thing to 
do. In fact, over the years, ‘‘Dreamers’’ 
have become a household word. When 
we came up with the name for this leg-
islation over 20 years ago, and you said 
the word ‘‘Dreamers,’’ people would 
say: Oh, I know that. That is a rock 
group, a British rock group, and it 
might have been Freddie and the 
Dreamers, but that wasn’t the group 
we were describing at all. 
These Dreamers have touched the 
hearts of America because in the 
Dreamers we see our own history as a 
nation of immigrants. We know that 
they deserve permanent status in this 
country, their home. They have earned 
it, but time and again the Senate has 
failed DACA recipients. 
Instead of making these protections 
permanent, we have left them in doubt. 
The former President of the United 
States, Donald Trump, even attempted 
to terminate the DACA Program to 
turn people like Yazmin Ruiz away 
from the country. 
Can you imagine what that would 
have meant to her, to her family, to 
New Mexico, to America, for all the 
Americans whose lives have been saved 
by Dreamers like Yazmin or for the Na-
tion’s classrooms and businesses that 
count on these idealistic, hard-working 
people who want to be part of our fu-
ture? 
And our failure to protect Dreamers 
is not only a human disaster, it is an 
economic disaster. It doesn’t add up. 
DACA recipients and their house-
holds pay more than $5 billion in Fed-
eral taxes, more than $3 billion in 
State and local taxes every single year. 
That is money that funds the construc-
tion of roads and bridges, pays Social 
Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. And 
the economic upside of enacting the 
Dream Act is even bigger. 
Last year, the House passed the bi-
partisan Dream and Promise Act. If the 
Senate just followed their lead and 
passed that legislation today, we could 
increase America’s GDP by more than 
$800 billion over the next decade and 
create hundreds of thousands of jobs in 
the process.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2956 
June 15, 2022 
Our broken immigration system is 
embarrassing. It is failing America, 
and it is failing our families. It is also 
failing 
our 
economy. 
Beyond 
the 
Dream Act, Congress on both sides of 
the political spectrum agree, com-
prehensive immigration reform would 
boost our economic growth and help 
ease 
inflationary 
pressures 
in 
the 
United 
States. 
The 
United 
States 
Chamber of Commerce even called for 
doubling the number of legal immi-
grants in America to address the work-
er shortage and in turn alleviate infla-
tion. With the Dream Act, we are talk-
ing about a bipartisan measure that is 
very simple in scope. It allows young 
people who have grown up in America 
to continue contributing to our econ-
omy. For decades now, Dreamers have 
been stuck in legislative purgatory. 
Only a subset of them have been able 
to secure DACA protections, and even 
for those who do, they have to renew 
their status every 2 years, which means 
they can only plan their lives in uncer-
tain 2-year increments. That is unfair. 
No, it is cruel. 
Dreamers are living with the sword 
of Damocles hanging over their head. 
In the coming weeks, a Federal judge 
could strike down DACA and deport 
these young people to countries they 
barely remember, if they remember at 
all. Just last year, a Federal judge in 
Texas limited the program to only re-
newing applications. That ruling was 
wrong. It excluded a whole generation 
of Dreamers from stepping out of the 
shadows of a broken immigration sys-
tem. 
If there is one lesson we can learn 
from the bipartisan gun safety frame-
work that is being debated this week in 
Washington, it is that the Members of 
this Senate are not as divided as the 
American people think. We can come 
together to support commonsense poli-
cies that secure a brighter future for 
America. That is exactly the oppor-
tunity we have with the Dream Act. 
I can think of no better way to cele-
brate the 10-year anniversary of DACA 
than by finally passing this legislation, 
offering every one of our amazing 
Dreamers a path to American citizen-
ship, which they deserve and they have 
earned. An overwhelming bipartisan 
majority of voters want Congress to 
pass the Dream Act. They know it will 
dramatically grow our economy and 
strengthen our Nation. Most impor-
tantly, it is the right thing to do. 
It is time for Congress to step up and 
meet our responsibility—Democrats, 
Republicans and Independents alike. 
Let’s get this done. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HICKENLOOPER). 
The 
Senator 
from 
Vermont. 
BUDGET RESOLUTION 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, at 5:15 
this afternoon, we will be voting on a 
budget resolution written by my col-
league Senator RAND PAUL from Ken-
tucky. As chairman of the Budget 
Committee, I urge a very strong ‘‘no’’ 
vote. 
At a time of a massive incline in 
wealth inequality, at a time when two 
people in our country own more wealth 
than the bottom 42 percent of our pop-
ulation, at a time when the top 1 per-
cent owns more wealth than the bot-
tom 92 percent, at a time when we are 
looking at more income and wealth in-
equality than at any time in American 
history, this budget resolution offered 
by Senator PAUL would move us in ex-
actly the wrong direction and make a 
bad situation worse. 
Senator 
PAUL’s 
resolution 
would 
make the very wealthiest people in this 
country even wealthier, while at the 
same time, it would make tens of mil-
lions of middle-class Americans—peo-
ple in the middle class, people in the 
working class, lower income Ameri-
cans—even poorer. 
We remain, sadly, the only major 
country on Earth not to guarantee 
healthcare to all people as a human 
right. We pay the highest prices by far 
in the world for prescription drugs. 
Half of our people are living paycheck 
to paycheck, and millions are working 
at 8, 9, 10 bucks an hour because we 
still have a disastrous, starvation min-
imum wage of $7.25 an hour. Many mil-
lions of Americans today, as housing 
prices soar, are spending half or more 
of their limited incomes on housing. 
Forty-five million people in our coun-
try are struggling with student debt. 
At a time when half of older Americans 
have no savings—people have worked 
their entire lives, and they have no 
savings to prepare themselves for re-
tirement. The Social Security benefits 
that they will receive are inadequate 
to allow them to live out their remain-
ing years in dignity. 
What this budget resolution brought 
forth by Senator PAUL does is exactly 
the opposite of what we should be 
doing. Instead of expanding Medicare 
to make sure that every man, woman, 
and 
child 
in 
this 
country 
has 
healthcare as a human right, this is a 
budget that would lead to devastating 
cuts to Medicare, cuts to Medicaid, and 
cuts to other public health programs. 
Senator PAUL’s budget resolution 
would cut nutrition assistance at a 
time when there are children in Amer-
ica today who are going hungry. It 
would cut Federal aid to education at a 
time when schools are looking for fund-
ing to pay the teachers they need ade-
quate wages. But in the midst of this 
budget that cuts healthcare, that cuts 
education, that cuts Social Security, 
that cuts every benefit needed by ordi-
nary Americans, this is a budget that 
would give massive tax breaks to the 
wealthiest people in this country. 
So you have a situation where, right 
now, we have a tax system which is 
broken, which is corrupt, which allows 
some billionaires in a given year to pay 
zero in Federal income taxes—zero. 
Some of the richest people in this 
country in a given year do not pay a 
nickel in Federal income tax. We have 
a tax system which allows dozens of 
major, profitable corporations making 
billions of dollars a year in profit to 
pay in a given year zero in Federal in-
come tax. We have an effective tax rate 
today in which billionaires pay a lower 
effective rate than nurses and fire-
fighters. That is what we have today. 
Senator 
PAUL’s 
budget—well, 
you 
guessed it. You are right. It would give 
even more tax breaks to the 1 percent 
and to the billionaire class. 
Unfortunately, the vision of America 
that Senator PAUL’s budget puts for-
ward—balancing the budget on the 
backs of working families, the elderly, 
the children, the sick, and the poor in 
order to make the richest people in 
America even richer—is not just the vi-
sion of Senator PAUL. I wish it was just 
his vision, and I have to applaud his 
honesty for coming forward and put-
ting his vision on paper. Unfortu-
nately, it is the vision of many, many 
people in the Republican Party, and 
this is what they want. 
Senator PAUL and many in the Re-
publican Party do not believe that it 
was good enough to provide over $1 
trillion in tax breaks to the top 1 per-
cent and large corporations, as they 
did when Trump was President—not 
good enough. The budget that we are 
debating today, Senator PAUL’s pro-
posal, would make those tax breaks for 
the wealthy and the powerful perma-
nent—permanent—at a cost of more 
than $2 trillion over the next decade, 
cutting nutrition programs for hungry 
children, throwing millions of people 
off of Medicare and Medicaid, but pro-
viding $2 trillion in tax breaks for the 
very wealthy. 
Under 
Trump, 
Republicans 
came 
within 1 vote of passing a bill that 
would have thrown up to 32 million 
Americans off of health insurance and 
eliminated vital protections for people 
with preexisting conditions like cancer 
or diabetes and substantially increased 
premiums for older workers. That was 
the bill that the Trump administration 
tried to get passed. It failed by one 
vote—the late Senator McCain. 
Senator PAUL and many Republicans 
who support this budget resolution be-
lieve that what they tried to do a few 
years ago in decimating the Affordable 
Care Act—hey, that didn’t go far 
enough. 
So the budget that we are talking 
about right now, Senator PAUL’s pro-
posal, would throw up to 35 million 
Americans off of Medicaid. 
So what do you do in the middle of a 
pandemic when you have no health in-
surance? Well, right now, as a nation 
today, there are estimates that about 
60,000 people a year die because they 
don’t get to a doctor on time. Throw 35 
million people off Medicaid, that num-
ber will escalate. We are talking about 
tens and tens of thousands of people 
who would die because they wouldn’t 
have Medicaid, wouldn’t be able to go 
to a doctor when they are sick. 
When Donald Trump was in office, he 
proposed a budget that would have cut 
Medicare by nearly $845 billion. Sen-
ator PAUL and the Republicans who

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2957 
June 15, 2022 
will support this budget do not believe 
that those cuts went far enough—only 
$845 billion in cuts to Medicare. The 
budget we are debating today would 
cut Medicare by up to $3.9 trillion over 
the next decade and throw some 29 mil-
lion senior citizens and persons with 
disabilities off of Medicare. 
At a time when tens of millions of 
Americans struggle with hunger, Sen-
ator PAUL and the Republicans who 
support this budget want to cut the 
SNAP program by $300 billion, throw-
ing some 13 million people off of that 
program. 
I don’t know what a nation stands for 
if we cannot feed the hungry and if we 
cannot provide healthcare to people 
who need it, but that is what this budg-
et does. Overall, Senator PAUL’s budget 
would make $15 trillion in cuts over 
the next 10 years, slashing the Federal 
budget by nearly 40 percent by the end 
of this decade. 
So that is where we are today, Mr. 
President. And, again, I would reit-
erate that this is not just Senator 
PAUL’s budget. And I applaud him for 
his honesty. He is an honest guy; he is 
a straightforward guy; and he comes 
forward and he says: This is what I be-
lieve. 
It would be bad enough if this were 
just the views of one U.S. Senator. Un-
fortunately, it is not. These are the 
views of many in the Republican Party. 
So, Mr. President, it is absolutely 
imperative that this budget proposal of 
Senator PAUL be defeated and that we 
move this country forward in a very 
different direction. It is a direction 
which says that the U.S. Government 
should be representing the needs of all 
of the people, not just the wealthy and 
the powerful and Big Money campaign 
contributors. It is a vision in opposi-
tion to Senator PAUL that says that 
healthcare is a human right, that we 
have to stand up to the pharmaceutical 
industry and cut prescription drug 
costs in this country in half. It is a vi-
sion which says that, no, we should not 
be cutting Social Security; we should 
be lifting the cap on taxable income, 
which today is at $147,000, meaning 
that somebody making $10 million pays 
the same amount into Social Security 
as 
somebody 
making 
$147,000. 
We 
should be lifting that cap so that we 
can increase Social Security benefits 
for all seniors. 
So, Mr. President, this is not just a 
budget resolution on the part of the 
Senator from Kentucky, Senator PAUL; 
this really is a contrasting vision of 
where we want this country to go. Do 
we want to move into an oligarchic 
form of society where a handful of peo-
ple on top have enormous wealth and 
enormous political power while, at the 
same time, the middle class continues 
to become small and we have more and 
more people living in poverty? 
So these are contrasting visions of 
the future of America, and I hope very 
much that Senator PAUL’s resolution 
will be soundly defeated. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
H.R. 3967 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I 
wanted to talk for just a few minutes, 
if I could, about a bill that is coming to 
the floor. It is called the PACT Act. 
And this is something that those of us 
at the Veterans’ Affairs Committee 
have worked on for quite a period of 
time. 
And 
we 
had 
worked 
diligently 
through what we thought was a pre-
scribed and agreed-to process, and we 
are finding out that the majority lead-
er is pretty much forcing this issue to 
the floor this week for a vote. And he 
is calling it ‘‘the most ambitious and 
important 
expansion 
of 
veteran 
healthcare benefits that we have seen 
in decades.’’ 
Now, Senators Schumer and Tester 
have, indeed, put forth a bill that when 
you look at it, when you hear the in-
tent, a first glance at it, you say: Oh, 
this is exactly what we need to help 
our servicemembers. 
And, indeed, we all are just so grate-
ful for the men and women who have 
served in this country, who have worn 
that uniform. But there is a lot to be 
said for bringing measures to the floor 
for passage when they are ready, when 
there has been agreement on critical 
importance. As the majority leader 
said, the biggest expansion of benefits 
that we have seen in decades. 
Now, many of us have worked for 
quite a period of time on the issue of 
toxic exposure and have worked on how 
best to make certain that when we ad-
dress this, that you are going to get 
care to the veteran in a timely man-
ner—they are not going to have to 
wait; they are going to receive the care 
that they need. 
So it is frustrating to me, as it is to 
many of my colleagues, to think about 
what could have been accomplished had 
the majority leader just done what he 
had promised to do and had allowed a 
thorough 
amendment 
process. 
We 
should all share the goal of making 
certain that legislation we pass that 
deals with our veterans, that deals 
with our men and women in uniform, is 
going to be a promise fulfilled and not 
a false promise or not a frustration. 
Yesterday, at Veterans’ Affairs Com-
mittee, we had a hearing with our VA 
Secretary. We have had a terrible prob-
lem with case backloads on benefits in 
health services. Currently, the case 
backload is about 188,000. That is the 
backlog. That is what needs to be 
worked through. And in passing this 
bill that is before us today, the esti-
mate is that we are going to add about 
a million cases to that. 
Now, I want you to put yourself in 
the shoes of a veteran who has suffered 
and is suffering with toxic exposure 
and has a rare cancer, has a respiratory 
disease, a cardiovascular disease, and is 
needing access to care. 
What you want is to be able to get 
that care. What you don’t want to do is 
have to wait for that care. And that is 
why we needed to go through this 
amendment process: to address this 
issue of how a veteran is going to be 
able to access that care in a timely 
manner when they need the care be-
cause with some of these rare diseases, 
days and weeks and months become a 
life-or-death issue. So the access is im-
portant. The amendments that we pro-
posed were as noncontroversial as you 
can get in these days. 
Now, the amendment that I had, 
which was one of the two amendments 
that we were to have on the Republican 
side—by the way, I said that, two 
amendments. That is what we were 
going to be allowed. It wasn’t an open 
amendment process—two amendments, 
two things that would have improved 
the bill. I proposed an amendment that 
would have eliminated arbitrary bu-
reaucratic hurdles for toxic exposed 
veterans, would have eliminated this 
from the long wait times at their local 
VA hospitals and clinics. Basically, it 
would have been that express pass that 
they need because it would have al-
lowed them to seek care in the commu-
nity if they could get it there faster 
than they could through the VA. 
Now, the reason for this is because I 
spend a lot of time talking with vet-
erans in Tennessee. I have veterans 
who are a part of our team. They talk 
to me about the issues that many of 
their friends and their neighbors are 
experiencing or people who served in 
their unit or their battalion and how 
they need this care. 
Right now, if you are in the Nashville 
area, which is where many of our retir-
ees from Fort Campbell and the 101st 
go for their care—if you are there and 
you are going to go to the VA over at 
Vanderbilt there in Nashville and re-
quest an appointment, your wait is 72 
days. What if you are a veteran and 
you have a rare respiratory condition 
that is caused from a burn pit or from 
toxic exposure or you have developed a 
cancer and you are needing care, do 
you really want to have to wait 21⁄2 
months to be able to see a general 
practitioner for an appointment that 
will refer you to a specialist? 
Do we think that is fair to our vet-
erans? Is that the way to treat them— 
to say, pick up the phone and call and 
then we will get you an appointment? 
By the way, it is going to be 72 days on 
the wait time, and then we will start 
the clock to try to get you into com-
munity care to get you to a specialist. 
My amendment would basically have 
said veterans can take that card out of 
their wallet, their VA card—they can 
show it at a care facility in their com-
munity, and they can get the care they 
need then. You are eliminating wait 
times for them. You are eliminating 
long lines. You are eliminating the 
frustration and the fear and the anx-
iety that comes as every day you think 
this cancer is growing, and I am being 
denied care because of the bureaucratic 
process. Our veterans ought not to 
have to deal with that bureaucratic 
process. They have waited a long time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2958 
June 15, 2022 
So this amendment would have im-
proved the bill. And I have it right here 
in my hands. It is really very simple. 
Section 121, ‘‘Subtitle C—Other Health 
Care Matters’’—that is what is under-
neath—‘‘REQUIREMENT TO PROVIDE 
CARE UNDER VETERANS COMMU-
NITY CARE PROGRAM FOR TOXIC- 
EXPOSED VETERANS.’’ And then it 
goes through, it strikes an ‘‘or,’’ in-
serts a semicolon, strikes the period at 
the end of the sentence and inserting 
‘‘or’’ and adds ‘‘the covered veteran is 
a toxic-exposed veteran.’’ 
Pretty specific. It elevates the care 
that they need so that they do not have 
to wait because they have waited long 
enough. And they don’t want to have to 
wait until the VA hires enough people 
to do this. Right now, if the VA is 
going to hire new nurses or doctors, do 
you know how long it takes them to 
get them hired? Ninety-seven days. Do 
they have what they need to meet this 
load? No, they do not. 
Now, in the private sector they can 
make these hires in about 16 days. And 
they do. And we have discussed these 
hiring process changes that need to be 
made in order to facilitate this care. 
Now, some have said: Well, you 
know, if we allow community care, in 
essence, 
that 
is 
privatizing— 
privatizing—the VA. No, it is not. It is 
not privatizing. What it is doing is say-
ing the VA is seeking a better way to 
deliver a service in a timely manner to 
the people who have been promised the 
service. That is what the amendment 
would do. It would allow them to avoid 
that bureaucratic process to take that 
VA card to go get the care they need 
that day. But, no, because we have 
some who are so fearful that the VA or 
the Federal Government might lose 
some of their power, some of their con-
trol over your life, they will not agree 
to that. 
Now, the fiscal year 2021 NDAA in-
cluded my K2 Veterans Toxic Exposure 
Accountability Act, requiring a 180-day 
study by DOD on toxic exposures at K2 
to demonstrate more clearly the asso-
ciations between exposure to toxic sub-
stances 
and 
negative 
health 
con-
sequence experienced by K2 veterans. 
That is something that had a tremen-
dous effect on many of our military 
men and women at Fort Campbell and 
there with the 160th, with the 101st. 
And I have worked with Senator 
TILLIS on the Toxic Exposure in the 
Military Act, the TEAM Act, which 
was largely included in the PACT Act. 
And I worked with Senator SULLIVAN 
on the Veterans Burn Pits Exposure 
Recognition Act, which would concede 
exposure to a list of toxic substances, 
hazards, and chemicals common to 
burn pits for veterans who deployed to 
certain covered locations within cer-
tain corresponding periods. 
So I thank my colleagues who have 
put the effort in on this. I will say that 
I am very disappointed that my col-
leagues from New York and Montana 
decided 
no 
amendments. 
Senator 
MORAN’s amendment would have ad-
justed how that wait time is calculated 
to be more fair to our veterans. My 
amendment would have allowed them 
to immediately get the care they need, 
lifesaving 
care—lifesaving 
care. 
It 
would have allowed that immediate ac-
cess. But we have chosen, it appears— 
or the majority leader and the chair-
man have chosen—to move forward 
without an amendment process that 
would be more fair and more responsive 
to our veterans. And at the same time, 
they are daring us to vote no on this 
bill. I would challenge them. 
Take a moment and let’s return to 
the agreed-to amendment process and 
improve this for the sake—for the 
sake—and the livelihood of many of 
our veterans who are experiencing the 
effects of toxic exposure. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The

The senior assistant legislative clerk

Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask unan-

quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

SETTING 
FORTH 
THE 
CONGRES-
SIONAL 
BUDGET 
FOR 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES 
GOVERNMENT 
FOR FISCAL YEAR 2023 AND SET-
TING FORTH THE APPROPRIATE 
BUDGETARY LEVELS FOR FIS-
CAL YEARS 2024 THROUGH 2032— 
MOTION TO PROCEED 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, the United 
States has the largest economy in the 
world and also has the largest govern-
ment apparatus in the world. This 
year, we will bring in $4.8 trillion and 
will spend about $5.8 trillion, and yet 
we will have no budget this year. How 
inexcusable, how embarrassing it is for 
a country—the largest country in the 
world, the largest government in the 
world, the largest bureaucracy in the 
world—to have no budget. Is it any 
wonder that we are $30 trillion in debt? 
Most small businesses have a budget. 
Most businesses in our country have a 
budget and a prediction for what will 
come in and what will go out for the 
year, and this year there will be no 
budget. Not only will there be no 
Democratic 
presentation 
about 
it, 
there will be no Republican presen-
tation as a party. 
So today I will introduce my budget. 
This is a budget that balances in 5 
years. The reason we chose 5 years is 
that the constitutional amendment to 
the budget amendment—the constitu-
tional amendment that would balance 
the budget—balances in 5 years. We 
voted on that amendment previously in 
this body, and the Democrats, in uni-
son, opposed it. They were opposed to a 
balanced budget amendment to the 
Constitution. The Republicans were 
unanimous in voting for the balanced 
budget 
amendment, 
constitutional 
amendment. In that amendment, the 
text of it would balance the budget in 
5 years. So you would think, if all 50 
Republicans are on record as being for 
a balanced budget amendment that bal-
ances in 5 years, that all 50 Repub-
licans would be for a balanced budget, 
a budget that actually balances in 5 
years. 
Now, why is it important to have a 
budget? Well, you ought to have a blue-
print or a plan for what your govern-
ment is going to do, so it is inexcusable 
not to have any budget at all. 
But also we have another problem 
that we are facing in our country: We 
are facing the problem of inflation. 
Every American is seeing it. You are 
seeing your gas prices go through the 
roof. You are seeing your prices at the 
grocery store going through the roof. 
Why do we have inflation? Well, in-
flation comes from debt. When the 
United States runs up a debt, it is sold. 
Foreign countries buy the debt, Ameri-
cans buy the debt, but the biggest pur-
chaser of our debt is the Federal Re-
serve. 
When the Federal Reserve buys the 
debt, do they buy it with money that 
they have sort of laying around? Do 
you go to the Federal Reserve, and 
some guy opens a big safe, and here is 
the money to buy the debt? No. The 
Federal 
Reserve 
doesn’t 
have 
any 
money, so the Federal Reserve simply 
prints up the money and buys the 
American debt. But what does that 
mean? When the Federal Reserve prints 
the money to buy the debt, this floods 
the system with money. So we are 
flooded with money right now. In the 
last 2 years, we borrowed $6 trillion, so 
$6 trillion is entered into the system. 
When you look at the amount of 
money that is being created, there is a 
measurement of money supply called 
the M2. If you look at it on an 
annualized basis, it has been going up 
at 15 percent a year. 
So inflation is an increase in the 
money supply. It is an increase in the 
money supply because they are buying 
the debt. So it is all related to spend-
ing. 
It is inexcusable that we will have no 
budget this year. It is inexcusable that 
the projection is for a trillion-dollar 
deficit in 1 year and yet there won’t 
even be a budget plan. There will be no 
plan to try to make the deficit less or 
to try to manage our money. 
But with this debt comes inflation. 
We are suffering from the worst infla-
tion we have had in 40 years. Who suf-
fers the most from inflation? The 
working class, those who are on fixed 
income, those who are retired, they are 
getting creamed by this. People are 
spending over $100 filling up their gas 
tank now. This is a real problem. 
So a balanced budget is not an aca-
demic exercise. It is not something 
that is theoretical. Our deficit has real 
impacts. Our deficit is leading to infla-
tion. So what I have proposed for the 
last several years is a balanced budget, 
a budget that balances gradually over 5 
years by having across-the-board cuts.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2959 
June 15, 2022 
When I started introducing this budg-
et several years ago, you could simply 
freeze spending, and if you froze spend-
ing, we would grow out of the deficit. 
By 5 years, by not increasing spending, 
you would have a balanced budget. 
That was rejected by all the Democrats 
and about half of the Republicans. 
So then we went another year or two, 
and spending increased. As spending in-
creased and got worse, a freeze would 
no longer balance the budget in 5 
years, so we introduced the Penny 
Plan. The Penny Plan was to cut 1 per-
cent a year for 5 years, and it would 
balance. But still the Congress ignored 
my admonition on this, and the spend-
ing got worse. 
In the last couple of years, it has had 
to have been increased by a two-penny 
plan, meaning a 2-percent reduction in 
spending each year for 5 years would 
still lead to balance in 5 years. But 
Congress once again has ignored that. 
So last year when we introduced the 
5-year plan to balance the budget, it 
was called the Five Penny Plan. You 
had to reduce spending by 5 percent 
each year for 5 years. 
This year, it has gotten even worse. 
The $6 trillion spending spree of the 
last 2 years when they locked down the 
economy and basically bankrupted al-
most every business in the country— 
when that occurred, there was massive 
spending, massive debts, and now, this 
year, in order to balance the budget, it 
would take a 6-percent cut. 
But I would like to put this in per-
spective. If you ask people in Wash-
ington, their heads explode because 
they could never conceive of ever re-
ducing spending. In fact, spending 
hasn’t gone down really ever in real 
terms in recent history because the 
government 
grows 
and 
grows 
and 
grows. Your economy may shrink, your 
income may shrink, you may be unem-
ployed, but the government gets bigger 
and bigger and bigger. 
So if we want to tame government, if 
we want to get government to live 
within its means, if we want govern-
ment to balance its budget, it would 
take some work. People in Washington 
seem to think, oh, it could never hap-
pen, but if you talk to a business man 
or woman who has ever been through a 
recession or ever been through tough 
times, they will tell you that some-
times a business has to reduce by 10 
percent, 20 percent, 30 percent, to live 
within their means. 
What we are calling for here is not no 
government. We are not even calling 
for a minimal government. What we 
are calling for is a government that 
lives within its means. Right now, liv-
ing within its means would be a gov-
ernment that brings in $4.8 trillion, 
which is how much tax revenue comes 
in, would spend $4.8 trillion. So still 
the vast majority of things the govern-
ment does, it could still continue to do, 
but it would have to spend less. We 
would have to have real restraint in 
spending. 
The best way to perceive it is this: 
Imagine the thing that you want from 
government that you think is so pop-
ular, nobody could touch. Let’s take 
for example research for cancer or re-
search for Alzheimer’s disease, some-
thing that so many people advocate, so 
many people are emotionally charged 
with. 
Well, when people come to Wash-
ington and they ask me about ‘‘I have 
this’’ or ‘‘My parents have this, and I 
want research money to go to this,’’ 
what I typically will say to them is 
‘‘You know we are out of money. You 
know that we have this massive deficit, 
and it has led to this great inflation 
that is across the land. What if we told 
everybody that they had to have a lit-
tle bit less?’’ They look at me and they 
say ‘‘Well, what would that mean?’’ 
and I say ‘‘Well, let’s say that your re-
search project—the cancer research or 
the Alzheimer’s research—got $100 mil-
lion last year. In order for all of us to 
tighten our belt, in order for all of us 
to balance the budget so we can be 
stronger, in order to tame the inflation 
that is eating us alive, you would get 
$94 million next year.’’ 
So we are not talking about sort of 
eliminating whole facets of govern-
ment; what we are talking about is ev-
erybody would have to deal with less. 
There is so much waste throughout 
government. You look at the National 
Science 
Foundation. 
The 
National 
Science Foundation is one of the most 
wasteful Agencies in government. 
You go back 50 years, and you look at 
William Proxmire. In the early 1970s, 
William Proxmire began giving an 
award called the Golden Fleece Award. 
What he would give an award for was 
wasteful spending, and almost always, 
it came to the National Science Foun-
dation. One of the first ones he gave an 
award for was $50,000 to discover what 
makes people fall in love. He just 
thought it was ridiculous that we 
would be spending money on that, and 
I agree. But it didn’t get better; it got 
worse. 
The National Science Foundation has 
never had a reduction in its money. It 
always gets more money. This year— 
and this is why this is a bipartisan 
problem—the Republicans and Demo-
crats got together, and we nearly dou-
bled the income or nearly doubled the 
appropriations for the National Science 
Foundation. 
What are some other kinds of great 
research coming out of this organiza-
tion? 
Well, they did a study to see whether 
or not selfies make you happy. So if 
you take a selfie of yourself smiling 
and then look at it later in the day, 
does that make you feel better about 
yourself? That would cost a little over 
a million dollars. 
They did a study also on the mating 
call of male Panamanian frogs. They 
said: Well, we want to know whether 
the country frogs have a different mat-
ing call than the city frogs. As some-
one who comes from the country, I can 
tell you there is a different mating call 
in the country than there is in the city. 
But that cost us about half-a-million 
dollars. 
Another study was $2 million to find 
out if the person in front of you sneezes 
on the food in the cafeteria, are you 
more or less likely to take that food? 
Another study was three-quarters of 
a million dollars, studying whether or 
not Japanese quail, on cocaine—wheth-
er or not they are more sexually pro-
miscuous when they use cocaine. 
I mean, the studies go on endlessly. 
So what did Congress do? Instead of 
telling them: Why don’t we give them 
one penny less; why don’t we give them 
99 percent of their budget, or this year 
why don’t we give them 94 percent of 
the budget, instead we gave them 200 
percent of their budget. Do you think 
the National Science Foundation is 
going to be more frugal now that we 
have nearly doubled their budget? 
But this is the kind of great ideas 
that are coming out of Congress, and 
this one turned out to be a bipartisan 
idea. All of the Democrats and half the 
Republicans voted to nearly double the 
size of the National Science Founda-
tion. So you will get more waste, more 
abuse, and more debt. 
The thing is, we bring in a lot of 
money. We bring in $4.8 trillion. Could 
we not simply spend what comes in? 
Part of the problem also is most of the 
bills are not read. Most of the appro-
priations bills come in here at the last 
moment, are 2,000 pages, and no one 
gets to read them until hours before-
hand. 
And so what they do is they have re-
newed programs year after year. There 
is a process up here where we authorize 
spending. So one committee is sup-
posed to say, is the spending working, 
and then the other committee appro-
priates the money. We don’t even both-
er to reauthorize these things. We just 
keep reappropriating the money year 
after year. 
Someone will have this great idea 
and say, well, we need to do something 
about homelessness, and everybody 
will say, well, that is such a well-mean-
ing—they intend to do it, and they will 
do it. But nobody looks up the fact 
that we already have 80 other programs 
doing the same thing. 
Nobody ever looks at whether the 
program is working. Nobody ever fig-
ures out whether anything that we are 
spending on money is viable and doing 
us any good, and so it just adds up. 
People come and say: Oh, well, this is 
something we have to do. We have to 
send $40 billion to Ukraine. Where does 
it come from? If you really think it is 
such a great idea, why don’t we have a 
Ukraine war tax? Why don’t we do $500 
per taxpayer, and you would have 
enough for Ukraine. No, they just want 
to add it on the tab. 
But it is worse than that. It is so ir-
responsible that the party in charge 
will produce no budget. So we have 
nearly $5 trillion coming in; nearly $6 
trillion going out the door, and there 
will be no budget. It is inexcusable. 
We have the largest economy in the 
world. We have the largest government

in the world, and we will have no budg-
et this year. So what I have done and 
will continue to do is to produce a 
budget that balances in 5 years; this is 
consistent with the balanced budget 
amendment to the Constitution. 
And the other reason we do 5 years is 
that some people have come forward in 
the past and said that we will balance 
it in 10. It becomes so long and unbe-
lievable with the cuts in years 9 and 10 
that they never happen; that it really 
hasn’t become a good document even 
when budgets are put forward. 
I think if we were to balance our 
budget, I think we would be a stronger 
Nation. It is the way we would combat 
inflation. If you see the people rep-
resenting the party in power, the 
Democrats, you see them on TV, they 
are scratching their heads; they have 
no idea. They are like we have tried ev-
erything. But they don’t even under-
stand the problem. They have no idea 
where inflation is coming from. 
Inflation comes from debt. When the 
Federal Reserve buys the debt, that 
creates the inflation. Because the Fed-
eral Reserve has no money, the money 
is printed up, and the money floods the 
system. 
But it is also part of a bait and 
switch. These are people who run for 
office and say: We will bring you free 
things. We will bring you baubles. We 
will bring you manna. We will give you 
free stuff. We all instinctively know 
that nothing in life is really free. 
So the free stuff that they are going 
to bring to you is paid for through in-
flation. 
So we have to get away from this. We 
have to get to the point where we say 
that we are smarter than this. When a 
politician calls you up and says: Give 
me your Social Security number and I 
will send you a thousand dollars, that 
is what this is. It is an internet scam. 
It is a phone scam. 
They are asking for your vote by say-
ing: We are going to give you free stuff. 
There is no free lunch. There is nothing 
in life that you will get without work-
ing. But what we have done is political 
parties and politicians—sometimes in 
both parties—offer free stuff to people. 
But right now we are paying the pen-
alty. We are paying the piper. We are 
paying the inflation tax. 
And the inflation tax is a tax because 
we have overspent. Inflation will con-
tinue to get worse until we begin to re-
duce the debt. You have got to quit 
digging the hole. We have this massive 
hole of debt, and we have to quit 
digging the hole deeper. So this budget 
will be a budget that balances in 5 
years, and I recommend a ‘‘yes’’ vote.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
120TH ANNIVERSARY OF GAYLORD 
SPECIALTY HEALTHCARE 
∑ Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, 
today, I rise to recognize Gaylord Spe-
cialty Healthcare as it celebrates 120 
years of outstanding service in Con-
necticut. Throughout its existence, 
Gaylord 
has 
changed 
with 
the 
healthcare needs of the people of Con-
necticut and indeed across the Nation, 
while maintaining a reputation for ex-
cellence and superior professionalism. 
The health system was first founded 
in 1902 as a tuberculosis sanatorium. 
Gaylord Sanatorium provided long- 
term treatment for half a century 
when the disease was endemic, treating 
patients including playwright Eugene 
O’Neill. In 1926, the U.S. Public Health 
Laboratory National Research Com-
mittee selected Gaylord’s facilities as 
the first they used in the country. In 
1948, Gaylord Farm Sanatorium was re-
named to Gaylord Hospital, restruc-
turing to treat people with chronic ill-
nesses. By 1954, Gaylord Hospital be-
came the first hospital in New England 
to specialize in comprehensive rehabili-
tation. 
Today, Gaylord Specialty Healthcare 
is an extensive health system across 
the State of Connecticut that focuses 
exclusively on medical rehabilitation. 
The hospital in Wallingford is a leading 
center for rehabilitation, and it is one 
of only two long-term acute care hos-
pitals in the world—and the only one in 
the United States. Gaylord received 
certification from the Commission on 
Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facili-
ties in recognition of its outstanding 
patient care. They offer an extensive 
breadth of treatment and accreditation 
opportunities. Gaylord is further cer-
tified by the Joint Commission and the 
American 
Association 
of 
Cardio-
vascular and Pulmonary Rehabilita-
tion thanks to its exemplary stand-
ards. 
I have had the privilege of visiting 
Gaylord Hospital on a number of occa-
sions. This April, I was proud to join 
members of their staff to celebrate 
their new physical medicine and reha-
bilitation physicians residency pro-
gram, made possible thanks to $1.2 mil-
lion in Federal funding. This program 
will be the first of its kind in Con-
necticut, and it will play a critical role 
in ensuring our State has sufficient re-
sources for specialty medical profes-
sionals. Having spoken with staff and 
patients at Gaylord, I can attest first-
hand to the extraordinary care, com-
passion, and expertise demonstrated 
there. Gaylord Hospital’s work is a 
credit to our State. 
As Gaylord Hospital celebrates its 
anniversary this October, I applaud 
them on their extraordinary record of 
accomplishment. I hope my colleagues 
will join me in congratulating Gaylord 
Specialty Healthcare on 120 years of 
excellence.∑

REMEMBERING STEPHEN ‘‘STEVE’’ 
H. SACHS 
∑ Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, next 
Tuesday, June 21, there will be a me-
morial service to honor Stephen H. 
Sachs, who died on January 12 at his 
home in Baltimore at the age of 87. 
Steve Sachs was U.S. Attorney for 
Maryland for 3 years and Maryland’s 
Attorney General for two terms. He 
was one of the finest lawyers in the Na-
tion—a proud son of Maryland, a proud 
son of Baltimore. He was an indefati-
gable, ever optimistic Orioles fan. He 
had a brilliant intellect and a spar-
kling sense of humor. 
Steve was born in Baltimore on Jan-
uary 31, 1934. His father was director of 
the Baltimore Jewish Council and a 
labor arbitrator, and his mother was a 
homemaker. Steve received a bach-
elor’s degree in 1954 from Haverford 
College and then served in the Army 
from 1955 to 1957. He received a Ful-
bright scholarship to study at the Uni-
versity of Oxford in England. He re-
ceived his law degree from Yale Law 
School in 1960. He worked as a pros-
ecutor in the U.S. Attorney’s Office for 
the District of Maryland. In 1967, then- 
President Lyndon Johnson appointed 
Steve as the U.S. Attorney for the Dis-
trict of Maryland, a position he held 
until 1970. 
Steve 
prosecuted 
cases 
involving 
white-collar crime and public corrup-
tion. In 1968, he prosecuted Vietnam 
war protesters known as the Catons-
ville Nine, Roman Catholic anti-war 
activists who broke into the Selective 
Service office in Catonsville, MD, in an 
attempt to destroy draft records. It 
was a high-profile case. The Rev. Dan-
iel Berrigan and his brother, the Rev. 
Philip Berrigan, led activists on a raid 
at Draft Board 33 in Catonsville. Steve 
secured a guilty verdict in Federal 
court for destroying government prop-
erty. 
Fifty years later, in a retrospective 
article in the ‘‘Baltimore Sun’’, Steve 
wrote with a searing honesty, ‘‘I be-
lieved then, and believe now, that the 
nine were brave men and women who 
acted out of a conviction that the war 
in Vietnam was profoundly evil. But I 
believed then, and I believe now, that 
the conduct of the nine—particularly 
their insistence that their action at 
Catonsville should have been condoned 
because they were ‘right’—offends both 
the rule of law and a fundamental 
tenet of the American democracy.’’ I 
think that statement captures Steve’s 
character perfectly. 
Steve was in private practice from 
1970 to 1978 when he ran an outsider 
campaign to become Maryland’s Attor-
ney General. He didn’t align himself 
with 
any 
gubernatorial 
candidate, 
which had been the practice. He stated, 
‘‘The attorney general should be inde-
pendent. The attorney general should 
be the people’s lawyer.’’ After several 
public corruption scandals, Maryland-
ers appreciated Steve’s unquestioned 
integrity and were receptive to his ac-
tivist, reform-oriented campaign. He 
served two terms as Attorney General 
and practically reinvented the posi-
tion. He established a strong Consumer 
Protection Division within the Office 
of 
Attorney 
General 
that 
assisted 
Marylanders against corporate abuse. 
As the State’s Attorney General, he ar-
gued three cases before the U.S. Su-
preme 
Court—and 
won 
all 
three. 
Steve’s 8 years as Attorney General 
overlapped with my service as speaker 
of the house of delegates, where I had 
the benefit of Steven’s excellent coun-
sel. 
In 1986, Steve decided to run for Gov-
ernor, but he lost the Democratic pri-
mary to then-Baltimore mayor Wil-
liam Donald Schaefer. After that de-
feat, Steve returned to private practice 
as a partner in the Washington, DC, of-
fice of Wilmer-Hale, then known as 
Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering. He retired 
from the firm in 1999. 
Steve’s political career may have of-
ficially ‘‘ended’’ when he was just 52, 
but over the years, he became an elder 
statesman of Maryland politics. As his 
former colleagues at Wilmer-Hale said, 
‘‘Steve was an elegant writer, a power-
ful advocate and an extremely accom-
plished trial lawyer. He was a generous 
partner, colleague and mentor. He 
taught a generation of lawyers how to 
write a brief, take a deposition and try 
a case . . . He was a mensch.’’ 
Steve’s passion for justice never 
waned. After he retired from Wilmer- 
Hale, he joined the Public Justice Cen-
ter, where he had a significant impact 
on the development of the center’s Ap-
pellate Advocacy Project. Steve was a 
passionate advocate of the civil right 
to counsel movement, helping to estab-
lish the National Coalition for a Civil 
Right to Counsel. In 2008, then-Mary-
land Governor Martin O’Malley ap-
pointed Steve to head an independent

review of the Maryland State Police, 
which had infiltrated activist groups 
that were lawfully protesting against 
the death penalty and the war in Iraq. 
Steve may be gone, but his legacy is 
firmly established. Last Friday, I had 
the honor of attending the investiture 
of Erek Baron as the first Black U.S. 
Attorney for the District of Maryland. 
Erek is just one of Steve’s countless 
proteges carrying on his mission. Erek 
said, ‘‘Steve Sachs was one of the most 
respected public servants in Maryland’s 
history and a personal mentor to me 
and many others.’’ 
Deuteronomy 16:20 implores us, ‘‘Jus-
tice, justice you shall pursue . . .’’. 
That was Steve Sachs’ guiding prin-
ciple. He did all he could to make the 
world a better place. It wasn’t always 
easy or comfortable, but he understood 
the importance of justice under the 
law. I respected his legal passion, and I 
am grateful that he shared it with gen-
erations of Maryland attorneys as a 
mentor and a friend. On behalf of the 
Senate, I send my condolences to his 
daughter Elisabeth Sachs, his son Leon 
Sachs, his three grandchildren, and 
other family members and all those 
who were fortunate to have him as a 
friend, colleague, or mentor and mourn 
his passing.∑

REMEMBERING SHERRA FERTITTA 
∑ Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I rise 
today to celebrate the life of Mrs. 
Sherra Fertitta of Monroe, LA. Mrs. 
Fertitta leaves behind a legacy of gen-
erosity, optimism, and intellect after a 
remarkable career as a student, educa-
tor, and incredibly engaged member of 
her community. 
Mrs. Fertitta was proud to teach for 
more than 25 years across three States 
before retiring in 2010 from Ouachita 
Parish High School. Upon completion 
of her impressive teaching career, Ms. 
Fertitta accepted the title of edu-
cational director of Vantage Health 
Plan of Louisiana. Here, she created an 
educational series via weekly radio 
interviews with Representative Mi-
chael Echols for public health edu-
cation purposes. 
Ms. Fertitta continued her commu-
nity involvement as a member and core 
organizer of OPWRC for more than a 
decade. She spearheaded many projects 
during her time with OPWRC, includ-
ing an event during August 2020 that 
safely provided a forum for Fifth Dis-
trict congressional candidates and vot-
ers to interact ahead of the election 
season amidst a global pandemic. 
I extend my deepest condolences to 
the family and friends of Ms. Fertitta, 
who have lost an invaluable loved one. 
Her memory will live on with her chil-
dren, 
grandchildren, 
great-grand-
children, and all whom she encountered 
as a dedicated, kindhearted educator.∑

TRIBUTE TO PATRICK KOLE 
∑ Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, along 
with my colleagues Senator JIM RISCH, 
Representative MIKE SIMPSON and Rep-
resentative RUSS
FULCHER, we con-
gratulate Pat Kole on his well-earned 
retirement from serving as vice presi-
dent, legal and government affairs of 
the Idaho Potato Commission. 
Pat has been a steady hand at the 
helm of the Idaho Potato Commission, 
IPC, promoting the iconic Idaho pota-
toes for more than 25 years. Serving as 
the IPC’s vice president, legal and gov-
ernment affairs, Pat has managed Fed-
eral, State, and local government af-
fairs for the IPC, directed its trade-
mark-licensing program, directed its 
research and education program, and 
supervised its IT needs. His work has 
included litigating certification mark 
cases, registering certification marks 
in many jurisdictions, testifying before 
the U.S. Congress and advocating for 
public policy supporting Idaho potato 
producers’ ability to grow this central 
agricultural product and feed con-
sumers at home and around the world. 
To say Pat has gone the extra mile to 
support Idaho potato production is an 
understatement, considering in 2005 he 
ran the Marine Corps Marathon as a 
representative of the IPC and to help 
promote the importance of complex 
carbohydrates, such as those found in 
Idaho potatoes. 
Pat, who earned his undergraduate 
degree at the University of Michigan 
and law degree from the University of 
Denver, has practiced law for more 
than 40 years. His experience, calm, 
persistence, and ability to dig into the 
crux of the problem have been instru-
mental in facing the challenges that 
have 
undoubtedly 
arisen 
over 
the 
years. This includes his thoughtful ad-
vocacy for measured approaches to 
help with the eradication of the pale 
cyst nematode, assist producers, and 
regain markets. More recently, Pat 
provided critical assistance and advo-
cacy for the needs of Idaho’s potato 
producers as relief efforts were consid-
ered for the historic agricultural dis-
ruptions caused by the COVID–19 pan-
demic. Throughout, Pat’s efforts and 
those of the Idaho potato producers he 
works with and supports have helped 
fortify the Idaho potato as a standout 
symbol of Idaho and U.S. agriculture. 
It is no surprise Pat has received rec-
ognitions for his attentive work. This 
includes Pat being named The Packer’s 
2022 Potato Person for All Seasons. 
Pat is known as someone who always 
does his homework and who carefully 
thinks through the details. That has 
made him and instrumental partner to 
us as we work on Federal policy affect-
ing the potato industry. We always 
know that when Pat raises an issue, he 
does so with scrupulous grounding, and 
we know we get a straight and accu-
rate response when we reach out to 
him for guidance. When policy ques-
tions arise that we know will affect the 
potato industry, Pat is the first we 
call. 
Thank you, Pat, for being such a 
trusted advocate for the Idaho potato 
industry all these years and your dec-
ades of service to the Gem State. Con-
gratulations, again, on your retire-
ment.∑

TRIBUTE TO ERIC ATKINSON 
∑ Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, I 
rise today to honor and recognize Mr. 
Eric Atkinson of Topeka, KS. 
Growing up on a farm outside of Win-
field, KS, Eric would listen to the radio 
at night as his way to stay connected 
with current events. Captivated by the 
transmissions that reached him, he be-
came involved with radio in high 
school, resulting in a lifelong passion 
for broadcasting. Eric graduated from 
Kansas State University with a broad-
casting degree and worked several jobs 
in radio, as well as on the family farm, 
before the opportunity to host ‘‘Agri-
culture Today’’ arose. He would go on 
to host the radio program for 39 years, 
broadcasting 
over 
9,000 
shows 
and 
interviewing hundreds of agriculture 
experts and professionals about the 
issues most relevant to Kansas agri-
culture. 
In the 39 years Eric hosted ‘‘Agri-
culture Today,’’ he made it his goal for 
the show to serve as a platform for ag-
riculture professionals to share their 
expertise. He made an effort to ask the 
most relevant questions and discuss 
important research topics during his 
time on air. Throughout his time on 
the radio, Eric has been credited as an 
accomplished professional who always 
worked hard to make sure the issues at 
hand were easily relatable for farmers 
across Kansas. His substantial presence 
in farm truck radios across the State 
as the host of ‘‘Agriculture Today’’ will 
continue to be on the hearts and minds 
of farmers and agribusiness officials. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in rec-
ognizing the wonderful impact Mr. Eric 
Atkinson has had on the agriculture 
industry and to honor him for his 39 
years of service to Kansas farmers.∑

TRIBUTE TO CHRIS LEON 
∑ Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, I 
rise today to honor and recognize Mr. 
Chris Leon of Wichita, KS. 
Chris started volunteering for Kansas 
Honor Flight 8 years ago. Kansas 
Honor Flight is an all-volunteer orga-
nization dedicated to honoring Kansas 
veterans of World War II, Korea, and 
Vietnam by sending these heroes on an 
all-expense-paid journey of honor and 
remembrance to visit their memorials 
in Washington, DC. Chris has dem-
onstrated outstanding leadership in his 
volunteer work with ALLmetal Recy-
cling, and thanks to his efforts crush-
ing aluminum cans, Kansas Honor 
Flight has been able to send countless 
veterans on a trip of a lifetime to 
Washington, DC. Chris is now 31 years 
old and continues to demonstrate his 
leadership and support for our veterans 
through his exemplary volunteer work. 
I thoroughly enjoyed meeting Chris 
on his visit to Washington DC, and I 
can’t wait to see what he accomplishes

RECOGNIZING THE ANDOVER, 
KANSAS, YMCA STAFF 
∑ Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, I 
rise today to honor and recognize the 
staff of the YMCA in Andover, KS. 
On Friday, April 29, 2022, an EF–3 tor-
nado touched down in Sedgewick Coun-
ty, KS, and left a path of destruction 
nearly 13 miles long behind. The 165- 
mile-per-hour winds created by the tor-
nado injured four people and damaged 
well over 300 buildings in Andover. One 
of the buildings that sustained heavy 
damage was the Andover YMCA. The 
damage done by the tornado would cer-
tainly have been much more severe if it 
wasn’t for the quick thinking of the 
YMCA staff. 
I would like to honor and thank the 
staff of the Andover YMCA who helped 
save those in the building on the 
evening of the tornado. As the tornado 
approached, members of the YMCA 
staff made announcements on the loud-
speakers and helped direct individuals 
to the safest areas of the building, pri-
marily interior locker rooms. As the 
tornado hit the building, cars were 
thrown through walls and windows, 
with many parts of the building being 
completely destroyed. The staff work-
ing at the YMCA that day saved many 
lives through their quick thinking to 
move gym-goers to safety. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in rec-
ognizing the Andover YMCA staff, as 
well as in thanking them for all they 
did to keep their fellow Kansans safe.∑

Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, former 
Google 
executive 
chairman 
Eric 
Schmidt, in writing with Jared Cohen, 
once said: 
Modern technology platforms [are] even 
more powerful than most people realize [and 
that] our future world will be profoundly al-
tered by their adoption and successfulness in 
societies everywhere. 
There is no question that Big Tech 
plays an ever increasing role in our 
lives. I imagine most of us wouldn’t 
even be able to count the number of 
times a day we interact with tech-
nology platforms, from checking our 
email to spending time on social media 
to searching on Google, and the pan-
demic only accelerated that trend as 
our reliance on technology for every-
thing from social connection to food 
delivery increased.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2970 
June 15, 2022 
I don’t need to tell anyone that tech-
nology platforms offer lots of benefits. 
They are sources of entertainment and 
information. They make it easier to 
stay close to distant loved ones. They 
allow us to shop, to conduct business, 
and to connect with friends, and to ad-
vocate for causes that we believe in. 
But I also don’t need to tell anyone 
that technology platforms have a more 
problematic side as well. One big prob-
lem arises from the increased ability 
Big Tech has to shape the information 
we see through the use of opaque algo-
rithms. Gone are the days when you 
logged into Facebook and just con-
sumed content that had been posted 
chronologically since your previous 
login. Now, Facebook and other social 
media platforms use algorithms to 
shape your news feed and provide sug-
gestions for additional content, empha-
sizing posts that the platforms think 
you will be interested in and deempha-
sizing other posts. 
Now, obviously, algorithms are not 
all bad. Most of us like it when 
YouTube automatically plays another 
video by our favorite band instead of 
switching to something completely un-
related. But if a 15-year-old kid watch-
es a video and then YouTube’s algo-
rithms lead him or her down a path of 
inappropriate videos—well, I think you 
could see that is a problem. 
A 2021 Wall Street Journal investiga-
tion into TikTok revealed how easy it 
is for young users to be bombarded 
with inappropriate and disturbing con-
tent. And thanks to limited or opaque 
disclosures, people are often not aware 
of just how much their experience on 
technology platforms is being shaped 
by opaque algorithms. 
When we search for something on 
Google, most of us don’t spend a lot of 
time thinking about the fact that 
Google is tailoring our search results 
to what it thinks we want to see or 
what it wants us to see. But the fact of 
the matter is that almost all of the in-
formation being presented to us by Big 
Tech platforms like social media and 
Google is being filtered and tailored to 
us. And while, again, this can have a 
positive side, it can also have negative 
consequences, ranging from political 
polarization to addictive behavior. 
As technology platforms play an ever 
more dominant role in our lives, I be-
lieve platforms should be required to 
make users aware of the fact that an 
algorithm is controlling the content 
they see. To that end, I have offered 
multiple pieces of legislation to in-
crease Big Tech’s transparency and to 
give consumers more control over their 
experience. 
My bipartisan Filter Bubble Trans-
parency Act would require large-scale 
internet platforms to notify users that 
the content they are seeing has been 
selected for them by secret algorithms, 
creating a unique universe of informa-
tion for each user—a phenomenon that 
is often referred to as the ‘‘filter bub-
ble.’’ Platforms would also be required 
to give users the choice to switch to a 
version of the platform that is filter 
bubble-free. 
I have also introduced the bipartisan 
Platform Accountability and Trans-
parency Act—or the PACT Act—to 
shed greater light on the secretive con-
tent moderation processes internet 
platforms use. 
The PACT Act would require internet 
platforms to prepare biannual trans-
parency 
reports 
outlining 
material 
that they have removed from their 
sites or chosen to deemphasize. These 
reports would have to be made avail-
able to the public and not in inten-
tionally complicated legalese. Plat-
forms would have to provide clearly 
understandable versions of these re-
ports to consumers. 
The PACT Act would require tech-
nology platforms to provide consumers 
with greater due process when it comes 
to content these platforms remove or 
otherwise moderate. So if Facebook, 
for example, removed one of your 
posts, it would have to tell you why 
and would have to provide a way for 
you to appeal that decision. 
Today, I am introducing a third piece 
of legislation to increase transparency 
and accountability at Big Tech. This 
bill is called the Political Bias in Algo-
rithm Sorting Emails Act, otherwise 
known as the Political BIAS Emails 
Act. The Political BIAS Emails Act is 
intended to address the problem polit-
ical campaigns on both sides of the 
aisle have faced in getting their cam-
paign emails to Americans. 
A recent study from North Carolina 
State University found that during the 
2020 election, Google’s Gmail—the larg-
est 
email 
provider 
in 
the 
United 
States—sent greater numbers of Re-
publican campaign emails to spam 
folders, while Yahoo! and Outlook sent 
greater numbers of Democratic cam-
paign emails to spam, albeit by lesser 
margins than Google did for Repub-
lican campaign emails. Well, that is a 
problem. 
Americans should have access to po-
litical communications from both par-
ties so that they can make their own 
informed decisions on what candidates 
they wish to support. Disproportion-
ately filtering out information from 
candidates of one party—or from a cer-
tain candidate within a particular po-
litical party, as happened during the 
Democratic 
Presidential 
primary— 
skews the information available to 
Americans. 
I do not believe that Big Tech should 
be deciding what information individ-
uals receive. Americans are free to opt 
out of whatever email communications 
they wish, including political commu-
nications, but Big Tech should not be 
making that decision for them. My Po-
litical BIAS Emails Act would prohibit 
email services from using filtering al-
gorithms on emails sent from political 
campaigns where the candidate is run-
ning from Federal office. 
Gmail and other email services’ 
inboxing practices are a black box to 
consumers, and they operate with very 
little accountability. To address this, 
my legislation would require email 
services to submit transparency re-
ports noting the number of emails from 
both Republican and Democratic cam-
paigns flagged as spam, as well as pro-
vide information to political cam-
paigns on request to help ensure that 
voters are receiving relevant informa-
tion on every candidate’s policy posi-
tions. 
This legislation would help ensure 
that Americans and not Big Tech—I 
emphasize not Big Tech—are making 
the decisions on what campaign com-
munications they want to receive. 
Internet platforms have enhanced 
Americans’ lives in a number of ways, 
as I have already mentioned. But as 
these platforms play an ever-greater 
role in shaping the information we re-
ceive, it is vital that we insist on ade-
quate transparency and ensure that 
Americans are given the opportunity 
to opt out of the filter bubble. Amer-
ican people ought to be in charge of 
what they see, not Big Tech companies. 
I will continue to work to advance 
the various bills that I have introduced 
to promote greater transparency in Big 
Tech. And as ranking member of the 
Commerce Committee’s Subcommittee 
on 
Communications, 
Media, 
and 
Broadband, I will continue to focus on 
ways to ensure that Big Tech is ac-
countable to consumers. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the text of the 
bill be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the text of 
the bill was ordered to be printed in 
the RECORD, as follows:

resentatives of the United States of America in

675—COM-
MEMORATING THE 100TH ANNI-
VERSARY 
OF 
THE 
AMERICAN 
HELLENIC 
EDUCATIONAL 
PRO-
GRESSIVE ASSOCIATION 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN (for himself and 
Mr. RUBIO) submitted the following res-
olution; which was referred to the 
Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 675 
Whereas 
the 
American 
Hellenic 
Edu-
cational Progressive Association (referred to 
in this preamble as ‘‘AHEPA’’) was founded 
on July 26, 1922, in Atlanta, Georgia, by 8 vi-
sionary Greek immigrants to help unify, or-
ganize, and protect individuals of all ethnic, 
racial, and religious backgrounds against the 
bigotry, discrimination, and defamation per-
petrated predominantly by the Ku Klux 
Klan; 
Whereas the mission of AHEPA is to pro-
mote the Hellenic ideals of ancient Greece, 
which include philanthropy, education, civic 
responsibility, and family and individual ex-
cellence through community service and vol-
unteerism; 
Whereas, since the inception of AHEPA, 
the organization has instilled in the mem-
bers of AHEPA an understanding of their 
Hellenic heritage and an awareness of the 
contributions that Hellenic heritage has 
made to the development of democratic prin-
ciples and governance in the United States 
and throughout the world; 
Whereas AHEPA has done much through-
out the history of the organization to foster 
patriotism in the United States; 
Whereas members of AHEPA have served 
in the Armed Forces of the United States to 
protect the freedom of the people of the 
United States and to preserve those demo-
cratic ideals that are part of the Hellenic 
legacy; 
Whereas, in World War II, members of 
AHEPA parachuted behind enemy lines in 
Nazi-occupied Greece to help liberate Greece; 
Whereas 
AHEPA 
raised 
more 
than 
$253,000,000 for United States war bonds dur-
ing World War II, and, as a result of the ef-
fort, AHEPA was named an official issuing 
agent for United States war bonds by the De-
partment of the Treasury, an honor that no 
other civic organization had yet achieved; 
Whereas, in 1990, the members of AHEPA 
donated $612,000 toward the restoration of 
the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, New 
York, for which AHEPA received special rec-
ognition by the Department of the Interior;

order to— 
(1) provide affordable housing for older 
adults; 
(2) sponsor and support domestic violence

676—EX-
PRESSING 
SUPPORT 
FOR 
THE 
DESIGNATION OF JUNE 23, 2022, 
AS 
‘‘NATIONAL 
PELL 
GRANT 
DAY’’ 
Mrs. MURRAY (for herself and Mr. 
BLUNT) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Health, Education, Labor, 
and Pensions: 
S. RES. 676 
Whereas June 23 is the 50th anniversary of 
the signing of the Education Amendments 
Act of 1972 (Public Law 92–318, 86 Stat. 235) 
by President Richard Nixon; 
Whereas that Act established within the 
Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1001 
et seq.) the Basic Educational Opportunity 
Grant, later named the Federal Pell Grant 
(commonly known as the ‘‘Pell Grant’’) in 
honor of its sponsor Senator Claiborne Pell; 
Whereas, 50 years ago, Senator Pell stated 
that ‘‘for it’s through this Act that the 
dream of access, and opportunity for college 
education becomes a reality. It’s in this Act 
that we say a lack of financial wealth should 
not, and will not, stand in the way of a per-
son who has the talent, the desire and the 
drive to reach out for a college education.’’; 
Whereas, today, the Pell Grant program, 
which helps low-income students pursue 
higher education goals, maintains bipartisan 
support in Congress and with the public; 
Whereas, each year, Pell Grants help near-
ly 7,000,000 students, approximately 40 per-
cent of undergraduate students, pursue and 
succeed in higher education; 
Whereas Pell Grants help students from all 
50 States, the District of Columbia, and the 
territories of the United States and from 
rural areas to cities to everywhere in be-
tween; 
Whereas the Pell Grant program is well- 
targeted to meet the needs of students with 
demonstrated financial need, with the vast 
majority of Pell Grant recipients having 
family incomes of $40,000 or less; 
Whereas extensive research shows that the 
Pell Grant program increases college enroll-
ment and completion among low- and mod-
erate-income students; 
Whereas Pell Grants are critical for stu-
dents from historically underrepresented 
backgrounds, including 58 percent of Black 
students, 47 percent of Hispanic students, 51 
percent of American Indian and Alaska Na-
tive students, 48 percent of first-generation 
students, 52 percent of students who are par-
ents, and 39 percent of students who are vet-
erans of the Armed Forces; 
Whereas each eligible student may use a 
Pell Grant at the institution of their choice, 
which includes public, private, 2-year, and 4- 
year institutions; 
Whereas the Pell Grant program is a prov-
en investment to boost future economic mo-
bility, with college graduates paying more in 
taxes and earning more in after-tax income 
than high school graduates; and 
Whereas, over the past 50 years, the Pell 
Grant 
program 
has 
helped 
more 
than 
80,000,000 students in the United States: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) celebrates the 50th anniversary of the 
Federal Pell Grant program on June 23, 2022; 
(2) expresses support for the designation of 
June 23 as ‘‘National Pell Grant Day’’; and 
(3) encourages the people of the United 
States to celebrate National Pell Grant Day 
by— 
(A) recognizing the more than 80,000,000 in-
dividual low- and middle-income students 
who have benefitted from the Federal Pell 
Grant program since its establishment; and 
(B) celebrating the success stories of such 
students, and ensuring the same access for 
future students.

Mortain and St. Barthelmy, France, and Hill 
317 against a German counterattack in Au-

MURRAY, and Ms. DUCKWORTH) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which 
was referred to the Committee on the 
Judiciary: 
S. RES. 678 
Whereas the United States is stronger if all 
individuals have the opportunity to live up 
to their full potential; 
Whereas about 15 percent of health care 
workers in the United States are immi-
grants, including (in order of highest per-
centage of health care workers who are for-
eign born)— 
(1) 29 percent of physicians; 
(2) 25 percent of nursing, psychiatric, and 
home health aides; 
(3) 24 percent of dentists; 
(4) 20 percent of pharmacists; 
(5) 19 percent of dental assistants; 
(6) 15 percent of medical assistants; 
(7) 15 percent of registered nurses; 
(8) 15 percent of licensed practical and li-
censed vocational nurses; 
(9) 12 percent of dieticians and nutrition-
ists; and 
(10) 12 percent of optometrists; 
Whereas the Association of American Med-
ical Colleges attested to the Supreme Court 
of the United States that the health care 
system of the United States relies on immi-
grant health care providers in their current 
roles; 
Whereas immigrants working in health 
care professions serve throughout the United 
States and often in rural or underserved 
communities; 
Whereas immigrants fill approximately 1⁄3 
of physician roles in the United States; 
Whereas immigrants working in a health 
care occupation range from those granted 
temporary protected status under section 244 
of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 
U.S.C. 1254a) or deferred action pursuant to 
the memorandum of the Department of 
Homeland 
Security 
entitled 
‘‘Exercising 
Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to In-
dividuals Who Came to the United States as 
Children’’ issued on June 15, 2012 (referred to 
in this preamble as ‘‘DACA’’) to naturalized 
United States citizens; 
Whereas more than 12 percent of the immi-
grants working in health care occupations 
(310,000 individuals) are humanitarian mi-
grants, including refugees, asylees, special 
immigrant visa holders, and Cuban and Hai-
tian entrants; 
Whereas 50,000 DACA recipients perform 
critical roles in the health care industry; 
Whereas the medical students, residents, 
and physicians who rely on DACA for their 
ability to practice medicine and provide 
medical care to approximately 4,600 patients 
per year; 
Whereas, in response to COVID–19, immi-
grants put their own lives on the line to save 
lives every day, working as diagnostic and 
treatment practitioners, physician assist-
ants, physicians, nurses, health aides, nurs-
ing assistants and orderlies, health care sup-
port workers, medical students and resi-
dents, and health technologists and techni-
cians; 
Whereas more than 5,200,000 undocumented 
immigrants, including more than 1⁄2 of all 
DACA recipients (400,000 individuals) and the 
majority of Temporary Protected Status 
holders (more than 220,000 individuals) are 
considered essential critical infrastructure 
workers; 
Whereas immigrant essential workers, in-
cluding first responders, health care work-
ers, agricultural workers and meat packers, 
child care providers, and hospitality and 
transportation 
workers, 
have 
heroically 
helped provide medical care, food, shelter, 
and comfort to the individuals of the United 
States impacted by COVID–19; 
Whereas undocumented immigrants alone 
contribute an estimated $227,000,000,000 of 
spending power annually to the United 
States economy, after the payment of 
$49,000,000,000 of combined Federal, State, 
and local taxes each year; 
Whereas the majority of farm workers in 
the United States are immigrants, and re-
gardless of politics, have been deemed ‘‘es-
sential workers’’ to maintaining a safe food 
supply for the United States during the 
COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas immigrants have served in the 
Armed Forces since the founding of the 
United States and have fought in every 
major conflict in United States history, in-
cluding the Civil War, World Wars I and II, 
and conflicts in Vietnam, Afghanistan, and 
Iraq; 
Whereas immigrants have put their lives 
on the line to protect the ideals of the 
United States and democracy, as well as 
lives of the people of the United States, by 
serving as translators and interpreters for 
the Armed Forces, including in Afghanistan 
and Iraq, and performing sensitive and trust-
ed activities for United States military per-
sonnel stationed with the International Se-
curity Assistance Force; 
Whereas immigrants who serve in emerg-
ing industries with pronounced labor short-
ages in the United States, such as artificial 
intelligence, that rely on science, tech-
nology, engineering, and mathematics (re-
ferred to in this preamble as ‘‘STEM’’) skills, 
not only bolster the economy but also en-
hance national security and global leader-
ship; 
Whereas, when immigrants have a trusting 
relationship with local law enforcement 
agencies, immigrants report crime and work 
with law enforcement agencies on neighbor-
hood crime reduction strategies; 
Whereas the United States has the largest 
number of immigrants in the world and 
those immigrants represent almost every 
country in the world, contributing to the 
rich diversity of people, cultures, cuisine, 
literature, art, language, academia, music, 
media, fashion, and customs; 
Whereas the United States is more diverse 
than ever before in its history, with greater 
shares than ever before of immigrants from 
India, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, the Phil-
ippines, El Salvador, Vietnam, Cuba, the Do-
minican Republic, South Korea, and Guate-
mala, and an increase of more than 90 per-
cent since 2000 of Black immigrants from 
across the African continent, the Caribbean, 
Jamaica, and Haiti; 
Whereas Black immigrants and their chil-
dren make up roughly 1⁄5 of the overall Black 
population in the United States (21 percent); 
Whereas, in response to recent civil unrest 
in the United States, immigrants of all back-
grounds have pledged their support to fight 
racial injustice, hand-in-hand with Black im-
migrants, to fight for accountability from 
law enforcement and the criminal justice 
system, and to demand that law enforcement 
protect all individuals, regardless of their 
skin color; 
Whereas celebrating the racial, ethnic, lin-
guistic, and religious differences of immi-
grants has resulted in a unified, patriotic, 
and prosperous United States; 
Whereas immigration has long been one of 
the greatest competitive advantages of the 
United States; 
Whereas immigrants of all skill levels have 
helped make the economy of the United 
States the strongest in the world, comple-
menting existing businesses in the United 
States in times of need and founding success-
ful businesses of their own; 
Whereas more than 40 percent of Fortune 
500 companies were founded by immigrants 
or 
their 
children, 
which 
generate 
$4,200,000,000,000 in annual revenue and em-
ploy millions of individuals in the United 
States; 
Whereas, although approximately 14 per-
cent of the population of the United States is 
immigrants, a considerably larger share of 
the labor force (18 percent) is immigrants; 
Whereas immigrants are entrepreneurial, 
self-starters who create their own oppor-
tunity and employment opportunities for 
others, with 12 percent of employed immi-
grants being self-employed compared to 9 
percent of employed, native-born individuals 
of the United States; 
Whereas immigrant-owned businesses pro-
vide jobs across the United States, sup-
porting the creation of additional jobs 
through entrepreneurial activity in addition 
to the jobs they fill within their business;

June 15, 2022 
Whereas immigrants are more likely to 
have advanced degrees than native-born peo-
ple of the United States; 
Whereas more than 1,000,000 international 
students are enrolled in colleges and univer-
sities across the United States, comprising 
about 5 percent of the total higher education 
population and helping make the United 
States the global leader in higher education; 
Whereas 
approximately 
100,000 
inter-
national students each year would hope to 
stay and work in the United States, if an im-
migration option were available to them; 
Whereas the immigration system of the 
United States has not been meaningfully up-
dated in nearly 30 years and is now outdated 
and overburdened, turning 
away 
highly 
skilled workers and international student 
graduates and putting the global leadership 
of the United States at risk; 
Whereas allowing international student 
graduates interested in remaining in the 
United States to secure a permanent immi-
gration status would expand the economy by 
$233,000,000,000 during the next decade and 
would help reduce STEM-related talent 
shortages by 25 percent; 
Whereas national security experts agree 
that it is essential for the United States to 
maintain its military exceptionalism by 
being the leader in advanced technologies 
such as artificial intelligence, cyber, quan-
tum, 
robotics, 
directed 
energy, 
and 
hypersonic weapons, which are all STEM 
fields where immigrants fill dangerous labor 
shortages in the United States; 
Whereas, due to population aging and 
longer life expectancy of the population in 
the United States requiring an increase in 
health care workers, immigrants are ex-
pected to fill a crucial need in the future 
health care system of the United States es-
sential to keeping the people of the United 
States healthy; 
Whereas, if undocumented individuals who 
came to the United States as children (com-
monly referred to as ‘‘Dreamers’’) alone were 
provided a pathway to citizenship, they 
would 
contribute 
approximately 
$799,000,000,000 to the economy of the United 
States during the next 10 years; 
Whereas future population growth in the 
United States will require increased immi-
gration, and by increasing immigration sub-
stantially, will keep the United States eco-
nomically competitive with China and other 
global economies and reduce future fiscal 
imbalances for popular programs like pro-
grams under the Social Security Act (42 
U.S.C. 301 et seq.); 
Whereas significantly increasing annual 
immigration levels would double the size of 
the United States economy by 2050, dramati-
cally lower the ratio of working-age individ-
uals to senior-age individuals, and increase 
the average income for workers in the 
United States; 
Whereas President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., 
most recently honored the accomplishments, 
contributions, and sacrifices of immigrants 
by proclaiming June 2022 to be ‘‘Immigrant 
Heritage Month’’ and by asking all people of 
the United States to observe June 2022 with 
appropriate programming and activities to 
remind individuals of the values of diversity, 
equity, and inclusion; and 
Whereas continued integration of immi-
grants from around the world in a manner 
that encourages and facilitates a pathway to 
citizenship, economic and social mobility, 
and civic engagement will perpetuate the 
prosperity of the United States and reinforce 
the patriotism all people of the United 
States feel for the United States, no matter 
the color of skin, country of origin, or reli-
gious background of the individual: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes June 2022 as ‘‘Immigrant 
Heritage Month’’ in honor of the contribu-
tions immigrants and their children have 
made to the United States throughout its 
history; 
(2) pledges to celebrate immigrant con-
tributions to, and immigrant heritages in, 
each State; 
(3) welcomes immigrants presently in the 
United States and individuals seeking to im-
migrate to the United States to contribute 
to the health, safety, diversity, and pros-
perity of the United States by finding their 
place in the vibrant, multiethnic, and inte-
grated society of the United States; 
(4) encourages the people of the United 
States to work with their immigrant neigh-
bors and colleagues to advance the current 
and future well-being of the United States; 
and 
(5) commits to working with fellow Mem-
bers of Congress, the executive agencies that 
administer immigration laws and policies, 
and the President to promote smart and just 
immigration policy for immigrants presently 
in the United States, their families, and indi-
viduals seeking to immigrate to the United

S. RES. 679 
Whereas news of the end of slavery did not 
reach the frontier areas of the United States, 
in particular the State of Texas and the 
other Southwestern States, until months 
after the conclusion of the Civil War, more 
than 21⁄2 years after President Abraham Lin-
coln issued the Emancipation Proclamation 
on January 1, 1863; 
Whereas, on June 19, 1865, Union soldiers, 
led by Major General Gordon Granger, ar-
rived in Galveston, Texas, with news that 
the Civil War had ended and the enslaved 
were free; 
Whereas African Americans who had been 
slaves in the Southwest celebrated June 19, 
commonly known as ‘‘Juneteenth National 
Independence Day’’, as inspiration and en-
couragement for future generations; 
Whereas 
African 
Americans 
from 
the 
Southwest have continued the tradition of 
observing Juneteenth National Independence 
Day for more than 150 years; 
Whereas Juneteenth National Independ-
ence Day began as a holiday in the State of 
Texas and is now a Federal holiday and cele-
brated by individuals in the United States 
from many walks of life as a special day of 
observance in recognition of the emanci-
pation of all slaves in the United States; 
Whereas Juneteenth National Independ-
ence Day celebrations have been held to 
honor African-American freedom while en-
couraging self-development and respect for 
all cultures; 
Whereas the faith and strength of char-
acter demonstrated by former slaves and the 
descendants of former slaves remain an ex-
ample for all people of the United States, re-
gardless of background, religion, or race; 
Whereas slavery was not officially abol-
ished until the ratification of the 13th 
Amendment to the Constitution of the 
United States in December 1865; and 
Whereas, over the course of its history, the 
United States has grown into a symbol of de-
mocracy and freedom around the world: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) 
commemorates 
June 
19, 
2022, 
as 
‘‘Juneteenth National Independence Day’’; 
(2) recognizes the historical significance of 
Juneteenth National Independence Day to 
the United States; 
(3) supports the continued nationwide cele-
bration of Juneteenth National Independence 
Day to provide an opportunity for the people 
of the United States to learn more about the 
past and to better understand the experi-
ences that have shaped the United States; 
and 
(4) recognizes that the observance of the 
end of slavery is part of the history and her-
itage of the United States.

SENATE RESOLUTION 680—DESIG-
NATING JUNE 2022 AS ‘‘NATIONAL 
CYBERSECURITY 
EDUCATION 
MONTH’’ 
Mr. CASSIDY (for himself and Ms. 
ROSEN) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was considered and agreed 
to: 
S. RES. 680 
Whereas 
recent 
cyberattacks 
and 
vulnerabilities present cybersecurity risks 
to individuals and organizations and increase 
the urgency to grow and sustain a knowl-
edgeable and skilled cybersecurity workforce 
in both the public and private sectors; 
Whereas, according to CyberSeek.org, as of 
June 2022, there are 714,548 open jobs in cy-
bersecurity in the United States and 1,091,576 
individuals in the cybersecurity workforce; 
Whereas a 2017 report entitled ‘‘Supporting 
the Growth and Sustainment of the Nation’s 
Cybersecurity Workforce: Building the Foun-
dation for a More Secure American Future’’, 
transmitted by the Secretary of Commerce 
and the Secretary of Homeland Security, 
proposed a vision to ‘‘prepare, grow, and sus-
tain a cybersecurity workforce that safe-
guards and promotes America’s national se-
curity and economic prosperity’’; 
Whereas 
expanding 
cybersecurity 
edu-
cation opportunities is important in order to 
address the cybersecurity workforce short-
age and prepare the United States for ongo-
ing and future national security threats; 
Whereas cybersecurity education can— 
(1) provide learning and career opportuni-
ties for students across the United States in 
kindergarten through grade 12; and 
(2) bolster the capacity of the domestic 
workforce to defend the United States and 
secure the economy of the United States;

SUBMARINE THE USS OKLAHOMA 
CITY AND THE CREWS OF THE 
USS 
OKLAHOMA 
CITY, 
WHO 
SERVED 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES 
WITH VALOR AND BRAVERY 
Mr. LANKFORD (for himself and Mr. 
INHOFE) submitted the following reso-
lution; 
which 
was 
considered 
and 
agreed to: 
S. RES. 681 
Whereas the USS Oklahoma City is a nu-
clear-powered fast attack submarine named 
after Oklahoma City, the capital and most 
populous city in Oklahoma, and is the second 
ship in the history of the Navy to bear that 
name; 
Whereas the motto of the USS Oklahoma 
City is ‘‘The Sooner, The Better’’, which is a 
testament to both the spirit of the people of 
Oklahoma City and the readiness of the 140- 
person crew of the USS Oklahoma City; 
Whereas the USS Oklahoma City was 
christened and launched on November 2, 1985, 
sponsored by Linda M. Nickles, and was com-
missioned for service on July 9, 1988, with 
Commander Kevin John Reardon as the first 
commanding officer of the submarine; 
Whereas, since the commissioning of the 
USS Oklahoma City, the USS Oklahoma 
City has traveled around the globe multiple 
times and has served in the Mediterranean, 
the Persian Gulf, the Pacific, and, most re-
cently, Apra Harbor, Guam; 
Whereas, in the aftermath of the April 19, 
1995, bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Fed-
eral Building in Oklahoma City, the crew of 
the USS Oklahoma City donated blood in 
support of the victims of the deadliest act of 
homegrown terrorism in the history of the 
United States, which resulted in the deaths 
of 168 individuals; 
Whereas the USS Oklahoma City was the 
first Navy submarine to transition from 
navigation using paper charts to an all-elec-
tronic navigation suite; 
Whereas, on Friday, May 20, 2022, the inac-
tivation ceremony for the USS Oklahoma 
City was held in Puget Sound Naval Ship-
yard to honor nearly 34 years of service; and 
Whereas, throughout the career of the USS 
Oklahoma City, the USS Oklahoma City sup-
ported a range of missions, including anti- 
surface warfare, anti-submarine warfare, tar-
geted strike missions, and intelligence, sur-
veillance, and reconnaissance missions: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate recognizes the 
service of the Los Angeles-class attack sub-
marine the USS Oklahoma City and the crew 
of the USS Oklahoma City, who served the 
United States with valor and bravery.

f 
HONORING OUR PACT ACT OF 2021 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I am 
going to talk a little bit about the bill 
that we have been debating here all 
week on the Senate floor, the Sergeant 
First Class Heath Robinson Honoring 
our PACT Act of 2022. 
Now, it is a very important bill. It is 
named after Sergeant First Class Rob-
inson, an Ohio National Guard soldier 
who died in 2022 as a result of service- 
connected toxic exposure. 
This bill that we are going to be vot-
ing for final passage on tomorrow 
would deliver immediate access to 
healthcare for toxic-exposed veterans, 
direct the VA to evaluate diseases for 
presumption of service connection, and 
streamline the process for toxic-ex-
posed veterans seeking disability com-
pensation for their illness that they 
gained while serving overseas defend-
ing our Nation. 
I have supported the intent of this 
bill for years, and I intend to vote in 
favor of this bill tomorrow when it 
comes up for final passage. 
There is nothing, in my mind, that is 
more important than taking care of 
our veterans, but I do want to raise 
some concerns about how we got to 
this point, the process of this bill, 
which, in my view, undermined the 
likelihood of this massive new program 
being implemented in a way that bene-
fits all American veterans so we can 
take care of all American veterans. 
Let me explain. Since my time here 
in the Senate, I have focused on these 
issues. I serve on the Veterans’ Affairs 
Committee that was responsible, in 
large measure, for many aspects of this 
bill. I serve on the Armed Services 
Committee. I still serve in the military 
myself, in the Marine Corps Reserves, 
and I am honored to represent the 
State in our great Nation, Alaska, that 
has more veterans per capita than any 
State in the country. 
So veterans and military affairs and 
their families have been a core focus of 
mine since I arrived in the Senate in 
2015. And in particular, I have been fo-
cused on this issue of toxic exposure of 
our service men and women during 
wartime. In fact, one of my commit-
ments as a candidate for the U.S. Sen-
ate in 2014 was to work to ensure pas-
sage of the Blue Water Navy Vietnam 
Veterans Act, which I cosponsored 
when I got here and was signed into 
law in 2019. 
That was an outstanding commit-
ment to our Vietnam veterans exposed 
to Agent Orange during their time, but 
it was belatedly fulfilled—years, even 
decades, after their service in Vietnam. 
And I took lessons from that. As a 
matter of fact, I think many Senators 
took lessons from that, that when the 
next generation of veterans served 
overseas and were exposed to toxins 
during their service, that we needed to 
act.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2977 
June 15, 2022 
So that is what I have done in my ca-
reer here. I have worked, taking the 
Vietnam veteran experience, particu-
larly with Agent Orange, to make sure 
we don’t repeat that—the mistakes of 
Agent Orange where those exposed to 
toxic substances overseas during their 
service and later came down with dis-
eases and suffered, that we needed to 
take care of them. 
We know that toxic exposure during 
military service can add serious com-
plications to a veteran’s health, years 
and even decades after their service has 
concluded. 
And there is science that can cor-
relate certain diseases and symptoms 
to exposure. That is the model that we 
want. Veterans suffering from poten-
tial exposure understand too well that 
getting the VA to even recognize and 
concede exposure can remain a chal-
lenging bureaucratic and incredibly 
frustrating process that leads to deni-
als often from the bureaucracy. 
So early in my time here, I have been 
a relentless advocate on these issues. I 
will give you a few examples. 
I introduced with Senator MANCHIN 
of West Virginia the Veterans Burn 
Pits Exposure Recognition Act, which 
was previously passed out of com-
mittee in the Veterans’ Affairs Com-
mittee and enjoys broad bipartisan 
support. Close to half of the Senate— 
Democrats and Republicans—was co-
sponsors of our bill, and almost all of 
the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Com-
mittee were. 
This bill would recognize and concede 
exposure to toxic substances for those 
veterans who were deployed in areas 
where burn pits were in use: in Iraq, in 
Afghanistan, 
in 
Uzbekistan—all 
of 
these different areas and more. 
This bill would do away with the pa-
perwork that made it almost impos-
sible to prove exposure by these vet-
erans. It put the onus on the VA and 
that bureaucracy. 
When crafting this bill with Senator 
MANCHIN, our offices worked exten-
sively with the Senate Veterans’ Af-
fairs Committee and many of the vet-
erans service organizations, particu-
larly the Disabled American Veterans 
organization; and we worked with the 
VA on the language to make sure we 
were not getting ahead of the science, 
making sure that what was exposed 
and what were the diseases connect 
with science—not always easy, but the 
VA does have expertise in that area. 
I then cosponsored with Senator 
BLUMENTHAL the K2 Veterans Advocacy 
Act. This bill moved the needle on 
three things that are known systemati-
cally now: that toxic substances at the 
base that we call K2 in Uzbekistan, the 
medical conditions that K2 veterans 
have—and they are serious; something 
really bad was going on at the K2 base 
in Uzbekistan—and the links between 
the two. 
Now, we worked with the Trump 
White House before President Trump 
left office in 2020, before our bill passed 
here on the Senate floor, to get them 
to issue an Executive order for the VA 
to essentially do those things for K2 
veterans. 
I introduced and had passed the bi-
partisan Burn Pits Accountability Act 
with Senator KLOBUCHAR, which directs 
the Pentagon to include empirical 
health assessments and evaluation of 
whether a servicemember has been ex-
posed to open burn pits or toxic air-
borne chemicals in their deployments. 
This bill was included in the fiscal year 
2020 National Defense Authorization 
Act. 
And I sponsored the Pandemic Care 
For Burn Pits Exposure Act of 2020 to 
ensure that servicemembers and vet-
erans with previous exposure to burn 
pits received the care they needed dur-
ing the COVID–19 pandemic. 
I am listing these bills and the work 
and time and the bipartisan nature of 
them because on the Veterans Affairs’ 
Committee there has been no issue I 
have been more focused on. 
We are going to take the lessons from 
Vietnam, Agent Orange, and not say: 
You are going to wait three or four or 
five decades while you die of cancer. 
And I am committed to this issue, 
and I have been. But I am also com-
mitted to passing legislation that is 
worthy of all veterans that we are serv-
ing. So I have had some reservations 
about the current bill and the process 
by which it has come to the Senate 
floor, because the process has thwarted 
opportunities to make this a better 
bill, to make it serve our veterans in a 
better, holistic way. 
And, again, this is an issue I have 
been focused on since my first days in 
the U.S. Senate. 
So what are the issues? 
Well, as I mentioned, some of the 
things in there—a lot of the things in 
this bill are very necessary. The bill 
that I just mentioned that I cospon-
sored with Senator MANCHIN, the Vet-
erans Burn Pits Exposure Recognition 
Act, was incorporated into the PACT 
Act that we will be voting on tomor-
row, the Sergeant Robinson Honoring 
our PACT Act. 
In fact, many bipartisan bills from 
the Veterans’ Affairs Committee were 
included in this bill that we are going 
to be voting on tomorrow. 
But ultimately, what we had going 
on in the Veterans’ Affairs Committee 
was 
an 
agreement 
that 
when 
we 
brought this big bill—and it is big—to 
the Senate floor, we would have the 
ability to bring amendments to try to 
improve it, to try to make it better for 
all veterans in the entire VA system, a 
system that we know has challenges 
implementing sweeping mandates from 
Congress. 
This is a sweeping mandate from 
Congress that we are voting on. As I 
mentioned, the issue of toxic exposure, 
which I have been focused on since my 
first year here in the U.S. Senate, has 
always been a bipartisan bill. Four 
bills I just mentioned that I have led 
on have all had Democratic cosponsors 
leading with me as well. But what hap-
pened this week and last week was the 
bipartisan nature of trying to tackle 
one of the biggest issues facing our vet-
erans was shut down. For whatever rea-
son, and I don’t know why—somebody 
should ask the majority leader—all the 
amendments that we were going to 
bring to the floor to make this bill bet-
ter were shut down. We have not had 
one amendment on this comprehensive 
bill, and, like I said, a number of us 
have been focused on this issue for 
years. 
What were we trying to do with these 
amendments? We are trying to make 
this a better bill. Bring your ideas to 
the floor, debate them, vote on them. 
Why wouldn’t we want to do that? Why 
wouldn’t we want to do that? Don’t we 
owe it to all of our veterans to do that? 
My primary concern, as I have men-
tioned, is making sure that not just 
the constituency impacted by this leg-
islation, which we need—those exposed 
to toxic exposure primarily from burn 
pits are taken care of—but that the 
whole VA system remains robust and 
strong. And I think some of the amend-
ments—I know some of the amend-
ments that we were going to bring—as 
a matter of fact, on the Veterans’ Af-
fairs Committee there was a commit-
ment to make sure we were bringing 
these amendments to the floor—would 
have made this bill better. 
What are the biggest concerns? Well, 
I pressed the Secretary of the VA just 
yesterday in his testimony before the 
Veterans’ Affairs Committee on one of 
the biggest concerns I have and one of 
the biggest concerns many Senators 
have and one of the biggest concerns 
our Veterans’ Affairs Committee has, 
and it is this: This bill that I will be 
supporting tomorrow is estimated to 
bring an additional 2.5 million claims 
to the VA—2.5 million. 
My question to the Secretary was 
simple but really important: Mr. Sec-
retary, is the VA system ready to ab-
sorb the roughly 21⁄2 million additional 
claims that are likely to be generated 
in the next 3 years by the PACT Act? 
Are you ready? 
We have some ideas and amendments 
that we think can make it ready. But 
again, for whatever reason, the major-
ity leader didn’t want to hear about 
those. 
In an already stretched VA, with a 
huge backlog already and challenges as 
we speak, the Secretary testified about 
them yesterday, about hiring qualified 
medical personnel across the country 
but especially in my State, in Alaska. 
The concern that I raised with the Sec-
retary yesterday, the concern that we 
are trying to address with the amend-
ment process here on the Senate floor 
is this: When you bring that many into 
a system that is not ready, you can 
collapse the whole system. You can 
collapse the whole system. 
And then every veteran loses. A 
young marine with his legs amputated 
after an IED explosion in Afghanistan 
who needs help, he is going to be de-
layed. A Vietnam veteran who needs

care, he is going to be delayed. A Gulf 
war veteran, she is going to be delayed. 
If you are collapsing the whole system, 
every veteran loses. Every veteran 
loses. 
Now, I have actually seen this in my 
State. And I know the Presiding Offi-
cer’s State has had some challenges 
with the VA. Several years ago, I held 
a field hearing in Arizona on some of 
the challenges in the VA, but I have 
seen the system collapse in Alaska. In 
2015, my first year in the U.S. Senate, 
due to legislation that had been passed 
the year before, we essentially had the 
system in Alaska collapse. Somehow, 
some way, legislation and ideas from 
the VA thought it was really smart to 
remove the ability to actually make 
appointments for veterans in Alaska 
not by officials from the VA who live 
in Alaska but somewhere in the lower 
48—I think it was Louisiana or some-
where—not a good idea. The whole sys-
tem cratered. I have seen it. And no 
veteran benefits. No one benefits. 
In my first year here in 2015, it was 
my No. 1 priority to get the VA to fix 
the broken system in Alaska, and we 
have made huge progress. But I have 
seen it firsthand. When a system that 
is supposed to take care of veterans 
craters, of course, every veteran suf-
fers. 
So we don’t want that to happen with 
the implementation of this important 
bill. And the Secretary of the VA as-
sured me, assured Senator TILLIS in 
questioning yesterday, that this won’t 
happen, that the system won’t be over-
burdened, that they are prepared for 
this. 
Well, I hope he is right. I have my 
doubts, but I hope he is right. 
But here is the point: A bipartisan 
amendment process, particularly from 
Senators—I will give you one example. 
Senator MORAN, ranking member on 
Veterans’ Affairs, has been working 
this issue like me for years. Particu-
larly from Senators who actually know 
the issue, a bipartisan amendment 
process would have helped ensure that 
this possibility would be much less. 
I will give you a couple of examples 
of what, for whatever reason, the ma-
jority leader didn’t want to bring up on 
this important legislation. We had 
amendments to make sure that the VA 
didn’t get ahead of the science. You 
need to connect the science and expo-
sure to the disease. That is simple. 
That is what is expected—it is not sim-
ple. It is a complicated process, but it 
is just the rigor of a bill that you want 
to make sure that those who are ex-
posed and sick and with a disease are 
the ones who get the care. 
Right now, in this bill, there are 23 
respiratory illnesses and cancers that 
will be added to the list of presumptive 
ailments that will allow a veteran to 
be diagnosed with toxic exposure and 
qualify for benefits and any other dis-
ease the Secretary of the VA deter-
mines is warranted based on a positive 
association with certain substances, 
chemicals, or airborne hazards. Some 
of those 23 presumptives, as we are 
calling them, are based on science. 
Some aren’t. I have asked the VA; I 
have asked the Secretary: Hey, where 
did we get these 23? The answer, I am 
still waiting for. 
That is what the amendment process 
is for, to make sure this bill has rigor 
to take care of all veterans. 
Let me mention another amendment 
offered by Senator MORAN, an amend-
ment that he was promised to get a 
floor vote on that didn’t happen and I 
think would have made the bill strong-
er. It would have preserved the Trump- 
era gains on community care access 
standards and, importantly, serve as a 
relief valve for veterans to receive care 
as millions are going to be added into 
the system. So, again, if you have 21⁄2 
million additional claims and the VA is 
overwhelmed and now there is a giant 
backlog for everybody, this amend-
ment would have said: Well, the vet-
erans in the system can go out and get 
community care. That is a good idea. It 
is actually how it works in Alaska be-
cause we don’t have a full-service VA 
hospital, one of only three States in 
the country. But that is a really smart 
idea, a safety valve. If the system looks 
like it is going to crater because it is 
overwhelmed, hey, let some doctors in 
town help the veterans. We couldn’t 
bring that amendment up. 
So I pressed the VA Secretary on this 
because I have seen it when a system 
collapses, and my veterans were really 
hurt in Alaska when it did—the VA 
system in my State. And I am going to 
take his word for it now that the VA 
can handle 21⁄2 million more claims in 
the next 3 years. But I am going to be 
watching like a hawk—watching like a 
hawk in my oversight role. Like I said, 
there is nothing I care more about than 
our veterans, our military, and their 
family members. We had the oppor-
tunity on an important bill that I will 
be supporting to make it better. And 
we sat in the Senate all week and 
didn’t bring up one amendment to even 
try. 
The Secretary is assuring us. OK. All 
good. Good to go. Well, some of us had 
ideas to make sure it would have been 
better to go. We couldn’t bring them 
up. 
I hope there aren’t problems with 
this implementation. If the system is 
in danger of collapsing as a result of 
this bill, I hope that whoever is major-
ity leader at that time—2, 3, 4 years 
from now—understands that the care 
for all veterans is what the VA is all 
about, and I hope if we need it, we will 
have the opportunity to bring good 
ideas to the Senate floor to fix these 
kind of things because veterans are not 
a partisan issue in the Senate. They 
are not. I have seen it my whole career 
here. I sit on the committee. I sit on 
the Armed Services Committee. But 
for whatever reason, our ability, in a 
bipartisan way, to try to improve this 
bill that we are going to vote on to-
morrow was not granted to other Sen-
ators. And I think that was a missed 
opportunity because I think we would 
have made this a better bill. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
KELLY). The Senator from Oklahoma. 
f 
INFLATION 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I 
want to give today’s reality check. The 
Federal Reserve today raised interest 
rates 75 basis points—three-quarters of 
a point—with a statement they may 
come back and do that again in an-
other month. 
A point and a half in 2 months is a 
pretty dramatic effect. It is going to be 
a situation where many people, 40 and 
younger, are about to face interest 
rates they have never faced in their 
lifetime. The cost of buying a car that 
is already high is about to get higher. 
The cost of buying a home that is al-
ready really high is about to get much 
higher. 
Inflation is now at 8.6 percent. A lot 
of people are beginning to feel what 
that really means. This is not some 
strange anomaly. This is inflation over 
the last decade. It has bounced around 
about the same level, basically, for a 
decade until right there—March of 
2021—and then it just skyrockets at 
that point. 
This is the reality that we are facing 
at this point. What does inflation real-
ly look like when you say it is 8.6 per-
cent? Well, people know what that feels 
like. The cost of eggs has gone up 32 
percent in the past year—32 percent for 
eggs. The cost of milk is up 16 percent; 
the cost of butter, also 16 percent; the 
cost of coffee, 15 percent; the cost of 
baby formula, if you can find it, is up 
13 percent. 
And 
gas 
prices? 
Oh, 
hello. 
Gas 
prices—that really has had an effect. 
This is gas prices since January of 2017. 
Again, we look, and it stays about the 
same until January of 2021. I wonder 
what happened then. 
And then look at this. 
Then, with the conversation about 
gas prices that, per the administration 
lately, has been about, ‘‘Well, it is all 
Putin’s fault,’’ well, here are the rising 
gas prices since President Biden’s inau-
guration—right there—and right there 
is the war that began in Russia. So this 
little increase right here is the part 
that is actually there. 
This is our consumer price inflation. 
This is on gas prices. It is the same 
thing. To be able to see this flat line on 
gas prices, that spike—that is the inva-
sion 
of 
Ukraine 
happening 
right 
there—and to be able to see what has 
been added onto it since then. So this 
is not just about the invasion in 
Ukraine. This has been ongoing since 
late January 2021. 
The challenge now is, Is this some-
thing intentional or is this something 
accidental? Quite frankly, I think it is 
a bit of both. 
We all remember very well this mo-
ment during the Presidential cam-
paign. It was when President Biden was

campaigning, and he walked over to a 
young lady on the campaign stop and 
said: 
[L]ook in my eyes. I guarantee you . . . we 
are going to end fossil fuel. 
I guarantee you. 
That was this moment that happened 
here. 
This was not something totally acci-
dental. It was a drive to say, We have 
got to shift to solar; we have got to 
shift to wind; we have got to shift to 
hydro; we have got to shift to other 
things; we are going to get rid of fossil 
fuels; and we are going to accelerate 
that as fast as possible. 
I have to tell you that I live in a 
State in which we use a lot of wind 
power. We use a lot of solar power. We 
use hydropower. We have a very diverse 
energy portfolio. But right now, the 
people in my State are paying much 
higher prices for gasoline, much higher 
prices for natural gas, and much higher 
prices for electricity because the poli-
cies that have been put in place are 
driving up the costs, and people feel it. 
This is what it looks like at this 
point. This is the last 24 months of re-
tail average prices—right there, Janu-
ary 2021—and then to be able to see 
what is happening with prices all over 
the country. 
Now, the administration’s response, 
just in the past couple of weeks, has 
been this statement. 
President Biden has said: 
My administration will continue to do ev-
erything it can to lower prices for the Amer-
ican people. 
I love the words ‘‘continue to do’’ in 
there. They are going to continue to do 
everything that they can. They are 
going to keep doing these things that 
clearly have driven up prices over-
whelmingly for the American people. 
It was, let’s say, Putin’s fault. It has 
been the oil companies’ fault. It has 
been the refineries’ fault. That is the 
new one that he actually just put out 
in the last 24 hours—that it is all the 
fault of the refineries that are just tak-
ing in too much profit. 
The challenge has been an ongoing 
attack on American energy from the 
very beginning. Literally, on day 1, 
when President Biden canceled the 
Keystone Pipeline, he started his proc-
ess of fulfilling his promise that he 
made during the campaign: ‘‘I guar-
antee you I am going to end fossil 
fuels.’’ So day 1 was canceling the Key-
stone Pipeline and getting crude oil 
from Canada—about 800,000 barrels a 
day. What he didn’t announce on this 
day is that we still have to have that 
same 800,000 barrels a day from some-
where because it is heavy crude. We 
purchase some of our heavy crude from 
other places, so we still have to get it. 
His announcement, though, on day 1 
was, We are not going to get it from 
Canada. 
What people don’t realize is that this 
announcement on day 1 was, We are 
not going to get it from Canada. We are 
going to get it from Russia. 
How did that foreign policy work 
out? Terribly. 
On day 1: We are not going to get oil 
from Canada. We are going to get it 
from Russia. We are going to get it 
from other places instead. 
He put a moratorium on new Federal 
oil and gas leasing. That moratorium, 
by the way, still stays in place in mul-
tiple areas, and 24 percent of our oil 
and gas in the United States comes 
from Federal lands and waters—24 per-
cent. So what this did was say, for the 
future of how we are going to develop, 
we are not going to develop in those 
areas anymore. I am going to cut off 24 
percent of the supply coming in. Again, 
this goes back to his campaign promise 
of ‘‘I guarantee you I am going to end 
fossil fuel.’’ 
He declined to defend the gulf lease 
sale 257. That is offshore. Basically, an 
environmental group went in and sued 
and said: We don’t think they followed 
the process. 
The administration was, like, We are 
not going to challenge that. We are 
going to let the environmental group 
just take this whole thing down, and 
we are not going to increase our supply 
of oil coming from the gulf. 
He limited the seismic studies nec-
essary for new production in the gulf. 
What does that matter? 
Well, he has opened up some areas 
and said: You can drill for more oil in 
these areas. Oh, but, by the way, you 
are allowed to do that, but if you want 
to do seismic testing before you do it— 
which is a standard that you have to do 
seismic testing—oh, we are not doing 
any more seismic testing this whole 
year. We are not going to allow you to 
actually prepare a site. We are just 
going to tell you that you can do it. 
That is this mode that the adminis-
tration is in: Produce more oil, but I 
am not going to actually allow you to 
do that with the permitting. 
He has failed to implement a 5-year 
offshore leasing program. 
What difference does that make? 
By law—by law, now—the adminis-
tration is required to be able to put a 
5-year offshore leasing proposal in 
place. The current one expires on June 
30 of this year. That is days away. 
There is no present plan in place to be 
able to replace it. 
In fact, I personally asked Secretary 
Haaland, the Secretary of the Interior, 
and she said: ‘‘We plan by June 30—the 
deadline to have a new one in place—to 
be able to put out a comment of what 
we could do if we do a new plan.’’ 
I said: ‘‘When will that be complete?’’ 
Her response to me was, ‘‘We don’t 
have a deadline as to when that will be 
complete.’’ 
So, what is required by law to have a 
plan for how we are going to do off-
shore leasing, they are going to, in-
stead, by the day it should be in place, 
begin discussing when they might do it 
in the days ahead. 
Again, it goes back to: We are going 
to talk about it, but we are actually 
not going to put this lease sale plan in 
place. 
He canceled a lease sale in Alaska’s 
Cook Inlet, which is where oil comes 
from. He closed off half of the National 
Petroleum Reserve in Alaska to any fu-
ture energy development. 
He pushed regulations that would 
slow or halt a buildout of natural gas 
pipelines and liquefied natural gas ex-
port infrastructure. This is a FERC 
piece. They actually put a new leader 
in place in that spot, and then the first 
action they took was to make putting 
pipelines that were heading to the gulf 
to be able to sell natural gas to Europe 
harder to do and more expensive to do. 
If we wanted to put natural gas pipe-
lines across our country, he would also 
make it more expensive and more com-
plicated. So, literally, as the price is 
going up for natural gas, he has made 
it even more expensive to be able to 
transport natural gas and harder to be 
able to sell it to our allies. 
He proposed new financial regula-
tions designed to drive investment for 
traditional energy projects. This body 
will remember nominees who were put 
up by the Biden administration to go 
to the Federal Reserve who stated out 
loud that their goal of going to the 
Federal Reserve was to cut off access 
to capital for any kind of energy devel-
opment that was a fossil fuel. They are 
literally saying: You can’t get loans 
and money to get access to that. 
So they will make it harder to actu-
ally move it when you get it, if you can 
get it at all on Federal lands; and they 
will make it harder to be able to get 
access to capital. 
He has also proposed raising taxes on 
oil and gas development. Do you re-
member my comment—or his com-
ment, actually—saying he is going to 
continue to do everything he can to 
lower the prices of energy for the 
American people? Well, what he has ac-
tually done is he has proposed a whole 
new set of taxes on all energy compa-
nies. In fact, even recently, there was a 
conversation about a windfall profits 
tax on energy companies. 
Now, here is the basic economics that 
this group knows well: If you tax it 
more, you get less of it. If you get less 
of it, the price goes up. This is not 
hard. This is basic economics. Yet this 
administration has proposed multiple 
new taxes in their budget that they 
just put out in the previous month. At 
the same time, he said: I am going to 
continue to do what I can to lower 
prices, at the same time he put out 
proposals to dramatically increase oil 
and gas costs. 
Nominate anti-traditional energy ac-
tivists for key posts. We have seen 
that. He has turned to hostile nations 
like Iran and Venezuela to meet the 
U.S. energy demand instead of turning 
to U.S. producers. 
It has been interesting. I have heard 
several people say: Well, we have got 
high numbers of production of oil and 
gas here in the United States. But the 
fact is, we are still a half a million bar-
rels less now of production than what 
we were prepandemic. We have not 
caught up on actual production here; 
and the Biden administration has made 
it even harder to go get it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2980 
June 15, 2022 
While the Biden administration is 
planning a trip to Saudi Arabia to talk 
to them about getting more oil, our 
friends in Canada are saying: Why 
don’t you come to Canada and talk to 
us about production? We can increase 
supply to the United States. 
American producers are saying: We 
can increase supply to the United 
States if you will lift regulations, 
allow us to get permits, stop making it 
harder to move it, stop making it more 
expensive to get it, and stop adding 
more taxes onto us. We can produce 
more in the United States. 
Listen, the price of oil right now is 
about $117 a barrel. There is plenty of 
incentive to go get it, but the adminis-
tration continues to make it harder 
and harder and harder and more and 
more unpredictable to actually go get 
it, so folks are not going to get more. 
While the Biden administration blames 
speculators on Wall Street and rich oil 
companies and everyone else, the basic 
facts are that the administration’s 
policies are what are driving this prob-
lem. 
Are there solutions to this? Of 
course, there are. There are ways to be 
able to resolve this. We can restart 
Federal leasing onshore and offshore. I 
am not talking about having massive 
rigs everywhere. We do oil drilling and 
gas drilling better than anyone else in 
the world. 
While the administration is going 
over to Saudi Arabia to go get oil to be 
able to use in the United States, don’t 
we think that we produce it cleaner 
than Saudi Arabia does? What in the 
world? 
If we are going to need to use it, then 
why aren’t we producing it here in the 
United States? If this is all about a 
global climate challenge, then why 
aren’t we focused on production here 
rather than running overseas and try-
ing to be able to get it there? 
Restart the permitting process. Re-
start the leasing onshore and offshore. 
Stop all of the regulations that are de-
signed to limit and to punish oil and 
gas 
production—the 
administration 
just did a moratorium on this; it would 
make a significant difference—actually 
put in timelines for permitting and 
litigation. 
Again, I have mentioned Canada sev-
eral times, but if there is a mine that 
is going in in Canada for things like 
lithium and other things that we need 
and the whole world needs—they have 
deadlines and timelines to be able to do 
that—it takes about 5 years to be able 
to do a mine in those areas. It takes 15 
years to be able to do that in the 
United States, if you can get it done at 
all, because there are no timelines and 
deadlines. 
It is the same thing with the produc-
tion of oil and gas. When there is this 
constant litigation challenge all of the 
time, it makes it more difficult to go 
get it. 
People need to be engaged in the 
process. The community needs to be 
heard—Tribes, local governments. Peo-
ple need to be heard and consulted in 
the process. But with no deadlines out 
there, there is no incentive to be able 
to actually go after it. 
Promote projects that enhance mu-
tual security like the Keystone Pipe-
line and like other pipelines. We 
learned, when there was a security 
problem on the Colonial Pipeline— 
coming out last year to North Caro-
lina—and 
North 
Carolina 
suddenly 
didn’t have refined products, gasoline, 
the whole east coast discovered: We are 
dependent on one pipeline—one. 
If that one pipeline actually has a 
structural failure, what happens to the 
east coast? Listen, you can multiply 
that all over the country. 
While 
this 
administration 
fights 
every pipeline company that is trying 
to put in a pipeline, they increase our 
risk of having a major problem and 
large sections of the country losing ac-
cess to energy. They are gambling with 
our future at this point, while we are 
watching prices exceed $5 a gallon. 
Focus on the solutions that don’t raise 
taxes on energy or limit U.S. energy 
production. 
I did have to laugh last week when 
the President made a speech and said 
he was working on bringing down the 
cost of energy. So the announcement 
was, I am going to bring down the cost 
of energy by dropping tariffs on solar 
panels coming from the Far East. 
Talk about out of touch. That is out 
of touch. That is out of touch. Because, 
if we are going to produce solar panels, 
then why aren’t we incentivizing the 
production of solar panels here in 
America rather than encouraging the 
production of solar panels overseas in 
the Far East? How in the world is drop-
ping tariffs on solar panels from the 
Far East going to help folks filling up 
their tank with gas next week? 
The President said he was going to 
solve energy issues and the price at the 
pump by increasing the amount of eth-
anol that we would use. Remember 
that one? That was about 5 months 
ago. He said that we would just have 
more ethanol. He went to Iowa and 
made a big announcement: We will just 
do more ethanol. And the prices con-
tinue to be able to skyrocket and rise. 
The President then came on and said: 
All right, we still have a higher and 
higher and higher price. So the ethanol 
whole thing didn’t work when he put 
that out here, and so he came back and 
said: We are going to do this Strategic 
Petroleum Reserve. We are going to re-
lease a million barrels a day from this 
Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Remem-
ber 
that 
announcement? 
That 
an-
nouncement was made right about 
there on this chart. That is when that 
announcement was made. 
How is it going for gas prices since 
his announcement that we are going to 
release a million barrels a day from 
this Strategic Petroleum Reserve? It 
still continues to be able to rise. 
These prices aren’t based on short- 
term input from the Strategic Petro-
leum Reserve. They are based on long- 
term supply. That is basic economics. 
Now the talk has been a temporary 
gas tax holiday: We will do a tem-
porary gas tax holiday, and that is 
going to give people relief. 
Can I remind everyone that we are 
over $5 a gallon? The temporary gas 
tax holiday would drop the price 18 
cents. Eighteen cents is what it would 
drop the price. We are not trying to get 
an 18-cent drop. We are trying to get it 
back to where it was over here, or how 
about over here, where we were at $2 a 
gallon, not 18 cents. Besides the fact, if 
you drop the price by 18 cents just for 
this year, it puts a $20 billion hole in 
our infrastructure—in our building for 
bridges and highways and roads—to get 
an 18-cent bump. 
There has also been the proposal out 
there that he is going to take over re-
fineries. That was today. Again, it 
seems like every week there is a new 
thing that they throw out. Now it is a 
letter that he sent to the major refin-
eries. In the letter that the President 
sent to the major refineries, he wrote: 
[M]y administration is prepared to use all 
reasonable and appropriate Federal Govern-
ment tools and emergency authorities to in-
crease refinery capacity and output in the 
near term . . . to ensure that every region of 
this country is appropriately supplied. 
Great. So the President is going to go 
into the refineries, and he is going to 
take them over. The same administra-
tion that is managing our baby for-
mula is now going to manage our refin-
eries. That is going to work out ter-
rific. 
Our refineries right now are running 
at 95-percent capacity—95 percent. The 
interesting thing about our refineries 
is that America has not built a new re-
finery since 1977. And just in the past 3 
years, we have lost almost a million 
barrels a day of refining capacity in 
the United States from refineries shut-
ting down. 
Maybe the better question the Presi-
dent could ask is ‘‘How do we start in-
creasing our ability to refine,’’ not how 
is he going to take over refineries and 
run it himself. 
We have a major structural problem 
right now. This is just evidence of what 
is going on across the whole economy. 
There are answers. There are solu-
tions. But they are not raising taxes, 
and taking over refineries, and putting 
oil out from the Strategic Petroleum 
Reserve, or running to Saudi Arabia. 
That is not going to solve our energy 
problems. 
And I can assure us, we are not going 
to solve our 8.6-inflation rate until we 
solve the price of energy, because the 
price of energy is baked into every sin-
gle product that we buy—everything. 
And if this doesn’t get solved, this 
doesn’t get better. 
Mr. President, do what needs to be 
done to increase supply in America so 
that the price will go down. We all be-
lieve—we all believe—that, in the dec-
ades ahead, we are going to have more 
electric vehicles; we will have more re-
newable energy. We all believe that. 
But 98 percent of the vehicles on the

CELEBRATING THE BICENTENNIAL 
ANNIVERSARY OF THE TOWN OF 
HOOKSETT, NEW HAMPSHIRE 
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 15, 2022 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the bicentennial anniversary of 
the establishment of the Town of Hooksett, 
New Hampshire. First known as ‘‘Chester 
Woods’’ and ‘‘Rowe’s Corner’’ upon its found-
ing in 1822, the name was later changed to 
Hooksett. This town’s long and rich history has 
culminated in the vibrant and caring commu-
nity we see today. 
With a population of just 880, the earliest 
residents of Hooksett lived in the Martin’s 
Ferry Settlement near what is now Southern 
New Hampshire University. From the beautiful 
Head’s Pond Trail to the iconic Robie’s Coun-
try Store, the Town of Hooksett encapsulates 
the best of New Hampshire. 
In 2005, Hooksett was honored as a Pre-
serve America Community, the first community 
in New Hampshire to receive this prestigious 
recognition. Hooksett has been at the forefront 
of the White House’s initiative to preserve 
America’s cultural and natural heritage. If the 
past two centuries are any indication of the fu-
ture, the Town of Hooksett will remain a won-
derful and important part of New Hampshire 
for generations to come. 
On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-
shire’s First Congressional District, I want to 
congratulate the Town of Hooksett on this in-
credible milestone. I look forward to a contin-
ued partnership with Hooksett and its resi-
dents who I am proud to represent in Con-
gress.

HOMETOWN HERO—OFFICER TONY 
ANDUJAR 
HON. BETH VAN DUYNE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 15, 2022 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Officer Tony Andujar, who has 
gone above and beyond to keep our commu-
nity safe and honor his fallen brothers. 
Tony not only serves North Texas every day 
with the Dallas Police Department, but he re-
cently honored other Dallas Police officers 
who have paid the ultimate sacrifice by partici-
pating in Carry the Load. Carry the Load 
works to bring all Americans together to par-
ticipate in honoring our nation’s heroes every 
day. This great mission also raises funds for 
non-profits for veterans’ services and inspires 
patriotism in America’s youth. 
Last month, Tony joined the Carry the Load 
West Coast Route—from Seattle to Dallas—by 
walking for 8 days in remembrance of his fel-
low Dallas Police officers who are no longer 
with us. 
Tony embodies the essence of a true public 
servant. He puts others in front of himself and 
will stand up to any challenge. Walking for 8 
days with a 20-pound pack is a daunting task 
to many, but for Tony, it was the least he 
could do in remembrance of his fallen broth-
ers. 
As Tony put it, ‘‘the weight of my ruck may 
not physically be heavy, but the weight of their 
loss is immeasurable.’’ 
I thank Tony for his acts of service and in-
spiration to our community in North Texas.

RECOGNITION 
OF 
MICHAEL 
TATHAM CMG, BRITISH EMBAS-
SY’S SERVICE 
HON. RON KIND 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 15, 2022 
Mr. KIND. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the invaluable service of Michael 
Tatham CMG, who has served as the Deputy 
Head of Mission at the British Embassy in 
Washington, D.C., for the past five years. 
Throughout his time in D.C., Michael has per-
sonified the special relationship between the 
United States and the United Kingdom with his 
tireless work, diligent commitment, and affable 
personality. 
As one of our key liaisons to the United 
Kingdom, Michael has facilitated meetings with 
Congressional members and all levels of the 
British Government, from Prime Ministers to 
Cabinet Ministers, Members of Parliament, 
and members of the Royal Family. During his 
tenure, Michael also guided the Embassy as 
Charge´ D’Affaires, ensuring we in the United 
States remain well connected with our allies 
across the Atlantic. From cooperation in de-
fense, trade, technology, development, and 
foreign affairs to name a few, Michael has re-
mained steadfast in his ability to ensure the 
highest levels of diplomatic channels between 
our two nations remain open and well used. 
Michael will be transitioning back to the For-
eign, Commonwealth and Development Office 
in London where I have no doubt he will expe-
rience the same levels of success. The special 
relationship between the United States and 
the United Kingdom remains special, thanks to 
the work of diplomats like Michael Tatham. 
We in Congress will miss his work at the Em-
bassy and wish him nothing but the best for 
his future endeavors.

RECOGNIZING MR. DON DEVINE 
HON. DAVID G. VALADAO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 15, 2022 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today with Representative JIM COSTA to honor 
the life of Central Valley agriculture leader 
Don Devine, who passed away on June 4, 
2022. 
Born in Central City, Kentucky, Mr. Devine 
personified the American dream. As a young 
man, he joined the United States Army and 
spent six years serving in Vietnam. Following 
his tour of duty, he attended Arizona State 
University and graduated with a degree in ac-
counting. 
After graduating from school and obtaining 
his CPA license, Mr. Devine joined Harris 
Ranch Feeding Company, an organization he 
would spend over forty years working for, 
eventually working his way up to Senior Vice 
President of Finance. In the 1980s, Mr. Devine 
invested in farmland within the Central Valley 
and co-founded Double D Farms, an institution 
in our agricultural community, which grew and 
evolved to grow Pistachios, Almonds, and 
many other food crops. 
In addition to his hard work and success in 
business, Mr. Devine was also heavily in-
volved in community issues. He was a leader 
on water issues throughout the Central Valley 
and served on multiple water board districts 
such as the Westlands and Pleasant Valley 
Water Districts. 
Mr. Devine was an icon in the Central Val-
ley business and agricultural community. His 
dedication to his country, community, and fam-
ily is an inspiration to us all. 
We ask our colleagues in the House of Rep-
resentatives to join us in honoring the extraor-
dinary life of Mr. Don Devine.

RECOGNIZING THE 25TH 
ANNIVERSARY OF TECH4 
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 15, 2022 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise to recognize the 25th anniversary of 
Tech4, a design and engineer control systems 
company, in De Pere. 
This business came from humble begin-
nings when a group of engineers came to-
gether on July 8, 1997, to build an automation 
company that both clients and employees 
could trust and believe in. The vision of four 
engineers and their marketing employee came 
to fruition after identifying a gap in the auto-
mation industry. As the business continued to 
grow, Tech4 continued to live by its founding 
mission of providing high-quality service and 
by utilizing a people-first mindset that is the 
key to the success of each individual project. 
I commend the founders of Tech4 and their 
team members for their continued service and 
dedication to their work. 
For the past 25 years, Tech4 has provided 
services to nearly 400 by improving their man-
ufacturing business through implementing re-
nowned automation and power system solu-
tions. Regardless of the size of the project, the 
lasting success of Tech4 comes from each 
employee treating every project as if it was 
their own. Tech4 has seen significant growth 
over the past 25 years. Beginning with a team 
of only 5 employees to nearly 30 has forced 
Tech4 to add on a second building. Through 
the expansion of different departments, includ-
ing its salesforce, Tech4 has remained un-
changed in its goal to create successful solu-
tions and to serve industrial manufacturers. I 
applaud Tech4 for its exceptional work, contin-
ued growth, and success for the past 25 
years. 
Since the beginning, Tech4 has placed an 
importance on giving back to its employees 
and to the community. Tech4 began spon-
soring the YMCA Chili Cookoff and has contin-
ued to be a great supporter of the Green Bay 
area and surrounding communities. Tech4 em-
ployees span from a wide range of back-
grounds, from scout leaders to VEX robotics 
judges, but they come together in their pas-
sion to give back to their communities. 
I invite all members of this body to join me 
in celebrating the 25th anniversary of Tech4. 
I extend my sincere congratulations to the 
Tech4 team on this outstanding milestone and 
wish them lasting success for the next 25 
years and beyond.

TRIBUTE TO THE LIFE OF 
NORMAN EARLY 
HON. DIANA DeGETTE 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 15, 2022 
Ms. DEGETTE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize one of Denver’s most dedi-
cated public servants, Norman ‘‘Norm’’ Early, 
who passed away on Thursday, May 5, 2022, 
at the age of 76. 
Norm was born and grew up, right here, in 
our nation’s capital. As a high school track 
star attending Calvin Coolidge Senior High in 
Washington, D.C., he was recruited to run 
track at American University. In addition to at-
tending classes and running track as a mem-
ber of the university’s track and field team, 
Norm also worked as a member of the 
school’s grounds crew to help pay his way 
through college. 
If all that wasn’t enough, Norm decided to 
run for—and ultimately became—American 
University’s first Black student body president 
in 1966. And, after graduating from American 
University in 1967, Norm went on to earn his 
law degree from the University of Illinois at Ur-
bana-Champaign. 
It was then, as a newly minted lawyer, that 
Norm decided to move to Denver where he 
immediately got to work helping some of the 
most vulnerable members of our community. 
Norm’s passion for helping others knew no 
bounds. He served 10 years as Chief Deputy 
District Attorney in Denver, before becoming 
Denver’s first Black District Attorney in 1983 
following his appointment by then-Governor 
Dick Lamm. Norm would serve in this post 
several years after winning successive elec-
tions in 1984, 1988, and 1992. 
Throughout his career, Norm used his posi-
tions to make Denver a better place to live 
and work. During his 10-year tenure as Den-
ver’s District Attorney, Norm earned numerous 
awards for his outstanding efforts to help vic-
tims of crime and the work he did to help sur-
vivors of sexual abuse. And even as he 
served our community, Norm also worked to 
found the Sam Cary Bar Association and the 
National Black Prosecutors Association where 
he would go on to serve as its first president, 
a position he would, again, use to promote 
justice and fairness throughout the country. 
There are endless stories from those who 
knew Norm best about the work he did to 
make Denver a more just place—and the bar-
riers he broke along the way. Even so, for 
those of us who considered him a friend, it’s 
Norm’s charm and wit that we will miss the 
most. He always had a kind smile to give and 
was always the first to offer a good laugh. 
Truly, I am grateful for the time I had to work 
with Norm and see firsthand his passion for 
public service and tireless compassion for sur-
vivors. 
As our community gathers to remember 
Norm’s life, I offer my heartfelt sympathies to 
his family, friends, and former colleagues. I 
hope they find comfort in knowing the lasting 
legacy Norm leaves behind. The work he did 
to break barriers and pave the way for a new 
generation of leaders has had a real impact 
on our city—and it will never be forgotten.

RECOGNIZING JOSE´ ANDRE´ S 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 15, 2022 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I was grateful to have attended the 
National Association of Broadcasters Leader-
ship Foundation’s annual Celebration of Serv-
ice to America Awards on Tuesday, June 7th. 
It was heartfelt to hear the acceptance speech 
by Jose´ Andre´s. His support for the people of 
Ukraine was so moving. 
The Service to America Leadership Award 
recognizes individuals and organizations re-
sponsible for improving the lives of others 
through extraordinary public service. It is the 
Foundation’s highest individual honor. 
This year, esteemed chef, bestselling au-
thor, educator, and humanitarian Jose´ Andre´s 
received the Service to America Leadership 
Award from the National Association of Broad-
casters Leadership Foundation. 
Andre´s is highly acclaimed globally for his 
avant-garde cuisine served through his res-
taurant collective, ThinkFoodGroup. Twice 
honored in Time Magazine’s ‘‘100 Most Influ-
ential People’’ and a New York Times best-
selling author, Andre´s was awarded the Na-
tional Humanities medal, which honors individ-
uals or groups whose work has deepened the 
nation’s understanding of the humanities, by 
President Barack Obama in 2015. In 2021, 
Andre´s launched Jose´ Andre´s Media, which 
will produce unscripted and scripted television 
series, books, podcasts, and digital content 
with a focus on stories about the power of 
food. 
Through his nonprofit World Central Kitchen 
(WCK), Andre´s leads humanitarian efforts to 
feed communities in need and reduce food in-
security during times of crisis. Andre´s and his 
team have served fresh meals to those af-
fected by man-made and natural disasters 
across six continents, including serving over 
3.6 million meals to those affected by Hurri-
cane Maria in Puerto Rico in 2017. 
Most recently, WCK partnered with local 
leaders, farmers, and restaurants to help 
those experiencing food insecurity caused by 
the COVID–19 pandemic and laying the foun-
dation for smarter national food policy. Andre´s 
and WCK have been on the ground in Ukraine 
cooking nonstop since late February, where 
they have served nearly 30 million meals. 
The NAB Leadership Foundation is proud to 
present Jose´ Andre´s with the 2022 Service to 
America Leadership Award.

HONORING CHRISTINE GALLAGHER 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 15, 2022 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of Christine (Chris) Galla-
gher upon her retirement from the United 
States Army Corp of Engineers where she 
served the San Francisco District’s Bay Model 
Visitor Center (Bay Model) in Sausalito, Cali-
fornia for nearly four decades, and for a life-
time of extraordinary public service. 
Originally from Maryland, Chris moved to 
Marin County to complete her B.A. in Environ-
mental Education from Dominican University in 
1983. Upon graduating, she joined the Na-
tional Park Service, working for the Golden 
Gate National Recreation Area in the Marin 
Headlands, before transitioning to the Re-
gional Office of the U.S. Forest Service-Pacific 
Southwest Region. Chris joined the Bay Model 
in 1986, serving the U.S. Army Corps of Engi-
neers as Education Coordinator and was soon 
promoted to Park Manager in 2001, a position

During her tenure with the Bay Model, Chris 
was an integral member of the management 
team, leading critical improvement projects, in-
cluding a $16.5 million renovation that fea-
tured the U.S. Army Corps of Engineer’s larg-
est solar installation. Hosting 150,000 visitors 
a year, the Bay Model has long been a pin-
nacle of community education, and with 
Chris’s exemplary ambassador skills, its sig-
nificance grew. She fostered and developed 
partnerships across the local community, gov-
ernment entities, and educational groups. 
When COVID–19 presented an unprecedented 
challenge for education centers like the Bay 
Model, Chris sprang into action, converting the 
facility into a space for manufacturing Per-
sonal Protective Equipment (PPE). Between 
April and May of 2020, 10,000 face shields 
were shipped from the Bay Model, directly 
supporting the pandemic response during a 
pivotal time for the Nation. 
In addition to her exemplary service to the 
Bay Model, Chris is a dedicated volunteer, 
sharing her skills and energy as a valued 
member 
of 
the 
Sausalito 
Rotary 
Club, 
Sausalito 
Chamber 
of 
Commerce, 
the 
Sausalito-Sakaide Sister City program, and 
several other city boards and committees. This 
service has been recognized with numerous 
accolades throughout her tenure, including the 
Commander’s Award for Civilian Service and 
Achievement Medal for Civilian Service. 
The breadth and depth of Chris’s profes-
sional and volunteer career are inspiring, and 
her many positive contributions will continue to 
impact the community for years to come. 
Madam Speaker, I respectfully ask that you 
join me in expressing gratitude to Chris for her 
enduring service and extending heartfelt con-
gratulations on her retirement from the U.S. 
Army Corps of Engineers and Bay Model Vis-
itor Center and best wishes on her next en-
deavors.

HOMETOWN HERO—MIKE E. 
SIMONDS 
HON. BETH VAN DUYNE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 15, 2022 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Mike E. Simonds, Senior 
Chief at Tarrant County Sheriffs Office. We 
congratulate Senior Chief Simonds on his re-
tirement after dedicating 42 years of service to 
the citizens of Tarrant County, including 21 
years with the Arlington Police Department. 
Senior Chief Simonds has served an instru-
mental role in our community and state 
through years patrolling our streets, keeping 
drugs out of our cities and ensuring murderers 
were put behind bars. His unwavering commit-
ment is unmatched, from assisting in the im-
plementation of the nationwide Amber Alert 
Program, to helping develop the number one 
Human Trafficking Unit in North Texas, to 
building a robust Narcotics Unit, to growing 
the largest Auto Theft Task Force in the state. 
Senior Chief Simonds served the last 5 
years as the first Senior Chief for the Tarrant 
County Sheriffs Office with honor and integrity, 
bringing exceptional leadership to the agency. 
I thank Senior Chief Simonds for his leader-
ship and the lasting impact he has made with 
our law enforcement partners. He serves as a 
role model and mentor to future leaders main-
taining the highest of standards. I congratulate 
him on his retirement and lasting memory of a 
career of service.

RECOGNIZING INSPECTOR CHRIS-
TOPHER WELSH OF THE FLOR-
IDA DEPARTMENT OF CORREC-
TIONS OFFICE OF THE INSPEC-
TOR GENERAL ON THE OCCASION 
OF HIS 28 YEARS OF DISTIN-
GUISHED SERVICE 
HON. BILL POSEY 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 15, 2022 
Mr. POSEY. Madam Speaker, on April 21, 
2022, Inspector Christopher Welsh retired 
after 28 years of distinguished service from 
the Florida Department of Corrections Office 
of the Inspector General. Christopher has dis-
tinguished himself as leader in his selfless 
dedication to the law enforcement profession, 
leaving each post and every person who has 
worked with him or under his leadership better 
off. He will be missed by all those who have 
had the privilege to serve with him. 
Christopher began his career with the Flor-
ida Department of Correction as a Correctional 
Officer at Broward Correctional Institution in 
1994. He quickly moved up the ranks and by 
2007 he was promoted to Inspector at the 
Martin Correctional Institution handling cases 
involving employee misconduct and malfea-
sance within the Florida Department of Cor-
rections. In 2015 he was promoted to Lead In-
spector in the Region 5 area where he trained 
and mentored new inspectors. In 2021 he was 
again promoted to Inspector Supervisor in Re-
gion 5 area and retired in 2022. 
Mr. Welsh’s noteworthy career extends be-
yond his time at the Florida Department of 
Corrections. Before serving in the FDC, Mr. 
Welsh served as a police officer in the United 
States Air Force and is a veteran of Operation 
Desert Storm. We are grateful for his military 
service. He is also a graduate of the Law En-
forcement Academy and a Criminal Justice 
and Standards training Commission Certified 
Instructor. Mr. Welsh is a man of faith having 
served as the Youth and Family Minister at 
our Savior Lutheran Church in Plantation, FL, 
and is also an avid volunteer with a decades 
long commitment to giving back to his commu-
nity. He coached the wrestling team at Sebas-
tian High School and has coached baseball 
and football in local recreational leagues. 
Mr. Welsh, a hardworking father dedicated 
to his faith, his family, and his community, em-
bodies the American Dream and all that 
makes this nation so great. I urge my col-
leagues to join me in recognizing Mr. Chris-
topher Welsh and his exceptional career on 
the occasion of his retirement.

RECOGNIZING THE KIWANIS CLUB 
OF THE STROUDSBURGS’ 100TH 
ANNIVERSARY 
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 15, 2022 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, today 
I honor the Kiwanis Club of the Stroudsburgs 
as its members celebrate its 100th anniver-
sary. The occasion will be celebrated with a 
dinner on Wednesday, June 15, 2022 at the 
Shawnee Inn and Golf Resort. 
On June 9, 1922, prominent businessmen 
and professionals gathered at the Penn Stroud 
Hotel to meet with the state Kiwanis Club or-
ganizer to discuss chartering a Kiwanis Club 
in Monroe County, Pennsylvania. On June 19, 
1922, the Club was officially chartered with 
A.R.J. Wallace elected president and the Penn 
Stroud Hotel chosen as the headquarters for 
meetings. Charter Night was celebrated on 
July 20, 1922 by Club members and delegates 
from Kiwanis Clubs in Scranton, Easton, and 
other cities. That first year featured a Ladies’ 
Night, five social events, a joint meeting with 
Rotary and a Rotary-Kiwanis golf match, youth 
and adult service activities, and projects to 
support the community. 
Committed to the Kiwanis mission of im-
proving the lives of children, the biggest 
project done by the Club during its first two 
decades was the Stroudsburg playground. The 
Club also financially supported a swimming 
pool and the East Stroudsburg playground, es-
tablishing recreational facilities used by hun-
dreds of children in the region. To encourage 
literacy, the Club purchased the first book-
mobile. The Club also supported several adult 
activities and actively engaged with the com-
munity. 
Today, the Kiwanis Club of the Stroudsburg 
continues to uphold the original mission of its 
founders to serve children of the world and 
their own community. A highlight of the year is 
the annual Pancake Day event to raise money 
to support their scholarship program. This 
year, due to the event’s great success, the 
Club awarded 12 scholarships to high school 
students in Monroe County totaling more than 
$12,000. 
As they look toward their next 100 years, 
the Club is planning to honor the first projects 
completed by the Club by enhancing six local 
parks with accessible playground equipment 
so children of all needs and abilities can enjoy 
the outdoors at the community’s parks and 
playgrounds. 
I am honored to congratulate the Kiwanis 
Club of the Stroudsburgs for 100 years of giv-
ing back to the Monroe County community 
and supporting our region’s youngest citizens. 
I wish them great success and many fulfilling 
years to come.

Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Madam Speak-

the greater Clark and Cowlitz Counties, as we 
celebrate the centennial of Planters Days. 
This festival, which began 100 years ago, 
has withstood the test of time and has been 
a bedrock event in this community. Originally, 
the festival was created to celebrate the con-
struction of dikes along the Columbia and 
Lewis rivers to prevent flooding and allow 
farmers to safely plant crops. The first Plant-
ers Day was a single-day event, which in-
cluded tours of the recently completed dikes,

RECOGNIZING ROSA MALONE 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 15, 2022 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, today I want to 
honor Rosa Malone, long-time Detroit resident 
and community Mother. Rosa passed away in 
2019, but the new Rosa cafe named in her 
honor will carry her legacy. 
When Rosa and her husband Elijah moved 
to Detroit’s Rosedale Park neighborhood in 
1973, it was segregated and predominately 
white. Initially prohibited from purchasing the 
home, the Malones fought systemic racism to 
become one of the first African-American fami-
lies to become homeowners in the neighbor-
hood. The Malones’ home was at the center of 
countless family gatherings, and beyond that a 
symbol of justice and change. Rosa believed 
in honoring the past while being in the present 
to build a community. 
The 13th District and Grandmont Rosedale 
Communities are honored to celebrate and 
commemorate the memory of Rosa and the 
opening of this local neighborhood business. 
Spaces such as this are essential to our com-
munity’s fabric and we look forward to seeing 
the success of Rosa. 
Please join me in celebrating Rosa Malone’s 
legacy and memory on this special day, on the 
opening of the Rosa coffee shop.

HOMETOWN HERO—CHRISTINA 
O’REAR 
HON. BETH VAN DUYNE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 15, 2022 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Grapevine Police Detective 
Christina O’Rear, who was recently named 
Mental Health Peace Officer of the Year by 
the Texas Crisis Intervention Team Associa-
tion. 
As May is Mental Health Awareness Month, 
this recognition is a timely reminder of the in-
credible work Detective O’Rear is doing to bet-
ter our community. 
Detective O’Rear not only serves as the pri-
mary liaison between Grapevine PD and North 
Texas mental health resources and hospitals, 
but she has gone above and beyond by fol-
lowing up with individuals dealing with mental 
health crises even after their police cases are 
terminated. 
This extra and oftentimes life changing step 
is an excellent display of the kind of person 
Detective O’Rear is. By putting others ahead 
of herself and ensuring these individuals re-
ceive the proper care they need, I can think of 
no one more deserving of the Mental Health 
Peace Officer award. 
I have gotten to see what a remarkable and 
dedicated public servant Detective O’Rear is 
after I selected her to serve on my Texas-24 
Law Enforcement Advisory Board. It is rare to 
find someone who is as passionate and skilled 
at their job as she is. It is an honor to recog-
nize her today. 
I thank Detective O’Rear for her constant 
service to Texas-24.

HONORING VICE PRESIDENT MATT 
MCLOGAN ON HIS RETIREMENT 
FROM 
GRAND 
VALLEY 
STATE 
UNIVERSITY 
HON. FRED UPTON 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 15, 2022 
Mr. UPTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Mr. Matt McLogan for his 35 
years of distinguished service as Vice Presi-
dent of University of Relations of Grand Valley 
State University. 
After obtaining his bachelor’s and master’s 
degrees from Western Michigan University 
(Go Broncos), Mr. McLogan worked at WOOD 
TV as a journalist and news manager, making 
sure folks across west Michigan were kept in-
formed. Later, he served as the Public Service 
Commissioner for the state of Michigan, over-
seeing the state’s investor-owned utilities. 
Matt’s dedication and passion for higher 
education has allowed him to serve students 
at several Michigan institutions. Matt served 
as an adjunct faculty member at Grand Rapids 
Community College where he taught political 
science. He also served at Michigan State 
University as a faculty member of the annual 
Regulatory Studies Program. 
Over the course of his distinguished tenure 
at Grand Valley State University, he has en-
sured the university not only has met but ex-
ceeded its goals. He has led government rela-
tions, University Development, and the com-
munications team, which included the univer-
sity’s public radio and TV stations. He has 
worked with many leaders at the local, state 
and national levels to obtain essential funding 
and support for GVSU, including for the Med-
ical Mile in downtown Grand Rapids. During 
his tenure, the university’s enrollment nearly 
tripled, expanding from one campus to five. 
Aside from his work at Grand Valley State 
University, he also has served on numerous 
boards, including the Grand Rapids Art Mu-
seum, the Public Education Fund, Frederik 
Meijer Gardens, and Opera Grand Rapids, en-
suring all in West Michigan have access to a 
strong and vibrant cultural life. 
Madam Speaker, as the Grand Valley State 
University community gathers this month to 
celebrate a truly remarkable leader, I want to 
congratulate Mr. McLogan on 35 years of ex-
traordinary service to GVSU and West Michi-
gan. I thank Mr. McLogan for his decades of 
service and extend congratulations on a well- 
deserved retirement. 
RECOGNIZING THE AMERICAN LE-
GION POST 283 ON ITS 100TH AN-
NIVERSARY 
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 15, 2022 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise to congratulate the American Legion Post 
283 Harold C. Anderson on its 100th Anniver-
sary. 
Post 283 was founded on January 24, 1922, 
when 15 founding members came together to 
sign the Legion constitution forming the Suring 
American Legion Post. For 100 years, the 
Suring American Legion Post 283 has upheld 
the vision of legions across the country to the 
highest degree. Post 283 proudly carries the 
name of Maple Valley native and World War 
One veteran, Private Harold Christian Ander-
son, Private Anderson enlisted in the armed 
forces in 1917, joining the 32nd Infantry Divi-
sion in Waco, Texas before quickly being 
shipped to France. Private Anderson was 
wounded in action in France on October 7, 
1917, and succumbed to his wounds 6 days 
later just weeks before his 22nd birthday. He 
was buried in France until he was exhumed 
and returned home to Oconto County. 
The legion carries on the memory, service, 
and sacrifice of Private Anderson through their 
vision of strengthening America by improving 
the lives of veterans, the military, and their 
families. 
Post 283 has continued to grow from their 
beginnings of 15 founding members 100 years 
ago. Post 283 now has over 80 members lo-
cated across the United States, who work to-
gether to teach future generations about the 
importance of service. The members of Post 
283 are a true inspiration and example for all 
Americans. The continued service and dedica-
tion that the members of Post 283 have 
shown to not only the Suring community, but 
to the United States of America is deserving of 
the highest degree of recognition. As we cele-
brate the 100th Anniversary of Post 283, we 
must recognize the outstanding services that 
they have and continue to provide to Suring 
and surrounding communities. Post 283 en-
joys supporting the local Suring High School 
and other organizations in countless ways. 
Post 283 has been a voice for the men and 
women who have served our country. At Post 
283 every day they put country before self, 
just as they did the day they joined the serv-
ice. American Legion Post 283 Harold C. An-
derson is a true credit to Northeast Wisconsin. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in honoring 
the Suring American Legion Post 283 Harold 
C. Anderson as they come together to cele-
brate their 100th Anniversary.

June 15, 2022 
After 16 years of service to the Capitola Po-
lice Department, Chief Turegano began his 
service to the Central Valley on August 1, 
2012, after a unanimous decision by the 
Huron City Council. Throughout his career, he 
has found success in multiple positions in dif-
ferent departments. This includes solving a 
1972 homicide case, the department’s oldest, 
in 2007. 
Under his leadership, the Huron Police De-
partment has exceeded expectations. Chief 
Turegano helped obtain grants that would add 
police officers for community outreach, prevent 
tobacco sales to minors, and purchase an am-
bulance as well as an ambulance facility. 
Chief Turegano coordinated the location and 
funding for a Boys & Girls Clubs of America 
facility in Huron and has created employment 
opportunities for high school students at the 
Harris Ranch Inn & Restaurant. 
Chief Turegano’s dedication, leadership, 
and commitment to excellence serves as an 
incredible model for all those who will follow in 
his footsteps. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
United States House of Representatives to 
join me in recognizing Chief George Turegano 
for his lifetime of service.

RECOGNIZING 
JORDAN 
DASHOW 
AND 
HIS 
SERVICE 
TO 
THE 
HOUSE COMMITTEE ON THE JU-
DICIARY 
HON. JERROLD NADLER 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 15, 2022 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
thank Jordan Dashow for his service to the 
House Committee on the Judiciary. 
Jordan received his bachelor’s degree from 
Tufts University and began his career in public 
policy as a Legislative Assistant with the Reli-
gious Action Center of Reform Judaism. After 
a further three years of civil and human rights 
advocacy as a Federal Policy Manager with 
the Human Rights Campaign, Jordan joined 
the Judiciary Committee as a Professional 
Staff Member in 2019. 
Jordan supported the full committee’s senior 
staff and me directly. As part of my adminis-
trative team, Jordan innovated and systema-
tized many areas of personnel management. 
Over time, Jordan’s duties grew to include 
helping me prepare for the weekly meeting of 
Committee Chairs. He contributed to countless 
projects with keen research, writing, and policy 
analysis. 
Jordan also worked closely with the Sub-
committee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, 
and Civil Liberties. Building on his past experi-
ence with the legislation as an advocate, Jor-
dan contributed significantly to our work on the 
Equality Act which passed the House both in 
the previous Congress and this Congress. Jor-
dan also supported the Subcommittee’s efforts 
on reproductive rights issues, church and state 
issues, and anti-Muslim and anti-Asian dis-
crimination issues. Reflecting our high regard 
for his work, Jordan assisted Counsel in pre-
paring Committee Members for the markup of 
the PRESS Act and wrote the initial draft of 
the committee report for the CROWN Act. 
Finally, Jordan played an integral role in the 
growth and development of our Committee in-
ternship program, an essential source of sub-
stantive support for myself and the Committee 
staff. As a coordinator of the program, Jordan 
successfully advocated for interns to receive 
pay, well before that became the norm, and 
managed professional development program-
ming such as detailed orientations and our 
weekly Intern Speaker Series. Furthermore, 
Jordan always worked to ensure that my com-
mitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion was 
reflected in our intern hiring practices and cul-
ture. He is already remembered as a deter-
mined advocate and committed mentor by the 
many classes of interns that he shepherded 
through our Committee, and I am grateful to 
Jordan for helping make our internship pro-
gram one of the strongest on Capitol Hill. 
For three years, I have been fortunate to 
count Jordan among my staff. I, and the 
American people, have greatly benefited from 
his passion for public service, his intellect, and 
his commitment to excellence. Jordan has all 
the qualities of an excellent staffer and the 
clear potential to be a great lawyer when he 
graduates from Georgetown Law in the com-
ing years. We will greatly miss Jordan as he 
embarks on the next chapter of his career on 
Capitol Hill. 
We thank Jordan Dashow for his service to 
the Committee and wish him the best of luck 
with this new chapter.

TRIBUTE 
TO 
DEE 
LACEY—CALI-
FORNIA’S 24TH CONGRESSIONAL 
WOMAN OF THE YEAR 
HON. SALUD O. CARBAJAL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 15, 2022 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Madam Speaker, each 
year, through the Women of the Year Award, 
my office extends special recognition to 
women on the Central Coast who have made 
a difference in our community. I would like to 
recognize one outstanding Woman of the Year 
Award recipient, Dee Lacey of Paso Robles, 
California. 
A longtime Paso Robles resident and leader 
in San Luis Obispo County, Dee Lacey is 
dedicated to Paso Robles and the surrounding 
county. Her extensive efforts contribute to 
Paso Robles’s strong sense of community and 
tradition. 
San Luis Obispo County was built on a bus-
tling agriculture industry in which Dee is an 
active leader. She has co-owned Lacey Live-
stock since 1963, maintaining a cattle ranch 
while serving terms on the San Luis Obispo 
County Farm Bureau Board of Directors, the 
California Mid State Fair Board of Directors 
and as president of both the San Luis Obispo 
County Cattle Women’s Association and the 
California Cattle Women’s Association. Dee’s 
advocacy has been vital to promoting the SLO 
County beef industry raising awareness of ac-
tivities that impact ranch life and helping to 
preserve the local agricultural heritage that 
shaped the county. 
Dee’s civic engagement stretches beyond 
the agriculture industry and over 50 years, be-
ginning with the local school board. She is de-
termined to provide quality education for San 
Luis Obispo County residents of all ages, in 
school and out. In addition to 20 years of serv-
ice on the Paso Robles School Board, Dee 
has served on the Cuesta Community College 
District Board of Trustees and the Cuesta Col-
lege Foundation Board of Directors. Dee was 
also a founding member of the Paso Robles 
Library Foundation and the Paso Robles Chil-
dren’s Museum. 
Dee’s passion for her community is further 
highlighted by her leadership and continued 
involvement in countless organizations. From 
the San Luis Obispo Community Foundation, 
the San Luis Obispo County Botanical Foun-
dation and Community Action Partnership of 
San Luis Obispo, Dee is committed to creating 
opportunity across the community. She co- 
chaired the Paso Robles 125th Anniversary 
celebration and Studios on the Park, events 
that celebrate the best of Paso Robles. For 
her continued dedication, she has already 
been recognized as Paso Robles Citizen of 
Year, San Luis Obispo County Cattle Woman 
of the Year, and the 33rd Assembly District 
Woman of the Year for 2005. Dee’s lifetime of 
service to Paso Robles and the San Luis 
Obispo County community is an inspiration to 
women and men throughout the district. Dee’s 
tireless work sets a sterling example for a 
community of cattle ranchers as well as stu-
dents and activists across the county. She is 
a worthy candidate for this honor and a role 
model for community leaders of all kinds. 
I am honored to recognize Dee Lacey for 
her continued commitment to San Luis Obispo 
County. I ask all Members to join me today in 
honoring an exceptional woman of California’s 
24th Congressional District, Dee Lacey, for 
her incredible service to her community.

HOMETOWN HERO—LEGION POST 
NO. 379 
HON. BETH VAN DUYNE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 15, 2022 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor our Texas 24 Hometown He-
roes of the week, the incredible veterans of 
the American Legion Post No. 379 in Bedford, 
TX. 
American Legion Post No. 379 holds a sig-
nificant place in Texas history. Since 1964, 
they have dutifully upheld the four pillars of 
the American Legion: Americanism, Children 
and Youth, National Security, and Veterans 
Affairs and Rehabilitation. In doing so, they 
have exemplified pride for 
our 
country, 
mentored and inspired our future generations, 
promoted strong national security, and dis-
played devotion to their fellow service mem-
bers and veterans. 
Furthermore, as the largest veterans post in 
the DFW area, they have played an integral 
part in preserving the legacy of our heroes 
and increasing awareness for our veterans. 
They have given returning vets more than ac-
tivities, but a community. 
Last week, Post No. 379 was awarded a 
Texas historical marker. I can’t think of a bet-
ter group to receive this honor than these men 
and women. Without their efforts to bring to-
gether North Texas veterans and keep the 
flame of history lit for generations, the legacy 
they have had on our country would likely be 
lost. I thank Post No. 379 for everything they 
have done for their country and community.

HONORING SAGE LADIEU 
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 15, 2022 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in recognition of Sage Ladieu, who is being 
honored for his retirement from the military. 
Sage first answered the call to service in 
1992, when he enlisted in the U.S. Navy as an 
aviation firefighter in California. Over the next 
29 years, he moved up the ranks and most re-
cently served as Command Sergeant Major for 
the 54th troop Command Brigade, providing 
guidance on the training, development, stand-
ards, traditions, discipline and welfare of the 
enlisted soldiers. Throughout his various roles 
in New Hampshire, across the country, and 
overseas, Sage had a profound impact on the 
lives of countless others. 
Prior to his work as Command Sergeant 
Major for the 54th troop, Sage served as a 
Senior Enlisted Leader for both the 195th 
Regiment and the New Hampshire Army Na-
tional Guard Recruiting and Retention Bat-
talion. His responsibilities included supervising 
and mentoring staff, instructors, and recruiters 
in the implementation of focused and effective 
programs. 
Despite being deployed to Saudi Arabia in 
1993 and Iraq in 2004, Sage never wavered in 
his commitment to bettering Granite State 
communities. He worked to connect with 
younger generations as a Noncommissioned 
Recruiting Officer and a Professor of Military 
Science at the University of New Hampshire 
ROTC. He has continuously served as a su-
pervisor, recruiter, mentor, and friend to so 
many in the community. Sage has worked tire-
lessly for his state and country and has right-
fully earned numerous service medals and 
commendations., 
On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-
shire’s First Congressional District, I want to 
thank Sage for his dedication and wish him 
the best in his well-deserved retirement. I con-
gratulate him again on his incredible career, 
and I thank him for all that he has done to 
keep our country safe.

RECOGNIZING ARNOLD ‘‘ARNIE’’ 
NETTEKOVEN 
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 15, 2022 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the life of a remarkable 
man: Arnold ‘‘Arnie’’ Nettekoven. A military 
veteran, retired Patrolman, and the first-ever 
historian at the Appleton Police Department, 
Arnie has dedicated his life to serving his na-
tion and community. 
Born and raised in Black Creek, Wisconsin, 
Arnie grew up working on his family farm be-
fore enlisting in the Marine Corps and serving 
in the Korean War. After returning home to 
Northeast Wisconsin, Arnie was sworn in as a 
Patrolman at the Appleton Police Department 
on April 1st, 1960. After 30 years of service to 
the Appleton Police Department, Arnie contin-
ued to serve his community in several capac-
ities including becoming the first Special In-
vestigator in the Outagamie County District At-
torney’s Office. Through his many roles, 
Arnie’s commitment and love for his commu-
nity never wavered. 
Arnie continued his contribution to the Ap-
pleton Police Department after retirement as 
the first-ever Department Historian. During his 
time as the historian, Arnie authored over 700 
pages detailing the outstanding history of the 
Appleton Police Department and the Fox Val-
ley. Arnie’s commitment and dedication to his 
role led to the Appleton Police Department 
Military Tribute Wall and Appleton Police Be-
nevolent Association Police Museum. Arnie’s 
hard work did not go unnoticed as he received 
recognition as ‘‘Volunteer of the Year’’ for his 
efforts to document the remarkable history of 
the Appleton Police Department in 2018. 
Arnie’s thoughtfulness and generosity will cer-
tainly be missed by many. However, the im-
pact he has left through his work will carry on 
for many generations to come. 
Madam Speaker, today the people of North-
east Wisconsin thank Amie for his extraor-
dinary commitment and service to his commu-
nity. My thoughts and prayers go out to his 
family and to all of the lives he touched.

HOMETOWN HERO—JAN HABERER 
HON. BETH VAN DUYNE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 15, 2022 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Jan Haberer, a Carrollton 
native, for her relentless fight to raise aware-
ness for Alzheimer’s. 
Jan is no stranger to service. Her father was 
a World War II veteran, her son is currently in 
the Navy, and according to her friends, she 
‘‘serves in many ways in the community.’’ 
After being diagnosed with mild cognitive 
impairment in 2013, Jan was forced to end her 
illustrious career as a missile defense engi-
neer for Texas Instruments. However, Jan 
viewed this ‘‘not as a death sentence, but a 
life sentence to help as many people as she 
could.’’ 
Following her diagnosis, Jan began raising 
awareness and much-needed funding for the 
Alzheimer’s Association. With her husband 
Randy, she eventually started her own Walk to 
End Alzheimer’s team, called ‘‘Jandy’s Clan.’’ 
Named after the partnership between Jan and 
Randy, this team is comprised of close 
friends, family, and dozens of passionate sup-
porters. 
Each year, Jandy’s Clan participates in the 
Walk to End Alzheimer’s, which helped her 
team become a top Dallas fundraiser in 2021. 
This incredible feat has gone a long way in 
Alzheimer’s care, support, research, aware-
ness, and advocacy. Furthermore, Jandy’s 
Clan partners with the nonprofit, Secure Our 
Seniors’ Safety, to ensure residents in senior 
living facilities are secure from criminal activ-
ity. 
Jan’s resilience in the face of adversity is 
not only an inspiring story, but it has benefited 
North Texas and all those suffering from Alz-
heimer’s. I thank Jan, and hope she keeps up 
the hard work in her mission to fight Alz-
heimer’s.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF 
THE 
HONORABLE 
ALAN 
ROSENFIELD 
HON. MIKE GARCIA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 15, 2022 
Mr. GARCIA of California. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to remember the life and service 
of the Honorable Alan Rosenfield, who served 
for more than 15 years as a judge for the Los 
Angeles County Superior Court. Throughout 
his life and career, Judge Rosenfield exempli-
fied what it meant to be a public servant with 
dignity, honor, and integrity. 
Growing up in the San Fernando Valley, 
Alan was an exemplary student, charming 
friend, and dedicated son. Returning to Los 
Angeles after spending his college years in 
Iowa, Alan first began his life of service by 
joining the Los Angeles County Sheriff Depart-
ment, one of the most storied and prestigious 
law enforcement agencies in California. While 
protecting and serving the citizens of Los An-
geles County, he worked hard to also obtain 
a law degree, being admitted to the California 
Bar in 1981. After becoming an attorney, Alan 
continued his career as a Deputy District At-
torney, enforcing the law and prosecuting dan-
gerous criminals. 
In 1990, Alan become the Honorable Judge 
Rosenfield after being appointed to the 
Newhall Municipal Court by California Gov-
ernor George Deukmejian. He was later ele-
vated to the Los Angeles County Superior 
Court in 2000, where he served for 17 years 
and had jurisdiction over cases in Santa 
Clarita and the Antelope Valley. As a judge, 
Rosenfield applied the law fairly and equally, 
fostering a justice system that upheld the val-
ues of our Constitution while also protecting 
the freedoms and security of law-abiding citi-
zens. Even after his retirement, he continued 
to serve as an assigned judge and remained 
an active member of the Santa Clarita com-
munity, continuing to give back and devote 
time to charitable causes. Serving in the U.S. 
Army Reserves for nearly three decades, 
Judge Rosenfield was the recipient of the dis-
tinguished Judge Advocates Association Out-
standing Career Armed Services Attorney 
Award.

TRIBUTE TO JEAN MCCOWN ON 
HER RETIREMENT 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 15, 2022 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Jean McCown, her career in public 
service, and as Associate Vice President of 
Government Affairs at Stanford University. 
Jean is a graduate of the University of Michi-
gan and Boalt Hall Law School. Before joining 
Stanford in 2004, she was a partner at the law 
firm of Ritchey Fisher Whitman & Klein, where 
she focused on land use, environmental and 
real estate matters. 
Jean was a member of the Palo Alto City 
Council from 1990 to 1998 and served as 
mayor in 1993. She previously served on the 
Palo Alto Planning Commission and on re-
gional transportation committees including the 
CalTrain Joint Powers Board and the Metro-
politan Transportation Commission. 
Jean McCown served on the board of the 
Greenbelt Alliance for many years and is now 
a board member of the Palo Alto Community 
Foundation and Alta, formerly the Palo Alto 
Housing Corporation. 
The honors she has earned include the 
John W. Gardner Leadership Award in 1994 
from American Leadership Forum Silicon Val-
ley, and the Palo Alto Chamber of Commerce 
Athena Award in 2004. 
As Associate Vice President within the Of-
fice of Government Affairs at Stanford, Jean 
McCown focused on the University’s govern-
ment and community affairs efforts and initia-
tives at the city, county and state level. She 
maintained 
relationships 
with 
community- 
based organizations, government officials, 
local businesses and citizens to support effec-
tive communication and dialogue within the 
Stanford community and between Stanford 
and its neighbors. While at Stanford she pro-
vided strategic leadership for the Searsville 
Watershed Restoration project and provided 
strategic guidance for the Middle Plaza Hous-
ing Project in Menlo Park. She helped build 
supportive relationships with the Palo Alto Uni-
fied School District and secured the fire serv-
ices contract between Stanford and the Palo 
Alto Fire Department. Jean led multiple Gen-
eral Use Permit negotiations with Santa Clara 
County, provided strategic guidance for the 
Hospitals Renewal projects for the Stanford 
adult and children’s hospitals, and helped 
spearhead the Palo Alto Mayfield agreement 
creating new public playing fields and housing 
for the City. 
Madam Speaker, I ask the entire House of 
Representatives to join me in honoring Jean 
McCown for her extraordinary work and in 
wishing her every blessing in her well-de-
served retirement. 
HOMETOWN HERO—JEWISH 
COMMUNITY CENTER OF DALLAS 
HON. BETH VAN DUYNE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 15, 2022 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the Jewish Community 
Center of Dallas, which has gone above and 
beyond to better our community. 
The JCC’s mission is to bring the North 
Texas Jewish community together with their 
incredible facilities and programs, however 
they have done so much more than that. 
Each year, the JCC provides over 18,000 
hot meals to North Texan seniors, regardless 
of race or religion. As the pandemic loomed, 
the JCC’s resolve was unwavering. They con-
tinued their senior meal service with an inno-
vative drive-thru feature to keep seniors safe 
and well fed. 
The Jewish Community Center’s compas-
sion and service to its community should 
serve as an inspiration to all North Texans. I 
thank the JCC for going above and beyond to 
ensure North Texas is a brighter place to live 
every single day.

PASSAGE OF H.R. 7667, THE FOOD 
AND DRUG AMENDMENTS OF 2022 
HON. PRAMILA JAYAPAL 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 15, 2022 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
on the passage of H.R. 7667 the ‘‘Food and 
Drug Amendments of 2022.’’ Though I am 
grateful for many of the provisions in this bi-
partisan legislation, I have strong concerns 
that this bill does not go far enough to protect 
the American people—both patients and their 
doctors. This reauthorization, only occurring 
every five years, is one of our greatest oppor-
tunities to hold the pharmaceutical industry ac-
countable and to the highest standards pos-
sible to ensure access and protection for pa-
tients across the country. 
Typically, this routine reauthorization of user 
fees is coupled with incentives directed toward 
the pharmaceutical and medical device indus-
try. With each reauthorization to date, we have 
seen the increased adoption of expedited re-
view pathways leaving patients and their doc-
tors more uncertain that FDA approved treat-
ments are truly effective or safe. Often, these 
new pathways that hasten FDA’s regulatory 
review are coupled with financial incentives in-
cluding exclusivity periods that prolong high 
monopoly prices such that the American public 
is paying more for less. Last year’s controver-
sial approval of the Alzheimer’s disease drug, 
aducanumab (Aduhelm) laid bare this reality 
when the FDA approved this drug under the 
accelerated approval pathway despite harms 
including brain bleeding and swelling as well 
as uncertain clinical benefit. This shifted the 
focus of this year’s user fee reauthorization ef-
forts away from shortening FDA review times 
for new health technologies to reforms to rein-
state public trust into FDA ’s approval process. 
FDA’s accelerated approval pathway can be 
an important way for promising drugs to reach 
patients. 
But 
pharmaceutical 
corporations 
have largely failed to uphold their end of the 
bargain of completing critical studies to con-
firm that these drugs are truly beneficial. In-
stead, accelerated approval is being used by 
Big Pharma to drive further profits at the ex-
pense of patient safety and Medicare spend-
ing. Although H.R. 7667 would allow for great-
er FDA oversight of the accelerated approval 
pathway, this bill should have included much 
stronger 
reforms 
for 
accelerated-approval 
drugs. 
This bill should have made sure that FDA 
publicly engages with their advisory commit-
tees instead of industry sponsors behind 
closed doors. Recent studies have found that 
FDA has convened these independent experts 
less frequently—between 2010 and 2021, FDA 
went from hearing these groups for 55 percent 
of approved drugs to just 6 percent. Trans-
parency is paramount to ensuring trust in our 
government institutions. We should codify that 
meetings are made public and nothing should 
obscure a patient’s ability to see how and why 
a therapeutic approval was granted. 
Moreover, the bill should ensure that lower 
standards of evidence cannot be accepted to 
approve a drug. Clarification is needed to en-
sure that Real World Evidence (RWE) is ap-
propriately used to augment the post-approval 
studies that prove therapies approved are truly 
effective and research has shown that RWE 
has demonstrated promise for complementing 
clinical trials but not replacing them. When it 
comes to the safety of our constituents, we 
must ensure that speedy access does not 
eclipse safety. 
A recent study published in JAMA Health 
Forum explored how much Medicare and 
Medicaid spend on drugs granted accelerated 
approval by the FDA both before and after the 
drug’s clinical benefit is confirmed. The study 
found that for the 38 drugs granted acceler-
ated approval by the FDA between 2012 and 
2017: 
CMS spent almost $70 billion through 2020 
on these drugs; 
just over $50 billion (75 percent) was spent 
after the accelerated approval drugs were con-
verted to standard approval following comple-
tion of their required confirmatory trials; but 
almost 60 percent ($40 billion) of this 
spending was for drugs with confirmatory trials 
evaluating surrogate endpoints instead of as-
sessing meaningful clinical endpoints dem-
onstrating the effect of these drugs on how 
patients feel, function, or survive. 
In addition, this bill should squarely place 
patient safety at its core and mandate the 
automatic withdrawal of drugs, preliminarily 
approved under accelerated approval, that fail 
to prove efficacy. Not explicitly mandating that 
approval should expire one year after any tar-
get date of study completion, and in no case 
later than five years after the product is ap-
proved unless certain criteria relative to post 
approval studies are achieved, is a significant 
concession to the pharmaceutical industry that 
puts patients and payers at risk of prolonged 
medical and financial harms. There should be 
no barriers to removing a drug that at best is 
ineffective and at worst dangerous. 
Another troubling inclusion in the approved 
measure are additional provisions that would 
empower a sponsor company to request a 
meeting with the FDA Commissioner, a public 
comment period followed by responses by the 
agency, and a convening of the advisory com-
mittee to review the agency’s request for with-
drawal, wasting precious time. Rather, the

Secretary should have the power to convene 
and consult an advisory committee if the re-
view is needed, not if it is mandated by the 
sponsor company. Given current FDA re-
sources and staffing constraints, providing due 
notice with an explanation for the proposed 
withdrawal is sufficient. There should be no 
delay in protecting the health and safety of pa-
tients. 
We must ensure that the expedited thera-
peutic review process is transparent and fair— 
not a revolving door between the agency and 
industry. As of 2020, we have spent over $40 
billion in taxpayer dollars for drugs that never 
demonstrated benefit, all to line the pockets of 
pharmaceutical corporations. This is another 
example of why further reforms are needed to 
ensure we are protecting our constituents 
across the country and being thoughtful arbi-
ters of this reauthorization, which will define 
patient access and safety for the next five 
years. 
I am glad to see the bipartisan efforts 
achieved in the passage of H.R. 7667, but I 
do not believe this should be the last word on 
accelerated approval. I want to officially submit 
my concern that this bill does not go far 
enough to protect patients from unnecessary 
risk of exposure to unproven, ineffective, and 
potentially dangerous therapies. I hope to con-
tinue working with my colleagues to ensure 
the correct balance is struck between timely 
and safe access to therapies needed in the 
final passage of a bi-cameral reauthorization.

HONORING 
SHELTON 
GIBBS 
III, 
THE MINISTER OF GREENVILLE 
AVENUE 
CHURCH 
OF 
CHRIST 
(GACC) IN RICHARDSON, TEXAS, 
ON HIS RETIREMENT 
HON. LANCE GOODEN 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 15, 2022 
Mr. GOODEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor Shelton Gibbs III, the min-
ister of Greenville Avenue Church of Christ 
(GACC) in Richardson, Texas, on his retire-
ment. During his 53 years of service, Brother 
Gibbs passionately dedicated himself to his 
community, always putting the needs of his 
neighbors, his congregation, and his family be-
fore his own. 
Brother Gibbs followed in the footsteps of 
his late father, Dr. S.T.W. Gibbs, Jr., who 
served as the Stop Six Church of Christ min-
ister for over 50 years. He is also the grand-
son of both the late S.T.W. Gibbs, Sr. and 
C.C. Morgan, two great pioneer preachers. In 
Brother Gibbs’ 40 years of service to GACC, 
the congregation has grown from 140 mem-
bers to over 2000. The Gibbs family tradition 
of faithful service to the church of Christ is an 
example to us all. 
In the early 1970s, Brother Gibbs’ ministry 
brought him from Illinois to Texas. He served 
in various roles at Southwestern Christian Col-
lege, including his current position on the De-
velopment Board of Lifeline Chaplaincy and 
founding the school’s Guardian Plan. Brother 
Gibbs’ commitment to fostering the next gen-
eration of leaders at Southwestern Christian 
College was evident to the entire staff and stu-
dent body. 
Brother Gibbs began preaching 53 years 
ago and enthusiastically demonstrated his love 
for God and his congregation at several 
churches around the State of Texas, including 
Clarksville, Mineral Wells, Abilene, and Edge-
wood. His evangelistic work was not limited 
solely to the United States; his passion for 
growing the church led Brother Gibbs on cam-
paigns in Jamaica and Ghana. 
Brother Gibbs is retiring as minister of 
GACC after 40 dedicated years. His wife of 50 
years, Jeanette Gibbs, their four children, and 
ten beautiful grandchildren have been his 
greatest support system throughout his service 
at GACC, and I wish them all the best. 
I applaud Brother Shelton Gibbs III for his 
commitment to serving the congregation of 
Greenville Avenue Church of Christ.

HOMETOWN HERO—FUSION CORPS 
HON. BETH VAN DUYNE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 15, 2022 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Fusion Corps, Cistercian 
Preparatory School’s Robotics Team from Ir-
ving, Texas for their incredible accomplish-
ment earlier this year. 
The Fusion Corps won the top prize in the 
FIRST® Robotics Competition World Cham-
pionship in Houston, Texas, which featured 
456 teams from 12 countries and 43 U.S. 
states. 
Since 1991, this competition has tested stu-
dents from across the world on who can build 
the best industrialsized robot. This group of 
young North Texas minds proved to the world 
that our community harbors the kind of un-
matched talent and innovation it takes to be 
the best. 
Fusion Corps’ robot, Resilience, was a tes-
tament to the many challenges the team over-
came to bring home their school’s first-ever 
world championship. Despite many setbacks 
and limited resources, the students’ passion 
and dedication brought them success. 
I thank Fusion Corps for representing our 
North Texan community well on the global 
stage. They have made us all back home in-
credibly proud.

IN RECOGNITION OF WHIPP’S DIN-
ING AND BANQUET HALL 100TH 
ANNIVERSARY 
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 15, 2022 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise to recognize the 100th anniversary of 
Eddie Whipp’s Dining and Banquet Hall. Over 
the past 100 years, the Whipp Family has pro-
vided exceptional service to the people of 
Green Bay and throughout the State of Wis-
consin. 
What was once known as a church and 
horse stable in the 1800s, is now known as 
the incredibly successful Whipp’s Dining and 
Banquet Hall. Established in 1922, Joe 
(Wypizinski) Whipp began operating a saloon 
where many men, mostly farmers from 
throughout Northeast Wisconsin, would stop 
on their way home from a hard day’s work. 
Joe Whipp would run the tavern for nearly 18 
years until his eldest son, Eddie, took over. In 
1944, Eddie married his wife Dorothy and they 
would continue to build their team and serve 
their customers seven days a week, from 8:00 
am to 2:00 am. I commend the hard work and 
dedication that has resulted in the lasting 
growth and success for Whipp’s Dining Hall 
over 100 years. 
As the years passed by, Eddie Whipp’s re-
mained one of the most popular venues in the 
Green Bay area. In 1947, the first wedding re-
ception was held in the basement and the 
dance hall would soon become home to reg-
ular polka bands in the 1950s. One of Whipp’s 
most popular menu items today, the Friday 
Fish Fry, was prepared by Dorothy Whipp in 
her home kitchen attached to the business in 
1947. I applaud The Whipp Family’s focus on 
high-quality service and innovation that has 
led to consistent customer satisfaction since 
1922. 
Today, Eddie Whipp’s Dining and Banquet 
Hall continues to operate as a family business 
and that family has grown exponentially. In the 
small community of Poland, regulars have said 
that Whipp’s is more than just a supper club, 
it is a staple in the community. Some of 
Whipp’s regulars have been frequenting the 
establishment for over 50 years. Now in 2022, 
the fourth generation of the Whipp Family is 
running restaurant operations. Bridget Peters 
is the great-granddaughter of the original 
founder of the business and, Joe Whipp, who 
has carried on the mission of providing quality 
services and products to customers that 
began 100 years ago in 1922. For the past 
100 years, Whipp’s has become known for 
their Friday Night Fish Fry’s, homemade 
Chicken Dinners on Sunday and Wednesday 
nights, and their reception hall for weddings 
and other special events. 
I invite all members of this body to join me 
in celebrating the 100th Anniversary of Eddie 
Whipp’s Dining and Banquet Hall. I extend my 
sincere congratulations to the Whipp family 
and team for this outstanding milestone and 
wish them success for years to come.
