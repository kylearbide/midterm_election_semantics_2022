PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
The Earth is the Lord’s and the full-
ness thereof, the world and all who live 
therein. Holy God, You founded it on 
the seas and established it on the 
waters. 
Creator of the Earth and skies, to 
whom all truth and power belong, we 
ascend our prayers to You. We are 
humbled to stand in Your presence. 
Redeem us that we would be given 
clean hands and pure hearts, trusting 
not in idols of our own making, nor 
swearing to gods who seek to deceive. 
Give us Your blessings, O Lord. 
Make things right, O God, our Sav-
ior. 
May ours be the generation that 
seeks You. Then may we find You in 
our work, in our living, and in our 
world. 
In Your sovereign name we pray. 
Amen.

indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
The SPEAKER. The Chair will enter-

RECOGNIZING THE ONE-YEAR AN-
NIVERSARY OF THE DEATH OF 
VANESSA GUILLEN 
(Ms. GARCIA of Texas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize the 1-year 
anniversary of Vanessa Guillen’s death. 
Vanessa was one of my constituents 
before she was transferred to the Fort 
Hood military base for her Army train-
ing. She was a rising star before her 
life was tragically cut short. 
As Members of Congress, and as a na-
tion, we have the moral obligation to 
honor Vanessa’s memory and enact 
change that will end violence in our 
military installations. Her story has 
captivated Americans of all back-
grounds. It brought much-needed at-
tention to sexual assault in the mili-
tary. It has led to changes being imple-
mented at Fort Hood and at military 
bases throughout the world. 
Madam Speaker, I will not rest until 
there is justice for Vanessa Guillen and 
her family. My thoughts and prayers 
are with them today. 
f 
CELEBRATING EARTH DAY WITH 
FERNDALE AREA ELEMENTARY 
SCHOOL 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate 
Earth 
Day 
and 
recognize 
Mrs. 
Sweeney’s sixth grade class at Fern-
dale 
Area 
Elementary 
School 
in 
Cambria County, Pennsylvania. 
In March, Mrs. Sweeney’s class wrote 
an article called ‘‘Stewards of the En-
vironment.’’ Her students were inspired 
to start the ‘‘Every Bottle Back’’ 
schoolwide 
recycling 
program. 
The 
class set a goal of recycling 1,000 bot-
tles, and, as of today, they have col-
lected 1,486 bottles. 
Mrs. Sweeney’s class decorated recep-
tacles and spread the word throughout 
the school. The students kept track of 
their progress with a tally sheet, and 
every 2 or 3 days educators took the 
plastics to the Roxbury or Geistown re-
cycling center. 
The actions of these sixth graders 
continue to inspire others in the com-
munity. In fact, these sixth graders 
have inspired the local high school to 
start a similar program. They have set 
a great example proving that the lit-
tlest of actions can make a big dif-
ference. 
Thank you, Ferndale Area Elemen-
tary School, for your hard work and 
dedication to recycling. 
Mr. Speaker, as we celebrate Earth 
Day, let us use Ferndale Area Elemen-
tary School as an inspiration to re-
duce, reuse, and recycle. 
f 
INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT 
FOR THE NEXT GENERATION 
(Ms. DEAN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, before com-
ing to Congress, I served as a Pennsyl-
vania State Representative. The legis-
lation I was most proud to be a part of 
was the bipartisan Act 89 infrastruc-
ture bill that helped fix some of Penn-
sylvania’s crumbling roads and bridges. 
Signed into law by Governor Corbett 
in 2013, Act 89 was a serious investment 
in our infrastructure, but it is not 
enough. Nationwide, we know that an 
out-of-date infrastructure system is 
costly, energy inefficient, and dan-
gerous.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2060 
April 22, 2021 
Today, in a moment of low interest 
rates and historic need and a rapidly 
warming planet, we have an oppor-
tunity and an obligation to invest in a 
stronger, greener, and better connected 
future. 
The American Jobs Plan is that 
chance, a chance to build back better 
and make a generational investment 
for our grandchildren’s future. This in-
cludes: roads, bridges, public transpor-
tation, drinking water, broadband, and 
good, clean energy union jobs. 
I worked with a Republican legisla-
ture and a Republican Governor to help 
pass Pennsylvania’s infrastructure bill. 
I hope we can get together and work 
across the aisle for infrastructure in-
vestment for the next generation. 
f 
BENEFITS OF THE VACCINE AND 
RETURNING TO NORMAL LIFE 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
since March, I have traveled my dis-
trict, 
administering 
COVID–19 
vac-
cines. As a doctor and former Director 
of Public Health, I combat vaccine hes-
itancy by discussing the safety and ef-
fectiveness of the vaccine, and the ben-
efits of returning to normal lives, re-
moving our masks, gathering together, 
and reopening businesses and schools 
by attaining herd immunity. 
But the deepening mental health cri-
sis has become an epidemic within the 
pandemic. Yesterday, I read of yet an-
other youth suicide. Eighteen-year-old 
star quarterback Dylan Buckner, with 
plans to attend MIT, committed sui-
cide on January 7. His father said that 
the Illinois extended stay-at-home or-
ders and school closures greatly con-
tributed to his suicide. 
As leaders, it is our responsibility to 
encourage 
and 
incentivize 
vaccina-
tions. One incentive is by removing our 
masks and returning to normal. De-
spite having reached the traditional 
level of herd immunity by our Mem-
bers, our Chamber does not reflect a re-
turn to normal. 
I implore leadership and the Attend-
ing Physician to follow science and the 
CDC guidelines, and permit Members 
who have been vaccinated or who have 
naturalized immunity to forgo wearing 
a mask while in the Chamber, and 
incentivize and show the public that a 
world beyond the pandemic exists. 
Not another minute should go by 
where children as young as 9 years old 
commit suicide because they see no 
hope of a future beyond the pandemic. 
We cannot waste another second or an-
other young life. 
Let us remove our masks and show 
America that there can be a light at 
the end of the pandemic tunnel. 
f 
REAFFIRM OUR COMMITMENT TO 
THE EARTH 
(Ms. BONAMICI asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, in 
Northwest 
Oregon, 
raging 
wildfires 
have 
made 
the 
air 
unhealthy 
to 
breathe. Ocean acidification, harmful 
algal bloom, and hypoxia threaten our 
fisheries. Droughts and extreme weath-
er patterns jeopardize the livelihoods 
of our farmers. 
But there is hope. By recognizing the 
scale and urgency of the climate crisis, 
we can take meaningful action to ad-
dress it. 
Today, the Biden-Harris administra-
tion is convening a group of world lead-
ers to commit to ambitious action. We 
stand ready to work with them to 
enact policies that reduce emissions, 
create jobs, and support frontline com-
munities. 
Last year, I joined my colleagues on 
the Select Committee on the Climate 
Crisis in releasing our bold, com-
prehensive, science-based Climate Ac-
tion Plan to reach net-zero emissions 
no later than mid-century, and net- 
negative thereafter. It includes bills 
like my bipartisan Blue Carbon for Our 
Planet Act, which I am reintroducing 
today, to help capture the power of the 
ocean and coastal ecosystems in miti-
gating the climate crisis. 
The Climate Action Plan is our road 
map. Now, on this 51st anniversary of 
Earth Day, we must all reaffirm our 
commitment to the Earth and to tak-
ing bold action to solve the climate 
crisis. 
f 
KEEPING OBSCENE AND INDECENT 
CONTENT OFF OUR AIRWAVES 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, John 
Adams said our Constitution is fit for a 
moral and religious people, and is 
wholly inadequate to the government 
of any other. 
The average American watches about 
30 hours a week on broadcast TV. And, 
of course, what starts on broadcast TV 
winds up on other screens as well. The 
Federal Communications Commission 
is tasked with keeping obscene and in-
decent content off the airwaves. 
While there are some especially re-
sponsible parents who raise their chil-
dren with no TV in the house at all, as 
a practical matter, broadcast TV af-
fects the moral norms of the Nation. 
I have received complaints in my of-
fice, and rightfully so, about Cardi B 
and the GRAMMYs. They wonder why 
we are paying the FCC if they feel this 
should be in living rooms across the 
Nation. 
I realize that KAMALA HARRIS has 
used her fame to promote this per-
former, but I assure the FCC that mil-
lions of Americans would view her per-
formance as inconsistent with basic de-
cency. 
Wake up, FCC, and begin to do your 
job. The moral decline of America is 
partly due to your utter complacency. 
FULL ACCESS TO BENEFITS FOR 
VETERANS 
(Ms. UNDERWOOD asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, as a 
registered nurse and a member of the 
Veterans’ Affairs Committee, I have 
spent my time in Congress fighting to 
ensure that northern Illinois veterans 
and veterans across the Nation have 
full access to the benefits and support 
that they have earned. 
A critical part of that work has been 
focusing on ending the veteran suicide 
crisis by providing veterans with the 
resources they need and equipping VA 
employees and community partners 
with the training necessary to support 
veterans in crisis. 
That is why, this week, I reintro-
duced the bicameral Lethal Means 
Safety Training Act with Senator 
BLUMENTHAL
and 
Representatives 
BROWNLEY, MRVAN, LEVIN, and PAPPAS. 
This legislation is an evidence-based 
approach to prevent suicide, and it cre-
ates valuable time and space between a 
veteran in crisis and a potentially le-
thal means. 
I am honored that my bill has been 
endorsed by a broad coalition of vet-
erans service organizations and suicide 
prevention 
experts, 
including: 
The 
Nurses Organization of Veterans Af-
fairs, the American Foundation for 
Suicide Prevention, the Minority Vet-
erans of America, the American Asso-
ciation of Suicidology, and many more. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support 
the 
Lethal 
Means 
Safety 
Training Act and join me in the urgent 
mission of ending our veteran suicide 
crisis. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE AND 
MEMORY OF DAVID KERN 
(Mr. DAVIDSON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. DAVIDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to honor the life and memory of David 
Kern. 
David recently passed away at the 
age of 79, following a long fight with 
cancer. I am particularly extending my 
condolences to his beloved wife, Katy; 
his 4 children and 11 grandchildren. 
David was a veteran of the United 
States Army, a volunteer firefighter, a 
small business owner. He served as Lib-
erty Township Trustee for 32 years, and 
he was chairman of the Butler County 
Republican Party. He was an avid hun-
ter, fisherman, and conservationist. 
More than all that, however, he was a 
friend and someone who gave me sound 
advice and used his influence as a men-
tor. 
David Kern was a very good man, and 
his presence will be sorely missed by 
his family, our community, and all who 
knew and loved him.

RECOGNIZING JORGE CHAVES 
MEZA 
(Ms. CRAIG asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, as a Mem-
ber of Congress, it is such an honor to 
have the ability to help my constitu-
ents back home by solving problems 
and making our government work 
more effectively for them. 
Earlier this year, a man named Jorge 
Chaves Meza from Farmington, Min-
nesota, reached out to my office for 
help enlisting in the U.S. Marine Corps. 
You see, Jorge came to our community 
from Costa Rica in hopes of serving our 
country in the U.S. military, but his 
Permanent Resident Card was lost in 
the mail. 
This could have prevented Jorge from 
serving our Nation, but, fortunately, 
my office was able to work with the 
USCIS to expedite getting Jorge a re-
placement card. I am so glad to an-
nounce that he received it and just 
took his oath of enlistment. 
Stories like Jorge’s are the most re-
warding part of public service, and I 
am so proud of his commitment to 
serving our Nation. 
Thank you, Jorge, for your service.

D.C. STATEHOOD 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, yet an-
other blatant political power grab is 
underway on the heels of H.R. 1, na-
tionalizing all that is wrong with our 
elections, the packing of the Supreme 
Court, and now we have H.R. 51, an un-
constitutional bill to create a State of 
Washington, D.C. 
The Founders were very clear and 
specific to leave our District out of the 
coercion and the tentacles of a State 
trying to influence it. 
No. This is yet another naked power 
grab to ensure two new Democratic 
Senators in a 90 percent Democrat dis-
trict. That is the result they are trying 
to get. This new State would be 1/17th 
the size of Rhode Island and about the 
same population as Fresno, California. 
In 1847, the Virginia Retrocession Act 
took some of the excess land that they 
weren’t using and put it back into Vir-
ginia. We can do the same thing with a 
bill I am coauthoring, taking the 
unneeded part and putting it back into 
Maryland, instead of trying to create a 
State against the Constitution. 
This is a power grab that must be 
stopped. It is unconstitutional, and it 
goes against the grain of what our 
Founders had in mind to have separa-
tion. 
f

York. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House

Reform or their respective designees. 
The gentlewoman from New York

gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. COMER) 
each will control 30 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that all Members have 5 legis-
lative days in which to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and insert extra-
neous material on H.R. 51, the Wash-
ington, D.C. Admission Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia 
and my dear friend, Congresswoman 
NORTON, for her years of dedicated 
leadership on this bill. She is not only 
the author of the bill, but of this mo-
ment in history. 
Today, for the second time in 2 years, 
the House will vote to overturn the 
wrongs of over 200 years of political re-
pression in the District of Columbia. 
We will vote to honor the most funda-
mental principle of this Nation—that 
all people have a right to full and equal 
representation in their government. 
Our Nation has not always lived up 
to its promise of full and equal rep-
resentation, but that has not stopped 
those dedicated to equality from fight-
ing to ensure that all people are fully 
represented in their government. 
This fundamental right is denied to 
the more than 712,000 Americans living 
in the District of Columbia. For more 
than 200 years the District has been 
fighting for equal rights. Despite 86 
percent of its residents voting for 
statehood in 2016, Congress has still not 
acted to ensure that the District shares 
in the blessings of liberty promised by 
the Founders in the U.S. Constitution. 
The United States is a republic, but 
the people of its Capital lack represen-
tation. The United States is the only 
democratic country that denies both 
voting rights in the national legisla-
ture and local self-government to the 
people of its Capital. That is wrong and 
violates everything we stand for as 
Americans. 
The District pays more in Federal 
taxes than 21 States and more per cap-
ita than any State. Think about that. 
It pays more than nearly half the 
States in this country, yet D.C. resi-
dents have no vote in Congress. That is 
wrong. 
Unfortunately, so far Republicans 
have opposed our efforts to ensure 
equality for District residents. But let 
me be clear what Republican opposi-
tion is really about: partisanship. They 
would rather deny voting rights for 
hundreds of thousands of American 
citizens than even consider the possi-
bility that Representatives from the 
new State could possibly be Democrats. 
Think about that argument. They are 
willing to violate the core principles of 
our democracy merely because the new 
State 
might 
elect 
Representatives 
from a different political party. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge every 
Member in this House to vote ‘‘yes’’ on 
H.R. 51, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, America’s Federal Gov-
ernment should be of the people, by the 
people, and for the people. But with 
H.R. 51, America’s government will be-
come of the Democrats, by the Demo-
crats, and for the Democrats. 
Let’s be clear what H.R. 51 is all 
about. It is about Democrats adding 
two new progressive U.S. Senators to 
push a radical agenda championed by 
the squad to reshape America into the 
socialist 
utopia 
they 
always 
talk 
about. 
If you doubt me, just listen to what 
our 
colleague, 
Congressman 
JAMIE 
RASKIN, recently told The Washington 
Post. He said: 
There is a national political logic for D.C. 
statehood too, because the Senate has be-
come 
the 
principal 
obstacle 
to 
social 
progress across a whole range of issues. 
So there we have it. H.R. 51 is not 
really about voting representation. It 
is about Democrats consolidating their 
power in Washington. 
There are numerous problems with 
H.R. 51. Mainly, it is flatly unconstitu-
tional. Every Justice Department from 
President 
Kennedy’s 
to 
President 
Obama’s has been consistent that a 
constitutional amendment is needed to 
grant the District statehood. 
Robert F. Kennedy said that granting 
D.C. statehood without a constitu-
tional amendment was inconceivable. 
He also said granting D.C. statehood, 
as attempted by H.R. 51, would produce 
an absurdity. This absurdity is the 23rd 
Amendment which acknowledges the 
existence of a Federal District war-
ranting three electoral college votes. 
While H.R. 51 includes an expedited 
process for the 23rd Amendment’s re-
peal in Congress, the problem is this 
would not happen until after D.C. be-
comes a State. This would create mass 
confusion as H.R. 51 is reviewed by the 
courts for years. 
The Constitution is the foundational 
document upon which all laws of our 
country rest, and Congress cannot sim-
ply dismiss it with sham legislation. 
But that is what H.R. 51 attempts to 
do. Democrats want to rewrite the Con-
stitution without going through the 
proper process of doing so. 
During our committee’s markup of 
H.R. 51, I offered an amendment that 
would assure the 23rd Amendment’s re-
peal prior to statehood being granted, 
but Democrats opposed this amend-
ment. 
Why are Democrats pushing such a 
problematic bill through the House? 
Why are they working so hard to ad-
vance D.C. statehood instead of pur-
suing a constitutional amendment that

would 
engage 
the 
entire 
country 
through a process intended by our 
Founding Fathers? 
Because they know Americans have 
firmly rejected D.C. statehood. 
I urge my colleagues to vote with the 
vast majority of Americans and reject 
this unconstitutional and impractical 
bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to 
the distinguished gentlewoman from 
the District of Columbia (Ms. NORTON), 
who is the author of this bill and mo-
ment in history. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my good friend, the gentlewoman, for 
her leadership on this D.C. statehood 
bill. 
Congress has both the moral obliga-
tion and the constitutional authority 
to pass H.R. 51. This country was 
founded on the principles of no tax-
ation without representation and con-
sent of the governed, but D.C. residents 
are taxed without representation and 
cannot consent to the laws under 
which they, as American citizens, must 
live. 
The State of Washington, D.C., would 
consist of 66 of the 68 miles of the 
present-day Federal District. The Fed-
eral District would be 2 square miles, 
and Congress would retain plenary au-
thority over it. 
H.R. 51 complies with the Constitu-
tion, including the Admissions Clause, 
the District Clause, and the 23rd 
Amendment. 
The Admissions Clause gives Con-
gress the authority to admit new 
States. All 37 new States were admit-
ted by Congress. No State was admit-
ted by constitutional amendment, and 
no State would have to consent to the 
admission of the State of Washington, 
D.C. 
The District Clause gives Congress 
plenary authority over the Federal Dis-
trict and establishes a maximum size 
of the Federal District—100 square 
miles. It does not establish a minimum 
size or a location of the Federal Dis-
trict. Congress reduced the size of the 
Federal District by 30 percent in 1846. 
The 23rd Amendment allows the Fed-
eral District to participate in the elec-
toral college. H.R. 51 repeals the ena-
bling act for the 23rd Amendment, and 
the 23rd Amendment itself would be 
quickly repealed. In any event, the 23rd 
Amendment does not establish a min-
imum size or location of the Federal 
District. 
The Constitution does not establish 
any prerequisites for new States, but 
Congress 
generally 
has 
considered 
three: population and resources, sup-
port for statehood, and commitment to 
democracy. 
The State of Washington, D.C. would 
meet each. D.C.’s population of 712,000 
is larger than that of two States. D.C. 
pays more Federal taxes per capita 
than any State and pays more Federal 
taxes than 21 States of the Union. The 
District of Columbia’s gross domestic 
product is larger than 17 States. In 
2016, 86 percent of D.C. residents voted 
for statehood. D.C. residents have been 
petitioning for voting representation in 
Congress and local autonomy for 220 
years. 
Congress has a choice. It can con-
tinue to exclude D.C. residents from 
the democratic process, forcing them 
to watch from the sidelines as Congress 
votes on Federal and D.C. laws, and to 
treat them, in the words of Frederick 
Douglass, as ‘‘aliens, not citizens, but 
subjects.’’ 
Or it can live up to our Nation’s 
founding principles and join the 54 per-
cent of Americans—that is 54 percent, 
Mr. Speaker, and growing—who sup-
port D.C. statehood and pass H.R. 51. 
b 0930 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Georgia 
(Mr. HICE), the Republican leader of the 
Government 
Operations 
Sub-
committee. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the ranking member for yield-
ing. 
I don’t even know where to begin to 
respond to what we just heard. To 
imply that Washington, D.C., has no 
representation is absolutely false. It 
does have local representation. It also 
has a Delegate right here in the House 
of Representatives and has electoral 
votes for Presidential elections, things 
that no other city in this country has. 
This H.R. 51 flies in the face of what 
our Founders intended. They never 
wanted the seat of our government to 
be a State, and they specifically 
framed the Constitution to say so. Yet, 
what the Democrats really are trying 
to do, that they will not admit, is gain 
even more representation by creating a 
city-state whereby they get two more 
Senators. 
Again, this is absolutely against 
what our Constitution and our Found-
ers intended, and this ought to be 
soundly 
rejected, 
permanently 
re-
jected. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, in this historic mo-
ment, I yield 1 minute to the distin-
guished gentlewoman from California 
(Ms. PELOSI), the first female Speaker 
of the House in history. 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Madam 
Chairwoman 
MALONEY
for 
yielding, and I salute her for her lead-
ership in bringing this historic legisla-
tion to the floor. 
All of us join in saluting Congress-
woman ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON, who 
has been the patron saint of D.C. state-
hood since she came to Congress. She 
has been tireless, persistent, and dis-
satisfied as she has built historical sup-
port for this bill, which passed in the 
previous Congress with 235 votes. 
I rise as Speaker of the House to join 
my colleagues on this momentous day 
for American democracy as we right a 
historic injustice by passing legislation 
to finally grant Washington, D.C., 
statehood. 
Statehood for the District of Colum-
bia is about showing respect for our de-
mocracy, for the American people, and 
for our Constitution. That Constitu-
tion begins with our preamble, ‘‘We the 
people,’’ setting out our Founders’ vi-
sion of a government of, by, and for the 
people. 
Yet, for more than two centuries, the 
people of Washington, D.C., have been 
denied their right to fully participate 
in their democracy. 
D.C., 
as 
Congresswoman 
NORTON 
mentioned, pays more Federal taxes 
per capita than any other State. Its 
budget is larger than 12 States. Its pop-
ulation is larger than two States. Its 
people have fought in every American 
war since the Revolution. 
D.C. residents have been fighting for 
voting rights and autonomy for 220 
years, with a full 86 percent recently 
voting for statehood. 
It is well past the time to grant them 
the rights that they have been fighting 
for and that they deserve. 
As I said, Mr. Speaker, I rise as 
Speaker of the House on this momen-
tous occasion. It is an official honor to 
do so, but it is also a personal privilege 
to 
join 
Congresswoman 
ELEANOR 
HOLMES
NORTON; 
the 
distinguished 
chair of the committee of jurisdiction, 
Congresswoman MALONEY; many of my 
colleagues; and the distinguished ma-
jority leader, Mr. HOYER, who has made 
this part of his life’s work in the Con-
gress to join in this fight for statehood. 
It is a personal privilege because 
when I was born, my father was a Mem-
ber of Congress from Baltimore, Mary-
land, Thomas D’Alesandro, Jr. He 
served as chairman of the District of 
Columbia 
Appropriations 
Sub-
committee. That position made him 
the unofficial mayor of Washington be-
cause of the authority that the com-
mittee had over the District of Colum-
bia and their every decision. 
However, my father did not agree 
with that. He was a proponent for what 
was then called ‘‘home rule.’’ They 
often say that statehood for the Dis-
trict of Columbia is in my DNA. It 
went from home rule, then to finally 
having a mayor, and now we want 
statehood. We have always wanted 
statehood, but now we finally are able 
to pass it in the Congress. 
There is nothing theoretical or ab-
stract about statehood. For example, 
last summer, the country watched in 
horror as Federal agents and out-of- 
State National Guard troops were de-
ployed against peaceful protesters in 
the District without residents’ ap-
proval. Then, on January 6, as our Cap-
itol was being defiled, our Capitol Po-
lice assaulted and killed, and our Mem-
bers and staff terrorized, D.C. leaders 
did not have the authority to call the 
National Guard to protect its people. 
Granting D.C. statehood means en-
suring that its leaders have the tools 
they need to keep people safe. The Gov-
ernor of any one of our States has the 
authority to call in the National 
Guard. That is not an authority that is

afforded to the Mayor of Washington, 
D.C. If that were the case, we would 
have had protection much sooner. 
Statehood is also a matter of civil 
rights. The residents of the District 
have a right to self-governance and 
control over their lives and futures. 
It is particularly meaningful that we 
pass this legislation just days after the 
anniversary of President Abraham Lin-
coln signing the District of Columbia 
Compensated Emancipation Act, free-
ing enslaved people in the District. 
Today, by passing H.R. 51 to admit 
the State of Washington, Douglass 
Commonwealth into the Union, the 
House will finally address this unjust, 
unequal, and undemocratic situation. 
We look forward to a swift vote in 
the Senate on this essential legislation 
so that we can send this important leg-
islation to the President’s desk. 
At the same time, House Democrats 
will continue our work to protect every 
American’s right to be heard at the 
ballot box. I urge a strong vote for D.C. 
statehood, H.R. 51—the 51st State, easy 
to remember—and for its citizens’ civil 
liberties, security, and right to have a 
say in our democracy. 
I want to once again commend Rep-
resentative ELEANOR
Holmes Norton 
for her long dedication to justice for 
every person in our country, starting 
with the people she represents in the 
District of Columbia, hopefully soon to 
be the 51st State of the Union. I urge 
an ‘‘aye’’ vote. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Arizona 
(Mr. BIGGS). 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, let me tell 
you what Democrat support is really 
about on H.R. 51: Democratic partisan-
ship, Democrat power, Democrat pol-
icy, Democrat progressive issues. 
No State has been admitted by the 
Constitution. No State was created 
from a territory, which was crafted in 
the Constitution. That is what you 
want to obviate. 
Even our Founders understood this 
very clearly, as they iterated, in Fed-
eralist No. 43, ‘‘The indispensable ne-
cessity of complete authority at the 
seat of government carries its own evi-
dence with it. It is a power exercised by 
every legislature of the Union, I might 
say of the world, by virtue of its gen-
eral supremacy. Without it, not only 
the public authority might be insulted 
and its proceedings interrupted with 
impunity; but a dependence of the 
members of the general government on 
the State comprehending the seat of 
the government, for protection in the 
exercise of their duty, might bring on 
the national councils an imputation of 
awe or influence. . . . ‘’ 
That is what is at stake here. H.R. 51 
is bad, according to the Founders, but 
it also violates the 23rd Amendment. 
That is clear as well. 
It is time that the Democrats realize 
it and quit trying this power grab and 
vote this thing down. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CON-
NOLLY), chairman of the Government 
Operations Subcommittee. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my good friend, the distin-
guished chairwoman of our full com-
mittee, for yielding, and I thank my 
good friend, ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON, 
the Congresswoman from the District 
of Columbia, who soon I hope will have 
the right to vote on the floor of the 
House. 
Today, Mr. Speaker, we come to-
gether to right a wrong. 750,000 fellow 
Americans are denied the right to rep-
resentation in their Congress in the 
very place in which Congress is lo-
cated, ironically. It is the only capital 
in the democratic world that denies its 
own citizens the right to vote and be 
represented. 
We heard a lot of subterfuge here 
today, and we will hear more about the 
Constitution, the Constitution that 
clearly gives Congress the right of ad-
mission of a State. 
Mr. COMER
comes from Kentucky. 
Kentucky was composed of territory 
claimed by my State, Virginia, and 
there were a bunch of Whigs. We didn’t 
object. Congress, not a constitutional 
amendment, admitted Kentucky into 
the Union, and they elected Whigs, if 
you can think about that, Mr. Speaker. 
We didn’t make how you might vote 
a condition, but we do in this case. 
I have to say that there is a lot of 
smokescreen to cloak what is really at 
stake here. When some say this is not 
about race or partisanship, you can be 
sure it is about race and partisanship. 
A city with a minority-majority pop-
ulation that apparently might vote in 
a different way from some? So what. 
How somebody votes cannot be a test 
of whether they have the right to vote 
in a democracy. 
Will we right this wrong today? Will 
we rise above our petty partisan per-
spectives and fears and empower and 
enfranchise people who are fellow citi-
zens? Simply because of their race, 
their party identification, or their geo-
graphic location, that is not the Amer-
ica I know and love. It has gone on too 
long. 
When the Constitution was written, 
this place didn’t exist, nor did the 
Founders and the writers of the Con-
stitution know that it would. The first 
Capital was New York. The second Cap-
ital was Philadelphia. And there was a 
lot of back and forth about where it 
would finally be. It ended up here. 
Let’s right this wrong after 200 years 
and give our fellow Americans voting 
representation 
here 
in 
the 
United 
States Congress by granting statehood. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, if this bill 
is about race, I wonder why your ma-
jority leader, STENY
HOYER, voted 
against this very bill in 1993. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. JORDAN). 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, Democrats started last 
week with one of their Members saying 
we should get rid of the police alto-
gether. They ended last week with an-
other one of their Members being ad-
monished by the trial judge in Min-
neapolis for saying ridiculous things. 
What did they do in between? They 
passed out of committee this bill, 
which gives two more Democrat Sen-
ators to the District of Columbia. And 
less than 24 hours after that bill passed 
in committee, they introduced legisla-
tion to pack the Supreme Court. 
In 3 months of Democrats being in 
control of the Federal Government, 
they have increased the debt by $2 tril-
lion; they created a crisis on the south-
ern border; and they continued their 
push to defund the police. 
Now, so they can continue their rad-
ical policies, think about what else 
they have passed out of this body: a 
bill to federalize our voting laws, fed-
eralize our election laws; a bill to pack 
the Court, as I said. They introduced 
that legislation. The chairman of the 
Judiciary Committee, of all people, in-
troduced that bill. And here we are 
today, with a pure power grab to give 
two Democrat Senators to the District 
of Columbia. 
There is a crisis on our southern bor-
der. The American people want us to 
focus on the crisis. Even the President 
called it a crisis. 
Let’s stop the power grab. Let’s deal 
with the issues the American people 
want us to deal with. That is what we 
should be focused on. 
I hope we vote this bill down. I urge 
a ‘‘no’’ vote. 
b 0945 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to clarify 
that this should be a bipartisan issue. 
Republicans used to support voting 
representation in Congress for D.C. 
residents. 
Then-President Eisenhower called for 
equal political rights for D.C. residents 
in three State of the Union Addresses. 
Then-President 
Nixon 
said: 
‘‘It 
should offend the democratic senses of 
this Nation that D.C. residents do not 
have voting representation in Con-
gress.’’ 
In 2007, then-Representative Mike 
Pence said on the floor: ‘‘The fact that 
more than a half a million Americans 
living in the District of Columbia are 
denied a single voting representative in 
Congress is clearly a historic wrong.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
Maryland 
(Mr. 
RASKIN), the chairman of the Civil 
Rights 
and 
Civil 
Liberties 
Sub-
committee. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, the con-
sent of the governed; no taxation with-
out representation; no conscription 
without representation; a republican 
form of government for American citi-
zens. 
All of our most essential democratic 
principles underwrite the trajectory of 
American political development, which

April 22, 2021 
has been the admission of 37 new 
States since the original 13 launched 
the Union. All of these States were ad-
mitted by one mechanism, and one 
mechanism only, an act of Congress ex-
ercising congressional power under Ar-
ticle IV, Section 3 to admit new States. 
There has never been a new State ad-
mitted by constitutional amendment. 
There has never been a State admission 
struck down by the United States Su-
preme Court, because the admission of 
new States is a political question in 
the juridical sense, which means it is 
vested exclusively in Congress to de-
cide whether or not to admit new 
States. It is an exercise of the plenary 
power and judgment of the Congress, 
the people’s branch. It is up to Con-
gress to act. 
The opponents of democracy for 
712,000 tax-paying, draftable American 
citizens right here in Washington, D.C., 
have now focused on the 23rd Amend-
ment as the basis of their opposition. 
But the 23rd Amendment is no obstacle 
in any way. The purpose of the 23rd 
Amendment was to make sure that the 
local population got to participate in 
Presidential elections. The admission 
of the new State vindicates that con-
stitutional purpose. 
H.R. 51 itself would immediately re-
peal the Federal statute that organizes 
the electoral college for the District of 
Columbia, taking care of the problem 
that our friends are concerned about. 
So why don’t they support H.R. 51? 
Well, the floor leader gave the game 
away when he said, for him, this is all 
about two new progressive, liberal 
Democrat Senators. It is all about two 
new liberal Democrat Senators. They 
don’t see taxation without representa-
tion. They don’t see military service 
without representation, when tens of 
thousands of people from the Nation’s 
Capital have served America in every 
war that we have ever had, going back 
to the Revolutionary War. They don’t 
see governance without representation, 
without the consent of the governed. 
All that they see is two new liberal 
Democrat Senators. 
But that cuts against everything 
that we believe in about American de-
mocracy. We do not deny people the 
right to vote based on our expectation 
of how they will vote. We don’t dis-
enfranchise people because we disagree 
with who they might elect. 
I would defend with my life the right 
of the people of Kentucky and Arizona 
to send my friends here to represent 
them, even though I disagree with 
most of what they stand for, including 
their rejection of the rights of people 
from Washington, D.C. I would never 
disenfranchise just because of that. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield an addi-
tional 30 seconds to the gentleman 
from Maryland. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, the people 
of Washington came to our aid on Jan-
uary 6. When we were being attacked 
by violent Fascist insurrectionists in 
this body, in this Chamber, in this Con-
gress, they came to our aid. They sent 
hundreds of Capitol Police officers and 
National Guardsmen to defend us. 
The people of Washington defend our 
democratic rights. 
Will we defend theirs? 
That is the question of H.R. 51. Let’s 
pass statehood for the people of Wash-
ington. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. ROY). 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, my friend 
from Maryland makes an excellent 
closing case in court, because he knows 
that this is going to be in court, be-
cause he knows that this is constitu-
tionally infirm. He is trying to make 
the case that is going to have to be 
made in court on the losing side of the 
argument, because it is very clearly 
unconstitutional to add D.C. as a State 
by statute. 
And what we have here today is a 
simple question: Does anybody in this 
room believe that if Lubbock, Texas, 
had been set up as the Capital seat of 
the United States of America, that my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
would be arguing to give it the position 
of statehood? 
No, of course not. 
This city was set up by the Founders 
to be the Capital seat of the United 
States of America. It was not set up to 
be a State. And when my friend said 
that every other State has been added 
by statute, none of those have been 
specifically set up as the Capital seat 
of the United States of America. 
This should be rejected. It is uncon-
stitutional. D.C. has never been a 
State. It shouldn’t be a State, and it is 
not going to be a State. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Illinois 
(Mr. 
DANNY K. DAVIS). 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
yielding to me. I also want to commend 
her for her outstanding leadership of 
her committee. I also want to take a 
moment to commend my colleague who 
has been championing D.C. statehood 
before I even came to Congress. 
You know, I have listened intently to 
all of the arguments, and it always 
gets back to one: How are the people in 
D.C. more likely to vote? Are they are 
going to vote more likely Democratic? 
Are they going to vote for Democrats? 
Well, let me tell you, I have got peo-
ple in my district who vote Republican. 
Can you imagine that? They vote Re-
publican. But we don’t deny them the 
right to vote, and we don’t deny them 
the right to representation. 
All that we are seeking and all that 
we are asking for is simply the prin-
ciple of no taxation without represen-
tation. I think we learned that in 
grammar school when we took U.S. his-
tory, when we first learned how great 
this country is and how great it can be. 
I look forward to the people of Wash-
ington, D.C., having all rights of citi-
zenship as a member of a State, voting 
in the greatest State in the country 
when it becomes one, Washington, D.C. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. KELLER). 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, in 1964, 
then-Attorney General Robert F. Ken-
nedy summed it up best as to why the 
Framers put the Capital outside the 
borders or control of any State: ‘‘It was 
indispensably necessary to the inde-
pendence and the very existence of the 
new Federal Government to have a seat 
of government which was not subject 
to the jurisdiction or control of any 
State.’’ 
As true as that was when this was 
said, as true as that was when the Cap-
ital was moved here, it is that true 
today. 
My colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle, I am glad they remember his-
tory. When the seat of the Federal Gov-
ernment was in New York City and in 
Philadelphia, the birthplace of Amer-
ica, they didn’t want it in the control 
of a State. Therefore, the District of 
Columbia was created, under the con-
trol of the United States Congress, be-
cause that is who should be deter-
mining what happens for the 50 States. 
Our colleagues on the other side want 
to change an amendment to the Con-
stitution with law. 
What about other amendments to the 
Constitution and how they read those? 
Will they try to change those with law? 
This is not about taxation without 
representation. This is about a Demo-
crat power grab, and let’s call it what 
it is. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. 
JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, in 
the Judiciary Committee right now, we 
are holding hearings to fight against 
the scourge of voter suppression and 
the unfortunate abolishment of section 
5 by the Shelby case. I heard shouts of 
hallelujah when that case was abol-
ished. The reason is because we are 
here today denying citizens of the 
United States the right to be rep-
resented fairly in the United States 
Congress. 
The 23rd Amendment? 
Well, I can cite for you the 14th 
Amendment and the 15th Amendment, 
not depriving people of their liberty 
and their justice. 
What about those soldiers who shed 
blood from the District of Columbia? 
What about those who are paying taxes 
from the District of Columbia? What 
about the very citizens who work to 
move the engine of government living 
in the District of Columbia? 
My friends know that the Capitol 
will be separated. My friends under-
stand that there is a basic constitu-
tional unfairness when you deny people 
the right to vote. 
I wonder whether or not the problem 
is that, when I first arrived here many 
years ago, it was called chocolate city.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2075 
April 22, 2021 
Let us not make this a racial issue. 
Let us make this a justice issue, a con-
stitutional issue. It is important, Mr. 
Speaker. Vote for this legislation, for 
the 51st State. 
Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the 
Committee on the Judiciary, as an original co-
sponsor of the legislation, I rise in strong and 
enthusiastic support of H.R. 51, the Wash-
ington, D.C. Admission Act,’’ which declares 
the State of Washington, Douglass Common-
wealth, to be a State of the United States of 
America, and declares its admission into the 
Union on an equal footing with the other 
States in all respects whatsoever. 
In passing this legislation, we remove a 
stain that has blighted our nation for more 
than 200 years. 
Today, we vote to end two centuries of 
shame and correct an injustice to the citizens 
of the District of Columbia. 
Mr. Speaker, let us not lose sight of one in-
disputable and shameful fact: nearly 500,000 
people living in the District of Columbia lack 
direct voting representation in the House of 
Representatives and Senate. 
Specifically, the citizens of the District of 
Columbia pay more in federal taxes than 22 
states and pay more in federal taxes per cap-
ita than any state. 
The 
District 
of 
Columbia’s 
population 
(705,000) is larger than the populations of Wy-
oming and Vermont, and seven states had 
populations under one million in the last cen-
sus. 
The District of Columbia’s annual budget 
($15.5 billion) is larger than the budgets of 14 
states. 
The District of Columbia has a higher per 
capita personal income and gross domestic 
product than any state. 
District of Columbia residents have fought 
and died in every American war, including the 
Revolution itself, and almost 200,000 District 
residents have served in the military since 
World War I alone. 
Approximately 30,000 veterans live in the 
District of Columbia, and it should be noted 
that during the Vietnam War, 243 District resi-
dents were casualties of war, a casualty figure 
greater than that observed by 10 different 
states. 
So, Mr. Speaker, it is undisputable that resi-
dents of the District of Columbia serve in the 
military, pay billions of dollars in federal taxes 
each year, and assume other responsibilities 
of U.S. citizenship. 
But for over 200 years, the District of Co-
lumbia has been denied voting representation 
in Congress—the entity that has ultimate au-
thority over all aspects of the city’s legislative, 
executive, and judicial functions. 
Mr. Speaker, if a person can be called upon 
to pay federal taxes and serve in the armed 
forces of the United States, then he or she 
should at least have the opportunity to vote for 
a representative who could at least cast a 
symbolic vote in this chamber on critical mat-
ters facing our nation. 
Issues like war and peace, equality, and jus-
tice. 
And tear-gassing peaceful protestors in La-
fayette Square exercising their First Amend-
ment rights. 
Mr. Speaker, taxation without representation 
is tyranny. 
H.R. 51 would create a state from essen-
tially the eight hometown wards of the District 
of Columbia and provides that the new state 
would be equal to the other 50 states in all re-
spects, and that the residents of the State of 
Washington, D.C. would have all the rights of 
statehood, including voting representation in 
Congress and full local self-government 
Under the legislation this new state would 
have no jurisdiction over the reduced federal 
district, which would consist of the area that 
Members of Congress and visitors associate 
with the capital of our country: the U.S. Cap-
itol, the U.S. Supreme Court, the White 
House, the principal federal monuments, and 
the federal buildings and grounds adjacent to 
the National Mall and the U.S. Capitol. 
It is unconscionable that more than a half 
million American citizens are being uncon-
scionably denied a vote and a voice in the 
most important legislative body in the world. 
As a supporter of freedom, democracy, and 
equality, I believe that it is long overdue for 
the citizens of the District of Columbia to have 
representation in the House and the Senate to 
advocate for their interests on vital matters 
coming before the Congress of the United 
States. 
Mr. Speaker, it is wrong that we must be re-
minded daily by license plates in the District of 
Columbia that ‘‘Taxation without representa-
tion is tyranny.’’ 
The people in Boston felt so strongly about 
this in 1775 that they rebelled in Boston Har-
bor, launching the ‘‘Boston Tea Party.’’ 
The principle that political authority derives 
from the consent of the government is no less 
applicable when it comes to the District of Co-
lumbia. 
Let us be clear, there is no dispute that hun-
dreds of thousands of American citizens re-
side in the District of Columbia. 
We all agree that universal suffrage is the 
hallmark of a democratic regime, of which the 
United States is the world’s leading exemplar. 
None of us believes it is fair that citizens of 
the District of Columbia pay federal taxes, risk 
life and limb fighting wars abroad to protect 
American democracy and extend the blessings 
of liberty to people living in foreign lands. 
In short, there is no moral reason to deny 
the citizens of the District of Columbia admis-
sion as a state in the United States and the 
right to full representation in Congress. 
The only question is whether Congress has 
the will and the constitutional authority to do 
so. 
Congress has always had the constitutional 
authority but for much of the last 200 years, it 
has not had the will. 
Let us change that, beginning today with our 
vote to pass H.R. 51, the Washington, D.C. 
Admission Act. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Wis-
consin (Mr. GROTHMAN). 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, D.C. 
statehood is a ridiculous idea, which 
would have shocked our forefathers. It 
is a government city. It has no—or 
minimum manufacturing, agriculture 
or natural resources. With all its gov-
ernment jobs and universities, it is a 
recession-proof city and should be one 
of the easiest cities in the Nation to 
govern. 
Let’s see how the current elected of-
ficials are doing. 
This is the second highest spending 
area in the country per pupil. 
How do they do? 
Tied for worst in fourth grade read-
ing scores, worst in the country in 
eighth grade reading scores, worst in 
the country in fourth grade writing 
scores, worst in the country in eighth 
grade writing scores, and second worst 
in the country in eighth grade math. 
They have more homeless here than 
29 States. Of the cities with at least 
600,000 people, it has the sixth highest 
murder rate. And if it were to become 
a State, it would immediately become 
the State with the highest murder rate 
in the country. 
Right now, by comparison, only 49 
percent of the parents of newborn chil-
dren in the District of Columbia are 
married. By comparison, again, the 
great foreign capital, Taipei, 96 percent 
of the parents are married. 
This is a government city, and it 
would do a horrible job as a State. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, under the Admissions 
Clause of the Constitution, Congress 
has the authority to admit new States. 
That is why all 37 new States have 
been admitted by simple legislation. 
No State has ever been admitted by a 
constitutional amendment. 
The Republicans want D.C. to use an 
admissions process that has never been 
used in the history of this country. 
The District Clause of the Constitu-
tion gives Congress authority over the 
Federal District and establishes a max-
imum size of the Federal District, 100 
square miles. It does not establish a 
minimum size. 
H.R. 51 would maintain a 2-square 
mile Federal District. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute 
to 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
South Carolina (Ms. MACE). 
Ms. MACE. Mr. Speaker, I have seen 
more damage done in the first 100 days 
of this administration than I thought 
possible in 4 years. Rather than unity, 
it has been division. Rather than work-
ing together, it has been partisanship. 
We are hearing even today in the 
comments that we are trying to stoke 
racial division in this country. This is 
nothing but a naked power play today. 
That is all this is about. 
People who can’t get their radical 
agenda passed under the system our 
Framers set up now want to blow it up. 
This is nothing but ideological ter-
rorism by those willing to completely 
ignore our Constitution and system of 
government. 
Whether it is attacks on the First, 
Second or Fourth Amendment, or turn-
ing our Federal seat of government 
over to two more far-left Senators, 
they simply do not care. They want 
what they want. 
This is not about a balance of power. 
This is about more power. This is about 
government-run healthcare; a $93 tril-
lion Green New Deal; packing the Su-
preme Court; higher taxes; and a big-
ger, less efficient form of government.

H2076

b 1000 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. 
SCHAKOWSKY), the senior chief deputy 
whip. 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in strong support of ending the dis-
enfranchisement of over 700,000 people, 
including most of the staff that works 
for us every single day. 
Our Nation is the only democratic 
country in the world that denies full 
democratic rights to the citizens living 
in its Nation’s Capital. That is more 
than 700,000 American citizens who pay 
Federal taxes, who fight and die in 
wars, who serve on our juries, and yet 
have no vote in the Senate or the 
House of Representatives. That is the 
definition of taxation without rep-
resentation. 
It is 219 years overdue for the citizens 
of the District of Columbia to have 
their right to vote. 
Let me thank and commend my col-
league, ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON, for 
all of her decades of work. It is time to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on statehood for the Dis-
trict of Columbia. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. FALLON). 
Mr. FALLON. Mr. Speaker, making 
D.C. a city-state is unconstitutional, it 
is impractical, and it flies in the face 
of the Founders’ intent. James Madi-
son said it himself in the Federalist 
Papers. Unfortunately, our colleagues 
across the aisle are trying to make this 
about race. I thought that was inevi-
table. It is sad and unfortunate. 
But let’s look at data. In 1800, this 
city was a White majority, 10,600 and 
4,000 African-American residents. Then 
150 years later, in 1950, 517,000 White 
residents to 280,000 African-American 
residents. For 150 years, this was a 
White-majority city, and there was no 
serious effort to make it a State. 
But there is a way we can solve this 
issue because one core argument is a 
pretty good one, no taxation without 
representation. It is flawed because 
there is local government, and they 
have a Delegate here. But with ret-
rocession, putting Washington back 
into Maryland, that would give them 
that added seat and would address that 
very issue. The GOP is acting in good 
faith because we know that that seat 
will be a Democratic seat, but it is the 
right thing to do. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the 
distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
Maryland (Mr. HOYER), a champion for 
equality and the 51st State and House 
majority leader. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
very strong support of this legislation. 
I want to just briefly respond to the 
remarks of the gentleman who pre-
ceded me about retrocession. Retroces-
sion is an interesting idea that my Re-
publican colleagues have. It has to do 
with the issue of two United States 
Senators. One could say that has to do 
with both sides of the aisle, two United 
States Senators. 
The history of adding States has been 
a history where focus is on those two 
United States Senators that would be 
added, and the party that wanted them 
and the party that didn’t want them. 
But retrocession, frankly, is an inter-
esting idea, except for the fact the gen-
tleman talked about the Founding Fa-
thers and James Madison and the Fed-
eralist Papers. 
One of the articles of debate was, if 
you had a State, i.e. Maryland, whose 
land, of course, the Federal city is lo-
cated on—Virginia gave some, but they 
took it back—you would have a State 
surrounding the Federal enclave. No 
difference, except for it would be Mary-
land and not Washington, Douglass 
Commonwealth. 
So 
that 
argument 
limps. It fails because you are sug-
gesting the same thing that some have 
said is of concern to them. So the only 
difference is two Senators. 
So this is about politics. Throughout 
history people have guessed as to what 
the new States are going to be. Now 
some knew absolutely. We have North 
and South Dakota. I don’t know wheth-
er any of you know why we have North 
and South Dakota; two Senators versus 
four Senators. And the Republicans 
who were in charge wanted to have 
four Senators to assure their majority 
in the Senate as opposed to the Demo-
crats in the South. Ironic how things 
change. 
So if you are voting on politics, I get 
it. But on principle, Nevada was added 
and taken from Utah, by the way, be-
cause the Republicans who were then 
in charge back in the day wanted to 
have two additional Senators. And 
they got them, with less than 10,000 
people living in the area that was 
taken from Utah, Wyoming, and Colo-
rado, and formed Nevada. 
So let’s not get mired in these prin-
cipled votes, because this is about two 
Senators. We get it. It is not about 
principle because there are over 700,000 
people—712,000, to be exact, maybe 
more when we get the Census report— 
who are unequal citizens in America. 
I want to thank the incomparable 
ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON for her hard 
work and tireless advocacy for so many 
years as the leader of this cause on be-
half of equal rights for the citizens she 
represents without a vote. Why, are 
they lesser citizens? Is she a lesser 
Representative? Surely not. 
If a President of the United States, 
Republican or Democrat, asked some-
body to come to the District of Colum-
bia and work for the U.S. Government, 
bring your talents, your energy, and 
your focus to work for your country in 
Washington, D.C., but, oh, by the way, 
you have to give up your vote in the 
Congress of the United States through 
your Representative. In no other de-
mocracy are residents of the National 
Capital excluded from representation. 
None. 
Frankly, I think the Founders had no 
concept of how big this city would be-
come, how vibrant it would become. 
None. Yet, nearly 700,000 Americans are 
denied full representation. 
The Founders of our Union of States 
set forth a simple process for the ad-
mission of new States to that Union. 
They believed, the 13 of them, that add-
ing new States would be positive for 
the country and that they would want 
people represented in the territories in 
the Congress when they became States 
and qualified to be such. They saw that 
process of expansion as both healthy 
and workable, and they believed that it 
would strengthen our democracy. 
Through the years, however, the ad-
mission of new States has been a very 
contentious process on both sides of 
the aisle. And there was a time in our 
history in the latter half of the 19th 
century when Republicans affected the 
admission of a number of new States in 
order to increase the numbers in the 
Senate. They accomplished that objec-
tive in some respects. 
In one noteworthy example, which I 
have just mentioned, Nevada in 1864, 
less than 10,000 people. The criteria at 
that point in time, theoretically, was 
60,000, but it was ignored. It was ig-
nored. Two Senators. That is what this 
issue is about. Two Senators. 
It is not about whether, on a prin-
cipled basis, we ought to give to 712,000 
of our citizens the right to be equally 
represented in the Congress of the 
United States. No, if they live here, we 
ask them to give up that right. 
That same process, as I mentioned, 
was repeated in the admission of North 
and South Dakota. They had hardly 
any people living there. They could 
hardly qualify if you put all of the Da-
kota territory together. But what the 
Republicans did was—they were in 
charge at that point in time—they di-
vided it, North and South Dakota. 
What happened? Two extra Senators. It 
wasn’t about principle, about how 
many people, what the economic status 
was. It was about how many Senators. 
My friends across the aisle complain 
that this bill would lead to the election 
of two additional Democratic Senators. 
So what? 
Is that the criteria, the political 
judgment of the citizens of some entity 
seeking to become a State? There is 
nothing in the Constitution about that. 
Zero. It is the politics of it. I get it. 
But it is not the principle. 
I hope people vote on principle, that 
they believe that their fellow citizens 
who happen to live within this, what 
used to be a square, but a square minus 
that to the south of the Potomac. 
This legislation is very different than 
the acts that admitted those States in 
the 19th century. It is different because 
it is based on the demonstrable need to 
provide representation to hundreds of 
thousands of Americans who deserve to 
have their voices heard in our democ-
racy. And they have determined they 
want to be a part. 
Our Founders were offended, indeed 
outraged that they were forced to pay 
taxes, but were afforded no representa-
tion in the body that set those taxes.

April 22, 2021 
Wouldn’t all of us have been there at 
the Tea Party saying, ‘‘You cannot tax 
us, England, without us having rep-
resentation in the Parliament’’? 
I am sure you have heard the argu-
ment from many people on this floor— 
I won’t repeat them—about the level of 
taxation that is paid by the citizens of 
the District of Columbia. But they 
have no say in the level of those taxes 
which so outraged our Founders. 
Moreover, this legislation would end 
the unjust practice of treating D.C. 
residents differently than their fellow 
citizens in the 50 States when it comes 
to allocating resources or providing 
COVID–19 relief under the CARES Act 
last year. 
Mr. Speaker, when President Eisen-
hower—a Republican President, but 
not a very partisan President, unlike 
today, where we have seen a very par-
tisan President, no longer there—ad-
dressed the question of admitting Ha-
waii as a State in the 1950s, he said the 
following—and by the way, I think all 
of you probably know that when Alas-
ka and Hawaii were admitted not too 
far apart in time, Alaska was perceived 
to be a Democratic State and Hawaii 
was perceived to be a Republican State. 
So the assumption that somehow the 
District of Columbia will automati-
cally elect two Democrats—which may 
be accurate, but it may not always be 
the case—the principle is what Eisen-
hower articulated, and he said this: 
You have an economy that is self-sup-
porting. There is a large population, and I 
would like to see the case handled clearly 
and specifically on its merits. 
By that metric, Washington, D.C., 
earned its right to statehood a long 
time ago. And today, we can take a 
major step toward that goal when we 
pass this bill, which we passed last 
Congress as well. 
As to retrocession, again, I wonder if 
Nevada would like to be back to Utah 
or to Wyoming or to Colorado or 
whether Wyoming, that has 200,000 less 
citizens approximately than the Dis-
trict of Columbia, would like to be sub-
sumed by one of the surrounding 
States because of the few numbers? 
Vermont as well, which was taken from 
another State, as was West Virginia, 
which was part of Virginia. 
b 1015 
I hope the Senate will then take up 
this bill when we pass it and consider 
the question of D.C. statehood on its 
merits, not on politics. Maybe that is 
too much to ask. 
This is not a partisan math problem 
or electoral prediction, which, as we 
have seen, may or may not come to 
pass. But on the merits alone, on the 
conviction that taxation without rep-
resentation is not fair now as it was 
not fair in 1776, the people of this city, 
our Nation’s Capital, deserve full and 
equal representation in Congress. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope that this bill will 
pass with bipartisan support. It is 
going to pass, but I hope we have some 
bipartisan support based upon the prin-
ciple that every citizen in our country 
ought to enjoy the same representation 
in the Congress of the United States as 
every other citizen. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
I must admit, I am a little dis-
appointed in the remarks of the major-
ity leader. When I saw him approach 
the podium, I thought he was going to 
give us a detailed explanation as to 
why he voted against this very bill in 
1993. Instead, he lectures us on having 
the exact same position today that he 
had in 1993. Hypocrisy runs deep. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. HIG-
GINS). 
Mr. 
HIGGINS 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, how is this unconstitutional? 
H.R. 51 violates our Founders’ intent, 
the actual writ of the Constitution, the 
land itself, which should rightfully be 
returned to Maryland if its original 
purpose as land for our Nation’s Cap-
ital is discarded by Congress and, fi-
nally, the required repeal of the 23rd 
Amendment. 
I have explained these constitutional 
barriers for 2 years in committee, but 
there is more. 
D.C. does not perform many of the 
roles of a true State. A prime example, 
unlike every other State in the Union, 
D.C. is not responsible for its prison 
system. 
About 8,000 D.C. residents are in-
mates in Federal prisons, and the Fed-
eral Government absorbs the huge ex-
pense. These are inmates who would 
normally be in a State prison, but D.C. 
only has the capacity to house inmates 
awaiting trial. 
Three times in committee, I have of-
fered an amendment that would trans-
fer this normal State responsibility to 
D.C. My amendment was rejected by 
Democrats three times. 
So, let’s look at how D.C. has han-
dled their inmates awaiting trial. Ac-
cording to The Washington Post, D.C. 
is essentially torturing these inmates 
with what experts say is mass solitary 
confinement, 23 hours a day of solitary 
for every D.C. inmate ongoing for over 
400 days. 
That is certainly a violation of the 
Eighth Amendment. These are human 
beings 
awaiting 
final 
adjudication. 
Many will ultimately be found not 
guilty, yet they have been held in soli-
tary confinement for 23 hours every 
day for over a year. 
Is this what we can expect from a 
D.C. State? 
D.C. is our Nation’s Capital, was in-
tended to be our Nation’s Capital, and 
must remain our Nation’s Capital. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, how much time re-
mains on each side? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from New York has 81⁄2 min-
utes remaining. The gentleman from 
Kentucky has 16 minutes remaining. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. SESSIONS). 
(Mr. SESSIONS asked and was given 
permission to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in opposition to H.R. 51, the 
Washington, D.C. Admissions Act. 
In many respects, America seems to 
be at the same point we were in the 
1930s and 1940s—calling for a single 
party rule from Washington, D.C. 
Supreme Court Justice Louis Bran-
deis observed at that time: ‘‘The great-
est dangers to liberty lurk in insidious 
encroachments by men of zeal, well- 
meaning but without understanding.’’ 
These words of wisdom might also 
offer some inspiration to us here today: 
‘‘Whenever a people or an institution 
forgets its hard beginnings, it is begin-
ning to decay’’ by Carl Sandberg. 
Mr. Speaker, both of these sayings 
are on the halls of our Capitol. 
Addressing people’s ability to vote is 
important. Addressing a party’s desire 
for singular political control of a Na-
tion is another matter. 
Our Constitution outlines the process 
for admitting new States to the Union 
and rules regarding the formation of 
the District of Columbia. 
In 1961, 36 States voted to ratify the 
23rd Amendment to the Constitution, 
ensuring that the District of Columbia 
had representation and taxation. That 
was done out of fairness. These 36 
States did this out of fairness. 
We have already heard what the At-
torney General Robert Kennedy said, 
but, Mr. Speaker, today we are doing 
the inconceivable and will produce the 
absurdity. 
Legislation does not overrule a con-
stitutional amendment. Legislation is 
subject to the Constitution and all of 
its amendments. 
If you want to make D.C. a State, 
have a process that overturns the 23rd 
Amendment and then ratify a 29th 
Amendment, which then repeals the 
23rd Amendment. 
There is precedent. The 18th Amendment 
was repealed by the 21st Amendment to end 
Prohibition. On February 20, 1933, Congress 
passed the repealing Amendment. On Decem-
ber 5, 1933, the proper number of States rati-
fied the Amendment, and the 18th Amend-
ment ceased to exist. 
This was done by this country during 
prohibition. This is the standard by 
which we take care of the Constitution 
and the amendments thereon. 
Our system of government is predict-
able on the rule of law and following 
procedure, but today’s bill abandons 
that procedure of amendments to the 
Constitution in favor of politics. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from Texas (Mr. GREEN), 
the chair of the Financial Services 
Subcommittee on Oversight and Inves-
tigation. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
and still I rise. And today, I rise with 
love of country at heart.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2078 
April 22, 2021 
I rise to announce that I will not 
allow this issue to become so com-
plicated that the American people 
might be confused because the truth is 
we will be voting for one thing: wheth-
er we are for taxation without rep-
resentation or whether we are against 
taxation without representation. It is 
really that simple. 
As for me, I will be voting with the 
patriots. I will be voting with those pa-
triots from 1773 who confronted the 
government, those patriots who were 
there at the Boston Harbor, those pa-
triots who were there for the Boston 
Tea Party. 
I will be voting against taxation 
without representation. I believe that 
this is what the American Constitution 
and the American way are all about. 
Since 1773, it has been said, and today, 
I will respect it with my vote. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. PFLUGER). 
Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to this unconstitutional 
measure. 
Our Founders debated the merits of 
statehood and a Federal District and 
rightly concluded that no State should 
have supremacy over others and enjoy 
considerable benefits and influence of 
also being our national headquarters. 
Our Founders got it right. This meas-
ure gets it wrong. 
If D.C. surrenders the special status 
of our Federal District and instead be-
comes one of 51 equals, why should it 
enjoy all the benefits of also being the 
Federal 
District? 
Perhaps 
Federal 
agencies like the Department of En-
ergy or USDA should move to places 
like west Texas, where we actually 
produce food and fuel for the Nation 
and beyond. 
Ambitions on the political left to ex-
pand the Supreme Court and U.S. Sen-
ate seats, eliminate the filibuster, and 
keep three electoral votes for occu-
pants of the White House, all while 
controlling our election law are about 
one thing: more power for them. 
Oppose this unconstitutional meas-
ure. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
The gentleman describes this, as 
many on the other side, as a political 
issue, a power grab. He cites all these 
other political actions, but the real 
power grab is denying 712,000 taxpaying 
American citizens the right to vote. 
That is the power grab. 
This isn’t about politics. It is a fun-
damental voting and civil rights issue. 
And it is outrageous that Republicans 
would play partisan politics just to 
block 712,000 Americans from having 
full equality in our democracy. 
Every American deserves a voice in 
their government, not taxation with-
out representation, fundamental be-
liefs in our democracy. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Virginia 
(Mr. GOOD). 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
I rise in opposition to this latest at-
tempt by the Democrats to increase 
their power at the expense of long-
standing American traditions and the 
Constitution. 
Sadly, this is not at all surprising. 
Democrats have made it clear that 
American institutions don’t stand in 
their way of advancing their political 
agenda at all costs. They want to pack 
the Supreme Court, eliminate election 
integrity, defund our police, keep our 
borders open, and prohibit debate in 
this very House. And D.C. statehood is 
just the next step. 
This legislation is an unconstitu-
tional power grab designed to give 
Democrats more votes to pass their 
radical socialist agenda. 
As the majority leader just said, this 
is about two Senators. It is not about 
principle. 
The District of Columbia has served 
as the Federal district for over 200 
years. The Framers understood the im-
portance of Federal and State govern-
ments having separate authority and 
recognized that States would be ill- 
suited to house a Federal Government. 
And this was long before the Demo-
crats started making everything about 
race. 
Now, Democrats want to disregard 
the Founders’ vision, again, in order to 
grab two more votes in the Senate. Po-
litical advantage is no justification for 
policy that disregards precedent and 
the Constitution. Therefore, I oppose 
this bill. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes 
to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. 
BEYER), the chair of the Joint Eco-
nomic Committee. 
Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of H.R. 51 and D.C. 
statehood. 
My mother and father met at D.C.’s 
Western High School in the 1940s before 
my father went off to West Point and 
Korea. I was raised in the Potomac 
Palisades of Washington and went to 
high school a few blocks from the Cap-
itol. My grandchildren are fifth-genera-
tion Washingtonians. 
Through the generations, we have 
been confounded and confused that the 
United States citizens who live in the 
District of Columbia have been denied 
self-rule. 
The right to self-determination is the 
defining principle on which this Nation 
was founded. Yet, this very right is de-
nied to those who reside in our Na-
tion’s Capital. 
Taxation 
without 
representation 
sparked our own war of independence 
from Great Britain. Today, the same 
cry for democracy, impressed on every 
D.C. license plate, calls out for the 
peaceful passage of H.R. 51. 
The American citizens of the District 
of Columbia overwhelmingly support 
statehood, passing a statehood ref-
erendum with 85 percent support in 
2016. 
My Republican statehood opponents 
argue that statehood should be denied 
D.C. because it is too small; because it 
is not rural enough; because it has in-
sufficient logging, manufacturing, ag-
riculture, and mining; because it is not 
well-rounded; and because its residents 
are not real Americans. D.C. does, by 
the way, have a Tesla car dealership. 
The 
real 
reason 
my 
Republican 
friends oppose statehood is that they 
disagree with the political views of to-
day’s Washingtonians. This is terrible 
short-term 
thinking. 
Texas 
voted 
Democratic for generations, while Cali-
fornia and New York have elected 
many Republican Governors and Sen-
ators. Political pendulums swing both 
ways. 
This view betrays our democratic 
principles upon which our Nation was 
founded. 
b 1030 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from South 
Dakota (Mr. JOHNSON). 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. 
Speaker, I am opposed to D.C. state-
hood, but I am not opposed to suffrage. 
If your goal is truly suffrage rather 
than increasing Democratic control of 
the Senate, boy, do I have a plan for 
you. 
My bill would reunite the residential 
areas of the District with Maryland, as 
was done with Virginia in 1847. This 
plan would give full voting rights that 
we have heard so much about this 
morning without ignoring the Con-
stitution or the practical realities of 
what constitutes a State. 
So I say to my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle: If your goal is 
truly suffrage, then let’s do this to-
gether. Let’s set aside the divisive 
rhetoric we have heard, and work to-
gether to craft an appropriate and bi-
partisan solution to give representa-
tion to the people of D.C. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. GOHMERT). 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, it was 
good to hear the majority leader say 
this is about politics. We knew that. 
But for some of us, it is about prin-
ciple. 
And if it were about taxation without 
representation, I would have a slew of 
Democrats cosponsoring the bill I have 
been filing for many terms to elimi-
nate Federal income tax in the District 
of Columbia. 
But I was told years ago: We are not 
going to join in with your bill because 
it will weaken our chance to get a rep-
resentative full voting for D.C. 
That is what this has been about. 
Mr. Speaker, for some of us, principle 
is a big deal. When the Bush Justice 
Department was violating constitu-
tional rights, some Republicans got fu-
rious. When the Obama administration 
did that, they circled the wagons and

protected. This is about principle for 
some of us. 
Mr. Speaker, we got a tiny taste 
when the Mayor of D.C., of an opposite 
party of President Trump, wasn’t sure 
she was going to provide the police to 
protect the White House. 
This is about the Constitution and 
principle. Vote against this. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how 
much time is remaining on both sides? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from New York has 5 min-
utes remaining. The gentleman from 
Kentucky has 10 minutes remaining. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. 
STEVENS), chairwoman of the Com-
mittee on Science, Space, and Tech-
nology’s Subcommittee on Research 
and Technology. 
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 51, in the es-
teemed tradition, the responsibility 
that we have as legislators of this body 
to evaluate adding a 51st State to this 
Union, to form a more perfect union; 
yes, in the tradition and in the written 
words of our Constitution because, as 
when my native Michigan became the 
26th State in 1837 added to this Union, 
the President recognized that we will 
admit Michigan on equal footing. 
But we know that the Founders and 
the originators of our beautiful Nation 
did not know a Michigan when they 
were writing our Constitution. They 
did not know a Wyoming. So we ask 
ourselves here, as the ambassadors of 
democracy, what message we send to 
the world when we deny over 700,000 
people the right to vote; when we tax 
them without the proper representa-
tion. 
This, my friends, is an exciting and 
profound and welcomed day in this 
body that deserves debate, and this leg-
islation deserves to pass. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. LAMALFA). 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I am 
amazed at the smoke and mirrors and 
fog of obfuscation surrounding the de-
bate on this bill. 
What Republicans are doing here 
today is defending the Constitution 
and what was put in place by the 
Founders, that Washington, D.C., the 
District, would not be part of a State, 
where it could be coerced or leveraged 
by a State to get things from it. 
I have just heard the last few min-
utes solutions offered to my colleagues 
that could probably be passed in 6 
weeks or less, to allow what it is they 
claim they are saying for the citizens 
of Washington, D.C. Folding those 
700,000 residents through a Maryland 
retrocession, as has happened with Vir-
ginia in 1846, would accomplish the 
goal of the same type of representation 
they are talking about. 
No, the politics is over on that side of 
the aisle because they have turned 
down a constitutional solution that 
this would be, instead, for an unconsti-
tutional one that flies in the face and 
produces a 66-square-mile State that is 
1⁄18th the size of Rhode Island, with a 
population just a little bit larger than 
the city of Fresno, California, because 
they want to accomplish a political 
goal while we defend the Constitution. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HARRIS). 
Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Speaker, I guess it 
is appropriate for someone from Mary-
land to speak on this issue because this 
is Maryland’s land we are talking 
about. This land was given for the pur-
pose of a Federal enclave by Maryland. 
How dare Congress take Maryland’s 
land from it. That is not why it was 
given. 
Mr. Speaker, let’s talk about the un-
constitutionality—well, 
you 
have 
heard about the unconstitutionality. 
We don’t need to talk about it any 
more. 
I urge everyone who is watching us 
on C–SPAN today: Go get your copy of 
the Constitution. It is written in black 
and white. This is very plain. This is 
clearly unconstitutional. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope America was 
paying attention to the majority lead-
er’s speech, that one line where he said 
‘‘this is all about politics.’’ In fact, he 
even gave the history. He said, well, in 
the past, the Republicans wanted Sen-
ators, and so and so wanted Senators. 
We don’t live in the past. We live in 
the present. 
Mr. Speaker, is this what America 
wants? Do they want pure politics? 
Not my words. That’s what the ma-
jority leader said: This is all about pol-
itics. 
Mr. Speaker, let’s ask: Why did our 
Founders do what they did? 
Every American who is watching, 
think about what you saw last sum-
mer. You saw a White House under 
siege. You saw a mob. And we know 
Members of this House have promoted 
mobs. They did it last weekend. It will 
happen again. If we put the boundary 
next to the Federal buildings, it will be 
subject to a mob, a mob controlled by 
a State, not a Federal enclave. 
That is the last thing this country 
needs, and it is the last thing the Fed-
eral Government needs. 
I see my colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle shaking their heads. 
How else would one describe that 
group outside the White House? 
It was an uncontrolled mob. Thank 
God 
that 
Federal 
troops, 
Federal 
forces, Federal law enforcement were 
allowed to be there to stop that mob. 
That is why we need the District of 
Columbia to be the Federal enclave. 
Mr. Speaker, I oppose the bill. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
JONES). 
Mr. JONES. Mr. Speaker, I have had 
enough of my colleagues’ * * * insinu-
ations that somehow the people of 
Washington, D.C., are incapable or 
even unworthy of our democracy. One 
Senate 
Republican 
said 
that 
D.C. 
wouldn’t be a ‘‘well-rounded, working- 
class State.’’ I had no idea there were 
so many syllables in the word ‘‘white.’’ 
One of my House Republican col-
leagues said that D.C. shouldn’t be a 
State because the District doesn’t have 
a landfill. * * * * 
The truth is there is no good-faith ar-
gument 
for 
disenfranchising 
over 
700,000 people, Mr. Speaker, most of 
whom are people of color. 
Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Speaker, I move 
that the gentleman’s words be taken 
down. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman’s demand is not timely. 
The gentleman from New York will 
proceed. 
Mr. JONES. Mr. Speaker, there is no 
good-faith argument. 
Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Speaker, I oppose 
the ruling of the Chair. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does the 
gentleman from New York ask unani-
mous consent to withdraw the offend-
ing words? 
Mr. JONES. Mr. Speaker, that is fine. 
You have my consent to withdraw. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the offending words are 
withdrawn. 
There was no objection. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New York is recognized. 
Mr. JONES. Mr. Speaker, the truth 
is, there is no good-faith argument for 
disenfranchising over 700,000 people, 
most of whom are people of color. 
These desperate objections are about 
fear—fear that, in D.C., their white su-
premacist politics will no longer play; 
fear that, soon enough, white suprema-
cist politics won’t work anywhere in 
America; fear that, if they don’t rig 
our democracy, they will not win. 
Today, Democrats are standing up 
for a multiracial democracy, to democ-
ratize all 51 States in this country. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 21⁄2 
minutes to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. GRIFFITH). 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Speaker, D.C. 
statehood is unconstitutional. Both 
Republican and Democrat administra-
tions of the past have long interpreted 
the Constitution in that fashion. 
One of the problems with D.C. state-
hood is that two States, Maryland and 
my home State of Virginia, gave land 
for the cede of government, and they 
did not do so with the intent to create 
a new State. 
When Virginia’s land wasn’t used for 
the cede of government, Congress ceded 
it back to Virginia. It did not create a 
new State. 
As it was then, retrocession is our 
best course of action today. Shrinking 
the seat of government, which is per-
mitted by Article I, and returning the 
rest to Maryland for the purposes of 
representation, offers D.C. residents a 
voice in the Federal legislative branch 
and keeps faith with Maryland’s origi-
nal cession of land for D.C. It also

April 22, 2021 
works within the bounds of the Con-
stitution. 
Mr. Speaker, I have introduced a bill, 
and it is later going to be a motion to 
recommit. And I have also taken great 
care, as a part of that, making sure 
that retrocession and the transfer of 
administrative functions from D.C. to 
Maryland runs as smoothly as possible. 
If you are worried about the details 
of D.C. government, this bill, this mo-
tion to recommit, takes care of them. 
As the old Prego commercials said: 
It’s in there. 
Congressional representation, it’s in 
there. 
The courts, it’s in there. 
The National Guard, it’s in there. 
Commitments to retirees, it’s in 
there. 
Tuition assistance, it’s in there. 
Preventing the remaining Federal 
District from casting the three elec-
toral votes meant for D.C., it is in 
there. 
My motion to recommit, which I will 
offer in a bit, is the most practical so-
lution to giving D.C. residents a voice 
in Congress, to give them a right to 
vote. 
Mr. Speaker, if we adopt a motion to 
recommit, we will instruct the Com-
mittee on Oversight and Reform to 
consider my amendment to H.R. 51, to 
provide for the retrocession of land to 
the State of Maryland, rather than to 
create a new State. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to include in the RECORD the text 
of the amendment immediately prior 
to the vote on the motion to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Virginia? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes 
to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. 
RASKIN), a distinguished constitutional 
scholar. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairwoman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope that our distin-
guished colleagues don’t flatter them-
selves to think that they are the first 
Members of Congress who oppose other 
Americans’ democratic rights to wrap 
their 
arguments 
in 
constitutional 
clothing, because this has actually 
been the standard in American history. 
With Texas, it was said that Texas 
could not be admitted because it would 
be unconstitutional and because it was 
its own country, and the Constitution 
nowhere gives Congress the power to 
admit a foreign republic as a State. 
It was said Hawaii and Alaska could 
not be admitted because they weren’t 
contiguous. 
West 
Virginia, 
everyone 
knew, 
couldn’t be admitted because it used to 
be part of Virginia, just like Kentucky 
was part of Virginia. 
Oklahoma, it was said, was too poor 
and, therefore, did not meet constitu-
tional requisites. 
Utah was too Mormon. 
New Mexico was too Catholic. 
And on and on and on. 
So this is very much in the main-
stream of partisan political opposition 
to vindicating the rights of American 
citizens. 
My colleague from Virginia invites 
us to say, well, just give Washington, 
D.C., back to Maryland, thereby con-
ceding, of course, that Congress has the 
power to modify the boundaries of the 
District of Columbia, as was estab-
lished in 1847, with the retrocession of 
Virginia. 
b 1045 
There is one problem with this argu-
ment, the people of Washington, D.C., 
haven’t asked to go back to Maryland, 
and Maryland has not requested that 
the land be given back to Maryland. 
Instead, what we have is American 
citizens exercising their rights under 
the Ninth Amendment to the Constitu-
tion, organizing a new State and peti-
tioning for admission to the Union. 
That is how America has grown. 
They have demonstrated their com-
mitment to our democracy by defend-
ing us against violent insurrectionists 
on January 6. Let’s show our commit-
ment to their democratic rights. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, listening to the debate, 
I wonder if our friends on the other 
side of the aisle would be so passionate 
if Washington, D.C., were 90 percent 
Republican as 90 percent Democrat. 
H.R. 51 goes against the Founding 
Fathers’ intent. It is unconstitutional, 
impractical, and a blatant power grab. 
The Founding Fathers created the 
Federal city—this Federal city—to be 
separate and apart from the States 
which it would serve as the seat of gov-
ernment. They designed it this way so 
there would be no super State that 
could unduly influence Federal affairs 
and international relations. 
Now, I understand the people of the 
District’s desire for representation in 
Congress. I think that is a legitimate 
concern, and it is not a new one. 
If Democrats truly wanted to grant 
the wishes of D.C. residents, then they 
would address the constitutional issues 
with H.R. 51 since it does not stand a 
chance in court. We all know that. This 
does not stand one chance in court. 
Additionally, Democrats could ex-
plore other options other than state-
hood, but they are not interested in 
any of them since they don’t add two 
new progressive Senators to the U.S. 
Senate. 
Serious policy proposals like ret-
rocession, allowing D.C. residents to 
vote in Maryland Federal elections, 
and most obviously, the passage of the 
constitutional amendment have been 
called for by many of my Republican 
colleagues. 
No State has required a constitu-
tional amendment to be admitted to 
the Union; not one. But D.C. is unique. 
The 23rd Amendment guarantees the 
District three electoral college votes. 
There is no precedent for granting 
statehood to a territory with electoral 
college votes or such a special place in 
our Constitution. H.R. 51 is an uncon-
stitutional bill. 
D.C. is also massively unprepared to 
assume the costs of the programs and 
benefits it receives by being the Fed-
eral seat of government. The new State 
will very likely levy a commuter tax to 
make up the funding gaps currently 
backed by the Federal taxpayers. H.R. 
51 provides no guarantee to the Amer-
ican people that they will not be on the 
hook funding the new State for years, 
if not decades. 
This bill is nothing more than an at-
tempt to ignore the constitutional 
process and gain an advantage in the 
U.S. Senate, all to advance a radical 
agenda that continues to come out of 
this House and stalls in the Senate. 
Democrats know a constitutional 
amendment granting D.C. statehood 
would be rejected, just as it has been in 
the past. H.R. 51 is intentionally de-
signed to circumvent the Constitution 
and the will of the American people. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
reject this unconstitutional and im-
practical legislation. I urge a ‘‘no’’ 
vote, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, statehood for D.C. 
is about fairness, justice, and ensuring 
that all Americans have an equal stake 
in our Republic. It is not unconstitu-
tional. It is constitutional. And this is 
not about politics. It is a fundamental 
voting and civil rights issue. 
The real wrong is denying 712,000 tax-
paying American citizens the right to 
vote. Our Nation is founded upon the 
principle that all people should have a 
voice in their government. No taxation 
without representation. But without 
voting representation in Congress, the 
people of D.C. are denied that most 
basic fundamental right. 
Today’s debate forces us to confront 
the fundamental question of who we 
are as a nation. 
Do we believe in the right to full and 
equal representation? Or are these just 
empty words? 
D.C. residents are Americans, and 
they deserve the equal rights our na-
tional ideals promise them. 
Mr. Speaker, again, I thank the out-
standing Congresswoman for her tire-
less and selfless advocacy to ensure 
that D.C. residents finally gain full 
representation that they deserve. I join 
many in thanking the leadership of the 
Democratic Caucus, Speaker NANCY 
PELOSI, Majority Leader STENY HOYER, 
and Whip JAMES CLYBURN. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote in 
favor of this critical civil rights bill, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of H.R. 51, the Washington, 
D.C. Admission Act. I thank Delegate ELEANOR 
HOLMES NORTON for her tireless campaign for 
full democratic representation for the residents 
of our nation’s capital. Without her leadership 
and grassroots advocacy, it is hard to believe

that we would be on the floor today consid-
ering D.C. statehood again. I also want to 
thank Chairwoman MALONEY and the Speaker 
for working to get this bill to the floor. 
The 
late 
Hilda 
Mason, 
former 
D.C. 
councilmember, a giant in D.C. politics, and 
impassioned champion for the disadvantaged 
brought me into the fight for D.C. statehood. 
Her courage and steadfast determination to 
ensure D.C. residents have full democratic 
representation should be an inspiration to us 
all. 
The revolution that led to the creation of our 
democracy began with calls of ‘‘No taxation 
without representation’’ and yet we have over 
700,000 people—taxpayers—nearly half of 
whom 
are 
African 
American—routinely 
disenfranchised. 
Historically, the District of Colombia has 
been home to one of the largest African Amer-
ican populations in the nation. After Emanci-
pation, thousands of African Americans mi-
grated from the segregated South to benefit 
from better employment opportunities, better 
educational institution, and more access to 
civic and political life. 
It is a disgrace that the District, a symbol of 
our nation’s promise of equality, is denied the 
right to self-government and full representation 
in Congress. 
To correct this injustice, we must pass H.R. 
51. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 330, the pre-
vious question is ordered on the bill, as 
amended. 
The question is on the engrossment 
and third reading of the bill. 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
and read a third time, and was read the 
third time. 
MOTION TO RECOMMIT

sight and Reform.

MOMENT 
OF 
SILENCE 
RECOG-
NIZING THE PASSING OF THE 
HONORABLE ELIZABETH FURSE 
(Ms. BONAMICI asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. BONAMICI. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today, joined by my colleagues 
from the Oregon congressional delega-
tion and others, to announce the pass-
ing of our esteemed former colleague, 
Congresswoman Elizabeth Furse, who 
represented the First District of Or-
egon—the district I am honored to rep-
resent—from 1993 to 1999. 
Congresswoman Furse was not only a 
friend, but a mentor. My first experi-
ence volunteering for a political cam-
paign was during her reelection in 1994. 
She inspired dedication to worthy 
causes, including cofounding the Or-
egon Peace Institute. She embodied the 
traits public servants should strive to 
uphold, to meet the needs of their com-
munity and drive meaningful change. 
Our world, especially northwest Or-
egon, is a better place because of Eliza-
beth’s tireless devotion to improving 
the lives of those around her. 
On behalf of the Oregon delegation 
and all who served with Elizabeth and 
all who are present, I express our sin-
cere condolences to her family and 
friends. I ask that the House observe a 
moment of silence in her memory. 
f 
MAKING AMERICAN LIVES BETTER 
(Mr. MALINOWSKI asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Madam Speaker, 
it is good to be able to stand on the 
House floor and speak, not about the 
crisis of the day or even my hopes for 
tomorrow, but about something this 
Congress has delivered to make peo-
ple’s lives better. 
When I first ran for this job, the 
number one demand I heard from vot-
ers was to make healthcare more ac-
cessible and the Affordable Care Act 
more affordable. With the American 
Rescue Plan, that is what we have done 
in a major way. 
By increasing ACA subsidies and cap-
ping premiums, we are enabling the 
typical middle-class family with mar-
ketplace coverage to save hundreds of 
dollars a month. A 60-year-old couple 
making $75,000 a year will save almost 
$1,400 a month. That is life-changing. 
Now we just have to make this per-
manent; to keep the promise that no 
American should be crushed by the 
cost of their healthcare; and to give 
people hope that, if they continue to 
vote for better government, they will 
continue to get it. 
f 
HONORING LUIS PALAU 
(Mr. CLOUD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLOUD. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Luis Palau, a minister 
and evangelist from Argentina, who 
eventually called the United States 
home. 
Luis Palau passed away on March 11, 
2021, leaving behind a legacy of faith, 
hope, and love. 
His work as a passionate representa-
tive for Christ, and one of the most in-
fluential international evangelists in 
history, earned him the nickname of 
the ‘‘Billy Graham of Latin America.’’ 
He shared with Graham the conviction 
to make disciples of all nations, as 
Scripture commands. 
His 
home 
country 
of 
Argentina, 
much of the Spanish-speaking world, 
and the United States came to know 
and respect him because of his faithful 
preaching, evangelism, and work to 
unite Christians and reach all peoples 
of all backgrounds. 
With a career that spanned over a 
half a century, he shared the good news 
of the Gospel of Jesus Christ with mil-
lions of people throughout television, 
radio, print, and live events. His plat-
form enabled him to speak with and in-
fluence many political and military 
leaders. 
In spite of all that, he once said: 
‘‘I’ve never thought of myself as some-
one special. I’m just a kid from a cow 
town in Argentina. Yet God grabbed 
my heart at a young age and chose to 
use me to share His good news.’’ 
One of his favorite Scriptures, which 
also begins the movie about his life, is 
James 4:10, which says: ‘‘Humble your-
selves before the Lord, and He will lift 
you up.’’ 
It is a good reminder for all of us. 
May his family be comforted during 
this time. 
f 
ACHIEVING 
THE 
GOAL 
OF 
A 
CLEAN AND HEALTHY ENVIRON-
MENT 
(Mr. CASTEN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CASTEN. Madam Speaker, the 
time for action is now. No longer can 
we substitute slogans for solutions. 
The protection of the environment of-
fers America its best hope. Achieving 
the goal of a clean and healthy envi-
ronment must be done by every Amer-
ican. We can reach this goal in this 
decade. And in reaching it, we can trig-
ger a chain reaction of confidence and 
hope. 
Those are the words of Bill Ruckels-
haus on this day 50 years ago; a Repub-
lican; the first Administrator of the 
EPA under Richard Nixon, and then 
again under Ronald Reagan; the man 
who implemented the Clean Air Act 
amendments of 1990. 
His successor under George H.W. 
Bush was Bill Reilly, who implemented 
the Acid Rain Program and the Mon-
treal Protocol, a global, market-based 
cap and trade program. These men 
knew that science and our obligations 
to future generations are not nego-
tiable. They tolerated no conflict be-
tween conservatism and conservation. 
Sixty percent of all the greenhouse 
gas emissions we have ever emitted as 
a species have been released since that 
speech Bill Ruckelshaus gave 50 years 
ago today. 
Madam Speaker, the time for action 
is now. 
f 
b 1245 
PARTISAN INFRASTRUCTURE 
(Mr. HILL asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to draw attention to what has 
become the new normal here in Wash-
ington, D.C. 
Despite talks of bipartisanship and 
unity, Democrats have turned to a par-
tisan, 
top-down, 
rampant 
spending 
style 
of 
governing 
with 
President 
Biden’s infrastructure vision as the lat-
est example. 
The fact is that the President’s $2.3 
trillion infrastructure vision really 
isn’t about infrastructure at all. Only 5 
percent is proposed for roads and 
bridges, and only 2 percent for airways, 
waterways, and ports. Instead, Demo-
crats have proposed spending over half 
a trillion dollars on Green New Deal- 
style programs to fulfill a far left wish 
list. 
What is their solution for paying for 
all of this? 
Increasing your taxes. 
The tax hikes to fund this spending 
spree will only hurt workers and result 
in lower wages and suppressed eco-
nomic growth. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage my 
friends on the other side of the aisle to 
stop posturing and work with us on 
this side of the aisle. Madam Speaker, 
we are ready to work with you across 
the aisle on a package that will truly 
make a difference to my constituents 
in Arkansas and people across our 
great Nation.

for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. BROWNLEY. Madam Speaker, on 
this Earth Day, I rise to recognize the 
crucial 
significance 
of 
President 
Biden’s international climate summit. 
After 4 years of neglecting our re-
sponsibilities to the planet and to fu-
ture generations, the U.S. is back on 
the world stage and ready to take the 
bold and urgent action that the cli-
mate crisis demands. 
There is no ‘‘go it alone’’ approach 
when it comes to climate change. To 
mitigate the impacts of the climate 
crisis, the entire world must come to-
gether with a common goal of stopping 
pollution, protecting public health, and 
building a clean and just economy. 
The consequences of neglecting our 
duty to protect the planet have never 
been more clear. 
I look forward to working with my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to 
advance the ambitious climate plans of 
the summit and come together to cre-
ate a cleaner and better tomorrow. 
f 
ARMENIAN GENOCIDE 
REMEMBRANCE DAY 
(Mrs. STEEL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Mrs. STEEL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to recognize the 106th anniversary of 
the Armenian genocide. 
Saturday, 
April 
24, 
is 
Armenian 
Genocide Remembrance Day. On the 
anniversary of the Armenian genocide, 
we mourn the innocent lives lost and 
renew our call to recognize these 
events for what they were: a genocide. 
The Armenian people were removed 
from their homes and fell victim to a 
mass murder campaign between 1915 
and 1916. It is estimated that over 1 
million Armenians were killed in this 
tragedy. 
So many years later, people still do 
not call these events a genocide. If we 
do not teach an accurate history, then 
we are doomed to repeat it. It is our re-
sponsibility to recognize these trage-
dies and to mourn them. 
f 
ADAM TOLEDO 
(Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. 
GARCI´A 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, the killing of Adam Toledo 
shook the Nation. 
The video released a week ago shows 
a 13-year-old boy being chased by an of-
ficer, complying with instructions to 
drop it, and it show his hands up. Still 
the officer shot Adam in the chest. He 
complied and still died. 
It is hard to watch the video and not 
imagine a son or a nephew in his place. 
It brought about very powerful, per-
sonal emotions for people. I know it did 
for me. 
I was around the same age as Adam 
when I moved to the neighborhood of 
Little Village. I have known countless 
youth who have died on our streets, 
whether it was gun violence from 
gangs, or in this case, the police. 
We must pass the George Floyd Jus-
tice in Policing Act and end qualified 
immunity. 
But in Black and Latino commu-
nities, we know the police play by a 
different set of rules too often. Change 
requires more accountability. We must 
invest in families and youth rather 
than violent policing. 
(English translation of the statement 
made in Spanish is as follows:) 
‘‘To rest in peace, Adam Toledo, our 
families and our community need jus-
tice and hope that this doesn’t happen 
again.’’ 
Para descansar en paz, Adam Toledo, 
nuestras 
familias 
y 
comunidad 
necesitan justicia y esperanza de que 
esto no se repetira.

HONORING THE LIFE OF DAVE 
RAAK 
(Mr. FEENSTRA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. FEENSTRA. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the life of Dave 
Raak from Hospers, Iowa. 
Dave recently passed away from a 
long and courageous battle with a rare 
organ condition. 
Dave dedicated his life to serving his 
community. 
His 
great-grandfather 
started Hospers Telephone Company in 
the early 1900s. Dave eventually took 
over the company from his dad and 
worked tirelessly to ensure that rural 
communities served by HTC Commu-
nications had quality telecommuni-
cation services. 
Dave was instrumental in building a 
fiber network in the 1990s across Iowa 
which now serves as the backbone of 
our economy by connecting rural Iowa 
to the world. 
Dave also leaves behind his wife of 54 
years, Arlene; and their children; Ruth, 
Rachel, and Paul; along with their 
many grandchildren. 
Dave was truly a family man. 
Please join me in praying for his 
loved ones as they say goodbye. 
f 
BLACK APRIL 
(Mr. CORREA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, April 
30 we will commemorate the 46th anni-
versary of Black April and the Fall of 
Saigon. On this day we are reminded of 
the pain of losing your homeland and 
the sacrifices made in the search for 
freedom from tyranny. 
When Saigon fell in 1975, thousands 
of families were forced to flee their 
home or be brutalized in reeducation 
camps. Today, the refugees of Vietnam 
are proud Americans who are a very 
important part of our community and 
our country. 
The United States must always be a 
beacon of hope to those without hope. 
We must continue to stand up for 
human rights and religious freedom 
around the world.

HONORING THE LIFE OF 
CONGRESSMAN ALCEE HASTINGS 
(Mrs. MURPHY of Florida asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Madam 
Speaker, I rise to say my final goodbye 
to Alcee Hastings, the dean of Florida’s 
congressional delegation, who recently 
passed away. 
Someone will be elected to fill his 
seat, but Alcee is irreplaceable. His life 
was full, complex, and extraordinary. 
Born in 1936, Alcee spent his forma-
tive years in my district. He lived in 
Altamonte Springs and attended the 
all-Black Crooms Academy in Sanford. 
This was the segregated South where 
the opportunities available to African 
Americans were few and the obstacles 
to success were many. But Alcee was a 
force of nature. He rose to become an 
attorney, then a State judge, and then 
a Federal judge. 
Judge Hastings suffered a setback, 
but he rose again becoming a Member 
of Congress admired by his colleagues 
and beloved by his constituents. 
As Congressman HAKEEM
JEFFRIES 
put it, he loved the people he served, 
and he always fought for the least, the 
lost, and the left behind. 
The book of Alcee’s life contained 
challenging chapters, but ultimately it 
is a story of redemption and achieve-
ment in the face of adversity, written 
by a warrior for justice and equality 
who left the world far better than he 
found it. 
Rest in peace, Congressman. You 
have earned it. 
f 
PAY PARITY FOR WOMEN 
(Mr. MRVAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. MRVAN. Madam Speaker, as a 
proud father of two daughters, Gene-
vieve and Scarlett, I was honored to 
join my colleagues last week in voting 
to support the passage of H.R. 7, the 
Paycheck Fairness Act. It is deeply re-
grettable that despite the enactment of 
the Equal Pay Act in 1963, there re-
mains serious wage gaps based on gen-
der. 
According to the American Associa-
tion of University Women, in the First 
District of Indiana, a woman earns just 
63 cents for every dollar that a man 
earns for performing the same job. 
There must be equal pay for equal 
work, and I am pleased that the House 
has taken action to right this wrong. 
I encourage our Senate colleagues to 
move forward with addressing this

REPARATION 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
we have had a tumultuous, but yet in-
vigorating 2 weeks. Just a week ago, 
we were able, in the Judiciary Com-
mittee, to pass H.R. 40, the Commis-
sion to Study and Develop Reparation 
Proposals. 
Those who voted for it came from all 
parts of the country and represented 
all racial groups. It was a wonderful ex-
perience 
of 
understanding 
the 
cruciality and recognizing the slave 
history of African Americans and fur-
ther developing proposals to deal with 
the 
dastardly 
impacts 
on 
African 
Americans. 
We are delighted to have the support 
of 
Japanese 
Americans, 
Hispanic 
Americans, Asian Pacific Americans, 
and, of course, White Americans be-
cause they understand the healing 
power of H.R. 40. 
Then we just recently had a judg-
ment—as I have said on this floor, I 
know the Floyd family. They are 
America’s family. 
We had a judgment on Tuesday that 
showed the strength of America and 
her justice system and the recognition 
that we are all created equal and each 
one has to be held accountable for his 
actions. 
So this has been a good week. Amer-
ica needs to know that. We look for-
ward to passing H.R. 40 on this floor in 
celebration of the commemoration of 
Juneteenth when slaves were finally 
freed and passing the George Floyd 
Justice in Policing Act.

ISSUES OF THE DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. GOHMERT) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the minority 
leader. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, it is 
my honor to yield to the gentlewoman 
from Florida (Mrs. CAMMACK). 
FARMERS TO FAMILIES FOOD BOX PROGRAM 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, 
last week the press—not the Depart-
ment of Agriculture—reported that the 
Trump administration’s Farmers to 
Families Food Box Program would 
come to an end. 
In 
subsequent 
reporting 
and 
an 
unapologetic email from the USDA, it 
was made clear that the only reason 
for its termination was because of the 
man who created it. 
The Farmers to Families Food Box 
Program had open eligibility, making 
certain anyone and everyone in need, 
regardless of status, income, or house-
hold size, had supplementary access to 
fresh meats, dairy, and produce. Since 
May 2020, this program has provided 
more than 156 million boxes to house-
holds across the United States. 
Farmers to Families provided an al-
ternative market for food intended for 
restaurants and food service, creating 
outlets for supply chains. Due to 
COVID this food could not easily be re-
aligned 
to 
retail 
markets 
quickly 
enough 
to 
prevent 
spoilage. 
Even 
today, Farmers to Families provides 
fresh products in greater quantities 
than traditional emergency feeding 
programs—items such as dairy, meat, 
and fresh produce, which have always 
presented unique logistical challenges 
for distribution. 
The program reemployed workers in 
the commercial food distribution sec-
tor whose work was halted by the clo-
sure of restaurants, hotels, and other 
food service industries during COVID. 
b 1300 
In my own district, L&M Farms, a 
participant in the program, managed 
to supply more than 600,000 boxes of 
fresh produce to those in need. 
Regardless of the various hiccups 
heard during USDA’s listening sessions 
in previous hearings and from Members 
of this very House, the program worked 
exactly as intended, as a lifeline for 
consumers and producers alike during 
a challenging time. 
Nine hours after the press broke the 
story, USDA relayed, via email, that 
commodity purchases will ‘‘continue to 
occur and be directed to existing, reli-
able channels of distribution.’’ 
This leads me to believe that locally 
focused producers and distributors who 
benefited greatly from Farmers to 
Families are being traded in for bil-
lion-dollar organizations that have al-
ready received billions in government 
aid to perpetuate dependence instead of 
eradicating it. 
Madam Speaker, I hope this body 
comes together to voice their strong 
opposition to the termination of this 
small piece of salvation that had a 
positive impact on all of our local com-
munities, particularly those in rural 
areas. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend from Florida, who 
truly is my friend, for her comments. 
At this time, it is my privilege to 
yield to the gentleman from Indiana 
(Mr. BAIRD), my friend, a Baird man. 
PLIGHT OF LAKES SHAFER AND FREEMAN 
Mr. BAIRD. Madam Speaker, I appre-
ciate my good friend from Texas allow-
ing me to share with this body the pro-
gram that I have for today. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to call 
attention to the overwhelming chal-
lenges plaguing a community in my 
district. It is located in White and Car-
roll Counties of west central Indiana. 
The communities surrounding Lakes 
Shafer and Freeman are a recreation 
destination for Hoosiers from all across 
the State and from Americans across 
the country. 
The Twin Lakes, as they are known, 
straddle the small community of Mon-
ticello. In the nearly 100 years since 
the two reservoirs were created by 
damming up the Tippecanoe River, 
their far-reaching attraction has cre-
ated a flourishing local economy built 
on tourism, replete with the trappings 
of a family vacation, including its own 
amusement park, cruise boat, resort, 
marina, and much more. 
Despite all the buildup of amenities 
of this Hoosier destination, the lakes 
remained the focal point of the com-
munity and the driving force of the re-
gional economy. Unfortunately, lake 
conditions can also have a negative im-
pact on the local area. 
At the hands of Mother Nature and 
outside forces, these crown jewels of 
the region have been tarnished. On 
multiple occasions, Lake Freeman, be-
cause of drought conditions, has been 
drained to the riverbed that flows at 
the bottom. 
Unfortunately, these episodes of di-
minishing lake levels have come at an 
increasingly frequent rate in recent 
years and in times of even moderate 
drought conditions. These droughts 
caused the lake to become almost com-
pletely drained and resulted in devasta-
tion to the natural ecology and the 
local economy. 
Businesses, 
homes, 
property—both 
real and personal—tax revenue, and the 
loss of family time are all impacted. 
The past 7 months have been one of 
those times as drought conditions last 
summer once again caused Lake Free-
man’s water level to plummet by more 
than 13 feet, completely draining the 
vast majority of this 1500-acre res-
ervoir. 
One victim of this devastation is the 
disruption of local ecological balance. 
During the worst parts of the episode, 
area residents walked the lake bed only 
to find dead turtles, fish, mussels, and 
more that had succumbed to the lack 
of water. 
Safety also became a tremendous 
challenge for locals and boaters as 
water levels sank, exposing stumps, 
sharp objects, and other items usually 
covered by the water. 
These impacts on the lake quality 
are especially disappointing to a com-
munity that has prided itself in its 
conservation stewardship of the lake. 
Members of the community have band-
ed together to form Shafer & Freeman 
Lakes 
Environmental 
Conservation 
Corporation, also known as SFLECC. 
This volunteer group raises thou-
sands of dollars every year to fund the 
Summer Lakes Clean Up project. Over 
the years, this group has volunteered 
over 17,000 hours in helping preserve 
the beauty and natural environment of 
the lakes. 
Residents are facing tremendous eco-
nomic costs as well. Property values 
have plunged; local drinking water and 
drinking wells have dried up; retaining 
walls have buckled, threatening to col-
lapse; and boats are stranded and un-
able to be winterized. 
The financial costs to solve these 
issues are too high for many residents.

H2094 
April 22, 2021 
Even if they wanted to move, the val-
ues of their homes have dropped con-
siderably. One resident who moved to 
Lake Freeman after she retired said: 
‘‘We built a retirement home 10 years 
ago. It is probably not worth half of 
what we have in it. It is very depress-
ing.’’ 
Another resident told our office 
about the difficulties they have faced 
after their water well dried up. In order 
to use any water, they have to drive 
miles away to purchase their water 
from a grocery store. 
Small businesses are facing the same 
tough financial decisions. The Madam 
Carroll, a cruise boat and entertain-
ment venue, struggled significantly to 
keep their business above water, lit-
erally. Because of the dried-up lake, 
the owners of the vessel had to dock 
their boat that usually sails year- 
round. ‘‘It is almost as bad as it can 
get,’’ Chris Peters, co-owner of the 
Madam Carroll, told me. 
Tall Timbers, a marina that helps 
prepare and store boats for the winter, 
saw a dramatic drop in their business. 
In an average year, they process and 
winterize around 500 boats but were 
only able to house around 200 boats 
this year due to them being unable to 
access the customers’ boats. 
Susan Wagner, who owns the conven-
ience store and gas station on the 
shores of the lake, described the situa-
tion as bleak. She had to let her em-
ployees go earlier than usual because 
of the lack of business. 
I am proud of the resiliency that the 
Hoosiers of this magnificent commu-
nity have shown. They have exhausted 
many options to find a solution to this 
constant problem. 
While I am disappointed and sad-
dened for these Hoosiers because of the 
difficulty that these conditions have 
created, I am happy to report that con-
ditions have finally been restored to 
normal just recently because of the 
rains after more than 7 long months of 
this kind of condition. 
I want the Hoosiers in my district 
and all those impacted by Lake Free-
man’s challenges to know that I hear 
their concerns, that I am here on their 
behalf, and that I will do everything I 
can to remedy this problem. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for his comments. 
It is obviously an important issue. We 
have been taking up such issues, but it 
is not necessarily the best way to pro-
ceed. 
For one thing, the bill that was 
passed today to make the District of 
Columbia a State flies in the face of 
the brilliance of the Founders when it 
came to setting up our Federal Govern-
ment. 
Before we had the Constitution rati-
fied in 1789, our first President was 
sworn in under the new Constitution in 
1789, George Washington, and the first 
Vice President, John Adams. They 
were all sworn in in Federal Hall there 
in New York City, so that was tech-
nically the first Capital under the new 
Constitution. Before that, under the 
Articles of Confederation, they used 
Philadelphia and, obviously, New York. 
But in the Constitution itself, there 
was a provision for a Federal district 10 
miles by 10 miles square. It included 
land that was ceded from Maryland 
that was on the east side of the Poto-
mac River, as well as a little bit less 
land from the west side of the Potomac 
from Virginia. 
The reason the Founders felt it was 
so important to have a separate Fed-
eral entity that was not wholly con-
tained within a State, not contained 
within a city, but a Federal enclave as 
the Capital, was so that—the big rea-
son—no State, no city government 
could try to extort or hold the Capital 
hostage. 
For example, if the Capital got its 
water from or through a State or city, 
then they would be subject to having 
their water turned off. Of course, that 
was a rather big issue back in the day. 
We know that New York City had a 
problem with disease and lack of water 
to put out fires. A guy named Aaron 
Burr, who ended up being Vice Presi-
dent and hoped to be President, he and 
some partners made a proposal for leg-
islation that would create the Manhat-
tan Water Company that would provide 
all the water that was needed, and it 
would be clean. That would help stop 
the disease. 
They would provide water free to put 
out fires, and so that seemed very at-
tractive. The thing is, though, they 
said they needed a monopoly so that 
they could afford to pay for all they 
were going to do. 
They had Alexander Hamilton review 
it. They got him to sign on that it was 
a worthy, honorable project. Some-
where after Alexander Hamilton re-
viewed the language for that, other 
words were inserted not only to provide 
for the Manhattan Water Company, or 
water business, but also such other 
economic practices or businesses they 
felt appropriate. 
Well, that was the scheme the whole 
time, to create a bank that was not 
created under other Federal law. So, 
the Manhattan Bank was created. 
Aaron Burr and his partners let Man-
hattan suffer without the water. So, 
even back then, in the late 1700s, early 
1800s, water was a big deal. 
Electricity was, obviously, not a big 
deal yet, but the same thing. If you 
have to get things you need to subsist 
through another State or city, then 
there is always a possibility that you 
could be extorted. 
We saw the brilliance of the Founders 
back last summer when we had a Dem-
ocrat Mayor that did not like the 
President of the United States. Some 
of us were wondering whether she was 
going to authorize Washington, D.C., 
police to protect the White House 
itself. 
Obviously, she didn’t provide much 
help to stop fires from being lit at the 
historic church right there, catty-cor-
ner to the White House. But some of us 
observed what was going on and a 
Mayor who didn’t seem to care too 
much about the President. 
Wow, what if you saw that play out? 
It is exactly what the Founders wanted 
to avoid, the U.S. Capital, the U.S. 
Government, being held hostage. You 
could see how it could very easily have 
played into that situation. 
So, it was brilliant. The Federal en-
clave, the Federal district that was 
provided for in our Constitution, would 
not be part of any State, would not be 
part of a city. It would be the District 
of Columbia. It was brilliant. 
Now, as the majority leader pointed 
out, purely for politics—this was all 
about politics. The majority decided 
they wanted to make the District of 
Columbia a State unto itself. If that 
were to become a part of our system 
here, then this government would be 
totally subject to the whims of the 
State of Columbia. 
b 1315 
We could be prevented from going 
into session. We could be prevented 
from leaving. It creates a situation 
down the road for when things could 
truly get out of hand. 
And even though the mainstream 
media and our friends across the aisle 
referred to the at least $2 billion of 
damage, the deaths, shooting, looting, 
government buildings being burned as 
peaceful 
demonstrations, 
they 
cer-
tainly weren’t in the areas where 
things were being burned, stores were 
being looted, and destruction was the 
lot. 
That could come back again, and you 
could have people who would be that 
active. It certainly appears that BLM 
is more concerned about making this a 
socialist country, an Orwellian, a to-
talitarian country than they are about 
any race. Antifa is just all about cre-
ating chaos, because they figure, out of 
chaos, will come a totalitarian, Orwell-
ian government. 
So this time we are going through 
right now will be looked at historically 
in other countries and whatever this 
country becomes, and this will be 
pointed to as a very, very important 
time. 
Now, we were accused of playing poli-
tics with this issue on the Republican 
side. I can’t speak for everyone, but I 
can speak for all the Republicans I 
have talked to. This is still an impor-
tant concept that we not have a Cap-
ital subject to being held hostage. And 
if D.C. becomes a State, that scenario 
is then set up, and it is not good for the 
country. 
In wrestling with these issues after I 
got here—you know, I saw the license 
plate, and I mentioned this before in 
years past—that, at first, when I saw 
‘‘taxation 
without 
representation,’’ 
you know, I didn’t get it. It didn’t seem 
appropriate. But then you find out that 
actually every territory that does not 
have a full voting Member of the House 
of Representatives that is a territory 
of the U.S.—whether it is Puerto Rico,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2095 
April 22, 2021 
Guam, Samoa, U.S. Virgin Islands, a 
number of places—if they don’t elect a 
full voting representative, they do not 
pay Federal income tax. 
And in going back to the Revolu-
tion—and I put this in what is H.R. 
1295, in this Congress, but I filed it 
back several Congresses ago, and I filed 
it, I think, in most every Congress 
since because I believe it is the right 
thing to do. To me, it is not a matter 
of politics; it is a matter of being con-
sistent with an ideal. 
As Ben Franklin said, if we don’t 
elect one Member of the British Par-
liament, they have no right to tax us. 
That was a righteous concept, and it 
still is. As a matter of principle, I have 
to agree with that. The people of D.C. 
are right, they shouldn’t have to pay a 
Federal income tax. 
But as I put in my bill and have in all 
these different Congress sessions we 
have been through, as I filed it each 
time, the phrase ‘‘no taxation without 
representation’’ was a rallying cry of 
many American colonists during the 
period of British rule in the 1760s and 
early 1770s. The slogan gained wide-
spread notoriety after the passage of 
the Sugar Act on April 5, 1764. Amer-
ican colonists increasingly resented 
having taxes levied upon them without 
having any legislators they elected 
who were voting in Parliament in Lon-
don. 
The idea that there should be no tax-
ation without representation dated 
back even further. This issue became 
even more defined in 1765, with the pas-
sage of the Stamp Act, which was the 
first true attempt to levy a direct tax 
on the American colonies. Ultimately, 
that tax was repealed, but the idea of 
no taxation without representation 
persisted. 
Article I, Section 2, Clause 1 of the 
United States Constitution says: ‘‘The 
House of Representatives shall be com-
posed of Members chosen every second 
Year by the People of the several 
States.’’ 
That is why, unless someone was 
from a State, then under the Constitu-
tion, they didn’t get a full voting Mem-
ber of the House. 
By the same token, if we are going to 
be consistent with the founding prin-
ciples, the residents of the District of 
Columbia should not be paying Federal 
income tax, just as those in Puerto 
Rico and other territories don’t pay 
Federal income tax. 
So the bill goes on, and it points out 
that Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Is-
lands, Guam, the Commonwealth of the 
Northern Mariana Islands, American 
Samoa, all of these, don’t pay Federal 
income tax. 
So the rest of this bill, H.R. 1295, in 
this Congress, just has, in effect, the 
residents of D.C. shouldn’t have to and 
don’t pay Federal income tax. 
Now, since I have been here, this 
issue has been coming up, just as it has 
over the centuries, about the District 
of Columbia representation. It came up 
back in 1847. The Federal Government 
was not really utilizing the land west 
of the Potomac, and the people there 
were saying, Look, we want to elect 
two Senators, Representatives as our 
population allows; and you are not 
using our land; let us go back to being 
part of Virginia. 
So, in 1847, Congress, the House and 
Senate, signed by the President, ceded 
land back to Virginia, the State from 
which it came, because to do otherwise 
would have been to cheat Virginia, be-
cause Virginia gave that land for the 
purpose of being used as part of the 
Federal enclave, the Federal Capital. 
So if the U.S. Government had done 
anything besides use it as a Federal en-
clave for part of the U.S. Capital, with-
out Virginia’s permission, that basi-
cally the Federal Government would 
have stolen that from Virginia. The 
right thing, the proper, honorable 
thing to do, if it wasn’t going to use 
the land, was to give it back to Vir-
ginia. 
Now, some of us can see why it might 
have been nice if they had said, No, we 
are going to use it, so we are not going 
to cede it back, but you don’t have— 
when Federal income tax came along, 
you don’t have to pay that. 
But that is not what happened. It was 
ceded back to Virginia. That is why, 
when anyone sees a map of the District 
of Columbia, it is not a perfect square. 
On the west, it follows the Potomac 
River. 
So I have that bill. I have had it for 
many Congresses now. I wish that when 
Republicans were in the majority, I 
could have gotten our leadership to 
bring it to the floor, because it should 
have been brought to the floor and it 
should 
have 
passed. 
But 
I 
really 
thought that at some point—and I had 
even offered to redo the bill and put 
any Democrats, including Delegate EL-
EANOR HOLMES NORTON, have it as her 
bill. She has not chosen to ever be part 
of this bill. And then we hear today, 
well, it is all because of politics. 
Well, I have not ever proposed this 
for politics. I am proposing it because I 
know our history and I know this is the 
right thing to do. They should not have 
to pay Federal income tax. 
What I have offered in prior years is, 
Look, you are trying to have D.C. have 
a full voting representative with just 
legislation. That will be unconstitu-
tional at some point. Why don’t you at 
least go ahead and get this bill passed, 
especially while Democrats are in the 
majority, so that until such time as 
D.C. has a full voting representative, 
you at least don’t have to pay taxes 
without full representation? 
But I have never gotten Democrats 
to agree to do that. So it was not 
brought to the floor by Republican 
leaders over the years. That may well 
have been for political reasons. But it 
is being pushed by me, and has all 
these years, as a matter of principle, 
and it still is. 
Why wouldn’t Democrats agree to go 
ahead and do this bill until such time, 
when and if, it becomes unnecessary? 
Why would Democrats continue to 
allow taxation without representation 
to go unchanged? 
I have been trying to do this for 13 
years or so. Apparently, it is a problem 
on both sides of the aisle. I wish people 
would quit playing politics and just be 
fair to the people of Washington, D.C. 
Back when I first proposed a bill to 
eliminate the Federal income tax—as 
Puerto Rico knows, there is no Federal 
income tax, but they have a very, very 
substantial local tax, which is what 
happens when you have approaching 30 
percent of the workers working for the 
government. You are going to have a 
lot of taxes to pay. 
But on the other hand, in 1847, since 
land was ceded west of the Potomac 
back to Virginia, if you are bent on 
giving people two Senators to vote for, 
as well as at least one Representative, 
then the proper thing to do would be to 
cede the land back to the State from 
which it came; don’t cheat that State. 
The Federal Government should not be 
in the business of cheating people or 
cheating States. 
This bill—it has had another number 
before, but in this Congress it is 2651, 
and it is cited as the ‘‘District of Co-
lumbia-Maryland 
Reunion 
Act.’’ 
It 
goes through and gives some history. I 
am kind of big on that. It is important 
to know where we came from so we 
know where we should go. It cites some 
of the things I have already mentioned, 
but then it gets into actually drawing 
a descriptive line around the Federal 
buildings, to include the Capitol and 
the White House and the important 
Federal buildings—so that would still 
be Federal property—and then ceding 
the rest of the land back to Maryland. 
Now, I would prefer just to keep the 
District of Columbia and the residents 
not pay Federal income tax, rather 
than trying to do what is unconstitu-
tional—it seemed pretty clear to me— 
to cheat Maryland out of the land they 
gave. I mean, it is a bait and switch. 
Yeah, you gave it for the Federal en-
clave, but we are going to take it and 
make it a separate State. And, yes, 
each time you create a new State, it 
weakens the power of those States al-
ready in existence, because their two 
Senators’ votes are not quite as impor-
tant as they once were. But this would 
be a constitutional and appropriate so-
lution if the majority chose to go that 
way. 
b 1330 
I still think, regardless, even as the 
majority persists in trying to create a 
State, which I think should ultimately 
be struck down, why not go ahead and 
give the residents of the District of Co-
lumbia the relief they deserve and say, 
In the meantime, Congress has full au-
thority to say who is taxed and who 
isn’t, and the residents of the District 
of Columbia do not elect a full voting 
Representative yet, so they don’t pay 
any income tax. 
And, again, I will extend that offer. I 
was told by State senator Bill Ratliff—

and I can’t remember who he quoted— 
but ‘‘It is amazing what you can get 
done if you don’t care who gets the 
credit.’’ I have often been willing to 
say, put whoever’s name will help this 
bill get through. 
In fact, sometimes I have made my 
own leadership mad enough that, you 
know, if I had a good idea, I would pro-
vide it to somebody on the committee 
of jurisdiction and say, ‘‘This is a good 
bill, why don’t you lead on it? 
‘‘Well, why don’t you do it? 
‘‘Because you are on the committee 
of jurisdiction, and I have made Repub-
lican leaders mad, and so it has got a 
better chance if you do it.’’ And it has 
been nice to see people make good use 
of their authority in that way. 
Of course, there has been plenty of 
things written about this issue. There 
is one from a blog of the National Ar-
chives, ‘‘Unratified Amendments: D.C. 
Voting 
Rights,’’ 
interesting 
article 
there. 
National Review has an article from 
March of this year, ‘‘D.C. Statehood is 
an Idea Whose Time Should Never 
Come.’’ 
Another from David Harsanyi, ‘‘Con-
cerning D.C. Statehood, the Founders 
Have Already Spoken.’’ That is from 
March of this year also. 
Something called the Wayback Ma-
chine has an article on ‘‘Constitutional 
Amendments Not Ratified,’’ and of 
course, D.C. statehood is one such, as is 
the idea of giving full representation, 
though the Constitution says it will 
come from the several States. That was 
something we had voted on in a prior 
Congress since I have been here. 
There is a great letter from the At-
torney General of South Carolina, Alan 
Wilson, on this issue, and he makes a 
great argument just stating how Arti-
cle IV, Section 3 provides that new 
States may be admitted by Congress in 
the Union, but goes on to explain why 
the only lawful way to provide state-
hood to the District of Columbia is to 
amend the Constitution. The District 
of Columbia’s creation traces to Arti-
cle I, Section 8, Clause 17 of the Con-
stitution, and he goes on and makes a 
very compelling case. 
So I don’t know what the Senate is 
going to do. I hope that at least some 
of the Democrat Senators will under-
stand that this is no time to be vio-
lating our Constitution when things 
have been going out of control. You 
have got even some people right in our 
own House of Representatives that are 
calling for and have called for con-
frontation, getting in people’s faces, 
making them miserable, intimidating, 
threatening, making sure they aren’t 
feeling welcome. 
This is a tragic time. The Founders 
would normally quote Voltaire—some 
say the attribution lies elsewhere—but 
the statement was, ‘‘I disagree with 
what you say, but will defend to the 
death your right to say it.’’ And now-
adays it seems like the majority in 
power in Congress and the White House 
more takes a position: I disagree with 
what you say, and I am truly woke, so 
I want you fired. I want you never to be 
able to get work again. I want your 
children harassed. We are going to 
threaten to rape, kill, destroy, do all 
kinds of damage to your family, and we 
hope that, you know, your family is de-
stroyed and no longer exists very soon. 
I mean, that is a long way from 
where we came. We have come so far, 
and in each century we made major 
steps forward so that the Constitution 
would mean exactly what it says. And 
now we are arriving at a time where, 
instead of reaching what Dr. King 
dreamed of, people being judged by the 
content of their character and not the 
color of their skin or anything else, we 
are going back to being a more racist 
society. We do want segregation. 
I mean, there was a time when seg-
regation 
was 
considered 
evil. 
You 
shouldn’t segregate people by their 
skin color. Yes, Franklin Roosevelt be-
lieved in it, Democrat that he was. 
Democrat Woodrow Wilson believed in 
segregation and did so and used seg-
regation inappropriately. 
And now we are coming back to a 
time where people on the left are advo-
cating for segregation, advocating for 
judging people by their skin color. It is 
still wrong. It has always been wrong. 
It still is. 
One of the beauties of a country 
founded on Judeo-Christian principles 
was, regardless that slavery existed, if 
this country was going to continue 
under the principles on which it was 
founded, there was going to have to be 
a day of reckoning when people who 
were leaders in this country said, 
Look, we were endowed by our God, our 
Creator with certain inalienable rights, 
and it doesn’t matter what your skin 
color is. 
Those things don’t matter. God loves 
every human being. There are some 
things we are told in the Bible God 
hates. Lying lips is one that God de-
tests, and that is easy to understand. 
But God doesn’t want for any of us to 
stumble, and he doesn’t want people 
causing others to stumble. We seem to 
have been approaching that more close-
ly than ever in our history. 
It took a Civil War, it took a Chris-
tian minister named King preaching 
nonviolence, peaceful demonstration, 
not getting in people’s faces and in-
timidating them or using violence. We 
were making so much progress. We had 
come further than any country in the 
history of the world. 
I heard somebody this week say we 
are really probably the most racially 
diverse country, and we don’t penalize 
people for their race. That has been a 
problem throughout history for the 
world, and yet we have made so much 
progress, and now we have people on 
the left advocating for segregation and 
advocating for judging people by char-
acteristics instead of by the content of 
their character. 
It was also shocking this week in de-
bate in the Judiciary Committee to 
hear somebody across the aisle saying 
that no Democrats have ever advocated 
for defunding the police, and I am sure 
it was intended as an honest state-
ment. The trouble is it is simply not 
true. And you don’t have to do much of 
an online search. Even with Google and 
Facebook and Twitter covering for the 
Democratic Party, you still don’t have 
to work too hard to find so many Dem-
ocrat-controlled 
cities 
that 
are 
defunding the police. They are cutting 
funds to the police. It is easy to find. 
And there are more even in this body 
itself that are advocating to just com-
pletely do away with the policing like 
we have. 
Having dealt with the justice system 
for most of my adult life, I know the 
police are not immune to having bad 
apples, but it always struck me that 
there were a whole lot fewer bad ap-
ples, percentage wise, in law enforce-
ment than there were in most any 
other area of life, of any other profes-
sion. And they are owed our respect. 
That is why it becomes very unpleas-
ant when anyone in control ends up 
using law enforcement as a political 
battering ram against those who are 
not in the majority. 
We have known for many weeks now 
that there was and is, according to the 
chief of Capitol Police and Sergeant at 
Arms, no intelligence from any source 
that any Member of Congress is a 
threat to any other Member of Con-
gress, which means the metal detectors 
that the Speaker has had installed 
around the west, east, and north en-
trance were totally unnecessary. 
And then, of course, after I pointed 
out that I was being fined $5,000 for 
going to the restroom right out that 
door, where there was no metal detec-
tor there or at the other end of the 
Speaker’s lobby, and I didn’t avoid the 
metal detectors. I went through the 
metal detector on the west and did so 
satisfactorily, and for days when I was 
in here for a long period of time, I 
could go right there to the restroom, 
the guards right there at the entrance 
of the Speaker’s lobby could see you go 
in, see you come out. They checked out 
the restroom, you know. There is not 
even a tank where you could do like 
was done in ‘‘The Godfather’’ where a 
gun was put in the tank of the toilet. 
Not even a tank to do that in there. I 
had never been told you need to be 
wanded or checked or anything. That 
was totally new. But since I raised 
that, now metal detectors have been 
put there so that Democrats can go 
after Republicans. And I say that be-
cause we now have examples of even 
the Speaker and others who have gone 
through metal detectors, set off the 
metal detector, and refused to be 
wanded and have not been fined. 
Now, I understand the majority whip 
may have done that today. I am very 
sorry for Mr. CLYBURN, they may have 
to make an example of him just to 
keep the pressure, to keep me from get-
ting out of my fine, but it doesn’t 
change the fact that to this time the 
use of the metal detectors has been

very arbitrary and capricious, and the 
enforcement of the metal detectors has 
been very arbitrary and capricious. 
Hopefully, those being utilized to 
harass 
Members 
of 
Congress—espe-
cially since a couple of our folks have 
missed votes. If they hadn’t had to go 
through the metal detector, they would 
have gotten in here in time to vote. 
b 1345 
It is time to open things up. Then we 
get word: Well, we are going start 
opening up, but you have to go through 
us, tell us anybody you are proposing 
to meet with and what the purpose is, 
this kind of stuff. We are not letting a 
good crisis go to waste. We are going to 
be very Orwellian here, and we are 
going to use this as an excuse to con-
trol who Members of Congress can see, 
who they can talk to, and really have 
an iron grip on what people can do. 
It has gotten really sad around this 
place. 
Here is an article from Stephanie 
Pagones, ‘‘Cities such as Austin, L.A., 
Minneapolis, New York City, and Port-
land have shifted funds from police de-
partments.’’ 
Obviously, 
this 
lady, 
Stephanie, knows that when Demo-
crats have said they are not defunding 
the police, that is not true. Democrats 
around the country are pushing for and 
actually getting budgets slashed for po-
lice departments. 
‘‘Cities in parts of the U.S.,’’ she 
said, ‘‘that slashed their police depart-
ment funding last year, in part as a re-
sult of police-involved shootings, have 
seen an uptick in certain crimes over 
the past year, according to data ana-
lyzed by FOX News. Cities such as Los 
Angeles, Minneapolis, New York City, 
Portland, Oregon, and Austin, Texas, 
have shifted funds from police depart-
ments to social services programs. 
Such cuts have led some departments 
to lay off officers, cancel recruiting 
classes, or retreat from hiring goals. 
‘‘As police departments were left to 
make do with shrunken budgets and 
less support, some big cities have seen 
sometimes drastic upticks in murders 
and other violent crimes. . . . The 
‘defund the police’ movement is not 
necessarily about gutting police de-
partment budgets, though some groups 
have tried. And budget cuts were al-
ready expected as a result of alter-
native needs for funding because of the 
coronavirus pandemic.’’ 
Then, the article goes on and looks 
at the cuts that some of these cities 
have had. 
Here is an article: ‘‘Democrat Rep-
resentative MAXINE WATERS Demanded 
Special Police Motorcade and Escort 
Before Calling for Violence at Anti-Po-
lice Event,’’ by Jordan Davidson at The 
Federalist. 
Daily Caller’s Henry Rodgers reports: 
‘‘ ‘The Squad’ Pushes to ‘Defund the 
Police’ While Spending Thousands on 
Private Security to Protect Them-
selves.’’ 
You have to have some protection 
from somewhere. Otherwise, you are 
not going to be able to maintain a posi-
tion of authority in government. There 
are always going to be evil people, in 
this world at least, who are going to 
attempt to bring down people in au-
thority. 
This article is from Matt Palumbo, 
December 30, 2020: ‘‘2020 Homicide 
Surge Sets RECORD Amid ‘Defund the 
Police’ Hysteria.’’ It has facts and fig-
ures on that. 
One other thing I want to touch on. 
Since we have some people who believe 
climate change is the most pressing 
issue of our time, I was surprised to 
hear the former leader of NASA say 
that they had found that our Moon, the 
Earth’s Moon, is slightly changing its 
orbit because I had not read that or 
seen that anywhere, and that even 
Earth’s orbit around the Sun is slightly 
changing. 
Of course, I had seen previously that 
the ice caps were melting, and some 
people say it is because of the cars, pol-
lution. But it still doesn’t explain to 
me why the ice caps on the planet Mars 
have melted or have been melting for 
cow flatulence or different things here 
on Earth. How is that causing the ice 
caps on Mars to melt? 
Here is an article from NASA, from 
February 27, 2020. It says: ‘‘Our lives 
literally revolve around cycles: series 
of events that are repeated regularly in 
the same order. There are hundreds of 
different types of cycles in our world 
and in the universe. Some are natural, 
such as the change of the seasons,’’ 
that is one form of climate change, 
‘‘annual animal migrations, or the cir-
cadian rhythms that govern our sleep 
patterns. Others are human-produced, 
like growing and harvesting crops, mu-
sical rhythms, or economic cycles.’’ 
It goes on to point out something 
called the Milankovitch cycles, and 
they include: ‘‘The shape of Earth’s 
orbit, known as eccentricity; the angle 
Earth’s axis is tilted with respect to 
Earth’s orbital plane, known as obliq-
uity; and the direction Earth’s axis of 
rotation 
is 
pointed, 
known 
as 
precession.’’ It goes on to discuss this. 
Apparently, there is another article 
from Forbes from April of last year, 
‘‘Earth Is Spiraling Away From the 
Sun for Now, But Eventually Will 
Crash Into It.’’ I had not heard or read 
that before, about our Moon’s orbit 
changing at all or the Earth’s orbit 
around the Sun changing at all. I don’t 
know what, if anything, could be done 
about that, but there is no question 
that the Moon’s orbit changing or 
Earth’s orbit changing around the Sun 
can’t help but have significant effects 
on our climate. 
This article, the headline says that 
Earth will eventually crash into the 
Sun. Well, it is amazing. I remember in 
the 1970s reading that we were at the 
beginning of a new ice age. It was very 
early in the new ice age, but eventu-
ally, Earth would be covered by ice. It 
would mean the end of life as we knew 
it. 
As a Christian, I was thinking that is 
not how the Earth is going to end, and 
I didn’t really believe that. Lo and be-
hold, it wasn’t too many years later we 
find out, or we are told: Well, the Earth 
is warming, and the Earth’s warming is 
going to destroy the planet. It is global 
warming. 
Then, of course, global warming, we 
found out some places it was cooling. 
As one witness said some years back, 
actually, the Northern Hemisphere is 
not nearly as warm as it was back 
when the Norse were coming over and 
having these big farms in what we now 
call Greenland. 
There are cycles, and there is some-
thing that could come into play in the 
great design of our Creator that would 
keep Earth from crashing into the Sun. 
But in the meantime, it is important 
that we not run around like Chicken 
Little and destroy the rich blessings we 
have out of fear that we may miss out 
on other blessings. Let’s use the wis-
dom and common sense that most of 
our constituents have. 
In the meantime, I think we really 
need to find out more about the chang-
ing orbit of Earth around the Sun and 
the changing orbit, if any, of the Moon 
around the Earth. It is a lot to learn. 
If we are going to help contribute to 
the downfall of the greatest experiment 
in self-government in the history of the 
world, then making our Nation’s Cap-
ital where it could be subject to being 
extorted, held hostage, then these 
other things may not matter anyway. 
In the meantime, we have a responsi-
bility to the Nation, our oath, and the 
Constitution to ensure that we keep 
this experiment in self-government 
going. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

WAITING FOR ANSWERS ABOUT 
JOSHUA JOHNSON 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. GREEN) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the majority 
leader. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, and still I rise. And I rise today be-
cause I am deeply saddened. 
I am saddened because today rep-
resents the day in the life of a con-
stituent that she will never forget, 
that her husband will never forget. 
I rise to call to the attention of the 
world the words of a constituent. These 
words were printed in the Houston 
Chronicle. I am grateful to the Chron-
icle for publishing this story because 
this story speaks to a circumstance un-
like that with George Floyd. I will say 
more about that in just a moment. 
But I rise, grateful to the Chronicle, 
with the words of a mother. Here are 
her words: ‘‘Our son was killed before 
George Floyd, but we are still waiting 
for answers.’’

today in Houston, Texas, in my con-
gressional district. He lost his life sev-

home of his parents. He lost his life 
while housesitting for a neighbor. He 
was 35 years of age, well-liked. 
I spoke to many of his neighbors, 
many of his friends, many of the people 
in the neighborhood. I never heard one 
unkind thing said about him. He was a 
person who was always there to be of 
service. 
He 
lost 
his 
life 
while 
housesitting, trying to help a friend, a 
neighbor. 
He served in the military. Here is a 
photo. He served in the military, a 
graduate 
of 
a 
local 
high 
school, 
Westbury High School. He loved the 
Dallas Cowboys. He was a typical 
young person. His name was Joshua 
Johnson. 
Joshua’s parents, the Bearys, Mr. and 
Mrs. Beary, are grieving. They have 
been grieving since he lost his life a 
year ago. They have been grieving be-
cause the circumstances are question-
able. 
But these circumstances, unlike the 
circumstances that we had with George 
Floyd, are circumstances where there 
was no body camera. There was no wit-
ness to record what happened. These 
circumstances occurred early in the 
morning, perhaps around 6 a.m., 1 year 
ago. 
b 1400 
The parents were not present. Mr. 
Beary took his wife to work. He re-
turned home, and she received a phone 
call. Here are her words: ‘‘It was April 
22, 2020, around 7:30 a.m., when my hus-
band, Richard, who had just dropped 
me off at work an hour earlier, called 
me and said the words that changed my 
life and his forever. He said, ‘Someone 
shot and killed Josh.’’’ 
They would go as close as they could 
to the actual scene, which is just a few 
houses down from where they lived, 
and they would encounter a peace offi-
cer. 
I like the term ‘‘peace officer’’ as op-
posed to ‘‘police officer.’’ Both are good 
terms, but to me, the term ‘‘peace offi-
cer’’ carries with it something that I 
think is important for us to consider, 
as we consider the great issues of our 
time. 
Policing is one of the great issues of 
our time. A peace officer is always 
there to make peace, to help us acquire 
peace, to help us maintain the peace, 
to do the peaceful thing whenever pos-
sible. I know that it is not always pos-
sible, but whenever possible. 
So, they went as close as they could 
to the scene, and they encountered an 
officer who was investigating. They 
wanted to know what happened to 
their son, which is what any parent 
would want to know: What happened to 
my son? 
It is not an unreasonable question. It 
is not unusual, by the way, for parents 
to have some emotional characteristics 
at the time they are posing questions 
because they just lost their son. They 
don’t know what happened. 
This officer proceeded to explain to 
them that their son approached an un-
dercover officer, that their son ap-
proached this officer, who was seated 
in a vehicle, and when he approached 
this officer, he had his phone in one 
hand and a gun in the other hand. 
There were persons who were with 
them at the time the officer was ex-
plaining this. These persons sought to 
intercede and said he had a BB gun. 
The officer acknowledged that it was a 
BB gun. 
They were told by this officer that 
the officer who was seated in the vehi-
cle, the officer who was undercover, 
around 6 a.m., that he told the son to 
lower his BB pistol—he didn’t say BB 
pistol, but to lower what he thought 
was a gun. 
The story gets murky, but the officer 
who was undercover said to the son: 
Lower your pistol. Lower your gun. 
He said that their son, Josh, did not 
do so, that he, in fact, raised it, and the 
officer responded by shooting him—not 
once, but twice. 
The parents were obviously moved by 
what they were hearing. By the way, 
all of this is recorded. What I am say-
ing to you now was being recorded. I 
have the recording. 
They were moved by what was said, 
and they were wanting more answers. 
This officer told them that this is how 
it happened. Maybe not in these exact 
words, but Ms. Beary quotes him as 
saying: ‘‘This is how it happened,’’ and 
there is ‘‘no reason to believe it hap-
pened any other way.’’ 
Well, let’s examine that statement, 
‘‘no reason to believe it happened any 
other way.’’ The officer investigating 
said this without the benefit of a body 
camera, unlike the George Floyd case 
where there were multiple cameras, 
and we saw different angles. No body 
camera; no camera recording by some-
one who was a witness standing by; no 
camera available to the officer who 
now, within a few hours at most, is giv-
ing this rendition of what happened to 
their son. 
He said what he said without the ben-
efit of speaking to a medical examiner. 
The medical examiner had not arrived. 
He came to his conclusions without the 
benefit of what would ordinarily be an 
autopsy that would be performed at a 
later time. No autopsy had been per-
formed, so he couldn’t have come to 
these conclusions after perusing an au-
topsy report. 
He came to these conclusions with-
out speaking to the officer who shot 
her son. No autopsy report; no ballis-
tics report; no conversation with the 
medical examiner; no body camera. 
But he indicated that ‘‘this is how it 
happened,’’ and there is ‘‘no reason to 
believe it happened any other way.’’ No 
other way? 
You haven’t had a conversation with 
a 
medical 
examiner. 
You 
haven’t 
talked to the person who actually did 
the shooting. You have no body cam-
era. No other way? 
You have no ballistics report. No 
other way? 
That story became the actual story 
that has been published and repub-
lished, and it causes great grief for this 
family because they believe that there 
has to be a better investigation, that 
this officer was too quick to draw these 
conclusions. 
In court, we call these things a rush 
to judgment, a rush to judgment with-
in just a few hours, without having 
completed an investigation. 
He didn’t do a walkthrough, hadn’t 
done the walkthrough. For those who 
may 
not 
be 
familiar 
with 
walkthroughs, this is where the officer 
gets with the person involved, the offi-
cer who was in the car, and they walk 
through and point out certain things 
that may have happened. He couldn’t 
have had the walkthrough because he 
didn’t talk to the officer who did the 
shooting. 
The family, desperate for help, fi-
nally contacted my office. I was, quite 
frankly, amazed myself when I heard 
the recording of this officer who was 
investigating. 
By the way, before we go any further, 
I need to say this: This is not an indict-
ment of all police officers, not an in-
dictment of all peace officers. We are 
talking about a circumstance that hap-
pened in my congressional district. 
So, they came to me, and I decided 
that I would, at a very minimum, go 
out and see what they were trying to 
call to my attention. 
I was a judge for a quarter of a cen-
tury of a lowly justice/small claims 
court. I was known to go out and look 
at things, to go to the scene of things 
that occurred, so I went. Thank God I 
did. 
After going out to the actual site, 
things became even more murky. I was 
there, getting an understanding as to 
where the officer was supposed to have 
been at the time the encounter with 
their son took place. The son is Josh-
ua, and I am not going to call the name 
of the officer who did the shooting. At 
the time the encounter took place and 
the shooting occurred, it became dif-
ficult to comprehend some evidence 
that was found in a location many feet 
away, over behind some cars, near a ga-
rage, across a street, behind not one, 
not two, but three cars. 
It became difficult to understand how 
this piece of evidence was at this loca-
tion, difficult to understand because 
the piece of evidence was a bullet, a 
bullet that was fired from the shooter’s 
weapon, made its way to this very dif-
ficult location, hit the garage, and 
bounced off onto the pavement. 
This was found the same day that the 
investigation was taking place. It is 
difficult to comprehend how it got 
there, given the angles involved and 
the location of the garage. It is dif-
ficult to understand. 
Later on, after talking to more peo-
ple, we concluded that it would be ap-
propriate to ask the sheriff for a visit. 
The sheriff was very generous with his 
time. He did visit with the family, and 
he brought others with him, another 
person with him. They had a visit.

April 22, 2021 
We talked, and the sheriff gave assur-
ances that there would be a thorough 
investigation. 
After having that conversation with 
the sheriff, something else was discov-
ered. This family had a camera. We 
didn’t know about the camera at the 
time they heard from the initial officer 
who was investigating. 
So, there is a camera that monitors 
the street that runs past their home. 
This camera picked up what appears to 
be the shooting officer, who was under-
cover, parked on the street. It picked 
him up as he left the scene. This is im-
portant. 
Their son is shot twice. Apparently, 
based upon what has been said and 
what the evidence seems to reveal, he 
walked away after he was hit twice. He 
went over to a car, his car, parked 
some feet away. He made his way into 
his car, sat on the driver’s side, under 
the steering wheel. Apparently, having 
done this—this is, without question, he 
did these things. Apparently, he is shot 
twice. The officer drives away after 
shooting him twice. He leaves the 
scene, and the person shot, to go out to 
some other location. 
Now, if this is true—and I say ‘‘ap-
parently’’ because you look at the cars 
and then you have to draw conclusions. 
But if this is true, what kind of offi-
cer—assuming that all of what he said 
was the case, do you really leave the 
scene? Do you leave a person who is 
armed, if you believe the person to be 
armed? Do you leave this person who 
you believe to be armed to be out, such 
that someone else might be harmed? 
There are a lot of questions to be an-
swered. 
b 1415 
There a lot of questions to be an-
swered. The family needs to know. I 
have some of the questions that the 
family would like to have answers to. I 
am going to share a few of these ques-
tions with you because it is a year 
later. They have not had any indica-
tion that they will receive justice in 
the near future, perhaps, but not the 
kind of indication that they are look-
ing for. 
Here is a question: How could an in-
vestigating officer present an accurate 
assessment of the facts to Mr. and Mrs. 
Beary, near the scene, within a few 
hours after Joshua, their son, was 
killed, before having done the walk- 
through, without talking to the deputy 
who did the shooting, without the ben-
efit of a camera recording, before the 
medical examiner examined the body 
of their son, before an autopsy report 
was completed, and, in fact, an autopsy 
was performed, before a ballistics re-
port was produced? How could he 
present an accurate assessment? 
And this assessment has been pub-
lished and republished many times. 
Second question: How did the bullet 
hit this garage of the neighbor across 
the street with no clear path from 
where the shooter indicated the shoot-
ing took place or where it was indi-
cated by someone that the shooting 
took place? 
Third question: Why would the dep-
uty leave the scene immediately or 
sometime shortly after firing those 
shots? 
This is a questionable circumstance. 
It is not comparable to what happened 
to George Floyd. 
And the question that we are going 
to have to grapple with is: What hap-
pens when the cameras are off and no 
witnesses are available, and you have 
evidence that seems to contradict the 
story of the investigating officer, that 
was given before he had an opportunity 
to perform a fair and accurate inves-
tigation? 
What happens when you don’t have 
what we have in the George Floyd 
case? 
Notwithstanding all that we had in 
the George Floyd case, I don’t know of 
a single person who thought that there 
would be a guilty, guilty, guilty; who 
thought that the officer would be found 
guilty on all three of the charges. I 
don’t know of a single person. Perhaps 
you do. 
But notwithstanding all of the evi-
dence that we saw, all of the testimony 
that we heard, there were people—I was 
among them—who literally had great 
concern for what the verdict would be 
and how it would be responded to. I had 
my concerns. I think they were legiti-
mate concerns to have in this case, 
given our history in the case of ques-
tionable shootings, police-civilian en-
counters, and a person ends up losing 
his life. 
I heard the verdict with my col-
leagues right here on campus in this fa-
cility, and I believed it after a moment 
of disbelief. It wasn’t something that 
you just automatically, axiomatically 
believe. But it was something that I be-
lieved, but I had a moment of disbelief. 
But I knew that verdict could be a sem-
inal moment in time that will impact 
the rest of time. 
I believe that those jurors will be 
treated very kindly by history. I think 
that history is going to show that they 
were people who rose to the occasion. 
Jurors do this, they can rise to the oc-
casion. These did, and I am grateful to 
them. 
I believe that those officers who tes-
tified rose to the occasion. They sepa-
rated themselves from that which is 
perceived to be egregious, and that is 
being kind, but they separated them-
selves from that conduct. History will 
be kind to them. 
But there was overwhelming evi-
dence, and we know what happened 
with overwhelming evidence. This case 
has not been ruled upon or judged by a 
grand jury, and, as a result, we don’t 
know what will happen. All we know is 
that this family is still grieving. It has 
been a year since their son lost his 
life—a year today, around 6 a.m.—and 
they are still waiting for a decision. 
I have some concerns now about the 
decision. Hear my concerns. 
Let us assume that it goes before a 
grand jury, this case. When I say ‘‘it,’’ 
I mean this case goes before a grand 
jury. And let’s assume that it results in 
a no bill, the grand jury does not in-
dict. It does not return a true bill, 
which would be an indictment. Let’s 
assume this is a no bill in this case. 
What happens before the grand jury 
stays with the grand jury. This family 
won’t have answers. 
There was supposed to be a ballistics 
report. 
Will they have the opportunity to 
read the ballistics report? 
I hope so. But the grand jury works 
in secrecy. It is shrouded in secrecy. 
And I am not antithetical to grand ju-
ries. But my point is, will this family 
get answers if there is a no bill? 
The system has got to change. You 
cannot leave a family under these cir-
cumstances with more questions than 
answers after the case has made its 
way through the judicial system. You 
can’t leave them like this. They will 
suffer the rest of their lives. They have 
got to know what happened. 
The system has to change. There has 
to be a way for these families to know 
more about what happened when the 
cameras are off and no witnesses are 
available. There has to be a way for 
them to at least know what happens 
when the case is presented. 
They are not allowed to be there 
when the grand jury deliberates. I am 
not going to quarrel with this. I under-
stand that grand jurors have a right, to 
some degree, of protection because 
what they do can bring harm to them. 
But what I don’t understand is why we 
don’t have a system that allows for the 
evidence to be made available to people 
who have lost someone near and dear, 
someone that they love. 
In Texas, there is another way that 
would be perceived as novel. It is only 
in Texas, by the way. Only in Texas. 
There is something called a court of in-
quiry. In Texas, if you believe that a 
crime has been committed, you can 
take your evidence to a district court 
judge, and you can ask that judge to 
review what you have. And if that 
judge believes that there may have 
been a crime committed, that judge 
would go to an administrative judge. 
We will call this person a presiding 
judge. And then that judge can re-
quire—that second judge—so you have 
two judges involved—happens to con-
cur. And then witnesses can be called, 
and we can examine what happened. 
But this is only in Texas. 
I am looking at legislation to give us 
the opportunity at a national level to 
do something similar to what we can 
do in Texas, because people need to 
know. These parents would feel much 
better and get through the grieving 
process, something that we all will go 
through at some point in our lives if we 
live long enough. It would give them— 
if they had the transparency, if they 
could just know what was said, what 
was the decision really based upon if 
there is not a true bill, an indictment. 
They need to know. 
But they represent many other fami-
lies who have circumstances where

they have lost someone; questionable 
circumstances, no camera, no wit-
nesses; and in some cases where there 
are witnesses who are not believed; in 
some cases where the camera reveals 
what others would have us not believe 
when we see it with our own eyes. 
There are some cases where we have 
had video, but we are told that we can’t 
believe our eyes. 
Thank God the jurors in the George 
Floyd case believed their eyes, believed 
what they saw, believed those officers 
who gave testimony. 
I hope that we will, at some point in 
our history, reach a time when we 
won’t have a Member of Congress have 
to engage with family members under 
these circumstances, but some things 
have to change before we will get to 
this time. 
One of the things that will have to 
change is a belief that has been called 
to our attention by some people who 
have been demeaned and vilified. And 
the belief is that Black lives matter. 
This is a powerful movement. 
Are there some persons who associate 
with the movement who may have done 
some things that I don’t approve of? 
Yes, many have. 
But this is a powerful movement. We 
have got to have persons who are 
armed, those who have the power of life 
and death, believe that Black lives 
matter. We have got to have them be-
lieve that you don’t have the right to 
punish a person after you have arrested 
the person. 
Notwithstanding what you heard a 
former President say, you don’t have 
the right to punish after you have ar-
rested. And you know he said it. 
b 1430 
He told peace officers—I like peace 
officer as opposed to police—when you 
are arresting a person you don’t have 
to be nice. 
Madam Speaker, once you have a per-
son within your care, custody, and con-
trol, that person’s well-being is in your 
hands. You don’t have the power or the 
right to punish them. You may have 
the power, but you don’t have the right 
to. You don’t punish 9 minutes and 29 
seconds, a knee on a neck—cruel and 
unusual punishment. You don’t have 
the right to do this. You may have the 
power, but you don’t have the right. If 
Black lives matter, then you wouldn’t 
do it. 
Not all police officers—not all peace 
officers—I prefer peace officer to po-
lice—not all, but those who do have to 
be punished, because we have got to let 
the world know that Black lives mat-
ter and that you have got to treat peo-
ple with the same level of dignity and 
respect that you want your child to re-
ceive and that you want your mother 
to receive, the same level of dignity 
and respect because Black lives mat-
ter. 
I will be with the Bearys this week-
end. There will be a vigil in Houston, 
and I will be there with them. My hope 
is that we will have heard something 
about their son’s demise from the offi-
cials who are charged with the respon-
sibility and an obligation to perform a 
just and fair investigation. My hope is 
that this will happen and that they 
will have some closures. 
Madam Speaker, I want Mr. and Mrs. 
Beary to know that I am never going 
to give up on this. Their son’s life 
mattered to me. I never met him, but 
his life mattered. I will be with them. 
I will be with them until the end. His 
life mattered. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

THE CRISIS AT THE SOUTHERN 
BORDER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Florida (Mr. C. SCOTT 
FRANKLIN) for 30 minutes. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent that all Members may have 5 leg-
islative days in order to revise and ex-
tend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
KELLY). 
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, this has been a confusing 
time period I think for most of Amer-
ica, and why the confusion is becoming 
so cluttered among us all is because we 
are using definitions that sometimes 
don’t seem to make sense for the situa-
tion that we are in. 
So I was thinking back, and not too 
long ago we were told that we don’t 
have to worry about our borders be-
cause we really don’t have a crisis 
there, what we have is a challenge. 
As we seem to constantly redefine or 
put different labels on what we know 
to be true, I think it is time for a mo-
ment of clarity. I went to Oxford Lan-
guages to find out just what a crisis is. 
So this is not my definition. This is 
what Oxford Languages has said: A cri-
sis is a time of intense difficulty or 
trouble or danger; a time when a dif-
ficult or important decision must be 
made. 
So what is it I am talking about? 
I am talking about our crisis at our 
borders. 
So why would a guy who lives in 
western 
Pennsylvania 
worry 
about 
what is happening on the borders in 
Texas and Arizona? That is almost 2,000 
miles away from where I live. That is 
almost 2,000 miles away from the peo-
ple I represent. How could it possibly 
impact them? 
So I would tell my friends that if you 
don’t think this is going to have an im-
pact in the community you live in, this 
is coming to a town real close to you 
real soon. 
In Erie, Pennsylvania, we are now 
housing about 150 young girls who have 
come from the border. Now, I don’t 
know where their starting point was. I 
know where their entry came, and I 
know now that these unaccompanied 
young ladies—they are 7 to 12 years 
old—have now been shuttled to Erie, 
Pennsylvania, into housing which is 
much better than what they were expe-
riencing at the border. They are living 
there now, and I am not sure that they 
know what the consequences of this re-
location means to them. 
I have been told that of those people 
who have come in, those little girls 
who have come in, approximately 30 of 
them have COVID. 
We sit in this House—the people’s 
House—and we debate issues that are 
sometimes very confusing and very 
conflicting and separate us as a people. 
This is not an issue that should sepa-
rate us. If we truly believe that there is 
a humanitarian crisis, then we should 
fix it in a humanitarian way. 
I have often been told that you can’t 
beat something with nothing. The pre-
vious administration under President 
Trump had a very clear policy about 
how we were supposed to handle the 
surge at our borders, a very clear proc-
ess, very clear what was to take place. 
That all changed. As the Biden admin-
istration came in, they said, no, this 
policy from the previous administra-
tion is untenable, it is not humane, and 
it is no longer going to be in existence. 
Again, Madam Speaker, you can’t re-
place something with nothing. My 
question to the administration through 
several letters and through several re-
quests for the HHS and the Office of 
Refugee Resettlement, was answered 
with no answer at all. So if you have no 
policy you have no answer. 
If you continue to say that we really 
don’t have a crisis at our border, then 
you are either unaware or just choose 
not to say what you really have in 
mind, and you can only do that if you 
don’t really have anything in mind. 
Madam Speaker, I think that in the 
people’s House—and we are always de-
fined as who is in the majority and who 
is in the minority and who represents 
whom and whose best interests are 
being upheld, and I would just suggest 
that this is the people’s House. It is not 
called the Republic House or the Demo-
crat House. It is called the people’s 
House, and the people—the American 
people—need to have an answer to 
what is our policy on the border? 
What is our policy going forward? 
How are we going to relocate these 
children? 
They are children. My wife and I 
being the mother and father of four 
children and grandparents of 10 chil-
dren, I cannot imagine in my life hand-
ing over my grandchildren or my chil-
dren to somebody I don’t know and 
saying: Would you please get them to 
America where I know they will be 
safe, sound, and well-treated? 
This is truly a crisis. More impor-
tantly, this is a dereliction of duty by

the current administration. I am re-
questing that the Biden administration 
answer not just me from western Penn-
sylvania, the 16th Congressional Dis-
trict, but the people of America who 
deserve to know what this policy is, 
how it is going to be administered, and 
what do these contracts look like when 
we are transporting these children 
from one location to another, and, ulti-
mately, where are they supposed to 
land? 
Where are they supposed to find ref-
uge? 
Where are they supposed to find a 
loving family to take care of them? 
I have been told that 90 percent of 
these 
unaccompanied 
children 
are 
going to end up with family members, 
and my question is: Where did you col-
lect that data? 
I have granddaughters who were 12, 
and I have granddaughters who were 7. 
I think it would be a difficult question 
to ask them what their future looks 
like whenever they have been shuttled 
off to someplace far away from home 
by people they don’t know and then 
being told: Don’t worry, everything is 
going to be fine, and 90 percent of you 
are going to end up with a family mem-
ber. 
Really? 
Where is that data? 
I will close with this—and I really ap-
preciate the gentleman yielding—it is 
time for Americans to stand up and de-
mand that we have an answer to what 
our policy is at our border. 
What are we going to do with these 
children? 
If we are truly calling this a humani-
tarian crisis, then we need to have a 
humanitarian answer. No answer, no 
process absolutely is not the way 
America works. 
So I am calling on the administra-
tion today to please answer our ques-
tions. I will be in Erie, Pennsylvania, 
on Saturday where I will be able to 
physically examine where these chil-
dren are, and I will come back to Con-
gress with what I have seen happen. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for yielding. 
Mr. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. 
Madam Speaker, I also rise to address 
the self-inflicted disaster occurring at 
our southern border. I, along with nine 
other Republicans in the House Over-
sight and Reform Committee, visited 
the border last week to see for our-
selves the national security and hu-
manitarian disaster that is wreaking 
havoc on our Nation. 
When our Border Patrol agents are 
pulled from their posts to deal with the 
swarms of children at processing facili-
ties, the remote border is left wide- 
open for the really bad folks to stroll 
right in. These aren’t people whom we 
see on television wearing Biden T- 
shirts, looking for the nearest Border 
Patrol agent so they can surrender to 
them. These are folks in full camou-
flage, ski masks, and usually armed, 
often with automatic weapons. 
These intruders who breach the re-
mote parts of the border illegally are 
referred to as get-aways. Because our 
agents are outnumbered, usually all 
they can do is simply document these 
groups as they pass on by. The nota-
tion for the records is simply 20 plus, 
even though there are often 40, 60, or 
even 80 or more people. 
In January and February alone, there 
were over 61,000 reported get-aways. 
That is a staggering amount, but be-
cause the 20-plus documentation gross-
ly underestimates the actual figures, 
agents told us the real number for the 
first 2 months of this year was prob-
ably closer to 120,000. 
Left unchecked, we are looking at 
750,000 get-aways breaking into our 
country this year alone. Again, these 
are not asylum seekers surrendering at 
the border. They are dangerous crimi-
nals, drug smugglers, human traf-
fickers, and terrorists who are willing 
to do anything to get into America and 
not be caught. Once they make it to 
Interstate 10, just a few miles north of 
the border, they can have easy access 
to any place in the country. 
This isn’t a border State problem. It 
is an unfolding national disaster of un-
precedented scope that must be ad-
dressed for the security of our country. 
Yet the Biden administration and my 
colleagues across the aisle refuse to 
even acknowledge the problem. So far, 
neither the President nor Vice Presi-
dent have bothered to visit the border. 
We can stop this manufactured crisis. 
First, we need to complete the border 
wall. We have construction materials 
laying idle in the desert. President 
Biden used to think the border wall 
was a good idea. It is time he stops 
cowing to the radical elements within 
his own party and do what he knows is 
right. The materials are there and the 
contracts to complete the work are in 
place, just sitting there. Just finish the 
job. 
Second, end the practice of catch and 
release and re-implement the Migrant 
Protection Protocols that proved so 
successful in reducing the number of 
border incursions. Officers shared with 
us that only 10 to 12 percent of people 
who come here seeking asylum have le-
gitimate cases. The rest are sent back. 
By requiring them to remain in Mexico 
while their asylum requests are adju-
dicated, roughly 90 percent who know 
their cases are bogus won’t risk the 
journey, and those who do have legiti-
mate causes to seek asylum will have 
it granted more expeditiously. That 
would be the humane course of action. 
We are, indeed, a nation of immi-
grants. Many industries in my home 
State of Florida, including agriculture, 
hospitality, and construction, depend 
on a steady flow of legal immigrants in 
order to function. But for America to 
remain the world’s brightest beacon of 
hope, we must acknowledge that a fun-
damental part of what makes it so at-
tractive is our adherence to the rule of 
law. 
Honest, law-abiding citizens like the 
Johnsons, the Coopers, and others we 
met at the border asked us to tell their 
story. They are not confident, though, 
that we will. They also want our gov-
ernment to know that they aren’t 
looking 
for 
special 
consideration. 
These are tough people who simply 
want the opportunity to live and work 
their land in peace and security with-
out having to live in fear. They want to 
know that we will not forget about 
them. We promised to share their 
story. We must not let them down. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

H2003 
COMMEMORATING 46TH 
ANNIVERSARY OF BLACK APRIL 
Mrs. STEEL asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Mrs. STEEL. Madam Speaker, today 
I rise to commemorate the 46th anni-
versary of Black April. 
April 30, 1975, marked the fall of Sai-
gon and the end of the Vietnam war. 
Many Vietnamese Americans who were 
alive during the war remember this as 
the day that signified the loss of a 
country they once called home. 
The people left everything they knew 
to flee communism. Hundreds of thou-
sands of Vietnamese people have reset-
tled in the United States and built vi-
brant communities here. California’s 
48th District is the proud home of Lit-
tle Saigon, which is home to more Vi-
etnamese Americans than anywhere 
else in the United States. 
On Black April, I will join the Viet-
namese Americans in our community 
and around the country in honoring 
those who served in Vietnam, and 
those who lost their lives attempting 
to flee Communist rule.

Vol. 167 
WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, APRIL 22, 2021 
No. 70 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. LEAHY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, nature speaks of Your 
glory. With every sunrise and sunset, 
we are reminded of Your power and 
majesty. 
Lord, we think of You when we watch 
the birds You guide through the bound-
less skies with flawless flight. We hear 
Your voice in the pattern of the falling 
rain and the shouts of the thunder. 
Great and marvelous are Your works. 
Today, rule in the lives of our law-
makers with the sovereignty You hold 
over nature. Guide our Senators with 
Your perfect and trustworthy precepts, 
bringing joy to their hearts because of 
Your love. 
We pray in Your mighty Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Nevada. 
Ms. ROSEN. Mr. President, I suggest 
the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.

f 
COVID–19 HATE CRIMES ACT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
after nearly 2 weeks of Democrats and 
Republicans 
working 
together, 
the 
Senate is going to take a final vote on 
the anti-Asian hate crimes bill later 
this morning. The vote today on the 
anti-Asian hate crimes bill is proof 
that when the Senate is given the op-
portunity to work, the Senate can 
work to solve important issues. 
In the wake of the COVID–19 pan-
demic, Asian Americans across the 
country have been victims of the surge 
of discrimination and racially moti-
vated violence and bigotry. In New 
York, I attended rally after rally and 
heard one story after another about 
Asian Americans who were afraid to 
ride the subway, afraid to go to work, 
afraid to walk down the streets, and 
having to adjust their daily lives for 
fear of being spat upon, glared at, or 
even worse. This was not an occasional 
occurrence. It is occurring every day in 
just about every corner of America. 
Now, racism has always existed in 
America, unfortunately and sadly, and 
the legacy of anti-Asian sentiment 
goes back centuries to dark chapters in 
our history like the Chinese Exclusion 
Act and the internment of Japanese- 
American citizens during World War II. 
Now, we have made great strides 
since those days, but over the past sev-
eral years, the forces of hate and big-
otry seemed to have gained strength, 
too often encouraged by our former 
President. It is time for all of us to 
stand up. 
By passing this bill, the Senate 
makes it very clear that hate and dis-
crimination against any group has no 
place in America. Bigotry against one 
is bigotry against all, and I believe 
that passage of this bill will send two— 
two—very important messages. 
One important message is to the 
Asian-American community. By pass-
ing this bill, we say to the Asian-Amer-
ican community that their government 
is paying attention to them, has heard 
their concerns, and will respond to pro-
tect them; and, second, by passing this 
bill, we will send a message to the 
country that should be all too obvious 
by now. Hate crimes will not be toler-
ated, and Federal law enforcement will 
do everything in its power to detect, 
deter, and, if necessary, prosecute 
crimes to the full extent of the law. 
So this bill has a one-two punch, to 
assure the Asian-American community 
we are going after the bigotry against 
them and to tell the American people, 
particularly those bigots, we are going 
after you in a legal way, of course. 
Now, yesterday, we reached an agree-
ment to consider three more Repub-
lican amendments to the bill before a 
final vote. The legislation, as is, al-
ready includes significant bipartisan 
input, including modifications from 
Senator COLLINS and bipartisan legisla-
tion called the No Hate Act developed 
by Senators MORAN and BLUMENTHAL 
and modified by Senator SCOTT of Flor-
ida. Senator WARNOCK has also made 
sure the bill recognizes the recent trag-
edy in Atlanta in which six women of 
Asian descent were killed. 
Through it all, Senators DURBIN, 
DUCKWORTH, and especially the bill’s 
sponsor, Senator HIRONO, have dem-
onstrated exceptional leadership; the 
same for Representative MENG in the 
House. 
Over the past 6 years, we have had 
too few opportunities to work together 
on timely, bipartisan legislation. Let 
this be a reminder that when Senators 
of good will work with each other, at 
the end of the day, we can achieve a 
good result. We can do it again in the 
next few weeks with a bipartisan water 
infrastructure bill, which will be on the 
floor next week, and soon thereafter, 
another bipartisan package of legisla-
tion concerning American competitive-
ness.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2138 
April 22, 2021 
Let’s continue the bipartisan mo-
mentum as we move into next week, 
but today I want to thank my col-
leagues who have worked together to 
bring this bill to the finish line. I look 
forward to seeing the anti-Asian hate 
crimes bill passed by this Chamber 
today and move one step closer to 
reaching the President’s desk. 
f 
WASHINGTON, D.C. ADMISSION ACT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, on 
DC statehood, another matter, today 
the House of Representatives will pass 
a bill granting the District of Columbia 
official statehood. I applaud my House 
Democratic colleagues for taking this 
important step toward recognizing the 
full citizenship of more than 700,000 
residents of the District of Columbia. 
This is a matter of just representa-
tion. Our system of government is de-
signed to give everyone in our country 
a voice in forging their own destiny. 
Most citizens do that by voting for 
Members of Congress and Senators 
from their States to represent them in 
this temple of democracy to advocate 
for their interests and to voice their 
concerns. 
The District of Columbia has more 
residents than Vermont and Wyoming 
and nearly the same as Delaware, Alas-
ka, and several other States, and they 
bear the full responsibilities and duties 
of citizenship, like residents in all 
those other States. DC residents can be 
summoned for jury duty. They have 
served in every war since the American 
Revolution. They pay Federal income 
taxes, just like residents from every 
other State. You can learn that from 
any license plate outside this building. 
Yet they are denied real representation 
in Congress—in the words DC borrowed 
from the Founding Fathers, ‘‘taxation 
without representation.’’ 
Sadly, the debate over DC statehood 
has taken a rather dark turn. Some of 
my colleagues on the other side, rather 
than fashion any argument on the mer-
its, have taken to denigrating the basic 
worth of residents of the District of Co-
lumbia—a part of our country that is 47 
percent African American. 
One Member of the minority party 
went so far as to say lawmakers should 
‘‘go out to where the real people are 
across the country and ask them what 
they think [about DC statehood].’’ 
‘‘[Get] out to where the real people 
are.’’ 
Bigotry, 
bigotry, 
bigotry. 
I 
shouldn’t have to remind my col-
leagues that it is shockingly inappro-
priate to imply that lives and occupa-
tions and rights of DC’s residents are 
somehow less than their fellow citizens 
in other ‘‘more real’’ and almost al-
ways more White parts of the country. 
We all know that the minority party 
opposes DC statehood because it fears 
giving political power and representa-
tion to American citizens if they might 
not vote for Republicans. It smacks of 
the effort going on right now in Repub-
lican legislatures all across the coun-
try to pass laws that overwhelmingly 
make it harder for minorities, poorer 
Americans, and younger Americans to 
vote. 
The far right, the hard right—which 
seems to be so dominant in the party 
on the other side—is so afraid of losing 
political power and so unwilling to ap-
peal to anyone who doesn’t already 
agree with them that their strategy 
has become to restrict voting rights 
and deny equal representation in Con-
gress to hundreds of thousands of 
Americans. So DC statehood, unfortu-
nately, is part of a continuing thread 
of not allowing people their right to 
vote, to representation, that seems to 
be growing in the Republican Party, 
particularly here in the Senate and in 
legislatures throughout the country, 
unfortunately. 
Self-government, 
voting 
rights: 
These are not Democratic rights. These 
are not Republican rights. They are 
American rights. They are issues of 
fairness and democracy. It is not about 
right and left; it is about right and 
wrong. 
DC statehood is an idea whose time 
has come. 
f 
CLIMATE LEGISLATION 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
now on climate, this year’s celebration 
of Earth Day comes with an ambitious 
new goal from the Biden administra-
tion: The United States should aim to 
cut its greenhouse gas emissions in 
half by the end of the decade. It is a 
great goal. I fully support it. 
Not only is President Biden finally 
returning the United States to a posi-
tion of global leadership in the fight 
against climate change, but he is show-
ing that America is ready to ramp up 
our 
climate 
ambition 
beyond—be-
yond—the Paris Agreement. 
Now, it will take extraordinary ac-
tion to meet the marker that President 
Biden laid down, but he was exactly 
right to do it. If we need any reminders 
about what America can achieve when 
it puts its mind to something, Presi-
dent Kennedy committed to landing on 
the Moon over the course of a single 
decade. If America could reach that 
lofty goal in the name of ingenuity, in 
the name of exploration, surely we can 
achieve this goal in the name of saving 
the planet on which we live. 
Now, I believe the best way to 
achieve this ambitious goal is through 
bold action by this Congress through 
legislation to reduce carbon pollution 
while creating millions of jobs and eco-
nomic prosperity in a new clean energy 
economy. Any legislation without a se-
rious and bold climate component will 
make it much, much harder to achieve 
President Biden’s goal, and we must 
work to have a strong green climate 
component in the American Jobs Plan. 
The Democratic majority here in the 
Senate is eager to get to work. One of 
the very first things I did when Demo-
crats took the majority was to instruct 
every committee chair—the new com-
mittee chairs—to hold hearings on the 
climate crisis to begin preparing for 
landmark legislation. I repeat once 
again that any infrastructure bill we 
consider here in the Senate must in-
clude 
green 
infrastructure, 
create 
green 
jobs, 
and 
make 
significant 
progress toward the reduction of green-
house gases. 
Luckily, the Senate will have an op-
portunity to address another serious 
climate-related issue next week. The 
Senate will consider a Congressional 
Review Act bill before the end of the 
work period to reimpose critical regu-
lations concerning the release of meth-
ane into our atmosphere. 
Methane gets less attention than its 
big bad brother, carbon dioxide, but in 
truth, methane is like carbon dioxide 
on steroids. Over 20 years, a ton of 
methane will warm the atmosphere 
more than 86 times as much as a ton of 
carbon dioxide, but because it breaks 
down much faster than carbon dioxide, 
the gains we make in the reduction of 
methane emissions can reduce global 
warming even faster. Many of the 
things we need to do to reduce methane 
emissions are fairly cheap and cost-ef-
fective, like plugging leaks in fossil 
fuel infrastructure. So this made com-
mon sense, especially when our globe is 
at risk. 
The Obama administration had insti-
tuted these commonsense rules of the 
road to encourage that sort of activity. 
It was widely supported, even by indus-
try. The Trump administration, so 
typically and so unfortunately, re-
versed those rules in an act of pure idi-
ocy. The Senate Democratic majority 
will soon put a bill on the floor to re-
vert back to the original policy, which 
should never have been tampered with 
in the first place. 
Reducing methane emissions will be 
only the first of many actions this Sen-
ate 
will 
take 
to 
combat 
climate 
change. 
f 
ARMENIAN GENOCIDE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
one final issue. It has come to my at-
tention that President Biden intends to 
have the United States formally recog-
nize the Armenian genocide, becoming 
the first sitting U.S. President to do 
so. Great news. It is a long time com-
ing and a step that I have called on 
Presidents of both parties to take. 
Each year, I gather with Armenian 
Americans in Times Square to com-
memorate the annual anniversary of 
this atrocity. Every year, my heart 
breaks for the victims of the genocide 
and their descendants. There are very 
few left, but some very elderly people 
are sitting in the audience each year, 
reminding us how painful and how real 
that genocide was. The Turkish Gov-
ernment’s idea of saying there was no 
genocide just defies history. I have 
seen the victims. I have talked to the 
victims. 
Saturday marks the 106th anniver-
sary of the Armenian genocide. I am so 
relieved, grateful, and moved that we

CLIMATE LEGISLATION 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
yesterday, I mentioned that the DNA 
of the far-left Green New Deal is all 
over President Biden’s spending bills. 
That wasn’t just my opinion; it was the 
verdict of our colleague the junior Sen-
ator from Massachusetts. 
Today, the President is scheduled to 
meet virtually with a group of the 
world’s leaders on climate policy. His 
agenda, reportedly, is to encourage 
them to expand their countries’ Paris 
climate agreement commitments to 
meet even more ambitious emissions 
goals. The problem, of course, as our 
colleagues, no doubt, remember, is that 
the hollow commitments these coun-
tries made back in 2015 carry no seri-
ous means for enforcement. 
Under the last administration, even 
from outside this agreement, the U.S. 
economy proved more than capable of 
meaningfully reducing CO2 emissions. 
But many of the signatories within the 
supposed deal have largely ignored 
their stated commitments and con-
tinue to emit with reckless abandon. 
As the Biden administration climate 
envoy, John Kerry, once lamented, 
‘‘[M]ost countries are . . . not getting 
the job done in living up to Paris.’’ 
China, for example, has just kept emit-
ting more and done it shamelessly. 
Their share of greenhouse gas emis-
sions is now nearly double—double— 
that of the United States. 
On a recent trip to Shanghai, Kerry 
tried to echo President Biden’s encour-
agement on emissions reduction, but 
the kid-gloves approach didn’t seem 
too successful. China’s Vice Minister 
for Foreign Affairs said: ‘‘I’m afraid 
this is not very realistic.’’ A direct 
quote from the Chinese Government. 
Democrats’ zeal for imposing costly 
environmental agendas on our own 
country is not something our biggest 
foreign competitors seem to share. If 
that is true, our colleagues could in-
flict as many painful policies on Amer-
ican workers and American industries 
as they want and still not achieve a 
significant change in worldwide emis-
sions or global temperatures. 
The cost of these misplaced priorities 
is already hitting Americans hard. Re-
member, revoking permitting for the 
Keystone XL Pipeline and killing thou-
sands of jobs was a day-one priority for 
this new administration. Now their so- 
called infrastructure plan would aim at 
completely decarbonizing our electric 
grid, which means hurting our coal and 
natural gas industries and putting 
good-paying American jobs into the 
shredder. 
Borrowing money in order to kill 
jobs, now, there is a concept. Mean-
while, a mountain of redtape would 
keep public works projects smothered, 
literally smothered in endless environ-
mental reviews, and their plan would 
thrust the west coast obsession with 
electric vehicles onto the entire Na-
tion, onto rural school districts, onto 
industries, whether they like it or not. 
Next week, President Biden is set to 
address a joint session of Congress for 
the first time. I expect we will hear 
more claims like the ones that have 
been debunked by fact checkers that 
all this Green New Deal DNA would ac-
tually create a lot of American jobs. 
Fact checkers are debunking that 
claim. 
But even the most favorable anal-
yses, even the administration’s favor-
ite projections, suggest that the Presi-
dent’s plan would be terrible, just ter-
rible at creating jobs. The rosiest num-
bers you could come up with suggest it 
might cost American taxpayers more 
than $800,000 for every job it might cre-
ate—more than $800,000 per job. 
And Ivy League economists have cal-
culated that the plan’s long-term ef-
fects on GDP, capital stocks, and hour-
ly wages would all be negative. Let me 
say that again. These multiple trillions 
of dollars would buy us less GDP, less 
investment, and lower wages. It almost 
takes talent to craft something that 
completely disastrous. 
So this is quite a one-two punch: 
toothless requests of our foreign adver-
saries and maximum pain for American 
citizens. 
f 
ELECTIONS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
now, on another matter, earlier this 
week, the Democratic leadership of the 
Judiciary Committee convened a hear-
ing with the embarrassing title of ‘‘Jim 
Crow 2021.’’ It was the latest effort to 
use shocking rhetoric to distract from 
the specific details of actual voting 
laws in States like Georgia. 
Amazingly, one of our Democratic 
colleagues testified before the com-
mittee that people actually shouldn’t 
bother combing through the specifics 
of the law—don’t bother reading the 
actual law. He suggested that ‘‘narrow 
analysis only obscures the larger, un-
mistakable picture.’’ Put another way, 
the facts deflate the narrative. 
Misrepresentations of Georgia’s elec-
tion law have been debunked by fact 
checkers. The real, unmistakable pic-
ture is that the bill would expand early 
voting and make no changes to current 
election day hours—none. Ironically, 
Democrats’ own star witness at this 
week’s hearing once sponsored and sup-
ported an earlier effort that would 
have cut early voting days in Georgia 
in half. 
The facts puncture the left’s big lie. 
Much of this overheated rhetoric seems 
like simple projection because there is, 
indeed, a piece of legislation that 
would create a stunning one-party 
takeover of voting laws and elections 
in our country, and that would be 
Washington Democrats’ darling, H.R. 1. 
This is the bill that was first intro-
duced back in 2019, with many Demo-
crats still in denial that a Republican 
had won the White House in 2016. 
It was marketed at that time as a 
wholesale transformation designed to 
salvage a broken democracy. But now 
that Democrats got an election out-
come they liked better in 2020, what is 
essentially a xerox copy of the same 
overhaul is now being marketed, oh, as 
a modest step, just a modest step to 
maintain the status quo. 
The first sales pitch was actually 
more honest. This 800-plus-page take-
over would give Washington Democrats 
unprecedented control over 50 States’ 
election laws, over a newly—listen to 
this—a newly partisan Federal Elec-
tion Commission, over policing Amer-
ica’s political speech. That is what it 
would do. 
Now, Democrats know that the same 
Senate rules they happily used for the 
last 6 years will not make it easy to 
launch this awful proposal, so there is 
another important piece in their plan. 
They are aiming the same wild rhetoric 
at the Senate’s own rules—at our rules 
here in the Senate. 
The legislative filibuster which sen-
ior Democrats have loudly and proudly 
defended in the past, which Democrats 
used repeatedly in recent years, all of a 
sudden has become an offensive and 
outdated relic overnight. Isn’t it amaz-
ing how this new awakening only hap-
pened when Democrats felt they had a 
chance to retake the majority. 
Now, the American people can see 
right through this. Nobody is fooled. 
Nobody is fooled by their desperation 
to rewrite 50 States’ election laws or 
the campaign to pack the Supreme 
Court or the attempt to pack the Sen-
ate with new blue States, rewriting the 
rules of American politics to exclu-
sively benefit one side: their side. That 
was the Democrats’ false charge in 
Georgia, but it is exactly what they are 
trying to do in this Capitol on a na-
tional scale.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
EARTH DAY 
Mr. 
DURBIN. 
Madam 
President, 
today is Earth Day, our planet’s larg-
est annual civic event. More than 1 bil-
lion people in 192 nations are expected 
to participate in activities to draw at-
tention to the urgency of the climate 
crisis and environmental degradation. 
From the South Side of Chicago to 
South America and South Asia, ordi-
nary 
citizens—schoolchildren, 
sci-
entists, environmental activists, busi-
ness and government leaders, and oth-
ers—are calling for help for our ailing 
planet. 
This year, the most important Earth 
Day gathering is just 16 blocks from 
where we meet. At the White House 
today, President Biden is hosting a 2- 
day virtual summit of leaders from 40 
Nations—leaders 
from 
the 
highest 
emitting countries, China, India, Rus-
sia, as well as leaders from countries 
that suffer the worst consequences, 
such as Bangladesh and Kenya. The 
leaders are coming together, after a 
year of staggering pandemic hardship 
and climate-related crises, to renew 
their commitment to save our planet 
from irreversible climate catastrophe. 
With this Earth Day Leaders Sum-
mit, President Biden is sending the 
world a clear message: The United 
States is back and is ready to be a 
leader again in combating climate 
change. The White House Leaders Sum-
mit is meant to encourage countries to 
make strong commitments under the 
Paris Agreement to prevent the global 
average temperature from rising more 
than 
1.5 
degree 
Celsius 
above 
preindustrial levels. This sounds tech-
nical and dry and wonky, but here is 
what it means. At 11⁄2 degrees Celsius of 
warming, much of the world will likely 
see sea level rise that swallows coast-
lines, leaves millions of homes under-
water, and produces recordbreaking 
droughts, floods, and other climate ca-
tastrophes. Hundreds of millions of 
people will be pushed into poverty be-
cause of this, and climate-related fam-
ine and conflicts would trigger a global 
refugee crisis worse than anything we 
have ever seen. That is the future if we 
do nothing. That is something we must 
avoid, and the United States needs to 
show leadership. 
President Biden does that today with 
this meeting. One of his first official 
acts as President, on his first full day 
in office, was starting the process of re-
committing the United States to join 
every nation in the world in the Paris 
Agreement. If you will remember, the 
previous President decided that Amer-
ica would step away from that. 
At the White House Leaders Summit, 
the President will announce a new 
goal: to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas 
emissions by at least 50 percent by the 
year 2030. The Biden administration’s 
leadership stands in sharp contrast to 
what we have seen over the last 4 
years. We saw a President withdraw 
from the Paris Agreement, ridicule 
science at every opportunity, deny the 
existence of a growing climate threat, 
and even censor the remarks of govern-
ment scientists that might suggest 
otherwise. 
Fortunately, the disengagement by 
the previous administration didn’t pre-
vent the American people, scientists, 
real 
business 
leaders 
and 
entre-
preneurs, and cities and States from ig-
noring President Trump and moving 
ahead. 
There is no substitute, though, for 
leadership at the top. The American 
Jobs Plan, which President Biden plans 
to pass, and I hope there is support, is 
a plan to secure America’s global eco-
nomic leadership, strengthen Amer-
ica’s working families, and build the 
infrastructure of the future we can 
count on. The American Jobs Plan, of 
course, will rebuild America’s crum-
bling rail lines, roads, bridges, ports, 
and water systems; strengthen Amer-
ica’s power grid; and invest in 5G 
broadband internet for every commu-
nity in America. The previous Presi-
dent promised it but didn’t deliver. 
This President wants to deliver, with 
our help. 
I have heard those on the floor who 
then criticize that part of the Amer-
ican Jobs Plan, which goes further. 
President Biden also wants to invest in 
green energy, wind, solar, and other re-
newable energy projects. To hear that 
described by some of his Republican 
critics, it is just pure socialism. Social-
ism? It is a realistic response to the 
21st challenge of climate change. The 
American Jobs Plan includes billions 
of dollars to retrain any workers who 
are dislocated if they work in the fossil 
fuel industry and to find better, well- 
paying jobs with a future in clean en-
ergy and other fields. Just this week, 
the president of the United Mine Work-
ers of America—a sixth generation

S2141 
April 22, 2021 
West Virginia coal miner—announced 
that his union was going to support 
President Biden’s American Jobs Plan 
in exchange for training his coal min-
ers in how they can be effective and 
also have good jobs in a cleaner energy 
future. That union understands clean 
energy. Most Americans do. I hope Sen-
ators on both sides of the aisle will. 
American business gets it. I have in-
troduced two bills that would bring ef-
ficiency and innovation of the market-
place and the financial clout of the 
Federal Government to reduce green-
house gas emissions and create a more 
sustainable economy that works for 
the people and the planet. My bills are 
called the America’s Clean Future 
Fund Act and the Climate Change Re-
siliency Fund for America Act. 
We talked about investing in Amer-
ican infrastructure so we can tackle 
climate change and create renewable 
energy jobs and the industries of the 
future. But I want to make it clear 
that our highest priority is to create 
those jobs right here in America. I 
hope my colleagues will work with us 
and won’t filibuster the President’s ef-
forts to move our economy forward in 
a dramatic way. 
We can’t afford denial, defeatism. We 
can’t afford people who say it is too 
late to do anything about climate dis-
aster. We owe it to our children, grand-
children, and future generations to do 
everything in our power to save this 
planet from what is obviously coming 
our way. 
Safe, effective vaccines have brought 
us so far in fighting this pandemic. We 
have developed in a short period of 
time under this President not only the 
vaccines but also their delivery and ad-
ministration to the people of our coun-
try at a rate no one ever expected. The 
research that led to this was good sci-
entific research. Two of the leading 
vaccines were developed using some-
thing called messenger RNA—mRNA— 
and it worked. The basic science that 
led to the discovery of mRNA was 
largely 
funded 
by 
American 
tax-
payers—government programs—and ap-
plied by the private industry with 
great success. And now, because of our 
investment in science and belief in 
science, people’s lives are being saved 
in the United States and around the 
world. Imagine solutions we can find if 
we harness the power of public partner-
ships together with science and citizen 
engagement to address climate change. 
The first Earth Day was 51 years ago. 
It was proposed by a Senator from Wis-
consin 
named 
Gaylord 
Nelson. 
It 
brought 20 million Americans together 
at the time, put preservation of our 
planet on the national agenda, and ush-
ered in a decade of remarkable environ-
mental progress. That decade saw the 
creation of some of our most important 
protections of clean air, land, and 
water. 
Ten years later, Gaylord Nelson 
looked back on that first Earth Day 
and the decade that followed. His words 
bear repeating today, And this is what 
he said: ‘‘So long as the human species 
inhabits the Earth, proper manage-
ment of its resources will be the most 
fundamental issue we face. Our very 
survival will depend upon whether or 
not we are able to preserve, protect, 
and defend our environment. We are 
not free to decide about whether or not 
our environment matters. It does mat-
ter. Apart from politics, it is funda-
mental to survival. We disregard the 
needs of our ecosystem at our mortal 
peril.’’ That was the lesson of Earth 
Day, and it should never be forgotten. 
S. 937 
Madam President, this morning, we 
are going to take up the COVID–19 
Hate Crimes Act that Senator HIRONO 
and Senator DUCKWORTH bring before 
us. 
In the wake of the COVID–19 pan-
demic, we have, unfortunately, wit-
nessed an appalling rise in hate inci-
dents targeting the Asian American 
and Pacific Islander community. The 
numbers are shocking. Between March 
2020 and February 2021, the Stop AAPI 
Hate 
Initiative 
documented 
nearly 
3,800 hate incidents in the United 
States, and a recent analysis by the 
Center for the Study of Hate and Ex-
tremism found that while hate crimes 
in 16 of America’s largest cities de-
creased overall by 7 percent in the year 
2020, those targeting Asian Americans 
increased by nearly 150 percent. 
Our friends and neighbors in the 
AAPI community are facing an urgent, 
imminent threat. It is time to do some-
thing about it. That is why I am proud 
to support the COVID–19 Hate Crimes 
Act. This will provide State and local 
law enforcement with guidance and 
tools to track and address hate crimes 
and hate incidents. 
I am grateful for the bipartisan sup-
port, which Senator COLLINS and others 
have brought to this bill to strengthen 
it. 
These 
efforts 
include 
Senator 
BLUMENTHAL’s and Senator MORAN’s 
NO HATE Act, critical legislation that 
will improve hate crime reporting and 
expand assistance and resources for 
victims of hate crimes. 
There is so much more we can do and 
should do to address the broader issue 
of domestic terrorism, identified by the 
Director of the FBI as one of the 
gravest threats to security in our coun-
try. That is why I introduced the Do-
mestic Terrorism Prevention Act ear-
lier this year, and I will continue with 
my efforts to send that legislation to 
the President’s desk. 
But today, we have an opportunity to 
come together—Democrats and Repub-
licans, Americans—and support our 
friends, our siblings, and our fellow 
Americans in the AAPI community. 
Millions of Americans count on us to 
do that. Let’s show them that we can. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MUR-
PHY). The Senator from Connecticut. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I 
am honored to follow our distinguished 
Judiciary Committee chairman and 
whip, Senator DURBIN, who has fought 
so hard for the principles and values 
that are embodied in the Jabara-Heyer 
NO HATE Act, which is part of the leg-
islation. It is, indeed, bipartisan, and, 
hopefully, we will pass it today. 
The fact is that this August marks 
two excruciatingly sad anniversaries. 
It will be 4 years since Heather Heyer 
was killed when a White nationalist 
drove his car into a crowd of peaceful 
protesters, and it will be 5 years since 
Khalid Jabara was shot and killed on 
his own front porch by his neighbor, an 
avowed and virulent racist. 
The temptation is to get lost in the 
numbers and statistics about hate 
crimes. Make no mistake, these statis-
tics are horrifying, especially the surge 
in hate crimes directed against Asian 
Americans and Pacific Islanders. 
The FBI reported just over 7,300 hate 
crimes in 2019. The Department of Jus-
tice’s Bureau of Justice Statistics esti-
mates that there was an average of 
198,000 hate crime victimizations in 
2017. Hate crimes are vastly under-
reported. One of the objectives of the 
Jabara-Heyer NO HATE Act is to spur 
greater reporting so we know the horri-
fying dimensions and magnitude of this 
problem and we can better fashion so-
lutions to fight them. 
But what is most important to re-
member about each of these 198,000 in-
cidents is that they involve real people, 
real communities, lives torn apart, 
communities torn asunder. In the most 
heartbreaking cases, they involve real 
lives that are lost forever, real families 
who will never see their loved ones 
again. 
The NO HATE Act that the Senate is 
considering today is named for two of 
those people: Heather Heyer and Khalid 
Jabara. For just a few moments, I 
would like to spend this time on the 
Senate floor honoring them and their 
families. We are here because of them. 
Heather Heyer was counterprotesting 
the Unite the Right rally in Char-
lottesville, VA, on August 12, 2019, 
when she was murdered by a White su-
premacist who purposefully ran his car 
into a crowd of protesters, also injur-
ing 19 other people. 
Heather is remembered as a young 
woman with a big heart. She devoted 
her life to the fight for justice and 
equality. The foundation named in her 
honor notes that ‘‘Heather was a young 
woman deeply involved in taking a 
stand against injustice when she didn’t 
have to do so,’’ who ‘‘spoke passion-
ately’’ about what she believed in. She 
was just 32 years old when she was 
murdered. 
Khalid Jabara was shot on the steps 
of his own home, his family’s home in 
Tulsa, OK, by a neighbor who had been 
harassing 
the 
Jabara 
family 
for 
months. That family had come to 
America to flee civil war and religious 
persecution in Lebanon, only to be ter-
rorized here by their racist, murderous 
next door neighbor. 
Khalid is remembered for his sense of 
humor and unfailing devotion to his 
family.

April 22, 2021 
He cared for our entire family, our friends, 
and people he didn’t even know. He created 
every Jabara family joke and filled their 
lives with love and laughter. 
Jabara was 37 years old when he was 
murdered. 
Today’s vote honors the memory of 
those two individuals and the thou-
sands of other individuals who have 
been victims of similar hate crimes— 
un-American, abhorrent, unacceptable. 
Today, we make a statement that we 
will not accept those kinds of hate 
crimes in America. 
I am grateful to the entire Jabara 
family and to Susan Bro, Heather’s 
mother, for their unfailing devotion to 
ending hate and their courageous advo-
cacy in support of the NO HATE Act. I 
also want to thank my partner in this 
legislation, Senator MORAN of Kansas. 
We would not be here today without 
his support and bipartisan cooperation 
on this bill. 
There will always be hateful people 
who want to lash out violently at the 
world. They will lash out at Muslims, 
at Jews, at African Americans, at 
Asian Americans, at Pacific Islanders. 
But America is above it. America is 
better than they are. And we owe 
Heather Heyer, Khalid Jabara, and 
every other victim of hate crimes— 
from the Orlando nightclub massacre 
to the shooting in El Paso—the kind of 
action we are taking today. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from South Dakota. 
BIPARTISANSHIP 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today we 
are wrapping up consideration of the 
COVID–19 Hate Crimes Act. Next week 
the majority leader has indicated the 
Senate will take up the Drinking 
Water and Wastewater Infrastructure 
Act of 2021. These are both bipartisan 
pieces of legislation. 
The COVID–19 Hate Crimes Act was 
an initially partisan bill that has now 
been improved by input from Repub-
licans and I expect will receive strong 
bipartisan support on final passage. 
The Drinking Water and Wastewater 
Infrastructure Act has been 100 percent 
bipartisan from the very beginning. 
Senators DUCKWORTH and CAPITO devel-
oped this legislation, along with Demo-
cratic Senators CARPER and CARDIN and 
Republican 
Senators 
LUMMIS
and 
CRAMER. The legislation went through 
regular committee consideration and 
was reported out of the Environment 
and Public Works Committee to the 
full Senate with a unanimous vote. It 
is a model of how we should work here 
in the Senate. 
Mr. President, after a very partisan 
start to this Congress, with Democrats 
and 
the 
President 
steamrolling 
through a massive, partisan COVID bill 
packed with non-COVID-related prior-
ities, it is encouraging to see the Sen-
ate working the way it should: Sen-
ators from both parties talking, negoti-
ating, coming together to work out 
legislation that both parties can sup-
port. 
It is particularly encouraging to see 
the Drinking Water and Wastewater 
bill—a bipartisan effort from start to 
finish and a too-rare example of legis-
lation that went through the com-
mittee process, which should be our 
goal for most bills in the Senate. I hope 
this trend will continue. 
Democrats want the Senate to take 
up infrastructure legislation in the 
near future—a goal that Republicans 
support. What we don’t support is 
Democrats’ threat to shove through 
another massive, partisan bill—this 
time 
on 
infrastructure—using 
rec-
onciliation rules to ensure Republicans 
don’t have a voice in the legislation. 
The Senate was designed to promote 
moderation and consensus. It was in-
tended to be a check on the more par-
tisan—or as the Founders would put it, 
factious—House 
of 
Representatives. 
The Senate fulfills its constitutional 
role best when it engages in serious, bi-
partisan consideration and negotiation 
and ensures that Members of both par-
ties are heard. This is the framework 
we should adopt for infrastructure. 
I am encouraged by President Biden’s 
decision to meet with Republicans to 
discuss infrastructure legislation. Re-
publicans have now met with the Presi-
dent at least twice, and more meetings 
are expected. I anticipate meeting with 
the President and other Senators soon 
to discuss broadband infrastructure 
priorities. I hope we can reach bipar-
tisan agreement on priorities in this 
area, including closing the digital di-
vide by increasing broadband access in 
rural America and removing obstacles 
to digital infrastructure deployment. I 
know it can be done. 
When I served as chairman of the 
Commerce Committee, for example, we 
passed bipartisan legislation that re-
duced the redtape associated with 
building broadband networks. I intro-
duced bipartisan legislation to accel-
erate 5G infrastructure deployment. 
There was a lot of bipartisan agree-
ment to be found on infrastructure in 
general. 
Congress has a history of bipartisan 
collaboration on infrastructure legisla-
tion. Our last major infrastructure bill, 
the FAST Act, went through regular 
order and several committees, includ-
ing the one I led at the time, and was 
supported by both Democrats and Re-
publicans, and it was a remarkably 
successful bill. 
Not long thereafter, our committee 
spearheaded enactment of the largest 
reauthorization of the FAA since the 
early 1980s, including critical programs 
to improve airport infrastructure. 
Last Congress, the Environment and 
Public Works Committee here in the 
Senate developed bipartisan infrastruc-
ture legislation. 
There is no reason that we shouldn’t 
reach bipartisan agreement on another 
substantial piece of infrastructure leg-
islation. Senator CAPITO and other Re-
publicans will be releasing a Repub-
lican proposal today that will reflect a 
lot of the bipartisan infrastructure pri-
orities. I hope that after she releases 
this proposal, Democrats and Repub-
licans will be able to sit down and en-
gage in serious negotiation on our two 
plans. 
Our Founders established a demo-
cratic republic instead of a pure de-
mocracy because they wanted to bal-
ance majority rule with protection for 
minority rights. They knew that ma-
jorities could be tyrants, so they wove 
protection for minority rights into our 
system of government. The Senate was 
one of those protections. That is why 
we should be preserving rules like the 
filibuster, which ensures that the mi-
nority party and the many Americans 
it represents have a voice in legisla-
tion. 
It is always important that the mi-
nority party’s voice be heard and the 
Senate engage in bipartisan negotia-
tion and discussion, but it should be es-
pecially obvious that in a 50–50 Senate, 
any major legislation should be bipar-
tisan. If one thing is for sure, it is that 
a 50–50 Senate is not a mandate for one 
side to force through its agenda un-
checked. 
It is absurd for Senate Democrats or 
House Democrats to pretend they have 
a mandate for a partisan revolution. 
Yet much of the legislation that they 
have been pushing since taking office 
appears to have been drafted by Mem-
bers of the extreme left wing of their 
party. 
In his inauguration address, Presi-
dent Biden appeared to recognize the 
bipartisan character of his mandate 
and his obligation to work with Mem-
bers of both parties and promote unity 
in the country. Unfortunately, to date, 
his administration has not delivered on 
that promise of bipartisan leadership. 
As I said, I am encouraged that it ap-
pears he may be changing that when it 
comes to infrastructure. I hope the 
Senate and House Democrats will fol-
low his lead. 
The ball is in Democrats’ court. We 
can pass a substantial, bipartisan in-
frastructure bill, or Democrats can 
continue down the extremely partisan 
path that they have been pursuing. For 
the sake of our country, Mr. President, 
I hope they will choose bipartisanship. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
S. 937 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I thank 
my colleagues who worked diligently 
to enhance the legislation that we are 
considering on the floor here this 
morning. I commend them for the work 
they put into this effort. 
I have an amendment that has been 
included in a vote we are going to take 
here momentarily, a NO HATE amend-
ment, and I would like to speak for just 
a few minutes about this topic. I will 
limit my remarks to speaking in sup-
port of the amendment’s language, 
which simply seeks to collect better 
data on hate crimes under existing 
statutes.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2143 
April 22, 2021 
We know that crimes committed 
against specific groups increased in re-
cent years. Anti-Semitic attacks hit a 
record high in 2019. There are gaps in 
our knowledge of how prevalent these 
crimes truly are. 
The language included in this amend-
ment, based upon the NO HATE Act in-
troduced by Senator BLUMENTHAL, has 
bipartisan support in this Chamber and 
for its companion in the House. It 
would establish incentives for State 
and local law enforcement to submit 
credible and complete hate crime re-

of Justice to collect and analyze data 
on hate crimes, and allow judges to re-
quire 
community 
service 
or 
edu-
cational programs for individuals con-
victed under existing statutes. 
I would also take a moment to ex-
press my gratitude to Senator RICK 
SCOTT for working to help improve the 
text, and that improvement, in fact, is 
also found in this agreement. 
Kansans 
have 
personally 
been 
touched by incidents during my time in 
the Senate. 
In 2014, a neo-Nazi killed three at the 
Jewish Community Center of Greater 
Kansas City and a Jewish retirement 
home, both in Overland Park. In late 
2016, the FBI thwarted a bomb plot 
against an apartment complex housing 
Somali immigrants in Garden City, and 
the following year, a man shot two In-
dian immigrants, killing one, at a res-
taurant in Olathe, KS, after shouting, 
‘‘Get out of my country.’’ 
These were high-profile, well-pub-
licized incidents of hate. It is impor-
tant that the incidents that do not 
gain broad attention are nevertheless 
recorded properly so that the Depart-
ment of Justice can properly analyze 
the data. 
A bipartisan group of attorneys gen-
eral for 35 States and territories, in-
cluding 
Kansas 
Attorney 
General 
Derek Schmidt, have endorsed the NO 
HATE Act. It is also backed by Major 
Cities Chiefs Associations and the Na-
tional District Attorneys Association. 
No statutes are expanded by this 
amendment, nor are there any man-
dates. Instead, it will allow for State 
and local entities to voluntarily seek 
grants to better provide data on spe-
cific crimes in their jurisdictions and 
to give judges flexibility in sentencing 
violent offenders. 
I condemn the recent attacks on 
Asian Americans, and assaults on mi-
norities are an assault of our Nation’s 
creed of ‘‘e pluribus unum’’—out of 
many, one. That is what our country 
is—out of many, one. 
The crimes Senator BLUMENTHAL and 
I seek more information on tear at the 
fabric of our Nation. But out of many 
crimes, it is time we speak as one to 
condemn the perpetrators and their 
ideology, to support the communities 
that live in fear despite that all of us— 
all of us—are made in God’s own image. 
Committed to unifying principles, 
our diversity is our country’s strength. 
We continue to strive to make a more 
perfect union. This amendment is but a 
small step in that direction. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
amendment. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise be-
cause it is a historic day. It is a his-
toric day because the House is sched-
uled to pass H.R. 51, the Washington, 
D.C. Admission Act. My original intent 
was to speak about that, but before I 
do, I want to honor my colleagues who 
have worked very hard on the hate 
crimes legislation that we will tackle 
later today. 
I want to thank Senators HIRONO and 
DUCKWORTH and Senator COLLINS for 
working with them. I want to thank 
Senators BLUMENTHAL and MORAN and 
all the Senators who have worked to 
get us at the threshold where we will 
do something bipartisan that will send 
comfort to people around the country 
who are worried about being targeted 
because of who they are. 
In honor of my colleagues who have 
worked hard, I just want to tell you a 
story about Heather Heyer, the Vir-
ginian for whom the NO HATE Act is 
partially named, who was killed when 
she was 32 in 2017 by a White suprema-
cist in Charlottesville. 
I didn’t know Heather—I know her 
mother Susan pretty well—but I went 
to Heather’s funeral. Let me tell you 
this amazing story about Heather 
Heyer. 
Heather was a waitress, and she saw 
an ad in the newspaper to apply to be 
a paralegal at a local law firm special-
izing in bankruptcy. A Charlottesville 
attorney, an African-American man, 
had a bankruptcy firm. He needed a 
paralegal, put an ad in the paper, and 
got a lot of applications. He got this 
application from Heather Heyer. The 
other applicants had paralegal degrees. 
Heather Heyer was a waitress who 
didn’t have a paralegal degree, but 
something about the letter made him 
think, well, I at least have to talk to 
this person. 
He interviewed those with the para-
legal degrees, and then he interviewed 
Heather Heyer and was very struck 
with her personality but said: Look, I 
am interviewing for people to be a 
paralegal. You don’t have background 
in this area. You are a waitress. Why 
do you think you can do this job? 
Heather said: Because I am a wait-
ress, I listen to people all day long, and 
I want to tell you about some of my 
customers—the elderly widower who 
comes in every Tuesday for lunch, and 
I know his order, and I know how to 
converse with him to lighten his mood. 
She went on to describe some of the 
people in the restaurant she had served 
for years. Then she looked at this at-
torney and said: You are a bankruptcy 
lawyer. The people who come to you 
are hurting. They need to be listened 
to. They are worried about losing ev-
erything. I think you couldn’t do bet-
ter than to hire somebody who has 
made a specialist out of listening to 
other people. 
He said: Well, you may not have a de-
gree, but you have answered that in a 
wonderful way, and I am going to hire 
you. 
He hired Heather. Heather ended up, 
as he described at her funeral service, 
kind of becoming like the office den 
mother, manager, et cetera, who was so 
good dealing with clients who were so 
very worried when they came to see 
him. 
One night after she had been working 
with him for a while, they worked late 
and they left the office. As they left 
the office, Heather’s relatively new 
boyfriend was waiting outside. Heather 
introduced him to her boss. 
The next day, the attorney noticed 
that Heather wasn’t her normal, talk-
ative self, that she wasn’t in a very 
good mood. 
At the end of the day, he said to her: 
Heather, is something wrong? 
She said: Yes. I broke up with my 
boyfriend last night. 
He said: Well, I just met him last 
night outside the office. He seemed like 
a wonderful guy. 
She said: Well, I thought he was a 
wonderful guy, but when he saw that I 
was working for a Black man, he start-
ed to criticize me for that, and I had no 
choice but to break up with him. 
She is Heather Heyer. She is the 
woman whom we are honoring in pass-
ing the NO HATE amendment as part 
of the hate crimes bill today, and I ap-
preciate my colleagues for including 
her in the NO HATE amendment that 
will be part of this bill. 
WASHINGTON, D.C. ADMISSION ACT 
Mr. President, our colleagues in the 
House today are acting on H.R. 51, and 
there is an equivalent bill, S. 51, the 
Washington, D.C. Admission Act. As 
somebody who represents a State just a 
few miles from DC, I didn’t want to let 
this historic day pass without saying a 
word about it. 
The bill would, as everyone knows, 
make Washington, DC, the Nation’s 
51st State. I am proud to serve as an 
original 
cosponsor 
of 
the 
Senate 
version, led by my colleague Senator 
CARPER. The bill was introduced earlier 
this year after many previous efforts 
with a record number of cosponsors, 
and I am proud to say that statehood 
for DC is enjoying the largest support 
in years. 
The right to vote is the cornerstone 
of our American democratic society. 
Through free and fair elections, ordi-
nary citizens choose the leaders and di-
rection of our country; yet some 712,000 
residents of the Nation’s Capital do not 
enjoy the right fully. 
For too long, Virginia’s neighbors in 
DC have been denied their civil rights 
and have been subject to taxation with-
out full representation in Congress, 
which is a founding principle of our Na-
tion. 
Virginians love history. So, on May 
29, 1765, Patrick Henry gave his famous

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2144 
April 22, 2021 
speech before the Virginia House of 
Burgesses, encouraging the passage of 
the five resolutions, commonly re-
ferred to as the Virginia Resolves, to 
address the Stamp Act. The act that 
was passed the following day included 
four of his resolves. 
Everybody 
remembers 
that 
the 
Stamp Act of 1765 levied an unfair tax 
on American Colonies on paper goods, 
newspapers, almanacs, pamphlets, and 
legal documents. The Crown was wor-
ried about the content of those docu-
ments, so it levied the tax. 
In his first resolve, Henry declared 
that Virginians should be entitled to 
‘‘all of the liberties, privileges, fran-
chises, and immunities’’ that other 
British subjects enjoyed. He wanted for 
Virginians the same rights enjoyed by 
people living in Britain, thousands of 
miles away. 
I can’t help but notice the parallel. 
We stand in the District of Columbia, 
the seat of our Nation’s Federal Gov-
ernment. Not thousands of miles away 
but just across the Potomac River or 
just over the border in Maryland, hun-
dreds of thousands of American citi-
zens don’t enjoy the same ‘‘liberties, 
privileges, franchises, and immunities’’ 
as those in Virginia, Maryland, or 
other States. 
In his third resolve, Patrick Henry 
stated: 
The taxation of the people by themselves, 
or by persons chosen by themselves to rep-
resent them, who can only know what taxes 
the people can bear, or the easiest method of 
raising them, and must themselves be af-
fected by every tax laid on the people, is the 
only security against a burdensome tax-
ation, and the distinguishing characteristic 
of British freedom, without which the an-
cient constitution cannot exist. 
To date, DC pays more in Federal 
taxes per capita than any State. Its 
residents pay more in Federal taxes per 
capita than any State and more total 
Federal taxes than 22 States. Yet, for 
more than 200 years, the people of 
Washington, DC, have been denied 
what Patrick Henry urged on the Vir-
ginia House of Burgesses as a reason 
for American independence. DC not 
only pays more per capital Federal 
taxes than any State, it is also subject 
to a higher degree of congressional reg-
ulation of its internal affairs than any 
other State. So it is both taxed and 
overregulated without representation. 
DC meets the two criteria that have 
always been the test of admission of a 
new State into the Union: sufficient 
population and a demonstrated desire 
by the population for statehood. 
Congress used to establish minimal 
required populations for statehood. The 
Northwest Ordinance of 1787, for exam-
ple, incorporated territories into the 
United States in the upper Midwest 
and allowed that they could become 
States once their populations exceeded 
60,000. While there is no such statutory 
minimum today, all would acknowl-
edge that DC, because it has a larger 
population than both Wyoming and 
Vermont and is close to the popu-
lations of the two Dakotas, is suffi-
ciently sizable to be a State. 
DC has also demonstrated its desire 
to be a State over and over again by 
popular referendum. Most recently, in 
2016, a statehood referendum was sup-
ported by 86 percent of DC residents. 
So DC meets the traditional test for 
statehood. Its people are both taxed 
and regulated by a Congress that does 
not include representatives who can 
advocate on their behalf. 
Finally, I support adding a 51st star 
to the American flag because it will 
show that we are still a thriving na-
tion. We haven’t added a State in near-
ly 70 years. This is the longest period 
in American history without adding a 
State. Adding DC as a State will show 
the world that America is still a con-
fident and growing nation with our 
best days ahead of us, not a fixed, in-
ward, and static nation with our best 
days behind us. 
With that, I stand here today to call 
on my colleagues in the Senate to give 
full and fair consideration to H.R. 51, 
which will pass today, and S. 51 and 
provide the more than 700,000 residents 
of our Nation’s Capital the full and 
equal citizenship that Patrick Henry 
demanded in 1775 and that the rest of 
the country enjoys today. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that I be permitted 
to speak for 5 minutes, as well as Sen-
ator HIRONO and Senator COTTON for 5 
minutes each, prior to the order for 
11:30 a.m. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
S. 937 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise 
to speak in support of Senate amend-
ment No. 1445 that Senator HIRONO and 
I have introduced. 
I want to begin by thanking my col-
league from Hawaii for working with 
me on this amendment and acknowl-
edging her leadership. I also want to 
thank 
Senators 
GRASSLEY, 
BLUMENTHAL, MORAN, and WARNOCK for 
their contributions as well. 
Crimes motivated by bias against 
race, national origin, or other charac-
teristics simply cannot be tolerated. 
Our amendment both denounces these 
acts and marshals additional resources 
toward addressing and stopping these 
despicable crimes. 
The amendment that the Senator 
from Hawaii and I are offering today 
will improve the underlying bill in a 
number of key ways, while it will af-
firm our steadfast commitment to 
stand with the Asian-American, Pacific 
Islander community against all forms 
of violence and harassment. 
First, our amendment strongly con-
demns the hate crimes targeting the 
AAPI community. In the past year, 
Stop AAPI Hate reported nearly 3,800 
cases of anti-Asian discrimination. The 
Center for the Study of Hate and Ex-
tremism found that the reporting of 
anti-Asian hate crimes increased by 145 
percent in 16 major cities even though 
hate crimes declined in those cities 
overall. 
Racially motivated discrimination 
and violence should never be tolerated. 
I want to thank Senator GRASSLEY 
and Senator WARNOCK for their con-
tributions to this section of our amend-
ment. 
Second, the Hirono-Collins amend-
ment directs the Attorney General to 
assign a point person at the Depart-
ment of Justice to expedite the review 
of these hate crimes and requires the 
Attorney General to issue guidance to 
State, local, and Tribal law enforce-
ment partners about how to address 
them. Our amendment would also im-
prove data collection and expand pub-
lic awareness about hate crimes and 
ways to support victims. With better 
information, we can help prevent these 
crimes before they occur and assist law 
enforcement in bringing the perpetra-
tors to justice. 
Third, our amendment incorporates 
the Jabara-Heyer NO HATE Act, au-
thored by Senators BLUMENTHAL and 
MORAN. This bipartisan bill, which I 
have cosponsored, provides State and 
local governments and law enforce-
ment agencies with additional tools 
and resources to understand, identify, 
and report hate crimes. It provides 
grants to State and local governments 
for training and for using the FBI’s na-
tional hate crimes database to create 
reporting hotlines and to support com-
munity engagement around prevention 
and services for victims. This is impor-
tant because far too many hate crimes 
go unreported, and without data, it is 
difficult to investigate and prosecute 
them. 
Again, let me thank the Senator 
from Hawaii for her leadership on this 
amendment. I enjoyed working with 
her to strengthen and improve the bill, 
and I urge my colleagues to support it. 
In doing so, we can send an unmistak-
ably strong signal that crimes tar-
geting Asian Americans and Pacific Is-
landers in our country will not be tol-
erated. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arkansas. 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, our Na-
tion is in the midst of a historic crime 
wave that is affecting Americans of 
every background and walk of life. This 
surge in violence includes a shocking 
rise in hate crimes against our fellow 
citizens of Asian descent. Last year, 
the total number of hate crimes in 
America’s largest cities dropped by 7 
percent, but they surged by nearly 150 
percent against Asian Americans. 
Often, these hate crimes target the 
elderly and the frail—people who can’t 
fight back against their vicious assail-
ants. 
Just last month, a 65-year-old Asian- 
American woman was knocked to the 
ground and repeatedly kicked in broad 
daylight on the streets of New York 
City while her attacker shouted anti- 
Asian slurs. We later learned that her 
attacker was a convicted murderer who 
was out on parole, thanks to criminal

leniency policies. Instead of being in 
prison, locked up, where he belonged, 
he was brutalizing an innocent victim 
in broad daylight—yet more proof that 
being weak on crime doesn’t reduce 
crime; it only invites more crime. 
A civilized society can’t ignore such 
attacks on our innocent citizens. We 
have to protect them. We have to pro-
tect every citizen and get tough on vio-
lent hate crimes. 
Unfortunately, in response to this 
terrible rise in anti-Asian hate crimes, 
the Democrats initially introduced an 
extremely partisan bill intended to 
score political points. This flawed piece 
of legislation that the Senator from 
Hawaii originally sponsored contained 
provisions tailor-made to muzzle free 
speech. 
For example, the bill would have di-
rected the Department of Justice to 
tell Americans how they were supposed 
to talk about this virus. I voted 
against proceeding to this bill, in part 
because of this crazy, radical idea to 
impose a speech code on how Ameri-
cans can talk about this virus. Some 
say: How could you vote against it? 
Very simple. I will never support a 
speech code imposed on the American 
people on how they can exercise their 
First Amendment rights to talk about 
this pandemic. 
This whole idea is deeply concerning, 
especially because some in the media 
and some of our Democratic friends be-
lieve that even pointing out that the 
virus came from China is somehow in-
citing violence. That is as foolish as it 
is dangerous. Calling this virus—which, 
yes, came from Wuhan, China—the 
Wuhan virus is not racist, and it 
doesn’t incite violence. You may re-
call, after all, that last year, journal-
ists from such esteemed outlets as 
CNN, Reuters, the Washington Post, 
and the New York Times all used the 
terms 
‘‘Chinese 
virus,’’ 
‘‘Chinese 
coronavirus,’’ 
and 
‘‘Wuhan 
coronavirus.’’ Were they inciting vio-
lence? Were they racist? No, of course 
not. They were following the centuries- 
old practice of referring to diseases by 
their geographic names. 
It wasn’t anti-Spanish to call the in-
fluenza outbreak of 1918 the ‘‘Spanish 
flu’’ even though it didn’t even start in 
Spain. It was not anti-Egyptian to use 
the term ‘‘West Nile virus.’’ What 
about the variants of this virus from 
Brazil? from South Africa? from Great 
Britain? We use those terms. Is that 
somehow going to have to be banned 
from polite society’s lexicon as well? 
Second, I also want to point out that 
the 
Democrats’ 
original 
bill, 
sup-
posedly about the violence against 
Asian Americans, never actually used 
the term ‘‘Asian American’’—not once. 
Instead, it had some new, manufac-
tured, mysterious term called ‘‘COVID– 
19 hate crimes,’’ which could have set a 
precedent for the even wider suppres-
sion of free speech against citizens who 
have no animus toward Asians and who 
haven’t committed any crimes—citi-
zens, for instance, who are concerned 
about the spread of the coronavirus due 
to the surge of illegal immigration at 
our border. 
According to the mainstream media, 
if you so much as ask a question about 
the unvaccinated and untested persons 
who are entering our country at the 
border every day, you are somehow big-
oted or nativist or xenophobe. In the 
original version of the bill, the lan-
guage ‘‘COVID–19 hate crimes’’ could 
have resulted in individuals opposed to 
illegal immigration being reported for 
merely expressing an opinion. 
Yet I am happy to report that this 
process, which had a bitter, partisan 
beginning, will soon have a rather up-
lifting and unifying end. Thanks to the 
diligent work of one of the hardest 
working Senators in the U.S. Senate, 
the Senator from Maine, these offen-
sive provisions of the Democrats’ origi-
nal bill have been removed. The Sen-
ator from Maine has helped turn what 
was a bitter, partisan piece of legisla-
tion into something that now Members 
of both parties can hopefully support. 
Thanks to her efforts, this legislation 
is specifically focused on the crisis at 
hand and will improve the reporting of 
anti-Asian hate crimes. 
Soon, we will also vote on a series of 
amendments from some of my fellow 
Senators to improve this legislation 
even further. I look forward to voting 
for those amendments, for the sub-
stitute amendment, and for the bill, as 
amended. 
Today, this Chamber will take a step 
forward in fighting the rise of anti- 
Asian violence. I hope that we continue 
to make progress so that every victim 
gets justice and that further attacks 
are deterred. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Hawaii. 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, as the 
author of this bill, I totally disagree 
with characterizing it as having had a 
bitter partisan beginning, but my col-
league is exercising his free speech 
right, so there you go. 
After 2 weeks of hard work and bipar-
tisan collaboration, the U.S. Senate is 
poised to take real action to confront 
the wave of anti-Asian hate sweeping 
our country. Although we still have 
some damaging amendments to defeat, 
I am confident that, in a few hours, the 
Senate will pass the COVID–19 Hate 
Crimes Act, as amended, with the sub-
stitute Hirono-Collins amendment. By 
doing so, we will send a powerful mes-
sage of solidarity to the AAPI commu-
nity that the Senate will not be a by-
stander as anti-Asian violence surges 
in our country. 
Over the past years, hate crimes tar-
geting the AAPI have risen 150 percent, 
as noted. More than 3,800 incidents 
have been reported across all 50 States 
and the District of Columbia. These 
statistics paint a disturbing picture of 
what is happening in our country, but 
they only quantify part of the problem. 
Why? Because hate crimes and other 
incidents are notoriously underrep-
resented. 
These attacks have not ceased in the 
2 weeks since the Senate began debat-
ing this bill. Last Sunday, an 80-year- 
old woman and her 79-year-old hus-
band, both of Korean descent, were 
taking an evening walk in a local park 
near their home in Southern Cali-
fornia. Suddenly, without warning, an 
assailant approached the couple and 
punched them in their faces. That same 
assailant is also suspected of threat-
ening Sakura Kokumai, a Japanese- 
American Olympic karate athlete, who, 
incidentally, was born in Hawaii. 
These unprovoked, random attacks 
and incidents are happening in super-
markets, on our streets, in takeout res-
taurants—basically, wherever we are. 
These disturbing and horrifying at-
tacks are in many ways a predictable 
and foreseeable consequence of the use 
of racist and inflammatory language 
like ‘‘Chinese virus’’ or ‘‘Kung flu’’ to 
describe the pandemic. 
I have been heartened by the steps 
President Biden has taken to denounce 
this language and confront this epi-
demic of hate. Under his leadership, 
the executive branch is doing its part, 
and in a few short hours, Congress will 
do ours by passing the COVID–19 Hate 
Crimes Act. 
This is not a controversial bill. It fo-
cuses Federal leadership to investigate 
and report hate crimes and other inci-
dents, and it provides resources for our 
communities to come together to take 
a stand against intolerance and hate. 
Over the past 2 weeks, I have worked 
with Senators in both parties to make 
changes that broaden support for this 
bill while retaining its original pur-
pose. In particular, I want to acknowl-
edge and thank Senator COLLINS for 
her good-faith efforts to amend this 
bill and build support for it in the Re-
publican caucus. 
I 
also 
want 
to 
thank 
Senator 
DUCKWORTH for her leadership on this 
issue; 
Senators 
BLUMENTHAL
and 
MORAN, whose NO HATE Act is now in-
cluded in our legislation; and Senators 
WARNOCK and GRASSLEY, who contrib-
uted important findings to this bill. 
This moment would not have been 
possible without the determined efforts 
of Leader SCHUMER and Chairman DUR-
BIN and the excellent work of my friend 
and colleague in the House, Congress-
woman GRACE MENG. 
I am grateful that the Senate will 
soon be taking action to confront anti- 
Asian hate in our country, but ours is 
not the only community suffering right 
now. Earlier this week, a jury in Min-
neapolis delivered justice and account-
ability for the murder of George Floyd, 
but make no mistake: One conviction 
cannot and will not erase the enduring 
legacy of systemic racism and dis-
parate policing in our country. It is my 
sincere hope that we can channel and 
sustain the bipartisan work done on 
this important piece of legislation into 
debating and passing the George Floyd 
Justice in Policing Act, and I under-
stand that bipartisan talks are under-
way. We are in this together. We are in 
this together.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

Mr.

Mr.

this 
amendment is straightforward. It tar-

being directed against Asian Ameri-
cans by colleges and universities across 
the country, including preeminent in-
stitutions such as Yale and Harvard, 
which are denying admission to quali-
fied 
Asian-American 
applicants 
in 
favor of underrepresented minority 
groups. The U.S. Department of Justice 
was suing Yale for its discrimination 
against Asian Americans until the 
Biden administration dismissed that 
lawsuit. 
My amendment, simply put, would 
prohibit institutions of higher edu-
cation from receiving any Federal 
funding if they have a policy or if they 
engage in discrimination against Asian 
Americans during the recruitment re-
view of applications or admissions. 
I urge the adoption of the amend-
ment. 
I yield the remainder of my time to 
Senator KENNEDY. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in 
2021, the year of our Lord 2021, we have 
major universities in this country that 
are 
discriminating 
in 
admissions 
against Asian Americans. Now, I know 
they think they know how to discrimi-
nate in the right way, but discrimina-
tion is discrimination. 
At one of these universities in 2013, 
Harvard admitted that if it admitted 
Asian Americans purely on the basis of 
academic achievement, it would have 
doubled the number of Asian Ameri-
cans. Now, this is wrong; it is con-
temptible; it is odious. This amend-
ment doesn’t go nearly far enough. It is 
a baby step, but at least it is a step. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
Who 
yields time? 
The Senator from Hawaii. 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I rise in 
strong opposition to this amendment. 
Discrimination 
against 
Asian-Amer-
ican students or any students on the 
basis of race is already prohibited by 
Federal law. 
This amendment is a transparent and 
cynical attack on longstanding admis-
sion policies that serve to increase di-
versity and provide opportunity to stu-
dents of color in our institutions of 
higher learning. This amendment also 
threatens 
colleges 
and 
universities 
with the loss of all Federal funding for 
pursuing or using policies that our 
courts have upheld repeatedly. 
I urge everyone to reject this amend-
ment. 
I yield back. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
ADDITIONAL COSPONSOR 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to be added as a co-
sponsor to this amendment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I yield 
back the remainder of my time. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
question is on agreeing to the amend-
ment. 
Mr. CRUZ. I ask for the yeas and

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a

There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond.

The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
SCHATZ). On this vote, the yeas are 49, 
the nays are 48. 
Under the previous order requiring 60 
votes for the adoption of this amend-
ment, the amendment is not agreed to. 
The amendment (No. 1456) was re-
jected. 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 1425 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, there will now be 4 
minutes of debate, equally divided, 
prior to a vote in relation to amend-
ment No. 1425. 
The Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I rise to 
speak in support of Senator LEE’s 
amendment No. 1425. 
Despite the protections of the First 
Amendment, over the course of the 
pandemic, many States have placed 
heavy-handed restrictions that have 
limited Americans’ freedom to gather 
for worship, to meet in smaller groups 
for religious purposes, or even to sing 
praise and worship. 
At first, many Americans accepted 
these restrictions. Our Nation was 
grappling with the new and deadly 
virus, and the restrictions were only 
supposed to be temporary. But as the 
weeks and months dragged on, States 
lifted restrictions on restaurants, on 
casinos, on museums, while keeping 
tight restrictions in place for syna-
gogues, for churches, for temples, for 
mosques, and other religious gath-
erings. 
Senator LEE’s amendment requires 
the Department of Justice to inves-
tigate whether the government applied 
the same rules to religious groups that 
were applied to similar nonreligious or-
ganizations and businesses and whether 
those restrictions complied with the 
First Amendment. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that Senator LEE’s written re-
marks on his amendment be inserted 
into the RECORD. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection. 
Mr. CRUZ. I urge adoption of the 
amendment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority whip. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if you 
believe the COVID–19 Hate Crimes Act 
is a good piece of legislation—and, ob-
viously, over 90 Senators voted to move 
to proceed to this bill—then you can’t 
vote for the Lee amendment because 
the first thing he does before he puts 
out his own idea of what we should 
consider instead is to strike key sec-
tions of the COVID–19 Hate Crimes Act 
that require the Attorney General to 
issue guidance to establish online re-
porting of hate crime incidents, collect 
data on hate crime incidents, and ex-
pand public education in campaigns. 
The Lee amendment strikes that. He 
doesn’t want us to do that. 
He wants us to assign the Attorney 
General the responsibility, in the next 
180 days, to survey every COVID–19 re-
striction in every State in the Union. 
I urge a vote against the Lee amend-
ment.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under

prior to a vote in relation to amend-
ment No. 1458. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I 
rise in support of amendment No. 1458, 
which I introduced. It will narrow the 
scope of the tangled web of regulatory 
guidance that the bill calls for and 
keep politics out of the process of re-
porting and addressing hate crimes 
against Asian Americans. It addresses 
crimes, not incidences. 
I don’t think it is out of line to intro-
duce a little precision to the process 
and make sure the Agency officials 
who will be responsible for running this 
program know what they are supposed 
to be looking for and what they are 
supposed to be doing with all that in-
formation. 
I can guarantee my colleagues that 
support of this change will result in a 
bill that will fulfill its purpose to pro-
tect victims and potential victims of 
hate crimes, and it will stop their 
attackers. 
I urge adoption of the amendment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I 
strongly urge my colleagues to oppose 
this amendment because it essentially 
shreds the bill. It removes core provi-
sions. 
It would prevent the Department of 
Justice from tracking hate crime inci-
dents that don’t rise to the level of 
criminal conduct. That provision is 
contrary to policy of the International 
Association of Chiefs of Police. It 
would eliminate a provision from the 
NO HATE Act that I have advocated 
that funds creation of State-run hot-
lines so we know more about these 
hate crimes. 
It would eliminate a judge’s ability 
to order that a person convicted of 
hate 
crimes 
undertake 
educational 
classes and provide that kind of rem-
edy as a condition for supervised re-
lease. 
In short, it eliminates some of the 
most important provisions of this bill. 
I strongly urge opposition to this 
amendment.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this 
vote, the yeas are 46, the nays are 51. 
Under the previous order requiring 60 
votes for the adoption of this amend-
ment, the amendment is not agreed to.

VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 1445 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, amendment No. 1445 
is agreed to. 
The amendment (No. 1445) was agreed 
to. 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
for a third reading and was read the 
third time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill 
having been read the third time, the 
question is, Shall the bill pass, as 
amended? 
Mr. 
GRASSLEY. 
Mr. 
President, 
today, I express my support for S. 937, 
as amended by Senators HIRONO and 
COLLINS. 
Every single one of us is horrified to 
see our fellow Americans attacked be-
cause of their race or ethnicity. We are 
united in our opposition to this des-
picable violence and to seeing it inves-
tigated and prosecuted to the fullest 
extent of the law. I have introduced a 
resolution to this effect and asked for a 
hearing to learn more about Attorney 
General 
Garland’s 
review 
of 
hate 
crimes committed against Asian Amer-
icans and Pacific Islanders. 
It is good to see my Democratic 
friends acknowledge that bipartisan-
ship is still the way to solve problems 
in the Senate. We have come together 
and, with a bipartisan amendment, im-
proved this bill and made it more use-
ful. We have gone beyond merely look-
ing at COVID-related hate crimes to all 
hate crimes, and we have increased 
funding for reporting hate crimes. 
I would be remiss if I did not say that 
more bipartisanship could have made 
the bill even better. I think a com-
mittee markup would have been useful. 
I think if Democrats had allowed us to 
bring a Republican amendment extend-
ing the Violence Against Women Act 
for a vote, that would have been useful. 
Women are suffering from terrible vio-
lence during this pandemic, and this 
was a missed opportunity.

would guarantee even more support for 
marginalized communities, by ensuring 
Asian Americans are not discriminated 
against by institutions of higher learn-
ing and that religious Americans are 
free to worship in peace during the 
pandemic. 
But I hope nonetheless that this is a 
moment where the Senate speaks to-
gether about the importance of fight-
ing hate crimes. We all believe that, 
even though we have different ideas 
about the best way to do it. This bill is 
the product of that collaboration. I will 
be voting for it, and I hope my col-
leagues will do the same. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the 
Senate’s passage of this legislation af-
firms our commitment to stand with 
the Asian-American and Pacific Is-
lander community against hate crimes. 
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
I thank my colleague from Hawaii for 
working with me to improve the Asian- 
Americans Hate Crimes Act. Crimes 
motivated by bias against race, na-
tional origin, and other characteristics 
cannot be tolerated. 
The Center for the Study of Hate & 
Extremism found that reporting of 
anti-Asian hate crimes increased by 145 
percent in 16 major cities, even though 
hate crimes declined in those cities 
overall. 
The amendment we adopted today 
and the bill we are about to pass de-
nounces those acts and marshals addi-
tional resources toward stopping these 
despicable crimes. The bill directs the 
Department of Justice to expedite its 
review of hate crimes and to issue guid-
ance that will both help prevent them 
from occurring and improve their re-
porting. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Hawaii. 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, in just a 
few moments, the Senate will take a 
strong stand against anti-Asian hate in 
our country. 
Passing the COVID–19 Hate Crimes 
Act sends a clear and unmistakable 
message of solidarity to the AAPI com-
munity, and this moment would not be 
possible without the collective efforts 
of so many people, including, of course, 
my Republican colleagues—one person 
in particular who just spoke before me. 
But I want to especially thank Ma-
jority Leader SCHUMER for making this 
bill a priority for the Senate and work-
ing closely with us to shepherd its pas-
sage. 
I also want to thank my colleagues 
in the House, especially Congress-
woman GRACE MENG for being the dog-
ged advocate for our community during 
this process, as well as Members of the 
Congressional Asian Pacific American 
Caucus, led by Congresswoman JUDY 
CHU. 
I urge all of my colleagues to vote for 
this legislation. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague 
from Maine and my colleague from Ha-
waii, as well as my colleague from Illi-
nois, and so many others who have led 
on this issue. 
In a moment, the Senate will vote on 
final passage of the anti-Asian hate 
crimes bill. 
This long overdue bill sends two mes-
sages to our Asian-American friends: 
We will not tolerate bigotry against 
you; and to those perpetrating anti- 
Asian bigotry, we will pursue you to 
the fullest extent of the law. 
We cannot—we cannot—allow this re-
cent tide of bigotry, intolerance, and 
prejudice against Asian Americans go 
unchecked. A bedrock value of our 
multicultural society is that an attack 
on any one group is an attack on all of 
us. 
By passing this bill, we tell our law 
enforcement 
agencies 
to 
prioritize 
anti-Asian 
violence 
and 
wield 
the 
sword to detect, deter, and prosecute 
hate crimes of all varieties. We send a 
clear message, a unified message, that 
hate has no place in America. And so, 
by passing this bill, we recommit our-
selves to the most American of creeds, 
‘‘e pluribus unum,’’ out of many one. 
I urge a unanimous ‘‘yes’’ vote on 
this legislation, and I ask for the yeas 
and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond.

The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. VAN 
HOLLEN). On this vote, the yeas are 94, 
the nays are 1. 
The 60-vote threshold having been 
achieved, the bill, as amended, is 
passed. 
The bill (S. 937), as amended, was 
passed, as follows: 
S. 937 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘COVID–19 
Hate Crimes Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Following the spread of COVID–19 in 
2020, there has been a dramatic increase in 
hate crimes and violence against Asian- 
Americans and Pacific Islanders. 
(2) According to a recent report, there were 
nearly 3,800 reported cases of anti-Asian dis-
crimination and incidents related to COVID– 
19 between March 19, 2020, and February 28, 
2021, in all 50 States and the District of Co-
lumbia. 
(3) During this time frame, race has been 
cited as the primary reason for discrimina-
tion, making up over 90 percent of incidents, 
and the United States condemns and de-
nounces any and all anti-Asian and Pacific 
Islander sentiment in any form. 
(4) Roughly 36 percent of these incidents 
took place at a business and more than 
2,000,000 Asian-American businesses have 
contributed to the diverse fabric of Amer-
ican life. 
(5) More than 1,900,000 Asian-American and 
Pacific Islander older adults, particularly 
those older adults who are recent immi-
grants or have limited English proficiency, 
may face even greater challenges in dealing 
with the COVID–19 pandemic, including dis-
crimination, economic insecurity, and lan-
guage isolation. 
(6) In the midst of this alarming surge in 
anti-Asian hate crimes and incidents, a 
shooter murdered the following 8 people in 
the Atlanta, Georgia region, 7 of whom were 
women and 6 of whom were women of Asian 
descent: 
(A) Xiaojie Tan. 
(B) Daoyou Feng. 
(C) Delaina Ashley Yaun Gonza´lez. 
(D) Paul Andre Michels. 
(E) Soon Chung Park. 
(F) Hyun Jung Grant. 
(G) Suncha Kim. 
(H) Yong Ae Yue. 
(7) The people of the United States will al-
ways remember the victims of these shoot-
ings and stand in solidarity with those af-
fected by this senseless tragedy and inci-
dents of hate that have affected the Asian 
and Pacific Islander communities. 
SEC. 3. REVIEW OF HATE CRIMES. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 7 days 
after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
Attorney General shall designate an officer 
or employee of the Department of Justice 
whose responsibility during the applicable 
period shall be to facilitate the expedited re-
view of hate crimes (as described in section 
249 of title 18, United States Code) and re-
ports of any such crime to Federal, State, 
local, or Tribal law enforcement agencies.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2149 
April 22, 2021 
(b) APPLICABLE PERIOD DEFINED.—In this 
section, the term ‘‘applicable period’’ means 
the period beginning on the date on which 
the officer or employee is designated under 
subsection (a), and ending on the date that is 
1 year after the date on which the emergency 
period described in subparagraph (B) of sec-
tion 1135(g)(1) of the Social Security Act (42 
U.S.C. 1320b–5(g)(1)) ends, except that the At-
torney General may extend such period as 
appropriate. 
SEC. 4. GUIDANCE. 
(a) GUIDANCE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGEN-
CIES.—The Attorney General shall issue guid-
ance for State, local, and Tribal law enforce-
ment agencies, pursuant to this Act and 
other applicable law, on how to— 
(1) establish online reporting of hate 
crimes or incidents, and to have online re-
porting that is equally effective for people 
with disabilities as for people without dis-
abilities available in multiple languages as 
determined by the Attorney General; 
(2) collect data disaggregated by the pro-
tected characteristics described in section 
249 of title 18, United States Code; and 
(3) expand public education campaigns 
aimed at raising awareness of hate crimes 
and reaching victims, that are equally effec-
tive for people with disabilities as for people 
without disabilities. 
(b) GUIDANCE RELATING TO COVID–19 PAN-
DEMIC.—The Attorney General and the Sec-
retary of Health and Human Services, in co-
ordination with the COVID–19 Health Equity 
Task Force and community-based organiza-
tions, shall issue guidance aimed at raising

19 pandemic. 
SEC. 5. JABARA-HEYER NO HATE ACT. 
(a) SHORT
TITLE.—This section may be 
cited as the ‘‘Khalid Jabara and Heather 
Heyer National Opposition to Hate, Assault, 
and Threats to Equality Act of 2021’’ or the 
‘‘Jabara-Heyer NO HATE Act’’. 
(b) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) The incidence of violence known as hate 
crimes, or crimes motivated by bias, poses a 
serious national problem. 
(2) According to data obtained by the Fed-
eral Bureau of Investigation, the incidence of 
such violence increased in 2019, the most re-
cent year for which data is available. 
(3) In 1990, Congress enacted the Hate 
Crime Statistics Act (Public Law 101–275; 28 
U.S.C. 534 note) to provide the Federal Gov-
ernment, law enforcement agencies, and the 
public with data regarding the incidence of 
hate crime. The Hate Crime Statistics Act 
and the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, 
Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act (division E 
of Public Law 111–84; 123 Stat. 2835) have en-
abled Federal authorities to understand and, 
where appropriate, investigate and prosecute 
hate crimes. 
(4) A more complete understanding of the 
national problem posed by hate crime is in 
the public interest and supports the Federal 
interest in eradicating bias-motivated vio-
lence referenced in section 249(b)(1)(C) of 
title 18, United States Code. 
(5) However, a complete understanding of 
the national problem posed by hate crimes is 
hindered by incomplete data from Federal, 
State, and local jurisdictions through the 
Uniform Crime Reports program authorized 
under section 534 of title 28, United States 
Code, and administered by the Federal Bu-
reau of Investigation. 
(6) Multiple factors contribute to the pro-
vision of inaccurate and incomplete data re-
garding the incidence of hate crime through 
the Uniform Crime Reports program. A sig-
nificant contributing factor is the quality 
and quantity of training that State and local 
law enforcement agencies receive on the 
identification and reporting of suspected 
bias-motivated crimes. 
(7) The problem of crimes motivated by 
bias is sufficiently serious, widespread, and 
interstate in nature as to warrant Federal fi-
nancial assistance to States and local juris-
dictions. 
(8) Federal financial assistance with regard 
to certain violent crimes motivated by bias 
enables Federal, State, and local authorities 
to work together as partners in the inves-
tigation and prosecution of such crimes. 
(c) DEFINITIONS.—In this section: 
(1) HATE
CRIME.—The term ‘‘hate crime’’ 
means an act described in section 245, 247, or

50,000 and less than 100,000, as computed by

Mr. SCHUMER. Finally, I ask unani-
mous consent that the mandatory 
quorum calls for the cloture motions 
filed today, April 22, be waived.

Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you.

COVID–19 HATE CRIMES ACT 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor to talk about the rise 
in hate crimes in the Pacific Northwest 
and to thank my colleague the Senator 
from Hawaii for her tremendous leader-
ship in guiding us through this process 
to get this legislation passed in the 
U.S. Senate. 
I want to thank her for her incredible 
work as a member of the Judiciary 
Committee and for getting this out and 
moved to the floor and to thank Sen-
ator SCHUMER and Senator MCCONNELL 
for both helping us to get to this point 
today and our colleagues for passing 
this incredible legislation. But, again, 
thanks to Senator HIRONO for know-
ing—knowing and understanding and 
being a great member of the Judiciary 
Committee—that we needed to get this 
legislation done now. 
Asian Americans and Pacific Island-
ers have a long history in our country. 
And their contributions have been sig-
nificant, both in cultural vibrancy to 
our economy and to our way of life. 
But, unfortunately, that has also 
been marked by periods in our history 
of hate and damaging stereotypes and 
xenophobia, and we saw this again with 
COVID–19. That is why we needed to 
act today, to pass hate crimes legisla-
tion to protect Asian Americans in the 
United States of America and to make 
sure that they have tools to protect 
them. 
Our AAPI communities are facing 
the same challenges we face in the pan-
demic. And trust me, we have lost

some incredible Asian Americans, who 
ran markets, who ran restaurants, who 
were small business leaders and contin-
ued to work during this crisis and ulti-
mately paid the price with their lives. 
But they also, in addition to facing the 
pandemic, have had to face a range of 
hate and racism against them during 
this time period. 
According to Stop AAPI Hate, nearly 
3,800 incidents of violence and hate 
against AAPI individuals were reported 
nationwide over a year since the pan-
demic. And sadly—sadly—women made 
up over half of this. Nearly 68 percent 
of the reported incidents of violence 
against Asian Americans were against 
Asian-American 
women. 
This 
must 
stop. 
And it is very important that we 
think about how a fraction of these 
statistics that are the reported infor-
mation—how many more are out there 
that go unreported. 
My State, the State of Washington, 
has the seventh largest Asian-Amer-
ican population and the third largest 
Pacific Islander population in the Na-
tion. And like the rest of the United 
States, we have seen an increase in 
these incidents. 
In fact, in 2020, the State had the 
third highest rate of hate crimes tar-
geted against AAPI community mem-
bers. That is why I am for getting a 
full slate of people over at the Depart-
ment of Justice, including Kristen 
Clarke, to deal with hate crimes. Why? 
Because my State is plagued by these 
issues, and we are not going to tolerate 
it. We are going to fight back and 
make sure that we have the infrastruc-
ture in place to recognize these things. 
Just this past February, a teacher 
driving in the Seattle International 
District was assaulted with a sock con-
taining a rock. The attacker was 
charged with felony assault but not a 
hate crime. 
We have been told that there are 
widespread reports of AAPI elders and 
women 
throughout 
Western 
Wash-
ington who have been verbally har-
assed and randomly physically as-
saulted. The King County Coalition 
Against Hate and Bias is collecting in-
formation about these attacks. But we 
know that there have been many 
throughout many communities in our 
State. 
Just a few months ago, a woman in 
King County and her two children were 
accosted with a man yelling, screaming 
at them just to get out—‘‘Get out! Get 
out!’’ And a man was captured on video 
in downtown Seattle attacking an 
Asian couple, spitting on them, slap-
ping the man’s face, and yelling at 
them: ‘‘It’s your fault.’’ So we know 
these incidents are happening. 
In fact, just a week or so ago, I par-
ticipated in a roundtable of the Asian 
American-Pacific Islander community 
from my State to talk about the need 
for this national legislation and why it 
is so important we have community- 
based solutions, which include more 
cultural education to teach our chil-
dren the history of the Asian-American 
community in the United States, men-
tal health support in multiple lan-
guages, 
investing 
in 
community 
groups, and this legislation that was 
passed today that will give us better 
tools to prosecute those individuals 
who participate in hate crimes. 
This bill would designate a point per-
son within the U.S. Department of Jus-
tice to expedite the review of hate 
crimes and continue to work with all of 
us. 
It requires the Attorney General to 
issue guidance to State, local, and 
Tribal law enforcement to establish an 
online hate crime reporting and data 
collection system. These are all impor-
tant tools. 
So I, again, want to thank our col-
leagues, and I want to also thank Sen-
ator 
BLUMENTHAL. 
His 
bipartisan 
amendment would authorize the Attor-
ney General to provide grants to States 
and localities to better train law en-
forcement 
on 
identifying, 
inves-
tigating, and reporting hate crimes and 
to operate State-run hate crime report-
ing hotlines. 
So this legislation will help us in 
shining a very bright light on an 
alarming rise in violence against the 
Asian American-Pacific Islander com-
munity and help us with new tools to 
combat that crime. 
I, again, thank my colleagues. We all 
must work together to stop this kind 
of violence. 
I thank the President. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want 
to join my colleague Senator CANT-
WELL in congratulating Senator HIRONO 
and all of us for almost unanimously 
passing this bill that would try to stop 
discrimination against Asian Ameri-
cans. I am happy that passed. There 
was only one vote against it. 
I just don’t think it goes far enough. 
I think it is ludicrous, it is odious to 
me, that in the year 2021, we have 
major universities in the United States 
of America that are setting quotas on 
their admissions for Asian Americans— 
not quotas to have enough Asian Amer-
icans, quotas to keep Asian Americans 
out. They are, and everybody in this 
body knows they are doing that. 
Harvard is in litigation over it. Har-
vard officials have already stated that 
but for their quotas, there would be 
twice as many Asian Americans at 
Harvard as there are now if they base 
the 
decision 
solely 
on 
academic 
achievement. And that is wrong. 
There is no way to discriminate in 
the right way. Discrimination is dis-
crimination. Judge people on the basis 
of their academic achievements. 
President Biden has talked an awful 
lot about the error of discriminating 
against Asian Americans, and he is ab-
solutely right. What is the first thing 
he did? He pulled his Justice Depart-
ment off of filing litigation to try to 
stop these quotas on Asian Americans 
and universities. I mean, if there 
weren’t double standards around here, 
there would be no standards at all. 
So I strongly encourage—Senator 
CRUZ and I offered an amendment to 
Senator HIRONO’s bill to try to fix this. 
Unfortunately, 
we 
couldn’t 
get 
60 
votes. In fact, I don’t think a single— 
maybe I am wrong in saying this, but 
not very many of my Democratic 
friends voted for it. 
But I would say to President Biden, 
now, if you are serious about ending 
discrimination against Asian Ameri-
cans, tell your Justice Department to 
get off its ice cold, lazy rear end and do 
something about it. Stop the quotas in 
higher education. 
Anyway, that is not, really, what I 
came up to talk about. 
f 
DISPOSE UNUSED MEDICATIONS 
AND PRESCRIPTION OPIOIDS ACT 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, you 
are aware, as we all are, of the scourge 
of opioid abuse in this country. It is 
horrible. It is terrible. We sometimes 
lose as many as 50,000 of our people a 
year. 
And as you also know, many people 
who become addicted to opioids don’t 
necessarily buy the opioids on the 
street. They get the opioids from fam-
ily and friends. So one of the best 
things you can do to try to stop the 
scourge of opioid abuse is to clear out 
your medicine cabinet so that people 
aren’t tempted to use the drugs. Turn 
them in, if they have been prescribed 
to you, and you don’t need them any 
longer. 
To make this easier, our DEA, as you 
know, Mr. President, holds pretty regu-
larly what we call Take Back Days. On 
a Take Back Day, any person can go 
into his or her medicine cabinet, find 
drugs, including opioids, that they are 
not using anymore, that could be dan-
gerous if abused, and they can take 
those unused medications and drop 
them off at a previously announced 
DEA drop site. 
Take Back Day is this Saturday, 
April 24. I want to encourage all Amer-
icans and Louisianans to do this. Go 
through your medicine cabinet. If you 
have opioids that have been prescribed 
to you—legally, of course—and you 
don’t need them any longer, don’t just 
leave them hanging around. Turn them 
in, please. 
But not every day is Take Back Day, 
and last year Congress, in its wisdom, 
passed a law, a very good law, instruct-
ing the Department of Veterans Affairs 
to ask—well, actually to require—VA 
medical centers to have these drop 
boxes permanently so that American 
veterans can throw away medications, 
including but not limited to opioids, 
that they don’t need. And it has 
worked out really well. 
The question that occurred to me 
after we passed the bill was why limit 
that kind of access only to our vet-
erans. So I have a bill to basically open 
up the Veterans Administration drop

boxes for unused drugs, including but 
not limited to opioids, at VA medical 
centers to anybody who wants to go get 
rid of these unused drugs at any time. 
You don’t have to wait until Take 
Back Day. This would be a permanent 
program. 
The name of the bill is the Dispose 
Unused Medications and Prescription 
Opioids Act. And before I offer this bill 
up, let me just give one more plug. I 
would remind everyone that this Sat-
urday, April 24, is Take Back Day. If 
you have unused medications, includ-
ing opioids, that you want to get rid of, 
it will have been publicized in your 
community by the DEA. You can go 
drop them off, and I hope people will do 
that. 
Mr. President, toward that end, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Com-
mittee on Veterans’ Affairs be dis-
charged from further consideration of 
my bill, S. 957, and the Senate proceed 
to its immediate consideration. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the bill by title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (S. 957) to direct the Secretary of 
Veterans Affairs to ensure that certain med-
ical facilities of the Department of Veterans 
Affairs have physical locations for the dis-
posal of controlled substances medications. 
There being no objection, the com-
mittee was discharged, and the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I fur-
ther ask that the Kennedy substitute 
amendment at the desk be considered 
and agreed to, that the bill, as amend-
ed, be read a third time and passed, and 
that the motion to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table 
with no intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The amendment (No. 1459) in the na-
ture of a substitute was agreed to, as 
follows: 
[Purpose: In the nature of a substitute] 
Strike all after the enacting clause and in-
sert the following: 
SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF PERIODS DURING 
WHICH ANY INDIVIDUAL MAY DIS-
POSE OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES 
MEDICATIONS 
AT 
FACILITIES 
OF 
THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS 
AFFAIRS. 
Section 3009 of the Johnny Isakson and 
David P. Roe, M.D. Veterans Health Care and 
Benefits Improvement Act of 2020 (Public 
Law 116–315; 38 U.S.C. 8110 note) is amended— 
(1) by redesignating subsection (b) and (c) 
as subsections (c) and (d), respectively; and 
(2) by inserting after subsection (a) the fol-
lowing new subsection (b): 
‘‘(b) DESIGNATION OF PERIODS FOR ANY INDI-
VIDUAL TO DISPOSE OF MEDICATION.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary shall des-
ignate periods during which any individual 
may dispose of controlled substances medi-
cations at a covered Department medical fa-
cility. 
‘‘(2) PUBLIC INFORMATION CAMPAIGNS.—The 
Secretary may carry out public information 
campaigns regarding the periods designated 
under paragraph (1).’’. 
The bill (S. 957), as amended, was or-
dered to be engrossed for a third read-
ing, was read the third time, and 
passed. 
Mr. KENNEDY. I suggest the absence 
of a quorum.

The senior assistant legislative clerk

DRINKING 
WATER 
AND 
WASTE-
WATER INFRASTRUCTRE ACT OF 
2021—MOTION TO PROCEED—Con-
tinued 
SEACOR POWER LIFT BOAT 
Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, the 
year 2020 was a year filled with sadness 
and grief for me, but, unfortunately, 
that sadness and grief struck again in 
the year 2021. 
Last 
Tuesday, 
100-mile-per-hour 
winds capsized a lift boat with a crew 
of 19 off the coast of Grand Isle, LA, 
just south of Port Fourchon. The U.S. 
Coast Guard and a group of Good Sa-
maritan boats rescued six crew mem-
bers as winds continued between 80 to 
90 miles per hour and waves were 7 to 
9 feet high. 
The Coast Guard credits those Good 
Samaritans with saving four of the six 
rescued crew members. So, fortunately, 
in the midst of a terrible tragedy, it 
turns out a crew of Coast Guard men 
and women were on a boat doing a trial 
run when the SOS went out. And al-
though technically not Coast Guard, 
they were coastguardsmen, and they 
went out and aided in the rescue. We 
are eternally grateful for their efforts, 
their hard work, and for the risk they 
took to themselves to bring those crew 
members back to shore safely, who re-
turned safely. 
In this tragedy, which affects us in 
Louisiana but, in a sense, affects us all, 
any loss of life is heartbreaking. But 
there are some who may not be found, 
and we pray their families find closure. 
To date, six have been confirmed dead, 
including Anthony Hartford of New Or-
leans, James ‘‘Tracy’’ Wallingsford of 
Gilbert, 
Captain 
David 
Ledet 
of 
Thibodaux, 
Ernest 
Williams 
of 
Arnaudville, 
Lawrence 
Warren 
of 
Terrytown, and Quinon Pitre of Frank-
lin. 
Seven are still missing. Each day 
that passes, the prognosis—the chance 
of finding them—obviously decreases. I 
would like to take a moment to recog-
nize those still missing: 
Jay Guevara, Dylan Daspit, Gregory 
Walcott, Chaz Morales, Jason Krell, 
Darren Encalade, and Chris Rozands. 
Our thoughts and prayers are with 
the crew members of the capsized ves-
sel, their loved ones, and their commu-
nities. 
While we mourn this loss, we also 
rise to recognize the heroic efforts of 
the Coast Guard, the Good Samaritans, 
and all involved in the search-and-res-
cue 
efforts 
that 
continued 
for 
6 
straight days. 
In just 40 hours, the Coast Guard cov-
ered more than 1,440 square miles of 
the Gulf of Mexico, searching for miss-
ing crew members. To put that in per-
spective, that is an area larger than 
the State of Rhode Island. By Friday, 
this area grew to a size larger than Ha-
waii, searching through sea and air. 
Late last week, the National Trans-
portation Safety Board announced they 
will open an investigation. The team 
arrived in New Orleans on Thursday, 
and a preliminary report will be re-
leased within the next 2 weeks. 
We deeply appreciate the volunteers 
who assisted the men and women from 
the Coast Guard and many others in 
the search and rescue, particularly dur-
ing the terrible weather. In the light of 
this tragedy, this team effort dem-
onstrates the best of humanity. 
We grieve with the families. We shall 
always remember the lives of those we 
lost. 
May God watch over their souls. May 
they find eternal peace. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I 
bring news back from Oklahoma to this 
body and a request for dialogue. The 
COVID bill that was passed a little 
over a month ago—that bill provided 
all kinds of relief. As this body knows, 
we were deeply divided on that bill and 
some of the issues within it. 
One of the issues stretched out the 
debate all the way to the last moment, 
and it was the additional unemploy-
ment 
assistance. 
The 
conversation 
about the additional unemployment as-
sistance is this: The economy is re-
opening. Is this the time to extend ad-
ditional money above and beyond State 
unemployment assistance, what we 
normally 
do? 
With 
unemployment 
rates going down, should we add more 
money on top of it? 
No one really knew what would hap-
pen when that occurred, but we had 
some suspicions. The 2 weeks I spent 
traveling around the State, the week 
before Easter and after Easter, in town 
after town after town after town after 
town, I heard the same thing from em-
ployees and employers. 
Employees would tell me that some-
body who used to work next to them is 
now at home because they are making 
as much money at home on unemploy-
ment assistance as they would when 
working. So the person standing there 
working at the factory, the person 
standing there working at the res-
taurant is ticked off at the person who 
is at home watching TV, making as 
much money as they are.

April 22, 2021 
The employer is just as frustrated or 
more because they have all kinds of or-
ders coming into their business, say-
ing: Can you send us more of this? And 
they could, except they don’t have 
enough labor. 
An additional $300 a week was added 
on top of the unemployment assistance 
and extended out all the way to the 
first week of September. At the same 
time, checks were sent out to every in-
dividual. Then they were told they 
would get a $10,000 tax break. The com-
bination of those three things together 
has caused some folks to do what peo-
ple do in a free market: They look to 
see where they are going to work based 
on where they can make the most 
money at that moment. That is what a 
free market is like. That is why em-
ployers continue to pay a little more to 
get good employees. But the problem 
is, in Oklahoma, where there is a low 
cost of living, many of our employers 
are struggling to find workers because 
they are competing against this body. 
The employees are ticked because 
they are at work working, paying 
taxes, and the person who used to work 
next to them and probably will return 
this October got several months off and 
is making the same, except for the per-
son working is paying for the person 
not working, and they are a little 
ticked off about it. 
I bring this to you because this is not 
hypothetical. In Oklahoma, our unem-
ployment rate dropped again to 4.2, but 
we still have 100,000 people. Our rates 
continue to rise for people filing first- 
time claims, but I promise there is not 
a town you can go to in Oklahoma that 
doesn’t have ‘‘help wanted’’ signs all 
over town. I heard it from every single 
town that I went to, from employers in 
every single place that they cannot 
compete with what the government is 
just mailing to people for staying at 
home. 
The very first day I was out a couple 
of weeks ago, I was in Tulsa at a busi-
ness there that does manufacturing. He 
told me that for the first time ever— 
and he has owned the business a long 
time—for the first time ever, one of his 
managers came to him and said: You 
are not going to believe what just hap-
pened. 
They had an employee who came up 
to them and said: I would like for you 
to fire me. 
He said: Well, why in the world would 
I do that? 
He said: Well, I just figured out, with 
the tax break and what I would get on 
unemployment 
assistance, 
I 
could 
make as much staying at home as I 
could working. But I need you to fire 
me so I can go file for unemployment. 
He literally said to him: I am not 
going do that. Go back to work. 
So the next day, the guy showed up 
30 minutes late to work, and at lunch-
time, he took an hour and a half off. He 
did the same thing the next day. The 
third day, according to protocol in 
their company, they called him in, 
talked to him, and wrote it all up. The 
fourth day, they did the same thing 
again—called him in, wrote it up. By 
the fifth day, they fired him. 
His exact words to his manager on 
the floor: What took you so long? 
There is a restaurant in Oklahoma 
City that told us they were preparing 
to reopen. Finally, the pandemic is 
over. We have a very high percentage 
of folks in Oklahoma who have re-
ceived the vaccine. We are one of the 
top 10 States in the country for distrib-
uting the vaccines. 
Our State, our county, our local of-
fices, our hospitals, and our Tribal 
areas have done a fantastic job getting 
the vaccine out. We are open. 
One of the restaurants trying to re-
open in the Plaza District of Oklahoma 
City, a beautiful cultural district, 
couldn’t reopen because they couldn’t 
hire people because they got larger un-
employment benefits, and they remain 
closed. 
The mayor of Muskogee told me that 
most employers in their town are 
struggling to be able to get employees 
to get back to work. 
In Northern Oklahoma, in Perry, 
there is a restaurant that was talking 
to one of my staff this week that said 
they are having to close early because 
they can’t get enough business. 
I would tell you, a couple of Sundays 
ago, my wife and I drove to go eat 
lunch after church, and we went to two 
restaurants before we had to go to a 
third to find a restaurant that was 
open. The second restaurant literally 
had a sign on their door: ‘‘Closed Due 
to Labor Shortage.’’ 
This is a real issue that was created 
in this room that is impacting my 
State trying to reopen. I have no idea 
if my Democratic colleagues will ac-
knowledge this as a real problem or 
will just say: That is a hypothetical 
issue; it is not real. But this is going to 
continue all the way through Sep-
tember, and my State is not going to 
be able to reopen. This will get even 
worse in the days ahead when addi-
tional money will start being shipped 
out to families in the change in the 
child tax credit, when people will lit-
erally start getting checks in August 
on top of the other checks they are re-
ceiving. 
I bring this to this body because I 
would like for us to have a conversa-
tion about it and for somebody in this 
body to acknowledge that a mistake 
was made and we need to fix this. 
We all agreed last year to be able to 
help during the time of the pandemic. 
People needed help. Everyone was out 
of work, and there were no options for 
work. That is not true anymore; yet 
these larger benefits are still coming 
out. 
This needs to be addressed. For the 
sake of getting our economy going 
again, this needs to be addressed. I 
would hope we could have a reasonable, 
rational, fact-based conversation about 
it. 
U.S. SUPREME COURT 
Madam President, for most of the 
history of the United States, we have 
had nine Supreme Court Justices— 
nine. Now, we started out originally 
with six, and then it dropped for just a 
little while to five and then went right 
back to six again. 
When we added a seventh circuit 
court in 1807, it popped from six to 
seven, and there was some discussion 
about whether it would just continue 
based on the number of circuit courts. 
It was determined that, no, that was a 
bad idea. 
Then it went to nine in 1837. Lincoln 
actually added 1 to make it 10, and 
they determined that was really too 
many and brought it back down to 7, 
actually. 
In 1869, we went back to nine again, 
where we were most of the time before 
that and where we have remained, nine 
Supreme Court Justices. That is not 
just a random number; it seems to be a 
pretty good number—nine—to be able 
to open up debate. 
I don’t just think it is a pretty good 
number. There is a rather famous and 
some would say ‘‘notorious’’ Justice 
named Ruth Bader Ginsburg. She made 
this statement in 2019 when asked 
about Court-packing and asked about 
increasing the size of the Court. In 
2019, Ruth Bader Ginsburg said: 
Nine seems to be a good number. It’s been 
that way for a long time. . . . I think it was 
a bad idea when President Franklin Roo-
sevelt tried to pack the court. . . . If any-
thing [it] would make the court look par-
tisan. 
That is not just one Justice. Early in 
April this year, Justice Breyer was 
speaking at the Harvard Law School, 
and he addressed this issue of Court- 
packing while this body is in the mid-
dle of a conversation about Court-pack-
ing—extremely rare for that to occur. 
Justice Breyer stated: 
I’m an optimist. The rule of law has weath-
ered many threats, but it remains sturdy. I 
hope and expect that the Court will retain 
its authority, an authority that my stories 
have shown was hard-won. But that author-
ity, like the rule of law, depends on trust, a 
trust that the Court is guided by legal prin-
ciple, not politics. . . . Structural alteration 
motivated by the perception of political in-
fluence can only feed that latter perception, 
further eroding that trust . . . There is no 
shortcut. Trust in the courts, without which 
our system cannot function, requires knowl-
edge, it requires understanding, it requires 
engagement. In a word, it requires work. 
Work on the part of all citizens. And we 
must undertake that work together. . . . 
What I’m trying to do is to make those 
whose initial instincts may favor important 
structural change or other similar institu-
tional changes—such as forms of court-pack-
ing—think long and hard before they embody 
those changes in law. 
That was so well received, by Justice 
Breyer, 
that 
progressive 
activists 
started calling for him to take early 
retirement. 
Court-packing is not a new conversa-
tion in this body, but it has not been 
well received in the past. 
The Court has always ebbed and 
flowed in its liberal or conservative 
bents. President Obama spoke openly 
when he was President about the Court

April 22, 2021 
in the 1960s. That was a very progres-
sive Court in the 1960s that drove con-
servatives crazy with some of the deci-
sions they made, but there was no 
packing of the Court to try to change 
the direction of the Court in the 1960s 
and 1970s. There was a frustration but a 
realization that nine was the right 
number. 
Over time, the Court, as it does, as it 
ebbs and flows over the decades, has 
flowed to be more conservative. In the 
days ahead, at some point, it will flow 
to be more liberal. It just will. But the 
rule of law is important. It is not a new 
concept that is being addressed, but it 
is one this body should think long and 
hard about. 
Quite frankly, I agree with Joe Biden 
on this concept, but not the President 
Joe Biden, the Senator Joe Biden. 
With this body’s permission, let me 
read Joe Biden’s speeches when he was 
in the U.S. Senate and he stood right 
over there and spoke on this floor or 
spoke in committee hearings when he 
was 
in 
the 
Judiciary 
Committee, 
speaking often about this issue. 
Joe Biden, once speaking, made this 
statement. He said: 
President Roosevelt clearly had the right 
to send to the U.S. Senate and the U.S. Con-
gress a proposal to pack the Court. It was to-
tally within his right to do that. He violated 
no law; he was legalistically absolutely cor-
rect. But it was a bonehead idea. It was a 
terrible, terrible mistake to make. And it 
put in question, for an entire decade, the 
independence of the most significant body— 
including the Congress, in my view— 
The most significant body in this 
country— 
—the Supreme Court of the United States of 
America. 
The President had the right to do that. He 
was totally within his power, and his objec-
tive was seen clearly. 
Well, the President clearly has the right to 
do what he is doing, in my view. 
But he also called it ‘‘bonehead.’’ 
Joe Biden, as Senator, also continued 
with this statement. He was discussing 
the same issue. He said: ‘‘The Senate 
again stood’’—by the way, this was two 
decades later, after Joe Biden made 
that statement I just read. Two dec-
ades later, Joe Biden still has the same 
passion. He stated this: 
The Senate again stood firm in the 1937 
court-packing plan by President Franklin 
Roosevelt. This particular example of Senate 
resolve is instructive for today’s debates, so 
let me describe it in some detail. It was the 
summer of 1937. President Roosevelt had just 
come off a landslide victory over Alf Landon, 
and he had a Congress made up of solid New 
Dealers. But the ‘‘nine old men’’ of the Su-
preme Court were thwarting his economic 
agenda, overturning law after law over-
whelmingly passed by the Congress and from 
statehouses across the country. 
In this environment, President Roosevelt 
unveiled his court-packing plan—he wanted 
to increase the number of Justices on the 
Court to 15, allowing himself to nominate 
these additional judges. In an act of great 
courage, Roosevelt’s own party stood up 
against his institutional power grab. They 
did not agree with the judicial activism of 
the Supreme Court, but they believed that 
Roosevelt was wrong to seek to defy estab-
lished traditions as a way of stopping that 
activism. 
In May 1937, the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee—a 
committee 
controlled 
by 
the 
Democrats and supportive of his political 
ends—issued a stinging rebuke. They put out 
a report condemning Roosevelt’s plan, argu-
ing it was an effort ‘‘to punish the Justices’’ 
and that executive branch attempts to domi-
nate the Judiciary lead inevitably to an 
autocratic 
dominance, 
‘‘the 
very 
thing 
against which the American Colonies re-
volted, and to prevent which the Constitu-
tion was in every particular framed.’’ 
Our predecessors in the Senate showed 
courage that day and stood up to their Presi-
dent as a coequal institution. And they did 
so not to thwart the agenda of the President, 
which in fact many agreed with; they did it 
to preserve our system’s checks and bal-
ances; they did it to ensure the integrity of 
the system. When the Founders created a 
‘‘different kind of legislative body’’ in the 
Senate, they envisioned a bulwark against 
unilateral power—it worked back then and I 
hope it works now. 
Said Joe Biden during that time. 
The noted historian Arthur Schlesinger, 
Jr.— 
Joe Biden, continuing as Senator— 
has argued that in a parliamentary system 
President Roosevelt’s efforts to pack the 
Court would have succeeded. Schlesinger 
writes: ‘‘The Court bill couldn’t have failed if 
we had a parliamentary system in 1937.’’ A 
parliamentary legislature would have gone 
ahead with their President, that’s what they 
do, but the Founders envisioned a different 
kind of legislature, an independent institu-
tion that would think for itself. In the end, 
Roosevelt’s plan failed because Democrats in 
Congress thought court-packing was dan-
gerous, even if they would have supported 
the newly-constituted Court rulings. The in-
stitution acted as an institution. 
In summary, then, what do the Senate’s 
action of 1795, 1805, and 1937 share in com-
mon? I believe they are examples of this 
body acting at its finest, demonstrating its 
constitutional role as an independent check 
on the President, even popularly elected 
Presidents of the same party. 
That was from Senator Joe Biden. 
His challenge to this body was to think 
long and hard before they destroyed an 
institution of our government. It was 
right then; it is right now. 
In a final statement from Joe Biden, 
he spoke about the filibuster—often, 
actually, about the filibuster. Senator 
Biden stated this: 
The Framers created the Senate as a 
unique legislative body designed to protect 
against the excesses of temporary majority, 
including with respect to judicial nomina-
tions; and they left us all the responsibility 
of guaranteeing an independent Federal judi-
ciary, one price of which is that it some-
times reaches results Senators don’t like. 
It is up to us to preserve these precious 
guarantees. Our history, our American sense 
of fair play, and our Constitution demand it. 
Joe Biden continued. As Senator, he 
said: 
I would ask my colleagues who are consid-
ering supporting the ‘‘nuclear option’’— 
those who propose to ‘‘jump off the preci-
pice’’—whether they believe that history will 
judge them favorably. In so many instances 
throughout this esteemed body’s past, our 
forefathers . . . stepped back from the cliff. 
In each case, the actions of those statesmen 
preserved and strengthened the Senate, to 
the betterment of the health of our constitu-
tional republic and to all of our advantage. 
Our careers in the Senate will one day 
end—as we are only the Senate’s temporary 
officeholders—but the Senate itself will go 
on. Will historians studying the actions 
taken in the spring of 2005— 
When Joe Biden stated this in the 
Senate— 
[Will they] look upon the current Members 
of this Senate as statesmen who placed the 
institution of the United States Senate 
above party and politics? Or will historians 
see us as politicians bending to the will of 
the Executive and to political exigency? I, 
for one, am comfortable with the role I will 
play in this upcoming historic moment. 
Then he stated this, from Senator 
Joe Biden: 
I hope . . . my colleagues [will] feel the 
same. 
So do I. Less than the days ahead, 
history will look at the unwinding of 
the judiciary based on a season in the 
Supreme Court, as we have had seasons 
and cycles before. Don’t unwind the ju-
diciary for a season. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
OPIOID EPIDEMIC 
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I 
appreciate the thoughtful comments 
from my colleague from Oklahoma of 
the need for us to have an independent 
judiciary. 
I am on the floor to talk about a dif-
ferent issue, and it is the latest, very 
troubling information that we are re-
ceiving regarding the addiction epi-
demic and specifically drug overdose 
deaths in the United States. I am also 
going to talk about some of the steps 
we can take right now to address that 
reality. 
One of the top priorities I have had in 
this body and in the House has been 
this drug addiction issue. Frankly, this 
is a moment of frustration because we 
were 
making 
progress, 
and 
then 
COVID–19 hit. Unfortunately, the drug 
epidemic has hit my State of Ohio par-
ticularly hard. The latest data from 
the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, the CDC, show that it is a 
pretty grim picture right now, and it 
should be a wake-up call to all of us. 
Overdose deaths rose nearly 30 percent 
nationwide from September 2019 to 
September 2020. During this time pe-
riod, you can see the overdose deaths 
numbers going up dramatically. 
This is heartbreaking for me because 
we were making progress. After lit-
erally decades of increases in drug 
overdose deaths every single year—dec-
ades—going back to the 1990s, we fi-
nally here in the 2017, 2018, 2019 periods 
began to make progress in reducing 
overdose deaths. In fact, in Ohio, we 
had a 24-percent decrease in overdose 
deaths during 1 year, 2018, but, right 
now, the numbers are getting higher 
and higher, and it is everywhere. 
As you can see from this chart, if 
something is in any of these colors, 
this means that there is an increase in 
overdose deaths. If it is in blue, it 
means there is a decrease, and this was 
just during this period of September

2019 to September 2020, the latest data 
for which we have good information. It 
doesn’t even include all of 2020, and as 
we know, the pandemic, unfortunately, 
went all the way through 2020 and into 
2021. All of the data show that, as you 
got further into the pandemic, we had 
higher rates, so we expect, when the 
final data come out for 2020, it will be 
even higher. 
Here is where we are now. Look at 
this. Other than the State of South Da-
kota, every single State has seen an in-
crease—and a substantial increase in 
many cases—in overdose deaths. This 
is in 49 of 50 States. In my own State of 
Ohio, there has been about a 25-percent 
increase in overdose deaths during this 
period. 
Only a few years ago, again, we were 
making progress. One reason that we 
had begun to turn the tide was because 
of work that had been done here in the 
U.S. Congress. Right around this time 
period, we passed legislation called the 
Comprehensive Addiction and Recov-
ery Act. We also passed legislation 
called the 21st Century Cures Act. Both 
were signed into law in 2016. So it 
would have been in this period. It be-
came effective in this period and actu-
ally helped to reduce overdose deaths 
for the first time in decades. 
I commend my colleagues for that 
legislation. It was the first time we had 
ever funded recovery, as an example. 
We also funded prevention and treat-
ment and provided our law enforce-
ment with more naloxone, this miracle 
drug that reverses the effects of an 
overdose. Many of my colleagues have 
had the opportunity to speak with 
their local addiction boards or have 
been with law enforcement or other 
first 
responders—firefighters—who 
have used this naloxone effectively to 
save lives. 
So things were getting better until 
we saw this big increase in connection 
with the coronavirus pandemic. The 
stresses of this unprecedented time, 
clearly, have contributed to the spike 
in 
drug 
abuse. 
People 
have 
felt 
lonelier. People have felt more iso-
lated. Specifically, people have not 
been able to get access to recovery pro-
grams. Being in person with a recovery 
coach is a whole lot different than 
being on a Zoom call. That is what I 
hear from recovering addicts, and it 
makes sense. 
I will say that people have turned to 
drugs to cope during this tough period, 
but also, many of those who are in re-
covery have been stalled in their 
progress because of their inability to 
be with other recovering addicts. So 
part of the best practices and best sci-
entific evidence we have is that an ef-
fective way to help people overcome 
their addictions is to be with other 
people who also have those addictions. 
We have known this for years in terms 
of alcohol treatment programs—AA 
and so on—but this has been one of the 
problems. 
Another issue I am going to raise, 
which apparently is somewhat con-
troversial, but I hear it from the ex-
perts—and those are the people on the 
ground, in the field, who are dealing 
with this issue—is that, when we here 
in Congress provided lump sums to all 
Americans under a certain income— 
and you will remember the individual 
payments—they didn’t go out right 
away because our State offices couldn’t 
process them quickly enough, particu-
larly with regard to unemployment in-
surance, wherein our workers’ comp 
and our unemployment offices could 
not get the money out the door on a 
weekly basis but could retroactively 
provide those funds. 
We had individuals getting—instead 
of $300 a week or $600 a week—$10,000 a 
week because it was an accumulation 
of many weeks. People were owed that, 
but getting these big lump sums was 
not helpful in the context of many peo-
ple who were in recovery because it led 
to their purchasing drugs and it led to 
what we are finding out—again, back 
home—in talking to the experts, were 
some of the reasons you had this spike. 
So there are a lot of reasons here. 
I guess what we need to focus on now 
is, How do we get beyond this? 
These deaths are happening away 
from the national headlines because 
the coronavirus is taking the national 
headlines, understandably. A story just 
last week, from a news station in Day-
ton, OH, summed it up perfectly with a 
quote from Lori Erion, who is the 
founding president of Families of Ad-
dicts. 
She said: 
During the pandemic, addiction and fami-
lies struggling with it haven’t gone any-
where. We have been here the whole time. 
But they have not gotten much no-
tice. There were 87,000 people who died 
from overdoses in the September 2019 
to the September 2020 period we talked 
about. There were 87,000 Americans 
who died. If not for the COVID–19 pan-
demic, I don’t think we would have 
seen this increase—from everything we 
are hearing if the correlation is almost 
precise—but also we would be hearing a 
lot more about the addiction crisis and 
doing more about it here. 
We did put some funding into the 
CARES Act and into the two most re-
cent COVID–19 packages to help with 
behavioral 
health, 
people’s 
mental 
health, and also with addiction. That 
has been helpful, but we need to go 
much broader and do something much 
more comprehensive to take this mo-
ment to recommit ourselves to fighting 
addiction 
and 
ensuring 
that 
more 
Americans don’t continue to lose their 
lives to overdoses. We have bipartisan 
legislation that has been introduced 
that we have been working on with a 
lot of people on the outside to try to 
come up with some new ideas, some 
ways to address this problem. 
In the 5 years since this Comprehen-
sive Addiction and Recovery legisla-
tion has become law, which was in part 
the reason we saw this reduction—also, 
a lot of great work was done at the 
local level and the State level—the 
substantial, several billion-dollar com-
mitment we made here in this Chamber 
for more prevention, treatment, and 
longer term recovery with naloxone 
and so on, made a difference, but it has 
been 5 years. 
During that time, I have visited with 
literally hundreds of different organi-
zations in my home State. I have also 
just talked to a lot of experts about 
this. I have been to a lot of nonprofits, 
from Cleveland to Cincinnati and from 
Portsmouth to Toledo. I have talked to 
literally hundreds of recovering addicts 
about what works and what doesn’t 
work for them. 
There is legislation that we are in-
troducing now, which we call CARA 3.0. 
We had the first Comprehensive Addic-
tion and Recovery Act, and we had a 
second one back in 2018, a smaller one. 
Now we have this new, bipartisan 
CARA 3.0 legislation. Senator SHELDON 
WHITEHOUSE is my coauthor, but we 
have a number of Members who have 
joined up to help, and it addresses 
three major areas. 
One is research and education. We 
still need to find out more, and we still 
need to get better research and better 
alternatives to opioids to deal with 
pain because much of this is being driv-
en, as you know, from opioids—both 
heroin and prescription drugs but also 
these new synthetic opioids, which are 
the deadliest of all. 
Second, we focus on education. Get-
ting the prevention message out there 
is incredibly important to keep people 
from coming into the funnel of addic-
tion in the first place, which is incred-
ibly powerful and effective. 
Third, of course, are treatment pro-
grams. 
The fourth is recovery. Again, Con-
gress had never funded recovery before; 
yet all of the best science shows that 
these recovery programs, when done 
properly, can be incredibly helpful, and 
longer term recovery, unfortunately, is 
needed, which is costly, but the alter-
native is worse. 
Finally, there is criminal justice re-
form, which I will talk about in a mo-
ment. 
It will bolster our work to prevent 
drug abuse before it happens through 
funding for research and education. A 
new national drug awareness campaign 
is part of this legislation, and the re-
search and development of alternative 
pain treatment methods that don’t 
lead to addiction is part of it. 
CARA 3.0 will also take the impor-
tant step of addressing the dispropor-
tionate effect the addiction crisis has 
had on people in poverty and commu-
nities of color. Unfortunately, during 
this increase, we have seen a higher 
percentage of overdoses in commu-
nities of color. A national commission 
has been formed to look at this issue to 
better develop treatments and best 
practices to avoid overdoses. 
Second, our bill will build on what 
works and how we treat addiction. It 
will double down on proven, evidence- 
based addiction treatment methods

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2157 
April 22, 2021 
while expanding treatment options for 
groups that are particularly vulnerable 
to addiction, including young people, 
new and expecting mothers, rural com-
munity residents, and communities of 
color—individuals who live in those 
communities. One of the things that we 
have learned through, again, evidence- 
based research into what works and 
what doesn’t work is that medication- 
assisted treatment, when done prop-
erly, can be very effective. 
It will also make permanent the cur-
rent expanded telehealth options for 
addiction treatment that were created 
temporarily in response to the social 
distancing required by the COVID–19 
pandemic. This is really important. 
Telehealth is one of the few silver lin-
ings in an otherwise very dark cloud of 
the coronavirus pandemic. Yet, for 
many individuals, telehealth was effec-
tive, particularly with regard to behav-
ioral health and addiction services. So 
we want to be sure that the temporary 
ability to pay for those telehealth vis-
its, as an example, through Medicaid as 
an example or Medicare, can continue 
past the pandemic. 
CARA 3.0 will also bolster the recov-
ery options for individuals who are 
working to put addiction behind them 
through funding to support recovery 
support services and networks. It will 
enable physicians to provide medica-
tion-assisted 
addiction 
treatments, 
like methadone, to a greater number of 
patients and change the law to allow 
these drugs to be prescribed via tele-
health for a greater ease of access. This 
will require a change in legislation to 
allow people to provide these kinds of 
treatments. 
Our bill will also destigmatize addic-
tion recovery in the workplace by en-
suring that taking one of these medica-
tions—again, medications to get people 
over their addictions—will not count as 
a drug-free workplace violation. This 
may seem like an obvious change, but, 
unfortunately, it will take a change of 
law to be able to make that happen. 
Finally, CARA 3.0 reforms our crimi-
nal justice system to ensure that those 
who are struggling with addiction, in-
cluding our veterans, are treated with 
fairness and compassion by the law, 
putting them on a path to recovery in-
stead of into a downward spiral of drug 
abuse. 
Importantly, CARA 3.0 funds a De-
partment of Justice grant program to 
help incarcerated individuals who are 
struggling with addiction to receive 
medication-assisted treatment while 
they are still in the criminal justice 
system. Again, that may seem like a 
pretty obvious solution, but there are 
people who go into the system ad-
dicted, and they come out addicted. 
They are not given the treatment op-
tions when they are incarcerated, and 
they simply go back to lives of addic-
tion. Those people have high rates of 
recidivism, clearly. Most are rearrested 
and are back in the system within a 
relatively short period of time. 
So this will reduce recidivism, repeat 
offenses. It makes sense for the person 
addicted, and it certainly makes sense 
for the community, with fewer crimes 
being committed. It also makes a lot of 
sense for the taxpayer because that 
treatment, although there is an addi-
tional expense while in the criminal 
justice system, will have a much better 
chance of getting those people back to 
lives wherein they can go back to 
work, back to their families, be in re-
covery, and not be back in the expen-
sive criminal justice system. So it is a 
win-win-win. 
CARA and CARA 2.0 gave States and 
local communities new resources and 
authorities to make a real difference in 
my State and others. CARA 3.0 renews 
and strengthens those programs, and 
given the recent spike in addiction we 
see here, it provides a significant boost 
in funding as well. When added with 
the existing CARA programs that were 
authorized through 2023, we will be in-
vesting well over $1 billion per year to 
address this longstanding epidemic, 
putting us on the path toward a bright-
er future free from addiction. 
Another important part of CARA 3.0 
is our bipartisan legislation to build on 
this expanded telehealth option for ad-
diction services. 
It was necessary during the pandemic 
to have it because of social distancing. 
We found out that, although there is no 
substitute for face-to-face interaction, 
telehealth has kept patients in touch 
with their doctors and allowed physi-
cians to prescribe medication-assisted 
treatment remotely. 
It doesn’t make sense to get rid of 
these options once the pandemic goes 
away, so again, CARA 3.0 included leg-
islation we had previously introduced 
separately called the Telehealth Re-
sponse 
for 
E-Prescribing 
Addiction 
Therapy, or the TREATS Act, to make 
permanent a number of temporary 
waivers for telehealth services and bol-
ster telehealth options for addiction 
treatment services. 
Specifically, it does a couple things. 
First, it allows for a patient to be pre-
scribed these lower scheduled drugs, 
like SUBOXONE, through telehealth 
on their first visit. You can’t do that 
now. Current law requires you to go in 
person for a visit when needing an ini-
tial prescription for controlled sub-
stances, but this has been a deterrent 
to patients in crisis and in urgent need 
of treatments from schedule III or 
schedule IV drugs, like SUBOXONE or 
certain other drugs for a co-occurring 
mental health condition. 
It also limits abusive practices by 
both audio and visual capabilities to be 
able to interact with the treatment 
providers to reduce fraud and abuse 
when it is your first visit, and it would 
also keep the existing requirements for 
in-person 
visits 
when 
prescribing 
schedule II drugs—these are the harder 
drugs, like opioids and stimulants— 
which are much more prone to being 
abused through these telehealth visits. 
So we have a provision in there to 
avoid abuse, but it is also important to 
continue this telehealth when other op-
tions aren’t there. I think it is a bal-
anced approach that makes sense. 
Second, our bill will allow for Medi-
care to bill for audio only or telephone 
telehealth visits for mental health and 
substance abuse if it is not the pa-
tient’s first visit. Due to access to the 
broadband or distance, in-person or 
even video appointments aren’t always 
possible, particularly for our seniors. 
We need to focus on safety and robust 
treatment options, but in order to bal-
ance the needs of patients, we have 
proposed to allow our Nation’s seniors 
under Medicare to use phones for sub-
sequent mental health or behavioral 
health visits when they don’t have ac-
cess to the internet and where fact-to- 
face interaction isn’t possible and isn’t 
as necessary. 
I believe the TREATS Act will make 
a difference in the addiction treatment 
space and will help us prevent more un-
timely overdoses. 
So the legislation I have laid out so 
far—CARA 3.0 and the TREATS Act— 
cover an important aspect of the addic-
tion crisis: the addiction treatment ef-
forts that help lessen the demand for 
drugs, which is the single most impor-
tant thing, reducing that demand. 
But there is also more we have to do 
on the supply side because as drugs are 
pouring into our country, they are at a 
lower price on the streets of Cincinnati 
or Columbus or Cleveland or Dayton or 
Toledo. So we do need to do more to 
curb the supply of these dangerous sub-
stances. This is especially true right 
now because there is such a critical cri-
sis ongoing, and there is a looming 
deadline to keep one class of very dan-
gerous drugs illegal and off the streets. 
I am talking about the kinds of 
opioids that are—like fentanyl, that 
are synthetic opioids but have a slight 
molecular change. So unless we act 
here in Congress, they will no longer be 
scheduled, no longer be illegal. 
Data from the CDC, again, shows 
that the biggest driver to this surge in 
overdose deaths that we see here comes 
from fentanyl, comes from these syn-
thetic opioids. They are often far more 
deadly than traditional opioids, like 
heroin. In fact, fentanyl is 50 times 
more powerful than heroin. A pound of 
fentanyl is lethal enough to kill a half 
a million people. And fentanyl, as you 
will find out talking to your law en-
forcement folks and others in the 
treatment space, it is often now being 
laced with other drugs, like cocaine, 
like crystal meth or heroin. 
Most of this synthetic opioid is being 
illegally manufactured in China and 
then smuggled across our borders, ei-
ther coming in through the mail sys-
tem or going to Mexico and then being 
smuggled across. 
There is also evidence now that it is 
also being produced in Mexico, which is 
a change and a major concern. 
In order to avoid prosecution, prior 
to 2018, scientists in China—evil sci-
entists in China—and drug traffickers 
started making slight modifications to 
fentanyl, sometimes adjusting a single

molecule and creating what are essen-
tially fentanyl copycats. 
While these fentanyl-related sub-
stances have the same narcotic prop-
erties as fentanyl, their tiny variations 
allowed them to evade prosecution. But 
oftentimes, these similar substances, 
like carfentanil, which some of you are 
aware 
of, 
are 
even 
deadlier 
than 
fentanyl itself. 
To address this, the Drug Enforce-
ment Agency in 2018 used its authority 
to temporarily classify all fentanyl-re-
lated drugs as schedule I substances, 
which allows law enforcement to ag-
gressively intercept and destroy these 
substances. Unfortunately, this des-
ignation was only temporary. That is 
all DEA could do. 
So, in 2019, Congress extended that 
designation until May 6, 2021, so a 2- 
year extension until 14 days from now. 
If that deadline lapses 14 days from 
now, criminals who run labs in China 
and Mexico will be able to avoid law 
enforcement as they flood the United 
States with unlimited slight variants 
of fentanyl that are just as deadly. We 
can’t let that happen. 
Let me say that again. At a time 
when we are experiencing an alarming 
rise in overdose deaths that we see 
here, and fentanyl is the major culprit, 
the No. 1 killer, we may face a situa-
tion where law enforcement will lose 
the ability to aggressively stop these 
fentanyl copycats in the United States 
unless Congress acts in the next 14 
days. 
Fortunately, we have legislation to 
do 
that. 
Our 
bipartisan 
FIGHT 
Fentanyl Act, which I introduced with 
Senator JOE
MANCHIN, will fix this 
problem by permanently classifying 
fentanyl-related drugs as schedule I 
drugs. It would give our law enforce-
ment certainty to go after synthetic 
opioids in all their forms and show we 
are committed to addressing the threat 
posed by this dangerous class of drugs. 
Our proposal is the one bipartisan ap-
proach to this in the Senate. We struc-
tured it to address concerns from the 
criminal justice community and made 
sure it does not impose mandatory 
minimum sentencing under criminal 
charges brought under our bill. That 
has been one of the concerns expressed, 
particularly by some on the other side 
of the aisle. So we took that out. 
I urge my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to come to the table and sup-
port this urgent legislation. 
The House just passed a 5-month ex-
tension this week. That is, to me, very 
sad. Let’s make this permanent. There 
is no reason to do a short-term exten-
sion and to create the uncertainty with 
law enforcement, and, frankly, to tell 
these evil scientists in places like 
China, in 5 months, you are going to be 
able, potentially—to be able to sell this 
substance 
again 
without 
worrying 
about the law. This makes no sense. 
Let’s make it permanent. Let’s give 
the DEA the authority to do what they 
need to do. And by doing so, let’s re-
duce the amount coming in, which in-
creases the cost on the street, which is 
an important step toward rededicating 
our efforts to stop these drugs from 
stealing thousands of lives and causing 
so much pain. 
In conclusion, I urge my colleagues— 
our Nation faces a crisis. It is the 
coronavirus pandemic that is finally 
winding down, but it is also the addic-
tion crisis. It has been happening un-
derneath the coronavirus. As was said 
by my constituent—this woman who 
unfortunately has faced addiction in 
her own family—we have been here the 
whole time, and it hasn’t gotten better; 
it has gotten worse. 
Many of its victims are suffering in 
silence. We know a lot about what is 
going on with COVID. We don’t know a 
lot about what is going on with this 
pandemic, this epidemic of drugs. 
So let’s act now, without delay. We 
have 14 days until DEA loses the au-
thority to go after dangerous fentanyl 
copycats, but we can do something 
about it. We can pass legislation right 
now that will help people at their point 
of pain, as well as provide law enforce-
ment the tools to cut off the source of 
their suffering—both the CARA 3.0 leg-
islation to deal with the demand side 
and the legislation to be sure this poi-
son can’t come into our communities 
freely. 
As the CDC data shows, this is an 
issue that affects every single one of 
us. Forty-nine States have seen a big 
increase. We know we need to do it. 
Let’s not wait any longer to get to 
work once again turning the tide on 
our addiction crisis. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
TRIBUTE TO BETH TROWBRIDGE 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, it 
is Thursday, and by now many know— 
particularly our members of our press 
corps—that it is time for what I feel is 
probably one of the best moments in 
the Senate each week. It is time for the 
‘‘Alaskan of the Week.’’ 
We get to talk about Alaska, talk 
about somebody who is doing extraor-
dinary things for our State, for our 
country a lot of times, and I like to 
give an update when I do my ‘‘Alaskan 
of the Week’’ speech on what is going 
on in Alaska. 
It is spring, of course. The Sun is 
high in most parts of the State—actu-
ally, in all parts of the State. Spring— 
we call it breakup, actually, relating to 
the ice on the rivers—it is upon us. 
Now, of course, it can still snow, and 
it still gets pretty cold in a lot of 
places in Alaska, but winter is on the 
run. The promise of summer is in the 
air, and what a glorious summer it is 
going to be. 
We aren’t out of the woods yet on the 
pandemic in Alaska, but we have man-
aged—we are proud of it, I am proud of 
my fellow Alaskans—the pandemic, the 
virus, as well as possible. 
One of the things that is happening 
right now, our vaccination rates have 
been, almost from the beginning when 
we got the vaccine, the highest per cap-
ita in the country. Despite our huge 
challenges in terms of size, limited 
population, it is really kind of a 
minimiracle—No. 1 vaccination rates 
in America in Alaska. We did it by dog 
sled, snow machine, small airplanes to 
make that happen. 
So if you are watching, America, 
please come on up to Alaska. It is safe. 
It is open for tourism. This summer we 
want you to come on up. 
By the way, not only will you have 
an amazing experience, our State just 
announced a few days ago you will get 
a vaccine if you come to Alaska. If 
your State is too inefficient or bureau-
cratic to actually get a vaccine, come 
on up to Alaska. You can have the trip 
of a lifetime, and you and your family 
can get vaccinated. We want you up 
there. We are open for business. We 
want to see Americans come on up and 
enjoy our great State as we are getting 
through this pandemic. 
It is a naturally beautiful place, you 
will see, but the people in my State 
work hard to keep it pristine and are 
really what makes it such a great 
place. 
So, today, in honor of Earth Day, I 
wanted to honor Homer, AK, resident 
Beth Trowbridge, who has spent her ca-
reer—about 40 years, four decades— 
working to keep our waters in Alaska 
and our beaches clean and pristine. 
So let me tell you a little bit about 
Beth. Originally from St. Louis, Beth 
first came to Alaska in 1981 as a college 
student to work on the Youth Con-
servation Corps in Fairbanks, AK, the 
interior. 
She only intended to stay a year or 
so—by the way, this is a very common 
story—only intended to stay a year or 
so, but as so many do, she got to Alas-
ka and fell in love with the State so 
she transferred to the University of 
Alaska in Fairbanks where she got her 
degree in Northern and Alaska Native 
studies. 
Now, Beth loves the wilderness. She 
loves living off the land, studying the 
plants, studying the animals. She said: 
‘‘There are beautiful and amazing peo-
ple and amazing resources’’ in Alaska. 
She said she always loved the sense 
that, while we can all live there, na-
ture in Alaska is always in control— 
the earthquakes, the volcanoes, the ex-
treme weather, the coldness. They are 
a constant reminder that, in her words, 
in Alaska ‘‘there are the bigger forces 
out there’’—a lot bigger, and she wants 
to keep it that way. 
So she became a steward of her envi-
ronment and dedicated her life to edu-
cating others so that they, too, could 
become stewards. 
With all the talk about climate 
change, I fear that not nearly enough 
attention is given to those outside of 
politics, like in this town, who work 
day in and day out to care for the envi-
ronment in the place they call home— 
in their communities, in their States, 
every day on the ground at home, mak-
ing a difference.

April 22, 2021 
That is what Beth has done. After 
college, she got a job as the education 
coordinator for the Prince William 
Sound Science Center, where she au-
thored the ‘‘Alaska Oil Spill Cur-
riculum.’’ 
Then, in 2000, she began her work—in 
many ways, her life’s work—for the 
Center for Alaskan Coastal Studies, or 
CACS, in the drop-dead gorgeous com-
munity of Homer, AK, surrounded by 
the beautiful Kachemak Bay. Some 
people call Homer ‘‘the place where the 
land ends and the sea begins’’; others, 
‘‘the cosmic hamlet by the sea’’; and 
others, ‘‘the halibut capital of the 
world.’’ 
If you haven’t visited Homer, Amer-
ica, you have got to go to Homer. My 
goodness, it is beautiful. In Alaska, we 
just call it awesome, in part because of 
people like Beth and organizations like 
hers that keep it that way. 
In 2012, Beth became the organiza-
tion’s executive director and helped ex-
pand the good work that CACS has 
been doing since 1982. 
Now, this organization is primarily 
an educational organization and offers 
people of all ages, really from across 
the globe—not just Alaska, not just 
America, everywhere—opportunities to 
connect with the outdoors, learn about 
coastal environments through guided 
walks, tours, educational programs, 
overnight school programs, and so 
much more. 
So think about this impact. Homer, 
where CACS is located, is a town of 
about 6,000 people. CACS educates 
roughly 16,000 people through these 
science-based programs every year. 
That is a big impact. They have camps 
for everyone, and I would encourage 
anyone who is listening who is going to 
go to Homer to sign up for one of these 
camps to explore the unique marine 
ecology, the tidal pools, and the abun-
dant sea life; to watch whales, seals, 
and sea lions; to swim against the 
backdrop of the Kenai Mountains; and 
to go into the forest and learn about 
the forest, wildlife, and adaptation in 
the forest. There is so much to do. 
One of the big initiatives of this im-
portant organization is to deal with 
marine debris. So today, on Earth Day, 
let me put a plug in for the marine de-
bris programs in my State and across 
the country. This is an issue that I 
have been very focused on since my 
time as a U.S. Senator, working with 
my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle. We have gotten a lot done. 
We passed the Save Our Seas Act a 
couple of Congresses ago, and we 
passed the Save Our Seas Act 2.0, 
which 
the 
Congressional 
Research 
Service called the most comprehensive 
ocean cleanup legislation ever in the 
history of the Senate. It was just 
passed and signed into law in Decem-
ber. So we are making progress. 
I do want to give a shout-out to one 
of my good friends, Senator SHELDON 
WHITEHOUSE. You know, some of us 
miss his weekly ‘‘Wake Up’’ speeches. I 
think mine is the only weekly speech 
anymore. Senator WHITEHOUSE, I am 
not sure what happened. But Senator 
WHITEHOUSE and I have worked closely 
on this kind of legislation—ocean de-
bris, ocean cleanup, and to help organi-
zations like CACS with marine debris 
cleanup and to call attention to this 
issue that is solvable. We can solve 
this—marine debris, ocean plastics— 
and it is bringing a lot of people in 
America and across the world together. 
One of CACS’s biggest annual events 
is the annual Kachemak Bay Coast 
Walk. It involves more than 200 volun-
teers who adopt a section of Kachemak 
Bay shoreline. And, again, you have 
got to visit Kachemak Bay, one of the 
most beautiful places on the planet 
Earth. Trust me. Surveying changes, 
collecting data on marine life and 
human impact and cleaning up beach 
litter and marine debris is what people 
do every year with the Kachemak Bay 
Coast Walk. It is the kind of great 
local work that really makes a dif-
ference. It brings people from all across 
Alaska together—people who know how 
special and beautiful Kachemak Bay 
is—and it creates community. It cre-
ates community, and that is so impor-
tant, not just for our State but for our 
oceans and the coastline. 
So that is one of the many things 
Beth has done. 
Beth and her husband, Charlie, who is 
a retired shellfish biologist with the 
Alaska Department of Fish and Game 
have four children. The youngest is fin-
ishing eighth grade, and the oldest is 
33. 
Beth develops environmental cur-
riculums for schools. She is a Rotarian, 
a Girl Scout leader, and keeps CACS 
running seamlessly. She says she does 
all of this because she has a passion for 
sharing the outdoors with people— 
Alaskans, Americans, people from all 
over the world, but especially the next 
generation—and she hopes that her 
work not only will have an immediate 
impact on the environment but helps 
people to understand the challenges of 
our oceans and to focus more on clean-
up, because who doesn’t want to clean 
up our oceans? 
Local businesses, she is noticing, are 
using more recyclable material. People 
are leaving less trash behind. People 
are talking more about cleanup and 
ownership, and that is how you make a 
difference at the local level, and it 
spreads out all over the State and the 
country. 
Beth said: 
I hope that, through my work, we can pro-
vide the opportunities to understand and ap-
preciate nature. I am proud of where I live. 
I love Homer. I want to take care of it. I 
hope that others [in the community] feel 
that way too. 
Beth, that is a great sentiment, and 
it is also one of the many reasons we 
are proud to honor you today with this 
very prestigious award, being our Alas-
kan of the Week. Congratulations.

EARTH DAY 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, today is 
a special day. It is Earth Day. I had the 
privilege of actually being at the first 
Earth Day, at Golden Gate Park, a mil-
lion years ago. The speaker there that 
day was Ralph Nader, and there was a 
huge crowd. Hundreds of thousands of 
people were there. 
Ralph Nader made a lot of fame and 
fortune writing a book called ‘‘Unsafe 
at Any Speed,’’ about the Corvair 
Monza. That was my first car, a 
Corvair Monza. And as he was there 
speaking that day, I couldn’t help but 
think about how much I loved my 
Corvair Monza and couldn’t believe he 
wrote that book about it. 
He actually made a lot of sense and, 
certainly, it was a rallying point for 
people in this country who realized 
that we were going the wrong way in 
terms of the cleanliness of our air and 
the cleanliness of our water. 
I had gone to Ohio State and was a 
Navy ROTC midshipman there, and I 
ended up in Southeast Asia. I remem-
ber being over in Southeast Asia on 
one of our deployments, and the Cuya-
hoga River, up the road from Ohio 
State, in Cleveland, OH, caught on fire. 
They had too many people drinking the 
dirty water. 
I liked to run outside. I know our 
Presiding Officer is a big athlete as 
well. I know there were days that I 
would run outside, in the 1960s and 
1970s—and in some places, even now, 
around the world—and I was doing 
more damage than good by breathing 
the air in those places. 
But some amazing things happened 
in 1970, right around 1970. We saw the 
creation of the Environmental Protec-
tion Agency. I don’t think it was done 
initially as a bill. I think it was actu-
ally done sort of as an Executive order. 
Richard Nixon was the President then. 
I think the Congress came along a 
few years later and sort of passed legis-
lation to implement the Executive 
order. The Clean Air Act was signed 
into law. The Clean Water Act was 
passed. I think Richard Nixon initially

April 22, 2021 
vetoed the Clean Water Act. But they 
had huge support—overwhelming sup-
port, Democrat and Republican—for 
both measures. 
We didn’t give a whole lot of concern 
in those days to climate change. No-
body really talked, in the 1960s and the 
1970s 
or 
the 
1980s, 
about 
climate 
change. But something started hap-
pening on our planet. People said: I 
think it is getting warmer. The weath-
er seems to be a bit more extreme as 
time goes by. 
Then scientists reported that a hole 
was being formed in the ozone layer 
over the North Pole, and it started off 
small and got bigger and bigger and 
bigger. And people a lot smarter than 
me said: This is not good. We have to 
figure out what is going on here. 
They finally figured out that it was 
something 
called 
CFCs, 
or 
chlorofluorocarbons, which were actu-
ally found in our air-conditioners, our 
freezers, and refrigerators. They did a 
really good job in keeping things cool, 
including us, but, unfortunately, it led 
to the hole in the ozone. 
So some really smart scientists got 
to work, and they came up with some-
thing called HFCs, hydrofluorocarbons. 
HFCs did a really good job keeping us 
cool. They also did a good job in terms 
of the hole in the ozone going away. 
But the bad thing about HFCs, or 
hydrofluorocarbons, is that they are a 
thousand 
times 
worse 
for 
climate 
change, the warming of our climate, 
than carbon, carbon dioxide. So some 
good but some bad as well. 
We passed the legislation, and it was 
signed—I think unbeknownst to him— 
last December, by the President. It is 
legislation that phases down HFCs, or 
hydrofluorocarbons. So now we are 
going to have American-made products 
that will keep us cool and will be good 
and positive with respect to climate 
change, and will create a lot of jobs— 
tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of 
thousands of jobs, American jobs with 
American technology—and strengthen 
our economy in a variety of different 
ways. 
So on this Earth Day, there is a lot 
to be concerned about, but the HFC 
phase-down that I just talked about 
was signed into law and was part of a 
much bigger package in December, 
that is worth a half a degree Celsius. 
Scientists will tell you that what we 
want is to be careful to not see the 
Earth temperature go up by more than 
2 or 3 degrees Celsius, and if we do, it 
becomes sort of irreversible and we are 
in real trouble then on this planet. 
But this one thing that we did, voted 
on here in this Chamber, phasing down 
HFCs, is worth about a half a degree 
Celsius. There is still more to do, but 
that is a good start. 
The greatest source of carbon dioxide 
on our planet is not HFCs, but it is the 
emissions from our cars, trucks, and 
vans—our mobile fleet. About 28 per-
cent of carbon emissions come from 
our cars, trucks, and vans. About an-
other 25 percent comes from utilities, 
powerplants that provide electricity 
for us, a lot of them powered by coal or 
natural gas—mostly coal. And another 
large source of carbon emissions is 
from 
industries. 
Think 
of 
cement 
plants, if you will. If you add those 
three together, it is about 75 percent of 
the carbon emissions in our country— 
just those three sources. 
There used to be a guy, a bank rob-
ber, whose name was Willie Sutton. 
You may or may not have heard of 
him. He lived during the Depression, 
before either of us. But he robbed a lot 
of banks. He finally got caught and 
ended up in trial before the judge. 
And the judge said: Mr. Sutton, why 
do you rob all those banks? 
And Willie Sutton replied, famously: 
That is where the money is, your 
Honor. That is where the money is. 
Well, one of the reasons why we focus 
on carbon emissions and global warm-
ing emissions coming from mobile 
sources is that that is 28 percent of the 
emissions. That is not where the 
money is, but that is where the emis-
sions are, where a lot of them are com-
ing from. 
And we are getting really exciting 
announcements from American compa-
nies, auto companies. GM has an-
nounced this year that starting in 2035, 
they will not be manufacturing cars, 
trucks, or vans that are burning gaso-
line or diesel fuel. They are just going 
to be electric. They will be using hy-
drogen and fuel cells. That is huge—by 
2035. That is only like 14 years away. 
Ford has made similar kinds of 
pledges. I think Volkswagen and a 
number of other companies have made 
similar pledges. And they are not 
pledges for things that will take place 
in like 40 or 50 years. We are talking 
about right down the road, right down 
the road. That is great news because 
the threat of climate change is immi-
nent, and we don’t have a lot of time to 
meet it. 
I was in a hearing this morning. One 
of the committees I serve on is Home-
land Security and Governmental Af-
fairs. One of the issues that we have 
that we are responsible for is the Post-
al Service. I think, maybe for reasons 
that go back to my time in the Viet-
nam war, of being overseas in the war 
and how, every week, when we would 
get the mail over there, it was the best 
part of the week. You would hear from 
your families, loved ones, friends, 
newspapers, magazines, care packages. 
It was a great day. 
So I have great affection for the 
Postal Service, even today. I love the 
idea of mail-in voting, and I know my 
friend from Georgia has some affection 
for people being able to participate and 
exercise their constitutional rights 
through the mail. And, hopefully, we 
will do more of that in smart ways like 
that in the future. 
But the Postal Service still provides 
a valuable service. We were reminded 
of that during the election last year. 
But the Postal Service, the men and 
women who drive around and deliver 
our mail, they drive around in vehicles 
that are, on average, 25 years and 
older. Almost all of them are diesel or 
gasoline powered. 
The Postal Service realizes that they 
need to upgrade their fleet, and they 
need to do that sooner than later. It is 
not cheap. It is not a cheap thing to 
do—165,000 mail trucks that need to be 
replaced in the next several years. 
There is a 10-year plan that the Post-
al Service has put out—how they plan 
to, sort of, and return to, if not to prof-
itability, at least to improve over time 
to a break-even situation. One of the 
things that is in their plan is to buy 
and replace their existing fleet of cars, 
trucks, and vans—mostly trucks and 
vans. 
They are apparently in a contract 
with a company up in Oshkosh, WI, 
called Oshkosh, and the idea is to build 
a bunch of vehicles, tens of thousands 
of them, over the next decade or so. 
We had three nominees today before 
us who have been nominated to be 
members of the Board of Governors of 
the Postal Service. In all, there are 
nine members of the Board of Gov-
ernors, nominated by the President, 
confirmed by the Senate. They have 
three vacancies, and we had three 
nominees to fill those vacancies before 
us. 
I wished them all a happy Earth Day, 
and then I talked to them about what 
lies ahead in terms of replacing 165,000 
vehicles. And, apparently, originally, 
the first couple of thousand vehicles 
that will be produced will be gas and 
diesel, and then, after that, the vehi-
cles could be gas, diesel, or electric—or 
hydrogen, for that matter. 
There is an extra cost when we 
switch to electric, extra costs when we 
switch over to, say, hydrogen, if that is 
the technology that is chosen, because 
you need electric charging stations and 
you need the hydrogen fueling stations. 
It is easy to take your gasoline-pow-
ered vehicle or your diesel-powered ve-
hicle to a gas station. It is on the cor-
ner. It is in your town. But if you need 
to get the electric charger for your bat-
tery or you need the hydrogen for your 
fuel cell vehicle, then that costs some 
money. And it can’t all be on the Post-
al Service. It can’t all be on the Postal 
Service. 
As we put together this next infra-
structure package for our country—and 
we are going to be debating here legis-
lation that Senator CAPITO and I on the 
Environment and Public Works Com-
mittee have been working on with our 
bipartisan team next week, a big pack-
age on wastewater treatment and on 
drinking water, clean drinking water. 
That will be the first big infrastructure 
bill that we pass, I think, in the Sen-
ate—hopefully, next week. But there 
will be, hopefully, a lot more. And part 
of that will be roads, highways, and 
bridges coming down the road. And 
part of that will be charging stations 
in densely populated corridors all over 
the 
country—charging 
stations 
for 
electric vehicles and fueling stations

for hydrogen vehicles, which have a lot 
of potential, too. 
I just want us to keep in mind, when 
that day comes—I want the Postal 
Service to keep in mind that we need 
for them to set an example—for the 
Postal Service to set an example. If 
they go out and two-thirds of the new 
vehicles they buy are gasoline- and die-
sel-powered, 
shame 
on 
them, 
and, 
frankly, shame on us in this body for 
allowing that to happen. 
But we have to remember that the 
Postal Service is fighting for its life, 
and we need to be there and be helpful 
in terms of helping to pay for the infra-
structure that they will need when 
they buy these new vehicles. 
I will close with this. Mr. President, 
I am not sure where Home Depot is 
headquartered. 
Are 
they 
not 
headquartered in Georgia? If they are, 
nod your head. I think they are. I love 
to talk about Home Depot. 
Whenever I go down to Central Amer-
ica, to places like Honduras, Guate-
mala, and El Salvador—we call them 
the Northern Triangle countries—we 
have something in place called the Al-
liance for Prosperity program. It is de-
signed to help fight corruption, their 
crime, their violence, and their lack of 
economic opportunity there. 
And we provide money—taxpayer 
money—to help these countries down 
there, so people will stop feeling like 
they have to come up here to escape 
the violence, the corruption, the crime, 
and the lack of economic opportunity. 
So we provide some money, and then 
we expect them, for every dollar we 
provide, to provide four or five dollars 
on their own. We want foundations to 
put up money. We want businesses to 
put up money to help produce this as 
well. 
I say to the people of Honduras, Gua-
temala, and El Salvador, who live in 
some really terrible situations, when I 
talk to them about the Alliance for 
Prosperity, which has been in place 
now for several years: You can do it. 
You, those three countries—Honduras, 
Guatemala, and El Salvador—you can 
do it. We can help, and I think we have 
a moral obligation to help. 
I think at the Postal Service, they 
can do it. They can update their fleet. 
They can do so in a way that is sus-
tainable and is actually good for this 
planet. This is the only planet we are 
going to have. We have to take care of 
it or, otherwise, face huge, huge chal-
lenges. 
So I would, on this Earth Day, say to 
my colleagues that the anniversary 
provides opportunity. The Postal Serv-
ice is going through its share of adver-
sity, as well, but there is real oppor-
tunity, as well, to help the Postal Serv-
ice and the men and women who work 
there to do a better and a more reliable 
job of delivering the mail to all of us 
but, also, to do so in a way that is good 
for our planet. 
That would be a very, very good 
thing and make this Earth Day espe-
cially memorable. 
Mr. President, with that, I am going 
to bid you adieu. Great weekend to you 
and the staff. God bless you. Thank you 
so much.

f 
COVID–19 HATE CRIMES ACT 
∑ Mr. LEE. Mr. President, over the 
past 13 months, Americans have en-
dured extraordinary constraints on one 
of the most precious rights guaranteed 
by our Constitution: the right to freely 
exercise their religion. There is, per-
haps, no freedom more intertwined 
with our nation’s history. It was reli-
gious freedom that drove persecuted 
settlers from England to America just 
over 400 years ago. And they were not 
the last. Over the centuries, countless 
religious minorities from across the 
world have come to America, seeking 
refuge from religious warfare and big-
otry. 
To be clear, we haven’t always lived 
up to this ideal. Members of the church 
to which I belong were forced to flee 
across the country due to religious per-
secution, to name just one example. 
Despite these aberrations, however, no 
nation in the history of the world has 
protected and preserved the rights of 
religion and conscience like the United 
States.And that’s not an accident. The 
First Congress recognized the profound 
importance of religious freedom by 
protecting it in the very first sentence 
of the Bill of Rights. That provision— 
called the First Amendment—states 
that ‘‘Congress shall make no law re-
specting an establishment of religion, 
or prohibiting the free exercise there-
of.’’ The Supreme Court has applied 
this prohibition to State and local gov-
ernments through the 14th Amend-
ment. 
So what does this mean, practically? 
First, governments cannot discrimi-
nate against religion or single it out 
for worse treatment than similar non-
religious activities. But, second, if a 
government does treat religion dif-
ferently than other similar activities, 
it must ’pass’’ the ‘‘strict scrutiny’’ 
test. That means that the government 
must show that there was absolutely 
no other way to achieve an extremely 
important goal than restricting the re-
ligious activity in question. 
The First Amendment is clear. Reli-
gious exercise must be protected. Nev-
ertheless, over the course of the pan-
demic, governments throughout the 
country have placed heavy-handed re-
strictions on this fundamental free-
dom, restricting Americans’ freedom to 
gather for worship, to meet in smaller 
groups for religious purposes, or even 
to sing. 
At first, Americans accepted these 
restrictions. We understood the ex-
traordinary difficulties facing our lead-
ers as they struggled to grapple with a 
new and deadly virus. And we were as-
sured that these restrictions would be 
temporary, lasting no longer than nec-
essary. But as the weeks and months 
dragged on and the prohibitions on re-
ligious exercise continued, we began to 
see a startling trend. As restrictions on 
restaurants, 
casinos, 
and 
museums 
began to thaw, in many states, syna-
gogues, churches, temples, mosques, 
and other religious gatherings were left 
out in the cold. 
In May 2020, the Governor of Cali-
fornia allowed some restaurants and 
retail businesses to operate indoors 
with up to 50 Percent capacity. Mean-
while, all indoor religious services—of

any size, and even with identical pre-
cautions—were outright banned. 
California was not alone. In Nevada, 
the Governor allowed gambling estab-
lishments to reopen in June, 2020. As 
thousands flooded into casinos along 
the Las Vegas strip, religious gath-
erings in Nevada remained strictly lim-
ited to 50 people. Likewise, in New 
York, houses of worship were explicitly 
singled out for worse treatment. In 
some areas, religious gatherings were 
restricted to only 10 people, while train 
stations, acupuncture facilities, and 
factories in that same area could allow 
entry to as many as they wished. 
And I could go on. Again, and again, 
COVID lookdown rules left religious 
Americans on the outside looking in. 
Despite several opportunities to over-
turn these clear, discriminatory re-
strictions, for most of 2020, the Su-
preme Court failed to intervene. In 
South Bay v. Newsom, five Justices— 
without explanation-declined to halt 
California’s ban on all religious serv-
ices. Likewise, in Calvary Chapel v. 
Sisolak, the Supreme Court left Ne-
vada’s discriminatory ban on houses of 
worship in place. And again, they did 
so without explanation. 
The pandemic stretched on. Some 
States eased restrictions, allowing wor-
shippers to gather. Others did not. Dur-
ing that time, countless weddings, bap-
tisms, holy days, and, perhaps most 
heartbreakingly—funerals—were 
ob-
served 
in 
isolation 
from 
family, 
friends, and community. Or not at all. 
Finally, in November of last year— 
after over 8 months of lockdowns—a 
ray of light broke through. In Roman 
Catholic Diocese v. Cuomo, the Court 
held that ‘‘even in a pandemic, the 
Constitution cannot be put away and 
forgotten. [New York’s] restrictions 
. . . strike at the very heart of the 
First Amendment’s guarantee of reli-
gious liberty.’’ Subsequent decisions 
earlier this year resurrected the First 
Amendment’s robust protections of re-
ligious liberty. Just a few weeks ago, 
in Tandon v. Newsom, the Supreme 
Court resoundingly affirmed religious 
freedom, summarily rejecting Califor-
nia’s 
discriminatory 
restrictions. 
Thanks to God, the First Amendment 
lives. 
It’s been a long road to get here. But 
we can’t ignore the lessons of the past 
13 months. That’s why I offered an 
amendment to S.937, the COVID–19 
Hate Crimes Act, which would require 
the Attorney General to create a re-
port detailing the restrictions imposed 
on religious exercise imposed during 
the pandemic. 
This amendment directs the Depart-
ment of Justice to look into: first, 
whether governments applied the same 
rules to religious groups that they ap-
plied to similar nonreligious organiza-
tions 
and 
businesses, 
and, 
second, 
whether those restrictions complied 
with the First Amendment. The goal 
here is simple-we need to understand 
and remember how Americans in 2020 
lost their religious freedoms in order to 
ensure that it never happens again.

RES. 27

unanimous consent to print the fol-
lowing letter in the CONGRESSIONAL

EARTH DAY 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I 
rise to join my friends in celebrating 
Earth Day. Senator Gaylord Nelson 
began the tradition in 1970, making 
today the 51st celebration of Earth 
Day. While it is always important to 
set aside a day to pause and reflect on 
our 
relationship 
with 
the 
natural 
world, I consider this Earth Day one of 
the most important yet. As we begin to 
emerge from the chaos of the COVID–19 
pandemic and reset our new ‘‘business 
as usual,’’ we are stepping into a new 
world, 
ripe 
with 
opportunity 
for 
progress on climate change with a 
more 
meaningful 
understanding 
of 
what it means to live in a global com-
munity. Our Nation and planet are at a 
crossroads in determining the future of 
our climate. With a new administra-
tion that understands the threat of cli-
mate change and the role of the United 
States as a global leader, we are at the 
precipice of bold action. 
The scientific consensus is that cli-
mate change will have devastating and 
far-reaching impacts on the environ-
ment, public health, and national secu-
rity, and we must mitigate and adapt. 
In 2018, the United Nations U.N. Inter-
governmental 
Panel 
on 
Climate 
Change, IPCC found that if a concerted 
multilateral effort is not made to keep 
global temperatures from rising 1.5 de-
grees Celsius 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit by 
2100, we will cross a tipping point and 
cause the worst damage by climate 
change. The scientific community has 
been sounding the alarm for years, 
which too many of our colleagues have 
chosen to ignore. 
The 
ongoing 
COVID–19 
pandemic 
highlighted the challenges and oppor-
tunities of our increasingly globalized 
world. More than ever, we are under-
standing how decisions governments, 
corporations, and individuals make 
have 
real-world 
impacts 
and 
con-
sequences. Actions that affect our cli-
mate are no different. An under-
standing of our impact in determining 
our collective future will only help us 
in our pursuit of a healthier planet. 
Fortunately, our communities have 
proven resilient and adaptable. Over 
the past year. Americans have been 
burdened with collective grief, fear, 
and uncertainty. Through it all, our 
Nation has demonstrated a grit and in-
genuity unlike anything we have seen 
in generations. We saw parents step up 
as teachers, corporations pivot their 
business models to keep people safe, 
and an entire population of office 
workers transition to working from 
home. In terms of action on climate 
change, this flexibility proves that a 
departure from the status quo is not as 
unrealistic as we may have thought 
previously. In fact, a change from 
‘‘business as usual’’ can have unfore-
seen benefits for our quality of life and 
our planet. 
Equipped with the lessoned learned 
from the COVID–19 pandemic, I am 
more confident than ever that our Na-
tion in ready to commit to action on 
climate change in earnest. Addition-
ally, the Biden administration is al-
ready pursuing an aggressive climate 
agenda by reversing President Trump’s 
shortsighted decisions and doubling 
down on President Obama’s environ-
mental regulations. The Build Back 
Better agenda recognizes both the need 
to mitigate emissions and prepare for 
the impacts of climate change that are 
already harming our communities. A 
great and overdue need to update our 
Nation’s infrastructure provides an op-
portunity to address some of our soci-
ety’s most insidious sources of pollu-
tion. 
Emissions from passenger and freight 
transport makes up the largest propor-
tion of our Nation’s total greenhouse 
gas emissions—nearly 30 percent. The 
Federal Government can and must 
work 
quickly 
to 
address 
climate 
change through transportation and in-
frastructure policy. As chair of the 
Transportation and Infrastructure Sub-
committee of the Senate Environment 
and Public Works Committee, I am 
committed to ensuring that any legis-
lation the committee considers ad-
dresses greenhouse gas emissions re-
ductions in a meaningful way. In 2019, 
the Senate Committee on Environment 
and Public Works unanimously re-
ported an innovative surface transpor-
tation reauthorization that indicates a 
genuine bipartisan interest in action 
on climate change. I am confident the 
newest iteration of this bill will be 
even more ambitious. 
The imperative to address climate 
change through transportation and in-
frastructure is particularly important 
to Maryland, a highly developed, low- 
lying coastal State with aging public 
works systems, which makes it par-
ticularly vulnerable to the impacts of 
climate change. My constituents and 
future generations have a right to good 
air quality, water quality, and the re-
silience of infrastructure assets like

roads, bridges, and storm and waste-
water systems. 
In recent years, Marylanders have 
seen firsthand the effects of climate 
change in my State. Intense rain-
storms 
have 
caused 
unprecedented 
flood damage to homes and businesses 
in Prince George’s County, Southwest 
Baltimore, Ellicott City, and Hagers-
town. The cost of rebuilding our infra-
structure after these storms is signifi-
cant. Unless we change the way we 
think about infrastructure in the fu-
ture, taxpayer investments will be 
washed away with the next big storm. 
I requested a Government Account-
ability Office GAO report on the Fed-
eral Government’s fiscal exposure to 
the effects of climate change. GAO 
found that in 2018, 14 separate natural 
and weather disasters occurred, costing 
the Federal Government a total of $91 
billion. Unsurprisingly, GAO deter-
mined that this amount will rise as cli-
mate change causes more frequent and 
more severe weather events. Inaction 
on this issue amounts to a gross neg-
ligence by Congress in our manage-
ment of taxpayers’ funds. I consider it 
my duty to ensure that the Federal 
Government takes full advantage of 
the opportunity before us to make 
long-sighted upgrades to our systems. 
In addition to building back physical 
infrastructure better, the Nation is in 
the process of rebuilding its reputation 
on the international stage as a leader 
on climate change. By rejoining the 
Paris Agreement, the United States is 
signaling its commitment to the global 
community. As I speak, the President 
is hosting the Leaders Summit on Cli-
mate, where world leaders will outline 
how their countries will commit to 
their own ambitious goals. The United 
States is committing to a bold 2030 
emissions target as its new nationally 
determined 
contribution 
under 
the 
Paris Agreement. This summit rep-
resents the formal return of the United 
States to its leadership position and an 
opportunity to regain the trust from 
our international partners that Presi-
dent Trump decimated. 
When President Trump withdrew the 
United States from the Paris Agree-
ment, I helped to maintain relation-
ships with our partner-members by in-
troducing a bipartisan resolution that 
expressed support for the Paris Agree-
ment and assuring the international 
community 
that, 
despite 
President 
Trump’s abdication of his duties, lead-
ers on climate change in the U.S. Sen-
ate remained. I previously led the U.S. 
congressional delegation to the con-
ference where the Paris Agreement was 
adopted and will continue to position 
our Nation as a strong partner in the 
international fight against warming 
global temperatures. 
Domestically. this Earth Day, I will 
recommit to my long-term endeavor to 
preserve and restore the Chesapeake 
Bay. The Chesapeake Bay is the life-
blood of the State of Maryland, and the 
communities that depend on it are see-
ing their livelihood threatened as the 
climate changes. Saltwater intrusion 
on agricultural lands and fragile fish-
eries make it harder for Maryland 
farmers and fishers to earn a living. In 
some cases, Marylanders are seeing 
their communities disappear before 
their eyes from the dual threat of sea 
level rise and subsidence. A healthy 
Chesapeake Bay watershed is essential 
to a thriving economy. Additionally, 
the Chesapeake Bay’s wetlands are 
Maryland’s best defense against cli-
mate change-induced flooding, as they 
act as natural buffers to storm surge 
during severe weather. 
The good news is that action on cli-
mate change, through international 
commitments, domestic infrastructure 
improvements, and restoring regional 
natural resources like the Chesapeake 
Bay, 
will 
stimulate 
our 
economy. 
Stewardship of our environmental can 
and should go hand in hand with eco-
nomic development. Our Nation will be 
grappling with the economic fallout of 
the COVID–19 pandemic for years to 
come, and bold Federal action is a 
time-tested practice for economic re-
covery. A truly bold investment in ac-
tion on climate change will pay divi-
dends for generations to come, but it 
must meet the size and urgency of the 
challenge before us. 
I am certain that our Nation can 
honor our planet and our future gen-
erations with urgent, thoughtful deci-
sion-making. Earth Day is one of the 
most celebrated secular holidays in the 
world and for good reason. We are all 
stewards of our planet and now more 
than ever understand that we are on a 
journey together. I will embrace this 
Earth Day and the opportunities for 
progress that lie ahead. I hope my Sen-
ate colleagues and all Americans will 
join me honoring our planet through 
diligent work, today and every day.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO MARY LILLY SMITH 
∑ Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor a Springfield, MO, resi-
dent who has dedicated 38 years of her 
life in service to the city of Springfield 
by helping facilitate economic develop-
ment, creating and retaining thousands 
of jobs, and bringing life to the down-
town area. Mary Lilly Smith started 
her career in 1983 as a city planner for 
downtown 
Springfield, 
where 
she 
helped create the city’s initial neigh-
borhood conservation office. During 
the next 38 years, Mary played an in-
strumental role in nearly 100 key eco-
nomic initiatives. 
Mary is best known for her 17 years 
as the economic development director. 
Along with her commitment to the 
downtown area, she created the Eco-
nomic Development Incentives Policy 
Manual, which became a template for 
other towns and cities across the State 
to implement development policies. In 
addition to her economic development 
initiatives, Mary made sure to preserve 
the city of Springfield’s incredible his-
tory. Throughout her nearly four dec-
ades of service, Mary has developed 
many different approaches to pre-
serving and honoring the history of the 
area. She also developed the city’s first 
capital improvement program, which 
facilitated a change in the review proc-
ess for protecting architecturally sig-
nificant historical properties. 
Mary leaves behind a legacy for the 
city of Springfield to be enjoyed by all 
for years to come. For her many years 
of service, she has earned her retire-
ment. As she enters this new chapter of 
her life, I offer Mary best wishes.∑

for nearly 30 years of service in law en-
forcement in Montana. 
Rod first entered law enforcement in 
1991 at the age of 21 and moved up the 
ranks swiftly. In 2004, he became Chief 
Deputy Marshal and later served as 
acting U.S. Marshal when his prede-
cessor retired. 
In 2018, I had the distinct honor of 
nominating Rod to become the U.S. 
Marshal for Montana, which received 
unanimous approval in the U.S. Sen-
ate. He was then officially appointed 
by President Trump. 
Rod is a Montana native from the 
south side of Billings. He later at-
tended Montana State University to 
earn his bachelor’s degree in criminal 
justice. 
Since his retirement from law en-
forcement, Rod went on to become the 
executive 
director 
of 
the 
Mental 
Health Center in Billings, where he 
continues to help combat the meth cri-
sis we have in Montana in a different 
capacity. He exemplifies what it means 
to make one’s community better. 
It is my honor to recognize Rod for 
his decades of service to Montana’s law 
enforcement and for his continued ef-
forts to make Montana a safer and bet-
ter place for all.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTION 
By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. 
CARDIN, Mr. MARSHALL, and 
Mrs. SHAHEEN): 
S. 1309. A bill to provide payments 
for home health services furnished via 
visual or audio telecommunications 
systems during an emergency period; 
to the Committee on Finance. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise 
today, along with my colleagues Sen-
ator CARDIN, Senator MARSHALL, and 
Senator SHAHEEN, to introduce the 
Home Health Emergency Access to 
Telehealth (HEAT) Act. This bipar-
tisan bill would help ensure that sen-
iors who rely on home health care have 
the choice to receive these critical 
services through telehealth during the 
COVID–19 pandemic and future public 
health emergencies. 
COVID–19 
is 
the 
greatest 
public 
health challenge since the flu pan-
demic of 1918 and has claimed the lives 
of more than 565,000 Americans. This 
public health emergency has under-
scored the need for older adults and 
other at-risk populations to have ac-
cess to health care in the home setting. 
Home-based care is crucial to ensuring 
that this pandemic does not create dev-
astating 
long-term 
health 
con-
sequences due to delayed care. The 
highly skilled and compassionate care 
that home health agencies provide is 
an important component of this in- 
home care. 
I have been a strong supporter of 
home care since my very first home 
visit, which took place in my home-
town in Aroostook County early in my 
Senate service. This experience gave 
me the opportunity to meet and visit 
with home health patients, where I saw 
first-hand what a difference highly 
skilled and caring visiting nurses and 
other health care professionals make 
to the lives of patients and their fami-
lies. I have been a passionate advocate 
for home care ever since. 
Last 
year, 
my 
bipartisan 
home 
health legislation, the Home Health 
Care Planning Improvement Act, be-
came law as part of the Coronavirus 
Aid, Relief, and Economic Security 
(CARES) Act. This law, which I cham-
pioned for 13 years, will improve the 
access Medicare beneficiaries have to 
home health care by allowing physi-
cian assistants, nurse practitioners, 
clinical nurse specialists, and certified 
nurse midwives to order home health 
services. Far too often seniors experi-
ence unnecessary delays in accessing 
home health care. To avoid these need-
less delays, it is common sense that 
other medical professionals who are fa-
miliar with a patient’s case should be 
able to order these services. 
Home health professionals have con-
tinued to provide face-to-face services 
during the COVID–19 public health 
emergency, but this crisis has created 
additional challenges, including the 
need to maintain an adequate supply of 
personal protective equipment to pro-
tect themselves, their patients, and 
their patients’ families. The use of 
telehealth and virtual visits can help 
address these challenges. Unlike other 
Medicare providers, however, home 
health agencies are not eligible to re-
ceive Medicare reimbursement for tele-
health services during the COVID–19 
emergency. 
Last May, I chaired Congress’ first 
hearing examining COVID–19’s dev-
astating impact on seniors. During the 
hearing, Dr. Steven Landers, President 
and CEO of the Visiting Nurse Associa-
tion Health Group, testified that, de-
spite this lack of Medicare reimburse-
ment, his organization has found tele-
health to be an essential part of pro-
viding high quality home health care 
during the COVID–19 public health 
emergency. He urged action to ensure 
that home health providers can con-
tinue offering these critical services re-
motely. 
Maine home health care providers 
have also shared their stories about 
how telehealth is helping them to con-
tinue caring for their patients during 
COVID–19. Through a combination of 
video visits and care calls, one provider 
has been able to care for a woman with 
severe heart and lung disease and keep 
this patient out of the hospital. The 
nurse would speak with the woman by 
phone a couple of times per week to as-
sess any symptoms that needed follow 
up. If the nurse identified an issue dur-
ing the call, she would schedule a video 
visit and also work with the patient’s 
physician to modify medications as 
needed. 
The bill we are introducing today 
would authorize Medicare reimburse-
ment for home health services provided 
through telehealth during an emer-
gency period. The services would not be 
reimbursed unless the beneficiary con-
sents to receiving the services via tele-
health. To ensure that the Medicare 
home health benefit does not become a 
telehealth-only benefit, Medicare reim-
bursement would only be provided if 
the telehealth services constitute no 
more than half of the billable visits 
made during the 30-day payment pe-
riod. The Secretary of Health and 
Human Services would be required to 
issue guidance on the authorization of 
and payment for home health services 
provided via telehealth. 
Home health serves a vital role in 
helping our Nation’s seniors avoid 
more costly hospital visits and nursing 
home 
stays. 
The 
COVID–19 
emergencyhas further underscored the 
critical importance of home health 
services and highlighted how these 
agencies are able to use telehealth to 
provide skilled care to their patients. 
The Home Health Emergency Access to 
Telehealth (HEAT) Act would ensure 
that seniors in Maine and across the 
country retain access to remote home 
health services during the COVID–19 
emergency and future public health 
emergencies. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

By Mr. REED (for himself and 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN): 
S. 1343. A bill to amend the Fair 
Credit Reporting Act to require that a 
consumer authorize the release of cer-
tain information; to the Committee on 
Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. 
Mr. REED. I am joined by Senator 
VAN HOLLEN in reintroducing the Con-
sumer Credit Control Act, which gives 
consumers greater control over when 
and how their consumer reports are 
shared by consumer reporting agencies. 
Our current consumer reporting sys-
tem is backwards. Consumer reporting 
agencies collect massive amounts of 
personal information on consumers, 
often without their knowledge, in order 
to compile consumer reports. These re-
ports are then shared with financial in-
stitutions and others, often without 
consent. 
Following Equifax’s failure in 2017 to 
secure troves of valuable personally 
identifiable information it collected on 
approximately 147 million Americans, 
it remains clear that this system needs 
to change. Indeed, the National Con-
sumer Law Center’s Chi Chi Wu stated 
in her October 2017 testimony before 
the House Financial Services Com-
mittee that the Equifax breach ‘‘means 
half of the US population and nearly 
three-quarters of the consumers with 
active credit reports are now at risk of 
identity theft due to one of the worst— 
if not the worst—breaches of consumer 
data in American history. These Amer-
icans are at risk of having false new 
credit accounts, phony tax returns, and 
even spurious medical bills incurred in 
their good names.’’ To make matters 
worse, the risks of identity fraud may 
only 
increase 
with 
time. 
As

Mierzwinski, U.S. PIRG’s federal Con-
sumer Program Director, explains ‘‘un-
like credit card numbers, your Social 
Security Number and Date of Birth 
don’t change and may even grow more

valuable over time, like gold in a bank 
vault. Much worse, they are the keys 
to ‘new account identity theft.’ ’’ 
The Consumer Credit Control Act 
aims to address these concerns and fix 
the current upside down system. Our 
legislation, at no cost to the consumer, 
seeks to give Americans greater con-
trol over when and how their consumer 
reports are released when applying for 
new credit, a loan, or insurance. It also 
requires consumer reporting agencies 
to verify a consumer’s identity and se-
cure the consumer’s permission before 
releasing 
consumer 
reports 
in 
in-
stances that are particularly suscep-
tible to identity theft and fraud. Addi-
tionally, our legislation requires every 
consumer reporting agency to take ap-
propriate steps to prevent unauthor-
ized access to the consumer reports and 
personal information they maintain. 
These changes are intended to make it 
tougher for criminals to open new 
fraudulent credit or insurance accounts 
in other people’s names. 
I urge our colleagues to cosponsor 
the Consumer Credit Control Act, and I 
thank Senator VAN HOLLEN, the Na-
tional Consumer Law Center (on behalf 
of its low-income clients), U.S. PIRG, 
Americans for Financial Reform, the 
Center for Digital Democracy, Con-
sumer Action, the Consumer Federa-
tion of America, Consumer Reports, 
Demos, the NAACP, the National Asso-
ciation of Consumer Advocates, the Na-
tional Fair Housing Alliance, Public 
Citizen, Tennessee Citizen Action, and 
the Woodstock Institute for their sup-
port.

By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and 
Mr. CARPER): 
S. 1345. A bill to establish a national 
mercury monitoring program, and for 
other purposes; to the Committee on 
Environment and Public Works. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today 
is Earth Day, and there are many 
issues, environmental challenges, that 
each of us could be discussing here on 
the Senate floor. 
I have chosen to speak on a bill that 
I am introducing today that is called 
the Comprehensive National Mercury 
Monitoring Act. I am pleased to be 
partnering, once again, with my col-
league from Delaware, Senator CAR-
PER, who serves as the chairman of the 
Senate Environment and Public Works 
Committee. Our bipartisan bill would 
help ensure that we have accurate in-
formation about the extent of mercury 
pollution in our country. 
Mercury is a potent neurotoxin. It 
poses significant ecological and public 
health concerns, especially for children 
and pregnant women. Mercury expo-
sure has gone down as U.S. mercury 
emissions have declined. However, the 
levels remain unacceptably high. 
It is estimated that nearly 200,000 
children born in the United States have 
been exposed to levels of mercury in 
the womb that are high enough to im-
pair their neurological development. 
This exposure can impose a lifelong 
disability. 
In addition, the societal costs of 
neurocognitive deficits associated with 
mercury exposure are estimated to be 
approximately $4.8 billion per year. 
In Maine, some of our lands and bod-
ies of water face higher mercury pollu-
tion compared to the national average. 
Maine has been called the tailpipe of 
the Nation, as the winds carrying pol-
lution, including mercury, from the 
West drift into the State of Maine 
A system for collecting information, 
such as we have for acid rain and other 
forms of pollution, does not currently 
exist for mercury, which, ironically, is 
a more toxic pollutant. A comprehen-
sive mercury monitoring network is 
needed to protect human health, safe-
guard our fisheries, and track the ef-
fect of emission reductions. This moni-
toring network would also help policy-
makers, scientists, and the public bet-
ter 
understand 
the 
sources, 
con-
sequences, and trends of mercury pollu-
tion in our country. 
Specifically, our legislation would do 
the following: 
First, it would direct the EPA, in 
conjunction with the Fish and Wildlife 
Service, the U.S. Geological Survey, 
the National Park Service, the Nation-
al Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminis-
tration, and other Federal Agencies, to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2173 
April 22, 2021 
establish a national mercury moni-
toring program to measure and mon-
itor mercury levels in the air and wa-
tersheds, water and soil chemistry, and 
in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial 
organisms at multiple sites across the 
Nation. 
Second, it would establish a sci-
entific advisory committee to advise 
on the establishment, site selection, 
measurement, recording protocols, and 
operations of this monitoring program. 
Third, our bill would establish a cen-
tralized 
database 
for 
existing 
and 
newly collected environmental mer-
cury data that can be freely accessed 
on the internet and that is compatible 
with similar international efforts. 
Fourth, our bill would require a re-
port to Congress every 2 years on the 
program, including trend data, and an 
assessment every 4 years of the reduc-
tion in mercury deposition rates that 
needs to be achieved in order to pre-
vent adverse human and ecological ef-
fects on our environment. 
Fifth, our bill would authorize $95 
million over 3 years for these purposes. 
We must establish a comprehensive, 
robust national mercury monitoring 
network. Otherwise, we will lack the 
data we need to help make informed 
decisions that can help protect the peo-
ple of Maine and the Nation, particu-
larly 
our 
children 
and 
pregnant 
women. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
supporting this bipartisan bill, the 
Comprehensive National Mercury Mon-
itoring Act. 
Thank you. 
By Mr. CORNYN (for himself and 
Ms. SINEMA): 
S. 1358. A bill to establish regional 
processing centers, to improve the asy-
lum and credible fear processes to pro-
mote fairness and efficiency, to require 
immigration court docketing priorities 
during 
irregular 
migration 
influx 
events, and to improve the capability 
of the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity to manage migration flows, and 
for other purposes; to the Committee 
on the Judiciary. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, over the 
last few months, we have been spending 
a lot of time talking about the surge of 
migrants at our southern border and, 
as the Presiding Officer knows, we are 
having bipartisan meetings here to try 
to figure out how to address that and 
other challenges of our broken immi-
gration system. 
We know the spike in migration is 
not a new phenomenon, and sadly, nei-
ther is the increase in the number of 
unaccompanied children. But the cur-
rent surge is unlike anything we have 
experienced in the past. We are break-
ing all the wrong kinds of records, in-
cluding the numbers of unaccompanied 
children, total monthly border cross-
ings, and capacity levels at care facili-
ties. And, of course, all of this is hap-
pening during a pandemic which cre-
ates serious risks for our law enforce-
ment and for those caring for these mi-
grants and for the migrants them-
selves. 
Unfortunately, 
the 
administration 
has not yet figured out how to stop this 
flow of illegal immigration. The Presi-
dent and his team are telling migrants: 
Don’t come. But when it comes to his 
policies, all of his policies say: Come 
while you can. 
They haven’t figured out how to re-
place Trump-era policies, and so what 
they have done is left a void that is 
being exploited by everybody from the 
coyotes, the human smugglers, the peo-
ple who smuggle in drugs into the 
United States, as well as the people 
who understandably want a better life. 
Maybe they are fleeing poverty or vio-
lence. We all understand why people 
want to come to the United States, but 
we also believe the safest and fairest 
sort of immigration policy is legal im-
migration into our country. 
We are the most generous country in 
the world. We have naturalized about a 
million people a year. It is one of our 
comparative advantages compared to 
the rest of the world that restricts mi-
gration. Over the last few months, like 
many of us, I have spent a lot of time 
listening and learning from the folks 
on the ground in Texas who know the 
ins and outs of this topic better than 
anybody else. 
I have visited border communities 
and heard from Border Patrol officers, 
mayors, county judges, and nongovern-
mental organizations that try to help 
these migrants once they make their 
way to the United States, and whose 
experience precedes this current surge. 
I visited five of the facilities in Texas 
that are helping take care of the record 
number of migrant children in Carrizo 
Springs, Donna, Houston, Midland, and 
Dallas. I have heard about the heart-
breaking circumstances under which 
many of these children have arrived on 
our doorsteps. I have seen the incred-
ible ways that our nongovernmental 
organizations, like Catholic Charities, 
are trying to ease the burden of this 
crisis, even after a year of supporting 
their communities through a global 
pandemic. 
The reality of this situation is that 
we are quickly nearing a breaking 
point. We lack the facilities, the per-
sonnel, the resources, and the policies 
needed to manage this crisis. Law en-
forcement in border communities are 
being overwhelmed by the sharp in-
crease in migration, and unless some-
thing changes, the entire system could 
collapse. 
The light is flashing red, and the 
time for action is now. That is why 
today I am proud to introduce the bi-
partisan Border Solutions Act, along 
with Senator SINEMA, to address this 
crisis. 
It is no accident that both of us rep-
resent border States and that both of 
us have heard from our communities 
and stakeholders on the ground about 
how important it is for Congress to 
step up and provide some way to miti-
gate the current crisis. 
On the House side, we have two of my 
friends in the Texas delegation—Con-
gressmen HENRY
CUELLAR, from La-
redo, and TONY
GONZALES, who rep-
resents one of the largest border dis-
tricts in the country. So we truly have 
a bipartisan, bicameral piece of legisla-
tion. 
Our knowledge of this crisis doesn’t 
just come from the news or political 
talking points but, as I suggested, from 
real conversations with the real people 
who are dealing with this and have 
dealt with previous surges. We have 
heard from State and local leaders, law 
enforcement, NGOs, as I said, and a 
range of property owners whose prop-
erty is being overrun by the coyotes 
and those who are involved in this ille-
gal immigration process. So their input 
has been the driving force behind the 
bill, which includes, I believe, common-
sense measures to address this crisis. 
It is not, admittedly, a comprehen-
sive immigration bill, but we need to 
put the fire out first and then build on 
our success, once we have passed that 
legislation, to do the other things that 
I think we can probably agree on, on a 
consensus basis, such as we discussed 
with the majority leader and others 
last evening. 
The Bipartisan Border Solutions Act 
is not about scoring political points. It 
is about solving a problem, and that 
problem is getting bigger every day. 
The most immediate problem is our in-
ability to properly process the sheer 
number of people crossing our border. 
Our Border Patrol and Health and 
Human Services, and the Office of Ref-
ugee Resettlement are simply over-
whelmed. In March, we saw the highest 
number of border crossings on record: 
172,000 individuals. That was a dra-
matic increase from the eye-popping 
numbers in February, which totaled 
100,000. 
As I said, we have seen these surges 
before but never a surge like this mag-
nitude. Now, the busiest months for 
people to cross the border typically are 
April, May, and June but not February 
and not March. So we know that this is 
only going to get worse based on our 
historical experience. 
If our facilities and people are al-
ready overwhelmed, imagine how the 
strain will intensify if we do nothing. 
We already know that, in processing 
these migrants, important steps are 
being skipped in an effort to expedite 
the process. 
Normally, if someone comes across 
the border seeking asylum, for exam-
ple, they will be processed and released 
with a notice to appear for a future 
court hearing. That document includes 
important information like when and 
where their first court date is set. In 
many cases, right now, it just isn’t 
happening. 
Many migrants are being released in 
the interior of the United States with 
incomplete paperwork, and they are 
not given any notice to appear for a fu-
ture immigration court date. And, you 
know, if they don’t show up in court, a

default order of deportation will be en-
tered even if they have a meritorious 
claim for asylum. So it has real con-
sequences. 
But what else can our government of-
ficials and our local communities do? 
Unfortunately, they do not want us to 
continue releasing people to the inte-
rior without a court date or informa-
tion on what is needed in order to as-
sert your claim. And as I said, without 
appearing in court, a migrant with a 
valid asylum claim won’t be able to re-
ceive the relief that U.S. law provides 
for them. 
At one point, the situation was so 
bad, the Biden administration consid-
ered flying migrants to less busy loca-
tions on the northern border to be 
processed. So there is really no ques-
tion we need to improve our capacity 
and our process to handle these mi-
grants 
more 
thoroughly 
and 
effi-
ciently. 
Our bipartisan bill here in the Senate 
and in the House will establish four re-
gional processing centers in high-traf-
fic areas along the border to streamline 
the intake of migrants. One reason 
that is so important, just beyond ca-
pacity issues, is that the smugglers 
who smuggle people into the United 
States 
for 
a 
price—part 
of 
transnational criminal organizations— 
they make a lot of money doing this, 
and they are smart. They know if they 
flood the zone with unaccompanied 
children, that the Border Patrol will go 
offline in order to take care of those 
children, which we want those children 
taken care of. But what the smugglers 
know 
and 
what 
the 
transnational 
criminal organizations know is once 
those Border Patrol come off the front-
line, they are going to exploit that 
loophole by running drugs into the 
United States or more migrants. 
Last year alone—or the last 12 
months alone, 88,000 Americans have 
died from drug overdoses. And 92 per-
cent of the heroin that comes into the 
United States comes from Mexico, to-
gether with a lot of methamphetamine, 
fentanyl, cocaine, and you name it. So 
we are dealing with incredibly shrewd 
and crafty people who understand the 
border perhaps better than most of us 
do. 
One of the worst parts of the current 
crisis is the tens of thousands of unac-
companied children who are making 
the dangerous trip from Central Amer-
ica or Mexico without their parents. 
Many of us have seen the heart-
breaking video of a young boy, aban-
doned by smugglers in the Rio Grande 
Valley, and he was asking for direc-
tions because he was lost. Smugglers 
left him behind. I don’t know why. 
Maybe he was injured or ill or slowing 
them down, but these smugglers don’t 
care about this young boy or any other 
human being. All they care about is 
the money. 
And we have also read the story 
about a young girl who drowned trying 
to cross the river. And who can forget 
the young girls, ages 3 and 5, who lit-
erally were dropped over the border 
wall by human smugglers? 
The truth is, migrant children endure 
unimaginable abuse and trauma in the 
hands of these criminal organizations. 
We need to try better, and we need to 
do better to provide protections to 
these children and ensure that they 
will not continue to be traumatized or 
abused once they cross our borders. 
For example, our bill also provides 
that children cannot be released into 
the custody of a relative or sponsor 
who could potentially inflict even more 
harm upon them. No sex offender, no 
child abuser, and no other dangerous 
criminal should be given the responsi-
bility to care for one of these children. 
We also need to remove some of the 
pull factors that encourage migrants to 
make this dangerous journey to our 
border in the first place. Many smug-
glers, known colloquially as coyotes, 
know our immigration laws better 
than most Americans, and they know 
how to exploit them, as I said. 
There is no doubt our backlogged 
legal system is one of the pull factors 
for these migrants. One of the biggest 
selling points for the smugglers is the 
immigration court backlog, which is 
currently 1.3 million cases. On average, 
it takes 21⁄2 years to get from the bor-
der to an immigration judge. 
A person or family can come here il-
legally and present weak or virtually 
nonexistent asylum claims with an al-
most certain guarantee that they will 
be able to stay in the United States for 
years while their claims are being ad-
judicated. That needs to change. Our 
legislation takes a number of steps to 
reduce the wait times and eliminate 
the backlog as a draw for even more il-
legal immigration and ensure that 
meritorious claims are recognized in a 
timely manner. 
The first part of this is, we need to 
hire more people. We need more immi-
gration judges. We need more asylum 
officials. We need litigation teams and 
other staff who play a role in these 
legal proceedings. The only way to 
eliminate this backlog is to work 
through it, and this bill allows us to 
hire hundreds of people to do just that. 
Our legislation includes another im-
portant change to remove this backlog 
as a pull factor. During surge events 
like we are experiencing now, the cases 
of those arriving will be prioritized. In 
other words, we will put them at the 
front of line, not the back of the line 
where we will never get to them. For 
those with legitimate asylum claims, 
that should be good news. About 10 or 
12 percent of the people who show up 
on our front doormat have legitimate 
asylum claims that are upheld by im-
migration judges, and we should pro-
vide them a timely hearing in front of 
a judge so they can receive the benefit 
of U.S. law. 
But this will also serve as a deterrent 
for those who know their asylum 
claims are weak. Why pay smugglers 
thousands of dollars to reach the 
United States if your case will quickly 
be heard and dismissed for lack of 
merit resulting in your return? That is 
one of the pull factors that we can es-
tablish and we can improve to deter 
people from wasting their hard-earned 
money with nonexistent or weak asy-
lum claims. 
And, finally, the bill will ensure that 
migrants are treated fairly and hu-
manely so we can be confident that our 
asylum system is working as we in-
tended. This legislation includes a 
large number of other commonsense 
measures to alleviate staffing short-
ages, improve coordination between 
Federal, State, and local officials, ex-
pand language translation and legal 
orientation services for migrants, and 
the list goes on. 
Former Border Patrol Chief Carla 
Provost once described this surge in 
migration as like holding a bucket 
under the faucet. It doesn’t matter how 
many buckets you have if you can’t 
turn off the water. In the short term, 
we do need a bigger bucket. That in-
cludes facilities to process these mi-
grants and personnel to adjudicate 
their asylum claims. But it won’t mat-
ter how big that bucket is if we don’t 
stop the flow or at least reduce it. 
We need to eliminate the pull factors 
that encourage migrants who do not 
qualify under our law for asylum from 
even attempting the dangerous journey 
to our border in the first place. That is 
exactly why the Bipartisan Border So-
lutions Act is the answer or an answer 
to the crisis at hand. 
This bill will deter illegal immigra-
tion without interfering with legiti-
mate claims. It will ensure that mi-
grants’ 
claims 
are 
processed 
effi-
ciently, without skipping important 
steps, and it will provide critical pro-
tections for children who come here 
alone. 
The fact that we have a bill that is 
bipartisan and bicameral is a testa-
ment to the commonsense reforms in-
cluded in this legislation, and I have 
been proud to work with Senator 
SINEMA, Congressman CUELLAR, and 
Congressman GONZALES
on this bill, 
and we would invite our colleagues to 
look at the bill and join us in cospon-
soring it on a bipartisan basis. 
Now, one thing I can guarantee is 
this is not the end-all, be-all. This is 
not some silver bullet that is going to 
solve all of our problems, but what I 
think it will do is help restore public 
confidence that we are serious about 
enforcing our laws, while remaining 
generous in providing legal claims the 
benefit of a hearing and validation. 
We are, in fact, the most generous 
Nation in the world when it comes to 
legal 
immigration—naturalizing, 
roughly, a million people a year. But 
the truth is, my State and all our 
States, those of us on this bill cur-
rently, have borne the brunt of this cri-
sis because of the failures of the Fed-
eral Government to deal with them. 
So we have developed a list of bipar-
tisan cosponsors, and I hope the chair-
man of the Judiciary Committee and

the minority leader will commit to

And the last thing I will say is, we

idea, but so far we haven’t seen any-
body step up and say: I have got an an-
swer or at least a partial answer or re-
sponse that has bipartisan and bi-

171—EX-
PRESSING THE SENSE OF THE 
SENATE 
THAT 
THE

NATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE 
SHOULD CORRECT THE OLYMPIC 
RECORDS FOR JIM THORPE FOR 
HIS 
UNPRECEDENTED 
ACCOM-
PLISHMENTS DURING THE 1912 
OLYMPIC GAMES 
Mr. INHOFE (for himself and Mr. 
LANKFORD) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation: 
S. RES. 171 
Whereas Wa-Tho-Huk or ‘‘Bright Path’’, 
known as James Francis Thorpe or ‘‘Jim 
Thorpe’’ of the Thunder Clan of the Sac and 
Fox Nation, was born May 22, 1887 on the 
Reservation of the Sac and Fox Nation in 
Prague, Oklahoma, and died March 28, 1953 in 
Lomita, California; 
Whereas Jim Thorpe attended the Carlisle 
Indian School in Pennsylvania and estab-
lished his amateur football record playing 
halfback, defender, punter, and place-kicker 
while a student and was subsequently chosen 
as Walter Camp’s First Team All-American 
Half-Back in 1911 and 1912; 
Whereas prior to the 1912 Olympic Games, 
Jim Thorpe placed second in the pentathlon 
at the Amateur Athletic Union National 
Championship Trials in Boston, Massachu-
setts; 
Whereas 
Jim 
Thorpe 
represented 
the 
United States as an enrolled member of the 
Sac and Fox Nation, the largest of 3 feder-
ally 
recognized 
Tribes 
of 
Sauk 
and 
Meskwaki (Fox), in the 1912 Olympic Games 
in Stockholm, Sweden; 
Whereas at the 1912 Olympic Games, he 
won a Gold Medal in the pentathlon, became 
the first athlete from the United States to 
win a gold medal in the decathlon, in which 
he set a world record, and became the only 
athlete in Olympic history to win both the 
pentathlon and the decathlon during the 
same year; 
Whereas at the time Jim Thorpe won 2 
Gold Medals in the 1912 Olympic Games, and 
not until 1924 under the Indian Citizenship 
Act, Native Americans were not recognized 
as citizens of the United States; 
Whereas Native Americans were not grant-
ed the right to vote in every State until 1957; 
Whereas Jim Thorpe was a founding father 
of professional football, playing with the 
Canton Bulldogs, which was the team recog-
nized as world champion in 1916, 1917, and 
1919, the Cleveland Indians, the Oorang Indi-
ans, the Rock Island Independent, the New 
York Giants, and the Chicago Cardinals; 
Whereas, in 1920, Jim Thorpe was named 
the first president of the American Profes-
sional Football Association, now known as 
the National Football League; 
Whereas Jim Thorpe was voted America’s 
Greatest All- Around Male Athlete and cho-
sen as the greatest football player of the 
half-century in 1950 by an Associated Press 
poll of sportswriters; 
Whereas Jim Thorpe was named the Great-
est American Football Player in history in a 
1977 national poll conducted by Sport Maga-
zine; 
Whereas because of his outstanding ath-
letic achievements, Jim Thorpe was the first 
Native American inducted into the National 
Track and Field Hall of Fame, the Profes-
sional Football Hall of Fame, the Helms Pro-
fessional Football Hall of Fame, the Na-
tional Native American Hall of Fame, the 
Pennsylvania Hall of Fame, and the Okla-
homa Hall of Fame; 
Whereas the Amateur Athletic Union of 
1973 restored the amateur status of Jim 
Thorpe for the years 1909 through 1912; 
Whereas the International Olympic Com-
mittee returned duplicates of gold medals 
won by Jim Thorpe to his family in 1982, but 
did not list him as the sole gold medal win-
ner for his achievements during the 1912 
Olympic Games; and 
Whereas the failure of the International 
Olympic Committee to update the records 
regarding Jim Thorpe disregards the unprec-
edented achievements of one of the best ath-
letes in the history of the United States, the 
only athlete in Olympic history to win both 
the pentathlon and the decathlon during the 
same year, the first Native American athlete 
to win Olympic gold medals for the United 
States, and the contributions of the Sac and 
Fox Nation in the history of the United 
States: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate 
that the International Olympic Committee, 
through the president of the Committee, 
should officially recognize the unprecedented 
athletic achievements of Jim Thorpe as the 
sole gold medalist in the 1912 pentathlon and 
decathlon events and correct these inaccura-
cies in the official Olympic books.

ING RACISM A PUBLIC HEALTH 
CRISIS

REN, Ms. SMITH, Ms. STABENOW, Mr. 
WYDEN, Mr. CARPER, and Mrs. MURRAY) 
submitted the following resolution; 
which was referred to the Committee 
on Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions: 
S. RES. 172 
Whereas, since its founding, the United 
States has had a longstanding history and 
legacy of racism, mistreatment, and dis-
crimination 
against 
African 
Americans, 
Latinos, Native Americans, and other people 
of color; 
Whereas the United States ratified over 350 
treaties with sovereign indigenous commu-
nities, has broken the promises made in such 
treaties, and has historically failed to carry 
out its trust responsibilities to Native Amer-
icans, including American Indians, Alaska 
Natives, and Native Hawaiians, as made evi-
dent by the chronic and pervasive under-
funding of the Indian Health Service and 
Tribal, Urban Indian, and Native Hawaiian 
health care, the vast health and socio-
economic disparities faced by Native Amer-
ican people, and the inaccessibility of many 
Federal public health and social programs in 
Native American communities; 
Whereas people of Mexican and Puerto 
Rican 
descent, 
who 
became 
Americans 
through conquest, were subject to, but never 
full members of the polity of the United 
States and experienced widespread discrimi-
nation in employment, housing, education, 
and health care; 
Whereas the immoral paradox of slavery 
and freedom is an indelible wrong traced 
throughout the history of the United States, 
as African Americans lived under the oppres-
sive institution of slavery from 1619 through 
1865, endured the practices and laws of seg-
regation during the Jim Crow Era, and con-
tinue to face the ramifications of systemic 
racism through unjust and discriminatory 
structures and policies; 
Whereas, before the enactment of the 
Medicare program, the United States health 
care system was highly segregated, and, as 
late as the mid-1960s, hospitals, clinics, and 
doctors’ offices throughout Northern and 
Southern States complied with Jim Crow 
laws and were completely segregated by 
race—leaving Black communities with little 
to no access to health care services; 
Whereas, between 1956 and 1967, the Na-
tional Association for the Advancement of 
Colored People (NAACP) Legal Defense and 
Education Fund litigated a series of court 
cases to eliminate discrimination in hos-
pitals and professional associations; 
Whereas the landmark case Simkins v. 
Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital, 323 F.2d 
959 (1963), challenged the Federal Govern-
ment’s use of public funds to expand, sup-
port, and sustain segregated hospital care, 
and provided justification for title VI of the 
1964 Civil Rights Act and the Medicare hos-
pital 
certification 
program—establishing 
Medicare hospital racial integration guide-
lines that applied to every hospital that par-
ticipated in the Federal program; 
Whereas, in 1967, President Lyndon B. 
Johnson established the National Advisory 
Commission on Civil Disorders, which con-
cluded that White racism is responsible for 
the pervasive discrimination and segregation 
in employment, education, and housing, re-
sulting in deepened racial division and con-
tinued exclusion of Black communities from 
the benefits of economic progress; 
Whereas language minorities, including 
Latinos, Asian Americans, and Pacific Is-
landers, were not assured non-discriminatory 
access to federally funded services, including 
health services, until the signing of Execu-
tive Order 13166 (42 U.S.C. 2000d-1 note; relat-
ing to improving access to services for per-
sons with limited English proficiency) in 
2000; 
Whereas the Patient Protection and Af-
fordable Care Act (Public Law 111–148; 124 
Stat. 119)— 
(1) included provisions to expand the Med-
icaid program and—for the first time in the 
United States—established a Federal prohi-
bition against discrimination on the basis of 
race, color, national origin, sex, age, or dis-
ability in certain health programs, building 
on other Federal civil rights laws; and 
(2) required reporting to Congress on 
health disparities based on race, color, na-
tional origin, sex, age, or disability; 
Whereas several Federal programs have 
been established to address some, but not all, 
of the health outcomes that are dispropor-
tionately experienced by communities of 
color, including sickle cell disease, tuber-
culosis, infant mortality, and HIV/AIDS; 
Whereas the National Center for Chronic 
Disease Prevention and Health Promotion 
works to raise awareness of health dispari-
ties faced by minority populations in the

United States, including Native Americans, 
Asian Americans, Black Americans, and 
Latino Americans, aiming to reduce risk fac-
tors for groups affected by such health dis-
parities; 
Whereas the United States health care sys-
tem and other economic and social struc-
tures remain fraught with racism and racial, 
ethnic, sex (including sexual orientation and 
gender identity), and class biases that lead 
to health inequity and health disparities; 
Whereas life expectancy rates for Black 
and Native American people in the United 
States are significantly lower than those of 
White people in the United States; 
Whereas disparities in health outcomes are 
exacerbated for LGBTQIA+ people of color; 
Whereas disparities in health outcomes are 
worsened for people of color with disabilities 
due to bias and inequitable access to health 
care; 
Whereas several States with higher per-
centages of Black, Latino, and Native Amer-
ican populations have not expanded their 
Medicaid programs—continuing to disenfran-
chise minority communities from access to 
health care to this day; 
Whereas 16 States have failed to take ad-
vantage of the Federal option to expand ac-
cess to Medicaid and the Children’s Health 
Insurance Program to lawfully residing im-
migrant children within the first 5 years of 
lawful status, and 26 States have failed to do 
so for similarly situated pregnant women; 
Whereas, between 2016 and 2018, the child 
uninsured rate increased from 4.7 percent to 
5.5 percent and the Latino child uninsured 
rate increased from 7.7 percent to 8.1 per-
cent, and children of color are far more like-
ly to be uninsured than White children; 
Whereas a climate of fear and confusion for 
immigrant families due to the public charge 
rule discourages such families from enrolling 
eligible children in Medicaid and the Chil-
dren’s Health Insurance Program; 
Whereas Pacific Islanders from the Freely 
Associated States experience unique health 
disparities resulting from United States nu-
clear weapons tests on their home islands, 
but such people have been categorically de-
nied access to Medicaid and other Federal 
health benefits; 
Whereas the United States has historically 
facilitated outsider status toward Asian 
Americans and Pacific Islanders, such as the 
authorization of the internment of Japanese 
Americans during World War II, which re-
sulted in profound economic, social, and psy-
chological burdens for the people impacted; 
Whereas the history and persistence of rac-
ist and non-scientific medical beliefs are as-
sociated with ongoing racial disparities in 
treatment and health outcomes; 
Whereas implicit racial and ethnic biases 
within the health care system have an im-
pact on the quality of care experienced by 
communities of color, such as the under-
treatment of pain in Black patients; 
Whereas the historical context of unethical 
practices and abuses experienced by Black 
patients and research participants, such as 
the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, serve as sym-
bols of the Black community’s mistrust of 
the medical system; 
Whereas women of color continue to face 
attacks, documented throughout history, on 
their prenatal, maternal, and reproductive 
health and rights; 
Whereas 
enslaved 
Black 
women 
were 
forced to endure egregiously unethical and 
cruel treatment, as subjects of insidious 
medical experiments, to advance modern 
gynecology; 
Whereas, through the late 1960s and early 
1980s, physicians routinely sterilized people 
of color, performing excessive and medically 
unnecessary procedures on patients of color 
without their informed consent; 
Whereas 
Black 
and 
Native 
American 
women are 2 to 4 times more likely than 
White women to suffer severe maternal mor-
bidity or die of pregnancy-related complica-
tions, and implicit racial biases and lower 
quality care are contributing factors to the 
health care disparities that lead to these 
outcomes; 
Whereas Black and Native American in-
fants are twice as likely to die as White in-
fants, and the Black infant mortality rate in 
the United States is higher than in 97 coun-
tries worldwide; 
Whereas researchers have developed the 
analytical framework of ‘‘weathering’’ to de-
scribe how the constant stress of racism 
leads to poor health outcomes for Black 
Americans; 
Whereas the daily experience of racism is 
associated with stress, depression, and anx-
iety, and may cause physiological reactivity 
or contribute to chronic health conditions; 
Whereas racism is linked to mental health 
challenges for children and adolescents; 
Whereas children of color are overrepre-
sented in the United States child welfare 
system, and up to 80 percent of children in 
foster care enter State custody with signifi-
cant mental health challenges; 
Whereas disparities in educational access 
and attainment, along with racism experi-
enced in the educational setting, affect the 
trajectory of academic achievement for chil-
dren and adolescents, and ultimately impact 
health and racial inequities in school dis-
cipline, which has long-term consequences 
for children; 
Whereas racism and segregation in the 
United States contribute to poor health out-
comes by segregating Black, Latino, and Na-
tive American communities from oppor-
tunity; 
Whereas, for decades, discriminatory hous-
ing practices, such as redlining, systemically 
excluded people of color from housing, rob-
bing them of capital in the form of low-cost, 
stable mortgages and opportunities to build 
wealth, and the Federal government used its 
financial power to segregate renters in newly 
built public housing; 
Whereas environmental injustices, such as 
proximity and exposure to toxic waste or 
hazardous air pollutants, continue to harm 
the health of communities of color, low-in-
come communities, and Indigenous commu-
nities around the United States; 
Whereas social inequities such as differing 
access to quality health care, healthy food 
and safe drinking water, safe neighborhoods, 
education, job security, and reliable trans-
portation affect health risks and outcomes; 
Whereas, during the COVID–19 pandemic, 
the effects of racism and discrimination are 
seen in COVID–19 infection, hospitalization, 
and mortality rates—disproportionately high 
among Black, Latino, and Native American 
populations compared to the overall popu-
lation—exacerbating health disparities and 
highlighting barriers to care for Black, 
Latino, and Native American patients across 
the United States; 
Whereas discrimination and harassment 
relating to the COVID–19 pandemic is on the 
rise, particularly discrimination and harass-
ment directed towards the Asian American 
and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community; 
Whereas, because of racial and ethnic dis-
parities, people of color are more likely to 
have pre-existing, preventable, and chronic 
conditions, which lead to higher COVID–19 
morbidity and mortality rates; 
Whereas people of color are overrepre-
sented in the number of people in the United 
States living under poor air quality condi-
tions, which can increase the likelihood of 
COVID–19 morbidity and mortality; 
Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic has wors-
ened barriers for Black, Latino, and Native 
American households that suffer from dis-
proportionately higher rates of food insecu-
rity; 
Whereas Black and Latino workers make 
up a disproportionate number of frontline 
workers, are less likely to receive paid sick 
leave or have the ability to work from home, 
and have been excluded from many forms of 
relief readily available to other groups; 
Whereas people of color are disproportion-
ately impacted by the criminal justice and 
immigration enforcement systems and face a 
higher risk of contracting COVID–19 within 
prison populations and detention centers due 
to the over-incarceration of people of color; 
Whereas, during the COVID–19 pandemic, 
an increased use of anti-Asian rhetoric has 
resulted in Asian Americans being harassed, 
assaulted, and scapegoated for the pandemic; 
Whereas communities of color continue to 
bear the burdens of inequitable social, eco-
nomic, and criminal justice policies, prac-
tices, and investments that cause deep dis-
parities, hurt, harm, danger, and mistrust; 
Whereas over 40 percent of Latinos report 
being discriminated against or harassed be-
cause they are Hispanic; 
Whereas approximately 24 percent of the 
Latino population in the United States iden-
tifies as ‘‘Afro-Latino’’ and is thus poten-
tially subject to both race and national ori-
gin discrimination; 
Whereas, because of racism, Black people 
in the United States share a unique set of 
challenges and experiences that require 
heightened levels of awareness and risk 
while performing everyday tasks—such as 
jogging in neighborhoods, driving while 
Black, or playing in a park—that are not ex-
perienced by other populations; 
Whereas Black people in the United States 
are 3 times more likely to be killed by police 
than White people in the United States, and 
police violence is the 6th leading cause of 
death for young Black men; 
Whereas the police brutality and violence 
experienced by Black people in the United 
States adversely impacts mental health 
among Black communities; 
Whereas Black communities led the United 
States in mourning the killings of Ahmaud 
Arbery, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, Eli-
jah McClain, and countless other Black 
Americans—calling for justice and long-term 
changes to dismantle systems of oppression; 
Whereas, throughout the history of the 
United States, people of color have been at 
the forefront of civil rights movements for 
essential freedoms, human rights, and equal 
protection for marginalized groups and con-
tinue to fight for racial and economic justice 
today; 
Whereas a public health issue is defined as 
meeting the following 4 criteria: 
(1) The condition affects many people, is 
seen as a threat to the public, and is con-
tinuing to increase. 
(2) The condition is distributed unfairly. 
(3) Preventive measures could reduce the 
effects of the condition. 
(4) Those preventive measures are not yet 
in place; 
Whereas racism meets the criteria of a 
public health crisis, and public health ex-
perts agree; 
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention— 
(1) declared racism a serious threat to pub-
lic health; and 
(2) acknowledged the need for additional 
research and investments to address this se-
rious issue; 
Whereas a Federal public health crisis dec-
laration defines racism as a pervasive health 
issue and alerts the people of the United 
States to the need to enact immediate and

Resolved, That the Senate—

RE-
GIME 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida (for himself, 
Mr. CRUZ, and Mr. RUBIO) submitted 
the following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Foreign 
Relations: 
S. RES. 173 
Whereas Jose´
Daniel Ferrer Garcı´a is a 
Cuban democracy and human rights activist 
who has worked tirelessly to ensure funda-
mental freedoms for the Cuban people; 
Whereas Jose´
Daniel Ferrer Garcı´a was 
born in Cuba on July 29, 1970, in Santiago de 
Cuba and has spent most of his adult life 
fighting for Cubans to have a voice in the 
matters of their own country and against 
Cuba’s brutal authoritarian Communist dic-
tatorship; 
Whereas Cuba’s authoritarian Communist 
regime retaliated against Jose´ Daniel Ferrer 
Garcı´a over decades by repeatedly impris-
oning, beating, and torturing him and con-
stantly threatening and harassing his family 
and members of the pro-democracy and 
human rights group that he founded, the Pa-
triotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU); 
Whereas, in March 2021, Cuba’s brutal au-
thoritarian Communist regime committed 
the latest human rights violation against 
Jose´ Daniel Ferrer Garcı´a and members of 
UNPACU, as Cuban security forces harassed 
them, kept them from meeting, and blocked 
their attempts to distribute aid, food, and 
medical care to fellow desperate residents of 
Santiago de Cuba; 
Whereas, on March 20, 2021, Jose´
Daniel 
Ferrer Garcı´a and other courageous members 
of UNPACU began a hunger strike to protest 
the constant harassment, human rights vio-
lations, and the police siege of the head-
quarters of UNPACU in Santiago de Cuba; 
Whereas the hunger strike underscored the 
importance of defending the right of the 
members of UNPACU to deliver food and 
medication to a group of approximately 250 
residents of Santiago de Cuba as the need for 
aid, food, medicine, and basic necessities has 
risen during the global pandemic; and 
Whereas, on April 10, 2021, Jose´
Daniel 
Ferrer Garcı´a and several activists from 
UNPACU ended the hunger strike after 21 
days after Cuban security forces lifted the 
police siege on the headquarters of UNPACU 
in Santiago de Cuba: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) commends the actions of Jose´ Daniel 
Ferrer Garcı´a and his unyielding resolve to 
advance democracy and defend freedoms and 
human rights for the Cuban people; 
(2) honors the vital contribution and hu-
manitarian efforts of the Patriotic Union of 
Cuba (UNPACU) and all of its members for 
their tireless work to defend fundamental 
freedoms and human rights in Cuba; 
(3) condemns the repression of Jose´ Daniel 
Ferrer Garcı´a and other brave Cuban activ-
ists; 
(4) condemns Cuba’s brutal authoritarian 
Communist dictatorship and demands an end 
to the suffering of the Cuban people and the 
impunity of the regime’s human rights abus-
ers, including Miguel Dı´az-Canel and Rau´ l 
Castro; 
(5) calls for the international community 
to stand with the Cuban people and against 
Cuba’s authoritarian Communist regime for 
infringing on the freedom of thought, expres-
sion, assembly, association, and prosperity 
of the Cuban people; and 
(6) commends the courage of the pro-de-
mocracy movement and activists in Cuba for 
risking everything to bring freedom to the 
Cuban people.

SENATE RESOLUTION 174—DESIG-
NATING APRIL 2021 AS ‘‘PARKIN-
SON’S AWARENESS MONTH’’ 
Ms. STABENOW (for herself and Mr. 
THUNE) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 174 
Whereas Parkinson’s disease is a chronic, 
progressive neurological disease and the sec-
ond most common neurodegenerative disease 
in the United States; 
Whereas, although there is inadequate data 
on the incidence and prevalence of Parkin-
son’s disease, the disease is estimated to af-
fect between 500,000 and 1,000,000 individuals 
in the United States, with that number ex-
pected to more than double by 2040; 
Whereas, according to the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention, Parkinson’s 
disease is the 15th leading cause of death in 
the United States; 
Whereas millions of individuals in the 
United States are greatly impacted by Par-
kinson’s disease, including the caregivers, 
family members, and friends of individuals 
living with Parkinson’s disease; 
Whereas research suggests that the cause 
of Parkinson’s disease is a combination of 
genetic and environmental factors, but the 
exact cause of the disease in most individ-
uals is still unknown; 
Whereas, as of March 2021, there is no ob-
jective test or biomarker with which to diag-
nose Parkinson’s disease; 
Whereas there is no known cure or drug to 
slow or halt the progression of Parkinson’s 
disease, and available treatments are limited 
in their ability to address the medical needs 
of patients and remain effective over time; 
Whereas the symptoms of Parkinson’s dis-
ease vary from person to person and may in-
clude— 
(1) tremors; 
(2) slowness of movement and rigidity; 
(3) problems with gait and balance; 
(4) disturbances in speech and swallowing; 
(5) cognitive impairment and dementia; 
(6) mood disorders; and 
(7) a variety of other nonmotor symptoms; 
Whereas 
volunteers, 
researchers, 
care-
givers, and medical professionals are work-
ing to improve the quality of life of— 
(1) individuals living with Parkinson’s dis-
ease; and 
(2) the families of those individuals; and 
Whereas increased research, education, and 
community support services are needed— 
(1) to find more effective treatments; and 
(2) to provide access to quality care to in-
dividuals living with Parkinson’s disease: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates April 2021 as ‘‘Parkinson’s 
Awareness Month’’; 
(2) supports the goals and ideals of Parkin-
son’s Awareness Month; 
(3) continues to support research to find 
better treatments and a cure for Parkinson’s 
disease; 
(4) recognizes the individuals living with 
Parkinson’s disease who participate in vital 
clinical trials to advance the knowledge of 
the disease; and 
(5) commends the dedication of the organi-
zations, volunteers, researchers, and millions 
of individuals across the United States who 
are working to improve the quality of life 
of— 
(A) individuals living with Parkinson’s dis-
ease; and 
(B) the families of those individuals.

port public health measures to decrease com-
munity spread of COVID–19; 
(8) investments in the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, which support infec-
tious disease outbreak preparedness and crit-
ical public health infrastructure for State 
and local health departments and public 
health laboratories; 
(9) a comprehensive effort to ensure a suc-
cessful COVID–19 vaccination campaign that 
boosts access to vaccines for vulnerable pop-
ulations and trust in vaccine safety and ef-
fectiveness; and 
(10) efforts to address racism as a public 
health crisis and reduce racial and ethnic 
health 
disparities 
related 
to 
COVID–19 
deaths, vaccine access and testing, and im-
portant health outcomes outside of the pan-
demic such as maternal mortality; 
Whereas, in 2020, the life expectancy for 
the population of the United States dropped 
a full year, which is the largest drop in life 
expectancy since 1943; 
Whereas many of the leading causes of 
death for individuals in the United States re-
sult from chronic conditions, which are 
among the most common, costly, and pre-
ventable of all health challenges; 
Whereas there are significant differences 
in the health status of individuals living in 
the most healthy States and those living in 
the least healthy States, including dif-
ferences in obesity rates, the prevalence of 
chronic disease, and the prevalence of infec-
tious disease; 
Whereas racial and ethnic minority popu-
lations in the United States continue to ex-
perience disparities in the burden of illness 
and death, as compared with the entire popu-
lation of the United States; 
Whereas violence is a leading cause of pre-
mature death and it is estimated that more 
than 7 individuals per hour die a violent 
death in the United States; 
Whereas deaths from homicides cost the 
economy of the United States billions of dol-
lars and the violence of homicides can cause 
social and emotional distress, community 
trauma, injury, disability, depression, anx-
iety, and post-traumatic stress disorder; 
Whereas emergency department visits for 
suicidal thoughts or self-harm increased 25.5 
percent between January 2017 and December 
2018, with substantial increases occurring in 
younger age groups; 
Whereas an estimated 1 in 7 children in the 
United States experiences child abuse and 
neglect, which imposes an annual lifetime 
economic 
burden 
of 
approximately 
$428,000,000,000 on the population of the 
United States; 
Whereas, despite significant progress in re-
ducing the infant mortality rate in the 
United States to a historic low of 5.8 infant 
deaths per 1,000 live births, in 2017 the infant 
mortality rate in the United States greatly 
varies among States; 
Whereas women die from pregnancy-re-
lated complications in the United States at a 
higher rate than in many other developed 
countries and an estimated 60 percent of ma-
ternal deaths in the United States are pre-
ventable; 
Whereas Black mothers experience a ma-
ternal mortality rate 3 to 4 times higher 
than White mothers; 
Whereas 81,000 drug overdose deaths oc-
curred in the United States during the 12- 
month period ending May 2020, the highest 
level ever recorded during a 12-month period; 
Whereas cigarette smoking is the leading 
cause of preventable disease and death in the 
United States, accounting for more than 
480,000 deaths every year, including more 
than 41,000 deaths resulting from secondhand 
smoke; 
Whereas the percentage of adults in the 
United States who smoke cigarettes has de-
creased from 20.9 percent of the population 
in 2005 to 13.7 percent of the population in 
2018; 
Whereas, in 2020, according to data from 
the National Youth Tobacco Survey 19.6 per-
cent of high school students (3,020,000 stu-
dents) and 4.7 percent of middle school stu-
dents (550,000 students) reported current e- 
cigarette use; 
Whereas data from the National Youth To-
bacco Survey showed that in 2020 almost 40 
percent of high school e-cigarette users were 
using an e-cigarette on 20 or more days out 
of the month and almost a quarter of high 
school e-cigarette users were using e-ciga-
rettes every day, indicating a strong depend-
ence on nicotine among youth; 
Whereas in the past 2 decades heat-related 
mortality for older persons has almost dou-
bled, reaching a record high 19,000 deaths in 
2018; 
Whereas from 2018 to 2019 the United 
States spent nearly $13 per person on climate 
change adaptation in the health sector, far 
less than what is needed to prevent the grow-
ing health impacts of climate change; 
Whereas, in 2016, fine particulate air pollu-
tion led to more than 64,000 premature 
deaths in the United States and Black and 
Hispanic individuals in the United States 
were disproportionately impacted; 
Whereas public health organizations use 
National Public Health Week to educate pub-
lic policymakers and public health profes-
sionals on issues that are important to im-
proving the health of the people of the 
United States; 
Whereas studies show that small strategic 
investments in disease prevention can result 
in significant savings in health care costs; 
Whereas vaccination is one of the most sig-
nificant public health achievements in his-
tory and has resulted in substantial de-
creases in— 
(1) the number of cases, hospitalizations, 
and deaths associated with vaccine-prevent-
able diseases; and 
(2) health care costs associated with vac-
cine-preventable diseases; 
Whereas each 10 percent increase in local 
public health spending contributes to a— 
(1) 6.9 percent decrease in infant deaths; 
(2) 3.2 percent decrease in deaths related to 
cardiovascular disease; 
(3) 1.4 percent decrease in deaths due to di-
abetes; and 
(4) 1.1 percent decrease in cancer-related 
deaths; 
Whereas public health professionals help 
communities prevent, prepare for, mitigate, 
and recover from the impact of a full range 
of health threats, including— 
(1) disease outbreaks, such as the COVID– 
19 pandemic; 
(2) natural disasters, such as wildfires, 
flooding, and severe storms; and 
(3) other disasters, including disasters 
caused by human activity and public health 
emergencies; 
Whereas public health professionals col-
laborate with partners outside of the health 
sector, including city planners, transpor-
tation officials, education officials, and pri-
vate sector businesses, recognizing that 
other sectors can influence health outcomes; 
Whereas in communities across the United 
States, individuals are changing the way 
they care for their health by avoiding to-
bacco use, eating healthier, increasing phys-
ical activity, and preventing unintentional 
injuries at home and in the workplace; and 
Whereas efforts to adequately support pub-
lic health and the prevention of disease and 
injury can continue to transform a health 
system focused on treating illness into a 
health system focused on preventing disease 
and injury and promoting wellness: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the goals and ideals of Na-
tional Public Health Week; 
(2) recognizes the efforts of public health 
professionals, 
the 
Federal 
Government, 
States, Tribes, municipalities, local commu-
nities, and individuals in preventing disease 
and injury; 
(3) recognizes the role of public health in— 
(A) preventing and responding to infectious 
disease outbreaks, such as the COVID–19 
pandemic; 
(B) mitigating short-term and long-term 
impacts of infectious disease outbreaks on 
the health and wellness of individuals in the 
United States; 
(C) addressing social and other deter-
minants of health, including health dispari-
ties experienced by minority populations; 
and 
(D) improving the overall health of individ-
uals and communities in the United States; 
(4) encourages increased efforts and re-
sources to— 
(A) improve the health of individuals in 
the United States; and 
(B) make the United States, in 1 genera-
tion, the healthiest Nation in the world by— 
(i) providing greater opportunities to im-
prove community health and prevent disease 
and injury; and 
(ii) strengthening the public health system 
and workforce in the United States; and

Whereas Georgia has made significant con-
tributions to the wars in Iraq and Afghani-
stan and remains the largest troop contrib-
utor among NATO partners to the NATO-led 
Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan; 
Whereas the United States supports the 
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Geor-
gia within its internationally recognized bor-
ders and condemns the continued occupation 
by the Russian Federation of the Georgian 
regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia; 
Whereas, in March 2020, the United States 
and several embassies of European countries 
in Georgia brokered an agreement among the 
major political parties in Georgia, which in-
cluded changes to the electoral system and 
called on all sides to address the appearance 
of political interference in the judicial sys-
tem; 
Whereas, on June 29, 2020, the Parliament 
of Georgia adopted constitutional amend-
ments, establishing a more proportional 
electoral system and promoting greater po-
litical pluralism in future parliaments; 
Whereas the United States Embassy in 
Tbilisi applauded Georgia’s electoral reforms 
and urged the Parliament of Georgia to pass 
additional legislation that fully incorporates 
all of the recommendations of the Office for 
Democratic Institutions and Human Rights 
of the Organization for Security and Co-oper-
ation in Europe (OSCE/ODIHR) and urged 
Georgian authorities to effectively imple-
ment such legislation; 
Whereas, on October 31, 2020, Georgia held 
its first parliamentary elections since adopt-
ing the electoral reforms in June 2020; 
Whereas the OSCE/ODIHR limited election 
observation team detailed a number of flaws 
and partially or completely unimplemented 
OSCE/ODIHR recommendations, but also 
concluded that the first round of the October 
2020 parliamentary elections in Georgia was 
‘‘competitive and, overall, fundamental free-
doms were respected’’; 
Whereas the United States Embassy in

of the first round of elections and stressed 
the importance of fully addressing the defi-
ciencies noted by the OSCE/ODIHR Limited 
Election Observation Mission Preliminary 
Report before the second round of elections 
in November 2020; 
Whereas the Georgian opposition refused 
to recognize the legitimacy of the October 
2020 elections, boycotted the second round of 
elections, called for public voter intimida-
tion of anyone voting in the second round of 
elections, and declined to take their seats in

Georgia to examine the political situation 
and to highlight the actions that the Gov-
ernment of Georgia and the opposition could 
take in order to resolve the impasse and 
move the country forward; 
Whereas, in that hearing, Deputy Assistant 
Secretary of State George Kent testified 
that the Russian Federation uses its illegal 
occupation of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, 
‘‘economic leverage, cyber attacks, and 
disinformation to try to force Georgia to 
abandon its Euro-Atlantic aspirations and to 
sow division and distrust’’; 
Whereas, at the same hearing, Deputy As-
sistant Secretary Kent testified, ‘‘Georgia

Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) calls on Georgian Dream, United Na-

dynamics; 
(3) calls on the Government of Georgia to 
institute 
systemic 
reforms, 
developed 
through an inclusive and transparent con-
sultation process with stakeholders, to en-
sure that the judicial system is impartial

and implementing the recommendations of 
the European Commission for Democracy 
through Law (commonly known as the ‘‘Ven-
ice Commission’’) and other experts; 
(4) calls on the Government of Georgia to 
institute inclusively and transparently de-
veloped systemic electoral reforms to ad-
dress the underlying causes of the political

menting the recommendations of the Office 
for Democratic Institutions and Human 
Rights of the Organization for Security and 
Co-operation in Europe (OSCE/ODIHR); 
(5) recognizes that the political situation 
in Georgia has been exacerbated by the ef-
forts of the Russian Federation to sow chaos 
throughout Georgia, including the illegally 
occupied territories of Abkhazia and South 
Ossetia; 
(6) expresses concern that impediments to 
strengthening Georgia’s democratic institu-
tions and processes will slow its progress to-
ward achieving its aspiration of Euro-Atlan-
tic integration and strengthening its econ-
omy and could result in conditions placed on 
United States assistance to Georgia; and 
(7) emphasizes that the United States sup-
ports a more robust democracy in Georgia, 
with 
governing 
institutions 
that 
dem-
onstrate integrity, checks and balances, 
transparency, the capacity to counter Rus-
sian and other malign influence, and the 
ability to achieve the Euro-Atlantic aspira-
tions of the people of Georgia.

lease of the Board of Governors of the Fed-
eral Reserve System for the fourth quarter 
of 2020 entitled ‘‘Household Debt and Cred-
it’’— 
(1) outstanding household debt in the 
United States has been increasing steadily 
since 2013 and was $414,000,000,000 higher than 
at the end of 2019; and 
(2) outstanding student loan balances have 
more than doubled in the last decade to ap-
proximately $1,560,000,000,000; 
Whereas, according to the 2020 report enti-
tled ‘‘Survey of the States: Economic and 
Personal Finance Education in Our Nation’s 
Schools’’, by the Council for Economic Edu-
cation— 
(1) only 25 States require students to take 
an economics course as a high school gradua-
tion requirement; and 
(2) only 21 States require students to take 
a personal finance course as a high school 
graduation requirement, either independ-
ently or as part of an economics course; 
Whereas, according to the Gallup-HOPE 
Index, in 2016 only 57 percent of students in 
the United States had money in a bank or 
credit union account; 
Whereas expanding access to the safe, 
mainstream financial system will provide in-
dividuals with less expensive and more se-
cure options for managing finances and 
building wealth; 
Whereas quality personal financial edu-
cation is essential to ensure that individuals 
are prepared— 
(1) to manage money, credit, and debt; and 
(2) to become responsible workers, heads of 
household, investors, entrepreneurs, business 
leaders, and citizens; 
Whereas increased financial literacy— 
(1) empowers individuals to make wise fi-
nancial decisions; and 
(2) reduces the confusion caused by an in-
creasingly complex economy; 
Whereas a greater understanding of, and 
familiarity with, financial markets and in-
stitutions will lead to increased economic 
activity and growth; and 
Whereas, in 2003, Congress— 
(1) determined that coordinating Federal 
financial literacy efforts and formulating a 
national strategy is important; and 
(2) in light of that determination, passed 
the Financial Literacy and Education Im-
provement Act (20 U.S.C. 9701 et seq.), estab-
lishing the Financial Literacy and Education 
Commission: Now, therefore, be it

and Mr. SANDERS) submitted the fol-
lowing concurrent resolution; which 
was referred to the Committee on Envi-
ronment and Public Works: 
S. CON. RES. 8 
Whereas a stable climate system at the 
founding of the United States allowed human 
life and human civilization to flourish; 
Whereas the United States was founded on 
the deeply rooted principle of securing ‘‘the 
Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our 
Posterity’’; 
Whereas the Constitution of the United 
States protects the fundamental rights to 
life, liberty, property, and equal protection 
of the laws; 
Whereas a climate system capable of sus-
taining human life— 
(1) is fundamental to a free and ordered so-
ciety; and 
(2) is preservative of fundamental rights, 
including the rights to life, liberty, property, 
personal security, family autonomy, bodily 
integrity, and the ability to learn, practice, 
and transmit cultural and religious tradi-
tions; 
Whereas the Federal Government sets the 
energy policy of the United States, which 
has resulted in a national energy system in 
which approximately 80 percent of the en-
ergy in the United States comes from fossil 
fuels; 
Whereas the national fossil fuel-based en-
ergy system has led to carbon dioxide emis-
sions from the United States constituting 
more than 1⁄4 of cumulative global carbon di-
oxide emissions; 
Whereas the United States is the largest 
producer of oil and gas in the world, due in 
substantial part to the Federal Govern-
ment— 
(1) opening up Federal public land and 
water for fossil fuel extraction; and 
(2) actively supporting fossil fuel energy; 
Whereas there is an overwhelming sci-
entific consensus that— 
(1) human-caused climate change is occur-
ring; and 
(2) the rate of global heating and ocean 
acidification as of April 2021 is a result of the 
buildup of atmospheric greenhouse gas emis-
sions, primarily carbon dioxide emissions, 
largely from the combustion of fossil fuels; 
Whereas atmospheric carbon dioxide levels 
of over 400 parts per million as of April 2021 
have caused a dangerous planetary energy

imbalance, equivalent to the quantity of en-
ergy of exploding more than 400,000 atomic 
bombs of the kind dropped on Hiroshima, 
Japan, per day, 365 days per year, across the 
planet; 
Whereas the latest climate science and 
real-world observations of that energy im-
balance demonstrate that the approximately 
1 degree Celsius of warming that has already 
occurred as a result of human-caused cli-
mate change is already dangerous and nega-
tively affecting all aspects of society and the 
economy of the United States; 
Whereas the last time that atmospheric 
concentrations of carbon dioxide were over 
400 parts per million— 
(1) the seas were 70 to 90 feet higher; 
(2) Greenland had no ice; and 
(3) coral reefs suffered a major extinction; 
Whereas similar conditions will result if 
the United States does not drastically reduce 
carbon dioxide emissions and naturally se-
quester excess concentrations of atmos-
pheric carbon dioxide during the 21st cen-
tury; 
Whereas climate change is a threat to na-
tional security, as climate change contrib-
utes to and exacerbates global instability 
and conflict; 
Whereas the generation of today’s children 
was born into a climate system made haz-
ardous to their health and well-being be-
cause of human-caused climate change; 
Whereas children are uniquely vulnerable 
to human-caused climate change because of 
their developing bodies, higher exposure to 
air, food, and water per unit of body weight, 
unique behavior patterns, dependence on 
caregivers, and longevity on the planet; 
Whereas human-caused climate change is a 
public health emergency that is adversely 
impacting the physical and mental health of 
children through— 
(1) extreme weather events; 
(2) rising temperatures and increased heat 
exposure; 
(3) decreased air quality; 
(4) altered infectious disease patterns; 
(5) food and water insecurity; and 
(6) other effects; 
Whereas the best scientific information 
available projects a 15- to 30-foot rise in sea 
level by the year 2100 if current trends con-
tinue, with ever greater rises and accelera-
tion in subsequent centuries, resulting in in-
creased erosion and the loss of land, causing 
the loss of communities, homes, infrastruc-
ture, agriculture, and coastal ecosystems for 
children affected, until such time as levels of 
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are dra-
matically reduced and steps are taken to 
cool the upper portion of the ocean; 
Whereas infant mortality increases 25 per-
cent on extremely hot days, with the first 7 
days of life representing a period of critical 
vulnerability; 
Whereas heat illness is a leading cause of 
death and illness in high school athletes, 
with nearly 10,000 episodes of heat illness oc-
curring annually; 
Whereas 8.4 percent of children suffer from 
allergic rhinitis, and the ragweed pollen sea-
son in North America has grown 13 to 27 days 
longer since 1995 due to higher temperatures 
and greater atmospheric carbon dioxide lev-
els; 
Whereas children are especially susceptible 
to air pollution given their developing lungs, 
higher ventilation rate, and higher levels of 
physical activity; 
Whereas children exposed to smoke from 
wildfires, which have increased in frequency 
and severity due to rising temperatures and 
droughts, suffer substantial— 
(1) eye symptoms; and 
(2) upper and lower respiratory symptoms 
that lead to increased rates of asthma-re-
lated hospitalizations and emergency room 
visits; 
Whereas long-term exposure to fine partic-
ulate matter, including from sources of air 
pollution and smoke from wildfires, is asso-
ciated 
with 
higher 
COVID–19 
mortality 
rates; 
Whereas extreme weather events can nega-
tively impact the mental health of children 
due to— 
(1) family loss or separation; 
(2) school interruption; 
(3) scarcities of food, water, and shelter; 
and 
(4) public service outages; 
Whereas, without immediate steps to ad-
dress human-caused climate change, the 
health effects of climate change on children 
will— 
(1) increase in severity and in terms of the 
number of children impacted; and 
(2) cost the United States billions of dol-
lars per year by the end of the 21st century; 
Whereas children will largely shoulder the 
costs of human-caused climate change; 
Whereas further increases in global tem-
perature will saddle children with an enor-
mous, perhaps incalculable, cost burden, un-
dermining their economic security and the 
economic security of the United States; 
Whereas children are deserving of special 
consideration and protection with respect to 
human-caused climate change; 
Whereas children on the frontlines of 
human-caused climate change across the 
United States and globally have risen up and 
called upon government leaders around the 
world to take concrete, science-based, and 
equitable action— 
(1) 
to 
address 
human-caused 
climate 
change; and 
(2) to ensure environmental and climate 
justice for their generation and future gen-
erations, including children from vulnerable 
communities that have borne the brunt of 
climate change; 
Whereas children within environmental 
justice communities, including communities 
of color, low-income communities, and indig-
enous communities, that have contributed 
the least to emissions— 
(1) have long suffered from systemic envi-
ronmental racism and social and economic 
injustices; 
(2) are disproportionately burdened by ad-
verse health or environmental effects; and 
(3) are subjected to disproportionate en-
ergy burdens; 
Whereas members and children from front-
line and environmental justice communities, 
who are more likely to reside in areas with 
greater exposure to air pollution, are dis-
proportionately impacted by the COVID–19 
pandemic; 
Whereas global atmospheric carbon dioxide 
concentrations must be reduced to less than 
350 parts per million by the end of the 21st 
century, with further reductions thereafter, 
to restore the energy balance of the planet, 
stabilize the climate system, and protect the 
ice sheets and oceans for posterity; 
Whereas existing and future adverse public 
health and other impacts and costs to chil-
dren and the United States can be signifi-
cantly mitigated if the United States acts 
promptly to reduce emissions from fossil 
fuels in the United States; 
Whereas numerous experts have concluded 
that there are multiple technically and eco-
nomically feasible pathways to place all sec-
tors of the economy of the United States on 
an emissions-reduction path consistent with 
returning global atmospheric carbon dioxide 
to 350 parts per million by 2100; 
Whereas producing energy in the United 
States with non-carbon emitting sources will 
result in energy costs within the range of re-
cent experience, ultimately saving con-
sumers money and stabilizing the cost of en-
ergy, while increasing the number of jobs in 
the energy sector; and 
Whereas multiple Federal departments and 
agencies can exercise authority delegated by 
Congress to prevent and respond to climate 
change, including— 
(1) the Department of Energy; 
(2) the Department of the Interior; 
(3) the Department of Agriculture; 
(4) the Environmental Protection Agency; 
(5) the Department of Commerce; and 
(6) the Department of State: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate (the House of Rep-
resentatives concurring), That it is the sense 
of Congress that— 
(1) renewed leadership by the United States 
is needed immediately to address the human- 
caused climate crisis that is disproportion-
ately affecting the health, economic oppor-
tunity, and fundamental rights of the chil-
dren of the United States; and 
(2) there is an urgent human-caused cli-
mate crisis that— 
(A) has inspired children across the United 
States to organize and demand immediate 
government action to protect their funda-
mental rights from the perils of climate 
change; and 
(B) demands a national, comprehensive, 
science-based, and just climate recovery plan 
that— 
(i) is prepared by Federal departments and 
agencies pursuant to delegated authority 
over energy and climate policy; and 
(ii) upholds the fundamental rights of chil-
dren and puts the United States on a trajec-
tory consistent with reducing global atmos-
pheric carbon dioxide to less than 350 parts 
per million by 2100.

SIKH AWARENESS AND 
APPRECIATION MONTH 
HON. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 22, 2021 
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Madam Speaker, 
today I rise to recognize the month of April as 
‘‘Sikh Awareness and Appreciation Month’’ in 
my home state of Illinois. The 8th Congres-
sional District is home to many Sikh-Ameri-
cans and Sikh faithful, and I wish to recognize 
their valuable contributions to my district and 
to our state and country, I believe this recogni-
tion is especially timely, given the disturbing 
rise in hate crimes and violent acts per-
petrated against Sikh-Americans, most re-
cently on April 15, 2021 at a Federal Express 
facility located in Indianapolis. 
The first followers of the Sikh religion emi-
grated to the United States over 125 years 
ago, where they found work on farms located 
in California and in the lumber mills of Wash-
ington state. Despite suffering persecution and 
discrimination, these patriotic Sikh-Americans 
persevered and found ways to participate in 
civic life, including service in the United States 
Army. In 1918, Sergeant Bhagat Singh Thind 
was the first serviceman in the history of the 
United States Army allowed to wear a turban 
as part of his military uniform. Sikh-Americans 
continued to proudly serve with distinction in 
the Second World War, Korean War, Vietnam 
War and in our conflicts in Afghanistan and 
Iraq. 
In addition to military service, Sikh-Ameri-
cans have made countless contributions to our 
common good. They include scientists like Dr. 
Narinder Singh Kapany, who is widely known 
as the ‘‘father of fiber optic technology,’’ and 
Dr. Gurtej Singh Sandhu, one of the world’s 
most prolific inventors. They include artists 
and musicians like Grammy nominee Snatam 
Kaur Khalsa, and activist and award-winning 
filmmaker Valarie Kaur. They include entre-
preneurs like Waris Ahluwalia, an actor, model 
and businessman. And they include men and 
women called to public service, like Dalip 
Singh Saund, who in 1957 became the first 
Asian-American, Indian-American and member 
of a non-Abrahamic faith to be elected to 
serve in this House of Representatives. 
As revealed by Guru Nanak and the Adi 
Granth, Sikhism teaches that there is only one 
God, that God is without form or gender, that 
we are all equal before God, and that a good 
life is lived as part of a community and ex-
pressed by good deeds and not merely by 
good thoughts. These tenets of service and 
respect for the rights and dignity of all stand 
in painful contrast to the recent vile speech 
and acts of violence directed at Sikh commu-
nities. Madam Speaker, during this month of 
appreciation for Sikh Americans, I want to offi-
cially recognize the contributions of the more 
than 700,000 members of the United States 
Sikh community to business, the arts, science, 
medicine, literature and philosophy. Addition-
ally, I ask all Americans to take to heart the 
Sikh religion’s belief in the sanctity of each 
person, respect for freedom of religion, and 
creed that community service is the foundation 
for living a good life.

IN HONOR OF THE RETIREMENT 
OF 
SERGEANT 
MARK 
SZYMANKIEWICZ 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 22, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today 
to 
recognize 
Sergeant 
Mark 
Szymankiewicz of the Woodhaven Police De-
partment. His honorable years of service to 
our community is worthy of commendation. 
Sergeant Szymankiewicz retired on April 9, 
2021 after serving over two decades with the 
Woodhaven Police Department. A graduate of 
Lake Superior State and Eastern Michigan 
University, Sergeant Szymankiewicz was a 
valued leader and mainstay of the department 
since August of 1999 when he began his ca-
reer as a patrol officer with the unit. Assigned 
to the Detective Bureau in 2017, he was pro-
moted to the rank of Sergeant on March 18, 
2019. 
Since 2004, he has mentored students inter-
ested in a career in law enforcement through 
the Woodhaven Police Explorers program. 
Sergeant Szymankiewicz also served on the 
board of the Michigan Law Enforcement Youth 
Advisory Committee. Active in service on duty 
and off, he served on the Woodhaven Police 
Department Honor Guard. 
A lifelong resident of Downriver, he was 
raised in Brownstown Township, Michigan by 
Tony and Crystal along with his brothers Den-
nis and Steve. Dedicated to the community 
where he was born and raised, Sergeant 
Szymankiewicz still lives in Brownstown Town-
ship today with his son Jake. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Sergeant Mark Szymankiewicz 
for a career of invaluable service to the 
Woodhaven Police Department. I join with 
Sergeant Szymankiewicz’s family, friends, and 
colleagues in extending my gratitude to him 
for his exemplary and honorable service to our 
community and thank him for his role in serv-
ing the City of Woodhaven for the past two 
decades.

IN MEMORY OF JOHN FRANCIS 
GORITY 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 22, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to honor the life and legacy of my 
friend John Francis Gority, who passed away 
on April 12, at the age of 74. 
Throughout his life, John devoted himself to 
our nation and our community. A veteran of 
the Vietnam War, John was awarded a purple 
heart after being wounded in the line of duty. 
After returning home to Blair County, John 
worked tirelessly to serve local veterans. In 
addition to serving as Post Commander of the 
Altoona Veterans of Foreign Wars Post No. 3, 
John was also a member of Catholic War Vet-
erans, the American Legion’s Gallitzin Chap-
ter, and Disabled American Veterans. 
A 1965 graduate of Bishop Guilfoyle High 
School, John continued his education at Penn 
State University, where he studied business 
administration. As a businessman, he owned 
and operated Broadway Sharpening and 
Gority Cabinetry for more than 30 years. 
John was a staple of the Blair County Com-
munity. In addition to his work with local vet-
erans, John also served as a leader of the 
Blair County Historical Society, Open Doors 
for the Handicapped, Eastern Amputee Golf 
Association, Fire Base Eagle, and Bravo Com-
pany. 
As a community leader, John Francis Gority 
exemplified a life of service to our nation and 
to his neighbors. On behalf of Pennsylvania’s 
13th Congressional District, it is my privilege 
to honor John for his many contributions. I ex-
tend my deepest condolences to John’s de-
voted wife Donna, their two daughters, and 
four grandchildren as they mourn this great 
loss.

Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, today, for the second time in 
two years, the House will vote to end cen-
turies of political repression in the District of 
Columbia by granting the District statehood. 
For too long Congress has denied more 
than 712,000 Americans in the District the fun-
damental right to full representation in govern-
ment. Today we say no more. 
All 37 states that have been added to the 
union were admitted by legislation with a sim-
ple majority vote. There is no reason admitting 
the District should be any different.

ple of its capital lack representation. The

United States is the only democratic country

legislature and local self-government to the 
people of its capital. 
Today we say no more. 
My Republican colleagues would rather con-
tinue to deny voting rights for hundreds of 
thousands of American citizens because they 
may vote for Democrats. 
Today we say no more. 
We say no more to taxation without rep-

TRIBUTE 
TO 
THE 
LIFE 
OF 
FORMER CHIEF JUSTICE MARY 
MULLARKEY 
HON. DIANA DeGETTE 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 22, 2021 
Ms. DEGETTE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today, along with Congressman ED
PERL-
MUTTER, Congressman JASON
CROW, and 
Congressman JOE NEGUSE, to recognize the 
life and achievements of former Chief Justice 
of 
the 
Colorado 
Supreme 
Court 
Mary 
Mullarkey, who passed away on Wednesday, 
March 31, 2021. 
Mary’s journey is a familiar Colorado story. 
She was born and raised elsewhere, in Wis-
consin. While there, she graduated from St. 
Norbert College before earning her law degree 
at Harvard University in 1968. After law 
school, Mary traveled to Washington, D.C. in 
order to work for the Department of the Inte-
rior in the agency’s equal employment oppor-
tunity division. Not only did she find the begin-
ning of what would become a lengthy and dis-
tinguished career in public service, but she 
also found the love of her life, Tom Korson. By 
1973, the two had married and moved to Den-
ver for what was supposed to be a brief ‘‘ad-
venture,’’ not to exceed two years. However, 
as the story so often goes, they fell in love 
with Colorado and thankfully decided to make 
our state a permanent home for themselves 
and eventually for their son Andrew. 
As many Coloradans have reflected in the 
wake of her passing, Mary—or ‘‘the Chief,’’ as 
she was affectionately known by her former 
law clerks—was a remarkable woman with a 
brilliant legal career. She advised Governors, 
ran her own law firm, served as our state’s 
Solicitor General and led the appellate division 
in the Colorado Attorney General’s Office be-
fore her appointment to the Colorado Supreme 
Court in 1987. Mary served on the court for 23 
years. 
Mary’s legacy while serving on this es-
teemed bench is unmatched. She was nomi-
nated by her colleagues to be the court’s first 
woman Chief Justice in 1998. She served in 
this capacity for 12 years, and she is the 
court’s longest serving chief justice. During her 
time on the Court, Coloradans benefited from 
her fair and thoughtful decisions. She au-
thored more than 470 opinions, including her 
most memorable case, which was a 2002 de-
cision granting land access to descendants of 
Mexican homesteaders in the San Luis Valley 
after decades of dispute. 
Beyond the courtroom, her reputation as a 
trailblazer and a tireless advocate continued. 
During her tenure, she accomplished the 
amazing feat of building a new home for the 
judiciary, the Ralph L. Carr Colorado Judicial 
Center, named for the state’s Republican gov-
ernor who opposed the use of internment 
camps for Japanese individuals during World 
War II. She also expanded access to the 
courts by hiring professional interpreters to 
break down language barriers for those who 
sought the court’s protection. To that same 
end, she added more jurists to resolve more 
cases and insisted that childcare be provided 
in courthouses so that parents could more 
easily access the court system. 
When Mary was diagnosed with Multiple 
Sclerosis, she faced that challenge the way 
she approached life in general—with deter-
mination, grit, and resolve. My husband Lino 
and I are honored, along with so many others, 
to call her a friend and role model. 
Truly, the light that Mary cast over once hid-
den spaces within the state’s judiciary, over 
those parents and individuals who sought the 
court’s haven, and over those Coloradans who 
get up and work hard every day despite living 
with a debilitating disease—that light will shine 
as strongly and brilliantly as Mary Mullarkey 
did for many, many years to come. Our heart-
felt condolences go out to her family, in par-
ticular to Tom, Mary’s husband of 49 years, as 
well as to their son Andrew, and to all the 
friends, colleagues, and Coloradans who 
mourn her loss.

IN 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
ANDREW 
SMITH’S SERVICE TO THE GREEN 
BAY POLICE DEPARTMENT 
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 22, 2021 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise in honor of the career and service of retir-
ing Green Bay Police Chief Andrew Smith. 
Chief Andrew Smith’s career as a Police Of-
ficer began 33 years ago when he arrived in 
Green Bay from Los Angeles after having 
served 27 1⁄2 years with the Los Angeles Po-
lice Department. Throughout his career, he 
held countless command level assignments in 
Media 
Relations 
and 
Community 
Affairs 
groups, Operations, and Criminal Gang Homi-
cide Division. For those who are unfamiliar 
with Chief Smith’s extensive career with the 
LAPD, you may recognize him from the pop-
ular true crime docuseries on Netflix: The Van-
ishing at the Cecil Hotel. 
During Chief Smith’s time with the Green 
Bay Police Department, transparency was one 
of his top priorities. He gave regular updates 
to the public through the department’s commu-
nity update videos where he would address 
current events taking place throughout the 
Green Bay Area. During Chief Smith’s tenure 
the Green Bay Police Department successfully 
grew, hiring 65 new police officers and swear-
ing in approximately 190 officers. 
When the attacks against our men and 
women in uniform sparked national attention 
last summer, Chief Smith continued to protect 
and defend the Green Bay area. I commend 
his selfless service and dedication to the 
Green Bay Police Department and sur-
rounding communities. 
Chief Smith is leaving behind a notable leg-
acy that will be admired by generations of po-
lice officers for years to come. After retire-
ment, Chief Smith and his family plan to stay 
in Green Bay and I am confident that he will 
continue to be a value add to Northeast Wis-
consin. Chief Smith’s dedication and selfless 
service to his community is deserving of the 
highest degree of recognition and honor. I 
wish Chief Smith and his family all the best in 
his retirement.

COMMEMORATING 
THE 
175TH 
CELEBRATION OF THE FOUNDING 
OF HENDERSON COUNTY 
HON. LANCE GOODEN 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 22, 2021 
Mr. GOODEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to commemorate the 175th celebra-
tion of the founding Henderson County, Texas. 
Henderson County was formed April 27, 1846, 
and named in honor of James Pinckney Hen-
derson, the first attorney general of the Re-
public of Texas, and secretary of state for the 
republic, and most importantly the first Gov-
ernor of Texas. 
Henderson County has a rich history, includ-
ing the one-time Black-Eyed Pea Capital of 
the world, and the home of the hamburger. 
Now, many Texans enjoy the wide-ranging ac-
tivities Henderson County offers including 
recreation, entertainment, hunting, and fishing, 
along with the Texas Forest Trail and the 
Texas Lakes Trail. The county also brings in 
visitors from across the state and nation with 
events such as the Old Fiddle Reunion, held 
in May, and the Black-Eyed Pea Jamboree 
which is held in July. 
After 175 years, Henderson County con-
tinues to be a vibrant community that supports 
family, sports, fine arts, churches, and numer-
ous organizations for more than 84,000 resi-
dents that make up 20 municipalities. 
I am proud to represent Henderson County 
and the many people who make it a wonderful 
place to live. Congratulations to everyone in 
the county on celebrating their 175th anniver-
sary.

HONORING 
THE 
225TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE STEUBEN COUNTY 
SHERIFF’S OFFICE 
HON. TOM REED 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 22, 2021 
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, today I rise to 
honor the 225th anniversary of the Steuben 
County Sheriffs Office, and the legacy of the 
office’s public service and dedication to public 
safety. 
The Steuben County Sheriffs Office was 
constitutionally established in 1796, with Wil-
liam Dunn being sworn in as Sheriff on March 
31, 1796. From 1796 until 1873, the Steuben 
County Sheriffs Office was the only law en-
forcement agency serving the county. The 
longest serving Sheriff was Jack Lisi, who 
served from 1970 to 1987. 
Sheriff James Allard is the current sheriff of 
the county and is the fifty-ninth Sheriff to serve 
in office. James has a strong commitment to 
serving his community and became Under-
sheriff of the county in 2013. He was elected 
as Sheriff in 2016. 
We are honored to be able to recognize the 
Steuben County Sheriffs Office in this way. 
The Steuben County Sheriffs Office has pro-
vided service and safety to the communities it 
served for hundreds of years and should be 
honored for that service. We cannot forget the 
great personal risk and dedication each Sheriff 
showed during their service. Today, we stand 
and honor those efforts before the eyes of 
America. 
Given the above, I ask that this Legislative 
Body pause in its deliberations and join me to 
honor the 225th anniversary of the Steuben 
County Sheriff’s Office, and the legacy of the 
office’s public service and dedication to public 
safety.

IN 
MEMORY 
OF 
FORMER 
CON-
GRESSWOMAN 
ELIZABETH 
FURSE 
HON. SUZANNE BONAMICI 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 22, 2021 
Ms. BONAMICI. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the memory of Congresswoman Eliza-
beth Furse, who represented the people of Or-
egon’s First District in this chamber from 1993 
to 1999. 
I am privileged to have called Elizabeth a 
friend and a mentor. My first experience volun-
teering for a political campaign was when I 
made calls and knocked on doors working for 
her Congressional race for re-election in 1994. 
She inspired dedication to worthy causes, in-
cluding co-founding the Oregon Peace Insti-
tute, and embodied the traits all public serv-
ants should strive to uphold—to meet the 
needs of their community and drive meaning-
ful change. Her trailblazing example helped 
shape my life and my career, and the lives of 
so many others. 
Elizabeth was only the third woman to rep-
resent Oregon in the House of Representa-
tives, and as an immigrant she was fully com-
mitted to protecting the rights of all. Her start 
in advocacy came at a young age in Kenya, 
and in her youth she courageously partici-
pated in the protests against apartheid in 
South Africa. From there she continued to 
grow as a leader and advocate, pursuing a ca-
reer path that allowed her to serve as a fierce 
champion for tribal sovereignty, social justice, 
and peace. She aided countless people during 
her time in Congress and throughout her life, 
and her many achievements include helping 
the Grand Ronde, Klamath, and Coquille 
tribes gain federal recognition, as well as in-
creasing access to public transportation in our 
region by extending light rail service to Hills-
boro. After leaving Congress, Elizabeth contin-
ued to stay involved in her community and en-
joyed spending time with her husband John at 
their winery. 
Our world, and especially NW Oregon, is a 
better place because of Elizabeth’s tireless de-
votion to improving the lives of those around 
her. Let us continue to serve others in her 
memory.

TRIBUTE 
TO 
THE 
LIFE 
OF 
FORMER JUSTICE GREGORY K. 
SCOTT 
HON. DIANA DeGETTE 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 22, 2021 
Ms. DEGETTE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today, along with Congressman Ed Perlmutter, 
Congressman Jason Crow, and Congressman 
Joe Neguse, to recognize the life and accom-
plishments of the first and only African Amer-
ican to serve on our state’s highest court, 
former Colorado Supreme Court Justice Greg-
ory K. Scott who passed away on Wednesday, 
March 31, 2021 at the age of 72. 
Justice Scott graduated from Rutgers Uni-
versity before attending law school at Indiana 
University. In 1977, he and his wife Carolyn, 
also an attorney, moved to Denver so that 
Scott could start his new position as a trial at-
torney at the U.S. Securities and Exchange 
Commission’s regional office. Later, Scott 
joined the faculty at University of Denver’s 
Sturm College of Law as a professor, where 
he taught numerous students about securities 
and corporate law. While making their life in 
Denver, the couple welcomed two sons, both 
of whom sadly preceded them in death. 
In 1993, then Governor Roy Romer ap-
pointed Scott to the Colorado Supreme Court, 
making him the first—and thus far the only— 
African American to serve at the highest level 
of our state’s judiciary. During his time on the 
bench, Justice Scott participated in 1,000 deci-
sions, some notable ones including Evans v. 
Romer, which involved the court stepping in to 
stop enforcement of a ban that infringed the 
rights of our gay and lesbian Coloradans, and 
also Hill v. Thomas, a decision he penned 
himself to uphold the state law I wrote to man-
date an 8–foot buffer zone between protesters 
and individuals trying to gain entrance into 
Colorado abortion clinics. I am proud to note 
that the U.S. Supreme Court later upheld this 
decision, finding the same truth we hold so 
dear in Colorado, that rights of speech and ac-
cess to reproductive care can both be vigor-
ously protected. 
Justice Scott served admirably both inside 
and outside of the courtroom, especially when 
it came to championing the civil nights causes 
he cherished deeply. While living in Denver, 
he took pride in mentoring law students, espe-
cially law students of color, who believed as 
he did—as we all do—that diversity in the 
legal profession is vital to the best interests of 
clients, whether corporate or individual, and 
every Coloradan. Additionally, Scott was ac-
tive with the local NAACP chapter, the Urban 
League, and the Sam Cary Bar Association. 
Even in his retirement years, Scott continued 
answering the call to serve. After moving to 
his wife’s hometown in Indiana, he became 
the executive director of the Indiana Civil 
Rights Commission. 
Justice Scott has been remembered by 
friends and former colleagues as a ‘‘giant’’ in 
Colorado’s legal community with a brilliant 
legal mind and a profound respect for the rule 
of law. Truly, he will always be remembered 
for his lasting legacy on our state’s supreme 
court, but also as a bowtie-wearing jurist who 
was as likable as he was learned, and as so-
cially conscious as he was compassionate. 
We send our heartfelt condolences to his wife 
Carolyn and to the entire Scott family, as well 
as to the Coloradans who are saddened by 
his loss.

region’s art and culture landscape. As a life-
long supporter of the theater community, 
Nancy worked tirelessly to advocate for the 
Southern Alleghenies Museum of Art. She was 
an outstanding artist, actress, and musician 
who used her talents to bless others. 
A lifelong Blair County resident, Nancy was 
born on July 9, 1935 in East Freedom and at-
tended Altoona High School, where she was 
elected president of her class and graduated 
in 1953. She was a loving mother, grand-
mother and great-grandmother whose com-
passion and care for her family was evident to 
everyone she met. In addition to her artistic 
pursuits, Nancy served the Altoona community 
as a member of the Blair County Historical So-
ciety. We also shared a love of gardening. 
On behalf of Pennsylvania’s 13th Congres-
sional District, it is my privilege to celebrate 
the life of Nancy Hicks Sheetz and honor her 
legacy. She leaves a profound void in the 
community that I share alongside all who 
knew her. As we remember Nancy for her 
many contributions to Blair County and our 
commonwealth, I extend my deepest condo-
lences to the Sheetz family.

DINARY LIFE AND LEGACY OF 
REVEREND ROY L. FERGUSON 
HON. TERRI A. SEWELL 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 22, 2021 
Ms. SEWELL. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life and legacy of Reverend Roy 
L. Ferguson, a beloved pastor and active com-
munity leader who passed away at the age of 
76 on April 15, 2021. In 1983, Rev. Ferguson 
was elected Pastor of Saint John Baptist 
Church in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, where he 
served his congregation valiantly for 38 years. 
Demonstrating a continued dedication to pub-
lic service, Rev. Ferguson contributed to the 
lives of many through mentorship and ministry, 
lifting spirits and soothing troubled souls. 
Born on July 16, 1945, in Pickensville, Ala-
bama, Rev. Ferguson graduated from Mis-
sissippi Valley College, where he studied 
physical education. He continued his edu-
cation attending Birmingham Bible College 
and Samford University. In 1978, Rev. Fer-
guson answered the call to ministry under the 
leadership of Dr. J.C. Curry, Pastor of Mac-
edonia Missionary Baptist Church in Flint, 
Michigan. Shortly after, Rev. Ferguson’s em-
ployer transferred him to Tuscaloosa, where 
he began his tenure as an associate minister 
at Saint John Baptist Church in 1982. He mar-
ried Coleen Hudson, and together they had 
seven children. 
Rev. Ferguson was a dedicated public serv-
ant who contributed to the progression of Civil 
and Human Rights through his positions as a 
board member of the State Southern Christian 
Leadership Conference, President Emeritus of 
the Tuscaloosa County Chapter Southern 
Christian Conference, and President of Tusca-
loosa Ministerial Alliance. Expanding his influ-
ence outside of ministry, Rev. Ferguson gave 
back to the Tuscaloosa community by acting 
as a mentor in the Stars Program at Tusca-
loosa City Schools and Tuscaloosa Juvenile 
Detention Center. He lived his life by example, 
encouraging the members of his community 
and congregation to live up to their full poten-
tial in Christ. 
Throughout 
his 
life, 
Rev. 
Ferguson 
prioritized the importance of teaching the next 
generation about Black history. He believed 
that if we are to truly bring about change in 
this Nation, it is our responsibility to preserve 
the legacy of those on whose shoulders we 
stand. 
On a personal note, I am eternally grateful 
for the support, friendship, and wise counsel 
that Rev. Ferguson and his dedicated wife 
Coleen always extend to me. The amazing 
congregation of St. John Baptist Church was 
a special refuge to my staff and I and will al-
ways be a comforting source of love and sup-
port. I am forever indebted to Rev. Ferguson 
for representing Alabama’s 7th Congressional 
District at the National Day of Prayer in Wash-
ington, D.C. I could always count on Rev. Fer-
guson to extend his ministry for the good of 
our community. I was constantly reminded by 
the example that Rev. Ferguson set on how to 
extend favor and fulfillment to others. May we 
find comfort in knowing that the legacy of Rev. 
Ferguson will live in the many people that he 
touched. Let us be renewed by his giving spirit 
to make a difference in our communities. Rest 
In Peace. 
On behalf of Alabama’s 7th Congressional 
District, I ask my colleagues to join me in rec-
ognizing the extraordinary life and legacy of 
Reverend Roy L. Ferguson and his out-
standing contributions to the Tuscaloosa com-
munity.

SHARK FIN SALES ELIMINATION 
ACT OF 2021 
HON. GREGORIO KILILI CAMACHO 
SABLAN 
OF THE NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 22, 2021 
Mr. SABLAN. Madam Speaker, on Earth 
Day 2021, together with Rep. MCCAUL and 
103 other original cosponsors, I am reintro-
ducing the Shark Fin Sales Elimination Act. 
The Act bans the buying and selling of 
shark fins in the United States and passed in 
the 116th Congress with bipartisan support 
and, ultimately, 287 cosponsors. It was the 
largest number of cosponsors for any ocean 
conservation bill in the previous Congress. 
The Shark Fin Sales Elimination Act has 
such strong bipartisan support, because it is 
an effective way to remove the United States 
from the devastating global trade in shark fins, 
at no cost. And because it does so without 
stopping those who want to fish for sharks and 
use them whole. 
Madam Speaker, sharks are absolutely crit-
ical to life in the ocean. As apex predators, 
they help maintain balance by keeping prey 
populations in check. They are also critical to 
the tourism economy of our coastal commu-
nities. In Florida alone, tourists, who go diving 
to see sharks, generate more than 200 times 
the value of the trade in shark fins for our en-
tire country. 
Despite their importance ecologically and 
economically, sharks are in serious trouble. 
Each year, fins from up to 73 million sharks 
are sliced off and sold in the global market-
place. And, largely due to this demand for fins, 
some shark species have now declined by 
more than 90 percent. 
Our nation has wisely banned the inhumane 
practice of finning sharks and throwing them 
back into the ocean to die. Yet, we still allow 
fins to be bought and sold here. And many of 
the fins we are buying and selling come from 
countries that simply do not have the same 
level of protection the U.S. gives sharks. 
Now is time for us to take that next step. 
Only by banning the shark fin trade once and 
for all within our borders can we ensure we 
are no longer supporting an unsustainable use 
of ocean resources. 
Recognizing this unsustainability, the North-
ern Mariana Islands, my home, was the very 
first U.S. insular area to ban the trade of shark 
fins in 2011. As an island culture 3,000 years 
old, the people of the Marianas understand 
and respect the important role that sharks play 
in maintaining the life of our oceans. 
We are not alone. Thirteen U.S. states and 
three territories have also passed their own 
shark fin bans. But this patchwork of state 
laws can be challenging to enforce. That is 
why we need a federal ban on the shark fin 
trade in the United States. 
A ban on the shark fin trade is supported by 
45 domestic and international airlines, by 22 
shipping companies, 15 major corporations, 
and nearly 700 U.S. businesses and organiza-
tions. A 2020 national poll found 4 of 5 Amer-
ican voters support a national ban on the buy-
ing and selling of shark fins. Hundreds of sci-
entists, chefs, fishers, and dive and surf busi-
nesses have written to Congress requesting 
passage of a national shark fin ban. 
I want, especially, to thank Oceana, the Hu-
mane Society Legislative Fund, and the Ani-
mal Welfare Institute for those environmental 
organizations’ work to build legislative support 
for the Shark Fin Sales Elimination Act. 
I look forward to quick action in the House 
on the Shark Fin Sales Elimination Act of 
2021.

HONORING ANGOLA’S MEMORIAL 
VFW POST NO. 7205 
HON. JIM BANKS 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 22, 2021 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
pay tribute to Angola’s Veterans of Foreign 
Wars Post No. 7205 as they prepare to cele-
brate their 75th anniversary. 
Founded in the wake of the Second World 
War on May 26, 1946, the Angola VFW post 
was named after George Anspaugh, a Steu-
ben County native who was killed in the war 
while serving in the U.S. Navy. 
The post, which boasts 178 members and 
200 auxiliary members, earned ‘‘All American 
Post’’ status in 2019 for its community con-
tributions, participation in VFW events and 
ability to recruit and retain members. 
I am inspired by the mission of Angola’s 
VFW, and VFW posts nationwide, to not only 
help veterans recover from the wounds of war 
but also to ensure that the national memory of 
those who served is never forgotten. 
From holding a Poppy Drive every year on 
November 7 to commemorate the end of the 
First World War to hosting Veterans Suicide 
Awareness Day to raise proceeds for the Vet-
erans Suicide Crisis Hotline, and more, Hoo-
siers thank Angola’s VFW Post for their work. 
This record is testament to VFW Post No. 
7205’s longevity and achievement, for which 
Angola, and northeast Indiana, is grateful.

Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-

student at Windber Area High School, on 
being crowned the 74th Maple Queen at the 
Pennsylvania Maple Festival. 
A pianist, Rebecca earned accolades at the

Rhapsody,’’ including the Anna Ruth Thomas 
Memorial Talent Award. She also won the 
Promenade Award and the Interview Award. 
As the Maple Queen, Rebecca will rep-
resent Somerset County’s robust maple indus-
try. Since 1947, the Pennsylvania Maple Fes-
tival has been hosted by maple producers 
from across the region to showcase maple 
production. 
On behalf of Pennsylvania’s 13th Congres-
sional District, I congratulate Rebecca and her 
family on this incredible achievement. As Re-
becca commences her service as Maple 
Queen, I wish her every continued success. 
4/23 ANNIVERSARY OF JOSEPH 
STONE’S DEATH 
HON. GWEN MOORE 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 22, 2021 
Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to mark the fourth anniversary 
of the tragic death of Joseph Stone, a U.S. 
paramedic serving with the OSCE Special 
Monitoring Mission (SMM) in Ukraine. 
My heart and prayers go out to his family 
who still feel his absence each and every day. 
Joseph Stone was killed on April 23, 2017, 
when his vehicle struck a landmine in Rus-
sian-controlled territory in eastern Ukraine. 
Born in my district in Milwaukee, he was a 
courageous young man whose life ended 
much too soon. 
Stone gave his life serving a noble mission: 
helping those who document the human suf-
fering inflicted by the Kremlin’s senseless as-
sault on Ukraine. The mission he served with, 
established in 2014, monitors implementation 
of the Minsk Agreements, which were de-
signed to bring peace to eastern Ukraine. It is 
an unarmed, civilian mission that serves as 
the international community’s eyes and ears 
on the security and humanitarian situation in 
the war zone. The SMM operates under a 
mandate adopted by consensus among the 57 
OSCE 
participating 
States, 
including 
the 
United States, Russia, and Ukraine. 
The tragedy of Stone’s death—a direct re-
sult of this needless conflict—is compounded 
today by the continuation of Russian aggres-
sion against Ukraine. Recent weeks have 
seen a dramatic escalation by Russia, which 
has amassed forces and equipment on 
Ukraine’s land and maritime borders and in 
Crimea, which Russia continues to illegally oc-
cupy. Moscow’s actions are accompanied by 
boldfaced denial that these threatening moves 
should be of any concern to Ukraine or its 
friends. 
The latest Russian escalation only under-
lines the crucial role of the SMM and the need 
to ensure that the mission Joseph Stone died 
serving can fully carry out its mandate. Mos-
cow currently blocks the SMM from accessing 
Russia-occupied Crimea. And in parts of 
Ukraine where the SMM is able to operate, its 
monitors are harassed, blocked, and threat-
ened on a daily basis by Russia-led forces, 
who also interfere with the SMM’s equipment 
by jamming UAVs or blinding static cameras. 
Madam Speaker, all OSCE states, including 
Russia, must do everything possible to sup-
port the OSCE monitors who, to this day, face 
unacceptable threats and restrictions as they 
shine a light on the daily cost of this war. The 
monitors must be allowed unfettered access 
throughout Ukraine—including Crimea. And 
rather than deploying more troops, Russia 
should be working with the OSCE to help de-
escalate the situation, including to support the 
deployment of more monitors to prevent fur-
ther conflict and provocation moves. The mis-
sion’s efforts will remain crucial in ensuring the 
international community has full visibility on 
the 
Kremlin’s 
malignant 
actions 
against 
Ukraine. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in 
marking the solemn anniversary of Joseph 
Stone’s death. Let us use this solemn occa-
sion to redouble efforts to work for peace. I 
also want to use this opportunity to applaud 
the men and women of the SMM who are still 
serving today, even as Russia continues to 
escalate. Their work is a critical part of efforts 
to restore Ukraine’s territorial integrity and en-
sure respect for its sovereignty.

to solidify victory and the national title. 
It gives me great pleasure to extend my sin-

Madam Speaker, the players, coaches, and

of their accomplishments. I wish the grad-
uating seniors all the best in their future en-
deavors and good luck to those who will return
