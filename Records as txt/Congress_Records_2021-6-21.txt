PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Dear Lord, teach us this day to open 
our hearts and minds that we would 
know how You intend for us to use the 
gifts of life and love and liberty that 
You have so graciously given us. 
Help us to understand how You de-
fine right and wrong; reveal to us Your 
template for justice that it would be 
clear and compelling. Then may we 
yield ourselves to Your law and seek to 
obey it with our whole selves. 
Direct us this day, every step we 
take, every word we speak, every deci-
sion we make so that when we look 
back at the end of the day, on the path 
on which You have led us, we would 
find joy in the honor we have given 
You. 
May we turn our hearts toward You, 
aligning ourselves to Your will, and 
not toward our own selfish desires. 
May we turn our eyes away from 
worthless pursuits and instead seek to 
give meaning to our lives in light of 
Your truth. 
Hear our desire for Your protection, 
Your providence, and Your presence. 
For our very being, today and always, 
depends on Your covenantal and stead-
fast love. 
We offer these prayers, covered by 
the strength of Your name. 
Amen.

S4637 
Vol. 167 
WASHINGTON, MONDAY, JUNE 21, 2021 
No. 107 
Senate 
The Senate met at 3 p.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. LEAHY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, today, open the minds 
of our lawmakers, that they may wel-
come new insights and knowledge You 
wish to give them. Remind them of 
Your admonition that they should love 
You with all their minds. 
Lord, give them the wisdom to refuse 
to cling so tightly to the past that they 
limit what You can do for them in the 
future. Give them the courage to 
change their minds when that is need-
ed. 
Lord, may they be tolerant to the 
thoughts of others and open to the 
truth wherever they may find it. 
We pray in Your loving Name. Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under 
the previous order, the leadership time 
is reserved. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
HIRONO). The Senator from Vermont. 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I sug-
gest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
MEASURE PLACED ON THE 
CALENDAR—S. 2118 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
understand there is a bill at the desk 
that is due for a second reading. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The lead-
er is correct. 
The clerk will read the bill by title 
for the second time. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
A bill (S. 2118) to amend the Internal Rev-
enue Code of 1986 to provide tax incentives 
for increased investment in clean energy, 
and for other purposes. 
Mr. SCHUMER. In order to place the 
bill on the calendar under rule XIV, I 
object to further proceeding. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion has been heard. The bill will be 
placed on the calendar. 
f 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, on 
today’s, tomorrow’s, and this week’s 
business, the Senate will soon vote on 
two more nominees to join President 
Biden’s 
administration: 
Christopher 
Fonzone to serve as general counsel for 
the Office of the Director of National 
Intelligence and Kiran Ahuja to be Di-
rector of the Office of Personnel Man-
agement. Those votes will happen to-
night and tomorrow. 
The discussions on the bipartisan in-
frastructure bill and a budget rec-
onciliation bill are both moving for-
ward and will continue throughout the 
week. 
But tomorrow—tomorrow—the Sen-
ate will also take a crucial vote on 
whether to start debate on major vot-
ing rights legislation. 
I want to say that again. Tomorrow, 
the Senate will take a vote on whether 
to start debate on legislation to pro-
tect Americans’ voting rights. It is not 
a vote on any particular policy. It is 
not a vote on this bill or that bill. It is 
a vote on whether the Senate should 
simply debate the issue about voting 
rights—the crucial issue of voting 
rights in this country. 
Now, by all rights, we shouldn’t have 
to debate voting rights on the floor of 
the U.S. Senate. These rights should be 
sacrosanct, but the events of the last 
few months compel us to have this de-
bate now. 
Why is there such urgency? Because 
of what has been happening in Repub-
lican legislature after legislature in 
the 
last 
several 
months. 
Voting 
rights—the most fundamental right of 
a democracy, the right that men and 
women have died for in wartime and in 
peacetime, the right by which all other 
rights are secured—are under assault— 
under assault from one end of the coun-
try to the other. 
In the wake of the 2020 election, Don-
ald Trump told a lie—a Big Lie—that 
the election was stolen from him by 
voter fraud. There was no evidence for 
this. His own administration concluded 
that the 2020 election was one of the 
safest in history. His lawyers were 
laughed out of courts, many by Repub-
lican judges—some by judges he ap-
pointed, that Trump appointed. But he 
kept saying it anyway. He lied over 
and over and over again. Donald Trump 
lied over and over and over again, poi-
soning our democracy, lighting a fire 
beneath Republican State legislatures, 
which immediately launched the most 
sweeping voter suppression effort in 
years. 
Just a note, how despicable a man is 
Donald Trump. He lost an election le-
gitimately. He can’t face that—that it 
was his failure. And he creates a lie—a 
Big Lie—and wins so many people over 
to that lie with the help of news media 
and other news commentators who are 
lying, as well, and they know it. 
Again, Donald Trump, with his des-
picable lies, has lit a fire beneath Re-
publican State legislatures, and they

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4638 
June 21, 2021 
have launched the most sweeping voter 
suppression efforts in at least 80 years. 
More than 250 bills in 43 States were 
introduced just between the months of 
January and February that would re-
strict the right to vote. Do you want to 
know how many were introduced dur-
ing a similar period of time last year, 
the year before Donald Trump was tell-
ing the Big Lie? Thirty-five. Thirty- 
five in 2020 and more than 250 in 2021. 
Today, in June, there have been near-
ly 400 bills introduced. The only thing 
that changed between 2020 and 2021 was 
Donald Trump’s Big Lie about massive 
fraud. 
And now in States like Georgia and 
Iowa and Florida and Montana, these 
proposals are becoming law under the 
vicious guise of election integrity. The 
words ‘‘election integrity’’ aren’t a 
guise. There is nothing vicious about 
them. The way Republican legislatures 
are using those words is vicious and a 
guise, a falsehood, fake. 
I want my Republican colleagues— 
maybe, we can awaken their con-
science, maybe, on something as sacred 
as voting rights. I want my Republican 
colleagues to listen to some of the poli-
cies that have been proposed by Repub-
lican State legislatures and tell me 
how they are about election integrity, 
how they are about suppressing fraud: 
Reducing polling hours in polling 
places. How is that about election in-
tegrity? How does that reduce voter 
fraud? 
Mandating that every precinct, no 
matter how large or small, have the 
same number of ballot drop boxes—a 
county of a million or a county of 1,000, 
the same number. How does that re-
duce fraud? What does that have to do 
with election integrity? 
No after-hours voting, no 24-hour 
voting, no drive-through voting. What 
does that have to do with election 
fraud? 
It certainly has everything to do 
with reducing people’s right to vote 
and the ability to vote, but nothing to 
do with election fraud. 
My Republican colleagues, how does 
making it a crime to give food or water 
to voters waiting in long lines at the 
polls deter voter fraud, which, really, 
we have found no evidence exists, to 
begin with—very little evidence? 
By the way, in so many States, if you 
are African American, if you are inner 
city, if you are poor, if you are Brown, 
you have to wait a lot longer than if 
you are White and in the suburbs. 
Don’t give them water. Don’t allow 
them to have a drink as they are wait-
ing in the hot Sun in line to vote. 
Yeah. What does that have to do with 
voter fraud? It has to do with cruelty, 
it has to do with nastiness, and it has 
to do with suppressing the vote. 
Allowing a judge to overturn an elec-
tion; allowing a partisan State election 
board to replace a duly elected county 
election board member if they are 
underperforming—what does that have 
to do with fraud? What does that have 
to do with fraud? 
Removing student IDs from the list 
of valid forms of identification—that is 
election integrity? Bunk. We know 
what you are doing. You don’t want 
students to vote. Yeah. Don’t let stu-
dents vote. Turn them off to the whole 
process, and make America even more 
alienated. 
Delaying the hours of Sunday voting 
until the evening, which, coinciden-
tally or not so coincidentally, by these 
Republican legislatures makes it hard-
er for Black churchgoers to participate 
in voter drives after Sunday services— 
how despicable. Does that sound like 
Jim Crow, my Republican colleagues? 
It sure does to a lot of us. 
I 
challenge 
my 
Republican 
col-
leagues. I challenge you, Republican 
Senators: Come to the floor. Defend 
these policies. Tell us how they secure 
the vote. Tell us how they prevent 
nearly nonexistent voter fraud. How 
does removing student IDs as a valid 
form of identification secure our elec-
tions? Do you have any evidence that 
40-year-olds are showing up at the polls 
with fake student IDs? Come on, show 
us. How is criminalizing giving water 
or food to voters in a line a fraud pre-
vention measure? You got any evidence 
of that? What arguments do Repub-
licans have for restrictions on Sunday 
voting? That is what Texas Senators— 
Texas Republicans want to do. Do any 
of my colleagues actually have evi-
dence that voter fraud is especially 
prevalent on the Lord’s Day? Please. 
We know what you are up to. America 
knows what you are up to. And not to 
debate this? Are you afraid to debate 
it? Do you not have any good argu-
ments? 
Let’s dispense with this nonsense. 
There is no real principle behind these 
policies. They are not about election 
integrity, and they are not about voter 
fraud. These policies have one purpose 
and one purpose only: making it harder 
for younger, poorer, non-White, and 
typically Democratic voters to access 
the ballot and to give Republicans a 
partisan advantage at the polls by 
making it harder for Democratic-lean-
ing voters to vote. 
You lose an election, you are not sup-
posed to stop people from voting, even 
if they didn’t vote for you. That is not 
democracy, my Republican friends. 
You lose an election, you are supposed 
to try harder to win over the voters 
you lost. 
Republicans across the country are 
trying to stop the other side from vot-
ing. That tears and rips apart the very 
fabric of our democracy. 
Disenfranchising millions of Ameri-
cans is bad enough, but there is actu-
ally another sinister component of 
these voter suppression laws. In States 
like Arizona, Kansas, Arkansas, and 
Georgia, Republican legislatures are 
trying to give more power to them-
selves and other partisan bodies to un-
dermine, override, and neuter bipar-
tisan election boards and county-elect-
ed officials. 
It has always been bipartisan. They 
didn’t like the result. They lost fair 
and square. Get rid of the election 
board official when there is no evidence 
they did anything wrong. The cumu-
lative effect will make it easier for fol-
lowers of Trump’s Big Lie, for partisan 
Republicans to rig the rules and try to 
overturn election results. 
I read this article in the New York 
Times this weekend. You could weep 
from reading it. They reported that at 
least 10 members of county election 
boards in Georgia have been removed 
or are about to be removed in the wake 
of the new law passed by the GOP legis-
lature. These are the folks who are in 
charge of selecting ballot drop box lo-
cations. They pointed out an African- 
American woman who made sure that a 
poor area had a drop box every year to 
allow people to vote. They want to 
kick her off the board. No one knows 
why. We do know why. There is no real, 
legitimate reason why. According to 
the Times, who are they kicking off? 
At least five are people of color, most 
are Democrats, and they are all most 
likely to be replaced by Republicans. 
Please, my colleagues, read this arti-
cle. Read this article on how Repub-
lican States are expanding their power 
over elections, by Nick Corasaniti and 
Reid J. Epstein, June 19, 2021. Read it. 
Can you read this article and still be-
lieve what Republican legislatures are 
doing is on the level? Can you read this 
article and believe they are not trying 
to jaundice and bias voting from what 
has traditionally been a process that is 
free and open and fair in many places— 
in most places? Read it. Just read it. It 
makes you want to weep what they are 
doing. 
This nice lady, who just wanted to 
help her people vote in a fair and hon-
est way, gets kicked off the board or is 
getting kicked off the board. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent to have printed in the RECORD 
this full article from the New York 
Times dated June 19, 2021.

HOW REPUBLICAN STATES ARE EXPANDING 
THEIR POWER OVER ELECTIONS 
(By Nick Corasaniti and Reid J. Epstein) 
In Georgia, Republicans are removing 
Democrats of color from local boards. In Ar-
kansas, they have stripped election control 
from county authorities. And they are ex-
panding their election power in many other 
states. 
Lonnie Hollis has been a member of the 
Troup County election board in West Georgia 
since 2013. A Democrat and one of two Black 
women on the board, she has advocated Sun-
day voting, helped voters on Election Days 
and pushed for a new precinct location at a 
Black church in a nearby town. 
But this year, Ms. Hollis will be removed 
from the board, the result of a local election 
law signed by Gov. Brian Kemp, a Repub-
lican. Previously, election board members 
were selected by both political parties, coun-
ty commissioners and the three biggest mu-
nicipalities in Troup County. Now, the 
G.O.P.-controlled county commission has the 
sole authority to restructure the board and 
appoint all the new members. 
‘‘I speak out and I know the laws,’’ Ms. 
Hollis said in an interview. ‘‘The bottom line 
is they don’t like people that have some type

of intelligence and know what they’re doing, 
because they know they can’t influence 
them.’’ 
Ms. Hollis is not alone. Across Georgia, 
members of at least 10 county election 
boards have been removed, had their position 
eliminated or are likely to be kicked off 
through local ordinances or new laws passed 
by the state legislature. At least five are 
people of color and most are Democrats— 
though some are Republicans—and they will 
most likely all be replaced by Republicans. 
Ms. Hollis and local officials like her have 
been some of the earliest casualties as Re-
publican-led legislatures mount an expansive 
takeover of election administration in a raft 
of new voting bills this year. 
G.O.P. lawmakers have also stripped secre-
taries of state of their power, asserted more 
control over state election boards, made it 
easier to overturn election results, and pur-
sued several partisan audits and inspections 
of 2020 results. 
Republican state lawmakers have intro-
duced at least 216 bills in 41 states to give 
legislatures more power over elections offi-
cials, according to the States United Democ-
racy Center, a new bipartisan organization 
that aims to protect democratic norms. Of 
those, 24 have been enacted into law across 
14 states. 
G.O.P. lawmakers in Georgia say the new 
measures are meant to improve the perform-
ance of local boards, and reduce the influ-
ence of the political parties. But the laws 
allow Republicans to remove local officials 
they don’t like, and because several of them 
have been Black Democrats, voting rights 
groups fear that these are further attempts 
to disenfranchise voters of color. 
The maneuvers risk eroding some of the 
core checks that stood as a bulwark against 
former President Donald J. Trump as he 
sought to subvert the 2020 election results. 
Had these bills been in place during the 
aftermath of the election, Democrats say, 
they would have significantly added to the 
turmoil Mr. Trump and his allies wrought by 
trying to overturn the outcome. They worry 
that proponents of Mr. Trump’s conspiracy 
theories will soon have much greater control 
over the levers of the American elections 
system. 
‘‘It’s a thinly veiled attempt to wrest con-
trol from officials who oversaw one of the 
most secure elections in our history and put 
it in the hands of bad actors,’’ said Jena 
Griswold, the chairwoman of the Democratic 
Association of Secretaries of State and the 
current Colorado secretary of state. ‘‘The 
risk is the destruction of democracy.’’ 
Officials like Ms. Hollis are responsible for 
decisions like selecting drop box and pre-
cinct locations, sending out voter notices, 
establishing early voting hours and certi-
fying elections. But the new laws are tar-
geting high-level state officials as well, in 
particular secretaries of state—both Repub-
lican and Democratic—who stood up to Mr. 
Trump and his allies last year. 
Republicans in Arizona have introduced a 
bill that would largely strip Katie Hobbs, the 
Democratic secretary of state, of her author-
ity over election lawsuits, and then expire 
when she leaves office. And they have intro-
duced another bill that would give the Legis-
lature more power over setting the guide-
lines for election administration, a major 
task currently carried out by the secretary 
of state. 
Under Georgia’s new voting law, Repub-
licans significantly weakened the secretary 
of state’s office after Brad Raffensperger, a 
Republican who is the current secretary, 
rebuffed Mr. Trump’s demands to ‘‘find’’ 
votes. They removed the secretary of state 
as the chair of the state election board and 
relieved the office of its voting authority on 
the board. 
Kansas Republicans in May overrode a veto 
from Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat, to enact 
laws stripping the governor of the power to 
modify election laws and prohibiting the sec-
retary of state, a Republican who repeatedly 
vouched for the security of voting by mail, 
from settling election-related lawsuits with-
out the Legislature’s consent. 
And more Republicans who cling to Mr. 
Trump’s election lies are running for sec-
retary of state, putting a critical office with-
in reach of conspiracy theorists. In Georgia, 
Representative Jody Hice, a Republican who 
voted against certifying President Biden’s 
victory, 
is 
running 
against 
Mr. 
Raffensperger. Republican candidates with 
similar views are running for secretary of 
state in Nevada, Arizona and Michigan. 
‘‘In virtually every state, every election 
administrator is going to feel like they’re 
under the magnifying glass,’’ said Victoria 
Bassetti, a senior adviser to the States 
United Democracy Center. 
More immediately, it is local election offi-
cials at the county and municipal level who 
are being either removed or stripped of their 
power. 
In Arkansas, Republicans were stung last 
year when Jim Sorvillo, a three-term state 
representative from Little Rock, lost re-elec-
tion by 24 votes to Ashley Hudson, a Demo-
crat and local lawyer. Elections officials in 
Pulaski County, which includes Little Rock, 
were later found to have accidentally tab-
ulated 327 absentee ballots during the vote- 
counting process, 27 of which came from the 
district. 
Mr. Sorvillo filed multiple lawsuits aiming 
to stop Ms. Hudson from being seated, and 
all were rejected. The Republican caucus 
considered refusing to seat Ms. Hudson, then 
ultimately voted to accept her. 
But last month, Arkansas Republicans 
wrote new legislation that allows a state 
board of election commissioners—composed 
of six Republicans and one Democrat—to in-
vestigate and ‘‘institute corrective action’’ 
on a wide variety of issues at every stage of 
the voting process, from registration to the 
casting and counting of ballots to the certifi-
cation of elections. The law applies to all 
counties, but it is widely believed to be 
aimed at Pulaski, one of the few in the state 
that favor Democrats. 
The author of the legislation, State Rep-
resentative Mark Lowery, a Republican from 
a suburb of Little Rock, said it was nec-
essary to remove election power from the 
local authorities, who in Pulaski County are 
Democrats, because otherwise Republicans 
could not get a fair shake. 
‘‘Without this legislation, the only entity 
you could have referred impropriety to is the 
prosecuting attorney, who is a Democrat, 
and possibly not had anything done,’’ Mr. 
Lowery said in an interview. ‘‘This gives an-
other level of investigative authority to a 
board that is commissioned by the state to 
oversee elections.’’ 
Asked about last year’s election, Mr. Low-
ery said, ‘‘I do believe Donald Trump was 
elected president.’’ 
A separate new Arkansas law allows a 
state board to ‘‘take over and conduct elec-
tions’’ in a county if a committee of the leg-
islature determines that there are questions 
about the ‘‘appearance of an equal, free and 
impartial election.’’ 
In Georgia, the legislature passed a unique 
law for some counties. For Troup County, 
State Representative Randy Nix, a Repub-
lican, said he had introduced the bill that re-
structured the county election board—and 
will remove Ms. Hollis—only after it was re-
quested by county commissioners. He said he 
was not worried that the commission, a par-
tisan body with four Republicans and one 
Democrat, could exert influence over elec-
tions. 
‘‘The commissioners are all elected offi-
cials and will face the voters to answer for 
their actions,’’ Mr. Nix said in an email. 
Eric Mosley, the county manager for Troup 
County, which Mr. Trump carried by 22 
points, said that the decision to ask Mr. Nix 
for the bill was meant to make the board 
more bipartisan. It was unanimously sup-
ported by the commission. 
‘‘We felt that removing both the Repub-
lican and Democratic representation and 
just truly choose members of the community 
that invest hard to serve those community 
members was the true intent of the board,’’ 
Mr. Mosley said. ‘‘Our goal is to create both 
political and racial diversity on the board.’’ 
In Morgan County, east of Atlanta, Helen 
Butler has been one of the state’s most 
prominent Democratic voices on voting 
rights and election administration. A mem-
ber of the county board of elections in a 
rural, Republican county, she also runs the 
Georgia Coalition for the People’s Agenda, a 
group dedicated to protecting the voting 
rights of Black Americans and increasing 
their civic engagement. 
But Ms. Butler will be removed from the 
county board at the end of the month, after 
Mr. Kemp signed a local bill that ended the 
ability of political parties to appoint mem-
bers. 
‘‘I think it’s all a part of the ploy for the 
takeover of local boards of elections that the 
state legislature has put in place,’’ Ms. But-
ler said. ‘‘It is them saying that they have 
the right to say whether an election official 
is doing it right, when in fact they don’t 
work in the day to day and don’t understand 
the process themselves.’’ 
It’s not just Democrats who are being re-
moved. In DeKalb County, the state’s fourth- 
largest, Republicans chose not to renominate 
Baoky Vu to the election board after more 
than 12 years in the position. Mr. Vu, a Re-
publican, had joined with Democrats in a let-
ter opposing an election-related bill that 
eventually failed to pass. 
To replace Mr. Vu, Republicans nominated 
Paul Maner, a well-known local conservative 
with a history of false statements, including 
an insinuation that the son of a Georgia con-
gresswoman was killed in ‘‘a drug deal gone 
bad.’’ 
Back in LaGrange, Ms. Hollis is trying to 
do as much as she can in the time she has 
left on the board. The extra precinct in near-
by Hogansville, where the population is 
roughly 50 percent Black, is a top priority. 
While its population is only about 3,000, the 
town is bifurcated by a rail line, and Ms. 
Hollis said that sometimes it can take an ex-
ceedingly long time for a line of freight cars 
to clear, which is problematic on Election 
Days. 
‘‘We’ve been working on this for over a 
year,’’ Ms. Hollis said, saying Republicans 
had thrown up procedural hurdles to block 
the process. But she was undeterred. 
‘‘I’m not going to sit there and wait for 
you to tell me what it is that I should do for 
the voters there,’’ she said. ‘‘I’m going to do 
the right thing.’’ 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
my Republican friends are fond of say-
ing that they just want to make it 
easier to vote and harder to cheat in an 
election. But when you look at what 
they are actually doing, it is spectacu-
larly obvious that Republicans are 
making it harder to vote and easier to 
steal an election. The Big Lie that 
started with Donald Trump is infecting 
them—infecting them. Lies don’t mat-
ter, and they don’t matter when it 
comes to the sacred process of elec-
tions—free, open, fair elections where 
everyone has an opportunity to vote.

June 21, 2021 
Do my colleagues forget? Remember 
what Donald Trump did? Was he inter-
ested in a free, open, fair election? 
Donald Trump tried to pressure local 
officials to overturn a democratic elec-
tion in America. It was a stress test on 
our democracy unlike any in recent 
history, but our institutions held. So 
now what do Republicans want to do? 
Change the results. Change the elec-
tion officials. 
Again, Trump tried to pressure local 
officials to overturn democratic elec-
tions in a huge stress test on our de-
mocracy. Our institutions held. Local 
officials certified election results. The 
courts rejected spurious claims of 
fraud. Vice President Pence, no less, 
opened 
the 
proper 
envelopes. 
The 
House and Senate came together to 
count the results of the electoral col-
lege in the immediate aftermath of an 
armed insurrection. 
Now—now—because 
they 
couldn’t 
win the election and our institutions, 
our 
democratic—small 
‘‘d,’’ 
demo-
cratic—institutions held, they want to 
change who is running the elections to 
be partisan and biased. Republican 
State legislatures are actively remov-
ing many of the barriers that pre-
vented Donald Trump from subverting 
our elections. Shame. Shame. Shame. 
I lay all this information at the feet 
of my Republican colleagues: a sweep-
ing effort to disenfranchise millions of 
voters, mostly Black and Brown stu-
dents, the working poor; an attack on 
the checks that held our democracy to-
gether in the face of Donald Trump’s 
assaults. Many of us wondered: Will 
these institutions hold? Would Trump- 
appointed judges tell the Trump law-
yers that they were full of bunk and 
there wasn’t fraud? They did. It was a 
glorious moment for our democracy, 
and the Republican majority here in 
the Senate wants to undo it and 
doesn’t even want to debate it. 
We can argue what should be done to 
protect voting rights and safeguard our 
democracy, but don’t you think we 
should be able to debate the issue? The 
vote tomorrow is on, to my people 
watching. It is called a motion to pro-
ceed. It is how we get bills on the floor 
of the Senate. It needs 60 votes to be 
able to be debated. Will our Repub-
licans let us debate it? That is the only 
question on the table for the U.S. Sen-
ate tomorrow, and we are about to find 
out how my Republican colleagues will 
answer that question. 
I yield the floor.

AFGHANISTAN 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
later this week, President Biden will 
meet with leaders of the Afghanistan 
civilian 
democratic 
government. 
It 
doesn’t take an administrative leak to 
know what will be on the agenda. 
President 
Ghani 
and 
Chairman 
Abdullah Abdullah will arrive in Wash-
ington as a grave situation in their 
country rapidly deteriorates. 
The 
strategic 
and 
moral 
con-
sequences of President Biden’s decision 
to abandon Afghanistan are already 
coming painfully into focus. Without 
air cover and with reduced support 
from the U.S.-led coalition, our Afghan 
partners are struggling to hold back 
the Taliban onslaught. 
In just the 2 months since the Presi-
dent’s announcement, extremist mili-
tants have retaken control of at least 
30—30—of Afghanistan’s administrative 
districts. Reports from the ground indi-
cate that their heavy-handed, medieval 
rule is already creating new night-
mares, especially for Afghan women 
and girls. And just last week, more 
than 20 of the elite, U.S.-trained spe-
cial forces, who represent the country’s 
best hope of resistance, were literally 
slaughtered in a Taliban raid. So it is 
getting harder and harder to believe 
that ‘‘over-the-horizon’’ support will be 
enough to help our Afghan partners 
sustain the fight against these ter-
rorist threats. It is already clear it 
would intensify challenges to our own 
national security. 
This spring, the intelligence commu-
nity warned that the Taliban was 
‘‘likely to make gains on the battle-
field.’’ As the Director of the CIA put 
it, ‘‘ability to collect and act on 
threats will diminish.’’ Now senior de-
fense officials are portraying follow-on 
threats like the resurgence of al-Qaida 
as not a matter of if but when. 
Last week, the Secretary of Defense 
and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs 
acknowledged that al-Qaida still seeks 
to directly threaten the United States 
and that it could have the necessary 
capabilities to do so in 2 years—or even 
less in the case of a Taliban victory in 
Kabul. 
They want to know how we plan to 
support their defensive campaign with-
out the air support that literally saves 
soldiers’ lives. They want to know how 
we plan to contribute to urgent coun-
terterrorism missions without a robust 
system for collecting intelligence on 
the ground. And if President Biden is 
unwilling to reverse course, they want 
to know who will help protect their fel-
low citizens forced to flee by the 
Taliban’s conquest. 
The State Department is not pre-
pared to efficiently process visa claims 
from the many Afghans who have 
worked closely with our personnel, let 
alone the massive flows of refugees al-
ready on the move. Where are the 
friends of America to turn? Where will 
they turn? 
It is time for President Biden to ac-
knowledge the consequences of his de-
cision: that a refugee crisis in Afghani-
stan will mean senseless suffering; that 
the collapse of the Afghan state will 
mean a security and economic crisis 
across the region, a crisis America and 
its partners will simply be unable to ig-
nore; that the fallout of our retreat 
will draw attention and resources away 
from even greater strategic threats 
from Russia and China; and that every 
bit of it would have been avoidable, to-
tally avoidable. 
f 
FOR THE PEOPLE ACT OF 2021 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Now, 
Madam 
President, on another matter, as I have 
noted before, Senate Democrats en-
tered June with an agenda that was de-
signed to fail. Our Democratic leader 
planned votes on a host of the left’s 
most radical priorities. None of it was 
ever intended to clear the Senate’s ap-
propriately high bar for advancing leg-
islation. Instead, the failure of their 
partisan agenda was meant to show 
somehow—somehow—that the Senate 
itself was failing. 
For months, our colleagues built an-
ticipation for the failure. They even 
started previewing the latest argument 
they have made when it happened. Ap-
parently, the same Senate rule a 
Democratic minority had used with 
abandon was now somehow a racist 
relic to be abandoned by a Democratic 
majority. 
In the end, one particular radical 
proposal took priority. S. 1 is the same 
bad bill it has been since the House in-
troduced its version back in 2019 with 
the same nakedly partisan motives. 
But ever since Democrats got the elec-
tion outcome they wanted last fall, we 
have watched our colleagues actually 
update the rationale for their latest 
partisan power grab: States must be 
stopped from exercising control over 
their own election laws. 
The arguments here have one big 
thing in common with the ones our col-
leagues have deployed against the fili-
buster: debunked claims of racism. 
Remember, 
the 
last 
Presidential 
election saw the highest voter turnout 
in decades, even amidst a once-in-a- 
century pandemic, and African-Amer-
ican turnout was twice as high in Mis-
sissippi as it was in Massachusetts. But 
when Georgia passed targeted updates 
to its election laws based on lessons 
learned during the pandemic-era elec-
tions, Democrats trashed the bill as a 
‘‘redux of Jim Crow.’’ They misrepre-
sented its contents so wildly that even 
left-leaning ‘‘fact-checks’’ repeatedly 
debunked these claims. But by then, 
the train of disinformation had left the 
station. Pretty soon, any State that 
dared to deviate from unique, pan-
demic-era procedures faced summary 
judgment in the court of liberal out-
rage. It hasn’t seemed to matter that 
the facts tell a different story. 
The bill that led Texas Democrats to 
exercise the rights of a legislative mi-
nority last month requires more coun-
ties to adhere to new minimum hours 
for early voting. The Oklahoma bill 
that expanded early voting for general 
elections was passed by a Republican 
legislature and signed by a Republican 
Governor. In my State of Kentucky, 
the expansion of both online registra-
tion and early voting this spring passed

on a bipartisan basis, and a Democratic 
Governor signed it. 
Democrats have continued to insist 
that S. 1 is a response to these State 
laws, but we know it actually predates 
them. And we are starting to see that 
our colleagues’ latest rationale for S. 1 
can be flexible when needed. Prominent 
Democrats have railed against voter ID 
requirements for years, but now that 
voter ID is among the sticking points 
keeping the Democratic caucus from 
uniting behind S. 1, some Democrats 
have started indicating, well, they 
have had a change of heart. Now, I 
would 
commend 
them 
for 
coming 
around to commonsense positions on 
that issue that 80 percent of Americans 
already support. But one supposed 
compromise, among some Democrats, 
bears more than a passing resemblance 
to the partisan power grab their party 
has touted for years. It even introduces 
its own disastrous new liabilities, like 
a proposal to automate redistricting 
that is certainly constitutionally dubi-
ous. 
At the end of the day, Madam Presi-
dent, which concocted crisis Democrats 
choose as justification for their top 
legislative priority actually doesn’t 
make much difference. They have made 
abundantly clear that the real driving 
force behind S. 1 is a desire to rig the 
rules of American elections perma-
nently—permanently—in 
the 
Demo-
crats’ favor. That is why the Senate 
will give this disastrous proposal no 
quarter.

Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, it 
was October of 2002. I remember the 
day when in the Senate we decided to 
vote on the question as to whether or 
not we would authorize President Bush 
to use military force in Afghanistan. 
We considered the issue of Iraq before. 
Twenty-three of us had voted against 
giving that authority to President 
Bush. 
When it came to Afghanistan, the ar-
gument was different. The argument 
was that those responsible for 9/11, for 
killing 3,000 innocent Americans, were 
hiding out in Afghanistan, and if we 
didn’t ferret them out of their hiding 
place and hold them accountable, what 
kind of nation would we be? I bought 
that argument. Virtually every Mem-
ber of Congress agreed, with one excep-
tion—Congresswoman BARBARA LEE of 
California. But we voted to use mili-
tary force in Afghanistan under ex-
traordinary circumstances in 2002. 
Now, I listened to the Republican 
leader come to the floor and accuse 
President Biden of abandoning Afghan-
istan, retreating from Afghanistan. 
And he leaves out some salient facts. 
The negotiation with the Taliban, 
which 
was 
initiated 
by 
President 
Trump, was a negotiation to determine 
who would be in power, what areas 
they would hold, and when the United 
States would leave. It was President 
Trump who initiated that negotiation, 
not President Biden. President Biden, 
when he took office, followed through 
with it. I applauded him for doing so. 
I realize—and I think everyone does— 
that the situation in Afghanistan is 
perilous, but I think that we ought to 
acknowledge the obvious. After the 
longest war in the history of the 
United States, after losing over a thou-
sand American lives and tens of thou-
sands wounded, after spending trillions 
of dollars, we were not winning in Af-
ghanistan. We didn’t have a winning 
hand or a winning strategy. The 
Taliban was still a viable political 
force, and the Afghan security forces 
many times were overwhelmed by that 
Taliban force. 
I wonder why the Republican leader 
from Kentucky doesn’t do the obvious. 
He has the authority, under the rules 
of the Senate, to introduce a measure 
authorizing the use of military force in 
Afghanistan. If he believes we should 
stay or send more troops there, that is 
his right. He can offer that on the floor 
of the Senate, instead of lamenting 
what has happened there. He has the 
authority. If he thinks we have aban-
doned the Afghan people and should go 
back into that country, why doesn’t he 
offer an authorization for use of mili-
tary force? 
I think we know the answer. There is 
little or no support on his side of the 
aisle, nor on this side of the aisle, to 
make the longest war in American his-
tory even longer. Yes, we should be a 
viable force to try to make certain the 
Afghan people have a fighting chance. 
But after almost 20 years at it, I think 
we have shown that our strategy was 
not the winning strategy. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Madam President, on a different sub-
ject, as our Nation continues to emerge 
from COVID–19 restrictions, vaccinated 
Americans were able to gather safely 
this past weekend for two happy 
events: Father’s Day and the first 
Juneteenth 
Federal 
holiday. 
These 
celebrations came at the end of a week 
that brought welcome news to Amer-
ica. 
After 11 years of Republicans fighting 
the Affordable Care Act, the Supreme 
Court finally said: Enough. Millions of 
Americans have health insurance at a 
time when they desperately need it, in 
the midst of a pandemic, and your 
theories on Constitution and law are 
not adequate to end the Affordable 
Care Act. Thank goodness for that 7–2 
ruling. 
The administration, of course, was 
heartened by that and by the knowl-
edge that we are fast approaching the 
point where 70 percent of the adults in 
America are going to be vaccinated. 
Remember 
when 
President 
Biden 
took office 6 months ago? Yes, we had 
the vaccines, but we hadn’t produced 
them in quantity, and we didn’t have a 
plan for vaccinating America. Thank 
goodness, now the United States is 
leading the world in the effort to vac-
cinate its population. I thank Presi-
dent Biden for that and the resources 
that we provided to him. 
We still have a challenge. We still 
have a threat. The Delta variant is 
much more easily spread than the 
COVID strain that shut down the Na-
tion last year. It has now been identi-
fied in 41 States. For those who are 
holding back and not seeking a vac-
cination, they are in greater danger 
than they were a year ago if that infec-
tion comes near them. I hope my Re-
publican colleagues will join the Demo-
crats in urging Americans to be vac-
cinated as quickly as possible. 
WAR ON DRUGS 
On a different topic, Madam Presi-
dent, last week marked the 50-year an-
niversary of President Nixon’s declara-
tion of a War on Drugs. Today, Amer-
ica imprisons a greater share of its 
population than any nation on Earth. 
Drugs are cheaper and more easily 
available than ever, and substance 
abuse is destroying more American 
families than ever. The greatest harm 
has fallen on our most vulnerable citi-
zens, particularly low-income Ameri-
cans and communities of color. 
During the first four decades of the 
Nixon War on Drugs, America’s Federal 
prison population grew by 700 percent, 
and the cost of operating Federal pris-
ons exploded by 1,100 percent. Today, 
nearly half the people in Federal pris-
ons are locked up due to drug-related 
charges. We are learning the hard way 
that we can’t jail our way out of a pub-
lic health crisis. 
In recent years, the Senate has come 
together on a significant bipartisan 
basis to correct some of the gravest 
mistakes on the War on Drugs. I am 
grateful to my friend, the ranking Re-
publican member on the Judiciary 
Committee, Senator CHUCK GRASSLEY, 
for his leadership in this effort. We 
forged a bipartisan partnership that 
ended up sending the First Step Act, a 
reform effort, to President Bush to sign 
into law—pardon me—sent to President 
Trump to sign into law. 
Tomorrow, 
the 
Senate 
Judiciary 
Committee will hold a hearing on an-
other crucial piece of reform: Elimi-
nating the disparate treatment of

crimes involving crack and powder co-
caine in Federal sentencing laws. Con-
gress established this disparity in the 
1980s, based on fear and mistaken illu-
sions of science. 
We reduced the disparity with the 
Fair Sentencing Act, but we didn’t 
eliminate it. Today a person arrested 
for 28 grams of crack will receive the 
same sentence as a person with 500 
grams of cocaine powder, even though 
it is exactly the same drug. 
This lingering disparity made racial 
inequities in our criminal justice sys-
tem even worse, undermined faith in 
the integrity of our justice system, 
and, worst of all, failed to even curb 
drug addiction in America—talk about 
three strikes. We should eliminate the 
disparity once and for all, and there 
will be a hearing tomorrow. 
FOR THE PEOPLE ACT OF 2021 
On another matter, Madam Presi-
dent, tomorrow our democracy will 
face one of its greatest tests in the 
Senate. On January 7, at close to 4 
o’clock in the morning, this Senate 
voted to confirm the electoral victory 
of Joe Biden to be the next President of 
the United States, but we all know 
what happened before that vote. An 
angry, self-pitying man who would not 
accept defeat, we now know, schemed 
for weeks about how to overturn the 
election and continue his Presidency. 
When Donald Trump’s efforts failed 
and democracy prevailed, he begged a 
mob to come to Washington and deliver 
him from reality. You have seen the 
videos, the films—the President stand-
ing with the White House in a back-
ground, railing to this crowd about an 
election that was ‘‘stolen,’’ urging 
them to come to Capitol Hill and make 
a difference. He demanded that they 
come and ‘‘stop the steal,’’ and then he 
turned that mob on the Capitol of the 
United States. Those of us who were 
here that day will never forget it. 
The outrageous insurrection that fol-
lowed was the worst attack on this 
building and the most prolonged siege 
of the Capitol since the British at-
tacked our Capitol in the War of 1812. 
Five people died, and more than 140 po-
lice officers were injured. It could have 
been worse. Senator LINDSEY GRAHAM, 
Republican of South Carolina, was 
right when he said the day after the at-
tack that that mob ‘‘could have killed 
us all.’’ 
The assault on the Capitol left our 
Nation shaken and the world in dis-
belief that it could happen in America. 
But it was not what one group of Wash-
ington power peddlers worried about 
most when they gathered on a con-
ference call 2 days later. These Wash-
ington insiders scheduled a private 
conference call just 2 days after this 
attack on the Capitol. They were 
scrambling to come up with a plan to 
kill a democracy reform bill. The call 
was organized by the Koch brothers. 
Among the participants was a key 
member of Senator MCCONNELL’s staff. 
A recording of the conference call 
found its way to Jane Mayer, an inves-
tigative reporter for The New Yorker 
magazine, who wrote about it. Accord-
ing to Ms. Mayer’s reporting, the rea-
son the political insiders and special 
interests in that call were frightened 
was because they couldn’t find a way 
to beat S. 1. 
The Koch brothers group poll-tested 
criticisms of the bill, and none worked. 
It wasn’t just the Democrats who liked 
the reforms in that bill. It turned out 
the Republicans liked them, too. Ac-
cording to a Koch representative who 
hosted the meeting, ‘‘There’s a large— 
very large—chunk of conservatives who 
are supportive of these types of re-
forms.’’ Surprise, surprise. 
What is a poor political insider to do 
when you can’t manufacture a reason 
to vote against a bill? There is only 
one way to stop it, and it is what the 
people in the meeting referred to as 
‘‘under the dome strategies’’ to stop 
this electoral reform bill. Do you know 
what that is? That is the filibuster— 
the ‘‘killibuster’’—that Senate proce-
dure which requires 60 votes. They 
knew they couldn’t win a majority, but 
they knew it was tough to come up 
with 60 votes in favor. And that is what 
I am afraid we are going to see tomor-
row. I hope not. 
Last night, I watched with many 
Americans as the movie ‘‘Selma’’ was 
televised. It reminded us of what hap-
pened in the 1960s when people like my 
personal friend and hero to many of us, 
John 
Lewis, 
marched 
across 
that 
bridge in Selma, AL, trying to speak 
up for what? Voting rights for African 
Americans. He was beaten and bloodied 
and almost died in the process, but 
they mustered the strength to come 
back again and to resume the march. 
And they prevailed. In passing the Vot-
ing Rights Act, which gave a fighting 
chance for African Americans and 
other people to be able to vote in the 
future of America. 
This still is a challenge for us today. 
Why? I don’t know. We have seen, in 
the recent past, six or seven Repub-
licans publicly break with Donald 
Trump in some of his more outrageous 
positions, and yet they have been 
strangely silent on that side of the 
aisle when it comes to what is hap-
pening in States across the Nation 
where we have measures taking place 
that will limit the right of people to 
vote. 
What is wrong with this picture? Is 
democracy not at its strongest point 
when more people are participating? 
And yet Republican legislatures write 
bill after bill to limit those who can 
vote in the future. 
Madam President, I want to say a 
word or two about my colleague Sen-
ator JOE MANCHIN. I want to thank him 
for his determined efforts to find a 
compromise on the bill that is coming 
before us. Senator MANCHIN spoke to 
everyone in sight—Republicans, Demo-
crats, Independents, liberals, and con-
servatives—and he listened. The com-
promise he proposed is not inclusive of 
everything I would like to see in the 
bill, but the reality is that it would be 
an improvement. It would help address 
the dangerous, all-out assault on vot-
ing rights that is taking place in all 
these States that I mentioned. It could 
help put Jim Crow back in the grave, 
where he belongs. And it deserves the 
support of the Senate. 
My last word before I close. I had the 
honor of serving with Senator Robert 
Byrd. He used to sit back here. He once 
told me, in his illustrious Senate ca-
reer, the things he was embarrassed by 
the most. He talked about deregulation 
of airlines, which took the planes out 
of his State of West Virginia. He talked 
about a nominee for the Eisenhower 
Cabinet who was rejected because he 
was Jewish. He told me he was wrong 
in the way he voted on those measures. 
But he said: Mr. DURBIN, more than 
anything, I was wrong on civil rights. 
Madam President, this past Saturday 
was not only Juneteenth, it was the 
57th anniversary of the Senate’s pas-
sage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It 
had been filibustered for 2 months be-
fore it passed. Opposition to the bill 
wasn’t divided along party lines. I will 
be honest. My party, the Democratic 
Party, particularly southern members 
of the party, was leading the fight 
against it. 
On June 8, 1964, one of the most con-
servative Democrats stood on the floor 
with an 800-page speech filled with all 
kinds of reasoning about why civil 
rights was unnecessary and an in-
fringement on States’ rights—an echo 
of a speech we just heard on the Senate 
floor. That Senator’s name was Robert 
C. Byrd. He spoke on this floor for 14 
hours and 13 minutes. When he fin-
ished, the majority leader called the 
roll, and 71 Senators voted to end the 
filibuster—4 more than were needed. 
Ten days later, on Juneteenth 1964, the 
Senate passed the Civil Rights Act. On 
July 2, it passed the House and was 
signed by President Johnson. 
Robert C. Byrd would go on to serve 
for another 46 years in this Senate and 
become majority leader twice and the 
longest serving Senator in history. He 
later called his filibuster of the Civil 
Rights Act ‘‘the worst mistake of my 
life,’’ a decision which he told me per-
sonally he deeply regretted. He would 
change. He would begin to champion 
civil rights. 
When President George W. Bush 
signed the law extending voting rights 
in 2006, it was Robert C. Byrd by his 
side in the Oval Office, along with Ted 
Kennedy and John Lewis. 
When Robert Byrd died in 2010, John 
Lewis mourned him and called him an 
ally and ‘‘true statesman.’’ Yet, despite 
all the years that had passed and all 
the good he had accomplished, many 
articles on his death stated that he 
once stood against civil rights. 
If the last year has taught us any-
thing, it is that life is fragile. None of 
knows how long we have in this Senate 
or on this Earth. So I implore my col-
leagues who may be wrestling with how 
to vote tomorrow: This is a vote for

history. This is democracy on trial. 
Think about how you want to be re-
membered by your children’s children. 
If democracy is worth fighting for, 
even worth dying for, surely a democ-
racy reform bill is worthy of debate in 
the Senate. Allow the Senate to do its 
job and debate the For the People Act.

RECORD under ‘‘Statements on Intro-
duced Bills and Joint Resolutions.’’) 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
JUNETEENTH 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, last 
week, Congress notched another bipar-
tisan win for the American people. 
A bill I reintroduced earlier this 
year, along with Senator MARKEY from 
Massachusetts, was signed into law fi-
nally establishing Juneteenth as a na-
tional holiday. This bill was unani-
mously supported in the Senate and 
got an overwhelming vote in the House 
of Representatives. 
I was honored to be with President 
Biden at the White House when he 
signed it into law late last week. It was 
even more special to celebrate with my 
fellow Texans over the weekend. On 
Saturday, I was honored to spend the 
very first Juneteenth National Inde-
pendence Day in Galveston, where 
Major General Gordon Granger and his 
troops declared that all slaves were 
‘‘forever free.’’ 
This happened 21⁄2
years after the 
Emancipation 
Proclamation 
was 
signed and just a couple of months 
after hostilities between the North and 
the South had ended, but communica-
tion being what it is across the huge 
country, particularly at that time, it 
took 21⁄2 years for the message to get to 
the former slaves in Galveston, TX, 
where Juneteenth has been celebrated 
for many, many years. 
In my State alone, we celebrated 
Juneteenth for 40 years as a State holi-
day. I could not have been more happy 
to take a piece of history with me, a 
copy of the bipartisan bill that helped 
preserve the legacy of Juneteenth for 
generations to come. 
This is just one item in a significant 
list of bipartisan accomplishments we 
have made in an equally divided Sen-
ate, which we all know is no small 
thing. We passed legislation to con-
front the growing threats of China; to 
ensure more businesses can grab onto 
the lifeline of the Paycheck Protection 
Program, one of the most significant 
items of economic assistance that we 
were able to provide during the COVID– 
19 virus; we provided States with addi-
tional 
resources 
to 
upgrade 
their 
drinking water and wastewater infra-
structure; and we passed legislation to 
combat hate crimes against Asian 
Americans. 
So the truth is, notwithstanding 
what it may look like in the news or on 
cable TV or on social media, every day, 
our colleagues here in the Senate con-
tinue to work across the aisle to find 
consensus and to craft legislation with 
bipartisan support where we can. I tell 
people that legislation is hard to pass 
by design, and our current rules re-
quire us to do the hard work of actu-
ally building consensus on a bipartisan 
basis before we can pass legislation, 
particularly in the Senate. 
We continue to do our work in other 
important areas like infrastructure, 
which has been the subject of so much 
attention and debate; to do police re-
form; to deal with the high price of pre-
scription 
drugs. 
Republicans 
and 
Democrats continue to work together 
to address some of our most urgent 
problems. 
This week, unfortunately, the major-
ity leader, the Senator from New York, 
has decided to take another tack. He 
has chosen to spend the Senate’s time 
on partisan legislation that simply has 
no chance of becoming law. That is his 
choice. He gets to set the agenda, and 
our only role is to show up, debate the 
bill, and cast our ballot. 
Our 
Democratic 
colleagues 
have 
given the marquee treatment, a bill 
known as S. 1, with the symbolic num-
bering of the bill as the first, meaning 
the most important bill in their agen-
da. But rather than a bipartisan bill 
that will be good for the entire coun-
try, not just one political party or the 
other, the majority leader has chosen 
to tee up this massive Federal election 
takeover bill. 
This legislation first popped in 2019, 
when the newly elected Democratic 
majority in the House went on a mes-
saging bill spree. A messaging bill is 
one that you really know will never be-
come law, but it sends a message. Over 
the last 2 years, they tried out a range 
of different marketing strategies. That 
is really all it is. It is not about pass-
ing legislation. It is about sending a 
message, trying to gain partisan polit-
ical advantage. 
They tried a range of marketing 
strategies to convince the American 
people that this overhaul to our elec-
tion system is necessary. At one point, 
it was a matter of election security, 
then of voter confidence, then a way to 
remove obstacles that prevented people 
of color from voting. 
Well, I have some news for them. In 
2020, we saw a record election turnout. 
Two-thirds of all eligible voters cast a 
ballot. That was the highest turnout in 
120 years. It wasn’t confined to any sin-
gle racial or ethnic group; it was across 
the board. We saw African-American 
voter participation at virtually an all-
time high—the same with Hispanics 
and every other ethnic and racial 
group. 
Notwithstanding the facts that peo-
ple are turning out to vote in historic 
numbers, they had to come up with a 
new sales pitch. They had to attack the 
efforts in the States to pass their own 
election laws, which handle the time 
and manner in which State elections 
are run. And, to me, the consistent 
theme was making it easier to vote and 
harder to cheat. To me, that is the sim-
ple message I think we ought to be 
sending when it comes to our election 
laws. That is what our colleagues 
latched onto. 
But over the last few months, they 
twisted and turned and manipulated 
the facts beyond any recognition. They 
tried to frame new State voting laws as 
the impetus or the reason justifying 
this massive Federal takeover—uncon-
stitutional, in my view—takeover of 
State voting laws. They painted an 
alarming picture of the assault on 
voter access. 
But if you actually take time to look 
at these so-called restrictions in vot-
ing, you will find they are more gen-
erous than the current law in many 
Democratic-controlled States. There is 
no better example than the Georgia 
law, which came under national scru-
tiny for enacting reforms that would 
give Georgia voters more time to vote 
than voters in a number of blue States. 
Here are the facts. In Georgia, the 
law that people claimed was racist and 
designed to prevent people of color 
from casting their ballot during the 
early voting season before in-day— 
election-day voting—the new Georgia 
law provides 17 days for in-person early 
voting. 
How 
about 
Massachusetts, 
which is currently represented by two 
Democratic Senators? Well, Massachu-
setts provides 11 days. Delaware, rep-
resented by two Democrats and the 
home State of our President, provides 
10 days of early voting. New Jersey, 
also represented by two Democratic 
Senators, provides 9 days, almost half 
of what Georgia has provided for in its 
new election laws. 
But what you heard across the news 
media, cable TVs, social media, and the 
like was that somehow, some way, 
Georgia had conspired to restrict the 
rights of African Americans and other 
minority voters from casting their bal-
lots. 
But the facts prove otherwise. This is 
the type of hypocrisy that we are see-
ing in this debate. As I said, New Jer-
sey recently passed a law—just re-
cently passed a law that expanded in- 
person voting to 9 days. Did anyone 
claim that this was somehow a Jim 
Crow relic or a racist act or violating 
the rights of African Americans and 
other minority voters? Of course not. 
Was New Jersey treated the same as 
Georgia was in the popular media, 
where it was suggested that somehow 
this was a racist effort to restrict mi-
nority access to voting? Of course not. 
But the New Jersey Governor took it 
a step further. He actually criticized

Georgia for what he called ‘‘restricting 
the rights of Georgians to vote,’’ but 
his own State provides half the oppor-
tunity that the new Georgia law does 
to cast your ballot. Obviously, this is a 
bunch of political talk and an attempt 
to try to intimidate Congress and the 
American people into this Federal 
takeover of the State election laws. 
We heard similar attack lines from a 
number of our Democratic colleagues 
who will falsely try to brand this law 
as a form of voter suppression, even 
though it is more generous than cur-
rent laws in a number of blue States. 
Here are some more facts. You heard 
a lot of talk about mail-in ballots. The 
Georgia law sets a deadline of 11 days 
before the election to request a mail-in 
ballot, but in the State of the majority 
leader, Senator SCHUMER—New York— 
voters only receive a week. So you 
have 7 days prior to the election to re-
quest a mail-in ballot in New York and 
11 days in Georgia. And for some rea-
son, our Democratic colleagues focus 
on Georgia and claim this is some sort 
of conspiracy to diminish and restrict 
minority voting, which is clearly false. 
In New York, you also have to have a 
reason for voting absentee, but in 
Georgia no excuse needs to be given. 
You can do so as a matter of right, 
even if you are going to be in town, 
even if you are otherwise able to vote. 
If you find it more convenient to cast 
your ballot by mail in Georgia, you can 
do so—but not in New York. 
If any State tries to enact policies 
that suppress the votes of minority 
voters, there is a law in place cur-
rently, section 2 of the Voting Rights 
Act, that gives the U.S. Government 
the right to sue that State or jurisdic-
tion and make sure that minority vot-
ers have equal access to the ballot. As 
a matter of fact, the Voting Rights Act 
has been one of the most successful 
laws ever passed by a Federal Congress. 
And the historic turnout I referred to a 
few moments ago, I think, is the best 
evidence 
of 
that. 
Minority 
voters 
across the country are voting in his-
torically high numbers, which, to me, 
is the best evidence that the Voting 
Rights Act is doing exactly what we 
had hoped it would do when we passed 
it and when we reauthorized it just a 
few short years ago. 
So, if this isn’t a solution to efforts 
to restrict minority voting, what ex-
actly is this bill that we will be voting 
on tomorrow, S. 1? The truth is it is a 
partisan solution to a problem that 
doesn’t exist. 
This law, if passed, S. 1, which we 
will vote on tomorrow, prevents States 
from requiring identification from vot-
ers to vote. In other words, you won’t 
have to show a driver’s license or some 
other means of identification in order 
to cast your ballot. Yet, on the Jimmy 
Carter, James Baker, III commission— 
I think it was in 2005—it recommended 
voter ID as one of the important ways 
to maintain the integrity of the ballot 
so that the voting officials would know 
you are who you say you are, and, in-
deed, you could check your name 
against the voter rolls to make sure 
you were legally authorized to cast a 
ballot. 
In Senator SCHUMER’s effort to pass 
S. 1, which we will vote on tomorrow, 
it prevents the States from asking for 
voter identification even when vir-
tually every State provides that identi-
fication card for free. If you don’t 
drive, they will provide you with a free 
card, and you can use an alternative 
means of identification, but not if Sen-
ator SCHUMER’s S. 1 bill were to pass. 
This bill, S. 1, would also tie the 
States’ hands when it comes to main-
taining accurate voter rolls. So, if peo-
ple have moved out of State or if voters 
have passed away, this law would tie 
the hands of the States to make sure 
those names would be removed from 
the voter rolls, which would make it 
more likely that fraudulent efforts to 
cast those ballots on behalf of voters 
who either didn’t exist or had moved 
out of State would be possible. 
S. 1 would tie the hands of the States 
from periodically purging dead voters 
from the voter rolls. This would also 
encourage something called ballot har-
vesting. Now, some States provide for 
ballot harvesting, but many, thank-
fully, do not. Ballot harvesting simply 
makes it possible for a partisan in a po-
litical campaign to go around and col-
lect ballots—maybe at nursing homes, 
maybe at shopping malls, maybe at 
other places—and then deliver those 
ballots to the voting clerk at the des-
ignated place and time. Yet you can 
imagine if the chain of custody of those 
ballots is not traced and tracked and 
monitored. Just think of the opportu-
nities that could provide for fraud. 
This bill would also alter the makeup 
of the bipartisan Federal Election 
Commission, so as to give the Demo-
cratic Party an advantage. Right now, 
there are equal numbers of Republicans 
and Democrats on the Federal Election 
Commission, and that is the way it 
should be. Yet this bill, S. 1, would give 
the Democrats a partisan advantage—a 
big mistake. 
Here is, maybe, the biggest insult to 
the taxpayer: Whether or not you sup-
port a particular political candidate or 
the platform that candidate runs on, 
you can be forced to contribute your 
tax dollars to that political candidate 
to help him run and win the election. 
This is the government funding—real-
ly, the taxpayer funding—of political 
campaigns. I believe it is a 2-to-6 ratio, 
if I am not mistaken. For every $2 that 
candidate raises, he gets $6 in taxpayer 
funding to run his campaign. That is 
your hard-earned money that you have 
paid in taxes that is being used to pro-
mote ideas and candidates whom you 
don’t support. 
I could go on and on, as the list of ab-
surdities is a long one, but our friend 
the senior Senator from California 
summed it up pretty well earlier this 
month. 
She said: 
If democracy were in jeopardy, I would 
want to protect it. But I don’t see it being in 
jeopardy right now. 
Madam President, there is no voter 
suppression crisis—certainly not a sys-
temic one. If there is a problem with 
suppressing minority votes, there is 
authority available under the Voting 
Rights Act for the Attorney General, 
appointed by Joe Biden and confirmed 
by this Senate, to be able to go after 
them. There is no widespread effort to 
stop voters from casting ballots, and 
there is no desire to hand the States’ 
constitutional authorities over to the 
Federal Government. 
Our Democratic colleagues are strug-
gling to accept this reality. They have 
spent the last several days working be-
hind the scenes to negotiate a com-
promise among themselves. There was 
never a question of whether or not this 
would be a bipartisan bill because of 
the overreach that I have just talked 
about. The question was whether or not 
the bipartisan opposition seen in the 
House would continue in the Senate. 
Even if the Democrats were to accept 
all of the changes that have been pro-
posed by Senator MANCHIN of West Vir-
ginia and that have been endorsed by 
Stacey Abrams, the rotten core of this 
bill would remain the same. This is a 
politically motivated, Federal take-
over of our elections, and it will not 
stand. The Constitution doesn’t give 
the Democratic Party or the Repub-
lican Party the power to govern how 
States run their elections. That is re-
served to the States by the Constitu-
tion of the United States of America. I 
will firmly oppose any effort to hand 
Texas’s constitutional rights to regu-
late and conduct its elections over to 
the Federal Government. 
The one-size-fits-all Federal mandate 
won’t improve public confidence in our 
elections. It will be seen for what it is 
in a transparent way, that being a par-
tisan, 
political 
takeover—a 
coup 
d’etat, really—of the way our elections 
are run. Elections should be run by the 
folks who are elected and who are ac-
countable to the States—and to my 
State of Texas—and certainly not by 
partisan, political actors with an agen-
da here in Washington, DC.

TALLAPOOSA COUNTY GIRLS RANCH 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Madam Presi-
dent, before I begin, I want to first 
take a moment and remember those 
that lost their lives in a horrific car ac-
cident in Butler County, AL, this past 
weekend. 
Ten people lost their lives. Nine of 
those were between the ages 9 months 
and 17 years old. A majority of those 
killed were in a Tallapoosa County 
Girls Ranch bus. The girls ranch is an 
organization that I have been involved 
with for 20 years. It handles young kids 
who have been abused, young kids who 
have no parents. They start at this 
ranch at most any age, and everything 
is paid for all the way through gradua-
tion of college. 
These kids were on a field trip com-
ing from Baldwin County, AL, this past 
weekend and were involved in this hor-
rific crash. There are no words that can 
bring comfort to these families or 
these children, but my family and my 
staff and the people of Alabama are 
praying for peace for all those affected 
during this unimaginable time. 
FOR THE PEOPLE ACT OF 2021 
Madam President, as I and others 
have noted, Democrats call their flag-
ship voting bill For the People Act, but 
a better and more fitting title is the 
‘‘Nancy Pelosi Power Grab Act.’’ 
My Republican colleagues have done 
a good job of highlighting the many 
flaws of this legislation in the last cou-
ple of weeks, including doing away 
with commonsense fraud protection 
like voter ID, forcing mandatory same- 
day registration on every State, allow-
ing paid political operatives to harvest 
voter ballots, and directing taxpayer 
dollars to the campaigns of progressive 
politicians. 
Sadly, 
there 
is 
plenty 
more. 
But let me also note that this recent 
‘‘compromise’’ is anything but. A com-
promise among Democrats should have 
been their starting offer to Repub-
licans, not their final offer. 
The most recent versions still run 
afoul of the Constitution by trampling 
on First Amendment rights of free 
speech and taking away redistricting 
from the States. While ID is still re-
quired to vote, the bill expands what 
kind of ID meets that requirement, 
such as a utility bill. But the last time 
I looked, there was not a photo on our 
utility bill. The most secure form of 
identification is a government-issued 
photo ID. States shouldn’t be forced to 
water that down. 
Americans want faith and trust in 
the integrity of their election process. 
This bill does not provide solutions to 
strengthen these processes, and once 
Americans learn what is in this bill, 
they will agree. 
The Pelosi power grab yanks power 
from the States. The Pelosi power grab 
lets politicians stuff their pockets with 
taxpayers’ dollars. And guess what, 
folks. A slightly different version of a 
Federal takeover of elections is still a 
Federal takeover of elections. That is 
exactly what this new version of S. 1 is. 
It is hard to even call this version of S. 
1 a compromise when the Democrats 
only compromise with Members of 
their own party. This was not a bipar-
tisan negotiation to get an end product 
that both sides of the aisle could sup-
port. The last time I checked, we still 
have a 50–50 Senate. There has been no 
negotiation with our side. 
But regardless of its form, this bill 
does not solve the problems currently 
facing our election system; it makes 
the problems worse. 
You know, in sports, one team chang-
ing the rules by themselves is called 
cheating. It is seen for what it is—a 
power grab. It is stacking the rules to 
win the game instead of doing the hard 
work necessary to get the job done. 
Folks may be scratching their heads 
as to why one political party thinks 
they can completely change the rules 
of elections all by themselves, but if 
you have been paying attention to 
what the progressives have been up to 
recently, it won’t come as a big sur-
prise. Changing our country as we 
know it is the end game. That is why 
they want to pass this Pelosi power 
grab—so those who disagree with them 
have a harder time winning at the bal-
lot box. 
But it is not just elections. Remem-
ber when they tried to hoodwink us 
with defund the police last year? Re-
member when they tried to walk that 
back? But they had made their position 
very clear. Now we are seeing the same 
thing with education, as critical race 
theory is pushed on school districts 
across the country. Simply put, crit-
ical race theory reinforces divisions on 
strict racial lines. It doesn’t teach kids 
moral values, like treating everyone 
with respect regardless of race; it is 
just the opposite. Critical race theory 
teaches kids to hate one another. That 
is one thing schools should abso-
lutely—absolutely—not 
be 
teaching. 
But, again, for Democrats, it is about 
changing the way we view our country.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4646 
June 21, 2021 
What we should be focusing on is ac-
tually improving education all over 
this country. The American people 
need to realize how far we have fallen 
behind. 
As columnist Mark Steyn wrote, 
‘‘Education is the biggest structural 
defect in our society. We have an al-
most entirely corrupt and abusive edu-
cation establishment.’’ 
Here is where that education estab-
lishment has gotten us: We are 37th in 
the world in math, 13th in reading, and 
18th in science. In 2019, only 35 percent 
of our fourth graders were able to read 
at the fourth-grade reading level—35 
percent. Embarrassing. That was lower 
than 2 years before, and it was before 
the teachers unions kept kids out of 
school all of this past year. You can 
imagine how it is today. It is unaccept-
able. It should be unacceptable to 
every Member of this body. 
We have got China outpacing us in 
every industry and at every level of our 
economy. But Democrats are too busy 
painting the United States as the 
world’s villain. How can we expect our 
young people to defend the United 
States abroad if they don’t learn about 
the things that make America the 
greatest country in the history of the 
world? 
We, as elected representatives of 
Americans across the country, should 
be doing everything—and I mean every-
thing—we can to create opportunity 
and to protect the freedoms that make 
this country great. It seems like folks 
across the aisle aren’t interested in 
that. They have a completely different 
vision of and for our country—one that 
most Americans don’t agree with at 
all. 
I bet if you ask folks back home if 
they want a bigger government and 
less State and local power, they would 
say no way. I bet if you asked them if 
a Federal power grab sounds like a 
good idea, they would say no. I bet if 
you ask them if they want their kids to 
learn to be more divided by race, they 
would also say no. They would tell you 
they want their freedoms protected. 
They would tell you they want the 
Federal Government out of the way. 
They want an education for children 
that provides opportunity because edu-
cation is the key to freedom and suc-
cess. Education can unlock every stu-
dent’s God-given potential, but critical 
race theory swallows that key. The 
Pelosi power grab just fills the lock 
with cement. 
Ladies and gentlemen, this For the 
People Act is one party’s attempt to 
rewrite the rules—rewrite the rules of 
the game in hope that they will get a 
permanent advantage, plain and sim-
ple. 
It is really a shame. We are spending 
so much time on bills that the Amer-
ican people don’t want, bills that don’t 
have bipartisan support. So I urge my 
colleagues to come together and find 
solutions that will unite us as Ameri-
cans, not divide us further as a coun-
try. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. HAGERTY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. HAGERTY. Madam President, I 
am here today to address Democrats’ 
deceptively labeled ‘‘For the People 
Act,’’ which should more accurately be 
labeled the ‘‘For the Politicians Act.’’ 
This legislation represents a breath-
taking, unprecedented power grab. In a 
50–50 Senate, this is a blatant attempt 
by those who are in power by the slim-
mest possible margin to take over and 
rewrite the election and campaign 
rules for all 50 States in one fell swoop. 
This would be done on an entirely 
partisan basis to ensure candidates 
from that same party win elections. In 
fact, while the only supporters of the 
bill are Democrats, there is bipartisan 
opposition to this legislation. 
This legislation would disenfranchise 
every American through the Federal 
seizure of the authority of each State’s 
representatives to set election rules for 
their State in accordance with the 
wishes of their citizens. 
This partisan legislation would wash 
away 
election 
integrity 
measures, 
making it easier to cheat. Each invalid 
vote cast dilutes the strength of each 
valid vote cast. 
Our form of government for the peo-
ple and by the people rests upon voters’ 
faith in the integrity of our elections. 
If we allow that faith in our elections 
to continue to be compromised, we are 
allowing the very foundation of our 
American system to be eroded. 
Democrats don’t want to talk about 
the details of this legislation. They 
don’t want you to peek under the hood. 
They want to just slap a voting rights 
bumper sticker on it, jam it through, 
and then disparage and name-call any-
one who opposes it. 
So let’s take a look at exactly what 
is in this legislation. 
Under this legislation, a Federal poli-
tician running for election can take 
millions in taxpayer money for his or 
her own campaign. 
The legislation says that States must 
then allow that politician to pay polit-
ical operatives to visit nursing homes, 
dormitories, emergency shelters, and 
other residences to collect thousands of 
ballots and, then, choose which ones to 
be dropped into unmanned drop boxes, 
maybe in the middle of the night. 
This bill would make it illegal for 
States to verify the identity of voters 
at the polls. Under this bill, ballots ar-
riving even a week after election day 
would still be counted. 
It would require States to adopt uni-
versal mail-in voting practices. States 
would be forced to allow murderers, 
rapists, and child molesters to vote, 
even if a State’s citizens have adopted 
laws to prevent it. 
It would require States to allow un-
registered voters to cast ballots by 
simply showing up on election day and 
signing a form, without an ID and with 
no vetting allowed. 
The 
bill 
would 
silence 
political 
speech by religious and nonprofit orga-
nizations while politicians can use tax-
payer dollars to air attack ads with 
which many Americans would find dis-
tasteful. 
The bill provides that if anyone dis-
putes any of this, that is OK. They can 
lodge their complaints with the Fed-
eral Election Commission, a body that 
has been bipartisan since its creation. 
But wait. In addition to changing the 
rules to benefit one team, the legisla-
tion also ‘‘buys off the umpire’’ by 
transforming the FEC into a partisan, 
Democrat-controlled body—a body that 
could hound the opposing party can-
didates to the ends of the Earth. This 
bill transforms the judge into the pros-
ecutor. 
I wish that was all this legislation 
did. It also snatches the responsibility 
for drawing Congressional 
districts 
from the elected representatives of all 
50 States, who have done that job for 
the last 230 years, and sets up a Byzan-
tine process that would ultimately 
hand it over to an academic consultant 
hired by a liberal judge right here in 
Washington. 
Let me repeat that: A consultant 
hired by a judge in Washington, DC, 
will be drawing every congressional 
district in the country. 
Using government power to seize con-
trol of elections, to limit speech, to 
pack tribunals, to ensure the ruling 
party stays in power—that sounds like 
a headline you would hear in Ven-
ezuela, Russia, Iran, or even China, not 
in the United States of America. 
Not too long ago, both parties would 
have considered this partisan power 
grab beyond the pale. But far-left 
operatives want permanent power, and 
Democrats, eager to keep the power for 
themselves, are afraid to tell them no. 
Democrats are now characterizing 
this legislation as an emergency re-
sponse to recent legislation in a few 
States. This legislation isn’t just a so-
lution in search of a problem; it is a 
power grab that for years has been in 
search of a crisis—any crisis, manufac-
tured or otherwise—that can be used to 
justify it. 
Democrat operatives introduced a 
previous version of this bill on January 
24, 2017, 4 days after President Trump 
took office. The purported crisis then 
was the American people’s election of 
Donald Trump, which the Democrats 
found unacceptable. They continued 
this effort by introducing yet another 
version of the ‘‘For the Politicians 
Act’’ in 2019, which at that time passed 
the House without a single Republican 
vote. Like the bill the Senate will con-
sider this week, this bill was a Demo-
crat operative’s electioneering fan-
tasy—federalizing 
unlimited 
mail-in 
voting, prohibiting voter ID require-
ments, and allowing unregistered vot-
ers to show up and vote on election

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4647 
June 21, 2021 
day. Wisely, the Senate, in 2019, never 
took it up. 
Then, as the pandemic took root in 
the spring of 2020, Democrats, in search 
of yet a new crisis to justify this bill, 
included it in a pandemic relief bill 
that the House passed—again, without 
a single Republican vote. Once again, 
the Senate dismissed it and wisely fo-
cused on providing bipartisan pandemic 
relief, rather than using the pandemic 
as a justification to federalize elec-
tions. 
With the pandemic now in the rear-
view mirror, this legislation is being 
pitched as necessary to preserve voting 
rights, using cartoonish, overheated, 
and false characterizations of a few 
sensible, measured voting integrity 
laws that have recently been enacted 
by States. Why? Because Democrats 
have to invent a new crisis every 6 
months or so to conceal this quest to 
install themselves permanently into 
power. 
Don’t let them fool you. This isn’t 
about some State election law. The 
House passed virtually the same bill 
last year. Most of the components of 
this bill have been floating in Demo-
crat National Committee back rooms 
for years. 
This isn’t about voting rights. This 
legislation protects voting rights like 
banning 
security 
guards 
at 
banks 
would protect bank depositors. 
Now, why are the Democrats so des-
perate to pass this bill? Well, a recent 
report from POLITICO explains it. PO-
LITICO says: 
What’s at stake is . . . potentially the fu-
ture Democratic majorities. Many in the 
party privately worry that frontline Demo-
crats could lose their seats if Congress 
doesn’t [pass this bill]. 
So, to keep power, Democrats have 
determined that they have to take over 
State elections. This is about holding 
on to power and nothing else. There 
doesn’t seem to be a power grab that is 
too extreme for the modern left, 
whether it is this bill, legislation to 
pack the Supreme Court, suddenly 
changing their position and pushing to 
scrap fundamental Senate rules in 
order to obtain short-term political 
gains or adding Washington, DC, as a 
State. It is all about one thing—ful-
filling a fantasy of permanent Demo-
crat power. 
Under 
this 
legislation, 
American 
elections would no longer be about 
earning the support of voters by com-
municating a powerful vision. Rather, 
American elections would be all about 
creating the largest machine, identi-
fying favorable voters, and mass-gath-
ering their ballots door-to-door as effi-
ciently as possible. 
The winning campaign would be the 
one with the largest army of ballot 
harvesters to drive voters—registered 
or unregistered, with or without ID—to 
fill out and hand over a ballot that will 
be ‘‘dropped’’ on their behalf in un-
manned ballot boxes. 
Americans want commonsense laws 
that make it easier to vote and harder 
to cheat. Such laws currently exist 
throughout the country. That is why 
we had recordbreaking voter participa-
tion in 2020, including in my State of 
Tennessee. 
This legislation is as unnecessary as 
it is misguided and dangerous. It is a 
politician 
protection 
measure 
that 
would do irreparable damage to the 
fabric of this country, and it should be 
soundly rejected by this body. 
Madam President, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, this 
Saturday was Juneteenth, the first of-
ficial Juneteenth recognized by the 
Federal Government as a national holi-
day—the official end of slavery in 
America. I commemorated and cele-
brated Juneteenth with my colleague 
Senator VAN HOLLEN at a meeting of 
the NAACP chapter in Randallstown, 
MD, and we reflected on the progress 
that we have made since the end of 
slavery and the challenges that still re-
main. 
It has been a long path toward jus-
tice and equality in this country, and I 
think we all recognize the wisdom of 
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., with his 
famous quote that ‘‘the arc of the 
moral universe is long, but it bends to-
ward justice.’’ 
I think we all believe that, but in re-
cent actions taken by State govern-
ments to restrict voting rights, we see 
some very disturbing trends that would 
take issue with Dr. King’s statement 
that the moral universe is bending to-
ward justice. It seems like it has taken 
a detour. 
Voting rights is a fundamental issue 
of importance to a democratic country. 
After elections are over and we win, 
we celebrate. We celebrate the fact 
that we have gotten the support of the 
majority of the voters, and that is 
what democracy is all about. If we 
don’t win—and I think many of us have 
been involved in campaigns where our 
candidates have not been successful— 
we go to work to try to attract more 
voters in the next election so we can 
celebrate a victory. That is what par-
ticipation in a free society is all about. 
That is what democracies are about. 
In 
repressive 
autocratic 
regimes, 
they will never accept the will of the 
people. So they look at ways in which 
they can undermine the voter record— 
what the voters want to do, the voters’ 
will. In the 2020 election, we should all 
celebrate the record number of people 
who cast their ballots. It was a 
record—the most ever casting their 
votes for the Presidency of the United 
States. There were repeated reviews 
done by both Democrats and Repub-
licans at the national level and at the 
State level and at the local level. It 
verified the simple fact that there was 
no widespread corruption, that the will 
of the people prevailed, and Joe Biden 
and KAMALA HARRIS were elected Presi-
dent and Vice President of the United 
States. 
But that did not stop former Presi-
dent Trump in promoting the Big Lie. 
As a result of that, several States have 
now taken action to make it harder for 
people to cast their votes. The Brennan 
Center has pointed out that we have 
seen the worst assault on voting rights 
since Jim Crow. Fourteen States have 
enacted 22 new laws to make it more 
difficult—more difficult—for people to 
vote. This is unprecedented in modern 
times. 
So what have those laws done? Made 
it more difficult for voters to vote by 
mail, recognizing that for many voters, 
they prefer to vote by mail. We have 
States that have 100 percent voting by 
mail. There has been no indication of 
fraud in voting by mail. 
States have shortened the time for 
requesting mail-in ballots for voting, 
making it more difficult for individuals 
to be able to vote by mail, requiring 
certain requirements to vote by mail, 
making it more difficult to deliver 
their mail-in ballots, limiting the 
availability of mail ballot drop boxes. 
All of that had been included. Why? Be-
cause it makes it more difficult for 
people who are likely to vote for my 
opponent to vote. That is what the 
State legislatures are doing—stricter 
signature requirements, making in-per-
son voting more difficult, and purging 
voter rolls simply because a person did 
not vote—again, making it more dif-
ficult for people to vote. And it goes on 
and on and on in the type of legislation 
that has already passed or is currently 
being considered by many State legis-
latures around the country, making it 
more difficult to register to vote, mak-
ing it more difficult to vote, targeting 
potential voters more likely to vote for 
their opponents, targeting minorities, 
young voters, and older minority vot-
ers. 
Let me give just one example. Using 
Georgia as a specific example, their re-
cently enacted changes will dispropor-
tionately hurt Black voters. The Geor-
gia State law imposes voter identifica-
tion requirements on absentee ballots, 
makes it hard to request an absentee 
ballot, and makes it a crime for groups 
to provide food and water to voters 
waiting in line. 
Georgia is basically restricting mail 
voting in response to a shift in the ra-
cial demographics of the voters who 
use it. On the other hand, Georgia 
wants to keep mail voting available for 
older, White mail voters. 
Voter suppression is always unac-
ceptable, and the razor-thin political 
margins in Georgia may mean that 
suppression efforts like these will 
change political outcomes. Rather than 
imposing barriers to casting the sacred 
right to vote, Georgia should be look-
ing at ways to improve voter access.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4648 
June 21, 2021 
As the New York Times pointed out, 
the Georgia law comes on the heels of 
a major upset for Republicans in the 
traditionally red State, after voters 
picked Joe Biden in the Presidential 
election and elected Democrats to both 
of the State’s U.S. Senate seats. The 
paper noted that the new Georgia law 
‘‘will, in particular, curtail ballot ac-
cess for voters in booming urban and 
suburban counties, home to many 
Democrats.’’ President Biden was right 
to call this legislation the ‘‘Jim Crow 
in the 21st century.’’ 
There are many other examples. 
Georgia is not unique in the efforts we 
are seeing to suppress voter participa-
tion at elections. 
Look, it is fair game to try to per-
suade voters to vote for your can-
didate. It is not fair game to suppress 
their right to vote. 
So what is the vote this week all 
about, the vote we are going to have on 
bringing forward the opportunity to de-
bate voter suppression legislation to 
protect the right to vote? It is simply 
a motion to proceed with a debate on 
the Senate floor. Let me repeat that. 
We are not voting on S. 1, the passage 
of it. We are not voting on any specific 
proposal. I know my friend from West 
Virginia has offered a proposal. We are 
not voting on that. We are voting on 
the right for the Senate to take up this 
critically important issue or whether it 
should be filibustered so we can’t bring 
up a voter issue to protect the integ-
rity of the right to vote. 
Now, I support S. 1. I am a cosponsor 
of S. 1, For the People. I am proud to 
support the provisions of that bill. To 
me, it is carefully drafted legislation 
to deal with the modern threats to 
voter participation. I am extremely 
proud that my colleague from Mary-
land, Congressman JOHN SARBANES, is 
the principal sponsor of H.R. 1 in the 
House that already passed the House. 
It provides a basic Federal floor on 
protection of the right to vote—on 
voter registration, on vote-by-mail, no- 
excuse balloting, 2 weeks of early vot-
ing, including weekends, no notary re-
quirement for absentee ballots, drop- 
off boxes. That is a simple voter pro-
tection against the actions being taken 
by State legislatures that are aimed at 
certain demographic groups, a Federal 
floor. 
It ends political gerrymandering. I 
don’t know how any of my colleagues 
can defend the way legislative and con-
gressional lines are drawn today. I 
came from the State legislature. I am a 
former speaker of the house. I was re-
sponsible for one of the redistricting 
plans of Maryland when I was speaker 
of the house. It is just a horrible, par-
tisan, political process we use today to 
draw congressional lines. 
I have been accused by my congres-
sional colleagues in the House from 
Maryland that I ran for the Senate to 
avoid having to deal with congressional 
redistricting. There may be some truth 
to that, but I can tell you this: It is 
time to end political gerrymandering. 
Congressional 
districts 
should 
rep-
resent the communities’ interests, not 
an individual Congressman’s interest. 
S. 1 takes a major step forward in end-
ing 
political 
congressional 
redis-
tricting by gerrymandering. 
It provides a commitment by Con-
gress to advance a preclearance for-
mula that was in the Voting Rights 
Act of 1965 that now is not operative 
because of the Shelby County decision. 
It puts us on a path to once again have 
that important tool available in order 
to deal with the freedom and right to 
vote. 
It promotes voter security, S. 1, by 
eliminating the paper ballot—by re-
quiring the paper ballot, I should say, 
not eliminating it, by requiring a paper 
trail. I think we all agree that we want 
to be able to verify votes. The only way 
you can is if there is a paper trail, and 
it provides for that paper trail. 
It puts an end to the dominance of 
big money in the political system. 
They do that in a couple of ways: one, 
disclosure—how can anyone be against 
the disclosure of who is putting money 
into our political system?—and sec-
ondly, providing a way in which we can 
get rid of the dependence upon large 
special interest dollars. 
It includes, S. 1, two provisions that 
I authored. One is a deceptive practices 
act that deals with false or misleading 
advertisements which are aimed at tar-
geting minority communities to con-
fuse and mislead their votes. 
It includes the Democracy Restora-
tion Act, which I authored, which deals 
with laws passed after the end of slav-
ery in an effort to prevent African 
Americans from voting, for, you see, 
there are States that passed laws back 
then that are still on the books that 
disqualify for a lifetime a person con-
victed of a felony. 
The definition of ‘‘felony’’ is pretty 
general in many States, so we have 
States where one out of five African 
Americans has been disqualified from 
voting because of their conviction of a 
felony. Even though they are fully part 
of our society today, they don’t have 
the right to vote. We need to remove 
that disqualification on voting. 
My friend, our former colleague, 
John Lewis—the two of us were elected 
to the U.S. House of Representatives 
on the same day. In an editorial pub-
lished after his death, our former col-
league John Lewis recalled an impor-
tant lesson taught by Dr. Martin Lu-
ther King, Jr., and I quote our former 
colleague: 
He said each of us has a moral obligation 
to stand up, speak up and speak out. When 
you see something that is not right, you 
must say something. You must do some-
thing. Democracy is not a state. It is an act, 
and each generation must do its part. 
Well, we cannot take action if we 
don’t start, and we can’t start unless 
my colleagues allow us to proceed to 
this issue on the floor of the U.S. Sen-
ate. 
There is a reason why there are so 
many groups behind us taking action. I 
have a Facebook Live that I do every 2 
weeks with my constituents. Jana Mor-
gan from the Declaration for American 
Democracy, which represents over 180 
groups, from labor to racial justice 
groups, faith groups, women’s rights 
groups, environmental and good-gov-
ernance groups—all telling us that we 
need to move forward to protect our 
democracy, that the Senate needs to 
act on this issue. 
One of my guests, Virginia Kase Sol-
omon from the League of Women Vot-
ers—now, the League of Women Vot-
ers—you can say a lot of things about 
them, but you can’t accuse them of 
being partisan because they are not. It 
is one of our premier nonpartisan insti-
tutions in America with a proud his-
tory. They are telling us to take this 
bill up and act for the sake of pro-
tecting our democracy. 
We then have a chance to act, to take 
up amendments and vote on amend-
ments and vote on concerns, whether 
they are offered by a Republican Sen-
ator or a Democratic Senator. That is 
what the motion to proceed allows us 
to do, to take up these issues so we can 
vote on them. But if you vote to fili-
buster the motion to proceed, we can’t 
even bring the issue up on the Senate 
floor for action. 
I urge my colleagues not to filibuster 
the right of the U.S. Senate to start 
the debate on protecting voter integ-
rity, where each Member will have an 
opportunity to debate the issue, and 
collectively we can come together, as 
many of my colleagues have offered 
suggestions about how we can improve 
S. 1, how we can make it a broader con-
sensus, but we can’t do that unless we 
have the right to proceed to a debate. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
cloture motion on the motion to pro-
ceed so the Senate can take up this 
most critically important issue to the 
preservation of our democracy and the 
integrity of the right to vote. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that I 
be allowed to complete my remarks 
prior to the rollcall vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, if the Constitution is the founda-
tion our Republic, then the concept of 
‘‘one person, one vote’’ is the corner-
stone. It is also a promise that every 
single eligible voter in America takes 
with them into that voting booth on 
that election day. It gives them con-
fidence that their vote matters. It 
helps them to keep the faith in our 
electoral system and in their local gov-
ernment. 
We can talk about the vote on a 
grand scale here in Washington, but 
this is where it really matters: back 
home at your local polling place, in 
your home county, and in the precincts 
with the people who do the work of

standing up elections, running elec-
tions, and certifying their own elec-
tions. It is of the people, by the people, 
for the people that this process is car-
ried out in each and every one of our 
counties. And you know what, that is 
how it is supposed to be. 
Article I, section 4 of our Constitu-
tion clearly states—here it is: 
Times, Places and Manner of holding Elec-
tions for Senators and Representatives, shall 
be prescribed in each State by the Legisla-
ture thereof. 
Well, how about that? The Constitu-
tion delegates that authority to the 
State legislatures, and that is why our 
States’ secretaries of state work with 
our counties to make certain the proc-
ess is put in place. 
You know, I had the opportunity to 
serve on my county’s local election 
commission prior to my being in elec-
tive office. One person, one vote—that 
is the No. 1 rule that guided the deci-
sions they made. When we recruit poll 
workers, it is the No. 1 concern that 
drives people to go sign up. When we 
train the volunteers who are staffing 
polling places, it is the No. 1 rule to 
teach. Every person gets one vote. All 
legally cast votes are counted. That is 
the way it is supposed to work—one 
person, one vote. 
Here in the Senate, I am concerned 
that my Democratic colleagues have 
forgotten about this rule. Why else 
would they once again pledge to move 
a piece of legislation that would throw 
‘‘one person, one vote’’ out the win-
dow? Many of my Republican col-
leagues have taken to calling H.R. 1 or 
S. 1 the Politician Protection Act or 
the For the Politician Act, and I will 
have to agree that is a fairly apt de-
scription. 
There are a lot of problems with this 
bill, but I want to focus on a few key 
provisions that will gut ‘‘one person, 
one vote’’ and destroy confidence in 
our elections. 
If this bill passes, say goodbye to 
meaningful voter ID laws. My Demo-
cratic colleagues kept the idea of these 
requirements intact, but to please 
their radical base, they added a loop-
hole that would force every single ju-
risdiction to accept affidavits in lieu of 
identification—that is right, an affi-
davit. They may as well have banned 
voter IDs because that loophole makes 
requirements that voters prove they 
are who they say they are absolutely 
meaningless. They can just sign a 
statement saying ‘‘I am who I say I 
am’’ without having to show proof. 
The bill also requires States to allow 
paid campaign operatives to engage in 
ballot harvesting schemes. That is 
right. This allows your paid campaign 
operatives to engage in ballot har-
vesting schemes. Now, these ballot har-
vesting schemes have been proven time 
and again to increase the risk of fraud, 
so much so that many States on their 
own moved forward and banned ballot 
harvesting schemes. Why did they ban 
this? Because it leads to fraud in elec-
tions. 
Inexplicably, 
my 
colleagues 
also 
want to throw ballot drop boxes into 
the mix. They pitched them as a con-
venience, but that convenience will be 
nearly impossible to monitor and to 
protect 24 hours a day, which means 
that it will be nearly impossible to 
monitor and protect the ballots that 
are inside those boxes, and these boxes 
then become a fairly convenient way to 
stuff the ballot box. 
But perhaps the most dangerous, 
counterproductive, and outright infuri-
ating provision my Democratic col-
leagues have included in this mess of a 
bill is a restriction against voter roll 
maintenance. Anyone with a bit of com-
mon sense knows how inaccurate or du-
plicate entries in a dataset can add up. 
That leaves these datasets in a state of 
disrepair, and that is how fraud and 
mistakes occur. 
It is just one more provision in a bill 
raising red flags for local officials in 
every single State in this country. And 
this red flag, in particular, is prompt-
ing people to ask me if my Democratic 
colleagues involved in drafting this bill 
have ever actually volunteered at a 
local polling place, which really tells 
you a lot about how shortsighted this 
legislation is. 
This bill really doesn’t have anything 
to do with voting rights. This is a po-
litically motivated Federal takeover of 
elections that would give us the exact 
opposite of what is laid out in the Con-
stitution. 
The Founders—the Founders—grant-
ed the States power over their own 
elections for a reason. The Federal 
Government is beyond incompetent to 
get this job done. If you like the serv-
ice you get from the IRS or the EPA or 
OSHA, that is what you could expect 
the next time your community has an 
election. 
If we allow this bill to pass, the 
promise of one person, one vote will 
crumble. The promise of counting eligi-
ble ballots and not counting ineligible 
ballots would go by the wayside. And 
what do you get in exchange? The 
promise of chaos, confusion, and a lack 
of confidence in the integrity of the 
vote. 
TRIBUTE TO CHUCK FLINT 
Madam President, the time has come 
for Team Blackburn to say goodbye to 
our fearless leader and current chief of 
staff, Chuck Flint. 
Chuck first joined my team in the 
House as a member of our legislative 
staff. He was eager to prove himself ca-
pable and well versed on our legislative 
issues, and I will tell you, he suc-
ceeded. In the 7 years since he first 
walked through my office door, he has 
grown into one of the finest office 
chiefs of staff I have seen on the Hill 
and one of the finest political strate-
gists here on Capitol Hill, one of my 
most trusted advisers, and, I will add, 
the most enthusiastic softball player 
on Team Whiskey Business—the most 
enthusiastic I think we have ever field-
ed. 
I wish Chuck, Jessica, and little 
Everett all the hope and happiness in 
the world as they embark on their next 
beautiful adventure together. 
We will miss him tremendously, but 
no matter how far they travel, they 
will always have a home with Team 
Blackburn and in service to the Volun-
teer State. 
I yield the floor.

The motion is agreed to. 
The Senator from New York. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 1520 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, as 
if in legislative session, I ask unani-
mous consent that at a time to be de-
termined by the majority leader in 
consultation with the Republican lead-
er, the Senate Armed Services Com-
mittee be discharged from further con-
sideration of S. 1520 and the Senate 
proceed to its consideration; that there 
be 2 hours for debate, equally divided 
in the usual form; and that upon the 
use or yielding back of that time, the 
Senate vote on the bill with no inter-
vening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, I object for the rea-
son I previously stated. I want to 
thank the Senator for the courtesy of 
presenting the unanimous consent im-
mediately. 
I 
appreciate 
that 
very 
much. 
I am the first chairman to endorse 
the type of changes the Senator from 
New York has proposed as they apply 
to 
sex-related 
offenses 
under 
the 
UCMJ. It is my intent to include the 
administration’s proposals in the base 
markup of the Defense bill next month, 
subject to amendments. And I antici-
pate numerous amendments being of-
fered by Members on both sides of the 
aisle. Further, as I have already com-
mitted, the committee will consider 
these proposals to include a vote on 
them, in committee, if that is what 
any Senator desires. That is, in fact, 
the tradition of the committee. If a 
member wants a vote on an amend-
ment, we will vote. 
I would note that, according to com-
mittee records, there has not been a 
vote on this proposal in the committee 
since 2013, 8 years ago, and has not 
even been introduced as an amendment 
in committee since that time. 
I look forward to having this debate 
when the committee meets to mark up 
the fiscal year 2022 Defense bill. 
With that, I would reiterate my ob-
jection and again thank the Senator 
for her willingness to introduce the 
unanimous consent initially. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, it 
is very kind the chairman notes that 
the last time we got a vote in com-
mittee was 2013. We have been asking 
for a vote on this for the last 8 years, 
asking for the last 5 years to get a 
floor vote and been denied. This bill 
has been routinely and roundly filibus-
tered and opposed by the chairman and 
the ranking member for the entire 8 
years that I have been working on this 
bill. And this bicameral bill, that has 
66 Senate cosponsors, should not be rel-
egated by a committee that will com-
municate with the DOD behind the 
scenes. That is what they do. That is 
what they have been doing. 
This is not a bill related to a tech-
nical aspect of warfighting that would 
benefit from the expertise found within 
the DOD. It is a check on the com-
mander’s power that has allowed a cul-
ture to flourish, where two and three 
victims do not feel comfortable coming 
forward to report their assault and 64 
percent—a number that is stubbornly 
unchanged—experience 
retaliation 
when they do come forward. Moreover, 
a majority of the Members already co-
sponsor this bill so it is unclear what 
expertise the committee will add. It 
will only create an opportunity for the 
DOD to water down this much needed 
reform. 
As a military law expert, Brenner 
Fissell wrote today in The Hill, ‘‘An in-
stitution with the power to kill people 
and topple governments should not re-
sist our elected Senators’ clear will, 
cheering as a procedural loophole al-
lows a small minority to prevent pop-
ular forms from being implemented.’’ 
Mr. President, this is the 12th time 
that I have risen to ask for unanimous 
consent for a very simple reason: The 
Military Justice Improvement and In-
creasing Prevention Act deserves a 
vote. The people in the military de-
serve a military justice system worthy 
of their sacrifice. 
We don’t have time to delay. Every 
day that we delay a vote on this, more 
servicemembers are being sexually as-
saulted and raped. 
I started this request for unanimous 
consent 28 days ago. Since then, an es-
timated 
1,568 
servicemembers 
have 
been raped or sexually assaulted. More 
will have been victims of other serious 
crimes, and most of them will feel that 
there is no point in even reporting the 
crime because they have no faith in the 
current military justice system. That 
system asks commanders, not lawyers, 
to decide whether cases go forward. 
The lack of faith is understandable. 
Less than 1 in 10 sexual assault cases 
that are considered for command ac-
tion are actually sent to trial, and just 
a small fraction of those end in convic-
tion. 
In the 8 years that we have been 
fighting for this reform, further fault 
lines in the military justice system 
have been made evident, including 
deeply troubling racial disparities. It is 
a disappointment that the chairman is 
not here to hear this information him-
self. 
In 2017, a report found Black service-
members were as much as 2.61 times 
more likely to have disciplinary action 
taken against them as their White 
counterparts. In 2019, the GAO found 
Black and Hispanic servicemembers 
were more likely than White service-
members to be subjected to criminal 
investigation and to face general and 
special courts-martial. Those statics 
show a clear and pressing need to ad-
dress what appears to be inherent bias 
in the current command-controlled 
system. 
To provide our servicemembers with 
real justice, we must move all serious 
crimes out of the chain of command. 
This bill will do that by making a sim-
ple but critical change to the way the 
military justice system handles serious 
crime. It streamlines how cases move 
forward. Instead of commanders, who 
have zero formal legal training, mak-
ing the decision to prefer or refer cases 
to trial, this bill gives those legal deci-
sions to highly trained, impartial, pro-
fessional military justice lawyers. It 
allows the commander to continue to 
work hand in hand with judge advo-
cates to implement good order and dis-
cipline in their unit. 
The bill really comes down to one 
thing: Is there enough evidence to 
move this case forward? We should not 
put that responsibility on commanders, 
who often know both the accused and 
the accuser and do not have legalized 
training to be able to make these deci-
sions properly. When it comes to seri-
ous crimes that can lead to long, more- 
than-a-year sentences, that decision 
should be made by a legal expert. 
That is the change the bill would 
make. It is tailored, it is simple, and it 
is an elegant solution to meet a very 
real problem. Commanders still have 
lots of power. They have the ability to 
enact nonjudicial punishment, which 
allows them to set the tone for their 
troops and maintain good order and 
discipline. They will still have the abil-
ity to put people on restriction and in 
confinement. They still have the abil-
ity to issue protective orders. These 
are the basic tools that commanders 
rely on to implement good order and 
discipline, not general courts-martial. 
If a serious crime is not preferred and 
then referred by the JAG convening au-
thority, it goes right back to the com-
mander, who can choose to do several 
things. He can do nothing. He can 
carry out nonjudicial punishment or 
administrative separation. He can pur-
sue summary or special court-martial.

June 21, 2021 
However, this change, despite its 
simplicity and despite being a very 
small change, will create a seismic 
shift in how the military justice sys-
tem is perceived by both servicemem-
bers who have been subjected to sexual 
assault and by Black and Brown serv-
icemembers who have been subjected 
to bias. 
We need a professionalized military 
justice system so that everyone, from 
survivors to defendants, can have more 
trust in the current process—a process 
that is based on evidence and legal 
facts and that cases will be decided im-
partially. That is the system our serv-
icemembers deserve and is the system 
that we create by the Military Justice 
Improvement and Increasing Preven-
tion Act. 
We have tried every small ball effort 
you can imagine. The Presiding Officer 
has been on that committee for years. 
You watched us pass every type of re-
form that the DOD is OK with. This is 
the one they have fought tooth and 
nail to prevent implementation of, and 
even today, our chairman wants to nar-
row it down and reduce it to a very 
small size—one crime, one crime only. 
Well, let’s just look at the facts. The 
Vanessa Guillen case was a murder 
case. Under the chairman’s own anal-
ysis, he would not have allowed that 
case to go forward through the review 
of a special, trained military pros-
ecutor. In fact, her case may never 
have seen the light of day. That is a 
problem. So we need to treat all seri-
ous crimes the same. 
We have compromised on this bill. 
We carved out all the serious crimes 
that are military in nature—going 
AWOL, not following a direct com-
mand, anything that the commander 
would have a special purview over—but 
we draw a bright line at the rest of 
those serious crimes, and that is a good 
solution. It is what our allies have al-
ready done—UK, Israel, Canada, Ger-
many, 
Netherlands, 
Australia—and 
they saw no diminution in command 
control. 
We need to build a military justice 
system that is worthy of the sacrifices 
that the men and women in our armed 
services make every day. 
I yield the floor to the Senator from 
Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Thank you, Senator 
GILLIBRAND. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. I think we just 
heard the Senator from New York 
speak very strongly about the need for 
this legislation. She said 12 times she 
has come to the Senate floor to ask for 
UC on this bill. So we all ought to 
know—not only on this bill but a lot of 
things the Senator from New York is 
involved in—she is not going to give 
up. Eight years on this bill proves that, 
her persistence. 
We need to get this done. I would 
think that a bill that has 66 cosponsors 
and the demonstrated need for it is 
such that the people opposing this 
would be embarrassed, particularly 
with the 66 cosponsors. 
I thank Senator GILLIBRAND for her 
persistence. I am glad to be with her on 
this subject. I haven’t worked as hard 
as she has, but I believe everything she 
has said, and this bill should pass. 
In the last 15 years, there has been 
virtually no progress in reducing the 
level of sexual assault in the military. 
Far too many service men and women 
have experienced sexual assault, and 
we don’t even know the full extent of 
the problem because people are afraid 
to report these because of the retribu-
tion that happens as a result of the re-
port. Of those who do report, 64 percent 
experience retaliation. 
But this goes beyond sexual assault. 
This legislation professionalizes the 
military justice system and would im-
prove trust and transparency in the 
ability of the military to handle all se-
rious crimes. The policy of moving the 
decision to prosecute out of the chain 
of command has been recommended by 
military justice experts. 
This bill has been considered by the 
Armed Services Committee for 8 years 
in a row, and that is why the time has 
come now to make sure that this bill 
does not get buried once again in that 
committee or, as she suggested, very 
narrowly—the committee has had more 
than enough time to review the legisla-
tion and propose alternatives. We have 
even heard from the Department of De-
fense that they can solve this problem, 
and yet it keeps getting worse. 
This bill with so many cosponsors de-
serves the support and shouldn’t have 
to wait any longer to get passed. It is 
time for the legislation to finally move 
forward, and I urge my colleagues to 
join in this effort to get this done the 
easiest way possible, and that would be 
by UC. 
I yield the floor. 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. I suggest the ab-
sence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. GRAHAM. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the order for the quorum call 
be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from South Carolina. 
Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I have 
been listening today and a few other 
days, I think, about Senator GILLI-
BRAND’s efforts to bring up what I 
think is a major reform of the military 
justice system to the point where you 
won’t recognize it as it is today. I hope 
you understand what we are being 
asked to do here. Senator REED, who is 
the chairman of the committee, has 
been objecting. 
Before I got here, I was a military 
lawyer and Active Duty in the Re-
serves for about 33 years. I was a pros-
ecutor, defense attorney, and judge. 
What I would like to challenge this 
body to do is find me cases where the 
judge advocate has recommended pros-
ecution in a sexual assault case in the 
last 8 years and the commander refused 
to go forward. I was in the military 
JAG Corps for 33 years. I can only re-
member one time where that was even 
an issue. 
Previous efforts to reform the system 
work like the following: If the JAG rec-
ommends prosecution in a sexual as-
sault case as defined in the last piece of 
legislation and they refuse to go for-
ward, it is taken to the commander’s 
commander. So what problem are we 
trying to solve here? 
What we are doing in this bill is re-
lieving the chain of command when it 
comes to military justice. If the com-
mander no longer is concerned about 
sexual assaults in the barracks, we 
made a huge mistake. The heart and 
soul of the military justice system is 
to provide a fair trial to the accused, 
take care of victims, but give the com-
mander the tools they need for good 
order and discipline. 
So the idea of taking the commander 
out of the chain of command when it 
comes to terrible things like sexual as-
sault I think is a bad idea because it is 
the commander’s job to make sure that 
unit works well. Having a bunch of pro-
fessional prosecutors make the deci-
sion without the commander being in-
volved is basically relieving the com-
mander of what is best for that unit 
overall. 
Sexual assault is a problem in the 
military. It is a problem in the civilian 
world. It is a problem all over the 
place. But the military justice system 
is designed to bring about good order 
and discipline. 
I can only say that the day that the 
commander is taken out of the respon-
sibility for what happens in that unit 
is a bad day for good order and dis-
cipline and I think a bad day for that 
unit. 
Again, the legal advice given to com-
manders in cases like we are talking 
about is almost universally followed. 
There have probably been more occa-
sions where a commander will take an 
iffy case to court just to make the 
point—cases that would never probably 
get off first base in the civilian world. 
But the people pushing this bill al-
ways talk about results and courts- 
martial. I think the worst thing the 
U.S. Senate could do is create an im-
pression that a not-guilty verdict is 
unacceptable in the military. Some-
times a not-guilty verdict is the right 
answer to the situation presented to 
the court. I am beginning to doubt 
whether or not you can get a fair trial 
in the military if you are accused of 
one of these crimes. 
When politicians attack results in 
the system, we are sending a pretty 
clear signal: If you are a court-martial 
panel member, we are going to be grad-
ing your homework here in the Senate, 
because there seems to be a bias that 
the only outcome must be a guilty ver-
dict. 
The truth of the matter is that a lot 
of women go to their graves having

been assaulted and never having re-
ported the events to anybody. We need 
to make it easier for victims to come 
forward. On occasion, people are ac-
cused of things they didn’t do, and I 
have been involved in many of these 
cases. On occasion, you will find that 
the accusation doesn’t hold water—not 
sufficient to be anywhere near being 
beyond a reasonable doubt—and some-
times people say things that are just 
flat not true. 
So what I worry about is that, in our 
effort to reform the system to solve a 
problem that really doesn’t exist—com-
manders ignoring the JAGs and not 
prosecuting people because they like 
them or they have favoritism is not a 
problem. If you want to talk about re-
forming the military justice system, 
fine, but let’s don’t stand here in the 
U.S. Senate and say that commanders 
in the military routinely turn down 
legal advice to prosecute. They don’t. 
That is just not true. In the military, 
in a general court-martial, you need 
three-fourths to convict. 
If we are going to go down this track 
of talking about what an acceptable 
outcome should be, then I am going to 
start introducing legislation to change 
the requirement of the verdict to be 
unanimous. I was a prosecutor for 41⁄2 
years and a defense attorney for 2. I 
understand sort of the military court-
room environment. 
The panel members—the members of 
the jury—are commissioned officers or 
you can request noncommissioned offi-
cers, and the accused has that right up 
to a certain percentage of the panel. 
These panels are constructed not like a 
civilian court; they are constructed to 
make sure that the jury usually comes 
from the officer corps, and people with 
the responsibility for that base are 
picked to serve on these juries to make 
sure that the base is being well run, 
that people receive justice who have 
been violated, and that those accused 
of a crime have a fair trial. The worst 
thing that can happen is when a com-
mander seems to have favorites and the 
people he likes get away with almost 
anything and the people the com-
mander doesn’t like—well, they look 
for reasons to come down hard on 
them. 
When I was a young JAG, I would go 
talk to commanders and first ser-
geants. The worst thing you can do to 
a unit is play favorites. Call them as 
you see them. You need to show up in 
the middle of the night in the bar-
racks—the commander and first ser-
geant—when they least think you are 
going to come, and just let people 
know you are watching them. Most en-
listed people are 18 to 22 years old, and 
it is their first time away from home. 
We have made some strides that I 
think are good. We provide victims of 
sexual assault in the military with 
their own individual counsel. Most peo-
ple don’t get that in the civilian world. 
We are trying to train prosecutors on 
how to handle these cases, and I like 
that. Yet, if we are going to start cre-
ating a presumption here—contrary to 
being innocent—that there is only one 
right answer, then we need to start 
training a bunch of defense attorneys 
and have a specialty there. The worst 
thing that could happen in a military 
unit is for somebody to be assaulted 
and to be treated poorly, and nothing 
happens. Second to that is for some-
body to be accused of something that is 
seen as being not legitimate. That is 
why you have trials. That is why you 
have defense attorneys. That is why 
you have judges. That is why you have 
prosecutors. 
The thing that is unique about the 
military is that it is not a jury of your 
peers. The jury is made up of the offi-
cer corps on that base who has the re-
sponsibility, usually, to run the base. 
You can request, as an enlisted mem-
ber, that part of the panel be enlisted, 
but they are going to be the more sen-
ior ranks on the base. They are not 
going to be E–3s and E–4s. They are 
going to be E–8s and E–9s. They are 
going to be the senior enlisted corps, 
who is responsible for good order and 
discipline and morale on the base. That 
is what is unique about the military 
justice system. 
I found, as a defense attorney, that 
people look long and hard at the gov-
ernment’s case. I will talk later on 
about some cases I had wherein people 
were accused of using drugs by urinal-
ysis. The system was fatally flawed, 
and over time the military justice sys-
tem got that right. 
I just want Senator REED to know 
that, on slowing this train down and 
getting the Members of this body to 
understand what we are talking about, 
I will support him more. I should be 
down here talking more. Like every-
body else, we are busy. I promise to 
come down more to give my side of 
what we should be thinking about in 
terms of reform and why what is before 
us is not reform; it is a radical change 
to the military justice system based 
on, I think, a premise that doesn’t 
exist. 
The one thing I want you to know is 
there are a handful of cases a year in 
the Army, the Air Force, the Marine 
Corps, and the Navy on which the com-
mander refuses to go forward after the 
JAGs have recommended a court-mar-
tial in sexual assault cases. That is 
what we are all supposed to be worried 
about—that 
the 
system 
is 
biased 
against victims. What can we do to 
make it easier to report these situa-
tions? What can we do to convince peo-
ple that the command is not going to 
turn on you if you are a victim? These 
are all legitimate things, but to fire 
the entire chain of command based on 
a premise that, I think, doesn’t hold 
water would be bad and would, over 
time, undercut the military’s ability to 
maintain good order and discipline and 
to be an effective fighting force. 
Senator REED is the chairman of the 
committee, and I will try to do more to 
help him. I respect Senator GILLIBRAND 
a lot, and she is very passionate about 
this. All I can say is that passion and 
justice have to be measured, and we 
have to be making decisions based on 
facts, not just on an outcome that we 
would like. When we start talking 
about a case wherein somebody was ac-
quitted and as if that was the wrong re-
sult, that scares the hell out of me. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
SMITH). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
NOMINATION OF TRACY STONE-MANNING 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, I 
am here on the Senate floor this after-
noon to call on President Biden to 
withdraw his nomination to lead the 
Bureau of Land Management, Tracy 
Stone-Manning. He should withdraw 
her for the reasons I am going to talk 
about here on the Senate floor, but let 
me stipulate that, while I have often 
spoken about what I consider far-left 
extremist environmentalists who are 
taking over many elements of the 
Biden administration, often in the con-
text of why I voted against their con-
firmation, I have not yet called on— 
haven’t in my entire Senate career—a 
nomination to be withdrawn before 
they even have gone through their Sen-
ate confirmation hearing before a Sen-
ate committee. But I am doing it this 
afternoon. 
The reason I have never done this be-
fore is because we have not yet con-
fronted someone with Tracy Stone- 
Manning’s past, which involves being a 
member, part of an extreme group that 
performed violent acts as part of their 
platform 
for 
getting 
attention 
in 
America—violence, a group engaging in 
overt ecoterrorism. 
By the way, this is becoming a bipar-
tisan 
issue—a 
serious 
bipartisan 
issue—as I am going to talk about in a 
little bit more detail. 
The 
Director 
of 
BLM 
from 
the 
Obama-Biden administration just yes-
terday made a statement saying that, 
if these allegations are true, which 
they are, then, he firmly believes that 
her nomination should be withdrawn 
by the President. That is Mr. Bob 
Abbey. So this is a serious issue, and it 
is a bipartisan issue. 
Before I talk about Tracy Stone- 
Manning’s 
involvement 
with 
ecoterrorism, let me start by saying 
that BLM is an incredibly important 
and very powerful Federal Agency, par-
ticularly as it relates to my State, the 
great State of Alaska. The Alaska BLM 
manages more surface and subsurface 
acres in my State than in any other 
State in the country, by far. In fact, I 
haven’t done the math, but I believe 
that they manage more acreage in 
Alaska than they do in the rest of the 
lower 48 combined. That is how impor-
tant BLM is in my State.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4653 
June 21, 2021 
Let me give you some of the num-
bers. This includes over 70 million sur-
face acres of land and 220 million sub-
surface acres. That is the land equiva-
lent to about one-fifth of the entire 
lower 48 States. Most States can’t even 
comprehend that size. One-fifth of the 
lower 48 of the United States of Amer-
ica is the amount of land BLM man-
ages just in the great State of Alaska. 
So it is a huge amount of land and, of 
course, by definition, it is a huge 
amount of power that this Federal 
Agency has over my State and the peo-
ple I am honored to represent. 
And it is imperative—imperative—for 
the Director of this Agency, the Bu-
reau of Land Management, with so 
much power and so much control over 
my State and its future in economic 
opportunity for working Alaskan fami-
lies—that the manager of BLM for the 
country be trustworthy—to be honest, 
to be fairminded, to be beyond re-
proach, and, certainly, not to have 
been involved in an organization that 
perpetuated violence against its fellow 
Americans. 
And from what we know about Tracy 
Stone-Manning, she is none of these 
things—trustworthy, honest, and fair-
minded. 
That this administration is full of 
people with far-left agendas certainly 
isn’t surprising. We all know that the 
national Democratic Party is much 
further to the left than they were even 
4 years ago with the Obama-Biden ad-
ministration. But what is shocking be-
yond surprising is that the President of 
the United States would put forward 
someone for this incredibly important 
position in BLM who is not only far 
left but a member of a group that was 
an ecoterrorist organization, a group 
that was undertaking violence against 
their fellow Americans so they could 
make a point on environmental issues 
in America. 
This is not an exaggeration. Tracy 
Stone-Manning was a member of Earth 
First!, a radical, far-left group that has 
engaged repeatedly in what is defined 
as ecoterrorism. 
But she wasn’t just a member of 
Earth First!; she herself was complicit 
in putting metal spikes—big, thick 
ones—in trees that were meant to ei-
ther threaten to hurt or gravely injure 
those Americans who were harvesting 
trees, who were cutting down trees le-
gally, who were putting trees in saw 
mills legally. 
This was a common technique—tree 
spiking—deployed 
by 
such 
ecoterrorists in the late 1980s and early 
1990s. 
Earth 
First! 
called 
such 
tactics 
‘‘monkey wrenching.’’ That is kind of 
cute. It is dangerous. It could kill peo-
ple—‘‘monkey wrenching.’’ 
Logging crews and the Americans 
who were legally harvesting timber in 
our country might have called such 
tactics terrifying, and certainly called 
such tactics very, very dangerous. 
So let me briefly talk about the 
group that Tracy Stone-Manning was a 
member of. Earth First! began in 1980 
by disaffected environmentalists who 
thought the movement wasn’t radical 
enough, thought the movement wasn’t 
getting enough attention. So they 
founded a new group that wanted to get 
more attention, sometimes by perpet-
uating violence. Among its proposed 
founding principles, ‘‘all human deci-
sions should consider Earth first, man-
kind second’’—I am quoting now— 
‘‘mankind second.’’ OK. Not sure many 
U.S. Senators would agree with that. 
And ‘‘the only true test of morality is 
whether an action, individual, social or 
political, benefits the earth.’’ These are 
founding principles of this organiza-
tion. 
Given these principles, it is no mys-
tery that the group’s slogan is this: 
‘‘No Compromise in Defense of Mother 
Earth.’’ 
In 
their 
view, 
‘‘no 
com-
promise’’ meant destroying property, 
putting steel spikes in trees that could 
kill someone trying to harvest a tree, 
and Earth First! celebrated and encour-
aged such actions. 
The group even put out a manual— 
yes, a manual—detailing tree spiking 
and instructions on how to do other 
sabotage 
activities: 
cut 
down 
powerlines, flatten tires, burn machin-
ery of those who were trying to harvest 
trees legally. 
We harvest trees legally in Alaska. 
We have loggers who do that, who are 
from hard-working families. 
David Foreman, the founder of Earth 
First!, talked about all of these activi-
ties, and he said: ‘‘This is where the 
ecoteur can have fun.’’ That is a quote 
from the founder of Earth First! 
‘‘Fun.’’ That is what he called this— 
‘‘fun.’’ 
Tell that to those violently hurt by 
some of Earth First!’s tactics. 
This is how an article in the Wash-
ington Post, from this time, described 
such an incident of tree spiking that 
severely, violently hurt one of our fel-
low Americans. And now I am going to 
quote from this article: 
George Alexander, a third-generation mill 
worker, was just starting his shift at the 
Louisiana-Pacific lumber mill in Cloverdale, 
Calif., when the log that would alter his life 
rolled down his conveyor belt toward a high- 
speed saw he was working on. 
By the way, I have seen these saws in 
Alaska, in mills in Alaska. They are 
huge. This isn’t just some kind of tiny 
saw. They are gigantic, and they spin 
at incredibly fast speeds with huge 
teeth. They are dangerous, even when 
you are operating without tree spikes 
in the trees. 
Let me continue. Here is the continu-
ation of this article from the Wash-
ington Post: It was May 1987, and 
George Alexander was 23 years old. His 
job was to split logs. He was nearly 3 
feet away when the log he was working 
on hit his saw, and the saw, this giant 
saw, exploded. One-half of the blade 
stuck in the log. The other half hit 
Alexander in the head—again, these are 
giant saws—tearing through his safety 
helmet and tearing through his face 
shield. His face was slashed from eye to 
chin, his teeth were smashed, and his 
jaw was cut in half. 
That is what Earth First! did to this 
young American doing his job with a 
tree spike in it. 
I am continuing with the Washington 
Post article: George Alexander had 
never even heard of a sabotage tactic 
called tree spiking until he himself had 
become a victim of ‘‘eco-terrorism.’’ 
That is the Washington Post’s word, 
not my word, ‘‘eco-terrorism.’’ 
Someone who objected to tree cutting had 
imbedded a huge steel spike in the log that 
violently jammed the saw. 
And changed George Alexander’s life. 
Tree spiking. 
That is the Washington Post. 
These were the kinds of tactics that 
Tracy Stone-Manning, the Biden ad-
ministration’s choice to lead the BLM 
for America, once conspired in. Does 
that disturb you, America? 
Every U.S. Senator on the floor here 
in this body should be very, very dis-
turbed. 
Mr. President—and now I am talking 
to the President of the United States— 
think about this, sir. I say respectfully: 
Come on, man. This is the most quali-
fied American citizen you can find to 
be the BLM Director? 
She was part of a group—not just a 
radical, extreme environmental group 
but a radical, extreme, violent, envi-
ronmental group. 
President Biden, this should be a red-
line that we all agree to: no nominees 
who conducted violence against their 
fellow Americans. 
But what did she do specifically? The 
Biden 
administration’s 
Director 
of 
BLM—nominated Director of BLM— 
here is what she did. In 1989, she did a 
friend, a fellow Earth First! colleague— 
‘‘comrade’’ maybe is a better word—she 
did a friend, a comrade, a fellow com-
rade a favor. She rewrote word-for- 
word a profane, anonymous letter from 
this member of Earth First! about the 
500 pounds of tree spikes that Earth 
First! had hammered into trees in 
Idaho—by Earth First! Pretty dan-
gerous. Pretty violent. She rewrote the 
letter on a rented typewriter because, 
she later told a reporter, ‘‘her finger-
prints were all over’’ it. So she knew 
she was obviously involved in criminal 
activity. So she didn’t just handwrite 
it. She didn’t want her fingerprints on 
it. She typed it. She then sent the let-
ter to the FBI. 
She kept quiet on what she did for 
years—that was in 1989—until she came 
forward in 1993 and received immunity 
for her part in this tree spiking in 
Idaho, 500 pounds of spikes. This is a 
serious operation. Deadly. Could be 
deadly. She received immunity for her 
part in this tree spiking when prosecu-
tors went after the other members of 
Earth First! and she testified about it. 
Here is something that should be 
very simple for all of us. No matter 
how young, no matter how naive, the 
Director of the Bureau of Land Man-
agement for the United States of

June 21, 2021 
America should not—and I repeat, 
should not—have ever been involved in 
ecoterrorism. That is simply unaccept-
able, and the President of the United 
States should get that, and certainly 
every U.S. Senator should get that. 
Working with people who were so 
radical on environmental issues that 
they thought it was OK to perpetuate 
violence against their fellow American 
citizens—come on, man. 
President Biden, you cannot be seri-
ous. 
It is not only me who thinks this is 
an outrage. I want to compliment my 
Senate colleague Senator BARRASSO, 
who has been doing a great job. Unfor-
tunately, our press has been asleep at 
the switch. Senator BARRASSO has been 
doing a great job of highlighting these 
very issues. But, as I said earlier, this 
is now becoming a bipartisan issue. It 
is not just me and Senator BARRASSO 
who have been raising this issue. Just 
yesterday, Bob Abbey, who led the 
BLM from 2009 through 2012 under 
President Obama and Vice President 
Biden, said the following: 
If 
the 
reports 
regarding 
Ms. 
Stone- 
Manning’s involvement with spiking trees 
are true, then I firmly believe she should im-
mediately withdraw her name from further 
consideration for the BLM director job. 
Let me read that again. The BLM Di-
rector of the Biden-Obama administra-
tion just yesterday said the following: 
If 
the 
reports 
regarding 
Ms. 
Stone- 
Manning’s involvement with spiking trees 
are true, then I firmly believe she should im-
mediately withdraw her name from further 
consideration for the BLM director job. 
Well, guess what. The reports about 
her involvement with tree spiking by 
the ecoterrorist organization Earth 
First! meant to harm her fellow Ameri-
cans are true. They are true. 
Madam President, there are other 
issues that also call into question Ms. 
Stone-Manning’s character. I am not 
going to get into these. I will let others 
focus on them—low interest loans, 
other things. That is in some ways, in 
my view, a distraction. Her involve-
ment with an organization that was fo-
cused on ecoterrorism certainly dis-
qualifies her, and the President of the 
United States should know this. 
I didn’t agree with Bob Abbey on 
much when he was the head of BLM 
under the Obama-Biden administra-
tion, but I certainly agree with him 
about Tracy Stone-Manning, and I be-
lieve the President of the United 
States should withdraw her name from 
further consideration. If the President 
doesn’t do that because he gets pres-
sure from the extreme left, then I cer-
tainly hope—I certainly hope—my col-
leagues here in the U.S. Senate, Demo-
crats and Republicans, will resound-
ingly vote to reject this nomination 
when it comes to the Senate floor. 
Yes, we have differences on issues of 
resource 
development, 
energy 
for 
America, certainly on issues of jobs 
and resource development in my great 
State, the great State of Alaska. We 
have differences. There is no doubt 
about it. But here is the thing: We all 
know—I think every one of us, all 100 
Senators, know and would say publicly 
that these differences should be re-
solved peacefully in debates here on 
the Senate floor, at the ballot box, ar-
guing these issues—forcefully, yes, but 
not violently, not with violence. 
So if this nominee comes to this 
floor, it shouldn’t be even a close vote; 
it should be 100 to 0 rejecting her. 
To my Democratic colleagues, I hope 
you join me, like Mr. Bob Abbey, in 
saying: Mr. President, guess what—you 
screwed up here. Withdraw her. 
But if he won’t do that, I hope every 
U.S. Senator votes against this. We 
cannot condone, endorse, or vote for 
somebody who has been part of an 
ecoterrorist, radical, extreme, violent 
organization. 
My 
colleagues, 
America 
will 
be 
watching. If you vote for her, you have 
to go home and explain that vote to 
your fellow Americans. As I mentioned, 
it is one thing for this administration 
to put forward far-left, extreme envi-
ronmental nominees. It is quite an-
other to put forward a far-left, ex-
treme, violent environmental nominee, 
and that is what she is. 
To the President of the United 
States: Respectfully, sir, you need to 
withdraw this nomination. 
To my colleagues on the Senate floor 
here: Respectfully to all of you, if the 
President doesn’t take this common-
sense action, we need to decisively re-
ject this nomination when it comes to 
the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
I yield the floor.

jority leader.

NATIONAL DAIRY MONTH 
Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, I 
rise in support of S. Res. 268 and of our 
Nation’s dairy farmers, processors, and 
consumers as we celebrate National 
Dairy Month. 
This National Dairy Month is espe-
cially important. This time last year, 
the country was still shut down. The 
economy was in the middle of a major 
shock, and the dairy sector, like so 
many others, had to persevere. Dairy 
farmers bore the brunt of very low 
prices resulting from the COVID–19 
pandemic. Dairy processors had to 
pivot their entire supply chain to meet 
new and unique demand for their prod-
ucts. While managing these challenges, 
dairy processors continue to address 
food insecurity caused by the pandemic 
by donating billions of dollars of nutri-
tious milk, cheese, yogurt, and butter 
to needy Americans. 
Despite unthinkable pressures, the 
industry continues to hold on. By no 
means are we out of the woods yet. 
Dairy farmers across the country con-
tinue to face pricing challenges. This 
National 
Dairy 
Month 
and 
every 
month, I encourage my fellow Members 
of the Senate and all Americans to 
keep these hard-working farm families 
in your mind and their products in 
your grocery basket. 
Milk provides several essential nutri-
ents and is the No. 1 source of calcium, 
potassium, and vitamin D for Ameri-
cans. 
Yogurt 
and 
cheese 
are 
top 
sources of protein, magnesium, phos-
phorous, vitamins A and D, and cal-
cium. And my personal favorite dairy 
product—ice cream—is a delicious, nu-
trient-dense treat that hits the spot 
during hot summer days in Arkansas. 
National Dairy Month is a wonderful 
annual tradition highlighting an im-
portant sector and its contribution to 
the American economy and dinner 
plate. I want to thank Senators ROGER 
MARSHALL, KIRSTEN
GILLIBRAND, and 
others for bringing this resolution to 
the Senate floor and for their steadfast 
service on behalf of U.S. agriculture. 
f 
THE REAL CHALLENGES OF 
RANCHING 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
rise today to submit for the record a 
column written by Mr. Jim Magagna, 
executive vice president of the Wyo-
ming Stock Growers Association, enti-
tled ‘‘Magagna: The Real Challenges of 
Ranching.’’ The article was published 
on June 2 of this year. 
I recently spoke at the 2021 Wyoming 
Cattle Industry Convention and Trade 
Show, ‘‘Positioning Wyoming’s Beef In-
dustry for Success,’’ hosted by the 149- 
year-old Wyoming Stock Growers Asso-
ciation in Sheridan. This convention 
focused on both the challenges and the 
opportunities that producers have be-
fore them. Jim says it best: Some of 
these are just simply challenging op-
portunities. 
I urge my colleagues to stand with 
ranchers like Jim Magagna and the 
ranchers that he represents. Stand 
with those who understand the land 
best and not with extremists who do 
not know how to run a farm, a ranch, 
or a small business. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
Ranching in Wyoming begins with a dedi-
cated, often multi-generational, ranching 
family or a highly qualified dedicated ranch 
manager. Beyond this foundation, success on 
an annual basis is driven primarily by three 
factors—the weather, the markets and the 
government. When two of these are positive, 
most ranchers would describe their year as a 
‘‘success’’. In that rare year when all three 
factors are particularly favorable, the sea-
soned rancher saves dollars in preparation 
for the inevitable bad year.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4655 
June 21, 2021 
2020, given the impacts of COVID, was a 
year of ‘‘all of the above’’ and more. The 
daily chores and challenges of operating the 
ranch continued. With livestock needing to 
be fed, and calved or lambed there was no un-
employment. While others struggled to ad-
just to having their children home doing re-
mote learning, many ranchers just welcomed 
the extra help from the kids. A major chal-
lenge was driving long distances into town 
for supplies, only to find that many of the 
needed items were not available. 
Livestock markets crashed in the spring of 
2020, but returned to a more normal range by 
the time that most Wyoming ranchers were 
facing fall marketing. Government policies 
were stable and somewhat friendly toward 
agriculture. While some areas of Wyoming 
experienced drought, most ranchers were 
able to maintain their herds with some 
added supplemental feeding. Federal pay-
ments through the CARES Act provided sig-
nificant relief for some. Looking back, two 
of the three factors could be deemed to have 
been positive at some time during the year. 
While the impacts of COVID have lessened, 
2021 is evolving as a much more challenging 
year for many Wyoming ranchers than 2020 
when assessed by the three factors. Drought 
clearly rises to the top of concerns faced by 
producers across most of the state. North-
western Wyoming experienced good winter 
snowfall and the very southeastern portion 
has had significant spring moisture. How-
ever, the majority of Wyoming is suffering 
from both a shortage of irrigation water and 
a lack of soil moisture. As a result, we are 
seeing a worrisome reduction in the number 
of summer pasture cattle coming into the 
state as well as the sale of replacement heif-
ers that had been retained in the fall of 2020. 
This will have impacts on production for at 
least the next several years. 
The change in administrations in Wash-
ington, DC this year has added another high 
level of uncertainty to Wyoming ranching. 
While some degree of uncertainty accom-
panies any political change, the rhetoric and 
fast-paced issuance of Executive and Secre-
tarial Orders by the current administration 
has been particularly frightening. The rhet-
oric that surrounds ‘‘30 x 30’’, ‘‘Make Amer-
ica Beautiful’’, ‘‘Climate Change’’ and other 
initiatives to date lacks any substantive de-
tail to enable our assessment of how it might 
affect Wyoming’s agriculture industry. 
Cattle market events in recent years have 
given cattle producers both needed wake-up 
call and a new path forward. Our beef mar-
keting chain clearly has a bottleneck at the 
processing level. This both increases risk 
when an event such as COVID impacts a 
major facility, and concentrates market con-
trol in too few hands. Consumer interest in 
buying local and knowing where their food 
comes from has provided new marketing op-
portunities for some producers. In the span 
of two years Wyoming has gone from having 
only one federally inspected processing facil-
ity to nine facilities either operating or 
under construction. New larger facilities 
being developed across the nation, including 
in Idaho and Nebraska, will provide greater 
competition and lessen dependence on the 
‘‘Big Four’’ U.S. beef processors. Efforts by 
the industry and the Wyoming Business 
Council continue to attract larger processors 
to Wyoming. 
A discussion of ranching’ s challenges 
would not be complete without acknowl-
edging the emergence of ‘‘fake meat’’—both 
plant-based and lab-cultured products. While 
these products have received tremendous 
publicity, endorsement by celebrities and are 
now offered in some retail establishments, 
they have not emerged as a threat to the de-
mand for high-quality beef and lamb. 
Yes, ranching today is faced with signifi-
cant 
emerging 
challenges. 
Fortunately, 
these challenges are leading to exciting new 
opportunities. Exploring these opportunities 
will be the focus of the 2021 Wyoming Cattle 
Industry Convention and Trade Show, ‘‘Posi-
tioning Wyoming’s Beef industry for Suc-
cess’’ hosted by the 149 year-old Wyoming 
Stock Growers Association in Sheridan June 
2–4.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTION 
By Mr. REED: 
S. 2145. A bill to ensure that irrespon-
sible corporate executives, rather than 
shareholders, pay fines and penalties; 
to the Committee on Banking, Hous-
ing, and Urban Affairs. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am 
reintroducing the Corporate Manage-
ment Accountability Act, which asks 
each publicly traded company to dis-
close its policies on whether senior ex-
ecutives or shareholders bear the costs 
of paying the company’s fines and pen-
alties. 
In 2014, William Dudley, then the 
President of the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York, gave a speech titled ‘‘En-
hancing Financial Stability by Improv-
ing Culture in the Financial Services 
Industry.’’ In this speech, President 
Dudley said, ‘‘in recent years, there 
have been ongoing occurrences of seri-
ous professional misbehavior, ethical 
lapses and compliance failures at fi-
nancial institutions. This has resulted 
in a long list of large fines and pen-
alties and to a lesser degree than I 
would have desired employee dismis-
sals and punishment . . . The pattern 
of bad behavior did not end with the fi-
nancial crisis, but continued despite 
the considerable public sector inter-
vention that was necessary to stabilize 
the financial system. As a consequence, 
the financial industry has largely lost 
the public trust.’’ 
Since 2009, banks around the world 
have paid $394 billion in penalties, ac-
cording 
to 
the 
Boston 
Consulting 
Group (BCG). This is an increase of $22 
billion from the last time I introduced 
this legislation. It has been evident 
that simply fining and penalizing fi-
nancial institutions at the corporate 
level is not enough to deter bad actors. 
Senior executives, many of whom are 
all too eager to take credit for a com-
pany’s good news, must also take more 
responsibility for the bad news, espe-
cially if it is true that the buck stops 
with them. 
According 
to 
Professor 
Peter 
J. 
Henning, who also writes the White 
Collar Watch column for the New York 
Times, ‘‘a problem in holding individ-
uals accountable for misconduct in an 
organization is the disconnect between 
the actual decisions and those charged 
with overseeing the company, so that 
executives and corporate boards usu-
ally plead ignorance about an issue 
until it is too late.’’ 
The Corporate Management Account-
ability Act I am reintroducing today is 
one attempt at helping to solve this 
problem. The bill simply asks publicly 
traded companies to disclose whether 
they expect senior executives or share-
holders to pay the cost of corporate 
fines or penalties. This proposal has 
been supported by University of Min-
nesota Law School Professors Claire 
Hill and Richard Painter, who also 
served as President George W. Bush’s 
chief ethics lawyer, as well as Ameri-
cans for Financial Reform. 
I urge all my colleagues to join this 
legislative effort to hold senior execu-
tives accountable for their actions. 
By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and 
Mrs. SHAHEEN): 
S. 2146. A bill to establish within the 
Office of the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services a special task force on 
ensuring Medicare beneficiary access 
to innovative diabetes technologies 
and services; to the Committee on Fi-
nance. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am 
reintroducing the Stronger Enforce-
ment of Civil Penalties Act along with 
Senator GRASSLEY and Senator LEAHY. 
This bill will help securities regulators 
better protect investors and demand 
greater accountability from market 
players. Even in the midst of an un-
precedented public health and eco-
nomic emergency, we continue to see 
calculated wrongdoing by some on Wall 
Street, and without the consequence of 
meaningful penalties to serve as an ef-
fective deterrent, I worry this dis-
turbing culture of misconduct will per-
sist. 
The amount of penalties the Securi-
ties and Exchange Commission (SEC) 
can fine an institution or individual is 
restricted by statute. During hearings I 
held in 2011 as Chairman of the Bank-
ing Committee’s Securities, Insurance, 
and 
Investment 
Subcommittee, 
I 
learned how this limitation signifi-
cantly interferes with the SEC’s ability 
to execute its enforcement duties. At 
that time, a Federal judge had criti-
cized the SEC for not obtaining a larg-
er settlement against Citigroup, a 
major actor in the financial crisis that 
settled with the agency in an amount 
that was far below the cost the bank 
had inflicted on investors. The SEC in-
dicated that a statutory prohibition 
against levying a larger penalty led to 
the low settlement amount. Indeed, 
then SEC Chairman Mary L. Schapiro 
in 2011 also explained that ‘‘the Com-
mission’s statutory authority to obtain 
civil monetary penalties with appro-
priate deterrent effect is limited in 
many circumstances.’’ 
The bipartisan bill we are reintro-
ducing aims to update the SEC’s out-
dated civil penalties statutes. This bill 
strives to make potential and current 
offenders think twice before engaging 
in misconduct by raising the maximum 
statutory civil monetary penalties, di-
rectly linking the size of the penalties 
to the amount of losses suffered by vic-
tims of a violation, and substantially 
increasing the financial stakes for se-
rial offenders of our nation’s securities 
laws. 
Specifically, our bill would broaden 
the SEC’s options to tailor penalties to 
the particular circumstances of a given 
violation. In addition to raising the per 
violation caps for severe, or ‘‘third 
tier,’’ violations to $1 million per of-
fense for individuals and $10 million 
per offense for entities, the legislation 
would also give the SEC more options 
to collect greater penalties based on 
the ill-gotten gains of the violator or 
on the financial harm to investors. 
Our bill also seeks to deter repeat of-
fenders on Wall Street through two 
provisions. The first would authorize 
the SEC to triple the penalty cap appli-
cable to recidivists who have been held 
either criminally or civilly liable for 
securities fraud within the previous 
five years. The second would allow the 
SEC to seek a civil penalty against 
those who violate existing federal 
court or SEC orders, an approach that 
would be more efficient, effective, and 
flexible than the current civil con-
tempt remedy. These updates would 
greatly enhance the SEC’s ability to 
levy robust penalties against repeat of-
fenders. 
According to the SEC’s FY 2022 Con-
gressional Budget Justification, ‘‘the 
SEC is responsible for reviewing the 
disclosures and financial statements of 
more than 7,400 reporting companies.’’ 
The SEC further notes that a ‘‘record 
67 million U.S. families held direct and 
indirect stock holdings in 2019, up 13 
percent from 2010,’’ and the agency is 
‘‘charged 
with 
overseeing 
approxi-
mately $100 trillion in annual securi-
ties trading on U.S. equity markets 
and the activities of more than 28,000 
registered entities.’’ All of our con-
stituents deserve a strong regulator 
that has the necessary tools to go after 
fraudsters and pursue the difficult 
cases arising from our increasingly 
complex 
financial 
markets. 
The 
Stronger Enforcement of Civil Pen-
alties Act will enhance the SEC’s abil-
ity to demand meaningful account-
ability from Wall Street, which in turn 
will increase transparency and con-
fidence in our financial system. I urge 
our colleagues to support this impor-
tant bipartisan legislation. 
By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. 
GRASSLEY, and Mr. LEAHY): 
S. 2147. A bill to enhance civil pen-
alties under the Federal securities 
laws, and for other purposes; to the 
Committee on Banking, Housing, and 
Urban Affairs. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr President, I

league Senator COLLINS from Maine, 
who will be here shortly, who is also

June 21, 2021 
guide Medicare’s decisions on coverage 
and payment for new technologies to 
improve the lives of people with diabe-
tes. 
I have had the opportunity to see the 
challenges that families with members 
who have type 1 diabetes face. My 
granddaughter, 
my 
oldest 
grand-
daughter, has type 1 diabetes, and I 
know the challenges her family faces 
navigating a complex web of insurance 
coverage rules for technologies. Any-
time a new technology comes out that 
would benefit her, to get the insurance 
companies to adopt those technologies 
is a huge challenge, and it requires 
hours of phone time with the insurance 
company, trying to persuade them that 
they should provide the coverage. 
Well, we know that these insurance 
companies often base their coverage 
and reimbursement rules on Medicare. 
That is why it is so important for the 
Medicare Program to keep pace with 
the development of new diabetes tech-
nologies and devices. 
I appreciate the opportunity to work 
with Senator COLLINS
on a regular 
basis in the Diabetes Caucus. In 2017, 
we were successful in pressing Medi-
care to cover continuous glucose mon-
itors, something that seems like an ob-
vious choice given the difference that 
those CGMs can make for people who 
have diabetes and ensuring that their 
blood sugar stays stable. We have also 
worked together to ensure that Medi-
care provides flexibility so that pa-
tients can use smartphone apps with 
their continuous glucose monitors. 
In the years to come, we need Medi-
care to make progress toward covering 
the artificial pancreas, a landmark de-
velopment that will be the most sig-
nificant change for people with diabe-
tes since insulin was discovered, but to 
do this, we shouldn’t have to resign 
ourselves to this piecemeal approach to 
Medicare coverage that requires con-
tinual pressure from Congress and ad-
vocates. 
We need an independent body, like 
the one that is identified in our legisla-
tion, to help provide recommendations 
to Medicare so that its coverage of new 
technologies can adapt more quickly as 
innovation advances. That is why I am 
proud to be here on the floor and proud 
to join Senator COLLINS
in reintro-
ducing this bill. I hope my colleagues 
will take a look at it, decide that it 
merits passage, and work with us to 
get that done. 
My colleague has arrived on the 
floor. 
Senator COLLINS, I was just saying 
that I was very proud to be able to join 
you in reintroducing this legislation, 
and hopefully this session, we will be 
able to get it done. Thank you for your 
leadership, and I look forward to hear-
ing your comments and to working to 
get this passed. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, first, 
let me thank my colleague from New 
Hampshire, Senator SHAHEEN, for her 
extraordinary commitment and leader-
ship as my fellow cochair of the Senate 
Diabetes Caucus. We are introducing a 
bill to improve access to innovative di-
abetes technologies for our seniors and 
other Medicare beneficiaries. Our bill 
would create a special task force at the 
Department of Health and Human 
Services to examine and resolve bar-
riers that seniors face in accessing the 
latest 
diabetes 
management 
tech-
nologies. 
New diabetes technologies, such as 
the artificial pancreas and implantable 
continuous glucose monitoring sys-
tems, allow those who are living with 
diabetes to better manage their gly-
cemic levels, assess needed therapy on 
a timely basis, and adhere better to 
treatment 
regimes. 
These 
techno-
logical advances make diabetes easier 
to manage and therefore improve the 
health of people with diabetes. 
The market arrival of cutting-edge 
diabetes technologies is something we 
all celebrate; however, oftentimes we 
are finding that patients do not realize 
the full benefits because many of our 
Nation’s seniors find the new tech-
nologies to be difficult or impossible 
for them to afford. 
I have heard from numerous seniors 
who, when transitioning from em-
ployer-provided insurance to Medicare, 
were shocked to learn that the tech-
nologies they had relied upon for years 
to manage their diabetes are no longer 
covered because they now have lost 
their 
employer-provided 
insurance, 
which did cover these technologies, and 
instead are being covered by Medicare. 
For example, one Mainer unfortunately 
had to face the reality that Medicare’s 
coverage denial of a particular sensor 
that he needed for his insulin pump 
meant paying up to $8,000 out-of-pocket 
each year if he wants to continue with 
his current treatment. He wrote: 
Because I am now 65, I am denied care that 
was available when I was 64. 
He continued: 
This approach not only puts me at risk but 
is quite likely not cost effective. While the 
sensors are expensive, the cost of ambulance 
calls and hospitalizations . . . is certainly 
more. 
I could not say it better. It makes no 
sense for this individual, who has aged 
into the Medicare system, to lose cov-
erage that he had and relied upon and 
used successfully to control his diabe-
tes. 
To better support the adoption of 
these technologies, our bill would re-
quire HHS to create a special task 
force on coverage and payment for in-
novative diabetes technologies that 
would bring all stakeholders—from pa-
tients to device manufacturers, to gov-
ernment officials and healthcare pro-
fessionals who are making coverage de-
cisions—to the table. The task force 
would identify and plan for changes in 
Medicare coverage and payment poli-
cies to ensure that Medicare bene-
ficiaries have access to the latest 
treatments, to the innovations that are 
currently available, as well as those 
that are in the pipeline. The task force 
would also be tasked with developing 
strategies for supporting adoption of 
these technologies. 
This effort builds on our past advo-
cacy to improve the day-to-day life of 
individuals with diabetes. In January 
2017, in response to the bipartisan ef-
fort that Senator SHAHEEN and I have 
led, CMS first approved the use of con-
tinuous glucose monitors. We also suc-
cessfully urged CMS last year to sup-
port the use of smartphone apps in con-
junction with continuous glucose mon-
itors. These are proven lifesaving de-
vices that are relied upon by people 
with diabetes to provide them with 
realtime measurements of their glu-
cose levels. This information is key to 
preventing costly—sometimes deadly— 
diabetes complications. 
While I am pleased that our advocacy 
has helped spur these policy changes, I 
remain frustrated that too often Medi-
care lags behind commercial insurers. 
Greater adoption of these new diabetes 
techniques can help address the explo-
sive growth in the financial and human 
toll of diabetes. Diabetes accounts for 
an extraordinary one-in-three dollars 
in Medicare spending. It is paramount 
that we encourage HHS to adopt a 
more cost-effective and compassionate 
approach to treating this chronic dis-
ease that affects more than 30 million 
Americans. 
The Improving Medicare Beneficiary 
Access to Innovative Diabetes Tech-
nologies Act encourages a proactive ap-
proach to diabetes coverage and pay-
ment. I encourage my colleagues to 
support our efforts. 
Again, thanks to my partner Senator 
SHAHEEN
for her leadership in this 
area.

Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, if 
there is no further business to come be-
fore the Senate, I ask it stand ad-
journed under the previous order, fol-
lowing the remarks of Senator WHITE-
HOUSE. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

FOR THE PEOPLE ACT OF 2021 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, I want to speak briefly this 
evening about S. 1, the Senate version 
of H.R. 1, the democracy reform bill 
that we are going to be considering 
moving to proceed to this week, and I 
hope we will be able to show a unified 
Democratic Caucus moving to proceed. 
It is often described as the voting 
rights bill, and it is described that way 
with good justification because there 
are some very, very important protec-
tions that are built into it to protect 
the voting rights of Americans which 
are under, I would say, a unique and 
historic threat now since the, perhaps, 
1950s and 1960s, when the Voting Rights 
Act was passed and some of the levers 
that were pulled to keep certain people 
from voting had to be stopped and the 
vote and the ballot became available 
much more broadly and led to a much 
more just society. 
But that is not the only part of S. 1. 
In fact, in my view, it is not even the 
central part of S. 1. In my view, the 
central part of S. 1 is getting big, un-
limited, anonymous money out of poli-
tics. 
Now, the two relate because the big, 
anonymous money schemers that are 
up to no good in politics are focusing 
on—guess what? Voter suppression. 
And, in fact, the same individual, the 
same person who was running the dark 
money scheme to control and capture 
the Supreme Court and the circuit 
courts 
has—after 
being 
somewhat 
blown up by a Washington Post expose 
about the $250 million he was running 
in dark money through this court-cap-
ture scheme—jumped from court-cap-
ture scheme, and where did he land? On 
something rather ironically called the 
Honest Elections Project, which imme-
diately went to work to file lawsuits 
and harass election officials and try to 
make sure that voter suppression took 
place. 
If you think that is a coincidence, 
the Honest Elections Project is actu-
ally a rebrand of an entity that was 
called the Judicial Education Project— 
basically, just a name change through 
corporate hijinks. And that Judicial 
Education Project is the corporate sib-
ling of something called the Judicial 
Crisis Network. 
And guess what the Judicial Crisis 
Network did? For this same guy, before 
he jumped to voter suppression, when 
he was still doing court capture, the 
Judicial Crisis Network took the big, 
fat checks that anonymous donors 
wrote to pay for the TV campaigns— 
the 
dark 
money 
TV 
campaigns— 
against Garland and for Gorsuch in the 
first 
appointment, 
for 
Kavanaugh 
through all of his troubles in the sec-
ond appointment, and then for Judge 
Barrett on the eve of the election in 
the third appointment. 
So, you see, it is the same person and 
the same organizational connection be-
tween the court-captured dark money 
scheme and the voter suppression dark 
money scheme. It is actually hap-
pening in kind of plain light of day, ex-
cept that we don’t pay enough atten-
tion to the links. 
So this dark money business, getting 
the big, dark money out of politics, is 
a big, big deal. And I wanted to share 
how much of a deal it is to Americans. 
Dark money corruption polls at the top 
of all the issues in the last poll I saw. 
It is the No. 1 issue. If you ask people: 
If somebody says that they have dedi-
cated themselves to fighting corrup-
tion, is that going to make you more 
likely to vote for them or more likely 
for you to vote for their opponent? 
Among all voters, it is 89 to 1 more 
likely to vote for the candidate dedi-
cated to fighting corruption versus 
whoever this one is who said, no, not 
such a big deal to me. 
Among independent voters whom the 
two parties always fight for in elec-
tions, 82 to 2—82 percent of inde-
pendent voters would be more likely to 
vote for somebody who they see as 
dedicated to fighting corruption, and 
only 2 would be more likely to vote for 
their opponent. 
So this is a strong public signal that 
we are sick of it. And you see it over 
and over again. This is one poll. You 
can go through poll after poll after 
poll, and you see people want the dark 
money out of politics. They think we 
are controlled by big special interests. 
They think much too much stuff gets 
done behind the scenes. 
And, by the way, we just got a little 
window into the private conversations 
about this that take place between the 
Koch brothers’ political apparatus and 
our minority leader, MITCH
MCCON-
NELL’s political apparatus. 
Jane Mayer wrote about this re-
cently in the New Yorker. And the 
Koch political apparatus and the MITCH 
MCCONNELL
political apparatus were 
being briefed on this bill, on S. 1, and 
on these provisions. And what they 
were told by the pollster is: Do you 
know what? We are in big trouble be-
cause our conservative voters hate this 
damn dark money stuff just as badly as 
those liberals do, and we have tried all 
these different ways to reframe this, to 
make it look bad so they might be 
more against it—none of it worked. 
None of it worked. 
People 
want 
their 
government 
cleaned up. They are sick to death of 
big special interest money, and they 
are particularly sick to death of big 
special interest money that hides be-
hind fake front groups. So it is not 
ExxonMobil or Marathon Petroleum 
that comes to Rhode Island and says, 
SHELDON WHITEHOUSE is a bum, you 
should vote against him. No, it is under 
the phony group with a name like 
Rhode Islanders for Peace and Puppies 
in Prosperity. And all they are is a 
mail drop. 
Somebody is behind them, and the 
voters know in Rhode Island there is 
no Rhode Islanders for Peace and Pup-
pies in Prosperity. They know they are 
being had, and they are sick of seeing 
the ads. And it is not fair to them, as 
citizens, to not know what is going on 
in the American governmental process, 
going on right in front of them. 
And it matters to them. It really 
matters to them. It is the single most 
important issue for 55 percent of all 
voters. And among the independent 
voters we are trying to attract to our 
separate parties, 58 percent of inde-
pendent voters, this question of Big 
Money corruption and government not 
listening to them, it is the single most 
important issue—the single most im-
portant issue. 
Now, make it top three, expand the 
question. What are the top three most 
important issues that you care about? 
Eighty-nine percent of all voters have 
this in their top three. Eighty-eight 
percent of independent voters have this 
in their top three. So let’s say you 
have a real concern about healthcare, 
or let’s say you have a real concern 
about voting rights, or let’s say you 
have a real concern about the econ-
omy—never mind, this is still there in 
that top three for pretty much 9 out of 
every 10 Americans. 
And what is the level of concern? 
Very concerned. Very concerned is 86 
percent of all voters and 92 percent of 
all independent voters. About this 
issue of corruption and money in poli-
tics, how concerned are you? Eighty- 
six percent of all voters said very. 
Ninety-two percent of independent vot-
ers said very. 
And if you say: OK, let’s, again, ex-
pand the aperture a little, very con-
cerned or somewhat concerned? Are 
you very concerned or somewhat con-
cerned about this dark money corrup-
tion, special interest pressure in gov-
ernment—98 percent of all voters, 100 
percent of independent voters. I don’t 
know about you all, but I have looked 
at a lot of polling in my life. Seeing a 
100-percent number, that is rare. Every 
single independent voter polled is very 
or somewhat concerned about corrup-
tion in our democracy. 
So I can’t wait to get onto S. 1. And 
if our Republican friends want to fili-
buster it and stop us from moving for-
ward, I can’t wait to see them explain

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4660 
June 21, 2021 
to their voters back home why they 
made the choice to come here and, 
against 89 to 1 for all voters and 82 to 
2 for independent voters, take that 
brave fan for dark money and more 
corruption and more special interest 
pressure in our politics. Good luck with 
that. 
I hope at some point we bring that 
fight to the floor and we spend weeks 
on it so that as we go into next year, 
every single American has seen this 
play out. They have seen that this 
issue that they are very concerned 
about, that for more than half of them 
is the single most important issue, 
that there is a party here in the Senate 
that is determined to protect the 
schemers, the special interests behind 
the dark money corruption. Good luck 
taking that to the voters in November. 
So to those who are listening and 
who are thinking: You know, I don’t 
see how we get around a filibuster here. 
I love S. 1. This is a really important 
bill. We have to get there. We hope 
that the Democrats can unite on this, 
but even then, it is only 50 to 1 or 51 to 
1, if the Vice President is allowed to 
vote, and that is not 60, so there is a 
filibuster—my answer is: Give it effort 
and give it time because once Ameri-
cans—everybody from a Tea Partyer to 
a Bernie Bro—gets wind of which party 
in here is the party of special-interest 
dark money, who wants to protect 
that—like I said, single most impor-
tant issue. People go into the voting 
booth, and they tend to remember the 
single most important issue, the issue 
that they are very concerned about, 
that 86 percent of all voters. 
So I hope we find a good way forward. 
I think it is important for our democ-
racy that the rottenness of all of this 
come to an end. I don’t want to see 
more of these academic studies that 
show that Congress listens to big spe-
cial interests, provably, statistically, 
and Congress doesn’t listen to regular 
voters, provably, statistically, because 
of this kind of dark money pressure. 
We have got to get beyond that. We 
have a country out there to put back 
on its feet not only economically, but 
we ought to be able to hold our own 
heads high about having an honest gov-
ernment that is an example to the rest 
of the world. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor.

RECOGNIZING CHIEF KENNY 
STEVENS 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 21, 2021 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of Chief Kenny Stevens 
as he retires from an outstanding career with 
the Stinson Beach Fire Department, spanning 
five decades of providing emergency re-
sponse, rescue services, and peace of mind 
for residents and visitors. 
Chief Stevens moved to Stinson beach in 
1966. After his father joined the Stinson Beach 
Fire Department, Chief Stevens joined the de-
partment as a junior firefighter and later be-
came an official volunteer at the age of 16. 
Even while enlisted in the U.S. Navy, Chief 
Stevens still participated in drills when visiting 
home. After his discharge from military serv-
ice, Chief Stevens returned to the Department 
as an assistant fire chief and was later pro-
moted to lead the organization. 
From responding to the Grand Hotel fire in 
1971 to being first on scene to a building ex-
plosion last summer, Chief Stevens’ has 
served the public with courage and profes-
sionalism. Chief Stevens built a reputation as 
a strong mentor who prioritized training and 
professional development. He created oppor-
tunities for young volunteers to run drills, en-
sured they earned certifications, and helped 
them establish careers with other depart-
ments. Chief Stevens also raised funds for an 
annex building to supplement the Depart-
ment’s resources. With tourism steadily in-
creasing over the years, having Chief Stevens’ 
leadership to keep both the local community 
and visiting beachgoers safe has been invalu-
able to public safety. 
Madam Speaker, I respectfully ask that you 
join me in extending congratulations on Chief 
Steven’s well-deserved retirement and in ex-
pressing our deepest appreciation for Chief 
Stevens’ many years of service to residents of 
West Marin.

INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT 
OF COLUMBIA NON-DISCRIMINA-
TION HOME RULE ACT OF 2021 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 21, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the District of Columbia Non-Discrimi-
nation Home Rule Act of 2021, which would 
end the unique applicability of the Religious 
Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA) to 
the District of Columbia. My bill would protect 
the District’s right to self-govemment, ensuring 
the District is treated the same as states, and 
defend LGBTQ and reproductive rights in D.C. 
RFRA, which provides more protection for 
religious exercise than the First Amendment 
requires, applies to the federal government, 
the D.C. government and the territorial govern-
ments, but not to state governments. As 
RFRA does not apply to the states, under the 
principles of home rule, it should likewise not 
apply to the District. 
While RFRA was designed to be a shield to 
protect religious freedom, it is being used, as 
evidenced by the Supreme Court’s 2014 
Hobby Lobby decision, as a sword to discrimi-
nate against the LGBTQ community and 
women. Members of Congress have used 
RFRA as a justification for trying—but failing— 
to overturn D.C. anti-discrimination laws. 
House Republicans have repeatedly tried 
since 2015 to nullify or block the District’s Re-
productive 
Health 
Non-Discrimination 
Act 
(RHNDA), which prohibits employers from dis-
criminating against employees and their fami-
lies based on reproductive health decisions, 
claiming, in part, that it violates RFRA. How-
ever, it appears that no one has challenged 
RHNDA’s legality under RFRA in court. 
My bill ensures that District residents are 
treated the same as residents of the states 
under RFRA. I strongly urge my colleagues to 
support this bill.

TRIBUTE TO DONALD GALLEANO 
HON. KEN CALVERT 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 21, 2021 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and pay tribute to my one of my very 
best friends, Donald Galleano, who passed 
away unexpectedly on Wednesday, June 2, 
2021. Don was a true leader and a larger- 
than-life member of our community who will be 
deeply missed. 
Don was born and raised in Mira Loma’s 
Wineville area of Jurupa Valley, where his 
family has owned and operated the Galleano 
Winery since 1927. After earning an associate 
degree from Riverside Community College in 
1972 and studying business administration at 
San Jose State University, Don would join the 
family business and eventually become presi-
dent of the winery. Under Don’s leadership, 
through his hard work, entrepreneurship and 
passion for winemaking, the winery experi-
enced significant growth, success, and pro-
duced several award-winning wines. Thanks to 
his dedication to upholding the traditions of his 
family, the Galleano Winery is one of the last 
remaining bonded, Prohibition-era winery still 
owned and operated by its founding family at 
its original location in the region. 
In 2004, Don was elected to represent the 
Eastvale, Jurupa Valley and Norco commu-
nities on the Western Municipal Water Dis-
trict’s Board of Directors. He represented our 
region on the Metropolitan Water District of 
Southern California board and the Chino Basin 
Watermaster board. Don was previously a 
member of the Jurupa Community Services 
District board and served on the National Or-
ange Show Foundation board and the Los An-
geles County Fair Association board. He was 
also a past president of the Western Riverside 
County Businessman’s Association and the 
Jurupa Chamber of Commerce. 
In addition to his wife, Charlene, Don is sur-
vived 
by 
his 
children 
Gina 
(Galleano) 
Spraggins and husband Scott Spraggins, 
Annamarie Galleano Metter and husband 
Cody Metter, and Domenic Galleano and wife 
Brittanee Galleano; as well as grandchildren 
Matthew 
Michael 
Spraggins, 
Ryan 
Scott 
Spraggins, Gracie Marie Spraggins, Baylee 
Marie Spraggins, Sophie Marie Metter, Sadie 
Marie Metter, and Lucca Domenico Galleano. 
I extend my heartfelt condolences to the 
Galleano family, his friends, and everyone for-
tunate enough to know Don. Although he may 
be gone, the many contributions Don made to 
his community and family will have a lasting 
impact. Don was understandably proud of his 
family, his wine, and his community. I was 
proud to call him my friend.

SUPPORT 
FOR 
REPEAL 
OF 
AU-
THORIZATION OF USE OF MILI-
TARY FORCE 
SPEECH OF 
HON. ANDY BIGGS 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 17, 2021 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of H.R. 256, the repeal of the Authoriza-
tion for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Res-
olution of 2002. For too long, Congress has 
abrogated its Constitutional obligation to de-
clare war. The founding fathers knew that the 
executive branch was the most prone to war. 
That is why they gave Congress the power to 
declare war. By assigning this power to Con-
gress, our founders ensured that issues of war 
would be properly debated before our brave 
service members are sent into harm’s way. 
We have allowed Presidents of both parties 
to disregard the proper Constitutional order 
and engage in forever wars. This AUMF has 
been in place for nearly 20 years and the situ-
ation in Iraq is vastly different than at its 
onset. Allowing the AUMF to remain in place 
will not make America safer. However, it will 
allow for the President to keep us in a state 
of perpetual war. 
Repealing the AUMF will not endanger our 
troops overseas. However, repealing the 
AUMF will begin the process of restoring Con-
gress to its proper role of deciding when our 
country goes to war. This Congress, or any fu-
ture, must be a part of any decision to re-
engage in hostilities in Iraq. 
In Congress does not find the courage 
stand up to the President and say, ‘‘No Mr. 
President, we decided when to go to war,’’ 
then thousands of young lives will be lost in 
unconstitutional wars. It is time for Congress 
to reassert itself over war powers and restore 
the proper Constitutional order.

HONORING AL ARAMBURU 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 21, 2021 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in celebration of the life of Al Aramburu, 
who passed away on May 11, 2021 at the age 
of 87. Al was a remarkable community leader 
who spent decades building bipartisan con-
sensus and protecting the North Bay’s natural 
resources. 
Al was born on February 16, 1934 in East 
Los Angeles. After finishing high school, he 
answered the call to serve our country in the 
U.S. Army from 1953 to 1956. Al graduated 
from California State University Northridge in 
1960. He later moved to the Bay Area as a 
manager for Pacific Telephone and began his 
career in local government as a volunteer on 
Tiburon’s Parks, Open Space and Trails Com-
mission. 
Al was a strong advocate for Marin’s vibrant 
Latino community and a champion for sound 
environmental policy while serving as Mayor of 
Tiburon and during his three terms on the 
Marin County Board of Supervisors. He led a 
successful campaign for a ballot measure op-
posing offshore oil drilling in Marin and helped 
create the Richardson’s Bay Regional Agency 
to advance cleanup and rehabilitation prior-
ities. To preserve an area of landmass for 
seals haulingout in Richardson’s Bay, Al had 
a 17-acre section separated from Strawberry 
Spit, now known as Aramburu Island. Al’s 
leadership also helped to designate Tiburon’s 
Ring Mountain preserve, establish McKegney 
Green and protect Horse Hill in Mill Valley. Al 
was also a leader in the nonprofit sector and 
volunteered his time and talents to the Mill 
Valley Film Festival, Teatro Campesino, La 
Familia Center of Marin, and the Hispanic 
Chamber of Commerce among others. 
With his favorite adage ‘‘good government is 
boring government,’’ Al was known as a clas-
sic workhorse public servant who measured 
successes by bringing people together. His 
thoughtfulness, compassion and hard work 
ethic demonstrated all the right qualities of a 
good leader. Friends, family, and colleagues 
loved Al for his wit, deadpan sense of humor, 
and propensity to pick up a guitar and sing. 
Al leaves a legacy to be revered. His many 
years of hard work made a lasting positive im-
pact on the North Bay’s people, places, and 
wildlife. Al Aramburu is survived by his wife, 
Margit Hind; siblings Ray, Henry and Angela; 
children Bert and Katie; stepson Jackie; and 
four grandchildren. Madam Speaker, I respect-
fully ask that you join me in extending condo-
lence to Al’s family and friends and in ex-
pressing our deep appreciation for Al’s ex-
traordinary career and life.
