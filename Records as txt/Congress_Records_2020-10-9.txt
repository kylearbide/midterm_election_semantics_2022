PRAYER 
Pastor 
Zack 
Randles, 
Waterfront 
Church, Washington, D.C., offered the 
following prayer: 
God, we come before You today as a 
nation staring into a fog of uncer-
tainty. With less than a month to the 
election and a global pandemic compli-
cating just about every aspect of life, 
may we remember today that the in-
tensity of the present will not last for-
ever. Our struggles, though very real 
and all-consuming, are only for a sea-
son. While it is day, may we tirelessly 
work to complete the task that You 
have set before us. God, give us the 
tools we need to humbly lead, listen, 
and strengthen those around us. Let us 
speak with wise words laced with cour-
age and faith so that when the fog is 
lifted, we do not need to feel ashamed 
of these days. It is in the name of Jesus 
we ask these things. 
Amen.

SAVE OUR SEAS 2.0 ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. HALEY M. STEVENS 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 1, 2020 
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of S. 1982, Save Our Seas 2.0, and to 
commend my colleagues for their work to re-
solve the serious issues our country and our 
world have with marine debris. 
For over 70 years, plastic has evolved to be 
invaluable in many applications. It’s used as a 
high-performance material for medical devices 
and in safety components for automobiles. 
Plastic is also convenient. It’s a mainstay in 
American households from our toothbrushes 
to food storage to shampoo and detergent bot-
tles. Global plastic production increased from 
2 million tons per year in 1950 to 400 million 
tons annually in recent years. 
What happens to all of this discarded plastic 
is why I am speaking out in support of this 
legislation today. We can no longer deny that 
we face a plastic waste crisis. There are plen-
ty of reasons for why and how we got here; 
however, a major factor is because we failed 
as a nation to invest in domestic recycling in-
frastructure and policies to account for the 
growing demand for plastic. As a result, today, 
the U.S. recycles just 9 percent of its plastic 
waste. 
At least 8 million tons of plastic end up in 
our oceans and Great Lakes every year and 
make up 80 percent of all marine debris from 
surface waters to deep-sea sediments. This 
marine debris ends up being ingested or en-
tangled by marine life, from whales to sea 
birds, causing severe injuries and death. 
In addition to the harm it causes our marine 
ecosystem, plastic debris also endangers our 
human health, coastal tourism, and threatens 
our food safety. This important bill works to 
improve the domestic response to marine de-
bris, incentivize international engagement on 
marine debris, and strengthen domestic waste 
management infrastructure to prevent the cre-
ation of new marine debris. 
This crisis will not be solved by only one bill 
or another. We need to work together as a 
Congress on bicameral, bipartisan solutions 
that have the potential to create jobs, develop 
supply chains, and meet environmental needs. 
This summer, I was proud to introduce the 
bipartisan Plastic Waste Reduction and Recy-
cling Act which directs the establishment of a 
plastic waste reduction and recycling research 
and development program to develop a world- 
leading U.S. industry in advanced plastics re-
cycling technologies, and unleash the innova-
tive potential of our nation to address our plas-
tic waste crisis and generate greater value 
from the plastics we do produce. 
I would like to congratulate my colleagues, 
Congresswoman SUZANNE
BONAMICI, Con-
gressman DON YOUNG, Senator DAN SULLIVAN, 
and Senator SHELDON WHITEHOUSE, on the 
passage of this historic bill, and I look forward 
to working with them and our colleagues on 
powerful solutions to solve our plastic waste 
crisis.

HONORING THE 100TH 
ANNIVERSARY OF NIXON GEAR 
HON. JOHN KATKO 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 9, 2020 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the 100th Anniversary of Nixon Gear, a 
division of Gear Motions Inc., located in Syra-
cuse, New York. Since its inception, Nixon 
Gear has consistently grown and adapted to 
changing times. Today, Nixon Gear has an im-
peccable reputation, provides good-paying 
jobs for Central New Yorkers, and serves as 
one of the premier custom gear manufacturers 
in the United States. 
In 1920, George Nixon founded Nixon 
Broach and Tool Company with the intention 
of selling special machining and tooling. As 
operations began focusing on gear manufac-
turing, in 1924 the company changed its name 
to Nixon Gear. In 1969, with plastics and elec-
tronics replacing metal gears, Nixon Gear 
adapted again, buying its first gear grinding 
machine to produce these new products. In 
1977, Nixon Gear was purchased by Gear 
Motions, allowing the company to transform 
into a precision gear grinding operation. 
After years of sustained growth and expan-
sion, Nixon Gear outgrew its facility, and in 
1992 moved into a 45,000 square foot, state- 
of-the-art building on Milton Avenue in Syra-
cuse. The move empowered Nixon Gear to 
improve its efficiency, and grow its operations, 
and invest in new precision gear grinding. 
Over the years, Nixon Gear has evolved in-
ternally as well. The company has gone 
through changes in ownership, and today is 
led by Dean Burrows, President of Nixon Gear 
and Gear Motions. In 2010, Gear Motions be-
came a 100% Employee Owned Company, al-
lowing its employees to have a larger role in 
the direction of the business. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
in the House join me in honoring the 100th 
Anniversary of Nixon Gear. By continuing to 
evolve and grow, Nixon Gear today is an in-
dustry leader and a vital part of Central New 
York’s local economy.

RECOGNIZING CHARLES AND 
MADDIE FINKENBINDER 
HON. J. FRENCH HILL 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 9, 2020 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam Speaker, 
today I rise to recognize eight-year-old Maddie 
Finkenbinder and her father, Charles, who are 
working hard to provide reusable water bottles 
to students across Conway, AR elementary 
schools. 
When water fountains were disabled to stop 
the spread of the coronavirus in schools, 
Maddie went straight to her jewelry box to col-
lect all her allowance and gave it to her father 
to purchase water bottles for her classmates. 
Since then, their work has grown, providing 
water bottles to five elementary schools in 
Conway, and the educators and administrators 
of Conway Public Schools are thankful. 
Charles and Maddie show the true heart of 
CPSD and the Conway community. 
I’d like to thank the Finkenbinders for their 
honorable work and encourage them to keep 
looking out for their neighbor.

HONORING SHELLEY MCKITTRICK 
HON. JASON CROW 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 9, 2020 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, it is my honor 
today to recognize the accomplishments of 
Ms. Shelley McKittrick and to congratulate her 
on her retirement. 
Throughout her career, Ms. McKittrick has 
dedicated herself to public service and has 
been a tireless advocate for those experi-
encing homelessness and housing instability. 
She served as the City of Aurora’s Homeless-
ness Program Director and led a pathway for 
prioritizing the need for homelessness and 
housing instability solutions. In her role, she 
was instrumental to the opening of the Aurora 
Day Resource Center providing 150 people 
per day with meals, showers, counseling serv-
ices, and other resources. She also served as 
the President of the Metro Denver Homeless 
Initiative for a year and continues to hold a 
seat on the Board. 
She also led the way for Aurora’s Point in 
Time count, an annual U.S. Housing and 
Urban Development effort to account for the 
number of people in the nation experiencing 
homelessness. Her work not only gave hous-
ing to those directly impacted by homeless-
ness in Aurora, but also strengthened numer-
ous programs to help prioritize a change in 
how housing instability is handled. 
During an interview in 2016 when Ms. 
McKittrick had just started her work in Aurora, 
she said homelessness is, ‘‘a large problem 
that has to be broken down into digestible, 
attackable pieces. And little by little . . . we 
can do this.’’ 
In the 4 years she was with Aurora and 
through countless hours of meaningful work, 
Ms. McKittrick proved her statement from 
2016 true and showed our city that we can 
make efforts to beat homelessness. I wish her 
luck in this new chapter of her life and thank 
her greatly for the care and dedication she 
provided our community.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E936 
October 9, 2020 
IN RECOGNITION OF SPRINGFIELD, 
MASSACHUSETTS PARKS DIREC-
TOR PATRICK SULLIVAN 
HON. RICHARD E. NEAL 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 9, 2020 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I would like to 
take this opportunity to congratulate Patrick 
Sullivan, Parks Director for the City of Spring-
field, Massachusetts, for being honored with a 
Lifetime Achievement Environmental Merit 
Award from the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency. I would like to include in the RECORD 
two articles from the Springfield Republican 
that highlights his achievements. Pat’s out-
standing career deserves the highest praise 
for his continued efforts to implement environ-
mentally cognizant initiatives that benefit both 
our environment and thousands of local resi-
dents. 
[From the Springfield Republican] 
SPRINGFIELD PARKS DIRECTOR PATRICK SUL-
LIVAN
RECEIVES
LIFETIME
ACHIEVEMENT 
AWARD FROM U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTEC-
TION AGENCY 
(By Peter Goonan) 
City Parks and Buildings Director Patrick 
J. Sullivan did his best to share the credit 
with others as he was honored last week with 
a lifetime achievement environmental merit 
award from the U.S. Environmental Protec-
tion Agency. 
I was just very honored and humbled when 
I got the call from the EPA that the mayor 
had nominated me for this award and they 
had chosen me, Sullivan said, during an 
interview with The Republican at his office 
at Forest Park. I always had an interest in 
the field of horticulture and the environment 
and as I progressed, I tried to make decisions 
that are basically going to be in the best in-
terest of our environment and for our resi-
dents. 
Sullivan said credit needs to go to Mayor 
Domenic J. Sarno for supporting Going 
Green initiatives, and to municipal employ-
ees for the focus on environmental protec-
tion and energy efficiency related to city 
parks, open space and buildings. 
Beyond protecting parks, the city con-
tinues a major, multi-year effort to improve 
energy efficiency in city and school build-
ings, having resulted in a 30 percent decrease 
in energy use in city buildings since 2007, 
Sullivan said. 
Sullivan said he is perhaps most proud of 
the organic lawn care program in the city, in 
which the city has reduced the use of syn-
thetic fertilizers in city fields and parks, by 
replacing them with organic products. The 
synthetic fertilizers have chemicals that 
leach into the groundwater and ultimately 
enter the rivers and streams, he said. 
Sullivan continues to work on developing 
plans for a public education program on the 
impacts of synthetic fertilizers, officials 
said. 
The EPA summary said that Sarno, in 
nominating 
Sullivan 
described 
Patrick’s 
steadfast work to build an environmentally 
friendly community. 
Sullivan, a Springfield native and resident, 
has worked for 33 years for the city including 
as director of parks, buildings and recreation 
management. 
During his career, Sullivan has spear-
headed more than $80 million in park con-
struction projects, has helped improve ponds 
and lakes, and has overseen more than $500 
million in school renovation projects includ-
ing roofs, windows, boilers and environ-
mental management systems, the summary 
said. 
Sarno, in a prepared release, congratulated 
Sullivan on a well-earned and deserved life-
time achievement award. He called Sullivan 
his point person on Going Green initiatives 
in Springfield. 
‘‘Pat has always been my ’Green Person,’ ’’ 
Sarno said. His visionary and practical lead-
ership has not only been good for our envi-
ronment, but also the bottom line of our 
budget too. 
Sullivan said that working within Forest 
Park is a dream job in itself. He recalled 
that when he began with the department, the 
current rose garden area was just a ‘‘sunk-
en’’ ground that would fill with water. It was 
restored to its current beauty, he said. 
Some of the buildings were deteriorated 
and in jeopardy years ago including the Bar-
ney Carriage House and old Forest Park Zoo 
building. The carriage house was fully ren-
ovated and the old zoo building is planned as 
a horticultural learning center. 
Sullivan was one of nine people in New 
England, including three people in Massa-
chusetts who received the EPA’s 2020 Envi-
ronmental Merit Award—Lifetime Achieve-
ment award for his dedication and support of 
the environment. 
Others receiving the Lifetime Achievement 
award 
in 
Massachusetts 
were 
Margaret 
VanDeusen of Boston, and the late Barbara 
Cianfarini of Pittsfield. 
The recipients were honored by teleconfer-
ence, due to the coronavirus, with Sullivan 
and Sarno taking part. Those in on remote 
video call included U.S. Environmental Pro-
tection Agency Regional Administrator Den-
nis Deziel, and the Massachusetts Depart-
ment of Environmental Protection Commis-
sioner Martin Suuberg. 
[From the Springfield Republican] 
U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL
PROTECTION
AGENCY 
RECOGNITION OF SPRINGFIELD PARKS DIREC-
TOR PATRICK J. SULLIVAN ON THE MARK 
(By The Republican Editorials) 
More cites and town throughout the U.S. 
are taking a proactive, measured and coordi-
nated stance toward protecting the environ-
ment. As a result, Going Green initiatives 
have been cropping up to study how power is 
generated and analyzing energy management 
systems within municipal buildings and 
schools. The goal, of course, is to make up-
grades and create improvements. 
Larger cities, including Chicago, have no-
table goals. Mayor Lori Lightfoot has em-
barked on a sustainable energy program 
within the city to power all city-owned 
buildings with renewable energy by 2035. 
Springfield has also been aggressive in 
partnering with private companies and non- 
profit agencies to develop measures to cut 
down on energy usage. With its Climate Ac-
tion and Resilience Plan, the city has con-
ducted building-by-building surveys to iden-
tify areas where improvements to power gen-
eration, air quality and lighting that will 
not only cut down on carbon emissions but 
save the city millions of dollars. 
As a point person in Springfield’s Going 
Green initiatives, City Parks and Building 
Director Patrick J. Sullivan is instrumental 
in working with a variety of groups to lead 
studies and identify and create carbon emis-
sion reduction goals. It is notable and com-
mendable that Sullivan was recently hon-
ored by the Environmental Protection Agen-
cy with a lifetime achievement merit award 
for his multi-year effort to improve energy 
efficiency. Sullivan, who has worked for the 
city for the past 33 years, was one of nine 
people in New England and three in Massa-
chusetts who received the EPA’s 2020 award. 
Springfield Mayor Domenic J. Sarno said of 
Sullivan, his visionary and practical leader-
ship has not only been good for our environ-
ment, but also the bottom line of our budget, 
too. 
As a result of a multi-year effort to im-
prove energy efficiency, the city as experi-
enced a 30% decrease in city buildings since 
2007. 
According to Sullivan, one his proudest 
achievements is the organic lawn care pro-
gram in which the city has reduced the use 
of synthetic fertilizers in city fields, replac-
ing them with organic products, thus pro-
tecting rivers and streams from toxic runoff. 
Coordination at the local government level 
to form partnerships with the business com-
munity and other agencies to identify and 
study energy use and develop conservation 
measures is vital to help reduce carbon emis-
sions. Large and small cites all have role to 
play. Having an experienced, dedicated per-
son leading these efforts, such as Sullivan, 
can only get us closer to building an environ-
mentally friendly community.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF REV. 
LONNIE WESLEY OAKS 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 9, 2020 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life of Rev. W.L. 
Oaks, who passed away on August 7 in Ox-
ford, Mississippi. 
Born on September 26, 1922, in Lafayette 
County, Mississippi, Lonnie grew up on a farm 
before joining the Civilian Conservation Corps 
at Camp Wall Doxey. He married his child-
hood sweetheart Frances Paralee Foster in 
1941, who he remained married to for 68 
years until her death in 2009. From there, 
Lonnie joined the United States Army and 
served his country proudly during the second 
World War. While fighting the Axis Forces in 
Italy, Lonnie received the Bronze Star and 
Purple Heart. 
Upon his return from the war, Lonnie moved 
to Union County, Mississippi, where he began 
preaching at Glenfield Baptist Church. Soon 
after, he decided to continue his education at 
Clarke College and Blue Mountain College for 
pastoral training. He served many churches, 
including County Line Baptist Church, Carey 
Springs Baptist Church, and Golden Central 
Baptist Church, among others. 
Most notably, Lonnie served at Golden Cen-
tral Baptist Church when a devastating fire de-
stroyed it. He lost a lifetime of memorabilia, 
which included his service medals. Although 
devastating, the fire did not devastate Lonnie’s 
spirit, he rebuilt the church and continued to 
serve for many years, becoming known to his 
friends as Brother Oaks. Lonnie continued to 
preach across the nation until he was 97. If he 
were here today, he would tell you: it is well 
with my soul. 
Left to cherish his memory are his children 
Patsy Diane Oak Williams, Linda Grubbs, and 
Lonnie Wesley Oaks, Jr.; brother, Dalton 
Oaks; his grandchildren, his great-grand-
children, as well as many other friends and 
extended family members.

RECOGNIZING LITTLE ROCK VEN-
TURE 
CENTER 
FOR 
BEING 
NAMED BEST ENTERPRISE PAY-
MENTS 
SOLUTION 
AND 
BEST 
FINTECH PARTNERSHIP 
HON. J. FRENCH HILL 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 9, 2020 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam Speaker, 
today I rise to recognize the Venture Center of 
Little Rock who has recently been awarded 
the top prize in the Best Fintech Accelerator/ 
Incubator category at the second annual 
Finovate Awards, an international competition. 
The Venture Center, a nonprofit, bested four 
other finalists chosen by a group of industry 
professionals from around the globe. Along 
with the Venture Center winning the top prize, 
two alumni of the Venture Center’s programs 
received top prizes: The Best Enterprise Pay-
ments Solution and Best Fintech Partnership 
awards. 
The Venture Center has proven what hap-
pens when local people, organizations, and 
entrepreneurs collaborate, and they have 
made Little Rock an epicenter of fintech inno-
vation. I echo Governor Asa Hutchinson, say-
ing, ‘‘The Center’s successes enhance Arkan-
sas’ reputation as a leader in financial tech-
nology and computer science.’’ 
I am extremely proud of what the Venture 
Center is doing in Little Rock and beyond and 
congratulate them on their earned recognition 
at this year’s awards.

COMMUNITY HEROES TRIBUTE 
HON. NYDIA M. VELA´ZQUEZ 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 9, 2020 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute and recognize this year’s 
Community Heroes for their life-time record of 
public service, social activism, and charity. 
2020 will be remembered as one of the most 
unprecedented times in modem history. The 
COVID–19 pandemic has tested us and for-
ever changed our lives. It has exposed our 
vulnerabilities but has also given rise to count-
less community heroes who, amid their own 
personal challenges, demonstrate courage 
and resilience. 
I am honored to congratulate this year’s ex-
traordinary Lower East Side recipients of 
CODA’s Community Hero Awards. Their serv-
ice is immeasurable, and the residents of my 
district are enriched and strengthened by their 
contributions. 
Camille Napoleon, Vice-President of the Ba-
ruch Houses Tenants Association and a dedi-
cated lifetime resident of the New York’s City’s 
Loisaida community and Baruch Houses. 
When the state issued its stay at home order 
and the pandemic swept the city, Camille 
knew her neighbors and community would 
need help to survive this monumental event. 
Amidst a notable lack of timely response from 
the City at the height of the lockdown, Camille 
and her unstoppable crew of volunteers be-
came a lifeline for residents. Operating six 
days a week, ‘‘Team Camille’’ delivered thou-
sands of emergency meals, food boxes, and 
essential protection supplies to quarantined 
and homebound seniors, unemployed families, 
and other vulnerable individuals throughout 
the Lower East Side’s public housing develop-
ments. Camille’s volunteerism and efforts far 
exceeded expectations. Today, she continues 
to serve her neighbors and exemplify her pas-
sion for the community. 
Eric Diaz, Executive Director of Vision Ur-
bana Inc, Food Pantry program. Vison Urbana 
is a community faith-based led organization 
dedicated to the underserved families of the 
Seward Park Extension and its neighboring 
communities. I recognize Eric Diaz for his 
leadership and service to the community. The 
pandemic not only disrupted lives but also the 
access to the food chain. Constituents in my 
district encountered empty shelves at local 
grocery stores and markets. Food insecurity 
grew to affect a record number of vulnerable 
residents. Eric swiftly worked to secure and in-
crease resources for the program. Under his 
leadership, the food pantry program grew to 
double its distribution and expand its coverage 
area. It delivered prepared meals and boxed 
foods to hundreds of seniors and families in 
need. With his volunteers and partner organi-
zations, Eric and Vision Urbana’s pantry pro-
gram reaffirmed its commitment to its mission 
and humanity. 
Shaheeda Smith, who has devoted her life 
to empowering NYC residents to reclaim their 
wellness through her innovative approach to 
dance and movement therapy. Shaheeda, an 
advocate from Henry Street Settlement’s Com-
munity Advisory Board, teamed up with Henry 
Street and Good Old Lower East Side 
(GOLES), a neighborhood housing and pres-
ervation organization, to create the People’s 
Permit Process, a guide to help community 
members navigate the city’s rules and regula-
tions. When COVID–19 rocked the community 
with biased and violent arrests related to so-
cial-distancing regulations enforcement, this 
civil rights activist interceded. Armed with ex-
tensive knowledge in the constitutional right to 
assemble peacefully, Shaheeda emerged as a 
bold voice for these victims of unwarranted ex-
cessive police force. Journalists and activists 
have documented numerous excessive force 
cases related to protests or simply for not 
wearing a mask. I am proud to know that 
Shaheeda was proactive and recognized that 
these actions are unacceptable. 
Frances Goldin, posthumously, was known 
as ‘‘the Crusader for the Lower East Side’’. 
Frances had an interesting life as a staunch 
lifetime advocate and defender of housing, so-
cial and civil rights. As early as 1959, she 
launched a successful campaign that defeated 
Robert Moses’ urban renewal plan to replace 
affordable housing in the Lower Eastside with 
a freeway. She was a founding member of the 
Metropolitan Council on Housing and was a 
strong defender of the displaced families of 
Seward Park Urban Renewal area. Her activ-
ism was instrumental in ensuring affordable 
housing for seniors at the newly developed 
Essex Crossings. In 2019, the 100-unit senior 
development was named The Goldin in her 
honor. Frances was also a literary agent who 
gave a voice to countless aspiring progressive 
writers who probably never would have their 
works printed without her support. Lastly, 
Frances was a proud advocate and champion 
for the LBGTQ community. She was iconic for 
attending New York City’s Pride Parade. Be-
fore her passing, she was pictured in the pa-
pers at the parade on her wheelchair. Despite 
her unfortunate passing at the peak of the 
pandemic, her legacy lives on through her 
children and the many lives she touched over 
the years. At the time her passing the New 
York Times called her a ‘‘. . . protester, 
provocateur and voice for lost causes.’’ 
Frances was that and more, she was a trail-
blazer and a woman on a lifetime mission for 
justice. The Lower East Side community will 
forever remember Frances Goldin.

HONORING TERRANCE J. FULP, 
PH.D 
HON. GRACE F. NAPOLITANO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 9, 2020 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to recognize Dr. Terrance J. Fulp as he retires 
after more than three decades of federal serv-
ice. We honor Dr. Fulp for his lifetime of public 
service to our country and to the tens of mil-
lions of Americans who rely on the Colorado 
River for water and call the West home. 
For the last eight years, Dr. Fulp has served 
as the Lower Colorado Regional Director for 
the United States Bureau of Reclamation. As 
Regional Director, Dr. Fulp is responsible for 
implementing the Secretary of the Interior’s 
water master functions for the last 350 miles 
of the Colorado River—from Lake Mead to 
Mexico—including operation of the iconic Hoo-
ver Dam. Dr. Fulp brought a level of profes-
sionalism and technical expertise to the basin 
that was only matched by his ability to work 
across state, basin and national boundaries in 
the water sector with multiple stakeholders. 
These stakeholders of States, Tribes, water 
agencies, non-governmental groups—in both 
the U.S. and Mexico—saw a partner in 
Terry—and oftentimes left the negotiating 
table as his friends. He leaves a legacy in the 
basin that future leaders can only aspire to 
reach. 
Dr. Fulp’s tenure has been highlighted by 
his successful efforts in the management of 
the Colorado River. They include the 2007 
Guidelines for Lake Powell and Lake Mead, 
Minutes 319 and 323 to the Mexican Water 
Treaty of 1944, the 2019 Drought Contingency 
Plan across the seven Colorado River Basin 
States, and a Memorandum of Understanding 
on the Salton Sea. I am especially grateful for 
Dr. Fulp’s leadership in ensuring the success 
of the Title XVI Water Reuse and Water Recy-
cling Program. This program has allowed 
many Southern California water agencies to 
invest in infrastructure development that meets 
local water needs, creating nearly 500,000 
acre-feet of water in 2018 alone. 
Madam Speaker, Terry Fulp has been an in-
valuable resource to Members of Congress, 
our staff, and the constituents and water agen-
cies we represent. I ask that our colleagues 
join me in congratulating Dr. Fulp and wish 
him and his wife Nadine a rich and rewarding 
retirement as they head home to Colorado.

RECOGNIZING THE ORANGE COUN-
TY 
VETERANS 
AND 
MILITARY 
FAMILIES COLLABORATIVE 
HON. HARLEY ROUDA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 9, 2020 
Mr. ROUDA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the Orange County Veterans and 
Military Families Collaborative for its out-
standing service to the veterans and military 
families of Orange County, California. This or-
ganization, a commendable group of dedi-
cated professionals and volunteers, embodies 
the spirit of collaboration and demonstrates 
the power of our community to come together 
and solve our toughest challenges. 
Established in 2012 by a small, passionate 
group of Vietnam War Veterans, who an-
swered yet another call of duty, the Collabo-
rative helps to connect veterans, active duty 
and reserve service members, and military 
families across Orange County to quality ben-
efits, services, and community-based opportu-
nities. 
Today, the Collaborative consists of nearly 
120 member organizations, including busi-
nesses, government offices at the federal, 
state and local levels, non-profits, and officials 
from the Veterans Administration. The Col-
laborative serves the Orange County veteran 
community through eleven focus groups— 
dealing with critical topics like homelessness, 
education, and employment—and other ef-
forts, such as a task force that works with 
older veterans. 
The Collaborative works to ensure all vet-
erans have a place to call home by helping 
veterans to secure HUD-VASH benefits and 
by filling the gaps for veterans where federal 
resources are unable to compensate. Their 
Housing Working Group monitors the by-name 
list of homeless veteran populations in Orange 
County and deploys rapid responses to vet-
erans facing homelessness. Their Housing 
Group has also worked to house over 100 vet-
erans and their families over the course of the 
COVID–19 pandemic. 
In addition, the Collaborative has made 
meaningful progress towards addressing the 
tragedy of suicide among our veterans. In 
2019, the Collaborative partnered with Amer-
ica’s Warrior Partnership to conduct Operation 
Deep Dive, a forensic study on the causes of 
veteran suicides and self-harm. Their commit-
ment to finding solutions to these issues re-
minds us of Congress’ own duty and the ur-
gent need to support veteran groups working 
on this issue. 
In 2018, the Collaborative was recognized 
as the Community Veteran Engagement Board 
for Orange County by the U.S. Department of 
Veterans Affairs, deepening their role as an in-
tegral part of the Orange County community. 
I ask all Members join me in honoring the 
Orange County Veterans and Military Families 
Collaborative for their work on behalf of over 
130,000 Orange County veterans and their 
families. 
HONORING JOSE´ ROLANDO 
VILLAREAL, J.D. 
HON. TJ COX 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 9, 2020 
Mr. COX of California. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize Mr. Jose´
Rolando 
Villareal, J.D. whose story of success and 
achievement is a true testament to all that is 
possible here in America. Throughout his life, 
Mr. Villareal has been a shining example of 
the immigrant experience in our country 
through his perseverance, tenacious spirit, and 
service to others. 
Mr. Villareal and his three sisters were born 
to Jose Maria and Elisa Villarreal in the border 
city of Piedras Negras, Coahuila, Mexico and 
immigrated with his family to the United States 
as a young child. The family originally arrived 
in Eagle Pass, Texas then, like so many other 
migrant farmworker families, lived in various 
states following the harvest until eventually 
settling in San Jose, California. There in Sil-
icon Valley, Mr. Villareal was able to become 
the first in his family to attend college. He 
earned his bachelor’s degree from San Jose 
State University and then earned his Juris 
Doctorate from Santa Clara University School 
of Law. 
Mr. Villareal then began his professional ca-
reer in the Central Valley, where he served in 
various capacities focused on improving the 
lives of vulnerable, underserved communities 
in the region. He served as chief public de-
fender in Fresno County for eight years and 
as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the 
California Rural Legal Assistance, an organi-
zation that has transformed the lives of thou-
sands of working families and immigrant com-
munities. Mr. Villareal has also served his 
community as Mayor of Sanger, California, 
where he led efforts to spur economic devel-
opment and strengthen public safety. 
Our history as a nation of immigrants is rich 
with countless stories of struggle and success. 
Like many child immigrants, Mr. Villareal spent 
much of his life striving to secure a foothold in 
our country and achieve the American Dream. 
Though his experiences as an immigrant were 
never easy, he persevered and achieved his 
ultimate goal of successfully gaining U.S. citi-
zenship. Throughout his career, Mr. Villareal 
endeavored to encourage other immigrants to 
strive for this goal and has become a role 
model for his community. 
Mr. Villareal has become a source of pride 
for his wife Enriqueta and their four children 
Rolando, Adrian, Alejandro, and Meliza, who 
have all supported him in sharing the story of 
his life via a published memoir. His lifetime of 
accomplishments has been rooted in his deep 
commitment to service. His dedication to the 
Central Valley’s immigrant community and per-
sonal mission to improve the lives of others 
perfectly exemplifies the virtues of American 
society. 
Madam Speaker it is my privilege to recog-
nize Mr. Villareal and I ask my colleagues to 
join me in celebrating his exemplary commit-
ment to achieving the American Dream.

Friday, October 9, 2020 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam Speaker,

ucator from Woodrow Cummins Elementary in

sociation of American Educators Foundation

ond grade students. Julie’s had great success 
with these kits in the past and receiving more

dented classroom setting. 
I congratulate Julie for receiving this grant,

HONORING THE SERVICE OF 
WILLIAM E. TABOR, JR. 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 9, 2020 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the service of the late 
William E. Tabor Jr., who fought for our coun-
try during World War II. 
William was born to William E. Tabor, Sr. 
and Clara Watts Tabor of Lobutcha. After 
graduating from Lobutcha High School, Wil-
liam joined the Army and was sent to the Phil-
ippine Islands where he was stationed at Clark 
Field, Manila. When the Japanese attacked 
Clark Field, William endured a shrapnel wound 
to the side, which would leave him partially 
disabled for the remainder of his life. 
Even so, William kept fighting and forging 
forward. When the Army moved to the Bataan 
Peninsula as one last stand against the Japa-
nese, William was promoted to corporal and 
would receive the battlefield promotion to Ser-
geant. Sergeant Tabor would spend three 
years and five months as a Prisoner of War to 
the Japanese surviving the infamous Bataan 
Death March and Malaria. 
William was honorably discharged in May of 
1946 and was awarded the Presidential Unit 
Citation with two Oak Leaf Clusters, two 
Bronze Star Medals, the Philippine Defense 
Medal, the Prisoner of War Medal, and many 
other decorations. In April of 2020, as a result 
of his extraordinary service, he was issued his 
third Bronze Star Medal. 
After the war, William returned to Mississippi 
where he married Frances Johnson and had 
four children: the late Charlotte Tabor, William 
E. Tabor III, Brenda Tabor Hunt, and Mary 
Martha Tabor. 
William’s life was one of service, grace, and 
love for his family and community, and his 
commitment to our country will never be for-
gotten.

RECOGNIZING LEROY KREBS 100TH 
BIRTHDAY AND HIS YEARS OF 
SERVICE TO HIS COUNTRY 
HON. SCOTT PERRY 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 9, 2020 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, I’m honored 
to congratulate Leroy Krebs on the occasion 
of his 100th Birthday, and for his years of 
service 
to 
the 
American 
Legion, 
the 
Susquehannock High School, the Common-
wealth of Pennsylvania, and the United States 
of America. 
Mr. Krebs was born on June 17, 1920, in 
Glen Rock, Pennsylvania. He served in the 
United States Army Air Corps from December 
1, 1942 to February 2, 1946, as a bombardier 
instructor for B–24 Bombers. He left active 
service at the rank of First Lieutenant, after 
earning the American Theater Medal and the 
World War II Victory Medal. He served with 
the 2519th Base Unit in Ft Worth, Texas, and 
remained in the United States Air Force Re-
serve until he retired as a Lieutenant Colonel 
upon 38 years of uniformed service. 
He graduated from Temple University, and 
taught and coached basketball at Glen Rock 
(now Susquehannock) High School. He later 
became the school principal, and for 14 years 
worked at the School until retiring in 1978. 
In addition to Leroy’s military service, teach-
ing, coaching and serving as principal, Leroy 
was a Master of the Shrewsbury Masonic 
Lodge and an active member and former com-
mander of Austin Grove Post 455 of the Amer-
ican Legion. Leroy also was a proud member 
of the Glen Rock Carolers for 35 years. 
Today, 
Leroy 
lives 
independently 
at 
Normandie Ridge retirement community. 
I’m truly honored and humbled to congratu-
late Mr. Leroy Krebs on turning 100 Years 
Young, and for his tireless, selfless, dedicated, 
and distinguished service to the American Le-
gion, Susquehannock High School, the Com-
monwealth of Pennsylvania, and the United

CONGRATULATING DR. JOYCE E.

ON 
RECEIVING 
THE 
WORTHEN 
CAREER 
ACHIEVE-
MENT AWARD 
HON. ADAM SMITH 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 9, 2020 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, 
it is my privilege to rise to congratulate Joyce 
E. Wipf, M.D. on receiving the 2020 Worthen 
Career Achievement Award, which recognizes 
her as an outstanding health professions train-
ee education champion whose lifetime con-
tributions have profoundly advanced and im-
pacted the educational mission of the Vet-
erans Health Administration. 
Dr. Wipf is a first-generation college grad-
uate who always wanted to be a teacher. She 
found ways to integrate her passion for teach-
ing with her career in medicine. While com-
pleting her medical residency she began de-
veloping the Resident to Teacher curriculum to 
help second-year residents become better 
educators. Now, nearly 30 years later, Resi-
dent to Teacher programs continue to help 
residents in hospitals across the country. 
Dr. Wipf also led the effort to establish VA 
Puget Sound’s Center of Excellence in Pri-
mary Care with the University of Washington 
School of Medicine and School of Nursing. 
The Center of Excellence takes an inter-
disciplinary approach to improving health care 
services for Veterans by creating a collabo-
rative program that includes a range of fields 
and experience from internal medicine to so-
cial work and interns to fellows. 
Veterans who receive their medical care 
from the VA Puget Sound Health Care System 
are very lucky to have someone who has 
dedicated their career to improving health care 
services for our nation’s veterans, while simul-
taneously preparing the next generation of 
health professionals. It is truly remarkable that 
Dr. Wipf has combined her passion for teach-
ing and medicine so effectively. 
Madam Speaker, I congratulate Dr. Joyce 
Wipf on receiving the 2020 Worthen Career 
Achievement Award and thank her for improv-
ing health care for all Veterans.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E940 
October 9, 2020 
recent decades, the number of women pur-
suing breast reconstruction has continued to 
increase. In 2019 alone, 107,238 breast re-
constructive procedures were performed in the 
United States—a 36 percent increase since 
2000 when 78,832 procedures were per-
formed. Post-mastectomy breast reconstruc-
tion is now universally recognized as a gold 
standard component of comprehensive breast 
cancer treatment. Breast reconstruction has 
been proven to significantly improve a wom-
an’s psychological and physical well-being, 
providing self-assurance, and affording women 
a new beginning. 
The final stage of breast reconstruction sur-
gery is to the nipple-areolar complex. This re-
sults in fully restoring the breast to a natural, 
symmetric appearance. This is achieved by a 
combination of tattooing with or without the 
addition of a surgical procedure to create a 
nipple. At times, tattooing is the only option for 
nipple-areolar reconstruction in patients that 
may have damaged tissue due to radiation 
therapy or simply want to avoid an additional 
surgical procedure. Most commonly, nipple- 
areolar tattooing is performed in a surgeon’s 
office if a woman selects to have tattooing 
performed, which is not always the case. How-
ever, plastic and reconstructive surgeons are 
increasingly recognizing that professional tat-
too artists can achieve superior results, includ-
ing an impressively realistic 3-D nipple-areola 
complex tattoo. The price of tattooing can start 
at approximately $400 for a single breast and 
reach as high as $1,000 for both breasts. 
Greater standardization of insurance cov-
erage for nipple-areolar reconstruction across 
insurance carriers is needed. In order to 
achieve this consistency, we need to amend 
the Women’s Health and Cancer Rights Act of 
1998 (WHCRA), within the Employee Retire-
ment Income Security Act of 1974. Further, we 
need to enhance the requirements for Medi-
care and Medicaid through the Social Security 
Act to protect a woman’s right to comprehen-
sive breast reconstruction, including nipple- 
areola complex tattooing. 
My bill will: 
Amend the Women’s Health and Cancer 
Rights Act of 1998 (WHCRA) to state that nip-
ple-areola complex tattooing is medical nec-
essary and is a part of breast reconstruction; 
Amend the Social Security Act to require 
Medicare to follow the Women’s Health and 
Cancer Rights Act of 1998; 
Amend the Social Security Act to add li-
censed tattoo artists to the list of Medicare 
providers; and 
Amend the Social Security Act to require 
Medicaid 
to 
add 
nipple-areola 
complex 
tattooing (as medically necessary) to the list of 
required services each State must offer relat-
ing to breast cancer reconstruction. 
Madam Speaker, as you know, breast can-
cer can affect not only a woman’s physical 
well-being, but also her psychological well- 
being. Considering the significant role psycho-
logical factors can play in patients’ overall 
well-being, it is essential that comprehensive 
breast reconstruction, including nipple-areola 
complex tattooing be required coverage by 
group health insurance companies, Medicare, 
and Medicaid. 
I urge my colleagues to assist women in 
their fight against breast cancer by supporting 
this important legislation.

Education, 
Health

seeing recent expansions of study and serv-
ices along with Endowed Chairwoman, Dr.

Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, I’m honored

the Knights of Columbus on June 30, 2020, 
and for his years of service to the U.S. Army, 
the Parish of St. Patrick in Carlisle, the Com-

RECOGNIZING FIREFIGHTERS TOM 
MARTIN AND TIM KENDEL 
HON. J. FRENCH HILL 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 9, 2020 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam Speaker, 
today I rise to recognize Tom Martin and Tim 
Kendel, who have tirelessly served the Higgin-
son Fire Department. Both will receive a spe-
cial ceremony to honor their contribution to the 
station and their community. 
Tom Martin has served as the department’s 
chaplain and has always been available to the 
crew during times of personal crisis and of-
fered his wisdom and spiritual guidance., He’s 
been just as available to the community itself 
through assistance with tornado and fire relief. 
His willingness and selflessness to the crew 
could never go unrecognized. 
Tim Kendel has been a pillar of the Higgin-
son Fire Department, as he has been a fire-
fighter since the founding of the department in 
1978. The department plans to celebrate Mr. 
Kendel soon with a parade to honor his serv-
ice to the town of Higginson. 
I thank Tom and Tim for their constant work 
to protect their community, and I wish them all 
the best in their future endeavors.

TRIBUTE TO MIKE BAKER 
HON. HAROLD ROGERS 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 9, 2020 
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to pay tribute to Mike Baker who 
recently retired as Clay County Clerk after 
nearly a decade of service to the people of 
Clay County who elected him to that role in 
2010. 
Mike’s heart for public service was inspired 
by his aunt, Florence Baker who also served 
as Clay County Clerk. In fact, his first job in 
public service was under her watch, when he 
started working as her Deputy Clerk at the 
young age of 19. It was a role he thrived in 
and maintained under the administration of 
three other county clerks, encompassing a 
total of 38 years of service in the Clay County 
Clerk’s office. 
Outside of the Clerk’s office, Mike and his 
wife, Linda have been faithful stewards to the 
community through various philanthropic ef-
forts. Together, they have collected thousands 
of Christmas Shoeboxes for Samaritan’s 
Purse, filled with gifts for less fortunate chil-
dren around the world. Mike has also 
partnered with the Manchester Baptist Church 
and Blanket America to collect and distribute 
more than 10,000 coats for the people of Ken-
tucky’s Appalachian region who are most in- 
need during winter months. 
As he begins a new chapter of life, I wish 
Mike many wonderful years of retirement with 
his family.

HONORING THE CAREER OF JANE 
GOFF 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORDO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 9, 2020 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the career of Jane Goff, a life-
long educator who will be retiring from the 
Colorado State Board of Education after 12 
years as the representative from the 7th Con-
gressional District. Jane’s dedication to edu-
cation for the State of Colorado made a sig-
nificant impact which will last for years to 
come. 
A native of Colorado, Jane graduated from 
Jefferson County Public Schools where she 
would later spend 34 years as a French and 
Spanish teacher. During this time, Jane co-
ordinated the district’s first Administrator and 
Teacher Performance Pay Pilots, served on 
the Jeffco PTA Board of Directors, and helped 
design the Links for Learning program, a 
teacher-employer partnership between the 
Jeffco Schools and the West Chamber of 
Commerce. She also served as the Coordi-
nator of World Languages and International 
Student Exchange, as President of the Jeffer-
son County Education Association (JCEA) and 
as Vice-President of the Colorado Education 
Association (CEA), and four years as Vice 
President for Education on the Jefferson Sym-
phony Board of Directors. Jane’s hard work 
and dedication serving the Jefferson County 
School District leaves a lasting legacy. 
After the Columbine High School tragedy, 
Jane was frequently consulted on school safe-
ty and crisis response providing a teacher’s 
perspective to a variety of local, state, and na-
tional audiences. 
After her retirement from Jefferson County 
Public Schools in 2006, Jane worked as a leg-
islative aide for the Colorado House of Rep-
resentatives. Jane was first elected to the Col-
orado State Board of Education in 2008 rep-
resenting the 7th Congressional District and 
was re-elected in 2014. From 20I0–2016, Jane 
was a member of the original Governors’ P– 
20 and Education Leadership Councils. She 
served as a member of the National Associa-
tion of State Boards of Education’s (NASBE) 
Board of Directors for three years before being 
elected President of that association in 2014. 
In 2018, she received NASBE’s Distinguished 
Service Award which honors current and 
former state board members who have made 
exceptional contributions to education. 
Currently, Jane is the Colorado Board of 
Education’s liaison to the Gifted Education 
State Advisory Committee, and liaison to Colo-
rado’s Teacher of the Year and Milken Family 
Teaching Award selection committees. She is 
also the Board’s appointed Democratic contact 
to the state legislature, and Colorado’s rep-
resentative to NASBE’s Government Affairs 
Committee. 
Jane has worked side by side with students, 
educators, and me to help improve outcomes 
for students and our entire community. She 
leaves a lasting legacy for Colorado’s students 
and she will be dearly missed on the State of 
Board of Education. Jane, thank you for your 
friendship, your partnership, and your service 
to public education and to the State of Colo-
rado. I wish you the best in your retirement.

IN MEMORY OF GREGG WILLIAM 
WINTERS 
HON. GREG PENCE 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 9, 2020 
Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
memory of fallen Muncie Police Officer Gregg 
William Winters. Officer Winters was tragically 
killed in the line of duty on January 8, 1991 at 
the young age of 32. 
Gregg Winters was born on February 25, 
1958 to parents Ezra ‘‘Zeke’’ and Beverly Sny-
der Winters. A lifelong resident of Muncie, he 
attended Muncie schools, graduating from 
Southside High School in 1976. He had 
worked for Wise’s Food Market and Motion In-
dustries before joining the Muncie Police De-
partment in 1986. He graduated from the Indi-
ana Law Enforcement Academy in 1987. He 
attended Shawnee Heights Baptist Church 
and was a member of the Fraternal Order of 
Police. 
On December 28, 1990, Officer Winters was 
responding to the scene of an alleged public 
intoxication. Officer Winters was transporting 
the subject to the Delaware County Jail when 
the man pulled out a concealed weapon and 
executed Officer Winters in cold blood. Officer 
Winters was struck five times. He bravely bat-
tled his injuries for eleven days before suc-
cumbing to his wounds. 
Officer Winters served courageously for four 
years on the Muncie Police Department. 
Those that served with him describe a won-
derful and brave man who always put his 
community first. 
As the thirty-year anniversary of Officer Win-
ters’ death approaches, I want to let his widow 
Molly and two sons Kyle and Brock know that 
we are forever grateful for Officer Winters’ 
service and his memory will always live on. 
God bless.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF 
THOMAS R. COOPER 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 9, 2020 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life of Thomas 
Regan Cooper, who passed away peacefully 
on September 22, 2020. 
Thomas’s life began on March 13, 1943 in 
Vicksburg, Mississippi. He was raised in An-
guilla, MS, where he graduated from high 
school before attending Mississippi State Uni-
versity. 
Shortly after his graduation from college, 
Thomas moved north to New Albany to start 
a career in management for Futorian Manufac-
turing Company. His devotion to his commu-
nity and commitment to public service began 
soon thereafter, as he was elected Alderman 
of Ward One in 1981, a role he served three 
terms. After his tenure as an Alderman, he 
was then Mayor and Chancery Clerk of New 
Albany until his retirement in 2008. 
Thomas’s dedication to service and love for 
his town went far beyond the parameters of 
his official roles. He was a volunteer fireman 
for more than 30 years and a member of 
countless clubs, societies, charitable organiza-
tions, and boards. He balanced these many 
responsibilities all while being a private busi-
ness co-owner of Custom Alloys Corporation 
and devout member of First United Methodist 
Church. 
No less important than his community im-
pact was his remarkable character. Thomas 
was a loving father, husband, grandfather, and 
friend, known for his unmatched integrity, 
friendliness, and unwavering desire to serve. 
Left to cherish his memory is his wife, Gloria 
of 54 years; his son, William Thomas Cooper; 
his daughter, Mary Katherine Cooper; his two 
brothers, Herman and Bill Cooper, and many 
other family members. 
Thomas R. Cooper’s life was one of service, 
grace, and love for his family and community. 
He will be greatly missed by all whom he en-
countered.

HONORING BILL CARPENTIER ON 
50 
YEARS 
OF 
DISTINGUISHED 
SERVICE 
HON. ADAM SMITH 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 9, 2020 
Mr. SMITH of Washington, Madam Speaker, 
it is my privilege to rise to recognize William 
‘‘Bill’’ Carpentier on 50 years of combined 
service to his country, both as an active duty 
military member and a civil servant as a Vet-
erans Affairs (VA) employee; He has reached 
a truly remarkable milestone. 
Bill was originally drafted into the military in 
1969 at 19 years old, and when his country 
called on him to serve, he didn’t shy away 
from the opportunity. He chose the Air Force 
and left for Naval Utility School in 1970 where 
he graduated with top honors. Bill went on to 
serve for eight years working in missile facility 
sites around the world. 
After his time in the military, Bill began a ca-
reer of civil service accepting a job working on 
the flight line at Tinker Air Force Base in Okla-
homa. In 1980, he started his first job at the 
VA and eventually landed a position back in 
his home state of Washington. He currently is 
a plumber on the Facilities Management Serv-
ices team where his work is essential in keep-
ing the building operating properly for the vet-
erans and staff. 
During his time with the VA, Bill has had the 
chance to work on projects, with the Wall of 
Heroes being one of which he is most proud 
of. The Wall of Heroes reminds patients, visi-
tors, staff and volunteers of the sacrifice, 
valor, bravery and heroism all Puget Sound 
veterans have. 
Madam Speaker, I sincerely thank Bill 
Carpentier for dedicating the last 50 years 
serving our country and its veterans. This is 
an incredible achievement that few have 
achieved.

IN MEMORY OF ROSANA CHANOU 
HON. ALAN S. LOWENTHAL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 9, 2020 
Mr. LOWENTHAL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in memory of Mrs. Rosana Chanou, a 
Cambodian American community leader and 
constituent in my 47th Congressional District, 
who passed away on September 22, 2020 in 
Long Beach, California. 
Born in 1951 in the Kampong Cham Prov-
ince of Cambodia, Mrs. Rosana Chanou spent 
her childhood in the capital, Phnom Penh. In 
1972, she passed the Cambodian National 
Baccalaureate II Exam. Rosana dreamed 
about studying abroad in the United States 
with its world class education. Within a year, 
she successfully acquired a student visa, bid 
farewell to family and friends, and began a 
journey to pursue her ambition. 
Rosana arrived in the United States with 
just $200 in her pocket. She worked several 
minimum wage jobs to support herself while 
attending school and tirelessly practicing her 
English. In 1975, when the Khmer Rouge 
overtook Cambodia, she was granted asylum 
status to remain in America. Rosana attended 
Montgomery College in Rockville, Maryland, 
and then obtained a scholarship to study at 
the American University in Washington D.C. In 
1979, she received her BS in Computer 
Science, married her college sweetheart 
Pasin, and moved to California to join her fam-
ily who were able to escape the Khmer 
Rouge. 
Rosana became a U.S. citizen in 1984. She 
went on to achieve a long and illustrious ca-
reer as a software engineer. As an Asian- 
American woman in the early years of the 
computer industry, she overcame barriers 
such as racial and sexual discrimination with 
her programming talents and tenacious per-
sonality. Rosana began working for the Boeing 
Company in Long Beach in 1986 and retired 
in 2015 after three decades with the company. 
Rosana and Pasin Chanou are proud par-
ents to three children: Diana, Ryan, and Ron-
ald. They instilled in their children the values 
of hard work, education, and family. They en-
couraged their children to be progressive and 
forward-thinking while also remembering the 
wise lessons of tradition. All three of their chil-
dren completed their college education at the 
University of California, began their successful 
careers, and started families of their own. 
Rosana loved playing with her grandchildren, 
showing them how to make 3D origami, blow-
ing bubbles, and picking exotic fruits and flow-
ers together around the vast garden that she 
maintained. She also loved to travel to places 
all around the world such as Australia, France, 
Canada, the Bahamas, Alaska, Hawaii, and 
numerous countries throughout Asia. She has 
traveled back to Cambodia several times to 
visit friends and family, showed her children 
where she grew up, gave back to her home 
country, and witnessed the amazing develop-
ment it has gone through despite its tragic his-
tory. 
In addition to her personal success and 
achievements, Rosana Chanou was a commu-
nity activist and leader. She volunteered for 
events such as the Special Summer Olympics, 
Long Beach Marathon, NCCJ Peace Walk, 
and LA Heart-Walk. She ardently championed 
Cambodian arts and culture by inviting Cam-
bodian artists to perform at the Asian Pacific 
Heritage Month celebration. She generously 
donated to various Cambodian community or-
ganizations such as Cambodia Town, Inc., 
Cam-CC, and Khmer Arts Academy. In 2001, 
she co-founded the Cambodia Town Initiative 
Task Force (CTITF), whose mission was to of-
ficially designate a section of the Anaheim 
street corridor in Lon Beach as Cambodia 
Town, in honor of Cambodian Americans who 
transformed the neighborhood into a vibrant 
community. In 2005, CTITF was restructured 
as a nonprofit known as Cambodia Town, Inc. 
Rosana served as the First Vice-Chair of the 
organization. Both Rosana and Pasin were 
major donors to the Long Beach Mark Twain 
Neighborhood Library’s ‘‘Cambodia Town’’ 
Community Room, and proud sponsors sofa

RECOGNIZING THE KANAGAWA 
CITRUS COMPANY 
HON. TJ COX 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 9, 2020 
Mr. COX of California. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the Kanagawa family 
of Sanger, California, who for three genera-
tions have operated the Kanagawa Citrus 
Company. The Kanagawa Citrus Company, 
commonly known as the Sanger Nursery, has 
been an institution in their community for over 
one hundred years. 
T.Y. Kanagawa immigrated from Japan to 
California in the early 1900s in pursuit of the 
American 
Dream. 
He 
incorporated 
the 
Kanagawa Citrus Company with the State of 
California in 1907. 
The Kanagawa family’s small business has 
thrived over the years despite many chal-
lenges including the internment of T.Y. 
Kanagawa, his spouse Jitsuyo, and their son 
Robert Kanagawa during World War II. It was 
in the camp that Robert met his spouse, Yuki, 
who also joined the family business. 
During the family’s internment, their neigh-
bors—the William Boes family—watched over 
and protected their property. Upon the family’s 
release from the camp, the Kanagawas contin-
ued their work to serve their community and 
grow the company. T.Y. and his two sons, 
Robert and Jerry, focused their efforts towards 
meeting the needs of California’s growing agri-
cultural industry and the company grew stead-
ily, with Jerry managing the day-to-day oper-
ations and Robert maintaining the books and 
finances. 
Robert’s son, Dallas, was the third genera-
tion of the Kanagawa family to manage the 
company, took over in the 1980s. Known for 
friendly, 
personalized 
service, 
Dallas 
Kanagawa and his staff continued providing 
fruit trees, hardware, and much needed agri-
culture supplies to farmers in Fresno County 
and throughout the Central Valley. 
Today, the Kanagawa Citrus Company 
serves as many as 350 farmers, many of 
which have relied on the Kanagawa Citrus 
Company over all three generations. Now, 
after proudly serving Valley farmers for over 
30 years, Dallas Kanagawa looks forward to a 
happy retirement with his lovely wife, Paula. 
The Central Valley will remember the 
Kanagawa family and their service to the 21st 
Congressional District with pride.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF 
JUDGE DOUGLAS FAHL 
HON. JIM BANKS 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 9, 2020 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the service of Whitley Superior Judge 
Douglas Fahl. 
As a practicing attorney of nearly 25 years, 
Judge Fahl’s record of public service is noth-
ing short of exceptional. 
Having practiced law in the United States 
for over 20 years, Judge Fahl has also been 
called upon to represent military law across 
the world, including Guantanamo Bay and 
Iraq. 
In Whitley County, Judge Fahl spearheaded 
a new veterans treatment court program. 
Through the program, jurisdictions serve a 
large segment of the veteran population in-
volved in the criminal justice system. The pro-
gram has long fostered a better understanding 
between judges and the issues with which vet-
erans, often casualties of war, struggle. So 
successful in Whitley County was this program 
that two neighboring county’s court systems 
now direct qualifying veterans to Judge Fahl. 
In September 2020, Judge Fahl was ap-
pointed the Indiana National Guard’s very first 
certified military judge. Few men were more 
qualified for such an appointment. Brig. Gen. 
Bobby L. Christine, National Guard adviser to 
the Judge Advocate General’s Corps spoke in 
support of Judge Fahl’s credentials and stat-
ed, ‘‘Lt. Col. Doug Fahl’s selection to serve as 
military judge for the state of Indiana is proof 
positive that the rights of those who defend 
America will be safeguarded. No finer selec-
tion for judge could be made.’’ 
Judge Fahl has served northeast Indiana, 
and our Nation, with the highest honor and 
distinction. This record is a testament to his 
tireless commitment to the people which make 
our country great and ideals to which our Na-
tion strive.

IN MEMORY OF THE HONORABLE 
ROBERT 
STEPHEN 
‘‘BOB’’ 
POYDASHEFF, SR. 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 9, 2020 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, it 
is with a heavy heart and solemn remem-
brance that I rise today to pay tribute to an ex-
traordinary husband, father, grandfather, sol-
dier, veteran, attorney, public servant, and 
dear friend of longstanding—Former Mayor of 
Columbus, Georgia, Colonel Robert Stephen 
‘‘Bob’’ Poydasheff, Sr., USA, Ret. Sadly, Bob 
passed away on Thursday, September 24, 
2020. A private family graveside service was 
held on Saturday, September 26, 2020, at 
Parkhill Cemetery in Columbus, Georgia, and 
a memorial service will be held at the National 
Infantry Museum and Soldier Center in Colum-
bus, Georgia on Friday, October 30, 2020 at 
3 p.m. 
A native of Bronx, New York, Bob was born 
with an innate determination to excel, which 
was apparent in virtually every aspect of his 
life—and especially in his pursuit of education. 
After completing his primary and secondary 
education in New York, he earned a B.A. in 
Political Science from The Citadel, The Military 
College of South Carolina, in 1954, along with 
his commission as a Second Lieutenant; 
earned his Juris Doctorate from Tulane Uni-
versity in Louisiana in 1957; and in 1967, he 
received an M.A. in International Relations 
from Boston College. In addition, he attended 
The Hague Academy of International Law in 
the Netherlands as well as The Army War Col-
lege. 
He served in the U.S. Army for twenty-four 
years and retired at the rank of Colonel. He 
began his distinguished military career as an 
Infantry Officer and he was a parachutist, 
serving one combat tour in Vietnam. He then 
transferred to the Judge Advocate General 
Corps, where he was prominent in the trials of 
high-ranking officers involved in the My Lai in-
cident. Bob also served as Legislative Counsel 
to Secretary of the Army, Howard (Bo) 
Calloway; Staff Judge Advocate at Ft. Belvoir, 
VA; and Legal Counsel to the Secretary of the 
Army and Secretary of Defense on Labor Re-
lations (1955 to 1979). In recognition of his ex-
emplary service to our country, he received 
the Vietnam Ribbon, Legion of Merit, Com-
mendation Medal, 2 Oak Leaf Clusters, and 
he was elected to the Ranger Hall of Fame. In 
addition to these prominent awards, he later 
received the Clara Barton Award, the highest 
honor bestowed by the Red Cross. 
Following 
his 
military 
service, 
Colonel 
Poydasheff made Columbus, Georgia his per-
manent home and entered the private practice 
of law. Bob loved Columbus, Georgia, and 
through his leadership, the City of Columbus 
experienced extraordinary growth and pros-
perity which stemmed from his terms as a City 
Counselor from 1994 to 2002 and as Mayor 
from 2003 to 2007. During his tenure as 
Mayor, the area gained more than seven thou-
sand new jobs and under his leadership the 
Columbus Consolidated Government exer-
cised fiscal responsibility resulting in balanced 
budgets and a surplus. A staunch advocate for 
equal opportunity and diversity, he made his-
tory on February 1, 2005 by appointing the 
first African American City Manager, The Hon-
orable Isaiah Hugley, who continues to serve 
the city. That was on top of his membership 
in a multitude of civic organizations that did 
positive work, which included: Chattahoochee 
Valley Citadel Club (President); Chattahoo-
chee Boy Scout Council (Past President); As-
sociation of U.S. Army (Past President); Anne 
Elizabeth Shepherd Home (Past President); 
Fort Benning Sojourners (Past President); 
Board of Directors American Red Cross (Past 
Chairman); Military Affairs Committee, Colum-
bus Chamber of Commerce (Past Chairman); 
Civilian-Military Council (Past Chairman); Mili-
tary Order of World Wars (Past Commander); 
Minority Business Development Council; Black 
History Month Steering Committee; Urban 
League (Director); Columbus Lawyer’s Club;

Club of Columbus; Leadership Columbus 
Alumni; Shriner; Scottish Rite; and Masons.

and loyal support of, Infantry, and dem-
onstrating gallant devotion to the principle of 
selfless service embodied by the American In-
fantryman. Unfortunately, he passed before he 
could receive the award, but it will be be-
stowed posthumously by the National Infantry 
Association. 
During his life, he played many roles, and in 
each role, he gave it his all. In addition to 
being a successful attorney, dedicated soldier, 
and public servant, he was also a published 
author. His first published work, entitled ‘‘A 
Banana in the Sun’’, was published in Harp-
er’s Magazine in 2006. Yet, in all his roles, he 
embodied the Army values of loyalty, duty, re-
spect, selfless service, honor, integrity, and 
personal courage. He never stopped serving 
and advocating for what was right even in the 
face of criticism. He was a longtime member 
of the Black History Observance Breakfast 
Committee in Columbus, and his most recent 
form of advocacy was on behalf of disadvan-
taged Veterans with regards to the location of 
the new VA Clinic in Columbus. 
On a personal note, Bob was my friend. He 
always gave me wise advice and sage coun-
sel. He never told me what I wanted to hear, 
but he always told me what he felt I needed 
to hear and always ended with ‘‘I love you.’’ 
Audrey Hepburn once said, ‘‘You have two 
hands. One to help yourself, the other to help 
others.’’ Mayor Robert S. ‘‘Bob’’ Poydasheff, 
Sr. used his hand to help others with an abid-
ing sense of friendship and brotherhood. He 
will be missed but his legacy will live on 
through all of those whose lives he touched. 
Bob accomplished much in his life, but none 
of this would have been possible without the 
Grace of God; the love and support of his wife 
of more than 60 years, Anastasia ‘‘Stacey’’; 
his children, Catherine (deceased) and Robert, 
Jr.; and a host of family, friends, and loved 
ones who will miss him deeply. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
my wife, Vivian, and me, along with the more 
than 730,000 residents of Georgia’s Second 
Congressional District, in paying tribute to The 
Honorable Robert Stephen ‘‘Bob’’ Poydasheff, 
Sr., and in extending our deepest condolences 
to all who mourn his loss during this difficult 
time of bereavement. Moreover, we pray that 
we will all be consoled and comforted by an 
abiding faith and the Holy Spirit in the days, 
weeks, and months ahead.

COMMEMORATING THE 50TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE CHILDREN’S 
ATTENTION HOME 
HON. RALPH NORMAN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 9, 2020 
Mr. NORMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the 
Children’s Attention Home in Rock Hill, South 
Carolina. 
The Children’s Attention Home provides nur-
turing care and life changing services for 
youth in need. The Home’s noble objective is 
to provide a temporary care shelter where a 
child can experience a loving, secure family 
life until their own home conditions improve or 
a permanent home can be found. 
The need for a children’s home in Rock Hill 
became evident 50 years ago when children 
were being placed in jail due to the lack of 
emergency shelters and foster homes. To 
meet this need, individuals, churches, and 
businesses throughout the community donated 
their time, energy, and money to rent and ren-
ovate a house near Winthrop University. In the 
fall of 1970, the Children’s Attention Home 
opened its doors to provide shelter for children 
who had been victims of child abuse. 
Throughout the last 50 years, the Home has 
provided the love and care over 8,000 children 
desperately craved. 8,000 young lives have 
been improved through initiatives like the Pal-
metto School, which provides individualized 
educational opportunities for children, and the 
Crossroads program, which helps older youth 
pursue a path to successful independence. 
The lifechanging work of the Children’s At-
tention Home is a shining example of the 
sense of community felt across Rock Hill. It is 
for that reason I congratulate them on a suc-
cessful 50 years of helping the most vulner-
able members of our community, and I look 
forward to hearing how they continue to serve 
over the next 50 years.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF THE 
HONORABLE JON D. SHELTON 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 9, 2020 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life of Jonathan 
Douglas Shelton, who passed away on Sun-
day, August 30, in Tupelo, Mississippi, at age 
46. 
Jon Shelton was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, 
on May 21, 1974. He was raised in Tupelo, 
graduating from Tupelo High School after 
standout careers in high school football and 
powerlifting. Jon then attended the University 
of Mississippi, where he continued his studies 
for his Juris Doctorate. During his youth, Jon 
also served as the executive coordinator of 
Mississippi Young Democrats. 
Following school, Jon moved back to his 
hometown of Tupelo, where he owned and op-
erated a successful law firm for many years. 
In 2004, the Lee County Courier chose Jon as 
Lee County’s ‘‘Best Man.’’ and Lee County’s 
‘‘Best Attorney’’ four times in 2012, 2013, 
2014, and 2016. Outside of his successful ca-
reer, Jon was an avid BMX bicycle racer, win-
ning the Mississippi State Championship and 
achieving a national ranking for many years. 
Through his law firm and his service to his 
church, East Heights Baptist Church, Jon was 
a caring soul whose proudest moments were 
helping those around him. 
Left to cherish Jon’s memory is his mother, 
Dr. Judy Woods; his stepfather, Buck Woods; 
his brother, Mayor Jason L. Shelton; his neph-
ew; and a host of cousins, family, and friends.

Friday, October 9, 2020 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize Officer Joshua Kear as 
the recipient of the 2020 Teen Court Faye 
Shepherd Award for Juvenile Justice. 
The award recognizes a member of the 
community who has dedicated themselves to 
serving at-risk youths. 
Before becoming a law enforcement officer 
in Conway, Mr. Kear battled alcohol addiction. 
Through a faith-based rehabilitation center, he 
was able to overcome his struggle. 
Officer Kear, does not hide from his pre-
vious struggles, instead he uses them to as-
sist and encourage others facing similar chal-
lenges. 
Serving as a mentor for many in the juvenile 
detention system, he reassures them that 
things will get better and that he will not give 
up on them. His love and commitment to 
those in the community serve as an inspiration 
for all. 
Thank you to Officer Kear, the Conway Po-
lice Department, and our law enforcement offi-
cers around the country, whose positive im-
pacts on our communities often get over-
looked. Congratulations to Officer Kear for 
winning the 2020 Teen Court Faye Shepherd 
Award for Juvenile Justice.

Friday, October 9, 2020 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Antoinette M. Rich Pennel, 
formerly of Campbell and Warren, Ohio, who 
passed away on Monday, September 14, 2020 
at the age of 98. 
A 1938 graduate of Campbell Memorial 
High School, she also graduated from the 
Youngstown College of Business. 
Her first husband, Michael J. Rich, whom 
she married September 25, 1943, passed 
away February 20, 1964. Together, they 
owned and operated Masi Furniture Store in 
Campbell where she served as the company’s 
Vice President and bookkeeper. Previously, 
Antoinette worked as a bookkeeper for the 
Strouss-Hirshberg Company, Youngstown. 
Antoinette then married Frank Pennel on 
June 22, 1968. He preceded her in death on 
January 5, 2007, following 39 years of mar-
riage. 
Antoinette and her first husband, Michael, 
were founding members of St. Lucy Church, 
Campbell. Throughout the years, she re-
mained an active member of the church and 
participated in the Infant of Jesus Guild. Antoi-
nette and her mother, Nellie, always looked 
forward to the annual Assumption Festival 
held at the church, as well as decorating the 
festival float. 
She enjoyed cooking, baking, taking trips to 
the casino and spending time with her family, 
especially her grandchildren and great-grand-

INTRODUCTION 
OF 
THE 
INTER-
STATE TEACHING MOBILITY ACT 
HON. ANDRE´ CARSON 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 9, 2020 
Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to reintroduce the Interstate 
Teaching Mobility Act. This broadly supported 
legislation will create a new voluntary program 
at the Department of Education (DOE) to allow 
licensed teachers to use their licenses across 
state lines. I am pleased that this legislation 
has been endorsed by both National Edu-
cation Association (NEA) and Third Way. 
In 2018, the United States experienced a 
shortage of 112,00 teachers in our classrooms 
across the country. This shortage deprives our 
students of high-quality learning and nega-
tively affects student outcomes. Alarmingly, 
our country’s projected annual shortage of 
teachers is expected to almost triple—to 
316,000—by 2025. Teacher shortages dis-
proportionately disadvantage students in un-
derserved communities by widening student- 
to-teacher ratio which then negatively affects 
student achievement. Having low student-to- 
teacher ratios ensures that every student gets 
the attention they need, and struggling stu-
dents are not left behind. In Indiana, this prob-
lem has gotten worse: between 2016 and 
2020, the student-to-teacher ratio in my state 
grew from 16:1 to 17:1, bringing our state’s 
student-to-teacher ratio well above the na-
tional average. In fact, Indiana remains the 
42nd worst state in the nation for student-to- 
teacher ratios. And this teacher disparity does 
not affect all students equally: student-teacher 
ratios are highest in minority schools and 
schools with the most low-income schools. 
Teacher shortages not only affect student- 
teacher ratios, they also limit the number of 
subjectmatter teachers available for students. 
In Indiana, we have consistently faced major 
teacher shortages as defined by the Depart-
ment of Education (DOE). In the most recent 
data available, Indiana continues to face a 
shortage of teachers in the subjects of mathe-
matics, science, early childhood, and tech-
nology. Study after study has shown that 
teacher shortages which results in poor stu-
dent-to-teacher ratios, insufficient subject-mat-
ter teachers, and the corresponding decline in 
education quality disproportionally disadvan-
tages Black and Brown students. 
One of the main reasons that many schools 
can’t fill teacher shortages is because of the 
inconsistent 
state-by-state 
differences 
in 
teaching licensing requirements. This prevents 
licensed teachers from taking their skills and 
credentials to teach in other states without sig-
nificant obstacles. These obstacles can in-
clude 
completing 
additional 
requirements, 
such as exams or coursework, or paying addi-
tional fees, even if the teacher has already 
completed an approved credentialing program 
or has a strong teaching record. Alarmingly, a 
majority of states do not accept out-of-state 
teaching credentials, further compounding 
shortages in disadvantaged areas. 
As our nation’s workforce becomes increas-
ingly mobile, these requirements also dramati-
cally decrease the flexibility of our nation’s 
teaching workforce. For military spouses—who 
frequently relocate and among whom teaching 
is the second most common profession—or 
out-of-state college graduates who want to 
teach in their home state, this problem is es-
pecially pronounced. Long term, these road-
blocks likely deter many prospective teachers 
from entering this vital profession. The bottom 
line is this: differing licensing requirements 
and lack of licensing reciprocity prevents too 
many teachers from serving in understaffed 
and underserved communities across state 
lines. And as we have seen in states like Indi-
ana, our communities desperately need more 
high-quality teachers to lower student-teacher 
ratios and improve outcomes. 
These obstacles have real and negative im-
pacts on our students. Teacher shortages dis-
proportionately harm students in underserved 
communities by denying them adequate teach-
er-student ratios that research shows help to 
enable student success. School administrators 
in underserved communities face difficulties in 
attracting out-of-state, high-quality teachers to 
fill their open teaching positions due to licens-
ing inconsistencies. 
That’s why I am reintroducing the Interstate 
Teaching Mobility Act today. This legislation 
will create a voluntary interstate application 
program at the Department of Education 
(DOE) to allow licensed teachers to use their 
licenses across participating state lines. 
This legislation will empower teachers to 
apply for open teaching positions in partici-
pating states without being subject to addi-
tional certifications or assessments. As a re-
sult, it will be easier for teachers to transfer 
their skills across participating state lines and 
provide more students with access to high- 
quality teachers. Importantly, this new flexi-
bility will help alleviate teacher shortages—es-
pecially in disadvantaged communities and 
school districts—by allowing school adminis-
trators greater ability to hire more high-quality 
teachers. 
Under this legislation, increased flexibility 
will not come at the cost of teacher quality. A 
participating state will be required to adhere to 
standards of content knowledge, pedagogical 
assessment, and performance assessments. 
This would ensure high standards for our 
teachers, while maintaining the essential role 
of the states in setting specific requirements 
for teaching in the state or obtaining licenses 
in the state. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has taught us the 
importance of flexibility and teacher quality in 
ensuring that our students receive the best 
education. However, the current state-by-state 
inconsistences regarding teacher licenses pre-
vent many high-quality teachers from transfer-
ring their skills across state lines to serve in 
communities facing teacher shortages. 
The Interstate Teaching Mobility Act will 
help address these issues by empowering 
teachers to transfer their skills across state 
lines and enabling school administrators to 
hire more high-quality teachers to fill teacher 
shortages, especially in disadvantaged com-
munities, and lead to better student outcomes. 
I urge the House to support this bill.

RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF 
ROBERT WILSON 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 9, 2020 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the U.S. Military service 
of Robert Wilson who is a recipient of the Pur-
ple Heart Medal. Robert ‘‘Bobby’’ Wilson, a 
native of Tupelo, Mississippi, volunteered for 
the U.S. Army in December 1951. Once he 
completed Basic Training in Hawaii, he en-
tered the Korean War. 
On February 6, 1953, Mr. Wilson was on 
patrol with other members of his company 11⁄2 
miles in Chinese territory called the Coonwah 
Valley. On that frigid night with the tempera-
ture below zero, he and his fellow men were 
attacked by the enemy who were firing mortar 
rounds. Mr. Wilson was seriously injured and 
needed to be transported to receive medical 
treatment. He was picked up by a medic and 
placed on a stretcher. Another firefight ensued 
before he could be taken to a Mobile Army 
Surgical Hospital where he would be treated 
for 18 shrapnel wounds over the course of 39 
days. His courage and bravery under fire 
earned him the Purple Heart Medal. It is my 
honor to recognize Mr. Wilson for his service 
to America and his pledge to protect our free-
doms. 
In December 1953, Mr. Wilson completed 
his military service and returned home to his 
wife, Tomicene. The high school sweethearts 
remained in Tupelo where they raised two 
boys, David and Robert. The Wilsons were 
married 64 years before Tomicene passed 
away. In the years since her death, Mr. Wilson 
has often reflected on his days of service. ‘‘I’d 
do it again,’’ Mr. Wilson said. ‘‘I still have 
shrapnel in my leg and pain, but I will always 
be proud that I served my country.’’ 
Mr. Wilson’s service and sacrifices made to 
defend our nation will always be remembered. 
I am honored to call this Mississippi patriot a 
friend.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 9, 2020 
Mr. LOWENTHAL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to express my deep sadness on the 
passing of my dear friend Sharon Cotrell. A 
voice of the progressive community in Long 
Beach for over 40 years, Sharon was a con-
summate professional who cared deeply about 
our community and making the world a better 
place for us all. 
She was the first woman dock worker on 
the West Coast, starting with SeaLand in 1974 
at the Port of Long Beach, and eventually be-
coming the leader of Teamsters Local 692. 
Karen Harper, a longtime friend, told the 
Long Beach Press-Telegram that Sharon was 
‘‘. . . not welcomed by the men at first and

was harassed mercilessly. But she won them 
over with her intelligence, work ethic, physical 
strength, sense of justice and expertise at or-
ganizing.’’ 
Sharon was also a union organizer on the 
docks fighting for a greater voice for all port 
workers, cofounding the Long Beach chapter 
of the Teamsters for a Democratic Union. Be-
cause of her organizing against what she 
called the corruption of the Teamsters Union 
hierarchy, her life was threatened, and she 
was forced for a time to live in hiding. 
Despite such temporary roadblocks, Sharon 
remained a tenacious activist fighting for 
equality and justice, as well as an ardent com-
munity watchdog, for more than four decades. 
She served for many years as a member of 
Long Beach Area Citizens Involved (LBACI) 
and worked for the establishment of the Long 
Beach Citizen Police Complaint Commission. 
She was an early member of both the Black 
Lives Matter and Occupy Long Beach organi-
zations. 
Karen Harper said Sharon saw the brutal 
treatment of African Americans on her family 
television ‘‘and sought solutions for racism 
from then on. She loved working with young 
people and mentoring them on effective grass-
roots organizing.’’ 
Sharon was also an outspoken advocate for 
LGBTQ rights and the homeless, which she 
fought for through her involvement with the 
Long Beach Area Peace Network, the Justice 
and Peace Committee for the South Coast 
Interfaith Council and Harbor Halfway House. 
According to the Press-Telegram, Sharon 
was born on Dec. 2, 1942, in San Francisco. 
But from 5 years old, she grew up on a dairy 
farm in the Lower Flathead Valley, near St. Ig-
natius, Montana, on the Salish-Kootenai Indian 
Reservation. 
Her family moved there after her father, 
Lewis Cotrell—a descendant of the Little Shell 
Chippewa Tribe and the Cherokee people—re-
turned from World War II service in the U.S. 
Navy. 
Sharon’s younger sister, Gretchen, said that 
from early childhood her sister was sensitive 
to the needs of others, reaching out to the left- 
out, excluded, and mistreated. 
‘‘These traits grew to a keen interest in the 
injustices of the world, the chief driving force 
throughout her life,’’ Gretchen told the Press- 
Telegram. ‘‘She possessed the courage of her 
convictions and lived them fiercely.’’ 
Sharon’s ancestry also led her to another 
area of activism—Native American and indige-
nous people rights. She was a tribal re-
searcher for the Gabrielino-Tongva Tribal 
Council and was involved with the Puvungna 
Coalition to save the tribe’s sacred land from 
development on the Cal State Long Beach 
campus. She also cofounded the People for 
Palestinian-Israeli Justice. 
Sharon attended Lewis & Clark College in 
Portland, Oregon, and the University of Mon-
tana, before moving to Long Beach in 1964. 
She went on to earn a bachelor’s degree in 
anthropology from Cal State Long Beach. 
Her friend Karen Harper recalled to the 
Press-Telegram that Sharon also had a great 
sense of humor—even when jokes were di-
rected at her. Karen remembered that she 
would often refer to Sharon as ‘‘the historical 
figure’’ because of her work on the docks. 
‘‘She would laugh,’’ Karen said. ‘‘She al-
ways got a kick out of that.’’ 
But, to me, Sharon was not just a dear 
friend and fellow progressive; she was my 
campaign manager when I first ran for LB City 
Council in 1992 (in addition to running pre-
vious campaigns for former Mayor Tom Clark 
and 
former 
City 
Councilmember 
Wally 
Edgerton). Through our years together she 
was both my mentor and formative political 
conscience who I relied upon for her incredible 
insight and wisdom. 
Sharon touched so many lives and her 
passing is a loss for all of us. She was a role 
model and inspiration for all who met her, and 
she will be sorely missed by everyone who 
fights for a more just society and a better 
world.

CONGRATULATING DR. BETH RIP-

ON 
RECEIVING 
THE 
2020 
SAMUEL J. HEYMAN SERVICE TO 
AMERICA 
MEDAL 
IN 
SCIENCE 
AND ENVIRONMENT 
HON. ADAM SMITH 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 9, 2020 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, 
it is my privilege to rise to congratulate Beth 
Ripley, M.D., Ph.D. on being the recipient of 
the 2020 Samuel J. Heyman Service to Amer-
ica Medal in the Science and Environment cat-
egory. 
Dr. Beth Ripley is an assistant professor of 
radiology at the University of Washington and 
the Director of the Veterans Health Adminis-
tration’s (VHA) 3D Printing Network in Puget 
Sound. She saw potential in this emerging 
technology back in 2017, and through her in-
novative techniques, she has revolutionized 
health care at the VHA. Dr. Ripley prints 3D 
models of parts of people’s bodies from kid-
neys to hip joints to hearts. 
These 3D models allow doctors to provide 
veterans with the best possible health care 
and have resulted in more efficient and effec-
tive surgeries by saving valuable time and 
minimizing the potential for mistakes. Doctors 
can also show models to their patients to give 
them a better understanding of the procedure 
they’re going to undergo. In some cases, 
these models have even shown surgery 
wouldn’t be the best course of action. 
At the start of the COVID–19 pandemic Dr. 
Ripley made the impossible possible and 
began printing personal protective equipment 
for staff and veterans. She has even started 
3D printing parts needed for life-saving ventila-
tors. Dr. Ripley truly embodies what it means 
to be a civil servant and the Puget Sound 
VHA is incredibly lucky to have somebody with 
the passion and innovation she does. 
Madam Speaker, it is an honor to congratu-
late Dr. Beth Ripley on receiving this well-de-
served award and I thank her for dedicating 
her career to improving health care for our 
veterans.

REINTRODUCTION 
OF 
THE 
STU-
DENTS 
HELPING 
YOUNG 
STU-
DENTS ACT 
HON. ANDRE´ CARSON 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 9, 2020 
Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to reintroduce the Students Help-
ing Young Students Act. This important legis-
lation will invest in college students who sup-
port and mentor K–12 students at after-school 
activities. l am pleased that this legislation has 
been endorsed by MENTOR: The National 
Mentoring Partnership and I am grateful for 
the feedback I received from my constituents 
on this proposal. This legislation will make a 
meaningful difference in the lives of all Hoo-
sier students, and young Americans across 
the country, by ensuring that college students 
can be compensated for the critical work of 
mentoring and supporting their younger coun-
terparts. 
It is an honor to represent students of all 
ages in Indiana’s Seventh District. I am contin-
ually impressed by the many college students 
in my district and across the country that, in 
addition to their studies, help mentor and sup-
port K–12 students in after-school programs. 
These college students, by serving as power-
ful examples and mentors, continue to inspire 
my colleagues and I about the importance of 
peer mentorship opportunities. This includes 
the crucial role of work study programs in 
helping students finance their postsecondary 
education. 
Several examples in Indiana underscore the 
importance of supporting mentorship pro-
grams, both to the mentee and the mentor. 
David, a biology major at Marian University in 
Indianapolis, 
also 
served 
as 
a 
mentor. 
Through David’s mentoring, his mentee has 
improved in school and built up self-con-
fidence; David, too, recognizes that he has 
learned from his mentee and is inspired to 
help additional younger students. 
Another student, Celia, at the University of 
Southern Indiana, mentored a young third 
grade student. Celia was mentored herself 
while also in the third grade; this experience 
helped her understand the importance of men-
toring younger students to help achieve their 
goals and learn from their older peers. Men-
toring younger students has helped Celia dis-
cover her passion for education and youth de-
velopment programs. Celia also shared her 
college experiences with her mentee, who has 
in turn become interested in attending college. 
The examples of David and Celia represent 
how the influence and investment from a men-
tor can improve younger student lives and out-
comes. Their stories are common: in fact, at- 
risk youth that have a mentor are 55 percent 
more likely to attend college. Moreover, at-risk 
youth that have a mentor are 52 percent less 
likely to skip a day of school and 46 percent 
less likely to use drugs. Mentoring also in-
creases community engagement, as at-risk 
students are 78 percent more likely to volun-
teer in their community engagement, as at-risk 
students are 78 percent more likely to volun-
teer in their community and are 130 percent 
more likely to hold a leadership role in clubs 
or teams with a mentor in their lives. Men-
toring not only helps students stay away from 
drugs and violence, but also live healthier lives 
and improve school performance. Mentees 
participating in mentorship programs have also 
performed higher on the Indiana Statewide 
Testing for Educational Progress (ISTEP) 
tests. 
Because of these unmistakable benefits, 
Congress must do more to support these 
after-school programs and their student men-
tors. Although after-school mentorship pro-
grams often intersect with students’ courses of 
study and benefit the community, after-school

activities are not currently considered a com-
munity service under the Federal Work-Study 
program. This means that college students 
cannot rely on compensation from Federal 
Work-Study for their participation in after- 
school activities. 
The 
Federal 
Work-Study 
program 
has 
helped support undergraduate and graduate 
students, who have exhibited financial need, 
find part-time jobs. In the 2017–2018 school 
year, the Federal Work-Study program em-
ployed about 600,000 undergraduate and 
graduate students. Across all higher edu-
cation, 7 in 10 college students work at least 
15 hours per week to help cover their tuition, 
and 1 in 4 work more than 35 hours a week. 
While mentorship’s benefits are clear, the ab-
sence of after-school activities from consider-
ation as work-study programs causes students 
with financial need to more often pursue other 
opportunities. This means that many students 
are unable to serve in mentorship roles, even 
if it aligns with their course of study, for finan-
cial reasons. This dynamic exacerbates the 
widening mentoring gap, which includes the 
over 9 million young people without a mentor 
outside their family to support their growth and 
education. 
As a result, more work needs to be done to 
help compensate students who choose to 
serve their communities by mentoring younger 
students. That is why the Students Helping 
Young Students Act is so important. This bill 
incorporates work at after-school programs 
into the Federal Work-Study Program under 
community service by making participation in 
these programs eligible for federal funds. In 
short, this bill allows college students to ac-
cess Federal Work-Study funds for their par-
ticipation in after-school activities. Moreover, 
this legislation requires eligible schools to allo-
cate federal funds to students who want to 
work with after-school programs. 
Through the Students Helping Young Stu-
dents Act, after-school mentoring programs, 
like those Celia and David participated in, will 
count as community service under the Federal 
Work-Study program. Students can be com-
pensated for their work, including time spent in 
training and travel, directly related to the pro-
gram. This will allow any student who wishes 
to serve in their community to participate in 
mentorship activities, regardless of their finan-
cial background. As a result, the Students 
Helping Young Students Act will also help 
close the mentoring gap and ensure that 
younger students, especially those from dis-
advantaged backgrounds, have the support 
they need to succeed and reach their goals. 
Madam Speaker, I hope my colleagues will 
join me in supporting this bill to ensure that 
Federal 
Work-Study 
students 
are 
com-
pensated for their mentorship efforts. The sto-
ries of Celia and David remind me of the un-
deniable power of young people to lift and in-
spire those around them. It is important that 
Congress supports these students in their pur-
suit to serve our communities. I urge the 
House to support this bill.

Friday, October 9, 2020 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and congratulate my friend Captain 
John A. Sweat, Jr. upon his induction into the 
North Carolina Military Veterans Hall of Fame. 
Over the years, CPT Sweat has answered 
historic calls to duty on behalf of our nation, 
state, and community. He began his extraor-
dinary career in 1986 with the U.S. Air Force 
and served honorably in both Operation 
Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm. 
CPT Sweat’s leadership extended far beyond 
the battlefield and he was named Active Duty 
Volunteer of the Year for his off-duty devotion 
to family services. CPT Sweat was selected 
as the Tactical Air Command First Term Air-
man of the Year and served in a special duty 
billet as an instructor at the Security Police 
Academy at Lackland Air Force Base. 
Following tours in Turkey, Florida, and 
Texas, CPT Sweat went on to join the North 
Carolina Air National Guard. Exemplary of his 
tireless leadership, he became the first officer 
to complete training with the U.S. Air Force 
Honor Guard. From his days at basic training 
to his 2011 retirement from the North Carolina 
Air National Guard, he only missed one day of 
service over his combined 24 years, 9 months, 
and 23 days of military service. 
He has led a career of distinction and is an 
effective, prolific leader. In addition to his mili-
tary service, CPT Sweat has served on the 
Concord City Council since 2009. A tireless 
public servant, he has also served on the Ra-
cial Diversity Committee, Historic Commission, 
and the Planning and Zoning Commission for 
the City of Concord and is a member of the 
Habitat for Humanity Executive Board and Lit-
eracy Council for Cabarrus County. 
This year’s class was selected by an inde-
pendent selection committee that includes 
North Carolina military veterans and civilians. 
In total, a group of eighteen was chosen to 
join the ranks of our state’s greatest heroes in 
the Hall of Fame. CPT Sweat is especially de-
serving of this honor and will now be en-
shrined forever for his remarkable contribu-
tions to our great nation and state. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in 
congratulating CPT Sweat on his induction 
into the North Carolina Military Veterans Hall 
of Fame.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF JAMES 
EDWARD ‘‘J.E.’’ HUDSON 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 9, 2020 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life of James Ed-
ward ‘‘J.E.’’ Hudson, who passed away on 
Monday, September 7 in the comfort of his 
home. 
Born on June 21, 1919 to Milton Edgar 
‘‘Mit’’ Hudson and Florence Irene Dexter Hud-
son, J.E. was one of eight children. From an 
early age, he learned to homestead his land, 
nearly to the point of self-sufficiency, through 
his gardening, hunting, and fishing capabilities. 
J.E.’s devotion to others began with his 
service in the United States Army during 
World War II and after as a beloved commu-
nity member. He was an avid fan of Blue 
Grass Music and was known to travel far and 
wide attending Blue Grass festivals. J.E. trans-
lated his musical passion into his community, 
where he would become widely known at his 
home church, Campground United Methodist, 
for his stellar songleading abilities. 
J.E. treasured time spent with his family, 
many of whom are left to cherish his memory, 
including his daughter, Connie Walker; three 
sons Barney, Jerry, and James Neil Hudson; 
12 grandchildren; 19 great-grandchildren; and 
a host of extended family members and 
friends. 
James Edward ‘‘J.E.’’ Hudson’s life was one 
of service, grace, and love for his family, com-
munity, and country. He will be greatly missed 
by all whom he encountered.

RECOGNIZING OFFICER JAMES 
PHILLIPS 
HON. J. FRENCH HILL 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 9, 2020 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the heroic actions of 
Little Rock Police Officer Mr. James Phillips. 
When Officer Phillips and fellow officers 
were checking on an SUV that had abruptly 
stopped in the road, it soon became clear that 
there was a medical emergency inside the car. 
Officer Phillips immediately took action, and 
after discovering a choking child in the vehicle, 
he pulled the boy from the car and began 
using the Heimlich technique to clear the boy’s 
airway. 
Officer Phillips successfully dislodged the 
piece of candy that had caused the boy to 
choke and helped him regain a stable breath-
ing pattern. 
Thankfully the child, who is almost two- 
years old, was unharmed and returned to his 
parents safely. We thank Officer Phillips for 
his quick, effective action in saving this young 
boy’s life, as well as all the first responders 
who protect our communities every day.

southern Kentucky’s historic Civil War battle-
field. Bill Neikirk led the charge to secure 900- 
acres of land and the battlefield’s iconic struc-
tures in Pulaski and Wayne counties, which 
are now designated as a National Monument 
in the National Park System (NPS). 
In 1991, the National Park Service identified 
the Mill Springs Battlefield as one of the 25

most endangered battlefields in America. 
Since that day, I have worked hand-in-hand 
with Bill Neikirk, the MSBA, the American Bat-
tlefield Trust and stakeholders in Pulaski and 
Wayne counties to rescue the expansive Civil 
War site of the first major victory for the Union 
Army in the western theater. The Battle of Mill 
Springs was the second largest battle to take 
place in Kentucky with some 17,000 soldiers 
engaged in the fight. During the battle, Con-
federate General Felix Zollicoffer became one 
of the first Confederate generals to die in the 
Civil War. He was laid to rest under a large 
white oak tree on the battlefield, now known 
as the Zollie Tree. 
In 1993, the Mill Springs Battlefield was 
designated as a National Historic Landmark, 
catapulting multifaceted efforts to secure addi-
tional tracts of land from Nancy to Monticello, 
Kentucky. In 2006, we worked together to 
build a $1.7 million, 10,000 square-foot Visi-
tor’s Center and Museum, adjacent to the Mill 
Springs National Cemetery. The value of pre-
serving these hallowed grounds became the 
driving force behind the local mission to have 
the Mill Springs Battlefield designated as part 
of the National Park System. On July 17, 
2018, I invited Bill to Capitol Hill to testify be-
fore the U.S. House Committee on Natural 
Resources about the intensive preservation ef-
forts of the MSBA and the desire to present 
the fruits of their labor to the National Park 
Service for everyone to enjoy. Bill’s heartfelt 
testimony was a key turning point in this mon-
umental endeavor. Highlighting the long-time 
legislative efforts to protect our beloved battle-
field for future generations, the Mill Spring Bat-
tlefield National Monument Act was signed 
into law by President Donald Trump on March 
12, 2019, and on September 22, 2020, Interior 
Secretary David Bernhardt officially estab-
lished our new national monument as part of 
the National Park System. 
Over the years, funding was sometimes 
scarce and doors were often closed, but Bill 
Neikirk maintained an unwavering resolve to 
see the Mill Springs Battlefield earn its rightful 
place in the national spotlight. It has been one 
of the greatest honors of my service as the 
U.S. Representative for Kentucky’s Fifth Con-
gressional District to work alongside such a 
great friend and champion for our region, and 
to see the final victory of this battlefield to now 
be included in the National Park System. The 
people of southern Kentucky owe Bill Neikirk 
a great deal of gratitude for preserving this 
rare jewel in our history.

HONORING THE LATE JUSTICE 
RUTH BADER GINSBURG 
HON. LAUREN UNDERWOOD 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 9, 2020 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the life of a woman who 
represented the best of our country: Justice 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg. 
It is difficult to overstate the impact of her 
rulings and legal victories on the lives of 
American women, but today I want to highlight 
what she accomplished simply with her pres-
ence. 
As the first woman to represent my district, 
I often think of the famous incident when the 
Dean of Harvard Law School asked Justice 
Ginsburg and the other women in her class, 
‘‘Why are you here occupying a seat that 
could be held by a man?’’ 
I know I am not the only woman in this 
chamber who has been called upon to defend 
my right to represent my community or even 
take up space in a room. 
For a small person, Justice Ginsburg took 
up a lot of space. 
Her life and work testify that women belong 
in the classroom, on the bench, in Congress, 
and ‘‘in all places where decisions are being 
made.’’ 
I intend to honor her memory by continuing 
to take up space, and I encourage every 
woman and girl in America to do the same.

RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF 
JOHN J. OGDEN, JR. 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 9, 2020 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize World War II veteran 
John J. ‘‘Johnny’’ Ogden, Jr. in commemora-
tion of the 75th Independence Day since the 
end of World War II. 
Johnny grew up in Memphis, Tennessee 
and was drafted into the United States Army 
at Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia on July 23, 1943. 
He was assigned to Company F, 314th Infan-
try Regiment, 79th Infantry Division as a Rifle-
man. 
On April 19, 1944 PFC Ogden landed in 
Glasgow, Scotland and remained in the United 
Kingdom until deploying to Normandy in sup-
port of Operation Overlord on D-Day + 7–June 
13, 1944. Johnny and the 314th entered com-
bat on June 19, 1944 with an attack on the 
high ground northwest of Valognes and the 
high ground south of Cherbourg, France. On 
June 25, the 314th Infantry Regiment captured 
Fort du Roule during fierce fighting. Corporal 
John D. Kelly from Company E and First Lieu-
tenant Carlos C. Ogden from Company K 
were awarded the Congressional Medal of 
Honor as a result of their fearless fighting and 
leadership. For their collective actions, the 
314th Infantry Regiment was awarded a Presi-
dential Unit Citation. 
Following the capture of Cherbourg by Allied 
Forces, Johnny and the 314th Infantry Regi-
ment fought to expand the Allied perimeter at 
Saint-Loˆ in what has subsequently become 
known as the Battle of the Hedgerows. It was 
during this series of engagements that Johnny 
was wounded on August 13, 1944 and evacu-
ated to Exeter, England. 
Johnny recuperated for six months in Eng-
land and was redeployed to France as Allied 
Forces continued to advance to Germany. On 
December 21, 1945 Johnny was discharged at 
Fort Devens, Massachusetts. Subsequently, 
he returned to Memphis, Tennessee before fi-
nally settling with his wife Jean at Moon Lake, 
Mississippi. 
It is because of members of the Greatest 
Generation like Johnny Ogden that America 
was able to restore freedom and liberty to Eu-
rope. He selflessly served this great country 
and his example is an inspiration for genera-
tions to come.

HONORING BLAKE HURST 
HON. SAM GRAVES 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 9, 2020 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker, 
I proudly pause to recognize Blake Hurst. 
Blake is a close friend and fierce leader who, 
after many meaningful years of service, is re-
tiring as president of the Missouri Farm Bu-
reau. 
Blake is a staple of the Missouri agricultural 
community after serving as a district board 
member and Vice President of the Missouri 
Farm Bureau before being elected its Presi-
dent in 2010. He is best known for his passion 
for agriculture and longtime advocacy on be-
half of farmers. Blake has spent a significant 
amount of his life ensuring that farmers across 
the state of Missouri are heard and fighting for 
favorable agriculture policy at the state and 
federal levels. 
Blake’s devotion to the success of agri-
culture in Missouri has exponentially improved 
the life of all in the Sixth District and beyond. 
While the Missouri Farm Bureau will miss the 
institutional knowledge that Blake has brought 
to the table, I’m sure that Blake’s family will 
enjoy having his experienced hand in growing 
their greenhouse business and taking care of 
their own corn and soybeans together. 
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join 
me in recognizing Blake Hurst for his commit-
ment to Missouri agriculture, the state of Mis-
souri and the Sixth Congressional District. I 
am honored to represent him in the United 
States Congress and honored to call him and 
his family my friends and neighbors.

REMEMBERING ARTHUR MICHAEL 
CONNELLY 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 9, 2020 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Arthur Michael Connelly, of 
Vineland, New Jersey, who passed away Sun-
day, September 27, 2020, at the age of 50. 
Born in Youngstown, he was the son of Leo 
Connelly and Patricia Mollica. Art attended 
Howland High School, where he played foot-
ball. He then moved to Marietta, Georgia, 
where he studied at Life College prior to mov-
ing to Vineland, where he has lived for over 
20 years. 
Art was employed as a professional chef by 
career and personal passion. He was the ex-
ecutive chef of Spiaggetta’s in Stone Harbor, 
New Jersey. It was a career that he loved and 
held a deep passion for, and he also loved 
cooking for his family and friends during the 
holidays. He enjoyed landscaping, listening to 
music and trips to the Jersey shore. Above all 
though, Art was a dedicated father. 
Besides his parents, Leo (Doreen) Connelly 
and Patricia Tedesco (Denny) Mollica, Art is 
survived by his loving partner of 14 years, 
Susan Schofield; his two children, Tiffany 
Connelly and Michael Connelly; two brothers, 
Jim Fry and Anthony Connelly; sister, Tara 
Dunmire; and many, many friends. 
My heart breaks for the entire Connelly 
Family, who I have gotten to know through Ar-
thur’s father, Leo, who is a veteran and dedi-
cated advocate for all those who served our 
country in my Congressional District and be-
yond. Words alone cannot express my condo-
lences for the entire family and all whose lives 
were touched by Arthur. 
RECOGNIZING CONWAY REGIONAL 
MEDICAL CENTER 
HON. J. FRENCH HILL 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 9, 2020 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam Speaker, 
today I rise to recognize the wonderful staff 
and administration of Conway Regional Med-
ical Center (CRMC) in Arkansas’ second dis-
trict, as they have recently been awarded 
Magnet by the American Nurses Credentialing 
Center (ANCC). 
This great honor reflects nursing profes-
sionalism, teamwork, and superiority in patient 
care, and one that only 8 percent of hospitals 
nationwide achieve. CRMC provides patient 
care and innovating professional nursing prac-
tice. 
They achieved this status through rigorous 
standards of nursing excellence such as: high-
er patient satisfaction, lower risk 30-day mor-
tality and low failure to rescue rates, higher 
job satisfaction, and higher nurse retention 
rates. 
Conway Regional lives up to its motto to, 
‘‘be bold, be exceptional, and answer the call.’’ 
This is an esteemed staff, who are making Ar-
kansas proud, as they join two Little Rock 
hospitals in receiving this prestige status. I 
congratulate the staff at Conway Regional for 
achieving this status.

RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF 
LLOYD YOUNG 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 9, 2020 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the United States Military 
service of Lloyd Young, a recipient of the Pur-
ple Heart Medal. Lloyd Young, a native of the 
Waterford Community, graduated from college 
in 1967. Prior to entering the Vietnam War, 
Mr. Young attended flight school where he 
learned to fly an Army helicopter. He later be-
came a member of the United States Army 
237th Medical Detachment DMZ DUSTOFF 
Unit. 
On Thanksgiving Day in 1968, Mr. Young 
and a crew chief had just picked up an Army 
of the Republic of Vietnam Soldier who was 
injured. When they attempted to take off, the 
helicopter came under fire. Mr. Young was 
struck by shrapnel in his shoulder and leg. He 
was able to fly the helicopter to a more secure 
spot to make an emergency landing. Mr. 
Young recovered from his injuries in hospitals 
located in Japan and at Fort Benning, Geor-
gia. 
On July 4, 1969, Mr. Young was able to go 
home to Eupora and to his wife, Ann. They 
would raise two children, Catie and Clint. The 
couple have been married 52 years. When 
asked about his military service, Mr. Young 
said it was frustrating to see Vietnam Veterans 
mistreated when they returned to the United 
States. ‘‘I was thankful for the opportunity to 
serve,’’ Mr. Young said. ‘‘I am glad to see that 
Vietnam Vets are getting a little bit of thanks 
now.’’ 
Mr. Young’s service and sacrifices to defend 
our great nation will always be remembered. 
He has led an exemplary life and continues to 
be a well-respected member of the commu-
nity. It is an honor to recognize Mr. Young for 
his outstanding dedication to God, country, 
and family.

HONORING THE MEMORY OF 
MANUEL ‘‘MEMO’’ CAVADA 
HON. JUAN VARGAS 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 9, 2020 
Mr. VARGAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Manuel ‘‘Memo’’ Cavada, community 
leader, artist, and Purple Heart recipient, who 
passed away on Saturday, October 3, 2020, at 
the age of 76. 
Memo was born in National City, CA in 
1944. He attended and graduated from 
Kimball Elementary School, National City Jun-
ior High, and Sweetwater High School. He 
later graduated from Sacramento City College 
and the Glen Fishback School of Photography. 
Memo served honorably in the United 
States Air Force for four years as a Crew 
Chief for 552nd Air Force Squadron in Sac-
ramento, CA. He was a recipient of the Purple 
Heart Medal, and numerous other medals, for 
being wounded in action during the Vietnam 
War. 
Among his many accomplishments, Memo 
was the lead photographer of ‘‘100 Portraits, 
Pioneers, Visionaries & Role Models,’’ a 1994 
collaborative, travelling photographic exhibit 
and book (published in 2001) that highlighted 
the contributions of San Diego’s Mexican- 
American community. He recruited nine other 
Latino photographers to work on this project. 
During a ten-year period, Memo travelled 
with a backpack and his camera gear and vis-
ited numerous villages in Mexico to capture 
the Mexican culture and its people. The beau-
tiful exhibit was also displayed at the State 
Capitol for a month. 
As a community leader, Memo owned and 
operated Creative Images Photography Studio 
in National City, CA for over 45 years, and he 
taught photography at the Centro Cultural de 
la Raza in Balboa Park. 
One of Memo’s most honorable accomplish-
ments was that he developed one of the first 
programs for the prevention of alcohol abuse 
among the youth in the community. The pro-
gram used puppetry, as a revolutionary form 
of entertainment, to convey the message of 
health issues to the children of the National 
School District in National City, CA. 
Additionally, Memo served Sweetwater High 
School for 25 years as a resident photog-
rapher. Along with working on the school year-
book, he devoted his time to career coun-
seling high school seniors. At the average of 
600 seniors per year for 25 years, Memo 
served 15,000 Sweetwater High School stu-
dents. 
In 2012, the National City Chamber of Com-
merce honored Memo as the volunteer of the 
year, and he was recognized not only for his 
service to the organization, but also for his 
contributions to helping others succeed in 
business and community affairs. 
In 2015, Memo was honored as a ‘‘Latino 
Champion’’ by the San Diego Union Tribune. 
He shared the stage with two other honorees, 
Roberto Pozos and Daniel Hernandez, two of 
his dear friends and community activists.
