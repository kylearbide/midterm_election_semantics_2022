PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick 
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: 
Lord God, Father of us all, we thank 
You for giving us another day. 
We are asking again that You look 
with kindness and compassion upon 
Your people. Americans throughout 
the Nation struggle with a life-threat-
ening pandemic while seeking for a re-
turn to some normalcy. The economy 
struggles still for a balance that sus-
tains, and even the education of our 
children is hampered by the chaos that 
COVID–19 has brought to the world. 
Lord, have mercy. 
Continue to bless those who labor to 
attend to the sick among our citizens, 
and those also who strive to find effec-
tive treatments and vaccines. Keep us 
all safe in Your divine mercy. 
May all that is done be for Your 
greater honor and glory. 
Amen.

Tuesday, August 25, 2020 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Rachel Meyer, Executive Director 
Emeritus of CuriOdyssey, a science play-
ground and zoo for children ages 1 to 100. 
Rachel was executive director for 13 years, 
2007 to 2020. She recently departed to find 
new challenges, but she leaves a legacy of 
love and educational achievement. 
CuriOdyssey is nestled under the euca-
lyptus trees at Coyote Point in San Mateo. It’s 
a spectacular setting for a science facility be-
cause the natural splendor of Coyote Point is 
itself something to behold. 
During 
her 
tenure, 
Rachel 
really 
put 
CuriOdyssey on the map. It went from being 
the Coyote Point Science Museum to being 
the place on the Peninsula to bring small chil-
dren, and those a bit older, to learn about 
physics, math, animals and much, much more. 
CuriOdyssey is all about experience. 
Rachel 
Meyer 
brought 
exhibits 
to 
CuriOdyssey that challenged children to im-
merse themselves in science. Under Rachel, 
exhibits reflected how children learn—through 
touching, listening, drawing, reading, jumping, 
grabbing. Many museums are static with thick 
glass separating patrons and the exhibits. At 
CuriOdyssey, it was sometimes necessary to 
put a warning sign discretely on the exhibit so 
that smaller children wouldn’t overwhelm the 
display by trying to physically engage with 
whatever was moving, popping, clanging, 
flashing, howling or flying. 
Rachel was a great fundraiser and under 
her leadership both attendance and donations 
soared. She invited the community to donate 
to an expanded CuriOdyssey and they re-
sponded with gusto. Her team of co-workers 
were talented and dedicated. They raised 
enough money that a new facility will open this 
decade, dedicated to the belief that you can’t 
shut down curiosity even during a pandemic. 
Science education is embedded in the DNA 
of the San Francisco Peninsula, home to 
some of Silicon Valley’s greatest companies 
and to the faculty of many great universities, 
such as Stanford, the University of California, 
Berkeley or the University of California, San 
Francisco. These parents know quality science 
when they see it, and they came by the tens 
of thousands to witness the displays, and to 
teach their children, because of Rachel Mey-
er’s energy and imagination. 
Rachel did not arise from a vacuum. She 
was the Executive Director of the Palo Alto 
Junior Museum and Zoo for 11 years before 
her 13 years at CuriOdyssey. She learned 
about science education through studying 
under a master, Dr. Frank Oppenheimer of the 
Exploratorium in San Francisco. 
CuriOdyssey is a zoo as well as museum. 
The facility is home to animals injured and un-
able to return safely to the wild as well as 
those born in captivity. Rachel was an out-
standing mother to them all even though, if 
asked, the porcupine might not concede the 
point. 
It takes a special kind of educator to lead an 
all-hands-on-deck institution like a children’s 
experiential museum. Rachel was an out-
standing choice. She never let a good deed by 
staff or board go unmentioned, never left a 
fundraising dime hidden beneath the cushions 
on the couch, and always used her love of 
learning through fun to guide CuriOdyssey. 
She is now on a new path in life but it’s 
really the same path: Education and science. 
She 
will 
consult 
and 
stay 
close 
to 
CuriOdyssey. Indeed, the burrowing owls 
might otherwise wonder where their mentor 
has gone. So good was she at burrowing into 
the fabric of our lives that we can scarcely be-
lieve she left her station at Coyote Point. 
Good news for us all: The bald eagle will keep 
us apprised of the sightings, and comings and 
goings, of Rachel. Undoubtedly this noble bird 
will report that Rachel is up to great good in 
the years ahead.

IN HONOR OF ROSA MITCHELL 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 25, 2020 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
celebrate a resident of Detroit, Michigan, Ms. 
Rosa Mitchell, as she celebrates ninety years 
of life. 
A long-time resident of Detroit, Ms. Mitchell 
raised her family in a loving home in the city’s 
southwest 48217 neighborhood. I first met Ms. 
Mitchell when I served in Michigan’s State 
House of Representatives. She is engaged on 
the issues that affect her community and will 
readily share her keen insights. Not only is 
Ms. Mitchell thoughtful and well-spoken, she is 
big-hearted and caring. My staff and I always 
welcome a call or visit from Ms. Mitchell. 
Her strength of character and kind nature 
make her a natural matriarch in her commu-
nity. Rosa Mitchell became a well-known fix-
ture of the community as the former First Lady 
of New Mount Sinai Missionary Baptist Church 
and Springfield Missionary Baptist Church, 
where she often provided counsel to flock 
members in need of spiritual guidance. She is 
an integral part of her neighborhood and can 
be counted on for a warm smile and a friendly 
word. Her daughter Yuvette best describes her 
affable personality in a quote: ‘‘Mama Rosa 
meets no strangers.’’ Rosa Mitchell is simply a 
joy to everyone who knows her. 
Please join me in recognizing this milestone 
and wishing Ms. Rosa Mitchell the happiest of 
birthdays. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF MAYOR 
MICHAEL COPELAND OF OLATHE 
HON. SHARICE DAVIDS 
OF KANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 25, 2020 
Ms. DAVIDS of Kansas. Madam Speaker, it 
is with great sadness that I rise to honor the 
life and service of Mayor Michael Copeland, 
who passed away on August 19, 2020. Mayor 
Copeland was a devoted father and husband, 
who is survived by his wife Maria, and children 
Olivia, Abigail and Joshua. 
Mayor Copeland began his career in public 
service in 1993, when he was elected as 
Ward 4 Councilmember in Olathe. He went on 
to be elected mayor in 2001, an office he held 
until his passing. As Olathe’s longest-serving 
mayor, he was a wonderful champion for his 
beloved community. During his tenure, he 
guided Olathe through a time of unprece-
dented growth and pioneered several pro-
grams to improve the city. One of these initia-
tives, a children’s literacy program called ‘‘I 
Read with Mayor Mike,’’ reached thousands of 
kids in Olathe and was recognized by First 
Lady Laura Bush, who visited Olathe in 2008 
to celebrate the program. 
Not only did Mayor Copeland dedicate his 
life to public service, he also devoted his time 
to charity work. He created the Olathe Mayor’s 
Christmas Tree Fund, which raised more than 
$1.5 million for children’s charities since 2007. 
He received numerous accolades, including 
the Martin Luther King, Jr. Legacy Award 
given by the Olathe Branch of the NAACP, the 
Olathe Chamber of Commerce’s Citizen of the 
Year Award, and the Daily Points of Light 
Award. 
Mayor Copeland leaves behind a legacy 
that has touched the lives of many in the 
Olathe community. During his 20 years of 
service, he added 18 parks and 29 miles of 
trails, opened the new Olathe Community 
Center and new Indian Creek Library, and 
completed the Santa Fe railroad grade sepa-
ration—among many other notable accom-
plishments. 
Personally, I will miss Mayor Copeland’s 
wise counsel. I very much enjoyed each one 
of our many conversations since I took office. 
He was always generous with his time and 
knowledge, willing and eager to represent the 
people of Olathe. 
Madam Speaker, I offer my deepest condo-
lences to Mayor Copeland’s family and 
friends, and all of those who will miss his kind-
ness and leadership.

COMMUNITY 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 25, 2020 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Mark Malchoff, a founding 
member of the Lake Champlain Sea Grant In-
stitute, for his 21 years of service to the North 
Country community, protecting and preserving 
our lakes and native aquatic life. 
Founded in 1999, the Lake Champlain Sea 
Grant Institute aims to raise awareness to im-
prove the environmental health of Lake Cham-
plain, Lake George, and their respective wa-
tersheds, and encourage sustainable eco-
nomic development. Throughout the 21-year 
partnership between State University of New 
York—Plattsburgh 
and 
the 
University 
of 
Vermont, grantees, like Mr. Malchoff, have es-
poused research excellence, public service, 
and a strong dedication to preserving the nat-
ural environment and resources these Lakes 
offer. 
Mr. Malchoff has been a vital part of the 
program’s success from the very beginning. 
He has worked as an Aquatic Resource Spe-
cialist for 21 years based at SUNY—Platts-
burgh and is one of two original staff members 
to still be with the Institute. He has authored 
or co-authored 26 research publications which 
are cataloged by the National Sea Grant Li-
brary and advanced our understanding of the 
natural eco-system in and around Lake Cham-
plain. 
His 
expertise 
has 
shaped 
groundbreaking research on many pressing 
issues in the environment including the trans-
port of crude oil and the prevention of aquatic 
invasive species spread. He has also spent 
some time as an adjunct professor at SUNY— 
Plattsburgh, passing on his knowledge to the 
next generation and inspiring students to fol-
low in his footsteps. 
On behalf of New York’s 21st District, I 
would like to thank Mr. Malchoff for his con-
tributions to the community and congratulate 
him on reaching this important milestone. I 
wish him well in this next chapter of his life.

HON. MIKE KELLY

Tuesday, August 25, 2020 
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, on Saturday, August 22, 2020, I was un-
avoidably detained away from the House 
Chamber. 
Had I been present, I would have voted: 
‘Nay’ on Roll Call Number 179 for bill number 
H. RES. 1092 H.R. 8015 On Ordering the Pre-
vious Question; ‘Nay’ on Roll Call Number 180 
for bill number H. RES. 1092 On Agreeing to 
the Resolution; ‘Yay’ on Roll Call Number 181 
for bill number H.R. 8015 On Motion to Re-
commit with Instructions; and ‘Nay’ on Roll 
Call Number 182 for bill number H.R. 8015 
‘‘Delivering for America Act’’ On Passage. 
For years, the U.S. Postal Service has 
faced serious financial problems that have 
been exacerbated by the coronavirus pan-
demic. Significant reforms are needed at 
USPS to put it on a sustainable path. Already 
this year, Congress has given USPS addi-
tional access to $10 billion worth of funding to 
cover operating expenses of which the Post 
Office has yet to use. Simply delivering an-
other $25 billion—at substantial taxpayer 
cost—without operational changes is bad pol-
icy. Congress must stem the Postal Service’s 
recurrent losses, which have totaled $83.1 bil-
lion since 2006, and reduce its unfunded pen-
sion and healthcare liabilities, which total more 
than $120 billion. Another government bailout 
for an agency that has a long history of fiscal 
mismanagement is not the right answer. The 
systemic challenges of USPS pose no threat 
to the November presidential election, how-
ever. The Postmaster General has assured 
Americans that ‘‘the Postal Service is ready 
today to handle whatever volume of election 
mail it receives this fall.’’ There is no obstacle 
to state Secretaries of State from sending bal-
lots to voters who request them with enough 
time for them to be returned and counted. 
Rather than playing political games, we should 
work together to achieve what we all want, 
which is to count every vote and build a Postal 
Service that works for the 21st century.

HONORING THE LIFE OF CHIEF 
JAMES ‘‘JEB’’ BEALER 
HON. JOHN KATKO 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, August 25, 2020 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Chief James ‘‘Jeb’’ Bealer, 
who tragically passed away on March 22, 
2020. A loving husband, proud father and 
grandfather, and a 50-year member of the 
Howlett Hill Fire Department, Chief Bealer will 
be dearly missed. 
After graduating from Marcellus Central 
Schools and SUNY Cobleskill, Chief Bealer 
went on to serve with the Howlett Hill Fire De-
partment. Starting as an Assistant Secretary, 
he worked his way up the ranks and was 
eventually named Chief of the Department. An 
active member of the Howlett Hill Fire Depart-
ment for 50 years, Chief Bealer was only the 
second person in the Department’s history to 
reach this milestone. In addition to his work 
with the Howlett Hill Fire Department, he also 
gave his time to the Onondaga County Fire 
Chiefs Association, Onondaga County Fire-
man’s Association, New York State Associa-
tion of Fire Chiefs, Firemen’s Association of 
New York, and Western Section Line Officers 
Association. Outside of his career in fire-
fighting, for 35 years Chief Bealer worked for 
the Town of Onondaga Highway Department 
and most recently worked as a bus driver for 
West Genesee Central Schools. 
Personally, Chief Bealer was dedicated to 
his family and friends. He was married to his 
wife Denice for 48 years, and together, they 
have four children and ten grandchildren. A 
role model to his family, Chief Bealer inspired 
his granddaughter to join the Howlett Hill Fire 
Department. Before his passing, he was set to 
present her with an award, celebrating her 
successful completion of fire training. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
House to join me in honoring the life and ca-
reer of Chief James ‘‘Jeb’’ Bealer. A cherished 
member of our Central New York community, 
Chief Bealer will truly be missed. I ask my col-
leagues to keep him and his family in mind as 
we celebrate his life.

creatures. After 39 years as the premiere vol-
unteer at San Mateo County’s science play-
ground and zoo, CuriOdyssey, Linda is pass-
ing the reigns to a new generation of leaders. 
If you listen carefully, you may hear the Barn 
Owls screech as they learn that their most ar-
dent friend and promoter will be leaving. 
The homes of these creatures and dozens 
more were constructed in the 1980’s because 
Linda, working with other members of the 
Board of Directors, led an exceptionally suc-
cessful fundraising effort. This began the pat-
tern: Linda would set a fundraising objective 
and relentlessly pursue it. Simply put, it wasn’t 
easy to tell Linda ‘‘no.’’ 
Having raised funds, she then supervised 
construction of the animal habitats. Today, in 
a peaceful setting amidst the eucalyptus trees, 
children from throughout the region view fal-
cons, hawks, frogs, snakes, guinea pigs, ot-
ters, tortoises, tarantulas, and dozens of other 
creatures which are at home at CuriOdyssey 
typically because they were saved after being 
injured or abandoned. All are attended to by a 
loving staff who communicate that love to the 
legions of young people wide-eyed at the 
chance to see Mother Nature up close. 
CuriOdyssey exists in a community dedi-
cated to science and the environment. Linda’s 
credibility is so highly respected that she was 
able to rescue CuriOdyssey from a near-death 
experience. In 2006 the museum fell on hard 
times and was in danger of closing. Linda and 
a small team secured $600,000 in six weeks 
and a matching contribution that rescued the 
museum. 
In more recent years, Linda and her co- 
chair raised $27 million for an inspiring build-
ing that will be a landmark on the San Fran-
cisco Peninsula. All of this passion arises from 
her 20+ hours of volunteer work performed at 
CuriOdyssey since 1981. Linda has more 
roles than simply that of fundraiser, because 
CuriOdyssey also provides science education 
to hundreds of students, annually, and offers 
summer camps and special events to educate 
the public. Linda is an important influence on 
the offerings of this amazing facility. 
Linda Lanier didn’t start at CuriOdyssey. 
She was President of the Junior League of 
San Francisco in 1984/5 and did community 
volunteer work from 1974 to 1985. She is 
President of the Atkinson Foundation which in-
vests $1 million a year into thriving nonprofits 
in San Mateo County. As you can see, she 
has an eagle eye for philanthropic opportuni-
ties. 
Linda has done all of this and also been a 
remarkable wife, mother and grandmother. 
Her husband is Sterling Sidney Lanier IV, and 
they have two married children, both of whom 
live in Menlo Park. They are Leslie Lanier 
Trigg, [Mike] and sons Cole and Chase, as 
well as Sterling Sidney Lanier V, [Jessica] and 
their son Dylan and daughter Bailey. I suspect 
that all have donated a fair number of hours 
to CuriOdyssey as volunteers. 
Madam Speaker and members, I regularly 
took my small children to CuriOdyssey and re-
member the wonder they experienced when 
they saw the beehive, ran along the hallways 
towards an exhibit or just listened to the sound 
of airplanes landing at the nearby airport. 
Sparking wonder in the mind of a child is 
sparking our nation’s future. CuriOdyssey has 
had many staff, board members and other vol-
unteers over the decades, but I think it’s fair 
to say that it is also a house that Linda built. 
She would say otherwise, and you can’t blame 
her for her modesty. After all, some may won-
der, what about the role of the gray fox or the 
raccoon or the blue-tongued skink? Doesn’t 
their charm also count in the success of this 
science center? Particularly that skink. After 
all, how much cuter does it get than a reptile 
with a blue tongue? 
Indeed, it all counts, but the key point is that 
Linda Lanier counts as a visionary, a fund-
raiser, and a mother to all bright minds within 
her gaze. Linda’s house is a house of joyful 
squeals, gasps of amazement, and the occa-
sional squeak of a creature no doubt respond-
ing, ‘‘Thanks for coming little human. Be well, 
my friend.’’ 
So now from us all in the House of Rep-
resentatives, let us rise and say, farewell 
Linda. I thank Linda for her leadership and vi-
sion. Be well, our friend.
