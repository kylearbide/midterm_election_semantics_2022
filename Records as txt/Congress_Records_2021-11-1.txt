Vol. 167 
WASHINGTON, MONDAY, NOVEMBER 1, 2021 
No. 191 
House of Representatives 
The House met at noon and was 
called to order by the Speaker pro tem-
pore (Ms. DAVIDS of Kansas). 
f 
DESIGNATION OF SPEAKER PRO 
TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC, 
November 1, 2021. 
I hereby appoint the Honorable SHARICE 
DAVIDS to act as Speaker pro tempore on 
this day. 
NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House of Representatives. 
f 
MORNING-HOUR DEBATE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the order of the House of Janu-
ary 4, 2021, the Chair will now recog-
nize Members from lists submitted by 
the majority and minority leaders for 
morning-hour debate. 
The Chair will alternate recognition 
between the parties, with time equally 
allocated between the parties and each 
Member other than the majority and 
minority leaders and the minority 
whip limited to 5 minutes, but in no 
event shall debate continue beyond 1:50 
p.m. 
f 
CONGRESS MUST WORK TOGETHER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, attempting to push through 
yet another socialist spending spree 
this year might be what liberals think 
will help their polling numbers, but it 
is not what the American people need. 
In reality, this bill would exacerbate 
our energy crisis and make our country 
less safe. 
The reckless spending in this legisla-
tion can best be defined as build back 
bankruptcy. 
Right now, in my hometown of Al-
toona, Pennsylvania, gas costs over 
$3.50 a gallon. That is money coming 
directly out of Americans’ pockets. If 
this spending spree is passed, that cost 
will only go up. 
So far, the Biden administration has 
placed a moratorium on new American 
drilling, canceled the Keystone XL 
pipeline, and allowed the Russians to 
produce oil for our allies in Europe. 
This legislation, unfortunately, dou-
bles down on the Biden administra-
tion’s war on American energy. 
This lengthy piece of legislation 
overregulates and overtaxes the nat-
ural gas, coal, and Marcellus shale in-
dustries that provide good wages and 
low-cost power to American families. 
Instead of supporting American en-
ergy, this bill hands out green energy 
tax credits to wind and solar manufac-
turers that are unable to meet the en-
ergy needs of our country. Wind tur-
bines and solar panels are not going to 
heat our homes this winter. 
We need to focus on regaining Amer-
ica’s energy independence. We need to 
focus on lowering energy costs before 
winter sets in. 
This inflation is not transitory. We 
cannot wish this problem away. 
Passing the Green New Deal dressed 
up as infrastructure legislation is not 
the answer to the problem that we are 
currently facing. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage all 
Members of this body to work together 
to pass an infrastructure bill that 
would actually rebuild our roads and 
rebuild our bridges. 
In Congress, we must be responsible 
stewards of the taxpayers’ dollars. We 
need to find a fiscally responsible way 
to build roads and to repair bridges. 
We need to complete the Appalachian 
regional highway system, and we need 
to expand internet access to all citi-
zens across the Commonwealths, across 
the States, and across America. We 
need to do this without mortgaging our 
children’s future. We need to do this 
without ballooning our deficit in a way 
that would hamstring the American 
people for decades to come. 
f 
PAYOUTS TO ILLEGAL 
IMMIGRANTS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, the 
American people are wondering: What 
is the Biden administration thinking? 
Last week, The Wall Street Journal 
reported that the Department of Jus-
tice is negotiating a settlement that 
would give $450,000 per person to illegal 
immigrants. For a parent and child, 
the payout increases to $900,000. 
To put this in context, if a service-
member is killed in action, their next 
of kin receives an insurance payment 
of $400,000. What this means is that the 
Biden administration will pay illegal 
immigrants more than the families of 
America’s fallen heroes. 
That fact alone is repulsive. These 
people broke the law by illegally enter-
ing our country, and now they are 
about to receive a payout from the gov-
ernment. 
That is the kind of welfare mentality 
that is corrupting this country and will 
do nothing but encourage more illegals 
to try to enter our country. 
Shame on President Biden and his 
administration. 
RECOGNIZING MILITARY FAMILY APPRECIATION 
MONTH 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, behind 
every man and woman in uniform are 
family members who exhibit great re-
silience while their loved ones serve 
this great country. 
No matter their backgrounds or 
where life’s journey has taken them, 
these families are all connected by 
service and their collective love for 
America.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6038 
November 1, 2021 
Madam Speaker, November is Mili-
tary Family Appreciation Month, a sol-
emn time when we recognize the innu-
merable military families from all cor-
ners of America. 
We recognize their support for their 
loved ones in uniform and the sac-
rifices that they continue to make 
every day. 
I salute particularly those from the 
Fifth District of North Carolina and 
thank them for their service. 
The simple truth is that every Amer-
ican owes them and their loved ones 
both at home and abroad a profound 
debt of gratitude. 
May we never forget that. 
WHERE IS THE ACCOUNTABILITY 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, if I laid 
over 1,500 pages of text in front of you 
right now, would you be able to tell me 
quickly what is on every single page? If 
the answer is no, that is not surprising. 
Yet, that is exactly what happened 
last week when the majority decided to 
drop the text of the massive socialist 
tax and spending package at a mo-
ment’s notice. 
Does this sound familiar? It is what 
happened 
when 
House 
Democrats 
passed ObamaCare, and nobody had the 
time to read its text either, although 
Republicans made an earnest effort to 
read every page. It is the same irre-
sponsible tactic of passing a bill to find 
out what is lurking beneath its pages. 
Madam Speaker, this process is mak-
ing a mockery of the people’s House, 
and it is downright shameful. It is time 
to stop it.

ant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Be forever blessed, O God, in the 
songs of the saints who have gone be-
fore us, who confessed Your name in 
the living of their days. We praise You, 
the God of our parents and our parents’ 
parents, the Lord of all who have 
graced this Earth. 
To You, O God, the rock, the refuge 
and strength of our forebears, You who 
put their fears to rest that they would 
stand bravely in their well-fought 
fight, to You be all praise for You are 
our hope and stay this day. 
Give welcome to the souls of those 
who have left us to be received into 
Your loving embrace. And then grant 
us Your peace as we hold fast to their 
memory from day to day, knowing that 
they have been rewarded for their toil. 
Now as we receive the legacy of the 
faithful, whose names we lift up to You 
in the silence of our hearts, may our 
days prove as fruitful and our lives as 
wholly devoted to the tasks You call us 
to carry forth, on behalf of all the 
saints who now rest from their labors. 
Remind us that the calm of paradise 
awaits us. In the hope of this promise 
and the strength of Your name we 
pray. 
Amen.

CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL 
EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO 
SUDAN—MESSAGE 
FROM 
THE 
PRESIDENT 
OF 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES (H. DOC. NO. 117–69) 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following message 
from the President of the United 
States; which was read and, together 
with the accompanying papers, referred 
to the Committee on Foreign Affairs 
and ordered to be printed: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides 
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90 
days prior to the anniversary date of 
its declaration, the President publishes 
in the Federal Register and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to 
the Federal Register for publication the 
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional 
emergency 
with 
respect 
to 
Sudan declared in Executive Order 
13067 of November 3, 1997, is to continue 
in effect beyond November 3, 2021. 
Sudan made strides in its transition 
toward democracy since 2019, but the 
military takeover of the government 
and arrest of civilian leaders now 
threaten those positive gains. The cri-
sis that led to the declaration of a na-
tional emergency in Executive Order 
13067; the expansion of that emergency 
in Executive Order 13400 of April 26, 
2006; and the taking of additional steps 
with respect to that emergency in Ex-
ecutive Order 13412 of October 13, 2006, 
Executive Order 13761 of January 13, 
2017, and Executive Order 13804 of July 
11, 2017, has not been resolved. The sit-
uation in Darfur continues to pose an 
unusual and extraordinary threat to 
the national security and foreign pol-
icy of the United States. Therefore, I

CATAWBA INDIAN NATION LANDS 
ACT 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I move to suspend the rules 
and pass the bill (H.R. 1619) to clarify 
the status of gaming conducted by the 
Catawba Indian Nation, and for other 
purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1619 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Catawba In-
dian Nation Lands Act’’. 
SEC. 2. APPLICATION OF CURRENT LAW. 
(a) LANDS IN SOUTH CAROLINA.—Section 14 
of the Catawba Indian Tribe of South Caro-
lina Claims Settlement Act of 1993 (Public 
Law 103–116) shall only apply to gaming con-
ducted by the Catawba Indian Nation on 
lands located in South Carolina. 
(b) LANDS
IN STATES OTHER THAN SOUTH 
CAROLINA.—Gaming conducted by the Ca-
tawba Indian Nation on lands located in 
States other than South Carolina shall be 
subject to the Indian Gaming Regulatory

through 1168 of title 18, United States Code. 
SEC. 3. REAFFIRMATION OF STATUS AND AC-

as if that action had been taken under a Fed-
eral law specifically authorizing or directing

laws and regulations generally applicable to 
land held in trust by the United States for an 
Indian Tribe; and

taken into trust as part of the restoration of 
lands for an Indian tribe that is restored to

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
New Mexico (Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ) 
and the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. 
WESTERMAN) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New Mexico. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous 
material on the measure under consid-
eration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New Mexico? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, today is the first 
day of the month that is dedicated to 
Native American heritage. As we all 
know, 
the 
United 
States’ 
historic 
treatment of our indigenous govern-
ments and peoples is fraught with 
genocide, displacement, termination, 
and 
attempts 
to 
eliminate 
Native 
American culture, language, and iden-
tity. 
But as a Nation, we have also taken 
actions to remedy and to build back 
from that sad history. In 1934, Congress 
recognized that termination was the 
wrong policy and passed the Indian Re-
organization Act, which recognized 
Tribal governments and placed most 
remaining Tribal land into trust. In 
1975, we passed the Indian Self-Deter-
mination Act, which allowed Tribes to 
reassert their sovereignty and jurisdic-
tion over their own lands and programs 
intended to benefit them, but the work 
is far from done. 
Through bipartisan legislation we are 
debating today, and many other legis-
lative initiatives we will undertake 
this 117th Congress, we are furthering 
Tribal recognition and reacquisition of 
Tribal homelands. We are strength-
ening the consultation requirements to 
provide better healthcare to the 70 per-
cent of Native Americans living in 
urban areas. In the infrastructure bill 
and Build Back Better Act, we will 
have historic levels of funding for pro-
grams that meet the trust responsibil-
ities owed to Native Americans, prom-
ised to them as the United States en-
tered into treaties and took over their 
historic lands. 
Our work today declares that it is 
not enough to just acknowledge Native 
American heritage, we must also pass 
the legislation that protects that herit-
age and strengthens Tribal sovereignty 
and self-determination. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank Ma-
jority Leader HOYER
for scheduling 
these bills to be heard today as we 
begin 
Native 
American 
Heritage 
month. I especially want to thank 
Chairman GRIJALVA and Ranking Mem-
ber WESTERMAN for moving the bills 
through the Natural Resources Com-
mittee. 
Madam Speaker, I wish to thank the 
sponsors of the bills and the committee 
staff who dedicate themselves to get-
ting things done on behalf of the indig-
enous peoples of our country. 
Madam Speaker, I will turn to H.R. 
1619. The Catawba Indian Nation Lands 
Act, introduced by Representative CLY-
BURN of South Carolina, will ratify and 
confirm the Department of the Inte-
rior’s decision to take into trust 17 
acres of land in Cleveland County, 
North Carolina, for the benefit of the 
Catawba Indian Nation. 
The Catawba Indian Nation is the 
only 
Federally-recognized 
Tribe 
in 
South Carolina, and its approximately 
3,400 members reside primarily in the 
Catawba River Valley. The current Ca-
tawba Reservation is made up of mul-
tiple parcels of land in South Carolina, 
totaling about 700 acres. 
To improve the Tribal economy and 
meet the needs of Tribal members, the 
Catawba Nation petitioned the Depart-
ment of the Interior to place approxi-
mately 17 acres of land, known as the 
Kings Mountain site, into trust in 
Cleveland County, North Carolina, for 
gaming and other purposes. 
On March 12, 2020, the Department of 
the Interior accepted the Catawba In-
dian Nation’s request to transfer the 
land into trust. The Department’s deci-
sion derived from the terms of the Ca-
tawba Indian Tribe of South Carolina 
Land Claims Settlement Act of 1993, 
which ended the Nation’s fight against 
the State of South Carolina in its as-
sertion of aboriginal land claims. 
The Act not only restored the Fed-
eral trust relationship between the Na-
tion and the Federal Government, but 
it also contained various provisions 
about the trust acquisition of land by 
the Secretary of the Interior, the use of 
such land for gaming, and the applica-
bility of the Indian Gaming Regulatory 
Act.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6040 
November 1, 2021 
Following the announcement of the 
Department of the Interior’s decision, 
the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians 
filed a suit against it to block the Na-
tion’s plans to construct a casino com-
plex at the Kings Mountain site. 
Among other assertions, the Eastern 
Band of Cherokee Indians claims that 
the project will encroach upon its ab-
original territory. However, the histor-
ical records demonstrate the Kings 
Mountain site is within the aboriginal 
and historical lands of the Catawba Na-
tion. 
H.R. 1619 will thus reaffirm the De-
partment of the Interior’s recognition 
of Catawba Indian Nation’s historical 
and ancestral ties to the lands in Kings 
Mountain and the Catawba Nation’s 
right to conduct gaming operations on 
those lands under the terms of the In-
dian Gaming Regulatory Act. 
The legislation will provide much- 
needed economic development opportu-
nities to the Nation and the sur-
rounding local communities. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank Mr. 
CLYBURN for championing this bipar-
tisan legislation, and I urge its quick 
adoption. I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 1619 would rat-
ify and reaffirm a March 2020 decision 
by the Department of the Interior to 
place 17 acres of the land located in 
Kings Mountain, North Carolina, into 
trust for the Catawba Indian Nation. 
In 1980, the Catawba Tribe filed a 
land claim for former Tribal land in 
South Carolina, but the agreement 
they entered with the State failed to 
provide a clear understanding as to 
where the Tribe may have lands held in 
trust, what process is required, or 
whether the Indian Gaming Regulatory 
Act applies to the Catawba Nation. 
By 1993, the Tribe and the State of 
South Carolina entered into an agree-
ment to settle the lawsuit, and the 
South Carolina legislature enacted a 
law ratifying that agreement. 
That same year, Congress ratified the 
settlement agreement by passing the 
Catawba Indian Tribe of South Caro-
lina Land Claims Settlement Act and 
extinguished 
any 
other 
potential 
claims of the Catawba. 
In exchange, the Catawba received 
$50 million, the restoration of their 
status as a Federally-recognized Tribe, 
and a streamlined process for restoring 
its land base in South Carolina. 
But confusion about the Tribe’s land 
continued as it submitted an applica-
tion with the Department of the Inte-
rior to place land in Cleveland County, 
North Carolina, acquired into trust to 
develop a casino. 
Even after the Department of the In-
terior approved the Catawba’s trust ap-
plication, determining that the Tribe 
met the restored lands exemption 
under the Indian Gaming Regulatory 
Act, there were still ambiguities that 
led to a challenge in court. 
Madam Speaker, I hope that this bill 
will 
finally 
resolve 
the 
remaining 
issues and give the Catawba Tribe cer-
tainty about its land and the ways it 
can use it. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gen-
tleman from South Carolina (Mr. CLY-
BURN). 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to call upon this august 
body for a favorable vote on H.R. 1619. 
That is a very interesting number for 
this legislation. This legislation is 
known as the Catawba Indian Nation 
Lands Act. 
The Catawba Indian Nation Lands 
Act clarifies that the Catawba Indian 
Nation is subject to the well-estab-
lished rules and regulations of the In-
dian Gaming Regulatory Act on their 
modern and ancestral lands in the 
State of North Carolina. 
This 
legislation 
will 
clarify 
the 
Tribe’s 1993 Land Claims Settlement 
Act and reaffirm recent action taken 
by the Department of the Interior to 
take land into trust for the Tribe. 
Most importantly, this bipartisan 
legislation is a very significant step to-
ward rectifying historic injustices that 
have been perpetrated against the Ca-
tawba Indian Nation. 
Like, in many other instances of cur-
rent effects of historical inequities, the 
Catawba Nation experiences high un-
employment and poverty rates causing 
many of its citizens to rely upon Fed-
eral and State governments for basic 
social services. 
The enactment of this legislation is 
critical to helping the Catawba Indian 
Nation secure economic self-sufficiency 
as Congress originally intended when it 
passed the Indian Gaming Regulatory 
Act of 1988. 
Madam Speaker, I respectfully ask 
my colleagues for a favorable vote on 
this Act. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from South Carolina 
(Mr. TIMMONS). 
Mr. TIMMONS. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in strong support of H.R. 
1619, the Catawba Indian Nation Lands 
Act. I was proud to partner with the 
majority whip, Mr. CLYBURN, and sev-
eral other of my colleagues from North 
and South Carolina in introducing this 
legislation. 
This bill is straightforward. It would 
simply codify action taken by Presi-
dent Trump’s Department of the Inte-
rior last year, granting 17 acres of the 
Catawba 
Indian 
Nation’s 
ancestral 
lands into trust for the Tribe. 
This action by the Interior Depart-
ment has been held up needlessly in the 
Federal court system, although the 
only decisions so far have been held in 
favor of the Catawbas. This bill would 
cut short that process and confirm the 
ability for the Catawba Indian Nation 
to move forward with their plans for 
this piece of land which, I would note 
again, is most certainly within the bor-
ders of their ancestral homelands. 
This piece of land will be critical in 
providing economic opportunity for a 
community that suffers from above-av-
erage 
unemployment 
and 
poverty 
rates. This will enable self-sufficiency 
and reduce the need for members of the 
Catawba population to rely on Federal 
and State governments for basic social 
services. 
This step has been many years in the 
making, and I am glad to have played 
a small part in getting it done. I would 
also like to thank our partners in the 
Senate, Senators GRAHAM, TILLIS, and 
BURR for spearheading this effort in 
their body. Hopefully, we can get this 
important piece of legislation to the 
President’s desk in short order. 
Madam Speaker, in closing, I would 
like to ask my colleagues to join me in 
support of this bill. It is bipartisan, it 
is common sense, and it will very much 
help the 3,400 members of the Catawba 
Nation in North and South Carolina 
live more prosperous lives. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
North 
Carolina 
(Mr. 
BUTTERFIELD). 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speak-
er, let me first thank Congresswoman 
LEGER FERNANDEZ for her friendship 
and leadership, and thank her for yield-
ing time to me this afternoon. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 1619, the Catawba Indian Nation 
Lands Act. 
A few moments ago, Congressman 
CLYBURN made reference to the fact 
that 1619 was a very significant num-
ber. What he was referring to, Madam 
Speaker, was that it was the year 1619 
that the first slaves arrived in Amer-
ica—the first African slaves, I might 
say, arrived in America. 
b 1615 
It is very interesting that this bill 
bears that number, but I am in full 
support of this legislation. 
Madam Speaker, this is good, bipar-
tisan legislation. You can see that it 
has support on both sides of the aisle. 
It will ratify actions taken by the De-
partment of the Interior that placed 17 
acres of land in North Carolina that 
are within the Catawba’s service area, 
as defined by Congress in 1993, that 
land was placed into trust for the ben-
efit of the Tribe. 
This bill would enable the Catawba 
Indian Nation to secure economic self- 
sufficiency as envisioned by Congress 
in passing the Indian Gaming Regu-
latory Act of 1987. It will generate mil-
lions of dollars in economic develop-
ment and create thousands of jobs in 
North Carolina, where few jobs cur-
rently exist. 
That, Madam Speaker, is why I have 
such a deep interest in this legislation, 
because of the economic impact. 
The Catawba Nation has already 
signed an agreement. I need to make

sure the record is clear about that. The 
Catawba Nation has already signed an 
agreement with our Governor, Gov-
ernor Roy Cooper, and they have the 
support of the local community. 
Madam Speaker, I respectfully urge 
my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this 
important legislation. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Madam Speaker, I think that we 
have heard today about the importance 
of how we are, in essence, making his-
tory by undoing a little bit of the un-
fortunate history of the United States. 
This small parcel of land, which will be 
taken into trust, will yield significant 
benefits for the Tribe. 
I do appreciate the fact that, like all 
the legislation we are considering 
today, it is bipartisan and that all of 
those who are supporting it recognize 
the benefits that it will bring to the 
Catawba Nation. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the legislation, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New Mexico 
(Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 1619. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-

Speaker, I move to suspend the rules

eration.

objection to the request of the gentle-

Madam 
Speaker, 
H.R. 
2758, 
the 
Lumbee Recognition Act, introduced 
by Representative BUTTERFIELD from 
North Carolina, will extend Federal 
recognition to the Lumbee Tribe of 
North Carolina. 
With approximately 60,000 members, 
the Lumbee Tribe is the largest in 
North Carolina, the largest Tribe east 
of the Mississippi River, and the ninth 
largest Tribe in the Nation. 
In 1885, the Lumbee Tribe was recog-
nized by the State of North Carolina.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6042 
November 1, 2021 
The Tribe then sought Federal recogni-
tion from the United States in 1889 and 
has been pursuing its recognition ever 
since. 
Over the past 130 years, numerous 
bills have been introduced in Congress 
to federally recognize the Lumbee peo-
ple, resulting in a significant record of 
hearing transcripts and committee re-
ports. In addition, numerous studies 
have been undertaken in academia on 
Lumbee ancestry, including reports 
filed by the Department of the Interior 
on the Tribe’s validity. 
All of these documents and these re-
ports consistently conclude one thing: 
The Lumbee people are indeed a dis-
tinct, self-governing community that 
has been continuously and undeniably 
present in the Robeson County area. 
However, in 1955, when the Lumbee 
Tribe once again sought Federal rec-
ognition, the U.S. Government was ac-
tively 
terminating 
its 
relationship 
with Tribal governments. 
To that end, the Department of the 
Interior recommended that Congress 
amend the recognition legislation to 
deny eligibility for the benefits and 
services available to the Tribe after be-
coming recognized under the bill. Con-
gress then enacted this amended legis-
lation in 1956, which had the effect of 
simultaneously federally recognizing 
the Lumbee Tribe and effectively ter-
minating that recognition. 
In 1987, the Lumbee Tribe attempted 
to restore their Federal recognition 
through the Federal acknowledgment 
process at the Department of the Inte-
rior. However, the Department deter-
mined that the Tribe was ineligible to 
participate in the Federal acknowledg-
ment process because Congress, accord-
ing to the 1956 act, had terminated its 
relationship with the Tribe. Therefore, 
only Congress could restore that rela-
tionship. This is what the enactment of 
H.R. 2758 will accomplish. 
Federal recognition is the formal es-
tablishment of a government-to-gov-
ernment 
relationship 
between 
the 
United States and a Tribal nation. Its 
importance to Tribes cannot be over-
stated. 
Federal recognition allows a Tribe to 
reestablish its homelands and place 
that land into trust for future genera-
tions. Recognizing Tribes as sovereign 
entities enables Tribal governments to 
manage resources, including local ju-
risdiction and taxation issues. Recogni-
tion also entitles Tribal citizens to dis-
tinctive benefits, including eligibility 
to participate in many Federal pro-
grams, including for healthcare and 
education. 
That is why the enactment of this 
legislation is vital to the Lumbee 
Tribe. Let’s keep in mind that the 
Lumbee Tribe has been seeking formal 
Federal recognition for over 100 years. 
Now is the time. 
Other Tribes that were terminated by 
congressional action had come before 
Congress and had their relationship re-
established through legislation. After a 
century of inaction, it is finally time 
that we extend Federal recognition to 
the Lumbee Tribe. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank 
Representative BUTTERFIELD for cham-
pioning this bipartisan legislation. I 
urge its quick adoption, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 2758 would ex-
tend 
Federal 
recognition 
to 
the 
Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina and 
remove a bar that has prevented the 
Tribe from being federally recognized. 
Recognizing the Lumbee Tribe would 
make its members eligible for services, 
benefits, and immunities available to 
other 
federally 
recognized 
Indian 
Tribes. The bill would also establish a 
service area to deliver Federal pro-
grams to Robeson, Cumberland, Hoke, 
and Scotland Counties in North Caro-
lina. 
In 1956, an act by Congress designated 
certain Indians as Lumbee Indians of 
North Carolina and declared that they 
shall enjoy all rights as citizens of the 
State of North Carolina and the United 
States. At the same time, the act made 
them ineligible for services available 
to recognized Tribes and makes Indian 
statutes inapplicable to them. 
This scheme has led to conflicting 
Department of the Interior solicitor 
opinions 
regarding 
whether 
the 
Lumbee Tribe may pursue administra-
tive recognition. H.R. 2758 would re-
solve those conflicting administrative 
opinions and recognize the Tribe so 
that its Members can receive the bene-
fits that other Tribes have. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank 
Representative DAN BISHOP from the 
State of North Carolina for his leader-
ship on the issue. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
North 
Carolina 
(Mr. 
BUTTERFIELD). 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speak-
er, let me first thank Congresswoman 
LEGER FERNANDEZ for her friendship, 
her extraordinary leadership, and her 
passionate 
leadership. 
The 
gentle-
woman is a wonderful member of this 
body, and I thank her so much for all 
that she does. She and I serve on an-
other committee together, the Elec-
tions Subcommittee, and I have seen 
her in action. 
Madam Speaker, I thank all of our 
cosponsors of this legislation for their 
support, both Democratic and Repub-
lican, including the Tribe’s Represent-
ative, Congressman DAN BISHOP from 
the Ninth District of North Carolina, 
who is my friend. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of my bill, H.R. 2758, the Lumbee 
Recognition Act, and I urge my col-
leagues to vote for its passage. 
Madam Speaker, the Lumbee Rec-
ognition Act will finally extend full 
Federal recognition to the Lumbee 
Tribe of North Carolina and make its 
members eligible for the same services 
and the same benefits provided to 
members of other federally recognized 
Tribes. 
Most importantly, the bill would es-
tablish, once and for all, the Lumbee 
Tribe as an independent and sovereign 
entity under Federal law. 
Madam Speaker, we have an oppor-
tunity before us to do the right thing 
and fix a historic wrong by passing my 
bill. North Carolina has recognized the 
Lumbee Tribe since 1885, and this body, 
the Congress, recognized the Tribe in 
the 1950s but, during the dark days of 
the termination era, refused to allow 
the Lumbee Tribe access to federally 
funded services and benefits. What a 
shame. 
Almost all Tribes that were ‘‘termi-
nated’’ in this troubling era have since 
been restored to Federal recognition. 
We are long overdue in delivering the 
same justice to the Lumbee Tribe. 
This legislation has tremendous bi-
partisan support inside and outside 
North Carolina as demonstrated by a 
unanimous House vote to pass this 
very bill last Congress and President 
Biden’s support for full Federal rec-
ognition of the Lumbee Tribe. Now is 
the time, Madam Speaker, to get it 
done. 
Madam Speaker, the merits of the 
Lumbee’s claim for full Federal rec-
ognition have long been accepted by 
our State of North Carolina, academia, 
and the Federal Government. It is long 
past time for Congress to give the 
Lumbee the respect they deserve and 
to treat them with the fundamental 
fairness that has been withheld for so 
many years. 
As Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ said ear-
lier, this is the first day of Native 
American History Month. What an 
honor. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ and stand on the 
right side of history. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from North Carolina 
(Mr. BISHOP) who has done so much 
work on this issue. 
Mr. 
BISHOP 
of 
North 
Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for yielding, and I thank Rep-
resentative BUTTERFIELD for those fine 
comments. I agree with him 100 per-
cent. 
That bill that Congress passed back 
in 1956 said this, even as it recognized 
the Lumbee: ‘‘Nothing in this act shall 
make such Indians eligible for any 
services 
performed 
by 
the 
United 
States for Indians because of their sta-
tus as Indians, and none of the statutes 
of the United States which affect Indi-
ans because of their status as Indians 
shall be applicable to the Lumbee Indi-
ans.’’ 
My goodness. What an error, what a 
mistake, and what an injustice. But 
that is what the Congress of that time

said, and it is high time for us to cor-
rect that injustice. Therefore, I am 
proud to be a cosponsor with Rep-
resentative 
BUTTERFIELD
and 
Rep-
resentative HUDSON of this legislation. 
The Lumbee have for three centuries 
been a cohesive and distinct commu-
nity of aboriginal origins and durable 
institutions, especially schools, living 
near the Lumber River in Robeson 
County. 
The Lumbee have been called by sev-
eral names, but it cannot be disputed 
that they are the continuously present 
and vital people shown on a map drawn 
in 1725 whose common modern sur-
names appear on a document written in 
1771: Locklear, Chavis, Dees, Sweat, 
and Groom. They are the Lumbee who 
were living in Long Swamp in the 
1730s, the community now known as 
Prospect. 
I said these words last year when it 
appeared very favorable that we were 
going to pass Lumbee recognition then, 
and I am going to say it continuously 
until we get this done, that this is 
going to be the year. 
I know the Lumbee. I know the War-
riors Ball and Lumbee Homecoming, 
UNC-Pembroke and Old Main, the 
Lumbee Cultural Center and the Cozy 
Corner. The Lumbee are supremely pa-
triotic 
Americans, 
God-fearing 
and 
washed in the blood, devoted to the lib-
erating cause of education and to civic 
involvement, proud of their commu-
nity, and loving and welcoming to 
strangers. They are the best of Amer-
ica, and the only honorable course for 
the United States Congress is to accord 
them their due recognition at long 
last. 
So my thank-you to Representative 
BUTTERFIELD for sponsoring this legis-
lation. I thank Representative HUDSON 
and 
Representatives 
GRIJALVA
and 
WESTERMAN for permitting it to come 
forward—staunch 
supporters 
of 
the 
Lumbees’ pursuit of justice. I thank 
Senators BURR and TILLIS. Lumbee rec-
ognition took on new life when both 
North Carolina Senators began to 
champion it. 
Thanks also to former Representa-
tive Mike McIntyre of Robeson County, 
who worked for Lumbee recognition for 
more than a decade. We almost accom-
plished passage last year. This is going 
to be the year. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
urge 
over-
whelming support for the Lumbee Rec-
ognition Act.

Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman for his unwaver-
ing support for his constituents and his 
efforts to work across the aisle. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I have no further requests for 
time, and I would inquire whether my 
colleague has any remaining speakers 
on their side. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker,

the balance of my time. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam

Mr.

Mr.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-

and the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. 
WESTERMAN) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New Mexico. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous 
material on the measure under consid-
eration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New Mexico? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 1975, the Pala 
Band of Mission Indians Land Transfer 
Act of 2021, introduced by Representa-
tive ISSA from California, will direct 
the Secretary of the Interior to take 
721.12 acres of land into trust for the 
Pala Band of Mission Indians. 
The Pala Band of Mission Indians is 
located in northern San Diego County 
with 918 enrolled members. Members of 
the Pala Band belong to the Cupeno 
and Luiseno Tribes who were forced to-
gether by Spanish Franciscan mission-
aries during the 1800s. 
The Pala Band recently purchased 
property that includes the remaining 
portion of Gregory Mountain that is 
not on the existing Pala Band Reserva-
tion and other sacred and culturally 
significant sites in Gregory Canyon. 
The land was purchased to protect and 
preserve Gregory Mountain, Medicine 
Rock, and other sites considered sacred 
by Luiseno Tribes. 
Taking land into trust is an integral 
part of the government-to-government 
relationship between the U.S. Govern-
ment and Tribal governments. By 
maintaining Tribal lands, Tribal gov-
ernments can protect and preserve 
their ancestral homelands or sacred 
sites considered culturally significant. 
This bill takes 721.12 acres into trust 
for the benefit of the Pala Band, ensur-
ing that the sacred sites and cultural 
history located on those lands will be 
honored appropriately and safeguarded. 
The bill also stipulates that current

land and water rights are not affected 
by its enactment, nor are any rights- 
of-way or rights of use that are cur-
rently permitted. 
Lastly, the Pala Band may not con-
duct any gaming activities on the land. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank 
Representative ISSA for championing 
this bipartisan legislation, and I urge 
its quick adoption. I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 1975, the Pala Band of Mission In-
dians Land Transfer Act. 
This bill would place approximately 
721 acres of land located in San Diego, 
California, into trust for the Pala Band 
of Mission Indians. 
As Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ said, gam-
ing pursuant to the Indian Gaming 
Regulatory Act is prohibited on the 
lands to be placed into trust by this 
legislation. In the early 1990s, San 
Diego, California, voters approved a 
plan to establish the Gregory Canyon 
landfill project, but the landfill process 
fell into bankruptcy and the develop-
ment company sold a portion of the 
land to the Tribe for cultural preserva-
tion. The Tribe is now requesting to 
have that land placed into trust to be 
part of the Tribe’s reservation. 
I want to thank Mr. ISSA for his lead-
ership on this issue, and I again urge 
adoption of the measure, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
ISSA). 
Mr. ISSA. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. As the 
chair and ranking member said, this is 
bipartisan, and I am sure will be bi-
cameral, and, in fact, it is necessary 
because not only is H.R. 1975 necessary 
in order to put land in trust, but we, 
for more than 20 years now, have had 
to put most land that gets into trust in 
trust because of action by the Con-
gress. 
I want to take this opportunity on 
behalf of the 18 Tribes that I represent 
and have represented for most of my 20 
years in Congress and say that this is 
the kind of bill that I hope we will pass 
further legislation to make unneces-
sary. The essential right of our first 
people to reclaim their ancestral land 
and have it placed into trust on a pro 
forma basis, on a nearly automatic 
basis, should not require action by 
Congress time and time again. 
The Pala Band of Indians had to buy 
this land at their own expense in order 
to gift it, essentially, to the Federal 
Government. They do so because of the 
importance of their ancestral land and 
their pride in the people they are and 
the people they have been since before 
man, Western man, walked into Cali-
fornia and disrupted their lives. 
So I am proud that, once again, we 
are putting land in trust. I am proud of 
the Pala Indians who worked for more 
than 30 years to recapture this land, to 
keep it from being effectively taken 
away in perpetuity. They have done 
the right thing. 
They have reinvested their hard- 
earned money, in fact, on putting, for 
their nearly 1,000 members, together a 
future of Tribal land in which the pub-
lic can be aware will be taken care of 
better than it was under private land. 
It is interesting to me that, in fact, 
we have had to get assurances that the 
Tribe would not use this for gaming, 
which is understood. But the idea that 
they cannot use it—they do not, in 
fact, regain their water rights that 
they historically would have, and oth-
ers—quite frankly, is a giveaway that 
should not be necessary. 
I am happy to take the opportunity 
to thank the chairman and ranking 
member, but I ask that we really take 
a hard look at the inefficiency of the 
system that has caused every single 
land in trust that has been done for my 
18 Tribes, or many of my 18 Tribes over 
20 years, to require this action. 
I believe we should streamline the 
process to make the bias in favor of the 
Tribe’s right to reclaim their land, to 
place it, in fact, into what is trust 
land, which is another name for it be-
longs to the Federal Government even 
though it has been bought out of the 
hardworking representatives in my dis-
trict; in this case, Pala. 
So I want to thank the gentleman for 
moving this. I believe this is non-
controversial. I know I brought up a 
point that is more controversial which 
is getting the bureaucracy to do a job 
they should do on behalf of Tribes 
throughout 
the 
United 
States. 
As 
somebody who has been honored to rep-
resent much of Indian Country in Cali-
fornia, I hope I speak accurately for all 
18 Tribes that they believe that what 
was theirs and is theirs again, should 
be placed in trust as soon as possible. 
I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman for his advocacy 
on the part of his constituents. I do 
again urge adoption of this. 
I am ready to close, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I do want to thank Represent-
ative ISSA, Representative WESTERMAN, 
and Chair GRIJALVA for moving this bi-
partisan bill forward and taking the ac-
tion that is required at this time to en-
sure that the Pala Band of Indians can, 
indeed, control this land for their sa-
cred and cultural sites. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support the bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New Mexico 
(Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 1975. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are

URBAN INDIAN HEALTH CONFER 
ACT 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I move to suspend the rules 
and pass the bill (H.R. 5221) to amend 
the Indian Health Care Improvement 
Act to establish an urban Indian orga-
nization confer policy for the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5221 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

SEC. 2. URBAN INDIAN ORGANIZATION CONFER 
POLICY. 
Section 514(b) of the Indian Health Care 
Improvement Act (25 U.S.C. 1660d) is amend-
ed to read as follows:

cies and offices of the Department confer, to 
the maximum extent practicable, with urban

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6045 
November 1, 2021 
The Indian Health Care Improvement 
Act established Urban Indian Organiza-
tions in response to many American In-
dians and Alaska Natives living in 
urban areas and seeking healthcare. 
Today, approximately 70 percent of all 
American Indians and Alaska Natives 
live in urban areas. 
The Indian Health Service supports 
contracts and grants to 41 UIO pro-
grams that offer medical services rang-
ing from dental care, optometry, phar-
macy services, and community serv-
ices, such as alcohol and drug abuse 
prevention, nutrition education, and 
counseling. 
An urban confer policy at HHS will 
serve as the preferred method of dia-
logue between the agency and UIOs. 
Currently, the Indian Health Service is 
the only agency that maintains a legal 
obligation to confer with UIOs. This 
limited scope serves as a barrier for 
UIOs to communicate with other agen-
cies and offices within HHS. 
During the COVID–19 pandemic, the 
issues with this limited confer policy 
were, sadly, highlighted. Despite con-
gressional and Tribal support for the 
inclusion of UIOs and the agency’s vac-
cine allocations, HHS refrained from 
initiating communications with them. 
As a result, UIOs were unable to pro-
vide input on the vaccine rollout allo-
cations until the deadline, which de-
layed the vaccine’s distribution to 
many urban American Indians and 
Alaska Natives. 
The failure to communicate with 
UIOs about healthcare policies that im-
pact urban Indian communities is in-
consistent with the Federal trust re-
sponsibility and contrary to sound pub-
lic health policy. 
H.R. 5221 will establish direct lines of 
communication for UIOs across the en-
tire Department and ensure that urban 
American Indians and Alaska Natives 
are aware of significant healthcare pol-
icy changes. 
I want to thank Chair GRIJALVA for 
championing this critical bipartisan 
legislation. I am pleased to be a co-
sponsor of the bill and I urge quick 
adoption. I reserve the balance of my 
time.

Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, today, the Indian 
Health Services Urban Indian Health 
Program consists of 41 nonprofit pro-
grams nationwide. 
These programs are funded through 
grants and contracts from the Indian 
Health Service, pursuant to the au-
thorities of the Indian Health Care Im-
provement Act. 
Urban Indian health organizations 
that participate in the program provide 
services such as information, outreach 
and referral, dental services, primary 
care services, community health, and 
other important services. 
In 2010, as part of the Patient Protec-
tion and Affordable Care Act, Congress 
reauthorized and amended the Indian 
Health Care Improvement Act by add-
ing a requirement that the Indian 
Health Service confer with urban In-
dian organizations. 
In 2014, the Indian Health Service es-
tablished a policy to guide when the In-
dian Health Service seeks input from 
Urban Indian Organizations on health 
policy matters. 
Other agencies within the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services 
that serve American Indians and Alas-
ka Natives, such as the Centers for 
Medicare and Medicaid Services, the 
Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention, and the Substance Abuse and 
Mental Health Services Administra-
tion, and others, do not have policies 
regarding conferring with Urban Indian 
Organizations. 
Throughout the COVID–19 pandemic, 
Urban 
Indian 
health 
organizations 
were provided no notice that they were 
required to make selections for COVID– 
19 vaccine distribution until the day of 
the deadline imposed by an agency.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6046 
November 1, 2021 
This resulted in Urban Indian Organi-
zations struggling to provide accurate 
responses to changing public health de-
cisions for Indians living in urban 
areas. 
This bill would amend the Indian 
Health Care Improvement Act to re-
quire all agencies within the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services to 
establish an urban Indian organization 
confer policy. 
I thank the sponsor of this legisla-
tion, Chairman GRIJALVA, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I yield as much time as he 
may consume to the gentleman from 
Arizona (Mr. GRIJALVA), the chairman 
of the Natural Resources Committee. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, as 
stated before, today marks the first 
day of National Native American Her-
itage Month. 
I want to thank the gentlewoman 
from New Mexico, the chair of the Sub-
committee on Indigenous Peoples of 
the United States, Ranking Member 
WESTERMAN, 
and 
Ranking 
Member 
YOUNG for putting a package together 
for Congress to vote specifically on sig-
nificant bipartisan pieces of legislation 
that 
deal 
specifically 
with 
Indian 
Country. I think it is noteworthy and 
symbolic, and as you see these pieces of 
legislation, very much necessary. I 
want to extend my thanks to all of 
them for that. 
While it is a time to celebrate the 
histories and achievements of Native 
Americans in this country, it is also a 
time for Congress to fully recognize the 
trust and treaty obligations the U.S. 
Government owes to Tribal govern-
ments and to indigenous people in our 
country. 
Ensuring equity for Tribal healthcare 
entities is an essential part of the Fed-
eral trust responsibility, which is the 
reason that I am proud to sponsor H.R. 
5221, the Urban Indian Health Confer 
Act. 
The accessible and culturally com-
petent healthcare services that Indian 
Health Services provides to Tribal 
communities are critical to ensuring 
their well-being. 
As stated by the chairwoman, over 70 
percent of American Indians and Alas-
ka Natives began seeking healthcare 
outside of Tribal jurisdictions in our 
cities and nonreservation communities 
across this country. Urban Indian Or-
ganizations, UIOs, were created to fill 
that gap. 
Today, IHS supports 41 of these pro-
grams that offer vital medical services, 
including dental care, mental health 
support, optometry services, and social 
services, such as nutrition, education, 
and home healthcare. 
Although UIOs have been recognized 
as critical components of the Tribal 
healthcare system, they continue to 
experience parity and recognition of 
purpose and the attention that they de-
serve for the services they provide to 
indigenous people and the family serv-
ices they provide to nonreservation Na-
tive people across this country. 
At the Department of Health and 
Human Services, only IHS maintains 
an obligation to confer with UIOs re-
garding any healthcare policy changes 
that may affect urban Indian commu-
nities. This issue became glaringly ob-
vious during the COVID–19 pandemic, 
when the Department excluded UIOs in 
the vaccine rollout discussions, leaving 
urban Indian communities among the 
last to receive vaccine allocations 
through their local urban Indian cen-
ters. 
As a Member of Congress who rep-
resents a UIO, the Tucson Indian Cen-
ter, I am grateful for their essential 
work to keep Tribal communities safe 
and healthy, especially as we go into a 
post-COVID–19 pandemic era. 
H.R. 5221 will establish direct lines of 
communication between UIOs and the 
Department of Health and Human 
Services so that UIOs have a seat at 
the 
table 
for 
all 
relevant 
Tribal 
healthcare policy changes. 
Ensuring that UIOs achieve equity at 
the Department is sound public health 
policy and upholds the U.S. Govern-
ment’s Federal trust responsibility to 
Indian Country. H.R. 5221 represents a 
much-needed change. 
Madam Speaker, I urge the quick 
adoption of this bipartisan legislation. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I am ready to close, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I want to, once again, thank 
Ranking Member WESTERMAN, as well 
as Ranking Member DON YOUNG and 
Chair GRIJALVA, for bringing forth this 
legislation. It addresses immediately 
something that we saw that had lin-
gered, but the pandemic shown its ugly 
light on what happens when we let 
things linger and do not deal with 
them. This legislation fixes that. It 
highlights the importance of commu-
nication, of cooperation, and the confer 
policy that must be adopted across all 
of our agencies, not only at HHS. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New Mexico 
(Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 5221. 
The question was taken.

Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

and the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. 
WESTERMAN) each will control 20 min-

woman from New Mexico. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous 
material on the measure under consid-
eration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New Mexico? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 3616, the Bear River National Her-
itage Study Act, introduced by my 
Natural 
Resources 
Committee 
col-
league, Representative BLAKE MOORE. 
H.R. 3616 would direct the Secretary 
of the Interior to study the suitability 
and feasibility of establishing the Bear 
River National Heritage Area. 
The study area would include seven 
counties in northern Utah and south-
eastern Idaho, focusing on areas that 
are within the main drainage area of 
the Bear River. 
Heritage area designations are lo-
cally driven initiatives that leverage 
Federal resources to support the pres-
ervation of shared heritage in a man-
ner that boosts conservation, recre-
ation, 
and 
economic 
development. 
These shared stories are vital, as we 
consider what is the American story. 
These heritage centers have proven 
successful all over the country, and I 
am pleased to support this bill that 
will examine the potential of the Bear 
River region. 
I look forward to continuing to work 
with my colleagues to ensure a success-
ful and sustainable future for the en-
tire Heritage Area program and would, 
again, like to congratulate Representa-
tive MOORE for championing this bill 
on behalf of his constituents. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I first want to 
thank Chairman GRIJALVA and Chair-
woman LEGER FERNANDEZ for their co-
operation in moving this bill forward. 
H.R. 3616, offered by my colleague, 
Mr. MOORE of Utah, requires the Sec-
retary of the Interior to conduct a 
study assessing the suitability and fea-
sibility of designating the Bear River 
National Heritage Area in northern 
Utah and southern Idaho. 
The Bear River area straddles the 
Utah-Idaho border where the Great 
Basin and Rocky Mountains meet. It is 
home to the Northwestern Band of the 
Shoshone Nation, the Golden Spike Na-
tional Historical Park, the Bear River 
Migratory Bird Refuge, the Hardware 
Ranch, numerous Latter-day Saints 
history sites, the Oregon Trail, and a 
strong agricultural economy and abun-
dant natural beauty. 
The Bear River area is a great can-
didate for study as a potential national 
heritage area, and this legislation en-
joys strong local support. 
I commend Congressman MOORE for 
his work on this legislation, and I urge 
adoption of the measure. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from Utah (Mr. MOORE). 
Mr. MOORE of Utah. Madam Speak-
er, I thank the ranking member of the 
House Natural Resources Committee 
for his support of this legislation and 
also to my colleague from New Mexico, 
Representative LEGER FERNANDEZ, for 
her kind words of support and her sup-
port of the bill overall, as well as, most 
importantly, our committee staff. I 
thank them all very much. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of H.R. 3616, the Bear 
River National Heritage Area Study 
Act, which would conduct a study to 
determine the area’s suitability for a 
national heritage area designation. 
This would help local communities in 
the area protect important elements of 
their heritage and promote the area’s 
tourism industry. 
This important bill enjoys significant 
local support and, if enacted, would 
help the region better share its incred-
ible history with the world. 
The 
Bear 
River 
basin, 
which 
stretches through northern Utah and 
southeastern Idaho, played a key role 
in the settling, expansion, and develop-
ment of the American West. 
Native American Tribes, such as the 
Shoshone, called this area home be-
cause of its lush environment and fa-
vorable weather. Today, with the con-
struction of the Boa Ogoi Cultural In-
terpretive 
Center 
in 
southeastern 
Idaho, these stories will soon be told 
like never before. 
Eventually, 
explorers 
and 
adven-
tures, fur trappers, and religious pio-
neers also settled in the area and began 
to build homes. The region’s natural 
water supply makes it ideal for farm-
ing, and it quickly became home to 
thriving frontier towns. Generations of 
family farms in northern Utah and 
southeast Idaho can trace their origins 
to these early days. 
Later, the driving of the golden spike 
at Promontory Summit marked the 
completion of the transcontinental 
railroad, an element of pride for the en-
tire 
area. 
This 
pivotal 
moment 
launched our great Nation onto the 
global stage and into the modern 
world. 
Today, this special place is home to 
thriving communities that support jobs 
in the tech, agriculture, education, 
manufacturing, service, and tourism 
industries. 
As we look backwards to retell the 
history of this region, these industries 
are looking forward to writing the next 
chapter of the Bear River basin’s story. 
I am grateful for Chairman GRI-
JALVA, Ranking Member WESTERMAN, 
Representative LEGER FERNANDEZ, and 
their fantastic staff for all their help 
on this effort. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all my col-
leagues to join me in supporting the 
Bear River National Heritage Area 
Study Act. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman for bringing this 
to our attention, I urge adoption, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this bill. I look forward to listen-
ing to the many interconnected and 
complex stories that will come out of 
this study and to perhaps visiting the 
heritage area in the near future. I urge 
my colleagues to support the legisla-
tion, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New Mexico 
(Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 3616. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being

AUTHORIZING 
THE 
SEMINOLE 
TRIBE OF FLORIDA TO LEASE 
OR TRANSFER CERTAIN LAND 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I move to suspend the rules 
and pass the bill (S. 108) to authorize 
the Seminole Tribe of Florida to lease 
or transfer certain land, and for other 
purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 108 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. APPROVAL NOT REQUIRED TO VALI-
DATE 
CERTAIN 
LAND 
TRANS-
ACTIONS OF THE SEMINOLE TRIBE 
OF FLORIDA. 
(a) 
IN
GENERAL.—Notwithstanding 
any 
other provision of law, without further ap-
proval, ratification, or authorization by the 
United States, the Seminole Tribe of Florida 
may lease, sell, convey, warrant, or other-
wise transfer all or any part of the interest 
of the Seminole Tribe of Florida in any real 
property that is not held in trust by the 
United States for the benefit of the Seminole 
Tribe of Florida. 
(b) TRUST LAND NOT AFFECTED.—Nothing 
in this section— 
(1) authorizes the Seminole Tribe of Flor-
ida to lease, sell, convey, warrant, or other-
wise transfer all or any part of an interest in 
any real property that is held in trust by the 
United States for the benefit of the Seminole 
Tribe of Florida; or 
(2) affects the operation of any law gov-
erning 
leasing, 
selling, 
conveying, 
war-
ranting, or otherwise transferring any inter-
est in any real property that is held in trust 
by the United States for the benefit of the 
Seminole Tribe of Florida. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
New Mexico (Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ) 
and the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. 
WESTERMAN) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New Mexico. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous 
material on the measure under consid-
eration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New Mexico? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, S. 108, introduced 
by Senator RUBIO of Florida, will allow 
the Seminole Tribe of Florida to lease, 
sell, convey, warrant, or transfer its 
real property that is not held in trust 
by the United States. 
The Seminole Tribe of Florida is a 
federally recognized Tribe with its 
Tribal headquarters located in Holly-
wood, Florida. It is one of three feder-
ally recognized Seminole entities, and 
many of its enrolled members reside on 
its six reservations in Florida. 
In recent decades, a large portion of 
the 
Tribe’s 
economic 
development 
strategy has been its investment in 
commercial real estate properties. So 
far the Tribe owns one of the largest 
cattle operations in the U.S., along 
with the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino 
franchise and its 74 international prop-
erties. 
To manage the Tribe’s growing port-
folio, the Tribal Council established a 
commercial 
real 
estate 
investment 
fund to help create generational sta-
bility for the Seminole Tribe. Ulti-
mately, the Tribe’s hope is to establish 
a State-chartered subsidiary entity to 
act as a holding company for certain 
properties owned by the Tribe. 
Unfortunately, the Tribe has been 
unable to move forward with this 
project due to concerns raised by lend-
ers and proposed title insurance com-
panies about the Indian Nonintercourse 
Act. 
The act prohibits any ‘‘purchase, 
grant, lease, or other conveyance of 
lands, or of any title or claim thereto, 
from an Indian nation or Tribe of Indi-
ans’’ unless authorized by Congress. 
At least two title insurance compa-
nies approached by the Tribe have in-
terpreted the act to apply to real es-
tate owned by a State-chartered sub-
sidiary entity of the Tribe. As such, 
the title companies will not insure the 
mortgage without an exemption from 
the act, which in turn effectively kills 
any ability to finance an acquisition. 
S. 108 will, therefore, provide relief 
from the Indian Nonintercourse Act by 
clarifying that the Seminole Tribe of 
Florida has the authority to lease, sell, 
convey, warrant, or otherwise transfer 
their interests in property not held in 
trust by the Federal Government with-
out further approval from the Federal 
Government. 
This bipartisan effort is led in the 
House by the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. SOTO), who is the sponsor of the 
House companion bill. I congratulate 
him on his strong advocacy to get this 
legislation to the President’s desk. 
S. 108 will allow the Seminole Tribe 
the ability to continue its economic 
development, and I urge my colleagues 
to vote in favor of this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman 
GRIJALVA
and 
Chairwoman 
LEGER 
FERNANDEZ
for working together on 
this bill. I rise in support of S. 108. It is 
a bill that authorizes the Seminole 
Tribe of Florida to lease or transfer 
certain land, and for other purposes. 
As Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ described, 
this bill would exempt lands held in fee 
by the Seminole Tribe of Florida from 
the limitations imposed by the Indian 
Nonintercourse Act, which restricts a 
Tribe from leasing or conveying any 
lands a Tribe owns without Federal ap-
proval. 
The act has generated a great deal of 
confusion and litigation about whether 
a Tribe can buy, sell, or lease land that 
it owns. The bill states that the act 
does not authorize the Tribe to lease, 
sell, convey, warrant, or otherwise 
transfer all or any portion of any inter-
est in any real property that is held in 
trust. 
This bill was introduced in response 
to real estate investment issues en-
countered by the Seminole Tribe, since 
at least two title insurance companies 
would not grant the Tribe insurance. 
The bill ensures that the act does not 
interfere with the ability to convey fee 
land owned by the Tribe, which would 
impede the Tribe’s economic develop-
ment activities and hinder job cre-
ation. 
Madam Speaker, I am prepared to 
close. I urge adoption of the measure, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I am grateful for this bipar-
tisan legislation. I also think it gives 
us a path forward on what we might 
need to do for all Tribes who encounter 
this issue, but for now I am very much 
in support of S. 108 and urge my col-
leagues to support the legislation. 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New Mexico 
(Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, S. 
108. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Madam Speak-
er, on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed. 
f 
OLD PASCUA COMMUNITY LAND 
ACQUISITION ACT 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I move to suspend the rules 
and pass the bill (H.R. 4881) to direct 
the Secretary of the Interior to take 
into trust for the Pascua Yaqui Tribe 
of Arizona certain land in Pima Coun-
ty, Arizona, and for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous 
material on the measure under consid-
eration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New Mexico? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 4881, the Old 
Pascua Community Land Acquisition 
Act, introduced by the gentleman from 
Arizona (Mr. GRIJALVA), the Natural 
Resources Committee Chair, will direct 
the Secretary of the Interior to take 
approximately 30 acres of land into 
trust for the Pascua Yaqui Tribe. 
The Pascua Yaqui Tribe is located in 
southern Arizona, near the city of Tuc-
son, and has approximately 22,000 en-
rolled Tribal members, with a 2,216- 
acre reservation. 
Before the Federal recognition of the 
Pascua Yaqui Tribe, Yaqui leaders, 
local leaders, and others worked to-
gether to establish a home for Tribal 
citizens. In 1921 these efforts led to the 
formal Pascua Village in Tucson, Ari-
zona. 
Before the formal Federal recogni-
tion and the establishment of a res-
ervation in 1978, former Congressman 
Mo Udall of Arizona introduced a bill 
to establish 202 acres of land southwest 
of Tucson to the Pascua Yaqui Associa-
tion. 
While many families relocated to 
this new land base, many other fami-
lies remained in the Pascua Village, 
known as Old Pascua. With the grow-
ing city of Tucson and the geographic 
distance from the formal reservation, 
the Tribe has worked to ensure the 
Tribal 
members 
living 
within 
the 
Pascua Village have remained cared 
for, including working with the Bureau 
of Indian Affairs to designate Old 
Pascua as near-reservation lands. 
Earlier this year, the Tribe entered 
into a State-negotiated compact with 
the State of Arizona to provide gaming 
activities in the Old Pascua commu-
nity. The Secretary of the Interior ap-
proved the compact in May 2021. 
Further, the Tribe signed an inter-
governmental agreement with the city 
of Tucson to transfer a parcel of land 
within Tucson into trust for the ben-
efit of the Tribe. 
This bill ensures the Old Pascua com-
munity remains intact with the Tribe’s 
homelands, and the bill will allow the 
Tribe to conduct gaming activities, ex-
pand economic development opportuni-
ties, and engage in cultural practices 
on their historic land. 
I am pleased to cosponsor H.R. 4881, 
which is a bipartisan bill, with support 
from the Pascua Yaqui Tribe, the city 
of Tucson, the State of Arizona, and 
the Arizona delegation. I support the 
Old Pascua Community Land Acquisi-
tion Act, and I urge my colleagues to 
vote in favor of the bill. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, the Pascua Yaqui 
Tribe owns several parcels of land that 
it would like to use for gaming. This 
bill allows them to do that. 
In May of 2021, the Governor of Ari-
zona and 21 Tribes amended the Ari-
zona Tribal State Gaming Compact to 
build a third gaming facility in the 
compact-designated area in Tucson. 
The 
compact-designated 
area 
is 
known as the Old Pascua community, 
an area with deep historic ties to the 
Tribe. The compact requires land to be 
taken into trust by an act of Congress 
to open the gaming facility. H.R. 4881 
does this by requiring the Secretary of 
the Interior to place any land owned by 
the Tribe within the compact-des-
ignated area into trust for gaming pur-
poses. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I yield such time as he may 
consume to the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. GRIJALVA), the chair of the 
Natural Resources Committee. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman from New Mex-
ico (Ms. LEGER
FERNANDEZ) for the 
time 
and 
to 
Ranking 
Member 
WESTERMAN. 
I am proud to represent the Pascua 
Yaqui Tribe in Arizona’s Third Dis-
trict. We both call southern Arizona 
our home. The Yaqui people are an in-
tegral and historic part of the fiber of 
southern Arizona, reflecting our his-
tory, our cultures, and our people. 
H.R. 4881, the Old Pascua Community 
Land Acquisition Act, will take a 30- 
acre parcel of land into trust for the 
Pascua Yaqui Tribe, the area known lo-
cally and to the Tribe as Old Pascua 
community. 
As the gentlewoman from New Mex-
ico outlined in her comments, as well 
as the ranking member, this was the 
initial focal point for the Yaqui people 
as they fled persecution. While some 
families relocated to this new land 
base, many families remained in the 
Pascua Village community, known as 
Old Pascua. 
At the time in 1921, it was an isolated 
area outside the community and out-
side of Tucson, but things have grown 
out around them. I think the Yaqui 
community in Tucson, Arizona, con-
siders Old Pascua not only the for-
mally recognized area for the commu-
nity but also a sacred site for the 
Tribe. 
Before receiving Federal recognition 
and a formal reservation south of Tuc-
son, 
many 
Pascua 
Yaqui 
families 
called Old Pascua in Tucson their 
home. 
Today many families still call Old 
Pascua home, yet they continue to fear 
losing their Yaqui knowledge, culture, 
history, and traditions due to the en-
croachment of the growing city of Tuc-
son. Other areas of concern for Yaqui 
families include the lack of ownership 
for sacred, cultural, traditional, and re-
ligious grounds. 
The Tribe has worked tirelessly to 
ensure that they take care of their 
Tribal citizens. Earlier this year, as 
Mr. WESTERMAN outlined, the State of 
Arizona and the Tribe negotiated a

State compact. This compact included 
gaming activities in the Old Pascua 
community to promote the Tribe’s gov-
ernmental operations, cultural and re-
ligious activities, job creation, in-
creased Tribal housing, social and com-
munity services, healthcare, and edu-
cational facilities. 
The Tribe has worked tirelessly with 
the State of Arizona, the city of Tuc-
son, and the county of Pima to address 
their concerns, and have entered into 
an intergovernmental agreement sup-
porting the legislation and the land 
transfer. 
Since this agreement, the State has 
negotiated a compact that reflects that 
agreement and approved it, and the De-
partment of the Interior has approved 
it. 
H.R. 4881 is a bipartisan bill that will 
raise the Tribal standard of living, im-
prove system coordination and integra-
tion of service delivery, and promote 
the ongoing transmission of Yaqui 
knowledge, culture, history, and tradi-
tions for future generations. 
This bill is a bipartisan bill. It merits 
the support of all Members, and I 
would add that it is for the people in 
southern Arizona an extension of a re-
ality and a confirmation of something 
that already exists. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
b 1715 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, this bill, once again, dem-
onstrates that there is strong bipar-
tisan support for our Native American 
tribes and indigenous communities. I 
thank Ranking Member WESTERMAN as 
well as Ranking Member DON YOUNG on 
the Subcommittee for Indigenous Peo-
ples of the United States. 
The other thing this bill does, as has 
been highlighted by Chairman GRI-
JALVA, is it comes out of collaboration 
and conversation with everybody on 
the ground, the local communities, the 
States, the county, the Tribe. The peo-
ple of southern Arizona are asking us 
to take action, and that is what we 
must do today. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New Mexico 
(Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 4881. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Madam Speak-
er, on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
New Mexico (Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ) 
and the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. 
WESTERMAN) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New Mexico. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous 
material on the measure under consid-
eration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New Mexico? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
H.R. 2088, the Eastern Band of Cher-
okee Historic Lands Reacquisition Act, 
introduced 
by 
Representative 
FLEISCHMANN
from Tennessee, takes 
specified lands and easements in Mon-
roe County, Tennessee, into trust for 
the use and benefit of the Eastern Band 
of Cherokee Indians. 
These areas include the Sequoyah 
Museum, the Chota Memorial, the 
Tanasi Memorial, and land to support 
these properties and cultural programs. 
The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indi-
ans is one of three federally recognized 
Cherokee Tribes and is the only feder-
ally recognized Tribe in North Caro-
lina. 
The Eastern Band’s ancestral home-
land includes substantial parts of seven 
eastern States, including Tennessee. 
The 57,000-acre Qualla Boundary is the 
name of the Cherokee Indian Reserva-
tion in North Carolina. 
In 1979, the completion of the Tellico 
Dam by the Tennessee Valley Author-
ity caused large areas of the Eastern 
Band’s ancestral lands along the Little 
Tennessee River to be flooded, com-
pletely submerging the sacred sites and 
archaeological remains of the historic 
Overland Cherokee towns, including 
the Cherokee capitals of the 1700s. 
The Eastern Band can never recover 
these flooded lands and sites. Espe-
cially with that loss in mind, it is im-
portant to recognize that there are 
other locations in the area that require 
protection and preservation, and we 
can do that today. 
H.R. 2088 helps this cause by transfer-
ring approximately 76 acres of histori-
cally significant lands from the TVA to 
the U.S. Government to be held in 
trust for the Eastern Band of Cherokee 
Indians. It also grants two permanent 
easements over TVA property to be 
held in trust for the Tribe to create 
recreational trails between the sites. 
This legislation will give the Eastern 
Band greater control over their his-
toric homelands and the opportunity to 
memorialize the history and culture of 
the Cherokee people. 
I support H.R. 2088, and I urge my 
colleagues to vote in favor of this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 2088, the Eastern Band of Cher-
okee Historic Lands Reacquisition Act, 
as amended.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6052 
November 1, 2021 
I thank Chairman GRIJALVA
and 
Chairwoman 
LEGER
FERNANDEZ
for 
their cooperation on this bill. 
The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indi-
ans is a relatively small Tribe located 
in the Great Smoky Mountains of west-
ern North Carolina. The Tribe’s res-
ervation covers over 50,000 acres in a 
region known as the Qualla Boundary. 
After the completion of the Tellico 
Dam in Loudon County, Tennessee, in 
1979, the Tribe explained to the Ten-
nessee Valley Authority that there 
were areas of historic significance im-
pacted by the dam. 
H.R. 2088 would place Tennessee Val-
ley Authority land and permanent 
easements into trust along the shores 
of the Little Tennessee River and 
Tellico Reservoir in Monroe County, 
Tennessee, for the benefit of the East-
ern Band of Cherokee Indians. 
The parcels to be placed in trust 
under the bill would primarily be used 
for memorializing and interpreting the 
history of the Eastern Band of Cher-
okee Indians. Gaming pursuant to the 
Indian Gaming Regulatory Act would 
be prohibited, and TVA will be able to 
continue carrying out river control and 
development to power the Tennessee 
Valley region. 
Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of 
the measure, and I recognize the gen-
tleman 
from 
Tennessee 
(Mr. 
FLEISCHMANN) for his continued work 
on this important legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I yield such time as 
he may consume to the gentleman 
from Tennessee (Mr. FLEISCHMANN). 
Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Madam Speak-
er, I rise in support of my bill, H.R. 
2088, the Eastern Band of Cherokee His-
toric Lands Reacquisition Act. 
The great State of Tennessee, my 
home State, gets its name from the 
historic Overhill Cherokee village site 
called Tanasi located in present-day 
Monroe 
County, 
Tennessee. 
Tanasi 
served as the capital of the Cherokee 
people from as early as 1721. 
Unfortunately, as a result of mis-
guided Federal policies, the Cherokee 
people were forcibly removed from 
their homes in Tennessee and sur-
rounding States. This tragic period in 
American history led to the Trail of 
Tears, a journey on which the United 
States forcibly marched 15,000 Chero-
kees to the Indian territory. 
My bill, the Eastern Band of Cher-
okee Historic Lands Reacquisition Act, 
returns important historical sites back 
to the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indi-
ans, the Tribal Nation comprised of de-
scendants of those Cherokees who re-
sisted removal in the Great Smoky 
Mountains. 
It is on these same lands where the 
Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians have 
for decades honored the birthplace of 
Sequoyah, whose likeness we have all 
had the opportunity to pass as we 
make our way from the rotunda of our 
Capitol to this House floor. 
H.R. 2088 would return 76.1 acres of 
TVA land back to the Eastern Band of 
Cherokees in trust and grant two per-
manent easements over TVA property 
to be held in trust for the Tribe for cre-
ating recreational trails between the 
sites. 
The Tribe is committed to improving 
the 
educational 
resources 
of 
the 
Sequoyah Birthplace Museum and to 
providing a means for economic devel-
opment 
for 
the 
local 
community 
through cultural tourism. 
The Cherokee Nation has a rich his-
tory in the Third District of Tennessee, 
and I am grateful to be engaged in the 
process to safeguard their story. 
This exact piece of legislation has 
easily passed the House with broad bi-
partisan support for the last two Con-
gresses. I strongly urge Members of the 
United States Senate to understand 
the importance of Cherokee Tribal land 
preservation and to support H.R. 2088 
so that it may be brought to President 
Biden’s desk in an accelerated manner. 
November serves as Indigenous Peo-
ple’s Month, and I encourage all of my 
colleagues in both Chambers to join in 
passing this momentous piece of legis-
lation. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I again thank the gentleman from Ten-
nessee for his work on this legislation. 
I thank the chairman and the chair-
woman for their work on this package 
of bills. 
Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of 
this bill, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
I once again thank Ranking Member 
WESTERMAN
for his support of this 
package of bipartisan bills that we 
have brought to the floor today. 
It is historic that we begin this 
month with this commitment to these 
bills and to getting them passed in a 
bipartisan manner. 
I thank the gentleman from Ten-
nessee (Mr. FLEISCHMANN) for his work 
and for the bipartisan support we have 
today on this floor for cultural preser-
vation of Tribal sites. 
The idea that we are committed to 
safeguard—that is such a beautiful 
word he used—the stories and places of 
sacred importance to Tribes because we 
know that too often they are overrun 
with other interests, that they take 
over, and they lose those sacred sites. 
I am so grateful to all of you for the 
support of this legislation and the 
other pieces of legislation that we have 
brought forward today, which we em-
phasize, and we dedicate ourselves to a 
new era where we are working to pro-
tect sacred sites, where we are making 
sure that the healthcare of Indian 
Tribes is maintained and improved in 
our urban areas. 
It is a very good day on the floor. 
I urge all my colleagues to support 
this bill and all eight bills we have 
brought forward today. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New Mexico 
(Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 2088, as amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Madam Speak-
er, on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

CONGRATULATING THE ASIA PA-
CIFIC CULTURAL CENTER FOR 25 
YEARS OF SERVICE AND DEDI-
CATION 
(Mr. KILMER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. 
KILMER. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
E 
Pluribus Unum, out of many, one. 
Our Nation’s motto reflects the truth 
embodied by the Asia Pacific Cultural 
Center for the last 25 years; that our 
region’s diversity is a blessing; that 
the people in the cultures that have 
come from so many places should be 
celebrated. And, importantly, that the 
celebration of that diversity can be a 
force for uniting us. 
Since 1996, the Asia Pacific Cultural 
Center has served as that unifying 
force in our region, providing programs 
to support and honor the Asian and Pa-
cific Islander people. It has brought us 
together. 
Over the years, so many of us have 
learned from APCC programs. Person-
ally, I have participated in traditional 
ceremonies at Samoan Cultural Days 
and at the Korean Chuseok Festival. I 
have tried and even made all kinds of 
cuisine. I have joined the APCC in 
healing after tragic moments in our 
country. Like others, I have joined 
them in joy and celebration. 
I would like to recognize the organi-
zation’s tremendous leadership, includ-
ing Lua Pritchard and Patsy Surh 
O’Connell and congratulate the APCC 
for 25 years of service and dedication to 
our community. Here is to many more. 
f 
THE BIDEN ECONOMY IS MOVING 
IN THE WRONG DIRECTION 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, the Biden economy is moving 
in the wrong direction, destroying jobs 
and destroying small businesses. 
In the Commerce Department report 
last week, the estimated third quarter 
Gross Domestic Product—the value of 
all goods and services produced in 
America—came in at a low 2 percent, 
lower than the last quarter, with 
Americans making less, below infla-
tion. 
Congressman KEVIN BRADY, the Re-
publican leader of the House Ways and 
Means Committee, has said that there 
is more proof that President Biden is 
bungling the recovery, and now faces 
serious questions about his competency 
to heal our economy. 
Economic growth has already peaked 
for President Biden’s Presidency, and 
now he is nearly a million jobs short of 
his promises. Democrat elite think 
they are smarter than anyone, and 
they think Democrat voters are igno-
rant to believe that $3.5 trillion in 
spending costs zero. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
who successfully protected America for 
20 years as the global war on terrorism 
continues moving from Afghanistan to 
America due to Biden ignoring mili-
tary advice. 
f 
RECOGNIZING KRISTALLNACHT 
COMMEMORATION 
(Ms. SPANBERGER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise 
tonight 
to 
recognize 
the 
Kristallnacht 
Remembrance 
Service 
that has taken place in the community 
I represent for more than 60 years. 
In 1938, during Kristallnacht, the 
night of broken glass, more than 90 
Jews were killed, murdered, and 30,000 
Jewish men were arrested and sent to 
concentration camps. Hundreds of syn-
agogues were burned, and thousands of 
Jewish homes and businesses were ran-
sacked. It was a prelude to the horrors 
to come. 
Every year, central Virginians come 
together 
on 
the 
anniversary 
of 
Kristallnacht at the Emek Sholom Hol-
ocaust Memorial Cemetery in Henrico 
County, a cemetery that serves as the 
final resting place for so many Vir-
ginians with ties to the Holocaust. 
At the service, our community joins 
to remember what took place, honor 
loved ones, and remind us that we can 
never forget. 
I am immensely grateful to the local 
leaders in central Virginia’s Jewish 
community who bring people together 
for this remembrance service. 
This community is committed to 
education and celebrating Jewish cul-
ture, and the Kristallnacht Remem-
brance Service is indicative of that 
spirit and that commitment. 
f 
RECOGNIZING THE YOUNG HARRIS 
COLLEGE MEN’S SOCCER TEAM 
(MR. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to congratulate and cel-
ebrate the accomplishments of the 
Young Harris College men’s soccer 
team. 
As an alumnus of Young Harris Col-
lege, I am honored to recognize the 
hard work and resiliency of the entire 
staff and team. 
On October 20, the team rallied to-
gether to win the 2021 Peach Belt Con-
ference title. Scoring twice in the last 
5 minutes, the Mountain Lions were 
able to secure a 2–1 win over Georgia 
Southwestern State University for the 
title. This victory marks the sixth 
Peach Belt Conference title in program 
history. 
Beyond the soccer field, these stu-
dent athletes are to be commended for 
their academic success and commit-
ment to the Young Harris College Com-
munity. 
I, along with the entire Mountain 
Lion community, will be cheering the 
team on as they continue their season. 
Congratulations to the players, coach-
es, and parents on an incredible season 
and a well-deserved win. 
Go Mountain Lions. 
f 
AMERICAN STEEL AND ALUMINUM 
INDUSTRIES SERVE OUR NATION 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of the Section 232 steel and 
aluminum agreement that President 
Biden’s administration has reached 
with the European Union. 
This agreement is critical as a safe-
guard for national security, to restore 
and improve our transatlantic alli-
ances, and bolster the American steel 
and aluminum industries that serve as 
the backbone of this country. 
Establishing a level playing field 
through robust enforcement mecha-
nisms will ensure that American com-
panies are able to compete in the mar-
ketplace, not forced to contend with 
the 
cheaper 
and 
shoddier 
metals 
dumped around the globe by China and 
others. 
President Biden is delivering for do-
mestic manufacturers and our union 
brothers and sisters who build up 
America. Together, we will continue 
our work to create the good-paying 
middle class jobs our families deserve. 
Let us rebuild our communities with 
the innovation and ingenuity that only 
American industries can produce. 
f 
RECOGNIZING DAVE WILLIAMS AS 
THE VOICE OF AGRICULTURE 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
the voice of agriculture in Pennsyl-
vania and beyond, Mr. Dave Williams. 
Dave has been a key voice in agri-
culture for more than 20 years. A farm-
er himself, Mr. Williams never ex-
pected to air on nearly 30 radio sta-
tions, three networks, and weekly 
PCN-TV. 
His first show aired on WDNH-AM 
1590 in 1998. He believed it was impor-
tant to involve the consumers who buy 
and eat the foods so that they could 
have a better understanding. He was 
right. From there he went on to inter-
view State and Federal legislators,

Governors, State agriculture officials, 
and of course, a lot of farm family sto-
ries. 
In January of this year, David was 
the recipient of the Gerald W. Reichard 
Impact Award, given annually to some-
one who has had a significant overall 
impact on the Pennsylvania Farm 
Show. 
Dave continues to use his platform 
for agriculture advocacy, highlighting 
the important work of farmers and 
ranchers in Pennsylvania and across 
the country. 
Thank you, Dave, for your important 
work, and thank you for being a voice 
of agriculture. 
f 
HONORING THE FREEDOM RIDERS 
(Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise in recognition of the anniver-
sary of this important day in American 
history, November 1, 1965. On that day, 
the Interstate Commerce Commission 
ruled that segregation on interstate 
buses and facilities was illegal. This 
ruling came after months of protests 
and arrests of the Freedom Riders on 
public transit. 
The Freedom Riders, made up of 
Black and White, male and female, 
young and old, united to show the Na-
tion that we are all equal. I had the 
honor of serving in Congress alongside 
one of the original Freedom Riders, my 
good friend and our colleague, the late 
Congressman John Lewis. 
To honor his legacy and commitment 
to ending racial segregation, I reintro-
duced H.R. 1348, to award a Congres-
sional Gold Medal to the Freedom Rid-
ers in recognition of their unique con-
tribution to civil rights. 
I strongly encourage my congres-
sional colleagues to cosponsor H.R. 
1348. This year marks the 65th anniver-
sary of the Freedom Riders, and it is 
past time that we recognize their cour-
age and contributions. 
f 
80,000 NEW IRS AGENTS 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, over 
the weekend I attended a University of 
Wisconsin 
football 
game, 
and 
for 
awhile I sat high in the second deck 
overlooking the campus and the beau-
tiful Lake Mendota. 
As I stood there looking at over 80,000 
people, I wondered what was going on 
in different people’s minds. Some peo-
ple were looking at beautiful Lake 
Mendota. Some people were looking at 
the beautiful college buildings: Vilas 
Hall and Van Vleck Hall. Other people 
were looking down on the football 
game. 
As I looked at the 80,000 people, I re-
alized that some people looking at 
80,000 people said: Wouldn’t it be great 
if we hired all 80,000 people to be new 
IRS agents? 
Please, don’t let this country become 
East Germany. Vote ‘‘no.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I hope we all vote ‘‘no’’ 
on the reconciliation bill. 
f 
$450,000 PER PERSON TO ILLEGAL 
IMMIGRANTS 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, today I 
rise in actually complete outrage at 
the unbelievable consideration that the 
Biden administration is putting for-
ward of—get this—awarding $450,000 per 
person to illegal immigrants that have 
broken our laws in this country. 
$450,000. How is it even rational that 
someone who took an illegal action in 
order to get to our soil, how can that 
lead to an outcome where the perpe-
trator would receive a $450,000 payday? 
There are American citizens whose 
families don’t even make half a million 
dollars in 10 years. The President 
doesn’t even make $450,000 a year. 
We have already seen that illegal im-
migrants use children basically as 
shields—not even their own children— 
to avoid deportation in order to come 
across the border. 
Democrats in Congress are trying 
their best to give illegal immigrants 
citizenship, and the White House wants 
to give them a very large check. 
When I see proposals like this, I have 
to ask: Whose side are they on? It cer-
tainly doesn’t look like this adminis-
tration is on the side of the hard-
working American citizens who are 
trying to make ends meet, put their 
kids through school, pay their bills, 
when they hand out $450,000 checks to 
people who came here illegally.

b 1945 
CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
KAHELE). Under the Speaker’s an-
nounced policy of January 4, 2021, the 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE) is recognized for 60 minutes as the 
designee of the majority leader. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
wish a good evening to all of my col-
leagues and certainly members of the 
Congressional Black Caucus. It is my 
privilege to be part of the Special 
Order series of the Congressional Black 
Caucus as a coanchor with Congress-
man TORRES from New York, and we 
thank him for his leadership. We 
thank, in particular, the chair of the 
Congressional Black Caucus, JOYCE 
BEATTY, who has been an enormous 
leader on any number of issues that are 
crucial to the American people and to 
African Americans. 
The one thing I say about the Con-
gressional Black Caucus representing 
millions and millions of Americans is 
that we represent a diverse population 
of Americans. I am very proud to, as 
well, represent those African-American 
descendants of freed slaves. 
In fact, we rise today to emphasize 
the cruciality of the Build Back Better 
Act for moving the Nation forward and 
particularly 
moving 
forward 
those 
whom the Congressional Black Caucus 
represents. So I am very pleased this 
evening to be joined by my outstanding 
colleagues, who will include Congress-
woman ADAMS
from North Carolina, 
Congresswoman BONNIE WATSON COLE-
MAN
from New Jersey, Congressman 
DWIGHT EVANS from Pennsylvania, and 
Congressman STEVE
HORSFORD
from 
Nevada. There are others, such as Con-
gresswoman GWEN
MOORE
from the 
great State of Wisconsin. Other Mem-
bers may come. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and include 
any extraneous material on the subject 
of this Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let 
me be very clear and refute a state-
ment that I just recently heard on the 
floor. Nothing is ignorant in the Build 
Back Better bill and/or the bipartisan 
infrastructure bill. In fact, ignorance is 
stamped out by these bills. One, they 
are fully paid for as we are working the 
final edges of that, and, number two, 
they are doing things that are long 
overdue for America. 
Who are we as President Biden stands 
at the G20 and now at the climate 
change conference? Who are we? We are 
leaders of the free world. In fact, we 
are the leader. 
Although there are debates on the 
status of Russia and the competitive 
nature of China, all that has a basis in 
facts. But at the same time, as these 
facts are present, the United States 
continues to grow and to move and to 
ensure opportunity for its citizens. It is 
not our creed to randomly snatch peo-
ple off the street and lock them up. It 
is not our focus to ensure that voices 
are not heard or that people of dif-
ferent religions are treated differently, 
arrested, isolated, and brutalized even. 
It is not our basic creed to enact laws 
that would help us take very important 
proprietary information from others. 
We are a democracy, and we are aided 
by the laws of that principle. So I take 
no back seat to whether or not Russia 
and China are competitive or are pro-
posed world powers. What I say is that 
the United States has all the elements 
of continuing her posture of leadership, 
and one of those elements will be the 
successful passage of the Build Back 
Better Act and BIF, the bipartisanship 
infrastructure bill. This is the kind of 
legislation 
that 
is 
not 
seen 
even 
amongst our European friends of late 
nor of China or Russia. 
We are standing on the precipice of 
history, and I am very grateful for the

November 1, 2021 
leadership of the Congressional Black 
Caucus that has been at the forefront 
of these matters. Again, working with 
so many of our colleagues, we lead as 
full committee chairs having input 
into this bill. 
Let me very quickly indicate that we 
are strongly supporting the $1.75 bil-
lion Build Back Better Act conceived 
and advanced by the President and 
House Democrats. We are grateful that 
we have had moments of negotiations 
with our other caucuses. Those cau-
cuses are likewise ensuring that the t’s 
are crossed and the i’s are dotted. 
Mr. Speaker, what is wrong with 
that? When we finally bring a bill, we 
want to make sure that it is vetted, 
and that is what so many of our mem-
bers of the CBC were able to do, to be 
part of the vetting. 
It is also important in 2021, this 21st 
century, that we go big. It is often said 
that the Federal budget is an expres-
sion of the Nation’s values and that the 
investments made to build back better 
are, in fact, a clear declaration of con-
gressional Democrats, of the Congres-
sional Black Caucus, to ensuring that 
our government, our economy, and our 
systems work for the people. 
We have always been the voice of the 
vulnerable. We have always been the 
conscience of the Congress. So these 
are long-overdue investments. 
The Build Back Better Act makes 
transformative investments, as our 
chairwoman has often said. We need to 
continue growing our economy and 
lower costs for working families. This 
$1.75 trillion—which, by the way, I re-
fute the statement of ignorance be-
cause the statement was ignorant be-
cause they were speaking of $3.5 tril-
lion, which was paid for, but we have 
come to a conclusion and a com-
promise of $1.75 trillion. 
Are the American people worth this? 
Are 
vulnerable 
communities 
worth 
this? Are children who suffer from lead 
pipes and water from those pipes worth 
it? 
The Congressional Black Caucus feels 
it is the case. That is why we have sup-
ported the improvement in education, 
healthcare, and childcare. Childcare, in 
particular, will particularly help those 
of our community who have for too 
long either gone without childcare and 
suffered or paid more than half of their 
income. 
Childcare is an important element of 
our work, and so I have the Ginger-
bread Childcare Center husband and 
wife who made the sacrifice to help 
vulnerable parents have childcare, par-
ents who had to leave in the middle of 
the night, people who worked at night, 
essential workers, parents who worked 
for a period of time and, of course, did 
not have the kind of childcare that the 
Gingerbread—a wonderful daycare—al-
lowed us to have. 
We hope that these resources will 
help these kinds of entities in our com-
munity: $40 billion in education to spe-
cifically improve Pell grants and, as 
well, to work with historically Black 
colleges. I know we will hear that from 
my colleague, but it is extremely im-
portant that we have never left our 
HBCUs. They have been at the fore-
front of funding since President Biden 
has come into office. Through the 
years of the Congressional Black Cau-
cus, and the voices of our members 
joined with our chairwoman of the 
HBCU Caucus, Congresswoman ADAMS, 
we have them included again in this 
legislation. 
I will be discussing as we go forward 
healthcare, which is extremely impor-
tant. We are excited about getting aid 
to those in the 12 States, including 
Texas, South Carolina, and North Caro-
lina, among others, that did not opt in 
to the Affordable Care Act-expanded 
Medicaid. We left so many families 
along the highway of despair. Thank 
goodness we found a way to bring them 
now under the Affordable Care Act, to 
give them subsidies. 
Help is on the way, Houston. Help is 
on the way, Texas, with the highest 
number of uninsured, 766,000. Now, with 
Build Back Better, we will have a path-
way for them to get healthcare. I can 
hear the noise of shouting now down in 
Houston, Texas, and I can hear the 
noise of helping families with children 
have healthcare, which they did not. 
We will talk about that more exten-
sively and, as well, childcare, as I have 
mentioned, to be able to ensure not 
only childcare with only 7 percent of 
your income but, again, universal and 
free preschool for all 3- and 4-year-olds. 
That is something to say to China, 
Russia, and others, that America rec-
ognizes what its priority is, and it is 
our children. 
You will hear, Mr. Speaker, just a 
long litany of how lives will be helped, 
how we will rebuild families, home 
care, giving dignity to those essential 
workers, taking care of people in the 
latter part of their lives, ensuring dig-
nity and income but also ensuring the 
opportunity for these individuals to be 
able to be cared for at home. 
I will be discussing further the af-
fordable housing that is very impor-
tant. Then, of course, is a major ele-
ment of all of this, as the President 
stands in front of the tens upon tens of 
countries, leading on climate change, 
for which we gave him a standing ova-
tion when he left for his European 
meetings. 
Mr. Speaker, you will hear more 
about this as we go forward this 
evening. I am delighted that the Con-
gressional Black Caucus played such an 
instrumental role in dealing with the 
Federal Medicaid problem and solving 
childcare, HBCUs, climate change, and 
dealing with maternal issues for Afri-
can-American women and many others. 
Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to yield 
to the gentlewoman from North Caro-
lina (Ms. ADAMS). 
Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank the gentlewoman from Texas for 
her stellar leadership, for coanchoring 
tonight, and for all the support that 
she has continued to give, and the lead-
ership of the CBC. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to 
speak about the importance of passing 
the Build Back Better Act, legislation 
nothing short of transformational for 
Black America. 
It extends the child care tax credit 
for a year, cutting child poverty in 
half. In North Carolina, that is a life-
line for hundreds of thousands of chil-
dren who go to bed hungry every night. 
It puts $150 billion toward affordable 
housing, which has been described as 
the single largest and most comprehen-
sive investment in affordable housing 
in history. In Charlotte and so many 
other communities across the country, 
that is real progress on our affordable 
housing crisis and real relief for over 
half a million Americans who don’t 
have a roof over their heads. 
As the chair of the CBC HBCU Cau-
cus and cofounder of the Congressional 
Bipartisan HBCU Caucus, I am proud 
to say that this package provides ap-
proximately $10 billion specifically for 
historically Black colleges and univer-
sities and other minority-serving insti-
tutions, including $3 billion for re-
search and development grants at these 
institutions and $6 billion for increased 
Pell grants and institutional support 
to lower the cost of college. 
Universal childcare and pre-K will 
prepare children to receive the edu-
cation that they need to succeed in 
school and be admitted to college. 
As the cofounder and co-chair of the 
Black Maternal Health Caucus with 
Representative UNDERWOOD, I am also 
proud to say that the Build Back Bet-
ter Act includes all eligible provisions 
of our Momnibus legislation and per-
manently 
expands 
yearlong 
postpartum Medicaid and CHIP cov-
erage in every State. 
The maternal health and morbidity 
crisis in this country is unacceptable, 
but the Build Back Better Act gets us 
closer to the day when every parent 
who enters the maternity ward and 
every child born in America makes it 
home safe. 
Finally, I would like to take a point 
of personal privilege to recognize the 
hard work of our Congressional Black 
Caucus chair, JOYCE BEATTY, and all 
the members and committee chairs on 
this legislation. 
I believe that promises made must be 
promised kept, and this package keeps 
our promise to all Americans. I implore 
my colleagues to pass the Build Back 
Better Act and the bipartisan infra-
structure framework together. This is 
Our Power, Our Message. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman from North 
Carolina for her words. Again, I empha-
size her commitment, dedication, and 
work on historically Black colleges, 
and she is absolutely right: $10 billion. 
But more importantly, that is layered 
upon the dollars out of the American 
Rescue Act, out of the CARES Act, and 
the debt under President Joe Biden 
that has been effectively worked on in 
this congressional session. We know

that we are doing better by our stu-
dents because we have done better by 
them as it relates to education. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from New Jersey (Mrs. WATSON 
COLEMAN), 
who 
chairs 
the 
Sub-
committee on Transportation and Mar-
itime Security of the Committee on 
Homeland Security and has been com-
mitted to improving the lives of young 
African-American 
women 
and, 
of 
course, those dealing with mental 
health issues as well. 
b 2000 
Mrs. 
WATSON 
COLEMAN. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman 
from Texas for spearheading this Spe-
cial Order hour and for giving me an 
opportunity to share a few of my re-
marks. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today optimistic, 
optimistic that our country is on the 
verge of taking a historic step forward 
for all of our communities. The Build 
Back Better Act is a once-in-a-genera-
tion investment in our country as a 
whole and in Black Americans, specifi-
cally. For too long, our country’s insti-
tutions have been apathetic and even 
adversarial toward Black people. Four 
hundred years of slavery, Jim Crow, 
mass incarceration, and other forms of 
systemic violence have trapped Black 
Americans in a vicious cycle from 
which it can be nearly impossible to 
break. 
The Build Back Better Act will not 
instantly remedy four centuries of that 
pain and hardship, but it is a crucial 
starting point. Through revitalizing in-
frastructure and funding essential so-
cial services, the President’s agenda 
will set the next generation of Black 
Americans up for success. 
Building back better means directly 
confronting the Black mental health 
crisis. This bill would fund universal 
childcare and pre-K, allowing Black 
mothers to return to the workforce 
while giving Black children the early 
childhood care that they need. 
Building back better means giving 
those same Black children safe places 
to grow up, to learn, and to thrive. We 
will do that by making the single-larg-
est housing investment in our Nation’s 
history. 
Building back better means ensuring 
those very same children have long, 
successful lives. That is why the bill 
invests billions of dollars into histori-
cally Black colleges and universities. 
This is new money on top of our annual 
funding of HBCUs. 
Many of us in this Chamber today, 
myself included, wanted more out of 
the Build Back Better Act. No, this bill 
is not perfect, and much more work 
will remain to be done after its pas-
sage. This does not change the fact, 
however, that the Build Back Better 
Act represents monumental progress 
for our country; progress for everyday 
Americans; progress for elder Ameri-
cans; progress for children in America; 
progress for working Americans; and, 
yes, progress for African Americans 
and other minorities. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my wonder-
ful colleagues to support the Build 
Back Better Act. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman very much for 
recognizing that this will be trans-
formative, but as well, that it will do 
and improve in areas that we have not 
done in the history of the United 
States of America. 
Mr. Speaker, I am now delighted to 
yield to the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania (Mr. EVANS), from Philadelphia, 
who has been instrumental in dealing 
with issues of taxation and the em-
powerment of small businesses. 
Mr. EVANS. Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to first thank my colleague from 
the great State of Texas for yielding. 
Since I have been here, I have watched 
her relentless passion for Black people, 
and she has not let anybody stand in 
the way, and I am proud to stand with 
her and also the chair of the Congres-
sional 
Black 
Caucus, 
Chairwoman 
BEATTY. She, too, has led this Caucus, 
and I am honored to be here just to add 
my 
voice 
to 
this 
discussion 
this 
evening. 
President Biden’s Build Back Better 
framework would bring down costs 
that have held back families in Penn-
sylvania for decades. It would do this 
by cutting taxes and making childcare, 
home care, education, healthcare, and 
housing more affordable. 
Let me repeat that, Mr. Speaker. 
President Biden’s Build Back Better 
framework would bring down the costs 
that have held back families in Penn-
sylvania for decades. It would do this 
by cutting taxes and making childcare, 
home care, education, healthcare, and 
housing more affordable. These invest-
ments will provide new learning oppor-
tunities for children, help parents—and 
especially working parents—make ends 
meet, and it positions the economy for 
a stronger growth for years to come. 
As the Congresswoman said from the 
great State of Texas: This is trans-
formational. And that is why I am 
happy to be a part of this discussion. 
The framework will create good-paying 
jobs for Pennsylvanians, combat cli-
mate change, give our kids cleaner air 
and water, and make America the lead-
er in global innovation and 21st cen-
tury manufacturing, which means jobs 
and opportunities, which means a sense 
of hope and optimism. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a moment for all 
of us and we must not sit back. And the 
Congressional Black Caucus, by what is 
taking place here, is demonstrating 
that it is there. As the late John Lewis 
used to say: If you see something, do 
something. 
And 
the 
Congressional 
Black Caucus is following that lead. 
We all recognize, as the late John 
Lewis used to say: If you think things 
haven’t changed, just walk in my 
shoes. 
I want to focus tonight on childcare, 
which is so vital to our families and 
putting our economy back on track. It 
is a major reason why many Americans 
have not been able to go back to work. 
In Pennsylvania, the average yearly 
cost of childcare centers for a toddler 
is over $11,000. That means a Pennsyl-
vania family with two young children, 
on average, spends 22 percent of their 
income on childcare for 1 year. 
The lack of affordable options also 
contributes to the 15 percent gender 
gap in workforce participation between 
mothers and fathers; 15 percent. That 
is outrageous. That should not be ac-
cepted. 
The Build Back Better framework is 
the way to go. President Biden has 
shown the kind of leadership and vision 
that is necessary. That is why the Con-
gressional Black Caucus stands so 
proudly to join this effort with the rest 
of our colleagues who are ready to lead. 
This is just that kind of moment. We 
want to be at the right place at the 
right time. The building back frame-
work would enable Pennsylvanians to 
provide access to childcare for more 
than 737,000 young children ages 0 to 5 
per year from families earning under 
2.5 times the State median income. I 
want to repeat that. The building back 
framework would enable Pennsylvania 
to provide access to childcare for more 
than 700,000 young children ages 0 to 5 
per year from families earning under 
2.5 times the median income, and it 
would ensure these families would pay 
no more than 7 percent of their income 
on high-quality childcare. 
This is something that is extremely 
important. This is something, when the 
President talks about building back 
better, it puts us all in the right posi-
tion. It is something that needs to hap-
pen. It is something that is long over-
due. We in the Congressional Black 
Caucus are prepared to join with the 
President and to send a message that 
building back better is in the interest 
of America. 
The President realizes that. He un-
derstood a long time ago about the 
needs that we have. So I compliment 
him in joining with our chairperson 
and joining with our colleague from 
the great State of Texas and their lead-
ership, and all of us joining with him 
tonight to show that we are prepared 
to help lead this battle; that no one 
can do it by themselves, but we need to 
be prepared. 
We made a promise to build back bet-
ter after the pandemic and this frame-
work would do just that. Mr. Speaker, 
this is an opportunity for all of us. This 
is an opportunity for us to stand tall, 
to raise the issue about building back 
better. We all recognize this. This en-
tire package, Build Back Better and 
the infrastructure package together, 
will make a huge difference in our 
economy. 
It is something that we all have 
worked on and we all understand the 
importance of it. So I share with you 
as one member of this Caucus, proudly 
of the Congressional Black Caucus, 
proudly of Pennsylvania, proudly a cit-
izen of the United States, that I am 
ready for this. And I thank my col-
league SHEILA
JACKSON
LEE
for her 
leadership and all that she has done.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6059 
November 1, 2021 
As I have watched her, even though 
she hasn’t noticed it, she has been in 
the forefront. She hasn’t missed a 
fight, and I am glad to be a part of 
every effort. 
So with the Congressional Black Cau-
cus I stand proudly on the President’s 
Building Back Better framework, and I 
am ready to vote for it. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania for recognizing that a vital part 
of the lives of families is childcare. 
As a member of the Ways and Means 
Committee, I know that he was ex-
tremely engaged in this very vital as-
pect of the President’s Build Back Bet-
ter, and, again, we thank the wisdom of 
the President of the United States, 
President Biden and Vice President 
HARRIS, for their wisdom about helping 
American families. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Nevada (Mr. HORSFORD), the first 
vice-chair of the Congressional Black 
Caucus and someone who worked ex-
tensively on work training issues, ex-
tensively on healthcare, and of course, 
on issues like childcare, as well. 
Mr. HORSFORD. Mr. Speaker, I want 
to thank my coanchor, my distin-
guished 
colleague 
Congresswoman 
SHEILA JACKSON LEE for her tremen-
dous leadership and for anchoring this 
Special Order hour, and, of course, our 
chairwoman, JOYCE
BEATTY, for her 
tremendous leadership in leading the 
Congressional Black Caucus, which 
represents more than 17 million Black 
constituents across this great country. 
We represent not only Black Ameri-
cans, but all Americans, diverse Ameri-
cans. And what those Americans have 
been telling me in my district back 
home in Nevada’s Fourth District, it is 
time for us to build back better and to 
do it in a more equitable and inclusive 
way. 
Tonight, we are here to bring atten-
tion to the fact that we are standing at 
a crossroads of history. With the bipar-
tisan infrastructure deal and the Build 
Back Better Act, Congress has the op-
portunity to finally rebuild our econ-
omy to deliver huge tax cuts to the 
middle class and to lower the cost of 
living for families on everything from 
childcare to healthcare. 
The question is: Will our colleagues 
on the other side of the aisle work with 
us to deliver these important invest-
ments on behalf of the American peo-
ple? Now, we have seen transformative 
legislation like this before when Con-
gress worked to rebuild the American 
society in the wake of the Great De-
pression, but never, and I mean never, 
have people of color benefited like they 
could under the Build Back Better Act. 
I think it is our majority whip, JIM 
CLYBURN, who has talked about the his-
tory of these other measures and how 
they actually left entire communities 
out. They left women out. They left 
communities of color out, and we are 
still dealing with the systemic issues of 
being left out of those policies for far 
too long. 
So I want to again thank our leader-
ship because it wasn’t just this bill and 
the drafting of this bill and, yes, Presi-
dent Biden wrote this bill, he wrote it 
with the support of his team at the 
White House, but with a whole lot of 
good input from colleagues over here in 
the Capitol, including here in the Con-
gressional Black Caucus. 
b 2015 
I know that there are colleagues of 
mine who have been working on key 
elements of this bill for a very long 
time. I know that they, like myself, 
are ready to act on behalf of the Amer-
ican people. 
So I look forward to having a little 
bit of a colloquy with my colleague 
from Wisconsin. I believe that it is so 
important, Mr. Speaker, that we talk 
about what is in this bill. For far too 
long, people have been focused about a 
top-line number, about the process, 
about the personalities here on Capitol 
Hill and whether certain factions are 
with the bill or working on the bill. 
With all due respect, I want to talk 
about policy and the policy that affects 
people, the people in my district, in Ne-
vada’s Fourth District, and the people 
all across this country. 
Why? Because the Build Back Better 
Act will cut childcare costs. For fami-
lies that are eligible under this bill, 
they won’t pay more than 7 percent of 
their 
household 
income 
to 
cover 
childcare, something that women and 
communities of color desperately need 
as we talk about the workforce short-
age and the inequities that are in our 
workforce. 
What sense does it make when some-
one who has to work—I will give you 
an example—Ms. Rosetta, who is a con-
stituent of mine, is a home care work-
er. I had a roundtable with her and 
some other home care workers. She 
shared with me that when she started 
her job several years ago, she got paid 
$9.50 an hour. Today, she makes just 
over $10 an hour. Think about that. 
For several years, this woman, who is 
a home care worker, who goes into el-
derly citizens’ homes to take care of 
them, to make sure that they are fed, 
that they are bathed, that literally she 
changes their diapers, she is their com-
panion, she hasn’t been given a raise of 
more than 50 cents over the course of 
several years. That is unconscionable. 
Under the Build Back Better Act, we 
are actually investing in home care 
workers, not only to help make that 
profession what it should be, an honor-
able one that pays them what they are 
worth, but also equips them with the 
support that they need for their own 
families. Why is it okay for them to 
take care of other people’s families and 
then not even have the resources and 
the means to take care of their own? 
It also gives every child a head start 
with universal pre-K for 3- and 4-year- 
olds. Mr. Speaker, we have talked a lot 
about how we help young people get 
the start they need in life, and we 
know that by investing in their early 
success, it improves academic skill at-
tainment, allowing them to read at an 
early age. Reading is essential to every 
other subject that they have to learn. 
It will ensure that they improve their 
graduation rates, which improves their 
life chances of success. 
To my colleagues on the other side, 
when you say that we are spending too 
much in this package, are we spending 
too much for that home care worker, 
for Rosetta, and so many other people 
like her? Are we spending too much to 
give working families the support they 
need to be able to afford childcare? Are 
we spending too much so that every 
child in our country has a good start 
through 
universal 
prekindergarten? 
These are but just a few of the benefits. 
Now, before I go on and I yield to my 
colleague here, I want to talk about 
one other important element. We have 
spent a lot of time on the Build Back 
Better Act, but I am also for the bipar-
tisan infrastructure deal. Why? Yes, it 
is going to create millions of good-pay-
ing, union jobs. Yeah, I have no prob-
lem saying ‘‘union’’ here in this body, 
because it is the unions that helped 
build the middle class. If we are going 
to build this country back better, we 
need to do it with unions at the center 
of it. 
Not only does it do that, it expands 
broadband access, providing broadband 
connectivity in our households in rural 
communities and in urban areas. 
My 
district 
covers 
52,000 
square 
miles. I have parts of Las Vegas and 
North Las Vegas that need broadband, 
but I have six rural communities 
throughout Nevada, many of them that 
do not have adequate broadband. In 
fact, it is a broadband desert through-
out certain parts of my rural commu-
nities. They need the investment. 
It also makes the largest Federal in-
vestment in public transit in history. 
Mr. Speaker, maybe more Members of 
Congress should have to ride the bus, 
and they would understand the invest-
ments that are in this bipartisan infra-
structure bill. 
Yet, the minority leader on the other 
side is literally trying to whip votes 
against this bipartisan infrastructure 
bill, a bill that 19 Senate Republicans 
voted for, along with every Democrat. 
Now, it is our turn to vote for it, and 
they won’t work with us to deliver the 
largest investment in public transit in 
history? 
You have constituents that rely on 
public transit. That is the only way 
some veterans can get to their doctors’ 
appointments. Seniors, college stu-
dents, working people. This has direct 
implications on the climate crisis as 
well. When people have to stand out-
side for hours in order to catch a bus, 
that affects their exposure to every-
thing from heat to snow in Wisconsin. 
We don’t have that in Vegas. 
Finally, it will remove lead from the 
water our children and other vulner-
able populations drink. These are just 
three of the very important provisions 
that are in the bipartisan infrastruc-
ture deal.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6060 
November 1, 2021 
I am ready to vote for these bills, Mr. 
Speaker. I wish we could schedule the 
vote tomorrow, because these are in-
vestments that people in Nevada’s 
Fourth District are depending on. They 
sent me to Congress to solve problems 
and to make their lives better. These 
two bills do that, and they do it in very 
significant and meaningful ways. In 
fact, it is probably the largest invest-
ment in people in a generation, and we 
have a chance to do it. It is the Con-
gressional Black Caucus, among oth-
ers, that are leading. 
I want to yield to my colleague, Con-
gresswoman MOORE. Let me ask you, 
because I know as a member of the 
Ways and Means Committee, you have 
been a champion on the racial equity. 
You have been a champion for the poor, 
particularly women, women of color, 
who have been disproportionately af-
fected by this pandemic and its reces-
sion on our economy. So what is it in 
this bill that makes you so excited to 
vote for it, and how will other commu-
nities benefit, beyond just some of the 
things that I have touched on? 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from Wisconsin (Ms. MOORE). 
Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank the gentleman so very, very 
much for that question. It really has 
been a joy working with him on the 
Ways and Means Committee. It has 
been an education, and it has also been 
an opportunity to do those things that 
he has indicated that are close to my 
heart, and that is to create some equi-
ties for women and children. 
I want to just thank Representative 
SHEILA JACKSON LEE for anchoring this 
extremely important conversation with 
the American people today. 
One of the things that has been dis-
turbing me about this entire debate is 
that people seem to really want to 
make some sort of bright-line demarca-
tion or differentiation between the bi-
partisan infrastructure bill—which will 
create economic opportunities, get rid 
of those darned lead pipes, expand 
broadband, create good union jobs, help 
create some great jobs for guys—and 
the Build Back Better initiative, as if 
that is some sort of welfare, a give-
away. Social spending is what it is re-
ferred to, a safety net. 
So what I wanted to seek from you, a 
clarification from you, Mr. HORSFORD, 
particularly since you were appointed 
by the Committee on Ways and Means, 
along with our colleagues, Representa-
tives SEWELL and GOMEZ, to look at our 
racial equity issue. Of course, we know 
that African Americans and Latinos 
are more likely to be poor, have a 
greater wealth gap, and lack of edu-
cational opportunities, so that when 
we think that we are investing in their 
improvement, that somehow it is wel-
fare. 
But I would sort of want you to take 
up the argument where you left it with 
regard to some of the economic prob-
lems that we are experiencing. There 
are major complaints in our country 
about a slowdown in economic growth. 
What good is it to just grow the econ-
omy when only the people at the top 
get it and it doesn’t, excuse me, trickle 
down to Rosetta, who is making $10.25 
an hour doing the hardest work on 
earth there is? 
How does the earned income tax cred-
it—I mean, we were taxing, before we 
changed this policy, to allow single, 
hardworking, essential workers that 
brought us food during the pandemic, 
stocked the shelves, we were taxing 
them into poverty. They had tax liabil-
ity before the earned income tax credit 
expansion. 
Going to work with no healthcare, no 
health insurance, being unable to af-
ford it, not having childcare, as you 
mentioned. Expanded Pell grants. 
Please explain how the Build Back 
Better plan really improves and buoys 
the economic platform upon which the 
country can improve. The workforce 
development initiatives that are in 
here, I was wondering if you could elu-
cidate the connection between that and 
our economy and sort of diffuse this 
notion that it is simply a safety net 
and welfare. 
Mr. HORSFORD. Mr. Speaker, my 
colleague from Wisconsin makes a very 
valid point. 
I heard you over the weekend on one 
of the news outlets making the same 
point. Both of these bills are economic 
packages. I really resent, in fact, some 
of the inferences that have been made 
during this debate that somehow pro-
viding economic support for people to 
benefit and to fully participate in our 
economy is somehow an entitlement 
program. 
The child tax credit, for example. 
You talked about the earned income 
tax credit. I will talk about the child 
tax credit. This is a tax program. It is 
not an entitlement program. Just like 
we give tax cuts to the very wealthy 
and the big corporations—that is what 
the Republicans did when they were in 
the majority. They spent the majority 
of their time trying to figure out how 
to provide 83 percent of the benefits to 
the top 1 percent and a tax cut that 
some of the businesses did not even ask 
for, as much as they got. 
Now, Democrats are in charge, and 
what have we done? We started with 
the American Rescue Plan. In that, we 
provided a tax cut for middle-class 
families, the child tax credit, which ac-
tually has already lifted about 50 per-
cent of children out of poverty, higher 
rates for Black, Latino, and Native 
American children out of poverty. 
Now, there was a debate a couple of 
weeks ago that we now need to put a 
work requirement, means test, and we 
need to change the threshold to make 
people with lower incomes eligible and 
those with higher incomes—like $90,000 
is enough to not receive a tax credit. I 
am glad that President Biden rejected 
those ideas. But it was the Congres-
sional Black Caucus that stood up and 
said no, because this is an economic 
package, and we need provide economic 
supports to families. 
The other part that you so ably noted 
is what are some of the barriers that 
women face in the workforce. You 
talked about this in our committee: 
childcare, healthcare, transportation. 
These are the basics that people need, 
particularly women. Who was the hard-
est hit during this pandemic and reces-
sion? Women, particularly women of 
color, Black women, Latinas, and Na-
tive American women. So if we are 
going to build back better, we need to 
do it in a way that is intentional in a 
way of helping them and making sure 
that they’re supported. 
b 2030 
I just want to share one story. 
Keeonn, who is a constituent of mine, 
is a young father in my district. He 
wrote to me about how he is using that 
child tax credit, which is a tax cut, and 
the advance payment that we provided, 
that $300 a month. You know what he 
is using that money for? To buy 
healthy food for his daughter. 
Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Excellent. 
Mr. HORSFORD. And he said it may 
be only $300, but in the end, it is help 
that we are most grateful for. That is 
what this is about. 
When the Republicans gave the tax 
cut to the very wealthy, some of those 
corporations 
just 
went 
back 
and 
bought more stocks for themselves, 
made themselves wealthier, gave their 
CEOs bigger bonuses, didn’t pay their 
workers more in wages, didn’t expand 
healthcare, didn’t provide childcare, 
didn’t make their workers feel valued. 
And now because of that, many work-
ers today are having a hard time. 
But yet Democrats, through the Con-
gressional Black Caucus, are standing 
up, and we are pushing back, and that 
is what the Build Back Better Act and 
the bipartisan infrastructure bill is all 
about. I yield. 
Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. It is going 
to be great. Madam anchor, I don’t 
know how much time we have, but I 
just want to say, I want to join Mr. 
HORSFORD in saying that I am really 
enthusiastic about voting for both of 
these bills, because I do think that it is 
going to create a brand-new environ-
ment for all of us where we will have 
workforce development training for 
these new technologies on climate and 
battery storage. 
I am so proud of the African Ameri-
cans who have been chairs of these 
committees, like BOBBY
SCOTT
and 
EDDIE
BERNICE
JOHNSON, 
MAXINE 
WATERS
who put $150 billion in for 
housing. As was indicated, these things 
are going to enable workers to truly 
participate in the economy. It is going 
to help companies, and we are going to 
build back better. 
I yield back to the gentlewoman from 
Texas. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, 
first of all, let me thank both Mr. 
HORSFORD and Ms. MOORE for one of the 
important colloquies that I have heard 
on the floor of this body, and that is to 
be able to speak to people who are

working hard every day, who are single 
parents, who work with their minds 
and their hands. 
I am glad to hear that we did not 
limit who would be able to receive 
these benefits, and we also crafted the 
vitality and the vigorous efforts of the 
Congressional Black Caucus. 
As I close, Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to just reiterate what Members, includ-
ing the leadership of our chair, Chair-
woman JOYCE BEATTY, Congresswoman 
ADAMS, Congresswoman WATSON COLE-
MAN, Congressman EVANS, obviously 
Mr. HORSFORD and Ms. MOORE, what 
they all have said, if I might. And that 
is, let me reiterate that each piece of 
Build Back Better is a piece that is 
vital for the lives of Americans and Af-
rican Americans. 
For example, $550 more in Pell grants 
for more than 5 million students. Then 
HBCUs, again, $10 billion. Seniors who 
have never had hearing aids, only 30 
percent of seniors over the age of 70 
who could benefit from hearing aids 
have ever had them. Medicare in this 
Build Back Better will include that 
extra benefit. Many of us have seen the 
caricatures of our seniors on television 
and elsewhere trying to hear. That is 
not anything that is funny, but it has 
been made light of. I want to give 
every senior an opportunity to hear. 
At the same time, I want to empha-
size the importance of childcare. We 
are telling the story. Only 26.8 percent 
of Black 3- to 4-year-old children are 
enrolled in publicly funded preschool, 
with the average cost of preschool for 
those without access $8,600. We are 
going to stop it with this. 
We are not going to be the Trump 
trillion-dollar tax cut to the top 1 per-
cent and putting a deep dive into our 
deficit. We are going to put a deep in-
vestment into the American people, 
particularly those people of color. 
I think it is extremely important 
that 
we 
talk 
about 
children 
and 
healthcare. 
Mr. Speaker, how much time do we 
have remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman has about 8 minutes. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. This is about 
children getting access to healthcare 
but, Mr. Speaker, there are many chil-
dren 
that 
don’t 
have 
access 
to 
healthcare. In those States where fami-
lies were not able to access the Afford-
able Care Act—and there is something 
called Children’s Health Insurance Pro-
gram, and that does provide for some 
aspect of care—we had the Federal 
Medicaid concept, and so Build Back 
Better now is going to put all of those 
people under the Affordable Care Act, 
and that is going to give the family ac-
cess to healthcare, which makes a siz-
able difference. I think it is extremely 
important that we do that, to be able 
to provide family healthcare. 
Now, I heard our Members be very 
truthful. We still want to get Medicare 
reduction on prescription drugs, a sys-
tem that would allow that. We still 
want family paid leave, and somebody 
said that that was continuing to be ne-
gotiated. No, Mr. Speaker, it is work-
ing under the umbrella and framework 
of President Biden’s agenda, and we 
want to just make sure that all of his 
agenda, within the context of being 
paid for, gets recognized. We want 
these families to receive the kind of re-
sources that are necessary. 
My colleagues talked about the child 
tax cut. I would like to call it that. I 
would just like to be sure that we real-
ize that if this plan is implemented, it 
may impact 17 million low-wage em-
ployees, such as hospitality workers 
and childcare providers, a framework 
of a tax cut that would help children. 
They are people who work important 
jobs but receive low pay, and this 
would get nearly 6 million people out 
of poverty with this kind of cut. This is 
a crucial contribution. 
Let me finish by letting you know 
what we have certainly gone through 
in Texas. Infrastructure is extremely 
important. Part of that is housing. 
During the pandemic, these are the 
kinds of signs we saw: ‘‘My landlord is 
calling, and I must pay or I will be 
evicted.’’ 
Now, we have the American Rescue 
Plan and the CARES Act, but $150 bil-
lion will be in for housing, improving 
the infrastructure of public housing. 
That hasn’t been done in decades; 50 
years I am told. And we will get that 
done. That is what is important about 
the BIF bill, the infrastructure bill 
that will have broadband. The very 
places where those people live, take 
the lead out of the pipes. 
And then, of course, for those of us 
who live in hurricane alley, our friends 
in Louisiana with Hurricane Ida, my 
constituents with Hurricane Harvey, 
and the number of hurricanes that 
have crossed the United States during 
2017, one after another. We will have in 
that infrastructure bill a worthy re-
sponse to the failing infrastructure of 
this Nation. 
We won’t have to worry about what 
people say about Russia and China or 
any other country. We will be enor-
mously competitive, even to the point 
of NASA. No one has even expressed 
their interest in that. They will have a 
space here to be able to keep us com-
petitive in space exploration. 
It will be extremely important that 
we have the opportunity to stop vio-
lence with our community violence in-
vestment, $2.5 billion. 
I am delighted to say this is the work 
of the Congressional Black Caucus. 
They put their hands around all of it, 
for our constituents and the American 
people. What Mr. HORSFORD has been 
speaking of is that he is proud to give 
a listing. That is what I did, I did a roll 
call of just what is going to be helped 
with Build Back Better and with BIF. 
I am delighted to stand here with the 
vice chair, and I yield to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. HORSFORD. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
I want to laud her and the members 
of the Congressional Black Caucus for 
all of the tremendous work on behalf of 
our families, on behalf of children, on 
behalf of communities. 
I want to just point out one addi-
tional thing that Ms. JACKSON LEE has 
worked on as the chair of the Sub-
committee on Crime, Terrorism, and 
Homeland Security in the Judiciary 
Committee and for her tremendous 
leadership on this. In her capacity on 
the Judiciary Committee, last year the 
United States saw the highest increase 
in gun homicides since national record-
keeping began. That was in 2020. And, 
sadly, we are still on track to see that 
number continue to increase this year. 
This violence, Mr. Speaker, falls dis-
proportionately on young Black men. 
Even though we make up only 6 per-
cent of the U.S. population, we account 
for about 50 percent of gun homicide 
victims. Now, those statistics aren’t 
just numbers. They are lives. And they 
are lives that every one of us should be 
held to account for. 
For me, as a Black man, raising 
three children with my wife—two sons 
and a daughter—it hits me very di-
rectly because this is what we worry 
about every single day when our chil-
dren leave our homes, because these 
are our friends, they are our children. 
I am proud, Mr. Speaker, that the 
Congressional Black Caucus made this 
issue a priority, and we went to Presi-
dent Biden and to Vice President HAR-
RIS, and we talked to them about the 
need to stop the onslaught of deaths. 
And he listened. He listened, and he in-
cluded $5 billion of funding and a bill 
that I am proud to have sponsored, 
along with my colleagues, the Break 
the Cycle of Violence Act, which funds 
community-based 
violence 
interven-
tion programs to save lives. 
Now, this is proven to work. These 
are community-based programs and 
partnerships with faith-based, commu-
nity-based organizations to provide 
mental health and wellness, job train-
ing and placement, and intervention 
programs so that when we pass the 
Build Back Better Act, it will include 
$5 billion of funding over 8 years and an 
additional amount of funding specifi-
cally for workforce development and 
placement. 
For months now we have negotiated 
in good faith. We have worked with our 
colleagues. We have listened. Now it is 
time for us to move forward. No more 
delays. No more excuses about process, 
no more focusing on personalities here 
in Washington. Let’s focus on the peo-
ple and the policy that will benefit 
them and their lives. 
Four years ago, when the Repub-
licans were in control of the White 
House, the House, and the Senate, they 
used their majority to pass tax cuts for 
the wealthiest 1 percent and the big-
gest 
corporations 
in 
our 
country. 
Today, Democrats are in the majority, 
and our priority is to deliver for the 
people. 
I am proud to work with my col-
leagues in the Congressional Black 
Caucus and the House Democrats to de-
liver this historic package. We are

going to get it done. I yield back to the 
gentlewoman from Texas. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, we 
are excited about this violence empha-
sis. As I conclude my remarks, let me 
pay tribute to deputies in my district 
who were shot by an AR–15. We pray 
for them, their families, and we should 
understand that violence has to end. 
At the same time, let’s take the 
words of John Robert Lewis, who sat 
with us on this floor for more than 27 
years, and in his last life he said to all 
of us, the Congressional Black Caucus, 
that is what we are going to do, carry 
on. We are going to carry on to make 
sure that we bring transformative— 
transformative—legislation, not only 
to the American people but to African 
Americans and people of color to 
change their lives forever. That is what 
Build Back is, and that is what the bi-
partisan bill is. We will work to make 
sure we cross the T’s and dot the I’s. 
Carry on. 
Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the 
Committees on the Judiciary, on Homeland 
Security, and on the Budget, and the Congres-
sional Black Caucus, I am pleased to co-an-
chor this Congressional Black Caucus Special 
Order with my colleague, the distinguished 
gentleman from New York, Congressman 
RITCHIE TORRES. 
I thank the Chair of the CBC, Congress-
woman BEATTY of Ohio, for organizing this 
Special Order to discuss the reasons why the 
CBC strongly supports the $1.75 billion Build 
Back Better Act conceived and advanced by 
President Biden and House Democrats to sup-
port visionary and transformative investments 
in the health, well-being, and financial security 
of America’s workers and families. 
Over the next hour, several of our col-
leagues will share their perspectives on why it 
is essential that we ‘‘go big’’ in building back 
better to our nation and all of its people have 
the opportunities and resources to compete 
and win in the changing global economy of the 
21st century. 
Mr. Speaker, it is often said that the federal 
budget is an expression of the nation’s values 
and the investments made to Build America 
Back Better are a clear declaration of congres-
sional Democrats’ commitment to ensuring 
that our government, our economy, and our 
systems work For The People. 
Mr. Speaker, these long-overdue invest-
ments in America’s future will be felt in every 
corner of the country and across every sector 
of American life, building on the success of 
the American Rescue Plan, accommodating 
historic infrastructure investments in the legis-
lative pipeline, and addressing longstanding 
deficits in our communities by ending an era 
of chronic underinvestment so we can emerge 
from our current crises a stronger, more equi-
table nation. 
Mr. Speaker, the bipartisan action we took 
in February 2021 when we passed the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan was a giant step in the right 
direction, but it was a targeted response to the 
immediate and urgent public health and eco-
nomic crises; it was not a long-term solution to 
many of the pressing challenges facing our 
nation that have built up over decades of dis-
investment in our nation and its people in 
every region and sector of the country. 
We simply can no longer afford the costs of 
neglect and inaction; the time to act is now. 
The Build Back Better Act makes the trans-
formative investments that we need to con-
tinue growing our economy, lower costs for 
working families, and position the United 
States as a global leader in innovation and the 
jobs of the future. 
This $1.75 trillion gross investment will build 
on the successes of the American Rescue 
Plan and set our nation on a path of fiscal re-
sponsibility and broadly shared prosperity for 
generations to come. 
The Build Back Better Act will provide re-
sources to improve our education, health, and 
child care systems, invest in clean energy and 
sustainability, address the housing crisis, and 
more; all while setting America up to compete 
and win in the decades ahead. 
The Build Back Better Act is paid for by en-
suring that the wealthy and big corporations 
are paying their fair share and Americans 
making less than $400,000 a year will not see 
their taxes increase by a penny. 
Let me repeat that: No American making 
less than $400,000 a year will not see their 
taxes increase by a penny. 
In sum, Mr. Speaker, the investments made 
by the Build Back Better Act will expand op-
portunity for all and build an economy pow-
ered by shared prosperity and inclusive 
growth. 
No one is better prepared or more experi-
enced to lead the American renaissance that 
will be produced by the investments made by 
the Build Back Better Act than President 
Biden, the architect of the American Rescue 
Plan and who as vice president during the 
Obama Administration oversaw the implemen-
tation of the Recovery Act, which saved mil-
lions of jobs and rescued our economy from 
the Great Recession the nation inherited from 
a previous Republican administration. 
And let us not forget that President Obama 
also placed his confidence in his vice-presi-
dent to oversee the rescue of the automotive 
industry, which he did so well that the Amer-
ican car industry fully recovered its status as 
the world leader. 
Mr. Speaker, let me briefly highlight some of 
the key investments made by the Build Back 
Better Act. 
The Build Back Better Act will provide two 
years of free pre-K and two years of free com-
munity college to ensure every student has 
the tools, resources, and opportunity to suc-
ceed in life. 
It will also invest in our teachers and institu-
tions that serve minority students and provide 
funding to give school buildings long-overdue 
infrastructure updates. 
People lead happier, healthier, and more 
productive lives when they have had access to 
high-quality education and that is why the 
Build Back Better Act makes necessary invest-
ments to increase quality education by four 
years for all students at no cost to hard-work-
ing families. 
The Build Back Better Act expands access 
to affordable, high-quality education beyond 
high school, which is increasingly important for 
economic growth and competitiveness in the 
21st century. 
Specifically, the Build Back Better Act will 
increase the maximum Pell Grant by $550 for 
more the more than 5 million students enrolled 
in public and private, non-profit colleges and 
expand access to DREAMers. 
It will also make historic investments in His-
torically 
Black 
Colleges 
and 
Universities 
(HBCUs), Tribal Colleges and Universities 
(TCUs), 
and 
minority-serving 
institutions 
(MSIs) to build capacity, modernize research 
infrastructure, and provide financial aid to low 
income students. 
The Build Back Better Act will help more 
people access quality training that leads to 
good, union, and middle-class jobs and will 
enable community colleges to train hundreds 
of thousands of students, create sector-based 
training opportunity with in-demand training for 
at least hundreds of thousands of workers, 
and invest in proven approaches like Reg-
istered Apprenticeships and programs to sup-
port underserved communities. 
The Build Back Better Act will increase the 
Labor Department’s annual spending on work-
force development by 50 percent for each of 
the next 5 years. 
The Build Back Better Act expands access 
to quality, affordable health care by strength-
ening the Medicare, Medicaid, and Affordable 
Care Act (ACA) Marketplace programs that 
millions of Americans already rely on. 
It includes a major new expansion of Medi-
care benefits, adding a hearing benefit to the 
program for the very first time. 
Only 30 percent of seniors over the age of 
70 who could benefit from hearing aids have 
ever had them. 
The Build Back Better Act strengthens the 
Affordable Care Act and reduces premiums for 
9 million Americans who buy insurance 
through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace 
by an average of $600 per person per year. 
Just for example, a family of four earning 
$80,000 per year would save nearly $3,000 
per year (or $246 per month) on health insur-
ance premiums and experts predict that more 
than 3 million people who would otherwise be 
uninsured will gain health insurance. 
The Build Back Better Act closes the Med-
icaid coverage gap, leading 4 million unin-
sured people to gain coverage. 
The Build Back Better Act will deliver health 
care coverage through Affordable Care Act 
premium tax credits to up to 4 million unin-
sured people in states that have locked them 
out of Medicaid. 
A 40-year old in the coverage gap would 
have to pay $450 per month for benchmark 
coverage—more than half of their income in 
many cases but thanks to the Build Back Bet-
ter Act individuals would pay $0 premiums, fi-
nally making health care affordable and acces-
sible. 
The Build Back Better Act strengthens the 
ACA by extending the enhanced Marketplace 
subsidies that were included in the American 
Rescue Plan. 
It also provides an affordable coverage op-
tion for the more than two million Americans 
living in states that have not expanded Med-
icaid under the ACA and do not earn enough 
to qualify for Marketplace subsidies. 
When the Build Back Better Act is fully im-
plemented soon gone will be the terrible old 
days when too many Americans are forced to 
choose between medical care and putting food 
on the table or affording other necessities. 
Mr. Speaker, approximately 3.9 million Black 
people were uninsured in 2019 before Presi-
dent Biden took office and even with the Af-
fordable Care Act’s premium subsidies, cov-
erage under the ACA was too expensive for 
many families, and over 570,000 Black people 
fell into the Medicaid ‘‘coverage gap’’ and 
were locked out of coverage because their 
state refused to expand Medicaid.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6063 
November 1, 2021 
The Build Back Better Act closes the Med-
icaid coverage gap while also lowering health 
care costs for those buying coverage through 
the ACA by extending the American Rescue 
Plan’s lower premiums, which could save 
360,000 Black people an average of $50 per 
person per month. 
With these changes, more than one in three 
uninsured Black people could gain coverage 
and with the addition of hearing coverage, 
more than 5.8 million Black people on Medi-
care will benefit. 
The Build Back Better Act will make an his-
toric investment in maternal health, including 
for Black women, who die from complications 
related to pregnancy at three times the rate of 
white women. 
Mr. Speaker, the cost of preschool in the 
United States exceeds $8,600 per year on av-
erage, and for as long as we can remember, 
child care prices in the United States have 
risen faster than family incomes, yet the 
United States still invests 28 times less than 
its competitors on helping families afford high- 
quality care for toddlers. 
The Build Back Better Act supports families 
in need of child care by providing access to 
safe, reliable, and high-quality care delivered 
by a well-trained child care workforce. 
The Build Back Better Act will provide uni-
versal and free preschool for all 3- and 4-year- 
olds. 
This is the largest expansion of universal 
and free education since states and commu-
nities across the country established public 
high school 100 years ago. 
This is important because our nation is 
strongest when everyone can join the work-
force and contribute to the economy. 
That is why this investment is vital to so 
many millions of—especially women—who are 
often forced to choose between working to 
support their family or caring for their family. 
The Build Back Better Act will ensure that 
the vast majority of working American families 
of four earning less than $300,000 per year 
will pay no more than 7 percent of their in-
come on child care for children under 6. 
Under the Build Back Better Act, parents 
who are working, looking for work, partici-
pating in an education or training program, 
and who are making under 2.5 times their 
states median income will receive support to 
cover the cost of quality care based on a slid-
ing scale, capped at 7 percent of their income. 
The Build Back Better Act will help states 
expand access to high-quality, affordable child 
care to about 20 million children per year— 
covering 9 out of 10 families across the coun-
try with young children. 
For two parents with one toddler earning 
$100,000 per year, the Build Back Better Act 
will produce more than $5,000 in child care 
savings per year. 
In addition, the Build Back Better Act pro-
motes nutrition security to support children’s 
health and help children reach their full poten-
tial by investing in nutrition security year- 
round. 
The legislation will expand free school 
meals to 8.7 million children during the school 
year and provide a $65 per child per month 
benefit to the families of 29 million children to 
purchase food during the summer. 
The Build Back Better Act will deliver afford-
able, high-quality care for older Americans and 
people with disabilities in their homes, while 
supporting the workers who provide this care. 
Right now, there are hundreds of thousands 
of older Americans and Americans with dis-
abilities on waiting lists for home care services 
or struggling to afford the care they need, in-
cluding more than 800,000 who are on state 
Medicaid waiting lists. 
A family paying for home care costs out of 
pocket currently pays around $5,800 per year 
for just four hours of home care per week. 
The Build Back Better Act will permanently 
improve Medicaid coverage for home care 
services for seniors and people with disabil-
ities, making the most transformative invest-
ment in access to home care in 40 years, 
when these services were first authorized for 
Medicaid. 
The Build Back Better Act will improve the 
quality of caregiving jobs, which will, in turn, 
help to improve the quality of care provided to 
beneficiaries. 
Mr. Speaker, I cannot emphasize enough 
how important it is that the Build Back Better 
Act will also reduce the cost of homebased 
care for the hundreds of thousands of older 
Black adults and Black people with disabilities 
who need it and are unable to access it. 
Not to mention that investment in home care 
will raise wages for home care workers, 28 
percent of whom are Black. 
In the area of housing, the Build Back Better 
Act makes investments to ensure that Ameri-
cans have access to safe and affordable 
housing by providing resources to increase 
housing vouchers and funding for tribal hous-
ing. 
It also supports investments in programs 
that will help address our nation’s housing cri-
sis by increasing the supply of affordable 
homes for those in need and investing in his-
torically underserved communities and those 
that have been previously left behind. 
Specifically, the Build Back Better Act 
makes the single largest and most com-
prehensive investment in affordable housing in 
history and will enable the construction, reha-
bilitation, and improvement of more than 1 mil-
lion affordable homes, boosting housing sup-
ply and reducing price pressures for renters 
and homeowners. 
It will address the capital needs of the public 
housing stock in big cities and rural commu-
nities all across America and ensure it is not 
only safe and habitable but healthier and more 
energy efficient as well. 
It will make a historic investment in rental 
assistance, expanding vouchers to hundreds 
of thousands of additional families. 
And, perhaps even more importantly, the 
Build Back Better Act includes one of the larg-
est investments in down payment assistance 
in history, enabling hundreds of thousands of 
first-generation homebuyers to purchase their 
first home and build wealth. 
In short, Mr. Speaker, this legislation will 
create more equitable communities, through 
investing in community-led redevelopments 
projects in historically under-resourced neigh-
borhoods and removing lead paint from hun-
dreds of thousands of homes, as well as by 
incentivizing state and local zoning reforms 
that enable more families to reside in higher 
opportunity neighborhoods. 
Th Build Back Better Act will spur and em-
power comprehensive action to build an equi-
table clean energy economy with historic in-
vestments to transform and modernize the 
electricity sector, lower energy costs for Amer-
icans, improve air quality and public health, 
create good-paying jobs, and strengthen U.S. 
competitiveness—all while putting our country 
on the pathway to 100 percent carbon-free 
electricity by 2035. 
The Build Back Better Act extends and ex-
pands clean energy tax credits and supports 
clean electricity performance payments so util-
ities can accelerate progress toward a clean 
electric grid at no added cost to consumers. 
The Build Back Better Act invests in clean 
energy, efficiency, electrification, and climate 
justice through grants, consumer rebates, and 
federal procurement of clean power and sus-
tainable materials, and by incentivizing private 
sector development and investment. 
Another exciting aspect of the Build Back 
Better Act, Mr. Speaker, is that it will drive 
economic opportunities, environmental con-
servation, and climate resilience—especially in 
underserved 
and 
disadvantaged 
commu-
nities—including through a new Civilian Cli-
mate Corps. 
Mr. Speaker, the Build Back Better Act in-
cludes a $100 billion investment to reform our 
broken immigration system—and does it con-
sistent with the Senate’s reconciliation rules— 
as well as to reduce backlogs, expand legal 
representation, and make the asylum system 
and border processing more efficient and hu-
mane. 
Mr. Speaker, immigrants eligible for such 
protection are an integral part of Texas’s so-
cial fabric. 
Texas is home to 386,300 immigrants who 
are eligible for protection, 112,000 of whom 
reside in Harris County. 
These individuals live with 845,300 family 
members and among those family members, 
178,700 are U.S.-born citizen children. 
These persons in Texas who are eligible for 
protection under the bill arrived in the United 
States at the average age of 8 and on aver-
age have lived in the United States since 
1996. 
They own 43,500 homes in Texas and pay 
$340,500,000 in annual mortgage payments 
and contribute $2,234,800,000 in federal taxes 
and $1,265,200,000 in state and local taxes 
each year. 
Annually, 
these 
households 
generate 
$10,519,000,000 in spending power in Texas 
and help power the national economy. 
The expansion of the Child Tax Credit 
(CTC) enacted in the American Rescue Plan 
has already benefitted nearly 66 million chil-
dren, put money in the pockets of millions of 
hard-working parents and guardians, and is 
expected to help cut child poverty by more 
than half. 
The Build Back Better Act not only extends 
this meaningful tax cut, but it also extends the 
expanded Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) 
and the expanded Child and Dependent Care 
Tax Credit, which help families make ends 
meet and put food on the table, reduce child 
poverty, and lessen the burden on hard-work-
ing Americans so they can provide a better fu-
ture for America’s children. 
Mr. Speaker, 22.1 percent of Black people 
fall below the poverty line, struggling to pay 
expenses like food, rent, health care, and 
transportation for their families. 
By extending the Child Tax Credit, the Build 
Back Better Act provides a major tax cut to 
nearly 3 million Black people and cuts the 
Black poverty rate by 34.3 percent, which will 
help the 85 percent of Black women who are 
either sole or co-breadwinners for their fami-
lies.

November 1, 2021 
By permanently extending the American 
Rescue Plan’s increase to the Earned-Income 
Tax Credit from $543 to $1,502, the Build 
Back Better Act will benefit roughly 2.8 million 
Black low-wage workers, including cashiers, 
cooks, delivery drivers, food preparation work-
ers, and child care providers. 
To put it all in perspective, Mr. Speaker, we 
have before us a once in a century opportunity 
to make gigantic progress in making ours a 
more perfect union, and to do it in a single 
bound with enactment of the Build Back Better 
Act, the most transformative legislation passed 
by this Congress since the Great Society and 
the New Deal. 
I would urge my Republican colleagues to 
heed the words of Republican Governor Jim 
Justice of West Virginia who said colorfully 
earlier this year: 
At this point in time in this nation, we 
need to go big. We need to quit counting the 
egg-sucking legs on the cows and count the 
cows and just move. And move forward and 
move right now. 
The same sentiment was expressed more 
eloquently by Abraham Lincoln in 1862 when 
he memorably wrote: 
The dogmas of the quiet past are inad-
equate to the stormy present. The occasion 
is piled high with difficulty, and we must 
rise with the occasion. As our case is new, so 
we must think anew and act anew. We must 
disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall save 
our country. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, let 
me begin by thanking my good friend and 
Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, 
Congresswoman BEATTY, for hosting this Spe-
cial Order Hour and to Congresswoman JACK-
SON LEE and Congressman TORRES for an-
choring it. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a consequential mo-
ment in our nation’s history. 
On the tail end of a once-in-a-century pan-
demic—one that has resulted in hundreds of 
thousands of deaths, record unemployment 
rates, and that has left our economy counting 
the costs—we are in desperate need of sub-
stantive relief in all aspects of our society. We 
need bold action, from bold leadership, in 
order to deliver bold results—and that’s what 
we have in President Biden’s Build Back Bet-
ter agenda. This agenda is a real opportunity 
to make historic, transformative investments in 
projects and programs that are supported by 
an overwhelming majority of the American 
people. 
As a Senior Member of the House Trans-
portation and Infrastructure Committee, I 
fought to include several provisions in this 
agenda through the Infrastructure Investment 
& Jobs Act that would greatly benefit commu-
nities not only in my district, but across the 
country. These include funding for a program 
that provides federal dollars to reconnect and 
revitalize communities historically harmed and 
marginalized by the construction of the Inter-
state Highway System; language to ensure 
prompt payment and sufficient payments to 
minority and disadvantaged subcontractors; 
and legislation to establish an electric grid re-
silience program for states like Texas to 
weatherize their power grids. Each of these 
measures—though different in nature and pur-
pose—will collectively contribute to the rebuild-
ing of our economy by creating more good- 
paying, equitable job opportunities. 
And as Chairwoman of the House Science, 
Space, and Technology Committee, I am 
steadfastly committed to strengthening our na-
tion’s research and innovation capabilities 
through the Build Back Better Act—both to en-
sure our continued international competitive-
ness and the wellbeing of our citizens here at 
home. I believe that investments in research 
and development now will pay untold divi-
dends for the future health and prosperity of 
our nation, which is why we put resources in 
this bill that will help us address the climate 
crisis, rebuild after this pandemic, promote in-
novation, and renew and repair our research 
infrastructure. It also makes an unprecedented 
investment in the National Science Founda-
tion, tapping into the diverse talent and institu-
tions from across our nation. We need a 
STEM workforce that represents the rich diver-
sity of America—because we cannot continue 
to lead in science and technology if we do not 
tap into all the brainpower our nation has to 
offer. To make sure of this, we included a pro-
vision that provides resources to support re-
search capacity building at our nation’s minor-
ity-serving institutions and invests in research, 
scholarships, and fellowships across all STEM 
disciplines. 
Mr. Speaker, the Congressional Black Cau-
cus has been and will continue to be at the 
forefront of these negotiations. Fifty-seven 
members—and six committee chairs—strong, 
our presence at the table, on behalf of our di-
verse constituencies, remains steadfast and 
will ultimately serve as the driving force behind 
our work For the People.

ISSUES OF THE DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. GOHMERT) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the minority 
leader. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, in re-
cent days, I have been doing some re-
search. In fact, one of the things I was 
looking at is the average income over 
the last couple of decades going back 
to 1991, and this was average annual 
wage according to the Social Security 
Administration, so maybe somebody 
would take issue with their accuracy. 
But according to their numbers, during 
the Clinton administration, the aver-
age American’s income went up each 
year about $1,000 a year. So over Presi-
dent Clinton’s 8 years in office, the av-
erage income went up about $8,000 over 
those 8 years. 
Under President Bush, it was a little 
more than $1,000 a year during his 8 
years. 
But during the Obama administra-
tion it was between a $7,000 and $8,000 
increase during the Obama administra-
tion. 
Then during the 4 years of the Trump 
administration, the average income 
went up about $2,000 a year. It was be-
tween $7,000 and $8,000 for the 4 years, 
a dramatic increase. 
But I was shocked, as I was looking 
at different numbers, to find that the 
net worth for Black households in 
America during the 8 years of the 
Obama administration went down by 30 
percent, on average. During the Trump 
administration, it didn’t go down. It 
went up significantly. 
As I look at what is being proposed in 
the Build Back Better program, and I 
see this administration having can-
celed the Keystone XL pipeline, which 
certainly was going to, and has, caused 
an escalation in fuel prices and energy 
prices, and of course, President Biden 
released the penalties that had been 
put on the Russian natural gas pipe-
line, so it is doing great now, and took 
off some of the penalties on Iran—any-
way, we have seen the price of energy 
going up significantly. 
It brought back to mind yet again 
the Honorable John Dingell’s com-
ment. He was looking forward to push-
ing through, in essence, a socialized 
medicine program through the com-
mittee he was chair of in 2009 and 2010, 
but he was famously asked about the 
cap-and-trade bill. He responded that 
the cap-and-trade bill is not only a tax, 
but it is a great big tax. 
He explained before that when you 
raise the price of energy, you are not 
hurting 
the 
billionaires, 
the 
megawealthy. It is an inconvenience to 
them when you raise the price of en-
ergy, be it electricity, propane, natural 
gas, coal, whatever it is. It is an incon-
venience to the very wealthy, but to 
those who are on fixed incomes, those 
who are scraping by working so hard 
every week and just getting by, if you 
increase the price of gasoline, elec-
tricity, energy, you just devastate 
those households. It is not just a little 
tax to them. It is devastating. 
The inflation that comes with an up-
ward explosion of the price of fuel and 
energy, but especially fuel, as this ad-
ministration has done, it inflates the 
price of everything. There is just not 
much of anything, unless you are buy-
ing from some pickup truck or some 
roadside 
kiosk—otherwise, 
you 
are 
having to pay a lot of extra energy 
costs, whether it is for the ingredients 
of something you are buying or wheth-
er it is the product getting to market. 
But usually, it is all of the above. The 
energy prices inflate costs of every-
thing, basically. 
That is what has happened to the 
working poor in America. That is what 
has happened to seniors on fixed in-
comes. They are being devastated as 
prices continue to skyrocket, with no 
end in sight. 
On a trip some years back during the 
Obama administration, some of us 
went to Germany, and we met with 
some of their energy leaders. In one 
meeting, the driver of our little van 
was from Berlin, and he sat in and lis-
tened. I was talking to him privately 
after the meeting, and he said I hear 
all these rich people talking about how 
great our green energy is in Germany, 
but I have had to go from having one 
job to having three jobs, hardly ever 
getting to see my family, so they could 
brag about our green energy. But it is

destroying my family. It has com-
pletely destroyed my family time. I am 
having to work these two other jobs 
just to cover our energy costs. So it is 
kind of hard listening to them brag 
about it when it is coming out of my 
hide. I am the one, and people just like 
me all over Germany are the ones, who 
are paying for them to be able to brag 
about our green energy because it is 
costing us a tremendous amount in the 
way of personal time, family time, and 
additional time working to pay for 
their bragging. 
As we look at these issues and the 
costs skyrocketing in America, who 
has benefited? Well, China has bene-
fited dramatically. We know they are 
still on course to have 100 new coal- 
powered energy plants go online over 
the next couple of years. They don’t 
care. 
Of course, when we had coal-powered 
plants here in the U.S.—there are not 
many left—but when we had them, 
they have scrubbers in there that are 
taking pollutants out of the air before 
it ever gets out of the stacks to the air. 
If we are doing the coal burning here 
in the U.S., it is not so hard on our en-
vironment as it is in China or India, 
but especially China, because when 
people are just struggling to survive 
and to have enough money to put food 
on the table for their families, they are 
not that worried about how their yard 
looks or how things look, how the envi-
ronment is. The same is true not only 
for an individual but for a country. 
If the economy is struggling, the peo-
ple in that country are not as inter-
ested in cleaning up the environment. 
We will have to wait, they think, until 
we are making decent money, and then 
we can worry about the environment. 
Here in the United States, though, if 
you go back to 2007, every year since 
then, including through the Trump 
years, we have been producing 1.3 per-
cent less carbon dioxide. We can debate 
about what that does to the environ-
ment, whether it makes the tempera-
ture warmer. 
I have read where experts have said if 
you have a choice between the tem-
perature getting slightly warmer or 
slightly colder, you want warmer be-
cause if it is getting slightly colder, 
that means there is less time for crops 
to grow. If it is slightly warmer, not 
too much warmer, then you have more 
time for crops to grow. You have more 
food, and you have fewer people starv-
ing. 
There are a lot of areas for debate, 
but for those who are concerned about 
carbon dioxide emissions, we have been 
on the right track. We continue to re-
duce the amount of carbon dioxide we 
are putting out in this country. 
So there is nothing about building 
back better. This has been going on for 
a long time. Largely, we are told by 
the experts, that is because we have 
been converting coal plants to natural 
gas, and natural gas is such a clean- 
burning fuel. 
For those who want to get rid of all 
fossil fuels, if they would just take a 
serious look at all the things in the 
room in which they are located or the 
car in which they are located, they will 
find that so much of what we have that 
has made our lives easier, helping peo-
ple rest better, is as a result of the use 
of fossil fuel. There are so many prod-
ucts that cannot be manufactured 
without natural gas as part of the man-
ufacturing process. You have to have 
natural gas to make so many products. 
I was looking at getting some plastic 
composite boards for part of the area in 
our backyard so they wouldn’t deterio-
rate so often, and they are expensive. 
But when they last for decades instead 
of a matter of short years, it looks like 
a good thing. That is using recycled 
plastic, finding more and more uses for 
that plastic, fiberglass. 
There are so many things we can’t 
produce. Synthetic fibers, so much of 
the carpets and rugs we have are syn-
thetic. The toothbrush, you wouldn’t 
have a modern-day toothbrush—and I 
realize that, yes, there are people who 
have used bark off of certain trees to 
brush their teeth. I get that, but I kind 
of like having a modern-day tooth-
brush myself. You wouldn’t have that 
without fossil fuel, particularly nat-
ural gas. 
b 2100 
People say we need more electric 
cars. We need to get rid of fossil fuel. 
You cannot currently manufacture an 
electric car without the use of fossil 
fuel. Even if you don’t use fossil fuel to 
power the vehicle, you are going to 
have to use it in the production of 
things within the car or there will be 
no car. So, I don’t know, maybe some-
day somebody will build a wooden car, 
but wooden batteries are not going to 
work. 
For those of us that recognize how 
the length of life has gotten even 
longer during our modern history, med-
icine advances have just been extraor-
dinary. There is a great book, ‘‘The 
Five Thousand Year Leap’’, that points 
out that when settlers came to Amer-
ica, they used basically the same type 
of farming methodology and tools that 
have been used for thousands of years. 
There hasn’t been a whole lot of 
change. 
But if you look at the last 150 years 
in the United States and in Western 
civilization, you see dramatic increases 
and advances in the way that we have 
progressed, whether it is farming, med-
icine. Heck, if you go back 100 years or 
so when medical historians say in the 
early 1900s, up to that point, for the 
whole of human history, you had a bet-
ter chance of getting sicker after see-
ing a doctor than you did at getting 
better. 
And then you look at the—since 1910, 
1920—some say it might be the 1918 pro-
tocols 
during 
that 
pandemic—but 
around that time, you started having a 
better chance of getting better after 
seeing a doctor. And look at where we 
are now. People go to the doctor and 
expect to be made well because we have 
been able, by the grace of God, to de-
velop some different cures. Life has 
gotten longer. Life has gotten better 
quality. 
So much of what we have is made by 
the use of fossil fuels. We need to do it 
cleanly, as cleanly as possible. But, 
again, when you take an economy in 
the direction that the build back better 
Biden administration has been doing as 
we head to the toilet with this econ-
omy—and there is no end in sight for 
this race to the bottom—then you real-
ize we have come so far and now we are 
going in the wrong direction. 
There have been times, like World 
War II when we were struggling might-
ily, but we are not going through a 
world war right now. We should be 
doing well. And we saw, during the 
Trump administration for the first 
time in decades, something had hap-
pened. 
In 1990, when I brought a friend to 
speak to our Rotary Club, he had said, 
We are going the wrong direction. We 
are becoming more and more reliant on 
foreign countries for our energy. It has 
been years, he said, since we have been 
energy independent, and we are going 
the wrong way and it is going to de-
stroy this country, if we can’t produce 
the energy we need. 
Mr. Speaker, 30 years later—not even 
30 years later—we were energy inde-
pendent, the biggest producer of fossil 
fuels in the world. And we used it 
cleaner than anybody else. Virtually 
almost every other country, maybe 
some small ones, do a little better. 
But China knows that they are not 
going to be breathing their own air, it 
turns with the planet, and we end up 
breathing as much as they do right 
here in America. Not the clean air we 
produce more of every year for many 
years, but the polluted air that China 
is letting off as they continue to move 
toward putting us in their wake as 
they move toward becoming the great-
est economy in the world. And spend-
ing money, massive amounts of money 
we don’t have, creates not only infla-
tion but it weakens this country. 
Mr. Speaker, I have heard some in re-
cent days say if we are not careful, we 
are going to end up like Greece. And 
actually, if you look at the debt that 
we had at the end of the Obama admin-
istration, we were already Greece. The 
difference is, we got to produce our 
own currency. Greece was using the 
euro, so they didn’t get to decide to 
create a lot more money in their sys-
tem. And the dollar was the world 
standard. It was the world currency. 
I know there are companies, includ-
ing China, they are advocating against 
the dollar being the world currency and 
that it is used to buy oil in the world 
market, but that hasn’t happened. I am 
very thankful for that. But if we were 
not the world currency, and we didn’t 
produce our own money, then we would 
already be in as big a trouble as Greece 
is because of the recklessness. And we 
are seeing it like never before in this 
administration.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6066 
November 1, 2021 
Yes, it is true the Obama administra-
tion, with the Democrats helping them, 
they hit between $1.5 and $1.6 trillion 
deficit in one year. Well, this adminis-
tration, this Democrat majority are 
working very hard to eclipse that by a 
lot. 
We were warned back when we had 
over a trillion-dollar deficit more than 
one year, the agencies that rate coun-
try’s economies and their currency and 
their debt, they may have to rate, 
downgrade, 
our 
debt. 
Standard 
& 
Poor’s did that because we wouldn’t 
get our spending under control—not 
enough. 
If any other rating agency had down-
graded our debt, then the cost of bor-
rowing money would have gone up dra-
matically and we would have ended up 
spending more paying interest than we 
were taking care of seniors who were 
counting on their fixed income. So 
there are some dark days ahead if we 
continue on this course of spending 
money we don’t have. It is like every-
thing this administration can see to 
throw money at that might help create 
more Democrat Party voters and they 
are throwing money at it. 
So people were shocked, including 
Democrat friends, they were shocked 
to hear that this administration is pro-
posing paying $450,000 to legal immi-
grants that were separated from a 
child. Well, we know that did happen 
some during the Trump years. We 
know that it has continued to happen 
during the Biden years; that it hap-
pened under the Obama administra-
tion. And it can be a good idea until we 
are sure that an adult with a child that 
is already breaking our laws by coming 
in illegally is actually related to and, 
hopefully, the parent of that child in-
stead of part of the drug cartels that 
continue to use them in sex traf-
ficking. And we have had people that 
turned out not to be related to the 
child they were claiming, and we have 
been able to interrupt that. And so it is 
important that we don’t just take this 
at face value, especially when we have 
reports of children being recycled to 
come across with people over our bor-
der illegally. 
So under the Biden administration, if 
you think, Okay, these people come in, 
they break U.S. law, we are going to 
give each one $450,000. And that might 
not mean much to somebody who has a 
son that sold paintings for $500,000, and 
I wouldn’t object if the Biden adminis-
tration wanted to give each illegal im-
migrant a painting that Hunter Biden 
had done. If they said, Here is your half 
a million; here is another painting that 
Hunter Biden has done. Enjoy it. 
Maybe you can sell it for half a million 
and you will be set for life. Let’s try 
that. 
Mr. Speaker, $450,000, if you look at 
the Social Security administration, 
the wages, well, for 2020, the most re-
cent numbers we have, the average in-
come for an American last year was 
$53,000—like $53,300 or something like 
that—but $53,000 a year. 
b 2110 
Now, the rate is normally around 22 
percent. There is data that indicates 
the effective rate paid for income tax 
may be around 13 to 14 percent. Let’s 
just round it and say that the average 
American making $53,000 a year pays 20 
percent income tax. That would be 
$10,600 a year that a person making 
$53,000 would pay in Federal income 
tax. 
If you took all $10,600 of Federal in-
come tax coming from the average 
wage-earner of $53,000 a year, and if 
you took that $10,600 and applied that 
toward the $450,000 President Biden 
wants to give to each of these illegal 
immigrants, it would take 421⁄2 years of 
the average American wage Federal in-
come tax to pay one person who broke 
the U.S. laws and came into the coun-
try illegally. That is what appears to 
be justice to the Biden administration. 
And how is our President looking to 
the rest of the world? The story today, 
as he came into the G20 Summit, he 
came in—according to the article I 
saw—20 minutes late. He said, in es-
sence, sorry to be late. He had been 
trying to get past the elevators—they 
had a problem with the elevators and 
that is why he was 20 minutes late. 
Somebody needs to help him. 
I think it would be helpful not to 
leave people from the biggest coun-
tries, except for China and Russia, they 
didn’t 
come—their 
leaders 
didn’t 
come—but the rest, let’s show them a 
little more respect by not making 
them wait 20 minutes for our President 
to show up. I think that would be a 
good thing. Kind of lend a better at-
mosphere to those type of meetings. 
Perhaps then you wouldn’t have for-
eign 
reporters 
saying 
things 
like: 
President Biden looks like he needs a 
nursing home and a hot bowl of soup. 
We need to help our President give a 
better image of America. I know there 
is no intention for our President caus-
ing problems like that, none whatso-
ever, so I am avoiding in engaging in 
personalities. But I think it would be 
good—there are so many people helping 
the President—to help him represent 
our country well. 
So in an article here, a $450,000 pay-
ment to illegal aliens would exceed 
various programs for American citi-
zens. And, of course, we, in Congress, 
did a good thing in recent years. We 
felt like the families of those people 
who have lost a loved one in combat, 
they should have been getting more 
than the measly thousands of dollars 
they were, so we increased the amount 
that the family of an American hero 
who was killed in combat would get. It 
was increased to $400,000. 
Well, we find out that the Biden ad-
ministration wants to provide more 
than we provide to the family who has 
lost a loved one in combat representing 
and defending our country and our na-
tional interests. Someone who crossed 
the border illegally, according to this 
administration, should get an extra 
$50,000 more than those who died for 
this country. 
We also know—and I am pleased that 
Secretary Buttigieg is back from pa-
ternity leave because we do have a real 
crisis in our supply chain. We didn’t 
have this problem during the Trump 
administration. It sure seemed to be a 
good idea the way we were manufac-
turing more of the things we need in 
America. I am not a big fan of tariffs, 
but as I told President Trump, since 
you are simply using them as a tool to 
get better trade deals then I will vote 
for those tariffs for such use, so that 
we can get more fairness in our agree-
ments with foreign countries. That 
worked out. President Trump did make 
some good deals. 
We are seeing all that fall aside as 
this administration seems to be more 
dedicated to helping China, Russia, 
Iran, and OPEC nations do better with 
their economy than we are here at 
home. 
I realize there are some people here 
in Washington that feel like America 
has more than it deserves. I believe 
God has blessed us more than we de-
serve in America. We are seeing those 
things change as we have continued to 
forget more and more just who the 
source is for the blessings in this coun-
try. 
In fact, what occurred to me is, in-
stead of build back better, as we see 
the economy in shambles, prices going 
through the roof, more and more peo-
ple now being fired, the economy ap-
pears headed in even deeper trouble the 
further we go. Maybe instead of build 
back better, we could call it Biden’s 
bulldozings of our blessings. 
Here is an article from Fortune. No 
sign of relief. The global supply chain 
crisis could last well into February. 
And as I thought back, Vice President 
HARRIS—it seems like it was back in 
August when she was speaking to some 
folks—somebody made fun of her for 
saying: You may want to order your 
Christmas presents early this year so 
you make sure you have them. I didn’t 
know why anybody would make fun of 
her because, as it turns out, she was ac-
tually exactly right. Apparently she 
knew back in August we were going to 
have trouble getting the things we 
need in America. 
I have been amazed to see car lots 
more empty than they have cars. 
Shocking. I have never seen some of 
these car lots with so few cars ever in 
my life. 
There is an article from The Hill: 
More people in Manchin’s, Sinema’s 
home States want to hold off on new 
spending. That is from polls—an article 
by Mychael Schnell from The Hill. 
b 2120 
People have been trying to convince 
Senator MANCHIN and Senator SINEMA 
that they just need to sign off on 
spending trillions more dollars. But re-
cent polls apparently are showing that 
people in their home States appreciate 
them not agreeing to more and more of 
the runaway spending that would just 
increase inflation.

One other thing people are noticing— 
a Washington Times story from Ste-
phen Dinan titled ‘‘Biden administra-
tion expands no-go zones where ICE 
can’t arrest illegal immigrants’’—so 
millions more are coming in, and fewer 
and fewer are being deported. 
Mr. Speaker, I think it is important 
for people to understand that this feel-
ing that we need to secure our borders 
doesn’t come from any kind of xeno-
phobia. I look at the Hispanic culture, 
and though generalizing can be dan-
gerous, generally speaking, I see faith 
in God; I see a hard work ethic; and I 
see a devotion to family. Well, those 
are things I believe made America the 
great country it has been. We need 
more of that help. 
Mr. Speaker, if you look at the con-
tributions that immigrants have made 
from countries all over the world to 
this country, to make it as powerful 
and as great as it is, we want immigra-
tion. No country in the world, even 
those bigger than the United States, is 
as generous with providing visas as the 
United States is—over 1 million a year. 
But as Milton Friedman pointed out, 
if we are going to provide welfare in 
this country, which started back in the 
1960s, then we can’t have open borders 
or this country will be over very soon. 
It will be overwhelmed with people 
coming in. It will destroy the golden 
goose that some look at the U.S. as 
being, and there won’t be any country 
to flee to looking for a better life. 
Some in allied countries tell me: If 
you lose your freedom in America, 
there won’t be any freedom in the 
world. We will all lose our freedom 
pretty quickly if you lose yours. 
This is critical stuff. But I think the 
biggest danger of people swarming 
across our border, as they have been 
doing this year unimpeded, is the dan-
ger that Benjamin Franklin pointed 
out. He didn’t go into detail, but as 
most people here remember, he was 
asked by a lady as he left the Constitu-
tional Convention at the conclusion: 
What have you given us? 
And as most everybody here knows, 
he replied: A republic, madam, if you 
can keep it. 
A republic, a republican form of gov-
ernment, that is with a little R, not 
the Republican Party. A republic is 
what the Romans came up with after 
they looked at democracy from the 
Greeks. They actually had a real de-
mocracy where most everybody par-
ticipated in the big decisions. Fortu-
nately, they realized you can’t let ev-
erybody vote as a juror in law cases, so 
they restricted those law case juries to 
only having 501 people. As I understand 
it, it was 501 people on the jury that 
voted to make Socrates drink poison as 
his penalty. 
That is what you see, Mr. Speaker, 
when you have too many participating 
in a process. It gets out of hand. You 
get a handful, they start running, and 
they get people fired up. Before you 
know it, Mr. Speaker, one of the finest 
men in the country is ordered to drink 
poison. 
Mr. Speaker, you have to be careful. 
That is what the Romans realized, so 
they created a republic. We like the 
democratic idea that people get to vote 
and participate in government, but 
let’s have them elect representatives, 
then the representatives study the 
issues, and they vote on behalf of the 
rest of the country. If we don’t like 
how they are voting, then we throw 
them out in the next election and se-
lect another representative. That is the 
republic form of government. 
Republics generally have not lasted 
more than 200 years. We are 30 years or 
so past the 1789 ratification of our Con-
stitution. Some would say: Well, when 
we pass 200 years, we are living on bor-
rowed time. 
We know history, but not enough. 
Too many of our schools quit teaching 
history because the Federal Govern-
ment got involved in education. 
Is education an enumerated power 
under the Constitution for the Federal 
Government to be involved in? No, it is 
not. But in 1979, President Carter cre-
ated the Department of Education. As 
a result, the percentage of teachers in 
education has dropped dramatically. 
Nearly three-fourths of the employ-
ees in K–12 education in Texas were 
teachers. But then after the Depart-
ment of Education comes along, you 
got more bureaucrats here making 
more requirements for the folks in 
Austin and every State capital. So 
those folks have to hire more people to 
answer the mandates of the Depart-
ment of Education in Washington. And 
to get their information, they have to 
mandate more people in every school 
board in elementary school. 
I had a fantastic public school edu-
cation in elementary school, middle 
school, and high school. In elementary 
school, we had a principal, the prin-
cipal had an assistant, then there was 
the janitor, then there were the people 
who worked in the cafeteria, and that 
was it. Now, every school has to have 
so many people working in the admin-
istration gathering information to send 
to the State capital so they can send it 
to Washington. 
As I recall, it was either late eighties 
or early nineties, I think it was early 
nineties, but I was on the board of 
Former Students of Texas A&M. I was 
asking the president, we had some 
other people there who worked on ana-
lyzing SAT scores. I said: I understand 
the SAT test has now been recalibrated 
so that students will do better than 
they have in the past for answering the 
same number of questions right. Yes, it 
has been recalibrated. People were em-
barrassed that SAT scores were a lot 
lower now than they used to be. 
If you took the SAT in the early sev-
enties, your score now would probably 
be around 200 points higher than it was 
back then. I was intrigued by that. 
Why did we have to recalibrate the 
SAT? Well, it was so people wouldn’t 
think schools were failing during the 
nineties. So SAT scores came back up 
not because they were doing better but 
because the scoring was recalibrated. 
That was a rather interesting illu-
mination on education, but we con-
tinue to see problems. 
As both Republican and Democrat 
Presidents have been pushing more 
control, I think President Trump tried 
to give more control back locally. But 
what has happened is the Federal Gov-
ernment has taken more and more con-
trol right here in Congress. We con-
tinue to pass stuff that says: You don’t 
get your money back. Of course, we 
know the money comes from the States 
up here. But we are not going to give 
you your money back unless you do 
this, that, or the other like we tell you. 
Well, one of the mandates has been 
you had to pass this federally man-
dated test, and the federally mandated 
test was extremely light on history. I 
am told that there are times when 
there isn’t any history, maybe one his-
tory question, and it is not always good 
history, if a question is asked. 
b 2130 
So I hear from schools back home: 
We have to teach to the mandated test 
because if any student doesn’t pass the 
federally mandated test, we don’t get 
all of that Federal money that came 
from us back to us. They keep it for 
that student. 
So to avoid not getting back even as 
much of our own money as we should, 
we have got to get people prepared to 
pass the test. So some schools, they 
got rid of music, they got rid of art. 
And some of us are big advocates and 
we go: Wait a minute. Do you not un-
derstand that when it comes to music, 
it comes to art, you are getting syn-
apses to fire in the brain that might 
not fire otherwise, and if you can get 
more synapses firing, then the stu-
dent’s brain can accumulate more, 
work better, and then overall do better 
scoring? 
Look, we have got to get them to 
pass the test, I am told, and those 
things, music, art, are not on the test, 
so we have got to concentrate on mak-
ing sure the students are ready for that 
federally-mandated test. Well, that is a 
shame. 
Music and art add dramatically to 
life. And there are some awesome art 
teachers. They didn’t do too well with 
me. Apparently, there is an art gene in 
my background. My dad was artistic; 
had a daughter that was very artistic. 
But it was a latent gene in me. I see 
what it adds in the art contests that all 
of the Representatives, I think most of 
us have in our districts, but you see the 
incredible products that these kids are 
able to create, and it is really inspir-
ing. 
Yet so many are having to cut back 
or get rid of art altogether. Why? Be-
cause of the Federal mandates from 
here on high, on Mount Olympus, on 
Capitol Hill. 
It is important, also, on how we treat 
people. When I go to the border, I don’t 
mistreat anybody that comes in ille-
gally. I try to help all I can, but they 
have come into the country illegally.

And we need to get back to the Trump 
policies before we get overwhelmed. 
And going back to the point that Ben-
jamin Franklin made: It takes work to 
keep a republic. It doesn’t just happen. 
That is why it has happened so rarely. 
That is why the United States of Amer-
ica is such an anomaly in history. 
There has never been a country like 
this. Even Solomon’s Israel didn’t have 
all of the individual opportunities, all 
of the individual assets and comforts 
that we have here in America. It is an 
amazing place, but it takes work. It 
takes education of our children, train-
ing them up so they understand what it 
takes to preserve a republic, a rep-
resentative form of government, and 
getting stronger and stronger as we 
have done until more recent years. 
When you have people flooding in, I 
mean, 2 million people this year, this 
administration has 3 more years, so are 
we going to have 8 million, at least 8 
million more people enter this country 
illegally? They are not coming from 
countries that understand how to pre-
serve a republic. And I will tell you 
some of the very best citizens we have 
in this whole country are people who 
went through the process of becoming 
legal citizens, and I hear from them a 
lot in my district. 
They love America because they 
know how it can be outside of America, 
and they don’t want our country be-
coming like those countries they came 
from. People from Venezuela, people 
from Central America, from Eastern 
Bloc countries are some of the best 
citizens we have got, some from Rus-
sia. My cousin married a Russian, and 
she knows. We were talking about it 
last week, and she is feeling a sense of 
urgency. We are losing what we have 
had. We are becoming more like the 
place I was so anxious to leave. 
It takes work to keep a republic and 
to enjoy the blessings we have re-
ceived. People who are flooding in, 
they have never been trained on what 
it takes to preserve a republic. And one 
of the big issues to so many people dur-
ing the COVID pandemic has been the 
unprecedented grab of power that the 
Federal Government has never had be-
fore. Never. We have had pandemics 
that were a lot more deadly than 
COVID, but no one has ever had the 
nerve to tell people who were not in-
fected, who had thriving businesses, 
that they had to close down their busi-
ness. We are going to let these people 
open. We are not letting you open. 
Thirty years ago, they would have 
opened anyway, probably 20 years ago, 
and they would have won in court with-
out question. You can’t shut down 
business. It is unprecedented. And for 
heaven’s sake, to tell churches they 
couldn’t open. For the huge majority of 
our history, when there was a time of 
emergency, including a pandemic, peo-
ple felt like they needed to be in 
church praying; that they needed to be 
asking God for help. And for the first 
time in our history, we didn’t have a 
President that issued a National Day of 
Prayer & Fasting, asking God to help 
us. For the first time in our history, we 
had a national proclamation: You have 
got to close businesses. You have got 
to close churches. You can’t meet. In 
some places States said you can’t even 
sing in church because you open your 
mouth. We can’t allow that. 
And I know there are still a lot of 
mixed signals on masks. It is inter-
esting. There are cloth masks. I had a 
mask getting on a plane with, one of 
the SHEMA97 masks designed in Israel. 
It has four layers of cloth that are ion-
ized to kill germs. They don’t just 
catch them. They will kill germs. 
The flight attendant said: I can see 
your nose, so that mask can’t be any 
good. It can’t be any good, she says. 
And she was wearing one of the little 
blue-and-white masks. Talk about not 
doing any good. Although, in fairness, I 
have read that there were some studies 
that said those little blue-and-white 
masks can decrease your percentage of 
getting COVID by 0.2 percent. So 0.2 
percent, that is what it is, great. Wear 
one of those little, cloth masks. 
But then we see down in Florida that 
has been the most open, that they have 
fewer cases percentagewise. They are 
doing better than any other State in 
the country and they have been the 
most open State we have had. So it is 
interesting. And I have an article here 
from The Gateway Pundit. ‘‘It Wasn’t 
Just Beagles and Monkeys—Fauci’s 
NIH Also Funded Medical Experiments 
on AIDS Orphans in New York City.’’ 
I read somewhere else that these 
were Black orphans that had AIDS, and 
the Fauci NIH was doing experiments 
on them, according to this article of 
Jim Hoft. They reported that 25 chil-
dren, those Black orphanage babies, 
died during the drug studies they were 
doing on those poor little babies. An 
additional 55 children died following 
the studies while they were in foster 
care. Tim Ross, director of the child 
welfare program at Vera—I am looking 
for what that stands for—the Vera In-
stitute, that as of 2009, 29 percent of 
the remaining 417 children who were 
used in drug studies had died; 532 chil-
dren that are admitted to have been 
used now. 
b 2140 
That was in the last 20 years. I don’t 
know if Dr. Fauci has been asked if he 
knew about that. We found out he lied 
about funding gain of function in 
China. 
Another article from Fox Business, 
Elizabeth Faddis, that Dr. Fauci is fac-
ing a demand from lawmakers on both 
sides of the aisle to divulge informa-
tion regarding the alleged use of an ex-
perimental drug on puppies. 
I guarantee you, as more people find 
out that NIH was using orphan Black 
AIDS babies for drug experiments, that 
killed many of them, there will be even 
more cries from both sides of the aisle 
on answers. I thought we were so far 
past anything like that. I mean, after 
the outrageous Tuskegee experiments, 
I can’t believe we have been doing that 
same stuff in the last 20 years. Some-
body needs to be held accountable for 
these things. 
We are in deeply troubling times, and 
there is a good chance that if we don’t 
get back to making sure children in 
America know how to sustain a repub-
lic, we are headed for losing it. 
It is because of a fear of that, a fear 
of the loss of freedom, that caused me 
to leave the bench and run and try to 
get elected to Congress so I could make 
a difference in legislation, so we could 
try to salvage this little experiment in 
self-government. But it seems pretty 
clear it is not going to last much 
longer. 
You can’t absorb 8 million people, 
who not only most of them don’t speak 
the language, but they are adults who 
have no clue, have never been edu-
cated. They have certainly got the ca-
pacity to learn, but they have never 
been educated on what it takes to pre-
serve self-government and the blessings 
that we have in this country. 
If they are not educated on that, if 
they are simply handed $450,000 each, 
then that is all they know. Wow, this is 
a country where you come in, demand 
money, they give it to you. You can’t 
sustain a country like that, and we 
won’t. No one ever has. 
In Rome, there was one Caesar that 
figured that bread and circuses were 
being given to keep people peaceable, 
and it was keeping them from working. 
He tried to do away with it. But by 
then, it was too late. 
Let’s act now before it is too late. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

Direct them in their work, surrounding 
them with Your gracious love. Let all 
their plans and purposes be in accord-
ance with Your holy will. May they de-
sire to serve You and country with

Lord, enlighten them with Your wis-
dom so they will find solutions to the

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY

f 
BUILD BACK BETTER PLAN 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
last week, President Biden unveiled a 
framework for his Build Back Better 
plan that will make historic invest-
ments to help millions of working- and 
middle-class 
families 
achieve 
the 
American dream in the 21st century 
while taking new and bold steps to 
tackle the climate crisis. 
Over the weekend, I continued dili-
gent, assiduous negotiations with my 
Senate colleagues, the Speaker, and 
the White House as Congress prepares 
to take action on the President’s pro-
posals. We are still talking and work-
ing through important details and 
making good progress, and I want to 
thank all my colleagues for their dili-
gence, their expertise, and their com-
mitment to getting something done. 
As I have always said, nobody is 
going to get everything they want in 
the deal, but we will have some things 
that everyone wants. Even as legisla-
tive text continues to get finalized, the 
framework itself already contains very, 
very good and important things that 
will make a tremendous difference in 
the lives of the American people. It 
will help the middle class stay in the 
middle class. It will help those strug-
gling to get to the middle class get 
there a little more easily. It will really 
help Americans in ways that Wash-
ington has not helped Americans in 
quite a few years. 
One way it will help is childcare. 
Tens of millions of American families 
struggle with the unaffordable cost of 
taking care of their children. For some 
families, childcare can cost over $10,000 
a year, forcing parents to make the 
painful choice between going to work 
and looking after their kids. The con-
sequences for our economy, with its 
shortage of workers, for parents, and 
for our kids are severe and long-last-
ing. 
The framework, with its historic in-
vestments in childcare and universal 
pre-K, would finally—finally—provide 
working- 
and 
middle-class 
families 
with the urgently needed help they 
need so parents, particularly women, 
can enter the workplace, earn a living, 
and not worry about whether their kids 
are being well taken care of. 
The 
President’s 
framework 
also 
makes long-overdue progress in the 
fight against climate change. It con-
tains the largest investment to address 
the climate crisis in American history. 
American families from one coast to 
the other are in desperate need of relief 
from 
the 
consequences 
of 
climate 
change. Wildfires in the West make it 
harder for people to breathe, especially 
those with conditions like asthma. 
Flooding in the Midwest destroys crops 
and homes and local economies and 
poisons fragile ecosystems and even 
the safety of drinking water. Extreme 
storms in the winter make it harder for 
those without proper heating to stay 
safe, as we saw tragically in Texas. Of 
course, the hurricanes and tropical 
storms on the east coast have caused 
regular flooding, the likes of which we 
haven’t seen in a long time occurring 
as recently in the Mid-Atlantic as this 
weekend. 
We have an opportunity—a real op-
portunity—to take unprecedented ac-
tion to protect Americans against 
these threats. While there will be so 
much more to do, this is a bold step in 
the right direction. As the President 
spoke before the world today in Glas-
gow, his framework is proof the United 
States is ready to once again lead by 
example against the greatest existen-
tial crisis of our time. 
There is so much more to like in this 
framework. As I have said repeatedly, 
when this bill is passed, it will be fully 
paid 
for 
and 
reduce—reduce—infla-
tionary pressures—something that has

been affirmed by many, many econo-
mists. It will be fully paid for and, at 
the same time, will reduce some of the 
bottlenecks and high costs that people 
have. It will lower people’s costs in 
many ways. Particularly, we are mak-
ing regular progress to lower prescrip-
tion drug prices as we work to refine 
the agreement. 
The 
framework 
will 
also 
make 
healthcare more affordable, cut taxes 
for working and middle-class Ameri-
cans, and most importantly, provide 
long-sought ladders for families to 
climb up to the middle class and give 
them the stability needed to stay in 
the middle class once they get there. 
It will lower costs for people in many 
different ways—one of our main goals. 
This will be just what the American 
people need, and it will not be—will not 
be—inflationary. 
So the announcement last week from 
the President brought us one step clos-
er toward our goal of delivering help to 
the American people at every stage of 
their lives. We are going to keep work-
ing this week to get this legislation 
over the finish line. Democrats are 
committed to rewarding the trust that 
the American people have placed in us. 
f 
NOMINATIONS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Now, Madam Presi-
dent, on judges and nominations, last 
week, the Senate confirmed seven— 
seven—more judges to serve lifetime 
appointments on the Federal bench. 
Just about all of them were people of 
color; all but two were women. Among 
them were more Federal defenders, 
civil rights lawyers, election experts. 
They will bring sorely needed diversity 
to the judiciary—not just personal di-
versity or demographic diversity, as 
important as that is, but professional 
diversity as well, adding to the breadth 
and width and depth of knowledge pos-
sessed by the courts. 
It is no longer a bench that we are 
appointing that is simply prosecutors 
or partners in large law firms, but 
many, many others from walks of life 
with different and needed perspectives 
on the Federal bench. 
Today, we are going to pick up right 
where we left off. Later this afternoon, 
we will vote to confirm Beth Robinson, 
of Vermont, to serve on the U.S. Court 
of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and 
Toby Heytens to serve on the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the Fourth Cir-
cuit. 
A former clerk to the late Justice 
Ginsburg, Mr. Heytens is a veteran of 
the Justice Department and is the cur-
rent Solicitor General of the Common-
wealth of Virginia. He is regarded by 
both sides of the aisle as a superbly 
skilled lawyer and an impartial think-
er. 
In Justice Robinson, who has spent 10 
distinguished years on the Vermont 
State Supreme Court, the Senate is 
presented with another experienced, 
dedicated, and historic nominee. She 
would be the very first openly gay 
woman to serve not just in the Second 
Circuit, but in any Federal circuit 
court in the country—another barrier 
torn down in the halls of justice. We 
are proud of tearing down those bar-
riers and making the bench more inclu-
sive and more like America. I look for-
ward to her confirmation today. 
In the weeks and months to come, 
Senate Democrats will continue press-
ing ahead to bring balance back to our

JOHN R. LEWIS VOTING RIGHTS 
ADVANCEMENT ACT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Now, Madam Presi-
dent, on the John R. Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act and cloture, 
the fight to protect our democracy 
from voter suppression and election 
subversion continues in the U.S. Sen-
ate. Later this evening, I will file clo-
ture on the motion to proceed to the 
John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advance-
ment Act, setting up a vote to take 
place on Wednesday. 
This bill, which my friends, Senators 
LEAHY and DURBIN, worked assiduously 
to put together, will restore the key 
protections of the Voting Rights Act— 
the crowning achievement of the civil 
rights era—that were wrongly gutted 
in one of the worst decisions the Su-
preme Court has made in a long time— 
in 2013, the Shelby decision—done by a 
conservative majority on the Court. 
Specifically, the John R. Lewis Vot-
ing Rights Advancement Act would up-
date the preclearance protections that 
prohibited States with records of voter 
suppression from making changes to 
election law without Federal approval. 
Recent 
history 
makes 
absolutely 
clear that we need these protections on 
the books. Thanks to the Shelby deci-
sion, we now live in an era of increased 
voter suppression in the United States. 
After that decision, States like Texas 
and North Carolina, sadly, sprang into 
action to make it harder for minority, 
younger, and lower income people to 
vote. Many more States followed years 
later, and we are suffering the con-
sequences of that decision to this day. 
Few of the Justices had thought, I 
believe, that we didn’t need these 
preclearances because there is no more 
voter discrimination. Lord, were they 
wrong. We must reverse their awful 
Shelby decision. 
If there is anything that merits de-
bate here in the Senate, it is protecting 
the precious right of Americans to par-
ticipate in our elections. Since its 
original passage, the Voting Rights Act 
has 
been 
updated 
five 
times—five 
times—with support from both Demo-
crats and Republicans. We should, like-
wise, proceed this time around on this 
time-honored measure. 
I want to make clear: If the Senate 
votes to proceed on to the John R. 
Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, 
I am prepared to offer a full-fledged de-
bate befitting this great Chamber. Re-
publicans will be given the chance to 
raise their objections, to offer amend-
ments, and to make changes to the bill. 
I know that both parties have serious 
disagreements on this important issue, 
so we want to hear from the other side 
what they propose. But for that to hap-
pen, we need to start debate first; we 
need to vote to allow the Senate to 
work through its process; we need 60 
votes simply to say we will debate this 
issue. We will get a chance to see what 
happens this week. 
Time is really getting short for the 
Senate to take action on voting rights 
before Americans go to the polls in the 
2022 elections. It is essential that we 
restore preclearance protections before 
the start of next year, when States are 
set to consider another round of re-
strictive voting rights laws when their 
legislative sessions start in the spring. 
Indeed, the dangerous and draconian 
Republican laws we have seen in 2021 
are only the beginning if this body 
doesn’t take action, and they are a 
very serious threat to our democracy— 
one of the greatest threats to democ-
racy that has come around in a long 
time. 
So I hope both parties will proceed on 
legislation that has long enjoyed bipar-
tisan support in this Chamber. Our de-
mocracy demands we act. 
I yield the floor.

BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
well, the American people are hurting. 
Inflation 
just 
hit 
another 
30-year 
record high. Families are paying sky-
rocketing prices for everyday needs. 
The murder rate across the country 
just recorded its biggest jump ever. 
But here is what the Biden adminis-
tration has focused on: handing out 
six-figure and seven-figure payments to 
illegal immigrants. 
A few years back, liberal interest 
groups started trying to sue the U.S. 
Government on behalf of illegal immi-
grants. They wanted American tax-
payers to pay out legal damages be-
cause of the conditions some people 
faced as they tried to break into our 
country illegally. 
As a legal matter, these lawsuits 
were borderline frivolous. Our govern-
ment was all but certain to win the 
suits, but this administration wants to 
stand down and voluntarily pay out 
massive damages: ‘‘The U.S. Depart-
ments of Justice, Homeland Security, 
and Health and Human Services are 
considering 
payments 
that 
could 
amount to close to $1 million a fam-
ily’’—$1 million a family, about a half 
a million dollars per adult, and about a 
half a million dollars more per child. 
American families are having to anx-
iously budget for gas and groceries, but

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7525 
November 1, 2021 
President Biden wants to literally 
make millionaires out of people who 
have violated Federal law. 
What could be more unfair and un-
just to law-abiding, tax-paying Amer-
ican citizens? 
And talk about yet another massive 
incentive for more and more people to 
come 
here 
illegally: 
On 
President 
Biden’s watch, we have already seen an 
alltime high in illegal border crossings, 
combined with a decade low in arrests 
in the interior. 
So Democrats have already created a 
major border crisis, and now they want 
to cut seven-figure checks to illegal 
border crossers? 
Democrats are already trying to send 
monthly welfare payments to people 
who are here illegally. That is in the 
reckless 
taxing-and-spending 
spree 
they are putting together behind closed 
doors. 
But who needs $300 a month when 
President Biden wants to send these 
folks $450,000 per person? 
That is four and a half times the pay-
ment that the Department of Defense 
sends to the survivors of servicemem-
bers who were killed in action. Fallen 
troops’ families get $100,000 from the 
Pentagon. But the Biden administra-
tion wants to give illegal immigrants 
$450,000? 
This is an especially extreme exam-
ple of a big error that Democrats con-
tinue to make over and over again. 
The left mistakenly thinks that a 
compassionate border means a weak 
border. They think compassion re-
quires weakness—weak security, weak 
enforcement, weak on upholding the 
rule of law. And now, apparently, we 
are a cruel country unless we hand out 
a million dollars per family to illegal 
immigrants who sue America. 
But the entire concept is dead wrong. 
It is not compassion to lure people 
from all over the world through dan-
gerous journeys with the promise of 
open-borders socialism. In fact, the 
government paying out six-figure sums 
that multiply with every additional 
child in tow will only incentivize the 
riskiest and most dangerous kinds of 
illegal immigration. We will be guaran-
teeing that even more children are 
dragged along the dangerous journey. 
Honestly, this absurd idea feels like a 
satirical policy proposal that Repub-
licans would have invented to make a 
parody out of the radical left. Oh, and 
the next thing you know, they will be 
sending out million-dollar checks to il-
legal immigrants. But this is literally 
what the Biden administration wants 
to do, according to reports that they 
have not denied. 
Out in the real world, American fam-
ilies already have enough reasons to 
worry 
about 
the 
administration’s 
spending habits. The inflation kicked 
off by Democrats’ springtime binge has 
wiped out wage gains and made family 
budgets even harder to square. 
One recent report on soaring food 
prices included this quote from a shop-
per out in Indiana: ‘‘You have to pick 
and choose. Before, you didn’t have to 
do that. You could just go in and buy a 
week or two’s worth of food. Now, I can 
barely buy one week’s worth.’’ 
That is a sobering reality that too 
many Americans are dealing with, and 
it isn’t limited to the grocery store. 
Folks in my hometown of Louisville 
have seen gas prices jump a full dollar 
in the past year. Feeding a family is 
getting harder. Filling up the tank is 
getting harder. Even heating a home 
this winter is shaping up to be 30 per-
cent more expensive than last year. 
Even during a time of calm and pros-
perity, writing million-dollar checks to 
illegal immigrants would be an insult 
to American families, but it is 10 times 
more insulting at a time like this, 
when Democrats’ policies are forcing so 
many households to tighten their belts. 
These are the same Democrats who 
are putting finishing touches on yet 
another multimillion dollar—multitril-
lion dollar reckless taxing-and-spend-
ing spree. So in the days and weeks 
ahead, when the far left tries to sell 
America on historic inflationary spend-
ing, historic tax hikes, and more 
micromanaging of American life by 
politicians, just remember, these are 
the same politicians who have proposed 
giving millions of dollars of taxpayers’ 
money to people who broke Federal law 
to enter our country. 
The same people who think that is a 
great idea want license to transform 
our entire economy. 
Look around. I am not sure how 
much more of this transformation 
American families can stomach.

NOMINATION OF TOBY J. HEYTENS 
Mr. 
DURBIN. 
Madam 
President, 
today, the Senate will vote to confirm 
Toby Heytens to serve on the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the Fourth Cir-
cuit. 
He is an accomplished appellate ad-
vocate, with a depth of experience and 
a fair-mindedness that would make 
him an asset to the Fourth Circuit. He 
started as a clerk on the Third Circuit, 
completed a prestigious fellowship at 
the Justice Department’s Office of the 
Solicitor General, and then he clerked 
for Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Not a bad re-
sume. 
After a few years in private practice, 
Mr. Heytens rejoined the Justice De-
partment as an assistant to the Solic-
itor General. Most recently, he was So-
licitor General for the Commonwealth 
of Virginia. 
He is a distinguished academic— 
taught at Cornell Law School, joined 
the faculty at UVA Law School, co-
directed the Supreme Court Litigation 
Clinic. 
Mr. Heytens has personally argued 10 
cases before the U.S. Supreme Court— 
there aren’t many people who can say 
that—and handled the briefing in more 
than 50 other cases before the Court, 
and the breadth of these cases is im-
pressive. 
With such credentials, it is not sur-
prising he enjoys the strong support of 
Senators KAINE and WARNER. 
He has been unanimously rated ‘‘well 
qualified’’ by the American Bar Asso-
ciation, and his nomination is sup-
ported by leaders in the legal commu-
nity, including three former Repub-
lican Solicitors General under Presi-
dent George W. Bush. 
He is a dedicated public servant. I 
will be voting for him, and I hope my 
colleagues will join me. 
COVID–19 
Madam President, on another mat-
ter, this weekend saw the happy return 
of a tradition in many neighborhoods. 
Last night, my senatorial assignment 
was to be at the front door of my home 
in Springfield, IL, and pass out candy 
to the trick-or-treaters. 
After a year off because of COVID, 
Halloween was back. We had at least 
80, maybe 100, kids show up, and they 
were all having a great time, as we all 
remember our own youth. 
What a difference vaccines can make. 
Slowly but surely, we are putting this 
pandemic behind us. And after a dif-
ficult year-plus of remote learning, 
kids are going back to school across 
America. 
Three days ago, we received some 
long-awaited news that will enable par-
ents to breathe another sigh of relief 
and allow children to be safely vac-
cinated. The FDA authorized Pfizer 
vaccinations for kids between ages 5 
and 11. 
While it is true that healthy children 
generally are at lower risk from this 
virus, they are not immune, and test-
ing had to take place, and it has taken 
place. The new lower-dose COVID vac-
cine 
can 
protect 
our 
kids—and 
grandkids, I might add. And I want to 
do everything I can to make sure that 
happens. 
I usually tell the story, which dates 
me, but I know the reality of my im-
pression on those who are watching. I 
have been around a few years, and I re-
member in the 1950s, when we were 
scared to death of polio, and along 
came Jonas Salk—God bless his mem-
ory—with a new vaccine, and we all 
lined up, rolled up our sleeves, and got

November 1, 2021 
a shot, and there wasn’t a question 
asked. 
We saw the ravages of polio—the iron 
lungs, the crippled children, and some 
who lost their lives—and we did what 
we should do: we followed our parents’ 
guidance, got the vaccinations. We vir-
tually eliminated polio in America as a 
result of it. 
We have got to do the same thing, 
when it comes to COVID, for children. 
The new COVID vaccine for young 
children is just the latest proof that 
President Biden’s leadership and ef-
forts are working. 
Not one Republican, I might add, not 
one, could see their way to vote for 
President Biden’s American Rescue 
Plan. It was that same rescue plan 
which set up the program across Amer-
ica to administer vaccines. 
Where would we be today if we were 
still struggling to do that? 
I want to thank the Biden adminis-
tration for that leadership. We are 
starting to see good results, despite the 
Delta variant. And I think that we can 
see at least the possibility of putting 
this pandemic behind us. But I hope 
more people will get vaccinated so that 
that will happen sooner rather than 
later. 
Every week—and I have noticed— 
some of our Republican colleagues, in-
cluding their leader, come to this floor 
to propose undercutting commonsense 
vaccine policies that exist to protect 
our Nation. These Senators, to my 
knowledge, have all been vaccinated; 
yet, when it comes to the mistruths 
and distortions about vaccinations, 
they are strangely silent. I think we 
know why. 
Apparently, they think pitting Amer-
icans against each other is good poli-
tics, but it may be good politics one 
day and bad public health for a long 
time. It is corrosive to our public spir-
it. America is strongest when we are 
united. 
We will no doubt hear our Republican 
colleagues cheer on the small minority 
of police and firefighters in cities like 
New York and Chicago, who continue 
to refuse to get vaccinated, despite 
mandates. 
Here is a number that we should keep 
in mind, those of us who say, and I 
count myself as one, that we respect 
law enforcement and want them to be 
strong and safe—last year, five times 
more law enforcement officers died of 
COVID than died of gun violence. 
Let me repeat that. Last year, five 
times more policemen died of COVID 
than died from gun violence. 
COVID is the No. 1 killer of law en-
forcement officers in America today. 
And so when we talk about being on 
the side of the police, and you want to 
save their lives—I sure do. I want them 
to be safe on the job, but I also want 
them to be vaccinated so that they 
don’t succumb to the illnesses that fol-
low when they are not. 
If you care about police safety—if 
you really care about police safety, put 
this pandemic behind us once and for 
all and get vaccinated, and speak up 
when people decide, on FOX TV and 
others, to peddle this anti-vax quack-
ery that we see too often. 
THE ECONOMY 
Madam President, on a related mat-
ter, when I listen to our Republican 
colleagues’ rail on the economy, I am 
reminded of the old saying, attributed 
to H.L. Mencken, that: ‘‘For every 
complex problem, there is an answer 
that is simply easy—and wrong.’’ 
Four years ago, Republicans used the 
Senate’s reconciliation rules to pass 
the Trump tax cuts. They didn’t get a 
single Democratic vote. 
Why? Because those tax cuts bene-
fited the wealthiest people in America 
and the most profitable corporations. 
So did it cost us anything? Did we 
make money on that as a nation? 
It cost us $1.9 trillion over 10 years. 
That was Republican reconciliation 4 
years ago. That is more than President 
Biden is now proposing for his entire 
slate of programs to ease the financial 
squeeze on working families and create 
millions of good jobs and protect our 
Nation from the dangers of climate 
change. 
All the wailing and gnashing of teeth 
we are hearing from Republicans about 
deficits and debt? Where in the heck 
were they during the Trump years, 
when the debt went up 36 percent? 
They were all voting for it. 
Of course, now that President Biden 
is onboard, they are really deficit 
hawks. They have changed overnight. 
Well, you should have heard them dur-
ing the Trump years, if they are sin-
cere and honest. 
Our Republican colleagues moan on 
and on about inflation. All Americans 
are concerned about that. The Senator 
from Kentucky pointed out the reality. 
I filled my truck up with gas over the 
weekend. It is more expensive. 
What is causing all that? 
Well, part of it is we have no control 
over the price. The OPEC nations and 
others are determining what the price 
levels will be. And other things are 
part of it as well, yes. 
Heating bills are going to go up this 
winter. When I talk to the people in 
the natural gas industry, they talk 
about the problems that they had. 
When the economy slumped during the 
pandemic, the production of natural 
gas went down, the storage of it went 
down, the price went up, and that is 
what we are paying for today. 
So the pandemic itself has had an im-
pact on our economy, which we cannot 
and should not ignore. 
The pandemic closed down the global 
economy and sent demand for many 
products soaring. Getting back to nor-
mal is just going to take some time, 
and it will take thoughtful action, not 
political potshots. 
To our Republican friends: If you are 
really concerned about the economic 
strain on middle-class and working 
families, you have got an opportunity 
to prove it this week. 
President Biden’s Build Back Better 
agenda is moving forward. A vote to 
give 35 million families enhanced child 
tax credits will help them meet the 
cost of living and save them hundreds, 
maybe thousands, of dollars a year. 
A vote for good, free, early childhood 
education for every kid in America will 
put hundreds, even thousands of dollars 
more back in the hands of parents. 
And unlike the Trump tax cuts, the 
Build Back Better agenda is paid for. 
That is right. We pay for it. We are not 
adding to the deficit, and no one earn-
ing less than $400,000 a year will face 
higher taxes to pay for the Build Back 
Better agenda. 
And then there is the issue of climate 
change. I am joining a group that 
hopes we can go to Glasgow, Scotland, 
for this climate conference the Presi-
dent is attending today, and we hope 
that a bipartisan group delegation 
from the Senate can go at the end of 
this week, and I am looking forward to 
that possibility. 
We are paying so much money out, 
almost on a weekly basis, for weather- 
related disasters. Hurricane Ida, this 
year, cost us $100 billion in damage. 
One storm cost roughly twice as much 
as we proposed to spend the whole year 
in reducing the harm of climate change 
for all America. 
We need to work together to create a 
win for the American people and for 
our planet, and wouldn’t it be nice if it 
were bipartisan for a change? 
IMMIGRATION 
Madam President, let me say a word 
about Senator MCCONNELL’s comments. 
I sit here and wonder: What can he say 
next? 
Well, today, he took the cake. Appar-
ently, he was suggesting that we have 
a plan to give every undocumented per-
son in America—was it a million dol-
lars or a half a million dollars? 
It is laughable to hear that kind of 
suggestion. 
Remember when the caravans were 
bringing thousands and thousands and 
it didn’t happen? 
Now, there is some notion by the 
Senator from Kentucky that Joe Biden 
has a plan to give every undocumented 
person a million dollars. I mean, you 
would say to yourself: Did you keep a 
straight face when you said that? Ap-
parently, he did. And I will just tell 
you that the plans I have been sup-
porting would put these people to work 
in America, paying taxes—paying their 
fair share of taxes, and that is impor-
tant if we want to get this economy 
straight and get the workers we need 
back on the job. 
So I would suggest to the Senator 
from Kentucky, a million dollars for an 
undocumented person in America? I 
think you have gone a little bit beyond 
the pale with that comment. 
I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7527 
November 1, 2021 
devastating cyber attacks conducted 
on our national agricultural sector. 
Agriculture is designated as one of 
the country’s 16 critical infrastructure 
industries but historically has not re-
ceived robust cyber security support 
from our government. Attacks from 
foreign cyber criminals are threatening 
both the livelihood of our farmers and 
the security of the food that we eat. 
Last month, NEW Cooperative, an 
Iowa grain co-op, was the target of 
BlackMatter, a Russian cyber criminal 
cell. The cyber attack shut down sys-
tems that control crop irrigation, live-
stock feed schedules, and inventory 
distribution. NEW Cooperative com-
prises about 40 percent of the grain dis-
tribution in our country. The co-op 
narrowly managed to avert a crash in 
grain prices without paying a $5.9 mil-
lion ransom. 
These attacks are not limited to just 
large distributors. The Russian group 
BlackByte claimed it attacked Farm-
ers Cooperative Elevator Company, an 
Iowa grain co-op with just four loca-
tions. BlackByte is threatening to re-
lease 100 gigabytes of sensitive data, 
including financial, sales, and account-
ing information, if a ransom is not 
paid. 
The extent of the damage from the 
NEW Cooperative and the Farmers Co-
operative Elevator Company attacks is 
not isolated to the grain market. Feed 
from these co-ops sustain more than 11 
million head of livestock. 
These attacks affect the supply chain 
that puts food on the shelves of grocery 
stores all across our country. As Iowa 
farmers adopt new technologies to get 
their crops to market, their exposure 
grows to similar attacks. 
These two ransomware attacks are 
only the latest in a very long line of 
cyber attacks on our critical infra-
structure this year. In July, a Miami- 
based software provider was attacked, 
which resulted in trickle-down effects 
to thousands of organizations. In June, 
JBS Foods—that happens to be the 
world’s largest meat processing com-
pany—that 
company 
was 
attacked, 
shutting 
down 
nine 
meat 
packing 
plants in the United States. In May, 
Colonial Pipeline was shut down for 11 
days, resulting in buying panics and 
shortages. 
While many cyber attacks originate 
from Russia, attacks have also come 
from other countries. Earlier this year, 
the 
Biden 
administration 
formally 
blamed China for a massive hack of the 
Microsoft Exchange email server. The 
hackers responsible appeared to work 
directly for China’s Ministry of State 
Security. Estimates range as high as 
250,000 victims in that attack. 
In July, the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee, where I serve as ranking mem-
ber, held a hearing at my request look-
ing at how to prevent and respond to 
ransomware attacks. During this hear-
ing, witnesses testified that the De-
partment of Homeland Security would 
be identifying and hardening critical 
points of failure. However, it is clear 
that their actions up to now have not 
deterred criminals from targeting the 
U.S. agricultural industry. 
Now, farmers might be only 2 percent 
of the U.S. population, but they pro-
vide food for the other 98 percent. 
Their job—the 2 percent of the people 
in this country—is no small task. 
Keeping Americans fed is very impor-
tant. 
There is an old quote that goes some-
thing like this: ‘‘There are only nine 
meals between mankind and anarchy.’’ 
The quote is key to understanding the 
importance of keeping our agricultural 
supply chain safe and secure. 
I want to thank my colleague Sen-
ator ERNST for joining me today in 
calling attention to this ongoing na-
tional security concern because agri-
cultural security is national security. 
It is time that we do more to protect 
this critical sector of agriculture. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HICKENLOOPER). 
The 
Senator 
from 
Iowa. 
Ms. ERNST. Thank you, Mr. Presi-
dent. I also want to thank my senior 
Senator from our great State of Iowa 
for his wonderful contributions to our 
agriculture sector. This is an ex-
tremely important topic that we are 
bringing to the floor today, the threat 
of agriculture ransomware. 
From grocery stores in Iowa to New 
York and every State in between, it is 
no secret that the price of groceries 
has drastically increased over the 
course of the past year. Combining 
that with the ongoing supply chain dis-
aster, it is even more apparent that the 
last thing we need is a cyber security 
attack that would shut down any of 
our agriculture production. 
Like many Iowans, I am increasingly 
concerned 
about 
the 
growing 
ransomware attacks on our Nation’s ag 
economy. In a 2019 report, researchers 
from the University of Minnesota out-
lined the seriousness of the risk of 
cyber attacks to the American food 
and agriculture system. The report in-
dicated that American agriculture is 
extremely vulnerable due to outdated 
security, 
poor 
coordination 
among 
businesses, and lack of emphasis on 
cyber security within the industry. 
In June, the world’s largest meat 
processing company, JBS, was at-
tacked by a Russian-based operation. 
Nine U.S.-based meat packing plants 
temporarily shut down as a result of 
that attack, including the JBS pork 
processing plants in Marshalltown and 
Ottumwa, IA. 
Similarly, NEW Cooperative, an Iowa 
grain cooperative that controls 40 per-
cent of the grain distribution in our 
country, was recently targeted with a 
cyber attack by another Russian cyber 
crime. They attacked controlled crop 
irrigation, livestock feed schedules, 
and inventory distribution, and then 
they demanded $5.9 million in ransom. 
Another attack hit Farmers Coopera-
tive Elevator Company, based in Arca-
dia, IA. This was coordinated by an-
other Russian attacker, who threat-
ened to release sensitive data, includ-
ing financial, sales, and accounting in-
formation. 
This is a very serious warning sign 
for our ag industry. It is a problem 
primed to increase as farmers incor-
porate more technology into their 
daily lives. Precision agriculture, for 
example, has promising potential to 
fulfill increasing global food supply 
and demand while also improving our 
soil and water quality, but it demands 
heavy reliance on interconnected de-
vices and the internet, creating vulner-
ability. Attackers can exploit these 
vulnerabilities to remotely control and 
disrupt data flow, potentially causing 
devastating consequences, especially as 
farmers move their crops and their 
livestock to market. 
These attacks risk the livelihood of 
farmers and affect the supply chain 
that puts food on the shelves and on 
our families’ tables all across our coun-
try. That is why I believe 21st-century 
farming needs 21st-century solutions. 
The security, safety, and resiliency of 
our food supply chain is integral to the 
overall security of our Nation. 
The ag sector is designated as crit-
ical infrastructure, but historically, it 
has not received robust cyber security 
support from the government. 
Just 
recently, 
I 
joined 
Senator 
GRASSLEY
in 
urging 
Secretary 
Mayorkas to address these ransomware 
attacks on agriculture and to leverage 
the Department’s resources to prepare 
for any future attacks. The Biden ad-
ministration outlined a new national 
security memorandum that would in-
clude cyber security as it relates to ag-
riculture, but the plan is voluntary and 
would severely limit its effectiveness. 
It is why I joined Senators GRASSLEY, 
STABENOW, and TESTER in an effort to 
get both the Secretary of Agriculture 
and 
the 
Secretary 
of 
Health 
and 
Human Services, who oversees the 
Food and Drug Administration, perma-
nent representation on the Committee 
on Foreign Investment in the United 
States. 
The legislation also adds new criteria 
to ensure that proposed transactions 
are reviewed specifically for their po-
tential impact on American food and 
agricultural systems. The increasing 
trend of foreign investment in our food 
and ag system should be met with care-
ful scrutiny in order to safeguard the 
security and safety of our food supply 
and, by extension, our Nation because, 
after all, food security is national secu-
rity. 
Again, I thank my senior Senator 
CHUCK GRASSLEY for leading these ef-
forts to protect our agriculture indus-
try, the livelihoods of Iowans, and ev-
eryone else who puts food on their 
table. 
I yield the floor.

November 1, 2021 
very extraordinary. He said he would 
not withdraw his memo in which he in-
structed the FBI to get involved with 
local school boards. 
Why would the FBI be interested in 
parents’ meetings with their school 
board? If there is a reason for law en-
forcement to be involved, it is probably 
something local law enforcement can 
handle. 
So the direction will have the effect 
of intimidating parents who speak out 
about their children’s education. And 
make no mistake about it, we have 
heard those reports from the parents 
themselves. 
The 
Attorney 
General 
should then withdraw the memo. 
Here are the facts: 
No. 1, on September 29, the National 
School Boards Association sent a letter 
to President Biden asking for help from 
Federal law enforcement against con-
cerned parents who are getting in-
volved at local school board meetings. 
That letter compared parents to do-
mestic terrorists. It even suggested the 
PATRIOT Act should be used against 
them. Now, remember, the PATRIOT 
Act was passed 20 years ago, written to 
protect Americans against terrorists. 
Point No. 2: On October 4, Attorney 
General Garland put out a memo tell-
ing the FBI and other parts of the De-
partment of Justice to work with local 
governments on the supposed spike in 
harassment, intimidation, and threat 
of violence against local school boards. 
The National Security Division is in-
cluded as well, apparently because they 
deal with domestic terrorists and the 
PATRIOT Act. 
Attorney General Garland has since 
testified that he gave the Department 
of Justice this instruction because of 
what he read in the National School 
Boards Association letter to President 
Biden just 5 days earlier of when the 
memo was issued. This is an extraor-
dinary deployment of Federal law en-
forcement in local issues when we have 
problems—very big problems—like a 
historic murder surge and especially an 
open southern border. That latter, the 
southern border, you see the chaos and 
the crisis every day on television. 
From these two points, what have we 
learned since the memo was put out? 
First, we learned the White House 
helped write the original letter from 
the National School Boards Associa-
tion sent to the White House, not to 
the Department of Justice. Next, we 
learned that the State school board as-
sociations, affiliated with the national 
association, had nothing to do with 
putting together the letter. Over 20 of 
these State organizations have publicly 
disavowed the National School Boards 
Association’s letter that brought about 
this directive. 
Now, think about that. The White 
House helped write a letter to itself 
comparing parents who love their kids 
to domestic terrorists, but the actual 
members of the National School Boards 
Association had nothing to do with it. 
On October 22, the National School 
Boards Association actually apologized 
for its original letter that started this 
whole mess in the first place and was 
never even authorized by its own 
board. 
Meanwhile, 17 State attorneys gen-
eral have written to Attorney General 
Garland saying there has been no spike 
in violence against local school boards. 
So the idea that parents pose any sort 
of Federal threat to local school boards 
is all just simply made up by what 
looks to be the White House for polit-
ical purposes. 
Despite all that, the Attorney Gen-
eral says he will not change one thing 
about his memo telling the Depart-
ment of Justice to continue focusing 
on local school boards. That memo 
stands, as far as the Attorney General 
is concerned. 
Attorney General Garland says that 
he doesn’t see how it could be inter-
preted to mean the FBI will go after 
impassioned parents. He says there are 
lines in constitutional law that law en-
forcement can’t cross. Well, that is 
true, but he has been working with the 
Constitution his entire life. However, 
most parents and most school board 
members aren’t experts on the First 
Amendment. 
These parents are reading the Attor-
ney General’s own words to mean that 
when they speak passionately at local 
school board meetings, they could get 
in trouble with Federal officials. So 
parents are going to stop speaking up 
at local school board meetings, and 
that is what is known as a chilling ef-
fect. 
That might be what some at the 
White House or the National School 
Boards Association wanted all along, 
but it is a horrible thing for our democ-
racy, and it should never happen in the 
United States of America. 
Attorney General Garland has said 
he wants to depoliticize the Depart-
ment of Justice. Now, he wants Federal 
prosecutors parsing what parents say 
to their local school board members. 
This is because he thinks there is a dis-
turbing spike in violence by parents, 
but he is not actually sure if that is 
right. And this instruction is going to 
scare parents out of speaking their 
minds at local school board meetings. 
But the Attorney General won’t change 
his instructions to the FBI. 
Mr. Attorney General, parents are 
not domestic terrorists, and you have 
only one reasonable choice: Withdraw 
this memo and focus on the real 
threats and dangers that American 
citizens face. Stop being a pawn for the 
White House by politicizing the De-
partment of Justice. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
NOMINATION OF BETH ROBINSON 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Sen-
ate today is going to vote on the con-
firmation of Vermont’s own Justice 
Beth Robinson, a vote to confirm her 
to serve as a judge on the Second Cir-
cuit Court of Appeals. 
As an advocate, Beth Robinson has 
been rightfully hailed as a tireless 
champion for equal rights and equal 
justice, but more importantly, her 
record as a Vermont Supreme Court 
justice clearly demonstrates her fair-
ness, her impartiality, and loyalty to 
the rule of law above all else. 
We Vermonters overwhelmingly sup-
port her nomination, including elected 
officials—both Republicans and Demo-
crats—the entire Vermont Supreme 
Court, and the Vermont Bar Associa-
tion; they overwhelmingly support her. 
Justice Robinson will fill Vermont’s 
seat on the Second Circuit, and I be-
lieve she is the best, strongest can-
didate for this position. She deserves 
bipartisan support in this Senate, as 
she got last week on a vote. 
Beth Robinson was appointed to the 
Vermont Supreme Court by Governor 
Peter Shumlin in November 2011. To 
give you some idea of the bipartisan 
support she has had over the years, the 
Vermont 
Senate, 
Republicans 
and 
Democrats, have to vote on her nomi-
nation, and they voted unanimously to 
have her on the Vermont Supreme 
Court. 
All current Vermont Supreme Court 
justices, appointed by both Democratic 
and Republican Governors, have signed 
a letter supporting her nomination to 
the Second Circuit. For the past dec-
ade, she has served on the court honor-
ably. She has also participated in near-
ly 1,800 decisions. 
Now, I am a member of the Vermont 
bar, and I pay attention to what hap-
pens, and I see her tenure as being a 
display of a commitment to the rule of 
law. Her unwavering, decade-long dedi-
cation as a jurist and her loyalty to 
the law above all else has made Beth 
Robinson an outstanding Vermont Su-
preme Court justice. No Vermonter 
doubts she will carry that approach to 
justice with her in the Second Circuit. 
Let me talk a little bit about before 
she was on the bench. Prior to the time 
on the bench, Justice Robinson dedi-
cated her legal career to pursuing lib-
erty and justice for all. She spent the 
beginning of her legal career defending 
workers’ rights and advancing dis-
crimination cases. It was during this 
time that she worked pro bono as co-
counsel to the plaintiffs in the case 
Baker 
v. 
State 
that 
challenged 
Vermont’s then-protection on same-sex 
marriage. 
She successfully litigated this land-
mark decision in which the Vermont 
Supreme Court upheld equal protec-
tions for same-sex couples and actually 
led Vermont to become the first State 
in the Union to enact civil unions in 
the country. 
As a litigator, her work served as a 
blueprint for LGBTQ advocacy across 
the country. She successfully rep-
resented an employee at the University 
of Vermont, who sought recognition of 
his Canadian marriage to a same-sex 
partner for health insurance purposes; 
another, a couple seeking recognition 
of their out-of-State marriage in the 
context of second-parent adoption; and

a same-sex partner seeking Social Se-
curity survivor benefits for her child 
after her civil union partner died. 
In every case, she fought to secure 
legal protections and equality under 
the law. In fact, Beth changed the tra-
jectory of LGBTQ rights in this coun-
try. Her tireless work has led our Na-
tion toward justice. 
Unfortunately, in what is becoming 
more and more of a toxic atmosphere, 
Justice Robinson’s path to confirma-
tion has faced baseless attacks. At her 
confirmation hearing, Justice Robin-
son’s commitment to religious liberty 
was called into question. Now, these 
attacks are simply not grounded in re-
ality. Any honest reading of her record 
proves that Justice Robinson is com-
mitted to protecting religious liberty. 
Some members argued that Robinson’s 
work representing a Catholic woman 
who believed she had been discrimi-
nated against due to her own religious 
beliefs was, astonishingly, evidence of 
Robinson’s hostility toward religious 
liberty. 
At Justice Robinson’s hearing, other 
members of the Judiciary Committee 
quoted her out of context in what I saw 
as an attempt to support a false nar-
rative. One member of the committee 
read part of a sentence from a marriage 
law symposium that Justice Robinson 
participated in and suggested that it 
was proof of her hostility toward reli-
gious liberty. 
I said ‘‘read part of’’ it, but the at-
tack line falls apart the moment you 
bother to read the full sentence. In the 
full quote, Justice Robinson states: 
I’ve always said that if somebody tried to 
force the Catholic Church to do a gay wed-
ding, I would represent the Church pro bono. 
You can’t construe that as hostility 
to religious freedom. 
Justice Robinson has a long record of 
supporting the fundamental right to 
religious liberty, both as a judge and as 
an advocate. 
The Vermonters I have heard from— 
regardless of party or ideology, regard-
less of their religion—are delighted 
that President Biden nominated Beth 
Robinson to fill the Vermont seat on 
the Second Circuit. Our leading Repub-
licans, our leading Democrats agree 
with that. 
If confirmed, she knows she will be-
come the first openly gay woman to 
serve on a Federal circuit court of ap-
peals. 
I would urge all Senators to evaluate 
Justice Robinson’s record. And I hope 
that Senators of both parties will see, 
as I have, that she possesses exactly 
the right qualities, skills, and experi-
ence to excel as a judge on the Second 
Circuit. 
Before I was in the Senate, I had the 
privilege to argue cases before the Sec-
ond Circuit. I saw it as a court where 
you never thought of whether they 
were Republicans or Democrats; you 
thought about their abilities, and I al-
ways felt comfortable arguing there. 
Justice Robinson, when she becomes 
Judge Robinson, will give that same 
view to anybody who is a litigant be-
fore that court. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alabama. 
VETERANS DAY 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Mr. President, in 
1919, President Woodrow Wilson de-
clared November 11 as Armistice Day, 
marking an agreement the year prior 
between the Allied Nations and Ger-
many to temporarily cease fighting 
during World War I. 
President Wilson said: 
The reflections of Armistice Day will be 
filled with solemn pride in the heroism of 
those who died in the country’s service and 
with gratitude for the victory, both because 
of the thing from which it has freed us and 
because of the opportunity it has given 
America to show her sympathy with peace 
and justice in the councils of the nations. 
In battles before World War I and in 
battles since, our servicemembers and 
veterans have served to protect the 
American way of life. Every year, our 
country pauses on November 11 to rec-
ognize our veterans with the solemn 
pride and gratitude that President Wil-
son referenced. 
We all wake up each morning and 
enjoy the freedoms this great country 
affords us because of our veterans—be-
cause it was our veterans, our men and 
women in uniform, who were there 
when their country needed them most. 
While their roles span multiple thea-
ters and decades, our veterans were and 
continue to be united by a common 
mission: to protect and to defend the 
United States of America. This is a 
great responsibility they shouldered, 
and they deserve gratitude equal to 
their great sacrifice. Our veterans may 
say that they are just ordinary Ameri-
cans doing their job. They may be ordi-
nary, but they performed an extraor-
dinary service to our country. 
Alabama is home to nearly 400,000 
veterans, and today it is my honor to 
recognize a few of them for their serv-
ice. I have had the pleasure of meeting 
many veterans from my great State, 
and I am always inspired by their serv-
ice and their sacrifice. 
Their patriotism is unmatched, and 
their courage is unwavering, like that 
of CPL Edsel Bonds of Samson, AL, 
who experienced a shell blast to his 
right femur on January 28, 1966, while 
on a mission to intercept guerillas dur-
ing the Vietnam war. The blast blew 
out 4 inches of his femur bone and sev-
eral muscle groups. He spent most of a 
year recovering in the hospital from 
this horrific injury and never lost the 
love for his country. 
Now, nearly 56 years later from the 
time of his injury, he is just as patri-
otic as ever. He views his service as 
something that was necessary for our 
country to remain the greatest country 
in the world. Corporal Bonds risked life 
and limb because he believed that 
America is worth sacrificing for. 
We enjoy the blessings of living in a 
free nation but often discount the fact 
that our liberties come with a tremen-
dous cost. Many brave men and women 
have paid a price that even our deepest 
gratitude could never, ever repay. 
I think Elmer Davis, the Director of 
the U.S. Office of War Information dur-
ing World War II, said it best: 
This nation will remain the land of the free 
only so long as it is home of the brave. 
One-hundred-year-old 
SGT 
George 
Mills of Decatur, AL, showed great 
bravery during his time serving in 
World War II. The Germans surrounded 
his company 500 yards from the Ger-
man border and launched attacks into 
the building where they were staying, 
setting it on fire. With no ammunition 
left to defend the enemy, Sergeant 
Mills and his fellow comrades were 
forced to surrender. 
For the next 5 months, George Mills 
and his company were marched across 
Europe toward the former Czecho-
slovakia 
without 
food. 
They 
were 
starved and no doubt weary. Yet Ser-
geant Mills and his company per-
severed. They survived by eating scraps 
of sugar beets and rutabagas found in 
barns where they were held captive be-
fore they were finally liberated on 
April 13, 1945. 
During this initial attack, Sergeant 
Mills, despite being injured, sprang to 
action to help save the lives of those in 
his company. He was awarded a Purple 
Heart for his bravery. 
Another American hero is Fred Lacy 
of Auburn, AL. A lieutenant colonel in 
the U.S. Army, Mr. Lacy provided valu-
able leadership and negotiation skills 
during his time in Europe, Korea, and 
Vietnam. He and his brigade helped de-
fend the western half of the Korean de-
militarized zone at the end of the Ko-
rean war, ensuring that there were no 
weaknesses in our defense for North 
Korea to attack. During the Vietnam 
war, he coordinated all U.S. activity in 
the Mekong Delta and assisted the Vi-
etnamese in combating the Vietcong. 
He volunteered in a leprosy orphan-
age in his free time while staying 
there. He was a natural at building re-
lationships and resolving conflicts dur-
ing his time. During a dispute between 
a Vietnamese and an American officer, 
Fred stepped in front of a gun to pre-
vent the American officer from being 
shot. 
He received two Bronze Stars and the 
Combat Infantryman Badge for his 
leadership 
and 
courageous 
efforts. 
When reflecting on his service, he says 
that it was ‘‘a privilege to serve.’’ That 
spirit of service is something he carries 
with him even after his time in the 
military. 
Lieutenant Colonel Lacy has taught 
Bible classes for more than 60 years 
and still teaches today at Auburn 
United Methodist Church. 
We, as citizens of this country, are 
privileged to have veterans like Lieu-
tenant Colonel Lacy who have not only 
honorably fought for our freedom but 
have also proudly carried the torch of 
liberty across the world. They love 
their country, and you don’t have to 
talk with them very long before you

November 1, 2021 
understand how much of a driving force 
it is to them. 
CPL Clyde Haynes from Vestavia 
Hills, AL, served in the Army Air 
Corps’ 439th Troop Carrier Group dur-
ing World War II. Mr. Haynes shared 
the joy of walking with children in 
France as they rushed out of their 
houses and filled the streets to cele-
brate their new liberation from Nazi 
rule. He said that he ‘‘wished he had a 
picture of that.’’ Even though he does 
not have a physical photograph, you 
can tell that he holds that memory 
near and dear to his heart. 
Even though Mr. Haynes is now 100 
years old, he is just as moved by that 
moment now as he was at that time be-
cause freedom is a powerful thing. But 
freedom does not come without cost. 
There are many servicemembers who 
pay the ultimate price for our freedom 
and never return home. There are fami-
lies left behind who sit down to dinner 
every night with an empty seat at the 
table knowing that life for them will 
never be the same. They, too, have 
shouldered the cost of America’s lib-
erty and deserve our gratitude. 
For our servicemembers who do re-
turn home, their struggles do not end 
after they reach American soil. They 
continue to face challenges from what 
they have endured while in service and 
from the difficult reentry into civilian 
life. 
Most of us will never know the full 
weight of preserving our freedom, 
never have to endure sleepless nights 
from the harrowing memories of the 
battlefield, bear pain from war inju-
ries, or miss important events with 
family and friends, like Ryan Charrier 
from Orange Beach, AL, who served as 
a U.S. Air Force technical sergeant in 
the war in Afghanistan, with the 442nd 
Fighter Wing. He received his first de-
ployment when his children were just 8 
and 4 years old. Sergeant Charrier said 
he was a bit older than his fellow fight-
ers. He left behind young children but 
served with soldiers who missed births 
of their first children or deaths of fam-
ily members. 
A veteran’s life is so much more than 
just time in service. There is also the 
reintegration to civilian life, which re-
quires just as much bravery, courage, 
and sacrifice. Sergeant Charrier’s re-
minder to Americans is powerful: 
We as a country promised that we would 
never forget . . . so I hope that every patri-
otic American will keep the promise of never 
forgetting. Just because the war may have 
winded down, doesn’t mean our men and 
women who served the last 20 years still 
don’t need the support of every American. 
These veterans—Edsel Bonds, George 
Mills, Fred Lacy, Clyde Haynes, and 
Ryan Charrier—are heroes, just like 
millions of brave men and women who 
have selfishly sacrificed throughout 
the decades. Their stories should in-
spire all of us to show a greater love 
for our country and our fellow Ameri-
cans. 
Thirty-three years ago on Veterans 
Day in 1988, Ronald Reagan said: 
We remember those who were called upon 
to give all a person can give, and we remem-
ber those who were prepared to make that 
sacrifice if it were demanded of them in the 
line of duty. Most of all, we remember the 
devotion and gallantry with which all of 
them ennobled their nation as they became 
champions of a noble cause. 
May we join together as a nation this 
Veterans Day to honor our veterans 
who have served this Nation and de-
fended our freedom and values that we 
hold so dear. To our veterans, I say: 
Thank you for your sacrifice. Our Na-
tion will be forever indebted to you. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, commu-
nities across our great Nation are deal-
ing with a startling spike in violent 
crime. Last year, the murder rate 
soared by nearly 30 percent, the largest 
single-year jump on record. 
The American people are paying 
close attention, and they are con-
cerned. A poll this summer found that 
nearly 60 percent of Americans are 
worried about crime. The percentage of 
those who say they are extremely con-
cerned is at the highest point in more 
than two decades, and folks largely 
think not enough is being done to ad-
dress this spike. 
A separate poll found that 65 percent 
of Americans are dissatisfied with poli-
cies to reduce or control crime. That is 
up more than 16 percent from 2020. Per-
haps this is an offshoot of the ‘‘defund 
the police’’ movement that we have 
seen in radical circles over the last 
year or so. 
With such a dramatic and shocking 
jump in homicides and violent crime 
and the clear belief that more should 
be done to address it, you would expect 
that the U.S. Department of Justice 
would be in an all-hands-on-deck pos-
ture. After all, this is the highest law 
enforcement agency in the country. 
You would think it would take a lead-
ing role in finding ways to keep our 
country and our communities safe. 
Unfortunately, leaders at the Depart-
ment of Justice in the Biden adminis-
tration believe that they have bigger 
fish to fry. Forget stopping murderers 
and violent criminals. The most force-
ful language we have seen recently 
from the Attorney General hasn’t been 
about stopping dangerous criminals; it 
is about going after concerned parents 
at school board meetings. That is 
right—communities across the country 
are worried about violent crime, and 
the Biden Justice Department is wor-
ried about parents who are concerned 
about what their kids are learning in 
school. 
This all started with a deeply mis-
guided letter from the National School 
Boards 
Association 
about 
heated 
school board meetings across the coun-
try. 
Parents who are concerned about 
things like critical race theory and 
other controversial topics, who are 
simply worried that their kids aren’t 
learning about American history and 
civics and the foundations upon which 
this great country was built, they have 
taken their concerns to school board 
meetings—something they have every 
right; indeed, a constitutional right— 
to do. 
I want to be clear: there is no place 
for violence or threats of violence in 
our public discourse. It doesn’t matter 
who you are or what you are fighting 
for; violence is not the answer. 
But rather than allow State and local 
law enforcement authorities to inter-
vene in those rare circumstances when 
things go off track, the school board 
leaders at the National School Boards 
Association went nuclear. They en-
couraged the Biden administration to 
treat these parents like something 
akin to domestic terrorists. They advo-
cated for unleashing the full arsenal 
and might of the Department of Jus-
tice and the Federal Bureau of Inves-
tigation on concerned parents—con-
cerned parents. And the Attorney Gen-
eral was, apparently, happy to oblige 
their outrageous demands. 
The National School Boards Associa-
tion letter argued that a parent who 
disagrees with the curriculum in their 
children’s school could be investigated 
under the PATRIOT Act. 
You will remember the PATRIOT Act 
was passed after 9/11/2001 to address 
radical extremists who had just killed 
3,000 Americans in attacks at the Pen-
tagon and in New York. 
Unsurprisingly, this letter from the 
National School Boards Association 
was met with fierce and immediate 
blowback. I don’t know how they didn’t 
see it coming. Concerned parents and 
terrorists don’t share anything in com-
mon. 
Well, after the negative press, the 
National School Boards Association 
eventually retracted their letter and 
apologized. They admitted that there 
was ‘‘no justification for some of the 
language included in the letter,’’ but 
the damage had already been done. 
A few days later, after the letter was 
sent, Attorney General Garland de-
cided to get into the game, and he pub-
lished a memo directing Federal law 
enforcement to inject itself into local 
school board elections. 
Well, we had a chance to question At-
torney General Garland last week, 
when he appeared before the Senate Ju-
diciary Committee, and he conceded 
that his decision to send out a memo to 
the Federal law enforcement was based 
almost entirely on the letter from the 
National School Boards Association 
and ‘‘news reports.’’ 
Of course, the Attorney General 
could not cite any specific examples 
that he relied upon before unleashing 
the awesome power of the Federal Gov-
ernment on parents, nor could he pro-
vide any data or evidence that local en-
forcement was incapable of handling 
any incidents that might occur. 
In his memo, the Attorney General 
also encouraged the Federal authori-
ties to take action far beyond any

threats of violence and references to 
intimidation of school officials. 
But you have to ask: What counts as 
intimidation to the Attorney General? 
Is an angry, frustrated parent raising 
their voice at a school board meeting 
intimidation? 
I think not. 
What if one of the parents tells a 
school board member they plan to run 
against them in the next election or 
donate to their opponent in the next 
election; is that intimidation? 
Well, to his credit, the Attorney Gen-
eral did finally concede that parents’ 
right to speak their minds at school 
board meetings are protected by the 
First Amendment to the United States 
Constitution. It is their constitutional 
right. 
But I ask you, put yourself in the 
shoes of a parent who reads about this 
Department of Justice memo—from the 
Attorney 
General, 
no 
less—at 
the 
kitchen table. 
Is it going to have an impact on their 
decision to attend the next school 
board meeting? Will it cause them to 
shy away from advocating for their 
children’s education and speaking up 
about misguided policies that they 
think have no place in their child’s 
school? 
I ask you to consider the chilling ef-
fect that this had, and will continue to 
have, on parents who just want to have 
a say in their children’s education. 
Instead of raising their voices in op-
position to things like critical race 
theory or other radical educational 
policies, parents are more likely to be 
intimidated and to stay at home for 
fear of being labeled domestic terror-
ists by the highest law enforcement of-
ficer in the land. 
They certainly can’t afford to hire a 
lawyer to defend themselves against 
these sorts of charges by the Federal 
Government, were the Federal Govern-
ment to come after them for exercising 
what Attorney General Garland said 
were their First Amendment rights 
under the Constitution. 
In response to the Attorney General’s 
memo, the U.S. attorney from Montana 
sent out a list of Federal statutes that 
could serve as a basis for prosecution. 
He took the Attorney General at his 
word. Among the Federal statutes that 
he thought could serve as a basis for 
prosecution included repeated tele-
phone calls. 
Well, last week, I asked the Attorney 
General if he considered the chilling ef-
fect that his memo might have on par-
ents exercising their constitutional 
rights. He evaded the question. So I 
asked him again. His answers became 
more evasive. So I asked him again. 
Ultimately, the Attorney General— 
although he was sworn in under oath, 
testifying in front of the Senate Judici-
ary Committee—refused to answer the 
question. He wouldn’t tell me, wouldn’t 
tell the Judiciary Committee, wouldn’t 
tell the country, whether he had put 
any thought at all into how his actions 
would impact concerned, law-abiding 
parents. 
Even though the National School 
Boards 
Association 
retracted 
and 
apologized for its letter, the Justice 
Department—the Biden Justice Depart-
ment—still refuses to do so. Attorney 
General Garland has doubled down on 
this colossal overreach and still refuses 
to take ownership or consider how his 
swift 
and 
uninformed 
action 
has 
harmed public discourse in our coun-
try. 
But, clearly, it is not only where we 
are headed, because we are already 
there. The President and the leaders in 
his administration aren’t making deci-
sions on the basis of the law of the 
land, but based on demands of their 
radical left. 
Amid an alarming spike in murder 
and violent crime rates, the Justice 
Department is focused on the threat of 
concerned parents, because that is 
what the radical left wants. 
The Department is filing meritless 
lawsuits against State election laws, 
like those in Georgia and Texas, be-
cause that is what their radical base 
wants. 
The Secretary of Homeland Security 
has told Immigration and Customs En-
forcement officers not to enforce our 
Nation’s immigration laws, because 
that is what the radical left and the 
Democratic Party want. 
President Biden has signaled that he 
is not only OK with this kind of selec-
tive law enforcement, he actually 
wants more of it. 
One of the most controversial nomi-
nees being considered by the Senate 
right now is Rachael Rollins, who the 
President has nominated to serve as 
the U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts. 
Ms. Rollins currently serves as a dis-
trict attorney for Suffolk County, MA, 
where she is embroiled in her own con-
troversy. 
Shortly after taking office in 2019, 
Ms. Rollins released a memo outlining 
more than a dozen crimes that she said 
should be ignored by local law enforce-
ment. According to Ms. Rollins, indi-
viduals who commit offenses like tres-
passing, shoplifting, larceny, wanton or 
malicious destruction of property, and 
even possession with intent to dis-
tribute drugs, she said her office would 
not prosecute them, so law enforce-
ment should not arrest them. 
Now, I have no issue with law en-
forcement using limited resources to 
prioritize the biggest threats, but there 
is a big difference between prioritizing 
dangerous criminals and offenses and 
exempting wholesale classes of crimes 
from enforcement. 
What happens when the message is 
sent that government will not enforce 
its laws? As being played out in Cali-
fornia now, where many businesses are 
simply withdrawing from places like 
San Francisco, where, if you steal or 
shoplift something under $950 worth of 
merchandise, law enforcement will not 
arrest you; they will not prosecute; and 
thus the stores are left without re-
course and, as you can imagine, thiev-
ery runs riot. 
Well, leaders certainly shouldn’t tip 
their hat to criminals as to what 
crimes may be committed free of any 
consequences, and that is exactly what 
is happening. The Justice Depart-
ment’s priorities are completely out of 
whack, and radical, partisan U.S. at-
torneys will only make things worse. 
The Biden administration cannot 
continue to take their marching orders 
from the radical base of their political 
party. And the United States should 
never be a place where concerned par-
ents are treated like criminals and ac-
tual criminals get a free pass. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
VACCINES 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I 
am beginning to feel a little bit like a 
broken record when I am here on the 
floor and talking about all the ways 
that Tennesseans feel like this admin-
istration has backed them into a cor-
ner. 
It doesn’t matter if I am going to fill 
up the car with that rising price in gas, 
or if I am at the grocery store and 
could not believe this weekend there is 
so little on the shelves and they are so 
short-staffed. 
People are very anxious about this. I 
had a lady that just about was not 
going to let me go there in the dairy 
section of the grocery store because 
she was really upset with what this ad-
ministration is doing. Whether it is in-
flation or the vaccine mandate, she is 
really upset with what she would like 
to call the ‘‘White House P.R. oper-
ation.’’ And she knows that inflation 
and supply chain problems are here. It 
is not temporary. It wasn’t transient. 
It is something that they are dealing 
with every day, and Tennesseans are 
seeing this at every stop along their 
busy days. 
They have watched this administra-
tion abandon the southern border. You 
know, they don’t use that term lightly, 
but I think it is instructive to focus in 
on that. This administration has aban-
doned the southern border. 
These actions are intentional ac-
tions—intentional. Whether you talk 
to Border Patrol or the local sheriff, 
they look at what Democrats in Wash-
ington are doing, and they see this as 
being intentional. 
They also look at how this adminis-
tration chose to abandon a productive 
energy policy. In January, we were an 
exporter—an exporter—of energy. And, 
today, we have a President—a very 
weak President—who is groveling to 
OPEC, begging them—begging them— 
to sell us more fuel. What a difference. 
What a difference. 
And this administration—when I was 
up in Clarksville where Fort Campbell 
is located, I was out on post, and I was 
visiting with Tennesseans there in 
Clarksville. They feel as if this admin-
istration has abandoned our troops, 
abandoned civilians and allies in Af-
ghanistan as we handed over 20 years’ 
worth of hard-fought territory to the

new ‘‘axis of evil,’’ which is Russia, 
China, Iran, and North Korea—aban-
doned, left, forgotten about. Over the 
past few weeks, they have learned that 
even their recreational social media 
use might be putting their families at 
risk. 
Meanwhile, things here on Capitol 
Hill are such a mess that, from their 
perspective, it is neither reasonable 
nor rational to believe that the Demo-
cratic majority is willing to put coun-
try before party and politics and fix 
this mess that this administration has 
made this year. In fact, the Democrats 
are so focused on their own Big Gov-
ernment narrative that they have man-
aged to outdo themselves with the 
mandate from on high that goes fur-
ther than ever before to control deeply 
personal healthcare decisions. 
Of course, the Democrats are no 
stranger to this. They championed the 
Affordable Care Act and all its bu-
reaucracy, but this time, they have 
truly put the full force of the executive 
branch of the U.S. Government be-
tween a patient and a doctor. That is 
right. The decision is not one you will 
make with your doctor; it is one that 
the Federal Government is making and 
forcing—forcing—on you. This COVID– 
19 vaccine mandate has people really 
upset. They see this as a power play. 
Today, I talked to a lady who works 
for a government contractor. All of the 
family’s insurance and benefits come 
through her. Her husband is a small 
business person, and she has a child 
with disabilities. She begged me to 
keep fighting against this mandate. 
She said: You know, I am in the posi-
tion that I had to get this—even 
though a family member of hers had a 
terrible adverse reaction, and she was 
concerned being the primary bread-
winner for her family and the one that 
provides their healthcare insurance 
benefits. And she had a reaction, a bad 
reaction. 
But she feels like what we are seeing 
is another opportunistic power play 
that betrays the very people who 
risked their safety to prevent the econ-
omy from collapsing during the pan-
demic—that is right, the essential 
workers, people who showed up and did 
their job. 
The lady I talked to today was an es-
sential worker. She did her job all 
through the pandemic. The States 
deemed 
these 
individuals 
essential 
workers because they showed up. They 
spent their days transporting food and 
clothing across the country, stocking 
shelves in grocery stores, and keeping 
armed rioters at bay. 
They never stopped working. They 
never missed a beat. They put them-
selves in danger and adapted to cir-
cumstances made worse by forced 
lockdowns. These are the people who 
couldn’t have worked from home if 
they wanted to. They are the cop on 
the beat. They are the truck driver 
who is in the cab of that truck. They 
are the healthcare worker standing at 
a bedside. They are an airline worker 
who is making certain that people are 
safe and planes are safe to fly. 
And, now, they are the ones that Joe 
Biden, KAMALA HARRIS, and this ad-
ministration have chosen to threaten 
with an executive ultimatum: Get the 
shot, or we are going to get you fired. 
That is right. Imagine that. The 
President of the United States says: 
You go get the jab, or I am going to get 
you fired from your job—what an ulti-
matum, what a way to run a country. 
But that is what he is doing. The 
White House crossed so many lines 
with this one: practical lines, ethical 
lines, constitutional lines. So last 
week, I introduced the Keeping Our 
COVID–19 Heroes Employed Act to 
push this administration back on the 
rails and protect these essential work-
ers from having to choose between sub-
mitting to the mandate or losing the 
right to provide for their families. 
It is a simple solution to a very big 
problem. It would lock in the defini-
tions of essential worker used by the 
States during the pandemic and then 
protect those workers from being fired 
under COVID vaccine requirements. It 
would nullify the Executive orders 
mandating vaccines for essential Fed-
eral workers and contractors and pre-
empt OSHA from issuing regulations 
that would require employees to vac-
cinate if those employees qualify as an 
essential worker. 
We are getting a tremendous amount 
of support for this legislation. On the 
national level, we have heard from the 
Fraternal Order of Police, the National 
Sheriffs’ Association, the Chicago Fra-
ternal Order of Police, the Federal Law 
Enforcement Officers Association, the 
National Border Patrol Council, and 
from the Tennessee Chamber of Com-
merce, Tennessee Ambulance Service 
Association, 
Owner-Operator 
Inde-
pendent Drivers Association, the Na-
tional Association of Small Trucking 
Companies, and then from several indi-
vidual officials—Democrat and Repub-
lican alike—and from different organi-
zations. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent this list be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the

Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, 
see, these are individuals on the front 
line, and they take exception to what 
is going on with this administration 
and this Executive order that is forcing 
them to get a shot that maybe their 
doctor is saying: Hey, this is not one 
for you to take. 
Maybe they are a young woman try-
ing to have a baby. Maybe they are 
somebody who has a history of heart 
disease or lung disease or neuro-
muscular issues in their family and 
someone has had an adverse reaction. 
You know what? People are smart. 
They are going to figure this out and 
figure out what works best for them. 
During the pandemic, the essential 
workers figured this out, and they 
ought to be exempt. 
The 
Biden 
administration 
claims 
that this mandate is the ticket to free-
dom, return to normal. But here is the 
problem with this and why that falls 
on deaf ears. These essential workers 
returned to normal months ago—if 
they ever left a normal routine—and 
their working conditions have been 
made more difficult now than ever. 
Businesses are desperate for workers. 
In August, the U.S. economy had 10.4 
million jobs waiting to be filled. That 
is right, 10.4 million jobs. We are going 
to get unemployment numbers this 
weekend on Friday. I think it is going 
to be interesting to see what those 
numbers tell us. 
Oh, the supply chain—I mentioned 
the grocery store and what I found 
there. Well, the supply chains are a 
mess. We need 80,000 truck drivers 
right now—today—if we want to make 
an honest attempt at filling the need 
there to get products to stores. We 
can’t afford the toll these mandates are 
taking on the supply chain workforce 
or on law enforcement or border secu-
rity or the healthcare sector or the air-
line industry, the transportation and 
logistics industry. 
And make no mistake, the day of 
reckoning is already here. As I said, 
these workers have figured this out. 
They are smart. They don’t hate the 
country. And it is ridiculous that some 
people try to equate those that don’t 
get the vaccine with hating the coun-
try. These individuals are not anti- 
vaxxers. They are not anti-science. 
What they are is this: They are anti- 
unconstitutional mandate and a gov-
ernment overreach that is going to 
interfere in their relationship with 
their doctor. That is what they are 
against. 
Mr. President, don’t we all remember 
the lie of the decade in 2010 with

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7533 
November 1, 2021 
ObamaCare: If you like your doctor, 
you can keep your doctor. 
And what we are looking at right 
now is something that is an equal over-
reach: You can’t keep your job if you 
won’t get this jab. It is an overreach. 
People that I am talking to are real-
ly anti these mandates that would 
force them into submission or, in some 
cases, into poverty, like the young 
mom that I talked to who works for a 
government contractor—sole supporter 
of her family at this point, has one 
child, wants to have another child, and 
because of this mandate, she is going 
to lose her job, a job she loves—and her 
employer loves her. But she is wanting 
to make certain she can have that sec-
ond child. 
These workers are very pro-freedom, 
and they are taking a stand on prin-
ciple. They are pro-freedom. They are 
pro-individual rights, and what they 
want is for this administration to stop 
it, to stop their push to this socialist 
agenda, stop trying to force them into 
taking a vaccine, which is another step 
to having government control of their 
healthcare. 
You know, they look at what the 
Democrats in Washington, DC, are 
doing, and they see that they are try-
ing to take one vote. They want to win. 
They want to win on putting every-
thing together—one vote—and then 
flipping the country to their socialist 
agenda—one vote: government control 
of your kids, of your healthcare, of 
your bank account, of your life, cradle 
to grave, daylight to dark, sunup to 
sundown, 24/7, 365. 
You know, I have to tell you, we 
thought that when the Obama cam-
paign came out with their little carica-
tures and cartoon-type character—only 
it was really frightening—‘‘The Life of 
Julia,’’ we thought, this is ridiculous 
how Julia never needed anybody or 
anything but the Federal Government. 
Well, some of that same crowd in the 
White House has now come up with 
‘‘The Life of Linda,’’ and Linda must 
be related to Julia because Linda has 
the same type life experiences as Julia. 
There is no mention of a family or a 
husband, but Linda has a child. Linda 
works for the government. The govern-
ment is in control. 
See, that is what the Democratic 
Party wants—socialism. They are very 
happy with that—cradle to grave; day-
light to dark; total control; tell you 
what to do; tell you what your job is 
going to be; tell you what you are 
going to study in school; take control 
of your children; send them to study 
whatever they want; and then have 
them work in a way that the govern-
ment tells them they are going to 
work. 
But what we are seeing play out in 
this country is the American people 
standing up and saying: Enough is 
enough. We don’t want your mandate. 
We are tired of all of your chaotic 
cycle of gaslighting and government 
overreach. We are pushing back on 
your push to a socialist agenda. 
I am heartened that they are not 
afraid to say ‘‘no, no, no’’ to what the 
Democrats are trying to push, and they 
are going to continue to push back be-
cause they see what is happening for 
what it is—a destructive, radical agen-
da that will destroy freedom of choice, 
free people, free markets, and oppor-
tunity for their children and future 
generations. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The legislative clerk proceeded to

Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
REMEMBERING JOHN AMARA F. WALTERS 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
think all Senators can agree that we 
would not be able to deliver results for 
the people in our States and for our 
country if it were not for our extraor-
dinary staff, who work with us each 
and every day. They are there with us 
in the trenches, fighting for the con-
stituents we pledge to serve, and de-
fending the Constitution of the United 
States. 
It is for that reason that I am con-
fident my colleagues will agree with 
me when I say congressional staff is 
more than just a collection of individ-
uals; it is a family. And it is that truth 
that makes my presence on the Senate 
floor this evening all the more dif-
ficult, because my office, our family, 
has lost a beloved member. 
John Amara F. Walters, a legislative 
aide in my office, passed away on the 
morning of October 2, at MedStar 
Washington Hospital Center in Wash-
ington, DC. He died in the arms of his 
beloved mother, Kimberley, who joins 
us this evening in the gallery. John 
was 29 years old. 
On behalf of myself, our office, and 
the people of Maryland, I want to take 
a little time not only to express our 
profound grief at the loss of a dear 
friend and amazing human being, but 
also to tell a little bit of John’s story 
to this Senate and to the Nation, and 
to pay tribute to his life, to honor all 
that he gave us, and to celebrate all 
that he gave to the world. 
John Amara F. Walters was born on 
Friday, February 9, 1992, in Adrian, MI, 
to John A.M. Walters and Kimberley H. 
Davis Walters. He came from a long 
line of patriots and leaders, including 
his grandfather, who defended the 
United States in World War II as a 
Tuskegee Airman. 
And John caught the political bug 
early. At age 6—yes, you all heard that 
right, aged 6 years old—John started 
working on local political campaigns. 
In his early years, he participated in 
three Presidential elections and trav-
eled across Michigan and the country 
to serve communities in need. In high 
school, he interned for the late great 
Michigan Senator, Carl Levin. John 
was also a committed member of the 
Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute’s 
Pathways to Freedom program. 
He excelled inside the classroom— 
first graduating from Adrian High 
School in 2010, and then going on to 
study at the District of Columbia’s own 
Howard University, where he earned 
his BA in psychology in 2015 magna 
cum laude. I should add he was a loyal 
Howard alum and proud Bison and a fa-
vorite son of the university’s. 
The last time I met face-to-face—in 
the pre-COVID days—with the presi-
dent of Howard University, Wayne 
Frederick, John was with me, and I 
told Dr. Frederick how proud we were 
of John’s exemplary work, and Dr. 
Frederick was proud too. 
John did all of this at a young age 
and more, and he achieved these things 
despite having a lifelong battle with 
sickle cell anemia—an illness that 
often struck him with fatigue and pain. 
But that didn’t stop John. He refused 
to be defined by his illness, and he re-
fused to allow sickle cell to prevent 
him from pursuing his dreams with 
passion and decency and dedication. It 
is a disease that took him from us far 
too soon, but it never took away his 
spirit or his zest for life and his com-
mitment to making a positive change. 
I will always remember John for the 
twinkle in his eye, his enthusiasm for 
everything he did, his absolute bril-
liance, and his commitment to helping 
others. Everyone in our office—and I 
mean everyone—loved John. 
After he passed away, we held a staff 
Zoom call with his mother, both to 
grieve together and to remember John; 
and in that gathering, we witnessed a 
torrent of love and affection for all 
John did and what he meant to us. 
There were lots of tears, but also many 
moments of beautiful laughter, as we 
recounted many fun stories about 
John. 
He gave us many things, but perhaps 
one of his greatest gifts was his empa-
thy. In the world of politics and Cap-
itol Hill, there is plenty of ambition. 
And John was ambitious. But empathy 
is often in short supply. Not in John. 
Empathy is that quality where some-
one seeks to see the world through the 
eyes of another, of understanding what 
somebody else is experiencing by try-
ing to walk in that person’s shoes and 
live the world as they live it. John did 
not just hear the words spoken by oth-
ers; he listened; he absorbed them; he 
dared to be vulnerable. 
And what always struck me about 
John was his capacity to focus on the 
struggles experienced by others at the 
same time he was carrying on his own 
fight against sickle cell. Perhaps his 
own personal struggle made him far 
more attuned to the hardships faced by 
others; but whatever its source, John’s 
capacity to care inspired us all, as did 
his ability to persist and carry on in 
the face of adversity. John embodied 
the very best of us. 
John first joined my office as an in-
tern right out of college, when I was

still serving in the House of Represent-
atives. After graduating from Howard, 
he could have chosen many different 
paths. He chose public service. From 
John’s first moments on our team, it 
was clear that he was not only sharp 
and eager to work, but that he cared 
deeply about his fellow colleagues and 
that he was completely dedicated to 
our mission of serving the people of 
Maryland and the country. 
When I was elected to the Senate, I 
was thrilled to have John move to this 
side of the Capitol with me. He leapt at 
every opportunity to advance our mis-
sion—growing 
from 
organizing 
and 
drafting letters to constituents, to tak-
ing constituent meetings, to eventu-
ally thinking of and writing legisla-
tion. He was a vibrant force on Capitol 
Hill both in our office and outside of it, 
and was an active member of the Sen-
ate Black Legislative Staff Caucus. 
When our Senate office first divided 
up issues among our legislative cor-
respondents, John chose to take re-
sponsibility for some of the hottest 
button issues, like criminal justice re-
form and public safety, that demanded 
an open ear and a welcoming heart. He 
worked on gun issues and spoke to con-
stituents who had experienced personal 
tragedies from gun violence, and he al-
ways brought their feelings to his work 
on legislation to strengthen our gun 
laws. When the previous administra-
tion was trying to dismantle parts of 
the civil service, John met with and 
helped Federal employees who feared 
they might lose their jobs at any mo-
ment. In a million different ways, John 
proved that empathy has a home in 
public service and can even direct the 
course of policy changes. 
When we decided to hold a hearing on 
the 
hardships 
that 
Postal 
Service 
delays were imposing on Americans, 
John remembered a meeting he had 
held months earlier with a group from 
the National Federation of the Blind, 
where they discussed the real chal-
lenges they were experiencing because 
of the long delays in the delivery of 
their essential materials. John was 
moved by their stories at the time, and 
he lifted their voices. At his sugges-
tion, we invited a member of that 
group to testify, and their moving and 
powerful testimony is now leading the 
changes that will help every American. 
That was John—listening and then 
bringing people’s voices into the public 
square to change lives for the better. 
John brought empathy to his work 
and to the office, but he also brought 
great joy. His desk was a must-stop 
place 
for 
members 
of 
our 
team 
throughout the day. People would stop 
by to share his company, to hear his 
loud and infectious laugh, to talk 
about the latest news of the day, or—I 
have been told—to joke about the 
craziest couple on ‘‘90 Day Fiance,’’ 
which, 
on 
the 
enthusiastic 
rec-
ommendation of John and a few others, 
built quite a following in our office 
among current and past staff. I was not 
sure what to think about all that when 
I learned about it. 
John brought joy with his wry wit 
and keen sense of the absurd—always 
taking his work seriously, but never 
taking himself too seriously. He had a 
critical skill on Capitol Hill—the abil-
ity to track down House and Senate re-
ceptions with the very best food, and 
then alert his colleagues to the spoils. 
If someone couldn’t get away from the 
office, he would bring back snacks to 
share, pulling treats out of his pockets 
like a magician. 
He was a true member of our office 
family and always a team player, al-
ways willing to advance our causes on 
behalf of our constituents. And in com-
ing to know his family, I can see where 
those qualities began. You could see 
that he was supported by his beloved 
mother, Kimberley Davis, in the way 
he supported our team—always ready 
to help out and pitch in for the mis-
sion. You could see that he was helped 
and mentored by his uncles and aunts 
in the way he helped and mentored the 
new members of our office whom he 
worked with. 
Today, in the gallery, in addition to 
John’s mother, Kimberley, we are 
joined by his uncle John and John’s 
wife, Carol; and Christian Gibbs, who 
was like an uncle to John. 
You could see how much John was 
loved by those closest to him by how 
much he loved and embraced others, 
and he, in turn, was loved and re-
spected by our entire Capitol Hill fam-
ily. He was an example to all of us of a 
person who put everyone else’s chal-
lenges ahead of his own. 
Our office wants to hold John Amara 
Walters up as a model to other young 
people who walk through our doors. As 
I mentioned, John began his service 
with us when he was an intern, and we 
have decided to establish a permanent 
paid internship position in John’s 
name and memory, and that position 
will always go to a student from Mary-
land who is attending Howard Univer-
sity. 
In that way, we know that the young 
leaders of the future will learn about 
John’s spirit and his legacy and learn 
to carry forward his torch of empathy 
and positive change. 
John wanted to help others. He want-
ed to leave the world better than he 
found it. He did that and much more. 
While his life was far too short in 
years, it was long in the joy and the 
love he shared and in the lives he 
changed for the better. 
Thank you, John. We love you. 
I yield the floor.

JOHN LEWIS VOTING RIGHTS ADVANCEMENT ACT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, in 
1 minute, I will be filing cloture on the 
John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act, but I 
am going to give a short, brief remark 
before I do that. 
Now, tonight, I am filing cloture on a 
motion to proceed on the John Lewis 
Voting Rights Advancement Act. That 
means that the Senate is going to take 
a first vote on whether or not we even 
debate this voting rights bill—even de-
bate it—on Wednesday. 
Our democracy relies on the guar-
antee of free and fair elections. Across 
the country, we are witnessing a co-
ordinated assault on the integrity of 
our electoral process. We must advance 
critical reforms to protect the freedom 
to vote, fulfilling the life and the leg-
acy of our late colleague John Lewis. 
If there is any issue that deserves de-
bate in this Chamber, it is protecting 
voting rights. I know that both parties 
have differences on this important 
issue, but Republicans shouldn’t be 
afraid to debate the bill. 
If the Senate votes to open debate to 
this bill, I am prepared to offer an open 
and honest and full-fledged process 
here on the Senate floor, where Repub-
lican amendments will be made in 
order and allowed and debated. 
If Republican Senators have different 
ideas on how to achieve a stronger de-
mocracy, they owe it to the American 
people to come forward and debate 
their ideas. Simply standing silent 
with their arms crossed, refusing to 
allow the Senate to function, is unac-
ceptable.

f 
TIGRAY 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, the 
situation in Tigray continues to dete-
riorate. Recent bombings by the Ethio-
pian Government of Tigray’s densely 
populated capital city, Mekele, has re-
portedly 
killed 
civilians, 
including 
children. Millions of people have been 
displaced, and many in Tigray are fac-
ing famine. Combatants on both sides 
of the conflict have committed atroc-
ities. 
The United Nations Office for the Co-
ordination of Humanitarian Affairs re-
ported recently that only 14 percent of 
trucks with relief aid were getting 
through to the people of Tigray, due to 
roadblocks and lack of fuel. Lifesaving 
medications have been blocked from 
getting into Tigray, which cripples the 
ability of the UN and their NGO part-
ners to respond to urgent health needs. 
If the government does not permit de-
liveries of humanitarian aid, more and 
more people will needlessly starve to 
death. 
The United States has imposed sanc-
tions against the government in Addis 
Ababa. The Congress has also acted. 
The Fiscal Year 2022 Department of 
State and Foreign Operations Appro-
priations bill was introduced in the 
Senate on October 26, and it would pro-
hibit U.S. military aid to Ethiopia. It 
would also require the Department of 
the Treasury to oppose international 
bank loans to the Ethiopian Govern-
ment, except to meet basic human 
needs, until the government ceases of-
fensive military operation, takes cred-
ible and sustained steps toward a gen-
uine political dialogue to end the con-
flict, implements measures to protect 
human rights, allows unimpeded hu-
manitarian access, and cooperates with 
independent investigations of viola-
tions of human rights. 
Ethiopia is a country facing every 
imaginable problem, increasingly exac-
erbated by climate change. There is no 
military solution to the ethnic rival-
ries that have divided the country for 
generations. Any sustainable solution 
will only be achieved through negotia-
tion 
and 
compromise. 
The 
inter-
national community, including the 
United States, can help support such a 
dialogue, but it is the Ethiopian Gov-
ernment’s responsibility to create the 
conditions for that to occur. Rather 
than squander the country’s scarce re-
sources on a fruitless, brutal campaign 
to dominate Tigray by force, Prime 
Minister Abiy would be well advised to 
listen to the international community

TRIBUTE TO MICHIGAN’S 
VETERANS 
Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I 
rise today to honor all of the brave 
Michigan veterans who have served in 
our Nation’s military. 
When the scourge of slavery threat-
ened to tear our Nation in two, 
Michiganders selflessly marched to 
war. When fascism rose in Europe, 
Michiganders built an Arsenal of De-
mocracy and kept freedom alive. And 
when terrorists attacked our own coun-
try 20 years ago, Michiganders stood up 
and signed up. Over and over again, 
Michigan men and women have served 
our country to protect our freedoms. 
These veterans all fought different 
battles and had different missions. But 
all of them were patriots. All of them— 
and their families—made incredible 
sacrifices. And all of them were willing 
to lay down their own lives to protect 
their fellow Americans and this Nation 
we love. 
Perhaps there’s no better Michigan 
example of this than Charles S. Ket-
tles. Charles was born in Ypsilanti in 
1930 and fell in love with flying while 
attending Edison Institute High School 
in Dearborn. Aviation was in his blood; 
his dad was a military pilot. 
In 1951, Charles was drafted into the 
Army. He attended Army Aviation 
School and served tours in Korea, 
Japan, and Thailand. He retired from 
Active Duty in 1956 and continued to 
serve in the Army Reserves. 
During the Vietnam war, the Army 
was in desperate need of helicopter pi-
lots. So in 1963, Charlie volunteered for 
active duty and learned to fly the UH- 
1D, ‘‘Huey.’’ 
Those skills would save lives on May 
15, 1967. Then-Major Kettles volun-
teered to lead a flight of six Hueys on 
a rescue mission. 
Charles’s helicopter came under fire, 
but he kept on flying. After the second 
rescue flight, his helicopter was leak-
ing fuel, and his gunner was severely 
wounded. He found a helicopter that 
wasn’t leaking and went back to rescue 
the stranded men. 
On the way back to the base, he 
learned that eight troops had been left 
behind. Without a second thought, he 
returned to the landing zone. 
His helicopter was hit by gunfire and 
a mortar round. Yet somehow, Charles 
made it back to the landing zone, 
picked up the stranded troops, and 
brought them safely back to the base. 
In total, he saved 44 lives that day. 
Typically, the Medal of Honor must 
be awarded within 5 years of the heroic 
act. But this kind of heroism has no ex-
piration date. In 2015, I introduced leg-
islation with Senator GARY PETERS and 
Congresswoman DEBBIE
DINGELL
to 
allow Charles to receive the Medal of 
Honor. In 2016, he did. 
And earlier this year, it was an in-
credible honor to be there when the 
Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Ann 
Arbor was renamed after Charles. Lieu-
tenant Colonel Kettles saved lives back 
in 1967, and the Lieutenant Colonel 
Charles S. Kettles VA Medical Center 
is saving lives today. 
‘‘We got the 44 out,’’ he said during 
his Medal of Honor ceremony in 2016. 
‘‘None of those names appear on the 
wall in Washington. There’s nothing 
more important than that.’’ 
Humility, a spirit of service, and the 
willingness to sacrifice. Michigan’s 
veterans have done so much for us. It is 
our solemn duty to keep each and 
every promise we have made to them. 
Thank you. 
f 
HONORING CHARLES ‘‘CHARLIE’’ E. 
WHITE 
Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I 
rise today to honor the life of Charles 
‘‘Charlie’’ E. White, an outstanding 
American and decorated Vietnam War 
veteran. 
While Charlie is no longer with us, 
his legacy lives on. On behalf of my fel-
low Americans, I would like extend our 
deepest gratitude for his service to this 
Nation. 
Charlie was born on May 21, 1944, in 
Kansas City, MO, to Owlen and Lucille 
White. His parents raised him along-
side his brothers Bobby and Jerry and 
sister Judy in Independence, MO. 
Charlie never shied away from serv-
ice or sacrifice, and when the Vietnam 
war broke out, he quickly answered the 
call to duty and enlisted in the U.S. 
Army. He served our country hero-
ically as a member of the U.S. Army 
Special Forces, the Green Berets. 
As a sergeant in the Green Berets, he 
engaged in many perilous combat mis-
sions in Vietnam, including one where 
he was wounded by an enemy soldier’s 
bayonet. He donned a scar across his 
face for the rest of his life from this en-
counter and was awarded for his exem-
plary valor with multiple service med-
als. 
After the war, Charlie returned to 
Kansas and settled into his life as a 
loving husband and devoted father. 
Known by many for his hard work ethic 
and determination, he led a long career 
working for BNFS Railway and pro-
vided a great life for his family. 
He is survived by his wife Diane, sons 
Jack and Steve, daughter Tambra, nine 
grandchildren, and one great-grandson. 
His memory lives on through each of 
them and through his enduring legacy. 
I now have the profound honor of rec-
ognizing Charlie White with the fol-
lowing honors for his bravery in the 
line of duty: Bronze Star Medal, Purple 
Heart Medal, and Silver Star Medal. 
These medals represent a small token 
of our country’s appreciation for Char-
lie’s incredible service and sacrifice. 
He is an American hero who has 
made our country proud, and we owe 
him a great debt of gratitude.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING FLORENCE’S 
EXQUISITE CHOCOLATES 
∑ Mr. RISCH. Madam President, as a 
member and former chairman of the 
Senate Committee on Small Business 
and Entrepreneurship, each month I 
recognize and celebrate the American 
entrepreneurial spirit by highlighting 
the success of a small business in my 
home State of Idaho. Today, I am 
pleased to honor Florence’s Exquisite 
Chocolates in Rexburg as the Idaho 
Small Business of the Month for No-
vember 2021. 
As the namesake and founder of the 
business, Florence Manwaring had a 
long-standing passion for making choc-
olate. To pay her way through college, 
Florence began working in a chocolate 
factory where she learned the art of 
chocolatiering. Florence combined her 
work experience, passion, and giving 
spirit to make candies for her friends 
and family. Her chocolates became 
popular with her friends, and with 
their encouragement, Florence and her 
husband Var considered launching a 
business so she could pursue her pas-
sion. As the economy hit a downturn in 
the 70s, Var switched his focus from 
construction to helping his wife open a 
small business, and in 1981, Florence’s 
dream became a reality. 
Despite initial struggles, the shop 
quickly gained the attention of the 
Rexburg community and grew so rap-
idly that Florence’s family became in-
volved as well. A true family-owned 
business, the Manwarings have the dis-
tinction of employing every single fam-
ily member, each of whom has been 
critical to the company’s success. 
Some of Florence’s iconic chocolates 
include 
turtles, 
haystacks, 
toffees, 
caramels, and mints. The business has 
received widespread recognition, gar-
nering positive reception from leaders 
of The Church of Jesus Christ of Lat-
ter-day Saints and then-President Ron-
ald Reagan. Florence’s shop has not 
only found success selling locally, but 
has 
also 
distributed 
its 
candies 
throughout the region.

REMEMBERING DEXTER RANDALL 
∑ Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I 
rise today to honor the memory of Dex-
ter Randall of Newport Center, VT. In 
Dexter’s passing, Vermont and the Na-
tion has lost a great champion for 
farmers. 
Dexter was born in Lyndon, VT, in 
1945 but spent most of his life with his 
family on their farm in Troy, VT. On 
September 3, 1971, he married Alice 
Gilman, who we sadly lost a year ago, 
on June 2, 2020. Along with their five 
children—Lisa, Justin, Jordan, Irene, 
and Jason—Randall and Alice ran their 
small organic dairy farm for 37 years 
before Justin and Irene took over oper-
ations. 
While Dexter was first and foremost 
a farmer, he was also a public servant. 
In the Northeast Kingdom, an area of 
the State often known for more con-
servative 
points 
of 
view, 
Dexter 
charted a unique political path, serving 
as a Progressive State representative 
with a strong independent streak. Dex-
ter felt that his political philosophy 
was not all that different from that of 
his father, who had been a Republican, 
but 
that 
the 
Vermont 
Republican 
Party of earlier generations had under-
gone significant change. During his 
time in and out of the Vermont State-
house, he was an unwavering voice for 
farmers and small family farms, fight-
ing for fair milk prices and to safe-
guard Vermont’s agricultural heritage. 
Both in elected office and during his 
30 
years 
on 
the 
board 
of 
Rural 
Vermont, Dexter showed a fearlessness 
in advocating for bold policy change. 
He understood that in order to save 
family farms and ensure the future of 
agriculture in Vermont, we needed to 
fundamentally 
rethink 
agricultural 
policy and fight against corporation 
consolidation. He was at the center of 
some of the biggest agricultural de-
bates of his time, including the cre-
ation of the New England Dairy Com-
pact and fighting to protect farmers 
from the corporate greed of companies 
producing genetically modified orga-
nism—GMO—seeds. Dexter’s work was 
not limited to Vermont. In 2006, he 
traveled to Mali to learn how U.S. poli-
cies impact Africa’s agricultural sec-
tor. On this and many other topics, 
Dexter demonstrated an ability to 
translate complex policy issues into 
plain language, making it easy for his 
constituents to understand and relate 
to. 
Caring for the land was at the heart 
of Dexter’s work. Despite farming 
being more than a full-time job, he was 
active with the Missisquoi Basin Asso-
ciation, the American Devon Cattle As-
sociation, the Orleans County Natural 
Resources Conservation District, and 
the Vermont Center for Sustainable 
Agriculture. At a time when agri-
culture and environmental protection 
were often pitted against one another, 
Dexter showed that farmers can and 
often are strong conservationists and 
excellent stewards of the land. 
When I first met Dexter 35 years ago, 
his reputation as a fearless champion 
for rural Vermonters and farmers pre-
ceded him. Some probably would have 
considered us to be unlikely friends; he 
was a dairy farmer in a remote part of 
the State, and I was the first Inde-
pendent mayor of the State’s biggest 
city of Burlington. Those people, of 
course, were wrong. It was 1986, milk 
prices were low, and both Dexter and I 
understood that farmers were suf-
fering. To raise spirits and money, 
Rural Vermont held a fundraiser near 
Dexter and Alice’s farm. For my part, 
I drove the 2 hours to the Northeast 
Kingdom because not only did I under-
stand the importance of the issue, I 
was impressed by the grassroots advo-
cacy of Dexter, Alice, and the orga-
nizers. From that day on, Dexter and I 
enjoyed a long friendship that included 
a pig roast on his farm each year. At 
the heart, these events were very much 
about good food, comradery, bringing 
people together, and appreciating the 
pastoral landscape of Vermont. These 
events were also where good, old-fash-
ioned democracy took place. People 
could talk about the issues that were 
important to them and feel like politi-
cians were actually listening. I learned 
a great deal at these events about the 
struggles of working people, especially 
in rural Vermont, and for that, I am 
eternally grateful to Dexter. 
I was sad not to be able to join Dex-
ter on the farm this year, and I will 
miss traveling there and seeing Dexter 
each year, but I am thankful for our 
many years of friendship. To my mind, 
Dexter 
represented 
the 
best 
of 
Vermont; he was not only deeply en-
gaged in the issues, but he also genu-
inely cared about the wellbeing of his 
friends, family, neighbors, fellow farm-
ers, and his rural constituents. He be-
lieved everyone deserves a fair shot, 
and 
he 
tirelessly 
advocated 
for 
Vermonters at every opportunity he 
could, whether by supporting universal 
healthcare or milk prices that enabled 
farmers to keep the lights on and live 
in dignity. 
Ultimately, Dexter brought his ethos 
about farming—that ‘‘if you take care 
of the land it will take care of you, so 
you can leave it a little bit better than 
you found it’’—to his community and 
his State. Vermont is indeed a better 
place, and Vermonters are better off, 
thanks to Dexter Randall.∑

The PRESIDING OFFICER laid be-

from the President of the United 
States, together with an accompanying 
report; which was referred to the Com-

Housing, 
and 
Urban Affairs: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides 
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90 
days prior to the anniversary date of 
its declaration, the President publishes 
in the Federal Register and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to 
the Federal Register for publication the 
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional 
emergency 
with 
respect 
to 
Sudan declared in Executive Order 
13067 of November 3, 1997, is to continue 
in effect beyond November 3, 2021. 
Sudan made strides in its transition 
toward democracy since 2019, but the 
military takeover of the government 
and arrest of civilian leaders now 
threaten those positive gains. The cri-
sis that led to the declaration of a na-
tional emergency in Executive Order

in Executive Order 13400 of April 26, 
2006; and the taking of additional steps 
with respect to that emergency in Ex-
ecutive Order 13412 of October 13, 2006, 
Executive Order 13761 of January 13, 
2017, and Executive Order 13804 of July

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 
SENATE 
RESOLUTION 
435—HON-
ORING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY 
OF 
VERSAILLES, 
KNOWN 
AS 
‘‘THE WORLD’S MOST FAMOUS 
CUBAN RESTAURANT’’ 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida (for himself 
and Mr. RUBIO) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 435 
Whereas Versailles, located in Miami, 
Florida, is known as ‘‘The World’s Most Fa-
mous Cuban Restaurant’’; 
Whereas Versailles was originally founded 
in 1971 by Felipe Valls Sr., a Cuban immi-
grant; 
Whereas, soon after opening its doors in 
1971, Versailles became the gathering place 
for Cuban exiles located in Miami; 
Whereas Versailles has been a central spot 
for notable visitors from across the United 
States to show their support for the Cuban 
people; 
Whereas Versailles has been home to many 
peaceful protests, including large scale dem-
onstrations like the one that occurred in 
July 2021 in support of the people of Cuba 
protesting the harshness of the current re-
gime in that country; 
Whereas Versailles hosted seas of Cuban- 
Americans celebrating the death of longtime 
dictator Fidel Castro in November 2016, 
which led more than 60 TV crews and other 
forms of media to come and witness a piece 
of Cuban and Cuban-American history; 
Whereas the mirrors in the main hall of 
Versailles, designed by Juan Pe´rez-Cruz, a 
decorator with a passion for French styles 
and uncle of singer Pitbull, appear to make 
the restaurant goers multiply; 
Whereas Versailles is described by many 
residents of Miami-Dade County as being a 
cultural 
hub 
for 
Cuban-Americans 
and 
Miamians, which is evidenced by the fact 
that whenever a sports team in Miami wins 
a national title or accomplishes something 
extraordinary, there will be crowds of people 
outside of Versailles and on Calle Ocho, 
banging pots and pans together and chanting 
in celebration; 
Whereas Versailles is working with the 
History of Miami Museum and Exile Books 
to collect memories and stories from individ-
uals in connection with the restaurant over 
the past 50 years in order to showcase the 
cultural significance of Versailles; 
Whereas the legacy of Felipe Valls Sr. con-
tinues with the Valls Group, which has 2,000 
employees and owns the 9 La Carretas in 
South Florida, MesaMar in Coral Gables, 
Casa Cuba in South Miami, and Casa 
Juancho, a longtime Spanish restaurant in 
Little Havana; 
Whereas the Valls family worked with the 
locally founded grocery store chain Sedano’s 
to employ over 400 Versailles staff members 
while Versailles and all of the La Carreta lo-
cations were closed in 2020 during the 
Coranavirus Disease 2019 (COVID–19) pan-
demic; and 
Whereas the Valls family has participated 
in charitable work throughout the Miami 
community for many organizations, includ-
ing the American Cancer Society and Ami-
gos for Kids: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) 
honors 
the 
50th 
anniversary 
of 
Versailles, known as the ‘‘The World’s Most 
Famous Cuban Restaurant’’, as a moment to 
celebrate Cuban heritage and the innovation 
of the people of South Florida; 
(2) notes that the story of Versailles, being 
created by Cuban immigrants as a cultural 
hub for Cuban-Americans and Miamians, is 
unique to the United States; and 
(3) commends Versailles for 50 years of op-
eration and cultural contributions to Miami 
and the great State of Florida.

tary construction, and for defense ac-
tivities of the Department of Energy, 
to 
prescribe 
military 
personnel 
strengths for such fiscal year, and for 
other purposes; which was ordered to 
lie on the table; as follows: 
At the end of subtitle B of title XII, add 
the following: 
SEC. 1216. STATUS OF WOMEN AND GIRLS IN AF-
GHANISTAN. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) Since May 2021, the escalation of vio-
lent conflict in Afghanistan has forcibly dis-
placed an estimated 655,000 civilians, and 80 
percent of those forced to flee are women and 
children. 
(2) Since regaining control of Afghanistan 
in August 2021, the Taliban have taken ac-
tions reminiscent of their brutal rule in the 
late 1990s. They have cracked down on pro-
testers, reportedly detained and beaten jour-
nalists, and reestablished their Ministry for 
the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of 
Vice, which under previous Taliban rule en-
forced prohibitions on behavior deemed un- 
Islamic. The Taliban’s acting higher edu-
cation minister said women will be per-
mitted to study at universities in gender- 
segregated classrooms while wearing Islamic 
attire. The new Taliban government is being 
filled with hard-liners from the former 
Taliban regime. The Taliban are imposing 
harsh rule despite pledges to respect the 
rights of women and minority communities 
and provide amnesty for people who sup-
ported United States efforts in Afghanistan. 
(3) Until the Taliban assumed control of 
the country in August 2021, the women and 
girls of Afghanistan had achieved much since 
2001, even as insecurity, poverty, under-
development, and patriarchal norms contin-
ued to limit their rights and opportunities in 
much of Afghanistan. 
(4) Through strong support from the United 
States and the international community— 
(A) female enrollment in public schools in 
Afghanistan continued to increase through 
2015 with an estimated high of 50 percent of 
school age girls attending; and 
(B) by 2019— 
(i) women held political leadership posi-
tions, and women served as ambassadors; and 
(ii) women served as professors, judges, 
prosecutors, defense attorneys, police, mili-
tary members, health professionals, journal-
ists, humanitarian and developmental aid 
workers, and entrepreneurs. 
(5) Women’s and girls’ rights and empower-
ment continue to serve the interests of Af-
ghanistan and the United States because 
women are sources of peace and economic 
progress in Afghanistan. 
(6) With the return of Taliban control, the 
United States has little ability to preserve 
the rights of women and girls in Afghani-
stan, and those women and girls may again 
face the intimidation and marginalization 
they faced under the last Taliban regime. 
(7) Women and girls in Afghanistan are 
again facing gender-based violence, includ-
ing— 
(A) forced marriage; 
(B) intimate partner and domestic vio-
lence; 
(C) sexual harassment; 
(D) sexual violence, including rape; 
(E) gender-based denial of resources; and 
(F) emotional and psychological violence. 
(8) Gender-based violence has always been 
a significant problem in Afghanistan and is 
expected to become more widespread with 
the Taliban in control. In 2020, even before 
the Taliban assumed control of the country, 
Human Rights Watch projected that 87 per-
cent of Afghan women and girls will experi-
ence at least one form of gender-based vio-
lence in their lifetime, with 62 percent expe-
riencing multiple incidents of such violence.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7547 
November 1, 2021 
(9) Prior to the Taliban takeover in August 
2021, approximately 7,000,000 people in Af-
ghanistan lacked or had limited access to es-
sential health services as a result of inad-
equate public health coverage, weak health 
systems, and conflict-related interruptions 
in care. Women and girls faced additional 
challenges, as their access to life-saving 
services (for example, emergency obstetric 
services) was limited due to a shortage of fe-
male medical staff, cultural barriers, stigma 
and fears of reprisals following sexual vio-
lence, or other barriers to mobility, includ-
ing security fears. 
(10) Only approximately 50 percent of preg-
nant women and girls in Afghanistan deliver 
their children in a health facility with a pro-
fessional attendant, which increases the risk 
of complications in childbirth and prevent-
able maternal mortality. Food insecurity in 
Afghanistan is also posing a variety of 
threats to women and girls as malnutrition 
weakens their immune systems, making 
them more susceptible to infections, com-
plications during pregnancy, and risks dur-
ing childbirth. 
(11) Adolescent girls are particularly at 
risk due to the lack of safe and accessible re-
productive health services. 
(12) With the combined impacts of ongoing 
conflict and COVID–19, Afghan households 
increasingly resort to child marriage, forced 
marriage, and child labor to address food in-
security and other effects of extreme pov-
erty. 
(13) In Afghanistan, the high prevalence of 
anemia among adolescent girls reduces their 
ability to survive childbirth, especially when 
coupled with high rates of child marriage 
and forced marriage and barriers to access-
ing safe health services and information. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) since 2001, women’s rights organizations 
and girl-led groups and networks have been 
important engines of social, economic, and 
political development in Afghanistan; 
(2) any future political order in Afghani-
stan should secure the political, economic, 
and social gains made by Afghan women and 
work to increase the equal treatment of 
women and girls and improve the safe access 
for women and girls to essential services and 
information through laws and policies per-
taining to public and private life; 
(3) respecting the human rights of all peo-
ple is essential to securing lasting peace and 
sustainable development in Afghanistan; 
(4) in cooperation with international part-
ners, the United States must endeavor to 
preserve the hard-won gains made in Afghan-
istan during the past two decades, particu-
larly as related to the political and economic 
role, social rights, and protection of women 
and girls in society; 
(5) the continuing humanitarian assistance 
to the Afghan people is critical to support 
women and girls, for their protection, con-
tinued education, and well-being; 
(6) immediate and ongoing humanitarian 
needs in Afghanistan can only be met by a 
humanitarian response that includes formal 
agreements between local nongovernmental 
organizations and international partners 
that promotes the safe access and participa-
tion of female staff at all levels and across 
functional roles among all humanitarian ac-
tors; and 
(7) a lack of aid and essential services 
would result in a humanitarian crisis and 
serve to reinforce gender inequalities and 
power imbalances in Afghanistan. 
(c) POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES REGARD-
ING THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN AND GIRLS OF AF-
GHANISTAN.— 
(1) IN
GENERAL.—It is the policy of the 
United States— 
(A) to continue to support the rights of 
women and girls in Afghanistan following 
the withdrawal of the United States Armed 
Forces from Afghanistan, including through 
mechanisms to hold all parties publicly ac-

United States, supplemented by an unknown 
number, estimated to exceed 5,000,000, of em-
ployees of prime contractors, subcontrac-
tors, and grantees providing services to Ex-
ecutive agencies. 
(D) Policymakers, Executive agencies, and 
observers have often focused on individual 
components of the blended workforce, such 
as employees, without considering all com-
ponents or considering the entire blended 
workforce and how all 3 components can 
work most effectively together. 
(E) Executive agencies inhibit their own 
workforce planning and risk making deci-
sions that may reduce the overall efficiency 
and cost effectiveness of the blended work-
force by focusing on only 1 component in iso-
lation. 
(F) 
Establishing 
artificial 
limits 
on 
headcounts or full-time equivalent positions 
for Federal employees, administrators, and 
managerial employees of Executive agencies 
may discourage the employment of interns 
or entry-level employees to build a balanced 
employment pipeline and may inadvertently 
encourage managers to shift work to con-
tractors and grantees for the purpose of com-
plying with such numerical limits, even if 
those decisions are not justified by an ap-
proach to improve the efficiency or cost ef-
fectiveness of the Executive agency’s work. 
(G) The Government Accountability Office 
has identified strategic human capital man-
agement as a high-risk area for the Federal 
Government, adding that critical skills gaps 
‘‘impede the government from cost-effec-
tively serving the public and achieving re-
sults’’. 
(3) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that Executive agencies should— 
(A) manage the entire Federal blended 
workforce, including employees, contractors, 
and grantees, using a comprehensive and ho-
listic approach to advance their missions as 
effectively and cost efficiently as possible, 
within appropriated budgets and without 
using 
artificial 
numerical 
limits 
on 
headcounts or full-time-equivalent positions; 
and 
(B) conduct a holistic review of their 
blended workforce and develop a comprehen-
sive plan to ensure an efficient and cost-ef-
fective blended workforce.

November 1, 2021 
At the end of subtitle B of title X, add the 
following: 
SEC. 1013. RESUMPTION OF BORDER WALL CON-
STRUCTION. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that— 
(1) more than 1,700,000 migrants were en-
countered trying to illegally enter the 
United States during fiscal year 2021, which 
represents the highest number of illegal bor-
der crossings ever recorded by U.S. Customs 
and Border Protection; 
(2) at least 1,300,000 migrants have illegally 
crossed the international border between the 
United States and Mexico since President 
Biden suspended border wall construction, 
which represents a 314 percent increase in il-
legal border crossings compared to fiscal 
year 2020; 
(3) the actual number of migrants who ille-
gally crossed the international border be-
tween the United States and Mexico and by-
passed law enforcement during fiscal year 
2021 is unknown; 
(4) U.S. Customs and Border Protection set 
twenty year records for encountering the 
highest number of illegal border crossers per 
month in March 2021, April 2021, May 2021, 
June 2021, and July 2021; 
(5) President Biden’s efforts to suspend or 
terminate border wall construction have cost 
taxpayers 
between 
$1,837,000,000 
and 
$2,087,000,000 since January 20, 2021, and such 
costs are increasing by at least $3,000,000 
daily; 
(6) Congress has voted multiple times, on a 
bipartisan basis, to authorize the construc-
tion of a border wall system along the inter-
national border between the United States 
and Mexico; and 
(7) a border wall system is an effective tool 
for enhancing border security.

EARTH MINERALS. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) The People’s Republic of China is the 
global leader in mining, refining, and compo-
nent manufacturing of rare earth elements, 
producing approximately 85 percent of the 
world’s supply between 2011 and 2017. 
(2) In 2019, the United States imported an 
estimated 80 percent of its rare earth com-
pounds from the People’s Republic of China. 
(3) On March 26, 2014, the World Trade Or-
ganization ruled that the People’s Republic 
of China’s export restraints on rare earth 
minerals violated its obligations under its 
protocol of accession to the World Trade Or-
ganization, thereby harming United States 
manufacturers and workers. 
(4) The Chinese Communist Party has 
threatened to leverage the People’s Republic 
of China’s dominant position in the rare 
earth market to ‘‘strike back’’ at the United 
States. 
(5) The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue is 
an effective partnership for reliable multi-
lateral financing, development, and distribu-
tion of goods for global consumption, as evi-
denced by the Quad Vaccine Partnership an-
nounced on March 12, 2021. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) the People’s Republic of China’s domi-
nant share of the global rare earth mining 
market is a threat to the economic stability, 
well being, and competitiveness of key in-
dustries in the United States; 
(2) the United States should reduce reli-
ance on the People’s Republic of China for 
rare earth minerals through— 
(A) strategic investments in development 
projects, production technologies, and refin-
ing facilities in the United States; or 
(B) in partnership with strategic allies of 
the United States that are reliable trading 
partners, including members of the Quad-
rilateral Security Dialogue; and 
(3) the United States Trade Representative 
should initiate multilateral talks among the 
countries of the Quadrilateral Security Dia-
logue to promote shared investment and de-
velopment of rare earth minerals. 
(c) REPORT REQUIRED.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 120 days 
after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
the United States Trade Representative, in 
consultation with the officials specified in 
paragraph (3), shall submit to the appro-
priate congressional committees a report on 
the work of the Trade Representative to ad-
dress the national security threat posed by 
the People’s Republic of China’s control of 
nearly 2⁄3 of the global supply of rare earth 
minerals. 
(2) ELEMENTS.—The report required by 
paragraph (1) shall include— 
(A) a description of the extent of the en-
gagement of the United States with the 
other countries of the Quadrilateral Security 
Dialogue to promote shared investment and 
development of rare earth minerals during 
the period beginning on the date of the en-
actment of this Act and ending on the date 
of the report; and 
(B) a description of the plans of the Presi-
dent to leverage the partnership of the coun-
tries of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue 
to produce a more reliable and secure global 
supply chain of rare earth minerals. 
(3) OFFICIALS SPECIFIED.—The official speci-
fied in this paragraph are the following: 
(A) The Secretary of State. 
(B) the Secretary of Commerce. 
(C) The Chief Executive Officer of the 
United States International Development Fi-
nance Corporation. 
(4) APPROPRIATE
CONGRESSIONAL
COMMIT-
TEES DEFINED.—In this subsection, the term 
‘‘appropriate 
congressional 
committees’’ 
means—

mittee on Foreign Relations, and the Com-
mittee on Energy and Natural Resources of

the following: 
SEC. 1253. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON INCREASING 
PORT AND AIRFIELD CAPACITY OF 
COUNTRIES IN INDO-PACIFIC RE-
GION. 
It is the sense of Congress that, as the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China continues to grow in 
influence through infrastructure (specifi-
cally infrastructure that can easily be shift-
ed from economic to military uses), the 
United States International Development Fi-
nance Corporation should prioritize pro-
viding alternative financing opportunities 
that increase port and air field capacity of 
countries throughout the Indo-Pacific region 
that— 
(1) are targets of the predatory infrastruc-
ture development scheme of the People’s Re-
public of China; and 
(2) are eligible for support provided by the 
Corporation under title II of the Better Utili-
zation of Investments Leading to Develop-
ment Act of 2018 (22 U.S.C. 9621 et seq.).

It is the sense of Congress that— 
(1) ongoing efforts by the government of 
President Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua to sup-
press the voice and actions of political oppo-
nents through intimidation and unlawful de-
tainment, civil society, and independent 
news media violate the fundamental free-
doms and basic human rights of the people of 
Nicaragua; 
(2) Congress unequivocally condemns the 
politically motivated and unlawful detention 
of 
presidential 
candidates 
Cristiana 
Chamorro, Arturo Cruz, Felix Maradiaga, 
and Juan Sebastian Chamorro; 
(3) Congress unequivocally condemns the 
passage of the Foreign Agents Regulation 
Law, the Special Cybercrimes Law, the Self- 
Determination Law, and the Consumer Pro-
tection Law by the National Assembly of 
Nicaragua, which represent clear attempts 
by the Ortega government to curtail the fun-
damental freedoms and basic human rights 
of the people of Nicaragua; 
(4) Congress recognizes that free, fair, and 
transparent elections predicated on robust 
reform measures and the presence of domes-
tic and international observers represent the 
best opportunity for the people of Nicaragua 
to restore democracy and reach a peaceful 
solution to the political and social crisis in 
Nicaragua; 
(5) the United States recognizes the right 
of the people of Nicaragua to freely deter-
mine their own political future as vital to 
ensuring the sustainable restoration of de-
mocracy in their country; 
(6) the United States should align the use 
of diplomatic engagement and all other for-
eign policy tools, including the use of tar-
geted sanctions, in support of efforts by 
democratic political actors and civil society 
in Nicaragua to advance the necessary condi-
tions for free, fair, and transparent elections 
in Nicaragua; 
(7) the United States, in order to maximize 
the effectiveness of efforts described in para-
graph (6), should— 
(A) coordinate with diplomatic partners, 
including the Government of Canada, the Eu-
ropean Union, and partners in Latin America 
and the Caribbean; 
(B) advance diplomatic initiatives in con-
sultation with the Organization of American 
States and the United Nations; and 
(C) thoroughly investigate the assets and 
holdings of the Nicaraguan Armed Forces in 
the United States and consider appropriate 
actions to hold such forces accountable for 
gross violations of human rights; and 
(8) pursuant to section 6(b) of the Nica-
ragua Investment Conditionality Act of 2018, 
the President should waive the application of 
restrictions under section 4 of that Act and 
the sanctions under section 5 of that Act if 
the Secretary of State certifies that the Gov-
ernment of Nicaragua is taking the steps 
identified in section 6(a) of that Act, includ-
ing taking steps to ‘‘to hold free and fair 
elections overseen by credible domestic and 
international observers’’. 
SEC. 3. REVIEW OF PARTICIPATION OF NICA-
RAGUA IN DOMINICAN REPUBLIC- 
CENTRAL AMERICA-UNITED STATES 
FREE TRADE AGREEMENT. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) On November 27, 2018, the President 
signed Executive Order 13851 (50 U.S.C. 1701 
note; relating to blocking property of certain 
persons contributing to the situation in 
Nicaragua), which stated that ‘‘the situation 
in Nicaragua, including the violent response 
by the Government of Nicaragua to the pro-
tests that began on April 18, 2018, and the Or-
tega regime’s systematic dismantling and 
undermining of democratic institutions and 
the rule of law, its use of indiscriminate vio-
lence and repressive tactics against civil-
ians, as well as its corruption leading to the 
destabilization of Nicaragua’s economy, con-
stitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat 
to the national security and foreign policy of 
the United States’’. 
(2) Article 21.2 of the Dominican Republic- 
Central America-United States Free Trade 
Agreement approved by Congress under sec-
tion 101(a)(1) of the Dominican Republic-Cen-
tral 
America-United

Party from applying measures that it con-
siders necessary for the fulfillment of its ob-
ligations with respect to the maintenance or 
restoration of international peace or secu-
rity, or the protection of its own essential 
security interests.’’. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that the President should review 
the continued participation of Nicaragua in 
the Dominican Republic-Central America- 
United States Free Trade Agreement if the 
Government of Nicaragua continues to tight-

f 
THE MIDDLE EAST 
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I rise 
today to discuss the growing threats to 
American national security and to the 
security of our friends and allies in the 
Middle East. 
Under President Obama and Vice 
President Biden, the policies put in 
place were a catastrophe for our allies 
in the Middle East and a boon to our 
enemies. They boosted the Muslim 
Brotherhood and criticized Arab gov-
ernments that tried to crack down on 
religious extremists. They gave Pales-
tinian groups tied to terrorism a veto 
over peace between our Israeli and 
Arab allies, and they elevated those 
groups. 
They 
pushed 
the 
catastrophic 
Obama-Iran nuclear deal, which dis-
mantled pressure on Iran and put the 
Ayatollah on a path towards a nuclear 
arsenal, while sending pallets of cash 
in the dead of night as ransom for hos-
tages. 
Of course, the Obama-Biden adminis-
tration didn’t tell the American people 
and didn’t tell Congress what they 
were doing. Instead, they deliberately 
hid that information. They lied as long 
as they could about their policies, and 
they developed and built an echo cham-
ber designed to drown out their critics. 
I rise today because history is repeat-
ing itself, because I am deeply worried 
that President Biden and the Biden- 
Harris administration are returning to 
the very worst policies and the very 
worst tactics of the Obama years and 
that the consequences are going to be 
far worse. 
Once again, the Biden-Harris admin-
istration is boosting the Muslim Broth-
erhood and other religious extremist 
groups in the Middle East. They are 
elevating the Palestinians at the ex-
pense of our Israeli and Arab allies, and 
they are dismantling pressure on Iran. 
And, once again, they are hiding 
those details from Congress. They do 
not want Congress to know, and they 
do not want the American people to 
know. And, in some cases, unfortu-
nately, they are outright lying. 
I know that President Biden and his 
administration are refusing to answer, 
even lying about their Middle East 
policies, because I asked them. I asked 
them as part of questioning Barbara 
Leaf, the President’s nominee to be the 
Assistant Secretary of State for Near 
East Affairs. 
Over the next several minutes, I will 
discuss the answers I got back. 
Ms. Leaf has been—and will continue 
to be—at the center of the Biden-Harris 
administration’s Middle East policy. 
She was responsible for Middle East 
policy from the very beginning of this 
administration as the senior director 
for Middle East and North African Af-
fairs at the National Security Council. 
In her new position to which she has 
been nominated, she would be Amer-
ica’s most senior diplomat for the Mid-
dle East. 
I asked Ms. Leaf written questions 
about Biden’s administration’s policies 
in multiple areas of Middle East policy, 
as part of her testimony in front of the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
Her answers ranged from deliberately 
nonresponsive to simply false and, 
throughout, thoroughly, deeply dis-
tressing. 
For example, right now, today, the 
Biden-Harris administration is with-
holding $130 million of assistance for 
security and counterterrorism from 
our 
Egyptian 
allies, 
allegedly 
on 
human rights concerns. What we don’t 
know is exactly why they are doing it 
and exactly what the Biden-Harris ad-
ministration is asking for. 
Under the Obama administration, the 
United States repeatedly, inexplicably 
boosted 
the 
Muslim 
Brotherhood, 
which 
openly 
advocated 
terrorism 
against the United States. Those ex-
tremists were boosted at the expense of 
moderate Arab allies, and they consist-
ently misled the public about their 
goals. 
Here, the only reason the American 
public found out in the first place 
about this $130 million is because the 
Washington 
Post 
revealed 
it. 
The 
Biden-Harris administration didn’t ex-
plain to the American people what 
they were doing. It was only the re-
porting of journalists that revealed it, 
and we still don’t know enough. We 
don’t know the details. 
The Post reported that the adminis-
tration is withholding the aid until 
Egypt addresses certain human rights 
concerns. We don’t know what they 
are. They apparently include releasing 
16 unnamed prisoners. We don’t know 
who they are. 
So I asked Ms. Leaf about these de-
tails. I asked about the 16 people. I 
asked for their names, their institu-
tional affiliations, what they were 
charged with. I also asked if they were 
American citizens. And if they were 
not, I asked whether they were in-
volved in organizations that push Is-
lamic extremism or anti-Semitism. 
Ms. Leaf is obviously very familiar 
with the case. She wrote back over 
1,000 words of highly technical re-
sponses. Here is just a third of her an-
swer. That is the part we could fit on 
the poster board. Lots of words, lots of 
numbers, but, as you can see, not a sin-
gle detail that I requested was pro-
vided. 
Of the 16 people the Biden-Harris ad-
ministration is demanding that Egypt 
release, you will see not a single 
name—not a one. Congress doesn’t get 
to know who those 16 people are. The 
American people don’t get to know who 
those 16 people are. The answer from 
Ms. Leaf to the Senate Foreign Rela-
tions Committee is, to not put too fine 
a point on it, Go jump in a lake.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7573 
November 1, 2021 
How many of those 16 are affiliated 
with terrorist organizations? 
The answer from Ms. Leaf: Go jump 
in a lake. 
How many of them are American 
citizens? 
The answer from Ms. Leaf: Go jump 
in a lake. 
Why is that? Why is that—that the 
Biden-Harris administration is extort-
ing Egypt to release 16 prisoners, and 
yet they are embarrassed to say who 
those prisoners are? 
Well, we do have some public hints 
about the sort of people that the White 
House and the congressional Demo-
crats maybe tried to coerce our Egyp-
tian allies into releasing. Buried inside 
a very recent Senate appropriations re-
port, there is an instruction that seems 
very much like what we are seeing 
with these secret conditions. It came 
presumably from Senate Democrats, 
although we don’t know who. No Sen-
ate Democrat has stood forward to own 
this language, but there is a Senate 
Democrat who authored this language. 
It says: 
In making the certification required by 
subsection (a)(3)(A), the Secretary of State 
shall consider the cases of Ola Al-Qaradawi, 
Hosam Khalaf, Salah Soltan, Abdulrahman 
Tarek, and Mohamed El-Baqer. The Com-
mittee urges that humane treatment and 
fair trials be afforded these and other pris-
oners in Egypt. 
So, apparently, for some unnamed 
Democrat who is unwilling to put his 
or her name to it, these names are peo-
ple the United States should champion, 
and it suggests the sorts of people the 
Biden-Harris administration may be 
trying to extort Egypt into releasing. 
Who are they? 
Well, let’s start with Salah Soltan. 
Who is Salah Soltan? He is a Muslim 
Brotherhood propagandist. He is a hate 
preacher. He is someone who goes on 
TV over and over again and preaches 
the most vicious sorts of libel against 
Jews. 
Why are Senate Democrats trying to 
release vicious anti-Semites? If you go 
back to the appropriation language, 
why are they suggesting in the appro-
priation language that the United 
States should be fighting to release 
that anti-Semite and hate preacher? 
We don’t know because Senate Demo-
crats aren’t defending that position, 
and the administration refuses to an-
swer. 
Who are some of the other people on 
that list? 
Well, you have Mohamed El-Baqer. 
He was a Salafist youth activist. He 
was part of the Revolutionary Youth 
who started the revolution, and he has 
been implicated in security violations. 
How about Ola al-Qaradawi? She is 
the daughter of Yosef al-Qaradawi, who 
is one of the major voices for jihad in-
side the Muslim Brotherhood. The 
paper trail on her is deliberately 
opaque from both sides. 
How about Hosam Khalaf? He is Ola 
al-Qaradawi’s husband, and he has been 
allegedly connected to a Muslim Broth-
erhood offshoot. 
How 
about 
Abdulrahman 
Tarek? 
Well, we don’t know. His presence has 
not been accounted for publicly. 
And yet these names mysteriously 
appear in a Senate appropriations re-
port. When I asked Ms. Leaf about it, 
she provided 1,000 words and not a sin-
gle name. 
And I will tell you that, actually, the 
names on that list are not secrets from 
Congress. They have been provided to 
Congress in a classified form. So the 
Presiding Officer and I can go into a se-
cure SCIF, and we can read it in the 
SCIF. We can read the names. 
You know what we are not allowed to 
do? 
Tell anyone what the names are. 
Why is it that those names are classi-
fied? 
They are classified because President 
Biden and Vice President HARRIS don’t 
want the American people to know who 
it is they are trying to release. 
There is no reasonable justification 
for those names to be classified. They 
are extorting our friend and ally, 
Egypt, to get 16 people released from 
jail, and they refuse to tell us who. 
The American people have a right to 
know if the Biden administration is 
trying to pressure our allies to release 
Muslim Brotherhood extremists; if the 
Biden administration is trying to get 
our allies to release anti-Semites; and, 
if they are, to hear a justification for 
why. But Ms. Leaf, instead, simply de-
fies the Senate and refuses to answer. 
Let’s turn now to Israel. 
During the Trump administration, 
there was a decision to stand shoulder 
to shoulder with Israel, which led to an 
historic flowering of peace across the 
region. The name and framework for 
those peace agreements was the Abra-
ham Accords. 
This was something that the Obama 
administration said would never hap-
pen 
and 
something, 
unfortunately, 
tragically, that they were actively hos-
tile to. The Obama administration in-
sisted that Israel would have to make 
massive concessions to the Palestin-
ians on their sovereignty—on the secu-
rity of Israel—before there could ever 
be peace deals between the Israelis and 
their Arab neighbors. 
When asked whether there could ever 
be peace like the Abraham Accords 
without a prior deal with the Palestin-
ians, then-Secretary of State John 
Kerry said: ‘‘There will be no separate 
peace between Israel and the Arab 
world. . . . No, no, no, and no.’’ 
No ambiguity to what they thought— 
they don’t want peace without massive 
concessions from Israel to the Palestin-
ians. 
Well, turned out President Obama 
and Secretary Kerry were tragically 
wrong, as they were on so many issues, 
and President Trump demonstrated 
that to the world. And, sadly, Presi-
dent Biden and Vice President HARRIS 
have never forgiven our Israeli allies 
and our Arab allies for that—for dem-
onstrating that with strong, resolute 
clarity from the United States’ un-
equivocal support of Israel, that peace 
could be the result. That was an out-
come anathema to the foreign policy 
objectives of the current administra-
tion. As a result, there are many in the 
Biden administration that are enor-
mously, deeply, seethingly hostile to 
the Abraham Accords. 
At the beginning of the Biden admin-
istration, the State Department even 
issued internal guidance prohibiting 
the use of the phrase ‘‘Abraham Ac-
cords.’’ Those words were verboten. 
You may not say those words. The in-
structions were instead to call them 
the ‘‘normalization agreements.’’ 
George Orwell is, no doubt, looking 
down from Heaven and smiling at the 
power of language to be redefined. 
There are no Abraham Accords. Now, 
they are normalization agreements. 
Once again, the only reason that the 
public knows about this is because 
journalists revealed it. This time, it 
was the ‘‘Washington Free Beacon,’’ 
but the details have never been clari-
fied. 
After those public reports, the Biden 
administration was forced to at least 
partially reverse that policy. They in-
sisted they fully support the accords 
that must never be named. But it is not 
clear how true or how broad that rever-
sal has been. 
On September 13, U.S. Ambassador to 
the U.N., Thomas-Greenfield, gave a 
speech about the Abraham Accords in 
which she stubbornly refused to utter 
the words ‘‘Abraham Accords.’’ In-
stead, following, apparently, the State 
Department guidance, she simply used 
the bland term ‘‘normalization agree-
ments.’’ 
On October 13, Secretary Blinken 
met with Foreign Minister Lapid, and 
the spokesperson issued a formal read-
out from that meeting. Once again, the 
formal readout from the State Depart-
ment carefully eschewed any mention 
of the Abraham Accords and used the 
bland term ‘‘regional normalization ef-
forts.’’ 
This is conscious. This is deliberate. 
This is a pattern. It is a classic exam-
ple of where congressional oversight is 
called for. 
Madam 
President, 
many 
Senate 
Democrats claim to support the Abra-
ham Accords. Now, I would note, I was 
at the White House for the signing of 
the Abraham Accords. Not a single 
Senate Democrat showed up for that 
historic peace agreement—none. Pre-
sumably because of partisan loathing 
of President Trump. But, nonetheless, 
congressional Democrats say they sup-
port the accords today. If that is true, 
we need to see congressional oversight. 
So I asked Ms. Leaf for the specific 
guidance that was issued to the State 
Department. Give Congress—give the 
Senate—the written guidance prohib-
iting reference to the Abraham Ac-
cords. We know about it from public re-
ports in the media. She and the State 
Department refused. They refused to 
provide that guidance to Congress. 
They refused to show it to the public. 
And, in doing it, it is not accidental.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7574 
November 1, 2021 
She refuses to answer this question 
because they want to hide it from the 
American people, just like the names 
of the 16 prisoners they are demanding 
that Egypt release. Presumably, if the 
American people knew those names, 
knew the affiliations, knew the back-
grounds, they would be outraged. Like-
wise, if the American people read the 
written guidance issued by this State 
Department, prohibiting uttering of 
the words ‘‘Abraham Accords,’’ then 
the charade so many Democrats try to 
play in supporting those accords would 
be that much harder to maintain. 
A third example, turning to Iran, per-
haps more than anything else, first and 
foremost, this administration wants to 
return to the catastrophic Obama- 
Biden-Iran nuclear deal and to dis-
mantle meaningful sanctions against 
the theocratic regime in Iran. From 
the earliest hours of the administra-
tion, the effort began to do exactly 
that. 
As part of that push, the administra-
tion has quietly, and sometimes se-
cretly, reduced pressure on Iran and re-
leased frozen Iranian funds. But the 
Ayatollah wants to see just how much 
he can get, and he may not think that 
President Biden will ever do anything 
meaningful. If the United States isn’t 
going to impose pressure on Iran, there 
is no reason for the Ayatollah to return 
to the deal at all. He doesn’t need to 
take ‘‘yes’’ for an answer for a deal be-
cause he is getting everything anyway. 
And so since very early in the admin-
istration, the Biden-Harris officials 
have contemplated what has been 
called a ‘‘less for less’’ agreement in 
which they would reduce some pressure 
on Iran for something less than full 
compliance. You will only nuke some 
of us. 
Once again, we only know about the 
existence of these considerations from 
public reports. In February and again 
over the summer, Reuters reported on 
administration officials contemplating 
these deals, the so-called ‘‘less for less’’ 
deals. We here in Congress know a lit-
tle more but not much. 
Congress and the public deserve to 
know what is being contemplated to re-
duce pressure on the Iranian regime, 
the world’s leading state sponsor of 
terrorism and a regime that seeks— 
and, I believe, may well be willing—to 
use nuclear weapons to murder mil-
lions of Americans and millions of our 
allies. 
I believe that if the Ayatollah had 
the ability to murder millions of Amer-
icans or millions of Israelis in the 
blink of an eye, the odds are far too 
high that this theocratic zealot, who 
glories in death and suicide, would be 
willing to do so. 
And so I asked Ms. Leaf for the de-
tails of such agreements. Here is what 
she said in response: 
There have been no such arrangements, 
deals, or agreements contemplated to reduce 
pressure on Iran. 
That statement is false. It is cat-
egorically, 
directly, 
unequivocally 
false. It is false testimony in writing to 
the Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee. Ms. Leaf knows it is false, and 
the State Department handlers who 
transmitted her written answer to the 
Senate know that it is false. 
What is the Biden administration 
trying to hide? What deep details don’t 
they want us to know? 
This isn’t just about policy disagree-
ments, although I disagree vehemently 
with many of this administration’s 
policies. I understand some people, 
some Democrats, will disagree. But 
even more fundamentally, this is about 
transparency and oversight. On that, 
there should be no disagreement. 
And these questions are ones that go 
to the very core of this administra-
tion’s Middle East foreign policy and of 
American national security. What ex-
tremists are President Biden and Vice 
President HARRIS trying to empower? 
Whom do they view as allies worth sup-
porting in the region? What deals are 
being contemplated with the Iranian 
regime? 
I asked Ms. Leaf for these details. 
She has, after all, been working right 
in the center of Middle East issues for 
this 
administration. 
She 
and 
the 
Biden-Harris administration are refus-
ing to answer. The public has a right to 
know. 
Let me also point out that President 
Biden, in recent days, said publicly 
that if Iran enters into a new nuclear 
deal, the United States would stay 
bound by it in perpetuity as long as 
Iran didn’t renege on that deal. I want 
to be absolutely clear on something: 
President Biden has zero constitutional 
authority to make that commitment. 
The Ayatollah in Iran could be for-
given for misunderstanding that. The 
Ayatollah, after all, is a total dictator 
with the ability to line up anyone who 
disagrees and execute them on the 
spot. But, thankfully, the President of 
the United States does not enjoy such 
dictatorial powers. 
Under our Constitution, there are 
two ways, and two ways only, that a 
President can make a binding commit-
ment on the United States of America. 
The first is through passing a law that 
passes the Senate, passes the House, 
and is signed into law by the President. 
If President Biden wishes to do so with 
any Iran deal, he is welcome to do so. 
The second and the way, tradition-
ally, that foreign policies agreements 
are handled is through a treaty—a 
treaty that is submitted to the Senate 
and ratified by two-thirds of the Sen-
ate. The chances that the Biden-Harris 
whatever disastrous nuclear deal they 
work out with Iran, the chances that 
that would be ratified by two-thirds of 
the Senate I can quantify exactly. 
There is 0.00 percent. 
President 
Biden 
knows 
that. 
He 
knows that because the Senate has 
been unequivocal that this deal is dis-
astrous and harmful for American na-
tional security, harmful for Israel, and 
harmful for our allies. And so, instead, 
President Biden makes an empty prom-
ise that he cannot commit. 
In that, he is following in the foot-
steps of President Obama. President 
Obama made a similar promise, and 
President Obama knew it was a lie 
when he said it, and President Biden 
knows it is a lie when he says it. 
History demonstrated that President 
Obama told a falsehood because the 
next Republican President, Donald J. 
Trump, ripped the Obama-Iran deal to 
shreds and withdrew from the deal, 
which was the right decision. I urged 
President Trump to do that. 
Our allies and our enemies should 
mark my words on this: Regardless of 
whatever empty promises President 
Biden makes, he lacks constitutional 
authority to bind a subsequent admin-
istration. And I believe it is 100 percent 
certain that the next Republican Presi-
dent who is sworn into office will once 
again rip to shreds any disastrous deal 
negotiated with the Ayatollah and 
Iran. 
So President Biden has 3 more years 
to try to give away the store, to try to 
send billions of dollars, perhaps on pal-
lets in the dead of night like Barack 
Obama did, to fund theocratic terror-
ists who want to murder Americans 
and murder Israelis. But the Ayatollah 
needs to know, Europe needs to know, 
our friends need to know, our enemies 
need to know that President Biden’s 
promises are empty words that will ex-
pire the instant his Presidency is over. 
We don’t have a dictator in this 
country. We have a constitutional re-
public. If President Biden wants to 
bind subsequent administrations, he 
can negotiate a treaty, submit a treaty 
to the Senate, and get it ratified. But 
he doesn’t have the votes, and so in-
stead he makes empty promises. 
If President Biden and Vice President 
HARRIS were proud of the policies they 
are pursuing in the Middle East, they 
would give the American people the 
list of the 16 prisoners they are trying 
to force Egypt to release. 
We know that multiple of the names 
Senate Democrats have put in the ap-
propriations language are affiliated 
with the Muslim Brotherhood. We 
know one is an anti-Semitic hate 
preacher. And we suspect that the ad-
ministration knows full well that if it 
released those names, it couldn’t de-
fend them to the American people. It is 
counting on darkness and secrecy to 
hide their conduct. 
I believe the Senate—both Repub-
licans and Democrats—have an obliga-
tion to the American people to shine a 
light. If you are going to extort our al-
lies to release prisoners, tell us now: 
Are they affiliated with the Muslim 
Brotherhood? Are they anti-Semites? 
Are they a national security threat to 
the United States or our allies? The 
American people deserve to know. 
I yield the floor.

LITTLE MISS OCEAN CITY 
PAGEANT: SISTER SUCCESSION 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 1, 2021 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, the 
COVID–19 pandemic put a halt to most of the 
traditions that we South Jerseyans enjoy, but 
now we’re back, we’re on track, and we’re 
moving forward. The Little Miss Ocean City 
Pageant was able to make its long-awaited 
comeback this summer, and in typical South 
Jersey fashion, history was made. Prior to the 
pandemic, Antonella Di Antonio was crowned 
Little Miss Ocean City, but this year, in perfect 
comeback fashion, Antonella had the privilege 
of crowing her successor, her younger sister, 
Arianna. This isn’t the first time that sisters 
won the coveted Little Miss Ocean City title, 
however, this is the first time, in the history of 
the O.C pageant that one sister crowned the 
other. I want to congratulate both of them for 
making history, both in their community and in 
South Jersey as well. Congratulations to 
Arianna Di Antonio for being crowned this 
year’s Little Miss Ocean City, a stellar accom-
plishment of which she should be proud. God 
Bless both of them and all the contestants of 
the Little Miss Ocean City Pageant, and God 
Bless America.

RECOGNIZING 
SPECIALIST 
KEN 
TAYLOR, RECIPIENT OF TEXAS’ 
THIRD 
CONGRESSIONAL 
DIS-
TRICT 2021 CONGRESSIONAL VET-
ERAN COMMENDATION 
HON. VAN TAYLOR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 1, 2021 
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, today, it is 
my privilege to honor fifteen distinguished mili-
tary veterans from Texas’ Third Congressional 
District who answered the call to serve their 
Nation honorably, both in uniform and fol-
lowing their return to civilian life. The recipi-
ents of the 2021 Congressional Veteran Com-
mendation exemplify the time-honored quali-
ties of patriotism, service before self, and bold 
leadership. Following their time in service, 
their efforts in our community have earned 
these fine individuals recognition as the recipi-
ents of this prestigious commendation. Their 
stories of sacrifice will encourage future gen-
erations to pursue a life dedicated to the very 
values we cherish as Americans: faith, free-
dom, and democracy. One such hero is Spe-
cialist Ken Taylor of Plano, Texas. 
In 1968, Dallas native, Ken Taylor, began 
his journey of service by enlisting in the United 
States Army. Following completion of basic 
training at Fort Polk, Taylor would later be sta-
tioned at Fort Bragg and Fort Hood where he 
was attached to the 82nd Airborne Division 
and the 1st Armed Division Artillery. 
For his service, Specialist Taylor received 
the National Defense Service Medal. 
Upon returning to civilian life, Ken obtained 
a position as the sports editor for the Grand 
Prairie Daily News. Despite the rigors of his 
job, 
he 
would 
also 
concurrently 
attend 
Eastfield College utilizing GI Bill benefits to 
earn his Associate’s degree. In 1972, Mr. Tay-
lor founded the Traveling Classic Bowling As-
sociation, the world’s largest league, in order 
to give bowlers the opportunity to bowl in a 
well-organized traveling league with financial 
incentives. Ken would later go on to found 
marketing company, Outback Secrets Inter-
national prior to his retirement. 
Today, Ken volunteers tirelessly on behalf of 
area veterans through his involvement in sev-
eral organizations. Taylor assists individuals in 
navigating the complexities of applying for vet-
erans benefits through his work as a service 
officer for American Legion Post 321. Addition-
ally, he is an active member of the Collin 
County Veterans Coalition (CCVC), where he 
was appointed to the Legislative Committee. 
In his role with CCVC Ken has advocated for 
property tax relief for disabled veterans in the 
State Legislature. 
Ken and his wife, Sharon, are the proud 
parents of son, Kevin. Specialist Ken Taylor 
demonstrates the qualities of a patriot who 
has selflessly served our nation and continues 
to give back within our community. 
Today a grateful Nation thanks Specialist 
Taylor for his exceptional service and con-
gratulates him on this recognition. May his 
steadfast example of leadership inspire others 
to live a life of service to a cause greater than 
themselves. It is my extreme honor to award 
him the 2021 Congressional Veteran Com-
mendation for the Third District of Texas.

BRIAN BATZ 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 1, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Brian Batz, an Adams 12 
Board of Education member on his years of 
service to the Adams 12 School District. 
Brian has been a Board Member of Adams 
12 since 2015, and during his tenure, he 
served as Director of Ward 4. He previously 
served the Adams 12 community through the 
Thornton High School IB Parents Group as a 
board member. He also served as a flag foot-
ball and soccer coach. 
Brian’s dedication to the Adams 12 commu-
nity follows a history of him serving his com-
munity. He has served on the Thornton Citizen 
Police Academy, as a Thornton Water Ambas-
sador, a IT/video/photo assistant to the 
Northglenn United Methodist Church, a board 
member for the Burgundy HOA community, 
and a Denver north photographer for the 
Rocky Mountain Cocker Rescue. In addition to 
his contributions to the community, he is a lov-
ing husband and devoted parent to three chil-
dren. 
His dedication to the Adams 12 School Dis-
trict and the larger community has been tre-
mendous, and I extend gratitude for his serv-
ice to the Adams 12 community and the great 
State of Colorado. I wish Brian Batz all the 
best in his future endeavors.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF MR. JAMES CHARLIE LANE 
HON. DIANA HARSHBARGER 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 1, 2021 
Mrs. HARSHBARGER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to recognize the life and service of Mr. 
James Charlie Lane of White Pine, Ten-
nessee. J.C. was born on April 30, 1920 and 
celebrated his 101st birthday on April 30, 
2021. 
He was a Veteran of WWII and served in 
the Navy from March 1941 to August 1946. 
From 1940 to March 1941, he was an em-
ployee of the Civilian Conservation Corps in 
both Unicoi and the Sugarlands in his birth 
county, Sevier County. 
He volunteered and joined the Navy in 
March 1941 and was assigned to the USS Al-
bemarle, where he would qualify as an elec-
trician and would eventually be promoted to 
electrician first class. Volunteering for a new 
ship that was commissioned, he became a 
‘‘plank owner’’ on the Wasp by being one of 
the original crewmen. By 1944, the Wasp’s 
battles would include the islands of Marcus, 
Wake, Saipan, Tinian, Guam, Iwo Jima, Oki-
nawa, Leyte Gulf and the Japanese homeland. 
He arrived in Hawaii and then went to the 
Marshall Islands in May and saw his first ac-
tion in the Marshall Islands as part of Admiral 
Halsey’s fast carrier fleet at the Marianas. Dur-
ing his time in the Navy, he saw action in the 
European Theater, to the African Coast, to the 
Pacific Theater in the Philippines and the five- 
week long battle for Iwo Jima. His military 
service went on until almost a year after Armi-
stice Day when Japan formally surrendered as 
his ship brought soldiers back from Italy and 
England. He retired as a Chief Petty Officer. 
Upon returning to Tennessee, he settled in 
Sevier County for a short period, then upon 
getting a job at American Enka, he moved to 
White Pine in 1951. He retired from American 
Enka after thirty-six years. 
J.C.’s legacy of love includes his marriage 
to his wife, Ruth, of forty-nine years until she 
passed in July 1992, and his children who are 
so proud of his service, Rita Lane Potter, and 
Betty Jo Lane Moore. He has three grand-
children and four great grandsons. 
Madam Speaker, James Charlie Lane faith-
fully served his country under the most difficult 
situations possible, and all a WWII Veteran 
and member of the United States Navy, and I 
proudly honor his legacy and service to the 
United States of America.

CHAD CALLAHAN—EAGLE SCOUT 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 1, 2021 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, last 
month, I had the pleasure of presenting Chad 
Callahan his Eagle Scout Court of Honor. 
Chad is a graduate of Ocean City High School 
and is currently studying physics at the Uni-
versity of South Carolina. Chad joined cub 
scouts in 2nd grade and has been active in 
the Scouts ever since. Chad’s Eagle project 
was building benches for the local VFW to 
commemorate his grandfather along with all 
fallen soldiers. Not only did he commemorate 
our nation’s greatest, but he also provided 
members a space to meet outside during the 
pandemic. This young man should be proud of 
his accomplishments and it was my honor to 
have the opportunity to recognize him for his 
service to the South Jersey community. God 
Bless Chad and God Bless America.

HONORING KENNETH FANNON 
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 1, 2021 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I offer 
these remarks in honor of Kenneth Gene 
Fannon of Duffield in Scott County, Virginia, 
who passed away on October 10, 2021 at the 
age of 90. I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. 
Fannon. He was a veteran and a well-known 
community leader in Duffield. 
Mr. Fannon was born in Lee County, Vir-
ginia on May 15, 1931. He was a graduate of 
Rye Cove High School and Whitney Business 
College. Mr. Fannon served in the United 
States Army as a Corporal during the Korean 
War. He later became the Commander of 
Chapter 250 of the Korean War Veteran’s As-
sociation. 
He was a trailblazer for community service 
activities and veterans’ events in Scott County. 
Over the years, he also served as Scout Mas-
ter and as a member of numerous local board 
of directors. He was often recognized for es-
tablishing Duffield Daze, Duffield’s largest 
service event. He started it in 1981 as a way 
to give back to the community through a fam-
ily-friendly affair that promoted town unity and 
local business support. 
Every time I attended Duffield Daze, Mr. 
Fannon was there to welcome me. He often 
reached out to my office to advocate for vet-
erans in the area. He greeted everyone with 
kindness and generosity. Mr. Fannon was a 
tireless volunteer that worked hard to make 
his community and country a better place. He 
was a staple of so many community endeav-
ors. Mr. Fannon was esteemed by many and 
will be greatly missed. 
Mr. Fannon was preceded in death by his 
parents, E.D. and Venus Fannon; brothers, 
Jack and Joe; and sister, Mary Allen. He is 
survived by his wife, Jean; son, Jack and wife 
Susan; daughter, Lori Green and husband 
Daniel; grandchildren, Ruston Fannon, Kevin 
Wade, and Leslie Guy; great-grandsons, Jack-
son Guy and Mason Wade; sister, June 
Fannon, and sister-in-law, Helen Lane. I offer 
them my condolences on the loss of this good 
man.

OF 
TEXAS’ THIRD CONGRESSIONAL 
DISTRICT 
2021 
CONGRESSIONAL 
VETERAN COMMENDATION 
HON. VAN TAYLOR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 1, 2021 
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, today, it is 
my privilege to honor fifteen distinguished mili-
tary veterans from Texas’ Third Congressional 
District who answered the call to serve their 
Nation honorably, both in uniform and fol-
lowing their return to civilian life. The recipi-
ents of the 2021 Congressional Veteran Com-
mendation exemplify the time-honored quali-
ties of patriotism, service before self, and bold 
leadership. Following their time in service, 
their efforts in our community have earned 
these fine individuals recognition as the recipi-
ents of this prestigious commendation. Their 
stories of sacrifice will encourage future gen-
erations to pursue a life dedicated to the very 
values we cherish as Americans: faith, free-
dom, and democracy. One such hero is Ser-
geant Gerald Schlosser of Princeton, Texas. 
Gerald Schlosser was born and raised in 
Jersey City, New Jersey, only about a mile 
from the World Trade Center. Growing up, 
Gerald was strongly influenced by his uncle, a 
firefighter for the New York/New Jersey Port 
Authority and a First Responder to the 9/11 at-
tacks, who instilled in him a sense of duty and 
service. In 2003, while playing college base-
ball, Schlosser felt called to enlist in the 
United States Army. Following Basic Combat 
Training at Fort Benning, Schlosser was de-
ployed to combat operations in the Global War 
on Terrorism. He would complete multiple 
combat deployments to the Middle East, hold-
ing positions including rifleman, team leader, 
and squad leader. 
For his efforts, Sergeant Schlosser would 
earn the Afghanistan Campaign Medal with 2 
Campaign Stars, Army Commendation Medal, 
Army Achievement Medal, Army Superior Unit 
Award, Army Good Conduct Medal, and the 
Global War on Terrorism Service Medal. Addi-
tionally, Schlosser was awarded a Purple 
Heart following the rocket ambush of his 
team’s Humvee in Afghanistan during which 
time he rescued his fellow injured soldiers 
from the wreckage, sustaining multiple gun-
shot wounds from enemy fighters. 
Following his retirement in 2013, Schlosser 
began a career as a firefighter, working his 
way up to Captain in the New Llano Fire De-
partment. He went on to earn his paramedic li-
cense and board certification as a Tactical 
Combat Casualty Care Provider and instructor. 
His love for Tactical Medicine and desire to 
become a SWAT medic led him to the Police 
Academy and a position with the Cherokee 
County 
Sheriff’s 
Office. 
Today, 
Officer 
Schlosser serves the City of Princeton as a 
patrol officer, Field Training Officer, Instructor, 
and Drug Recognition Expert. Sergeant Gerald 
Schlosser has served our nation and commu-
nity with distinction and we are honored to 
recognize him with this award. 
Today a grateful Nation thanks Sergeant 
Schlosser for his exceptional service and con-
gratulates him on this recognition. May his 
steadfast example of leadership inspire others 
to live a life of service to a cause greater than 
themselves. It is my extreme honor to award 
him the 2021 Congressional Veteran Com-
mendation for the Third District of Texas.

MAYOR GARY GIBERSON 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 1, 2021 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, ‘‘thank 
you’’ are two words that will never be enough 
to say to a man like Mayor Giberson and his 
devotion to public service. 
Mayor 
Gary 
Giberson exemplifies what it means to be a 
public servant. Mayor Giberson began as a 
volunteer firefighter in 1953; the Scout Master 
of Troop 61 until 1989, and Mayor of Port Re-
public from 1985 until April 2021. 36 years as 
an elected official is certainly telling of a man’s 
character, and even more, it’s indicative of a 
respective 
constituency’s 
pulse. 
Mayor 
Giberson truly did keep the Mayberry ‘‘feel’’ 
relevant, in the City of Port Republic. His ten-
ure in office and the accolades that seemed to 
flow in naturally over the course of thirty-six, 
years, has not, and will never go unnoticed. I 
thank Mayor Giberson for his unwavering 
dedication and devotion to public service and 
to the City of Port Republic. God Bless Mayor 
Giberson, and God Bless America.

TRIBUTE TO DON CHILDERS 
HON. HAROLD ROGERS 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 1, 2021 
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, 
I rise to wish my good friend, Don Childers 
from Letcher County, Kentucky a very Happy 
90th Birthday. 
Don has been a close friend over the years, 
becoming one of my earliest and strongest po-
litical allies in the coalfields of Kentucky’s Ap-
palachian region. He has led a remarkable ca-
reer in the oil industry after starting from hum-
ble beginnings in Hellier, Kentucky. 
Hard work and determination have defined 
his storied lifetime. Don put himself through 
college by driving a coal truck, earning $13.05 
per day. He earned an associate degree from 
Pikeville College in 1952 and a bachelor’s de-
gree in business from the University of Ken-
tucky in 1954. That same year, Don was draft-
ed into the U.S. Army and was stationed in 
Germany, leaving behind his wife and new-
born daughter. After fulfilling the call of duty, 
he returned to Hellier High School in 1956, 
where he accepted a job as a teacher and 
basketball coach. Education, however, be-
came the shortest term of his career. 
Six weeks into his new job as a teacher and 
coach, Don was offered a job with Gulf Oil 
Corporation as a Territory Manager, spanning 
22 counties in southeastern Kentucky. Work-
ing with some of the best operators in the re-
gion, Don quickly learned the ropes of the pe-
troleum business, leading to speedy pro-
motions within the company. Ten years after 
working for the Gulf Oil Corporation, Don

asked for the rare opportunity to purchase the 
Whitesburg operations, so he could raise his 
family at home in the mountains of Eastern 
Kentucky. The company accepted his offer 
and Childers Oil was born. Today, they em-
ploy over 1,000 people, including its full-serv-
ice 24-hour convenience stores and affiliated 
companies. 
The Childers Oil Company has always been 
a family venture with his wife, Peggy, leading 
kitchen recipes and retail operations. Their two 
daughters and son-in-law now play key roles 
in the company, and the third generation is 
coming on strong with a full understanding of 
their grandfather’s business philosophy. This 
family-owned and operated business is also a 
wonderful steward of the communities they 
serve, partnering with numerous civic and 
charitable organizations every year, rein-
vesting in the region they love so much. 
In addition to Don’s work in the oil industry, 
he has tirelessly worked to bring additional 
jobs and opportunities to the region through 
his work on the Letcher County Planning 
Commission, which he established with a 
group of community leaders 17 years ago. 
They have patiently advocated for a federal 
corrections facility to be built in Letcher Coun-
ty to create hundreds of good-paying jobs in 
Eastern Kentucky. Knowing the additional op-
portunities that could arise with a new prison, 
Don also launched the Letcher County Airport 
Board to meet aviation needs in our moun-
tainous terrain. He is a bold, visionary leader 
who has inspired many others to think out-of- 
the-box for innovative industry goals in East-
ern Kentucky. Don is also a man of great faith, 
having dedicated more than 55 years as a 
member of the Whitesburg First Baptist 
Church. 
I count it a great honor to celebrate Don 
Childers and his many accomplishments on 
his 90th birthday. I hope this year is filled with 
many more blessings for Don and his family.

HONORING THE LIFE OF RUBY DE 
VERA 
HON. JIMMY GOMEZ 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 1, 2021 
Mr. GOMEZ. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great sorrow that I share that the city of Los 
Angeles lost another angel earlier this year. 
Her name was Ruby de Vera and she was a 
community leader, an activist, and a fierce ad-
vocate in Northeast Los Angeles. 
Ruby was a remarkable person who worked 
tirelessly as a champion in both City Hall and 
out in the community. She was a role model 
and a true public servant who epitomized the 
best qualities including courage, selflessness, 
and an unwavering commitment to justice. 
Ruby’s lifetime of dedication and service will 
be remembered and greatly missed by all 
whom she encountered and all those who 
were impacted by her leadership. May it bring 
comfort to her family, friends, and loved ones 
that so many are celebrating the life she led 
and praying for them at this time. 
CHRISTIAN WOLFE—EAGLE SCOUT 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 1, 2021 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, ascend-
ing to the rank of Eagle Scout is an accom-
plishment unlike any other. Those involved 
with the Boy Scouts of America devote their 
lives to the organization’s foundational prin-
ciples of ethics and morals. They embody 
what it means to be ‘‘physically strong, men-
tally awake and morally straight.’’ However, 
their drive and motivation extend far beyond 
the organization’s principles and into the 
classroom and community. What Christian has 
accomplished is a culmination of hard work 
and perseverance. He and his family should 
be incredibly proud. Make no mistake, his ac-
complishment serves as a testament to his 
grandfather’s influence in his life. Congratula-
tions on this stellar achievement. God Bless 
Christian and God Bless America.

vate First Class Mike Rumfield of McKinney, 
Texas. 
Originally from Santa Ana, California, Pri-
vate First Class Michael Rumfield proudly 
served in the United States Army for which he 
was awarded the Army Achievement Medal, 
Army Good Conduct Medal, Army Service Rib-
bon and Air Assault Badge. 
Following his time in service, Mike began a 
dedicated 20-year career in law enforcement 
holding positions as a Corrections Officer, 
Corrections Sergeant, Field Training Officer, 
SWAT member and Team Leader, Deputy 
Sheriff, and his current role as Collin County 
Chief Deputy Constable for Precinct 4. As a 
Chief Deputy Constable, Rumfield is dedicated 
to serving the citizens of Collin County in a fair 
and impartial manner to execute all court or-
ders and to promote a safe and secure envi-
ronment with the highest level of integrity. 
In 2016, along with his wife, Lailani, 
Rumfield founded the America’s Defenders 
Foundation which supports disabled veterans 
that have answered the call of duty to the 
United States and who have defended our na-
tion’s values and families. The organization 
also maintains an intense motivation to sup-
port our nation’s law enforcement officers. 
Their annual Thin Blue Line Ball provides hun-
dreds of law enforcement officers and their 
spouses an evening of entertainment while 
raising funds to support their efforts. Addition-
ally, as past President of the Collin County 
Deputies Association, Mike advocated for 
Collin County public safety officers while sup-
porting members in times of need. 
Chief Deputy Constable Mike Rumfield con-
tinues to make a difference in the lives of 
those whom he serves, and we recognize him 
for his efforts to support our military, veterans, 
and first responders. 
Today a grateful Nation thanks Private First 
Class Rumfield for his exceptional service and

steadfast example of leadership inspire others 
to live a life of service to a cause greater than 
themselves. It is my extreme honor to award

RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE AND 
LEADERSHIP OF J.D. GROM, EX-
ECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE NEW 
DEMOCRAT COALITION 
HON. RON KIND 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 1, 2021 
Mr. KIND. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the service and leadership of J.D. 
Grom, Executive Director of the New Demo-
crat Coalition. 
J.D. began his tenure as Executive Director 
when I was Chair of the New Dems. I was im-
mediately impressed by his work ethic, vision, 
and expertise—qualities that were obvious to 
everyone who had the opportunity to interact 
with J.D. over the years. I asked him to do a 
lot in terms of getting to know the members of 
the Coalition—what they care about and 
what’s important to the districts they rep-
resent—and he stepped up, developing an ex-
ceptional understanding of the members and 
their priorities. 
J.D. recently left Capitol Hill to join the 
Biden Administration in the Department of 
Commerce, and I know I speak for all mem-
bers of the New Democrat Coalition when I 
say he’ll be sorely missed. 
New Dems have seen so much positive 
change and growth over the past eight years 
with J.D. at the helm. Made up of 95 mem-
bers, New Dems play a critical role in Con-
gress not only in advocating for pragmatic, 
pro-growth policies, but also in working to 
bridge the partisan divide and lower the tem-
perature in Washington. 
New Dems are focused on moving our na-
tion forward by tackling some of our toughest 
challenges and delivering results for the Amer-
ican people. J.D.’s outstanding leadership has 
made these efforts possible. 
After working for his hometown Representa-
tive, Melissa Bean of Illinois, the Department 
of Treasury, and four different New Dem 
Chairs, J.D. has demonstrated an outstanding 
commitment to service that will carry him far in

CONDEMNING RELIGIOUS 
PERSECUTION IN BANGLADESH 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 1, 2021 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to support of victims of violent religious perse-
cution in Bangladesh. I have been informed 
that currently, about 14 million people are fac-
ing religious persecution solely for their Hindu 
beliefs. There is documented numerous at-
tacks on Hindu temples, businesses and 
homes. People have been brutally killed and 
raped due to their religious beliefs. l strongly 
condemn the violent and immoral actions of 
those who harm others simply because they 
have a different religion. 
Madam Speaker, the persecution of reli-
gious minorities will not end without strong ac-
tion by the government, in this case Ban-
gladesh. All governments are duty bound to 
protect their citizens and promote the freedom 
to worship. I call upon the government to 
make every effort to end the violence and pro-
tect religious minority populations within its 
borders. In order to protect its people, the gov-
ernment should restrict extremist groups that 
exert any violent influence over the country’s 
political, social, legal, and religious affairs. 
Only then can peace and religious freedom be 
restored in Bangladesh. 
The United States and Bangladesh have a 
friendship with deep ties among and between 
its people. Like Bangladesh, the United States 
has religious minorities. To truly flourish and 
prosper, the rights of all people to be secure 
in their property and their lives must be en-
sured. I encourage the government of Ban-
gladesh and offer the full support of the United 
States in helping it protect its religious minori-
ties. May God bless both our nations.

HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF 
MARIAM C. NOLAND FROM THE 
COMMUNITY 
FOUNDATION 
FOR 
SOUTHEAST MICHIGAN 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 1, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Mariam C. Noland on the 
occasion of her retirement from the Commu-
nity Foundation for Southeast Michigan after 
over thirty-five years of service as President. 
Her significant contributions to our southeast 
Michigan community are worthy of commenda-
tion. 
A graduate of Harvard University and Case 
Western Reserve University, Ms. Noland was 
an experienced leader in the nonprofit and 
community foundation field before arriving in 
Michigan. Prior to being named as the found-
ing President of the Community Foundation for 
Southeast Michigan in 1985, she worked at 
the Cleveland Foundation and the Saint Paul 
Foundation, as well as at colleges in Ohio and 
North Carolina. 
As President of the Community Foundation 
for Southeast Michigan, she helped create and 
fund countless programs that benefit our com-
munity. These include the GreenWays Initia-
tive, the New Economy Initiative, the HOPE 
Fund, Southeast Michigan Healthy Youth, 
Healthy Seniors, and the Family Development 
Program. These programs uplift diverse popu-
lations, invest in environmental initiatives, pro-
mote community health, advance justice and 
policing reform, and help our local economy 
thrive. Her work to secure endowments in per-
petuity for many of the Foundation’s programs 
will help transform southeast Michigan, and 
the impact of her work will be felt for years to 
come. During her tenure, the Community 
Foundation’s assets have grown to more than 
$1.1 billion, placing the Foundation in the top 
25 nationally. 
Ms. Noland currently serves on the Board of 
Trustees at the Bipartisan Policy Center in 
Washington, D.C., the Detroit Riverfront Con-
servancy, and the Downtown Detroit Partner-
ship. She is the recipient of the Special Life-
time Achievement Award for Leadership in 
Philanthropy, has been named Michiganian of 
the Year by the Detroit News, and has an 
award in her name at the Community Founda-
tion—the Mariam C. Noland Award for Non-
profit Leadership that recognizes a nonprofit 
president or CEO in Southeast Michigan who 
is an exceptional leader in their organization 
and beyond. She resides in Grosse Pointe 
Farms with her husband James. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Mariam C. Noland for an ex-
emplary nearly four decades of dedicated 
service to the Community Foundation for 
Southeast Michigan. I join with Mariam’s fam-
ily, friends, and colleagues in extending my 
best wishes to her in retirement.

PITNEY, 
RECIPIENT 
OF 
TEXAS’ THIRD CONGRESSIONAL 
DISTRICT 
2021 
CONGRESSIONAL 
VETERAN COMMENDATION 
HON. VAN TAYLOR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 1, 2021 
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, today, it is 
my privilege to honor fifteen distinguished mili-
tary veterans from Texas’ Third Congressional 
District who answered the call to serve their 
Nation honorably, both in uniform and fol-
lowing their return to civilian life. The recipi-
ents of the 2021 Congressional Veteran Com-
mendation exemplify the time-honored quali-
ties of patriotism, service before self, and bold 
leadership. Following their time in service, 
their efforts in our community have earned 
these fine individuals recognition as the recipi-
ents of this prestigious commendation. Their 
stories of sacrifice will encourage future gen-
erations to pursue a life dedicated to the very 
values we cherish as Americans: faith, free-
dom, and democracy. One such hero is 1st 
Lieutenant Glee Pitney of Dallas, Texas. 
Glee Pitney graduated from Bowling Green 
State University in 1954 whereupon he was 
commissioned as a Second Lieutenant of Artil-
lery in the United States Army, The newly 
married Glee was soon assigned duty at Fort 
Sill, Oklahoma before being transferred with 
the Far East Command in South Korea. Pitney 
was assigned to the 11th Field Artillery Bat-
talion and the 3rd Engineer Battalion as an as-
sistant division fire marshal overseeing four 
fire stations. 
For his service, Lieutenant Pitney was 
awarded the National Defense Service Medal. 
Following his time in the military, Mr. Pitney 
returned to Ohio and entered the family truck-
ing business until his retirement. In 1997, Glee 
relocated to Dallas where he became heavily 
involved in his community as a founding mem-
ber of his homeowners association and as an 
active member of Volunteers in Patrol for 
which he received recognition from the Dallas 
Police Department. 
In 2006, Glee and his wife moved to High-
land Springs Retirement Community where he 
earned a reputation as an extraordinarily ac-
tive community leader. His civic involvement 
includes serving as the first Chair and Vice- 
Chair of the General Services Committee, liai-
son to the Transportation Department, as a 
member of the Resident Advisory Council, and 
Chairman of Government Affairs Group. His 
commitment to our veterans remains strong as 
evidenced by his role as the founding Chair-
man of the Veterans Affairs Group, which 
today includes nearly 400 veterans, wives and 
widows. Mr. Pitney’s efforts were instrumental 
in the creation of the Highland Springs Vet-
erans Memorial Park and he is a strong sup-
porter of the DFW Honor Flight where he has 
assisted almost fifty Highland Springs resi-
dents with travel to our Nation’s Capitol. 
Lieutenant Glee Pitney is a stellar example 
of a servant leader who embodies patriotism 
and a steadfast commitment to his community. 
Today, a grateful Nation thanks Lieutenant 
Pitney for his exceptional service and con-
gratulates him on this recognition. May his 
steadfast example of leadership inspire others 
to live a life of service to a cause greater than

RECOGNIZING THE SESQUICENTEN-
NIAL OF RURAL SHAD BAPTIST 
CHURCH 
HON. BRIAN BABIN 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 1, 2021 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize 
the 
Sesquicentennial 
of 
Rural 
Shade Baptist Church, located in the commu-
nity of Tarkington Prairie in Liberty County, 
Texas. 
In 1870, a small group met in a brush arbor 
in Tarkington Prairie, symbolizing the begin-
ning of a new church. The congregation was 
made up of hardworking, compassionate indi-
viduals determined to provide a robust and 
moral foundation for their community. On July 
3, 1878, a deed was granted ‘‘for the purpose 
of the erection and occupancy of a Baptist 
Church and Masonic Hall . . .’’. Later that 
year, a two-story building was completed. 
While the top floor was dedicated to the Ma-
sonic Lodge, the bottom floor served as the 
sanctuary of the Rural Shade Baptist Church. 
In 1902, Rural Shade started a choral 
school, collected their first offerings for the 
Buckner Orphans’ Home, and took on a lead-
ership role in forming the Tryon Evergreen 
Baptist Association. Five years later, they con-
structed a second building, costing $1,470.00. 
Soon after, church members granted the trust-
ees of Oakdale High School, the first high 
school in Tarkington Prairie, permission to use 
the old church building, while the members 
moved into their newly constructed second 
church building. Over the years, Rural Shade 
has completed several building projects and 
renovations, including adding a third church 
building in 1938, a baptistry in 1945, a fourth 
church building in 1962, a youth wing in 1993, 
and a fifth building in 2005, which also serves 
as the church’s current worship center. Re-
markably, over the last 151 years, the church 
has remained on the same tract of land. 
Early 
pastors 
were 
elected 
from 
the 
church’s men each year until 1898 when pas-
tors were first called to stay for an indefinite 
period. In 1944, the church hired its first full- 
time pastor. Former Pastors of Rural Shade 
Baptist Church include: D. D. Forman, B.F. 
Ellis Jr., J.M.A. Black, D.W. Jackson, J.A. Lee, 
O.P. Chambers, H.C. Morrison, J.W. Thomas, 
E. Loose, J.B. Marshall, J.L. Watson, J.E. 
Mott, J.H.H. Ellis, B.S. Franklin, T.J. Fouts, 
J.F. High, Henry Jones, W.H. Jones, R.W. 
Smith, R.J. McGinty, D.P. McGowan, H.C. 
Philips, W.A. Smith, H.R. Pressley, Bert Mat-
tingly, W.A. Curtis, H.R. Pressley, D.L. Sin-
clair, G.M. Coe, Earl Hahn, R.L. Self, LeRoy 
Cooper, C.D. Sowell, Dale Mingus, John Gar-
rett, J.B. Grimes, Albert Foster, Earl Be Iver, 
and Byron Reeves. Since 2016, Brad Dancer 
has served as the church’s pastor. 
Over the past two decades, Rural Shade 
Baptist Church has aided the community tre-
mendously in response to natural disasters. In 
2005, 2008, and 2016, individuals were shel-
tered and housed after the devastating 
aftermaths of hurricanes Rita, Ike, and Harvey. 
During Hurricane Harvey, the church assisted 
with high water rescues, saving individuals 
from flooding homes and buildings. Through-
out the COVID–19 pandemic, the church 
joined the Houston Food Bank and distributed 
$3 million worth of food to local families in 
need. In fact, for his outstanding leadership 
and service to his community, Pastor Dancer 
was awarded the Citizen of the Year in 2020 
by the Greater Cleveland Chamber of Com-
merce. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to congratu-
late the Rural Shade Baptist Church on reach-
ing their Sesquicentennial last year and their 
151st anniversary this year. Over the past 
century and a half, the Lord has certainly used 
this historic church to demonstrate the love, 
kindness, and generosity of Jesus Christ to 
the good people of Southeast Texas. I am 
privileged to represent such a devoted and 
faithful place of worship in my district.

JOSHUA LEE—EAGLE SCOUT 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 1, 2021 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, the rank 
of Eagle Scout is the highest, and most pres-
tigious in the Boy Scouts of America. Anyone 
involved in the organization will understand 
the determination, persistence, and hard work 
it takes to obtain the rank. Joshua has not 
only demonstrated his commitment to his 
troop, but also his community, school, and 
himself. He exemplifies what it means to be, 
‘‘physically strong, mentally awake and morally 
straight.’’ Congratulations to Joshua on his ex-
traordinary accomplishment. God Bless Josh-
ua and God Bless America.

FUTURE OF RADAR 
HON. TOM COLE 
OF OKLAHOMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 1, 2021 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
highlight important research being conducted 
by the University of Oklahoma, which is ad-
vancing cutting-edge developments in the 
areas of Air Defense Artillery, air dominance, 
ocean surveillance, ISR, EW, counter-UAS, 
GMTI, and a host of others. The develop-
ments I refer to center most directly in the 
budding area of all-digital radar. 
New capabilities associated with all-digital 
radar present an extraordinary opportunity for 
the United States to better utilize important 
data for national security purposes, be it 
weather data, flight control data, projectile 
data, targeting data or any other type, to our 
tactical and operational advantage—land or 
sea. 
Madam Speaker, in the area of distributed 
radar and 360-degree, all-digital, phased array 
radars, there are extraordinary leap-ahead ca-
pabilities which cannot be ignored. By bringing 
to bear advances in digital signal processing, 
artificial intelligence, and machine learning to 
the data streams that this new technology pro-
vides, the defense of the United States can be 
significantly advanced, providing leapfrog ca-
pabilities which vastly exceed those of our leg-
acy radars. 
Over time, all of the services have been en-
gaged in developing capabilities in this area, 
albeit at a rate that does not always achieve 
the leap-ahead and transformational require-
ments that we now require strategically as we 
focus on defense from potential near-peer ad-
versaries. While we currently maintain many 
advantages, 
technology 
advances 
quickly 
around the globe. It is critical we maintain our 
edge, and, in doing so, obtain the generational 
leap-ahead needed to secure it. 
Madam Speaker, the Advanced Radar Re-
search Center (ARRC) in Norman, Oklahoma, 
has conducted very significant research in this 
area. A component of the University of Okla-
homa’s research enterprise, the ARRC has 
generated important technological advance-
ments to each major service component in the 
area of 360-degree phased array radars. In 
fact, to help further this contribution, I am sup-
porting a National Defense Authorization Act 
proposal this year, initiated in the Senate, 
which encourages the Army Research Lab to 
collaborate with academia in the development 
of distributed radars and multi-function sen-
sors. This is an area where I believe there will 
be plenty of bipartisan and bicameral support. 
Madam Speaker, Army Research Lab in 
many ways has stepped forward for the Army 
in this area. I am confident that, as the Army’s 
Combat Capabilities Development Command, 
Army Futures Command, and the ASA/ALT 
examine what can be accomplished in this 
area, they will quickly realize the high rel-
evance of this technology to counter-UAS, Air 
Defense Artillery, and their EW enterprise. It 
has the potential to be one of the key trans-
formational technologies that would allow the 
Army to leverage ground forces more effec-
tively and to provide better defensive capabili-
ties against airborne threats. 
As the Department of Defense proceeds to 
develop technology in this area, we already 
see interest from the private sector. However, 
if we do not develop a joint approach to the 
development of this technology, it may result 
in it being stove-piped into systems without 
ever realizing the full extent of its capabilities. 
Furthermore, inability or unwillingness to co-
ordinate research in this area could tax current 
supply chains and threaten the rate of devel-
opment we are capable of in this area. 
Additionally, application of this technology is 
not limited solely to the defense enterprise. Air 
traffic control, weather prediction and analysis, 
5G frequency scanning dependent commu-
nications, and remote sensing could all ben-
efit; NOAA is already engaged in related re-
search. Therefore, over time, it may become 
beneficial to create a Joint Interagency Work-
ing Group on the development of distributed 
and all digital radar. 
Madam Speaker, the future is bright for the 
development of these technologies in the 
United States. It is an area in which we can 
thrive. I look forward to working with my col-
leagues in the House and Senate to advance 
our common interests and our national de-
fense by supporting the development of these 
technologies.

WENEFRETT WATSON’S 
CENTENARIAN BIRTHDAY 
HON. BARBARA LEE 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 1, 2021 
Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize Mrs. Wenefrett Watson 
on her 100th birthday, and honor her decades 
of service in our East Bay community. 
Mrs. Watson was born in Marshall, Texas 
on October 29, 1921, to Dr. Oliver Wendell 
Phillips and Mayme Cecelia Adam Phillips. 
She completed two bachelor’s degrees during 
her undergraduate studies, one in English Lit-
erature from Bishop College and one in Li-
brary Sciences from the University of Southern 
California. She worked for the U.S. Depart-
ment of Agriculture in Washington, D.C., 
where she met her husband, Dr. James A. 
Watson. The Watsons relocated to Oakland, 
California in the 1950s, where Mrs. Watson 
became active in the Oakland public schools. 
Mrs. Watson has been an important civic 
leader in our Oakland community. She was in-
volved in many local organizations, including 
the Oakland Museum Commission, the Oak-
land Symphony Board, and the Oakland Anti- 
Poverty Board. Mrs. Watson’s civil involve-
ment is also notable, including her work with 
the PTA in the Oakland schools, and later with 
membership of the Oakland Bay Area Links, a 
volunteer service organization of women com-
mitted to ensuring the economic and cultural 
livelihoods of African Americans. She was also 
passionate about civil rights, and became ac-
tive with the NAACP, the Urban League, and 
eventually ran for City Council. 
Mrs. Watson is a trailblazer in the Oakland 
business community, as a business owner and 
entrepreneur. She created and managed 
WenTravel and Cruise travel agency in the 
1980s, holding contracts with the City of Oak-
land, County of Alameda, and the State of 
California. Mrs. Watson’s work was exception-
ally impactful as she offered young African 
American business owners’ opportunities to 
follow in her footsteps. When she retired, she 
sought inspired and passionate young African 
American entrepreneurs who would carry on 
her business and her work in our Oakland 
community. Mrs. Watson remained active after 
retirement, inspiring other community leaders 
through her work in helping to start the Black 
Film Makers Hall of Fame. In 1997, she was 
honored by the Black Business Listings for her 
outreach and leadership. 
Today, on behalf of California’s 13th Con-
gressional District, I commend Mrs. Wenefrett 
Watson for her lifelong work as a leader, activ-
ist, and entrepreneur, and warmly wish her a 
happy 100th birthday.

Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, today, it is 
my privilege to honor fifteen distinguished mili-
tary veterans from Texas’ Third Congressional 
District who answered the call to serve their 
Nation honorably, both in uniform and fol-
lowing their return to civilian life. The recipi-
ents of the 2021 Congressional Veteran Com-

stories of sacrifice will encourage future gen-
erations to pursue a life dedicated to the very 
values we cherish as Americans: faith, free-
dom, and democracy. One such hero is Ray-
mond Richardson of McKinney, Texas. 
In 1965, at the age of 17, Raymond Rich-
ardson joined the United States Navy where 
he was assigned to a Medivac Unit for the 1st 
Marine Air Wing in DaNang. 
Hospital Corpsman Third Class Raymond 
Richardson was awarded the National De-
fense Service Medal, Vietnam Service Medal, 
and Vietnam Campaign Medal for his service. 
In his civilian life, Mr. Richardson has been 
staunch advocate for our veterans within our 
community. During his tenure as McKinney 
VFW Commander, Raymond led several 
unique service initiatives benefiting both vet-
erans and the citizens of Collin County. Im-
pressively, he completed over 130 community 
service projects including raising relief for vet-
erans healthcare and arranging hotel accom-
modations for stranded veterans. One special 
initiative includes his annual organization of a 
Christmas Party for the children of the Samari-
tan Inn where families are invited to the VFW 
to share a meal with Santa and Mrs. Clause 
prior to receiving gifts. Mr. Richardson also 
spearheads efforts to prepare and distribute 
care packages for military members oversees 
and local veterans in need in conjunction with 
the students of McKinney Christian Academy. 
As a longtime and valued member of the 
VFW National Legislative Committee, Mr. 
Richardson has advocated on a variety of vet-
erans issues. He has served in a multitude of 
roles within the VFW earning numerous acco-
lades including the Recruiter Award, Early Bird 
Award, the Kansas City Spree Award, and 
Past State Commanders Leadership Award. 
Richardson is the proud father to three 
daughters and grandfather to eight. We com-
mend him for his tireless efforts on behalf of 
our veterans and the citizens of Collin County. 
Today a grateful Nation thanks Corpsman 
Richardson for his exceptional service and 
congratulates him on this recognition. May his 
steadfast example of leadership inspire others 
to live a life of service to a cause greater than 
themselves. It is my extreme honor to award 
him the 2021 Congressional Veteran Com-

HONORING 
2021 
CALIFORNIA 
TEACHER 
OF 
THE 
YEAR 
JIM 
KLIPFEL 
HON. MIKE GARCIA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 1, 2021 
Mr. GARCIA of California. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to commend and honor Califor-
nia’s 2021 Representative for Teacher of the 
Year, Mr. Jim Klipfel. A U.S. History teacher 
and Athletics coach from my alma mater of 
Saugus High School, Mr. Klipfel is the embodi-
ment of academic passion, humility, and serv-
ice to others. While his family, friends, and 
students would be the first to say that Mr. 
Klipfel is not one to embrace the spotlight, 
there is not a shadow of a doubt as to wheth-
er he truly deserves the honorific title of 
‘‘Teacher of the Year’’. 
At Saugus High School, Mr. Klipfel has 
served as an athletic and academic mentor to 
generations of students, going above and be-
yond what is normally expected of an educator 
to impart the leaders of tomorrow with invalu-
able lessons and qualities to help them suc-
ceed and make the world a better place. He 
has always challenged students to think for 
themselves, reject the status quo, and ‘‘pull 
back the curtain’’ to expose the faults of exist-
ing systems in the hopes of improving them. 
He has poured his heart and soul into his pro-
fession and the success of those whose edu-
cation he has been entrusted with. It is not a 
responsibility that he takes lightly. His friends, 
colleagues, and most of all his students bear 
witness every day to how much Mr. Klipfel 
gives of himself to ensure the success of his 
students. He does so with unbridled intel-
ligence, kindness, and above all else, passion. 
Recognizing the unique challenges that 
American high schoolers face today, Mr. 
Klipfel has prioritized students’ well-being and 
mental health while also pushing them to go 
beyond their comfort zone and realize their full 
potential. He achieves this by putting in the 
work to make himself available to any student 
who needs help and by walking them through 
mistakes in order to learn from them. He rou-
tinely holds after-hours study sessions to help 
students better prepare for tests, and never 
shies from lending a helping hand to those 
who may be in difficult situations outside the 
classroom. He always strives to teach his stu-
dents lessons that will help them beyond aca-
demics, such as the value of charity, making 
the best out of difficult situations, and the im-
portance of civic engagement. 
In the face of numerous challenges over the 
past two years, Mr. Klipfel has proven to be a 
resilient figure in the CA–25 community. After 
a school shooting in November of 2019, he 
helped his school rebuild and become strong-
er in the aftermath of tragedy. As the world 
transitioned to online learning and Zoom 
classes, Mr. Klipfel worked to keep students 
engaged and active in the classroom to en-
sure their continued academic success despite 
the odds facing them. 
I am proud that such an exemplary teacher 
was selected to represent California’s 25th 
District and California at large on the national 
stage and honored for his service and accom-
plishments. Mr. Klipfel no doubt represents the 
best of what teachers can be, and the promise 
of the future when we invest ourselves into 
helping young people realize their full potential 
inside and outside of the classroom. Califor-
nia’s 25th district, our state, and our country 
are grateful for all Mr. Klipfel has given our 
community as he continues to inspire and 
educate the leaders of tomorrow.

TRIBUTE TO STEVEN BLANK 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 1, 2021 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor Steve Blank, an entrepreneur who has 
inspired thousands of innovators to solve 
some of the world’s most pressing problems. 
Steve Blank was born in New York City to 
immigrant parents and attended the University 
of Michigan for one semester. He then served 
his country for four years in the U.S. Air 
Force, repairing fighter planes in Thailand. 
Steve Blank was fortunate to return to Sil-
icon Valley in the exciting 1970s. He worked 
for 21 years in high tech, and founded many 
companies, including Zilog, MIPS Computers, 
Convergent Technologies, E.piphany (now 
Epiphany) and retired in 1999. In the mid- 
1990s, he created the Customer Development 
model that focused on distinguishing between 
companies that execute business models as 
opposed to startups that search for them, thus 
launching the LeanStartup movement. 
In 
2011, 
Mr. 
Blank 
created 
the 
LeanLaunchPad experiential entrepreneurship 
class at Stanford University, Columbia Busi-
ness 
School, 
and 
UC 
Berkeley. 
The 
LeanLaunchPad changed the way entrepre-
neurship is taught by giving students hands-on 
experience in what it takes to start a company 
instead of having them write business plans. 
Also in 2011, the National Science Foundation 
adopted Mr. Blank’s LeanLaunchPad cur-
riculum for its Innovation Corps (I-Corps), in 
order to help the nation’s leading scientists 
and engineers learn how to take their tech 
ideas from the lab to the marketplace. The 
NSF I-Corps is now the standard for how sci-
entific research is commercialized in the U.S. 
It has been adopted by other federal research 
agencies (including NIH, DOE, HHS, and 
NSA), and has trained 1,900 teams, and 
launched over 1,000 startups. 
In 2016, Mr. Blank, Joe Felter, and Pete 
Newell created Hacking for Defense (H4D) at 
Stanford University—the first in a series of 
mission-driven entrepreneurship courses to 
provide a new platform for national service 
and change the way critical national security 
problems are solved. H4D is supported by

Congress and taught at 48 universities in the 
U.S. and at universities in the United Kingdom 
and Australia. H4D also gave rise to several 
sister courses that are accelerating mission- 
driven entrepreneurship in other sectors and 
policy arenas. These courses include: Hacking 
for Diplomacy, Hacking for Oceans, Hacking 
for Cities, Hacking for Energy, Hacking for 
Homeland Security, Hacking for Recovery, 
and Hacking for Climate and Sustainability. 
As a result of Mr. Blank’s work, hundreds of 
students at universities across the U.S. are 
engaged right now in a new form of national 
service, helping to create a pipeline of innova-
tion for our nation as they solve real problems 
at startup speed. As a result of their experi-
ence in a LeanLaunchPad or ‘‘Hacking for X’’ 
courses, many of these students are choosing 
careers in the public sector. 
Steve Blank has written many books, teach-
es entrepreneurship at Stanford and other dis-
tinguished institutions, and has earned numer-
ous accolades for his innovative work. He was 
listed as one of the Masters of Innovation by 
the Harvard Business Review and one of the 
30 Most Influential People in Tech by Forbes. 
He won the 2013 Silicon Valley Visionary 
Forum award, and with his wife was honored 
with the 2013 Environmental Leadership 
Award. He has often been a commencement 
speaker and his speech at Philadelphia Uni-
versity was ranked one of 300 best com-
mencement speeches in the last 300 years by 
NPR. 
Madam Speaker, I ask the entire House of 
Representatives to join me in honoring Steve 
Blank on the occasion of the 10th Anniversary 
of the LeanLaunchPad and the 5th Anniver-
sary of H4D. Steve Blank has made our stu-
dents wiser, our environment cleaner and our 
country stronger. He is a national treasure.

FREEDOM ISN’T FREE 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 1, 2021 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, Veterans 
Day is approaching and although we recog-
nize these selfless individuals annually, one 
day surely is not enough. Every year we honor 
these individuals and their sacrifices, but we 
don’t always get to hear their stories. Here, in 
South Jersey, we have an incredible commu-
nity of active military and veterans, as well as 
their families. Today we honor three individ-
uals: Jerry Callahan, Marco Polo Smigliani, 
and Ronald Rease. Their stories have been 
depicted in Veronica Dudo’s, Emmy-nomi-
nated story, Freedom Isn’t Free. These men 
put their lives on the line for our country in 
three wars. These men, all from South Jersey, 
are Purple Heart recipients after they were 
wounded in battle protecting our great Nation. 
As a district, and a Nation, we owe uncondi-
tional reverence to the three of them for their 
sacrifices to this country. I thank the gentle-
men, it is an honor to be their Congressman. 
RECOGNIZING 
JAMES 
A. 
SUL-
LIVAN, WORLD WAR II VETERAN 
AND AMERICAN HERO 
HON. BRIAN J. MAST 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 1, 2021 
Mr. MAST. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Mr. James A. Sullivan, a veteran of 
World War II, a true American hero and a pil-
lar of our North Hutchinson Island community. 
For nearly a century, Mr. Sullivan has com-
mitted to the betterment of his community. At 
the young age of seventeen, before he had 
even graduated from high school, he an-
swered the call to serve his nation. In fact, he 
sent his sister in his place to accept his di-
ploma and enlisted in the U.S. Navy with his 
parents’ signature. 
During his time with the U.S. Navy, Mr. Sul-
livan rose to the rank of Third-Class Petty Offi-
cer Radioman. He was assigned to the elite 
contingent stationed on Merchant Marine ships 
that transported critical supplies to the U.S. 
military across the Pacific throughout World 
War II. This was a dangerous role: despite its 
name, the U.S. Navy Armed Guard had little 
defensive equipment and sustained one of the 
highest casualty rates of any military division. 
Following his time in the Navy, he earned a 
degree from Bunker Hill Community College, 
and felt a continued call to service. He joined 
the Thin Blue Line and served for nearly four 
decades as a police officer in Medford, Mas-
sachusetts. 
Along with his beloved wife, Theresa, he is 
the cornerstone of a loving family who is con-
tinually inspired by his example of service, pa-
triotism and love. 
To quantify Mr. Sullivan’s impact is nearly 
impossible. His determination and dedication 
are inspiring to all those he meets. I can say, 
without a doubt, that our Nation is a better 
place because of his leadership. 
Our Nation has a proud history of military 
service, and the many men and women who 
have worn the uniform deserve to be held in 
the highest regard. All Americans owe a great 
debt of gratitude to their fellow citizens, like 
Mr. James A. Sullivan, who have valiantly 
served, and particularly as we recognize Vet-
erans Day, I would like to convey my sincerest 
appreciation to him.

IN 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
SARA 
CASASSA, 2022 NEW HAMPSHIRE 
TEACHER OF THE YEAR 
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 1, 2021 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
congratulate Sara Casassa on being named 
New Hampshire’s 2022 Teacher of the Year. 
Serving her community as a teacher for the 
past three decades, Sara has made a lasting 
impact on the lives of students and families 
across the New Hampshire public school sys-
tem. 
Sara arrived at Barnard School in 2009 as 
a language arts teacher while also having 
knowledge as a webmaster and technology in-
tegrator. Sara’s compassion and selflessness 
have given her the ability to cultivate an effec-
tive learning environment both virtually and in 
the classroom. It is without doubt that Sara 
has been an asset for students inside and out-
side the classroom. Moreover, her easy-going 
personality and sense of humor has made her 
beloved amongst the South Hampton commu-
nity. 
As the proud product of Manchester public 
schools, I know firsthand that access to a 
high-quality education is the cornerstone of 
our democracy, our economy, and our future. 
Sara’s dedication to her profession, to pro-
viding a robust and engaging education expe-
rience to her students will no doubt lead to 
countless open doors for her students down 
the road. Sara is an example of what an ex-
ceptional educator and leader looks like. 
On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-
shire’s First Congressional District, I want to 
congratulate Sara for her achievement and 
thank her for her decades of service to our 
community. Sara has demonstrated a deep 
dedication to teaching and inspiring our future 
leaders. This is a well-deserved honor.

CHASE MAZUR—EAGLE SCOUT 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 1, 2021 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, the Boy 
Scouts of America is a youth organization that 
instills moral and ethical principles in young 
people. Ascending the ranks in this youth or-
ganization is no easy feat, but for those who 
reach the pinnacle, it is a mighty accomplish-
ment. The rank of Eagle Scout is the highest 
in the BSA and does not come easy. Chase 
has accomplished an incredible goal, of which 
he and his family should be proud. He has ex-
emplified what it means to be a leader in his 
community; a leader within his troop and orga-
nization; and leader in the classroom. I con-
gratulate Chase on his incredible accomplish-
ment. God Bless Chase and God Bless Amer-
ica.
